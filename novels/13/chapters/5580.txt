Chapter 5581: I Will Kill You

The truncheon was Wang Teng’s strongest weapon since it accumulated his power. Thus, the smash left everyone trembling in horror.

A youth wielded such an unstoppable might and impressed the veterans in the crowd. Six-finger himself might not be able to stop the attack directly.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, didn’t bother trying to block it. He focused on his goal - seizing Turmoil’s five dao fruits.

They were connected to his supreme grand dao yet Li Qiye still dragged them away. True blood gushed in the air, painting a shocking scene.

This had the same visceral and merciless vibe as someone having their head and spine pulled away from the torso.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Boom!” The next development shocked them even more - the truncheon struck Li Qiye directly but didn’t injure him at all.

Primordial rays radiated from him as if he were one with the world, using his body to stop the destructive smash.

This was utterly inconceivable - not needing to rely on merit laws and treasures for protection. They thought that it would rupture his flesh and cause blood to spray. The actual result made people wonder about existing damages to the truncheon, rendering the blow rather ineffective.

Wang Teng knew just how powerful the strike was. That was enough to pulverize a twelve-fruit conqueror, albeit not enough to kill one outright.

“Pop!” Li Qiye tightened his grip and reduced the fruits and the supreme grand dao to ashes.

“You!” North Star’s expression was as ugly as can be. Rage overwhelmed his heart and sanity - something evident from the looks in his eyes.

Meanwhile, spectators ranging from the weak to the strong were at a loss for words. The dao fruits were known for their toughness but he still crushed them as if they were fried dough.

“Run!” Turmoil cried out one last time before starting his journey across the yellow river.

He wanted to be saved earlier but after losing his dao fruits, he knew that it was over. His son - as great as he was - couldn’t save him.

His last thought was wanting his son to run away as fast as possible, earning him the respect of the crowd.

“Boom!” Wang Teng released all of his anima power.

“I will kill you!” His roar contained endless rage and sorrow. Some unfortunate sovereigns nearby were reduced to blood.

Most couldn’t withstand his anima's wrath, falling to the ground in the process.

Twelve-fruit dao lords and conquerors hurriedly retreated from the battlefield since Wang Teng was blinded by rage. They could see that he was ready to destroy the world to avenge his father. Sinking the immortal continent and massacring all of its inhabitants were perfectly fine.

He did not need this world if it meant living under the same sky as Li Qiye. The feud of patricide was irreconcilable. His rage swept across the entire immortal continent.

“I will kill you even if it is the last thing I do!” His reverberating roar shattered the sun, moon, and stars.

Countless beings trembled in fear, even dragon lords and conquerors. They could see his next move already - one of cataclysmic consequences.

“I will spare you if you leave now.” Li Qiye said flatly, unaffected by the opponent’s rage.
