Chapter 4938: Three-armed MonarchFị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The geniuses including Halo, Swordgrasp, and Goldcrest couldn’t interfere either. This battle was beyond their current level.

Though they were at the Immortal Sovereign level, the disparity was immense. The issue for them was the sacred fruit.

It possessed immense dao knowledge and a connection to heaven and earth. Immortal Sovereigns couldn’t compete with it.

“Boom!” The battle between the saber and the light raged on.

Though the academy had numerous barriers and blessings, the ground was still shaking violently.

The remnant shockwaves caused weaker students to vomit blood. Alas, Ascension eventually proved his superiority with the grand dao.

Though both had one fruit, he had cultivated for longer and had better harmonization with his fruit.

After gaining the upper hand, he refrained from pursuing the young monarch. Instead, he turned his attention to Bai Shaojin and reached out with his palm, intent on capturing the youth.

His palm sucked everything closer, rendering Bai Shaojin helpless despite having activated his dao.

“This is not the place for you to do as you please!” A voice boomed out in a moment of crisis.

With a loud clank, a powerful and intimidating slash materialized, causing everyone else to feel overwhelmed by its immense force.

Both the young monarch and Ascension could tell that this was dangerous.

They roared and activated their affinity - one used the light while the other used the saber dao. “Boom!” Both had to stop what they were doing.

“First Brother!” The students saw Yue Shanjian joining the fight.

He couldn’t sit still and let these two do as they please in Abroad.

"This is the academy." He declared, still exuding sword dao as he stood like an unshakable protector.

“First Brother, this student stole a peerless item from Deity, I am merely trying to get it back. Please excuse me.” The young monarch said.

“Benevolence does not belong to Deity!” Bai Shaojin shouted: “This belongs to The People, Feather Monarch stored the resources of Immemorial Palace in this vessel, I found it on an old battlefield in Deity, it has nothing to do with it.”

“Did you hear that?” Ascension laughed: “Looks like Deity can’t get involved.”

“That’s not for you to decide, Sacred Lord.” The young monarch uttered coldly: “It belongs to Deity and we shall bring it back.”

“No, The People shall have jurisdiction over it!” Ascension unleashed a resplendent slash while shouting: “Junior, hand it over!”

“You dare?!” Yue Shanjian immediately blocked him from attacking Bai Shaojin with a sword slash.

In this split second, the young monarch rushed over while shouting: “I apologize for this, First Brother.” His golden radiance enveloped both combatants.

The fight made students run for their lives. It seemed that this would reach a stalemate.

“Retreat!” Yue Shanjian protected Bai Shaojin, allowing him to run toward Hundred Hall in the academy.

“Fellow Daoist, don’t be so hurry to leave.” A gigantic palm reached for Bai Shaojin.

“Damn! Firmament Mountains!” He roared.

Peaks came together and piled up into a single one, soaring upward against the palm.

Alas, the palm pushed the sword-form mountains down, causing Shanjian to stagger backward.

His vitality and energy started churning; he realized that the opponent was far stronger.

“Who may you be?!” He shouted.

A muscular man floated in the air, wearing a treasure robe blessed with nine floating stars. He was born with three arms. They had unique totems and different abilities.

His dragon lord aura made everyone feel as if there was a giant stomping on them.

“Three-armed Monarch!” Yue Shanjian’s expression changed after seeing him.

“Ancestor.” On the other hand, many students from Deity became excited. Those from Immortal Pagoda bowed down.

He was a top ancestor from Immortal Pagoda, already having been a dragon lord since ten thousand years ago. He had two fruits and was stronger than Shanjian.

“I apologize, Fellow Daoist.” He exuded dao hymns and intimidated weaker cultivators.

Earlier, he had already held back, not wanting to injure Shanjian on the academy’s territory.

“Deity must extend its reach to the academy?” Shanjian asked with a serious expression.

“No, Fellow Daoist, please open a path so that we can take back our item.” Three-armed shook his head.

“The academy has rules and does not allow outsiders to interfere, please leave.” Shanjian didn’t relent.

Though Deity was considered to be the number one lineage right now in the lower continents, the academy was still not afraid. It had survived the test of time.

“Then there’s nothing else I can do but force the issue.” Three-armed said.

“You wish to do this alone?” Shanjian’s sword energy intensified.

“Bam!” Another large figure appeared above Abroad, causing the clouds to disperse.

His aura enveloped the scene and caused students to shout in astonishment. This godlike entity had four faces while wearing a robe with the color of the evening clouds.

Just looking up at the being pulsing with worldly energy made people tremble.

“Count me in as well.” His loud voice rang painfully in everyone’s ears like the morning bell.
