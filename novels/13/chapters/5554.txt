Chapter 5555: Slap

“What did you say?! Why does their heavenly general want to kill the divine ox?!” Guo Cheng panicked as well.

“I’m told that the divine ox went insane and started a rampage. They are trying to kill it now!” The cultivator said.

“Fairy, Immortal, I don’t know what to do.” Guo Cheng said nervously: “If the divine ox is killed, the Deity of Livestock won’t be able to bless the land any longer.”

The divine ox served a similar role as the divine stalk and medicine horse - the medium to contain divinity and faith.

“Let’s take a look.” Li Qiye said.

“I know where it is, I will lead the way, Immortal.” Guo Cheng couldn’t wait any longer since his responsibility was protecting the people of Momentous Frontier.

After arriving at the scene, they saw a herd of wild oxen consisting of thousands and thousands charging like a tsunami. The rumbling engulfed heaven and earth.

Though this was a frightening sight, the oxen were the ones scared and panicking - running frantically in an attempt to escape while trampling trees along the way.

Loud explosions came from a peak in the distance - a battle between Wang Chong’s forces and a divine ox the size of a peak.

Its mane cascading downward resembled countless waterfalls. It possessed a mighty frame with bulging muscles. It looked like it was carved from granite, brimming with strength.

Its eyes were spirited and resembled two lanterns, capable of illuminating the surroundings for ten miles.

Its pair of horns glowed golden and were filled with divinity. Alas, the creature was infected with gray strands that squirmed around like maggots.

It was also filled with wounds, looking weak and on the verge of defeat. On the other hand, Wang Chong’s army had high morale. He roared vigorously, looking full of confidence.

“Stop! What are you doing, Wang Chong!?” Baifeng was livid.

“This ox is possessed by evil, look at its decaying body, we must kill it before a full transformation and prevent further disasters!” Wang Chong shouted and continued the assault.

“Nonsense, the divine ox is the intermediary for the Deity of Livestock!” Baifeng entered the battlefield.

“Stop her until I kill it!” Wang Chong’s hair fluttered to the wind as he gathered more energy.

The soldiers of West Bank initiated a grand formation to stop her.

“Die!” Wang Chong utilized the lighting affinity for an explosive spear. Space caved in from the attack.

“Boom!” It pierced the ox, causing it to fall to the ground and bellow in pain.

“You want to die?” Li Qiye entered the battlefield as well and glanced at Wang Chong.

“Pompous junior, state your name, I do not kill nobodies.” Wang Chong’s pride reached an all-time high after taking down the ox, fearing no one - especially not this ordinary man.

“So be it, death is your choice.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmph, ignorant fool, I’ll be the one doing the killing!” Wang Chong said furiously, ready to kill anyone standing in his way. The guy might be an insect but he didn’t mind stomping one today.

His lightning spear crackled thunderously and shot a beam straight at Li Qiye. The latter didn’t bat an eye and stood still.

“Boom!” The lightning beam struck Li Qiye and dispersed, not leaving any injury.

As a four-fruit dragon lord, Wang Chong was smart enough to realize that he had misread the situation. His expression soured but it was too late.

Li Qiye casually waved his palm downward and a slap appeared from above. It was as if the entire sky was pressing down upon Wang Chong.

“Activate!” Wang Chong roared and his four sacred fruits became resplendent. He pushed up with both hands and tried to seal the area around him to stop the palm.

“Bam!” The slap still struck him, sending him flying like a meteor and smashing into the ground, leaving a deep pit.

He spat out blood repeatedly; his body was crushed. He hurriedly healed and tried to get back out.

Alas, Li Qiye was there and stomped down on him, fully immobilizing him. Rage and fear overwhelmed him as he vomited more blood. He had never tasted such humiliation since his dao debut.

Li Qiye ignored him and glanced over at the dying ox. The lightning beam had pierced its body earlier so it was lying in a pool of blood.

Its eyes bulged outward while its divinity gradually dispersed. This caused the gray strands to become stronger. Without the divinity’s protection, they drilled into the ox with the intent of taking over.

Li Qiye raised his fingers again and extracted the strands, one by one. This caused the remaining ones to hurry their invasive process, aiming to hide inside the ox.

This didn’t work as Li Qiye hastened the extracting process. Some changed their method and decided to gather together, shooting a powerful beam at his head. He resorted to his dao flame again which seemed rather effective against the unknown entity.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He then used his primordial light and illuminated the ox’s decaying body, stitching up the injuries and rebuilding its flesh and muscles.
