Chapter 3745: Direct Confrontation

The atmosphere felt awkward and oppressive for the holy ground’s members. It would be too embarrassing if no one accepted the challenge.

Dugu Lan, Hu Ben, and Phantom couldn’t fight since they needed to focus on their real opponent.

“Allow me to see your techniques, Brother Xiao.” One person finally stepped forward.

He wasn’t as tall as Xiao Fengyun but still looked quite tough and brimming with power - seemingly capable of moving anything in front of him.

“It’s Lin Hao.” Others recognized the youth.

“One of the five heroes from Duality Academy, maybe there’s a chance of victory.” Some became excited.

“There are only three heroes now.” Another quietly said.

The crowd then remembered that Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi have been killed by Li Qiye.

“Maybe other students will take their spots.” One student said.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief. At least they didn’t need to do it themselves. Plus, Lin Hao was strong enough to put up a good fight.

“Senior Brother Lin, you got this!” The students from Duality started cheering.

Lin Hao’s bravery earned points for the academy since everyone else hesitated.

“I have heard of you before, Brother Lin.” Xiao Fengyun said: “Your furious axe is a top technique in the holy ground. It is an honor.”

“It’s just an exaggeration, I am nothing compared to the real heroes in this world.” Lin Hao shook his head.

In recent days, he became more introverted and humble, fully focusing on cultivation.

“You’re too humble. You are rumored to be a master at the Furious Flame Law, it will be a fortune to see it.” Xiao Fengyun said.

People were surprised to see Fengyun knowing so much about Lin Hao.

“Looks like Righteous did their homework, clearly researching the top talents in our holy ground.” One youth said softly.

“Obviously, they had to prepare before challenging us.” Another said while being glad that he didn’t step up.

Xiao Fengyun already knew Lin Hao’s techniques and abilities, maybe other arts as well.

“It’s just an earth-level law with limited power. I hope I won’t make a fool out of myself.” Lin Hao said.

Lin Hao certainly had the worst background out of the five heroes. He came from nothing instead of his peers who were usually from the nobility.

Li Xiangquan and the others already had access to top merit laws or ancestral arts even before joining Duality.

This wasn’t the case for Lin Hao. He started as an ordinary student in Duality and learned elementary merit laws at the start.

An earth-level law was impressive for regular cultivators. However, it wasn’t much for the influential nobles and geniuses. This was his biggest disadvantage. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Senior Brother Lin still has an inborn fate palace.” One Duality student said.

His fate palace allowed him to excel against the odds. Nonetheless, his starting point was still lower than others.

“A senior once told me that merit laws decide an individual’s starting point but as for their height? It’s up to them.” Fengyun said.

“I do agree with that. Seems like even if I were to lose, it won’t be a vexing defeat.” Lin Hao laughed.

“Let’s get started then.” Fengyun walked forward while holding his saber.

“I hope I’ll be able to see the famous Evil Devourer art of Righteous.” Lin Hao walked forward as well.

“I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed because I’m too slow to learn this supreme art. I’m not qualified either.” Fengyun smiled wryly: “My art is from my clan, Thunder Saber Art. It might not be enough to enter your sight.”

Fengyun deliberately revealed his best merit law.

“The Xiao is one of the top five clans in Righteous.” Dugu Lan interjected: “Thunder Saber Art is certainly a top-tier technique. According to the rumors, Righteous Dao Lord received points from the seniors of the Xiao Clan and learned this art. He stopped using it after becoming a dao lord but later on, he helped modify this art.”

She wasn’t trying to boast her knowledge, only to remind Lin Hao.

“A saber technique fixed by a dao lord.” Others became startled and thought that they were lucky to hold back.

“Fairy, it seems like you know everything, maybe more about our clan than some of our own members.” Fengyun praised her.

“It’s no big deal, I had a trip abroad at Righteous during my youth.” Dugu Lan said.

Others haven’t heard of her experience before in Righteous.

“Brother Lin, the truth is I am indeed at the grand level. Please be careful now.” Fengyun took a deep breath and told Lin Hao.

This was rather unexpected. Fengyun’s goal was to test the geniuses in the holy ground. But now, he revealed his merit laws and cultivation realm before the start of the fight.

Victory or defeat actually didn’t matter here; only information gathering. What was the point in fighting then?

“Incredible. And Brother Xiao, I’ve only recently reached the grand level as well.” Lin Hao also stated his cultivation realm.

“Senior Brother Lin is at the grand level now?” Some Duality students couldn’t believe it.

“So the rumors are true. He just didn’t admit it before.” Another student said.

“Duality Academy is incredible, even someone who has no background to speak of can reach this realm.” One older expert became emotional.

“People of talent appreciate one another.” An expert commented.

Xiao Fengyun and Lin Hao have never met before but they seemed to be appreciating each other and could have been friends under different circumstances.

“Brother Xiao, make your move.” Lin Hao took out two axes that were hanging on his waist.
