Chapter 4909: Zhao Dachiu

She was none other than A’jiao, the mysterious girl that has shown up before.

Li Qiye jumped up and told Jian Yunyun: “Come on up.”

Yunyun paused for one second before deciding to jump up and sit in the back. Today has been an eventful one, albeit puzzling. Too many coincidences that weren’t coincidences.

“Go!” A’jiao shouted and the carriage became one with the night.

People couldn’t even feel that it was speeding since it had entered a different space-time dimension, or an entirely new plane of existence.

Of course, Yunyun didn’t recognize this special phenomenon.

“Not bad, let me have this carriage?” Li Qiye asked.

“If we become family, then what’s mine is yours anyway.” A’jiao flirted with him, certainly not a sight for sore eyes.

Yunyun was affected but Li Qiye didn’t mind. He smiled and said: “Far from enough to even start the negotiation.”

“As I’ve said before, Father is willing to negotiate. You just have to let us know.” She leaned closer, latching onto Li Qiye.

It was one thing when A’jiao didn’t speak. Alas, the combination of her flirty voice and coquettish expression was too much for Yunyun to handle.

“It is still the same.” Li Qiye said flatly.

“Then your heart is made of stone. You are putting me in a difficult situation.” She said.

Yunyun stared at Li Qiye, unable to guess their relationship. It sounded as if they were talking about marriage. So Li Qiye would marry her if her father were to agree to certain conditions?

This wasn’t a baseless assumption since A’jiao didn’t seem to be a good catch. Each of her actions truly made others uncomfortable.

“Little Bro, if you don’t seize this opportunity, it’ll be problematic.” A’jiao said.

“How so?” Li Qiye asked.

She touched his chest with her finger and said: “Zhao Dachiu from the next village wants to marry me.”

“Your father agreed?” Li Qiye smiled.

The glimmer in her eyes suddenly changed, causing Yunyun to feel that she was no longer as offputting as before. This exuded an unfathomable aura that only lasted for a split second.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“This doesn’t need my father’s agreement. You know about this guy, he’s not a good person at all. When the time comes, he might just kidnap and marry me.” A’jiao tried to look sad and cute.

Yunyun, despite being a nice person, had the urge to kick her off the carriage after seeing this.

“Isn’t this good news? Two happy events happening at once.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Don’t you know that I only have room for you in my heart?” A’jiao stared intensely at him.

Yunyun thought that Li Qiye must have done something to A’jiao and then fled. A’jiao seemed deep in love with him.

“This Zhao Dachiu is an evil guy, to say the least. He’ll marry me and use my father as a tool.” A’jiao complained.

“Yeah, no one can compare to your father when it comes to evil.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“You shouldn’t say that…” A’jiao stomped her foot: “The guy got too many friends, my father’s two hands can’t deal with four fists.”

“Your father is experienced. Many full of bravado thought that they could kill him. Now, they don’t even have a marked grave while your father is alive and well. Zhao Dachiu can’t handle a sly fox like him.” Li Qiye said.

“Then you haven’t thought this through. Even if he doesn’t defeat my father, he might use our tools to beat you down. It’ll be over for you then.” She said.

“That actually makes me excited. We’ll see who will be beating who down.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m just worried about you. You might be able to beat him but what if he breaks into your house and destroy everything? That sounds terrible, right?” She said.

“So ultimately, still wanting to work with me?” He asked.

“Nothing can be better than your cooperation. My father will be generous.” She winked.

“No, thank you, I don’t trust the sly fox.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“That’s rather rude of you. Father is coming with sincerity.” She said.

“What is he worrying about? Others should be afraid of him, not the other way around.” Li Qiye shook his head.

Yunyun has been listening to them the entire time. “Father”, “Zhao Dachiu”, “tools”? This sounded like two villagers gossiping about trivial matters that have nothing to do with cultivation.

“Lil Bro, I’ll be honest.” She said: “Father said that the village isn’t that united, he is worried that one day, some might cause trouble and it’ll be difficult for you. They might not be able to harm you but can still cause damage to your home.”

Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed after hearing this. Yunyun became intimidated after staring at him; she felt as if the world has just become tiny like a speck of dust. Thus, she was even tinier in comparison.

She suddenly forgot to breathe and wanted to get down on her knees. Of course, this feeling was also fleeting.

“Is this a threat?” Li Qiye coldly said.

“Your words are so cold.” She said with indignation: “You already know how I feel about you. Father likes you as well and doesn’t want anything bad to happen to you. We are merely trying to prevent it.”

“He just wants someone to sweep up the trash.” Li Qiye smiled.
