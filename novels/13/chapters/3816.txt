Chapter 3817: Unexpected

Righteous Scion’s answer piqued the crowd’s interest.

He was certainly mighty but Sword Hero was no slouch either. Moreover, the latter has been in isolated cultivation for so long. Rumor has it that he was comparable to the grandmasters now.

What would be the outcome of a battle between these two?

“Righteous Scion wants to fight Sword Hero?” One member of the holy grounds said: “Does he have any chance of winning?”

Others would have been laughed out the door for talking about fighting Sword Hero. It was nothing short of suicidal for overestimating oneself.

Of course, this wasn’t the case for RIghteous Scion. Nonetheless, people still found it unsuitable.

“Well, I believe there are accounts of Righteous Sect Master losing to him. I think the scion is actually confident in winning.” An insightful big shot stated.

This comment evoked rumination. Yes, this rumor was a thing. However, who here actually saw it in person?

Therefore, skepticisms and doubts remained of this story. Some believed that the sect master only spread this rumor in order to pave the way for the scion’s future since he was the next successor anyway.

“Prince, you’re unbeatable, teach him a lesson!” One aggressive youth shouted: “Show him the holy ground’s power so that others can’t look down on us!”

Some youths have been frustrated ever since the scion set foot on the holy ground. He overshadowed everyone else by being untouchable.

Thus, they hoped that Sword Hero would be able to take him down a notch, allowing them to vent.

Meanwhile, the ancestors didn’t say anything. They found it improper for Sword Hero to fight against a junior.

In fact, the holy ground actually had a fair number of older cultivators capable of beating the scion. These ancient ancestors simply found fighting him distasteful, no glory in the victory either.

Sword Hero was a supreme genius of the last generation. Even if their age was relatively close, the lack of propriety remained.

Nonetheless, the youths were just too vexed to care about these issues.

Sword Hero furrowed his brows after hearing the challenge. His eyes narrowed as he spoke: “Fine, let’s see the top genius of Righteous Sect then.”

Having said that, he raised his hand and summoned countless energy swords in the air, forming an ocean of blades.

The swords blotted out the sun. As he waved his hand, they formed a maelstrom with rays leaking out, ravaging the area.

The crowd’s robes and sleeves were being cut by loose energy waves so they immediately retreated.

“Take this, Junior!” Sword Hero roared in an intimidating fashion, akin to hearing thunder out of nowhere during spring.

“Clank!” The maelstrom transformed into a heavenly sword of unimaginable size. It could definitely split the stars.

The slash devastated the fabrics of space. The world turned dark right away as the crowd gasped in horror.

The scion laughed after seeing this earth-splitting slash while being eager to fight. His Heavenseize became resplendent again as he thrust it upward. It looked like a golden dragon using its claws to meet the slash directly.

“Boom!” The scion’s feet dug into the ground as he sank deeper.

The power of the slash was too much so the ground around him collapsed right away.

The spectators were impressed with both combatants. The slash had incredible destructive potential but the scion still managed to stop a direct attack from someone perhaps comparable to the four grandmasters.

“The best of the young generation.” One ancestor gave him a thumbs-up.

The young ones didn’t say anything. It was too hard to find negative words regarding the scion.

“Not bad.” Sword Hero swung his hand downward and activated his sword intent. The heavenly sword became brighter, ready to kill the scion.

“Bring it!” The scion was undeterred and had no intention of dodging.

“Clank!” However, someone else successfully parried the energy sword before it could make its way to the scion.

No one expected this development. They saw a woman standing next to the scion now - Xu Cuimei. They knew who she was since she was the messenger for the scion’s challenge.

“We’re leaving.” Xu Cuimei immediately pulled his arm and ran, once again surprising the spectators.

The great scion was actually running away?

“I can still fight.” The unhappy scion told Xu Cuimei during their escape.

“You might not be strong enough to take him on.” Xu Cuimei said while running towards Duality Academy with lightning speed. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“We don’t know that yet, I’m not afraid either.” He remained unconvinced.

“Forget about him, someone else from the holy ground will punish him. An ancestor fighting a junior is improper.” She replied.

The scion was still dissatisfied but still chose to follow Xu Cuimei.

“What just happened?” This wasn’t the result the crowd expected out of this fight.
