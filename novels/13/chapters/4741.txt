Chapter 4742: Sky’s End Five Ancestors

The river demon led by example and crossed through the air to approach Li Qiye. His banner fluttered to the wind and gave off a creepy feeling.

Crowd members suddenly tasted something that could only be described as “death”. Where he stood became the gates of hell with howling ghosts and devils. The fiendish horde was ready to invade the mortal world.

They then recalled the rumors about this river demon - how he massacred kingdoms and turned the citizens into specters. This was indeed a fate worse than death.

“Boom!” At this moment, the spider god also descended downward. Despite its tiny size, it landed on the ground with the impact of a mountain and left a huge crater behind.

“Right.” Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor landed as well, slamming his shield into the ground and creating an uncrossable border.

This suddenly made his allies feel safer. As long as he and his shield were there, they would be able to stop all attacks.

“He’s extremely strong.” An expert said: “No one can break his shield.”

“Incorrect.” A big shot said: “Everlasting Monarch nearly killed him with one swing back in Yin Yang Crossing.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Well, that’s Everlasting Monarch, someone who can fight a dao lord and the junior brother of Blessed Dao Lord. There aren’t many like him in history.” A sacred monarch shook her head.

Everyone agreed with this because Everlasting Monarch was one tier above the big shots present.

“Boom!” After Heavenseal made his move, five majestic figures landed next, seemingly dragging a corner of the sky into the ground.

These five armored men had an ancient battle intent and resembled top generals.

Previously, Tian Feng’s battle intent was frightening but also mad. These five’s battle intents had a suppressive and deterring affinity, forcing their foes to yield before fighting.

Few recognized who they were but their auras told everyone that they were stronger than Heavenseal.

“Sky’s End Five Ancestors.” An old cultivator who has lived for eras recognized them and gasped: “They were Worldraiser Dao Lord’s generals who helped him obtain the throne.”

“I see…” Ancestors shuddered after hearing this.

“Oh? Someone still recognizes us.” One of them spoke calmly. His voice had a metallic ringing and a strange rhythm that affected others’ courage.

“The ultimate competition leaves behind countless bones and brutality beyond your imagination. You are alone but be afraid not, the world is vast and there will be a place for you if you leave now.” Another told Li Qiye, advising him to give up.

His words carried ample weight since his group of five had helped Worldraiser become a dao lord previously. He had experienced the competition firsthand.

“True, the birth of a dao lord leaves behind countless bones. However, it won’t be my bones.” Li Qiye retorted with a smile, not afraid of these mighty foes.

“You do have the bearings of a dao lord. We’ll see if you can become one.” The third general praised, not angry by the lack of respect.

“Anyone else?” Li Qiye scanned the battlefield. Those hiding in the darkness or observing from a distance were all spotted by him.

No one else spoke right now since most didn’t want to be involved in this competition. As for the other big shots from True Immortal such as Six Dao Monarch? They wanted to watch and see Li Qiye’s true power, waiting for the right time to strike.

“I see, let’s make it more interesting.” Li Qiye smirked and slowly took out the immortal gemstone.

Its radiance initially blinded spectators but he made a fist to cover the rays. His fist shined brilliantly in a magnificent manner.

“The gemstone…” This captured everyone’s attention. None could deny their desire for this artifact.

“Come, this will be another prize for the dao lord competition. Whoever survives today will win it as well.” Li Qiye smiled.

This tempted listeners but they didn’t forget the initial goal - killing Li Qiye. Who knows if a skirmish would break out afterward for the gemstone after his death?

“Boom!” The sky vault suddenly opened and expanded after his suggestion.
