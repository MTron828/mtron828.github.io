Chapter 5109: Li Qiye Will Win

“If that’s the case, die!” Greenmountain roared: “Behold!”

He summoned a divine mountain empowered by sacred runes. It immediately took over the airspace over Li Qiye and came descending with a grinding force.

This move could destroy the target’s dao and vitality in no time at all. Space withered as a result of the impact.

Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye and casually waved his hand - once again displaying his supremacy by repelling the mountain back into the air.

“Rumble!” Greenmountain Conqueror staggered backward after the first exchange.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Stop!” Ascension Conqueror joined the battle by swinging his divine scroll, sealing all the dimensions around Li Qiye. The scroll extended and surrounded the target.

Meanwhile, the rest of the world became frozen. Their dao laws and energies couldn’t be channeled at all.

“Not bad.” Li Qiye smiled and didn’t try to stop it.

Thousands of unique mudras rushed out of the scroll. A fist came for his head; another finger strike aimed for his heart… These hands tried to hit his weak spots from all directions.

After letting the move finish, Li Qiye retaliated with a punch against the scroll.

“Crack!” The mudras shattered but fortunately, the supreme scroll managed to withstand the punch without being pierced through. Ascension Conqueror also staggered backward.

“Take this!” Six-pot leaped into the air and attacked after seeing Li Qiye’s might.

“Buzz.” One pot opened and released a nether yin law capable of sucking various affinities.

“Run for it!” Those nearby were scared out of their mind. They felt a nether wind passing by and robbing them of their dao and strength.

This was the Yin Pot, one of the six. Its effect sucked vitality and power into the darkness, leaving the victims helpless.

Experts and ancestors found themselves trapped in the void, unable to muster an ounce of strength. They fell to the ground while screaming in horror.

Li Qiye was the main focus so he became trapped in the void as well. The yin affinity attempted to steal his power.

“My turn, I apologize, Fellow Daoist.” Vessel summoned her personal sword.

Everyone from her generation recognized it right away.

“It’ll be a devastating slash.” A dragon lord said, recalling how she used it to dominate her peers back then. Although the technique and the sword were the same, she was far more powerful now.

The sword itself was unbelievably sharp. Rumor has it that during the collapse of an ancient epoch, a vessel made from an immortal metal made it out unscathed. The sword was made from a part of its hull.

“Wavecleaver!” She roared and her technique summoned numerous ships and swords. They traveled in the direction of her slash with one target in mind - Li Qiye.

“Clank!” The crowd bellowed in horror because its speed surpassed time itself.

It reversed time in its trajectory, making it impossible to dodge. Spectators felt as if Li Qiye’s head was already cut off before the actual impact.

“Scram.” Li Qiye slapped the slash as if he was disciplining a child or crushing n ant.

“Boom!” Six-pot and Vessel Conqueror’s techniques were immediately nullified and they were forced back.

The four conquerors clearly lost the first exchange and Li Qiye was not even taking it seriously.

They stabilized their stance but internally, their vitality and energy were churning uncontrollably. This made them nearly vomit blood.

“He’s untouchable!” Spectators couldn’t help but shout after seeing Li Qiye showing his superiority over these conquerors.

Just any one of them could dominate the lower continents but he had no problem pushing them back.

“He got this!” Members of The People became confident again.

“Victory is ours!” They didn’t hold back from expressing their jubilation.
