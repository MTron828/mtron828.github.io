The elders were present along with numerous protectors. This added immense pressure to the participants.

The carvings of beasts and fiends looked quite animated on the bells, seemingly on the verge of flying out and devouring people. This frightened them as well, causing a few to sit far away.

There was no guideline to the sitting arrangement so some strategized, thinking that being far away might weaken the bells’ effect. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Let’s keep our distance and the sound might be weaker. We just need to make it past one movement and we’ll be good.” One disciple said quietly to a junior brother. This wasn’t his first time.

Thus, most chose the four corners or the central area. Very few sat in the front.

The reason was very simple. The front had a large golden bell, the largest thing in the hall. It had the carving of a great dragon raising its claws and showing its fangs. Its mouth seemed eager to swallow the ones in the hall.

An elder was in charge of it. Even a fool could tell that this was the main bell. Whoever sat to the front would have to face its power.

However, Gong Qianyue chose the front to face the bell. She knew of its power but still wanted to test herself in a direct confrontation.

Li Qiye naturally sat next to her, still leaning on her shoulder to sleep. She had tried to push him off several times but he feigned ignorance, still blatantly doing his thing to the chagrin of the spectators.

Huang Ning’s fury ignited again so he uttered coldly: “This is an examination, how improper it is for him to sit like this! He’s ruining the prestige of our sect!” He wanted to kick Li Qiye out or worse, stomp him into bits.

Li Qiye didn’t respond to this criticism either. Qianyue didn’t know what to do outside of glaring at him. She didn’t know why she was showing so much patience either. She should have sent him flying given her temperament.

“Senior Brother, he’ll leave after the bells start, this piece of trash won’t be able to listen.” Other disciples consoled Huang Ning.

Of course, they were telling themselves this to feel better. Everyone shared the same enemy right now in Li Qiye.

“He’ll go crazy in a little bit and you can throw him out to stop him from bothering other people.” Another said.

They eagerly waited for the start of the trial to see Li Qiye’s misfortune.

On the other side, Zhan Hu slightly frowned. The strongest disciples in Divine Black were sitting to the front because they wanted to challenge the golden bell as well.

“Junior Sister, I don’t think he’ll be able to handle the bell. It’ll bother others from protecting their dao heart.” Zhan Hu told Gong Qianyue.

He didn’t hate Li Qiye out of jealousy like his peers. Nonetheless, he still viewed the guy as a potential problem, a thorn in his side.

“That’s right, Junior Sister. Let him scram to the corner so that he won’t bother us.” Huang Ning nodded.

All in all, Huang Ning was more annoyed with Li Qiye sleeping near her than the actual trial. This was only an excuse for him to not see Li Qiye.

“One’s dao heart should be unaffected by external matters in the first place. If they’re distracted by others, then what’s the point?” She flatly answered.

Huang Ning and Zhan Hu had no response to this. The rest of the spectators couldn’t say anything either.

All of them decided to direct their anger at Li Qiye instead of her. Huang Ning, in particular, was extremely annoyed at Qianyue’s bias towards Li Qiye.

“Don’t blame me for not being polite when he bothers me from going crazy.” Huang Ning said. He made up his mind about dealing with Li Qiye once the guy failed to endure the music. He would send Li Qiye flying first before the protectors and disciples. His murderous intent intensified.

Gong Qianyue naturally noticed his bloodlust. She raised her finger and summoned her samadhi flame before declaring: “Senior Brother, there are rules in this hall so you don’t need to worry. The examiners will deal with it.”

The temperature in the building rose. It seemed that just one spark of her flame could incinerate the entire place.

Everyone took a deep breath while looking at her finger. Even a fool could tell that she was protecting Li Qiye.

Huang Ning had no idea why she was so hellbent on protecting this guy. He scowled and turned his head towards another direction. A sinister glint flashed then as he became determined to kill Li Qiye in the future. Torture first, of course.

The others thought that they would be okay with it if she treated Huang Ning in this manner. After all, Huang Ning was an exceptional cultivator, the most excellent male in the sect.

This wasn’t the case for Li Qiye and it drove their jealousy into overdrive.

Needless to say more about Li Qiye’s terrible talents, in terms of his background - he came from a tiny village. His looks? As mediocre as can be. In fact, one could grab a random person on the street and the guy would be better looking than Li Qiye...

Qianyue ignored them and maintained a cold expression. She looked at Li Qiye sleeping next to her and found him different.

His free temperament and unrestrained style were unique. He would probably stay calm even if the sky was falling down or if he was stuck in hell...

These things contributed to his mysteriousness. This implicit quality could only be seen with time, eventually becoming an attraction.

She eventually stopped thinking about him, finding her cheeks to be slightly red. She tried to put on a serious expression afterward.

Bah! Bah! What am I thinking?! This bastard even spied on me. I’m already doing him a favor by not teaching him a lesson in public. Let’s wait till we’re alone and I’ll show him...

She gritted her teeth after recalling the unsavory event. On the other hand, the root of her suffering was sleeping well. He seemed capable of sleeping regardless of the time and place.

“Ahem.” The elder in charge of this trial saw that the students have found their seat and said: “Since everyone is here, I’ll begin by talking about the rules. There will be three musical movements.”
