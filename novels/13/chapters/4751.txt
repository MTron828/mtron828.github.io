Chapter 4752: Enveloping Monarch

The heavenly bulwark actually managed to stop the power of the gemstone. This certainly amazed the surviving spectators.

Earlier, the first wave of offense was carried out by incredible cultivators. They didn’t hold back and used their proudest techniques. Unfortunately, they failed to withstand the immortal rays.

Only the heavenly bulwark was able to stop it. This confirmed the potential of the three patrimony strikes.

“Buzz.” The forehead of the alliance members shined brightly since they were putting everything they got into the bulwark.

“Mastery is wonderful indeed.” A demon king said.

“Nothing in the world can break it, this is the best defense in existence.” A big shot said.

“It’s not even its peak state.” An old ancestor said: “If Skywheel Dao Lord was the one in charge, it would truly be unbreakable.”

This stirred the crowd as they started imagining the dao lord in action. After all, this was his weapon and technique. It would certainly be superior to this version.

“Yes, his bulwark could last for an eternity. It protected his army as they invaded a forbidden zone. He actually kept all of them safe.” An old demon who had met the dao lord before said.

“Even a forbidden zone couldn’t break it down?” This shocked the crowd.

“A bit interesting, you can’t see this type of defense all the time. Let’s see how long it’ll last.” Li Qiye seemed amused.

With that, he added some of his vitality to the gemstone. “Boom!”

The rays cut through the mountains and rivers, flattening the earth entirely. Unfortunately, this also wiped out any living creature in the vicinity. They didn’t have the chance to react in the slightest.

“Crack!” Though the bulwark technique has reached an immaculate level, it still couldn’t handle the continuous boost in power from the gemstone. Cracks started to appear.

“It’s going down!” The ancestors from afar couldn’t believe it.

“I’m sure possessing that gemstone means being unbeatable.” A demon god’s heart beat faster.

They witnessed the indestructible bulwark just now, thinking that it was the highest peak of cultivation. Alas, the gemstone still surpassed it by a long shot.

“Well, you have to be able to control the gemstone power first, or it’ll be suicidal.” A big shot understood that it wasn’t all fun and game. Using the body as a vessel for its power was as dangerous as can be.

“Ugh…” The leading members had a hard time withstanding this power and coughed out blood. This was even worse for the supporting cast consisting of sovereigns. If this were to continue, they would be reduced to blood.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t up to them since they were caught under the suppression of Li Qiye’s punch.

He had to let go or they needed reinforcement. Losing was only a matter of time under the current trend.

“This is decided.” One spectator said. The alliance has lost despite using all of its resources. Could this be the end of the dao lord competition already? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Bam!” Suddenly, the world shook as if a colossal creature with boundless weight has just landed. The earth couldn’t withstand its existence.

In reality, people looked over and saw an old man walking closer. Each step took him a billion miles forward and he appeared on the horizon.

The world seemed to be moving with him. He possessed something grand despite wearing an ordinary robe.

Others couldn’t help but want to bow their head in his presence. After all, he resembled the lord of the heaven and earth. The myriad dao were within his palm.

“Enveloping Monarch!” An old demon recognized him right away.

Others became emotional right away and shouted his title as well. He was the strongest monarch in Three Thousand Dao, being nearly as strong as Dao Sanqian. The other five together couldn’t beat him.

He walked shoulder to shoulder with Dao Sanqian and addressed him as “brother”. Few had this honor.

He originally came from Bones and was once its supreme genius. He competed against Dao Sanqian and was considered a favorite to become the dao lord of that generation.

Against all expectations, he actually became Dao Sanqian’s sworn brother and left Bones to join Three Thousand Dao.

“Enveloping Monarch is finally here!” A big shot under Three Thousand Dao became ecstatic.
