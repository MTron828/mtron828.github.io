Chapter 5487: Death Of The Emperors, Birth Of The Souls

The immortal continent remained intact compared to the other five, hence its name. Due to its fortunate state after the grand calamity, the spirit energy and resources here remained ample.

Thus, cultivators here had a clear advantage compared to those in the lower realms. Nonetheless, the rules here were rather strict. Because of this, powerful cultivators preferred to stay in the upper continents instead.

Three major powers divided the continent - Celestial Court, Immortal Dao City, and Imperial Field.

Celestial Court was the oldest, praised to have existed during the start of this world. The size of its territories was unimaginable. Some said that it was larger than all six continents combined.

Because of their resources and prestigious past, many top cultivators chose it as their home. Its influence also started the divide between The Race and The People. This remained active even in the present day.

Public opinions were polarizing. Some blamed Celestial Court for sowing the seeds of discord in the six continents. However, its supporters hailed them as stalwart defenders.

Immortal Dao City and Imperial Field were far younger in comparison. The former was considered the older of the two since the heavenly treasure appeared during Skysplitter War.

Purewood Divine Emperor, Immortal Emperor Fei Yang, and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan established a new order capable of contending against Celestial Court.

As for Imperial Field, it appeared after Grand Dao War. The empress and her allies combined their power to deal with the darkness.

Some believed that Imperial Field was around way before that, tracing back to the previous epoch. It simply kept a low profile and never participated in the previous wars. This theory perplexed others because why would they stay out of these existential crises?

An explanation was that they were merely training their elites and forming the right formation arrays in preparation for the most frightening war - Grand Dao.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Sure enough, they eventually took down the darkness. Would they have been able to do so without ample preparation and accumulation?

The casualties were immense for the emperors and monarchs. The number ranged similarly to that of Immemorial Epoch War.

Immemorial Epoch, Skysplitter, and Grand Dao left behind numerous battlefields in the upper continents.

Timeline and spatial fabrics shattered, resulting in perilous black holes. The immortal continent only managed to survive these wars due to its fortune after the grand calamity. Any other continent would have been reduced to ashes long ago.

“Boom!” A massive snail landed on the immortal continent.

“Your daddy’s back, Immortal Continent!” Niu Fen laughed after arriving.

He became carefree after taking the role of Li Qiye’s mount, no longer needing to put up a dignified act. Despite his unwillingness, he still had to act properly as a dao lord. Now, he could finally say whatever he wanted to. After all, Li Qiye could deal with anything.

Li Qiye scanned the area and took a deep breath.

“The energy here is so dense.” Niu Fen breathed in as well and said sentimentally: “That’s why it survived so many wars. However, the battle intents are still raging.”

“The death of emperors means the birth of numerous souls.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement.

“You should have seen it, corpses rained from the sky. We had a hard time gathering them for a proper burial.” Niu Fen murmured.

Li Qiye sighed and glanced in a particular direction.

Niu Fen followed his gaze and asked with excitement: “Young Master, shall we destroy Celestial Court right now?”

“In due time, just not right now. We need to warm up first to get more players involved.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“Haha, I see, have to kill them in one go, getting rid of all those treacherous geezers.” Niu Fen understood the plan and resembled a hoodlum pulling up his sleeves, eager for a fight.

“As for now, we’ll be gathering remains and free the souls.” Li Qiye said.

“Only you can do it, Young Master. We can’t even if we try for a lifetime.” Niu Fen said softly.

Li Qiye nodded in agreement. The three wars resulted in countless deaths. The fallen combatants’ lost souls still roamed the battlefields.

Crossing them over to the other side was easier said than done. Attempting to do so meant incurring karmic consequences. However, Li Qiye was in control of this world and could personally make the souls agree to move on.

He glanced at a particular battlefield and noticed a particular aura - something rather indescribable. Niu Fen noticed it too and said: “Is that where we’ll start?”

“Let’s go take a look.” Li Qiye tapped its shell.

“I’m afraid I can’t go there…” Niu Fen hesitated.

“A place that you don’t dare to go? Where did your courage run off to?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh.
