Chapter 3815: Torrential Momentum

The division of the sword felt like a division of the world. This magical feeling permeated the land.

The white sword represented god, the black represented devil, and their fusion represented the overarching momentum of all things.

The middle sword contained majestic life force and other living beings. Some eventually proved their dao and became gods; others chose the path of the devils. This momentum of life continued in an endless manner.

This flow had nothing to do with judgment nor murderous intention. The flow would always continue regardless of one’s wishes. Living beings had zero control over this flow across the river of time.

As more eras passed, they became a part of the greater momentum. Meanwhile, there were plenty of elite and talented cultivators being born. Each era had its own supreme; each race gave birth to wondrous existences...

Myriad Men was the name of the third technique in Trinity. The three swords derived incredible existences - invincible dao lords and emperors of the ancient eras, the great primordial beasts...

Ultimately, this form contained the momentum and power of an epoch - the essences of the living beings and the culmination of their enlightenment before death. Thus, the sword was the embodiment of perfection.

Even godfiends were part of this continuous flow. Thus, the seven crow gods were nothing more than several drops of water in a boundless ocean.

Their slashes made contact with the momentum and were immediately drowned out. This was akin to seven swimmers being caught by a tsunami. They could only wave their hands helplessly several times before losing.

Everyone gasped as they watched the slashes being nullified by Dugu Lan’s momentum.

The combination attack was immaculate. The ancestors here thought that they wouldn’t be able to stop it. That’s why the crowd worried for Dugu Lan.

No one expected the third technique of Trinity Sword Art to be so effective. Meanwhile, the momentum continued to flow without a specific goal.

It was nothing more than a non-sentient current, always existing within heaven and earth. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Epochs started changing; worlds were destroyed. This didn’t hinder the flow of this momentum; it eventually engulfed Righteous Scion in his god form as well.

All living beings seemed insignificant before this unstoppable phenomenon. They lived within the momentum and wouldn’t be harmed by it. Nonetheless, certain things would happen during this process. For example, sickness, destitution, violent death...

No one noticed the flow and even if they did, changes would occur anyway. Thus, the inevitable nature of this technique horrified the spectators.

“Can Righteous Scion handle this?” One expert murmured.

“I don’t know, if he can’t beat this, he’ll be reduced to specks of dust.” An ancestor responded.

“Well, all of us will become specks of dust eventually.” A mighty sacred ancestor became emotional.

“That’s why we need to prove our dao and become a dao lord. Otherwise, back to the earth.” The previous ancestor answered.

“Trinity Sword Art is insane...” One genius calmed down and commented.

The scion had the advantage in terms of cultivation yet Trinity Sword Art still dominated him. The fact that he could last to the third technique was impressive enough. Others would have been dead after the first exchange.

“This is a supreme sword art left behind by the most dreadful emperor, it has to be this strong.” An elderly ancestor said solemnly.

“Which Immortal Emperor?” One expert thought that since this emperor was able to create such a powerful technique, some records should be left behind.

“I can’t say. It’s a forbidden subject.” The ancestor really wanted to speak on this interesting topic but ultimately refrained.

The listeners exchanged glances after hearing this.

“Boom!” A loud explosion caused violent quakes and interrupted their conversation.

A light suddenly flashed within the great momentum, akin to the explosion of three thousand worlds. The rays tried to stop the flow but this was futile.

Next, twelve palaces flew out and created a path for the scion’s true fate to leap upward. With this, he was able to escape the physical restraints of world borders and the five elements.

“So risky.” Many ancestors gasped after seeing this.

In order to leave the momentum, the scion utilized and separated his true fate from the body. This was dangerous because, in the case of failure, he would lose both.

This gamble was worth it because once he got out of the momentum, he summoned Heavenseize. His grand dao manifested again and empowered him.

“Boom!” The true fate exuded the brightest radiance, allowing the spear to use its strongest attack. The scion gave everything he had for this ultimate blow.

The myriad dao along the trajectory crumbled with haste. Unfortunately for the spectators, the sheer shockwaves made them vomit blood.

Dugu Lan faced the brunt of the attack with her three swords. All three were sent flying so the momentum suddenly dispersed. The world regained its initial form.

“Bam!” She slammed into the ground and struggled to get up. Once she made it up, she vomited a mouthful of blood.

“Fairy Dugu!” The crowd was shocked. Those who admired her screamed loudly while being stricken with anxiety.

Meanwhile, Righteous Scion’s true fate returned to his body. He floated in the air while wielding Heavenseize.

A hush fell over the battlefield. The spectators couldn’t regain their composure.
