Chapter 5003: Who Am I?

At first glance, he seemed like a scared child hiding in a safe spot. But given his bored expression, he was more like a python that was full from a meal. Now it was time to digest.

He pulsed with the maddened flames - the result of devouring Elemental King’s attacks. He seemed rather bored as he occasionally tossed rocks into the pit.

He was a puzzling existence, possessing all the abilities and instincts of a dragon lord yet lacking a normal state of mind.

Li Qiye approached and sat down next to him. The others stood behind Li Qiye, not daring to utter a single word. They saw him as a slow-witted child more so than a member of the Ten Monsters.

He didn’t run away this time. There was not a single reaction either. The group patiently waited, aware that Li Qiye was interested in him.

After a while, the boy seemingly woke up from his stupor. Nonetheless, his eyes were still muddled as he asked with curiosity: “Who are you?”

“Who are you?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I am me…” The boy answered.

“I am me too.” Li Qiye said. 

“Then who am I?” The boy was caught up in the questions.

“You are you, and only you.” Li Qiye answered.

This only confused him even more as he tried to come up with an answer. Alas, there was a minute change in his muddled eyes - the chaos seemed to be flowing, albeit virtually indiscernible.

“I don’t know me.” He eventually said.

“Ask your heart.” Li Qiye replied.

“What is heart?” The boy asked.

“The heart is right here.” Li Qiye grabbed his hand and placed it on his left chest: “Feel it.”

After a few seconds, the boy giggled and said: “Something’s beating.”

“Feel it, feel its beats.” Li Qiye led the way for him to feel the rhythm: “Badump, badump, badump…”

“Badump, badump, badump…” Flame-eater followed his lead.

As he felt the beat, he closed his eyes as if he was about to sleep. Drooling came next and made him look more like the slow son of the regional lord, one step further away from the appearance of a dragon lord.

Li Qiye smiled and observed the youth.

“Young Noble, is it working?” Yunyun could tell that this was some sort of mesmerization.

“It is up to him.” Li Qiye said: “He forgot himself or does not want to remember.”

“Huh? Why not?” Ming Shi asked.

“Life is cruel.” Li Qiye said: “Sometimes it is better to forget instead of living in misery.”

“He had a sad past?” She stared at him and couldn’t come up with the right scenario for him to purposely do this.

“Not necessarily.” Li Qiye responded: “There might be another reason.”

“Is there a difference in forgetting oneself versus actively trying to do so?” Goldcrest asked.

“The second is an avoidance mechanism for pain. The first case can be more complicated, it might be an injury or something else.” Li Qiye said.

“Do you have a guess as to why, Young Noble?” Yunyun said curiously.

Li Qiye gazed into the horizon and took his time before responding: “A few existences, once they reach a certain cultivation level, might want to forget themselves.”

The group exchanged glances of confusion.

Li Qiye then looked back at them and continued: “Some have heavy burdens and responsibilities, others can no longer restraint their dao heart or power. After all, there is a price for everything, especially for power.”

“One of the prices is loneliness. There is no one else at the top.” Yunyun said.

“Indeed, you got that right.” Li Qiye praised with a smile.

“You’re too kind, Young Noble.” She responded with a slightly embarrassed tone.

“Amitabha, amitabha.” A chant could be heard and next came a billowing Buddhist affinity.

A monk appeared before the group - one looking rather casual and carefree. However, everything about him exuded Buddhism.

It was Mahayana again - the highly respected monk.

The young ones were surprised to see him. Nonetheless, they bowed to greet him. This included the vivacious princess.

“Benefactor, seems like we are connected by fate.” The monk placed his palms together and told Li Qiye.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t want to have anything to do with a monk, nothing good comes out of it.” Li Qiye smiled and went over to a pond nearby, took off his shoes, and played with the water.

“Amitabha. Only those truly connected to Buddhism say your line, they are bound by karma without knowing so.” The monk smiled before taking off his shoes and joining Li Qiye to enjoy the water.

“Let me try to enlighten you so that you can reach the dao of Buddhism?” The monk didn’t give up.

Li Qiye finally stared at the monk and smiled charmingly, wanting to enlighten him instead.

“Buzz.” The monk became shrouded by the image of a heavenly dragon with eight legs. Others couldn’t help wanting to prostrate before his magnificent aura.

It took everything from him to stop Li Qiye’s smile.

“Amitabha.” He lowered his head, not daring to stare at Li Qiye.

This person’s smile had a devilish power far beyond his current Buddhist attainment. He would be the one converted instead.

“This avatar of yours can’t convert me.” Li Qiye stopped and shook his head.

This surprised the youths and made them stare at the monk. He was only an avatar?

The dragon lords prior didn’t notice anything and assumed that he was the real thing. This meant that he wasn’t actually here.

“Amitabha, you are correct, Benefactor.” The monk admitted while placing his palms together.
