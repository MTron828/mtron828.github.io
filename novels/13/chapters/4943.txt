Chapter 4944: Schoolmaster

The schoolmaster was also an amazing dragon lord with four sacred fruits. Alas, he rarely left the academy or fought anyone. This hindered his reputation; others didn’t fear him the same way they did other dragon lords.

In fact, most haven’t heard of him defeating anyone. If he wasn’t the schoolmaster of the academy, everyone would forget bout him.

For eras now, students came and went but he remained the schoolmaster. Their impression was that he was humble and reserved - nothing more.

“My Lord, please excuse our conduct.” Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord bowed after seeing him.

Even the arrogant Bloodsea bowed toward the schoolmaster. In fact, he had enjoyed the same level of respect from Conceal Conqueror and Eight-stallion Dao Lord, not to mention the countless masters in the past.

The schoolmaster sighed and said: “This is a place of learning, do not quarrel here. Please return.”

He always spoke with a tranquil and even-tempered tone regardless of circumstances.

Arrow Saint and Reincarnation exchanged glances. They were put in a tough position.

Though the schoolmaster wasn’t known for his fighting prowess, his seniority far exceeded theirs. They were mere students in comparison.

“We do not wish to offend the academy, it’s just that one student has stolen Deity’s Benevolence. We are trying to get it back.” Arrow Saint said.

“Yes, the academy is a place of learning, letting thieves stay here will ruin its reputation. Schoolmaster, please hand him over to us and we will sincerely apologize another day.” Reincarnation said.

Students held their breath while awaiting the schoolmaster’s answer. Bai Shaojin was only an ordinary student from Abroad, not Hundred or Study Hall. Thus, he had nothing to do with the academy.

In a regular sect, he wouldn’t even be considered an external disciple. They would never risk offending another great power for his sake.

The students didn’t have a problem with this because they weren’t close to him. The academy didn’t need to protect such a person, and a potential thief at that.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Students are students, not thieves. Abroad accept everyone who wishes to learn, we do not discriminate and while they are here, they have only one status - students of the academy.” The schoolmaster shook his head.

This moved the listeners, especially students from smaller sects or who had an unsavory background. The academy was the only place in the lower continents that didn’t hate them because of their background.

Arrow Saint and Reincarnation couldn’t respond because this has been the case for eras now - the reason why top masters respected the academy.

It never violated this creed. The perfect example was allowing those from The Race to come and learn here. In fact, some of its alumni from The Race have achieved incredible things due to their time here.

The schoolmaster continued, his expression serious: "As far as I’m aware, Benevolence has no connection to Deity. It was created by Immortal Emperor Min Ren and after the defeat of the Immemorial Palace, Feather Immortal Monarch put all of its resources into it. However, the artifact disappeared without a trace afterward. Thus, if one must bring up relationships, it is connected to the hundred races, especially human. As for logic and reason, people do say that treasures belong to the virtuous or the fateful, no?”

“I didn’t steal it from Deity, I excavated it from an ancient battlefield!” Bai Shaojin jumped in.

Students looked around and agreed that if the schoolmaster was right, this treasure certainly didn’t belong to Deity.

“They’re so imperious, claiming something that isn’t theirs.” One student whispered.

“It should belong to us, humans.” One human student said.

Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord had no response after hearing the vessel’s origin.

“You are mistaken!” Someone appeared above the academy and roared.

With a mighty explosion, a powerful demonic energy enveloped the area, as if a massive beast had descended from the sky. The energy exuded a fearsome aura, causing onlookers to tremble with fear as if they were mortals standing face-to-face with a lion ready to devour its prey.

They saw an old man with golden hair flowing freely, like the mane of a lion. He radiated regal power like a king among beasts. This was a lion demon, feared and revered.

“Stone Lion God!” Many turned pale and shouted for he had four sacred fruits.

He originated from the Ten Mountains of Demon. However, it never picked up a deity spot and later on, it somehow joined Immortal Pagoda as an ancestor instead.

Despite not being one of the Ten Monsters, the lion demon was notorious for his wicked deeds. The most infamous of which was the consumption of an entire kingdom.

The students trembled in fear, their sweat drenching them as they imagined the horrors that the kingdom must have suffered. They hoped they would not share the same fate.
