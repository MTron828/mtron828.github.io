The duo planned many things in their secret meeting place. They discussed the unseen tales relating to the emperors, the important ones with ten wills and up. The low-level ones weren’t qualified to be part of their conversation. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The content would shock the entire thirteen continents since it involved the great characters from the previous generations. They also talked about the current state of these emperors and their recent movements.

For example, which one was creating a supreme weapon? Another was wanting to sneak into an ominous ground? A different one wanting a rebirth?

“The top emperors must make their stance clear.” Li Qiye said solemnly.

“I agree.” The person became serious as well.

In the contemporary, the thirteen continents only had four surviving emperors with twelve wills - Purewood Divine Emperor, World Emperor, Profound Emperor, and Immortal Monarch Yi Ye.

Purewood was a dragon whose tail couldn’t be seen. He has always been elusive; everything about him remained shrouded with mysteries.

As for World Emperor, he has been the dark crow’s rival for generations. Many emperors were aware of this life-long rivalry.

“It might not be that easy.” The person said slowly: “After Crimson Emperor got rid of one will, it’s virtually impossible to find him now. Won’t be easy to figure out his stance.”

One more person should be included when talking about top emperors. Crimson Emperor was the sixth Grand Emperor with twelve wills. He was from the Devil Race and took the title of Crimson in order to honor Flame Emperor.

For some unknown reasons, he decided to remove one will and became an eleven-will emperor. Nevertheless, people remained prudent when dealing with him, not only because he once had twelve wills but also due to his frightening Bestowment bloodline!

Bestowment was the Devil Race’s immortal blood. The combination of having eleven wills and this bloodline allowed him to become a dreadful existence, feared by other emperors.

Moreover, there was a rumor stating that he had inherited the True Immortal Armament of Flame Emperor!

Flame Emperor was the third to have twelve wills. He was also from the Devil Race and had one of the five True Immortal Armaments once. Unfortunately, his life ended due to the Heavenly Execution! His armament became missing from then on.

It wasn’t until the emergence of Crimson Emperor did there were rumors of him possessing Flame Emperor’s old armament.

Just imagine, his personal power combined with a True Immortal Armament? The world believed he was still on the same level with the other twelve-will emperors. He was a unique eleven-will emperor in this regard. No one would dare to question his capabilities since he had twelve wills once in the first place.

“Yes, Crimson Emperor has been very elusive.” Li Qiye nodded: “Don’t worry, I’ll find him. If he truly wants to walk the path of Flame Emperor, he’ll know the right choice to make.”

“Not sure about Profound Emperor.” The person said: “His attitude is very unclear about the future and even towards his own Divine Race and the others. It’s not as clear as Heaven Authority so I’m quite wary about him.”

Heaven Authority was an organization of Grand Emperors led by World Emperor. Their stance was very clear - to support and prosper the Heaven Race.

Li Qiye said: “It is a bit dangerous. Twelve-will emperors are always being watched attentively. Both we and the enemies want them on our side. If Profound Emperor won’t make a choice, then we must kill him. It’s a double-edged knife, able of stabbing the enemy’s weak spot but also ours!”

These top emperors had immense destructive power and could change the overall situation quite a bit once they took action. Thus, they were an important topic in this conversation.

“That’s true. We might need to be more forceful because if he were to backstab us when the darkness comes, it’ll incite chaos. More prudence is required.” The person said.

“Yes, we’re actually quite good on the Ancient Gods’ front right now, just need to worry about Profound Emperor.” Li Qiye commended.

“I’ll be watching each of his actions.” The person said: “As for Immortal Monarch Yi Ye, no need for me to waste time. I’m sure you know the monarch’s stance the best.”

“I can make a decision for Yi Ye.” Li Qiye nodded: “So right now, keep a tight eye on Profound Emperor. If he were to show any sign of joining the enemy, focus all of our firepower to annihilate him! It’ll be much more problematic, letting him have a chance when the war breaks out.”

“So be it.” The person nodded.

They were planning the most shocking battle in this world, relating to the old origin of this epoch. Victory was a necessity, and not a barely-won one either. They must completely dominate in the future or they would be powerless to start an ultimate expedition in the future!

After numerous discussions, the person finally half-jokingly said: “Though you are quite heaven-defying and borderline being invincible, it’s easy to dodge the spear in the open, hard to avoid a stab in the dark. You need to create an unsurpassable defensive artifact. If someone in the shadows wants to ambush you, ordinary weapons won’t do. But who knows if they have a Paragon Artifact? Even if you could survive, the injuries will still be grievous. At that point, all the emperors might laugh at you - the teacher of Immortal Emperor, for all of his calculating prowess, still got played by someone.”

Despite the playful tone, there was still a hint of truth. They were aware of the enemies’ capabilities.

“Perhaps it’s the right time to create a Paragon Artifact then.” Li Qiye chuckled while slightly shifting his gaze.

“If possible, a True Immortal Armament will do too.” The person said seriously.

To which Li Qiye responded: “Now might not be the time, but that’s also another possibility. Back then, Min Ren wanted to leave behind his but I refused. We’ll talk about this later, if all the conditions are right, the monarch’s set can work too.”

There were a total of five immortal armaments in the world. Purewood Divine Emperor, World Emperor, and Crimson Emperor all had one. Meanwhile, Immortal Emperor Min Ren took his to the ultimate expedition.

The last one belonged to the Six Dao Monarch but it went missing after his death to the Heavenly Execution. Many emperors have searched for it before. After all, possessing one would be an immense boost in power. Alas, despite their effort, the set’s location remained a mystery.

The person nodded: “Six Dao Monarch’s set, hmm? We can give that a try. If all options are exhausted later, we’ll make the decision then.”

“Isn’t this trip to Remote Wildland an experiment too?” Li Qiye said with a smile: “It doesn’t have to be a True Immortal Armament, the wildland has some good stuff that isn’t inferior. We’ll see if fortune is on my side this time around.”

The two continued on for a bit before hitting the next topic.

“It would be great if we can find Jiao Heng’s group for this war.” The person said: “Since we need to be decisive and end the war as fast as possible, with the help of Jiao Heng’s group and our own forces right now, we’ll have about a ninety percent chance of victory.”

Li Qiye replied: “It’s been a long time so that’s hard to say but I’m more excited about Geezer Purewood. That old man is more wily than a demon. He’ll be the one to do what no one else can. Anyway, I still have hopes that a new twelve-will emperor will come out in this generation.”

“Someone you brought here?” The person’s eyes became serious.

“Who knows? Maybe someone from the thirteen continents too.” Li Qiye said.

The person disagreed: “Unlikely. Ren Sheng and Jin Ge were good candidates but they have given up one chance. But even if a twelve-will emperor were to come out, they would be too inexperienced and unpredictable, unable to resist all the temptations. You know, since that time is coming, the other side is prone to take actions too. It won’t be good if this new emperor joins the other side.”

“That’s why we need to be able to control who will become the next twelve-will emperor. If we can’t, then we won’t allow for one to appear!” Li Qiye concluded.
