Chapter 4704: The Pride Of A Dao Lord’s Son

An alliance between True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, and Eastern Desolace could very well start today.

If they were to go all out, world conquest would certainly be possible. With all ace cards revealed, they would then knock out Li Qiye and the other two conquerors. From then on, one of them would become the eventual winner - whoever had the most fortune.

Therefore, this alliance was obviously a good thing, locking the potential dao lord down to only three candidates.

“Brother, I require time to think about this suggestion.” Five-sun King smiled and didn’t give a clear answer.

Shen Juntian chuckled; even men would become awestruck by his wondrous smile: “I can’t wait to experience Li Qiye’s peerless skill.”

He didn’t give a concrete answer either, prompting the other two to glance at each other.

“His power is frightening indeed. In my opinion, a direct fight is unwise, it’s best to use a different strategy.” Five-sun King chose his words in order not to offend Shen Juntian. Everyone should know at this point that fighting Li Qiye alone was suicidal. Shen Juntian was no exception.

“I’m aware.” Shen Juntian smiled and nodded: “I will be killed and it will not be close. However, a capable opponent is already rare, let alone such a mysterious and supreme cultivator. I am overwhelmed with curiosity.”

He paused for a second before continuing: “My blood is boiling as well. Missing this chance might leave me with regrets for the rest of my life.”

Though he spoke elegantly, one could hear his blood rushing faster and hotter.

The young emperor and Five-sun King empathized with this train of thought. During their dao journey, they had also met powerful opponents that make their blood boil with excitement.

Alas, Li Qiye was simply too devilish. They could think about fighting ancient ancestors since they had a good analysis of power. Unfortunately, Li Qiye was unfathomable and ominous, hence the young emperor’s invitation.

“I wish to see how much dao lord power he can withstand.” He went on with a voice as smooth as honey, akin to a good friend whispering fortuitous news.

However, the two trembled since they understood the implication. This person could unleash a strike awfully similar to his father’s own attack. Both found this dreadful.

“Brother, please reconsider.” The young emperor said: “The dao path requires both brawn and brains. I’m sure you will come up with a wiser plan.”

He naturally wanted Shen Juntian to join their alliance along with the behemoth, Three Thousand Dao.

Of course, from another angle, he also wanted to see Shen Juntian fight Li Qiye. His dao lord attack might force Li Qiye to show his true power - a perfect chance for more scouting and strategizing.

“The dao path is truly unpredictable, no one knows who will fall first.” Shen Juntian’s smile could encaptivate and make girls go crazy. There was something about him that put him above other supreme geniuses. He didn’t let his father down, whether it be his appearance or temperament.

Li Qiye’s group traveled deep into the Primordial Union. They eventually stopped in front of a peak and Li Qiye smiled: “Right here.”

“Here?” Jian Ming became excited.

Li Qiye nodded and looked around, capturing everything within his eyes.

“Did the emperor nest here?” Jian Ming looked around and didn’t see anyone. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“He doesn’t have the energy to protect himself, let alone nest.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m sure he’s grievously wounded.” The daoist said.

After all, he was under siege by the behemoths’ ancient ancestors. The fact that he was still alive spoke plenty about his power.

“His main injury has nothing to do with the enemies. It is the price of using the immortal gemstone. He thought too highly of himself and although it made him strong enough to survive the battle, he’s feeling it now.” Li Qiye said.

“So he did figure out how to use it.” Jian Ming said.

“Not quite.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Only the bare surface because true mastery wouldn’t have put him in this predicament. He would have met gods, killed gods, met Buddhas, killed Buddhas. Nonetheless, just the bare surface power was enough to both save him from the enemies while forcing him to pay the price.”

The duo understood why the emperor eventually ran away. He borrowed enough power to survive but not enough to slay the ancient ancestors from the alliance. The backlash was too much for him to endure as well.

Li Qiye finished scanning and looked up the midway infested by long vines.

“Alright, show yourself.” Li Qiye said.

Alas, nothing answered him. The duo used their divine intent but they didn’t notice anyone either.

“I suppose I have to invite you out then.” Li Qiye waved his hand and swept away the vines, revealing the cave afterward. His attack also seemed to be hitting an invisible barrier and was nullified.

The two finally saw a person hiding there - Golden Fist Emperor. Vines growing from the peak coiled around him like tentacles, seemingly wanting to pierce his body. He looked feeble and pale, unlike his dominating self. Parts of his body have been turned into stone by an unknown force.
