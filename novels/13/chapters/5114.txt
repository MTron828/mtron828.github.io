Chapter 5115: It Is You

“Boom!” Three temporal beams rushed down and struck the three conquerors, forcing them down to the ground.

The armor plates that gave them immense power earlier became their prison. Though they mustered all of their strength, they couldn’t break free in such a short time.

Now, they were assaulted with the power of time - thousands and thousands of years flowing by in seconds.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Chrono Disk!” A dragon lord from Reincarnation took a deep breath.[1]

This was a legendary treasure capable of suppressing imperial and conquerors’ weapons. However, the members of Reincarnation never got to see it. Some believed that Blazing Conqueror had taken it with him.

This was similar to the weapon of an epoch lord. Now, it was fused with the power of an epoch while possessing the temporal affinity.

“Ahh!” The three conquerors bellowed in pain. As time passed, the temporal beams began to absorb their blood and dao power.

“What are you doing?!” Ascension couldn’t believe that there was a conqueror capable of doing such heinous deeds.

“Isn’t it obvious? I’m just borrowing your dao fruits so that I can get twelve. Oh, and your vitality too so that I can live longer.” Greenmountain said calmly.

Listeners were scared out of their mind after hearing this. In the history of the six continents, killing happened all the time between conquerors and emperors.

However, they haven’t heard of a conqueror eating dao fruits and absorbing vitality. This was forbidden for good reasons yet they were witnessing it today.

“It’s him!” Thousand-faced Sovereign and Truth Conqueror exchange glances. They understood that he was the culprit for all the missing cultivators.

“The six continents will not allow you to do this!” Six-pot bellowed.

“So what? Once I possess twelve dao fruits, I will be unstoppable. No one up there will know and even if they do, they will only send down more food for me. This is my pasture now, once I eat enough conquerors, I will become immortal, the lord of this epoch.” Greenmountain smiled.

“You!” Ascension couldn’t believe that this was actually happening.

“Don’t be surprised, this happened all the time during the ancient epochs. I came across a scroll depicting all of this, it is the origin of our Reincarnation Lineage. No epoch can escape this fate, I am merely accelerating the inevitable.” Greenmountain elaborated.

The communication lines between the continents weren’t so clear. If these conquerors were to be eaten, no one could ascend again.

It would be too late once the upper continents realize that there was something wrong. Greenmountain would be too strong then; both The Race and The People would become his food.

He also had all the advantages and descending conquerors might not be strong enough to beat him.

Thus, everyone fell into despair. This was hopeless for their continents.

“It was really you!” A furious voice sounded.

Everyone looked over and saw an old man in a black robe. He coughed every time he spoke.

“Uncle Xiang!” Those from Eight-stallion recognized him.

“Hahaha, Phenomena, so you’re still alive. How unexpected for you to survive that attack.” Greenmountain was surprised for a moment before laughing.

“Phenomena Conqueror!” After taking a closer look, a few big shots recognized the old man. [2]

“Phenomena?!” Eight-stallion’s members couldn’t believe it. The watcher of the cemetery was the famous conqueror?

“It’s you who killed Divine Empress Dowager and the others!” Phenomena shouted.

“That’s right.” Greenmountain had no need to hide it: “Phenomena, oh Phenomena, the number one genius. You actually figured out the mysteries of the ancient epoch during our fight and spouted those bullshit. I actually believed you and nearly suffered qi deviation but I suppose I do need to thank you. Your bullshit actually helped me understand the remnant epoch left behind by Blazing Conqueror, hahaha!”

The crowd became creeped out and recalled the disappearance of certain dragon lords ten thousand years ago.

After absorbing these dragon lords, his ambition grew and he targeted Phenomena Conqueror. He highly valued the dao fruits and vitality of this genius. He baited the conqueror into a trap and ambushed him.

Phenomena who was facing the brink of death saw through Greenmountain’s cultivation and commented on its flaws. This made Greenmountain question the devouring process and changed it, nearly resulting in qi deviation.

Phenomena took advantage of this and fled, albeit still being struck by a fatal blow. Greenmountain was sure that the conqueror wouldn’t live for long.

After escaping successfully, Phenomena went into hiding. He had no solid proof that the assailant was Greenmountain and waited for the right time to show up again.

1. I translated this as the Wheel of Time in recent chapters, I finally found the original translation - Chrono Disk. Changing them all to Chrono Disk. This was Samsara Ancestor’s epoch artifact ☜

2. Phenomena has the character Xiang, Wan Xiang ☜
