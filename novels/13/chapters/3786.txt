Chapter 3787: Menacing

The cavalry instantly surrounded the area and created an impregnable iron wall. Their formation was impeccable; their movement immaculate.

The training necessary to have such great teamwork impressed the crowd. However, a murderous atmosphere took over. The soldiers’ spears gleamed brightly in a chill-inducing fashion.

The tips clearly have tasted blood numerous times in battles. This cavalry looked like the bringer of death.

“War Camp.” Everyone understood that this group was part of War Camp. Just these elites could absolutely take down another army.

“The third prince.” Someone else murmured after seeing the commander.

The third prince rode in front and had full armor on, looking gallant and heroic just like an experienced general.

Both his appearance and aura were impressive, always garnering a good first impression from others. On the other hand, the crown prince seemed lacking in comparison.

This was the reason why he had numerous supporters in Vajra. They thought that a talent like him would have a bright future, able to lead Vajra to greatness.

“Li Qiye, do you know what you have done?!” The group surrounded Li Qiye and the prince shouted.

The crowd thought that Vajra Dynasty was finally taking action. Was the prince representing Vajra?

“You wish to play?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Taking the ancestral statue and colluding with the enemy, one crime after another, all are unforgivable! Your clan shall be exterminated!” The prince coldly uttered. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Some found this surprising. One of them murmured: “The third prince is in charge of Vajra now? Do the ancestors support him?”

In terms of status, Li Qiye was above the third prince. The latter should never do something like this without the support from Ancestral Temple.

“Do you think you are qualified to carry out the punishment?” Li Qiye smiled.

The prince turned red. A royal member like him has always been held in high regard. Moreover, his prestige was considerable since he had the court’s support.

Nonetheless, Li Qiye was indeed above him right now. This was truly frustrating.

“Ah, he still doesn’t have dominion yet.” The spectating experts understood right away.

It seemed that Li Qiye was indeed a traitor. However, the prince lacked the authority to question and accuse Li Qiye.

“Since you’re Vajra’s saber messenger, the dynasty needs to maintain order by punishing you. I shall take up this responsibility!” The prince roared, wanting to find a perfect reason to eliminate Li Qiye for the sake of his future.

Li Qiye had done something unforgivable and unsalvageable. Those who back him up would be dragged down too. Thus, the prince didn’t want to miss this godsend opportunity.

“Okay, okay, you alone or the entire cavalry?” Li Qiye tapped the saber hanging by his waist, looking very amused.

The soldiers’ expression froze after seeing this. The third prince ordered them to come but ultimately, they still needed to obey Vajra before any single person.

Without Ancestral Temple’s permission, they couldn’t do anything to Li Qiye regardless of his heinous conduct. This was the privilege of being the saber messenger.

The third prince looked embarrassed. He alone had no confidence in capturing Li Qiye and knew that the cavalry might not listen to his order.

“Li, how do you still have the audacity to keep that saber? You have betrayed us all, the reputation of Vajra is tainted because of you!” The prince bellowed: “If you have any hint of dignity and self-respect left, relinquish your status as the saber messenger and take us on!”

His only option was to taunt Li Qiye so that the guy would actively remove his status. That’s the only thing holding him back.

“You make it sound as if I care about this position. Very well, no more.” Li Qiye smirked and casually tossed the saber onto the ground.

His choice astounded the spectators. Being the saber messenger in Vajra was a big deal. Even the king needed to treat him with respect.

Anyone would cherish this status yet Li Qiye gave it up without a second thought.

They exchanged glances, thinking that the whole thing was confusing. This Li Qiye was amazing, to be able to treat authority like trash.

The prince himself became frozen since he had zero confidence in his psychological taunt earlier. Nonetheless, he still needed to try.

It was obvious that only a fool would fall for his trick. Alas, Li Qiye actually jumped right into the pit. He had no idea that it would be so easy.

After a while, he regained his wits and became ecstatic. It would be too easy to deal with Li Qiye now.

“Li, you have thrown away the saber and are no longer the saber messen...” The prince shouted.

“Just a crappy blade to chop wood, not worth a single coin.” Li Qiye interrupted, causing the crowd to have a wry smile on their face.

“No, absolutely not!” A newcomer suddenly arrived and hurriedly stopped their conversation.

“Young Master, you are the embodiment of nobility and prestige.” The person picked up the saber and hung it back on Li Qiye’s waist: “Please don’t be angry over this trivial matter. You’ll always be the saber messenger of Vajra no matter what.”

“National Teacher?” The crowd became startled again.

The newcomer was none other than Ye Mingshi serving as the imperial teacher.

Just his appearance alone was surprising since he rarely showed himself without official business.

“National Teacher.” The prince didn’t appreciate his nearly-fulfilled plan being ruined. Nonetheless, he didn’t dare to become angry: “He chose to abandon this status on his own accord. Moreover, a disrespectful traitor like him doesn’t deserve to be the messenger.”

“Third Prince! Heed the decree of the king!” Ye Mingshi spoke loudly with a serious expression.
