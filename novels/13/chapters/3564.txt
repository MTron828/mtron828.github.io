Chapter 3565: Mist Sealing Eight Firmaments

The group attracted everyone’s attention. The mist of blood kept pulsing on and off around them. They seemed to be on the verge of disappearing at any moment just from a gust of wind. All in all, they had an ethereal characteristic.

“Nightwalkers...” The crowd focused on the leader.

The majority of the group was old at the sacred level. They were either elders or something higher. However, a youth was still leading them.

The blood mist around him wasn’t as concentrated as the old men’s. Thus, his cultivation might be weaker.

The most interesting thing about him was his eyes. There seemed to be a red light pulsing deep within them, capable of turning into a blood wheel. It gave everyone a strange feeling.

“Is he a disciple of Eight-tribulation Blood King?” A youth became startled after hearing about the Nightwalkers. [1]

People would always think of the blood king when this race was brought up because he was one of the four grandmasters.

The four beings were top existences in the south, only behind the two great supremes.

“No, not a direct disciple but still from a side branch.” A powerful cultivator said: “Zhui Xueyun, the junior brother of Phantom Sacred Child.”

“Ah, no wonder why he’s leading such a group. Looks like he’s capable enough to rule his own domain.” Someone had no idea of Zhui Xueyun but has heard of Phantom Sacred Child before.

Phantom was one of the top talents in Buddha Holy Ground. He was the direct disciple of Eight-tribulation Blood King, famous alongside Golden Cicada and Dugu Lan.

Some thought that he would be able to unite the Divine Ghost Tribe and compete for authority over the holy land. Thus, being the junior brother of this sacred child was a big deal.

“He is more than just his relation to the sacred child. Just a member of a side branch isn’t enough. The real reason is due to his unique eyes, the blood eyes of the Nightwalkers. It’s quite powerful.” Someone in the know revealed.

Zhui Xueyun’s eyes flashed after coming here akin to two turning blood wheels. Staring at them would make people dizzy at first. A bit later, they would feel as if their soul was being dragged away.

“Don’t look at his blood eyes for too long or it’ll leave an incurable internal wound.” A senior warned the curious juniors who were staring into his eyes.

“Rumble!” The elders of the Nightwalker spread out and summoned multiple pillars. They had clearly-engraved runes on the surface and were refined specifically for a grand formation.

“Gentlemen, please give us some room. We’re about to start a formation here.” Zhui Xueyun addressed the crowd after the pillars were pinned to the ground.

“They want to go big for those fruits.” An expert from the previous generation understood their intention right away.

Many started moving back to leave an open field for them. The Nightwalker was a large tribe, not to mention the prestige of the blood king.

Moreover, no one could take the fruits from the dichromatic ape anyway. Why not let this group give it a shot? Perhaps they would be able to attack successfully then the rest could take advantage of this opportunity. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Virtuous Nephew, you want to have a direct contest against that ape?” An expert familiar with this tribe asked.

“No, we’re planning on taking a big risk by separating the primal beasts and sneaking in for the fruits.” Zhui Xueyun responded.

“That’s possible?” Someone nearby immediately said: “The ape’s power is unimaginable, it’s impossible to trick it.”

Zhui Xueyun was annoyed at being questioned in this manner. He glared at the cultivator and sneered: “Mist Sealing Eight Firmaments is a supreme formation of our tribe.”

“Mist Sealing Eight Firmaments.” Those nearby became startled: “That’s one of their key formations, extremely powerful.”

“Not just powerful.” An elder from a big sect said while staring at Xueyun: “Your blood eyes will amplify the formation’s effects.”

“You have great insight, Senior.” Zhui Xueyun was happy to hear this and laughed heartily.

Meanwhile, the students from Duality were watching the elders of the Nightwalker set up the formation.

“Can they really get the fruits before the great ape?” One student wondered.

“There’s a strong probability.” A stronger student commented: “This formation of theirs is wondrous. Once trapped inside, each step has the distance of an entire world. No one can escape this confinement with one exception, Zhui Xueyun. His eyes will serve as the formation control so he won’t be affected. He’ll become a part of the formation and can use it to stop the enemies, sounds amazing, right?”

The students nearby were impressed. One of them said: “No wonder why Zhui Xueyun is highly regarded by his tribe.”

“Failure is likely.” Teacher Du shook his head with a serious expression: “Don’t look down on the dichromatic ape. It is a famous beast here, very few in the entire holy ground can defeat it.”

The students didn’t expect this. The holy ground had many hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Nonetheless, they thought that a high heaven-level beast should really be this strong, enough to intimidate anyone.

“Go.” The elders moved in unison to control the pillars. The grand formation activated.

“Rumble!” Pillars suddenly burst out of the ground near the tree. Bright dao runes emerged and crisscrossed everywhere.

“Boom!” In the next second, the formation encompassed the entire area around the tree. The mist turned everything white.

“Raaa!” The beasts nearby immediately lunged into action.

Unfortunately, they found themselves to be stuck in the formation. Just half a step here required crossing ten million miles. They instantly became lost in the numerous dimensions.

“Incredible.” All the experts became startled. The tree was lost in the formation but so did the guardian beasts.

“Let’s go!” The elders shouted at Zhui Xueyun.

He was already prepared so his eyes became resplendent and red like rubies. He turned into a mist of blood and became one with the formation, no longer in sight.
