The unique palace was splendorous and majestic, full of nobility. Just filling the place with items and decoration couldn’t have the same effect. Just a few paintings and portraits here could overshadow other palaces made from divine metals. These works of art portrayed their master’s conquests and achievements.

Li Qiye walked through the hall, unperturbed, and enjoyed looking around as if it was his own garden.

Sun Lengying eventually brought him into a royal chamber with many servants. Just one piece of wood on the furniture here could sell at a sky-high price.

One could smell a medicinal fragrance as well. An expert in this field would be shocked - the smell must be coming from an incredible pill.

An old man was lying on a bed made of expensive divine wood. The cushioning blanket consisted of nine-colored feathers from a luan. [1]

He wore a robe with the shade of flowing auspicious clouds, making it look as if he was lying among them just like an immortal.

His statue was lofty and powerful. If he were to stand up, most people would only be around his waist. His white hair draped over his shoulder just like silver threads.

Big eyes and big mouth - no different from a silver lion. A glare from him could destroy everything, changing the day into night and vice versa with a single blink. The world trembled before his whims.

Alas, he looked weak and dispirited, akin to a lamp running out of oil.

“Your Highness, the guest is here.” Lengying bowed before disappearing into the shadows.

Lengying was notorious around these parts. Some even called him the King of the Night, grasping people’s lives within his palm. Just a single wave of his could annihilate a powerful clan or sect.

Numerous masters would lower their head before him, but only one could make him bow with respect - Lucidity King.

Lucidity, the ruler of Nine Secrets System and War Saint Dynasty, an unfathomable Eternal. But most importantly, he had what many considered to be the greatest daughter in the world!

One could tell how frightening he was after seeing Lengying’s near-subservient attitude.

Lucidity has ruled for three generations, the longest reign in the history of his dynasty. This could probably apply to the rest of Imperial as well.

Though many old masters still maintain their influence and authority, they usually withdrew to the background and stopped caring about mundane matters.

This wasn’t the case for Lucidity. He ruled with an iron fist and maintained control over various matters of the system, never losing an ounce of control. Much of this was due to his unfathomable cultivation.

Nine Secrets System prospered greatly under his rule. It was even rising above the Mu Clan. Many attributed this success to his leadership during the three generations.

Lucidity opened his eyes to look at Li Qiye: “I can’t stand up to greet you, Esteemed Guest. Please excuse the lack of manners.”

His face turned red as if just uttering these words required immense effort, similar to a man on his deathbed uttering his last words.

“No need to be so polite, I’m only a lost traveler.” Li Qiye chuckled and casually sat down.

The servants took a deep breath after seeing this. Few in Imperial were qualified to sit before their king.

This made Lucidity stare at Li Qiye again. The light in his eyes flickered and wavered, on the verge of extinguishing at any moment.

“My name is Hao Taiqing, what is yours?” The king closed his eyes again, seemingly needing rest after speaking so much. [2]

Virtually everyone in Imperial has heard of this name and knew who he was due to his peerless reputation. Even an Ascender would find their soul leaving in fear upon finding out. Only Li Qiye would treat this name as just another name, no different from the name of a random stranger on the street.

“Li Qiye.” He casually stated his own name.

“It’s a good name, a good name indeed.” Lucidity opened his eyes and praised, seemingly very excited after hearing the pleasant name.

Li Qiye had no reaction to the king’s excitement.

“Your Majesty, you are unwell, please rest more.” Lengying bowed and respectfully suggested.

“Yes.” Lucidity nodded before turning towards Li Qiye with an invitation: “A meeting is fate, how about becoming a guest at my dynasty?”

Others would be honored to hear this, but Li Qiye nonchalantly said: “That’s fine, I have free time anyway.”

“Good.” The king nodded satisfyingly and told a servant: “Take good care of my young friend, do not make any mistakes.”

The servant prostrated before respectfully turning towards Li Qiye: “Young Noble, please follow me.”

Li Qiye nodded and followed.

After he left, time seemed to stop in the chamber.

“Your Majesty...” Lengying eventually broke the silence.

The sleeping king opened his eyes and said weakly: “I don’t have much time left, it is time to appoint a successor.”

“...” Lengying had no response.

“I know what you want to say, Lengying.” The king smiled: “Accidentally coming across a few things is the work of fate, wouldn’t you say?”

Lengying didn’t reply, standing there as if he was part of the shadows. No one could spot him.

“Start early tomorrow, it’s time for me to go back. If I were to die, I want to be at the court.” Lucidity finished with this before entering a deep slumber.

Lengying continued to stand there, not as a shadow of himself but rather Lucidity’s shadow. He was the only one who could stand next to the sleeping king. Lengying was the only one the king trusts during his most vulnerable moment.

Since he reigned for three generations, he had experienced numerous trouble. So many wished for his death. Assassins scattered hid around him, so he only trusted a few confidants.

The only person in the entire system to have earned his absolute confidence was Lengying.

Everyone knew that he acted as Lucidity’s shadow and bodyguard. He would always be next to the king wherever he went with absolute loyalty, the only person to never betray the king.

Rumor has it that this relationship between them existed dated back to their youth. Being loyal to Lucidity was Lengying’s purpose for living.

Thus, he also acted as an enforcer of sorts. If anyone were to disobey or betray Lucidity, Lenging would carry out a disciplinary punishment while showing zero mercy. Obviously, a king that had ruled for so long had plenty of enemies. They saw him as an annoying nail and would want nothing more than to get rid of him.

Many sects have betrayed Lucidity in the past, and that would be the time for Lengying to shine - eliminating these traitors with brutality.

This played a large part in his present notoriety. Numerous people and great powers have fallen to his cruel and bloody methods.

All in all, Sun Lengying was Lucidity’s executioner and sharpest sword!

1. Another mythical bird, I would say lower level than a Phoenix and can eventually evolve into one.

2. Looks like his title is the same as his name; Taiqing means Extreme Pureness/clearness, or Lucidity
