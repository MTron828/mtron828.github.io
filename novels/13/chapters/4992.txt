Chapter 4993: I Give It To You

Swordgrasp Venerable, Jun Cuican, and Tendril King didn’t speak. No one had heard of this monk fighting before. Nonetheless, even conquerors didn’t matter before him since they were all juniors in comparison. 

“Would you follow me, Little Miss?” He placed his hand respectfully on her head.

She looked around for a bit before her sight stopped on Li Qiye. She walked closer to Li Qiye and then glanced back at the Buddha.

She surprised everyone with her choice - Li Qiye.

First, the monk was the top dog here. Second, Tendril King was another top candidate given her status and power. Choosing Li Qiye seemed like the worst option.

He smiled and gently patted her head.

“You know your stuff, picking our young noble is rather wise…” Ming Shi gave her a thumbs-up but realized that this was inappropriate since her senior aunt wasn’t chosen.

This was akin to saying that her aunt was inferior to Li Qiye. Thus, she awkwardly stuck out her tongue at Tendril King.

Her aunt was not angry and only stared at them with great curiosity.

Lil’ Freckle then looked up and presented the god source to Li Qiye.

“For the young noble?” Ming Shi and the others became surprised.

This was most likely the largest god source desired by all the demons and even outsiders. 

Lil’ Freckle nodded repeatedly, telling him to take it.

Li Qiye stared at the god source and smiled.

“Amitabha.” The monk saw this and placed his palms together. He bowed toward Li Qiye and left right away, taking his magnificent visual phenomena with him.

He didn’t bother competing at all, meaning that he wasn’t here for the god source in the first place.

“Congratulations, Dao Brother. It appears that this god source is not meant for me.” Tendril commented, stating that she is no longer in the running.

However, the same couldn’t be said for Jun Cuican and Swordgrasp Venerable. They stared intensely at Li Qiye.

He didn’t notice them and accepted the god source with a smile: “The time to dissipate draws near.”

Lil’ Freckle nodded and stared intensely at him, seemingly asking for a favor.

He took a closer look at the god source and shook his head: “There is nothing I can do.”

Upon hearing this, she became disappointed and sad. Tears swelled up in her eyes.

Listeners were confused since they didn’t know what they were talking about. Most demons and beasts only focused on the god source itself, wanting to seize it from his hand.

“May I have your name?” Jun Cuican came over and asked, still acting as if he was above everyone.

“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Li Qiye? You’re that Li Qiye?” Cuican was surprised because he had heard about how this person obliterated five dragon lords back at the academy.

“That’s the one.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Li Qiye!” Swordgrasp Venerable suddenly became murderous after hearing this. His aura became chilling and rendered weaker demons unconscious.

“And?” Li Qiye responded.

“You killed our sect’s successor.” The venerable uttered each word slowly.

“I’ve killed too many to remember each of them.” Li Qiye said.

Listeners took a deep breath after hearing this domineering statement. This even surpassed Cuican’s domineering attitude because he still showed respect to the venerable.

“It’s Swordgrasp Young Noble from the academy.” Ming Shi pulled his sleeve and whispered.

“Oh, that guy, didn’t leave much of an impression.” Li Qiye remembered and said.

The venerable nearly vomited blood after hearing this while the demons were left speechless.

“Your life for his.” The venerable said: “I shall take your head and offer it as a sacrifice.”

“Sure if you wish to die. I don’t mind killing one more.” Li Qiye said as if this wasn’t a big deal at all.

This ancient ancestor had five sacred fruits and was far stronger than Stone Lion God’s group.

“So be it!” The venerable’s sword energy intensified to a monstrous level.

“Boom!” Another cultivator suddenly landed on the valley.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He sat on a throne made from black metal with engraved jewels. He looked to be around the same age as Tendril King, still rather young.

However, he had a calm air to him, dressed in a purple and red dragon robe. He wore a crown on top of his square-shaped face, looking rather dignified and majestic.

It was as if everyone else needed to bow before his throne and offer tributes.

“Halo Monarch!” A demon recognized him.
