Chapter 5444: A New Life

Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye at the dreadful assault, only resorting to raising one hand.

“Boom!” Everything around him started sinking down; not even the unstoppable attacks could get through.

The opponents roared and channeled all of their dao and chaos true energy. This was proven futile all the same.

He then pushed his hand downward, creating an energy palm in the air with a supreme power. The strongest cultivators were instantly suppressed while weaker ones fell to their knees, unable to resist his power.

In this crucial moment, a divine protector of Azure Peak finally arrived and witnessed this scene.

“Young Noble, please recall your power. The little ones do not know of you, please forgive their insolence.” The protector’s expression turned from astonishment to joy after seeing Li Qiye.

He was an old man with a tall frame seemingly made from metal - an entity built to protect.

Li Qiye pulled back his hand and didn’t say anything to the kneeling protector. The suppressed cultivators heaved a sigh of relief after being freed from the suppression.

They exchanged glances in confusion, realizing that this was above their level since they had never experienced such a powerful pressure.

After a long while, the maelstrom gained a green color and fully encompassed the woman, pulling her into another dimension of the tree.

Li Qiye then finally paid attention to the others.

“Young Noble, do you recognize me?” The divine protector kneeled before Li Qiye with tears streaming down: “You entrusted the tree with me back in the nine worlds, I didn’t expect to be able to see you again.”

He was none other than Sentinel Treant who had participated in Boss Tang’s auction. Back in the nine worlds, he was known as Soldier Tree who was tasked with protecting the new lifeform. After an epoch of cultivation, he had reached an unimaginable level of cultivation.

“Seems like you did not waste your time.” Li Qiye smiled and helped him up.

“It is all thanks to you, Young Noble. I ascended to guard the lord while Soulvine stayed behind.” The old man said. [1]

“It is part of your fortune.” Li Qiye said.

At this time, a girl around seventeen to eighteen years of age descended from outer space. She prompted returned after hearing the news.

Her presence lit up the whole world. All eyes involuntarily focused on her as if she was the center of the universe. She had a petite frame even relative to her peers.

What she lacked in size was made up of a unique aura. Although she restrained her incredible power, strands of energy still oozed out. Her cultivation was simply too strong for her to hide it completely.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A single energy strand could crush heaven and earth. Her unstoppable power could dominate all under the heavens.

Putting aside their power, the strands also possessed a primordial nature as if their owner was the first existence in the world.

From her, all creatures could see the evolutions and derivations of heaven and earth. They could see traces of themselves in her.

The ancient aura remained vibrant and brimming with vitality despite its age. Spectators would immediately think of her as a primordial being.

Her delicate and petite figure shouldered the hope of an entire race. Her green lotus dress seemed to be a gift from nature itself.

Upon closer inspection, she possessed distinct differences from the other races. For example, her ethereal wings were different from any other sky spirits’. The latter had bright wings that were visible while hers were virtually invisible.

Moreover, sky spirits were typically tiny in their true form. Thus, she was actually a giant when compared to her kin.

“Benefactor.” She immediately kneeled before Li Qiye.

“The baby girl you entrusted to us is now all grown up.” Sentinel Treant hurriedly introduced: “She is Azure Ancestor, the first of her kind.”

“Thank you for granting us life, Benefactor.” She said respectfully.

Li Qiye helped her up and smiled: “I cannot grant life. A new race is only possible with the permission of the high heaven.”

Azure Ancestor was none other than the new lifeform in Divine Tree Ridge. In a sense, sky spirits weren’t an entirely new race but rather, a regression of the treants.

“We wouldn’t be here without you, Benefactor.” Azure Ancestor insisted.

Although he didn’t stick around to protect her, she understood that he was the reason for their existence. Thus, she had nothing but the utmost respect for Li Qiye.

“Fate brought us together.” Li Qiye said: “I only helped out in the beginning, your success is due to your own effort and fortune.”

Azure Ancestor and Sentinel Treant told everyone to leave in order to have a private conversation with Li Qiye.

Although they were apex existences now, the meeting with Li Qiye still filled them with boundless excitement. The past came knocking again; everything was still vivid and clear.
