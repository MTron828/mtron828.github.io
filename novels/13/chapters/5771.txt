Chapter 5772: Master Of The Azure

Azure Omniplate - an armor on the same level as World Emperor’s Moon Embrace. Its title was known only to a few, as elusive as its owner.

Purewood Divine Emperor seldomly fought, and fewer than few could force him to use his armor. This included Skysplitter War as well.

Once he entered Immortal Dao City, everyone thought the world would never see the armor again.

Now, it seemed he had passed it on to Immortal Emperor Ren Xian. The question was when and why.

The two had no relationship. Immortal Emperor Ren Xian came from the nine worlds while Purewood was one of the oldest emperors on the thirteen continents.

Moreover, he was a diviner. Why didn’t he give it to another emperor from the same race?

“I didn’t expect to see Azure Omniplate today.” Hao Hai said while looking at the blue rays emanating from the armor. One could see the firmaments through the expanse.

The rays were ancient and inscrutable, seemingly gifts from the high heaven.

“Just lucky to earn the senior’s favor, I can barely control it.” Ren Xian said.

He was unduly humble since the azure rays looked unbreakable - a testament to his mastery over the treasure. He could definitely muster its ultimate power.

“It was created by Stonesplitter Patriarch, I don’t think it is as strong as a paragon artifact.” Hao Hai remarked.

Ren Xian stared at Divine Beast and said: “Although your blade isn’t at grand completion, its power leaves no room for doubt. The problem is your lack of time with it and most importantly, you weren’t born during that epoch.”

In terms of raw power, emperors stood no chance against this blade. However, this didn’t mean it was unbeatable due to Ren Xian’s valid points.

If Hao Hai had more time with it, he still might not be able to gain full mastery. A paragon artifact was too powerful and due to the lack of innate attunement, his body might not be able to handle it.

Thus, the victor between these two artifacts remained unknown.

“That’s reasonable.” Hao Hai nodded and said: “We can give it a shot to see which is superior, your Azure Omniplate or my Divine Beast.”

“Very well, please give me pointers, Brother.” Ren Xian laughed in response.

“Please give me pointers.” Hao Hai returned the polite gesture.

“Boom!” Both activated their vitality and released their fate palaces. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Anima emerged in the center of their twelve palaces, pulsing brightly and brimming with power.

“Clank! Clank!” Dao laws and anima light engulfed and empowered their body.

This was necessary since they wielded ultimate artifacts. Their body couldn’t withstand this without further augmentation. Otherwise, they would be the first to crumble before striking their opponent.

Ren Xian had the advantage in this aspect because he came from the same epoch as his immortal armament. The suppressive effect weakened as a result.

As for Hao Hai, controlling Divine Beast required enduring its power first. Being from a different epoch made this harder.

Thus, he moved his twelve heaven’s wills around him, using them as armor plates to withstand Divine Beast.

“Creak.” After ample preparation, he slowly unsheathed the blade.

The dimension shook violently as a blinding divine light erupted. Images of beasts appeared - true dragons with imposing and destructive auras, phoenixes with spread wings releasing auspicious flames capable of burning the stars. A gluttonous beast could be seen roaring and devouring heaven and earth. Given enough time, it could swallow everything in existence...

As for Ren Xian, he imbued his twelve wills into the armor itself, creating a defensive azure above him. He gained a blue glow as if there existed a heaven within him.

“Bestial Forms!” Hao Hai made his move, slashing the sky to release a bestial epoch. The images of the divine beasts soared forward to crush Ren Xian.

“Master of the Azure!” Ren Xian roared and leaped to the sky.
