Chapter 4279: Chi Jinlin

In this soulless state, Li Qiye removed all emotions and attachments. The world and its inhabitants were nothing more than connected dots of various shapes and sizes.

Without his soul, these dots would never catch his attention. Only mighty beings could overcome this and communicate with him.

Of course, this corpse-like state didn’t mean that he was weak either. Just his body alone could suppress everything on top of being impervious to damage.

He crossed through deserts and worlds of ice and snow, volcanoes and mountains filled with blades…

Some areas were bypassed with a single step regardless of the looming dangers. He took his time with some others but nothing could touch him. Each step, regardless of his speed, was unstoppable and cleared out all obstacles.

He also visited densely-populated cities and other prosperous places. They weren’t as dangerous but a few still caused trouble because Li Qiye resembled a beggar right now.

His eyes were muddled so he appeared to be a fool. Some idle bums or children would tease Li Qiye but none could bypass his seal.

Today, he walked on the street of an old city and became the target of a few children.

“I got him!” A kid tossed mud at Li Qiye.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” He became dirty but still didn’t react.

“Is he stupid?” They laughed happily and teased him in various fashions.

Since he ignored them and kept on moving forward, an older teen had a malicious suggestion: “Let’s tie him up, we’ll see if he can ignore us forever.”

“Right, let’s tie him up and throw him into the river.” His friend took it a step further.

“Okay.” They agreed. One of them took out some iron chains.

“What are you doing?!” A middle-aged man who was passing by saw this and shouted at them.

He dressed humbly but looked exceptional due to his muscular physique and gallant eyes. Though he wasn’t handsome, his features were righteous and resolute. His eyes were spirited. Alas, there seemed to be a hint of sorrow hidden deep in there, not usually seen from someone his age.

“None of your business!” One teen shouted back.

The man glared at the teen, successfully intimating the guy without needing to show wrath. He was a cultivator while the teens were mere mortals.

They nearly pissed their pants from fear, dropped the chains, and started to run. After all, mortals were mere insects compared to a cultivator.

The man frowned after seeing the lack of humanity. He wanted to leave but couldn’t due to Li Qiye’s condition.

He became interested in Li Qiye. He merely yelled at the teens earlier since he didn’t wish to see a crime committed.

However, as he was about to leave, he felt a special aura coming from Li Qiye, albeit only for a split second.

He approached closer and carefully observed. The guy appeared to be a dirty beggar but intuition told him that this was another cultivator.

However, he couldn’t assess Li Qiye’s cultivation. The guy was empty, akin to a mortal.

He was naturally too weak to see Li Qiye’s current soulless state. Either way, even if Li Qiye wasn’t in this state, he still wouldn’t be able to see anything.

“My name is Chi Jinlin.” He politely introduced himself despite Li Qiye’s ridiculous state. He cupped his fist and continued: “May I have your name?”

Of course, Li Qiye ignored him since the entire world was made of connected dots in his eyes right now. Only a top master like the old man in the wine shop could reach Li Qiye.

The man didn’t give up and continued: “Where are you going, Brother?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Li Qiye still didn’t respond and continued moving onward.

The man confirmed that this youth must have had some problem with cultivation or a traumatizing experience. This resulted in him losing his senses and awareness.

This made him sympathetic due to his own experience. He said: “The path towards the dao is unpredictable, no need to be so down, Brother. How about staying at my place for a bit?”

He thought that if this continued, Li Qiye could lose his life. He was helpless and death seemed inevitable. For example, those wicked teens earlier could have killed him.

“My place has verdant hills and green waters, how about it?” He asked again, wanting to help Li Qiye.

Despite a lack of response, he still forcefully brought Li Qiye back to his place.

Sure enough, he lived alone beneath a peak with beautiful scenery. He cultivated alone next to a waterfall and a lake.

In reality, he was once a noble but suffered serious setbacks and moved here to focus on cultivation.

This was his main focus, nothing else outside of the occasional trips back to the city. The diligent man could spend days cultivating. Alas, he couldn’t overcome the current bottleneck.
