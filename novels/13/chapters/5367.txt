Chapter 5368: No Immortals

Unfortunately, he was still struck by the tree wielding the immensity of three thousand worlds and countless cycles.

He flew toward the horizon and disappeared like a shooting star. No one understood the extent of his injuries.

Once people calmed down, they saw the tree being put back to the ground by Li Qiye. It looked exactly the same as before.

They exchanged glances in silence since words couldn’t describe their current feelings. They viewed Eternal as one of the strongest conquerors.

He managed to defeat four top combatants earlier, clearly displaying the insurmountable gap. However, he was still sent flying after one move. This was shocking enough regardless of his actual injuries.

“I… I…” Someone tried to speak but couldn’t muster a coherent sentence.

What else could she say to describe Eternal Conqueror being sent flying by an ordinary man wielding the dream tree?

“Is he still human?” Another murmured.

“What else can he be if not human?” A dragon lord responded.

“An immortal?” An ancestor joked.

“Immortals don’t exist in this world.” A top conqueror joined in.

“You know, there is someone capable of delivering something so ridiculous and miraculous.” Someone else remarked.

“Duality Master.” A conqueror who had met Duality Master before answered instantly.

This mysterious being didn’t cultivate but the myriad dao still followed him - something truly inconceivable.

Thus, when they stared at Li Qiye, they also thought about Duality Master since the two shared the same devilish ability.

However, there was a stark contrast between the two. Duality Master was beloved by all. Wherever he went, both supreme existences and heinous villains would want to have a drink and chat with him. Some believed that meeting Duality Master for the first time still felt like meeting an old friend that one hasn’t seen in a long time.

In fact, there was a story regarding a duel between two mortal enemies. Duality Master came to the battlefield by chance and asked them to have a drink. They stopped and had a drink with him first before resuming the battle later.

Li Qiye was just as mysterious and capable of performing miraculous feats. Alas, he was far from being likable.

Those who didn’t know him had no reason to drink with him. Those who did tremble at his sight; their knees would buckle and their mouth sealed shut.

Although Li Qiye hid his power and aura, spectators still had an instinctive fear of him. They didn’t dare to get close or breathe loudly in his presence.

Therefore, the dragon lords and conquerors who had seen Duality Master noted the interesting similarities and differences between the two.

“Take it.” Li Qiye took the dreamwater and didn’t bother glancing at it before giving it to Xiao Hu.

The youth accepted it and forgot to show his gratitude since he was dumbstruck. This treasure was coveted by all. Ferocity who was standing nearby also desired it.

It seemed as if this priceless treasure was nothing in Li Qiye’s eyes. Giving it away was far from being an issue.

Xiao Hu truly wanted the dreamwater for his master but knew that he had no chance of obtaining it. Now, he was holding it in his hand.

The crowd saw the whole thing as well. They thought that no other dao lord or conqueror could be as generous or rather, ludicrously liberal with his wealth.

Tears streamed down Xiao Hu’s cheeks while he held the dreamwater.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye said.

The youth hurriedly wiped his tears away before catching up.

“Wait for me!” The imperious Ferocity shamelessly ran after them. Nothing was more important than sticking around Li Qiye right now.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything so Ferocity had no problem being shameless with a wide smile on his face. He had no intention of stealing the dreamwater from Xiao Hu either since that would be suicidal.

After the group was long gone, the crowd finally dispersed. Some lamented their failure to obtain the dreamwater.
