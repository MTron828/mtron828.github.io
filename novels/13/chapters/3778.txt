Chapter 3779: Lankavatara Ward

By this point, the astonished spectators had a different evaluation of Golden Cicada, assuming that he was far stronger than Hu Ben.

“Boom!” The scion got out of the pit again and floated in the air.

The ultimate move didn’t actually injure him. However, there were cracks on the draconic guard. His robe and hair were slightly messy as well, no longer looking cool like before.

The crowd took a deep breath after seeing this. An ancestor said: “And here I thought he would be wounded by the Grand Palm. He keeps on beating expectations.”

“This is messed up.” Another big shot shuddered.

Grand Palm was a famous killing move, usually a sure kill. Though the strike didn’t directly hit his chest, the damage should have been grievous. Alas, this wasn’t the case at all.

“I have heard of Grand Palm long ago, it lives up to its fame.” The scion praised.

“Seems like I have learned nothing and can’t even wound you.” The monk expected this result.

“If your cultivation were the same as mine, then my rib cage would have shattered. Ever since I finished my dao, you’re the first among the young generation to do this to my draconic guard.” The scion said.

This haughty comment served as the highest praise for the monk.

The cultivators from the holy ground exchanged glances, suddenly becoming excited.

“Hmm, this draconic guard is a top technique from Heaven Devourer Dao Lord. Few in this world can break it, Golden Cicada’s Grand Palm did an amazing job.” One expert nodded approvingly.

Both techniques were considered to be on the same level. That’s why Golden Cicada instilled confidence in the crowd.

Even the older experts and ancestors present didn’t think that they could break the draconic guard with one move.

“He can uphold the temple’s prestige with this fight.” One genius added.

They thought that even in the case of his defeat, he had done enough to show the power of his sect. The problem lay in the scion being too strong.

“Okay, warm-up is over, let me see your true ability.” The scion heartily laughed.

“That was only a warm-up?” Most found this surprising because the two have resorted to top techniques already.

“They’re using dao lord merit laws to warm up? Looks like we’re not even qualified to perform a warm-up then.” One proud genius smiled wryly.

The young ones took pride in their top techniques. Alas, these techniques couldn’t compare to the dao lord-level ones. Thus, the scion’s comment was hurtful, albeit truthful.

“Amitabha, I’ve heard of your peerless prowess long ago and can’t wait to see what you can do, Scion.” Golden Cicada had a solemn expression that didn’t match his youthful face.

“Buzz.” His kasaya lit up again and released Buddhist hymns and chants.

The temples inside Heavenly Dragon resonated and sent out dao characters flying towards him. He looked like an ocean capable of taking in everything.

“What merit law is this?” Someone whispered.

“He’s borrowing the power of Heavenly Dragon Temple.” A big shot quietly answered.

The characters eventually turned into an external golden kasaya. One could hear countless chants empowering the regalia.

Several images of various Buddhas appeared on the surface, seemingly wanting to protect Golden Cicada. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Lankavatara Ward, a great scripture left behind by an enlightened monk. Other monks have chanted for it for generations now, empowering it.” An ancestor elaborated.

The spectators didn’t need to know this scripture to be aware of its power. Golden Cicada’s defense looked unbreakable as he resembled a golden statue.

“Incredible Buddhist affinity.” The scion laughed: “Blessed by countless monks, penetrating this won’t be easy.”

“You’re being humble, Scion. My attainment is limited so I can’t borrow all the blessings of the great monks. As for you, you have finished your grand dao and don’t need to borrow external forces.” Golden Cicada said.

The big shots exchanged glances after hearing this.

“Righteous Scion’s dao is finished.” One of them said.

“This is expected, he’s an heir now and should have his own grand dao.” Another replied.

In order to become a dao lord, one needed to create their own grand dao. Otherwise, using someone else’s merit laws - regardless of how powerful - would still render the practitioner inferior to those in the past.

“If I didn’t have my own power today, I wouldn’t be able to break this.” The scion confidently said.

“Boom!” He channeled his power and dao laws descended like waterfalls.

Chaos energy ravaged and tore the sky vault apart. Primordial power also manifested. All three affinities gathered around him.

The crowd became startled since they felt their own dao laws being affected by his eruption. They immediately became suppressed as if he was holding them by the throat.

“This is his grand dao.” A big shot gasped.

He has yet to use it; just the activation alone suppressed virtually everyone in the audience.

“Amitabha.” Golden Cicada placed his palms together then unleashed a dual palm strike.

“Boom!” With this attack, six paths became one and the yin and yang joined forces - creating a cycle of death and rebirth. Space and time were refined as a result. Fleeing to another dimension or space-time was futile.

“Reincarnation Seal!” A different ancestor bellowed after seeing this.
