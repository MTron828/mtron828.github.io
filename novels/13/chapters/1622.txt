During the time when their Can Long branch had the highest authority, they chose to support Immortal Emperor Ren Xian.

When the emperor was still young, Forefather Asura took care of the dissenters and was a staunch supporter of him. Later on, the emperor shouldered the Heaven’s Will so Asura became even more respected in Soaring Immortal with a peerless position. This was the reason why he enjoyed so much resources for longevity.

Unfortunately, no flower can bloom for a hundred days. Eventually, the branch finally declined. Forefather Asura’s immense strength alone couldn’t do it all. They were robbed of their power before being pushed out of the political scene completely.

Li Qiye simply smiled and said: “Asura’s current situation is not unexpected. Immortal Emperor Ren Xian might be a man of his words but this doesn’t mean his descendants are the same!”

Lin simply sighed in response. A junior like him wasn’t in a position to discuss the inner politics of his sect.

“I don’t think you’re here today just to chat with me?” Li Qiye looked at Lin and smiled.

Lin sighed in response: “I’m here this time in hope of talking to you about the current situation in Soaring Immortal. Immortal Emperor Ren Xian’s people are in charge.”

Li Qiye replied: “I know, you are saying this isn’t the idea of your entire sect.”

“Yes.” Lin busily said: “We are asking Brother Li to convey the message for us, as well as our respect.”

Li Qiye was amused by this. When he used the Benevolent Armament back then, some old men from Soaring Immortal have guessed a few things. However, they didn’t personally expect for him to actually be out with his real body. They assumed that Li Qiye’s backing was the Dark Crow.

This misunderstanding was reasonable since, for millions of years, the Dark Crow has only trained emperors and never personally came out. Thus, these old me thought that Li Qiye was the crow’s disciple and representative. This was the reason why they sent Lin here.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye said: “Is this the Can Long’s intent or are you the messenger for the Tun Ri and Ba Mie branches?”

“The two ancestors from the other two branches feel the same way but they couldn’t come themselves due to their withering lifespan.” Lin answered.

Li Qiye shook his head in disapproval: “If those old men knew who they are facing, they needed to understand that they, themselves, must try their best to earn this opportunity. It won’t just fall down from the sky in front of them.”

“The ancestors are aware.” Lin hurriedly explained: “They are doing the best right now to convince the other ancestors so that everyone can be on the same side.”

Li Qiye smiled: “Unfortunately, I don’t see much hope in this. Your sect still came into being with an oppressive and sharp momentum. Looks like your ancestors were ineffective.”

Lin lamented again: “Brother Li, you might not know this but right now, Immortal Emperor Ren Xian’s branch has an unprecedented influence in our sect. Even if our three branches are working together, we might not necessarily be able to suppress that branch. The young ones from that branch, especially, want to rule the nine worlds. That’s why the ancestors can’t convince them right away.”

“A bunch of fools thinking that they’re the heaven’s favorite children.” Li Qiye said flatly: “After so many generations, they still think they have a nobler lineage than any other beings.”

Lin couldn’t help but smile wryly after hearing this. Once again, it would be improper for a junior like him to comment.

“So, your group must have the throne this time around.” Li Qiye stared at him and stated.

“Well...” Lin coughed awkwardly and said: “The ancestors from our three branches, at the very least, do not want to do so. However, Eldest Brother’s ambition for the throne is the decision of the Ren Xian branch. Ancestor Long himself will be the dao protector.”

“Ancestor Long?” Li Qiye asked.

“Ancestor Long’s isn’t well known to the world. His name is Long Zhantian.” Lin quickly answered: “He was born in the later years of the Qian Li generation and even had wanted to compete against Immortal Emperor Yin Tian. His venerable has a grand completion Soaring Immortal Physique, far better than Eldest Brother. His cultivation has reached the highest attainment too.”

“Ancestor Long, as the leader of the young faction, greatly supports Eldest Brother’s effort. He went against all oppositions to help Eldest Brother.” Lin wasn’t all too pleased with this.

Long Aotian’s position for the throne has been decided by the sect long ago. Thus, all disciples must help him achieve this goal.

“I see.” Li Qiye smiled: “The Soaring Immortal Sect was under an isolation agreement. Your ancestor thought that he could have become an Immortal Emperor but this agreement restricted him. Because of this, he is full of grievances and anger towards the Dark Crow so he wants revenge!”

“No...” Lin was aghast. Though he was aware of this existence, his seniors had told him that the title, Dark Crow, was a taboo and shouldn’t be uttered so carelessly.

At this moment, Li Qiye was bringing up this title as if to sentence their sect for violating the agreement. Even though he wasn’t the Dark Crow, he was still the existence’s representative!

This was the reason why Lin became so scared. He quickly added: “Brother Li, please don’t misunderstand. We really have no such intentions. Ancestor Long only wants to fulfill his wish of winning the throne and never harbored any ill-will towards His Excellency. There’s definitely no wish of revenge either.”

“It doesn’t matter.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “For millions of years, plenty of hatred went around. Too many irreconcilable feuds have been created.”

Lin heaved a sigh of relief after hearing this.

Li Qiye then added: “However, are your old men this useless? Your Ren Xian branch might have one or two characters like this Ancestor Long, but this is enough to suppress those old men? A grand completion Immortal Physique isn’t exactly rare in your sect!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I...” Lin didn’t know how to answer right away.

“Looks like your old men didn’t reveal everything.” Li Qiye said flatly.

Lin hesitated for a moment before divulging the real details: “The ancestors are thinking that the imperial children are still alive and may be able to leave the Immortal Confinement.”

“I see, Immortal Emperor Ren Xian’s sons, right? Back then, it is said that they wanted to train in there, but the truth is that they fled to that place, right?”

Lin was at a loss for words again. The ancestors told him that during that event, many people from their sect committed suicide in fear of the punishment or the truth getting out.

The emperor’s sons were said to be training in the Immortal Confinement but the truth was that they had to hide in there to avoid the Dark Crow. They took the fatal risk to travel to that place.

Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Regardless of Immortal Emperor Ren Xian’s origin, he has always been a decisive and prudent man. Unfortunately, his sons didn’t inherit his strong qualities. They had perverted thoughts of having the greatest bloodline and want to rule again using Soaring Immortal.”

Lin was very afraid of this grave matter. Even their sect wouldn’t be able to handle the consequence.

“I won’t comment further on your sect itself. However, Ancestor Long and your Eldest Brother are violating the old agreement, intending to obtain the Heaven’s Will. They shall be destroyed, this is the price of betraying the oath. However, if your sect still has people wanting to cultivate that bloodline, then prepare for the consequence.”

“No, absolutely not, nothing like that is going on.” Lin broke out in cold sweat and panicked: “Brother Li, please tell His Excellency that the past will not repeat itself!”

How could Lin not be afraid? Back then, some people in their sect wanted to try for atavism. This incited the fury of the Dark Crow and the existence forcefully searched their sect!

Despite being a lineage with five emperors and praised to be able to look down on the world, the entire sect still quivered before the Dark Crow’s wrath.

On that day, Immortal Emperor Qian Li and the Black Dragon King presided over the battle. These two legions directly sealed all spatial paths belonging to the sect.

Many experts with no lack of Godkings committed suicide before the Dark Crow’s forceful inquisition. In the end, the emperor’s sons had to run into the sure-death prison.

Later on, the sect made a vow before the Dark Crow finally left. Back in that generation, if they had tried to fight back, they might have turned into ashes already.
