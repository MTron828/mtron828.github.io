Chapter 5439: Goodbye, Crow

Chapter 5439: Goodbye, Crow

“Fine, the bear can stay.” The old man was eventually persuaded.

“Congratulations, your legacy lives on after so many years.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Lives on, huh?” The old man glanced at the bear before looking up at the sky.

As an apex existence that had treated the world as food, he had no attachments and didn’t think about leaving a legacy behind. The only thing was to survive - that would be his mark and legacy.

Alas, this was no longer the case after his death. Li Qiye exploded and obliterated him, delivering his true death.

Therefore, given the inevitability of being forgotten, he thought about leaving behind a legacy. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Alas, who was worthy of this? The greatest geniuses were mere ants in his eyes, unable to actually shoulder his greatness.

Nonetheless, he eventually relented. Just ten to twenty percent was good enough to become utterly dominant. Plus, the bear could actually exceed expectations and excel in the distant land.

“Try your best now, your destiny is in your hands.” Li Qiye patted the bear again.

It let out a soft cry and rubbed its head against his hand, knowing that this was time for their separation.

“Splash! Splash!” The water in the pond started boiling and became radiant. The rays seemed to have a corporeal characteristic and could be touched.

“Crow, this is goodbye.” The old man stood up.

“Yes.” Li Qiye stood up as well to bid farewell to his once mortal foe.

“I wish you the best but unfortunately, I will not see the day when you slay the heaven.” The old man sighed.

“Be well now.” Li Qiye said.

“You too.” The old man bowed slightly and disappeared from sight along with True Bear.

The courtyard became particularly quiet with their departure. Nonetheless, its seal remained, blocking it from the rest of the world. A billion years could pass and the separation would still remain.

“Splash!” A supreme beauty emerged with water droplets streaming down her body - words couldn’t describe her unparalleled appearance.

She was blessed with a slender figure, long legs, and immaculate features - all culminating in a peerless charm and aura. Her long, lustrous hair flowed down to her waist. As it swayed gently, an ethereal aura oozed outward.

Her anima focused on harmony with heaven and earth. Looking at her was akin to looking at all the beauties of the world.

Anima had become so innate that just one smile or frown contained this profound affinity, striking the heart and leaving an indelible mark.

A single glance would leave an unforgettable impression. Her wondrous image would always shine brightly in someone’s memory, capable of helping them in their darkest moment. This purifying factor made her beauty extend beyond mere physical boundaries.

She looked around, seemingly confused about her location and who had saved her. She didn’t remember the circumstances of her death either.

However, she finally saw Li Qiye and trembled from being overwhelmed. As an apex cultivator, nothing could move her until his familiar figure today.

The image of him was engraved in her memories. Thus, she immediately recognized him.

“Young Master!” She ran over into his embrace.

“It’s really you!” She didn’t know what was going on since this could be a dream.

“It’s me, I’m really here.” He smiled and gently stroked her long hair.

She hugged him tightly, afraid that he might disappear if she were to let go.

A long while later, he said: “Long time no see.”

“Yes, long time no see.” She nodded and looked up carefully at him: “You really did it.”

“Have I ever failed before?” He smiled.

“No, of course not.” He said.

She nestled in his chest for a moment before asking: “Is everything okay?”

“Yes and no.” Li Qiye responded.

“And Heavenguard?” She asked.

He sighed and comforted her: “No longer around, they have accomplished their mission wonderfully, truly deserving of pride.”

“It’s inevitable.” She sighed softly. After all, the rise and fall of sects were normal occurrences. Nothing could last forever.

“Why did you throw your life away? Was that necessary?” He asked.

“I returned in order to warn you, Young Master. The situation is dire.” Her expression became serious.

“I know, I noticed signs everywhere, not just from you.” He said.

“Someone descended with a sinister plan.” She revealed.

“Yes, within expectations, albeit a little soon.” He nodded.

“Are you making your move now, Young Master?” She asked.

“No rush. Your cultivation has crumbled so let me take you to a place for recovery first. Otherwise, you’ll turn into a mortal.” He said.
