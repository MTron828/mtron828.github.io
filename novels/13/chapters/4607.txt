Chapter 4608: Not Interested

Being a sworn brother of a dao lord meant limitless potential, perhaps even sharing the world together.

At that point, authority, beauties, merit laws, treasures? All were within reach. Moreover, he would also be under the protection of a dao lord.

Li Qiye continued to sip his tea slowly, not showing any sign of excitement.

“Take a look at yourself in the mirror before asking our young noble to be your sworn brother. You… are not worthy.” Xiao Xuan answered instead while staring at the king with disdain.

Those who didn’t know who she was couldn’t believe what they were hearing. Five-sun King had everything going for him right now. Only a few were qualified to become his sworn brother.

Now, he took the initiative to ask Li Qiye. In the eyes of others, he was the superior performing a favor. They would view it as a blessing bestowed by their ancestors.

Alas, Xiao Xuan claimed that he was not qualified to do so. They would find this utterly ridiculous and ignorant.

For example, Ye Tingrong lacked information on Li Qiye, hence her astonishment. Five-sun King should be the one making this claim, no one else. Some might actually burst out in laughter after hearing Xiao Xuan and point their finger at her, jeering.

Five-sun King’s expression changed as well. This contempt was new to him and worst of all, it came from a little girl.

Nonetheless, he came with sincerity and didn’t become angry. He took a deep breath and asked Li Qiye: “What is your thought on this matter, Fellow Daoist?”

“I’m not interested.” Li Qiye smiled in response: “I do appreciate the kind intent, but please leave.”

The Improper Four exchanged glances, thinking that Li Qiye had a strong will to resist the tempting offer. Or maybe, this offer meant nothing to him. Could the little girl be right?

The king needed a moment to regain his composure: “Fellow Daoist, please think about it. We have plenty of time and can come back to it later.”

“No need for that.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively.

His contemptuous tone could be construed as rude but Five-sun King didn’t mind.

“No rush, I’ll await good news from you.” He remained cordial and cupped his fist: “I’ll be taking my leave then.”

He also added before leaving: “You must be tired from extensive traveling, the two ladies here can stay behind to serve you.”

He gestured to the two girls and they bowed toward LI Qiye: “Greetings, Young Noble.”

One of them had an elegant and pleasant voice; the other was enchanting. Five-sun King’s generosity surprised everyone again, delivering two supreme beauties to Li Qiye. Moreover, they came from prestigious backgrounds as well.

The key point was that they were willing to follow Li Qiye. How did he convince them to do so?

“Snow-realm Princess and Silk Valley Lord…” Jian Ming murmured.

It was one thing for them to serve the charismatic Five-sun King - a potential dao lord in the future. After all, dao lords always had plenty of admirers.

Ye Tingrong was astounded after seeing Five-sun King go so far. Moreover, why would these two beauties listen to this ridiculous command without a hint of dissatisfaction?

They were the perfect duo to have as companions as well - one sexy and the other elegant.

“Not interested, return from whence you came, don’t bother me.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand again.

The two beauties stared at Five-sun King, awaiting his command. He cupped his fist and said: “I apologize for bothering you today, let’s meet again later.”

As he was walking out, he stopped and asked Ye Tingrong: “Miss Ye, how is Senior Fist Emperor doing?”

“He’s doing well.” She became tense and responded right away. She couldn’t say that she didn’t know where he was because that would be inauspicious.

“I’ll visit the senior another day to pay respect.” The king said.

“It would be an honor to have you as a guest.” Tingrong bowed slightly.

Five-sun King left the store and his legion left with loud fanfare.

Everyone had their own thoughts after this meeting. It was surprising that the king didn’t try to avenge his fallen father.

“Young Noble, why didn’t you keep those two beauties around? It would be so much more pleasant.” Xiao Xuan winked.

“If I need a maid, I would have plenty of fairies lining up.” Li Qiye smiled and took another sip.

Ye Tingrong had a lot to digest after listening to the conversations today. This broadened her horizon.

“What would happen if you had agreed, Young Noble?” Jian Ming asked. Of course he knew that Five-sun King was not qualified but others would have agreed instantly.

“What is his purpose?” Li Qiye answered with a question.

“To conquer the world.” Jian Ming responded.

“What would you do if you were to meet your father’s killer?” Li Qiye asked again.

“I would die trying to kill him, this is an irreconcilable feud.” Jian Ming said.

“A man willing to drop this feud for his own ambition, what do you think about such a person?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmm…” Jian Ming couldn’t answer right away.

“Vicious and greedy.” The daoist jumped in.

“His talents are good, the same with his methods. Unfortunately, he does not have the qualities of a dao lord and will not become one.” Li Qiye concluded.

“Well, that’s the end of him.” Jian Ming murmured after hearing this.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
