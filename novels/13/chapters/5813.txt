Chapter 5813: I Will Kill You First

“Don’t feign ignorance now, we all know the answer.” Li Qiye smiled: “The question is, haven’t you thought of a perfect solution to solve this issue?”

“Perfect solution?” The trio became confused.

“I will spare you and let you live in Elder Galaxy like before, enjoying its blessings and boundless territories.” Li Qiye said while staring at them: “Given its size, it’s no different from ruling the whole world.”

“What do you want?” They exchanged glances.

“A kind person such as myself knows to not ask for much, just give me the coordinates for Primal Ancestor’s group, then you three will be able to enjoy Elder Galaxy for ages to come, isn’t that wonderful?” Li Qiye said.

“We don’t know what you’re talking about.” They shuddered for a second before refusing.

“Of course.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “When the tribulations descended back then, they became afraid and built a lair, secretive and tough, but I know it is still here in Elder Galaxy’s river. They would never leave their lair so since you have seen them before, you certainly know the coordinates.”

The trio responded with a snort.

“Tell me the coordinates and I will spare you. After all, we have no past grudges.” Li Qiye continued.

Listeners realized that there were reasons why the overlords never chose to come out. They stared at the immortals, wondering if these three would accept the condition.

“Hmph, Celestial Court is not home to traitors, only men who fight honorably until death.” Divine Eternal sneered.

“Ridiculous, traitorous is not enough to describe what your Ancestors did. Tell me, who was in charge of Celestial Court when you were mere foot soldiers? It was Divine Ancestor and how was the world under his reign compared to now? The separation between the nine worlds and thirteen continents, all to hide the truth.” Li Qiye shrugged and said.

“They conspired with Twilight Hunter’s group and devoured Divine Ancestor, so compared to what they did, revealing their coordinates is nothing.” Li Qiye concluded.

Listeners took a deep breath after hearing all these secrets. So Divine Ancestor used to be in charge of Celestial Court? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The truth was that he inherited the epoch after his father went on the expedition. Alas, the other overlords ambushed and devoured his virtually perfect physique.

“Dark Crow, you’re not getting anything out of us. We rather die in battle.” One of them refused.

“You’re making this difficult, but it’s not like there aren’t options. I can capture you three alive and take my time with the torture, or I can open your mind and search for the coordinates.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“I’m afraid you won’t even have the opportunity.” Another uttered coldly.

“Going to explode?” Li Qiye smiled: “It’s rare to see such loyal subjects fighting despite the odds. You three knew that I would come to flatten your epoch yet you remained here. I’m sure you’re also aware your Ancestors don’t give a damn about your life either.”

“Death comes knocking eventually.” Heaven Authority said.

“Unfortunately, you chose the wrong side. Speak or death.” Li Qiye demanded.

“If you can kill us, it just means that we aren’t skilled enough.” Devil Bestowment said.

“Fine, I have said my part. Have it your way, I will kill you first and take my time searching Celestial Court. Patience is my strongest virtue and I have plenty of time in my epoch.” Li Qiye clapped and made up his mind: “The only regrettable thing is that you won’t get to see my killing them.”

“Let’s see what you can do then.” The three immortals slowly grabbed the saber tied to their backs.

Heaven Authority’s saber was transparent and melted into space. Its shape couldn’t be seen clearly. It must have been refined with the spatial affinity - a perfect tool for assassination due to its stealthy nature.

Devil Bestowment’s saber had time flowing around it - looking marvelous compared to Heaven Authority’s invisible saber.

How much time had been used to forge this saber? Tens of millions of years?

Divine Eternal’s saber, on the other hand, froze everyone. They felt their soul flying out of their body and entering the inescapable reincarnation cycles of the saber.
