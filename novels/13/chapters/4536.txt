Chapter 4537: Heaven Devourer Mad God

“To Yin Yang Crossing.” Li Qiye ordered.

“...” The audacious Jian Ming felt a chill coursing down his neck after hearing this.

“The world of the dead, the living isn’t meant to be there.” The daoist said.

“There is a possibility of waking the corpses if we dig up a grave there. The coffin lids won’t be able to stop them.” Wise said with a serious expression.

“Not just a possibility, it is absolutely certain and it will be wild. The entire mountain will be filled with corpses and not just regular zombies, they will include the strongest cultivators in history, those capable of grasping stars and changing the celestials with a single thought…” The daoist said.

“Shit…” Jian Ming’s head shrank down into his neck a little as he spoke: “We can at least kill the living, how do we kill something that’s already dead? I heard people say that those corpses can’t be taken down.”

“Of course, they’re already dead regardless of what you do but they can kill you. Moreover, their power and battle potential aren’t that different from when they were alive.” The daoist said.

“No wonder why even that big shot from Divine Dragon Valley died there.” Jian Ming stated.

“That mad man deserved to die. Arrogant people, such as yourself, will be obliterated after going there.” The daoist said.

This naturally annoyed Jian Ming. He glared at the daoist and then said: “You trying to curse me with bad luck?”

“Of course not.” The daoist smiled: “What I’m saying is that you are comparable to that mad man, both will be remembered in history.”

“You’re finally right for once.” Jian Ming gloated for a bit before realizing that something was wrong: “Wait, are you praising or insulting me?”

“Is it not enough to compare you to Heaven Devourer Mad God? This is a supreme honor, just think about it, how many in history are comparable to him? Only a few and they’re all famous.” The daoist waved his hand.

“True.” Though Jian Ming knew that the daoist was cursing him, the comparison made him feel good.

Wise Ancestor ignored the two since he worried about the bigger picture: “The mad god was insanely powerful, being on the same level as Apex Moon Dao Lord. He never lost to anyone in his life yet met his end in Yin Yang Crossing.”

Heaven Devourer Mad God was a mighty ancestor of Divine Dragon Valley. How should one describe his strength? During his era, he was formidable enough to break the heaven.

He was the senior brother of the valley’s second Dao Lord, Apex Moon. They have fought before and his unbeatable streak remained.

Therefore, the arrogant cultivator feared nothing under the heaven. Thus, he decided to enter the cemetery of Yin Yang Crossing.

This wasn’t considered outrageous during his era since he had beat them all. The result was rather obvious - he caused enough trouble to call out a wave of corpses.

They pushed off the lid and climbed out of their graves - all famous cultivators. There was only one target - Heaven Devourer Mad God.

At the start, he showed his supremacy and repelled the horde. Alas, these mighty corpses were unkillable. Fatigue eventually got the best of him and he couldn’t get out of their containment. The unbeatable cultivator was torn to pieces first then reduced to ashes.

Wise Ancestor shuddered after recalling this tale. Would they be able to escape from the horde of corpses? He had zero confidence because no one has done so, at least not in the historical records.

Heaven Devourer Mad God wasn’t the only one who chose to infiltrate the Yang Cemetery. Many coveted the treasures buried in there, eventually throwing their lives away.

“In the incoming days, the crossing will begin. If we’re lucky enough, Pioneer Ancestor will try to cross too. Maybe we won’t have to enter the cemetery and can meet him at the bridge.” The daoist said.

“That’s not a bad idea.” Jian Ming and Wise Ancestor agreed.

“What if he doesn’t bring the dao stone with him?” However, Jian Ming thought about this potential complication. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The daoist thought about it and said: “Someone who cares enough to bring an item along there will always have it with them. He’ll take it with him for the crossing.”

“Shit, that could be bad too. If we don’t meet him, he might be gone with the stone forever.” Jian Ming said.

“Thank god that he still hasn’t crossed over yet or the dao stone would be gone forever.” Wise Ancestor started sweating.

“Right.” The daoist said: “Anything crossing to the Yin Wheel will disappear forever, perhaps entering the reincarnation cycle.”

“Time is of the essence then.” Jian Ming was serious since this pertained to the prosperity of the four clans.

“Calm down, there is still time before the next crossing. The crossing emissary won’t be there so the dead won’t come out. We need to wait.” The daoist, on the other hand, disagreed.

“I’ve never seen one before.” Jian Ming became curious.

“Yes, the emissary is a specialist in leading the dead from the cemetery.” The daoist said.

Wise Ancestor had witnessed the ferrying process previously and nodded: “The bridge only appears with the emissary, the latter seems to be in control. Once they’re both there, the dead finally come out to try and enter the Yin Wheel.”

“Who is this emissary? Why does he try to cross the dead over?” Jian Ming had many questions.
