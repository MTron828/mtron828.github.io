Chapter 5404: Leave Him There

The group’s attention eventually shifted to a colossal bronze gate - seemingly the entrance to heaven itself.

Emperors of the past stated that beyond the gate were old palaces and vestiges of immortals. Of course, information about the latter was vague and unreliable, often met with skepticism.

Only one thing was confirmed - that Calamity Dao Lord had entered this gate. In history, many top cultivators came to this expanse and stood before the gate.

Alas, they didn’t enter since this was a risky endeavor. Moreover, opening it was no small feat.

“The Gate of Immortal Hall.” Xiao Hu had heard his master talk about this place before: “Also known as the gate of no return.”

“What is in there?” He couldn’t help but ask.

“Don’t bother asking because no one knows.” Ferocity said: “Only one single soul had entered before and has yet to come out.”

“There are immortal halls beyond the gate, they could just be visual phenomena but they’re there.” Li Xian’er interjected.

“You’ve seen them before, Senior?” Xiao Hu became emotional.

“Yes, from a distance. Immortal energy gushed out back then so it was hard to tell reality from illusions.” Li Xian’er nodded.

“And Calamity Dao Lord really didn’t come out?” Xiao Hu asked.

“He did not.” Li Xian’er confirmed.

“His return would shock the world. In my opinion, he’s already dead. This is the general consensus.” Ferocity said.

“He might just be trapped inside.” Li Xian’er shook her head.

“His defense is the best in history, right? If he just hides, he’ll survive anything in there.” Xiao Hu hurriedly added.

“He had too much confidence in his carapace, believing that it was untouchable. When he tried to prop the gate open with his shell, it actually broke down and was crushed.” Ferocity revealed.

“Right, it did not handle the immensity of the gate well.” Li Xian’er said.

“Crushed…” Xiao Hu stared at the gate in disbelief: “So that’s why he can’t come back out.”

“Opening the gate from the inside might be harder given his injuries.” Li Xian’er said.

According to the legends, Calamity Dao Lord’s carapace could stop the mythical pagoda of Immortal Pagoda Conqueror.

Because of this, he had the responsibility to stop this pagoda during any large-scale conflict between the two sides. Otherwise, The People were at a clear disadvantage.

Sure enough, he fought against Immortal Pagoda several times and kept this powerful foe at bay.

He became bored after the Pact of Blessed and ran to Dream Abyss. He decided to open the gate and lay his caparace in the middle, preventing it from closing again. This would allow him to enter and exit without worries.

Alas, his invincible carapace that was immune to all previous attacks only lasted for a short moment. A terrible divinity erupted from the gate and crushed it to pieces.

“I hope that he is still alive in there.” Xiao Hu wanted him to be alive since he was a powerful member of The People.

“It’s a good thing for him to stay in there to grind down his arrogance.” Li Qiye said.

“Young Noble, you can save him, right?” Xiao Hu stared at Li Qiye with hopeful eyes, wanting another apex cultivator on the side of The People.

“No point, he’s doing fine in there and won’t die any time soon.” Li Qiye smiled.

Xiao Hu smiled wryly and thought that maybe a junior like him shouldn’t worry so much about this matter.

“Boom!” A battle between two conquerors suddenly broke out in front of the gate.

“Bam! Bam!” One of them was clearly weaker and stumbled backward after an exchange.

“Ugh…” She vomited a mouthful of blood. Ally dragon lords rushed out from behind and circled around her. The other conqueror didn’t press the issue just yet.

There were other top cultivators and ancient ancestors around, whispering and discussing the battle.

Li Qiye didn’t care for these minor skirmishes until he saw some familiar faces.

The winning conqueror had a celestial aura, looking as if he was born from a galaxy with stars orbiting around him.

“Seven-star Conqueror, Immortal Pagoda Conqueror’s follower.” Ferocity commented.

The losing conqueror was more famous. Everyone in the crowd knew who she was - Jadecure Conqueror.
