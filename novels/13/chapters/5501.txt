Chapter 5502: With Sunset Glow

Li Qiye sighed and said: “Sunset Glow Scripture.”

The current generation couldn’t quite imagine the destruction of Epoch Immemorial War. Behemoths were lucky to survive. Having five or so members left was the blessing of three lifetimes.

Sunset Glow’s fortune drastically increased when Cloudsweep Fairy arrived and chose it as her home. Given her power then, she would have been able to join Immortal Dao City or Imperial Field.

Nonetheless, due to the scripture given to her by Li Qiye, she chose the valley over the others. This was a matter of fate.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Under her leadership, the sect started rising again. Of course, it was still just a ship among a raging ocean known as the immortal continent.

In order to avoid becoming ashes, they maintained their reclusive policies. Thus, people have heard of them but few had the privilege to visit. Some were rather curious because the valley was known for having beautiful female cultivators.

“You know about our scripture, Sir?” The old woman looked surprised.

“A little bit.” Li Qiye smiled.

“As far as I know, our fairy cultivated this scripture alone, not picking anything else.” She said.

“I see.” He commented.

“She came to the immortal continent to find someone, only to stay here at our sect due to fate.” She added.

“Did she find this person?” Li Qiye asked.

“I do not think so, perhaps that person was no longer alive or couldn’t be found. Nonetheless, she was willing to spend her last moments here.” She shook her head.

“Started with Sunset and ended at Sunset.” Li Qiye sighed.

She quietly murmured his line before commenting: “Sir, maybe you could have been friends with our fairy.”

“What makes you say that?” Li Qiye asked.

“I feel that you possess a similar aura, a rather solitary one.” She said.

“I’m just a traveler.” Li Qiye smiled.

She tilted her head in rumination before responding: “Our fairy was most likely the same way. Her heart was not here as she yearned for something else.”

“To have thoughts is to have pursuits.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, the fairy certainly had something in mind. Unfortunately, I don’t think she managed to realize her dream despite waiting patiently. As far as I know, she was content before peacefully passing away.”

“She managed to fulfill destiny, to find a home in Sunset Glow.” Li Qiye said with a tinge of emotion.

“A touch of fate indeed.” She nodded.

Cloudsweep Fairy had a special attachment to the characters, “Sunset Glow”. They brought back memories and yearning. Her journey brought her to the immortal continent but she didn’t find the person she longed for. Although Sunset Glow Valley was not her ultimate goal, she found closure to her story here.

Li Qiye nodded and stared at the statue in silence. The old woman continued lighting up the candles.

Once she was finished, the hall became bright and warm again. Millions of years passed in the blink of an eye; emperors and fairies couldn’t avoid the inevitable.

Nonetheless, some were still remembered and worshipped - a testament to the glorious life they had lived.

Li Qiye closed his eyes and basked in this moment. The candles illuminated and he seemingly turned into a statue.

The old woman left him alone and quietly left the hall. She had done her job of adding warmth to the statues.

Perhaps this was one of the reasons why Cloudsweep Fairy chose to stay here until the very end. The sect didn’t forget their roots and ancestors.

As for Li Qiye, he enjoyed a moment of peace after the recent battles. Although he was an outsider, no one came to bother him. It seemed that they didn’t have a problem with his presence or suspected any malice.

Eventually, a fragrant breeze wafted in due to a female cultivator’s arrival. She knelt beside Li Qiye and paid respect to the ancestors of Sunset Glow. She then focused on the tablet with the ancient runes, wanting to figure out its mysteries.

More time passed and Li Qiye opened his eyes, noticing that she was exceptionally beautiful with striking red lips and expressive eyes. However, there was a dignified air to her, preventing anyone from having impure thoughts. She was dressed in red, accentuating her fiery lips.

“I believe you are the first outside to sit here, Youn Noble.” She said with a slightly mischievous smile.

“It is an honor.” He said.

“Fate has brought you here.” She had a pleasant laughter as well.

“Oh?” Li Qiye was amused by the talkative woman.

“It’s because we have a stealth technique that doesn’t allow anyone to get through yet here you are, Young Noble.” She said.

“It’s quite a big stretch to call it fate.” He said with a smile.
