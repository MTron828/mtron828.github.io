Chapter 4712: Refinement

The cauldron and the formation when used in conjunction unleashed untold destruction within.

Many lineages had formations left behind by dao lords. However, the descendants rarely did a perfect job preparing the arrays.

After all, they didn’t truly understand the formation’s theories on top of lacking practice, resulting in an inability to muster top efficiency.

This didn’t apply to the current scenario. Heavenburn Solar Cauldron helped the paragons prepare the formation, resulting in immaculate arrays. This formation fully contained the profundities of the original version.

The only flaw comparatively was the lack of Five-sun Dao Lord actually being in charge. Nonetheless, the group consisted of the top geniuses in this generation and could still utilize the formation to an exceedingly high level - around seventy to eighty percent. This resulted in a monstrous power capable of refining any sect or kingdom.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Loud bangs came from within the cauldron. It sounded as if Li Qiye was palm-striking the walls repeatedly in order to get out.

Despite being trapped inside, each strike still shook the region and horrified spectators. They thought that he could break out at any second and the blast waves of the attack could obliterate them. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, he suddenly stopped after a few strikes. If it continued, it would have been enough for him to break free. Alas, he seemed to be out of strength.

At the same time, the cauldron became hotter and hotter. Temperatures began escaping the seal and started refining the area nearby.

The exterior of the cauldron turned red. The flames within were just too strong, going as far as potentially melting a dao lord cauldron. This made it clear to everyone the devastation Li Qiye was experiencing.

“He is finished at last.” One spectator said.

“No one can escape that cauldron unless they can break the wall. Unfortunately, it was built by Fie-sun Dao Lord so it’s easier said than done. Moreover, the victim is tortured by the dao flames as well, no time to gather power to break out.” An ancestor whispered.

“He couldn’t break the cauldron earlier and suddenly stopped. He has to be dead.” A high elder said.

“A formation with an accompanying treasure doubling its power. This is countless times stronger than Wild Paragon and his allies’ actual cultivation, maybe ten times or higher. He should have run at the start instead of just standing there.” A big shot said.

“Right, the cauldron is the sole reason for their victory. I think Li Qiye would have won in a regular battle. He simply chose to put himself in an unwinnable situation.” A regional lord commented.

“His recklessness ruined his future, he could have been a brilliant dao lord.” Another said with a tinge of regret.

The majority disagreed with his cockiness in battle. If he had interrupted them during their channeling of the formation, victory would have been his for sure. One misstep resulted in death.

“We did it.” Wild Paragon said while exchanging glances with his allies. No one among the conquerors could have escaped that cauldron. Li Qiye should be no exception.

They heaved a sigh of relief. Eliminating this monster was about to make them famous. Moreover, their lord would have an easier time now. As for Wild Paragon, he also washed himself of the previous humiliation. This was killing three birds with one stone.

“Zzz…” The cauldron became a bright red at this time, on the verge of becoming molten metal. Space and laws were burned and twisted. Ash particles scattered downward and actually melted the ground, leaving deep pits behind.
