Chapter 4209: I, Li Qiye

The once-hated new rich for his arrogance and contemptuous attitude was welcomed by the mass. They hoped to see him unleashing his ability as soon as possible.

In fact, some found his haughtiness to be rather cute at this point. After all, only someone like him would dare to provoke Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel.

He lazed on his palanquin with Princess Ning Zhu and the others waiting on him. Both Peace Ocean Sword King and Void Saint Child couldn’t compare to him in this regard.

Others found this pompous and ostentatious not long ago - the style of a young master with nothing but money.

However, they grew used to it at this point - this should be the traveling entourage of the richest man in the world.

“Can Li Qiye do anything here?” One big shot asked his friends.

After all, he wasn’t facing youths like the Ten Prodigies. Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel and their masters awaited him. This included Earthraiser Vajra and Vastsea Paragon.

This was a force beyond the combined might from the rest of the continent, let alone a single individual.

“I’m ready to witness a miracle. Maybe he’ll go crazy enough that we’ll at least have a chance to look at Myriad Era.” One friend had blind confidence in Li Qiye.

He became the center of attention right away. Some glanced over at Princess Ning Zhu then stole glances at Peace Ocean Sword King with a strange expression.

“I’m sure a fight is inevitable.” One youth whispered: “No man can endure this.”

It wasn’t an outrageous comment. After all, the princess and the king were engaged. She was going to become his wife and the queen of Sea Emperor.

No one expected Li Qiye to come out of nowhere and ruin all of that, taking her away and treating her as a maid.

It was impressive that Peace Ocean hasn’t lashed out yet. He didn’t look angry but his expression was obviously closer than before.

“Sigh, this is a nice area, who is putting up the wall?” Li Qiye lazily waved his hand: “Leave, stop getting in the way.”

“Why should we listen to you? You think too highly of yourself, this isn’t the place for you to give commands.” Void Saint Child laughed and answered before Peace Ocean could.

“And yet I am here commanding you to leave. Don’t wait until I make a move because it will be too late.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What are you going to do if we refuse?” Void became interested in dealing with the world’s richest.

Sure, he had a legion behind him but so did their sects. Invincible masters were also present.

“Sect destruction?” Li Qiye rubbed his chin and mused: “No, that’s too brutal for a merciful person such as myself.”

The crowd thought that Li Qiye was frivolous and careless with his choice of words. It was offensive towards the two behemoths and could end with his death.

On the other hand, Princess Ning Zhu trembled after hearing this. She believed that Li Qiye could actually do so, unlike the rest of the crowd.

“Sect destruction?” Void laughed heartily as if it was the most hilarious thing he had heard: “This is the first time I’ve heard someone talk about destroying our Nine-wheel Citadel. You do know that this comment is deserving of death.”

“The audacity.” Peace Ocean uttered coldly.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Most crowd members became excited since a fun show was about to happen.

Li Qiye started getting up and Princess Ning Zhu immediately supported him. The crowd didn’t know what to say. This young master needing someone else to help him get up wanted to destroy Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel?

Peace Ocean and Void had an ugly expression, viewing Li Qiye’s flippant attitude as an insult to both them and their sect.

“Sigh, what is wrong with society?” Li Qiye stood up and stretched: “An utter disregard for the value of life, preferring to provoke me instead. My benevolence has limits, you know? But I guess when Yama is calling, one has no choice but to answer.”

He walked forward, looking sapped of energy and still drowsy. People thought that he wouldn’t be able to withstand a sudden gust of wind, let alone these two experts.

“How about this, last chance. Leave right now and I’ll pretend nothing happened.” He said while looking at his hand instead of his opponents.

The big shots from both sects didn’t bother answering. Only the two saints were qualified to speak to them. An insect like Li Qiye didn’t warrant a response. The juniors and other experts could chase Li Qiye away without a problem.

“You should have been thanking heaven when I didn’t seek you out yet you choose to court death today.” Peace Ocean said nefariously.

He didn’t pursue the matter of his engagement since it was already finished. He had more important things to take care of.

But now, Li Qiye, the ignorant bastard, came and taunted him. He wouldn’t be so merciful again.
