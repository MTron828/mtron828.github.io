Chapter 5306: Lantern Tribulation

The magical artifact known as Immortal Piercer was used as a simple iron chain, pulverizing three different forces as if they were as fragile as chicken eggs.

The legion of Heaven Alliance, the thirteen dragon lords under Heaven Hammer, and the soldiers of the tower were all battle-hardened warriors. Alas, they stood no chance against Li Qiye’s brutality. The number of eggs didn’t matter when they were being thrown at a rock.

Big shots and famous dragon lords trembled uncontrollably while staring at the carnage. Weaker cultivators lost control of their body. Some ancestors fell butt-first to the ground, traumatized.

“Die!” Xiao Qingtian summoned his twelve sacred fruits, granting him the power to connect with heaven and borrow its power.

He became a god as he channeled the dao to attack Li Qiye. The sky behind him turned into a seal with an unstoppable momentum.

“Immovable Azure!” He roared as he unleashed an attack fully empowered by his sacred fruits.

This was enough to obliterate a country in the blink of an eye. On the opposing side, the chain simply made a slight arc to isolate Li Qiye from all other domains.

The seal scared the hell out of spectators but couldn’t make it through the chain before dispersing.

“Whoosh!” After stopping the seal, the pointed tip at the other end of the chain pierced Qingtian’s chest in an instant.

He didn’t realize what had happened until he looked down due to a sharp pain. He then saw the chain piercing through him, swaying back and forth like a spirit snake.

He decided to abandon his body and attempted a self-implosion so that the true fate along with the sacred fruits could escape.

Unfortunately, this plan didn’t work because the chain prevented the implosion and trapped everything from running away.

“How dare you?!” Heaven Hammer Conqueror leaped forward for a vertical swing.

Space was smashed into nothingness. Chasms appeared on the ground from the sheer pressure. Everything within its area of effect turned to ashes. This was a worthy technique - he didn’t shame his master, Illumination Conqueror.

“Bam!” Sparks splattered everywhere as Li Qiye blocked the hammer with a swing of the chain.

The result was akin to thousands of volcanoes erupting at the same time. The sparks illuminated the sky and temporarily blinded the audience.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The chain somehow destroyed the conqueror’s renowned weapon that had slain numerous dragon lords and armies in the past.

Although it appeared to be a physical contact, the chain sent out enormous energy waves a split second before the actual impact. These waves made short work of the hammer.

“How can this be?!” The crowd bellowed in astonishment.

This hammer was crafted by the conqueror himself using rare metals from outer space. The tempering process included numerous sessions of lightning augmentation, resulting in impressive offensive and defensive potential.

Heaven Hammer had a terrible feeling before joining the fight and reacted quickly by fleeing. Alas, his impeccable speed wasn’t as fast as the chain.

Though he was incalculably far away after a single step, the chain still impaled him by the chest.

“Lantern Tribulation!” Lantern Conqueror no longer considered him an enemy and decided to help.

“Buzz.” He turned into a lantern and appeared above Li Qiye, moving too quickly for the crowd to see his actual transformation.

The lantern tilted and poured oil downward. The candle ignited flames along the pathway, resulting in a fiery torrent.

The intense heat melted time and space around Li Qiye. Everything became distorted and visibility was gone.
