The incoming citadel possessed calamitous potential, able to freeze the gods. It ravaged the sky with a massive imperial aura. Existences trembled for they were mere ants before this power.

Alas, it didn’t earn any respect from Li Qiye. He casually punched and shattered the myriad dao. This baleful strike exceeded anything else, leaving nothing but destruction in its wake.

“Boom!” A terrible blast emanated from the point of impact, resulting in sound waves destroying one star after another.

The fist continued forward through the citadel in an unstoppable manner. The great architecture collapsed in entirety. It absorbed the major brunt of the punch but the remnant shockwave still rushed forward.

“Poof!” Even an Eternal like Bingchi Juezun couldn’t handle it so his hands turned into blood.

The wave sent him flying, bloodied all over while Allbreak reverted to its original form.

This all happened in the blink of an eye due to the speed of the punch.

“Take him down!” Both Calm Lotus Supreme Ancestor and War King joined the fray.

They both utilized their secret words for a total of four, resulting in a magnificent spectacle.

The outcome was an annihilative attack. Everything seemed insignificant and fragile in comparison.

“Boom!” War King’s truncheon looked like a great dragon continuously howling. Its draconic aura ravaged the world. His words poured out an endless flame, allowing him to look sacred and untouchable.

“Clank!” The supreme ancestor’s sword cut down the firmament in a majestic fashion, sweeping through the dao and devils of the ages. Just this slash would allow him to dominate for an eternity. Under the empowerment of his two words, he stood in the sky as if he was the ruler of the universe.

The truncheon smash showed no mercy; the sword slash was just as ruthless. One from the front and the other from the back - more than enough to take anyone down. People would wallow in despair and have no choice but to wash their necks, waiting for the inevitable decapitation and death.

These were two of the strongest Eternals in the system on top of possessing two words each. This duo could conquer the world. One would be hard-pressed to find a single master capable of taking on the two of them at the same time in all of Imperial Lineage.

“That’s all?” Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye. He raised his leg and unleashed a simple vertical kick at the truncheon.

At the same time, he casually unleashed a palm strike towards the slash, nearly blowing away the entire sky.

Both War King and the supreme ancestor became gobsmacked.

“Boom!” The kick sent War King straight to the ground, destroying a massive mountain and eventually creating a huge pit.

“Boom!” On the other side, the supreme ancestor and his sword were blown flying almost like a shooting star. He disappeared into the horizon while vomiting blood, resulting in a red arc.

Just two weaponless moves to defeat these ancestors. The crowd’s mouth opened wide enough to fit a duck egg inside. No one could calm down.

Li Qiye continued to outshine his previous battle feat to their astonishment. Beating Ma Mingchun with one kick was impressive enough, but both War King and Calm Lotus Supreme Ancestor were far stronger than Ma Mingchun. They weren’t on the same level.

Golden Dragon and his peers weren’t surprised at all since they have experienced Li Qiye’s capability. He could definitely do the same to them.

In the eyes of others, they were imperious Eternals. Alas, they were as helpless as babies before Li Qiye.

“Ignorant fools.” Ill Lord uttered. He knew that Li Qiye still didn’t go all out because if he did, not even ashes would be left of his opponents.

War King’s group might be Eternals, but Li Qiye, at the very least, was a progenitor of the immortal level!

This gap was tremendous, so these Eternals couldn’t handle a single blow.

“I can’t believe this...” It took a long time before the crowd composed themselves but clarity only added to the fear.

Everyone started feeling their legs shaking, even the ancestors while the juniors dropped down on their butt.

In their opinion, War King’s group was the strongest in the system with the exception of Lucidity King. Alas, these apex existences still lost to a single move.

They worked their whole life in order to become someone like War King. Unfortunately, a single kick from Li Qiye has erased this dream and left a permanent shadow in their mind.

“How boring, use your secret move already.” Li Qiye basked in the winds, posing with both hands behind his back.

Though he didn’t have an oppressive aura, he had proven himself to be a supreme being above all others.

People no longer had the courage to look straight at him. Some might be scared enough to drop on their knees for a kowtow.

“Boom!” Debris went flying as the bloodied War King got out of the rubble.

At the same time, the supreme ancestor of Calm Lotus has returned from his unwanted trip.

It didn’t take long before the four assumed their initial position to surround Li Qiye. The only difference was their sorry appearance; some were more injured than others.

The atmosphere became tense with the crowd not daring to breathe loudly. Everyone felt suffocated because of Li Qiye’s presence, feeling as if he was stomping down on their chest yet they didn’t have the courage to do a thing about it.

His combatants were pale, not expecting to lose so quickly. They thought that the four of them together would be able to handle ten moves or so regardless of how strong he was. The actual outcome shook them to the core.

“Commendable courage, to actually not run away at this time and still wanting to take me down.” Li Qiye cast a glance at the four. He paused for a moment before adding: “Of course, very foolish as well.”

None of them retorted or showed any anger. They were completely focused on the fight. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

A while ago, their anger stemmed from arrogance and pride in being Eternals. Such feelings have been smashed by his punch and kick earlier.
