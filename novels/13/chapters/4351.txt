Chapter 4352: Immortals Might Exist

This was great news for the members of Little Diamond. It guaranteed their safety for the time being.

The heir of Lion’s Roar could represent both the kingdom and the royal clan. His words carried ample weight and influence.

Thus, no other sects in the south would dare to touch them. This included Dragon. The promise was indeed a cause for celebration.

“I wonder if your future descendants will be as smart as you.” Li Qiye was very pleased with Chi Jinlin.

“I will do my best to remember your guidance and pass it on, Sir.” Jinlin bowed.

“No need for that.” Li Qiye waved and said: “Your kingdom’s current achievements are due to the protection of your ancestors and the wisdom of their descendants. Don’t worry about the future because no one can outlast the test of time. Rise and fall are inevitable and natural.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jian Qingzhu repeated the last phrase in her head and then added: “But cultivators like us seek everlasting life.”

“That notion can be disastrous.” Li Qiye chuckled: “This is especially apparent for those at a higher realm with inadequate intelligence.”

“I don’t understand, Young Noble. Please enlighten me.” She bowed and asked.

It was interesting that she maintained her level of respect despite her sect being at odds with Li Qiye. Her sect master was ready to take his life.

“It’s simple.” He replied: “Those who seek everlasting life will eventually become monsters, going against the natural order and the heaven's will. They will inflict nothing but disasters.”

“Monsters?” The duo didn’t expect this answer.

In their impression, everlasting life meant being buried underground for a long time. They included peerless ancient ancestors and supremes.

These beings were priceless pillars for the top sects. To have one around meant having an unshakeable foundation. This allowed them to prosper.

Because of this, powerful ancient ancestors came up with numerous methods to live longer, whether it be for personal reasons or for the sake of their sect.

However, Li Qiye considered them monsters. This was an unfamiliar perspective for the duo.

“Please go on, Sir.” Chi Jinlin found this topic rather serious. Lion’s Roar had several ancient ancestors potentially slumbering in their ancestral ground.

He himself had no idea how many there were. These beings lived reclusively and didn’t need future generations to know about their existence.

“Why does one seek to have everlasting life?” Li Qiye asked.

Jinlin hesitated for a moment before answering: “To live longer?” The answer seemed rather obvious.

“Why does one wish to live longer? For what reason will you or another cultivator abandon all else to live longer?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Well…” Jinlin had no response. He never interacted with his ancient ancestors before. They never told the descendants about the reason.

Jian Qingzhu answered instead: “The wise sages certainly have their reason for wanting to live longer. It is above the comprehension of insects like us.”

“There is a price for everything.” Li Qiye stared at her: “The price is especially expensive when one goes against the heaven since it invokes the heaven’s wrath.”

“What price do you speak of?” Jinlin asked.

“To the point where the price no longer matters. By any means necessary.” Li Qiye revealed.

“Could you elaborate on a potential scenario…?” Qingzhu pondered for a bit before trembling once. She had a bad feeling when discussing this topic.

“You’re very smart.” He said: “The truth is that it exceeds your current imagination right now. Even your boldest speculation isn’t bold enough.”

She contemplated the possibility. By any means necessary?

“The immortal strokes my head and binds my hair, granting me everlasting life.” Li Qiye answered with a well-known phrase instead.

Qingzhu immediately thought of Blessed Dao Lord after hearing this. This was a popular phrase from the mortal world but it also aptly described the dao lord’s experience.

According to the legends, Blessed Dao Lord taught the world the seven mantras. Rumor has it that these mantras came from an immortal.

Of course, people had no way of verifying this. Nonetheless, the character “Blessed” indicated that he was taught by an immortal.

“So maybe immortals do exist.” Chi Jinlin murmured.

Normal cultivators had never met immortals before. Thus, no one believed that immortals were real, or at least, none were in the mortal world.

This wasn’t the case for Chi Jinlin. His royal clan was one of the oldest forces in Eight Desolaces.

They had access to information unavailable to outsiders. This included stories about immortals.

In fact, the clan believed that some of their ancestors had ties with an immortal before. The details remained unknown. They speculated that it could be their Supreme Monarch or Golden Lion Emperor.

Their clan has been around for many years even before the rise of Golden Lion Emperor. However, his reign led them to prosperity and established a strong foundation. This made them one of the strongest kingdoms in all of Eight Desolaces.

Lion’s Roar wouldn’t have the same achievements today without his leadership and effort. He was considered to be their most successful ruler, hence the speculation of him being taught by an immortal.

The disagreeing party speculated that the Supreme Monarch was the more likely candidate.

There was a particular nuance here. The monarch and emperor were actually brother and sister. However, the monarch has always been in isolated cultivation. She didn’t show herself even after the death of Golden Lion Emperor.

It wasn’t until the great calamity that she shocked the world with her might and overshadowed the other masters.

Thus, though they were born in the same generation, they didn’t live in the same timeline. Because she managed to live for so long, the royal clan thought that she must have gotten guidance from the immortal.

Of course, there are some who believed that both of them have been taught by the immortal, albeit different things.

These mysteries of the royal clan made Chi Jinlin believe that there might really be immortals.
