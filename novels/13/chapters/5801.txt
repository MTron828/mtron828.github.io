Chapter 5801: My Ancestor Created The Myriad Dao

“You’ll see them soon enough if you continue on this path.” Profound said.

Li Qiye clapped in response: “That’s perfect since I want to chop off their dog head as well. What I’m afraid of is their cowering and hiding in their cave still.”

“Sacred Teacher, quite an exaggeration there, our Ancestors are supremes who have shaped this world and created an epoch, they are beyond your imagination.” Hao Hai barked back. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“High praises, have you met them before to see how supreme they are?” Li Qiye smiled.

All eyes were on Hao Hai since most have yet to see the founder and the three immortals, let alone the Ancestors.

Light-dragon and other important members have met the founder and the three immortals, but not the supreme overlords. Perhaps Nether, Sword, Profound, and Hao Hai had the privilege since they had the highest authority in the absence of the reclusive masters.

“Primal Ancestor’s attainment is unfathomable, and all of them are omnipotent and omnipresent.” Nether Emperor said.

“Sounds like you haven’t even met them, they merely sent you telepathic messages or something else.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“We have received their graces and act as their emissaries, there is no need for messages.” Hao Hai said.

“I got it, so they can take over your body, not rare at all. Don’t you remember what happened to Brilliant Devil Emperor? How miserable, you can explode at any time.” Li Qiye said.

“It is no longer the case, Sacred Teacher. We can endure their descent.” Sword said.

“I wonder about that, but don’t worry, they won’t dare to descend at all, probably already thinking about running.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sacred Teacher, the supreme Ancestors are older than you, they pioneered the epoch, methods for cultivation, and crafting techniques.” Hao Hai said.

“Sounds like your Ancestor is Stonesplitter Patriarch so you were given Divine Beast.” Li Qiye smiled: “But Stonespliltter is bad at cultivation, only skilled at crafting. He must have traded something for the weapon from Voracious Leviathan.”

“Sacred Teacher, everything pertaining to crafting and blacksmithing originated from the Ancestor. Just one weapon from him could change the tides, so your comment is unwarranted.” Hao Hai defended.

“Change what tides? I can kill him in a second if he dares to show up. Don’t worry, they’ll disappoint you all by continuing to be turtles hiding in their shell.” Li Qiye said.

“Utter nonsense. My Ancestor is one with the myriad dao, capable of deciphering all nine Heavenly Treasures, he is not afraid of you, Sacred Teacher.” Profound couldn’t help but interject.

“Dao Ancestor, I see, yes cultivating all nine scriptures to grand completion is amazing indeed.” Li Qiye admitted.

Listeners became excited after hearing this. The nine scriptures were considered supreme to the emperors yet Dao Ancestor finished cultivating all nine? Who would be able to stop him? Not even Li Qiye.

“Listen, your Trinity Ancestor never gave a damn about Dao Ancestor, just a brat who copied others, cultivating from a few scrolls with no contribution to the epoch, no special views on the grand dao, merely repeating what is known. His words, not mine.” Li Qiye finished.

“You!” Profound turned pale from rage.

“Don’t get angry at me.” Li Qiye smirked: “This came from the progenitor of your epoch, feel free to ask your Dao Ancestor if you don’t believe me. Trinity called him a poor fellow who picked up some random old books and treated them as treasures, his Ultimate realm is ultimate in making zero contribution to the dao.”

“Sacred Teacher, this is too much.” Profound angrily complained.

“I’m just repeating what Trinity Ancestor said, I’ve even kept it relatively polite.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Listeners exchanged glances. Given his achievements, Dao Ancestor certainly stood at the apex of their epoch. However, Trinity Ancestor still didn’t give a damn about him? Just how powerful was this Trinity Ancestor?

“Hmph, baseless conjectures stemming from unreliable legends.” Sword Emperor said: “My Ancestor created the myriad dao and cultivation methods. No one can compare to him.”

“Oh?” Li Qiye smiled: “So your backer is Imperial Progenitor of Myriad Realms. Don’t be so quick to celebrate. Just because he gave you a talisman doesn’t mean he’ll care about your survival.”

“Sacred Teacher, the Ancestor survived the ages and killed numerous masters, he is afraid of no one.” Sword said.

“From what I heard when Trinity Ancestor was around, your Imperial Progenitor didn’t dare to fart in his presence. He even asked Trinity Ancestor for help with creating the new cultivation method, only to be criticized for having terrible ideas.” Li Qiye said.

“Sigh, I don’t believe you.” Sword said.

“Don’t be so dejected though, this is just Trinity Ancestor’s personality, never giving a damn about anyone. He was born with an inborn dao chaos physique and an inborn trinity true soul. His problem was being unlucky to meet the geezers in Heavenrealm too early and having his dao heart broken, it doesn’t change the fact that your Ancestors are nothing compared to him.” Li Qiye said.
