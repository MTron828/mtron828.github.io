Chapter 4859: Eight-stallion Dynasty

All members of the dynasty knew that the dao lord was everything to the dynasty. Their home was created because of him. Without his presence, they would have become prey to the bandits or become bandits themselves.

Thus, his death instilled untold sorrow and grief in everyone.

“Your Majesty!” Some couldn’t help smashing their forehead against the ground as his coffin was passing through the street.

An aura suddenly emerged from afar - carrying the intensity of a marching army or looming dark clouds, not the best feeling to have.

It came from an old man in battle armor. His cloak fluttered gallantly to the wind. Despite his old age, he was still as vigorous as a tiger. The gleaming battle intent in his eyes could make anyone shudder. This was a general who had partaken in countless battlefields.

Dragon roars could be heard due to his cultivation. Beasts and animals would immediately kneel to show their subservience.

“Your Majesty!” He kneeled before the coffin and let the tears flow: “I wish I could have been there by your side…”

He had followed the dao lord for a lifetime yet couldn’t see him during his last moment.

His title was Venerable Dragon God, the grand commander and second in command of Eight-stallion. He was in charge in the dao lord’s absence, beneath one man but above the rest.

The dao lord trusted him and most importantly, he was powerful enough to shoulder this responsibility.

He was a dragon lord with five sacred fruits - enough to fight anyone in the lower continents. The members of the dynasty respected and feared him, the same for his enemies. He also commanded the main legion of the dynasty in times of war - Soaring Stallions.

The dao lord told him to preside over the dynasty before heading off to battle with Conceal Conqueror. This was to avoid others from taking advantage of the situation.

The dragon lord felt great pain standing before the coffin despite having guessed the result. Reality still struck him hard.

After showing sufficient respect to the dead, he stood up and told Firerage: “Guard Commander, the journey must have been difficult.”

Everyone understood how tough it must have been. Escorting the coffin back was easier said than done.

“It is my duty.” Firerage said while still sticking close to Li Qiye.

The dragon lord then noticed Li Qiye and the imperial seal. The look in his eyes changed.

He then took a closer look at Li Qiye and didn’t notice anything special.

“He is…?” He asked Firerage and could tell that Firerage was protecting the man.

“Now’s not the time, let’s welcome His Majesty back first.” Firerage said seriously, aware that the situation might be tough for Li Qiye - a stranger inheriting the dynasty.

For example, if the dragon god were to refuse, it would be a big problem. This wasn’t the time to announce it.

“Right.” The dragon god agreed despite having many questions.

“Welcome His Majesty!” He commanded and sad songs began to play from various instruments. The coffin was then taken to the mourning hall.

Firerage escorted Li Qiye the entire time during the ceremony. The latter smiled while taking a look at the scenery.

“Your Highness, you will be staying there for the incoming days.” Firerage pointed ahead.

Before them was a strange peak. It seemed to have been broken off by the halfway point by someone, leaving behind only the bottom. The crack wasn’t clean either, possessing a crisscross characteristic instead.

A magnificent palace was built on top of it, looking like the regal abode of a ruler. Its name was Eight-stallion Hall, the home of the dao lord and a place for conducting ceremonies.

Firerage purposely arranged this to be Li Qiye’s place in order to confirm Li Qiye’s status.

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye smiled while staring at the peak.

“His Majesty used to live here. It is also the source of the dynasty. As far as I know, His Majesty dragged this peak down here from space.” Firerage elaborated. The peak was obviously special since the dao lord was rumored to put in painstaking effort bringing it back.

Alas, no one knew its effect, only that it represented the authority of the dynasty. This was Firerage’s way of letting everyone know.

The problem was that Li Qiye was neither the dao lord’s son nor a successor. No one would support a stranger taking over the dynasty. He needed to set Li Qiye up first.

The first visitor to Li Qiye’s new home was none other than Venerable Dragon God. Firerage saw his arrival and became anxious.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Li Qiye needed Venerable Dragon God’s support for a successful coronation. Just having the imperial seal was not enough.

“Who are you? Where are you from?” The dragon god scanned Li Qiye again, wanting to find some clues.

He didn’t understand why the king chose this stranger to be the new ruler.

“Dragon God, please use ‘Your Highness’. His Highness is our successor.” Firerage stood next to Li Qiye with one hand on the saber hilt.

He knew that the dragon god could easily kill him. Nonetheless, he must protect Li Qiye’s authority and prestige. Death was acceptable since this was His Majesty’s last wish.

“Guard Commander, do you know his background?” The dragon god asked.

“I am carrying out His Majesty’s wish of appointing His Highness as the next successor.” Firerage said.

“May I take a closer look at your physical constitution?” The dragon god’s tone became more polite, wanting to see Li Qiye’s body.

After all, an invincible dao lord wouldn’t pass his dynasty down to just anyone.
