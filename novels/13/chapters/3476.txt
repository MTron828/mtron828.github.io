Heaven fell and the earth suffered from this battle; the celestials lost their shine. A storm of blood and corpses rained down the area. Heads rolled on the ground like pumpkins.

The ancestors from the other side didn’t relent against the experts of the two behemoths. They were willing to fight to the death.

This wasn’t only because of Li Qiye and the treasures. It also pertained to dominion over the north.

Currently, Yin Yang, Skylight, and Firmaments were undoubtedly the strongest sects. Many others had conflicts or even small-scaled wars with them previously. This usually ended with the three being the victor.

Today, the other powers have gathered together - quite a rare occurrence. Thus, this became a catalyst to an all-out battle due to past animosity.

They were preoccupied and forgot about Li Qiye. Thus, this left room for the cultivators who only wanted to spectate at the start. They had an opening to seize the treasury from Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” Loud blasts suddenly came from the horizon. A flood of steel suddenly emerged from the distance, enough to shock everyone including the busy combatants.

They looked up and saw billowing dust emanating from a great army with unstoppable momentum. There might be a million troops or so.

It consisted of golem giants; some had a bright pulse around their body. Another was a mixed-blood with a head seemingly made out of jade...

The mighty army affected the land itself, not just the battlefield. Their vitality surged like a primordial flood, capable of engulfing the world.

This naturally frightened the hell out of everyone. Their legs shuddered from just feeling the army’s momentum and aura.

The combatants on the battlefield stopped their deathmatch and backed off right away.

“Golems from Ancestral City.” Some turned pale at this sight. Everyone finally got a good look at the power of Ancestral City and the golems.

“So powerful.” Others took a deep breath.

They finally realized that this was the stone forest belonging to Ancestral City. Gathering and fighting here meant not giving the golems any face.

“They’re stronger than expected.” Even the elite cultivators became nervous.

This army could completely crush everyone right now. The armies of the three behemoths couldn’t come close to stopping it.

Skylight and Firmaments’ members became afraid, realizing that a direct confrontation was foolish.

Ancestral City had two dao lords before and kept a low-profile compared to the prominent Yin Yang Gate.

This often misled people on its power, thinking that it was inferior to Yin Yang Gate or even Skylight. This certainly didn’t look like it was the case right now.

“Neigh-” A war-horse neighed with an impressive presence. A cavalry led the way for this army.

“Pearlstone Saintess!” People recognized the leader.

She looked both kingdom-toppling and heroic, not inferior to any general. The duality of femininity and masculinity made her irresistibly enchanting.

Everyone held their breath as she led the army of the golems to battle.

“Ancestral City is not a place to settle your personal feuds nor is it a ground for killing.” She glared at the outsiders and coldly uttered: “All armies, immediately leave the city’s limits!”

She was as direct as can be, leaving no room for questioning.

Everyone exchanged glances first before staring at Li Qiye. The duck was already cooked so they didn’t want to miss the feast. Alas, it was abundantly clear that this army from Ancestral was unstoppable.

“This brutal butcher slaughtered 100,000 men from our three sects.” The national teacher of Skylight pointed at Li Qiye and said: “Let us bring him and we’ll leave right away, we’ll apologize in the future.”

“The young master is our esteemed guest. Don’t even think about it while being in our territory.” The saintess refused right away.

Her firm response and strong attitude naturally surprised the crowd.

“Saintess, our sects are in-laws. We should stand together when dealing with enemies and ridding the world of evil.” An ancestor finally showed up from Yin Yang’s camp.

He carried more weight than most due to his position at Yin Yang Gate.

“Elder Jun.” The saintess replied: “Since you have brought this up, I’ll formally announce that the marriage pact between Yin Yang and Ancestral is now annulled.”

“What?!” Everyone clamored after hearing this, thinking that they have misheard.

“How sudden, this doesn’t make any sense.” Confusion struck the mass. Even the ancestor from Yin Yang became stunned.

A formal marriage pact between two sects was a big deal, especially this particular one. Making the wrong moves here might result in deep animosity and long-lasting wars.

This was unwise because a war between two behemoths was calamitous.

“What’s going on? A disagreement shouldn’t be enough to tear the pact.” A knowledgeable ancestor in the audience wondered.

He knew that in the past, Ancestral City had two separate factions on this matter. The objectors said that their sect didn’t need to resort to a marriage alliance to consolidate their status.

As for the supporters, they wanted a powerful bloodline. Two bloodlines together could give birth to something even more incredible.

Initially, this alliance was a failure. Alas, Pearlstone Saintess’ ancestors from her own clan pushed for it hard enough. That’s why her decision today shocked everyone.

“Saintess, is this your decision or Ancestral’s? It’s not a matter you can decide on your own.” The Yin Yang ancestor asked.

If she was being impulsive right now, Yin Yang Gate could still forget this.

“Both.” She said decisively. Her unfriendly tone meant that Ancestral City wanted to separate themselves from Yin Yang Gate. This wasn’t just a simple annulment.

“I need to see Elder Shi.” The ancestor demanded.

“No need.” An ancient voice answered him: “This is the end to the marriage agreement. Young Lord Bai can come and we’ll give him an appropriate answer.”

“Ancestor Lu.” Others cried out. He was another influential ancestor from Ancestral.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
