Chapter 5065: Let’s Go See An Egg

“What about the other divine beasts? Are they still in this place?” Ming Shi asked.

Li Qiye closed his eye to sense this world. After a while, he opened them and smiled: “Very well, I will let you two take a look.”

“Yes!” Both became excited including the experienced dragon lord. She also wanted to witness living legends.

Li Qiye took them to a peak with a towering tree. They were immediately greeted by an impressive amount of chaos true energy.

This aura could last forever without ever waning. Tendril King had a difficult time withstanding it, let alone Ming Shi.

In reality, she had no chance of climbing up the tree without following right behind Li Qiye. The sheer pressure alone could have reduced the two women to blood in the blink of an eye.

They heard thunderous explosions stemming from the lightning bolts coursing through the leaves. Tendril King could tell how feeble she was when facing just a single bolt.

After a challenging climb, they finally reached the pinnacle of the tree where they discovered a bird nest. It was shrouded in clouds and mist, large enough to be a kingdom.

The lack of invisibility was due to an ocean of lightning bolts hovering above it. It poured down from the nest like waterfalls and eventually turned into lightning currents.

The nest was formed by the twisting branches of the tree - something which the monarch had never seen before due to its ancient age.

The moment she touched them, she gained a considerable boost in power. This nest had the power to harmonize with the dao, allowing an unlimited creation of power.

Thus, just staying in the nest was enough to grow stronger - there was no need for active cultivation.

“It’s divine…” She murmured. As a vine herself, she had a heightened sensitivity to the nest. She then turned her attention beyond the mist and saw a golden egg at the very center.

It was as bright as the sun and issued loud crackles. The shell had archaic runes of the lighting affinity.

Whenever a crackle occurred, the two women’s grand dao would resonate and erupt back. Their fate palaces appeared outside of their control and derived the grand dao.

They were shocked because this was an entirely new experience. 

“This is the egg of a divine best?” Ming Shi asked.

“Gestated by the power of heavenly lightning and grand dao, only a divine beast can come to the world in this manner.” Tendril King said with admiration.

“You’re slightly off here, it is not being gestated by the power of lightning, it is emitting it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“It is producing this much energy already?” Both women became startled.

“That is why it is a divine beast, born to be matchless. At full maturity, it will be the lord of the worlds.” Li Qiye said.

They took a deep breath. This creature was monstrous even in this egg form; no other living beings could catch up.

This was the reason why everyone coveted the divine bloodlines, especially the demons.

“Can we adopt it?” Ming Shi smiled and said.

“Boom!” A golden detonation answered her, akin to a giant stomping down with enough force to crush dragon lords.

“Hmph.” Li Qiye scowled. His voice alone destroyed everything including the golden explosion.

The powerful egg trembled in fear after seeing this, no longer daring to act imperiously. As for the two women, they couldn’t believe it. That explosion could have reduced them to dust if it wasn’t for Li Qiye’s protection.

“So this is a divine egg.” Tendril King murmured. The world had several “divine eggs” appearing before. None came close to this level.

“It’s not that simple to adopt one. Even someone who has the ability to adopt won’t be able to take care of it, this is a grand fortune capable of seizing the wonders of heaven and earth. It is more of a disaster than a blessing.” Li Qiye said.

“I see, I definitely can’t take good care of it.” Ming Shi said.

“I wonder what the War Monarch’s divine egg is like.” Tendril King commented on the rumor of that clan obtaining an egg from the nest. Was that one comparable to this golden egg?nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“We’re leaving, this egg is not something the lower continents can handle.” Li Qiye only brought them here to broaden their horizon and had no intention of taking the egg.

As they were leaving, the egg issued metallic sounds, seemingly bidding goodbye.

“It’s sentient already.” Ming Shi said.

“It is a true divine egg, exceedingly rare even back in its epoch. In fact, it somehow managed to survive the destruction, this is a sign of its supremeness.” Li Qiye said, elaborating on how special it was to the two women.

They left the tree and went to another scenic location. Ming Shi and Tendril King were captivated by a scene that should only exist in the paintings.

The land was engulfed in divinity and light. The source came from a snow-white beast with runes exuding the holy affinity.
