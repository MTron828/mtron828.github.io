Chapter 5183: Blushing

Alchemy Dao felt as if they were facing a serious threat - a stranger coming to ask for their Exalted Cascade Lotus in such a direct manner.

The man was either crazy or extremely powerful. Thus, the disciples were rather nervous and tense.

“Fellow Daoist, if Alchemy Dao had offended you in some way, we apologize and will do our best to amend the issue.” One disciple took a deep breath and said.

“It’s nothing like that, I just need a lotus flower.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

The disciples heard this and exchanged glances. They then discretely surrounded him.

Li Qiye saw this and said: “You’re making it difficult for me, I will leave after getting one flower, no need for escalation.”

“Fellow Daoist, don’t you know what the Exalted Cascade Lotus is?” A disciple asked.

They didn’t know that Li Qiye was already showing restraint. Otherwise, he would have just taken the flower without asking first.

“I need something to get rid of inauspicious energy in a courtyard. Coincidentally enough, your lotus flower is the closest.” Li Qiye said.

The disciples nearly vomited breath. Using their hallowed flower to get rid of some bad luck? The guy doesn’t know that this is a priceless treasure?ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Thus, they viewed it as a deliberate insult and their expression darkened.

“Enough of this! Who do you think you are?! To actually insult us like this!” Another group came forward, led by a youth wearing expensive clothes to show off his status.

“First Brother!” The members of the sect bowed after seeing him.

He was none other than Miracle Saint Child - a famous cultivator throughout the upper continents due to his alchemy and medicinal prowess. Despite being young, he had the ability to heal dragon lords.

“Who are you?!” He asked aggressively.

Pride was inevitable for a young man enjoying so much success in life. Even dragon lords showed him respect so he had never been afraid of anyone.

Other disciples reported about an outsider wanting to pluck their ancestral lotus. This caused him to rush over to the entrance with haste.

Despite the intimidating bear, he wasn’t that afraid of an ordinary-looking fella like Li Qiye.

“Just a visitor wanting to take a flower.” Li Qiye smiled.

The saint child stared intensely at Li Qiye, wondering if this person’s cultivation could back up his bold demand.

“The ancestral lotus is our legacy. Leave or don’t blame us for hurting you.” The saint child uttered coldly, still showing restraint.

“I’m afraid I can’t obey since I must have the flower.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Ignorant fool!” The saint child unsheathed his sword, releasing its cold aura.

The others readied their weapon as well, ready to attack if Li Qiye were to make any sudden move.

“It is not too late to leave or your corpse will be on the ground.” Miracle Saint Child asserted.

Li Qiye looked at them and sighed: “Here I am trying to be nice due to old sentiments. Looks like blood must flow then.”

“Wait, stop!” A girl rushed over and shouted.

All eyes were on her - Saintess Shao Yao.

“Young Noble.” The moment she saw Li Qiye, she immediately bowed and had to restrain her excitement.

“Senior Sister.” The others bowed to greet her because her status was similar to the saint child’s.

“Junior Sister, he is your friend?” The saint child remained aggressive.

“Senior Brother, he is a benefactor who saved my life before.” Shao Yao responded.

“Hmph, even then, he was rude to our sect. That is a serious crime.” The saint child said, not giving her any face.

Despite being fellow sect members, they were actually rivals for the successor spot. Everyone knew about the animosity between the two.

“I will report this matter to my master and she will make a decision. You need not trouble yourself, Senior Brother.” She bowed slightly.

The saint child glared at Li Qiye and said: “Tell your benefactor to watch himself. No more blasphemous comment.”

He turned and left after saying this. After all, her master was Jadecure Conqueror whose words were the laws here.

With her as Li Qiye’s companion, the other disciples stopped blocking the way.

“Young Noble, may I ask why you are here?” She stole a glance at him, blushing.

“I need a lotus flower.” He answered.

“The exalted flower?” She became surprised.

“That’s the one.” He nodded, leaving her speechless.

“May I ask for the reason why?” She calmed down after a while.

“My courtyard has some unlucky presence, I need one flower to chase it away.” He repeated.

She recalled how he was able to summon numerous king medicines with a single whistle on top of gifting her a precious flower. Thus, this didn’t seem that ridiculous.

“It is our priceless legacy.” She quietly answered.

“That’s why I am asking.” Li Qiye smiled.
