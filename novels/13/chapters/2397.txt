Mu Shaochen took a deep breath and sneered: “Li, this is your last day to act arrogant. So what if you are strong? You won’t be able to kill that heart devil since it will grow stronger and stronger after devouring all of Vermillion. Your demise is soon, I’ll be waiting for you to groan and beg.” He laughed boisterously after stating this.

Li Qiye shook his head: “Just a frog under a well. One heart devil is enough for you to be this complacent? In my eyes, not to mention this thing, Martial Ancestor himself would make no difference being here.”

“Arrogant fool, you don’t know how terrorizing a progenitor can be...” Mu Shaochen’s expression darkened.

Li Qiye quickly interrupted him: “Just a progenitor, not a true immortal. Only a true immortal is really invincible, the same can’t be said about the former.”

“You!” Shaochen was speechless because he has never seen someone making such a bold statement before. Who would dare to look down on progenitors, especially in such a nonchalant manner?

“Senior, please save our Vermillion, we will do our best to repay you.” Dracoform himself started beseeching.

At this juncture between life and death, even the proud Dracoform had no choice but to lower his head and ask Li Qiye for assistance. He no longer had the power to fight and couldn’t come up with another plan outside of this in order to save his martial court.

Personal reputation and honor were nothing if he could save his system.

Everyone stared at Li Qiye, not feeling surprised about Dracoform’s request. After all, it looked like Fiercest was the only one who could take down the heart devil. Thus, it made sense for someone with certain priorities like Dracoform to ask his enemy for help.

“However, that brat Mu is right about one thing.” Li Qiye smiled: “Killing that heart devil won’t be easy. More importantly, it has become a part of your Vermillion system, to kill it means that your system will fall into declination.”

Dracoform froze, aware of this implication. Many systems, once declined, never could rise back up again until total collapse. Perhaps Vermillion Martial Court will not exist in the future.

“Declination is still better than destruction, please help us, Senior.” Dracoform gritted his teeth.

He wanted to protect Vermillion at any price, even if it meant kneeling and begging Li Qiye.

“It’s not impossible. Come from one place, return to that place. I can indeed make it return to your system, but I am missing a catalyst to fuse it back to the land.” Li Qiye said.

Dracoform stared at the broken land before him, nothing but silence and sadness. His heart ached so he made up his mind: “I will be that catalyst, go for it, Senior.” He got on his knees with a solemn expression.

He wanted to sacrifice himself. Plus, this disaster stemmed from him in the first place so he needed to end it. He was already a sinner so his life was worthless. At least he could contribute something to Vermillion now. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Hand me the truncheon.” Li Qiye reached out.

Dracoform threw the truncheon at Li Qiye without any hesitation. Li Qiye caught it and did a test swing.

“This is Martial Dao Truncheon exists as a sealing tool, not just because it has the twelve variations.” Li Qiye said.

The heart devil took one step back after seeing this. It didn’t give a damn when Dracoform was using it and even used its bare hand to stop the blow.

It was because Dracoform didn’t understand the mysteries of the truncheon, unable to use its real power.

This was no longer the case with Li Qiye. The heart devil immediately felt a terrible potential, a murderous intent that could pierce through its heart.

Keep in mind that Martial Ancestor crafted this truncheon specifically to suppress his heart devil. Only those who could use its real power could truly trap this heart devil. Otherwise, someone as powerful as Dracoform still couldn’t do anything.

Li Qiye casually pointed the truncheon at the heart devil and smiled: “Be a good boy and give up or do I have to make you?”

‘That’s Fiercest for you, daring to call this heart devil a good boy.’ The crowd thought.

“Ra!” The heart devil roared. The darkness amplified and came together, causing it to grow in size.

It stood there like a giant looking down on the world. Just its palm alone seemed enough to destroy the martial court.

“Pointless struggle, you’re no longer as strong as before but even if you were, it is meaningless before me.” Li Qiye shook his head, acting like it was no big deal.

His relaxed attitude took the crowd by surprise. They were lost in admiration since only Fiercest could act like this in the world.

The devil began opening its mouth towards Vermillion for another devouring attempt.

“Watch out, he’s absorbing!” Many shouted in horror.

“Be careful!” Dracoform was shocked as well. The monster had devoured one million miles of land with the last gulp so it became much more powerful.

Perhaps it could easily do ten million miles this time around. Just several more attempts and their entire system would be done for.

“It’s unfortunate that your opponent is me.” Li Qiye smiled and spread his palm in a natural manner. It seemed to be breaking the order of the world.

His palm came from the ancient past before the inception of the world. It crossed through time and space, releasing endless chaos. This chaos derived supreme laws that wove together to form the first word. This grand dao was unique and supreme.

“Boom!” The word imprinted itself above the ground of Vermillion in a dazzling manner. Just like that, the dao system seemed to be held down and stabilized.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” Crazy gales swept past the place with enough force to cut mountains by the waist.

Alas, a miracle had happened. The devil continued to suck in but the system wasn’t touched this time around.

Earlier, worldly essences and lives would instantly be drained dry and devoured because the creature had the same origin as the system. Nothing could stop that process earlier, until now.

Li Qiye used the word of his Finality Sword, a supreme word from a heavenly scripture, the real origin of Martial Ancestor. It was older than his grand dao, older than the dao source of Vermillion, and certainly older than this devil heart. It was the true and strongest origin.

Thus, its sealing prevented the heart devil from absorbing further worldly essences.

“What...” Everyone became slack-jawed in disbelief as they watched the devil’s ineffectiveness.
