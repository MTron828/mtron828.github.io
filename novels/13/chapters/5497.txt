Chapter 5498: Focus Up

“Young Master, what the hell? You’re just picking up a corpse, is all of this necessary?” Niu Fen who was waiting outside couldn’t believe his own eyes.

His defensive ability was perhaps the best in the upper continents. Alas, his legs trembled due to the spectacle before him.

“Boom!” Meanwhile, Li Qiye imbued a branch and a leaf into Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo’s body.

“Return to the heaven!” He shouted while channeling primordial energy and dao essence into the body.

Meanwhile, the furious high heaven continued sending down tribulations. This naturally scared the hell out of all inhabitants on the immortal continent.

They had no idea what was done to justify this level of response from the high heaven. The ancient emperors and monarchs have witnessed tribulations in the past.

Alas, these tribulations were light drizzles compared to this torrential downpour. This might be the strongest tribulation in the history of their world.

“Who is undergoing this tribulation? An immortal?” A monarch murmured. Of course, this was more of a joke since immortals couldn’t exist.

“Boom!” The battlefield around Li Qiye was obliterated, leaving behind a floating expanse of the void.

A tree branch could be seen beneath Li Qiye with a single leaf. Nonetheless, it seemed to have lived for eras now. At first glance, the leaf lacked a verdant shade. Appearance aside, it exuded a majestic life force just like the boundlessness of the high heaven. Countless green dots came together to form this single leaf, no different from the stars making up the galaxy.

“The rest depends on you.” Li Qiye smiled at the leaf.

Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo was no more, the same for his world-weary dao. Everything has been obliterated by the tribulation and replaced by a new lifeform. The branch and the leaf looked rather inconspicuous but they were born from a heavenly tribulation.

Li Qiye left satisfied since his plan worked perfectly, leaving the branch to float in space.

Once he returned, Niu Fen came over and no longer noticed any dreadful aura.

“Young Master, that was quite a commotion.” Niu Fen saw bloodstains on Li Qiye and thought that he was the only one who could survive those tribulations.

“That’s the only way to reduce him to ashes.” Li Qiye smiled.

“The high heaven seemed furious at you.” Niu Fen said.

“The villainous heaven has a terrible temper but don’t worry, something good came out of this.” Li Qiye smiled.

Niu Fen had been contemplating the event and shuddered after hearing this.

“Young Master, did you create a new life?” He took a deep breath because gathering the corpse alone didn’t warrant this level of response.

“Not me, I was only the facilitator since only the high heaven can create life.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I see…” Niu Fen took a deep breath since this was still a monumental event - facilitating a new creation using the high heaven.

“Why did you pick Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo, Young Master?” He calmed down and became curious due to the dangerous nature of the feat.

Li Qiye shrugged and didn’t answer.

“Hehehe, if your trusty servant dies one day, will you facilitate the same thing for me?” He shamelessly asked.

“Facilitate what? I’ll just bury you.” Li Qiye gave him the side eye.

“Young Master, we’ve known each other for so long, why is that emperor special and not me?” Niu Fen complained.

“Because he can reach that level, you can’t.” Li Qiye couldn’t be bothered to look at Niu Fen.

“Why is that? My cultivation isn’t bad at all.” Niu Fen had a smug look while flexing his impressive muscles.

“If you can control your dao heart, you won’t need a facilitator or whatever.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“What do you mean, Young Master?” Niu Fen asked.

Li Qiye tapped his shell and said: “Focus up and you will be able to go one day too.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Niu Fen stood there in silence for a bit before asking with a soft tone: “Young Master, am I suitable to go?”

“That’s up to you but your present state is not suitable, not even worthy of being an appetizer. Even if you somehow live cowardly like a dog in hiding, the winter will kill you eventually.” Li Qiye said.

“When’s the right time for me?” Niu Fen was interested in this matter.

“Spring.” Li Qiye stared at the horizon.

“Spring, I’ll go then.” Niu Fen said.

“Did you not listen to me? I told you to cultivate more.” Li Qiye said.

“Young Master, I am at a bottleneck, I’m not seeing any progress after my refinement being trapped behind that gate.” Niu Fen didn’t want to talk about his cultivation.

“The problem is with your dao heart. Your dao fortune and cultivation have accumulated enough but your dao heart is lagging behind, hence your stagnation.” Li Qiye said.

“But that’s the hardest thing to train.” Niu Fen said.

“That depends on your determination and perseverance.” LI Qiye said.

“I understand.” Niu Fen knew of the proper path for him and bowed.

Suddenly, a white cloud appeared next to Li Qiye and a small, chubby hand reached out to pat his shoulder.
