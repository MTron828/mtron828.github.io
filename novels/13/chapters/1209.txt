Chapter 1210: Ancestral Whale

The old man took a deep breath and said: “Young Noble, your vision is wonderful. I am full of admiration, please come inside.”

Li Qiye nodded and stepped into the sea. In the blink of an eye, they sank to the deepest region of the seabed before stopping in front of a mountain.

“Crack!” A burst of collapsing rubble resounded. The mountain not far from Li Qiye shattered into pieces. Boulders fell down, causing the fish nearby to flee in horror.

When this mountain shattered completely, it suddenly became bright. A ray of light illuminated the bottom of the sea. Before them was a magnificent world, mysterious and sparkling. It resembled a portal leading to a whole new world.

Upon a closer inspection, one would see that this was no portal at all. It was an unbelievably large eye. This eye was previously covered by the mountains.

When this eye opened completely, its light completely engulfed Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” The earth began to quake as if the entire sea was about to be overturned. Tidal waves rose to the vault of the sky as if something was awakening, something capable of destroying the stars up in the nine heavens.

More mountains began to collapse in this area. The islands on the surface crumbled as well and sank to the bottom.

“How can this be?” The old man was shocked and exclaimed: “Why, why is the ancestral whale waking up before the appointed time?”

“Boom!” A tsunami of limitless height assaulted the sky, resulting in a spectacular scene. A monstrous whale emerged from the sea. This region’s geography was changed completely.

This whale was no different than a continent appearing at sea level. There was no end to this whale as far as the eyes could see. It was as long as a mountain range floating above the sea.

This was the ancestral whale of the Void Imperfection Three Schools. Very few people in this world had seen it before. Despite rumors of having a true dragon bloodline, its lacking intelligence prevented it from turning into a true dragon for now.

Li Qiye stood above its gigantic head at this time. It was no different from an island that spanned thousands of miles.

Li Qiye patted its head and spoke with emotions: “In the northern darkness, there is a fish and his name is K’un. The K’un is so huge, who knows how many million li he measures...” [1. A longer passage of this is found here.]

“Oooooo!” The whale roared after hearing Li Qiye. It was a heaven-shattering cry. The soul and the sky both quaked before its reverberations.

“Bang!” A huge water pillar shot straight to the sky from its head. It seemed to be particularly excited.

“This, this is a true whale rider!” The old man was dumbfounded while blurting these words.

He stared at Li Qiye in disbelief. Not even in his dreams would he expect Li Qiye to become a whale rider upon first meeting with the whale — this was too unbelievable.

“Is this predetermined by the heavens? Is it granting us the destined prince that will lead the three schools to new heights of greatness?” The old man dazedly murmured to himself.

He couldn’t be blamed for being so shocked. Although those like him who were stationed near the whale for a prolonged period were called whale riders, they were not real whale riders. To be more accurate, they were whale trackers.

This was because true whale riders could control the ancestral whale. As for them, they didn’t have this ability. The ancestral whale was much stronger than them, so unless they were to be recognized by the whale as its masters, they wouldn’t be able to become whale riders. Only those who were recognized could be called true whale riders.

A few old men like him could only follow the whale throughout its journey. They simply had no way of changing the route and destination of the whale.

After a long while, the old man’s mind returned. He emotionally kneeled on the ground and couldn’t conceal his excitement: “The heavens have eyes, it has bestowed a destined king to us. You are the whale rider of our Void Imperfection Three Schools, we will have a chance to unite again.”

“The heavens have eyes?” Li Qiye burst out into laughter and shook his head: “The old villainous heavens will never open his dog eyes, let alone give a destined king to your three schools.”

“In any case, Young Noble, you are our whale rider, a blessing for our school.” The old man was still excited all the same.

“Whale rider or not, I will be fetching the water from the Void Imperfection Spring.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his sleeve.

“Ooooo—” The ancestral whale cried out after hearing this.

With a buzz, a portal that led into the whale’s body opened.

The ecstatic old man said: “Young Noble, please enter!”

With a smile, Li Qiye entered the portal and was teleported into the whale with the old man right behind him.

It was an incredible scene. Palaces were built among the mountains.

Who could imagine that there were mountains within a whale? This was an entirely separate world with majestic peaks and flowing waterfalls. Those who knew that this was the inside of a whale would find the whole thing inconceivable.

Li Qiye and the old man entered a palace with an even larger dimension within. There was nothing in this palace hall outside of a large lake.

The water in this lake was calm. Due to its serene nature, those who were present would feel like they were floating. The water washed away the seven emotions and six desires. Their body would be covered with an immortal energy. Next, divine rings would emerge around them. They would gain the feeling of wanting to abandon the mortal flesh as they could ascend to an immortal at any moment. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“There are no other places with as much Void Imperfection Water as your three schools.” Li Qiye looked at the lake and insipidly said: “Back then, Immortal Emperor Wu Gou left behind plenty of resources for you all. Otherwise, your three schools wouldn’t have two more grand completion Immortal Physiques and two complete laws.”

“Our achievements today were granted by the great forefathers.” The old man agreed. Li Qiye was simply stating the truth.

They had sufficient resources. As long as there were talented enough disciples with strong willpower, their schools could groom them into excellent beings.

The talented prospects had a chance to enter the Void Imperfection Spring in order to change their constitution. After this process, their cultivation would soar like a tiger with wings.

Thus, the three schools only lacked talents while having no shortage of resources.

Li Qiye took out a gourd and began to absorb a large amount of Void Imperfection Water. For the three schools, this water was extremely precious. Not to mention the disciples, even the ancestors couldn’t easily take it out of the ancestral whale outside of special circumstances.

However, the old man had no objections to Li Qiye’s actions because Li Qiye could bring down the Void Imperfection Clouds. According to their ancestral teachings, Li Qiye was qualified to take the water here. Moreover, he was also a whale rider, thus he had the great authority to take as much as he wanted. It was not a big deal.

After taking enough, Li Qiye turned and left. However, the moment he exited the palace, several old men could be found kneeling on the ground with great reverence. They normally stayed inside the ancestral whale for a long period of time.

“What are you doing?” Li Qiye glanced at them and flatly said: “I am not your whale rider, get up.”

One of them hurriedly said: “Young Noble, please stay. Our three schools require your leadership. As long as you are there, we will return to one again.”

Li Qiye smiled and gently shook his head: “I already said I am not a whale rider, I’m only a fleeting passenger. There’s no need to care or pay attention to me.”

“But the ancestral whale has chosen you as its rider.” This old man answered with haste: “Maybe Young Noble is unaware of the significance of being a whale rider. For millions of years, the countless wise sages from our schools all desired to become one...”

Li Qiye gently waved his sleeve and said: “I know what it means to be one. When your progenitor and the two grand completion physique users are not in this world, the whale rider represents the highest authority in the three schools! This person can reunite the three schools into one again!”

The old man elaborated: “Young Noble, you are completely correct. As long as you stay, all of the disciples will listen to your commands, all of our resources will be for you to use...”

“I understand.” Li Qiye was without any interest: “For many people, to become a whale rider is the highest of honors, the greatest symbol of authority, the thing that many wise sages from your schools have been longing for.”
