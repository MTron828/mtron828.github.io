Chapter 4706: Power Of The Union

The consequences of having this gemstone were dire. A good outcome would be him dying alone. The worst would be complete clan extermination.

However, he still had hopes of being able to control the gemstone's power. At that point, he would become untouchable and sweep through the entire world.

Three Thousand Dao and True Immortal wouldn’t be able to do a damn thing. It wouldn’t be hard for him to fight Dan Sanqian and the monarchs from True Immortal. He would be able to protect himself and his sect.

Just think about it, he was able to stop the power of Worldbreaker with its help. This proved its potential to make him unbeatable.

Therefore, he focused on healing his injuries and the invasive power of the gemstone, hence the need to use the union.

This was easier said than done. Someone as strong as him still couldn’t muster enough energy from the union, only getting mere drips. Alas, he thought that with enough time, maybe it would prove sufficient as he gain more insight into the gemstone.

He understood how unlikely this was. As an experienced cultivator, he wasn’t blind to the truths.

The other alternative was to give up the gemstone, saving both himself and Golden Gate. However, this was a supreme item.

If they could somehow keep it, Golden Gate might become a real contender later. No one could resist the temptation of the gemstone.

Furthermore, he had experienced being empowered with it, making it even harder to give it up unless there was no other choice.

He didn’t give it up when surrounded by the behemoths. The same applied to this situation.

“You speak as if you’re the one who should have it.” He said.

“Correct, I am the only one in the world.” Li Qiye calmly said.

“I doubt you can even grasp it from me.” The emperor snorted.

“You’re very confident in your ability.” Li Qiye retorted.

“With the exception of apex existence like Dao Sanqian, I can handle everyone else.” The emperor responded and his fist dao erupted as well.

The grand dao surrounded him and engulfed Li Qiye as well. He wasn’t bragging since it was the truth.

He could actually fight evenly against Skybreak or Tyrant Monarch’s group. Thus, he was confident in dealing with a junior.

“Hmm… if I defeat you right now, you won’t be convinced due to your heavy injuries. What should I do about this…” Li Qiye mused.

“You!” The emperor turned red with rage, nearly vomiting a mouthful of blood. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He was a sect founder who had fought against the heroes of the world. He feared no one during his travel.

Now, this junior seemed to be looking down on him. Not even Dao Sanqian would do something like this.

Li Qiye suddenly raised his hand. The emperor instantly reacted by posing defensively and activating his fist dao. Gales took over the battlefield.

He thought that Li Qiye was about to attack but this was not the case.

Radiance descended and surrounded the emperor. This was akin to being blessed by the high heaven. He bathed in the sacred light and felt the warmth of spring.

“Zzz…” The petrified parts started becoming flesh and blood again.

He found his vitality flowing smoothly once more. The power of the immortal gemstone was gone and his internal injuries have been healed to his astonishment.

He had used his supreme merit laws and the most expensive medicines only to fail. Now, a junior cured him with just one hand wave?

The guy didn’t use alchemy to help at all. How could it be so easy? Only the high heaven could do something like this.

“Wh-what did you do? Such a merit law exists in this world?” Shock and fear overwhelmed him.

He knew the extent of his injuries. The current number one in the world, Dao Sanqian, couldn’t have healed him with one hand wave. It would still require immense effort and time.

“It’s not a merit law.” Li Qiye revealed: “You wanted to borrow the power of the union. That’s what happening right now.”

“The power of the union? But how can you control it? And with such ease, impossible!” The emperor blurted out.

It wasn’t easy for him to borrow this power despite being connected with these roots. If Li Qiye actually healed him in this manner, it meant that the guy had perfect control of the union.

This was unprecedented. Countless ancient ancestors in history have come here but no one displayed this level of mastery.

Dao Sanqian who had obtained a great fortune here didn’t reach this level either.
