Chapter 4769: Love The World

Wo Longxuan thought about how everyone coveted a rebirth experienced by her. After all, none wanted to die after reaching the apex of life.

Alas, the methods were limited and gradually ineffective, not to mention the imposed shackles. Her bloodline was an exception. She managed to gain another lifetime on top of keeping her invincibility and past memories.

Of course, this wasn’t entirely rosy because she found herself to be all alone. Those she knew have returned to the earth along with her sect. The world was vast but its inhabitants could no longer enter her eyes or her heart. 

“Living again doesn’t seem that nice.” She sighed sentimentally, expressing her long-lasting sadness.

“There is a price for everything. One must give up their emotions to become eternal.” Li Qiye said.

“Who can be emotionless without succumbing?” She replied.

She realized why a few big shots chose to live in seclusion after many eras. This was due to them not having any attachment to the actual world, only viewing it as something that could be potentially beneficial in the future.

“That depends on their dao heart and original aspirations. The dao path is long but don’t forget what you’ve been searching for. Otherwise, your dao is meaningless since you are no longer yourself.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes.” Wo Longxuan said softly and stared at him: “Hmm, perhaps I should have not regained my memories and started over from the beginning.”

She could have separated her new life from the previous completely and started over as a young girl. Alas, her choice made her feel unbearably lonely. 

“If you were to go back to the decision, would you be willing to drop it all? Your memories of all your friends and loved ones?” Li Qiye asked.

She fell into silence. After a long while, she responded: “I don’t know. Maybe I simply didn’t want to leave this world and everything in it, that’s why I chose rebirth.”

“Yes, remember the world and love it like before.” She repeated and became emotional. Perhaps this was her original intention in living longer.

“That’s why it wasn’t a bad thing for you to regain your memories. You might be lonely but you still remember your feats and why you tried so hard.”

He paused for a bit and said: “These memories are warning you to not forget your reason for being. When you forget them, the world will become meaningless then and you shall fall into darkness.”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

She thought that he was right. In the here and now, the world no longer had anything to do with her. If she didn’t have any memories, she would not care about its survival. In that case, she might take it a step further and participate in the destruction.

Top existences once spilled blood to protect the world and their loved ones, going as far as being ready to throw their lives away. Unfortunately, after enough epochs, their “world” disappeared and they forgot their original aspirations. This turned them into destroyers, hence the importance of memories.

“I don’t know how you’ve been able to do it, Young Noble.” She said. Li Qiye had lived longer than her yet he still walked and participated in the mortal coil with love.

Li Qiye smile and stared at the horizon. His eyes seemed to be peering above the high heaven.

“This is just part of the dao.” Li Qiye said: “I must continue to be myself or all my sufferings would have been meaningless.”

“What should I do then?” She murmured his comment before asking him with the earnestness of a child wanting to learn.

He thought about it for a moment before answering: “Go to the secret realm, there are still things and people from the past, those who have lived in the same world as you. They can warm your heart.”

 “Thank you, Young Noble, for guiding me in both the previous and current life.” She bowed deeply and truly appreciated him for he had always steered her on the right path.

“Go now.” He nodded and accepted the gesture.

“Will we meet again?” Due to her loneliness, meeting Li Qiye was a guiding lamp event in her life. It could illuminate her path and allow her to walk forward.

“If it’s meant to be, but this is certainly not the last farewell.” Li Qiye said.

“I hope to see you again then.” She came over and hugged him.

Though this wasn’t a separation due to life and death, she knew that Li Qiye would return to the realms above soon enough. These wars were far above her reach and he might not be able to come back.

“I hope that your pure intentions will stay the same and guide you forward, little one.” He embraced her back.

“I hope that you will be eternal, Young Noble.” Her eyes became moist.

She then turned around and left without looking back while he watched until she disappeared from the horizon.

This was another goodbye for his memories; some were sadder than others. The good ones included seeing his friends again but not all of them had a happy ending.

How many could endure the torture of time as he did?
