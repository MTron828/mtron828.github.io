Chapter 5726: Get The Hell Out

“Boom!” The intense traveling continued until the cloud spent more time in a particular phenomenon, delving deeper within.

It resembled a hunting dog charging into a flock of birds but in this case, explosions and chaotic dao laws. The latter swept any intruder away, causing them to lose all sense of direction.

The cloud emitted a burst of immortal light piercing through the disorderly laws. Constant derivation and evolution couldn’t hinder it for a second.

It found an immortal path - narrow and endless. It stretched through the void of chaos, perhaps leading to the other shore.

When the cloud’s light scanned the path, two figures were immediately exposed despite their best effort to conceal themselves.

They have been cultivating on the path, not expecting to be found by this strange cloud.

“It’s them!” Spectators saw them inside the phenomenon.

Their expression soured since this was the worst possible development. After entering Immortal Dao City, they picked this phenomenon and wanted to hide for a while, hoping to avoid Li Qiye.

Unfortunately, what they thought to be the perfect plan crumbled posthaste.

“Go!” The two stood up and ran across the path. There was no other choice outside of delving deeper into the artifact, hoping to reach the end of the immortal dao.

“Rumble!” Dao laws erupted and indiscernible illusions appeared. Just one wrong step meant being kicked off the path so the two stopped, scanning for the right step.

“So many choices to pick.” A figure appeared in front of them, looking like an illusion as well.

“Li Qiye!” The duo staggered backward; fear surfaced in their mind.

They have been carefree all this time. First, the quantity and size of the phenomena rendered a search impossible. Moreover, they also concealed themselves. If they didn’t actively appear, no one should be able to find them.

The only test was their patience. After enough time had passed, Li Qiye should give up and they could start moving again.

“Should I pick one for you?” Li Qiye said with a smile.

The two immediately jumped into the air, leaving this phenomenon for another engulfed in a labyrinth of mist and fog.

They had no time to care about this and only wanted to get away from Li Qiye. However, he appeared in front of them again.

“So anxious.” Li Qiye raised one finger, causing the chaotic temporal flow to twirl around it.

They escaped the phenomenon immediately for another, feeling both angry and afraid. They ignored all signs of danger and ran as fast as possible. This phenomenon was oceanic while the next was space...

Their recklessness was proven futile since they couldn’t escape from his pursuit. He was like a shadow or maggots attached to the bones, impossible to shake off.

“Tired yet? Well, I am, get the hell out.” Li Qiye said and waved casually as if he were fanning himself during a hot day.

It had no dao power or suppressive force yet it could still blow the myriad realms away as if they were scattering leaves. The thickness of heaven and earth seemed inconsequential.

Luminous and West Bank roared and activated their supreme dao. They summoned their treasures as well to stop him.

“Boom!” Their merit laws and treasures crumbled before they were sent flying out of the phenomenon like two meteors, all the way out of Immortal Dao City. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Bam!” They smashed into a mountain in Dao Domain.

“Ugh...” When they got up, they couldn’t help vomiting blood.

“We have to get back!” They understood that the only way to survive was to rush back into Immortal Dao City and immediately rushed for it.
