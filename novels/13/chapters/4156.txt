Chapter 4157: Nightloom

The black chariot with circulating gales stole everyone’s attention.

“The king is here.” People glanced at it and realized that one of the Six Sect Masters was inside.

“So he’s inside?” A youth who had never seen him before whispered.

“No, look at the driver.” An ancestor from his sect responded.

“Driver?” The nearby youths’ eyes widened in disbelief.

There was indeed a middle-aged driver sitting in front and holding the reins. He had an embroidered robe and an impressive figure. He gave the feeling of being immense just like a mountain.

He was attentive with his task; his eyes always looked forward at the stallions and the road while forgetting about everything else.

He didn’t have an oppressive aura or overwhelming gallantry, no flashing sword rays either. He only appeared to be an above-average man.

Thus, people assumed that he was the driver while the real king was sitting inside the chariot.

In reality, it turned out that this middle-aged man was actually Cloud Dream King. Who was inside then?

“That’s Cloud Dream King?” Others became confused. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The King of Bandits and ruler of Cloud Dream Lake was driving the chariot for someone else?

Though he was a bandit, he was also one of the Six Sect Masters. This meant that he was quite famous throughout Sword Continent. He stood at the top of the second generation and could smile proudly wherever he went. The current situation didn’t match his status.

“Yes, that’s him.” An expert who saw him before confirmed.

People exchanged glances. Few in Sword Continent were worthy of his service. They started thinking about the being inside the chariot. Some opened their heavenly gaze in order to take a look.

On the other hand, the ancestors and the big shots had a pretty good idea. All of them thought about one particular person - the only one in Cloud Dream Lake that could enjoy this treatment.

“Who is inside?” One youth asked.

“Nightloom.” An ancestor said: “He’s the only one deserving of this.”

“Nightloom…” Listeners nearby took a deep breath. This was an ancient title on the verge of being forgotten by most people.

“Stop!” A thunderous voice echoed in everyone’s ears. Black clouds billowed above the bandits sieging Black Dragon Island.

The shout wasn’t that loud but it still intimidated listeners, akin to hearing unexpected thunder.

The bandits calmed down and retreated away from the battlefield, staring at the chariot. The sword formation also pulled back and didn’t give chase.

“Nightloom Ancestor?” The island lords found hope after seeing their king controlling the chariot.

Initially, they were happy to see Dark Gale Camp’s help. The king and his legion could help them take down Black Dragon Island then they would seize that supreme sword formation.

However, seeing Nightloom himself left them emotional.

“What is Nightloom Ancestor doing here?” Some of them wondered.

When they were younger growing up at the lake, they had heard of this title before but never met the actual cultivator until today.

“Something big is happening.” The neutral ancestors thought.

All in all, his first appearance after many generations shook the crowd. He was one of the strongest right now, rumored to be on the same level as Hallowed City Lord and only a bit beneath the Five Overlords.

“Well yeah, Li Qiye is attacking the lake right now. He can’t let this go.” One expert said.

Most thought that this was the case. Li Qiye had shaken the foundation of the eighteen islands so Dark Gale Camp had to do something.

If Nightloom was here, this meant that Dark Gale was serious in taking Li Qiye down.

“What’s going to happen now?” Someone wondered, uncertain about Li Qiye’s ability to fight this ancestor.

“I think Li Qiye has more tricks up his sleeve, he just eliminated the experts from Sea Emperor earlier. Maybe he can do the same against Nightloom.” A big shot from the last generation was optimistic about Li Qiye’s chance.

“Just wait, at least it’ll be fun.” One expert became excited.

“Creak.” The door opened and an old man came out from the chariot. He wore all black, looking a bit feeble and elderly - clearly not far from death.

“That’s Nightloom.” A mighty ancestor recognized him.

Everyone watched with bated breath, not daring to show disrespect despite the old man looking quite weak.
