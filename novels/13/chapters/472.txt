Chapter 473: Easily Massacres All Enemies

“Clank!” A sword hymn resonated through the nine heavens. This sword was completely merciless. Like the most supreme sword from above, it slashed down to massacre the mortal realm, sparing nothing. This was the most merciless and imposing sword technique!

“Poof!” This sword sweeping by left behind a spectacular scene. Heads began to fly as columns of blood spurted out like springs, creating a sanguine rain.

After those heads flew away, they could still see their bodies standing there, spurting their own blood. The heads then rolled on the ground with their eyes wide open. Even at the moment of their death, they couldn’t discern that sword slash.

Everyone became shocked by this scene. One sword to kill one thousand! The blood then reached the ground and flowed like a river, creating a scene of carnage.

Golden Child, the Divine Spark Prince, Ghost Monk, and the Hundred Clans Child became quite alarmed. Ghost Monk then shouted: “Activate the formation!”

He then took out an array script, causing vast amounts of black smoke to fill the oasis. The four of them stood in the formation, each presiding a corner respectively.

Qiurong Wanxue was also dragged into the formation. The four of them wanted to bait Li Qiye into the trap, so they imprisoned her in the middle of the formation — its most dangerous area.

A ghastly air surrounded the entire formation along with buddhist chants and a bright buddhist radiance.

Everyone felt a chill as if a ghost buddha was climbing out of hell.

There were indeed ghost monks who wore monastic robes appearing in the formation. They did not have any flesh and were only bones. Their chanting created this gigantic nether formation.

“The Zen Ghost Secret Formation of the Zen Ghost Tribe!” A person recognized this grand formation and screamed out.

All of the cultivators outside the formation quickly fled really far, aghast. Rumor has it that the Zen Ghost Secret Art was a very evil technique that was cultivated by Ghost Monk, and the formation that stemmed from it was even more terrifying. It had been said that those who were trapped in the formation would all be refined into puppets.

Four monstrous Buddhas appeared in the four corners, causing a mighty nether energy to spread out.

“Li, if you want to save her, then enter. If not, she will become a puppet within three minutes!” The four nether Buddhas were created by the four geniuses. They used the power of the formation to turn into these nether Buddhas and used their surging blood energy to fuel this formation.

“Ahh!” Qiurong Wanxue screamed out in fear.

“Child’s play.” Li Qiye smirked. The space around him suddenly trembled. With extreme speed, he abruptly disappeared before showing up inside the secret formation.

His speed was too swift so no one saw how he got inside the formation. All the cultivators gasped at this sight.

Someone said: “Rushing into this ghost formation is suicidal. If he gets trapped inside, then he will be refined in just three minutes!”

“He is being too reckless even if he is trying to save someone.” Although killing one thousand with one sword was marvelous, many people assumed that he was suicidal when he rushed into the formation.

In the middle of the Zen Ghost formation, Qiurong Wanxue was trapped by a swarm of skeletal monks. They exuded a ghastly energy, causing her to become pale from fear. She quickly channeled her strong blood energy to create a barrier for protection.

Right at this dangerous juncture when she was completely pale, she felt her body become light as if someone was pulling her. She was scared out of her mind! However, once she embraced the hard chest and smelled the familiar scent, her rampaging heart immediately calmed down.

With his Soaring Immortal Physique, Li Qiye’s speed was too fast so the ghastly formation could not trap him. The reaction of the formation was a lot slower than Li Qiye, so he managed to rush to the middle and grabbed the trapped Qiurong Wanxue.

The Soaring Immortal Physique’s speed was unbeatable; it would cause the timespace around his body to be one beat slower. He trod around the formation as if it was an empty house.

The four geniuses were both shocked and furious after seeing such a scene, so they shouted: “Kill!!”

They poured all of their blood energies into the formation. Four nether Buddhas sealed the sky as a murderous ghastly aura descended.

However, Li Qiye stood in the middle of the formation with no intent to escape. He spoke seriously towards Qiurong Wanxue: “Hold tight!” Then, he stomped heavily on the ground.

Qiurong Wanxue listened and hugged him tightly. There was an unprecedented sense of security as she hugged her Young Noble’s waist.

In this second, the Hell Suppressing Inner Physique emitted a bright light. Countless silk-like universal laws hovered around him as his invincible physique erupted.

The sky was covered by Li Qiye’s gigantic foot. The nine heavens collapsed and myriad stars were destroyed. Even a vaster earth would not be able to withstand such a terrifying stomp.

This stomp was as heavy as the nine worlds and the countless mountains contained within; it was capable of collapsing the firmaments and crushing all things in this world!

“Boom!” After a deafening bang, this stomp came down and shattered the four nether Buddhas into little pieces that scattered in the sky. The group of the four geniuses was blown out of the Zen Ghost Secret Formation by this powerful force.

“Rumble!” More explosions ensued along with the sounds of bones breaking. All the skeletal monks in the formation were crushed completely. Eventually, another bang resounded as the entire formation collapsed.

The four spewed out blood in the sky after being knocked out of the formation. Before they could reach the ground, Li Qiye, with a speed ten times faster than lightning, had already reached them.

The first victim was Ghost Monk. Before he could react to Li Qiye’s sudden appearance, he was already kicked flying.

The second was the Hundred Clans Child. He was alarmed after seeing Ghost Monk’s situation, but it was too late. With the Soaring Immortal Physique, Li Qiye pierced his head with a finger.

The third was Golden Child. He was frightened out of his mind and wanted to take a treasure out. However, with a cracking noise, his bones instantly shattered.

Everything came to an end. By the time anyone realized what had happened, Li Qiye was already gripping the Divine Spark Prince by the neck in midair.

“Ah!” At this time, Ghost Monk’s horrified scream finally came out. He heavily struck the ground due to the kick and turned into a puddle of flesh and blood, staining the ground. His scream before his death echoed all the way to the blue clouds.

The Hundred Clans Child didn’t even have the chance to scream since his head was penetrated; his body fell flat to the ground. Golden Child’s golden skeleton broke into countless fragments; he was without a chance to scream either.

Ghost Monk was flattened, the Hundred Clans Child’s body fell down, Golden Child was shattered, and the Divine Spark Prince was hanging in the air by the neck. All of this happened in an instant as if four Li Qiyes attacked the four of them at the same time.

The prince couldn’t react in time either. It wasn’t until he heard the shrill scream of Ghost Monk that he noticed the remaining two were dead.

He was dumbstruck and pissed his pants in terror since he could hardly believe it.

The Hell Suppressing Godly Physique and the Soaring Immortal Physique — the combination of these two was unbeatable! Although Li Qiye’s Soaring Immortal Physique had yet to reach minor completion, his physique tribulation was not far off.

How frightening were these two Immortal Physiques when used together? Absolute weight combined with absolute speed resulted in an all-destroying force. Li Qiye’s body was the most powerful weapon.

Moreover, with the fastest speed in the world, nothing could chase or stop the Soaring Immortal Physique. Li Qiye didn’t need merit laws at all. His body alone was enough to kill his enemies.

There would be a limit to one’s attack power when cultivating only one Immortal Physique. However, the synergy between the Hell Suppressing Godly Physique and the Soaring Immortal Physique was too great. Everything became simple when these two were utilized together. There would no longer be a need for techniques, laws, and the profound grand dao; pure weight and pure speed alone would suffice.

Both the cultivators outside and the young ghosts within the oasis were scared silly and shaken.

One sword killing one thousand was already more than horrifying, but Li Qiye defeated the formation along with the four geniuses in just a second. Among them, the Divine Spark Prince was weaker, but the other three were Little Sovereigns at the grand achievement stage!

However, both the secret formation and grand achievement Little Sovereigns were turned into nothingness all the same in an instant. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Qiurong Wanxue was frozen; she knew that Li Qiye was very powerful, but not to this extent. Completing such feats meant that his power was not within the confines of the Little Sovereign realm.

Earlier, she was worried because she thought that he couldn’t fight against four opponents. But now, she knew that her concerns were unnecessary.

Everyone thought that Li Qiye would die in the formation of Ghost Monk. After all, it was a famous and deadly formation. Once trapped inside, anyone would be turned into a puppet within three minutes.

With Little Sovereigns presiding and powering the formation, not to mention a Little Sovereign, even a Grand Sovereign would not be able to break through the formation within the allotted time. Because of this, Li Qiye imprudently rushing into the formation was deemed suicidal; three minutes were simply too short.
