Chapter 5593: Never Yield

“We will never yield!” Cultivators, weak and strong, experienced a surge in morale.

They knew that Celestial Court couldn’t be stopped yet still didn’t want to falter. Defending Dao City might end with their death but after seeing the determination of their comrades, they considered this fate to be acceptable.

“We are one with Dao Domain, surrendering is not an option.” Skysplitter and other conquerors activated their defenses, personally taking charge.

“Well said! I, Yao Guang, shall take the first step!” An emperor leaped into the sky and performed a dual-palm strike, sending out an endless beam resembling the river of time against an army of Celestial Court.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Boom!” This immediately pushed the commanders back, disrupting the formation.

Emperors and monarchs on Celestial Court immediately joined the fight. Imperial auras erupted along with dao laws, forming an oceanic barrier. This successfully stopped the beam from causing more damage.

“Go!” Top cultivators from The People launched an assault.

“Clank!” Jadesword Conqueror’s slash illuminated the battlefield, aiming straight for the top-ranking members of Celestial Court.

It crossed through the air and borrowed the power of countless swords nearby, engulfing everything with the sword affinity.

“Splash!” The overwhelming attack pierced through one commander after another.

“Boom!” Skysplitter Conqueror’s hair fluttered in the air as he summoned a portal in the sky, making room for a maelstrom of lightning. The individual bolts resembled dancing dragons. The maelstrom descended and surrounded an entire region.

Timeworn Manor released five divine beams. They circled in the air and became one - a divine mountain came crashing down on the legion in the outskirts.

Dao Domain’s emperors and conquerors took the initiative to start the deadly war, not showing a sliver of hesitation.

Celestial Court’s commanders didn’t waste time in stopping the devastating attacks either to prevent unnecessary casualties.

Blinding lights detonated all around Dao Domain. Imperial auras ravaged the fabrics of space and time - a terrible development for the region.

Living beings trembled in fear. Most cultivators weren’t qualified to join the fight either since they were paralyzed on the ground. Some hid in their sects, aware that participation meant certain death.

The shockwaves from these skirmishes could crush kingdoms and billions of mortals in the blink of an eye. The victims wouldn’t even know which emperor delivered the finishing blow to their land.

“Boom!” A heavenly radiance manifested into reality and blessed the combatants of Celestial Court with a fiery glow, granting them power and protection.

From a mortal perspective, they would think that these armies have been blessed by the high heaven.

This was Celestial Court’s greatest advantage. It could bless its members through countless dimensions since it was a treasure similar to Immortal Dao City.

Unfortunately for The People, Immortal Dao City was closed or they would be enjoying a similar blessing and power boost. It had happened in the past when the Immortal Emperors of The People learned how to control Immortal Dao City.

“Boom!” The sudden increase in power of Celestial Court’s armies was too much for the defenders despite their best efforts.

“Activate the western line!” Luminous realized this and roared thunderously.

However, there was no change at all. Everyone looked to the west and saw no reaction from Imperial West Bank. Its barriers were fully activated and resembled a shell, blocking others from seeing the clan.

Keep in mind that the strongest combatants of Dao Domain have left their clans and kingdoms to join the frontline. However, the strongest clan didn’t participate at all - a clear divergence from their illustrious history.

They had fought Celestial Court in several wars. Many believed that as long as this clan was around, the western line would never be penetrated.

Today, they didn’t join the frontline to face their mortal enemies. Not a single clan member could be seen - only silence.
