Chapter 4960: Casually Unbeatable

If students weren’t here to witness it in person, they couldn’t have imagined the dao controller’s defensive potential.

This could have been acceptable if Li Qiye had one sacred fruit. However, he was just a regular cultivator. The defense came from the artifact alone since it created a boundless nullification field.

“Nothing can come close to this.” One student became jealous since it had chosen a master in Li Qiye.

It was one thing for a supreme genius with peerless comprehension to obtain the treasure. Alas, such an average guy had extraordinary luck.

The trio was alarmed to see this as well. Their enemy only raised his hand yet they couldn’t do anything about it.

“Scram.” Li Qiye smiled and waved the treasure. He didn’t use any merit law yet this swept everyone off their feet.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Skyquake meant that the treasure was capable of shifting the heaven.

“Rumble!” Cultivation didn’t matter; students fell flat to the ground with their legs up in the air.

This went worse for his opponents. The quaking crushed all three techniques and sent the users flying. Even their top treasures exploded.

They fell to the ground and vomited blood. Li Qiye didn’t give them time to get up. Delicate dao laws from the dao controller poured down and crushed them.

“Crack!” Despite their size, they had the immensity of mountain ranges, breaking bones and spilling blood.

The world was hushed as the students rose to their feet, grappling with the gravity of the situation.

Halo was already strong while Swordgrasp was actually stronger. Radiant Young Monarch took it to the next level, being such a young dragon lord. Who in the academy could actually beat him?

Alas, the three of them lost to Li Qiye simply waving his hand around with the dao controller.

“Go!!!” The young monarch didn’t give up that easily. He roared and wanted to repel the suppression with his holy affinity.

He only managed to struggle for a second before the laws pressed down again, breaking more bones in the process and fully immobilizing him.

“It’s so one-sided…” Students from Deity were traumatized by the experience.

“Having that dao controller means being unbeatable.” Another murmured in a daze.

Some were overwhelmed with thoughts. Why did Jun Landu not keep this? Now, Li Qiye became the lucky one.

“How do you want to die? Fast or a slow grind?” Li Qiye said with a smile: “Should have listened to me and committed suicide, would have saved you from this embarrassment.”

Students shuddered and stared at the three. These supreme geniuses were about to be killed?

“You better make sure I’m dead or I will kill you and your clan.” The young monarch coldly uttered, not begging for mercy.

“If you kill me, you will suffer the wrath of my father and Heaven Burial.” Halo didn’t have the same composure and threatened Li Qiye.

“Very well, then there is no need for me to show mercy then. Goodbye.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“Buzz.” Suddenly, the atmosphere became tense and everyone felt a sharp pain on their forehead. They were fixated on by someone and could be killed at any second.

Li Qiye gazed upward and encountered the hostile gaze of a cultivator, his eyes blazing with murderous intent.

“Arrow Saint!” Students recognized him instantly.

“It’s not too late to let them go.” His chilling voice echoed.

Not long ago, they were sent flying by the old man from the academy. Now, he has returned.

Although this place wasn’t part of the actual academy, the ceremony was still ongoing.

“Or what?” Li Qiye remained calm.

Arrow Saint nocked his arrow, a weapon capable of penetrating thousands of peaks. He aimed it at Li Qiye's head and warned: “Release them go, and all feuds will be forgotten."

No one questioned his power since he was a three-fruit dragon lord. A junior couldn’t possibly stop him.

As an ancient ancestor of the Godchaser Sect, he commanded immense prestige and influence throughout not just his own sect but all of Deity. His words carried weight and his commands were taken seriously. If Li Qiye were to comply with his demand and release the three, they would abandon their pursuit of vengeance.

Many students felt it would be the wise course of action, as going against Deity never boded well for anyone.
