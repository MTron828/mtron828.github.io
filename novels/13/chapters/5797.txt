Chapter 5797: Worlds’ Ender Fist

“Boom!” The mech exuded a heavenly light too bright for spectators to keep their eyes open.

“Rumble!” Terrifying blast waves sent many dragon lords and ancient gods flying despite the incalculable distance.

Some emperors became suppressed, unable to move an inch. Previously, those from Celestial Court gathered power from the palace, improving their offensive and defensive capabilities.

This was especially true for Sword, Nether, and Hao Hai who could channel more empowerment. However, these individual boosts were nothing compared to the mech’s current channels.

In history, no one understood the true limit of a heavenly treasure. No emperor or overlord could muster its power in its entirety. Nevertheless, the mech was pulling a higher concentration than all of Celestial Court’s members.

The power of a grand-completion paragon artifact empowered by a heavenly treasure exceeded imaginations. Three thousand worlds returned to life due to the blessing of Elder Galaxy; all living beings from insects to the strongest cultivators gained newfound strength. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This doubled the initial strength of Three Thousand World Mech and Jiao Heng made his move.

“Worlds’ Ender Fist!” He had gained the knowledge of the mech’s ultimate strike.

Everything morphed into a single punch descending against Li Qiye and caused the crowd to gasp in astonishment.

Everyone felt that the shockwaves were enough to destroy Celestial Court and the six continents as they struck Li Qiye directly. The flesh couldn’t possibly withstand this level of assault.

However, Li Qiye didn’t bother dodging. His primordial light activated as he punched randomly, looking like a villager throwing the first punch without any skill or technique.

Alas, it was not to be underestimated since it still wielded the power of the primordial. As his fist touched the sky, it seemed as if he grabbed the handle of the high heaven itself and dragged it down.

The high heaven was the utmost supreme - everything beneath was nothing more than dust and ants.

Thus, wielding it in an attack meant breaking through all defenses. Resistance was futile.

“Bam!” He crushed Worlds’ Ender Fist in the blink of an eye and struck the mech, sending it flying through the void.

Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng was forced out of the mech and became his main target.

“Boom!” His punch caused space to shatter like glass.

“Crack!” Jiao Heng was pulverized and became covered in blood.

With that, something strange occurred. Li Qiye wielded the high heaven and smashed his opponent, pinning him down.

Since the high heaven was filled with lighting and tribulation, the same force drilled into Jiao Heng. His body seemed particularly receptive to the lightning affinity so lightning torrents filled him to the brim.

“Boom!” He somehow gained the power of the high heaven after being brutalized by Li Qiye.

“Back off!” Jiao Heng roared furiously while thunderous lighting crackled around him, pushing Li Qiye’s fist back.

Li Qiye retracted his punch and smirked at the emperor.

Meanwhile, spectators could tell that Jiao Heng was different. He somehow gained the boundless power of lightning seemingly stemming from the high heaven.

Thunderstorms seemed to be erupting within him. If they were to break free, that would spell the end of the world. He emitted a dominant aura, instilling an instinctive fear and dread into everyone.
