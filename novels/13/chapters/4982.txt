Chapter 4983: God Source

Since Tiger Deity was one of the six, everyone assumed that its founder god was a tiger. It didn’t make sense for a monkey to be the founder. Shouldn’t it be Monkey Deity instead?

Goldcrest himself couldn’t answer this question.

“The legend says it is because the founder god rode a divine tiger.” He said.

“How strange.” Yunyun murmured.

“Some believe that our founder god learned the dao after meditating in front of the Divine Beast Tablet. The counterpart says that he was already an invincible demon emperor who chose to return to the source. Either way, it is certain that he is a monkey demon, completely invincible.”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I see.” Yunyun responded.

With the exception of Mist, the other deity branches were started by divine demons. Mist’s founder remained a mystery.

“Please wait a bit, I shall perform an offering.” Goldcrest told the two before kneeling down in front of the statue.

At this point, he already had the power of a dragon lord - capable of performing wondrous feats. In fact, he could be considered a god by weaker beings.

Thus, why would he need to worship someone else? This seemed to be against the path of cultivation.

Alas, this was Demon and the Ten Great Mountains. Every worshipper was connected to their god until they became strong enough to break it. Otherwise, even a founder god who had previously worshipped a deity would still be connected to this faith.

“Buzz.” After showing respect via a kowtow, Goldcrest took out a small item with a crescent shape, holding it with both hands.

It exuded a gentle glow just like the moon above and was brimming with life. Despite its immense aura, it possessed a silent warmth instead of an overwhelming suppression.

He offered it to the statue. A reaction occurred and the two deities looked as if they were coming back to life.

The tiny tiger roared and released a torrent of shockwaves. On the other hand, the monkey remained calm and composed.

Thus, people got the impression that the powerful tiger was just a mount. The monkey was the true master with an indelible force.

Yunyun finally got confirmation that the monkey was the true founder god of Tiger.

Goldcrest bathed before their power, seemingly meditating. After a while, he trembled once and woke up; the statue also became normal again.

He stood up while his eyes were still flashing with newfound power. His comprehension and knowledge have improved from the process.

“Congratulations, Brother Goldcrest.” Yunyun could see that he had gained something considerable after the ceremony.

“A god source is incredible indeed.” Goldcrest looked at the crescent item in his hand.

“What’s a god source?” She asked since it didn’t look like a treasure or an alchemy item. He and the tiger monarch competed for it earlier.

“The essence of a god.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s right, it is a priceless treasure to us.” Goldcrest said.

“So there is a god on the verge of death.” Li Qiye startled Yunyun with this comment.

“Really?” She asked, thinking about which of the six.

“It is the current god of Feather, Peacock Monarch is near death so his god source has been scattering everywhere.”

The six branches included six founders but afterward, there were six commanding gods as well.

For example, Wood was started by Demon Conqueror who later on left to become a conqueror instead. Nonetheless, Wood Deity still remained for others to worship.

Tiger’s founder was a divine monkey but its current god was a lunar rabbit.

“Everyone is searching for remnants of the god source right now. I heard about this so I came back and got lucky with one.” He said.

“What are their benefits?” She asked.

“It contains the primal mysteries of the dao for demons. Just one tiny piece is immensely helpful. It doesn’t restrict users from the other branches as well.” He said.

“So when does a new god appear?” She asked.

“I’m not sure since I haven’t heard anything. There are two ways, one being whoever collects all the god sources and gain the recognition of the deity.” He said.

“What about the other method?” She was excited to be around for such a monumental event.

“A successor who is was chosen by the previous god who must create his own god source.” Goldcrest said.

“Hmm, sounds hard.” She said.

Gathering the broken pieces meant winning numerous battles. Moreover, this required the acceptance of the deity branch as well. As for the successor path, this must be done through cultivation and comprehension.

In a sense, the latter path was easier but required higher comprehension and dao heart.
