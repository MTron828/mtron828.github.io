Chapter 4121: Snowcloud Princess

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Despite her beauty, Li Qiye only gave her a passing glance before focusing on the old daoist again.

“Why is this guy here?” Li Qiye was slightly surprised since this old man was none other than Daoist Peng from Everlasting Courtyard.

The old daoist kept on looking around before entering Li Qiye’s restaurant. He sat down on the first floor and ordered some wine and appetizers.

Meanwhile, the pretty girl entered as well and sat down next to the daoist.

“Snowcloud Princess…” Numerous cultivators got up to greet her.

She nodded politely back at them but her eyes never moved from the old daoist’s sword.

“So that’s Snowcloud Princess, Xu Yiwen.” The young cultivators were fascinated with her appearance and quietly talked among themselves.

“Yes, she’s the Fire-and-Ice Sword from Flame Valley Dao Institution of the ten Sword Prodigies. I believe she’s among the top five.” One cultivator quietly whispered.

Her exceptional beauty always commanded attention wherever she went. Thus, it was normal for everyone in the restaurant to be talking about her.

Rumor has it that she was cultivating a heavenly sword dao as well. Because of this, many believed that she was among the top five.

She didn’t care about the whispers; only the sword captured her interest.

Daoist Peng knew that she had been following him as well. After finishing his meal, he put on a pained expression and complained: “Young lady, you followed me for a long time now even though we have no past grievances. Why?”

“Daoist, I am merely interested in your sword, would you like to sell it?” Her voice was quite pleasant and polite.

“I told you that this sword is not for sale.” He said.

It turned out that he had bragged about this ancestral sword. Most didn’t think much of it but when the princess saw it, her interest was piqued right away.

“Daoist, don’t refuse so fast. After all, my price is rather reasonable. You should reconsider.” She smiled.

His head seemed to be shrinking into his neck as he spoke: “Thanks, the problem is that though the sword isn’t famous or special, it is still passed down by our ancestors as the sect’s heirloom. I can’t sell it for any amount.”

“Maybe there is another way.” She insisted: “Just tell me if there’s anything you need. I will try to satisfy you to the best of my ability.”

These weren’t empty words. Her sect was one of the strongest right now and she had plenty of influence there.

He opened his mouth but stopped then shook his head.

“It must be extraordinary to be viewed so highly by you, Princess.” A youth walked into the restaurant and said with confidence.

Others immediately thought that he was superior in some way. Everyone looked over and saw his shimmering golden outfit.

Normally, wearing golden was rather tacky and pompous if one wasn’t a royal member. However, this seemed perfect on him and gave off a transcending impression. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This particular robe seemed to be alive. The surface of the cloth seemed to have flowing golden liquid.

He wasn’t particularly handsome but looked clean and neat. He had a refreshing and amicable smile.

His golden radiance seeped through the entire restaurant and engulfed everyone.

“Goldflow Young Noble!” Everyone stood up to greet him.

“It’s my pleasure.” He slightly bowed his head.

The others sat down; their eyes brimmed with respect for him.

He was none other than Goldflow Young Noble, one of the ten prodigies. Some even considered him to be in the number one spot.

The ten have never fought before but he was still listed at the top, even above Abyss Scion of Sea Emperor.

There were several reasons for his high evaluation. Of course, not everyone agreed to this.

The first reason was due to Virtuous School’s good relationship with everyone. Since people liked him, they were more prone to giving him a generous evaluation.

Virtuos School founded by Sword Emperor had a total of three dao lords. This was a rather influential sect. It was said that three out of ten sects in Sword Continent had deep ties with Virtuous School.

This was because Sword Emperor spread the dao of the sword to this region. Thus, Virtuous School was highly respected. Goldflow Young Noble benefited from this as well.

His critics said that his high ranking had nothing to do with his cultivation, just his popularity.

Others disagreed with this, spouting that his strength was number one among the ten. They justified it by bringing up his master - the current leader of Virtuous School, Nine-sun Sword Saint. He also enjoyed the number one spot among the Six Kings.

Rumor has it that he could put up a good fight against Hallowed City Lord, and that the two had actually fought before.

Goldflow Young Noble greeted the princess then sat down next to Daoist Peng and asked: “Daoist, may I ask where you’re from?”

“Just a small sect named Everlasting Courtyard from Ancient Crimson, an island.” Daoist Peng didn’t lie.

The young noble has indeed never heard of this tiny sect before. His eyes fell on the sword as he asked: “May I take a look at your sword?”

“It’s just an heirloom, not worth your time.” Daoist Peng shook his head. Though he bragged about it before, he no longer wanted the attention.

“I apologize for my rudeness.” The young noble smiled wryly. He then whispered to the princess sitting nearby: “Your Highness, what’s special about this sword?”

Since the sword was sheathed, he didn’t see anything exceptional about the sword. He was merely curious due to her involvement.

Currently, Flame Valley Dao Institution was a lineage in possession of a heavenly sword - Flamedao. She most likely had seen it before. Therefore, her standard should be rather high which made this more interesting.

“I’m just curious.” She smiled.

She saw the sword when the daoist took it out to brag. This reminded her of some texts she had read back in her sect.

Flame Valley Dao Institution was a rather unique sect. Outsiders usually considered them as one entity with two dao lords. In reality, they were two separate sects with a total of three dao lords.

In the distant past, Flame Valley and Dao Institution used to be separate. A cultivator with the title of Flame God started the valley. It was extremely powerful and ruled over numerous kingdoms.

As for Dao Institution, it was just a mortal educational establishment despite its grand name within Flame Valley’s jurisdiction.
