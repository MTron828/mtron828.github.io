Shen Xiaoshan and the other two couldn’t gather their wits right away. That scene earlier was too shocking and they couldn’t describe it at all.

They didn’t know whether to be surprised at Li Qiye smashing Yiheng’s face or that he was able to use the Imperial Clash.

Of course, the shopkeeper was shocked as well, albeit for a different reason than the other three but still on the same magnitude. An ancient and eternal legend had appeared again before his very eyes.

Others didn’t know and thought that this man was only a mortal. However, those who knew his identity and have heard of his tales would be stricken with fear.

This was an existence that could make the gods and emperors in the tenth world palpitate and had a penchant for creating chaos.

Li Qiye gave the handkerchief soaked with blood for the shopkeeper and said: “Have a look.”

The blood that was wiped off the Imperial Clash was now depicting a lifelike picture. The shopkeeper used both hands to accept the handkerchief and saw the picture. He became astonished and bowed towards Li Qiye before carefully putting it away.

“Alright, nothing else to do here. Let’s go.” Li Qiye smiled and left the Imperial Cabinet.

The three eventually regained their composure and gave chase. Before leaving, they couldn’t help but glance at the Imperial Clash inside the cupboard again. Even though they didn’t know where this thing called Imperial Clash came from, but the power of the three thousand worlds was quite incredible. It was definitely an unstoppable weapon that could slay countless experts.

The most stirring thing was that this weapon was able to be used by a mortal. It even looked like the thing was ready to accept Li Qiye as its master.

He Chen looked up once more when he was outside at the crooked wooden sign. It was quite funny because such a shop assumed a very domineering name. But he certainly didn’t think so anymore and thought that “Imperial Cabinet” was a very suitable name.

The three simply didn’t know what to say, especially Shi Sou. He stared at Li Qiye with awe and fear, not daring to come too close.

Just think about it, Liang Yiheng was someone even his Senior Brother was wary of. But now, Li Qiye smashed his face on the ground without even batting an eye once as if he was crushing an insect. No, something even less.

It truly shook Shi Sou down to the core since Li Qiye did it in such a carefree manner. It showed that he didn’t give a damn about Yiheng or West Bank at all.

Just think about it, a mortal not caring about a cultivation country? Just what kind of power and domineering attitude were required?

More importantly, he didn’t think Li Qiye did it out of ignorance but he simply didn’t view the guy as anything noteworthy. It made him wonder about Li Qiye’s identity.

He felt that the guy was completely unfathomable and worthy of reverence. Those who carelessly oppose him would die without a grave. Shi Sou shuddered again after thinking that his head might be smashed just like Yiheng’s if he were to antagonize the guy. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He no longer viewed Li Qiye as a mortal but rather a primordial beast. Despite the guy’s harmless appearance, Shi Sou saw snow-white fangs that could tear someone’s throat off at any moment! He grew even more impressed with his Senior Brother’s insight and ability to win Li Qiye’s grace.

Shen Xiaoshan wasn’t thinking as much. In fact, she didn’t even care that Li Qiye had smashed Yiheng’s face to pieces. As she was walking alongside Li Qiye, she secretly stole glances of him and enjoyed a sweet feeling as if she was bathing in honey.

“My woman”, these words left her an amazing aftertaste. Her heart was fluttering and she felt she was up there in the clouds.

The young He Chen had a different reaction. He worriedly said: “Since you stomped Yiheng’s face in, what if West Bank takes this out on our sect instead?”

Shi Sou became nervous after hearing this since it made sense. Even though they were at Jilin, as the adage goes, a monk can run but not his temple. If West Bank were to blame this on Sago Palm, it could be completely destroyed.

“Don’t worry, I’m sure their king has no time to worry about your sect at this moment. 50,000,000 Dao Sage Chaos Stones are more than enough to make them anxious. They’re digging everywhere now and even selling their cities and resources to come up with this amount, no time to worry about anything else.” He chuckled and said.

The three glanced at each other and recalled the broken bottle. He Chen shuddered the most. Luckily, he wasn’t the one to break it or selling himself wouldn’t be enough. He was actually holding it earlier too. Even though it was in the past, his palms still became sweaty.

Li Qiye kept on walking forward. The group eventually made it to a deserted alleyway that had no visibility.

“Okay, time to stop tailing now.” Li Qiye turned around and said.

Shi Sou’s group was surprised and also turned back. At this time, they saw someone following right behind them. The guy must have been tailing them all along.

Shi Sou was thinking about other matters the entire time so he didn’t pay attention. Meanwhile, He Chen and Shen Xiaoshan were too inexperienced to worry about anything.

“Ha, quite vigilant, aren’t you now?” After being exposed, the person walked up, revealing himself to be a servant due to his uniform. However, he was a cultivator, not a mortal.

“Brothers, they got us, come out and meet our friends then.” He laughed and said.

Shadows appeared in the building all around the alleyways and slowly surrounded Li Qiye’s group with unfriendly gazes.

Shi Sou and the other two immediately circled around Li Qiye in order to protect him because he was the one without cultivation in the group.

Shi Sou observed them and found that they all wore different items of clothing. Some looked like merchants while others had traveling clothes on. Some robes had sect markings too. In short, these several dozen people were from all over the places. They were all cultivators, not mortal robbers.

The group wondered when they have offended these people.

“Alright, I don’t have time to talk nonsense with you hooligans, get your boss out.” Li Qiye leisurely said while being surrounded.

“Boss, that’s him.” The dozens made way for one youth and a man to walk forward. The man pointed at Li Qiye and said.

Shi Sou recognized this man. It was the merchant who sold fake goods earlier on the street.

They have forgotten about this matter and didn’t think that trouble would arise from that little exchange.

The person called “Boss” by the merchant was a youth. He looked only around the age of seventeen or eighteen and was a little short of stature. He wore a large robe to hide his fat stomach. This looked like a successful businessman, especially his eyes, seemingly capable of finding deals wherever he looked.
