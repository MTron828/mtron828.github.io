Chapter 4253: Saber And Swords

Li Qiye’s murderous intent became clear for all to see despite the duo’s de-escalation attempt.

These overlords had never bent their knees before until today - the most humiliating moment of their life. Alas, Li Qiye kept on pushing the issue.

“We won’t go down without a fight.” The vajra uttered coldly.

“That makes zero difference in my eyes.” Li Qiye responded.

Such a domineering statement could only be uttered by Li Qiye. He proved his eligibility after defeating the two overlords.

His opponents turned red and couldn’t stay calm. They glared furiously at him for letting them experience something so humiliating.

“Fellow Daoist, must you force the issue until the fish die or the net split?” The venerable tried his best to calm down.

“That phrase does not apply here. The likes of you have no chance to bring me down regardless of what you do. Be smart and just end yourself.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively.

“I see…” The vajra, on the other hand, wasn’t as calm: “We’ll see who will fall then!”

The venerable stared at him and agreed: “Indeed!”

These two would never pick suicide regardless of the circumstances. Death meant never having a chance to wash themselves of this humiliation. It would also destroy the reputation and prestige they used their entire life to build.

“Have it your way.” Li Qiye didn’t mind at all.

“Start the formation!” The duo shouted since negotiation time was over. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Clank!” The sword formation of Sea Emperor expanded and occupied the entire region.

The calm crowd became intimidated once more; their legs trembled with fear due to the terrible momentum exuded from the formation. Once activated, anything inside would be reduced to nothingness in the blink of an eye.

“Buzz.” At the same time, divine halos landed around the vajra and instantly blessed him with numerous grand dao. Sages and saints appeared and held numerous treasures to empower him as well.

A mighty force manifested into reality within him; he became the possessor of countless dao.

“I am boundless!” He roared and released a golden radiance.

“Buzz.” A supreme treasure emerged above him - Light of the Worlds - the patrimony weapon previously used by Void Saint Child.

This spherical ball of light rotated and seemingly tore the world apart. Spectators then heard a sound akin to flower petals blossoming.

“Boundless World!” The disciples and ancestors of Nine-wheel within the halos roared in unison.

The accumulated vitality in the halos entered the vajra’s body while the lights poured into the treasure. The vajra became young and vigorous, reaching his peak state again while standing beneath the resplendent sphere. Chaos energy took over, making him seem like a world creator.

Meanwhile, the sphere forcefully made the world spin to its rhythm.

On the other side, the sword formation was gathering vitality and sword energies as well. All of this was then channeled into the venerable. He enjoyed the same revitalization just like the vajra. His aged appearance disappeared from sight.

“Clank!” The hum of a saber could be heard. Yes, a saber, not a sword. He had taken out a crescent saber. Its rays reached the ends of the world and could decide everything.

Strangely enough, the sword energies from the formation had no problem mixing with the saber rays, amassing a sea of power.

Conflict and disharmony didn’t exist. The sword and saber dao intertwined with a perfect balance.

“Saber and Swords, the patrimony weapon of Saberlearned Dao Lord!” A king became startled.

This doa lord was rather unique. He was a golem who started his dao debut with the saber. However, he eventually swapped to the sword despite being so dominant his entire life. The sword was the dao used for his ascension.

Of course, no one found it surprising for Sea Emperor to have a patrimony weapon.
