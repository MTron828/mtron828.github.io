Chapter 3793: Jadescale Poison Whip

The third prince truly didn’t hold back since his life was on the line today.

If he were to lose and somehow survive, he would have no place in Vajra anyway after disobeying an imperial decree. Thus, victory was the only option. His other cards could come into play afterward.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Pieces of green jade began to come together to form a whip.

Once it fully assembled, it looked like a green snake with its head raised and an oscillating tongue flick.

The individual scale-like sections were sharp. It didn’t need a direct hit, just a slight brush would result in serious damage.

However, the most terrifying thing about this weapon was neither its cold glow nor its sharpness. A murderous energy was present, resembling a suffocating draconic aura. It seemed rather evil and potent; any contact would result in a withering effect.

As the third prince wielded it, the spectators felt as if a green-scaled poisonous dragon had possessed him.

“Jadescale Poison Whip!” An expert became startled after seeing the weapon.

Others didn’t know about this whip but agreed with the naming choice, at least from its appearance.

“This is the legendary heirloom of the Zhou, right?” One expert found this astonishing.

“Why does the third prince have it?!” Another blurted out. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Zhou was an influential clan in Vajra and had generations of officials. Of course, their status was far inferior compared to the Li or Zhang.

This whip was their heirloom, the strongest weapon left behind by an ancestor. It has been worshipped by the descendants and only used when absolutely necessary.

That’s why people were surprised to see the third prince with it. Nonetheless, the older experts with knowledge of the court reacted quickly and came up with a reason right away.

The Zhou certainly had a special relationship with the third prince, clearly wanting to support him in his effort for the throne. In the case of success, they might become the next Li or Zhang.

“A prince needing to use someone else’s heirloom...” A youth murmured.

“He’s not the crown prince and there are plenty of princes.” An older expert responded.

The young ones understood after hearing this. Though the third prince had plenty of notable contributions, he was still only a prince, not the successor. He naturally didn’t have access to the strongest weapons or heirlooms of Vajra.

If the royal clan were to give him these weapons, it would be improper due to the existence of the crown prince. They would be admitting wanting to replace him.

That’s where the Zhou came in - giving him exactly what he needed.

“Boom!” Hu Ben also released a torrent of vitality that virtually flip the sky over.

It contained plenty of grand dao power, piercing through the world. Halos manifested and filled the area.

“Grand Dao Sacred Physique!” His cultivation realm became apparent to the crowd.

“The young will surpass us in no time.” An older big shot became sentimental.

Hu Ben was so young yet he was already at the sacred level. Though he might not become a dao lord in the future, he would still be a mighty Heavenly Sovereign.

“Buzz.” His vitality and halos suddenly became infected by a golden shade. His body was engulfed in a golden layer with a hint of blue and bronze.

His battle intent surged, causing him to resemble a war god. His eyes flashed brightly, seemingly able to open a new world.

“Archaic Sun Battle Art! A supreme technique from the founder of Vajra, even before Vajra Dao Lord.” One ancestor became startled.

The founding king of Vajra was an incredible Heavenly Sovereign who left behind this famous art.

For a long period of time, it served as the strongest merit law of Vajra and the ultimate treasure of Martial Hall.

Later on, Vajra managed to build a relationship with Vajra Dao Lord through ample efforts. The dao lord then bestowed them various merit laws. From then on, Archaic Sun Battle Art was no longer their best merit law.

Nonetheless, this didn’t mean that it was weak. Numerous disciples and royal members wished they could learn it.

For example, the third prince didn’t have access to it while Hu Ben did. This was quite surprising.

“No wonder why people say that Hu Ben might become the next guardian of Vajra.” An important character said softly: “Or that he’s the current guardian’s disciple. There is no smoke without fire.”

“So Hu Ben was holding back.” Others exchanged glances.

Everyone assumed that Hu Ben had gone all out against the scion. This didn’t seem to be the case. He clearly had thoughts about escaping then. In that case, how would he answer to the soldiers from Vigorous Tiger Legion who died in battle? Was the fight just for show?

Thus, the crowd didn’t wish to dwell on this topic due to how sensitive it was.

“Buzz.” Phantom’s eruption of power wasn’t as flashy as the previous two.

It consisted of a strand of blood shooting upward. However, it disappeared right away, replaced by a violet aura. This aura permeated the air and Phantom disappeared.

“Where is he?” A youth wondered.

“Over there!” A keen-eyed spectator noticed a faint shadow but it disappeared once more.

“No, there!” Another one shouted. The shadow continuously appeared and disappeared within the aura.

Two scenarios seemed plausible here - either that he was moving continuously or that he was omnipresent without changing position.

“Phantom Skyshift!” Someone recognized this technique.
