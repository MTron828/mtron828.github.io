Chapter 4312: Two Girls

No one understood why their sect master had so many things to say to this street vendor. He seemed to be enjoying himself, eating wontons and sipping tea.

“Ladies, come, have a bowl of wontons.” The noodle shop’s brief peace was interrupted as the aunt noticed something. She rushed to the street and pulled two female pedestrians inside.

The moment they came in the door, a sweet breeze and a pure aura greeted members of Little Diamond. They were akin to spring bringing life back after a long winter.

One wore a fur coat, seemingly unaffected by the seasons. The other wore a black dress, clearly a maid of the other but still looking quite lovely.

Their face was hidden behind a thin veil. Nonetheless, the first girl was obviously noble due to her innate aura. She was born with a golden spoon.

They were just passing by and had no idea how the aunt managed to pull them into this shop. They were rather strong, especially the fur-coat girl. Alas, they were helpless before the aunt.

Members of Little Diamond were surprised by the aunt’s aggressive advertisement.

The two girls were actually busy but now, confusion struck. How did this woman overwhelm them so quickly?

“Ladies, here.” The aunt brought over two bowls of wonton noodle soup during their moment of confusion.

The fur-coat girl observed this woman but failed to notice anything. She then scanned the rest of the shop and saw the disciples of Little Diamond.

The latter felt as if something had just pierced through the depths of their heart. There was nothing she couldn’t see.

Elder Hu became frightened. That glare just now clearly suppressed them. This girl had enough power to kill them in the blink of an eye.

When her sight fell on Li Qiye, she couldn’t believe it and became ecstatic.

“It’s you!” She rushed over to the front of Li Qiye and said: “It’s really you! Are you doing alright now?” She took a closer look at him.

He looked up and smiled at her.

She thought that he didn’t recognize her and hurriedly pulled down her veil: “It’s me, we met at the Ice Plateau before.”

The entire shop lit up after her face was shown - ivory skin with impeccable features and a hint of nobility.

She had met Li Qiye during his astral projection and even took him back to her sect. This time around, she became more mature and imposing - enough to intimidate others despite her young age.

Her golden pupils were particularly impressive, capable of taking down any threat. The light on her forehead made her look both holy and authoritative.

The young ones from Little Diamond were stunned to see how beautiful she was. They thought that she was a goddess from above. There were pretty girls back in Little Diamond as well. Alas, they paled in comparison.

Elder Hu was more knowledgeable and recognized these visual hints, realizing that she was a top dog even in the cultivation world. How did she know their sect master?

They suddenly felt the urge to gossip and started exchanging glances. She was being too familiar with their sect master. There was obviously history between them.

“Looks like you had comprehended enough to enter the phenomena.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes.” The shy and reserved girl couldn’t contain her excitement and grabbed Li Qiye’s hand: “I have finished thanks to your guidance.”

“Congratulations, this shows that your comprehension isn’t too bad.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I would have been lost otherwise.” She felt great gratitude because his guidance allowed her to finish her cultivation and became the chosen one.

She had searched for him for a long time to no avail, eventually having no choice but to give up. Who would have thought that she would be able to coincidentally meet him in this place?

“What a development.” One disciple whispered to his peers.

“Dao enlightenment relies on the individual, for the most part. I merely showed you the way.” Li Qiye said.

“I have so many things to talk to you about.” She had no problem displaying intimacy with him for some reason. After all, she had numerous private discussions with him during his dazed state.

“No rush, have a seat and chat while eating.” The aunt seemed amused by this development. She looked as if she was staring at her own daughter.

The fur-coat girl found her expression rather strange. Nonetheless, she chose to focus on Li Qiye.

“Miss, we have to go.” The maid reminded her.

“Wait a bit.” She frowned slightly. There was indeed business on the agenda today but she wanted to stay with Li Qiye for longer.

“But the elders are waiting. If we are tardy, the trails will turn cold.” The maid whispered.

“Go, I’ll still be in Bodhistavva in the incoming days.” Li Qiye smilingly told her.

“I have a residence in the city, I’ll be waiting for you, Young Noble.” She told him her address and left begrudgingly, still waving as she was leaving.

“Come more often, haha.” The aunt waved enthusiastically at her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The thought is there, why do you still want to use someone else?” Li Qiye glanced at the aunt.

She sighed and said: “My old bones will dry up in this place, I can’t compete with the youths.”

“Is that so?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Well, you’re an exception. I’m sure this is the best choice anyway.” She said.
