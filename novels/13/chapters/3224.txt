It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the current tribulation was its ultimate form. However, Li Qiye still absorbed it while the progenitors watched on in horror.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Their astonishment was interrupted by more explosions from above.

Endless lightning bolts of a golden shade poured down, seemingly cast from gold.

“More tribulations?” One master blurted out in fear.

However, they were shocked to see that the target wasn’t Li Qiye but rather the needles pinned on him. Why would this golden tribulation aim for its own allies?

The crystal needles shattered as a result. Bright fragments shot out in a beautiful manner.

This was the first time they have ever seen the high heaven destroying its own tribulation. In fact, it seemed unprecedented and unheard of.

They eventually realized that it couldn’t do anything to Li Qiye and was left with no choice. This was the only way to prevent Li Qiye from absorbing the entire ocean of tribulations, fully robbing the high heaven of its power.

“Only Li Qiye can do something like this in history.” One progenitor murmured.

Not to mention regular experts, even the peerless progenitors have never thought about attempting to rob the high heaven, let alone actually carrying it out. Li Qiye was the only exception.

This was so ridiculous that no one would believe this story without seeing in person.

Of course, it didn’t matter whether regular people believe it or not. At their height, all other beings were mere specks of dust.

“Boom!” Li Qiye’s thirteen palaces showed up and hovered around his true fate.

He didn’t need any aura. The presence of his supreme true fate forced all the masters to kneel before him.

Beneath was a surging ocean exuding a power mighty enough to horrify three thousand worlds.

Why? It was an ocean of tribulations stolen from the high heaven. Random bolts would shoot out at times, wanting to escape.

“Boom!” Li Qiye’s true fate gradually entered the ocean. This created a massive lightning tsunami, causing the progenitors to quiver.

The bolts in the ocean naturally struck his true fate, eager to crush it to pieces.

“Insanity...” The spectators gasped at this sight.

It was common knowledge that a true fate was at its weakest after leaving the body and especially the palaces. Yet, he still chose to move it to an expanse of ultimate tribulations. Nothing else could be crazier than this.

“Buzz.” The four symbols of the palace lit up and four items flew out - Ancient Void Rune, Heavenly Dao’s Primal Chapter, Life Origination, and Epoch Leaf.

They attached themselves to his true fate for a full assembly. Then this new entity sank completely into the lighting ocean.

“Rumble!” The world seemed to be spinning from the wrath of this ocean. More tsunami mercilessly smashed the sky, once again suppressing all inhabitants.

However, the thirteen palaces sealed the ocean and its power, not allowing anything to leak out from the area. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Nonetheless, the spectators were still scared out of their mind and completely drenched in cold sweats.

They were afraid that this ocean would be able to break out. These waves alone would drown and destroy the expanse and Three Immortals.

Luckily, the thirteen palaces did an amazing job. The raging ocean failed to get past its line of defense.

As time passed, its power weakened. It started sinking with less water and lightning.

This process was quite fast. The ocean was now the size of a lake.

“He’s using the ocean to refine his true fate, it’s still absorbing the tribulation right now.” Everyone had a strange expression on their face, speechless.

What could they really say? If their true fate was struck by one bolt, that would be the end of them. On the other hand, he was treating the tribulations like nutritious delicacies. Words were no longer sufficient to describe him.

The lake eventually turned into a pond. “Buzz.” Finally, his true fate absorbed the entire ocean. Not even a single drop was wasted.

His true fate hovered there, looking immaculate and unique. No one else had something like this.

It pulsed with an immortal light as if it was the origin of the myriad dao. With it, Li Qiye became the ruler and the creator of an epoch. All the laws and orders would start from him and be under his control.

Absorbing the tribulation was obviously a great development. However, the most important thing was that he had managed to refine the four peerless symbols into his true fate.

In fact, it reached an unprecedented level. Hypothetically, if a true immortal were to exist, their true fate might not be comparable to Li Qiye’s right now.

“Ancient Primal Origination Epoch Myriad Tribulation True Fate.” Li Qiye gave his true fate a new title, one representing ultimate strength. [1]

“This true fate alone is invincible, it’s all one needs. Nothing else matters, one can have a mortal physique and still be the same as having an immortal physique.” One of the three immortals emotionally commented.

1. Yes, the name in English is silly. This might be the silliest one so far. It’s not bad at all in Chinese since it takes one character each from the four symbols then adds myriad tribulations to it, just 8 syllables versus 17 syllables in English. The more I look at it, the more ridiculous it seems. Ah, heck, I’ll name it Tetra Tribulation True Fate. I’m keeping the original name in the passage for now and changing it later just so that this note would make sense
