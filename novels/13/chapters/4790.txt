Chapter 4791: Wrath Of The High Heaven

Nothing could stop Li Qiye’s punch including Tian Tu’s My Dao.

After the initial blast, everyone felt themselves being crushed and exploding. Some eternal existences had access to the best merit laws and even epoch artifacts. Alas, none of these could save them from the punch.

“That is why he has been undefeated all this time.” The existences hiding deep in space and old earths became startled.

The distance between them and the battlefield was immense. Nonetheless, the punch still shocked these epoch lords.

“I… can’t stop this.” A pair of eyes in the abyss flashed brightly and came up with this dreadful conclusion.

Some of them carried out incredible conquests before. Alas, they found themselves insufficient for once. It became abundantly clear who was the true lord of the current epoch.

However, the most surprising thing wasn’t the punch itself but rather, a lightning bolt descending from above.

It illuminated Eight Desolaces and the minor realms. It had the shape of a dragon and the intensity of a thrusting spear, wielding the power of numerous tribulations. 

The high heaven’s wrath demanded punishment for Li Qiye.

“Damn!” The crowd lay down on the ground; some immediately fainted. The same thing applied to cultivators in other regions.

Their response stemmed from an instinctive fear, not an outward suppression. This fear has been there since birth and carved into the soul. Resisting it was virtually impossible.

“It’s here… a heavenly annihilation.” The lords of ages in the forbidden zones turned pale.

They themselves couldn’t overcome this instinctive fear, let alone regular cultivators. They couldn’t stop the tribulations, hence the need to live in the shadows.

Its power was different from Li Qiye's. His punch possessed absolute power and destruction while the tribulation originated from a divine force that had created the universe.

“Rumble!” The battlefield instantly crumbled.

Silence took over as everyone kept still. The lords in the forbidden zones didn’t dare to converse with each other later.

After a while, they regained their wits and stopped being so intimidated by the tribulation.

“Dead?” A supreme existence in an abyss asked.

The wrath of the heaven had done a number on their kind - either grievously injure or kill them.

“That was a serious hit, a grand tribulation.” Another eternal being answered.

Tribulations in their mind were completely different from the ones known to the public.

When talking about tribulations, regular cultivators normally referred to the ones experienced by dao lords during their ascension. As for the eternal existences, it had to do with the wrath of the heaven.

“It’s still so strong, will it ever weaken?” Someone else hiding in the void murmured.

Numerous epochs have passed, meaning that there have been countless expeditions. Alas, these grand tribulations were still so strong.

Eventually, the dust clouds dispersed, the same with the ocean of lightning. 

They began paying attention again and saw Li Qiye standing there, bloodied. He looked up at the sky and found it reactionless.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The wounds on his body were caused by the lightning bolts, not his opponent - Tian Tu. He used his body to withstand the bolts instead of putting on defensive measures.

“This monster… he is absolutely qualified to start an expedition.” One lord took a deep breath since Li Qiye wasn’t crippled from the tribulation.

They realized that the current him could actually fight the high heaven. This was different from previous expeditions.

Top masters had the right to start expeditions but this didn’t mean that they were actually qualified to fight the apex.

Now, Li Qiye directly withstood a tribulation without backing an inch. Not all expedition starters could have done this.

“Maybe the very end is in sight during this epoch.” A supreme overlord said.

They have been slumbering for epochs now after terrible expeditions resulting in unhealable injuries. 

They were once invincible, accomplishing peerless deeds and creating unforgettable legends. Alas, they couldn’t win and had to live a pathetic life hiding from the high heaven, away from the sun and the world.

Li Qiye’s strength actually showed them a glimmer of hope. There might be changes happening at the distant end in the future.

“This epoch will be different.” The lord of a forbidden zone said.

They actually didn’t know if Li Qiye’s existence was a blessing or otherwise.

After all, he might bear his fangs against them first before starting an expedition against the high heaven. Now, it seemed that they were powerless to stop him.

To put it frankly, their lives were no longer under their control.

“Who knows what the future holds? It is up to a single whim of his.” Another ancient existence whispered.

They found themselves to be as feeble and helpless just like the inhabitants of this world.
