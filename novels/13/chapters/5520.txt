Chapter 5521: Spoiling The Mood

The crowd thought that the challenge was reasonable - Shaoyun should have this opportunity to do a check for the sake of the sect.

“Fool.” The goddess murmured.

The matron let out a sigh and didn’t stop him.

“If you disagree with our decision, you may ask my sword first.” Qin Baifeng said domineeringly.

Putting her superior position aside, she was still stronger than him. This left him in a tough position but Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand: “I got this.”

“Finally, and here I thought you would keep hiding behind women.” Shaoyun uttered coldly.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Li Qiye shook his head and said: “A dragon lord yet still so idiot. The valley will remove you.”

“Hahaha!” Shaoyun burst out in laughter and said: “Remove me? Who do you think you are?! You will be dead to my blade first!”

“Boom!” His vitality erupted and four sacred fruits manifested into reality, releasing a domineering aura.

“Brat, accept death!” He created a dao sword with frightening energy.

Members of the valley became afraid since just the rays alone could decapitate them.

“Take this blad-” Alas, he couldn’t finish speaking before Li Qiye raised his hand and controlled the immortal light of the valley.

“Damn!” He saw this and raised his sword for a parry. Unfortunately, it was too late.

The beam struck him with an unstoppable power. This was something far beyond his ability to block.

“Ahh!” He instantly exploded into a bloody mist. The wind blew him away, leaving nothing behind outside of an astounded crowd including the matron.

Qin Baifeng and the goddess didn’t know how to feel either. They couldn’t get through the immortal light while Li Qiye was able to control it like a weapon.

Shaoyun being obliterated was expected but how did Li Qiye do so? Could he control the immortal artifact as well?

The goddess had suspected something similar but this still exceeded her imagination.

“The mood of this beautiful place was ruined by a cockroach.” Li Qiye said with a smile while the crowd still needed a moment to calm down.

The light followed Li Qiye like a dragon as he entered the valley.

“Buzz.” Whatever was deeper inside the valley became more resplendent, unleashing an ocean of brilliance capable of drowning the sect.

Fortunately, it merely filled out the valley and didn’t leave the entrance.

“It’s not leaking out, that’s good.” Many disciples heaved a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye disappeared from sight.

“The immortal artifact will have an owner soon.” The goddess murmured.

“Just who is he?” Qin Baifeng took a deep breath. She was blown away by just one stream of that light while he strolled through an entire ocean.

“The one awaited…” The matron stared at Li Qiye’s back and realized something.

***

Initially, Li Qiye was not interested in this artifact after hearing about its legend and connection to Cloudsweep Fairy. He changed his mind after seeing the actual light and wanted to see it in person.

“Boom!” The artifact seemed to know of Li Qiye’s intent and didn’t welcome him.

Alas, its direct power couldn’t affect him in the slightest. It then showed him wondrous phenomena - an immortal scripture with dao laws. Another dao capable of seeing the intent of the heaven. In fact, even the nine Heavenly Scriptures were shown rotating…

The latter was more tempting than anything else. Eyes couldn’t be averted from their profundities. The nine scriptures were simply divine and coveted by all. Supreme geniuses and unbeatable emperors weren’t exceptions.

“Only others, not me.” He shook his head and moved forward.

Every time he stared directly at a phenomenon or walked by one, they immediately collapsed. At the end of the valley was an immortal light, akin to the flame within a lamp.

Instead of being connected to a lamp, it seemed to be growing on top of a special soil created by peerless laws. Despite its physical limitation, it could expand to be boundless. Its form kept on changing in an indiscernible manner.

The light suddenly extinguished the moment Li Qiye drew near.
