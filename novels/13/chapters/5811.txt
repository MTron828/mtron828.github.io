Chapter 5811: I’ll Put An End To You All

The three old men wore similar outfits from an ancient era. Their figure seemed blurry as if time had worn away the edges, giving them an illusory appearance. Nevertheless, they each bore a unique mark impervious to the passage of time, representing their race.

One of them had the mark of Heaven Authority like other heaveners. However, his was the largest and purest, seemingly made from gold and capable of pushing up the world.

Although it was on his forehead, spectators had the illusion that it hovered in the air - a symbol of authority. A heavener could be as strong as an emperor or as weak as a mortal; they still had to kneel before him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Another one possessed a pair of profound yellow eyes. They resembled precious gems with no end in sight. Looking at it was akin to plunging into the abyss of profound mysteries. People would only recall his eyes, not his actual appearance.

These eyes could only be found on devils possessing the immortal bloodline. However, the others weren’t of this mystical level, not even the late Brilliant Devil Emperor.

The final old man had a disk on the back of his head containing untold divinity. This was a unique trait of the diviners. The higher the amount of divinity, the stronger.

His disk carried enough energy to be crafted into a holy world. Anything born there could become a god automatically. Eternal Conqueror possessed this immortal bloodline but his disk couldn’t compare to this old man’s.

They were the strongest diviner, heavener, and devil - Li Qiye’s next foes.

“Heaven Authority, Devil Bestowment, Divine Eternal, you old geezers just can’t die.” Li Qiye smiled.

They shared the same name as the immortal bloodlines.

Upon hearing this, listeners shuddered despite having speculations of this prior. Did the three immortal bloodlines originate from them?

None could answer this but one thing was for certain - these beings’ bloodlines were far older than anything previously seen.

“Can’t die before you, Dark Crow.” Devil Bestowment said.

“When it comes to age, all of you should be dropping dead right now.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“If only we had killed you back then.” The glint in Divine Eternal’s eyes could make emperors and dragon lords tremble in horror.

“I’m afraid it wouldn’t have gone as planned.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “It could have been fun back then but unfortunately, you turtles made me wait until now.”

“Let’s end it today then.” Heaven Authority uttered coldly.

“Yes, I’ll put an end to you all today.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Hmph.” Devil Bestowlment scowled.

“Don’t act offended, old turtle. You lot and Human Ancestor aren’t enough anymore, it’s too easy for me.” Li Qiye said.

“Your arrogance grows untethered.” Heaven Authority remarked.

“It’s the truth, I’m more interested in your backers anyway.” Li Qiye said.

The trio exchanged glances upon hearing this.

“Looks like you aren’t sure either despite being the messengers for the blood branch. Will your Lord of Derivation and Primal Ancestor show up or will they keep hiding?” Li Qiye said.

Listeners contemplated the issue. They knew the two branches in Celestial Court but the facts remained vague.

Only some were eligible to enter, only the strongest among them such as Sword, Profound, and Hao Hai. These men were a part of the dao branch belonging to Dao Ancestor, Imperial Progenitor of Myriad Realms, and Stonesplitter Patriarch.

Nether, the three immortals, Light-dragon, Heaven Burial, and a few more stood with the blood branch.

As for the founder or Human Ancestor, some believed he was with the dao branch while others considered him to have a special status - belonging to neither.

Except for the founder and the three immortals, none had seen the overlords before because they weren’t qualified.

“They will come out when it is the right time.” Divine Eternal said.

“When I chop off your heads, is that the right time?” Li Qiye smiled: “I doubt it, they will just watch.”
