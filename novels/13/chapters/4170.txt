Chapter 4171: Miracle Versus Miracle

“A hidden master?” One expert said after seeing the man easily doing something no one else could.

“I’ve never heard of someone being able to do this.” A big shot replied.

The important characters thought about this repeatedly and couldn’t come up with a historical character matching this middle-aged man.

“He must be from a famous sect.” Another expert whispered.

No one had a problem with this statement. Only a large sect would be able to produce a cultivator with this magical ability. Alas, they still couldn’t match him up with a particular sect.

“How is he unknown?” A high elder wondered while watching the floating divine swords.

“Sir, where are you from?” One cultivator finally walked forward and bowed deeply to ask.

The middle-aged man didn’t answer, either not hearing him or not scaring in the slightest.

The cultivator became awkward and smiled wryly, not daring to say anything else. After all, this man should be a hidden master. Provoking someone like that wouldn’t end well.

“So unreal, this is comparable to a feat from a dao lord.” One youth commented.

“No, not even dao lords can do this. They came here before and didn’t obtain the divine swords so easily.” An ancestor shook his head.

“Who the hell is he?” This question bothered everyone.

Alas, the guy seemed rather eccentric and distant. He ignored everyone so it became impossible to figure out more information.

“I can’t believe he doesn’t want any of them.” One spectator said.

They were jealous because numerous divine swords had floated up at this point. If he had gathered them, he would have more divine swords than any other sect in Sword Continent. This would be a treasury expensive enough to make people go crazy and fight to the death.

“I just want one, I’ll even call him grandpa.” A youth from a small sect shamelessly said.

Of course, the middle-aged man still ignored him.

“Too many crazy people nowadays, can’t make sense of anything anymore.” One ancestor sighed and reflected.

“Who is he?” Snowcloud Princess asked Li Qiye.

The two of them had also arrived at Sword Abyss and were watching the middle-aged man. She was in awe after seeing how easily this man summoned those divine swords.

This made her think of Li Qiye. If anyone could do something so insane and miraculous, he would be the first person on her mind.

However, this wasn’t the case here. She stared at him, hoping for an answer.

“Interesting.” Li Qiye smirked and rubbed his chin while observing the middle-aged man.

He didn’t answer the question and started walking closer to the man.

“Li Qiye? Why is he here?” The crowd clamored after seeing him. They even made a path for him to get through.

“The sorcerer is here.” One expert said.

“Sorcery versus sorcery.” A last-gen member said: “No, miracle versus miracle. Is Li Qiye up to it?”

“It would be very interesting.” The crowd talked among themselves.

Li Qiye was the world’s richest right now, capable of performing some outrageous deeds despite his weak cultivation. The word “impossible” was not in his dictionary.

They felt as if he was the only one who could match this mysterious middle-aged man.

“A mountain can’t have two tigers, will they fight?” One youth murmured.

“A fight might be too much but a contest is possible. It’ll be great to watch.” His friend said.

Everyone else was overwhelmed with anticipation, wanting to see which was the most devilish of the two.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye was standing next to the man who was still tossing out scrap metal. The latter stopped and turned around.

“It’s happening, it’s happening!” Many took a deep breath.

Though the man was only turning around, this still shocked the crowd more than a formidable attack.

Prior to this, ancestors and kings tried to talk to this man to no avail. He never reacted to any of them, not even a single glance. Now, Li Qiye only got close and hasn’t said anything but still got a response.

Li Qiye smiled as the two stood face to face. Though half of the man’s face was covered by his hair, he still gazed at Li Qiye.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Time seemed to be shifting to the past. The scene became deathly still and silent.

In reality, a temporal stagnation was actually happening. Everyone else disappeared right away. Only Li Qiye and the man existed as time reverted back to the primordial.
