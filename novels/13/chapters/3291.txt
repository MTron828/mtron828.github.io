Most of the crowd knew that Liu Wenyong was furious after listening to him.

“This brat is dead, what a shame, he’s even dragging another life down with him.” One spectator gloated.

“The guy asked for it, only a fool would get so close to this piece of trash.” Another said with disdain.

Few felt bad for Lu Daowei because they thought that he was seeking death for joining up with Li Qiye.

“Begin.” An elder shouted.

“Please give me pointers, Senior Brother.” Daowei had no choice but to close his eyes and go for it after teaming up with Li Qiye. He believed that he was about to get a bad beating.

“Fool!” Wenyong roared and exuded violet energy.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” This energy erupted threefold. Everyone could sense his power increasing three times.

Violet Marquis Corpus - this level would let one go wild and increase their battle potential three times without any side effect later.

Many felt the pressure after this eruption and staggered backward. This realm was quite mighty in the sect.

Even Zhan Hu who was born with a golden spoon was only one realm higher at Conqueror Vessel. Thus, anyone in this corpus realm could be considered brilliant.

“He transformed.” Some didn’t expect this because it meant Wenyong wasn’t going to show mercy.

“The guy is done.” A few sneered. They could already see the sad fate of Li Qiye and Daowei, being reduced to meat paste.

“Go, show him what you got.” Li Qiye smiled and pushed Daowei’s shoulder.

Daowei involuntarily punched forward - the first movement of Tortoise Fist!

It looked like a slow push without any force.

“Wow, so strong!” Many disciples started laughing.

Such a slow and weak punch wouldn’t do any damage to someone who was standing still.

“Yeah, this punch can really decide the outcome of a fight, guaranteeing defeat for its user!” More jeered.

The elders themselves were surprised to see this. It probably couldn’t hit a three-year-old, let alone someone at the corpus realm.

“I’m going to crush you!” Wenyong took this as a taunt and unleashed a palm strike towards the two.

Meanwhile, Daowei was in a daze. He suddenly had an illusion that he was one with heaven and earth while his fist was moving forward. He completely forgot about his opponent.

He became the sole existence in the world. The myriad dao fused into him and let him borrow their power.

His punch was still as slow as ever but he had entered a zen state. The movement of his fist began dragging the worldly rhythms.

It skirted Wenyong’s palm in a natural manner, easily moving through its flaws. The speed and trajectory remained the same. Daowei found the whole thing to be surreal just like a dream.

Suddenly, the elders and Zhang Yue also felt the momentum of the area missing half a beat.

This phenomenon was as subtle as can be. They only noticed for the blink of an eye due to their powerful cultivation. Ordinary disciples didn’t feel a single thing.

They still didn’t have time to understand before a loud bang. “Boom!” Daowei successfully punched Wenyong’s cheek and sent him flying.

“Pluff!” Blood gushed out along with broken teeth to everyone’s astonishment.

How could this be?!

The power gap between the two sides was insurmountable. Wenyong should have been able to smash Li Qiye and Daowei to pieces. Alas, he had just lost to Tortoise Fist.

“Impossible!” One elder stood up and yelled.

“Bam!” Wenyong fell to the ground, unconscious.

If the punch and the fall didn’t make him unconscious, he would have pretended to be anyway. Losing to Tortoise Fist was just too humiliating. He wouldn’t be able to walk around with his head high in the sect any longer.

It took a while for the stunned crowd to calm down. They stared at Wenyong and had no idea what was going on.

“This makes no sense.” Some of them blurted out. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Not that many among the crowd were actually stronger than him. Defeating him wasn’t an easy task, especially not with Tortoise Fist. This seemed like a dream but they all witnessed it in person.

“What did he do?” An elder glanced at Lu Daowei then focused on Li Qiye.

The change in rhythm happened too quickly so the elders and Zhang Yue didn’t have a definite conclusion. One elder even glanced at Gong Qianyue, thinking that she must have gotten involved.

Huang Ning and Zhan Hu weren’t doing any better. They had no idea like the rest. Both turned towards Gong Qianyue.

There was only one logical possibility - her involvement. That’s the only way for Wenyong to lose.

However, why did a genius like her decide to help a useless person like Li Qiye?

In fact, Daowei himself experienced the same confusion since he knew his own power the best. He started staring at his hand and wasn’t sure that he was the one who knocked out Wenyong’s teeth.

He glanced back at Li Qiye, thinking that it must have something to do with Li Qiye’s push. That brought him to a unique domain.

“Everything was good, precise movements too. Just no more hesitation next time because the enemy won’t hesitate from taking your life.” Li Qiye chuckled.

The only one here who had a clear idea was Gong Qianyue since she was the closest to Li Qiye. She knew that it had nothing to do with Daowei; Li Qiye was the culprit!
