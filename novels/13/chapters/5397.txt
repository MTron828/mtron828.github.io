Chapter 5398: One Thought, All Obey

In the upper continents, there was a saying stating that wherever Illumination Conqueror was, Riverwalker Conqueror was also around. Of course, this was an exaggeration but it was close to reality enough.

Riverwalker was Illumination’s junior brother. They have been together through many trials and rarely separated.

Although they no longer needed to rely on each other to survive, they still maintained the same close relationship as before.

“The true fighting force of Azure School.” Skysword Dao Lord had a serious expression.

It seemed that Illumination Conqueror was determined to capture Yi Fantian at all costs today.

“Shall we fight to the death today, gentlemen?” Riverwalker Conqueror shouted.

The two sides glared at each other - a scene that was often seen back in Emperors War between the fighting force of Eight Desolaces and Azure School.

While Illumination had lost the war, he still had many powerful followers such as Devil and Riverwalker Conqueror.

If it wasn’t for All-things Dao Lord leading the way, Illumination would have been able to maintain control over Dao Alliance.

Some among The People thought that All-things Dao Lord stole?Illumination’s crowning achievement - Dao Alliance. In reality, those from Eight Desolaces played a big part in its founding. It’s just that Illumination Conqueror got the majority of the credit.

“Kil them!” Devil Conqueror didn’t waste time and unleashed the power of the devils behind him.

“Bring it!” Skysword Dao Lord released an expanse of sword dao to meet him directly.

“Go!” Heavenwheel and Saberlearned led the others into battle.

Stars were obliterated in the region as they were fighting. The auras from these combatants actually emanated across Dream Abyss.

Cultivators in this region felt their monstrous powers but didn’t dare to come close. They trembled in horror, aware that any greedy attempt to watch would result in death.

“Not another Emperors War…” Not a single soul could stay calm.

Ancestor-level characters trembled in fear while dragon lords and conquerors’ expressions soured.

Ancestors were normally unbeatable characters in the eyes of the juniors. Ancient ancestors were even beyond that.

However, they were nothing compared to conquerors and dao lords. On an actual battlefield involving the latter, they would be crushed like insects.

Therefore, these imperious cultivators were utterly frightened, no longer maintaining their calm and collected image. A single shockwave from this battlefield could reduce them to dust. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Cultivators desired to watch battles between top cultivators in order to get a deeper insight into the dao. However, a grand war would benefit no one.

Meanwhile, Devil and Riverwalker Conqueror led Azure School to stop Swordsky and the others, vying for time so that Illumination could escape Dream Abyss.

However, All-things Dao Lord was right behind him, capable of detecting his temporal river after having been allies once. Their familiarity with each other made it difficult for one to emerge victoriously.

“Clang!” An anima thrust suddenly tried to pierce All-things’ dao heart. Supreme had joined the fight as well with a fatal technique.

“One thought, all obey!” All-things had to stop the case and chanted to activate his anima power, creating an infinite expanse to stop the thrust.

Although Supreme’s technique was emotionless, it would start becoming sentient and hopeful in this massive expanse. The moment it had emotions, it would lose its sharpness - unable to break out of the mortal coil.
