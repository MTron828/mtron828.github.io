The group made their way onto the battlefield after ample preparation. They had a formation ready for the push.

Li Qiye had taught them a mighty formation that was suitable for the seven of them.

“Boom!” The moment they got inside, the ground suddenly cracked open and a corpse jumped out.

This corpse belonged to a giant and was considerably taller than the group. It had four arms, two coming from the ribs. Each was grabbing a sword just as tall as the monster. The swords have rusted but were still full of divinity.

“Let’s go!” The group exchanged glances before roaring. They started glowing with runes appearing beneath them.

They relied on the same strategy as before - Jiankun taking the vanguard with his sword and shield.

He rushed forward, each step carried enough power to issue loud explosions.

However, he didn’t make contact before the corpse disappeared from sight. It instantly emerged again inside their formation and caught them off guard.

“Whoosh!” It swung all four swords mercilessly at Guo Jiahui.

“Here!” Jiahui hurriedly retaliated with a horizontal slash straight at the four swords.

“Boom!” She couldn’t withstand the impact and got blown flying while vomiting blood.

The corpse didn’t let up and released a long sword energy wave straight for her. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The alarmed girl summoned a shield but it got destroyed. The slash made direct contact.

“Watch it!” The group shouted.

“Crack!” The sounds of bones breaking appeared and the defensive barrier around her crumbled.

“Buzz.” She got teleported away.

“Take it down!” The group finally caught up to the corpse and attacked.

However, the four swords danced wildly. The group couldn’t hold on for long and got repelled as well.

“Buzz...” Their defensive barrier crumbled one by one and they were forced out of the battlefield.

The group didn’t last long against this powerful corpse. Li Qiye didn’t comment on their failure.

After a while, the group appeared by the entrance again for another attempt.

“Idiots.” Li Qiye coldly uttered without bothering to look at them: “Beaten even before using the formation, you would have died a thousand times already on this battlefield with such meager skills.”

The group lowered their head in shame. This was the most powerful foe they have seen since their training.

Alas, they were actually underestimating the enemy. A while ago, certain trials took them down but they always came back victoriously. Thus, they became complacent and overconfident in their skills and teamwork.

Unfortunately, they couldn’t even utilize their formation this time around before being defeated.

Li Qiye threw them some ointments and said: “If you lose after one or two moves again, just go back to Mountguard.”

He was easy to speak to normally but his stricter side came out during training.

The group accepted the medicines and recovered. This ointment was amazing, allowing them to heal from grievous injuries right away.

They asked their progenitor for help once more before re-entering the battlefield.

“Boom!” They released their vitality and true energy so runes emerged around them.

The formation beneath their feet appeared once more with loud rumbling resembling the opening of a treasure grove. They became shrouded in bright lights.

Though no visual phenomena appeared from this manifestation of power, it looked like they had a power source in their chest.

One could sense the majestic power from the formation already even before an attack. They stuck to the right positions and the radius of the formation turned into an endless source of power.

The name of this supreme formation taught by Li Qiye was Seven Stars Hidden Formation. He created it himself.

The group tried their best to learn it along the way and became quite proficient at it.

They were no longer in a hurry and preferred to be prudent as they pushed closer towards the four-armed corpse.

“Clank!” The corpse chaotically slashed at the group, resulting in powerful sword waves.

“Boom!” The formation opened like a peerless treasure trove. Four shields flew out and stopped the incoming slashes.

“It’s time!” Jiankun gave the order and performed the same steps forward again. Thousands of weapons hidden in the formation rushed forward with him.

The corpse retaliated with four palm strikes. They pressed down from above with enough force to crush the sky.

Jiankun and his weapons barely stopped the suppressive palms. More golden light oozed from the treasury. Numerous pillars appeared and support his frame, allowing him to withstand the attacks.

Alas, his cultivation was insufficient so he staggered backward.

At this moment, his allies took action. Zhao Zhiting performed her Encroaching Flame and the treasury resonated with her. It also released a flame dragon.

The beast roared and flew straight towards the corpse. Meanwhile, the two Ling brothers also activated the formation. They turned into divine eagles with iron claws and started an assault.

Wang Xuehong tapped into the treasury and unleashed a flurry of stars.

As for Ruoxi, she gained the power of a dragon and began distracting the corpse.

Jiahui joined in with lightning speed. The treasury turned her into the sharpest spear thrust straight at the corpse’s chest.

This move was impressive enough because the formation granted her both sharpness and plentiful grand dao power.

The spear penetrated the corpse’s hands and reached its chest. Alas, it still managed to prevent any real damage by parrying with two swords.

The corpse became crazy and activated a sword formation above its head. A rain of swords started descending.

The group roared and utilized their own formation to the limit. It built a divine wall to stop the wave of swords.

The great formation allowed them to use powers far above their current cultivation. Most importantly, it was versatile enough to deal with any situation, switching from offense to defense in the blink of an eye.

Alas, they were still too weak and couldn’t actually use the formation to its true potential.

“Rumble!” The fight became unfavorable and the formation frontline was being affected.

“Fool, your Virtuous Crown isn’t mere decoration, use this powerful treasure already.” Li Qiye loudly reminded the girl.

“Buzz.” She activated her crown, releasing the holy power within.
