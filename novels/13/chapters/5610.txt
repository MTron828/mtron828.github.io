Chapter 5611: Let’s Go Then!

Niu Fen let out a sigh and continued: “We were only dealing with Celestial Court while the empress’ forces had to take down that overlord with High Heaven Aegis. That fight resembled the apocalypse with dreadful fiends, powerful beyond imagination. We were but insects, unable to assist.”1

His eyes gleamed brightly as he recalled the shocking battle: “Fortunately, the empress and Lunargrasp Immortal Monarch still dominated with a suppression art and an immortal dao. High Heaven Aegis never stopped fueling them, that was the only way to keep it competitive. If we had joined in, we would have been blown to smithereens.”0

“Quite a feat indeed.” Li Qiye said.2

Niu Fen nodded in agreement: “Heaven Assailant Emperor also received the power of the primordial tree but this alone wasn’t enough. Bi’an Beastworld’s endless reconstruction and the connection of the other masters allowed them to survive the initial blast. Otherwise, they would have been dead before getting to fight at all.”5

“The power of insects working together. Teamwork made it possible.” Li Qiye said before glancing upward. Deep in the sky was an entity resembling both a star and an ancient temple.7

It seemed to be the center of Thousand Emperor Island and Imperial Field. Everything seemed to be rotating around this foundation.0

“That is Empress Palace, some call it Empress Star. The empress used to stay there but I don’t think she is still around after Grand Dao War. Only a few can make it there, not even apex cultivators.” Niu Fen followed his gaze and commented on the unreachable location.0

“Because she doesn’t want visitors.” Li Qiye sighed and said.1

“That’s in line with the legends.” Niu Fen said: “The self-proclaimed unbeatable masters of Celestial Court were all beaten down. Lunargrasp Immortal Monarch couldn’t climb up the first time and needed to use the power of Immortal Dao City to make it there. No one knew what happened then, only that space shook violently, so a fight between them seemed likely. It could have been a friendly contest as well.”8

Li Qiye seemed sentimental and didn’t answer.0

“Someone else made it there later on.” Niu Fen said.0

“Duality.” Li Qiye knew the answer right away.0

“Right, Duality Master. Lunargrasp Immortal Monarch was stopped the first time but Duality Master had no problem reaching that place. He stayed for a while too.” Niu Fen said.0

This put a smile on Li Qiye’s face.8

“Haha, you should go, Young Master. I’m sure the imperial gate will open for you.” Niu Fen winked.0

“No point, just an empty palace.” Li Qiye responded.0

“I suppose.” Niu Fen had a sad expression as he said: “The empress and her allies didn’t return after the battle. High Heaven Aegis was unreachable afterward too.”0

“Rumble!” Outside of Thousand Emperor Island, dark clouds engulfed an ocean with bloody flashes and lightning, looking frightening and ominous.0

“Lightning Realm again.” Spectators on the island discussed the matter.0

“I wonder how long it will last this time.” A big shot commented.0

“It’s a rare opportunity, might as well go to see if we can figure something out.” Another murmured.1

“It’s not that simple, it’s easy to go insane there.” A Grand Emperor warned the group and killed the excitement.0

“True, Sindragon and Thousand-hand Dao Lord never returned, I wonder what’s in there.” One spectator said.0

“It’s abnormal.” Niu Fen gazed at the dark expanse.0

“Not formed overnight.” Li Qiye took a look as well; his gaze pierced into its deepest crevices.0

“I believe it has been around for a long time now, there are some changes though, those bloody flashes. Some emperors and monarchs entered before but didn’t return. I also took a look before and in my opinion, the heaven is torn.” Niu Fen said.0

“It’s just space, not heaven.” Li Qiye responded.0

Niu Fen shrugged and went on: “I don’t know the details since I ran after taking one glance. Some stuff happened afterward.”0

Having said that, he looked around and lowered his voice: “There are issues with High Heaven Aegis, I suspect that this has something to do with them.”0

“And you still didn’t check it out.” Li Qiye said.0

“Haha, we all know that High Heaven Aegis belongs to the empress’ group. Hehe, if they’re still around and I force my way in, well, you already know how aggressive they can be, Young Master. Like Heaven Assailant Emperor who doesn’t like anyone, I don’t want to die.” Niu Fen said.0

“They won’t kill you, the worst is a bit of stomping.” Li Qiye smiled.0

“See, that’s why I didn’t do it. It’s not easy for me to fix my shell, I’m not the type to work for nothing.” Niu Fen shook his head.0

“Just say that you’re afraid, don’t try to justify it.” Li Qiye laughed and tapped his shell.3

Niu Fen laughed and looked at a different gateway, wanting to go.0

“We can get going already since you want to see your lover.” Li Qiye smiled.3

“Young Master, what are you saying? I’m just going to see a friend, that’s all.” Niu Fen blushed for a second but arched his back and corrected Li Qiye.7

“A friend? Does an apex dao lord hesitate this much when coming to see a friend?” Li Qiye gave him the side eye.0

“I’m not hesitating at all.” Niu Fen said: “It’s been a while since we last met so I’m just trying to remember the old dialect.”0

“What old dialect, you two didn’t meet in your home region. It’s a bit sad watching how scared you are.” Li Qiye said.0

“Pah!” Niu Fen said: “I, an apex dao lord, have never been afraid of anyone during my rampage…”0

“Okay, okay.” Li Qiye waved his hand: “Enough at this blustering attempt to muster courage. Do we need to go get a drink first?”0

“Young Master, you’re really underestimating me. Courage is the one thing I do not lack.” Niu Fen complained.0

“You’ve been bragging for a while but still didn’t move an inch.” Li Qiye said.0

“Let’s go then!” The embarrassed Niu Fen puffed up his chest and took a step forward.0Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After taking a few steps, he turned back and whispered: “Hehe, Young Master, do you have a wine that can make dao lords drunk? Give me a few jars.”2

“So much for not needing a drink, how embarrassing.” Li Qiye replied.
