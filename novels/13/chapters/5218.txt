Chapter 5219: Eighteen Images

Everyone was dumbfounded including Xiao Qingtian. After his attempt, everyone thought Li Qiye would do the same and cross the bridge.

Alas, he simply ordered the destruction of the bridge and was successful at that. His old servant managed to crush a bridge created by Suppression Conqueror and guarded by his divine intent.

Just how strong was this old man? On the other hand, his master appeared so ordinary. The guy’s cultivation was as clear as day.

What was special about him to justify having two mighty followers?

“What…” Ye Fantian stared at the old servant; a sense of familiarity resurfaced.

Xiao Qingtian returned to the starting side and couldn’t believe it. He felt both frustrated and lost.

He glanced at the old servant but couldn’t spot anything peculiar. Such a powerful existence should be well-known. Thus, he was using a concealing art to hide his true appearance.

Who was he then? Why was he working for Li Qiye? This was the first time Xiao Qingtian truly misread something since his dao debut.

As Li Qiye climbed the new bridge, Saintess Shao Yao and Ye Fantian tagged along.

The other crowd members calmed down and also boldly followed them. As they came closer to the other side, they saw wondrous phenomena - towering divine trees and the music of the grand dao, an ocean of pills as well…

“Rumble!” Large, ancient laws were everywhere and continued to change into these visual phenomena.

When one could see through them and reach the end, they would be able to find the dao source. The dragon lord aura here exuded a tempting fragrance instead of an unbearable suppression. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

They heard the cries of true dragons. There was a constant state of dao derivation and transformation, always asking spectators to join in.

“The eighteen images.” Someone carefully counted and said.

“This is it. Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor started the path here.” One big shot nodded.

“The dao of the dragon lord, we can see its finality here.” Ye Fantian said with awe.

“Rumor has it that the two great cultivators left behind the mysteries of the path here. Solving all eighteen images will take one to the apex.” Xiao Qingtian’s eyes brimmed with excitement.

The eighteen images represented the start to finish. Reaching the final step meant becoming something unfathomable.

According to the legends, Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor still haven’t reached the end, only deriving the possibilities. Thus, they left this behind for future generations; the limitless exploration continued.

Some spectators kneeled to show respect to their predecessors. The path of the conqueror was unreachable for virtually everyone; becoming a dragon lord was actually reachable.

For the dragon lords at the scene, this was the start of their cultivation and a way for them to go even farther. They immediately became serious in order to comprehend the path before them.

A weaker cultivation was sent flying by the first image, unable to go any further.

“It isn’t that simple.” An experienced dragon lord said.

“I don’t think anyone can make it through all eighteen.” Another said softly.

“True, the only possibility I can think of in our continents is Supreme.” A friend responded.

Supreme - a title capable of stirring others - was the strongest dragon lord currently. He would be one of the best even in the immortal continent.

“It would be a shame if I don’t at least give it a shot.” Xiao Qingtian could wait no longer. His excitement only made him more attractive and charismatic.

“Are you giving it a shot too, Young Noble Li?” He asked Li Qiye.

“Go first if you wish to try or there won’t be a chance later.” Li Qiye smiled.

Listeners nearby didn’t quite understand. Was he looking down on Xiao Qingtian?

“Very well, I will overestimate myself and try.” Xiao Qingtian looked ready to go all out as he entered the first image.

“Boom!” The first one was that of a gigantic dragon attacking with its claws.

“So strong!” Sensing the might of the first image stunned cultivators.

“Activate!” Xiao Qingtian roared and summoned an azure, looking unbeatable.
