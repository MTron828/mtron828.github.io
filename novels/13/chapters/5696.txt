Chapter 5697: No Turning Back

Contrary to their expectation, an assault against Celestial Court’s armies didn’t happen.

“Activate!” Luminous gathered all of his power. His imperial flames surged and engulfed Dao Domain.

The world trembled before his might as he tried to pull Momentous Star away. He roared and channeled all of his power.

Alas, it was one with Momentous Dao and Momentous Frontier, making this a futile endeavor. In other words, he could control the star but couldn’t bring it with him.

“Again!” His primordial dao fruit became resplendent; his anima tree could be seen.

It released an ocean of might, enough to suppress all of Dao City in the absence of Celestial Court’s prison.

“Boom!” The laws emanating from his tree and dao fruit reached the limit. Alas, the star was still caught within Momentous Frontier.

It appeared that no existence or external force could ever take it away from this region.

“Wha-what is he doing?” The survivors became frightened, not only due to Luminous’ matchless aura but also his intent on taking Momentous Star away.

“Momentous Frontier is helping us, we can’t take their immortal weapon.” A big shot murmured in a daze.

“No, Luminous Conqueror is only using it to destroy Celestial Court.” An expert defended him, albeit with a tone lacking confidence.

“It’s over... everyone died for nothing...” An ancient ancestor understood the problem and lamented.

At this point, Luminous realized the impossibility of his action.

“Brother, put this matter aside.” War shouted: “Our goal is Immortal Dao City, the priority is opening the gates!”

“!!!” This stunned listeners and made them think that there was something wrong with their hearing.

“Impossible, impossible!” The majority finally read the situation correctly.

They thought that he would be using that immortal weapon against Celestial Court. Now, he had no intention of doing so and was conspiring with War Ancient God.

“No, no, he sacrificed himself for Dao City, this can’t be!” Someone shouted.

“It was only an act.” An old ancestor sighed sorrowfully and said: “They did it to trick the deities of Momentous Frontier to steal the immortal weapons. This doesn’t bode well for them...”

“How can this be...” Some refused to believe it.

“What else can it be?” The ancestor murmured: “Is Luminous striking down the enemies before him? Is West Bank Prime Emperor furious in the slightest? No, they merely sacrificed everyone else.”

“Damn it!” Another screamed.

“Everyone’s dead... Six-finger Conqueror, Five Elders, War God Dao Lord... Skysplitter, they died for nothing...” Tears streamed down a cultivator’s cheeks.

“Yes, the same for the members of West Bank.” The ancestor said slowly.

Reality suffocated the survivors and stunned their very soul. Some stared at the prime emperor only to find indifference.

“Prime Emperor!” Survivors of West Bank shouted at their last hope. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Alas, he merely glanced at them and had no intention of attacking Celestial Court. Their heart fell into the abyss. Words were needless for actions said it all.

Luminous and West Bank had conspired with Celestial Court and willingly sacrificed everyone in Dao City.

“It is the end of Dao City.” They finally felt true despair after seeing the betrayal.

The situation was dire, borderline hopeless. Nonetheless, they prayed for the duo’s survival and after all, Imperial Field was still around. Little did they know that the duo turned out to be the spark of it all.

They prayed for the duo earlier since that was all they could do. Now, these two pushed them down the abyss, crushing their faith.

“Everyone died for nothing, nothing...” The ones wailing the most were members of West Bank.

Their beloved prime emperor - the greatest in their heart - was the cause of their clan’s demise.

“You are unworthy, a true disgrace!” A disciple shouted until he vomited blood.

“Luminous, your light is nauseating! You’re not one of us!” An inhabitant of Dao City bellowed in fury.

“Save your breath.” An ancestor said: “We are mere insects in their eyes, just pawns.”

“Damn them!” A disciple from an imperial lineage cursed: “Our conquerors died for nothing.”

Luminous and West Bank only glared at them, not bothering to respond.

“Let us begin with the plan.” Luminous told War.

“Don’t worry, the dao limit path is yours, we will keep our promise.” War said.

“Start then.” West Bank glanced at his clan one last time. Alas, there was no turning back after taking this step.
