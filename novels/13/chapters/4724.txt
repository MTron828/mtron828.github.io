Chapter 4725: Paramount Goddess

The woman stopping the two monarchs looked rather ordinary and slightly overweight. She tied her dried hair up in a bun and had a wooden stick propped on her shoulder, looking just like an aunt in the neighborhood.

Her eyes were particularly bright - a stark contrast to her unimpressive appearance. The rest of her was only a mortal shell compared to her gorgeous eyes.

The crowd couldn’t believe it. How did this aunt manage to stop two monarchs at the same time? She looked like a street merchant or the boss of a noodle store, nothing more.

Of course, the disciples from Little Diamond would immediately recognize her because she was indeed the owner of the wonton shop, wanting to introduce Li Qiye to someone.

She had a haughty expression, seemingly not caring about facing two monarchs at the same time.

“Paramount.” Most big shots didn’t recognize her until they heard her title. It erupted in their mind like sudden thunder.

“She, she’s Paramount Goddess!” An ancient ancestor shouted. Everyone else became emotional regardless of their status and cultivation.

Tyrant and Skybreak didn’t dare to underestimate the enemy either.

“She was a priestess of the temple and a high ancestor of the Si from Bodhisattva.” An elderly cultivator murmured.

Those who have never met her before still have heard of her exploits. During her youth, she attacked Three Thousand Dao and fought Enveloping Monarch, the strongest of the six.

Eventually, she forced Dao Sanqian to take action as well. This became a famous battle since few had dared to attack Three Thousand Dao.

It had plenty of experts including geniuses and slumbering ancestors. Just these groups alone could sweep through the realm before taking the six monarchs into account.

Nonetheless, she was unstoppable and rampaged in their sect. Even the mighty Enveloping Monarch couldn’t kill her.

In the end, the outcome of the fight between her and Dao Sanqian remained unknown. Nonetheless, she left Three Thousand Dao without leaving any limb behind.

Some speculated that if she had lost, she wouldn’t have been able to leave. Others believed that Dao Sanqian had won but he didn’t dare to kill her lest risk antagonizing Ancestral Divine Temple.

Rumor has it that Paramount Goddess was a favorite of Her Majesty. Killing her would herald a disaster for the sect.

Today, they stared at this legendary figure in disbelief. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“You know, historical records state that she was the most beautiful in the world.” Someone whispered.

She looked more like a low-ranking servant of the most beautiful woman at this point, not anything like the renowned Paramount Goddess.

“Time spares no one, but it shouldn’t have affected her.” An ancestor who had seen her before became sentimental.

He used to be a fan of hers as well. Cultivators went crazy after catching one glimpse of her. Alas, not many were worthy.

Today, she went too far toward the other spectrum, turning into a vulgar aunt. This didn’t make sense because as long as she was willing to, her cultivation could maintain her peerless appearance.

They believed that this might have been due to a certain experience or a new perspective on the grand dao, hence her abandoning her bag of flesh and no longer maintaining it.

“Did you know that she attacked Three Thousand Dao over a man? That’s what the rumor says.” A big shot spoke to his friends.

One ancestor from the same generation said: “That’s what I’ve heard as well, a member of Three Thousand Dao, in fact, a disciple of Dao Sanqian. There is no way to verify this though.”

Listeners nearby exchanged glances. Too many theories sprung up regarding this matter since the involved parties never publicly revealed the details.

The two monarchs fully concentrated on their foe who seemed confident in beating both of them.

At the same time, some crowd members paid attention to Li Qiye and Shen Juntian, the latter being determined to not run from battle.

This decision had nothing to do with pride and foolishness. He simply wanted to prove his dao and showed the world his brilliance.

Potential fatal encounters always revealed more of the dao to geniuses. Otherwise, reaching their full potential and going beyond it remained challenging.

“Dao Prince, you’re already invincible in our heart, just leave!” Teary girls from a distance continued to persuade him since witnessing his death would traumatize them.

“Bam! Bam!” Two figures with billowing auras descended onto the battlefield.

One had an air of righteousness while the other’s regal aura could reach the firmaments. Their presence immediately froze the crowd.

“Five-sun King and the young emperor!” A spectator shouted.

“That’s three. Seems like the five conquerors will team up.” Another responded.

Their intention was as clear as can be - helping Shen Juntian. His death would be rather unfavorable now due to the common enemy - Li Qiye.

“Just in time.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Why are you here, Dao Brothers?” Juntian asked.

“We are here to lend you a hand, Brother Juntian.” Five-sun King smiled.

“I appreciate your kind intent but I do not need help.” Juntian refused.
