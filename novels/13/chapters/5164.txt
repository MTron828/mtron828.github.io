Chapter 5165: Ordinary Youth

She was not being arrogant but others always spoke to her with respect because of her background.

Nonetheless, she politely answered: “My master is Jadecure Conqueror.”

“No idea.” Li Qiye shook his head.

This frustrated her because who didn’t know her master?

Jadecure Conqueror had two dao fruits. Of course, this meant that she was far from being the strongest.

However, others had nothing but respect for her due to her peerless alchemy dao. She was capable of producing the two ultimate pills of her sect.

Thus, even characters such as Supreme needed to ask for her help in due time. From there, one could easily see her influence and fame, making Li Qiye’s ignorance unfathomable.

“My master is in charge of alchemy in Imperial Attendant City.” She elaborated.

Though he perpexedly lacked knowledge, she knew that he was stronger than her due to the green branch.

“No idea, but I am familiar with your alchemy dao.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“This is the dao of our Ancestor, known to the world as Heavenly Sage Yuan.” She said: “We are sole inheritors of this mystical dao.”

“I see.” Li Qiye smiled after hearing this because he was the one who created this art.

His smile confused her. Was he looking down on their dao? No, it didn’t quite seem that way.

“Our Ancestor saved numerous emperors and monarchs in Immemorial Epoch War using this dao.” She elaborated with pride.

Others addressed the founder of Imperial Attendant City as Heavenly Sage Yuan. The reason for the word heaven was that she had created pills for the sake of mending the heaven.

During the war, she saved countless top cultivators from The People or the casualties would have been far worse. Thus, she earned a special spot in the historical annals.

After the great war, the relationship between the two sides drastically improved. Emperors from The Race finally got the chance to ask her for help.

Alchemy was a popular art but other alchemy sects couldn't compare to Imperial Attendant City.

“It is unmatched indeed.” Li Qiye said with a strange smile again since he was praising himself.

From her side, it didn’t sound like praise. Others always changed their tone when talking about their alchemy dao but not him.

Nonetheless, she changed her focus to another important matter. She bowed deeply and said: “My name is Shao Yao, thank you for saving me, Young Noble. If I can ever be of assistance in the future, just let me know and I will try my best.”

Others would be jumping with joy to hear this from her since she was the saintess of Alchemy Dao. Her promise meant that it was possible to gain access to the two legendary types of pills.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Someone with this privilege would be highly regarded even by dragon lords and conquerors. However, Li Qiye accepted her gesture without saying anything.

This confused her more. Did he not know the significance behind her comment? If he hadn’t saved her life, she wouldn’t have made such a generous offer.

“What is this thing?” She turned her attention to the green branch caught by him.

It was strong and fast enough to catch an alchemist like her off guard. Moreover, she was a Heavenly Sovereign already.

“Come out.” Li Qiye pulled the branch up and caught the actual culprit - a blood ginseng with a red glow.

It already had a human shape and possessed immense medicinal power. Dragon roars could be heard coming from within.

It struggled and didn’t accept its fate. Two green eyes suddenly opened and could mesmerize anyone.

“Green-eyed blood ginseng!” She shouted in astonishment because she thought that it was a one-million-year-old blood ginseng at first.

This ginseng was extremely rare and ferocious. It was the hunter so alchemists knew to stay away. This was her first time seeing it; their precious garden didn’t have this type.

Now she understood why her defenses were useless. This was something far beyond her level. Perhaps her master could catch it. Anyone else was suicidal in attempting.
