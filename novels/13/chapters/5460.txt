Chapter 5461: Despair

Although spectators and the combatants were prepared mentally for something like this to happen, they still became astounded.

The four apex cultivators should have been unstoppable in the upper continents.

Supreme swapped his void thrust into one filled with emotions and compassion, targeting beyond the physical realms. Immortal Pagoda unleashed his strongest attack with the help of his primordial fruit. Swordsea’s dao was omnipresent and unblockable. Eternal had complete mastery over the temporal affinity.

The four in combination could kill All-things or Sword Queen. Alas, Li Qiye easily sent them flying; they couldn’t damage a hair of his. It seemed that he was merely swatting four mosquitoes, nothing more.

The dragon lords and emperors felt despair while watching this, let alone regular cultivators.

The latter viewed apex cultivators as the peak of this world. They could try for a lifetime and never reach this level. Only a few chosen ones had the privilege to even attempt this feat.

Now, their power and prestige only served as decorations for Li Qiye’s frightening ability. What kind of existence was he, to defy reasons and logic?

At the very least, there was a sliver of hope in catching up to Supreme. It might require an immense time but luck but not impossible.

As for Li Qiye, they didn’t even have a grasp on his true power. Even if they were at the apex, they still couldn’t catch up to him.

Nonetheless, some maintained an optimistic viewpoint. They were witnessing a being above the apex - meaning that a path was actually possible. Being a top conqueror was not the end of the road.

“Hahaha!” The wounded Swordsea laughed heartily and said: “There is no end to the dao, it can fulfill all ambitions.”

He was proud of his Oceanic Slash but was swiftly defeated by Heart Blade. He thought that he wouldn’t be able to surpass this achievement nor could anyone else.

Although Sword Queen and Supreme were incredible cultivators, they could only match him at best with regard to the sword dao.

Alas, the moment he saw Li Qiye’s Heart Blade, he knew that he had lost. He finally caught a glimpse of the endless possibilities.

His dao came from Finality, a legendary and peerless scripture. He couldn’t surpass it, hence his sadness in feeling the limitation of his dao.

Today, Heart Blade shattered his understanding of the sword dao and enlightened him. The previous duels with Supreme and Sword Queen did not have this effect since they were evenly matched.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Sir, please accept my gratitude for the lesson.” The wounded Swordsea lowered his head, unable to contain his excitement.

Spectators became sentimental while watching the aftermath of the battle. Bottlenecks existed in all cultivation realms. Apex cultivators had an even harder time breaking through. They normally needed a supreme fortune or an opportunity.

This applied to Swordsea as well. Today, seeing Li Qiye’s Heart Blade was his godsent opportunity.

“An eternity is still ephemeral in your eyes.” Eternal Conqueror sighed and said: “I was displaying my slight skills before an expert and made a fool out of myself.”

With that, he turned toward the last-gen members of Divine Alliance and said: “I have tried my best earlier, my debt is now repaid. Gentlemen, goodbye now, I hope we will be able to meet again.”

He then bowed in Li Qiye’s direction before disappearing from sight, not caring about anyone else’s opinion. Of course, no one outside of Li Qiye could stop him anyway.

He only worked for Divine Alliance to repay a debt. With that done, there was nothing keeping him here.

Divine Alliance suffered heavy losses today, losing both Swordsea and Eternal Conqueror.
