Chapter 4257: Killing Slash

“Boom!” The invincible yet carefree slash instantly cut through both comprehension strikes. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ahhh!” The sword formation and the halos weren’t spared either. Blood splashed out like a storm and rained down along with decapitated heads. It didn’t take long before rivers started to form on the ground below.

The stench of blood made everyone shudder. Who knows how many cultivators were killed from that slash just now?

They included members of Sea Emperor, Nine-wheel, and their supporters. There was no chance for them to stop the slash. This was something above the level of two comprehension strikes.

Dismembered corpses rained down. These were the lucky ones who were strong enough to have intact corpses. The weaker cultivators were reduced into blood.

“Rumble!” The sword formation and the halos crumbled. Wails of lament from the carnage echoed.

More than eighty percent of the combatants have been killed by Li Qiye’s casual slash. Using “unbeatable” was not enough since this character was a tier lower.

The gruesome scene was nauseating. Two behemoths have been decimated by Li Qiye and Finality.

Many big shots had seen massacres before. Alas, the victims were powerful ancestors and top disciples of the continent. This shocked them to the core.

“What a slaughter…” One pale youth trembled with fear.

Normally, just killing a regular disciple from these two sects could end in a disaster. The killer’s seniors would need to come and apologize. Of course, no apology would happen here.

“So that was the nine paths?” An experienced cultivator asked.

Alas, only silence answered because most were still overwhelmed emotionally.

“No, no, no!!!” Everyone saw Vastsea Venerable climbing out of a pile of corpses. His eyes nearly left the sockets; his face twisted with agony and hatred.

“This can’t be!” On the other side, the vajra also made it out of the pile. He was covered in serious injuries.

They couldn’t accept the pitiful death of their juniors. Their sects had dominated for eras. They were always the killers, not the victims. Thus, Li Qiye made them experience something new - sadness, rage, and despair.

Their back became bent as they turned old once more. Now, even the wind made them shudder.

They once could withstand the elements with their impressive cultivation. Even the coldest ice-affinity in the world couldn’t overcome them.

Alas, they have become weak after this battle. Nonetheless, no one looked down on them for losing. In fact, some sympathized and felt the same hopelessness.

“This can’t be…” The vajra appeared dazed and decrepit.

“I have given you two plenty of opportunities. Blame only your stupidity.” Li Qiye said.

Others held their breath as they stared at Li Qiye, realizing the full extent of his terrifying power. Normally, the victor against two behemoths would be celebrating but he thought nothing of it.

This meant that the massacre was utterly insignificant in his mind. Then what in the world could actually move him?

Even his fans thought that he had become unreachable. He was higher than the sky and vaster than the world despite not exerting any pressure. His very existence made others feel inferior.
