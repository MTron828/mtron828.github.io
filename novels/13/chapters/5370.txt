Chapter 5371: Unseal It

Li Xian’er has arisen from the ashes of Jue Xian’er.

Fortunes could be seized in a single second given the perfect circumstances. The stars certainly aligned for her to meet with Li Qiye who has the ability to mend her dao heart.

“I’ve merely changed your way of thinking. The path ahead depends on you alone.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“I will not let you down, Young Noble. The path might be long but I shall follow in your footsteps.” She said.

“I hope so.” He nodded and extended his hand.

She was only puzzled for a slight second before feeling something that could only be described as a telepathic connection. She knew to put Immortal Piercer in his hand afterward.

“Obtaining this was a great fortune. Do you know that it was meant to shackle sinners?” He gently patted it before speaking.

“Sinners?” She only knew that escaping it was immensely difficult: “I came across it during a moment of crisis in a broken place. It took a while before I understood enough to use it.”

At first, she had no idea how to use it but after putting in enough time and effort, she found that it was incredible in battle.

“It can shackle the enemy and the user.” Li Qiye said.

“Please elaborate.” She asked humbly.

“Shackling the enemy is not its strongest ability.” Li Qiye said.

“Then how should I use it, Young Noble?” She bowed.

“Like this.” Li Qiye replied and Immortal Piercer pierced her body.

She felt a sharp pain in her dao heart and realized that she was sealed by the weapon now.

“Young Noble?” She didn’t know what he wanted to do. Of course, if he had wanted to kill her, he would have done it back in Lesser Firmament instead of waiting until after the mending process.

He handed the other end back to her and said: “The day when you remove the seal is when you will be able to obtain anima.”

“Anima.” She murmured.

“Clank.” The chain gradually became transparent before disappearing altogether.

When she regained her wits, she saw that the chain appeared the same as before. However, she could tell that there was another coiling tightly around her dao heart.

“Which is the real one?” She asked.

“There is no real one, it is where your dao heart is.” Li Qiye said: “And if you wish so, it is also in your grasp.”

“What should I do now?” She found the weapon to be so unfamiliar now. It was her friend throughout the years but it seemed as if she knew nothing about it.

“Work on making the chain one with your dao heart, that is when your dao heart reaches perfection, enough for you to obtain anima.” Li Qiye said.

She naturally understood the significance of anima. For example, Eternal Conqueror possessed anima and a massive anima tree, hence his current power. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Is it possible to unseal it?” She never expected to be sealed by her own weapon. After all, the thought of using it on herself never crossed her mind.

“It’s dependent on how strong your dao heart becomes.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand now.” She bowed once more, realizing that this would just take time and effort.

Li Qiye started walking and she followed behind him.

“What is the end of the dao?” She suddenly asked.

“It depends on what you’re looking for.” He stopped and answered.

“What I’m looking for.” She repeated.

“Yes, and that might be what you find at the end.” He nodded: “Many have reached it and made different choices, some harder than others.”

“...” She stared at him in disbelief after hearing this.

The keyword for her was “many”. Most would think that Li Qiye was talking about Eternal Conqueror and his peers.

However, Eternal, Light-dragon, and even Purewood Divine Emperor have yet to reach the end of the dao.

She thought that maybe the man standing in front of her was such a being. Thus, who were these “many” he was referring to?

How powerful were they? Have they reached the point of being everlasting?

“What kind of beings are they?” She believed that her peak would be at anima and everlasting life was unreachable.

This was true for the strongest cultivators in this world. She hadn’t heard of anyone obtaining everlasting life before - this only existed in their dreams.
