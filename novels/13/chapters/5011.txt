Chapter 5012: Sharp Opposition

“All six…” Wild Dragon became serious.

Combining the six most likely didn’t mean much to outsiders but it was different for the demons. There was a high chance of becoming the next commanding god for Feather.

This position enjoyed the worship and power originating from demons and beasts, turning its holder into one of the strongest characters in Demon. It was the dream of all sentient demons.

At worse, obtaining the six still meant a bright future. The monarch spot was all but guaranteed. They might able to call themselves a god later on.

Thus, Wild Dragon was awfully tempted despite his current achievements. Some outsiders were also interested, especially the dragon gods. Tendril King was also a demon so she desired it more than her peers.

“Would all six allow the owner to enter the divine nest?” Jun Cuican asked a key question and attracted everyone’s attention.

“Is it really true?” Another demon expert interjected.

All eyes were on Golden Cicada King. The divine nest was a legendary area - a sacred ground for the demons.

Human cultivators might not care about the commanding god position but the divine nest was another matter. Rumor has it that there was a great fortune within.

“Well, the chance is there, it depends on whether the nest grants entry permission.” Golden Cicada answered.

“I shall be the one to enter and obtain that fortune. The next founder god is no one but me.” Wild Dragon didn’t hide his ambition.

“I thought that you have been there before?” Skystomper God asked his enemy.

Everyone wanted to know the answer to this as well because Wild Dragon was one of the rare few capable of leaving Demon. This privilege might have come from the divine nest.

“Fate binds us, that’s all I can say.” Wild Dragon kept it vague.

Nonetheless, this answer confirmed everyone’s suspicion.

“Does the great fortune have anything to do with Demon Conqueror?” Tendril King asked Golden Cicada.

“I heard something similar, the conqueror might actually be from there.” Wild Dragon laughed.

This rumor has also been around for a bit. Demon Conqueror was special; many thought that he might be the strongest demon in history. He fought against Celestial Court and Immortal City, not fearing anyone.

If he was somehow connected to the divine nest, this was proof of the nest’s incredible fortune.

“Since everyone is interested, I will tell you everything that I know. Not only are demons eligible to enter, but outsiders from both The Race and The People may as well. Of course, this depends on everyone’s luck. In the past, someone from the War Monarch had entered and left with a divine egg.”

“Yes, the War Monarch had a divine egg.” Radiant Monarch said.

“It is accurate to consider the six god sources as the key. One must have it in order to enter.” Golden Cicada said.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Where are the other four?” Radiant Monarch spoke. His eyes were brimming with holy affinity, always influencing others to kneel before him.

“As far as I know, Goldcrest Young Noble from Phoenix has one, Young Noble Li Qiye has one as well.”

“I have one.” Tendril King revealed.

“And yours shall be mine.” Wild Dragon stared at Tendril King.

Those on her side stood up right away, ready to fight. She, on the other hand, remained calm and said: “Feel free to try.”

“Hmph, do you think you can do as you please in our presence?” Jun Cuican uttered coldly, clearly on Tendril King’s side.

“Everyone here wishes to obtain all six, let’s not lie now.” Wild Dragon laughed as he gazed at the dragon lords, wishing to cast a rift between them.

“We won’t fall for your trap. Cultivators in the world should live together in harmony. As for the fortunes? No need to compete, leave it to fate.” Radiant Monarch said.

“Such bullshit, hypocrite.” Wild Dragon was one of the few who didn’t hide his disdain for the righteous faction.

“Gentlemen, let’s not get ahead of ourselves here. There are two god sources before you right now, one step at a time.” Golden Cicada said.

“Speak, what is your intent? These two sources are as good as mine.” Wild Dragon said.

“That’s too early to say.” Skystomper God responded.

“We’ll see about that.” Wild Dragon responded.

“Golden Cicada, please let us know what we have to do.” Radiant Monarch smiled. His aura radiated and soothed the heated atmosphere.
