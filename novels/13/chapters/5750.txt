Chapter 5751: A Star

Eventually, the entire cloud melted into the stream, changing its color gradually from shimmering starlight to a milky white.

This applied to even the water pouring from the source. The stream looked like a floating cloud - a total takeover had commenced.

Li Qiye smiled after seeing the cloud’s success at assimilating into the celestial river.

“Boom!” A muffled explosion could be heard from the bottom. A golden light burst forth but couldn’t be seen clearly due to the milky white liquid.

“Rumble!” More explosions came next as if stars were erupting at the bottom. Ripples formed on the surface, making it look like a white cloud floating in the galaxy was being swayed back and forth by celestial gusts.

Finally, a more powerful explosion shook the entire stream.

“Splash!” Something golden emerged from the water. Its rays resembled the hair of a sun god, dazzling and bright yet not overwhelming.

It turned out to be a star with two arcs looking like a pair of eyes and eyebrows. It seemed forged from the purest gold, releasing rays and particles accompanied by pleasant metallic clanks.

“Splash!” The white cloud also rushed out of the water.

The star seemed furious and spewed celestial water at the cloud like an angry child. The cloud evaded the current and looked rather pleased with itself. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Out already? Amazing, that’s why you’re the boss.” Li Qiye gave the cloud a thumbs-up.

The cloud loved the compliment, shifting glances between Li Qiye and the star while gloating.

The star stared at Li Qiye, realizing that he was the culprit and seemingly eager to give him a beating.

“Splash!” It sent a water stream at Li Qiye but he easily dodged it.

It kept on trying again, wanting to hit his face. Unfortunately, he had no problem dodging and smiled: “Don’t be angry now, this is our first meeting, we should become friends.”

The star glared, having no intention of befriending the uninvited guests.

The cloud appeared before the star and postured arrogantly as if to say that being its friend was an honor.

The star didn’t hold back and sprayed a golden stream of water, sending the white cloud flying before posturing proudly.

The cloud showed no sign of weakness and seemingly placed its hands on its hips, angry and not wanting to lose.

“Hey now, it’s rare for us to meet like this, you haven’t seen anyone for eras now, so why not sit down and have a good chat, get to know each other a little bit?” Li Qiye smiled.

The star glared at him. If it could speak, the sound coming out would be a snort of the highest derision.

“Don’t be like that.” Li Qiye insisted with a smile: “Look, you’re here all alone for so long without a single friend. I brought you one today, another with a similar background as you in the mortal world, you’re basically family.”

The star glanced at the cloud, having no intention of considering the cloud as family and only displaying contempt.

The cloud cast the same contemptuous glance back as if to say - who do you think you are?

Li Qiye chuckled after seeing the two and condensed his grand dao, exploring the primordial and taking out a primordial essence as sweet as honey.

He morphed time into cups and set up a feast, gesturing for the cloud and star to come: “Come, I’m the host today and we have some good stuff. Sit down, let’s eat and chat.”

The cloud’s eyes lit up and immediately floated over, unable to resist the temptation. Nonetheless, it didn’t forget to glare at him to express its dissatisfaction.

It had followed him for so long and worked hard, yet he had never prepared a feast. Now, he was doing it for the star? This was favoritism.

“Don’t think I’m playing favorite, you got enough good stuff in Immortal Dao City, have you forgotten already?” Li Qiye smiled.

That made the cloud feel much better and forget its grievances, choosing to focus on the feast instead.

“Come have a taste?” He played the role of a chef and prepared a table full of food filled with immortal essences. Imperial-level characters couldn’t enjoy such delicacies.

Alas, the star remained skeptical and cautious - aware of Li Qiye's ulterior motives.

“What’s the matter? Sacred that this is a trick to capture you?” Li Qiye asked.

The star glared at his provocation while the cloud cast mocking glances at its cowardly reaction.
