Chapter 3560: Seven-colored Draconic Loach

“Golden Cicada Buddhist Child...” The prideful students stared at him with respect.

He was the most talented monk in Heavenly Dragon, the most blessed and also the youngest - a direct disciple of the Sacred Monk of Wisdom, one of the four grandmasters.

Even the top geniuses in Duality couldn’t stop him. In reality, very few members of the young generation could match him.

In fact, some believed that he could eventually surpass his master and reach the height of Boundless Supreme. He would be able to enter Sacred Mountain and become the leader there.

Of course, these were just speculations and rumors. Nonetheless, they served as a measuring stick to the Buddhist child’s heaven-defying talents.

Heavenly Dragon Temple has been focusing on grooming him as well, most likely waiting for him to take over the role of the sacred monk.

“Young Master, it is done now. Which part do you want first?” The old man placed the roasted meat in front of Li Qiye and grinded his knives together.

The students from Duality still salivated, the same as Zhang Yu. The only difference was that he was also glaring at Li Qiye with total hatred.

“Which tastes the best?” Li Qiye glanced at it.

“The eyes.” The monk shouted before the old attendant. Everyone could hear him swallow his saliva several times.

“Our young monk here is right, the eyes are good.” The attendant pierced the knife and took it out for Li Qiye: “Please try, Young Master.”

Li Qiye accepted it and took a bite before throwing it back onto the plate. He shook his head: “Not very good.”

“I must be a bad cook.” The old man said.

“No, you did a fine job. The fire was perfect. It’s just that the meat is too rough.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“How ludicrous!” A student immediately voiced his annoyance at Li Qiye’s perceived bravado. He was still in love with that meat.

Meanwhile, the two animals were still circling and growling but they didn’t dare to eat without Li Qiye’s permission.

“Let them eat this.” Li Qiye smiled and told the attendant.

The latter immediately swung his blade and separated the chunk into two halves before throwing it to Lil’ Black and Lil’ Yellow.

The two happily barked before chewing on the meat to the envy of the crowd.

“Amitabha, black benefactor, I am here for a chance to perform a good deed, will you let me have a leg?” Golden Cicada showed no sign of reservation, unlike the students. He stretched his bowl towards Lil’ Black.

The boar immediately growled to show his ownership, not bothering to listen to the monk.

“Amitabha, yellow benefactor, I haven’t eaten in three days and three nights, let me have one piece?” The monk turned towards the dog.

“Gao! Gao! Gao!” The dog rudely shouted and put on a fierce appearance, scaring the monk back.

“Amitabha, no need to be so mean, just say no.” The monk consoled himself.

The students found this hilarious but didn’t dare to laugh. The monk’s gluttony was even more well-known than his cultivation prowess. He traveled seeking good food and didn’t shy away from meat and wine.

“Fine, don’t eat alone, let the young monk have a leg.” Li Qiye told the two animals.

The two had no choice but to agree while glaring at the monk.

“Amitabha, thank you!” The monk jubilated before running over, tearing off a leg and another piece from the dog and boar’s portion. His bowl became as filled as can be.

The two animals ran away afterward in order to stop him from taking more.

He didn’t care for appearances and sat down on the ground, taking one bite after another. His mouth was covered in oil while making loud sounds.

“It’s good, it’s good!” He praised while eating.

“This little monk... I suppose I’m not that bad of a cook. It is your fortune to be able to eat my cooking.” The old man happily said.

“You’re completely right, Sir. Amitabha.” His mouth was filled with meat so his words were unclear.

The students were starving too but to compete against two animals for meat? They couldn’t stoop down to that level. That would be awfully embarrassing.

“Young Master, do you want anything else?” The old man asked after the failure with the meat.

“Don’t we have a fish in the jar right now? Go make me some soup.” Li Qiye ordered casually.

“Yes.” The old man went to a jar in the courtyard and opened it.

Initially, the students didn’t care about a bowl of soup. However, this all changed once the old man opened the lid.

A seven-colored beam shot to the sky akin to the coming of a treasure.

“What’s that?” Everyone looked over, attracted by the emerging beam.

“Splash!” The old man grabbed a five-pound fish from the jar - the source of the brilliance. It resembled a rainbow blinding everyone. This seven-colored fish had long feelers just like the whiskers of a dragon.

“Seven-colored draconic loach! The ancestor of a gilded five-colored loach!” The monk became startled after seeing this.

“That’s what it is?!” The students’ eyes turned agape as a result.

“Really? It has to be another fish that just looks similar.” Zhang Yu refused to believe it.

This was understandable. He and several other friends tried their very best and managed to catch the gilded five-colored loach. This was extremely precious so he was proud to present it to Princess Ling as a present. That’s why there was no way Li Qiye could have one in a jar.

“Amitabha, believers of Buddhism do not lie. This is a seven-colored draconic loach, a fish rumored to have the bloodline of a true dragon.” The monk placed his palms together and salivated while looking at the fish.

The crowd was astonished while looking at this incredible treasure.

“How, how do you have this fish?” Xiao Ling couldn’t help but ask.

“This crappy fish? I found it in a stream the last time I went to gather firewood.” Li Qiye responded.

“Found it in a stream... How...” Her friend said in disbelief.

The other students felt the same way. How could this Li Qiye fella be so lucky?

“I’m here every day, is it that strange to find some food?” Li Qiye commented.

“Young Master, I’ll go gather some other ingredients to go along with this fish, it’ll be delicious.” The old man had already killed the fish while the students stood there in a daze. He plucked something resembling cabbage and put it in a pot then the fish.

“What... that’s dreamsoul sage, a supreme alchemy material.” The monk stared intensely at the pot.

People suddenly realized that there were many plants looking like it around the temple.

“That’s a legendary medicine famous for its nutritious value, right?” A student from an alchemy clan suddenly salivated while looking at the garden filled with precious materials.

“How, how do you have so many expensive herbs?” Xiao Ling had no idea what they were despite staying here last night. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Oh, they’re all over the mountain so I planted them for meals.” Li Qiye said.
