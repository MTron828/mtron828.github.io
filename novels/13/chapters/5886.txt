Chapter 5886: Used Me As Bait

Li Qiye’s departure was the reason why Trinity - no, the mysterious guest of Celestial Court - dared to appear. This also applied to Twilight Hunter.

They have thought about this question for a long time - whether Li Qiye was truly gone.

The mysterious guest believed that with enough time, he would be able to break the seal and obtain Trinity’s body. This process would revive the real Trinity but he was confident in replacing this being. Thus, he spent all of this time accumulating power.

Li Qiye never appeared again and this fortified his belief. Today was the right time - he ate the drop of true blood and connected the skull to the body, initiating the contest between the two separated beings. He didn’t expect Twilight Hunter to have such a perfect ambush during their fight, to somehow put an end to him.

As for Twilight, he had not eaten for a long time since he was a picky eater, unlike the other overlords of Trinity Epoch. Moreover, he was more cautious than anyone, never revealing himself without absolute confidence.

His guiding principle was that the first move must be the last. After observing the epoch all these years, he came to the same conclusion as everyone else - Li Qiye was gone.

Therefore, Trinity’s rebirth was irresistible, not to mention the battle between the separated beings. It gave him the perfect opportunity to suppress both. Li Qiye’s disappearance and Trinity being distracted and weakened - such a scenario could never occur again.

Most importantly, his hunger got the best of him. The feast couldn’t be refused - the perfect physique and soul.

He had a taste of this physique before and couldn’t forget it. Everything happened according to plan with two exceptions - Stonesplitter’s resistance and Li Qiye’s appearance.

Li Qiye never left this world. He told no one, not even World Emperor who was the closest to him.

“Buzz.” Twilight disappeared immediately. Space rippled around him, creating chaotic flows.

They interfered with the senses and divine intents, giving him a chance to escape. The strongest overlords couldn’t see through the flows in a short time to find his location. This was the highest level of stealth dao - no one else had anything coming remotely close.

Now, his plan was ruined so he decisively escaped. Unfortunately, he was facing Li Qiye, not Primal Ancestor or any other overlord.

The latter could only watch him escape but Li Qiye raised his hand and sealed the entire epoch. Speed and evasive techniques no longer mattered. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This is it for you.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You didn’t enter Heavenrealm?” The mysterious guest resurfaced and asked Li Qiye.

“You didn’t watch carefully enough.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “Incredible, an actual rebirth. Your physique and soul can drive people mad with jealousy in any epoch.”

“That’s why you used me as bait.” The guest said.

Li Qiye gathered everything for him - the true blood and his head. This made the revival process simple.

At first, the guest understood that he was being used by Li Qiye, hence his patience all this time. Twilight Hunter’s ambush was not unexpected, the problem was how potent it was.

However, Twilight Hunter was not the final victor - still another victim to Li Qiye’s overarching plan.
