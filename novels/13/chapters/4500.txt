Chapter 4501: Slap Again

Alchemy Child’s face twisted with anger. He has always been pampered by everyone so this was an unbearable experience.

“You, you!” He had a hard time speaking coherently at first: “I am a disciple of True Immortal, my master is True Immortal Young Lord! You are finished, you and your whole clan! My master, a future dao lord, will see to it!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The big shots frowned while listening to the enraged youth screaming like a cat with its tail stepped on. This was unbecoming from a member of True Immortal. On the other hand, they could see why the youth went crazy. Being slapped in public like this was too much to endure.

“Slap him again.” Li Qiye ordered without batting an eye.

Alchemy Child was horrified while his fellow sect members tried to stop Wise with their weapons and treasures. Unfortunately, regular disciples like them had no chance.

“Pop! Pop! Pop!” Blood spilled again as the youth got smacked repeatedly.

“You!” He lost all sense of direction while shouting, nearly becoming unconscious from the humiliation.

The auction wasn’t a dangerous area so he didn’t have any escorting experts. They thought that they would be safe just because they were members of True Immortal. Alas, this alone wasn’t enough to frighten Li Qiye.

“Just you wait!” The trembling youth uttered hatefully. He stopped asking for trouble and could only wait for revenge in the future.

He glared at Li Qiye with absolute hatred. After returning to True Immortal, he would tell his master about this. At that point, they would bring a force including ancestors to kill both Li Qiye and his clan. This was the only way for him to feel better.

A few big shots enjoyed this development. They disliked the haughty youth but didn’t want to antagonize True Immortal over a few words. Now, someone else had taught the brat a needed lesson.

They stared at Li Qiye, aware that the brat would come crying to his master and embellish the event. This would certainly start a feud.

Not even Cloudgrasp Elder of Three Thousand Dao would want to do something like this. It was unwise antagonizing True Immortal over nothing. However, Li Qiye knew all of this and still humiliated Alchemy Child. This was akin to insulting True Immortal.

It was as if Li Qiye didn’t care about the young emperor or True Immortal in the slightest. The big shots became curious.

An ancestor like Li Qiye should have enough sense to know about True Immortal’s might. How was he so confident?

Turtle-seeker Ancestor thought that he would never do something so risky. How could this ancient ancestor be so bold?

“Ahem.” A worker from Grotto Courtyard came into the hall and coughed: “Gentlemen, the auction shall soon commence, please enter the private room.”

“Creak…” A portal in the form of a gate opened with guards standing in front. This was for the sake of verifying the guests’ eligibility and keeping the location a secret.

“Let’s go.” Turtle-seeker told the group. His disciples got up to follow him.

Turtle-seeker whispered to his friend: “I’m using my clan’s reputation to enter. What about you, Brother Wu?”

Wise stared at Li Qiye because they didn’t receive an invitation. This secret auction had incredible treasures, meaning that the requirement was also unreasonable. Ancestors alone weren’t prestigious enough.

“Gentlemen, please take out your invitation letter or proof of qualification.” A disciple from the grotto asked Li Qiye once they got close.

“Don’t have any.” Li Qiye chuckled.

The guards exchanged glances and frowned. One of them said: “I’m afraid this is a private auction requiring an invitation.”

The ones standing behind stared at Li Qiye. Was he trying to make a fool out of himself? Coming without an invitation?

“I don’t need one.” Li Qiye chuckled.

His attitude frustrated the guards. Did the guy want to force his way in?

“This is not the place to be unreasonable.” A guard warned him.

“Hmph, kick this unqualified wretch out!” Alchemy Child saw the chance and loudly shouted: “Who knows what he is planning, coming here without an invitation. He must be trying to steal the treasures!”

“Please leave.” The guard’s tone became serious.

“How impudent!” Jian Ming glared at him and said: “The young noble is the greatest in history. Open your dog eyes and tell your Seal Ancestor to come greet him. Otherwise, we’ll flip this place over.”
