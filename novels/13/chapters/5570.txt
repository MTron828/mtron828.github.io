Chapter 5571: Satisfied?

Turmoil Talisman was the conqueror’s main treasure. His grand dao gestated it so the smash carried the power of his dao fruits.

Alas, it didn’t leave a single crack on Niu Fen’s shell. This astounded the hidden emperors and monarchs. This old man might be even stronger than expected.

“Brat, have a taste of my shell!” Niu Fen’s shell started whirling and flying into the air.

Everything turned dark as if the sky vault was falling. The whirling shell crushed the yin-yang cycle in an unstoppable manner.

The maelstroms were obliterated while the majority of the crowd was forced to the ground. This was raw power with no technique involved.

“Boom!” Turmoil Conqueror staggered backward and spat a mouthful of blood.

“We’re just getting started!” Niu Fen rushed forward after destroying the maelstroms.

The high heaven seemed to be descending by the shell, leaving Turmoil panicking.

He shouted and activated his five dao fruits and their auras. Dao laws protected him with a seal capable of separating oceans and realms.

Alas, the shell contained Niu Fen’s apex power - something beyond what Turmoil could currently muster.

“Boom!” The seal and laws were utterly crushed.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Turmoil’s attempt at creating a defensive separation couldn’t stop the supreme shell. It smashed him into the ground, creating a huge pit and grievous injuries. Lacerations and cracks appeared all over his body.

His physical prowess seemed as fragile as a cracked porcelain vase. Just a slight touch might cause everything to crumble.

This astounded the big shots who were still immobilized by Niu Fen’s sheer aura. As for the hidden emperors and conquerors, they thought that the old man might have an immortal shell and anima.

This battle was too one-sided. Someone with just twelve dao fruits might not have been capable of delivering this swift victory.

Qin Baifeng became slack-jawed as well. She knew that Niu Fen was strong but this still took her by surprise.

Turmoil tried to get out of the pit but Niu Fen was already waiting. He got into a mounted position like a hoodlum and unleashed a flurry of punches at Turmoil’s face.

The latter was helpless since he was fully suppressed, unable to block the punches. This had no semblance of a battle between masters, only a street fight between two hoodlums. An air of dignity and respect was noticeably absent.

It was one thing for Niu Fen to kill the guy. Alas, the audience felt the force behind each punch and wondered about the pain.

Niu Fen eventually became bored and got up. As for Turmoil - his face was smashed beyond recognition with blood gushing out of open wounds. It looked like a pig head due to how swollen it was.

Turmoil wasn’t moving, whether it be due to the injuries or his current mental state. Perhaps it was best for him to play dead right now instead of having to face reality.

After all, conquerors cared about their reputation and prestige. To be beaten down like this meant losing everything.

No one dared to comment since they feared the mysterious old man.

“He reaches the truth?” A hidden conqueror murmured to herself.

Everyone made a list of potential candidates for the old man’s identity. Which dao lord had matching descriptions?

“I’m sure you will learn to not prance around before my young master. You are nothing, the same for your clan. Learn from this or the young master will exterminate you all.” Niu Fen got up and patted his hands clean.

He returned to Li Qiye’s side and smiled: “Am I right, Young Master?”

“Satisfied?” Li Qiye smiled back.

“I learned from the best.” Niu Fen laughed.

The scene fell silent. Niu Fen looked like an errand boy but why would such a powerful cultivator play this role?

“He has to be at the anima level, a true master.” A monarch contemplated the issue.

An anima-level dao lord was virtually unstoppable even in the immortal continent. Why would he be someone else’s servant? Thus, this ordinary youth must have a frightening identity.
