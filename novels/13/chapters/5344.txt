Chapter 5345: I Walk My Own Path

The two behemoths from Heaven and Divine Alliance arrived on the scene, causing everyone else to tremble in fear.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Supreme, a dragon that had surged through the azure, showed everyone that dragon lords weren’t inferior to the imperial path. His very existence served as a spiritual totem for the dragon lords.

After all, they were often overwhelmed by dao lords and conquerors. Most felt despair at this reality. Supreme changed all of this - still becoming a leader among the top cultivators.

Strangely enough, Swordsea Dao Lord didn’t seem to be on Supreme’s side.

Previously, Divine Alliance wasn’t as aggressive as Heaven Alliance. This trended higher under the rule of Principle Conqueror and Divine became closer to Dao and Imperial Alliance.

However, it was still a branch of The Race. After Principle Conqueror’s abdication, it started becoming friendlier with Heaven Alliance.

Supreme came to deal with Hallowed Dao Lord. Thus, Swordsea Dao Lord should be supporting him right now.

“What is your wise opinion on this, Dao Brother?” Supreme asked; his charisma has yet to diminish with time.

“No wise opinion but I have a strong fate connection to Brother Hallowed. I will be the first to not allow any aggression toward him.” Swordsea got to the point.

Since he was the current leader of Divine Alliance, he spoke with confidence while guaranteeing Hallowed’s safety.

Most wouldn’t know of this connection he was referring to, only those with knowledge of their Finality Sword Dao.

“Swordsea, don’t forget your current position.” Xu Kong said menacingly.

“You need not worry about that because I don’t. I, Swordsea, walk on my own path.” Swordsea answered with a smile, undeterred by external pressure.

Others thought that his reputation of being untethered and free was true. He was helping Hallowed who had a strong relationship with All-things Dao Lord.

This was definitely going against Divine Alliance’s own interest, resulting in dissatisfaction from its high-ranking members. Swordsea didn’t seem to mind at all.

“Dao Brother, I also am a believer of cause and effect. Henceforth, my feud with Fellow Daoist Hallowed is erased.” Supreme said decisively, no longer pursuing this matter.

Although this was a slap to the face, the changes in circumstances made him change his plan.

“Supreme, you don’t need to be merciful.” Hallowed laughed and said: “If you don’t kill me today, I will kill you in the future. Your decision today affects nothing.”

“Your persistence is worthy of admiration.” Supreme said: “I’ll be waiting for our next fight to the death.”

“Good, a fight to the death next time.” Hallowed agreed.

“How lively, am I too late?” Suddenly, a voice brimming with strength sounded.

Ripples appeared in space and an old woodcutter appeared. His facial features were clearly defined as if they have been carved from a rock. The light in his eyes shined with an eternal purpose.

Li Qiye had seen by chance before back in Immortal’s Peak.

“Illumination.” Supreme, Hallowed, and Swordsea frowned ever so slightly after seeing him.

Another apex cultivator had joined the fun - the founder of Dao Alliance and the progenitor of Azure School.

This mortal who came from a humble family managed to become a real threat to The Race. As his dao progressed, so did his kill count of those from The Race.

Because of his insistence on fighting Heaven Alliance during his prime, he became a hero for The People. Some dao lords and conquerors chose to follow him in order to fight against their mortal enemies.

This culminated in the creation of Dao Alliance - a way for The People to defend themselves. Unfortunately, Illumination started becoming more extreme, going as far as persecuting those who didn’t support him.

Internal strife started within The People and even dragged The Race in with it. This was the start of the conflict known as Emperor War. The casualties were high enough for people to call it a second Immemorial Epoch War.
