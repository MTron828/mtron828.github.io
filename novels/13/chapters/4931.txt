Chapter 4932: Immortal’s Demise

In fact, just the name alone showed that it was a great artifact. Everyone stared at the princess with both envy and jealousy.

“I got something!” Ming Shi ran back to the group and excitedly told them.

“Congratulations, Your Highness. Your future potential is limitless after obtaining this great fortune.” Goldcrest was happy for her as well.

“It has nothing to do with me, this is a gift for the academy.” She smiled happily.

“Your kindness put us to shame.” Yunyun said.

Though she didn’t know its current power, it was obviously capable of turning her into a supreme existence in the future. Alas, she didn’t want to keep it for herself. How many would be able to make the same choice?

“Hehe, Young Noble, you are really the best, how did you do it?” She asked, attributing her success to Li Qiye.

After all, she brought him here with this goal and he told her when to go. He was clearly the deciding factor, not her luck.

On the other hand, the others didn’t think that it had anything to do with Li Qiye.

“Congratulations, Your Highness, you shall be a phoenix among us.” Radiant Young Monarch came closer and cupped his fist at the princess with a smile.

“None of your business.” She scoffed at him.

He felt uncomfortable. As a dragon lord, his status was superior to hers. He had come to attempt to persuade her to join his side, recognizing her potential as a powerful cultivator. However, she did not show him any respect, leaving him in an embarrassing situation.

“Plus, I haven’t forgotten what you tried to do earlier.” Ming Shi was a straightforward person who didn’t hold back.

“Your Highness, it was only a misunderstanding. We were merely carrying out our duty to capture the thief.” Halo Scion said before glancing at Li Qiye.

In reality, the students from Deity had already harbored suspicions about Li Qiye, and this incident only served to reinforce their doubts.

Though he seemed unremarkable and incapable, he had arrived in Abroad with an obscure background, unlike the other students who were being investigated and had some form of explanation for their presence.

Of course, they were unable to take any action against him at present, due to the academy's ruling. Nevertheless, they were not willing to abandon their pursuit so easily.

"Please, our esteemed young noble would not deign to concern himself with your lineage's treasure." Ming Shi said.

"Little girl, you are correct. Why would I waste my time with something as insignificant as the trash of Deity?" Li Qiye smiled, though his words were meant to be insulting.

"How dare you?!" Those from Deity were incensed by the insult to their heritage. They took great pride in their background and would not tolerate such a brazen slight.

In fact, those from The People also found Li Qiye to be awfully arrogant and unreasonable. Though they disliked the other side, they still thought that it was too much.

“Does he not know that he’s offending all of Deity?” One of them said.

“I just hope he doesn’t drag us down with him if a fight breaks out. Everyone should know to not be involved with someone like him.” Another student added.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Halo and the others were displeased since they were the leaders of Deity in Abroad. They had to do something now.

Radiant Young Monarch activated his aura and froze everyone. As a dragon lord, there was an insurmountable gap between him and the other students.

The crowd immediately retreated after seeing this.

“What do you think you’re doing?” Yunyun, Ming Shi, and Goldcrest stood in front of Li Qiye, also activating their auras.

Chaos true energy and vitality erupted, making it hard for weaker cultivators to breathe. Alas, the trio still couldn’t beat the young monarch.

“I must punish this foul-mouthed fool.” The latter uttered coldly.

“Your indignation stems from ignorance. All of Deity’s treasures can’t compare to what’s in that sack alone.” Li Qiye casually responded.

Listeners thought about it. The pawnshop was famous but it seemed inconceivable that it would have more treasures than all of Deity.

Meanwhile, the old man sat there, seemingly not paying attention to this fiery development.

“Ignorant junior, Deity looms above all. Our resources are beyond your imagination.” Swordgrasp said.

“Then why are all of you panicking over some lost treasures?” Li Qiye smiled.

“He got a point.” Neutral students talked among themselves.

They heard that ancient ancestors from Deity have arrived over one lost treasure. On the other hand, the pawnshop had given out enough treasures to help cultivators become supreme.

Thus, if Deity was actually that rich, would it be panicking and mobilizing their forces?

“The deer pawnshop really has that many treasures?” Students turned and stared at the sack again.

Some started agreeing with Li Qiye’s viewpoint after thinking it through.

“Hmph, so what? The sack’s treasures have nothing to do with you.” Halo said: “This doesn’t change the fact that our peerless treasure was stolen by someone, which is what we’re focusing on here.”
