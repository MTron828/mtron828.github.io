Chapter 4369: I Want It

Ravaged Land was the center of the city. Alas, due to its broken and unstable nature, it was impossible to build on top of it.

“Descending is possible but it depends on luck and ability.” Goldbird Monarch honestly answered. He stared at the abyss and added: “No one really knows what is below. Coming down is possible but one might not be able to get to the bottom. There are unknown dangers too.”

The disciples of the three branches have explored this area across the eras. Nonetheless, only a few could actually descend.

Top geniuses and ancient ancestors couldn’t reach the bottom due to the sheer length. They went exceedingly far and still only see fog beneath.

Of course, some recklessly jumped down and threw cautions to the wind. The majority of this group either died or went missing.

“A mysterious place like this definitely has a treasury waiting.” A youth from Little Diamond fantasized.

The monarch told the truth: “I’m not sure about a treasury, but there are definitely fortunes in Ravaged Land. However, it requires coming down and returning alive. Otherwise, we can only watch and sigh.”

“So has anyone done it before?” Weiqiao asked.

“It has been a long time but the last person to benefit from it was Nine-tailed Ancestor.” The monarch paused for a bit before nodding.

“Nine-tailed God!” Everyone has heard of this title before, even the smaller sects because they were under the jurisdiction of Dragon and Tiger’s Roar.

This was a being rivaling Three Truths Dao Lord, a true behemoth of Dragon and the strongest ancestor in Dragon right now but no one knew if the demon god was still alive.

“Your progenitor took something from there.” Li Qiye casually remarked. [1]

“!” The monarch was shocked as he blurted: “Ho-how do you know?!”

“I sensed it.” Li Qiye elaborated: “He tore space apart and entered. He took something out only to leave it in the city.”

The monarch stood there, seemingly struck by lightning. This was a top secret written down on an ancient scroll only privy to a few. How could this outsider know about it?

“Do you know where it is?” Li Qiye asked.

“The progenitor had sealed it in Dragon Platform.” The monarch hesitated but eventually answered.

For some reason, he found himself unable to conceal anything before Li Qiye’s gaze. Lying was useless. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Elder Hu and the youths didn’t dare to interject since the atmosphere suddenly became serious again. They knew that this item must be awfully important since it came from Space Dragon Emperor and he found it necessary to seal it.

“I want it.” Li Qiye demanded again.

“No way!” The monarch didn’t hesitate this time.

Space Dragon Emperor was the progenitor of their sect. Anything left behind by him was an heirloom to be worshipped by future generations. Even the big shots from their sect couldn’t take it, let alone an outsider.

“Once again, I’m not negotiating.” Li Qiye said.

The monarch had no words to describe his current emotion. Perhaps only anger fitted this situation due to the unreasonable demand.

“Young Noble, this isn’t a joke. We can negotiate the matter of the roost but this ancestral heirloom pertains to our honor. We will fight to the very last man before handing it over.” The monarch took it very seriously and told the truth.

Those from Little Diamond didn’t dare to breathe loudly. They agreed that Li Qiye was being unreasonable right now, demanding someone else’s heirloom in their own territory.

“When that happens, is Dragon not doomed? What’s the point of trying so hard over an heirloom?” Li Qiye chuckled and went on: “That heirloom would be mine afterward anyway, so why not hand it over in the first place? Why must you implicate the lives of your sect members and walk the path of destruction? If Space Dragon Emperor is still alive, he might just stomp all of you unfilial children to death.”

“Well…” The monarch had a hard time answering. The logic was sound. If the outcome was the same either way, why not hand over the heirloom first to protect Dragon?

“That depends on if you have the ability to do so, Young Noble. Dragon is not weak, we have millions of disciples…” He composed himself and retorted.

He didn’t think that Li Qiye alone could take down one of the strongest lineages in Southern Desolace. It was nothing more than daydreaming. In fact, he should be thanking them if they were to show mercy.

“I’m aware but even if you have billions of disciples, I can still easily annihilate you. The only reason why I’m not doing so is sentimental.”

Others would have burst out in laughter after hearing Li Qiye. However, the monarch didn’t say anything because he thought that the guy was actually being candid.

1. They were talking about Nine-tailed God but progenitor is Space Dragon Emperor ?
