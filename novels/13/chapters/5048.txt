Chapter 5049: Traitors

The succession process of Demon had nothing to do with external lineages. The other branches didn’t and couldn’t interfere either.

In one way, Peacock Monarch’s choice was questionable. Chillglare Hawk was a clear choice but Nightwalker and Lunar Rabbit left it alone.

Bloodfly God’s complaint was met with a smile from Peacock Monarch because it was meaningless.

Now, Guardian Pagoda - an outsider - wanted to interfere as well.

“To go against the wish of heaven is to incite disasters to the rest of the world.” Skystomper God joined in.

These ancient ancestors weren’t newly-debuted cultivators. What was their plan for interfering?

The point was that the commanding gods right now were certainly stronger than their team, not to mention the numerous demon monarchs and colossal beasts. A swarm would come, ending with them being meals in the beasts’ stomachs.

“Guests, I apologize for the lack of reception. Please stand aside for now and we’ll take care of you later.” Peacock Monarch said with a smile, being polite yet decisive.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“This dao belongs to the rest of the world, not your own, not your branch’s, and not just Demon’s. The way of Demon is incorrect, a violation of the heavenly path.” Guardian Pagoda elaborated.

This comment infuriated the demons near the tree. This was an insult to their heritage and legacy.

They revealed their white fangs and waited for a command, ready to lunge forward and tear these outsiders to pieces.

“Demon and the Ten Great Mountains have been isolated from the rest of the world for too long. It is time for Demon to return to society and be enlightened. This should be the responsibility of the commanding gods.” Radiant Monarch spoke.

“You think you have the ability to enlighten us?” Nightwalker became serious.

Although Radiant Monarch was a renowned genius with limitless potential, Nightwalker wasn’t afraid of him in the slightest. The former wielded the power of Mist and could beat the current monarch down without any issue.

“Our guests have a point.” Bloodfly joined the conversation: “The Ten Great Mountains have been stagnating for eras now, living on a whim while murdering each other lawlessly. The six deity branches should unite and be the harbinger of order.”

Listeners became startled since it was one thing for the outsiders to open their mouth. However, there was a rift between the commanding gods now.

“Does Bloodfly God want to unify the six branches?” Ming Shi quietly said.

“Seems so, but he doesn’t have the ability.” Goldcrest said, believing Bloodfly alone couldn’t overwhelm the other commanding gods.

“He got reinforcement right there.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

By this point, even a fool could see Bloodfly’s ambition who believed that this was an opportunity to unite Demon. Of course, he knew that he needed help from outsiders to do so.

“I do not agree with this treasonous conduct and will have no part in it.” Golden Cicada King who used to be Bloodfly God’s biggest supporter let out a sigh and left the scene.

This surprised the crowd as well because he was a brother to Bloodfly God and the strongest demon monarch of Bug.

“Hahaha, I see now. Bloodfly, how ambitious of you, but do you think you got what it takes to take over?” Peacock Monarch laughed.

“You are on the verge of death, be smart now and hand the throne over, perhaps your end will be better.” Bloodfly said chillingly, completely tearing apart any sense of camaraderie while revealing his fangs.

“Bloodfly, your ego will not be permitted.” Nightwalker activated his power in the form of a divine sword hovering above.

“This matter should be discussed thoroughly.” Radiant Monarch shouted and sent an ocean of light toward Nightwalker.

“Indeed.” Skystomper joined in and also released his halo, suppressing all the other demons.

His two junior brothers joined the fray and attempted to stop Nightwalker.

“Enough of this.” Lunar Rabbit’s expression turned cold and a chilling wave engulfed the region. The towering trees became encapsulated in a layer of ice instantly.

“Boom!” Guardian Pagoda used his famed treasure to stop the rabbit with the help of the three giants.

They formed a square formation to stop the commanding god.

“Hmph.” The latter snorted and increased the chilling effect.
