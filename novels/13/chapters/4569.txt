Chapter 4570: Six-dao Immortal Monarch

The sky above the bridge was a victim of the multi-pronged assault. The ground around the bridge also caved downward.

The apocalyptic phenomena nearby shattered people’s courage.

“Fuck!” Experts screamed and shouted while turning pale.

The pressure from all of these top masters was unbearable, akin to a million mountains piling on top of their shoulders and crushing their soul.

Could Everlasting Monarch stop the offense? They thought that his corpse might actually fall. This would be sacrilegious, descendants desecrating their ancestor’s remains for the sake of the scented pouch.

On the other hand, the ancient ancestors didn’t think that this could come close to destroying Everlasting Monarch, a dao lord’s equal. They knew that the current trio of True Immortal wasn’t on the same level as their foe.

“Clank!” Everlasting Monarch finally retaliated and unsheathed his radiant sword. The incoming slash was that of the temporal affinity, wielding the might of three thousand generations.

Everything in this region became infinitely slow. The most magical merit laws and invincible weapons couldn’t compete with this stagnation. One slash to live forever; one slash to destroy.

“Pluff!” Heads were tossed into the air.

The elders and ancestors behind couldn’t stop the slash. They could only stare at their decapitated body with blood gushing out from the neck.

Decapitation Godmonarch’s saber couldn’t stop it either. It cut through his saber first and then dismembered him. The two halves fell to the ground.

The descending seven seals were in the form of seven gods. They got decapitated along with their master. The true god’s eyes were wide open as his head flew in the air.

Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor used the heaven and earth as his shields, controlling both time and space. Unfortunately, the slash still made it through this ultimate shield.

However, since it had killed many experts and broke through many defenses, it was significantly weakened.

Nonetheless, Heavenseal still became aghast once it got close enough to his chest. This would still be a fatal blow. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Break!” During this crucial moment, a commanding voice erupted like an endless wave of thunder. The one word alone could defeat an army by crushing their morale and battle spirit.

“Boom!” A fist came crashing down, eradicating everything in its path. Dao laws poured down like waterfalls and engulfed the sky.

It also contained the ancient six dao. Inside them were an immortal light and a reincarnation cycle. Living beings were ephemeral, no different from specks of dust.

“Six-dao Immortal Monarch!” Ancestors knew who the elusive cultivator was right away.

The punch managed to stop Everlasting Monarch’s slash from thrusting through Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor.

Heavenseal was drenched in cold sweat and immediately ran away, not giving a damn about his reputation.

“Clank!” Everlasting Monarch’s sword flushed brightly again. Its power only increased versus the first slash.

It cut through the power of the six dao and their cycle, horrifying all spectators. Six-dao Immortal Monarch was clearly weaker despite being the first disciple of All-things Dao Lord.

“Now!” A halberd pierced through the realms in this split second. Not even the toughest metal in the world could stop it.

“Skybreak Monarch!” The crowd bellowed, aware of the next combatant.

“Boom!” The world turned dark once the two moves collided. The horrified crowd couldn’t move at all. Fear had immobilized them.

They saw blood raining down from the sky but didn’t know who was the injured party.

“Run!” They only heard someone say run and all of a sudden, auras disappeared from the battlefield.

It all happened so fast so they needed a moment to digest the flow of information. It seemed that Six-dao Immortal Monarch and Skybreak Monarch have ran away. One of them was grievously injured by the second slash.

This was a shocking yet expected result. Six-dao and Skybreak didn’t come close to stopping Everlasting Monarch.

Everyone believed that only a dao lord might be able to fight evenly with Everlasting Monarch. No one else had a sliver of hope.
