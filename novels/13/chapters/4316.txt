Chapter 4317: Antagonizing

The members of Little Diamond were naturally annoyed since those behind them got yellow rooms.

Elder Hu remained relatively calm but the young ones were too hotheaded.

“What is going on?!” One of them shouted: “Why are those after us getting yellow rooms but not us?!”

The administrative disciple had a cold expression and ignored the comment.

“So unreasonable!” Another from Little Diamond shouted: “You are purposely mistreating us, something unbecoming of Myriad Sect Mountain!”

Meanwhile, members of the smaller sects shook their head or simply wanted to watch. None was willing to help Little Diamond.

After all, nothing good would come from helping them while the risk was substantial. Provoking this administrative disciple was one thing, but risking antagonizing Dragon and Lion’s Roar? That would end in a disaster.

It was apparent that this administrative disciple was in the wrong. Alas, they kept their mouth shut.

“Trying to cause trouble here? Are you tired of living?” The administrative disciple had enough and glared at them.

Elder Hu was emotional as well, albeit he took a different route. He spoke calmly in response: “Brother, this is not our mistake. We are on the list for this year’s conference and we have participated for generations now. We came today with respect while not committing any mistake. We are clearly qualified to stay in the yellow rooms in accordance with the rules yet you insist on sending us to the grass rooms. Is this your idea or someone else’s? I hope you will remain impartial since the ward represents the great powers. I’m sure they can tell right from wrong. Therefore, if you want to put us in the grass rooms, we deserve a reasonable explanation.”

He elaborated with logic and a tone neither servile nor overbearing.

“Well said.” The listeners were impressed despite their hesitance to get involved.

“Right, they need to give him an explanation for doing this.” Someone nodded.

The administrative disciple’s expression became ugly. He naturally couldn’t reveal the one behind this. Being called out by this nobody was also humiliating.

Though he was just an external disciple, the sect masters coming to this ward still showed him respect.

“Haha, Elder Hu, be careful with your words.” Eight Tiger responded instead: “The ward represents Dragon and Lion’s Roar. Your critical remarks won’t end well for your sect.”

His threat poured salt on the wound and reminded the audience to not pick the wrong side. There was a non-zero possibility of a disaster happening.

“What’s going on here?” An older cultivator came over. He looked to be a leader-level character in the ward.

The crowd members hurriedly cupped their fist towards him since he was higher-ranked than the administrative disciples.

This leader should be well-known even in the larger sects, hence their need to be respectful.

“Those from Little Diamond won’t go to their grass rooms.” The disciple avoided the important detail.

The leader glanced at the group and spoke with a firm tone: “We get a high number of visitors every year. Please excuse us for any inadequacy. If you have been assigned to a grass room, please empathize with the difficult logistics and go to the grass room.”

Despite his polite wordings, he immediately confirmed Little Diamond’s grass rooms.

Elder Hu’s expression soured; even the young ones understood that this person was not on their side.

Those in the audience realized that Little Diamond had offended a big shot, hence their current treatment.

“Is it over for Little Diamond?” One of them whispered.

His sect master quietly responded: “Little Diamond has an unbelievably rich history, that would be a shame.”

If Little Diamond had offended an expert from either Dragon or Lion’s Roar, they were in grave danger.

“Senior, our sect is qualified to stay in the yellow rooms, why assign grass rooms to us when there are still yellow rooms available.” Elder Hu retorted.

“Stay where you are assigned, enough asking.” The leader said.

“Such arrogance over nothing in this crappy place.” Li Qiye who has been spectating finally shook his head.

“What did you say? Explain yourself.” The leader’s expression soured.

“I didn’t make myself clear enough? Forget it, I forgive you since this is just a trivial matter. Prepare the heaven rooms for us.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

This astounded all listeners, causing them to open their mouth wide in disbelief. Heaven rooms were meant for big shots. Back during its golden age, they were the place for dao lords to stay. Now, only elders from the big sects were eligible, hence the ridiculousness of Li Qiye’s statement.

“You want a heaven room?” The leader regained his wits and narrowed his eyes.

“Arrange it.” Li Qiye ordered.

At this point, even Elder Hu wanted to cover Li Qiye’s mouth. The sect master was acting as if he was a big shot from Lion’s Roar or Dragon.

“Are you insane? Who do you think you are?” A crowd member blurted.

“Who is he anyway?” Another sect master asked: “Does he want Little Diamond to be destroyed? Think before you speak.”

“Just an ignorant fool.” One more joined in: “He must have a death wish.”

“Hahaha!” The leader couldn’t believe it. This guy was treating him like a servant: “You want a heaven room, right?”

“What are you waiting for?” Li Qiye responded.

“Look in the mirror first, you fool…” His eyes gleamed with murderous intent. This horrified the spectators, especially Elder Hu. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

A disciple from a large sect could actually destroy Little Diamond alone.

“Arrange heaven rooms for Young Noble Li’s group.” A pleasant voice interjected.
