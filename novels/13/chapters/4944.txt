Chapter 4945: Maddened God

The appearance of Stone Lion God made others more nervous compared to Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord.

He didn’t originate from Immortal Pagoda and was a fierce demon. He could actually devour the crowd since the need to appear righteous didn’t hold him back.

“The origin of Bevevolence no longer matters.” Stone Lion God uttered coldly: “It was found in Immortal Pagoda’s territory and all treasures, hidden or not, are ours.”

In Chaos, this wasn’t an unreasonable comment. Though Benevolence belonged to humans, this was a matter of the past. Both the emperor and Immemorial Palace were no longer around.

Since the land where it was found belonged to Immortal Pagoda, in a sense, it also belonged to Immortal Pagoda.

Stone Lion God didn’t care for logic and reason either. Though he wasn’t listed as one of the Ten Monsters, his personality resembled this group.

“I agree with the lion god.” A distant voice could be heard before the arrival of a frightening tornado.

The source was a radiant old man. Alas, he appeared rather sickly like a bed-stricken old man. He had a pair of wings but unfortunately, the particles were falling down as if they were being subjected to a corrosive force.

Nonetheless, when he spread its wings, they still affected the world. High intensity meant a joyous cycle while a dark pulse meant destruction.

His shining eyes made students feel as if they were being burned. Resistance was impossible. The only thing they could do was listen to their wails of agony.

“Oblivion Monarch!” Even Stone Lion God was surprised to see him.

“I thought he was dead…” A student from Deity couldn’t believe it. Those from Deity were more familiar with this title than others.

He came from the Oblivion Clan and served as the leader during his prime. Though he wasn’t unbeatable, having four sacred fruits was enough to deal with most threats.

In distant years, this clan had numerous geniuses and powerful cultivators. Of course, declination was inevitable.

After their ancient ancestors passed away, it became a third-rate sect in Deity. Today, one of its powerful ancestors was still alive and caught everyone by surprise.

“This is the world of the young now. At least someone still remembers my name.” He said.

The students of the academy became pessimistic. Now, the other side had several powerful dragon lords. On the other hand, the academy only had Yue Shanjian, Bloodsea Blade, and the schoolmaster. The difference was obvious.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Schoolmaster, please sympathize with our goal. We will apologize another day. I don’t think there is a need for you to involve the academy over this junior.” Oblivion said, stating his intention of helping Deity.

“Yes, Schoolmaster, it would be a grave crime to cause damage to the academy over this issue.” Stone Lion God added.

They didn’t immediately attack and tried to give the schoolmaster the earned respect. If it was any other great power, they would have initiated their assault already.

“Gentlemen, you don’t get to dictate the academy’s course, leave now.” The schoolmaster refused.

Students realized that the academy was ready to protect Bai Shaojin even though he was just an ordinary student.

The ancestors on the other side didn’t actually want to fight. After all, the academy might still have hidden masters around.

“So much rubbish, this is a waste of time.” Another cultivator joined the scene.

“Bam!” This was a fiery giant exuding unbearable heat.

However, upon closer inspection, the gigantic flames were coming from a short man. They were dangerous and capable of incinerating cultivators without any issue.

Some students wanted to run but they were immobilized by his aura.

“Maddened God!” They bellowed in horror.

Even Bloodsea Blade frowned after seeing him - the third ranker of the Ten Monsters.
