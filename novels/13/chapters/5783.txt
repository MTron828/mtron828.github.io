Chapter 5784: Three Thousand World Mech

The world couldn’t possibly find a larger machine than the one standing before Demon’s group.

It was seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps and parts. Using the word “born” instead of “assemble” was fitting in this scenario.

Witnessing it for the first time left people in awe - their world couldn’t create something of this scale. If that’s the case, how was it here? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Spectators suddenly saw illusions - three thousand worlds connecting for ages. All of their essences and life forces served to gestate this machine. As it grew larger, worlds withered and died. When it came out of gestation, all three thousand worlds have been consumed.

Grand avatars of emperors were described to have their heads touching the heaven and their feet stomping the earth. These forms looked like insects compared to the machine.

It had long hair tied up in bundles, looking like celestial rivers flowing downward and perhaps acting as mediums capable of penetrating and absorbing the power of the world and its inhabitants.

Demon and the others took a deep breath while looking up at the colossal entity capable of stomping their primordial tree.

It appeared cold and chilling like a piece of metal devoid of life. However, it inexplicably gave the impression that it was born from worlds - a bizarre contrast.

“Three Thousand World Mech.” Demon murmured.

Light-dragon and Heaven Burial’s group celebrated its coming.

“Fellow Daoist, your knowledge is incredible, to know the machine that has never appeared before.” Light-dragon praised.

Demon had a solemn expression as she said: “Epoch’s End.”

“Yes.” Light-dragon nodded with a serious expression.

This so-called mech was left behind, not created by Celestial Court. It came from an ancient epoch full of machines, entirely different from the current world.

The lords of this epoch were beings known as mechs, rumored to be living beings instead of mere machines. Some disagreed and believed that they were weapons crafted by an unbelievable method.

Crafting currently required metal and flames. However, Machine Epoch relied on a secret art of gestation. For example - the current mech gestated by three thousand worlds.

It was a grand-completion paragon artifact, far more powerful than any treasure seen thus far. This was the real deal, not a prototype or an incomplete version. The latter should be called overlord artifacts instead of paragon artifacts.

“From the ashes of worlds.” Heaven Burial said emotionally.

As high-status members of Celestial Court, they were aware of this hidden machine in their home.

However, witnessing it in person left them in awe. The maturing process of the machine required devouring numerous worlds and their inhabitants, hence its name. Its origin was bloody and cruel - a stark contrast to its magnificent appearance.

Later on, this advanced epoch still met its end. The smartest and wisest members were reduced to ashes - not a single member survived. All became food for a particularly dreadful epoch lord.

Most had never heard of his rather apt title before - Epoch’s End. He had devoured a total of six epochs including his own. Machine Epoch was one of them.

Why was this so-called mech here right now? Both sides had the same question looming in their mind.
