The impressive Tang Hexiang rode the wave, brimming with vigorous vitality - seemingly capable of stopping an entire army by himself.

This powerful warrior was also an expert at military strategies. Because of this, the powers of Nine Secrets and numerous other legions camping around the system had high hopes for him.

There was no doubt that Eight Formation True Emperor was stronger than Tang Hexiang. However, the former focused on dao cultivation while Tang Hexiang had other good points.

He grew up in the royal clan so he was exposed to strategies and business operations. Later on, he joined the military and had great success leading the Imperial Guards, going as far as receiving praises from Lucidity King on several occasions.

His experience and history earned him the support from War Saint Dynasty and the six legions.

Many powers in Nine Secrets felt the same way. With someone like him as the king, he could do a great job governing the system, taking care of conflicts between his tributaries.

This wasn’t the case for Eight Formation True Emperor. After becoming the king, he would definitely show great promise and potential for the future. In fact, he could become a second Lucidity with the help of the Bingchi and Myriad Formation.

However, total tyranny would return to the system. Every other sect would be under their control.

In order to prevent this, people found Tang Hexiang to be the best candidate.

Of course, the ones that could actually affect the direction of Nine Secrets were War Saint Dynasty and the five behemoths. The other clans and sects could only increase Hexiang’s influence by a bit, unable to make him the king.

“General Tang’s backing still can’t compare to Eight Formation True Emperor’s.” Another person said: “I don’t think it’ll be easy for him at all, the emperor is a tough rival but even Waterwatch Saber Saint is not inferior to him at all.”

“True, but we don’t know for sure yet.” An ancestor replied: “I have heard that the Sacred Cabinet is coming back out to help him.”

“The Sacred Cabinet...” People were startled to hear this name.

This organization used to be the central power of War Saint Dynasty before Lucidity King, consisting of their strongest ancestors.

It was in charge of both the dynasty and the system, and this limited the influence of the king.

Later on, Lucidity King changed everything during his prime. He forced the cabinet into disappearing. Some said that he had personally destroyed them while others believed that the two sides have reached an agreement and the cabinet voluntarily retired. Either way, this ended up with a total dictatorship for Lucidity in Nine Secrets.

Thus, hearing about their second coming was obviously surprising. Perhaps this could change the tides in the current power struggle.

“Alright, if Tang Hexiang can get Fairy Qin’s approval, it’ll confirm his position and maybe Eight Formation True Emperor will be smart enough to back off.” An ancestor said with a profound expression.

Everyone was immersed in watching Hexiang. Everyone knew that Yang Bofan has successfully met Qin Jianyao, meaning that she thought highly of Eight Formation True Emperor.

If Jianyao were to ignore Tang Hexian right now, it would be a detrimental blow to his cause.

Of course, gaining her support would be incredible. With the help of Calm Lotus and his own advantages, Eight Formation True Emperor would need to think twice before going up against him.

“Please excuse my uninvited visit and grant me an audience, Fairy Qin.” Hexiang stood on the other side, his voice echoed across the lake.

The atmosphere became frozen since everyone held their breath, waiting for the answer.

“You’re too polite, General Tang.” Jianyao’s pleasant and enjoyable voice resounded.

She personally came out again to show the world her wondrous beauty and astonish the youths nearby.

“I have many things to ask you, Fairy Qin. Please guide me.” Hexiang courteously said.

“Guide is too strong of a word. We can have a chat instead.” Jianyao nodded. Her ethereal appearance made the heart beat faster.

Everyone glanced at each other after seeing this. It looked like those who could win an audience were eligible to become an emperor. Someone like Ma Jinming was not.

“Looks like it’s down to Eight Formation True Emperor or Tang Hexiang then.” A cultivator said.

“Maybe, maybe not, Waterwatch Saber Saint has yet to show up. Remember, he’s even more brilliant than Eight Formation True Emperor.” Someone from the last generation shook their head.

Qin Jianyao has caused quite a stir because of these meetings. Everyone knew that to a certain extent, her sect could decide the next candidate for the throne so all eyes were on her.

“Your Majesty, General Tang and Eight Formation True Emperor’s disciple have visited Fairy Qin. I’m afraid this isn’t good news for you.” Chuqing has heard talks about the meetings and told Li Qiye. Despite her innocence, she was keen enough to know the negative implications for Li Qiye.

Because of this, she became worried while he was completely nonchalant.

“Let them be.” Li Qiye shook his head: “What are they going to do? Just struggling meaninglessly, thinking they’re smart and capable enough to control the world. Unfortunately, it’s only wishful thinking since they’re mere chess pieces.”

Chuqing refrained from replying. She was only worried about his well-being. As for the throne? That meant nothing to her. Being around Li Qiye was more than enough to keep her happy and satisfied. He could just be a regular citizen and she would still stay by his side.

“Silly girl, don’t be distracted by this nonsense. Any progress on the mantra I’ve taught you?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“It is awfully magical.” Chuqing said: “I just feel a lack of experience and accumulation, an intangible feeling like it’s there yet not.”

“It’s good that you’re sensing something.” Li Qiye smiled: “Alright, while there is still time, I’ll take you out since we just can’t stay in the house all day.”

“Where?” She was surprised.

“Around Nine-linked Mountains, of course, since we’re already here. We can’t waste our trip.” Li Qiye replied. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Chuqing nodded without objecting since she was willing to go wherever he went.

The two of them went down the mountain and headed northward. It looked like a sightseeing tour. This path would take them across the nine lakes.

The lake closest to Great Desolate Mountain was their first destination. It was around a thousand miles long. When traveling via a boat, one would think that they were in a great ocean.

Li Qiye stared at the lake and played with the water. After a while, he looked at her and asked: “How are you feeling?”

“Very good, the air is pure and refreshing.” Chuqing felt as if they were the only ones on the lake right now so she smiled brightly.

“Silly girl, you think this is a stroll? I’m taking you places so you can feel this land.” Li Qiye gently pinched her cute nose and said.
