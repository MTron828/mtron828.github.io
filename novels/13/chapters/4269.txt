Chapter 4270: Sword Cauldron

Sword Cauldron and Sword World were the two last domains of this burial ground, also the hardest to enter.

Those capable of entering the cauldron were all top masters in history, capable of sweeping through Eight Desolaces. As for Sword World? The visitors were equal to dao lords. Alas, just leaving that place alive was rather difficult.

The cauldron was true to its name, resembling a massive cauldron capable of refining anything. The heat here was beyond measurement by any existing scale.

Treasures of the sovereign level or other artifacts could be melted in the blink of an eye. It also nullified defensive merit laws.

Thus, the heat stopped others from intruding since they would be reduced to ashes. Only Supreme Sovereigns and up were capable of surviving in this harsh condition.

As for Li Qiye, he grasped heaven and earth with his palm, contained the myriad laws in his heart, and restrained karmic ties and the yin yang with his mind. The various methods prevented the heat from injuring him.

The endless lava here was discomforting due to its boundless nature. It seemed to be the source of the unbearable heat.

Upon closer inspection, they would find that it contained more than just lava. Perhaps it had molten metal or the liquefied form of various artifacts…

Only Li Qiye could have such an easy time dealing with it. He walked on top of the boiling lava and stirred the entities below.

“Raa!” On one end, a giant covered in lava stood up and opened its mouth, spewing out a golden liquid. One would think that it had melted immortal metal before.

“Boom!” The lava surged crazily and a black hole appeared to suck in the golden liquid.

The monster roared continuously and turned the black hole into a terrible tornado, capable of incredible destruction. There seemed to be other hidden entities as well, hiding in the lava.

This cataclysmic battle was frightening. However, everything was limited to the cauldron so outsiders had no idea what was going on.

Remember, the lava here didn’t allow for any lifeform. However, these monsters were still capable of surviving in it. This showed just how powerful they were.

Some corpses also showed up, managing to withstand the test of time and the high heat. One of them was a skeleton with its ribs penetrated by a terrible spine. Nonetheless, it remained standing proudly.

Its divinity was no longer there, only a faint golden glow. This person must have been immensely strong when they were alive. The rough conditions destroyed the flesh so only the bones were left.

In a different spot was a skull as big as an island. It had eight eye sockets and three mouths, clearly a mighty monster.

The lava also burned down its divinity but it still had miasma floating around it. It mixed with the lava, resulting in an ink-like liquid. One could imagine a colossal creature with a corrosive miasma capable of instantly killing its opponents. Alas, it still died in Sword Cauldron.

Some rare treasures remained. For example, the blade of a sword with no hilt. It wasn’t damaged, merely uncompleted.

Despite its imperfect form, it still had a golden aura and visual phenomena around it. Once completed, this divine sword could slay gods and devils.

“Buzz.” There was a ghost banner swimming in the lava. Wails of lament could be heard coming from it. The banner itself endured the heat but whatever inside was being tormented.

It possessed a devouring nature, capable of feeding on three thousand worlds and their inhabitants. If this thing found its way out of the grave, it would cause a terrible calamity.

All in all, the monsters and weapons capable of surviving were supreme, the finest of an era. Those lucky enough to obtain and control one would become unbeatable. Of course, more often than not, these things were too powerful and would devour the adventurers instead. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Li Qiye seemed quite amused at the diverse things living in the lava. He only glanced and didn’t bother taking them. They were definitely top-level treasures but this wasn’t his goal in coming here.

The lava beneath him suddenly split apart, revealing a gigantic monster. It had six blood eyes; the rays from them could mesmerize any cultivator. It clearly viewed Li Qiye as a delicious meal.

He stared at it with a smile before speaking: “Mmm, interesting, I haven’t skinned your type yet. You would make a decent robe."

The red rays intensified but still did nothing to Li Qiye.

“Splash!” The lava walls caved downward again and the monster went into hiding. It realized how strong Li Qiye was and immediately fled.
