Chapter 5711: Fired

“Boom!” The pulsing rings separated all affinities from the giant and filled up the world.

Creaking noises could be heard from the spatial fabrics that were being stretched to the limit.

“Fire!” Demon gave the order and the great tree erupted with a primordial glow resembling a bowstring.

It pulled back for a thousand miles before releasing the ultimate arrow.

“Whoosh!” Time reversed along its trajectory - one thousand, ten thousand, one hundred thousand years...

It killed everything in existence, whether it be living beings or the various laws and affinities of heaven and earth. Due to the reversed time flow, it could slaughter anything from the past as well.

Spectators lost control of their body and fell to the ground, not only in Imperial Field but the entire immortal continent. They sensed the murderous potential of the arrow and were scared out of their mind, seeing the illusion of them being pinned to the ground.

Space and time no longer mattered. The target could be in a distant dimension or the past and the arrow would still hit.

Due to temporal distortion, spectators could see the arrow piercing through the divine rings regardless of their supreme sealing capability.

The impregnable defense fell but the giant immediately clapped the arrow before it reached the chest; its hands being empowered with enough energy vectors to keep up with the arrow’s speed.

The curve made by the empowered hands could traverse any point in time in an instant, making it possible to block in both the present and the past.

Thus, the hands seemed to have been waiting for the arrow millions of years in the past, preparing for the block.

“Bam!” The giant firmly gripped the silver arrow and an incredibly long time seemed to pass before the actual sound - eons had gone by and gave a sense of vicissitudes, blue seas replacing mulberry fields.

“Crack!” The impact left cracks on the giant’s chest that spread to the rest of its body. Alas, the arrow failed to penetrate fully.

The giant looked like a cracked porcelain vase - just a slight touch would make the entire thing crumble.

“Rumble!” Loud explosions shook the continent but it didn’t end yet.

Demon and her allies channeled their power into the primordial tree, forming a pulsing beam to push the silver arrow.

On the opposing side, countless vectors surged from the engines to power the giant’s hands, strengthening its grip.

The tremendous forces from both sides entangled and caused powerful vibrations resonating across the continent, culminating in catastrophic earthquakes. It appeared to be a stalemate, neither could seize victory in a short time.

Meanwhile, the formation of Imperial Field still released constant rains of arrows against Celestial Court’s armies - a one-sided massacre.

Just as they were overwhelmed by the offensive power of the islands, a horn sound blasted from deeper in Imperial Field.

This horn was white like bone, looking like bone spikes from hell with a slight semblance to an antler. Bones of an unknown entity have been refined into this shape, perhaps the spine of a giant.

It created a symphony of death, opening the infernal gates of hell. Vile fiends and undead would crawl up from the depths and infest the mortal realm. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Moreover, it released a gloomy aura that didn’t illuminate anything. Instead, it could summon the dead from the ground or twist the living into lifeless beings.

The wailing sounds grew louder and the aura intensified, cascading downward and changing the world into the land of death to everyone’s horror.
