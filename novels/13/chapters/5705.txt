Chapter 5706: Junior, How Long Can You Last?

“We have no problem fucking you up without them!” A deafening shout answered.

A dao lord stood on top of an island, resembling an impregnable fortress standing before the might of Celestial Court.

He was none other than Calamity whose shell could stop everything.

“That’s a bold claim.” Space cracked due to an immensely heavy force and out came a godfiend.

This cultivator was massive; tall enough to touch the stars. His flame was different from other imperial flames.

It looked like an endless void, capable of engulfing a galaxy and refining it down to nothingness. He was the lord of this prison with absolute control over the prisoners’ fate.

“Immortal Emperor Fu Mo!” Recognizing him was easy due to his unique appearance.

He came from Brilliance, an ancient kingdom with two Immortal Emperors - Yao Guang and himself.

Yao Guang, the founder, was a brilliant emperor. Fu Mo, on the other hand, paled in comparison.

This changed completely in the present day. Although Yao Guang was relatively strong, he still had a long way to go before reaching the apex level. His descendant, Fu Mo, somehow surpassed him while being on the six continents.

They also picked different sides. Yao Guang chose The People while Fu Mo joined The Race, serving as one of its strongest combatants.

An emperor stood at the pinnacle in the eyes of regular cultivators. This was especially true for the nine worlds and Eight Desolaces. However, this was only the beginning.

Thus, it wasn’t rare for brilliant ancestors to be surpassed by their descendants later on. Yao Guang was one example, another being War God Dao Lord. Being a genius didn’t mean that they would enjoy the same dominance in the future.

Fu Mo’s ancient aura intimidated weaker opponents but not Calamity who sneered in response: “Old geezer, you might stand at the apex but you have no spine compared to your ancestor, Yao Guang.”

“Junior, we walk on different paths, that is all.” Fu Mo felt no shame in aligning himself with Celestial Court.

“Different paths my ass.” Calamity said: “Celestial Court will be destroyed soon enough. You idiots are courting death and should know better since you’re from the nine worlds.”

“Hmph, what can the likes of you do?” Fu Mo snorted in response.

“I can’t stand the sight of you, old geezer, take this!” Niu Fen’s radiance surged as he held his shell like a weapon. A metallic resonation could be heard as countless solutions of the dao activated.

The island nearly sank as he stomped down\, ready to leap up into the air.

“Boom!” He crushed space along the way. His shockwaves birthed a colossal tsunami.

“Bring it!” Fu Mo roared and summoned a staff spanning a thousand miles, the size of a mountain range.

He intercepted the charge by raising the staff horizontally. Sparks sprayed out and descended like falling stars.

“My turn!” He shifted from defense to offense with a swing, capable of destroying numerous islands.

Niu Fen raised his shell to block the strike.

“Rumble!” The shell stopped the relentless flurry but the ocean beneath became turbulent.

Weaker cultivators trembled in horror after witnessing their first exchange.

“Old geezer, half of your body is in the grave already, probably can’t even get it up anymore.” Niu Fen lacked the demeanor of a dao lord, preferring to spew venomous insults instead.

In terms of age, Fu Mo was considerably older. Niu Fen came from the nine worlds but didn’t make his mark until Eight Desolaces.

Fu Mo couldn’t help feeling irritated since no men wanted to admit that they weren’t up to the task.

“We’ll see how long your shell can last, Junior!” Fu Mo roared and smashed Niu Fen’s shell repeatedly.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!” The ruthless strikes from the colossal staff robbed the world of its colors. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, Niu Fen’s dao fruits empowered his shell - not a crack could be seen despite the onslaught.

“Go!” Fu Mo imbued true flames into the staff and summoned his true fate, activating the power of anima.

“Break!” The next smash became strong enough to break the fabric of reality, reducing everything to chaos and leaving spectators in awe due to the sheer destruction.
