Chapter 4359: A’jiao

“The dead still have thoughts.” Li Qiye stared at the horizon and said.

The group shuddered after hearing this because this was a rather strange idea.

“They still have thoughts?” One of them murmured and immediately looked around. He felt chilly gusts and became afraid, thinking that ominous spirits were looking at him.

In their mind, the dead seized to have a soul and mind. Some no longer had a body as well. Thus, Li Qiye’s comment went against conventional wisdom.

Of course, there were special entities in the cultivation world. For example, stubborn intents and obsessions that wouldn’t disperse. Some strange events could happen after the death of a powerful cultivator as well.

However, strictly speaking, ghosts didn’t exist similarly to immortals in their world. So was that old beggar a ghost then?

“Ghosts can’t appear in broad daylight.” One youth blurted out without being too sure.

“Right, they’ll disperse once exposed to sunlight.” His friend quietly said.

“Maybe he was something ominous.” An older disciple speculated.

A few of them heard this and thought that they may have caught misfortune, especially the one who gave him coins earlier. He wiped his clothes and said: “Please, no misfortune, I didn’t do anything, don’t latch onto me.”

“It’s a great fortune to be sought after by a ghost.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Why is that? Aren’t ghosts ominous creatures? If one latches onto him, he’ll be unlucky forever.” Another answered.

“It’s not that easy becoming a ghost.” Li Qiye replied: “Being one meant the person had obtained a heaven-defying fortune. Such a being wouldn’t care about you all since you’re nothing more than insects in their eyes.”

The youths exchanged glances and agreed. Ghosts wouldn’t bother coming to look for them. After all, they had nothing noteworthy – no power, no resource, no talent…

“That’s good.” One guy heaved a sigh of relief and said: “I guess it’s not all bad being nobodies.”

“Sect Master, why is he looking for you?” One youth became curious. It became apparent that the old beggar wasn’t here to beg and only came for Li Qiye.

Li Qiye smiled and moved forward without responding. The group followed him but they didn’t get far again.

Another uninvited passerby came along – a woman shaking her hips more than necessary as she walked towards them.

If she was a supreme beauty, then such a walking style would be quite a sight for sore eyes. Unfortunately, she was overweight.

Strangely enough, her fat wasn’t shaking either. She seemed to be very well-built and had a tanned complexion. One would assume that she worked all year long at a farm.

In reality, she was only eighteen or nineteen but her appearance betrayed her age. Her hair was long and black. Alas, they were tied into pigtails in a non-flattering fashion. Worst of all, she was covered in a thick layer of makeup carrying a heavy scent.

It wasn’t a crime to be average-looking if she didn’t adorn any makeup and had a simpler style. Alas, she also wore a conspicuous flower dress. This combination was absolutely a visual attack.

She appeared to be a village girl who yearns for city life, hence her style.

“Oh, Husband, I’ve finally found you…” She put on a feminine yet nauseating pose as she rushed over to Li Qiye. [1]

Her unreasonable confidence and coquettishness shook the young ones but most importantly, she addressed Li Qiye as “husband”.

They calmed down and their gaze switched back and forth between Li Qiye and her.

“Don’t make me obliterate your soul. No one will be able to save you.” Li Qiye threatened.

This was not an empty threat when it came from Li Qiye since he had the ability to do so. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Can’t I make a joke?” The girl acted shy while stealing glances at Li Qiye: “My father agreed to our matter.”

She was none other than A’jiao who had also shown up at Sword Continent. The timing was identical as well; the beggar came first then her.

The disciples found this rather strange yet amusing. Some thought that their sect master might really have something to do with this girl.

Thus, they were tactful enough to slow down their pace, giving Li Qiye and A’jiao some space.

“Does the sect master really have a fiancee?” One of them whispered.

A different disciple disagreed right away: “It doesn’t look that way to me. Plus, who is actually worthy of marrying our sect master?”

“Watch your words.” Elder Hu scolded, not wanting them to speculate.

Nonetheless, he found this strange as well. First, it was a beggar; now an overweight girl. This felt rather strange.

Li Qiye ignored the gossip behind him and only focused on A’jiao. He smiled and said: “I see, what’ll be the dowry?”

“I’m sure the dowry will be generous, just say the words.” A’jiao said bashfully, causing the disciples to have goosebumps.

“I want his dog life then.” Li Qiye smirked.

Listeners became slack-jawed. Their sect master wanted to kill his father-in-law?

“Why so cruel, our father bears no malice towards you.” A’jiao pouted, seemingly ignorant of the effect she has on others.

“Alright, why are you here?” He asked.

“What else but to strengthen our romance since we’re about to be husband and wife?” She looked down at the ground and only stole glances at him.

1. Exact translation is husband but used more like “honey” ?
