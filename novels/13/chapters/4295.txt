Chapter 4296: Threat

Du Weiwu’s expression soured, not expecting this sect master to be so bold and impolite towards him.

“Ah, I have no other intention outside of congratulating you, Sect Master. Well, I also heard some news.” He coughed and still wore a smile.

“What?” Li Qiye said lazily.

His attitude annoyed Du Weiwu. In the past two days, Little Diamond has been treating him like an esteemed guest so this was a departure from the norm.

“I heard your previous sect master died a violent death recently.” Du Weiwu acted like an expert and said: “Coincidentally enough, a battle broke out at the old ruins that day over the emergence of some treasures. I wonder if he had participated?” The implication was as clear as possible.

The previous sect master had indeed participated in that event, albeit under disguise. Everyone else was preoccupied with the treasures and due to the chaos, no one recognized him.

“And?” Li Qiye smiled.

“A very important and precious item went missing among them.” Du Weiwu smiled mysteriously.

“Our sect is insignificant like an insect. We weren’t qualified to participate in a treasure hunt like the heroes of the world.” The first elder hurriedly interjected.

This involved several behemoths in Southern Desolaces. It was dangerous for Little Diamond to join the muddled water. No, “dangerous” wasn’t the right word. This could become an existential crisis.

They didn’t want anyone to figure out the connection between their sect and the ancient immortal physique scroll. Otherwise, destruction would be imminent.

“Elder, you might say that but who knows? The top sects will not allow anyone to steal their feast in front of them. That’s a challenge to their authority.” Du Weiwu smiled implicatively.

The elder’s expression changed after hearing this. He took a deep breath and said: “True, but we have always been neutral. We know our place in the world.”

“Well, you have to prove it. They have sent out investigators regarding this matter. If there’s a sect that’s actually audacious enough to do this, the top sects would have to destroy them to prove a point.” Weiwu added.

The elders secretly exchanged glances, aware of the consequence.

“Right, I wonder which impudent sect dared to do this.” The first elder calmed down and said.

Du Weiwu pressed on: “But your sect master passed away so suddenly, I think people will question this. Perhaps your sect master went to the ruins…”

“Young Master Du, you misunderstood. Our sect master was ambushed by an enemy and passed away from injuries.” The first elder interrupted while shaking his head.

“How regrettable, the end of a true hero.” Weiwu put on a sad expression and said: “I trust you, First Elder, but others might not, especially the ones from the big sects. They will do everything to figure this out, including coming to your sect for a full investigation. I wonder if you’re prepared for it…”

The elders tried their best to stay calm but their expressions betrayed them. If outsiders came, they would immediately be exposed. There would be no escaping then since the immortal scroll was located in their treasury.

“An upright man has no slanted shadow.” The elder said strongly. They must deny this at all costs.

“Your righteousness is commendable.” Du Weiwu said: “It’s just that once they come, it won’t be that easy getting them to leave. A single misstep might result in unimaginable consequences.” Duwei revealed a smile that wasn’t a smile.

The first elder couldn’t refute the logic in this. Once those experts came, there might be other complications even if they couldn’t find the scroll. Powerful cultivators were temperamental and violent.

As the saying goes - summoning a god is easy, getting one to leave is the hard part.

“It’s not like there’s no way around it.” Du Weiwu coughed and said: “Our clan has been close to your sect for so long so I am willing to help out. My uncle, Deer Monarch, is from Dragon Sect. I just need to say his title and no one will dare to trouble your sect, don’t you think, Elder?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Weiwu was right about this. His uncle had enough influence to stop others from investigating Little Diamond even if they were suspicious.

“You came prepared, Young Master Du.” The first elder uttered coldly.

“Don’t be so harsh, Elder, I’m just here to help out. However, getting my uncle involved requires some form of payment, no? There is no free lunch in this world.” Weiwu chuckled.

“Hmph.” The first elder scowled; his peers were unhappy as well.

Weiwu wanted to extort them; who knows if the top sects were actually sending investigators.

However, if the latter wasn’t true, it could become true in the future. Without sufficient bribes, Weiwu might divulge this information to everyone else.

“Okay, are you done farting now?” Li Qiye finally jumped in.

Weiwu’s annoyance grew after hearing the deliberate insult.

“Sect Master, remember, I’m here to help out.” He cupped his fist.

“Since I’m in a good mood, I will allow you to run.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You!” Weiwu turned red with rage.

The elders exchanged glances. They didn’t want to escalate the issue so quickly due to the grave consequences.

“Sect Master, you are blind to kind intentions. If you insist on ignoring advice, you’ll have to be ready for the consequences.” Weiwu said coldly.

“What consequences?” Li Qiye decided to play along.

“Heavy losses at best, sect destruction at worst. Little Diamond will be no more.” Weiwu said.

“Are you threatening us?” The first elder jumped in.

“No, but it sounds like your sect has a guilty conscience, that’s why you’re trying to chase me away.” Weiwu’s expression darkened: “Thus, in order to get through this, you must pay an expensive price, either enough refined jades or let me pick a manual.” He no longer hid his true intention.

The elders glared intensely at him. Though they were weak, they couldn’t bear being treated like fish on the chopping board.

“Looks like you don’t wish to leave this place in one piece.” Li Qiye said: “I was going to spare you but now, looks like I must make you leave an arm behind.”

“As if you dare.” Weiwu didn't buy it: “My first uncle is the sect master of Eight Demons, my uncle-in-law is a member of Dragon. Touch a hair of mine and this land will be reduced to scorched earth.”

“Keep on speaking and it’ll be your head instead of your arm.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively.
