The multitude felt indignation due to the overbearing treatment from Firmaments and Skylight. Alas, the disparity in power left them speechless. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The princess came over and cupped her fist while slightly bowing: “Gentlemen, I will need your assistance to make it through this perilous domain. The formations required a large area so please understand. Come visit Skylight in the future and we’ll make it up to you.”

Her attitude was fitting and sincere, enough to appease the angry mass.

“It’s fine, it’s fine, Your Highness. We’ll just back off.” One of them returned the gesture and said excitedly.

Most would never have the chance to speak to a character of her level in their life. Moreover, she could become the queen in the future.

Plus, they weren’t here for the imperial treasury anyway, so doing her a favor was just fine. This might be an opportunity for them to climb up the branch of Skylight or even Yin Yang Gate.

She easily won them over since they thought that she was reasonable and amiable. No one else was better suited to be queen.

Of course, the big shots were still annoyed but offending these sects was a dumb decision. They would have no place to stay in the north in the future.

Only a group of three ignored this and continued walking towards Fire Domain.

“Leave if you don’t have any business here.” Disciples from Firmaments immediately stopped them.

“Why?” The one leading asked.

“Hmph, you again.” Firmaments Godchild recognized the three and uttered coldly. The first prince took note of this too.

“That’s Li Qiye, adored by Dragon-phoenix Maiden, right?” One person murmured.

Li Qiye paid no attention to them. His eyes were focused on the torch deeper into Fire Domain.

Being ignored by him irritated them. He has been treating them with nothing but contempt, at least in their opinion.

Now, they had great armies here and the ultimate alliance. This guy still dared to act haughty in front of them?

“Our three sects are conducting official business, scram to the side if you’re not involved!” The godchild raised his voice, unable to restrain his anger.

He wanted to erupt several times during the previous meeting. Alas, the maiden’s presence deterred him from doing so.

She wasn’t here now so there was no need for him to hold back against Li Qiye. He was already nice and calm enough by not immediately smashing the guy into a pulp.

“Wow, what an amazing alliance.” Qing Shi snorted and answered in Li Qiye’s stead: “Since when does Fire Domain belong to you and not Ancestral City?”

The annoyed big shots earlier became interested as happy spectators. They didn’t want to mess with Yin Yang but wouldn’t mind others causing trouble.

Of course, the ones who had a good impression of Skylight Princess felt that Li Qiye’s group was picking the wrong time and not appreciating her goodwill. Thus, though they were chased away just now, they still picked her side.

There was another group - the young experts who had a crush on the maiden. They naturally viewed Li Qiye as a thorn so his death would be perfect here.

“Don’t try to stir the pot and switch white to black.” The first prince’s expression darkened as he answered: “I will allow you to leave now, otherwise...”

“Otherwise, what?” Li Qiye finally stopped looking at the domain and lazily said.

“You’re Li Qiye?” Wu Zhongtian joined the fray before the prince could answer. He stared at Li Qiye as if the guy was an insect.

“Yes.” Li Qiye smiled and nodded, giving back the same looks of disdain.

“You killed my brother and disciple, a crime worthy of death.” Wu Zhongtian’s eyes became as sharp as blades. A terrible aura emanated from him.

“No idea who you’re talking about.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“The audacity!” The spectators, especially those close to Yin Yang, immediately spoke out: “You dare to speak to Young Noble Wu in this manner?”

“So many dogs are barking today.” Li Qiye waved his hand, interrupting the criticism and making them turn red.

“Young Master, he’s talking about that Wu Prince and Feathersword guy.” Qing Shi smiled and reminded Li Qiye.

“Oh, those two idiots, looks like their seniors aren’t much better. I see where they got it from now.” Li Qiye suddenly recalled and laughed.

“Haha...” Those who didn’t dare to go against Yin Yang chuckled after hearing this. They secretly gave him a thumbs-up.

“Ignorant fool, you deserve to be hacked to pieces!” The experts standing next to Wu Zhongtian glared at him.

“You’re courting death. Let’s see what you can do to back up such arrogance. Who will come and save you today?” Zhongtian’s eyes flashed murderously.

“Clank!” A sword intent engulfed the area even though he didn’t have a sword on him. He must kill Li Qiye for his numerous transgressions. No, after a long torture. He wanted to hear Li Qiye’s screams echo across the land.

“Brother Wu, no need to use a butcher’s blade to kill a chicken. Let us deal with him.” The initially-scholarly first prince stepped up, also ready to kill.

He wanted to kill Li Qiye long ago but did a good job hiding it. The guy made him lose face in front of the maiden - simply unforgivable.
