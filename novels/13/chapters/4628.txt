Chapter 4629: Golden Gate’s Decision

“K-kidnap her?” Jian Ming hasn’t thought about this before despite being a villain in the past.

“Don’t pretend to be a nice guy, you’ve done plenty of stealing and swindling before.” The daoist said.

“But in this case…” Jian Ming still hesitated.

In reality, honest and moralistic cultivators were rare in this dog-eat-dog world. Nonetheless, Jian Ming had qualms about doing it to Ye Tingrong.

“Do you have a better idea?” Li Qiye asked.

“Well…” Jian Ming knew that the odds were against him since so many great powers were involved.

“Do you want to wait until she loves you before doing something? Her kids would be learning how to walk by then.” Li Qiye joked.

Given the precarious situation, Golden Gate had no chance of delaying this. The only question was who they would pick. Therefore, this was absolutely the last chance.

“You need to win first before caring about feelings. If she has to marry someone anyway, why not you? She has no say in this matter either way.” Li Qiye continued.

Jian Ming took a deep breath after hearing this.

“Unfortunately, her feelings aren’t taken into account here.” Paramount Scion reminded. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Ming obviously understood this. It’s just that he was an involved party and couldn’t see things objectively. Moreover, he cared too much about her feelings.

“The others such as True Immortal Spirit won’t treat a tool like her well. The only way for you to help her is to marry and protect her, giving her all the love possible.” Li Qiye said.

“Just listen to the young noble.” The daoist said: “Win her first then talk about love later.”

“All of this is predicated on a successful engagement. Otherwise, your feelings will forever be one-sided.” Li Qiye concluded.

As the conversation went on, Jian Ming gradually recognized his feelings for Ye Tingrong. Moreover, he also realized the only possible path. He clenched his fists and made up his mind.

“Will Golden Gate pick me even if we propose?” He asked sincerely.

“It is not up to them once I say the words. No one else can interfere.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Hear that?” The daoist became excited: “What the hell are you waiting for? It’s just a matter of time before you marry and have kids. Don’t worry, I’ll be there for your wedding regardless of the date. You will need to show your appreciation for your matchmakers then.”

Jian Ming glared exasperatingly since this daoist was claiming contribution already.

However, before they could go propose, Ye Tingrong came on the same night with new information.

“My grandfather has decided.” She said.

“Already? What’s the result?” Jian Ming became anxious since he has yet to propose officially.

“Which sect, True Immortal?” Paramount Scion asked. Among the candidates, True Immortal Spirit was certainly the top dog.

“No.” She shook her head and said: “Grandfather chose to have a martial tournament.”

“I see, a tournament to decide the groom.” Jian Ming murmured.

He exchanged glances with the daoist. The latter said: “Brat, don’t think about it. You won’t be able to last until the very end. Plus, we don’t know who’ll show up later.”

“The victor will gain more than just the marriage. Mmm, not a bad plan from that Mad Fist.” Li Qiye smiled.

The great powers would certainly go all out for the sake of winning.

“When one disciple loses, another can try instead. There is still a chance for everyone but the advantages remain for the behemoths.” Paramount Scion said.

Initially, all the great powers only selected one candidate for the marriage proposal. Now, for this tournament, they could have many more. For example, if True Immortal Spirit were to lose, this sect could send out the other geniuses. Maybe even True Immortal Young Emperor could show up.

This was the better plan for Golden Gate since it didn’t have to offend anyone. The losers could only blame themselves and this would buy more time for Golden Gate. Moreover, it created animosity between the combatants so it also served as a distraction, preventing a coalition from being formed against them.

“True Immortal probably has the best odds.” Jian Ming said.

“I’m afraid you have no chance of winning this battlefield. Even if you beat True Immortal Spirit, they still have five more.” The daoist laughed.

“You don’t need to remind me.” Jian Ming glared at him.

“Brat, you have a chance too.” The scholar then stared at Paramount Scion.

“I probably won’t go up because I’m not that strong and True Immortal might even send out True Immortal Young Emperor eventually.” Paramount Scion shook his head.

“Three Thousand Dao has people as well.” The scholar added.

The scion nodded. Three Thousand Dao had more than just Paramount Gate as vassals. Other geniuses were certainly around to take his spot.

“What is your opinion on this, Miss Ye?” Jian Ming mustered the courage to ask.

She took a deep breath and then said: “I naturally don’t appreciate being used as a trophy.”

This gave her a sense of helplessness, being unable to affect her own outcome.

Jian Ming wanted to say something else but he was also powerless in this case. There was no hero saving the beauty here.
