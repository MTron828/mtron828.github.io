Li Qiye raised his hand, issuing a metallic clank. The two dao laws trapping the duo down pulled out and flew away, allowing the two to get up.

“Death might be spared but suffering is required.” Li Qiye glared at them.

“Boom! Boom!” He slammed his palm down and suppressed them.

One could hear the sound of grand dao breaking.

Li Qiye instantly took away their power by destroying their dao foundation. They would never be able to cultivate again. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Their hair suddenly turned gray, almost like having snow all over them. Their skin turned dried with wrinkles everywhere. These Eternals had the appearance of a ninety-year-old mortal now.

“Cough... ugh...” Lucidity King coughed as if there was something stuck in his throat. They started hunching as well, seemingly didn’t have long to live.

The crowd did sympathize with them. These masters have reigned on top of Imperial for quite some time but now, their cultivation was destroyed so they were even weaker than mortals. This sudden change could drive someone crazy and have them wish for death.

True Emperor Jiu Ning gently sighed after seeing this. It was already the best outcome thanks to Liu Chuqing.

“Cough... I feel that death is probably more comfortable than this.” The king made fun of himself.

Alas, there was nothing he could do since his fate up to Li Qiye.

“Hmph, you brought this upon yourself. Be a good mortal from now on and live out the rest of your days in peace.” The emperor scowled.

Of course, her action betrayed her words. She certainly expended tremendous efforts in order to come down here for her father.

The crowd thought that they wouldn’t be able to accept this reality after seeing the two decrepit men. Others might have committed suicide instead.

“Well, I guess there’s nothing bad about being a mortal.” Lucidity King coughed before speaking each time and put on a wry smile, seemingly accepting this reality.

The emperor raised her hand and an immortal stem materialized in her palm. It eventually spread into two separate flowers.

They looked like lotuses with a blue shade, looking quite bewitching and filled with immortal energy.

“You and Uncle Sun can live for a long time with the power of the Yellow Springs. One for you and one for him, enough to prolong your lifespan by three to five hundred years. It’s perfectly fine to experience the life of a mortal now.”

A period of five hundred years would feel like the blink of an eye for an Eternal. However, this could be considered a miracle for a mortal.

“An immortal item...” Even a fool knew how precious these flowers were.

“Ah... what more can I ask for, I suppose we have to keep on living.” The king smiled and said. He was quite satisfied with this not because of the extra years of life but rather his daughter’s love. She clearly searched for this immortal flower after learning that his lifespan was up and chose to come down again. What more could he ask for?

“Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness...” Sun Lengying got on his knees to accept the flower.

“Stand up, Uncle Sun. You deserve this for toiling all this time.” The emperor nodded.

Sun Lengying and Lucidity King were master and servant in name but their bond was brotherly. Thus, True Emperor Jiu Ning also considered Lengying to be a senior.

“Go now, experience the life of a mortal.” She flicked her finger and opened a dao portal to send the two away.

People averted their gaze after those two disappeared. From now on, the world would never see or hear anything about the duo again.

Of course, this was already the best end they could hope for, leaving alive with a prolonged lifespan.

“Okay, the show is over now, back to what you were doing before.” Li Qiye stretched, seemingly indifferent and lazy.

It was hard for people to connect his two facets - a destructive existence versus a lazy commoner.

Li Qiye left with Liu Chuqing. The emperor also followed them.

“It’s finally over.” The crowd sighed and started departing. Peace returned to the area.

This shocking battle ended with the destruction of the Mu and Solar Daoist. The entire world became frightened and speechless.

“A new era is starting. Only two behemoths are left.” One expert reflected.

An ancestor disagreed: “No, Nine Secrets will reign alone because of Fiercest. I’m sure the Li will become reclusive because Fiercest is essentially a supreme progenitor, the crownless king of Imperial now.”

“Right, absolute hegemony.” Everyone understood that no one could rival Fiercest right now, not even the Li Clan.

Fiercest wasn’t a progenitor yet but his status exceeded one.

Sure enough, the Li closed their doors. Their ancestors announced that they could live in seclusion from now on. Their disciples wouldn’t visit other parts any longer.

The weaker experts were astounded to hear this. Of course, the knowledgeable ancestors expected this.

The Li and Nine Secrets should have been in charge now with the Mu gone if it wasn’t for Fiercest. His existence allowed Nine Secrets to be superior.

The Li understood this and got out of Fiercest’s way, hence their new isolation policy. This served to show Fiercest their stance on top of preserving their strength in a safe manner.

“The Li is quite smart. There’s a reason why Jade-break True Emperor became the most brilliant emperor of this generation.” Many ancestors understood the Li’s predicament and agreed with their wise move.

“Yes, it’s the right time or disaster may come.” An Eternal added.

After their declaration, many other great powers and mighty ancestors also announced the same policy. This left Imperial in a serene state, no longer as rowdy as before.

Even the most overbearing sect and egotistical geniuses no longer made a sound. They either started cultivation behind closed doors or lived in remote regions to avoid any possible danger.

This was actually a great opportunity for the geniuses. Fiercest’s invincibility served as a warning. Those with a firm dao heart began to focus on training to grow stronger. Even if they would never be able to surpass Fiercest, they would at least be able to surpass themselves.

The world calmed down and started taking cultivation more seriously.
