Chapter 5588: The User Matters More

Others didn’t understand why the prime emperor chose defeat despite having the manpower to continue fighting.

Some appreciated his insight and vision - there was no need to throw away a clan built through the hard work of many eras over momentary rage.

The opponent was unfathomable, not to mention the immortal weapon. Even apex cultivators couldn’t stop it.

Thus, Luminous Conqueror’s interference gave West Bank a chance to back down while still maintaining face.

“This is a good thing.” An ancestor from a great power whispered: “Internal fighting will only help Celestial Court.”

“Right, we are in this together, killing each other is silly. We must focus on preparing against Celestial Court instead.” Many big shots voiced their opinion, making it easier for West Bank to retreat.

They knew that this was a matter of pride and reputation for West Bank. Yielding in public required a perfect explanation.

“Sir, would this be alright?” Luminous asked Li Qiye.

Li Qiye glanced in the direction of West Bank and then at his immortal weapon. He waved his hand and said: “I’ve grown soft recently. The old me would have destroyed West Bank with a smile.”

Members of West Bank glared furiously at Li Qiye. Their clan had dominated for so long and now, they were taken down a notch by this unknown cultivator.

“Sir, thank you for your benevolence. It is for the sake of The People.” Luminous tried to dispel the animosity.

Li Qiye chuckled and stopped commenting.

“Brother, may I inquire about the origin of your immortal weapon?” The prime emperor, on the other hand, showed no sign of anger.

“It’s from above.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “What now, still want to use it?”

In reality, this question was unnecessary. Every member of the crowd desired the immortal weapon.

“If I were to have it, I would mobilize and take down Celestial Court, bringing glory to The People.” The prime emperor said with vigor.

Listeners felt their blood boiling after hearing this.

“Destroy Celestial Court, glory to The People!” A big shot couldn’t help but shout.

“Destroy Celestial Court, glory to The People!” Others shouted as well.

Li Qiye was unaffected by the enthusiastic crowd.

“Sir, can this weapon take down Celestial Court?” Luminous Conqueror asked.

Li Qiye stared directly at him and said: “Mmm, conquerors wanting to become unbeatable via a weapon. Remember, the user is unbeatable, not the weapon.”

The shouting stopped after his comment. Luminous and West Bank Prime Emperor’s expression became serious.

They naturally understood this concept, given their experience with cultivation. Suitability was more important than the weapon’s strength. However, this immortal weapon was simply unreasonable and could defeat them alone.

“But this weapon can slay everything in this world. The People will never lose again with it.” The emperor said solemnly.

“Is that so? The People had Immortal Dao City, where was this undefeated streak?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Well…” The emperor had no response.

Others exchanged glances while thinking about Immortal Dao City, one of the Nine Heavenly Treasures.

The ones who entered the city still didn’t become unbeatable. None was able to truly use it against Celestial Court. Was this immortal weapon enough?

The problem was controlling these mighty artifacts. None had been able to utilize Immortal Dao City to its limit, the same might apply to this immortal weapon as well.

“As I’ve said, the user is what matters.” Li Qiye said flatly.

“What if you use it, Sir?” Luminous asked.

“I do not need it.” Li Qiye responded, leaving everyone breathless.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Without it, you cannot fight our prime emperor.” The angry dragon lord from West Bank spoke again.

“I don’t need more than a hand wave to wipe out your clan.” Li Qiye retorted.

“You!” The dragon lord despised Li Qiye’s contempt.

“We’re on the same side, don’t take it to heart.” Luminous interjected.

“May I ask for the weapon’s name?” Their progenitor, on the other hand, didn’t have a problem with Li Qiye.

“I do have a name for it, Momentous Star.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Momentous Star?” Everyone was surprised to hear the non-imposing name.

“Sir, are you leaving it to Momentous Frontier?” Luminous realized something and shocked the crowd with his question.

Anyone could see that with it, Li Qiye could slay just about anyone. Not to mention regular cultivators, all emperors and their peers coveted it.

No one would believe his intention of leaving it to Momentous Frontier.

“The mortal world requires protection, not you all.” Li Qiye said while staring at the big shots.

They had no response after hearing this.

“Go.” Li Qiye raised his hand and summoned a blinding radiance.

“Boom!” This light stemming from Momentous Dao engulfed the entire region.
