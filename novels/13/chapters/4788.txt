Chapter 4789: Joy Of The Dao

No one saw how the technique pierced Li Qiye’s chest. Was it simply too fast? This couldn’t be the case since some of the ancient ancestors were versed in speed. They should have been able to see some clues. Alas, the entire process eluded them.

In their eyes, if immortals were real, then Li Qiye was infinitely close to being one. In fact, he could claim to be an immortal and no one would say otherwise.

Therefore, Tian Tu had just injured an immortal and astounded the spectators.

“Was that attack above the dao lord level? Could he have beaten his master with it?” A divine monarch wondered.

Everyone saw Li Qiye’s power and thought that even the ten strongest dao lords in history might not be his opponent. This naturally included Blessed Dao Lord.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“My Dao.” Dan Sanqian analyzed the technique and said softly: “A control over all the dao in the world. As long as it is a dao, he can affect it.”

No one saw Tian Tu’s movement, only the successful result. Some top ancestors attributed this to a speed beyond reason. As for Dao Sanqian, he understood that this had to do with the dao, not any physical act.

As long as Tian Tu was facing a cultivator using the dao, he could turn their dao against them. Essentially, Li Qiye’s dao was the thing piercing him.

“Wonderful.” He said with admiration. In terms of dao comprehension, he was not inferior to any dao lord. All three thousand dao created by him were unique and effective in their own way.

However, he hasn’t reached an understanding of the fist like Tian Tu. It allowed him to perform an unblockable attack. This achievement was virtually impossible to duplicate.

“A sure-kill move?” One ancestor whispered at the unbelievable sight.

Strangely enough, Li Qiye calmly commented with the fist still wedged inside his body: “A rather miraculous punch, you have indeed reached the limit of the dao thanks to your obsession with the fist.”

Having said that, he slowly backed off and revealed a hole in his chest. Instead of blood gushing out, only light particles escaped.

“You should take pride in your creation.” He smiled.

“Sir, you never used your full strength, only a slight amount.” Tian Tu showed no sign of complacency and responded.

“How can anyone beat him?” A spectator gasped. The shocking punch was one thing but Li Qiye appeared unharmed as if he had just been bitten by an ant, nothing more.

“It’s rare to see someone with this level of attainment in the fist.” Li Qiye praised: “Very well, you may observe my punch.”

“Thank you for fulfilling my wish, Sir.” Tian Tu’s aura suddenly changed.

Earlier, despite the invincible nature of his punch, he still gave a peaceful impression in both temperament and showmanship. Now, he suddenly became high-spirited and dominating.

“Rumble!” Explosions echoed on the battlefield. This stemmed from the myriad laws being affected by his emotion.

The world became his fist and it was happy to do so. This phenomenon included spectators as well since they became infected by his excitement.

“The dao are celebrating.” An ancestor sensed the happiness around him and enjoyed the pleasant feeling, thinking that this made cultivation worth it.

“Your obsession is your source of joy.” Li Qiye said sentimentally.

This feeling wasn’t rare for cultivators, just not expressed in such a grand manner. At the beginning of their dao adventure, they also felt happy and excited the moment they obtained their first merit law or magical technique.

Alas, the experts here - especially the ancient ancestors - haven’t felt this way in a long time. His joy reminded them of the past and made them feel youthful again.

“This joy…” An ancient ancestor was on the verge of tears after recalling his early memories.

“Only your punch can grant me this joy.” Tian Tu said with excitement.

“Let’s get started.” Li Qiye smiled: “You should prepare yourself.”

With that, he slowly made a fist and the joy of the grand dao immediately dispersed. This was akin to a disaster happening after a grand celebration - not the best feeling for the crowd.

The world changed colors. This wasn’t due to Li Qiye’s divinity but just a regular reaction to what was about to come. Imagine a person facing an enemy who was about to deliver the ultimate blow.

Dark clouds and lightning could be seen over yonder.

“Is it coming?” Dan Sanqian looked up with a solemn expression.
