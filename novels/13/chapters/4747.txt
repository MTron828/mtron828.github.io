Chapter 4748: Heavenly Bulwark

The runic shields were large and thick like mountains. Each could protect a kingdom and withstand the mightiest onslaught.

Heavenseal then summoned an actual shield. It activated its radiance and appeared to be a portal protecting the sky.

“Skywheel Dao Lord’s Heavenly Bulwark! A patrimony weapon!” An old spectator shouted.

Patrimony weapons - treasures created with the dao lords’ full effort. The crowd was amazed because this was a level above regular dao lord weapons.

Heavenseal’s forehead became resplendent with wisps of light. These were the powers given to him by his allies.

He channeled them into the shield and caused a deafening blast. It shook the world and blew away the distant stars.

The crowd was naturally swept off their feet. Even ancient ancestors became unstable due to the violent gale and dao lord aura.

The weaker cultivators tried to get up from the ground only to find that they couldn’t move due to the dao lord suppression.

Beams of light descended from above and gathered together to form a mighty empowerment that reaches all of his allies.

“Boom!” The individual glow then pulsed and expanded until the alliance became engulfed in a vast expanse.

Fortresses formed around them, interconnected into a greater whole.

“The second variation of that patrimony weapon - Mastery.” A knowledgeable demon king took a deep breath.

Patrimony weapons were known to have three variations or techniques. Each of them represented the strongest might of the respective dao lord. Of course, this required the current user to be able to use them.

In the cultivation world, there existed a particular belief - that whenever one of these techniques would show up, the fight would be decided instantly.

They included Comprehension, Mastery, and Extinction; each stronger than the previous. The last move meant the extinction of all things, whether it be the dao or living beings.

Of course, only a few knew how to use the first variation - Comprehension, let alone the other two. It also required an immense amount of power and vitality.

In this case, Heavenseal was able to use Mastery.

“Boo!” The fortresses granted the individuals a personal defense yet connected defense. Breaking through one meant needing to go through all of them first - bypassing the spatial and temporal affinities.

Heavenseal was the main user yet this move granted similarly independent protection to all of his allies.

“I can’t believe he knows how to use Mastery. They won’t lose then, at the very least.” An undying cultivator became emotional.

“I heard only their dao lords can use the bulwark’s second variation. It seems like Heavenseal can also do it with the support from all of his men.” Someone with a deep understanding of True Immortal said.

“Heavenseal, that’s indeed the perfect title for him.” An ancestor from the same generation as Heavensaid sentimentally said: “I don’t believe Li Qiye can break this defense.”

For most cultivators, seeing a patrimony weapon was rare enough, let alone the Mastery variation. This was a moment to remember forever.

“Shall we start?” A Sky’s End ancestor took out a cauldron and activated its light.

“Buzz.” Space trembled as it poured out celestial rays. These rays shot to the sky and derived the mysteries of the grand dao.

The sky was replaced by a dao formation of the highest grade encompassing everything beneath. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Starry sparks appeared beneath Li Qiye first before turning into bright maelstroms. They were situated in a special array, putting Li Qiye at the center of the overarching formation.

This didn’t mean that he was in charge but rather, just an insect being stuck in a spiderweb and becoming one with it.

“Buzz.” Spectators from a safe distance suddenly felt their cultivation, chaos true energy, and vitality turning into zero. This included ancient ancestors.

They became helpless and didn’t have the energy to lift a single finger. This was different from a regular suppression. The latter relied on an overwhelming force while this simply robbed the affected cultivators of their strength.

“Cosmic Trap Formation.” An ancient ancestor recognized this supreme formation since he was also affected.
