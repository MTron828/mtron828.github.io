Chapter 4518: Seven Martial Pavilion

The crowd showed no sign of recognizing this title.

“Seven Martial Pavilion? Doesn’t ring a bell to me. Their item is listed fifth?” One youth said.

Only a few old men have heard of this title before. They were specifically chosen for the secret auction due to their wealth and power. They had relationships and friends everywhere as well.

“Seven Martial Pavilion was an actual lineage, not just a name?” One big shot said.

“Yes, it was real. Puresun Dao Lord talked about it before, so it has to be true.” Another important character responded.

“What item will this be?” One more became curious.

“I can’t believe something from that era is still around until now.” A famous character felt the same way.

This magical lineage was mentioned by numerous invincible masters. Alas, their members had never been seen before.

Nothing was known about its location and structure. Their merit laws and techniques were unknown as well.

This sect only existed in the words of top masters for generations now. Usually, this meant that it was a thing in the past, having been destroyed or disbanded. This wasn’t the case for Seven Martial Pavilion.

Therefore, it was rather puzzling. It would make sense for a small sect to be this unknown, but Seven Martial Pavilion was mentioned by various beings - Puresun Dao Lord, Blessed Dao Lord, Duality Master, and many others…

A lineage mentioned by these masters must have been frightening and inscrutable. Alas, its elusive nature made regular cultivators think of it as a legend only.

Only a minority was sure of its existence and stated that it was hiding for a particular purpose unknown to others.

The auctioneer coughed to get everyone’s attention and said: “We are certain that this item is from Seven Martial Pavilion. We guarantee it.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The auction house was putting its reputation on the line, proving the existence of the pavilion in the process.

“Have you met any disciple from there?” A big shot asked the auctioneer.

The latter only smiled without answering. He didn’t divulge further information on Seven Martial Pavilion. Perhaps he didn’t know anything in the first place. Only the top ancestors from the grotto were privy to this information.

“Has anyone actually seen them before?” A sacred ancestor from a prestigious clan asked.

“They do exist.” A sacred ancestor from the east answered: “In fact, they have ties to many dao lord lineages. For example, the Puresun Clan has always been very close with them.”

“Really?” One big shot was skeptical.

The sacred ancestor nodded and said: “It’s definitely true. The problem is that not just anyone can make contact. Only a few ancient ancestors from the Puresun can communicate with them. Wait, Void Imperfection Three Schools and Heavenvine Citadel, those ancient lineages, they might have connections to the pavilion as well. If anyone in the world were to know more, it would be them.”

“Not to mention the pavilion, the names you listed are becoming illusory existences. They rarely appear at all.” One big shot said.

“True, but at least their disciples have walked the world. The same can’t be said about the pavilion.” One ancestor shook her head.

“Then let’s go ask the Puresun.” A hotheaded ancestor suggested: “They’re still around.”

No one answered because this clan was officially reclusive. A few big shots might have contact with them but who would be bold enough to go there?

Ever since their reclusion, Eastern Desolace became leaderless. Nonetheless, their previous prestige remained and no one dared to disrespect them.

“It’s difficult to visit Void Imperfection and Heavenvine as well. We’re about to lose communication with them altogether.” An eastern big shot said.

In reality, they didn’t understand why these ancient lineages would choose to go into seclusion. They had dominated for so long and were still powerful.

“If we can’t find or don’t want to go, there is still another lineage that can answer this question, Bones.” The sacred ancestor from the easter suggested: “Rumor has it that Bones Dao Lord has visited Seven Martial Pavilion before. This might be the most reliable piece of information regarding this place.”

The group exchanged glances Few knew about this but the ancient ancestor was right.

“Why the hell do we need to go so far?” Someone else said: “The auction house clearly had contact for this transaction.”

Everyone then turned towards the auctioneer. If Seven Martial Pavilion’s item was here, the auction house must have met a member from there.

“Ahem.” The auctioneer said: “Esteemed Guests, I and the grotto know nothing about this. We are only responsible for the auctions, nothing else.”

The auction house clearly had no intention of revealing information about the pavilion.
