Chu Qingling was quite vexed after regaining her wits. For better or worse, she was still a True Saint. How could she feel good after being led by the nose like this?

She put the wine pot down on the table and coldly stared at him: “Her Majesty is under fire from the elders because of you, on the verge of being removed from her position. But look at you now, running to this place and enjoying yourself while the queen is still worried about you!”

She wouldn’t give a damn about this arrogant madman if the queen didn’t ask for a favor. The queen’s motive remained unknown.

Li Qiye only smirked at her dissatisfaction: “There’s a price for everything, no one gets something from doing nothing. For example, flattering one’s master - bowing their head and bending their back - all necessary in life.”

He took another sip before continuing: “This logic is amplified when one vies for great power. If Wang Han can’t even handle dealing with her clan, then how can she rule the system and its lineages? Such incapability would only waste any further investment from me on her. Because of this, she needs to prove herself first.”

He then gave her a quick glance: “You think Wang Han told you to take care of me, but I’m afraid you have misunderstood her. She actually wants you to serve me well.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“You!” Since when did she need to serve anyone in Insane Court? Who would dare to accept such treatment?

He ignored her again and said: “You should be thanking Wang Han. This act of her clearly shows how much she likes you. Otherwise, she wouldn’t give such a godsend opportunity to someone else! She hopes that with this, you would be better equipped to help her in the future.”

“Unfortunately, she needs more time to hone her people skill, too used to being in the backstage so she lacks decisiveness and toughness. If she can make the necessary change, she’ll definitely be able to become the next empress.” He claimed.

With that, he put down his cup and tapped the table with an order: “Fill it up.”

“You!” Despite her anger and unwillingness, she still filled the cup for him, seemingly possessed.

“Don’t push it!” She gritted her teeth while seeing his punchable face. This was too much contempt to take.

Sijing saw her unwillingly poured the drink and had to contain her laughter by covering her mouth.

“If you’re going to do it, do it well.” Li Qiye said: “Don’t waste Wang Han’s goodwill. She could have done this herself and do a better job, but she’s hoping for a strong supporter in the future that can help her revitalize the dao system.”

“You speak as if you can make her the next empress.” Qingling scowled: “There are numerous underlying currents and schemes. Eyes are everywhere; all fixated on the royal authority. Plenty of candidates are waiting for their chance to seize the throne. They’re quite capable with strong backing too, such as Xu Zhijie. It’s easier said than done, to have Wang Han become the next leader.”

She was speaking from the heart and her own deep understanding of the current situation. Though there have been empresses before in the system, Wang Han was a queen to start. Going from queen to empress was much harder even if she was from the Wang Clan.

She would face opposition from all over the place. Both Sacred Institution and Upper Faction would not be on her side. Even her clan might not condone this either. Thus, she was in a difficult situation.

“Only the throne of Insane Court, not even grooming a True Emperor or a progenitor. Not hard at all, I can just pick anyone and they will get the role. Of course, we’ll wait to see if she can handle the current problems first.” He nonchalantly replied.

Qingling stared at him in a daze, thinking that he had turned crazy at this moment to be able to make such a comment.

“Who do you think you are? A True Emperor, or a progenitor?” She snorted while revealing the realities of things: “The throne of the system can’t be decided by one person alone. Even if the external powers choose not to participate, the ones in the court will struggle to the very end. The four great powers will balance out each other before deciding the next emperor through negotiation.”

The four great powers themselves had to reach an internal consensus through deliberation. For example, Sacred Institution was divided into the Northern Territory and Southern Courtyard. If Silver Fox from Northern Territory wanted the entire institution to help him, he must convince the Southern Courtyard to back him up as well. Otherwise, Southern Courtyard could have their own candidates, and the power of the institution would be divided.

“That’s because you’re not me.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Your rules are meaningless to me, I can appoint whoever I want as the new emperor. Sacred Institution? Upper Faction? Futile. There are countless clans and sects in this system, but only one dao source. As long as it is around, I am the lord of this place, understand?”

She stood there, confused and befuddled while staring at him in a daze. She was now confident that this was not an ignorant or an insane man. The problem was the content coming out of his mouth. She didn’t know how this ordinary-looking fella was going to take care of the great powers and suppressing all the other clans and sects so that Wang Han can take the throne.

If someone were to be capable of this feat, it would be a True Emperor produced by the system. This was the only being who could be above the laws and force all other powers into submission. Otherwise, it would only be a fool’s daydreaming.

“That’s why you should be cherishing this opportunity and seize it.” Li Qiye raised another empty cup.

She inadvertently followed his command in a natural and instinctive manner as if she was his maid.

“Hmph. Egomaniac.” Her wits returned and she realized what had just happened.

“I don’t know about that, but I do know that without training, you will not become a True Emperor regardless of your great talents and comprehension. There exists a tribulation, all will be for naught if you can’t overcome it.” He said slowly.

“Nonsense!” She disagreed: “You don’t think I know my own situation better than anyone?”

“Is that so?” He smiled in response: “I know that your two dao from True Emperor Chu and Insane Ancestor are not meshing well. The merit law from the emperor, regardless of how amazing and powerful it is, still originated from the grand dao of the progenitor. Thus, in order to go further, the most suitable merit law is still from the progenitor’s foundational methods. Unfortunately, there are too many fools in this world, only seeing what’s in front of them. Instead of cultivating these foundational pillars, they chose to pick the high-level imperial laws. But if the foundational methods were useless, the progenitor wouldn’t have used them to create the dao land here, shaping them into the very foundation of this place!” He looked at her and said.

She was certainly shocked because he had aptly revealed her current situation.

In fact, many ancestors were aware that the merit laws from True Emperor Chu were no match for the progenitor.

However, a few thought that she was too gifted. Cultivating these foundational methods would only be a waste of time.
