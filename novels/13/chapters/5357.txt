Chapter 5358: One Leaf, One World

The nine leaves contained supreme power, making it difficult to cross through them. Nonetheless, this must be done in order to climb the entire tree whose pinnacle existed at the end of the sky. While standing up there, it felt as if the entire cosmo was within reach.

In reality, a bud existed at the highest point, yet to become the tenth leaf. On this bud was a water bead the size of a fist.

It seemed to be carved out of a crystal but no crystal could ever compare to it. Time seemed to be flowing within.

When a cultivator utilized their heavenly gaze to observe the water bead, they would be drawn into the temporal affinity within.

It allowed them to observe any moment in the past, not missing a single detail. They could watch the moment of their birth and listen to their first cries. They could also see their most painful or happiest memories.

The future was encompassed as well - seeing a future version within the light - a moment of standing on the apex or living reclusively. It could also be a terrible fate of being banished to an inescapable dimension, languishing for ages to no avail.

Therefore, it became impossible not to be immersed in gazing at the water bead. It simply contained too much relevant information. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Spectators had different emotions while looking at it. Some rejoiced and raised their fists while others expressed sadness and remorse…

“Anima dreamwater!” A conqueror shouted its name, wanting nothing more than to grasp it.

Ancestors and lords didn’t need this water right now. Although it was priceless, they had no use for it yet. In fact, most would never reach this level.

Only the strongest dragon lords and above desired it for the sake of traveling farther on the dao path. Some were only one step away from anima and this could be the final push.

Many began climbing the tree, hoping to be the chosen ones. They must cross through the nine leaves first for there was no other way.

Each leaf contained its own suppressive force, it also had other great fortunes and treasures. Of course, apex cultivators didn’t care for them and maintained their focus.

Some first-timers overestimated their ability and were knocked down instantly by the first leaf. Top cultivators, on the other hand, kept a steady ascension.

“So this is anima dreamwater.” Xiao Hu activated his heavenly gaze to take a look for the first time while being overwhelmed emotionally.

He heard about this water so many times in the past and wanted nothing more than to obtain it for his master.

As time passed, he found that the dreams in the water seemed so real. This was as if he was seeing into his own past and future. ?He protected his dao heart but leaving this trance proved to be exceedingly challenging.

“Pop!” Li Qiye smacked the back of his head and pulled him out of the vision.

“Is it true?” The youth bowed in the direction of Li Qiye first, no longer daring to look at the water.

“This is what you are looking for, anima or the true self.” Li Qiye said: “What you saw in the past and the future were merely your own thoughts. Whether they’re true or not is debatable since the dreamwater does not have all of your memories. It can’t derive your future either so it is up to you to find your true self. That is when the visions stop.”

“So I only saw my own thoughts just now?” Xiao Hu calmed down and murmured.

“Yes, they are reflections of what is in your mind. You must find your true self among them.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I can’t then.” Xiao Hu said without confidence and believed that only the apex cultivators could do so. He had a long way to go before being able to find his true self.

Meanwhile, Ferocity observed the dreamwater as well without being mesmerized by the events.

“Activate!” When the time was right, he entered his own mind and found anima. After all, he already had a sacred tree so this wasn’t difficult for him.

His eyes became resplendent and the aura spread to the rest of his body. Xiao Hu felt as if he was igniting his life, causing him to be filled with vitality and life force. Ferocity had reached a mighty level but the dreamwater was still useful to him.

“Boom!” Suddenly, an eruption of power sent many cultivators flying.

A group had reached the ninth leaf and set their sight on the highest point of the tree. Unfortunately, there was only one drop of dreamwater.

Therefore, a fierce battle between four combatants ensued. It included one conqueror and three ancient gods who were brothers.

The latter worked together to suppress the single enemy.
