Chapter 3694: Wish Ward’s Items

“What is it?” The monk stared at Feiyun with his bright eyes.

“A weapon.” Li Qiye glanced at him before revealing.

“I see...” The monk had expected this answer but was still shaken. This gigantic statue turned out to be a weapon?

“What kind is it?” He took a deep breath and asked with a solemn expression.

“The level of this weapon depends on the user.” Li Qiye chuckled in response.

The monk was a top master so he immediately understood the grade of this statue. This answer exceeded his and the ancestors’ expectation.

“Young Master, may I ask how does one control it?” The monk took advantage of this rare opportunity and asked for guidance: “Our ancestors have tried everything, from dao methods to ancient arts, and still failed.”

They naturally knew that it wasn’t a simple statue or a work of art. This must have been something incredible but they couldn’t invoke anything out of it.

They had no choice but to give up, thinking that it might not be an actual treasure. This continued on in the long history of Wish Ward.

However, intuition told the monk that Li Qiye definitely knew the secrets behind this statue and even a method to control it.

There was no reason for this belief, only mere intuition. Others would find this illogical and ridiculous, not the monk.

“Ancient arts? How old are these ancient arts?” Li Qiye asked.

“At least from the Nine Worlds Epoch.” The monk contemplated and said: “A few were created by the great emperors.”

The previous epoch was so long ago. It became a part of legends now. Only a few arts and techniques have been passed down to the present.

Wish Ward had enough resources and a strong foundation, granting them access to these old arts and methods.

“Nine Worlds?” Li Qiye shook his head in response: “This statue appeared in an epoch way before that.”

“Way before? How old is it then?” The monk gasped and said.

The nine worlds were part of the past. In reality, the majority of cultivators had no idea about its existence.

“Beyond your imagination.” Li Qiye told the truth.

“I see. But I suppose that’s not enough to trouble you, Young Master.” The monk calmed down and flattered.

“Monk, don’t play games with me.” Li Qiye glanced at the monk and said.

“Amitabha, I do not dare to do so.” The monk placed his palms together in a dignified manner, trying to act wise but this didn’t work due to his appearance.

“It’s true, I can control it.” Li Qiye smiled and moved on.

The monk was shaken after hearing the confirmation despite his prior intuition. Just imagine, the great Wish Ward couldn’t understand this statue yet Li Qiye could do so in no time at all.

Perhaps Li Qiye was similar to an immortal. Regular people had no chance of gauging him.

“Young Master? How do we do it?” The monk caught up and asked.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t answer, continuing his stroll through the courtyard.

The monk was smart enough to drop the issue. If Li Qiye didn’t wish to tell him, no need to pursue this for further humiliation.

“Not bad at all.” Li Qiye eventually commented: “There are many hidden ace cards buried here, a treasury too.”

“Just a few things to take care of the thieves, haha.” The monk smiled.

“Let us see your metals now.” Li Qiye ordered.

“Please follow me, Young Master.” The monk led the way.

Wish Ward had too many stores and buildings. It was no different from a labyrinth; people could easily get lost on the first visit.

He brought Li Qiye to a secret room inside a mansion. They then traveled through numerous portals and doors, each guarded by powerful cultivators.

Perhaps the entrances would take people to a different treasury. Thus, mighty ancestors kept an eye out.

The truth was that as the biggest store in West King, the foundation here exceeded virtually all powers. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the treasury of Vajra was truly inferior in comparison.

The presence of wealth demanded vigilance. Outsiders weren’t qualified to enter but the monk was a special exception.

Nonetheless, despite being the current chief manager, the monk alone couldn’t make a decision on something so important.

He required the keys from several ancestors before entering the last treasury.

“Our best divine metals are in here, some belong to us while others are on consignment. Please take a look.” He said.

The lack of light in this particular storage was made up by the scintillating rays exuded from various metals.

Each ore had its own cabinet protected by seals. An intruder wouldn’t be able to take them right away.

Li Qiye came to the closest one. It had a fire ore around the size of a fist yet wielded the intensity of a sun. The flames oozing from it could incinerate the firmaments. Fortunately, it was sealed inside. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Purified solar onyx.” Li Qiye smiled and said. This was a rare divine metal reserved for supremes and dao lords.

“It’s on consignment from a sect. They want to trade it for longevity pills at the supreme level.” Untethered Monk said.

Supremes were extremely powerful since they stood at the apex of the Heavenly Sovereign realm. Once these beings were old, it became quite hard to replenish their vitality.

Moreover, they have used plenty of longevity pills before so this type of medicine became less effective.

Thus, a bottle of pills capable of prolonging their life was immensely expensive.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything else. The monk could tell that he wasn’t interested and introduced him to something else: “How about this one? Our eighth-generation chief manager bought it from an ancient sect. It has been here for a long time.”

This particular ore looked like snow. They felt a chilling presence from it before getting close.
