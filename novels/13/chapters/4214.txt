Chapter 4215: Light of the Worlds

The crowd was stirred by Li Qiye’s determination to go against Nine-wheel and Sea Emperor.

Moreover, they were also tempted by Myriad Era. This was unavoidable due to the history of the heavenly swords.

Sword Sea Dao Lord became unbeatable due to Vastsea and created an eternal kingdom. Thus, if they were to obtain Myriad Era, perhaps they could enjoy a similar path.

This was doubly true for the lineages without one. Myriad Era could turn them into a behemoth just like Sea Emperor.

Realizing this fantasy required disruption from Li Qiye. Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel would never give anyone else a chance. This was obvious since they sent their strongest cultivators here.

However, a monster like Li Qiye could potentially shake the situation enough for openings to be available. Maybe they would have a chance to see or even seize the sword then.

“It’s going to be a great battle.” One spectator said.

A few wanted to fan the flames but hesitated since they were afraid of the behemoths.

“Fine, till death then!” Void shouted furiously at Li Qiye.

Peace Ocean clearly tried to de-escalate the situation prior but Li Qiye kept on pushing the issue. Thus, he couldn’t show weakness for the second time.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

They and their sects weren’t afraid of trouble. Plus, their overlords were present as well.

“Your insistence will force us to speak with the blade.” Peace Ocean said.

Throwing away previous feuds was already Sea Emperor’s biggest concession. They had never done something like this before.

Alas, Li Qiye refused to accept this gesture so it was time to fight.

“Come.” Li Qiye said flatly.

His frivolous and indifferent attitude vexed the duo. He was treating them like thin air despite their current status and authority.

“There is no going back then!” Peace Ocean uttered coldly with a murderous glint in his eyes.

Li Qiye has broken all pretenses with Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel. There was no need to hide their bloodthirst any longer.

“Sure thing.” Li Qiye said.

“Let’s get started then!” Void lost his cool and summoned a treasure.

“Boom!” A colorful dao lord flame had a transcending presence. It was as if a dao lord was here in person.

“Damn!” Thus, the crowd shouted in horror, unable to handle the pressure from its aura. Some became paralyzed on the ground and couldn’t move.

“This… this is a patrimony weapon!” An expert calmed down and shouted.

Everyone saw a treasure resembling a scroll or a seal floating above Void. The flames oozing from it varied in colors, capable of engulfing all of Eight Desolaces in the blink of an eye. The world seemed to be spinning and adhering to its whim.

A dao lord must have spent everything they got in the creation of this treasure - untold effort and immense power.

“Light of the Worlds, the patrimony weapon of Nine-wheel Dao Lord.” An old ancestor gasped after seeing this.

“A patrimony weapon is actually before us.” A youth murmured.

“So Nine-wheel has one…” Another peer said.

“It’s not surprising, they did have four dao lords. It’s likely that one would leave a patrimony weapon behind.” A big shot said.

“Because Nine-wheel Dao Lord is rumored to be just as brilliant as Sword Sea Dao Lord, it might be normal for him to leave behind a patrimony weapon. He might have crafted something better for himself.” An ancient ancestor appeared and joined the conversation.

“Patrimony weapons are far more potent than regular dao lord weapons.” Everyone became envious of Void.

After all, not all dao lord lineages had a patrimony weapon.

“He’s the youngest sect master in their history, being able to control a patrimony weapon is a testament to his power and talent.” One expert said.

Patrimony weapons were also made by dao lords. The key difference was their rarity. Dao lords could craft dozens of weapons in their lifetime. However, they would normally only have one patrimony weapon since it required an absurd amount of resources and effort.

They normally left behind regular weapons for their sect and clan. This wasn’t the case for the patrimony weapons. Only a few dao lords would actually do so. Perhaps they found something stronger or it might be due to other reasons.

Though Nine-wheel didn’t have a heavenly sword, it at least had a patrimony weapon. Nine-wheel Dao Lord was a sky spirit, the first dao lord after Azure Ancestor.

Due to his incredible skill and legends, future masters believed that he had started crafting a paragon artifact, hence the abandonment of this patrimony weapon.

It was surprising to see Void possessing the patrimony weapon. Though he was the current sect master, he wasn’t the strongest member there. Many ancestors from Nine-wheel were more capable. Thus, it showed his status in the sect and future potential.

Normally, those at the myriad-form realm would be able to control dao lord weapons which were classified at the heaven level. This wasn’t the case for patrimony weapons.

They exceeded the heaven level and had a higher requirement for their users. It seemed that Void met the criteria for this weapon. Both the young and old were impressed by this revelation.
