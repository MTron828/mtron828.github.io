Chapter 4387: Dominating Without Lifting A Finger

Everyone thought that Li Qiye was dead for sure. How did a first-dao sovereign be so powerless? His opponent didn’t lift a single finger from start to finish.

“Boom!” The gigantic figure leaped out of the crater and let out a furious roar.

The moment he was smashed onto the ground, he regained freedom. Though he was covered in wounds, he was still doing fine.

“Engulfing Flurry!” His staff became as thick and long as a mountain range, shooting upward and piercing the sky vault.

He then smashed the entire mountain range downward and broke the fabric of space. Spectators gasped as a result; some felt their knees buckling.

This attack was enough to instantly destroy a small sect and its ancestral ground.

“Poof!” Li Qiye’s fiery wings became resplendent just like a rising phoenix. The inferno turned into a massive foot heading straight at the staff.

One had the immensity of a mountain range while the other was simply unstoppable.

“Boom!” All entities within ten thousand miles were sent flying from the impact.

The outcome was absolutely one-sided. The foot easily cut through the staff and hit the demon. Though he was shrouded by true energy, it still didn’t prevent his bones from breaking.

“Ahh!” His chest completely caved in as he vomited blood. He fell to the ground and created another crater, one stained with his blood.

“Bam!” The foot didn’t stop there and stomped on him.

“Activate!” The weakened Bear King still didn’t want to give up. He raised both hands, wanting to lift up the foot.

Alas, this ended with both of his hands being crushed. It then stomped repeatedly on the helpless victim, breaking more bones in the process. Eventually, he was on his last breath; his flesh pulverized.

Even the great demons were left speechless. They thought Bear King would put up a better fight instead of this domination.

“Fellow Daoist, please show mercy.” Long-armed Monkey King beseeched.

Li Qiye glanced at him once without saying anything. Though there was no blatant expression of disdain, the monkey king felt that he was an ant on the ground while Li Qiye was a soaring true dragon. The dragon simply looked down on the ant once without giving it any thought.

This froze him and even made his legs tremble. As a top ancestor of Phoenix Ground, he was not weaker than Goldbird Monarch.

However, just a casual glance unaccompanied by any aura frightened him. He wondered if Li Qiye would actually give him face and spare the bear demon.

“Young Noble, please forgive Bear King’s insolence and spare him.” Jian Qingzhu asked Li Qiye to show mercy.

Though they had fought earlier, she wasn’t one to hold a grudge. After all, he was a senior on top of not bearing that much malice towards her.

Meanwhile, Bear King no longer made any sound outside of labored breathing.

“Fine, I’m in a good mood and will spare him.” Li Qiye lazily said.

Having said that, the fiery foot along with the pair of wings disappeared. Li Qiye assumed his normal appearance once more.

The only thing that reminded people of what had transpired was the messy state of Bear King and the craters. Other great demons came to help and took him away.

Eyes of astonishment fixated on Li Qiye.

“How did he do it? It looked like a god was on his side.” One disciple said. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The pair of wings came out of nowhere and effortlessly defeated Bear King. Someone like Li Qiye shouldn’t have enough power to beat a Heavenly Sovereign.

Alas, they all saw it with their own eyes, hence their confusion.

“He must have a treasure of the phoenix affinity or an immortal flame.” One of them commented on the fiery wings. This was the only explanation since Li Qiye himself didn’t do anything.

“I just can’t see what merit law or method he used.” One expert didn’t give up on observing Li Qiye.

Meanwhile, Jian Qingzhu came over and bowed her head: “Thank you, Young Noble.”

The monkey king also did the same. Both knew that Li Qiye could have done whatever he wanted and that it wasn’t a big deal for Li Qiye to do so.

“You may do whatever you want. This is not my problem anymore.” He told Jian Qingzhu.

“Grandpa…” She said.

He became sentimental because he watched her grow up. Alas, he couldn’t stand on her side this time.

“I don’t think you’ll be able to leave the city.” He warned.
