Chapter 3741: Challenge Letter

The news of the letter startled everyone.

“It’s here.” The experts on Minor Sacred Mountain became nervous, especially the younger ones.

The provocation from the scion infuriated them. Alas, there was a touch of helplessness because he was just too powerful. Few could actually fight him directly and make him pay for his contemptuous attitude.

All eyes were on the base of the mountain now. They saw three people slowly appearing in their vision - two men and one woman From RIghteous Sect. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

They had a calm expression despite going up against the mass. Though peace existed between the two powers, being under so much scrutiny would warrant some anxiety.

This wasn’t the case for the letter bearers. They seemed to be strolling, completely undeterred by the gazes.

The mark of Righteous on their uniform looked particularly conspicuous and provocative due to the circumstances.

The woman stood in the center, seemingly in charge. She wasn’t older than Dugu Lan.

In terms of appearance, she was pretty with an oval face. Her eyes were bright like the stars with unique lights hidden within.

She wore a faint blue dress without any jewelry and ornaments. It looked like a regular outfit yet upon closer inspection, it was perfectly fitted.

She was pretty, not in an astonishing manner. Her beauty resembled a pristine piece of jade, exquisite without being carved. Her eyebrows were unique - emerald and pointing slightly upward. She had a faint smile, looking rather amicable.

Of course, there was a disparity between her and Dugu Lan. The latter was gorgeous, enough to sway the soul at first glance.

To her left was a saber-wielder. He had a large stature - half flesh and half stone. It gave off a fortified and powerful presence.

Despite having a bulky frame made of stone, he didn’t look heavy and sluggish at all. His steps were as light and free as the clouds.

To the right was a tall and slender man with a white complexion. He seemed quiet and graceful like a weak scholar. One gale could probably send him flying. His weapon of choice was a whip coiled around his arm, looking nimble like a spirit serpent.

“Two from the five prodigies of Geniuses.” No one recognized the woman in the center. However, most knew the two men.

Due to the relationship between Righteous and Buddha, cultivators would normally travel back and forth. Thus, the members of the holy ground were familiar with the top talents in Righteous.

“Thunderblade Xiao Fengyun and Cloudwhip Liu Huaishi.” Some could be considered acquaintances with them. It just wasn’t the right time for a greeting.

“This only shows how strong the scion is, having these five prodigies as the vanguard.” One spectator commented.

Similar to the holy ground, Righteous also had numerous sects and countries within its territories. The five great prodigies were the top talents from there.

“Who is that girl?” This became the next question.

She should have a unique status in order to have these two as her escorts. However, no one recognized her, not even those who have stayed at Righteous for a long time.

“I don’t know, maybe a disciple of an elder from Righteous Sect.” Someone speculated.

The actual Righteous Sect was similar to Sacred Mountain. The members of the latter rarely showed up. If a disciple from an elder there were to walk around the holy ground, they would be treated with the utmost respect.

The crowd applied this same logic to the woman. To be the letter messenger from the scion was indicative of her high status.

“I am Xu Cuimei of Righteous Sect.” She stopped before the steps and smilingly cupped her fist: “Our sect’s scion will be coming to the holy ground to challenge its heroes. The challenge letter is here today. Please excuse the lack of etiquette and decorum.”

The crowd was certainly annoyed or infuriated at the scion’s disdainful challenge. However, this girl was polite so they couldn’t vent their anger or it would reflect badly on the holy ground.

After all, she came alone without an army all the way to Minor Sacred Mountain. Treating her improperly would show a lack of elegance and grace.

Thus, they remained silent. Moreover, accepting this letter meant bearing the brunt of the responsibility by actually fighting the scion.

They needed to have enough power to do so lest they want to embarrass themselves. They turned towards Dugu Lan. Even Phantom and Hu Ben did so.

“The scion is gifted and ambitious.” Dugu Lan answered: “Our holy ground is not belligerent. This doesn’t mean we’re afraid of fighting. If he wishes to see our techniques, then we will show him what we can do. I, on behalf of the members of Buddha Holy Ground, accept this challenge.”

Dugu Lan spoke calmly without any hostility. Her response was thoughtful, earning her the praise of the crowd.

They then waited for Xu Cuimei to hand the challenge letter over. In order to get there, she must make it through Conqueror and Virtuous Rank.

This shouldn’t be a problem for Thunderblade and Cloudwhip. What about this girl?

“Your reputation precedes you, Fairy Dugu.” Xu Cuimei smiled and walked up the steps with the two men behind her.

She had no problem reaching Virtuous Rank before curious gazes.
