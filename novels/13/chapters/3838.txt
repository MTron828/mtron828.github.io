Chapter 3839: Three Slashes

Three Slashes, the young lord of the Biandu. This was obviously not his given name. However, due to his incredible skill with the saber, no one could last more than three moves against him. That’s why others kept on calling him Three Slashes. They forgot his real name entirely. [1]

Three Slashes appeared before the crowd, dressed in black from top to bottom with the exception of his golden belt. His silky black hair draped down his shoulders, looking beautiful like two waterfalls.

Tall and handsome with a perfect posture, not overly muscular yet each of his lines and little details brimmed with power and vigor. They seemed to have been polished by a blade, looking sharp in a natural manner.

His saber was still in its sheath yet people could easily imagine how sharp and fierce it was. The moment it came out, it would be able to slay anyone. The saber has become a part of him. Thus, its aggressive aura influenced his own.

Because of this, people shuddered at his sight even though he didn’t purposely release his aura for intimidation purposes. Just his presence alone froze others with fear and trepidation.

There were experts from the clan accompanying him. Alas, they paled while standing next to him. The crowd didn’t pay attention to them at all.

“Destined for greatness since his birth. Having his own grand dao at such a young age, so peerless.” One older master commented.

“Yes, a heaven’s favorite.” Another admitted: “He had a perfect harmony with the saber dao from the very start, seemingly born for the blade.”

A clan ancestor nodded: “Putting his excellent talents aside, he’s also very diligent and unyielding, having trained in Black Tides before. That’s not something other geniuses can handle.”

Most felt admiration towards Three Slashes while a small minority wasn’t convinced. After all, they thought that his achievements and success were due to his clan. He had all the advantages growing up in the Biandu.

However, some geniuses took a deep breath after hearing about his training in Black Tides. This certainly changed the narrative.

Even the big shots from the last generation didn’t want to enter, let alone train there. Nonetheless, Three Slashes actually did it and came back alive.

“His saber is obtained from Black Tides, he’s definitely blessed by heaven.” A knowledgeable spectator stared at the saber and praised.

“He got it from there?!” Those nearby became startled.

“Yes, rumor has it that he found it during his youth while just strolling by the shore.” Another answered. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Of course, this wasn’t the first time the Biandu got something good from Black Tides. Due to their deep knowledge of this ocean, they found many great things and truly benefited from it.

Others immediately came up to greet him in order to make a good impression. Three Slashes could become the future leader of the Biandu. It would be great to have a good relationship with him.

“The Grand Seer himself, I wonder who this heavenly genius will be.” Three Slashes had the best position to stare at the well.

Seer Watch was built on this peak. The actual main building was obviously aged and could only accommodate a hundred people or so.

In front of it was a well made from rocks piling on top of each other. Who knows if it’s from too many people taking water from there across the generations or some other reason. The initially coarse rocks were now polished and bright.

It served as the centerpiece for the divination ceremony.

“Who else but you, Young Lord, is worthy of being called a heavenly genius?” Another youth smiled and flattered in a blatant manner.

Nonetheless, it wasn’t too outrageous because Three Slashes was indeed a capable genius.

Three Slashes chuckled after hearing this but eventually shook his head: “That’s too much of an exaggeration, I don’t dare to claim supremacy in the south, let alone the rest of the world. Both Righteous Scion and the wild child are not inferior and there are plenty of hidden experts in Eight Desolaces.”

“I see, you’re so insightful to see the broader picture. I’m nothing but a frog under the well.” The youth earlier changed his approach right away.

His comment won him some love from the audience, especially the cultivators from Righteous Sect and the eight kingdoms. Righteous Sect naturally thought that their scion was the strongest. The eight kingdoms thought the same for the wild child.

Of course, some disagreed with him. For example, Yang Ling. She simply chose to hold her words. In her eyes, no one was a match for the young master.

As people tried to please Three Slashes, loud commotions came from the base of the peak again.

The spectators made way once more for another newcomer.

“Who is it?” People were surprised to see the special treatment that was previously enjoyed by Three Slashes.

A woman eventually made it up to the peak. She had followers as well.

Her simple outfit didn’t diminish her heroic presence. She wasn’t a supreme beauty or anything but was still quite pleasing to the eyes in her own special way.

“General Wei.” Someone shouted. The male cultivators naturally enjoyed this development.

The newcomer was none other than Wei Qianqing. However, she wasn’t in armor today.

This allowed others to see her appearance. They were left in awe. Sure, she wasn’t as pretty as Dugu Lan. Nonetheless, she had a bold aura that made her quite charming.

The soldiers behind her were also in civilian attire. This wasn’t enough to hide their fierceness.

“The commander of the Sentinel Legion.” Even the big shots from the last generation came to greet her.

This powerful legion from Vajra was garrisoned in Black Wood. Some believed that they were only second to the Biandu in terms of military potential.

The main difference was that they never interfered with Black Wood’s business. Their only mission was to watch over Black Tides.

1. This is the problem with translation for titles and names. Sandao can be a name and a title in Chinese but I have to pick Three Slashes. This makes the paragraph strange in English. I chose Sandao at first because it’s smoother. Then I had to change it because of a description from the last chapter. Now, for this paragraph, Sandao and a note about its meaning would have been better. It is what it is.
