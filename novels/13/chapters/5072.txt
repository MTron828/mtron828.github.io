Chapter 5073: Kind-hearted And Respectful

“Young Noble, can you tell us what you want?” The dragon knew that Li Qiye wouldn’t leave so easily.

“From my perspective or yours first?” Li Qiye said.

“Ours first, of course.” They exchanged glances and the tiger spoke.

“Okay, then let’s start with what you two want, what is the final state?” Li Qiye smiled.

“We aren’t sure. For now, we wish to make this land and epoch more fertile.” The dragon responded.

“Keep in mind that this is a destroyed epoch, a vestige of the past. What you’re doing is just wishful thinking, to be perfectly blunt.” Li Qiye said.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Wishful thinking? We have divine eggs and even an ancestral dragon. The epoch will rise again with enough time.” The tiger disagreed.

The two desired to see a world filled with divine beasts just like how it used to be.

“Is that so? I recognize your ambition and the divine eggs here, also the power and potential of your ancestral dragon.” Li Qiye said: “But don’t forget, this is my epoch. What will happen if your epoch also wishes to grow? Once there are enough divine beasts and your ancestral dragon is an adult, will you two still be in control?”

He stared at them and continued: “When you lose control, which direction will this epoch go? Will it be prosperous just like its golden age?”

The two beasts listened in silence.

“You already know the answer, that you will lose control eventually. Otherwise, you wouldn’t want more people to come here such as the Immortal Emperors or creating the deity branches. You wish to create a coalition force strong enough to steer the epoch in your desired direction, this ship is too large for you two alone.”

“Or, perhaps I’m wrong, that you two never had any intention of ruling. Once the Cosmic Ancestral Dragon becomes strong enough, it will lead the old epoch to great prosperity and potentially replace the current.” Li Qiye’s smile became wider as he said this.

“That is not our goal!” The alarmed dragon immediately responded: “We never thought about replacing your epoch with Divine Beast and are only trying to help the divine eggs. This place is large enough to accommodate all of us without needing to go outside.”

“Is that so? How will you stop the cosmic dragon and the other divine beasts from leaving?” Li Qiye asked.

The two had no answer because this was impossible.

“We will try our best.” The dragon answered.

“Good, now we can talk about it from my perspective.” Li Qiye said.

The two sighed since they knew what was coming.

“This is my epoch, understood?” He went on: “There is an old saying that has been proven true for millions of years, don’t let someone else sleep in your bed. A mountain cannot accommodate two tigers.”

“We understand.” The two beasts said.

“I am the lord of this epoch now and the future, I will not allow the existence of Divine Beast or any other epoch.” Li Qiye said: “Now, excuse me for being impolite.”

With that, his tone became dominant and aggressive: “Divine Beast is nothing in my eyes, the same for you two. I have slaughtered epoch lords, exterminated pseudo-immortals, and battled the high heaven. You all are just mortals in comparison, mere worms in my epoch. If I am willing, you may live in peace. Otherwise, you will turn into dust. My epoch, my rules.”

With that, he smiled and said: “I apologize for the harsh words. It did feel a bit pretentious.”

The two didn’t answer but still understood his point. He was right - don’t let someone else sleep in your bed. Why would he allow the existence of Divine Beast?

Any other epoch lord would try to eradicate the remnant epochs after seeing a hint of threat.

“We understand.” This was all they could say. Though they were strong, they stood no chance against him. This applied to an adult cosmic dragon as well.

He had crushed supreme overlords before and didn’t mind playing the role of a dragonslayer. Opposing Li Qiye during his prime was extremely unwise and suicidal.

Not to mention the remnant epoch of Divine Beast, he could obliterate all divine bloodlines if he became annoyed enough.

“What do you want us to do then?” The tiger had no choice but to submit. There was no other option due to the disparity of power. Their very existence depended on his whim.

“I have always been kind-hearted and respect towards the elder and the young, possessing nothing but love for all life.” He smiled.

The two beasts exchanged glances.

“Don’t look doubtful now, I am speaking from the heart. My visit is to guide you to a better path, to protect you and your cosmic dragon.” He went on.

“A cat shedding tears while catching a mouse.” The tiger was not convinced.

“I’m sure that you two take great pride in raising a cosmic dragon and the other divine beasts. Watching them grow up to become dominant existences must be satisfying.” He said.

“Hmph, obviously.” The tiger remarked.

“But in my opinion, you’re not raising divine beasts, only a flock of helpless fat sheep. Your wonderful future does not exist, it is a mere fantasy.” Li Qiye said.

“How dare you disrespect our dream!” The tiger became angry.
