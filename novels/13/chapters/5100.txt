Chapter 5101: The Divine List

Mountain of the Ages was enveloped by a blinding radiance. It took the shape of a constantly rotating circle.

“Rumble!” The power of a conqueror ravaged the three continents.

“Ancestor!” Members of Reincarnation kneeled with teary eyes and were overwhelmed with excitement.

The ball of light continued to release waves of light. Eventually, a majestic figure landed on the ground, accompanied by an ocean of laws.

“Greenmountain.” The mantra included the title of this conqueror.

“It’s Greenmountain Conqueror!” This news traveled swiftly.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He had once dominated the lower continents and Reincarnation prospered under his reign. He ascended to the upper continents after obtaining four dao fruits.

“He has eight fruits.” The ancestors of the sect became emotional. This was enough firepower to unite the lower continents.

“He joined the alliances?” A few ancient ancestors and dragon lords quietly discussed.

Reincarnation was a special existence in that it didn’t have a clear allegiance to The Race or The People.

Though some said that Reincarnation was a tributary of Divine Alliance, it had sided with The People before in previous conflicts. Of course, it also had periods of being rather close to Deity and Heaven Burial before.

Rumor has it that their conquerors didn’t always join The Race. One example was Blazing Conqueror who most likely joined The People instead.

Now, Greenmountain Conqueror clearly represented The Race in this case.

“What a shame, he was very close to The People back then.” One ancestor sighed and said.

Because of his time at the academy, Reincarnation had a close friendship with Untethered and the other lineages.

“Yes, I recall when they worked as a team back then.” A dragon lord from that generation said: “How I miss those times.”

No one knew what happened once he ascended but this indeed surprised everyone.

Of course, the gossipers kept it to themselves and didn’t wish to provoke him.

“Poof!” At the same time, a divine scroll suddenly appeared in Primal. Images of gods were on the surface.

The sounds of horns and weapons clanking could be heard in their sacred ground. The status there became bright and resonated with the list. Their auras swept through the region and caught cultivators off guard.

“The Divine List!” Spectators in Primal couldn’t believe it!

“Welcome back, Great Conqueror!” Members from Ascension kneeled on the ground.

“Boom!” Someone landed and all the statues kneeled before him.

“Ascension Conqueror!” They shouted his title.

“He has eight dao fruits.” Someone saw the eight fruits floating above the list.

The younger disciples were ecstatic to see a famous historical figure from their sect. Alas, the ancestors had a solemn expression.

Primal had always been a part of The People. This was due to the background of their members.

In history, Primal, Untethered, and Hundred Races always protected The People’s interests. When Eternal Conqueror united the continents, he represented The People. This was the golden age of Primal.

Ascension Conqueror came from this side as well and supported it during his reign. Why did he join The Race after ascending?

This was rather ironic for Primal so the older members felt bitter about this result. Of course, the two sides weren’t as antagonistic as before but it was still a tough pill to swallow.
