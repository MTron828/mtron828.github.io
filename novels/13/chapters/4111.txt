Chapter 4112: Dark Dragon Monarch

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Rumble!” A large tsunami emerged as a mighty group rushed closer.

“Damn! The bandits are coming!” An expert shouted.

The neutral spectators hurriedly ran back because the bandits here weren’t a joke. They never cared for morality or lives.

Some didn’t bother moving away because they had paid the protection fee to Dark Gale. Thus, they were absolutely safe in Cloud Dream. At the very least, no bandits would target them.

“Boom!” One group stopped before Li Qiye and it seemed as if a colossal creature was coming out of the ocean.

A maelstrom formed and blotted out the sky. Members finally emerged, consisting primarily of demons.

Shrimp soldiers and crab generals, serpent kings and tiger demons, treants other plant-based monsters…

Thousands of them immediately surrounded Li Qiye’s entourage.

“They’re from Dark Dragon Island.” Someone recognized this group right away.

This was one of the eighteen main islands of Cloud Dream, inhabited by primarily demon cultivators. It had considerable influence in this region. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Boom!” A large figure appeared in one of the wave pillars.

Once the wave subsided, a great demon could be seen standing on top of the water. He had a human head and a snake body. He wielded a long serpent blade. His eyes were dark blue and pulsed brightly. His aura was oppressive, capable of splitting the ocean in two.

“Dark Dragon Monarch, their island lord.” One expert shouted after seeing the gigantic demon.

“He has been here for five thousand years with permission from Cloud Dream King to reside in Dark Dragon Island. He has one hundred thousand demons under him.” An older cultivator revealed.

“I built this road and planted these trees…” The monarch spewed a rather common line for bandits.

However, Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted him: “There’s no road and trees here. Stand aside.”

“Brat, do not interrupt me when I’m talking!” The monarch turned red and became angry.

Xu Yiyun stepped forward and cupped her fist: “Dark Dragon Monarch, our young noble is passing through this area. If you have no business with us, please give way and we will show you our appreciation later.”

“Hehehe, this brat is the one who got the Preeminent Legacy?” The monarch stared at Li Qiye.

“We have a show now.” One spectator whispered. Li Qiye clearly looked like a fat sheep to these bandits.

The monarch had insatiable greed in his eyes, especially when looking at the dao lord weapons floating above him.

He was ecstatic; this seemed to be a gift from heaven. This fat sheep came knocking on his door.

If he could rob this guy and grab all of those weapons, he would never have to worry about competition or needing to listen to Cloud Dream King again. He would be the true ruler of Cloud Dream Lake.

“Yes, that’s our young noble.” Yiyun said.

Dark Dragon Monarch’s saliva streamed out of his lips so he had to wipe it with his hand. He pointed his spear forward and said: “Brat, leave all of your treasures behind and I will spare you.”

“Boss, not just his treasures, all the beauties as well.” His men salivated while staring at the beauties.

“Hehehe, that’s right, so many pretty girls. We’ll have so much fun.” A river demon let out perverted laughter.

The other demons agreed and became impatient.

Their perverted expression infuriated the beauties under Li Qiye’s banner. They were relatively famous and came from powerful sects. Some were actually princesses.

Of course, their sects weren’t as large as the behemoths. Nonetheless, they didn’t need to back down before anyone.

“Barbaric idiots.” Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at the monarch when speaking: “Cut off your arm while I’m still feeling merciful, then scram.”

“Hahaha! You want me to cut off my arm? The audacity, hahaha, can’t believe an outsider is telling me this…” The monarch laughed from being too angry.

He then glared at Li Qiye and said menacingly: “Brat, hand over your sh*t before it’s too late.”

“Boss, just give us the orders, we’ll eat him down to the bones!” A serpent shouted.

“I’ll feast on his bones too!” A mouse demon said.

“Brat, did you hear that? My brothers are hungry.” The monarch said.

“Kill them.” Li Qiye lazily waved his hand while still sitting on his throne.

“Crimsondeath Monarch, your presence is required.” Xu Yiyun shouted.

“Splash!” Another tsunami formed because divine boats traveled above the water.

A mighty legion appeared out of nowhere and surrounded the demons.

“I await your orders.” Crimsondeath Monarch lowered his head. His legions consisted of myriad races. Their armor was shiny and completely new.

“This legion isn’t bad at all.” The spectators found this surprising.

Li Qiye spent a handsome sum to invite the members of this legion. Crimsondeath Monarch was left in charge.

“The young noble wishes to never see them again.” Xu Yiyun passed on the message.

“Dao Brother.” Dark Dragon Monarch was startled to see Crimsondeath.

Crimsondeath was a famous cultivator in Sword Continent, hence the monarch’s astonishment.

“Dark Dagon Monarch, blame yourself for being blind today. Die.” Crimsondeath commanded.

“Kill them!” The members of his legions immediately attacked the demon bandits.

“Take them on!” What else could Dark Dragon do at this point but fight? He swung his spear towards Crimsondeath: “Eat this!”

“Let’s go!” Crimsondeath wasn’t afraid at all and raised both hatchets for a thunderous slash.

“Rumble!” The two sides didn’t show any mercy.

The two monarchs had an incredible match and devastated the area. Waves emanated from their position.

“Ahhh!” Screams echoed while corpses fell downward. Their blood stained the water red.

Crimsondeath Monarch’s legion was well-trained, knowing when to attack and when to defend properly. Their formation was formed quickly and orderly. This allowed them to have the upper hand against the bandits.

“They’re actually doing well, this isn’t a disorderly band consisting of random recruits.” A high elder found this surprising.

These men were rewarded and heavily paid by Li Qiye. Crimsondeath, Tie Jian, and A’zhi spent time training them. Moreover, they were equipped with expensive weapons and armor. Thus, this legion was comparable to those from first-rate sects.

“Hmm, this is the training method and formation of an organized sect, how impressive.” One ancestor pointed out.
