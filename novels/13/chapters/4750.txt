Chapter 4751: Witness Invincibility

The different combos struck Li Qiye at the same time. The first rendered him immobile and helpless. His powers were then sucked out by the cosmic formation.

The more he channeled his power, the stronger the formation would become. Meanwhile, he was also hit by the five monarchs, the geniuses, and the curse of the two demons.

This culminated into the absolute destruction of the battlefield; only a sizable void zone was left behind.

This displayed the resources and power of True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao.

“Is it finally over?” Everyone thought that the mighty Li Qiye has finally fallen to the combined onslaught of numerous ancient ancestors.

“How the hell can he survive?” Another peerless ancestor murmured while staring at the void zone.

Though his body was extremely strong, his power was robbed by the cosmic formation. This rendered him vulnerable.

“So the next dao lord is back to being one of the conquerors.” An expert commented.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What a shame.” A last-gen cultivator said wistfully: “He was too careless, why didn’t he ask for reinforcement? He would have won for sure.”

“Yes, he even knew that this wasn’t a personal competition.” Many shared the same sentiment.

They respected his strength and ability, not to mention his courage to fight alone. Alas, his death also ended his limitless future.

They believed that the result could have been completely different. Moreover, he clearly had allies too. For example, Paramount Goddess was here, meaning that the temple also had his back.

His arrogance and overconfident nature were his downfalls. On the other hand, his enemies did not hold back.

“Wait, look over there!” An eagle-eyed big shot shouted.

As chaos energy was seemingly being pushed out, they finally saw a figure.

“Li Qiye!” The crowd shouted.

“He’s still alive!” They could tell that he was alive despite still being covered by the black curse.

“This is so heaven-defying.” All became emotional.

“!!!” His enemies had an alarmed expression.

“Activate.” Li Qiye shouted. Immortal rays erupted and swept through the battlefield.

Not to mention regular cultivators, even the ancient ones trembled in fear. Each ray could cut down the stars and the myriad laws.

“Buzz.” Thus, the black curse immediately disintegrated without anything left behind.

This sent the two demons flying while vomiting blood. Fortunately, the bulwark’s empowerment had created numerous dimensions in front of them and spared them from death.

“Boom!” The immortal gemstone continued to channel its power.

This, in turn, forced the formation to work harder to absorb its power. Alas, it seemed to be endless and the world had a hard time containing its might.

“Crack!” A storm gathered and cracks appeared on the formation.

It didn’t take long before the star array explode from the pressure. The results were countless detonations.

“Shit!” A Sky’s End ancestor bellowed in horror.

“Boom!” The entire formation collapsed along with the cauldron the five were carrying, leaving them with serious injuries.

Of course, divine auras from the bulwark intensified to the limit and protected them.

With the formation gone, the power of the gemstone immediately ravaged the land. Everything else became as insignificant as insects.

The attacks from the five monarchs and the geniuses were instantly obliterated. This included the halberd and the imperial sword. Nonetheless, they were also saved by the sealing bulwark, albeit left with grievous injuries.

“Ahhh!” Just being slightly touched by the immortal power caused cultivators to explode. Even ancestors nearby weren’t spared. This horrified watchers who kept a farther distance.

“Boom!” The world trembled as Li Qiye punched the wall of shields.

It immediately destroyed the countless dimensions created by them, causing great pressure on his enemies.

“Go!” The alliance channeled all of its power and vitality onto the bulwark.

This Mastery-level technique reached an immense height and managed to stop the punch.
