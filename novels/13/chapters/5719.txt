Chapter 5720: Not One Move

“Come.” Li Qiye waved with a smile.

“Very well!” The machine roared and released surging vectors.

“Rumble!” As it channeled power, three thousand worlds seemed to be pushing down on the ocean and space. The pressure was unbearable for the crowd.

“Clank!” It summoned a molten sword, seemingly having just been taken out from a cauldron.

Just a moment ago, space and time were flattened by the pressure. Now, they were being lifted by the blade and cascaded to its left and right.

The two descending ends met in the middle and merged seamlessly, creating a flawless loop.

Everything - the past, present, and future - became indistinct. All living beings entered a state of existence and disappearance. One might trace back to the past yet unable to find themselves being born or existing, seemingly vanishing from the timeline. The logic of time applied no longer.

The strange temporal phenomenon gave the machine a speed far surpassing the limit of emperors. The fastest cultivator, when affected by this temporal loop, became as slow as a turtle in comparison. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It thrust the blade forward, not displaying an overwhelmingly powerful strike. Nonetheless, it targeted all possible timelines.

Perhaps the present opponent could dodge it but what about their near-death state in the future or during their birth? The thrust aimed for the most vulnerable timelines, nullifying defensive measures.

Everyone felt their throat being pierced and opened their mouth to scream yet no sound came out.

“Clank!” Li Qiye still blocked it with two fingers. No one saw how he did it, not even the emperors.

The thrust had broken through the limits of time and changed the rules using the temporal loop. Alas, they still didn’t see how Li Qiye survived.

It felt as if Li Qiye was omnipresent in all timelines - existing in every particle of time. They got the impression that he had already raised his fingers and the blade came precisely in the center afterward. He was just that much faster than them, being bored and waiting for the attack to come.

“Clank!” He shifted his fingers, broke the blade, and threw it at the machine.

“Boom!” It pierced the chest area and caused a devastating explosion, pinning it to the seabed.

What started as astonishment at the machine’s temporal loop turned into shock at the actual outcome - the machine being nailed down by its blade.

It could massacre emperors and monarchs like chickens yet failed to last a single exchange against Li Qiye.

Of course, this had nothing to do with the machine being weak. Li Qiye was just frighteningly strong.

“This is the power of an overlord?” An emperor took a deep breath.

Those from Celestial Court never truly had the chance to witness the might of an overlord. Given the current situation, this was something beyond their comprehension. How could they ever reach this realm?

“Bang!” The machine pulled the broken blade from its chest.

“Zzz...” Vectors healed the piercing damage in no time at all.

“Only the art, not the paragon artifact.” Li Qiye said: “The actual artifact can unleash untold mysteries and incredible powers.”

“We still haven’t given up!” The machine roared and emitted a crimson light, completely different from the previous vectors.
