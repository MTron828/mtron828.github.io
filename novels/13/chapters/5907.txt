Chapter 5907: Legacy Items

“We can’t since time is running out, I don’t know if we can live until then, not to mention we’re shackled to heaven and earth.” The eye eventually spoke.

“Don’t worry, you three will live for a long time since I am around.” Li Qiye shook his head. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Barely living.” The deep voice said.

“You’ve lived for so long already, what’s a little longer? Don’t worry about the minor details.” Li Qiye waved dismissively.

“It’s fine for you to do it.” The pleasant voice said.

“I see, so in the end, it’s a matter of not wanting to do it. Looks like the feelings are sincere.” Li Qiye said.

“Just teaching, nothing more.” The deep voice uttered coldly. Nevertheless, the three knew the true answer.

“An ordinary disciple couldn’t have gotten to the position where backstabbing was possible.” Li Qiye said: “This one, on the other hand, knew and sold all of your secrets.”

“Everyone has secrets.” The deep voice said.

“Secrets are secrets when they are unknown to others.” Li Qiye smiled: “In my opinion, this is more than a master and disciple issue, more of a true successor.”

The person with the deep voice snorted.

“You three had plenty of time to groom successors, but no one did it because this was unwise, just another karmic string to tie you to the mortal world and leave yourselves more exposed than necessary.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, this has always been our biggest taboo.” The eye admitted.

“Others are not worthy of entering your sight, only transactional matters at best. Putting in the effort is akin to losing lifespan, but without time and effort, you can’t groom a capable successor.” Li Qiye said.

“We didn’t have this intention at the start.” The eye sighed.

“What changed?” Li Qiye asked.

These three stood at the apex, far more monstrous than the strongest overlords. The latter didn’t care about others, let alone them.

They didn’t care about starting lineages either since that was only a waste of time. Moreover, who could inherit their legacies, and most importantly, they could live longer than anyone.

If a successor were to die before them, what would be the point of getting one in the first place?

Alas, they somehow changed their mind and did everything they could to pass their legacies.

“So it wasn’t only to deal with that guy.” Li Qiye shook his head: “That’s only an excuse, you three wanted to pass down your legacies.”

“We’re old now.” The eye sighed and said.

“Old? Let’s entertain this notion and say that you’re no longer in your prime, you will still outlast virtually anyone.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“He... changed our mind.” The pleasant voice answered.

“I see.” Li Qiye nodded: “You saw him training a disciple in Three Immortals, a front-seat demonstration, and wanted to follow suit.”

“Perhaps it was just the right time.” The eye admitted.

“I’m sure there were other reasons than just wanting to take in a disciple.” Li Qiye said: “But what were they?” Li Qiye smirked.

The three didn’t respond.

“Forget it, I won’t pry into your secrets since I’m not after your legacies. If I did, I wouldn’t have waited until now.” Li Qiye said.

“There are things to be passed down.” The eye said.

“That’s enough, you don’t need to tell me. After all, you’re afraid of a rope for ten years once bitten by a snake.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

The three sighed because this might be the reason why their disciple betrayed them.

“There is something you might be mistaken about though.” Li Qiye said: “He taught a disciple not to pass down his legacy.”

“We know.” The pleasant voice said: “And if there’s an item involved, not just anyone could accept it, at least not this disciple.”

“What do you think his legacy item is?” Li Qiye asked.

“What’s your item then?” The deep voice answered with a question.

“You already know, the primordial tree, although it’s not quite a legacy item.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“Because no one else can bear it yet some still covet it.” The deep voice said.

“It’s a test of the heart. Those who can pass it do not need it for they will have their own legacy items.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It has all of your secrets.” The eye said: “So you wouldn’t pass it down anyway.”

“You could say that.” Li Qiye said: “It is the source of my secret and contains everything about me.”

“You’re not willing to pass it on?” The pleasant voice asked.

Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “I am me, a unique entity. If someone can inherit my legacy, then from my perspective, I am no longer me. You all understand this very well yet you still chose to find a successor, how interesting, it must be something alive.”

The three didn’t answer but their legacy items must be unimaginable while requiring them to look for a successor.

“Don’t look so serious, I’m just making conversation.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Have you thought that you’re just like him?” The pleasant voice said.

“No, if he has a legacy item, it’ll have something to do with the villainous heaven. Not me since I don’t care about being a replacement.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yet you won’t let go of your primordial tree.” The eye said.

“You haven’t thought about this matter clearly.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I’m afraid others who care about this have the wrong idea as well.”

He paused briefly before speaking seriously: “Yes, the tree contains many of my secrets but it is not mine.”

“Not yours?” The three were shocked to hear this.

“To be exact, I don’t intend to leave it for myself.” Li Qiye said.
