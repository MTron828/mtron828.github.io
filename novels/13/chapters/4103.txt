Chapter 4104: Entering

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The tiny rays flew towards the black maelstrom, looking like long threads. They spread out and began outlining the entire thing.

“Li Qiye!” Other spectators became startled.

“Why is he joining in?” They were puzzled at his involvement.

After all, he was an enemy of Armament Mountain and had killed members from there. He had no reason to help them right now.

In fact, others would kick a horse while it’s down. This was the best time to take down Armament Mountain and forever eliminate a problematic enemy.

However, his target was the maelstrom. This could only be interpreted as him aiding Armament Mountain.

“The guy is truly unpredictable.” A big shot commented. His peers agreed with him.

He was special since he dared to offend the behemoths without any hesitation. Now, no one else wanted to help Armament while he went against the tides. His actions had no logic to them.

Eventually, the tiny rays fully outlined the maelstrom.

At the start, powerful ancestors could only see the clouds and the maelstrom. But now, with Li Qiye’s rays, they saw a different image of an ancient beast.

It resembled several animals - a whale, serpent, gluttonous dragon. All in all, it possessed too many defining characteristics. When combined together, it was something never seen before.

“What is that?” The spectators became curious.

The image exuded a primal aura as if it was a real beast, not a painting made out of rays. Could this thing be hiding behind the maelstrom?

“This is the thing trying to destroy Armament?” Someone speculated.

“Where did it come from?” Another wondered.

Since this thing was powerful enough to render Armament helpless, it should be extremely famous. However, no one here had a clue.

“It has to be from a forbidden zone.” One more said.

People exchanged glances. They had a shallow understanding of the creatures in these forbidden zones. Only dao lords were privy to this type of information. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Buzz.” Space suddenly trembled as if some unknown power was activated.

The rays outlining the maelstrom suddenly came together to form a blinding radiance. It looked like a golden badge with complicated dao runes placed in a particular manner. The complexity of the runes couldn’t be deciphered by the spectators in a short time.

“Okay, time for me to get some exercise.” Li Qiye got up and stretched.

“I’m counting on you, Young Noble.” Yingxue bowed her head.

Li Qiye took one step forward and appeared right next to the black maelstrom.

“What is he doing?!” One spectator shouted.

“Is he about to take the maelstrom head-on?” Everyone started speculating.

Remember, even the intents left behind by two dao lords empowered by the foundation of Armament couldn’t defeat the maelstrom. No one thought Li Qiye had a chance.

They saw him touching the badge. His hand crossed through it as if it was a portal. He then disappeared from sight as if he was devoured by the maelstrom.

“Did you see that? Was he eaten?” A frightened soul asked.

“No, he entered the maelstrom.” His senior answered.

“In my opinion, the formation in the plain is somehow related to this black maelstrom. Li Qiye was able to connect with the maelstrom’s framework by using those rays. It’s not a reckless and unplanned endeavor.” One ancestor said.

“How many more secrets is this plain hiding?” Another asked.

By this point, they thought that the plain had an even stronger foundation than Armament Mountain.

“The Tang is an insignificant clan, how does it have so many resources?” Someone from the last generation asked.

“Don’t forget about their forefather, the inventor of the money fall method. It’s just that this art is lost with time.” One ancestor replied.

“Yes, that art is amazing but I don’t care how rich he used to be, a dao lord is still superior, and Armament had two.” The first speaker retorted.

No one had a response to this due to their respect for dao lords. Nonetheless, they were still in awe that this clan was showing its worth thanks to Li Qiye.

“So what’s in there?” One spectator asked.

“Who knows, maybe he’ll never be able to return.” Another would love to gloat about Li Qiye’s demise.

“That would be a shame, his wealth would be buried with him.” An expert said regarding the Preeminent Legacy.
