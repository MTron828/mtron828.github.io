“Boom!” Conqueror, Coiling Dragon, and Sword Sovereign punished the sky. Their attacks destroyed the stars and made the earth tremble.

Conqueror was being repeatedly pushed back by the combined effort of Coiling Dragon and Sword Sovereign. There was no doubt that he was at a disadvantage despite holding on.

“Brother Conqueror, you won’t be able to survive today without an ancestral treasure.” Coiling Dragon paced forward while using all eight treasures.

“It’s fine.” Conqueror was still all-smiles and casually responded in the face of danger, truly an admirable showing from him.

“I’m taking you down!” Sword Sovereign let his sword intent and dao roam free, showing zero mercy with one fatal slash after another.

On the other hand, Coiling Dragon didn’t wish to kill Conqueror just yet because he wanted to see the guy potentially taking out an ancestral treasure.

He had allies here and if such a thing were to happen, they would pay any price to seize it out of necessity. Possessing such a weapon would bolster their foundation and claim to the system.

“Rumble!” The fight maintained the same course with Conqueror on the back foot, injured. Nevertheless, he didn’t take out a stronger weapon.

Everyone could tell that in a one-on-one fight, Conqueror would definitely win against either of these two.

“Even if he isn’t a descendant, he should be closely related to Coiling Dragon Progenitor in some other ways. He had inherited some skills, this is enough to affect the Eight-armed Dynasty.” An ancestor murmured after seeing Conqueror using multiple arts from that system’s progenitor.

In fact, Coiling Dragon was both furious and jealous since his dynasty didn’t have any of them. Once Conqueror’s wings grew strong enough, it would be a great blow to the dynasty.

“Boom!” A combination attack finally blew Conqueror flying while vomiting blood.

Right when Conqueror lost his guard, a saber’s cold glint flashed. This saber intent appeared with the shade and flow of mercury.

This culminated in a blade appearing next to Conqueror’s neck. This ambush came too quickly, wanting to put an end to Conqueror.

Inches before death, Conqueror’s body became ethereal and extended almost like a shadow just like a dragon breaking the shackles of space.

“World-leaping Dragon!” Coiling dragon shouted after seeing this movement technique.

“Splush!” Despite the ability to leap through time, Conqueror didn’t fully evade the slash. It cut his chest and left behind a wound deep enough to see the bones. Blood stained the front of his robe.

Everyone gasped after seeing the deadly ambush. They looked over and saw a youth materializing in the air. He wore a long rube, quite tall in stature yet curved like a peeling knife. He looked cold and tough while emitting a dark saber energy - the appearance of a messenger from the underworld.

“Saber Devil Crown Prince!” Someone bellowed.

Upon hearing this title, another commented: “He’s here too? All three young nobles and the sword-saber duo are present today then.”

Of course, this was not counting the late Miracle.

“Sun Yichen!” Those who have fought against him before staggered backward with fear.

The crown prince of Heavenstart System, Sun Yichen, was famous alongside Sword Sovereign. He was different from his peers. Despite being from an official system, his conducts were more questionable in nature.

Coiling Dragon and Sword Sovereign always put up a good act regardless of what they have done in secrecy. This wasn’t the case for Saber Devil. He was morally ambiguous on top of being an assassin.

The other two have done so as well, but they would never let their identity be exposed during the act. Meanwhile, Saber Devil had just publicly tried to ambush Conqueror.

Thus, one couldn’t really treat him as a system successor. His style and ambushes instilled fear, hence his title.

“And here I thought it was someone else.” Conqueror laughed at Saber Devil instead of looking at his wound. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t blame me for this, someone else paid for your dog life.” The crown prince’s voice was both chilling and nefarious.

“The price must have been something. I guess I should be happy that my life is worth so much.” Conqueror nonchalantly said.

The truth was that many didn’t understand this crown prince at all. Heavenstart was already very powerful with a progenitor who eventually ascended to the imperial level. In Myriad, they were a first-rate system, albeit not on the same level as Vermillion. Someone with such a prestigious upbringing shouldn’t lack money. Alas, he became a saber for hire, confusing everyone else in the process.

Coiling Dragon’s group had an implicit understanding. He and Sword Sovereign attacked from the left and right, creating a massive flame wave.

“Earth-rending Dragon!” Conqueror crazily shouted and turned into a massive dragon. It tore apart the flame wave, suffering damages in the process.

Right at this second, another undetectable slash came from Saber Devil.

Though Conqueror was using his elusive movement technique, his back still got cut with blood gushing out. There was no doubt that Saber Devil’s techniques were more vicious and terrifying compared to the other two.

“Again!” Conqueror fearlessly rushed forward once more.

“Boom!” He collided with Coiling Dragon and Sword Sovereign but Saber Devil continued to loom in the background. Each ambush was a vicious and fatal slash.

“That crown prince is too cruel.” A big shot from the last generation shook his head and said.

In terms of cultivation, he wasn’t as strong as his current allies. However, these other two didn’t have the real legacies from their system and had few merit laws from the progenitors.

This wasn’t the case for him. He possessed the legacy of Heavenstart Saber Ancestor. Each slash contained this progenitor’s dao, boosting their effectiveness. His merit laws were superior to the other two. Conqueror could handle the other two for a while but once the crown prince joined the mix, more and more injuries added up.

“I don’t think Conqueror can last for much longer.” Everyone felt that his defeat was inevitable.
