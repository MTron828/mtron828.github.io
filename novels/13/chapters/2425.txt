The girl was unhappy to hear his comment and sharply glared at him once before lowering her head again. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Everyone knew that this hellion was a pervert with no qualms against harassing girls in broad daylight. She began to feel better about not being liked by him.

He touched another sword and said: “But at the very least, the crafting techniques came from masters.”

“Young Lord, you’re just playing with us now. We’re only a broken-down shop, our techniques are not exceptional at all.” Uncle Tie’s expression shifted before quickly replying.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye touched the blade and said: “If I’m not mistaken, this is the techniques of the Bingchi Clan, the orthodox style too.”

Both the girl and Uncle Tie were alarmed upon hearing this and glanced at each other.

Li Qiye didn’t watch their reaction and continued: “The techniques are authentic and traditional, but the execution lacks experience. Just more training and better materials will result in something decent, so the crafter has some talents.”

Jiadi himself was surprised, not expecting Li Qiye to understand the blacksmithing arts of the Bingchi.

Uncle Tie calmed down and said: “This lowly one doesn’t know what you are talking about, My Lord. I’ve never heard of the Bingchi. Our young miss has only learned our ancestral arts to survive.”

“So you’re telling me that your young miss is a descendant of Weaponbreak True Emperor.” Li Qiye smiled.

The other two were shaken for the second time and had to take a deep breath.

Jiadi also glanced at Li Qiye. Just looking at the weapons hanging on the walls wasn’t enough for him to discern the crafting technique. Keep in mind that as an Eternal, his vision far exceeded ordinary men.

Weaponbreak was the Bingchi’s best emperor, immortalized for his blacksmithing abilities. Few could match him in this field. Though he was only an emperor, the legends said that he could create weapons comparable to progenitors.

Due to his existence, the Bingchi made something of themselves and became one of the five behemoths in Nine Secrets.

“I have never heard of Weaponbreak True Emperor or the Bingchi.” The uncle denied again.

Li Qiye didn’t bother to turn back to look at him: “Keep on speaking rubbish and I’ll make her warm my bed.”

Uncle Tie didn’t dare to speak any longer while Li Qiye continued to look at the weapons.

Suddenly, footsteps came from the outside. A group appeared, wearing the same uniform with a golden sword insignia embroidered on the sleeve. They clearly came with unfriendly intention judging by their aggressiveness.

The leader was a youth brimming with vitality. His fierce eyes indicated that he wasn’t a pushover. The group instantly headed for the girl while kicking and shoving, resulting in weapons falling to the ground.

She and Uncle Tie naturally didn’t like this development.

“Long time no see, cousin.” The youth laughed and said to the girl.

She pursed her lips before coldly uttering: “I didn’t expect to see you here in Skywrap.”

“I just have some business in the imperial city, but the elders also gave me a task about the rent, so I have no choice but to come here.”

The girl sneered in response.

“Cousin, the date is approaching, I’m sure you have prepared, time to pay up.” He smiled.

“This place has always been our ancestral business.” The girl coldly responded.

“Cousin, that’s ancient history. After your family pawned it off, it belongs to the clan now. The fact that the clan is still willing to let you rent is already sentimental and considerable of your ancestors.” The youth retorted: “Keep in mind that personal feelings aside, this is a business. After all, if the clan is nice to everyone instead of being professionals, we will lose all orders. Without orders, the great clan will be lost in chaos.”

“Young Lord Cao, please wait for several more days, just a few more days, and the young miss will pay. We just don’t have it right now but we will get it to you as soon as possible.” Uncle Tie tried to smooth things over.

“Several more days?” The youth shook his head: “I don’t have that much time since I’m returning to the clan tomorrow. If I don’t get the payment, how am I going to answer to the seniors?”

“What do you want then?!” The girl angrily shouted.

“Cousin, all I’m doing is carrying out the clan’s official affairs. If you can’t pay up, then gather your stuff and get the hell out. The clan will be taking back this property so you can’t stay here any longer. We will not rent it to you either since you are the one violating the agreement.”

“Bingchi Gao, don’t be so unreasonable!” The girl yelled again.

The youth named Bingchi Cao shook his head: “Cousin, I’m not being unreasonable and cold right now since I’m following the rules. You should be happy that I’m the one here for this thankless task, anyone else wouldn’t be so nice to you right now.”

The girl turned pale. She naturally didn’t want to leave their ancestral heritage because they would never be able to get it back.

“Cousin, don’t make me force you out.” Gao smiled and said.

The girl clenched her fists while her chest heaved from anger. In the end, she took a composing breath and said: “Give me two days, just two days, and I’ll pay the rent to the clan.”

“No.” Gao shook his head: “Cousin, I’m in a hurry and will leave tomorrow, so I can’t give you the two days. In accordance with the clan’s rules, if a disciple were to fail his mission, there will be consequences. My future would be ruined.”

“I only need two days.” The girl’s voice grew weaker, on the verge of begging since she had no other choice.

“No.” He paused for a moment: “But, there is another way.”

“What is it?” The girl asked after hearing a glimmer of hope.

“One senior in the clan said that out of respect for the old ancestors, there is something you can pawn for this property. It will forever be yours.” Gao revealed.

“Pawn? What do you want?” The girl was stirred with excitement and said.

“Hmm...” Gao rubbed his chin and said: “The ancestor said that there is a page with techniques written on it. As long as you hand it over, this property will be yours. Moreover, the clan will be nice enough to even give you another one in the imperial city, you will never have to worry about money again.”

Uncle Tie and the girls took one step back. Her tone grew cold again: “I don’t know what you’re talking about, we don’t have anything like that. The seniors have handed everything over back then without hiding.”

“Then there’s no other way.” Gao snorted: “I’ll have to ask you to move then.”

The girl’s expression kept on changing from being helpless.

He shrugged and ordered: “If you don’t want to do it yourself... Men, help the young miss move now.”

“You dare?!” The girl cried out.

“Why wouldn’t I? Cousin, you are nothing now. Your branch had committed a terrible offense, the fact that the ancestors didn’t erase your names from the clan is out of respect for Weaponbreak True Emperor. Do you think anyone else in the clan will speak up for you now? I’m not kicking a man when he’s down, but your clan is already done for since a long time ago.” Gao sneered.

“Do it!” He raised his hand while she continued to stand there in a daze.

“This fly keeps on buzzing and ruining my mood.” Li Qiye who has been looking at the weapons suddenly turned around and said in a lackadaisical manner.

Gao and his disciples didn’t notice this guy standing in the room at all until now.
