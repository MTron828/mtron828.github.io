Chapter 4637: The Young Emperor’s Charisma

True Immortal Young Emperor has reached a point where he should be compared to ancestors, not the young generation.

As the chariot drew closer, his imperial aura only intensified despite his nonchalant attitude.

“He has the style of a dao lord already.” A spectator said.

The big shots also admitted that his future potential was boundless. They felt that despite their experience and glory, they couldn’t match him right now.

“The future dao lord…” A genius from a sacred ground mumbled.

Geniuses from great powers were prideful and rarely admitted inferiority. They had all the advantages possible and believed that they had the potential to be the best.

Alas, after seeing the young emperor in person today, they couldn’t help lowering their head and accepting inferiority. As for the women, they fell for his charm at first sight and loudly expressed their affection.

He was indeed a dragon among men. Spectators understood why a beauty such as True Immortal Saintess was willing to be his driver.

“Senior Brother.” The proud True Immortal Spirit immediately bowed after seeing him.

The young emperor nodded before turning his attention toward Xiao San. His lips then curved into a bright smile that immediately captivate female spectators.

“Senior Vajra, my junior brother has eyes but can’t see Mount Tai. Please take it easy on him.” The young emperor smiled; his words were as pleasant as the breezes of spring.

All eyes turned toward Xiao San right away.

“I know who he is now!” An ancestor blurted.

“Your vision is impeccable, my little trick can’t keep up.” Xiao San’s voice suddenly changed into that of an older man.

He then reverted into a tanned old man with a frightening aura.

“Untethered Vajra!” The crowd finally recognized him.

“Why is he here?” This became the main question.

“He’s too old for this, this is embarrassing.” One expert sneered.

“Untethered, are you an old bull trying to eat young grass? What are you doing up on stage?” Someone shouted at him.

Waves of laughter and jeers resounded but the old man only smiled in response.

Some found this strange because Vajra Untethered always had a good relationship with True Immortal. The former had helped them with many tasks before. Why did he come on stage and cause trouble for True Immortal Spirit?

“Is this an attempt at marrying the golden daughter and then seizing the treasure?” A last-gen cultivator laughed, thinking that it was an okay plan.

Ancestors couldn’t throw away their pride to join the competition. Nonetheless, if they couldn’t be caught, then they would certainly give it a shot.

“It’s not that easy to trick so many experts, especially when the young emperor is here.” A big shot shook his head: “Nonetheless, his transformation was impressive. Heavenly gazes didn’t work.”

“Senior Vajra, have some self-respect.” Mad Fist stared at the vajra and said implicatively. They were from the same generation.

“My apology, I merely wanted to witness True Immortal’s techniques.” Untethered Vajra walked down the stage, not appearing embarrassed at all.

The crowd thought that the thickness of his skin was second to none. Others might have worried about their reputation and ran away from embarrassment. However, Untethered Vajra was still sticking around.

“Gentlemen, please think about your sect’s reputation as well as your own.” Mad Fist then told everyone else, warning others to not try the same thing.

True Immortal Spirit still had plenty of strength left, he cupped his fist and said: “Anyone else wishes to spar?”

His confidence grew because his senior brother was here in person. Who would want to challenge him and a conqueror right now?

“Seems like True Immortal is serious about this. Who can take them on now?” One expert wondered.

“No one can stop the young emperor if he joins.” Another whispered in agreement.

“I will.” Godwhip Princess said with determination and a fierce glare. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“...” True Immortal Spirit’s predicament returned.

“Your Highness, your boldness is commendable.” The young emperor commented.

“You’re too kind.” She slightly bowed and then told True Immortal Spirit: “I am ready.”

True Immortal Spirit smiled wryly. It seemed that this fight was inevitable.

“Godwhip, return.” A dignified voice suddenly interrupted the battle.

Everyone looked up and saw a man floating in the air. He was older than the current participants, looking above thirty years of age.

He wore a simple robe without unnecessary decorations. He didn’t have a radiant and suffocating aura either. His eyes resembled the starry night sky. His features were sharp as if they were hand carved by a master.

His hands, in particular, were brimming with strength. He could actually grasp the cosmo with them. They were coarse and often seen in someone partaking in perpetual hard labor. Nonetheless, spectators were intimidated after seeing them.
