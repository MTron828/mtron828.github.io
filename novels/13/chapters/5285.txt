Chapter 5286: Remember Drinking Warmed Wine?

As they walked in this bright land, they eventually came across the tavern again. The smell of alcohol wafted in the air.

“There it is again!” Li Zhitian said. It has been around since the start and even showed up in the dreams. It must somehow be connected to their journey thus far.

Once they got closer, they actually saw a worker this time. He sat behind the bar and was a familiar face - the man who rowed the sand boat earlier.

“Pinch me, am I still dreaming?” Li Zhitian activated his heavenly gaze and saw that the man was real. After all, their first meeting was in a dream but now, the guy was outside in the real world.

“We aren’t in a dream.” The old servant shook his head.

Li Qiye sighed and gently gestured for the group to give him space before entering the tavern.

True Bear and the old servant waited outside; Li Zhitian did the same.

Li Qiye sat down in the middle and the man immediately came over to wipe his table clean.

“Bring me a pot of warm wine and a few side dishes.” Li Qiye ordered.

“Sure.” The man responded casually before leaving to prepare.

A while ago, customers just needed to order and the tavern would magically make it happen. Now, it became just like a normal restaurant with a worker.

The group would think that they were in a different place if it wasn’t for their identical appearance.

Just a moment later, the warmed wine and a few side dishes were brought to the table - a plate of stir-fried peanuts, well-seasoned fennel beans, and boiled edamame.

The man then returned to his seat, acting like a bartender just making enough money to get by.

Li Qiye sipped the wine and picked up some beans, arranging them on the table.

“Do you know how many methods there are to write the word fennel?” Li Qiye asked.

“I don’t know.” The man didn’t seem interested in this topic, preferring to slouch on the desk and replaced without enthusiasm.

Li Qiye finished forming a rune with the fennel beans on the table. He then picked up a peanut and crushed the shell before blowing the pieces onto the table. This caused the rune to come alive, constantly changing and evolving just like the grand dao.

The man looked up and stared at the rune before commenting: “Pretty neat...”

With that, he returned to his lazy state, seemingly wanting to have more customers. This caught Li Qiye off guard because this wasn’t part of their agreement. However, the man didn’t seem to be faking it.

“Why don’t you invite your friends in for a drink?” The man asked, only showing interest in making more money.

“They don’t need to.” Li Qiye remained calm and enjoyed his wine with the edamame.

“Remember drinking warm wine?” He eventually asked.

“I finish a pot every day.” The man stared at Li Qiye as if he was stupid.

“Why?” Li Qiye asked.

“Just because I want to, there’s no need for reasons and I have a whole cellar behind me.” The man said.

“Everyone has memories.” Li Qiye stared implicatively at him and continue: “Even a ghost has memories.”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Nothing to remember here.” The man thought that this guest was rather annoying. Just come and drink instead of blabbering.

“Tip.” Li Qiye smiled and placed a silver ingot on the table.

The man immediately got up and came over, looking excited: “Wait, I’ll get you a plate of stir-fried vegetables.”

“Clang, clang!” He went back inside and got busy with the wok.

“Sigh, I’m being bested by money, looks like I’ve thought too highly of myself.” Li Qiye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

It didn’t take long before the man brought a variety of dishes and an additional pot of warmed wine. He had a smile as he sat across from Li Qiye.

“I’ll have a drink with you.” The man put the silver ingot into his chest pocket.

No one hated the feeling of having more money. Since he was in a good mood, he didn’t find Li Qiye as annoying.

“Where are you from, Brother?” He asked.

“A rather distant place.” Li Qiye said.

“What are you doing here in this rundown place, I hardly see anyone all year round.” The man said.

“To find someone.” Li Qiye said while staring with a meaningful gaze.

“I’m afraid you won’t find anyone in this deserted place.” The man shook his head.
