Chapter 4783: Specter Monarch

True Immortal’s golden age happened after Blessed Dao Lord’s success. Worldraiser Dao Lord, the chosen successor, strangely had weak talent and cultivation. Moreover, he was up there in age as well.

He took over True Immortal, a post highly coveted by everyone else. In fact, putting external threats aside, numerous supreme existences and geniuses in True Immortal wanted his position.

After all, being the leader of True Immortal meant being the leader of Eight Desolaces. Although Blessed Dao Lord was an unparalleled symbol in True Immortal, the temptation of power was irresistible. This was especially true after Blessed Dao Lord left Eight Desolaces and the resulting successor seemed lacking.

Moreover, Blessed Dao Lord had numerous disciples, not just Worldraiser. The latter would have had zero success if it wasn’t for the direct appointment.

Thus, Worldraiser was put in a precarious situation with threats from all sides. Ultimately, he managed to overcome all of this on top of turning over a new leaf and becoming the next dao lord. True Immortal actually grew under his leadership.

When capable historians discussed this issue, they would attribute this to his personal abilities and another reason - Specter Monarch.

He was Wordraiser’s junior brother and a part of the ten supreme geniuses under his master. Of course, his senior brother was far inferior during the early days. The two weren’t on the same sphere.

Blessed Dao Lord had nothing but praise for Specter Monarch’s innate gift. Amusingly enough, Specter Monarch actually helped Worldraiser with cultivation despite being considerably younger.

In fact, everyone thought that he had the best chance of becoming the next successor. Later on, he became a main candidate to be a justified usurper.

On the contrary, he didn’t do any of that and supported Worldraiser instead, hence his well-known contribution to Worldraiser’s success.

His noble character earned him a unique status in True Immortal. Though future generations gradually forgot about him, a few ancient ancestors still remembered this pillar of the sect.

Some believed that as long as he was still alive, True Immortal would never fall. This might be an exaggeration but it did accurately reflect his prestige.

Now, those who knew him became surprised to see him here.

“Does True Immortal want to go against Li Qiye at all cost?” One of them whispered.

True Immortal was far removed from its peak but it was still formidable and could order the world. Alas, Li Qiye didn’t play the same game as everyone else.

Specter Monarch’s presence didn’t change anything so why did he come? Was he here to show how determined they were?

This confused and intrigued the crowd because True Immortal’s total defeat could change the landscape of Eight Desolaces.

“What can you accomplish here?” Li Qiye glanced at him and said as if he could crush the guy without any problem at all.

“I haven’t seen someone as strong as you since my master.” Specter Monarch said with admiration instead of anger.

Everyone knew who “master” was referring to - Blessed Dao Lord, one of the candidates to be the greatest dao lord of all time.

They have witnessed Li Qiye’s power in person but not Blessed Dao Lord. From this, one could imagine how terrifying Blessed Dao Lord used to be as well.

“Just because you haven’t seen one doesn’t mean that they’re not around. Dao Lord is only the beginning.” Li Qiye chuckled and instilled despair into everyone.

The so-called invincible realm was just the beginning? Alas, they couldn’t refute him.

Specter remained silent for a moment before nodding: “Indeed, I haven’t reached the true apex but the legends are right, we are mere ants.”

“Then why are you here?” Li Qiye asked.

Specter Monarch took a deep breath and stared at Li Qiye to say: “I am here to broaden my horizon and witness the number one cultivator in history.”

“That’s a nice way to put it.” Li Qiye said before focusing his eyes in another direction: “You’re not alone though.”

This surprised everyone. Was there someone else from True Immortal that is even stronger than Specter Monarch?

They became curious because he should be the strongest ancient ancestor there. Knowledgeable ancestors couldn’t come up with another person.

“Really?” Some listeners were confused.

However, there was someone standing in the direction of Li Qiye’s gaze. He posed there as if he has been there the entire time. It’s just that no one noticed him until Li Qiye said something.

The crowd assumed that he was in a hidden state, hence the lack of detection.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The guy didn’t seem surprised to be spotted by Li Qiye at all and had a calm expression.
