Chapter 4153: Too Much Money

“Begin!” Wandao Jian roared and activated the formation. Its light illuminated the region and turned into a boundless flame.

Spectators felt their true chaos energy along with the external source being sealed by this formation with haste.

Even the energy buried deep down in the earth vein stopped resonating with them. The formation acted as an unbreakable lock. Once sealed, no energy source could escape regardless of their distant location.

“We’re sealed!” Many spectators instantly ran from the radius of the formation.

After all, having their energy sealed meant becoming helpless like fish on the chopping board.

Unfortunately, the weaker spectators were already sealed and couldn’t get away in time.

“I can’t move… Sh*t!” A youth turned pale and screamed in horror.

Alas, those affected couldn’t say anything to Wandao Jian. They naturally disliked being dragged into this mess since they were only here to watch. The problem was that why would they risk offending Wandao Jian and Sea Emperor by speaking up? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Clank!” The scion’s sword brimmed with power. An abyss began taking over the sky.

While watching this sword dao, spectators felt like they were rabbits standing before the monstrous beasts, on the verge of being utterly devoured.

This insane dao caused the world to sink downward. Once trapped in this sword dao, the victims would never see the sunlight again.

“So this is the Abyss Sword Dao.” Someone said, realizing that not only cultivators but the myriad dao would be devoured too.

Previously, the scion had used this dao before during his fight with Ning Zhu. However, the appearance of the abyss still frightened the crowd every time.

“That’s a heavenly sword dao for you, definitely stronger than a dao lord sword art.” One expert became envious.

“Few lineages have one heavenly sword dao yet Sea Emperor has two. That’s why it’s the number one sect.” Even last-gen experts felt the same envy.

For virtually everyone, just being able to learn a dao lord sword art was enough for a lifetime. They wouldn’t ask for anything more.

However, heavenly sword dao was even one level above. Therefore, jealousy and envy permeated in the air because the young scion was lucky enough to learn it on top of having a dao lord sword.

“Today will be your last day in this world.” The scion pointed his sword at Li Qiye. Though he hasn’t attacked, rays of energy still pulsed intimidatingly.

“It’s too early to draw conclusions.” Li Qiye smiled and took out a spatial pouch.

Spectators became blinded the moment he opened it. “Buzz.” Bright beams from the purest refined jades stole their attention and incited their greed.

The pouch was filled with refined jades. Heavenly Sovereign jades were abandoned in the corner, the real focus was the dao lord-level ones - too many to count.

“Fuck, I want to be a rich young master like Li Qiye.” A last-gen cultivator salivated and cursed.

The experienced ancestors saw the flashing lights and started talking among themselves.

“Yeah, I wouldn’t mind being him with nothing else going on except money. I would love to hear people telling me how useless I am and that having dirty money is meaningless.” One of them said.

A big shot might not be tempted by one thousand or even a million dao lord refined jades. But what about one billion?

The scion and his allies became serious, trying to contain their greed. They had seen enough wealth due to their background. Alas, what they saw before was inconsequential compared to Li Qiye’s treasury.

Important characters like them didn’t have so much while Li Qiye alone monopolized it. They exchanged glances and became more determined to kill Li Qiye.

“Let’s go now.” Li Qiye suddenly grabbed a bunch and tossed them forward.

He kept on doing this as if he was tired of having money. Thousands of refined jades fell into the lake.

“Is he crazy?” Spectators were astounded.

For ordinary cultivators, a single refined jade at the dao lord level was priceless - enough to let him live lavishly for a lifetime.

Right now, Li Qiye was tossing so many into the lake as if they were worthless pebbles. This simply didn’t make any sense.

Some calmed down and were smart enough to dive into the water for those refined jades.

However, they quickly swam back up and got their head out of the water while shouting: “There’s nothing down there!”

The lake wasn’t dangerous for cultivators so they should have been able to see the refined jades. Alas, this wasn’t the case.
