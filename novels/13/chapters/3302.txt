The runes from the pillar of life circled around the dao bone. As one of the four symbols in the fate palace, it had a unique usage. Of course, the others had their own responsibilities.

The pillar was responsible for controlling the mysteries of the dao along with various merit laws.

Thus, cultivators would start by using the pillar while searching the dao.

Most disciples have started this process. Only a few were still searching for a suitable dao bone. After all, picking the right dao bone was crucial for this trial. The wrong one meant failure regardless of their talents and power.

“Why aren’t there any sky-level dao bones?” One disciple noticed that the best bones were at the earth level. Only a few were around.

“Of course our sect has sky-level dao bones, they’re just not here because they’re too precious, especially the high-level ones. You can’t leave them around in this place.” An older peer explained.

Divine Black really had the top-level dao bones, but who knows exactly how many?

The older disciple was right too. A sky-level dao bone was priceless because it represented a peerless merit law. There was no way Divine Black would leave it unguarded.

Moreover, no disciples during these trials could understand them in the first place. Just the earth-level ones were tough enough. The high-level ones were virtually impossible.

Only a few here could pick an earth dao bone. For example, Gong Qianyue and the older seniors, the top members of their peaks.

Huang Ning looked around for a while before settling for a low-level earth dao bone. Ultimately, he wouldn’t have too much trouble finding a powerful merit law since he was a valued member of Thousand Demons.

Comprehending these bones wasn’t easy. Picking the wrong one could result in failing the trial so he chose to play it safe.

This was the right move. Those similar to him in terms of abilities also picked low-level earth dao bones in order to get through the trial.

Qianyue, on the other hand, picked a high-level earth bone. It looked like a piece of white metal that hasn’t been polished. One could hear metallic ringing inside as if things were colliding. Listening to this sound for a while would result in dizziness. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“That’s the dao bone of a Swordcry Devil Phoenix. It’s the best one here.” The oldest elder present said: “It has been here for a long time now, still unactivated for a few generations.”

He paused for a bit then said: “It’s unfavorable to pick this one.”

Everyone could see that in order to guarantee success in this trial, picking a low-level one was wiser.

“No, this one will do.” Alas, Qianyue was up for the challenge.

Some felt respect because she chose the hardest one. She was probably the only one in the sect capable of this.

The elders didn’t stop her because they were also curious to see the limit of her talents.

As for Li Qiye, he wasn’t in a hurry. He walked around and took a look at the bones. This didn’t resemble a man searching for the right dao bone but rather, a guy walking down a street full of street stalls. He wouldn’t buy anything in the end.

“What’s the point of looking around? There’s nothing lower than a low-level yellow bone.” One disciple sneered.

“If you can’t even get that, how are you going to derive ten bones?” Another jumped in.

“What’s the hurry?” Li Qiye kept on walking around. After one circle, he finally stopped and stared at an ashen dao bone the size of a palm. It had a few cracks from unknown sources.

It looked more like a worthless random bone that had been incinerated, not an important dao bone. The only thing that proved it was a dao bone was the fact that it was stored here.

“Where is this from?” Li Qiye asked.

The elders finally took note of it. In the past, these examiners never gave a damn.

“We can’t remember since there are too many dao bones here. We would have to look at the records.” An elder shook his head.

“Hmm, I actually remember this one.” The oldest elder smiled: “A disciple found it in the forsaken land and offered it to the sect in exchange for a high-level yellow merit law. This child, a little greedy. We examined and determined that it was useless. However, since he traveled ten million miles far to reach that place, we gave him a pill as the reward.” [1]

“Forsaken land.” Li Qiye slightly raised his brow, aware of this location.

He had a different evaluation of this dao bone than the others.

“A useless bone? Then that’s perfect for you. You should be able to understand it then. The son of miracles might be able to get something miraculous out of it.” The ones nearby started laughing.

“Maybe it was solely created for you.” Another jeered.

Li Qiye ignored them and got closer. He placed his palm on it and closed his eyes.

“Dao bone comprehension isn’t done by touching it. Use your pillar of life.” An elder shook his head.

Alas, his advice fell on deaf ears. Li Qiye continued doing his thing.

“He won’t even use his pillar of life?” Other disciples stared at the guy immersed in feeling the bone.

Even a new recruit knew how to search for the dao using the pillar of life.

“Haha, it’s not his fault. Have you ever seen him at a lesson? No, and he’s not smart enough to figure things out on his own...”

“Shut up!” Gong Qianyue suddenly shouted and released immense pressure.

The jeering crowd immediately shut up. In their mind, they couldn’t wait until Li Qiye failed and had to bark like a dog.

The place became quiet after her reprimand. The disciples focused on the trial instead.

Some found success as the dao bones reacted to their dao runes stemming from the pillar.

“Buzz.” One dao bone shook and exuded power.

“Buzz.” A more powerful disciple managed to make his bone release holy strands of light.

“I’m doing it, I’m doing it!” One disciple became excited since this was his first time.

The ones who were still in the middle of the process became envious. They focused up and kept trying.

“Buzz.” Huang Ning’s dao bone lit up. Runes appeared along with a power resembling an awakening beast.
