Chapter 4315: Carp Climbing The Dragon Gate

While those from Little Diamond were gazing at the broken peaks and talking about old legends, others started clamoring about someone arriving.

“What is happening?” They became curious and turned around.

They saw a rather diverse group approaching closer, consisting of both sexes, humans, and demons…

They looked rather exceptional. One youth stood out like a crane among a flock of chickens. He wore a blue robe and was tall and handsome. However, his expression looked rather fierce instead of friendly.

“That’s Gao Qixin.” The crowd talked among themselves.

“Long time no see, Young Noble Gao.” Many came forward to greet him.

“Young Noble Gao, it’s been a while since our meeting in Green Water, you’ve improved again.” Even older cultivators wanted to please him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“When are you visiting our Cloud Fortress? My daughter has been eagerly waiting.” A relatively well-known cultivator hinted.

“Who is that, why is he so popular?” A Little Diamond member wondered.

“He is from Maple Ravine. But hmm, that alone shouldn’t warrant this level of flattery.” Wang Weiqiao recognized him.

“Right.” Elder Hu was a sociable man with ample knowledge: “He’s a genius from Maple Ravine. This sect isn’t impressive in the grand scheme of things but he’s definitely somebody in our region. So young yet is already an enlightened being. His future is bright.”

“An enlightened being, I see.” The youths were startled because Elder Hu was only in the samadhi realm.

It seemed that this genius should have no problem reaching the yin yang realm or even the myriad-form realm. [1]

“That’s still not enough to warrant this.” Weiqiao shook his head.

After all, Gao Qixin wasn’t that strong right now. There was potential but this was not enough for older cultivators to flatter him.

Elders and sect masters cared about their image and reputation, always acting accordingly in public. Though they were from minor sects, they shouldn’t be flattering a junior. Alas, it was happening right now.

“It’s because he has a chance of joining Dragon or Lion’s Roar.” Elder Hu explained: “They might take him in as an external disciple.”

“!!!” The youths became emotional. This was akin to a carp turning into a dragon even though it was only an external spot. One’s reputation would increase a hundredfold overnight.

“I’ve heard that the notion is there.” Elder Hu went on: “His talent is exceptional and his sect master has been asking for a lot of favors. There’s a good chance of him joining Dragon Sect.”

The young ones exchanged glances again and thought about a particular character - Deer King, the uncle of Du Weiwu.

“Deer King was a minor character just like us once. He eventually joined Dragon and became an expert. If Gao Qixin can do the same, his achievement should be even higher.”

Given his potential, perhaps he would become a regional lord in Southern Desolace. This was the reason why many threw away their face to flatter him, hoping to build a relationship.

“So the conference is his chance to join?” One disciple asked.

“Yes, if it’s an actual thing, it’ll happen here. The conference is a recruitment opportunity for the behemoths.” Elder Hu nodded.

Despite the conference’s faltering significance, Dragon and Lion’s Roar still sent experts here to recruit decent prospects and to assign duties to smaller sects.

These duties didn’t give them actual authority. Nonetheless, carrying them out properly could earn them the good grace of the behemoths.

“If the opportunity arises, think about joining as well.” Elder Hu encouraged the youths. Little Diamond could benefit from this just like all the other sects.

The young ones actually shrugged and didn’t care too much. They never thought about joining a different sect before. Staying in Little Diamond was just fine.

“We don’t have the talent.” One of them responded.

“In my opinion, our sect master has the best chance.” Another stared at Li Qiye, prompting Elder Hu to do the same.

For the young generation of Little Diamond, Li Qiye did have the best chance of joining Dragon or Lion’s Roar.

Though they didn’t know his exact cultivation, they absolutely believed that he was the most gifted in Little Diamond.

“No, we’ll lose our sect master then.” Someone else protested. Li Qiye has been rather popular ever since assuming the post.

“We should be happy for him and take pride in it, it’s definitely a promotion.” Elder Hu sighed but would still want Li Qiye to go.

He thought that Little Diamond would prosper under Li Qiye’s guidance. Nonetheless, he thought that Li Qiye could achieve great things by joining the behemoths. Perhaps he could stand at the apex later on and Little Diamond would have an amazing story to tell.

“Not interested.” Li Qiye withdrew his gaze from the broken peaks and smiled, finally joining the conversation: “Come, we’re going to Myriad Sect Ward.”

“Very well, we need to enter now or there will be no more spots.” Elder Hu regained his wits and immediately followed.

He warned the youths: “Don’t do anything silly after we enter. Watch your words because members from Dragon are presiding over the conference. If something happens, I’m not sure you’ll be able to keep your head, understand?”

“We understand.” They respectfully responded.

The ward was built by the great powers, serving as a place for guests to stay. Their disciples were responsible for its operation.

Though they didn’t have an elder or an ancestor in charge of this conference, certain powerful disciples were still here.
