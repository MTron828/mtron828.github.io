Chapter 4702: Dao Discussion

“Drinking with you is a rare occasion.” The young emperor smiled and told fellow disciples to bring tea for him as well.

“Wonderful, True Immortal’s resource is enviable indeed.” Shen Juntian took a sip and also praised.

“It cannot compare with the tribute teas for a dao lord.” The emperor said.

This was indeed the truth. The son of a dao lord must have seen plenty of wondrous things before, having access to the most coveted treasures since youth.

Some immortal teas were highly inaccessible. Brilliant cultivators such as Heavenly Sovereigns could toil for a lifetime to get a single bottle only to fail.

This didn’t apply to Shen Juntian. He probably grew up drinking this type of liquid as if they were water, no big deal at all.

Of course, this didn’t mean that the young emperor was subservient to him. He also grew up in the perfect scenario, speaking to Shen Juntian as an equal. His childhood was likely on the same level.

Therefore, Five-sun King might have the worst upbringing relatively. Of course, the guy didn’t mind this at all and never felt inferior.

“I’m sure we’re not here to drink tea alone.” Shen Juntian got straight to the point. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“It has been a while since our last meeting so I prepared some tea. Let’s drink and have a discussion regarding the world and the grand dao, yes?” The emperor smiled.

“Discussing the dao with you would be my pleasure.” Five-sun King smiled: “But if you have any other matter, feel free to bring it up.”

The emperor stared at the two for a second before asking: “Brothers, who do you think, among us three, is most likely to become the next dao lord?”

The answer to this question naturally intrigued the other two.

“I would like to know your opinion on this.” FIve-sun King answered with a question.

All three of them have been toiling for a single goal - proving their dao. In fact, this path has been decided for them since their very birth.

“In terms of innate talent, I beat the both of you, Brothers.” The emperor was direct.

The lack of humility normally offended others. This wasn’t the case because the emperor had a primal fate palace. This rendered him superior to the other two. Since the answer was obvious, being humble here would have the opposite effect.

“A primal palace is rare even in the long trek of history.” Shen Juntian admitted: “Not to mention someone like myself, how many dao lords possessed this innate talent?”

Five-sun King nodded and agreed: “I have seen your palace before and was left in awe. My mystic true fate pales in comparison while my bloodline is thin.”

He had a mystic true fate and the bloodline of a heavenly eagle. However, the true fate was inferior to the emperor’s fate palace whils his bloodline was far from pure.

“But, I do admit inferiority in terms of appearance and aura to you, Brother.” The emperor told Shen Juntian.

He simply spoke the truth and wasn’t affected by this at all. In reality, everyone felt the same way while standing in front of Shen Juntian. His appearance and temperament were out of this world, looking just like an immortal. A supreme beauty might still feel inadequate in his presence.

“As for you, Brother Five-sun, I do not have your charisma and charm.” The emperor continued: “You are capable of recruiting everyone in the world, not minding certain things. As for me, I hold prejudices.”

“You’re too kind.” Five-sun King smiled while shaking his head.

“It is true, if we were to switch spots at birth, I would not have the same success as you who are supported by the sects of the east. This must have been difficult, requiring both determination and at times, enduring humiliation. I am too prideful and hot-headed for that.” The emperor elaborated.

He was born as a member of True Immortal and immediately became its jewel. Though Shen Juntian’s background was slightly more impressive, the young emperor certainly couldn’t complain in this regard.

Five-sun King didn’t have the same luck. Five-sun School was only a great power. As the son of its sect master, his starting point was higher compared to the average cultivator but still trivial compared to his rivals’.

Therefore, one could only imagine his sacrifices and patience to get where he is today. He earned everything through blood and sweat, one step at a time. His life included more bitterness than the other two could ever know.

“We’re not here to flatter each other or to tell life stories, right?” Shen Juntian smiled.

The other two were in awe of his beautiful smile, feeling envious without being jealous. Some might hate others for being more attractive. However, Juntian also possessed an innate quality that prevented others from hating him.

“The competition has started, so if you would like, let’s discuss the future.” The emperor said.

“A fight is inevitable between us. Let fate determines the victor.” Shen Juntian replied.

“Brother, you know fate has nothing to do with this and all of the previous competitions.” The emperor smiled.

“Not just the three of us, the other two are also unique in their own way. It’s hard to predict a winner right now.” Five-sun King interjected.

“I agree with you, Brother Five-sun.” The emperor nodded: “Though Mortal King and Brother Tian Feng aren’t here, we are indeed unique so it’s too early to determine the last person smiling. There are too many uncertainties on this path.”

“There is one thing we are sure of. None of us can beat Li Qiye.” Shen Juntian said.

“...” The young emperor and Five-sun King paused for a moment.

“Who among us could have beaten Tian Feng bare-handed? I know I couldn’t without the help of a dao lord weapon. A mad frog’s physique is insane and given his nature, he’ll keep on fighting until I am drained of energy. Therefore, fighting bare-handed against him is hopeless, at least for me.” Shen Juntian revealed.

Keep in mind that Shen Juntian had a special bond with his dao lord weapon, capable of reducing the strongest foe to ashes. On the contrary, fighting bare-handed would greatly diminish his prowess.

“I couldn’t have won either.” Five-sun King said. He had sparred with Tian Feng before and experienced that freakish tenacity.
