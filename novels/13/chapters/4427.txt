Chapter 4428: Stomp

FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Clank!” A boundless sword intent could be felt even though he didn’t summon a sword. It took the form of numerous divine rays spreading outward, seemingly sealing heaven and earth.

He hovered in the air like the lord of the swords. Just one hand wave could release a torrent of sharpness capable of obliterating everything.

Spectators found themselves insignificant like specks of dust. Not to mention an actual slash, just the remnant sword intent could take them down.

“Just like a heaven’s favorite.” A commenter stated while not daring to look straight at the monarch.

Most understood why Five-sun King took Dragon so seriously. Peacock Monarch was weaker than ancient ancestors such as the three demons present. However, he still had untapped potential and could become a cultivator comparable to a dao lord.

“Clank!” A metallic hymn could be heard.

“You will not act wantonly in my presence!” His dignified voice echoed across the region and intimidated the listeners.

“Fine, I’ll let you accompany your son down on the yellow river.” Li Qiye smiled.

This line made Peacock Monarch’s anger go out of control. A while ago, he endured because the sect was more important than his personal vendetta. Alas, these words pricked his heart since his only son was killed by Li Qiye.

“Li, don’t think about leaving Dragon alive today, I will flay your skin and cut off your head to show the world the might of Dragon! We will take you down today to appease my son’s spirit up above!”

“Oh? Bringing all of Dragon into this as well?” Li Qiye chuckled.

Peacock Monarch lost his cool and shouted: “We will pay any price to kill you today! We’ll also destroy your sect, clans, and all of your descendants…”

He could no longer keep his cool and confident demeanor in public. This was unbecoming of a sect master but unfortunately, the only thing on his mind was killing Li Qiye.

However, he couldn’t finish his threat before a large foot came straight for him from above. It carried absolute suppression and astounded the crowd. They were immediately forced to the ground, unable to get up.

Resistance was utterly futile; waiting to be reduced to mincemeat was the only path.

“What the hell?!” Some screamed while feeling despair. Their merit laws and treasures were no longer effective.

“Activate!” Peacock Monarch felt the incoming danger and sent heavenly rays upward. They pierced the sky vault and intended on stopping the foot.

Alas, this was still far from enough. The foot destroyed the heavenly swords and continued downward.

He panicked and performed several merit laws. Runes filled up the airspace above him and carried the immensity of the earth. His impressive grand dao was still crushed by the foot.

It didn’t stop until it stomped on his back and forced him down to the ground.

“Ugh…” He spat out a mouthful of blood and suffered grievous injuries.

“Up…” He became radiant one more time and mustered all of his energy to lift the foot off him.

The master of the foot simply added a bit more strength and fully immobilized the monarch.

This sudden development caught everyone off guard, especially the members of Dragon. They all witnessed the monarch’s power just now. He was absolutely a top cultivator capable of sweeping through the world. Yet, that foot still crushed him as if he was a mere insect.

Once people calmed down and looked up, they noticed that someone else was present. Initially, they thought that the foot was Li Qiye’s technique.

This newcomer was unknown to them. He wore a royal robe that was meticulously tailored. Each thread was embroidered to perfection - a sign of its value.

He had fair skin, starry eyes, and sharp brows - a truly handsome man that clearly came from nobility.

They were also shocked to see how young he was. It was one thing for an ancient being to defeat Peacock Monarch. However, this person looked so young…

“Wh-who is he?” They were frightened. Just Li Qiye’s devilish abilities alone were dreadful enough. Now, there was another mysterious youth?

“Forefather…” The three ancient demons immediately bowed after seeing him

“Forefather?” The members of Dragon became confused. Nonetheless, they also got on their knees.

They had no idea who he was but since their ancient ancestors addressed him as “forefather”, the guy’s status was rather obvious.
