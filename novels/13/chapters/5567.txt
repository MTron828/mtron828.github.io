Chapter 5568: My Son, Wang Teng

The news of an immortal weapon hidden in Momentous Frontier traveled far and wide, no longer restricted to Dao Domain. Top cultivators from Dao City heard of it as well, the same for Celestial Court.

Most cultivators came to watch the show and broaden their horizons. After all, many powerful cultivators have arrived so this was beyond their ability.

Moreover, the deities made it difficult. Just one was virtually unbeatable, let alone messing around in Momentous Frontier and risking all of their wrath. Everyone kept this in mind and acted properly while visiting the region.

A few emperors and monarchs were actually friends with the deities for a long time now and refrained from being pompous.

Of course, there were always exceptions - some dao lords and conquerors who didn’t bother hiding their aura. Some sects also did the same, entering with no regard for the mortals.

All in all, various scenes popped up in the frontier due to their arrival.

Ripples manifested in the sky before spreading into the image of a lake. This only lasted for a few seconds.

“Someone from Jadesword Pool.” Cultivators recognized this visual phenomenon.

“I wonder if Jadesword Conqueror is coming.” Another didn’t sense a sword energy from that area and said with uncertainty.

“Buzz.” Golden strands appeared and were woven together to form great loops. They blotted out the sky for a moment before disappearing.

“That’s from Timeworn Manor, I wonder which elders will show up.” The crowd couldn’t see how many loops there were in total. Nonetheless, this was the symbol of Timeworn Manor.

“Boom!” In another area, the sky was torn apart due to the appearance of a majestic portal. Several figures descended and entered Momentous Frontier.

“So flashy.” A cultivator commented after seeing the big shots.

“The Skysplitters, a rather prestigious clan.” Most retreated away from the portal.

Skysplitter Clan had ample prestige and power in Dao Domain, hence their arrogant entrance. Of course, they only made a show outside of Momentous Frontier. These big shots hid their auras after entering the region.

“Rumble!” A golden chariot left a golden trail in its path along with loud explosions. Laws of a conqueror were carved into the exterior, pulsing downward like waterfalls.

It carried a middle-aged man in a golden robe, looking like a king deserving of reverence from all living beings.

A galaxy appeared around him, albeit a chaotic one. There was no order to the celestials; looking at this image disoriented spectators.

His imperial aura poured down and suppressed everyone beneath. Mortals and animals became paralyzed on the ground.

“Turmoil Conqueror!” Many recognized the owner of the golden chariot.

“It’s a sign of insecurity and composure compared to Skysplitter Conqueror who is keeping a low profile.” Someone said with a hushed tone.

“Shh, watch your mouth. Skysplitter is strong right now but there is a considerable gap between them and Imperial West Bank.” A senior chastised.

“One conqueror is here, they seem to want the imperial weapon. How many conquerors and dragon lords will show up, I wonder?” The junior talked.

Everyone held their tongue when it came to Imperial West Bank. It became the strongest faction after the closing of Immortal Dao City. This could be construed in two ways - that it could take over Dao City completely or serve as a benevolent protector.

Its history ran deep in the river of time. What started as a small country became a powerful clan through a marriage alliance with another clan from the heaven race.

Its power increased while its in-laws faltered later on. Its golden age was heralded by a supreme genius who took over the heaven clan - West Bank Prime Emperor.

He was the first Grand Emperor of the clan and led them to prosperity, adding the word “imperial” to its title. Today, Imperial West Bank had a total of six conquerors, twenty-four dragon lords, and nine legions.

It contributed meritoriously to Dao Domain by stopping an army from Celestial Court led by eight emperors. With that, it fortified its position as the number one clan of Dao City.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Everyone could sense the clan’s intent on obtaining the immortal weapon. It was better to back off.

Turmoil Conqueror had five dao fruits, the weakest conqueror of the clan. Nonetheless, this was far from being shameful since how many could actually reach this realm?

For Turmoil himself, his greatest achievement was not becoming a conqueror but rather, birthing his son - Wang Teng.

A particular proclamation from him during a proud moment echoed around the world - my son possesses the same disposition as Supreme.

Normally, conquerors were considered to be greater than dragon lords. Thus, it seemed out of place for a conqueror to be viewing a dragon lord in high regard.

Of course, Supreme was an exception - a dragon lord capable of catching up to Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor.

He believed that his son had the potential to become a second Supreme - a magnificent cultivator and leader.
