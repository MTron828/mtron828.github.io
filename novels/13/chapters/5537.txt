Chapter 5538: Finally Back

Momentous Frontier was one of the most flourishing areas in Dao Domain, albeit not cultivation-related.

It hasn’t produced a top master in a long time. In fact, capable and ambitious geniuses had no choice but to depart their home.

An abundance of mortals made up for the lack of cultivators. Mortal towns and cities could be seen everywhere instead of sects and factions.

It’s rare to see cultivators flying around or any divine auras associated with cultivation. Only shrines could be seen on the outskirts of villages and towns, perhaps a larger temple in a main city.

Mortals didn’t need to cultivate, only wanting to occasionally burn incense at the shrines to pay respect to the deities. They hoped for good weather, livestock health, and family happiness.

They didn’t worship powerful cultivators such as emperors and monarchs capable of burning the sky and ending an ocean.

They had special gods and deities whom they believed could listen to their prayers. With ample offerings, the land was blessed with great weather and no natural disasters - a perfect place for mortals to live.

“Pop!” When Li Qiye’s group entered the frontier, they felt as if they had just crossed through a barrier to another world.

The smoke of the mortal realm immediately greeted them - something different from the majestic life force usually found in cultivation kingdoms and sects.

This presence had an overwhelming amount of seven emotions and six desires. The smells of great food invited them to leave the cultivation world.

“Momentous indeed.” Li Qiye commented.

“It’s incredible.” Niu Fen said: “Immortal Emperor Yu Shou, Daoflame Dual Lords, Immortal Emperor Di Yu, Space Dragon Emperor, and many more had an ambitious goal of building a home for everyone. They refined this land and created a surrounding momentum.”

“Senior, you know the history quite well.” Baifeng was surprised.

“This tale has been passed down for a while now. It’s a shame that when I came, they had already finished the great work of art. Their intention was benevolent and grand.” Niu Fen said.

Rumor has it that Immortal Emperor Di Yu and Daoflame Dual Lords launched a proposal to build a region different from the rest of Dao Domain.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The list started with Immortal Emperor Yu Shou, Bones Dao Lord, Immortal Emperor Bu Si, Space Dragon Emperor, Ox-dragon Ancestor, and many more.

They researched a particular tablet and created a dao momentum and frontier. They then became its deities, the foundation of this land.

The focus was to provide shelter for the common people from all over the world. Those who eventually became strong enough could join the momentum in a process known as attunement.

However, those with a more ambitious soul who wanted to grow stronger and see the world had no choice but to leave Momentous Frontier in search of their own dao. They had no desire to become deities who receive offerings and grant wishes.

This created a scenario where the region was perfect for mortals, not cultivators. In their absence, a lack of competition and deadly wars on top of ample resources allowed mortals to thrive.

They always maintained neutrality as well, not participating in outside conflicts. Because of this, powerful cultivators from the other regions rarely visited Momentous Frontier.

“Impressive, a grand aspiration. I hope that they will be able to uphold this mindset.” Li Qiye nodded.

“It’s a very interesting place.” Niu Fen said: “Well, it’s a little too boring for me, I can see others wanting to settle down and experience an ordinary mortal life.”

“Yeah, it’s not right for you.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Even sects with a bit of strength can’t stay here, let alone dao lords or conquerors.” Niu Fen agreed.

Niu Fen and those on the same level weren’t interested in staying here. They considered it a shallow pond - not worth their time or a trip. This was akin to a giant looking down at an ant hill.

Nonetheless, this was a good thing in that sects on the verge of downfall could move here to survive. The Qin of Heavensearch was one example.

They became too weak to survive in the outside world. Now, the only goal was to maintain their lineage.

Qin Baifeng was a member blessed with enough innate talent to move on. She had no other choice if she wanted to improve her cultivation.

“Finally back.” She said sentimentally.

Despite being a pond unable to accommodate a true dragon, its serenity often called out to weary cultivators.
