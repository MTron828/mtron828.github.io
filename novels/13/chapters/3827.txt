Chapter 3828: Start Of The Journey

The old man and Dugu Lan were disappointed due to Li Qiye’s refusal to bring her along. After all, she would have definitely learned many things along the way.

Of course, most would view Dugu Lan as a supreme genius - the only youth capable of contending against Righteous Scion.

The ancestors thought that she had boundless potential as well, destined to stand at the apex. Thus, she was a jewel in their eyes. Someone like her being a maid would be unfathomable.

The duo present disagreed. The old man, in particular, thought that it would be an honor for her to follow Li Qiye - the opportunity of a lifetime. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I have nothing to teach you, you’re excellent enough already and have done an incredible job learning Trinity Sword Art. Reaching apogee is only a matter of time.” Li Qiye stared at the two and replied.

“Please steer me from mistakes, Young Master.” Dugu Lan smartly asked for guidance, knowing that a chance like this wouldn’t present itself again.

“You’re doing great but if I must point a single thing out, refrain from distinguishing between the light and darkness.” Li Qiye smilingly said.

“This is indeed something I think about, please elaborate, Young Master.” She said.

Trinity was a unique sword art since it consisted of light and darkness. The first two variations were completely different from each other.

Thus, the polar opposites made it difficult for her during training. Her talents and indomitable spirit eventually birthed success, allowing her to utilize this powerful technique effectively.

Nonetheless, she still had questions and doubts regarding her usage of light and darkness.

“They have the same origin.” Li Qiye said: “From darkness there is light and there is light in darkness. This duality creates a majestic momentum and three thousand brilliant mortal realms. These realms are never separated from the two affinities, and that’s the focus of the third technique.”

“I see.” Dugu Lan’s impeccable comprehension allowed her to absorb his guidance.

The third move of Trinity, Myriad Men, summoned the power of the talented geniuses in the mortal realms.

It was different from the previous two since it encompassed both affinities. As for the first two moves, the affinity would absorb or destroy the other.

“Their reason for being is predicated on their twin’s existence.” Li Qiye concluded.

She became immersed in internal training. She suddenly felt much better about the sword art.

“Thank you, Young Master.” She bowed, having gained immense benefits from listening to a few lines from him.

He accepted her gesture and added: “Trinity Sword Art is certainly strong but do not indulge excessively in it. You need to focus on your own grand dao or you’ll never be able to leave the shadow of its creator, not that this should be a goal.”

She became emotional because he touched the biggest issue in her mind. Trinity was extremely strong but she knew that she had no chance of surpassing its creator.

The emperor who created this sword art was known as Prime and considered to be the greatest of them all.

In history, the brilliant emperors and invincible dao lords couldn’t compare to him. That’s why she had no chance of surpassing him regardless of her talents.

“Your grand dao is unique and effective, others would have a hard time reaching you...” He then focused on her grand dao.

Though this was only a casual session, she considered each of his words to be as precious as gold and jade. She earnestly memorized the content in order to ponder them later.

After he finished, she bowed and respectfully said: “I won’t forget your kindness, Young Master. If I can be of use in the future, just say the words and I will be your ox and horse.”

He only smiled in response.

“Young Master, I believe the changes in Black Tides imply immense danger. I don’t think you need to take this risk.” The old man pondered before speaking.

This was because of Li Qiye’s prestigious status. If anything were to happen to Li Qiye, it would be an unthinkable loss to the holy ground and its people.

“Black Tides can’t stop me from leaving. If it could, it would have started crawling instead of just laying there.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmm?” Dugu Lan found his comment astonishing.

Black Tides was the name of an ocean but Li Qiye was using verbs to describe it. Dugu Lan eventually asked: “Young Master, isn’t Black Tides an ocean? Is it... alive?”

The erudite old man felt the same way, thinking that Li Qiye’s choice of words was rather strange.

“Alive? Sure, but barely like a lamp running out of oil. It can’t amount to anything.” Li Qiye nonchalantly responded.

Though these two expected this answer, they still became shocked.

“So Black Tides is a living entity...” Dugu Lan murmured.

Most thought that this was only an ocean with black water. They would consider Li Qiye a madman for making this claim. How could a creature be so large?

“Please be careful, Young Master.” The old man repeated, hoping for Li Qiye’s wellbeing.

“Don’t worry, I know what to do.” Li Qiye smiled.

As the group was about to leave Duality Academy, Li Qiye didn’t tell anyone. Nonetheless, Dugu Lan and the old man insisted on sending him away.

They knew that he didn’t like rowdiness so they came alone.

“Can’t follow me forever, go back now.” Li Qiye eventually commanded along the way.

The two bowed deeply as they watched Li Qiye disappearing into the horizon.
