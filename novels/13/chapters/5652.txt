Chapter 5653: A Potential Opportunity After Death

“You’re here too, Sir?” War God saw Li Qiye and laughed: “Haha, looks like I’ll be saved after all.”

He laughed heartily with a cheerful and carefree demeanor, showing no sign of embarrassment.

He fled like a beaten dog today despite being a top dao lord. Nonetheless, he didn’t mind at all because it was a common occurrence.

He had survived countless battles at this point and never felt humiliated like many of his peers. His cultivation relied on fighting - always growing stronger after each subsequent defeat.

Thus, many treated defeat as the biggest disgrace in their life while he viewed it as just another meal. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The former avoided unwinnable battles, only choosing to fight under preferable circumstances. If they were to lose and survive, they would mark this and try everything to avenge this humiliation in the future.

War God didn’t care for any of this. In the immortal continent alone, he occasionally attacked Celestial Court and usually became surrounded by its top cultivators.

He fled for his life after each loss, battered and beaten. After a full recovery, he would run back and do the same thing again.

He had also challenged random cultivators regardless of their faction, aiming to grow stronger. Just like that, his love for battle became notorious so many actively avoided him.

Beating him was meaningless. Without killing him outright, he would always come back stronger and make sure that the opponent would have no peace.

“You have reached a bottleneck, fighting to improve is no longer useful. The accumulation is at the limit already.” Li Qiye stared at him and commented.

“I am aware, Sir.” War God said with a smile: “But what other method is there for me? Perhaps only death will enlighten me.”

He wasn’t foolish enough to think that he was unkillable. One day, he would throw his life away to a significantly stronger opponent. Nonetheless, he had a trivial view of death. If he couldn't fight, he might as well be dead.

“To rise from death, it might be possible.” Li Qiye said.

“Heroes see things similarly.” War God joked: “But I am still lacking something before death. When I gather enough mastery, I will follow your advice of breaking through after death.”

“Or you may just die.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’ve considered that too. I won’t have any regrets since I’ve dedicated my life to combat, dying on the battlefield is another wish of mine, it’ll be a perfect ending.” War God laughed heartily.

He was born precisely for battle and would die for this sake as well. He welcomed death while others feared it.

“Bam!” Two figures crashed into the earth, causing a violent quake and leaving deep pits behind.

They immediately surrounded him while their auras radiated throughout the valley, on the verge of flattening it.

Both were middle-aged men. One had no weapon while standing with a dignified posture. His frame seemingly soared straight to the sky. A mysterious azure fog surrounded him, making him look enigmatic and full of secrets.

The other man had a saber tied to his back. Though still sheathed, it sent chills down one’s spine. Just its saber intent alone could slay anyone.

A single slash could decide any battle. A second slash would decapitate the gods. A third slash? None was worthy.

“Immortal Emperor Qing Xuan, Immortal Emperor San Dao.” Violet Abyss stated their title.

Both came from the nine worlds. Qing Xuan started Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom and San Dao was its second Immortal Emperor. Unfortunately, their kingdom was eradicated even before the grand calamity.

“The two of you are here already? So much faster than Just-once.” War God laughed after seeing them.

Qing Xuan’s aura permeated across time and space, capable of supporting him for countless ages.

As for San Dao, his saber intent continued to ravage the air. Rumor has it that no one had seen a third slash from him and lived to tell the tale.

Of course, this belief originated from the nine worlds. It was unknown whether this held true in the thirteen continents.

“ Although you’re quite fast, we’re becoming familiar with your escaping technique and pattern, Fellow Daoist.” Qing Xuan spoke with a tinkling and clear voice, resembling the tinkling of metals and jades. It invigorated instead of bothering listeners.

“Yet you still failed to catch me each time.” War God remained at ease.
