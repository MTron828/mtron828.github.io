Chapter 5746: Who Should Be Converted?

“Sacred Teacher, our Pure Land has never forced anyone to stay, they are free to leave at any time.” He placed his palms together after hearing this.

“Can they leave when their mind is bound?” Li Qiye said: “Your Pure Land might not be as extreme as Buddhist Funeral Plateau but both are fundamentally the same. Those who do not seek Buddhism are not qualified to reach paradise.”

“Amitabha.” He frowned after hearing this and said: “All living beings are equal.”

“If that’s the case, then all dao should be able to reach salvation. Why force the issue?” Li Qiye said.

“If they’re not part of Buddhism, it’s not Buddhism’s problem to solve, Sacred Teacher.” He responded.

“The dao path is endless, everyone should be eligible to cultivate without unnecessary and artificial prerequisites. The so-called difficulty in cultivation, outside of the dao heart, is an attempt to monopolize and control, leading to divisions and obstacles.” Li Qiye said.

“Amitabha.” He bowed slightly and said: “Sacred Teacher, why do you cultivate despite harboring such grand aspirations and ideologies?”

“I could have chosen otherwise. A mortal can still find the true self, to live sincerely in the human world without regret, this is also bliss.” Li Qiye smiled: “Thus, paradise or joy shouldn’t require entering your Buddhism or my dao.”

“How does one live without regrets amidst the hardships of life?” He couldn’t help but ask.

“Hardships and sufferings stem from greed and desires.” Li Qiye said.

“Then how do I fulfill them enough not to suffer while not causing external problems?” He asked.

“To realize one’s true nature, then there’s no need for desire, only a life of sincerity and simplicity.” Li Qiye answered.

“And that’s anima.” He understood after hearing this.

“Tell me, how many can you truly save among the masses?” Li Qiye stared meaningfully at him.

“In the billions?” He responded.

“That is mere specks of dust in the river of time.” Li Qiye said.

“True.” He nodded.

“You can spend your life enlighten others but what happens after your death?” Li Qiye said.

“Buddhism is boundless.” He said.

“Say, I choose to join Buddhism and decide to enlighten others, what I accomplish will still only be adding salt to the ocean, mere billions compared to trillions and trillions.” Li Qiye said.

“Salt to the ocean.” He said sentimentally before asking: “Then what should be done to save the living beings?”

“I am not trying to insult your aspiration, but if you can cross Celestial Court and the overlords behind it, can you cross the high heaven? You can cross those weaker than your Buddhism, but what about those stronger than you? Do you dare to attempt or is it merely a case of bullying the weak?” Li Qiye said.

“The strong might not suffer like the weak, and their suffering is often self-inflicted, so is it worth crossing them?” He answered with a question.

“An overlord can devour an epoch, can your Buddhism save as many? Instead of crossing living beings to paradise, just convert one overlord and have the same effect. Convert the strong not because they are strong but because it is beneficial for the weak.” Li Qiye said.

“Hmm...” He became emotional and his light intensified.

“As your dao heart grows stronger, you will travel farther on the path. Everything will become possible but it is fine if you insist on crossing living beings in the future. Just know that this dao only perpetuates the same cycle, not break it.” Li Qiye said.

“I see...” He listened attentively and seemed to be grasping something.

“The old geezer from Pure Land lasted for an epoch but did his Buddhist kingdom save everyone? In the end, he couldn’t even save himself.” Li Qye continued.

“What should I do then, Sacred Teacher?” He bowed after a moment of reflection.

“Focus on cultivation and walk farther on the dao path.” Li Qiye said.

“What comes after?” He asked.

“Why do you attempt to convert living beings? The world is full of suffering not created by them, they are mere victims so the focus should be on eliminating the sources of suffering.” Li Qiye continued.

“I understand, that is why you kill overlords and fight the high heaven.” He prostrated on the ground.

“You are overthinking it, I don’t try to since they do not need me to save or enlighten them. I am merely seeking my true self, that is all.” Li Qiye said: “I actively try not to become saviors for they become destroyers in due time, and those who try to enlighten others often shackle them.”

“So I shackle others...” He murmured.

After a long while, he regained his wits and asked: “How far can I go, Sacred Teacher?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Far.” Li Qiye nodded: “And there will be more fun later on, a lot more enjoyable than enlightening living beings.”

“And that is?” He asked.

“It depends on you, whether you enlighten living beings, overlords, or yourself.” Li Qiye said.

“I need to cultivate more.” He said.

“Enlighten yourself first before attempting to enlighten others. The farther you are down this path, the better will your salvation be.” Li Qiye said.

“I am enlightened.” He lowered his head.

“Your old geezer has always been ambitious with enlightenment, it’s just that he couldn’t enlighten himself. The path you walk is difficult, there is still a long way to go.” Li Qiye said.

“Is this just the beginning?” He asked.

“Yes, if we’re talking about enlightening living beings. Who have you truly enlightened in this mortal world without binding them? Even the geezer’s epoch couldn’t break this constraint, to save without shackling.” Li Qiye said: “Of course, this isn’t to say that their endeavors weren’t remarkable and grand. It’s just that there was no fundamental change. A Buddhist kingdom is no different from the mortal world.”

“I understand.” He nodded again.
