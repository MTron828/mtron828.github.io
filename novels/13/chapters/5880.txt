Chapter 5880: She Has The High Heaven’s Power

The mysterious limit breaker puzzled everyone. After all, there was no reason to hide their success. The first ones were role models and encouraged future generations to work harder.

Competing for resources was not a thing either. Thus, the whole world celebrated whenever an emperor broke the limit. Hiding their identity seemed unnecessary.

Only a key group of emperors had a good guess.

“Should be Fan Chen.” They discussed this matter.

Among the remaining core emperors, Fan Chen was at the top of the list. However, unlike the others living in harmony and prosperity, he disappeared after the battle.

Profound, World, and other apex cultivators became renowned again as public figures. Although regular cultivators didn’t know their location, they kept a line of communication with each other.

The same couldn’t be said for Fan Chen who most likely disappeared into the mortal world. He returned to being a mortal and entered the sea of people.

He could be a merchant in the immortal continent, a farmer in a village in the upper continents, a cook in a small restaurant in the lower continents...

All in all, people had no idea where he came from or where he went.

“Returning to the mortal coil, he has his own mission.” A key monarch commented.

He was far from being as famous as World. In fact, Ren Xian and Chi Ye were more renowned than him.

The world knew little about him but the participants of the battle saw just how powerful he was - definitely on top of the list.

His cultivation was impressive, not to mention possessing one of the five immortal armaments - Reversion Blade. Moreover, Li Qiye gifted him the crystal shield and Lord of Derivation’s drum. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Who could actually match him in combat outside of World’s peers? Li Qiye also seemed to highly value him.

Another ten thousand years passed and a massive amount of divinity erupted in the immortal continent.

“Demon Conqueror surpassed the limit!” This news spread across the realms.

This came as a shock to no one for she was the capable leader of Imperial Field. People saw her ability and leadership during the march to Celestial Court.

Not long after, Nightmoon Conqueror was the next.

“The Qian might not be around but their descendants live on proudly.” Emperors and monarchs couldn’t help but praise.

World became the leader of Celestial Court and could rebuild the Qian. Alas, he chose against it, leaving the scattered members to do as they please.

The clan with nine emperors and true authority was only a legend now. Nevertheless, its influence remained.

World was the strongest emperor with the highest authority in the epoch. Next was Sword who chose to leave Celestial Court to live reclusively - the first known cultivator to break the limit after the battle.

Nightmoon also reached this level so the Qian had three limit breakers. Others couldn’t help but admire and be envious of them. Although World didn’t restart the clan, they still viewed it as the most powerful clan currently.

The immortal continent was not the host of the next limit breaker. It came from Azure Peak of the upper continents.

“Someone in the upper continents made it.” This news traveled everywhere.

After a few more generations, numerous energy swords manifested into reality and remained for three thousand years. Eventually, the limit was broken.

“Another one.” Emperors and monarchs from the immortal continent observed this and were impressed.

“Our generation is over, this world belongs to them.” An apex emperor commented.

Before this, the limit breakers were the old guards from Trinity Epoch. The public also addressed them as ancient emperors.

With Demon Conqueror leading the way, newer cultivators embarked on the next path. This gave the impression that a new age was coming. The dao lords and conquerors were finally catching up.

Eight Desolaces enjoyed prosperity as well. The only difference was the new dao lords needed to ascend to start their limit-break journey.

It didn’t take long before more and more dao lords appeared on the six continents. One stood out in particular - a girl who astounded everyone with her ascension.

She visited and caused trouble in all four alliances in the lower continents. Once she reached the immortal continent, she challenged the emperors in Celestial Court and Imperial Field.

Strange rumors came from her age. It was said that when she first ascended, she was around eleven or twelve years of age. When she made it to Celestial Court, they said she was only five or six years old.

The stories made no sense since she was reversing in age. Alas, there were enough accounts to make it notable.

A second notable cultivator was a greasy and dirty monk. However, he entered Pure Land and amazed everyone with his Buddhist affinity. The old monks couldn’t help but come out to see him.

A second girl ascended, always keeping her head low and never speaking. People noted something odd about her. Even emperors had to keep a distance.

“She... she contains the power of the high heaven.” One emperor remarked.
