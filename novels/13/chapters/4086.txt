Chapter 4087: Ninth

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Activate!” The plant demons scattered around the border released their vitality and grand dao power in order to destroy the supreme formation.

Unfortunately, they found that their effort was useless - unable to shake or damage the buildings in the slightest.

“They’re immovable, are they a part of the plain now?” One expert was surprised to see the roots failing.

“Yes, it’s a perfect fusion. They will not be separated unless something is strong enough to obliterate the entire plain. However, destruction is impossible without taking care of the formation first.” A formation master shook his head.

“So there’s no way?” A cultivator nearby didn’t buy it.

“Of course there’s a way, you just need someone far stronger than this formation and use absolute strength to beat it.” The ancestor replied.

Listeners exchanged glances, aware that very few in Sword Continent could be stronger than this supreme formation.

The impending failure infuriated and frightened Celestial Ape Demon King. He didn’t expect them to fail utterly.

“Stop wasting energy.” Li Qiye smiled and flipped his hand. The earth’s loop became bright and the buildings resonated with it.

Rays of light came out of them and acted like divine swords. The disciples on the border didn’t feel anything at first. Alas, it was too late once they noticed.

“Boom!” The roots and plants suddenly exploded. This sent the original users flying and vomiting blood.

With this, the spectators had a better idea of how hard it was to beat this formation.

“This is gonna be bloody. Li Qiye has all the advantages at the moment, they have to pay a heavy price.” One older expert said.

“If this is all you can do, then just pack up and leave. It’s truly suicidal.” Li Qiye smiled.

Starshooter King and Celestial Ape Demon King had an ugly expression. The latter looked worse because he had lost twice so far. This was extremely humiliating for a famous character like himself.

They stared at each other and nodded in unison.

“To formation!” Both shouted.

“To formation!” The members of their legions roared thunderously. It felt as if the world was shaking from the intensity of their voice.

“Clank! Clank!” The glints of weapons illuminated the region. Both legions gave off the impression that they could break anything.

Spectators trembled, thinking that they were mere ants in comparison. Nonetheless, fear didn’t diminish their excitement for the battle.

“They’re about to launch the offense.” One expert said. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“There’s no other way outside of a direct attack. They don’t want to pay the ransom.” A clan elder nodded.

Everyone knew that Li Qiye’s asking price was ridiculous and no sects would accept it.

“Clank!” A sword hymn suddenly forced their weapons to resonate back and interrupted the tense atmosphere.

A divine sword descended, seemingly piercing their heart deep. Some felt a sharp pain and had to cry out.

It pinned onto the ground first then its master landed subsequently. The two have reached a state of oneness. The landing resulted in a huge pit with mud flying everywhere. This was quite a flashy entrance.

The newcomer slowly stood up and revealed himself to be a rather skinny middle-aged man. He wore a black robe with his hair draping down freely. His expression and gaze were cold and devoid of any ripple.

He was exactly like the blade in his hand - a tool for murder, black as ink from top to bottom. Its cold gleam inflicted pain to the spectators.

The legendary state of oneness with the sword was in full display in this case.

“Eighth!” An ancestor bellowed after seeing him.

Even the imperious Celestial Ape Demon King and Starshooter King became alarmed.

“Eighth of Sword God Sacred Ground!” This title struck fear into the listeners regardless of whether they had met him before.

“Ninth.” The middle-aged man uttered emotionlessly.

“Ninth?! He has finished the ninth sword then!” The big shots understood the significance of this title.

“Ninth… Why is he here?!” People stopped calling him “Eighth” right away.

“I thought he had disappeared…” A youth shuddered.

“Yes, after slaying seven sect masters in a row.” An older cultivator said.

“I thought he died from injuries from that last battle, here he is now, with the ninth sword finished.” One ancestor said.

“So this is a member of Sword God Sacred Ground.” Someone else brought this up.

In the contemporary, several sects reigned supreme - Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom as the strongest, Sword Temple with its unfathomable foundation, Virtuous School for its popularity…

However, anyone from these sects, including their successor, would become afraid after hearing about the sacred ground.

This sect was rather unique due to its lack of disciples - only three or so. This number could even go down to one.
