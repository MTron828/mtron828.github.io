Chapter 3521: Society Mantra

The oppressive powers left no room for Li Qiye to escape. They intended on obliterating every last piece of him.

The ancestors couldn’t be blamed for being merciless. It was simply due to Li Qiye’s frightening nature. They had no way of knowing whether he was alive or not so it was better to keep the attacks going.

“Li Qiye can’t survive this.” This sentiment became pervasive. After all, even an impervious body would die in this case.

“The strongest Heavenly Sovereign might not be able to leave unscathed, Li Qiye is only a Violet Marquis.” One expert murmured.

In fact, people would feel worse if Li Qiye were to survive. That would only further add to his devilishness. No sects could ever function without fear from then on.

A few ancestors didn’t say anything because they have personally witnessed Li Qiye’s battles in the past. He always came up with a miracle during the most perilous moment. Thus, they wouldn’t dare to comment on his survival until the very last moment.

“Well, the ancient ancestors are so strong. We can’t compare to them.” Another said with reverence.

Though Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign and Azure Dragon Ancient Ancestor suffered a setback to Li Qiye, this didn’t mean that they were weak. Their opponent was simply too strong.

Time passed by yet people were still completely focused. The five ancestors exchanged glances as well.

They naturally hoped for Li Qiye to be dead. No one should be able to survive the crushing forces for this long. Alas, intuition told them otherwise. They couldn’t sense his death despite knowing that their moves had directly connected.

“Boom!” Space suddenly quaked with ripples.

“Damn!” The five ancestors realized something and became aghast. They immediately roared and unleashed more power. This proved to be futile.

“Rumble!” The sword grinder was being pushed outward, inch by inch. A familiar figure eventually emerged.

“Li Qiye!” Everyone shouted this name including the ancient ancestors.

He was still alive, completely untouched. One could see the manifestation of three thousand worlds before him. The devil and gods emerged once more. Living beings continued to reproduce and prosper in these worlds for what seems to be an eternity.

They were all created with a single thought from Li Qiye. All were under his control regardless of how powerful they were.

In the next split second, the three thousand worlds repelled the previous attacks - draconic flame, lunar and solar lights. The torrents couldn’t get through them at all.

“This is Society, right?” An expert instantly made a connection with a particular mantra.

“Yes, it is.” An ancestor replied after carefully looking at it.

“Another of the seven...” Some were surprised while others got used to it.

“How many has he finished?” Another high elder wondered.

“Maybe he wants to do all seven?” His friend speculated.

This would be too illogical because most would move on to better mantras and merit laws, at least before today.

“I thought we could only cultivate four mantras.” A genius couldn’t help but ask. This was common knowledge regardless of one’s power.

“He’s Li Qiye.” His ancestor replied.

This line seemed to be the only logical explanation for what they were seeing. Everyone smiled wryly after hearing it. They needed to stop judging him using conventional wisdom and start expecting the unexpected.

The five ancient ancestors knew that this was Society as well. They were on the verge of going crazy since they wanted to see some amazing supreme laws or mantras in the case of defeat. That would make death a little more palatable.

However, Li Qiye was only using the common mantras. To lose to these mantras would be infuriating.

For example, a top master could die with his eyes closed after being slain by an ultimate weapon. On the other hand, to die to a vegetable knife? One would never accept this even after turning into a ghost.

“Boom!” The inhabitants of the resplendent worlds offered their worship to Li Qiye and empowered him.

The sword grinder finally failed to stop Li Qiye and got flipped over. This was the case for the other beams and rays as well. The five staggered backward and felt their vitality churning, paled. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Everyone took a deep breath, speechless. They could see that these five ancestors couldn’t suppress him. He was too powerful and devilish.

“This is all you can do?” Li Qiye chuckled and said.

No one became angry any more because he could say whatever he wanted now after proving his might.

“Who is he...?” This question popped up in the ancient ancestors’ mind. They have traveled across the world for eras without seeing anything like this.

They have met dao lords but none was as monstrous as the unfathomable Li Qiye.
