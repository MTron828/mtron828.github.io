Chapter 477: Another Farewell

After a long time, a light suddenly darted out from within the ancient temple. It was the same light that flew out from the ancient box in Li Qiye’s hand. Now, it had returned to the box.

Shortly thereafter, a group of lights shot out from the ancient temple, but Qiurong Wanxue couldn’t discern its shape very clearly. These lights went inside Li Qiye and resonated with the green light. Clanking sounds appeared all over his body as if battle armor was being put on.

Li Qiye slowly put away the box and received his Fate Palace along with the tree stump. Li Qiye opened his eyes and heaved a long sigh of relief.

“Success!” Qin Guangwang also softened up. He then murmured: “Since you were able to dig out that mythical thing... Combined with this battle armor, you will definitely be able to survive the battle.”

“I hope so.” Li Qiye calmly said: “This is only one more layer of defense. We can’t determine who the winner will be until the very end. However, I am certain that I will not be the first to die.”

“Rumble!” An explosion occurred in the ancient temple as if the heaven and earth was shattering while the whole world swayed.

In the sky inside the ancient temple, the shadow near the gate suddenly emitted a bright light and erupted with a power capable of destroying all things to block the curse from the heavens.

This sudden change startled Qiurong Wanxue, causing her to yell out: “What has happened?”

Li Qiye gazed at the scene inside the temple and murmured: “This is a turning point. In the end, a final gamble is still needed.”

A dao rune appeared on the ground and, before Qiurong Wanxue knew what was going on, she lost her vision. Li Qiye, Qin Guangwang, and Qiurong Wanxue were all sent outside.

At the dao land of the ghost race, the once-colorful earth lost its colors. The lights that pierced the sky were extinguished as if all the power had been withdrawn.

No one knew what was going on. The universal laws suddenly intertwined into dao gates and teleported all the young cultivators away.

Even the golden sea had changed as if all of its power had been sucked out, drying up the sea. With continuous splashes, the black sea once again dominated this area.

Nightsea’s situation was the same as above. In the middle of the ocean, a black water suddenly shot out and began to spread throughout the clear water.

“Oh mother, what is going on?” The cultivators in Nightsea quickly turned around to flee towards shore with their fastest speed. Death would be certain if they were touched by this black-as-ink water.

Countless cultivators were transported back to Necropolis without prior warning. Many people were stunned by this scene.

“What is happening?” They were all confused.

Even Tian Lunhui was not an exception. He did not completely understand the things he was learning so he was full of regret: “What a shame.” If there was more time, then Tian Lunhui would have definitely been able to comprehend the whole thing.

Li Qiye, Qin Guangwang, and Qiurong Wanxue were teleported back to a different location in Necropolis.

Qin Guangwang looked around and said: “I have to go back to my old coffin. When you’re ready to go to war, just call for me.” He then gave an item to Li Qiye.

Li Qiye accepted the item and nodded his head to say: “For sure, I shall leave the vanguard to you.”

Qin Guangwang then turned around and disappeared without a trace.

Qiurong Wanxue found it strange and asked: “Young Noble, is Imp a human or a ghost?” [1. Here, I’m pretty sure she is asking if he is an outsider or a sentiment.]

“He’s neither a human nor a ghost. He is just an ‘existence’ after the blood ceremony.” Li Qiye smiled and responded.

She didn’t know what a blood ceremony was, but she didn’t pry any further. She asked something else instead: “Young Noble, what do we do now?”

Li Qiye narrowed his eyes and replied: “We’ll go to the Ancestral Flow. Huang Jiaofu’s matter is all that’s left to resolve. It is about time for us to leave Necropolis.”

Li Qiye had obtained the items he wanted, so now it was time to enter the Prime Ominous Grave. The lost mythical island was in there and there was another thing that he had to obtain there.

Li Qiye, once again, went to the Ancestral Flow. He left Qiurong Wanxue outside to wait while he went to meet the master alone.

“You still haven’t left!” The Ancestral Flow Master spoke emotionlessly. It was as if the master was especially unwelcoming towards Li Qiye.

“I just came out from that place.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “Maybe I have some information that might interest you.”

“You didn’t just come here to tell me news, right?” The Ancestral Flow Master coldly said: “Even if you didn’t go, I would still be able to guess a thing or two about it!”

“You will certainly want to hear it. For example, what the Heavenly Annihilation is like.” Li Qiye said.

“Hurry up and say it.” The master coldly spoke: “Don’t waste my time. I would still know even if you don’t tell me.”

“You speak as if I am a person who only comes to get things. Can I not come to specifically say goodbye to you?” Li Qiye wryly smiled and asked.

“You are definitely not the type of person who comes without a reason.” The master was as cold as ice: “As for farewells... Would you ever say goodbye? If I remember correctly, after that time, you quickly escaped and never showed yourself again. You actually consider yourself the type to say goodbye to others?”

“Umm... That last time was special.” Li Qiye awkwardly smiled: “I wanted to say goodbye, but I had to suddenly take Immortal Emperor Ming Du away since I was in a rush. Thus, it was too late to say goodbye.”

“Is that so?” The Ancestral Flow Master doubtfully replied: “If I am not mistaken, back then, Ming Du left before you so how did you escort him out?”

“Ah... Haha, I was guarding the rear.” Li Qiye was a little embarrassed, but he smilingly continued: “It was so long ago so just forget it. A person should always look forward; only by doing so would there be hope.”

“Sorry, but I’m not someone like you who always looks ahead and never turns back.” The master coldly smiled.

“I...” Li Qiye was about to say something else, but he closed his mouth and only softly sighed.

The master became quiet for a bit before continuing: “Hurry up and state your business. My patience is limited and my time is short. Not everyone can have everlasting life and have enough time to waste like you! If there is nothing else, then I am going to sleep.”

“I... I have something...” Li Qiye stuttered. He didn’t know how to say it. This matter was not so simple, and asking for a favor was never easy to do.

The displeased master saw through Li Qiye’s thoughts and snorted while looking at him before speaking: “Don’t tell me you want to dig in my Necropolis again?”

Li Qiye was found out. He awkwardly rubbed his hands together and said: “Here’s the thing, you... Don’t you feel that Huang Jiaofu is worth grooming?”

“Huang Jiaofu?” The master coldly exclaimed: “That year, you took away Ming Du. Isn’t this enough? That had already broken the rules of Necropolis!”

Li Qiye quickly retorted: “But Huang Jiaofu and Ming Du are different. Huang Jiaofu belongs to Necropolis, he’s a real inhabitant. That year, Ming Du obtained a great creation, but Huang Jiaofu was not any lesser than Ming Du. However, the time wasn’t ripe. Even with Ming Du’s origin, he was still very appreciative towards Necropolis. If Huang Jiaofu could come out, then he would still be a disciple of Necropolis. I can guarantee you that, in the future, he will treat Necropolis well and make great contributions. I will observe him—”

“That’s enough!” The master interrupted Li Qiye: “Impossible! I was too kind that year. The rules of Necropolis cannot be broken again, I will not make a second exception!”

The master was adamant about this, so there was no room for further negotiations.

Li Qiye couldn’t help but turn silent and gently sigh a while later. He then bitterly smiled and said: “Then... I won’t force you. That year, when I forcefully took Ming Du away, it was my mistake. This time, I came back to apologize to you. If you don’t agree, then I’ll listen to you. We can only say that Huang Jiaofu’s good fortune hasn’t come.”

The master coldly scowled at Li Qiye’s response.

Li Qiye continued to speak in a sincere manner: “This time, I truly came to say goodbye to you. Once I gather the things I need, that will truly be the time to declare war.

“You are right, I had everlasting life and plenty of time, but that was only before when I was the Dark Crow. I didn’t say goodbye back then because I knew I had enough time to eventually come back and see you again.” Li Qiye softly sighed.

At this point, he let out a bitter smile and continued: “But now, I am no longer the Dark Crow and I no longer have everlasting life. When I leave this time, I don’t know when I will be able to come back and visit Necropolis again, or if I will have the opportunity to do so at all.

“Because of this, in addition to Huang Jiaofu’s matter, I specifically came to say goodbye to you.” Li Qiye continued: “No matter what, you will have the chance to wait for that day, and I hope that I will be able to see a day like that in the future as well!”

The Ancestral Flow Master sat there silently without saying anything and only coldly glared at Li Qiye with a profound gaze full of unreadable emotions.

Li Qiye deeply stared at the master before saying: “Take care, I hope that we can meet again in the future!”

The master remained seated there silently without any movement.
