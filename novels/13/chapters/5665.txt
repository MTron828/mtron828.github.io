Chapter 5666: Watch The Back

He recalled how the dark crow schemed and fought from the nine worlds to the thirteen continents, sweeping through darkness and perils for the inhabitants.

He rid the world of the ancient ming and supported the hundred races above. His contributions were second to none.

Alas, how many appreciated his sacrifice and efforts? They viewed him as the dark hand behind the curtains, the butcher of the nine worlds. There was only fear, no gratitude.

As time passed, his achievements were gradually forgotten. People only recalled the tales of a taboo existence whose name shouldn’t be uttered.

Thus, it wasn’t outrageous to sympathize with the overlords who deemed the world and its inhabitants as not worth protecting.

Therefore, even the inactive ones lost their love for the world. At that point, consuming it no longer became an issue worth pondering. The emotional effect was the same as eating a meal.

“Holding on for so long only to lose in the end.” South Emperor said.

“That is why having immortals and saviors is disastrous.” Li Qiye smiled: “An ant can never deal real damage, unlike top cultivators such as yourself.”

“I can’t argue with that.” South Emperor smiled wryly.

Mortals waged war with each other but the devastation remained limited. However, an emperor or monarch could take down continents. As for an epoch lord, that’s someone who could herald absolute destruction.

“We are the real disasters.” Li Qiye went on: “The world doesn’t need saviors, only unambitious cultivators who can maintain their dao heart.”

He paused for a second before continuing: “Reaching the imperial level is difficult and perilous, but that is only the beginning of the path. If one’s dao heart wavers at this point, they cannot reach the other shore and most likely will become a scourge beforehand.”

“Yes, Sacred Teacher.” South Emperor responded respectfully while fearing for his future. He nearly fell during the first trial; could he persevere after becoming an overlord?

He sighed sentimentally while looking at the four symbols: “An overlord with thirteen palaces and inborn trinity, what started the decline?”

“When you are invincible, you may feel that everything is possible. After failing, you start thinking about how to win again regardless of the price, as long as you’re not the one paying. After this notion appears, descending into darkness is only a step away.” Li Qiye said.

“When oneself is not the cost.” South Emperor murmured. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Yes, the choice becomes easy since there is nothing to lose personally and there is no moral compass to speak of.” Li Qiye smiled.

“He failed the expedition.” Li Qiye said: “he turned back and thought about his epoch. Although it was still there, he found that it was no longer his. Since that was the case, why not?”

“He most likely thought about sacrificing it for more power.” South Emperor took a deep breath.

“It depended on the other overlords’ stance as well, but most would do the same thing without certain circumstances holding them back.” Li Qiye said.

“Sacred Teacher, can you tell me more about the expeditions?” South Emperor asked.

“Imagine having complete confidence in your power only to ascend and find that you’re nothing but a foot soldier, easily beaten by others. Will your dao heart shatter then?” Li Qiye asked.

“Well...” South Emperor didn’t respond.

“Let’s say that you’re strong enough to make it through to the final battle. That is when you find that only death awaits, would you try to come up with an escape plan?” Li Qiye continued.

“Just to live longer, sure.” South Emperor said.

“Not everyone made this choice. Some with a strong dao heart were ready to fight despite knowing the outcome. But if this wasn’t the original goal, the person would return for the sacrifice.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So be wary of returners?” South Emperor thought of this point.

“Yes, but be more wary of those standing behind you.” Li Qiye said.

“I see.” A gleam flashed in South Emperor’s eyes.

“More often than not, an expedition is not a solo adventure and you might not be the only overlord. Although your dao heart might remain firm in the most desperate moment, those fighting alongside you might not share the same unwavering resolve.” Li Qiye said.

“Sacred Teacher, it sounds as if we shouldn’t trust anyone.” South Emperor inhaled sharply.

“The path of the dao is inherently a solitary journey. Have no real expectations of others and be prepared to walk alone, that’s the only way to maintain the dao heart.” Li Qiye said.

“Right, no disappointment without expectation.” South Emperor said.

“The world and other living beings have little to do with your dao. The one who walks the path is you and you alone.” Li Qiye taught.

“Me alone...” South Emperor absorbed this ideology.
