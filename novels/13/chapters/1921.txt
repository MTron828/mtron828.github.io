“Despite the ascension process being cut short, Wildlad Heaven Emperor was still strong enough and managed to survive. Why? His ancestors and the Heaven Race believed that he could become a Grand Emperor with twelve wills, so three Grand Emperors of his clan went to protect him, knowing that Mortal Reversion Ancient God had given the kill order.”

Shi Hunlin became excited with his blood boiling at this part of the story: “That move completely angered the Ancient God. He personally took action and defeated the three Grand Emperors. Nevertheless, under the escort of his ancestors, the young emperor got away. Alas, the Ancient God didn’t let this go and continued his pursuit. The four emperors running away were completely bloodied.”

“One against four Grand Emperors?! Mortal Reversion Ancient God is so heaven-defying then, he must be unbeatable.” Wu Qi felt the same excitement and pride coursing through him.

“Indeed, he isn’t only an Ancient God but also a great demon with the Human-monarch bloodline. Some even considered him the second coming of Six Dao Monarch! Keep in mind, the Ancient God had also fought against Wave Emperor and survived. From this, you can just imagine his formidable might.”

“Against Wave Emperor...” Wu Qi took a deep breath.

Wave Emperor was a legend. He came from the Devil Race, the seventh to have twelve wills. However, his biggest achievement wasn’t his twelve wills. It was using eleven palaces to shoulder twelve wills. This broke the law of one will per palace. He was the only one in the world back then who could do so.

Unfortunately, he fell to the Heavenly Execution later or his status today wouldn’t be less than World Emperor and his peers.

Thus, the fact that Mortal Reversion Ancient God could fight against Wave Emperor was definitely a proud achievement to the hundred races.

“Then how did Wildlad Heaven Emperor avoid this disaster?” Wu Fengying asked.

“The Celestial Court.” Hunlin was still staring at the direction of the emperor and said: “That’s what I heard. A few Grand Emperors from this organization came out to beseech for the young emperor. Outsiders don’t know the details but his clan paid up a large number of resources. Plus, the young emperor was no longer allowed to get more Heaven’s Wills. Mortal Reversion Ancient God finally stopped after these conditions.”

The group was very wary of this name. Everyone in the thirteen continent knew that the Celestial Court was the biggest pillar of the heaveners. Some even said that the court was the origin of the entire race.

Very few dared to provoke this organization. It would only involve itself on grand matters relating to the Heaven Race. Even emperors were quite careful when dealing with this group as well.

“But Mortal Reversion Ancient God is still very amazing.” The princess emotionally stated.

Even before the Celestial Court, the Ancient God still demanded great reparation from Wildlad Heaven Emperor’s clan on top of sealing his future. The court wouldn’t give someone else the same amount of respect.

“It’s because he’s an Ancient God that can fight against a twelve-will emperor.” Shi Hunlin nodded: “The young emperor’s talents were truly impeccable, that’s why the entire race had such hope for him. The Celestial Court most likely felt the same way, that he could obtain twelve wills. But after the mess with Mortal Reversion Ancient God, the court probably gave up then. If it was any other genius, the court probably wouldn’t have interfered in the first place because this Ancient God is very influential and beloved by the hundred races.”

He became slightly pensive after stating this. In the past, the court wouldn’t give a damn about the hundred races but after Emperor Hunt, the hundred races’ status soared. In some generations, they were even more brilliant than the three races. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“What a strange Grand Emperor.” Wu Qi finally concluded. An ultimate genius eventually ended up being an emperor with just one will.

Shi Hunlin smiled and shook his head: “Alas, Wildlad Heaven Emperor still didn’t change after so many years; he’s still as arrogant and pompous like before.”

The group contemplated. Some other emperors might just be as arrogant but they wouldn’t express it in such an explicit manner. Perhaps the young emperor became this way due to his lack of challenge and failure early on in life.

All the other emperors had to struggle and break through countless difficulties before finally proving their grand dao to become an emperor.

As for Wildlad, he only needed one move to defeat his peers. Moreover, his cultivation speed was too fast as well. Those stronger than him yesterday would go down to him on the next day. This genius had never tasted bitterness so he became an emperor lacking vision and calmness.

A series of explosions resounded not long after the emperor’s arrival. Many cultivators were running in that direction right behind the emperor.

“What are they doing?” Wu Qi asked: “Are they trying to ride his coattails and get some treasures?”

“Could be true. Emperors wouldn’t easily leave their grottos so his sudden appearance here might mean that he wants something, perhaps an immortal treasure.” Hunlin speculated: “There are too many secret treasures buried here, following someone could give more clues.”

“That’s right, the emperors can eat meat and small fry like us can have some leftover too. Plus, having one open the way will make it quite safe.” Wu Qi’s eyes lit up.

“Haha, senior, should we tag along too to see what the young emperor is digging? We won’t be stealing anything, just broadening our horizon is good enough.” He immediately got close to Hunlin and asked.

Wu Fengying immediately glared at him: “You go alone then. Didn’t you hear Young Noble Li? He wants us to wait here for him.”

“Oh? Where did my proud sister run off to?” Wu Qi immediately mocked: “Since when did you become so obedient? I didn’t know you were such a good child.”

“You!” Being teased by her brother like this left her embarrassed but she quickly rubbed her fist, seemingly ready to give him a brutal beating.

The scared youth instantly hid behind Shi Hunlin. Meanwhile, Jilin Princess was quite amused by these two siblings.

Wu Qi didn’t give up and grabbed Hunlin’s arm: “Senior, we’re only going for a look, maybe the young emperor will find some amazing treasury. If that’s the case, we can go back and report it to Young Noble Li.

“Fine, we’ll just go for a quick glance and return.” Hunlin lost to the eager youth. Plus, he wanted to see what the young emperor was aiming for anyway.

In the end, the group also traveled towards the emperor’s direction. The juniors were relatively at ease because there was a High God like Shi Hunlin with them.

“Hehehe, Senior, I’m curious about something, may I ask you a question?” Wu Qi smiled along the way.

“Stop being so weird. I’ll think about answering as long as it isn’t something despicable.” Hunlin gave him the side eye. This High God didn’t posture at all and got along very well with the juniors.

“This lowly one only wants to ask, Senior, are you stronger than Wildlad Heaven Emperor? Of course, I’m merely curious.” Wu Qi smiled and asked.

The two women became attentive right away after hearing the question.

The topic of strength between High Gods and emperors had always been hotly debated. Of course, this was limited to the low-level ones. There was no point in debating someone at World Emperor’s level versus a High God.

Many thought that a High God with a set of five to six totems was as strong as an emperor with three wills since if there was a gap between these two, it would be quite minimal.

“I’m only a minor god, can’t reach the apex. I can’t compare to the emperors.” Hunlin humbly answered without any hesitation.

Of course, the group didn’t believe him entirely. He was still a High God with a set of three totems. This was a great advantage since he was much stronger than one with three totems but not in a set.
