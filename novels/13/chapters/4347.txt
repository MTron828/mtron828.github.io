Chapter 4348: Monstrous Power

A transcending aura instantly appeared and swept through the region, seemingly devouring everything in its path and leaving behind only darkness.

The water was blown away and the bottom of the lake became exposed; it had countless cracks at this point.

“Is this the end…” Both the weak and strong cultivators were scared out of their wits. Some lay paralyzed on the ground, pale.

“Buzz.” A figure emerged at the bottom.

It appeared to be a creature of darkness but it wasn’t black from top to bottom. It actually exuded bright rays instead. Its eyes, in particular, exuded red rays.

No cultivator wanted to be the target of its attention. Being stared at by this creature would instantly freeze them, making them feel as if their heart has been pierced and their blood fully drained. The fear made them want to scream but no sound came out of their throat.

They no longer wanted to watch the show and only wanted to run as far away as possible. Alas, they have lost control of their body.

“Rumble!” Explosions occurred continuously. The appearance of this being suppressed all affinities in the world.

The aura from Peacock Monarch was certainly mighty. Alas, it was instantly crushed, appearing feeble like a fried potato.

“What the hell is this…?” Even the cool disciples from the larger sects nearly soiled their pants after seeing the figure.

“Buzz.” The figure immediately gathered the two broken halves of the monstrosity and fused with them.

The initially colossal frame became smaller and smaller until it was the size of a regular person. This new being possessed a level of destructiveness surpassing the previous.

Just one hand wave could obliterate the region. One finger flick could take down numerous stars above. It resembled a crownless king. All cultivators in the world must prostrate before it.

The crowd thought that they were silly for thinking so highly of Peacock Monarch’s aura a while ago. His imperious aura was as weak as a candle flickering in the wind versus this dark existence.

“Is this a devil king…?” The crowd became overwhelmed with horror and confusion.

This dark existence made the creatures earlier seem like cute puppies. Even the giant monstrosity was not worth mentioning.

“Finally.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Saves me a lot of effort.”

He knew about this dark existence underground from the start. The suppression spell from the spirits of the legion across the era failed to destroy it.

This spell weakened with time and couldn’t take it down. Nonetheless, this was an extremely weakened state.

Since Li Qiye removed the spell, this dark existence saw a glimpse of freedom and immediately took it.

The little creatures a while ago were only the scouting parties created by this being. Since the monarch killed the monstrosity, it finally decided to come out.

Li Qiye has been waiting for it while hiding his aura. If it didn’t come out, he would need to spend considerable time and effort to drag it out from underground. Now, it decided to jump into the net.

“Clank!” The intent of the monarch fell threatened and immediately attacked. Swords rained down from the sky with enough power to pierce to the core.

Unfortunately, they couldn’t injure the dark being even though it was just standing there.

Spectators gasped after seeing the failed attack.

“It’s too strong.” An expert couldn’t believe it.

“Clank!” A loud hymn could be heard as the five-colored divine sword appeared again for an ultimate slash. This was the move that took down the monstrosity earlier.

“Boom!” The dark existence simply punched the slash and reduced all affinities to ashes. The five-colored divine sword blew up into scattering particles, prompting the crowd to bellow in astonishment.

In the next second, the dark existence disappeared with a speed that could only be described as the fastest in the world.

When people could see it again, the situation had completely reversed. It stood before the young lord and the intent of the monarch.

There was only one yet people saw it gripping the young lord’s throat and another afterimage sealing the monarch’s intent. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The second image released dark flames from its hands while the other gripped tightly. The young lord’s eyes turned white as a result.
