Chapter 5696: Drive These Dogs Back To Celestial Court

“Boom!” Rays of blinding light surged into the air - the manifestation of the power of Momentous Frontier.

“The deities are answering the call!” Mortals were ecstatic and prostrated in reverence.

“It’s happening, it’s really happening, Momentous Frontier is making a move!” The survivors of Dao Domain cried out in joy after seeing their prayers coming to fruition.

“They will stand with us, we’re saved!” One cultivator celebrated.

“They are still one of us and will help us in times of crisis.” An ancestor couldn’t contain his excitement.

“As long as they can stop Celestial Court’s advance long enough to buy time for Luminous Conqueror and West Bank Prime Emperor, reinforcements from Imperial Field will come. We will be able to defeat them and win back Dao Domain.” Another ancestor had an optimistic assessment. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Their prayers have been answered - Momentous Frontier had broken its pact of neutrality and stood alongside The People.

War Ancient God had a serious expression, the same for his peers. They wondered if Luminous and West Bank had carried out the plan successfully.

“Boom!” The light from Momentous Frontier spread across Dao Domain.

A majestic figure with a mighty imperial aura could be seen within, looking like a lord with the world in his palm.

“Luminous Conqueror!” The survivors shouted his title.

“Look, West Bank Prime Emperor too!” They then saw another figure nearby.

“They’re fully healed, this is the turning point!” Another applauded.

“Yes, yes! The deities must have healed them.” A cultivator was moved to tears.

Their home was destroyed and they were suppressed. Now, the two were the shining rays giving them hope again.

Meanwhile, War Ancient God and the others smiled after seeing this. Their plan must have been a resounding success.

“I apologize for the wait.” Luminous Conqueror appeared invincible.

Survivors didn’t notice anything peculiar about him, only focusing on his wondrous aura.

“It’s time for the counterattack. They can borrow the power of Momentous Frontier with the help of the deities, this is when we drive Celestial Court out of our land.” Cultivators from Dao Domain felt their blood boiling with heroic aspirations.

“Something’s off...” Only the ancestors who have lived for quite a while sensed that something was amiss. Alas, this was irrelevant since they were powerless beneath the suppression.

“Good, good!” War Ancient God laughed and said: “Dao Brothers, your intelligence has my admiration.”

This confused all listeners but they still only paid attention to Luminous and West Bank, awaiting the counterattack.

“Let us get started now to prevent needless complications.” War said.

“Go, drive these dogs back to Celestial Court!” Some survivors were still lost in their fantasy and continued to shout.

“This isn’t right...” Most experienced ancestors at this point noticed the strange atmosphere.

“Very well!” Luminous roared and laws from Momentous Dao coiled around him.

The very dao source of the region appeared and blessed him with its dao in the form of a pair of fiery wings. The stars in the sky were still caught by them.

“Rumble!” The ground shook violently as an immortal weapon gradually floated up into the air - Momentous Star.

This was something greater than all emperors and even paragon artifacts. Living beings trembled in dread.

Its immortal rays contained the boundless might of Momentous Dao. Just one alone could sink the continent.

Nine-wheel, Just-once, and the others felt their legs shaking after seeing the weapon capable of killing them regardless of their activated defenses.

“Clank!” Luminous couldn’t help but let out a sigh after grasping the weapon. This was beyond anything he had seen previously.

Of course, there were heavenly treasures in this world - Celestial Court and Immortal Dao City. However, none could actually grasp them to use as a weapon. Their power couldn’t fully be controlled. Thus, the true extent of their potential eluded emperors and conquerors.

Luminous became increasingly emotional since he was wielding a truly unbeatable weapon. Despite being an apex conqueror, he couldn’t have controlled it previously.

Now, since he was connected with Momentous Dao, he could finally use it.

“Can this weapon kill an overlord?” This question popped up in the apex cultivators’ mind.

They thought that Momentous Frontier was blessed by the heaven, to be protected by this amazing artifact.

“Yes!” The unaware survivors still cheered.

“Destroy Celestial Court! Restore Dao City!” Some started chanting.
