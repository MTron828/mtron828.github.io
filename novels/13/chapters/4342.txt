Chapter 4343: Wanting The Treasures

“If you consider yourself virtuous, you would act dignified and stop here. A virtuous person wouldn’t use force to take someone else’s treasures.” Chi Jinlin smiled.

“You!” The young lord’s embarrassment turned into rage. This was a lose-lose situation. Admitting that he’s virtuous would mean giving up on the treasures.

A brief hush took over but he didn’t want to give up so easily.

“Sigh, if no one is going to do anything, then go back home. Otherwise, let’s get this over with so I can leave early.” Li Qiye suddenly spoke.

“You’re not going anywhere until you hand the treasures over!” An expert shouted.

Most found this man too infuriating. How dare he spoke to them contemptuously despite being the leader of such an insignificant sect?

“I already asked, who do I give it to?” Li Qiye smirked.

No one could answer because they didn’t want to become the next target. Directly taking the treasures right now would be the wrong move.

“Fine, here, enjoy.” Li Qiye casually offered one of the gates to the closest cultivator.

In a different scenario, the person would pocket the treasure and run away. Alas, this wasn’t possible so he staggered backward, astounded.

He immediately looked around and was on guard of those around him. He wasn’t stupid and knew that he was in a perilous situation.

“Looks like he doesn’t want them. How about you?” Li Qiye chuckled and offered it to someone else.

This clan member hesitated, not daring to accept the gate. He could feel eyes staring at him.

“Sigh, all of you were so demanding earlier and now, no courage to even take the treasures.” Li Qiye shook his head: “What’s the point of cultivating when there’s so much cowardice? Go be turtles instead and hide in your shell.”

“Enough! Who says I’m a coward?! Give it to me then.” A mighty cultivator furiously roared.

“Really now?” Li Qiye smiled and pushed a gate towards him.

“Yes, it is mine.” He mustered enough courage and reached for the treasure.

He immediately became the center of attention or to be exact, his hand. Countless thought about severing his hand and grabbing the treasure.

“Hmph!” Someone scowled as he was about to grab the gate.

A mighty force pushed the expert away, causing him to stagger to the side.

“What are you doing, Young Lord?!” The expert stabilized and looked around. His expression soured as he roared.

The ambusher was none other than the young lord of Dragon. He naturally didn’t want anyone else to obtain these treasures.

“These are treasures bestowed by the heaven. Dragon will be in charge of dispatching them.” The young lord firmly responded, stating his intention of monopolizing the treasures.

“Young Lord, you are being unreasonable right now.” One disciple became agitated.

“These treasures have no masters, everyone deserves a piece of the pie.” The young lord of Flow commented.

“Whoever can get them deserves them.” The daughter of Soaring Feather joined in.

Though these two supported the young lord a while ago, it was no longer beneficial to do so.

“Hmph!” The young lord waved his hand and suddenly, a cavalry battalion of Dragon immediately rushed onto the scene.

They separated and then surrounded the crowd. When they readied their weapons, the sheer momentum caused ripples in the lake.

The young lord didn’t come alone. He had gone to gather his men, hence his late arrival.

The crowd naturally didn’t like this development. Members from the small sects, in particular, trembled with fear.

Just a moment ago, the young lord tried to be the leader of the young generation. Alas, his attitude shifted the moment these treasures came into play.

“What are you trying to do, Young Lord?” A disciple from a mighty sect questioned.

“Nothing, just trying to calm everyone down. No need to cause bloodshed over a few treasures.” The young lord coldly responded.

This response was rather reasonable and benevolent. Of course, no one believed him.

“Boom!” suddenly, a loud explosion came from the bottom of the lake.

It startled everyone but nothing happened afterward.

“Alright, those who want to stay alive should get as far away as possible from here. Don’t blame me for not warning you all.” Li Qiye glanced down at the lake and told the crowd.

They became irritated. It was one thing for the young lord of Dragon to be arrogant because he could back it up. The same couldn’t be said for this sect master.

They were already livid since the young lord was pressuring them. Now, this became unbearable.

“Ignorant fool, don’t you know that you have one foot in the grave already?! I can push you down if you like!” An expert shouted. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Let’s just kill him first.” A clan disciple joined in.

“No, I agree with him. Everyone should leave right now before anything unsavory happens. Swords do not have eyes.” The young lord actually agreed with Li Qiye this time since it served his purpose.

“Hmph!” One cultivator stomped the ground and begrudgingly left.

“Let’s go.” A minority didn’t want to fight Dragon directly so they left.

Nonetheless, many remained. Though they didn’t want to fight the young lord, they still wanted to stick around.

The young lord ignored them and gazed at Li Qiye: “So, are you going to hand them over or do I have to make you?”

Chi Jinlin who was standing far away frowned. He wanted to speak up but noticed how relaxed Li Qiye was.

“Finally got to the point. Will you try alone or everyone together?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hahaha.” The young lord laughed from being too annoyed: “So courageous. Let’s see what you can actually do then. I doubt you can survive more than three moves.”

His eyes flashed murderously as he declared. The crowd shuddered as a result.
