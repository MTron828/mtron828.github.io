Chapter 5875: Tianji Would Have Embarked Either Way

Voracious was refined, leaving the hopeless Epoch’s End behind.

“And you, any last words?” Li Qiye smiled at the tiny dwarf.

“Going to carry out my wish?” Epoch’s End said.

“That’s wishful thinking.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Then we have nothing to say, do it.” Epoch’s End sighed and said.

“Before you die, I do want to talk on Tianji’s behalf.” Li Qiye said.

Epochs End’s eyes became profound and bright upon hearing this, still looking frightening despite being pinned down.

“What did he say? Did he tell you everything?” He asked.

“No.” Li Qiye responded: “I gathered bits and pieces from the ruins to come up with the truth back then.”

“The truth is simple, I devoured my epoch, that’s all.” Epoch’s End uttered coldly.

“Don’t you think it’s a little funny? You defended your epoch for eras and witnessed its meteoric rise. You claimed to be its guardian and savior, the reason for its success...” Li Qiye said.

“Not claimed. Machine World was but a barren land of savages. I enlightened them with the grand dao, and provided them with peace and prosperity until the rise of machines and civilization. I did it all myself.” He said.

His eyes brimmed with hatred and negative emotions he couldn’t control. They still lingered even now.

“The world didn’t think so, the sages and machines along with countless living beings attributed the dao and laws to Tianji while the most radiant apex belonged to Tianshou. You were the messenger, not the pioneer. You contributed but not to the same extent as Tianji and Tianshou.” Li Qiye said.

“Because they were fools. I, Tianzu, connected heaven and earth, the reason for the golden age.” The years couldn’t fully erase Epoch’s End’s jealousy, hatred, and frustration. This demon had accompanied him all this time.

“Did it ever cross your mind that these so-called savages and their uncivilized epoch might have lasted longer without your interference? Your instructions made the epoch stronger and notable in the river of time, but you destroyed it in the end. Thus, did any of your contributions have meanings?” Li Qiye asked.

“Someone else would have done it if not me.” Epoch’s End retorted.

“Is that how you fill the void in your heart? A fallen overlord should have no feelings but I suppose the hole left behind by a savior doing the opposite is unfillable.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Everything was inevitable, whether it be Tianji’s expedition or the epoch’s destruction.” Epoch’s End said.

“We both know that your demon will always be there after you broke your promise and abandoned yourself. It devoured your heart and instilled unbearable pain.” Li Qiye said.

“I have fallen to the darkness and need no heart. The world can’t judge me.” Epoch’s End raised his voice.

“Then why haven’t you let go, why does the pain of Tianzu remain?” Li Qiye asked.

“I am no longer Tianzu, I am Epoch’s End.” Epoch’s End said.

“Yet your hatred and jealousy toward Tianshou and Tianji are still all there.” Li Qiye said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Epoch’s End’s expression became twisted as he sneered: “They didn’t deserve the love of the epoch. Tianji only cared about his crappy inventions, no one else. Tianshou never took a second look at lesser beings while I did everything for them, I brought salvation and knowledge to Machine World.”

Tianshou, due to his greatness, always had his sight set on the horizon. He never tried to make the world a better place. Alas, he remained the highest pinnacle in Machine World, worshipped by generations as an immortal.

Tianji spent his time attempting to understand the mysteries of the dao. He created merit laws and machines, never interfering with the outside world outside of occasionally passing down his knowledge to a few people.

Tianzu, to his credit, was gifted enough to learn everything Tianji casually taught him. Though the two were brothers in status, they functioned as a master and disciple.

The issue for him was how everyone still believed their cultivation and machines came from Tianji. The light of the epoch originated from his mind, not Tianzu’s.
