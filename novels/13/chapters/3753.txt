Chapter 3754: Evil Devourer Seven Chapters

Force Devourer Art was a part of the seven chapters, one of the best merit laws in Righteous Sect.

Just like its name, it could absorb all offenses regardless of their power. This was the reason why Liu Huaishi was able to stop Chi Xiaoyue’s Blood Moon Ascension with a casual lash.

“Go!” Chi Xiaoyue didn’t give up and released more vitality. A resplendent tsunami emerged with loud fanfare. The blood moon emerged again, still pushing down with an unstoppable momentum along with the maelstrom.

The power of this move was definitely awe-inspiring. The dao lord aura accompanied was oppressive. People couldn’t help shivering with fear.

Liu Huaishi remained calm and performed another lash, issuing metallic clanks. The whip still traveled like a soaring dragon to hit the floating moon.

“Boom!” The power of the moon immediately extinguished, akin to fire met with an overwhelming amount of water again.

After another failed attempt, Chi Xiaoyue trembled once and instantly retreated to keep a safe distance.

The crowd took a deep breath. Chi Xiaoyue’s move was immensely powerful; no one could refute this. However, the whip still effortlessly stopped it.

“It’s inscrutable.” One ancestor concluded.

“Force Devourer can absorb anything. The only way is for the attack to be overwhelming, otherwise, Chi Xiaoyue’s attacks are nothing but delicacies.” An aged high elder added.

Force Devourer was the most effective when used against someone at a similar power level. If the difference was too great, it would no longer work. For example, the current Liu Huaishi wouldn’t be able to absorb an attack from an actual dao lord or peak Heavenly Sovereign. Even if he were to master the art, it still wouldn’t make up for the difference.

The issue here was that the two were evenly matched. Thus, Chi Xiaoyue’s techniques were rendered ineffective.

“What can she do in this situation?” A spectator wondered.

She had her hands tied at the moment, having no better plan against Force Devourer. This was her first time facing the seven chapters from Righteous. There was no previous referencing point.

Of course, in reality, having references and experiences simply didn’t work. She just needed to use overwhelming force. Skills and techniques didn’t matter here.

“Is there a way to defeat these seven chapters?” One youth asked.

“Is there a way to defeat World Crossing?” An ancestor answered rhetorically. [1]

The youth had nothing to say. World Crossing was Dhyana Dao Lord’s technique originating from Buddhamization.

World Crossing and Evil Devourer Seven Chapters were both merit laws at a similar level.

In history, no one has been able to stop World Crossing. One could be stronger and shoulder it but to fully nullify it? Impossible.

Therefore, if solving World Crossing was impossible, the same would apply to Evil Devourer Seven Chapters.

“The seven chapters are worthy of being from a heavenly scripture, it’s truly unique.” Chi Xiaoyue has to admit. [2]

“This is all I have managed to learn. The scion’s attainment is far greater.” Liu Huaishi humbly said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“How many chapters have he learned?” Dugu Lan suddenly spoke.

Ears seemingly became longer as everyone stared at Liu Huaishi. Just one chapter, Force Devourer, was enough for him to stop Chi Xiaoyue. What about Righteous Scion then?”

Liu Huaishi opened his mouth, ready to speak. People became excited right away. However, he smiled and shook his head: “Fairy, my cultivation is too shallow to see through him, I’m afraid.”

He naturally knew that Dugu Lan wanted to pry more information out of him.

People became disappointed but understood his hesitation due to the contest. If he had learned one chapter, then the scion most likely knew two or three.

“Fairy, I can tell you that the scion has learned at least four out of the seven.” Xu Cuimei, who has been standing to the side, suddenly interjected.

The listeners trembled after hearing this. Liu Huaishi with only one chapter seemed strong enough. Even dao lord merit laws were ineffective. What would four chapters be capable of?

Hu Ben and Phantom became serious. They were confident prior but after seeing Force Devourer, their mentality slightly wavered.

Dugu Lan was undeterred. She smiled and said: “Four? Perhaps the scion has learned all seven.”

“That’s one possibility.” Cuimei didn’t deny: “You’re quite knowledgeable.”

“No, it’s just that if the scion wishes to become a dao lord, it’s essential that he knows all seven. That might be the first goal for any disciple from Righteous and a qualification to prove their dao.” Dugu Lan responded.

“Truly logical, impressive.” Xu Cuimei slightly nodded while pondering.

The conversation between these two shocked the crowd. Just four chapters were dreadful already, but the entire thing?

“The scion would be unstoppable, right?” One youth said.

“He’s already unstoppable last year, he swept through all of Righteous.” An expert who has been to Righteous before said.

He wanted to add something else but decided to keep it to himself. He would have said, the scion would sweep through all of the holy ground as well.

However, since so many members of the holy ground were present, that comment would be too offensive.

“So there’s no hope?” The youth quietly said.

The scion was obviously far stronger than Liu Huaishi. His attainment in the seven chapters was at another level. Who would be able to stop him then?

Some stared at Dugu Lan only to find that she was still calm. No emotion could be read.

“Miss Xiaoyue, do we still continue?” Liu Huaishi asked. He had no intention of taking this to the bitter end.

The fight seemed decided already. Accepting defeat might be the better choice.

Nonetheless, just thinking about it was tough for the crowd. This would be the holy ground’s second loss already.

1. Crossing here means delivering, like ferrying or killing or converting. It depends on the context

2. It is still unclear whether heavenly scripture is in its own class as the previous ones or if “heavenly” is just used as an adjective.
