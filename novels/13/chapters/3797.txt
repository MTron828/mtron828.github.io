Chapter 3798: One Suppressive Move

Three moves occurred with one lift of the hand. The pagoda’s suppression, Vajra Dao Lord’s incredible offense, and the Buddhist palm chasing for millions of miles virtually occurred at the same time, too fast compared to the speed of pen and ink.

“Boom!” The poisonous dragon let out a miserable shriek. Though it tried its best, it still couldn’t stop the suppressive pagoda.

It crushed the horn first then the rest of the dragon, reducing it to ashes.

Finally, it pushed the third prince against the ground and continued grinding down, breaking bones and spilling blood.

“Ah!” The prince screamed in pain.

People had no idea whether he would survive or not while hearing his agonizing screams.

At the same time, Vajra Dao Lord’s weapon cut through Hu Ben’s halberd and didn’t slow down in the slightest, smashing onto the great wall. Dao pieces crumbled first then the rest of the wall.

“Crack!” Though the brunt of the attack had been absorbed by the wall, the remaining force was still terrifying. It sent Hu Ben flying while vomiting blood.

His body pierced through numerous peaks as his blood painted the sky in an astonishing manner.

Meanwhile, Phantom was in another dimension and everyone thought that he had managed to escape this disaster.

Unfortunately, that was merely wishful thinking. Buddha Dao Lord’s palm also traveled through space and reached into a deeper dimension. It then pulled out something looking like a crystal sphere with Phantom inside.

“Crack!” He closed his fingers and crushed the spatial sphere.

Though there was no physical contact yet, Phantom couldn’t endure the crushing force. Nonetheless, he mustered everything he had during the split second of the sphere destruction. He leaped up, wanting to escape the palm.

He utilized his movement technique beyond the extreme; his astonishing speed became unimaginable.

Alas, Buddha Dao Lord flipped his palm backward and smashed the ground, leaving a gigantic palm prince.

It destroyed all of Phantom’s defenses so he freefell down and created a gigantic pit. The dirt nearby was covered in blood. Who knows if he was alive or not down there?

Silence took over while people stopped breathing for a moment. This happened too quickly, from Li Qiye’s hand gesture to the defeat of the trio.

They shuddered in astonishment. The young ones, in particular, trembled with fear.

Prior to this, the consensus was that the four great geniuses were the top dogs of the young generation.

Hu Ben proved this after fighting against the scion. Everyone thought that he deserved his reputation. Now, both he and Phantom couldn’t withstand one attack.

Li Qiye simply tossed three Buddhist fruits and gave a command. He never actually participated in the fight.

People turned their focus back to the Buddhist tree. There were still more fruits on the tree. Would he be able to fight the entire world by using them? How many could actually withstand the onslaught?

“Th-this is how it ends?” One genius stammered while looking at the broken battlefield.

The crowd exchanged glances of bewilderment including the powerful ancestors. They confirmed that it wasn’t an illusion because that wouldn’t be enough to injure the trio.

“How the hell did he do it?” The tree and its fruits instilled fear upon the spectators.

Unfortunately, no one could answer this question regardless of their power and knowledge. They could use their best calculation method and it would be of no use.

It would have been simpler if Li Qiye had used a top merit law or weapon to defeat the trio with one move.

But now, Li Qiye simply pinned one branch on the ground and created a Buddhist tree. The fruits from it had incredible effects.

This particular technique was beyond their comprehension limit. A lifetime wasn’t enough to learn something like it.

Alas, Li Qiye didn’t look like he was interested in revealing his process.

“What a supreme ability.” Righteous Scion became emotional after seeing it.

“Perhaps this is an unknown Buddhist law left behind by Dhyana Dao Lord?” One ancestor thought about Li Qiye’s comment prior.

Li Qiye had said that he noticed a Buddhist art while moving the statue down the peak. This could have been left behind by Dhyana Dao Lord.

“Dhyana Dao Lord created another top technique outside of World Crossing? One that’s comparable to it?” Another high elder agreed with this speculation.

“That’s definitely possible.” Others felt the same way and nodded.

This was the only plausible explanation for what had transpired.

“This wasn’t Li Qiye’s actual power, he borrowed the power of the holy ground similar to what Golden Cicada did with World Crossing.” An ancient big shot built on this premise.

People started thinking. Golden Cicada nearly won against the scion by borrowing the Buddhist power of the holy ground.

They thought that Li Qiye might have done something similar. No wonder why the scion made a remark about World Crossing at the start.

“How did Li Qiye obtain this supreme Buddhist art?” The big shots became envious afterward.
