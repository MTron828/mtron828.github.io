Chapter 4269: Tao Xianzi

Sword Burial Ground had five domains. The cauldron came after the graves while the last area was named World. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Li Qiye left the ocean and headed for Sword World. However, he stopped at the border of Sword Cauldron since he noticed a woman - the one appearing back in the haunted city.

Her flawless features made men unable to look away and drove them crazy. Nonetheless, Li Qiye calmly approached the woman.

She seemed to be waiting for him so she turned back to take a closer look with her clear eyes. They were shiny and rippling as if there was a spring coursing through them.

“Waiting for me?” Li Qiye didn’t find this surprising.

She nodded and said: “My name is Tao Xianzi.” [1]

“Tao Xianzi, it’s a nice name.” Li Qiye stated his own: “Li Qiye.”

“Li Qiye.” She tilted her head as her clear eyes became slightly muddled. She tried her best but couldn’t recall. “It’s a familiar name, I think I’ve heard of it before, I should have heard of it…”

“Indeed, there are lingering marks in everything but they can’t last forever. Your name is a perfect fit though.” He said.

“You heard of it before?” She asked sincerely and naively - a stark contrast to her power and flawless appearance.

In theory, she should be imperious and hard to get along with. However, she appeared rather innocent and childish.

“No.” He shook his head. He didn’t tell her that he knew her by another name before.

She looked as beautiful as an immortal in a painting as she was lost in rumination. Even a slight frown stirred the soul.

People would be willing to give up everything for her - kings abandoning their kingdoms. One glance of her left an unforgettable memory.

“Have we met a long time ago?” She asked softly.

“You tell me.” Li Qiye revealed a rare, gentle smile.

She pondered for a while, clearly looking lost. “I don’t know, we haven’t met in my memory but I feel quite familiar with you as if we’ve known each other in a past life.”

“Do you believe in reincarnation?” He asked.

“Not as far as I know because the gods and the dao lords in the past would be trying to do so.” She replied.

“True.” He nodded.

She smiled wryly and continued: “But when I see you, I believe in it a little more, that we have met in our previous life.”

“If you actually had a previous life, do you want to know about it?” He stared at her.

“Hmm…” She hesitated; her eyes brimming with curiosity. “I wonder what type of life I lived then.”

“I’m sure you loved and hated, a life filled with unforgettable memories and many emotions.” He replied.

“Love? What type of man did I fall for?” She asked.

“That depends on your belief. If you want to entertain the notion of a previous life, I will tell you more.” He paused for a bit before continuing: “But if you don’t, there is no point since it’ll interfere with your current path. There is a long way to go, should you let this intangible previous life affect it?”

“You’re right.” She said.

“The decision is yours, I will pass down the memories if you wish to know.” He added.

“Thank you, but no.” She shook her head firmly.

“What is making you abandon the past?” He smiled.

“If we’re assuming that reincarnation is real, then the heavenly dao is giving me a new chance. If that’s the case, no need to dwell on the past, I just need to pursue the present.” She answered.

“Well said!” Li Qiye clapped and praised: “The future is boundless, don’t let worries stop you from reaching higher and walking farther. Everything else are mere images on the river of time.”

“What about you?” She asked. Her innocence made it hard for others to refuse.

The eyes made him sentimental so he responded: “I have no previous or next, only this one.”

“I see.” She stared at him and said: “Then you need to make good use of it.”

He looked up towards the horizon and said: “Yes, only this life to do what must be done. There is no other option.”

“What if you fail?” She asked.

“I will do a great job.” He chuckled, not minding the question.

He spoke calmly and slowly; each word containing absolute confidence and conviction. The characters seemed imprinted into history and time couldn’t erase them.

“I believe you.” She somehow believed in him.

“What will you do afterward?” She continued with another inquiry.

“What about you? Why do you keep attacking Revival Emperor City?” He changed the topic.

“A mission, my destiny.” She said: “I just know that I must go whenever the city appears despite not knowing the reason.”

“Instinct.” He nodded: “Go, follow your heart. There are many others who can’t due to fear and weakness.”

“The mind follows the heart.” She replied.

“This might be what people call destiny, and it’s immensely difficult going against it. Nonetheless, this is still a path towards the dao. You aren’t wrong here.” He replied.

“Thank you.” She thanked him for his guidance.

“Yes, you’re talented enough and are his nemesis, that is your destiny and the reason for reincarnation. The question is, what will you do after destroying the city?” Li Qiye became slightly emotional at the end.

“I haven’t thought of it.” The innocent woman had no answer.

He came closer and gently patted her head: “Don’t be lost and hasty, exercise patience instead. When the time is right, you will know.”

“I understand, it’s the same for you after you finish your task?” She asked.

“Me? Perhaps, we will see when that day comes.” His gaze returned to the end of the world - the place of his final mission.

“Okay.” Her eyes appeared brighter than before.

“I have to go now. Thank you, may we meet again.” She said before bowing.

“May we meet again.” He nodded.

Her figure flashed once and disappeared from sight along with the sweet fragrance in the air.

Li Qiye stared in her direction. The pain, the training, the previous life - all were still sealed deep in memories.

“If the past is too heavy of a burden, just let it pass. This is where death is a better outcome, at least one will be able to forget. Goodbye, little one.” He reflected.

1. Translation would be Peach Fairy. Given the narrative, this should be a name, not title. This is a pretty tacky and uncommon name if given by parents or self-proclaimed. This could really go either way, but given the conversation, keeping it as a name. ?
