Chapter 5263: Rope Play?

Li Qiye returned to the courtyard and lay back on his long chair, rocking it back and forth.

“Did you have fun?” The old man’s chair was also creaking.

“I would probably have more fun digging up your corpse.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Asshole.” The old man cursed.

“Don’t misunderstand, I just want to take it out and refine it into a world or an unbeatable weapon. I’m sure it can be comparable to the nine Heavenly Treasures.” Li Qiye elaborated: “Hmm, this is not a bad idea at all. If it’s an independent domain, it’ll be greater than Celestial Court.”

“Get the hell out!” The old man shouted.

“I’m serious, don’t you think it’s a damn waste just leaving your corpse here. Every part is a heavenly treasure.” Li Qiye didn’t mind.

“Mmm, fine, if you will accept a condition of mine.” The old man seemingly glanced at Li Qiye despite still having his eyes closed.

“No thanks, definitely nothing good will come from this. Plus, I don’t need anything either.” Li Qiye refused.

“Hmph.” The old man snorted: “Think about it first and you can come back to me later.” 

“No need, at our level, your condition will be shocking. I don’t need another problem.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Coward.” The man said with disdain.

“Whatever you say, psychological tricks don’t work on me. Plus, being a coward nowadays is a good thing since cowards live forever. They just need to hide in their shell until everything passes by.” Li Qiye said.

The old man dropped the issue. After a long while, he asked: “Have you eaten a metal giant like that one before?”

“No, my taste isn’t as heavy as yours.” Li Qiye said.

“We ate one in the past and it was nothing short of extraordinary. I can’t believe there are still some left.” The old man said: “Crunchy and satisfying, when you dig out the core for a bite, a tremendous amount of primal electric dao course through you, it doesn’t get any better than that.” 

“Perverts getting pleasure from electrocution. Maybe all of you were into some rope play too.” Li Qiye said.

“Please, you won’t be singing the same tune after getting a taste, you’ll be obsessed with it afterward.” The old man said.

“No thanks.” Li Qiye refused.

“Have you ever thought about the future? If you ever defeat the villainous heaven, just imagine how tasty he is, utterly unmatched.” The old man said.

“I’m not and will never be into eating corpses.” Li Qiye said.

“This is just a part of life. Humans eat chicken and ducks, are those not corpses? Even if you’re a vegetarian, fruits are corpses as well, just in a different form.” The old man smiled.

“I understand the reasoning.” Li Qiye rubbed his nose: “I don’t want to hear it from your dog mouth though. Even flowery words become tainted when they came from you.”

“I just don’t see the issue. You, are an apex being, others are mere insects in comparison, no different from chicken and duck. They’re all meals, the only difference is the ingredient chosen.” The old man paused for a bit before continuing: “You can use a more euphemistic term, instead of people or corpses, call them delicacies or gourmet dishes.” 

“Old man, you are relentless.” Li Qiye smiled: “I see why some peerless cultivators fell to the darkness, it’s because they hear whispers from you, instigated and fooled by this kind of rhetoric. Notions that the heaven is heartless and all things are fodders, that reaching the grand dao is the ultimate goal, nothing else matters. In my opinion, they’re mere excuses for unleashing the darkness in the heart.”

“The foundation of your argument is hypocritical.” The old man shook his head: “Eating is a natural instinct, why suppress and romanticize it? Earliest humans consumed raw meat and drank blood, cannibalism was not rare.” 

“This is evolution.” Li Qiye said: “Refinement is essential to reach a higher realm, eliminate impure thoughts and maintain the dao heart. If I only care about consumption, we wouldn’t be sitting here conversing right now. You would have been holding my head and relishing the taste or maybe, I wouldn’t have gotten far enough to that point in the first place.”

“Well, I admit that there is some truth to your path.” The old man nodded: “Nonetheless, shouldn’t you prove your conviction by trying it once? People with an unconventional taste only need a starting catalyst, the first bite to start the insatiable indulgence.” 

“When are you going to give up on this idea? You alone can’t drag me into the darkness.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You can only say all of this because you won.” The old man gave up: “Sigh, you need a catalyst, perhaps it will be him or the villainous heaven.”

“You’re mistaken. I’ve seen enough of the villainous heaven and I am still fine. The wavering of the dao heart is due to the self, unrelated to external matters. Falling into the darkness because of reasons? Mere excuses for a personal failure. If I remain steadfast, everything else is only water flowing through an immovable boulder.” Li Qiye said.

“Immovable boulder? You’re more like a stone stuck in a dung pit, stubborn and smelly.” The old man said.

“That’s fine. The stone is certainly despised but it won’t change just because there is shit around it nor will it change because of others’ opinions. It will remain a stone regardless of whether it smells good or otherwise.” Li Qiye said.

“Forget it, I’m done. This bone is too hard to gnaw through.” The old man gave up.

“The villainous heaven tried too, don’t feel bad about this.” Li Qiye said.

“Sigh, it’s a shame that I won’t be able to watch you bring down the villainous heaven, or vice versa.” the old man lamented: “How about this, take one of my eyes with you so that I can watch?”

“No, that’s not a fetish of mine.” Li Qiye immediately refused.

“It’s negotiable, you know I won’t make you do it for nothing.” The old man smiled.

“I’m not interested in anything.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Don’t be so sure, I’ve lived for a long time and have access to things that you don’t.” The old man said.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“True.” Li Qiye nodded: “But if I really care enough, I can dig out your corpse and take whatever I want, it’ll just be a lengthy and cumbersome process.” 

“Asshole.” The old man cursed again.

“That’s why I kept on telling you about how merciful I am. I can’t bring myself to do such cruel acts.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“Haha, you’re about as merciful as a prostitute is loyal.” The old man chuckled.
