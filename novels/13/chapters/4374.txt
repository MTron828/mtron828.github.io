Chapter 4375: Phoenix Roost

The roost was located in a minor dimension. The entrance was guarded by numerous experts and ancestors.

As they got closer, the monarch told Li Qiye: “The roost is a place for dao comprehension. Since you are not a disciple of Dragon, Young Noble, I have to accompany you.”

Normally, only geniuses recognized by the ancestors were allowed to come inside the roost to learn. They would come alone because they must rely on themselves. Seniors weren’t allowed to interfere.

Since Li Qiye was an outsider, the elders forbade him from doing this. They required the monarch to travel with him.

They worried that he might do something detrimental to the roost. Thus, the monarch was there to keep an eye on him.

“Is there a difference?” Li Qiye didn’t mind at all and moved forward.

The monarch followed along and found Li Qiye’s goal quite strange. He had offended Peacock Monarch but instead of dealing with this issue, he chose to go to the roost first.

Could it be treasures, merit laws, or just dao comprehension? In that case, he would have been better off heading to Demon Realm Palace instead of the roost.

Did he know some secrets and mysteries about this place? Thus, the monarch was very curious and wanted to tag along.

According to the rumors, anyone lucky enough to enter always got something out of it. The most famous of them all was none other than Divine Luan Dao Lord.

She entered the roost and comprehended something amazing, allowing her to become a dao lord later on. Thus, its value to Phoenix Ground was immensely high.

However, one would be sorely mistaken if they thought that the roost was a paradise. Anyone entering for the first time would be disappointed after seeing its appearance.

It was nothing like their imagination, devoid of immortal mist and fog or anything transcending. There were no dao transformation and harmony either…

There was only a small hill that wouldn’t take too long to climb. The soil was red and ashen, seemingly scorched in the past. This was a combination of ashes and dirt.

The hill didn’t look special outside of not having a single blade of grass. On the peak was a hollowed section in the shape of a pot. A pile of ashes was stacked inside.

Upon closer inspection, there were still burning branches and firewood, only the size of an arm or so. They were half-burned and extinguished right after getting through the bark.

Anyone would be disappointed after seeing this place due to a lack of magical scenes. After all, this started the quest for a dao lord.

It should have golden springs, myriad laws morphing and changing, the sounds of the grand dao, divine flowers blossoming, and the rotation of the celestials…

However, there was nothing here, not even a blade of grass. Disciples from Phoenix Ground would certainly have mixed feelings after coming here.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, crouched down in front of the firewood. He reached and touched them, realizing that they have turned into glazed stones. The ashes turned out to be stony specks as well.

This could also extend to the rest of the hill. At first, one would mistake the ground for a mixture of dirt and ashes. However, they seemed to be a type of precious stone.

Touching the “firewood” didn’t move them at all. They were one with the hill itself, a type of stone that has grown out of the ground, or that everything was a single piece.

It would be more accurate to call this place the Phoenix Stone. There was no roost to speak of here.

“Ancestors for generations believe that this is a phoenix stone.” The monarch said softly while staring at the ruminating Li Qiye: “It looked like a roost up here at first, hence the name.”

“Have you meditated here?” Li Qiye patted the firewood stone and asked.

“Young Noble, I certainly did during my youth after being acknowledged by the ancestors.” The monarch nodded.

“What did you learn?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Nothing noteworthy. I meditated for three years. The first two years were uneventful. As for the third, I felt something warm coursing through my body, seemingly burning my chaos energy and smoothing the flow.” The monarch smiled wryly.

“This chance certainly helped my cultivation but it’s still limited.” He added.

Most wouldn’t talk about the details of their cultivation. They would only share it with their closest and most trusted but he still revealed it to Li Qiye.

“It has to be my limited talent, not to the level of the sages before me. I only felt the warmth, not the burning sensation. Our ancestor, Sacred Luan, had his bloodline evolved through this.” He admitted.

“That’s not all.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “An actual flame can manifest this place too.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Young Noble, you do know everything. Yes, that is possible but it only happened once.” The monarch smiled wryly, not expecting Li Qiye to know this.

“Divine Luan Dao Lord, that is what happened when she trained here.” Li Qiye went on.
