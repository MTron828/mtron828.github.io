Chapter 5026: Hellfire Blade

“Resplendent Smash!” Jun Cuican decided to attack instead of hesitating.

Energy gathered above and turned into a divine hammer. It continued to grow in size and power with no end in sight.

Jun Cuican only had four sacred fruits but this technique seemingly contained the power of an eight-fruit dragon lord.

“Luminous Law!” Spectators were afraid of this infinite potential.

This merit law was created by Luminous Conqueror - a special battle technique capable of raising its user’s power dozens of times.

“Boom!” As he swung the hammer down, the sheer momentum crushed several peaks nearby. Birds and beasts screamed as they were reduced to blood.

It struck Li Qiye and pulverized the area beneath him to the spectators’ horror. This was akin to smashing an ant with a great hammer.

However, Li Qiye himself was perfectly fine since he blocked the energy hammer with one hand. It felt like a cotton branch more than anything due to how easy he made it look.

“Boom!” He clenched his fingers and crushed the energy hammer, sending Jun Cuican flying from the explosion.

He smashed through one peak after another, disappearing beneath the rubbles. The light barrier most likely prevented him from exploding into pieces.

“Light, descend!” Radiant Monarch appeared above Li Qiye. His aura blinded the crowd.

He stole all the lights from the entire world and sent them down in the form of a majestic pulse.

“Boom!” It immediately created a crater beneath Li Qiye, turning everything in its path into smoke. Defenses, merit laws, and treasures were all useless.

This move was impressive enough for the crowd to think that it had a chance of injuring Li Qiye.

Alas, as he was bathing in it, he opened his mouth and sucked in the devasting pulse.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Rumble!” Demon shook violently as Radiant Monarch continued the onslaught.

Nonetheless, Li Qiye didn’t have any problem absorbing this affinity. Eventually, he started glowing and spewed out an opposing pulse.

His offense gained ground and pushed the monarch’s pulse back. The latter roared and summoned the power of the light. Alas, he was still being repelled up into the air.

Remember, he had cultivated this affinity his entire life and turned himself into a light source of immense power.

“Immeasurable Light, Light Armor!” He panicked since the pulse was about to hit his chest.

He utilized two techniques at the same time. The pre-existing light barrier gathered into a single point in front of him to stop the pulse while he summoned a resplendent armor.

“Boom!” The focused barrier instantly collapsed but it had bought him enough time to escape through a spatial gap.

Alas, the pulse followed and smashed him back into the current dimension, piercing through his chest.

Fortunately for him, the light also had a healing effect. It engulfed his wounds and they closed in no time at all.

The crowd clamored since the monarch nearly died to his own technique - the same result as the two dragon lords before him.

“My turn.” Wild Dragon summoned a curved saber covered in sharp dragon scales, still undeterred after witnessing Li Qiye's power.

Smoke and lava oozed from the cracks between the scales. Each drop of lava could scorch the earth. Wherever they met the earth, they burned through and left behind bottomless pits.

This saber seemed to be a tool of hell - capable of incinerating all existences. People could smell the stench of death and hear the laments of its victims.

“Hellfire Blade!” Someone shouted the name of this weapon that had claimed countless lives.
