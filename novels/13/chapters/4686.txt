Chapter 4687: Wild Paragon

The two regained their wits and started a pursuit as well. Meanwhile, the crowd was left astounded since their opinion of the vajra shifted several times in one event.

“Such a strange man.” One expert commented.

“Shameless, yes, but at least he’s rather courageous.” An ancestor evaluated.

Just a while ago, some believed that he didn’t deserve the title of being number one, that he merely rode the coattails of True Immortal to fame.

This turned out to be wildly inaccurate because if it was true, he wouldn’t have been able to defeat True Immortal Sect Master or escape from Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Right, few in the world dare to oppose True Immortal and take their desired item.” A big shot admitted.

“He definitely has no moral though.” Someone else picked a different complaint since his power and courage have been proven.

The vajra was indeed different from those belonging to the great powers. The latter had specific codes during battles. However, the vajra did everything possible to win.

“The old geezer is hard to read.” Jian Ming said.

The daoist nodded in agreement: “His actual background is a mystery. I personally don’t think he’s a vagabond.”

“More than that, his background is impressive.” Li Qiye smiled and moved on.

The duo hurriedly gave chase. Jian Ming became curious and asked: “Young Noble, what is his background?”

“An ancient lineage on a decline.” Li Qiye smiled.

Jian Ming glanced at Li Qiye and saw a strange expression. He felt that Li Qiye was somehow close to this lineage.

With the vajra gone, the crowd also dispersed.

“Let’s go find him, no more wasting time.” A big shot went on the move.

Many ancestors entered the union this time. Some came to nest and others wanted to improve their dao. However, the goal for quite a large number was the same as before - Golden Fist Emperor and the gemstone.

As cultivators scurried among the wilderness, they heard a loud boom from a dao eruption. The source came from a peak with a myriad dao beams shooting upward. A “myriad” was actually literal this time, not just a vague description.

Countless runes appeared, resulting in a magnificent spectacle. They seemed to be celebrating something. Next came a dao melody and many cultivators felt their own grand dao resonating happily with it. A flood of chaos true energy surged out, eventually forming an ocean.

“Rumble!” The overarching radiance continuously intensified. Eventually, a youth appeared, looking rather mighty with three heads and six arms.

Normally, this would be a frightening sight but due to the presence of the dao, he looked divine and dominating. He held a different treasure with each hand - a sword, banner, jewel, mirror…

The treasure each had a unique property and light. Nonetheless, they were equally powerful.

“Boom!” The strongest aura of a Heavenly Sovereign emanated from him and swept through this independent domain. Those nearby felt as if they have just been hit by a tsunami.

“Myriad Sovereign, actual ten thousand dao!” An expert shouted: “He has proven himself and is on the way to the true apex!”

Heavenly Sovereigns cultivated the dao after the golden level. The more dao they had, the stronger.

Becoming a Myriad Dao Sovereign meant achieving an important milestone. Some considered this to be the start of supremacy. Anything before this realm was trivial in comparison.

“Wild Paragon, the number one genius of the east.” A youth recognized him.

“Right, the saint child of Desolate Sacred Ground.” Another chimed in.

“Your information is outdated, he has been serving as the sect master for a long time now.” An eastern cultivator shook her head.

“Wait, isn’t the number one genius of the east Five-sun King?” An unaware cultivator became confused.

“That’s later on.” The eastern cultivator explained: “Wild Paragon debuted earlier than Five-sun King. The latter didn’t show up until after Wild Paragon was rather famous. He swept through the young generation uncontested and only lost to Five-sun King by a little bit. With that, he pleaded loyalty and joined the king’s banner.”

“He’s the youngest of the eight paragons under Five-sun King. He should be listed under the thirty-six sovereigns but he’s too strong for that, hence the upper classification.” Another explained.

“So he’s the strongest of the paragons?” Someone asked.

“No, that’s hard to say. He’s just the youngest.” The eastern cultivator said.

“It is widely believed that he is only a tiny bit weaker than Five-sun King. If he had chosen the dao lord path, he might actually be competitive with the five conquerors since he had more time training.” A clan member said.
