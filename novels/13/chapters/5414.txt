Chapter 5415: Human Sacrifice

The news of the sacrifice forced both regular cultivators to conquerors to react accordingly.

Of course, regular cultivators’ actions and plans had no effect on the outcome since this was a top-level matter. They were mere ants in comparison, doomed to be killed during the great wars.

Illumination Conqueror opened the gates to his illusory grotto, allowing spectators to observe the event.

All entry points were heavily guarded with imperial formations and seals. The runes circled continuously and were protected by dragon lords and conquerors. Illumination gathered all of his supporters for the sake of sacrificing Ye Fantian.

Big shots from both sides arrived and kept a distance, aiming to see the next development. They knew that this would be the actual breaking of the Pact of Blessed. From then on, they might have to greet each other with drawn blades.

Emperors and monarchs, dao lords and conquerors, and many more illustrious characters gathered from a distance.

They understood that Heaven and Divine Alliance weren’t going to let Illumination Conqueror carry out this ceremony uncontested. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

For Divine Alliance, Ye Fantian was guaranteed to be an apex conqueror. Moreover, this would ruin their reputation as well.

As for Heaven Alliance, it served as the pillar of The Race - the target of Illumination Conqueror. The ceremony was a direct challenge against them.

Thus, they certainly had a common enemy this time around.

“Can Illumination Conqueror actually handle this?” A top dragon lord wondered.

His grotto’s defense was fully activated, turning it into an impregnable fortress. Regular sects had no chance of breaking through.

However, his enemies were anything but “regular”. They included apex cultivators such as Supreme and Swordsea Dao Lord.

His grotto would surely face the full wrath of both alliances. Nonetheless, he still chose to publicize the act - a truly puzzling decision.

“Don’t underestimate him since he had faced Heaven Alliance before. Moreover, his supporters are devoted to the point of being fanatics as well. That might be enough to defend against the incoming assault.” A lord had an optimistic opinion of Illumination, thinking that he had survived numerous conflicts in the past.

“The madman is trying to rise again, so reckless and willing to risk it all.” A conqueror observed the defensive lines within the grotto.

It included the famous Devil and Riverwalker Conqueror.

“He’s ready to die for a good cause.” A conqueror had a good idea of the forces beyond. Illumination had grown desperate after failing several times recently. This was his last attempt - either success or death.

“He has no other move to make on the board.” A dragon lord sighed and said.

“It’s due to his own obsession that he’s alienated. His followers right now are extremists as well, they probably don’t care for The People’s wellbeing.” Someone sneered.

“I can see that.” Another commented: “Some are probably stuck in their realm, feeling rather bored. They are using a heroic pretense to satisfy their killing urge.”

Illumination’s influence waned ever since his abdication after Emperors War. Only regular cultivators would view him as the guardian of The People.

As for top cultivators, they had their own pursuits and would only follow a winner. After all, why would they risk their lives and listen to someone else for a failed cause?

Illumination was aware of this, hence this reckless attempt at rebuilding his image and prestige. Capturing Ye Fantian was the first step; sacrificing her was even better.

He had confidence in taking down the incoming attackers, once again fortifying his position as the leader of The People.

Meanwhile, Ye Fantian was still imprisoned in All-things Dao Lord’s dao cage, placed on top of an altar.

She remained calm despite knowing the upcoming sacrificial ceremony.
