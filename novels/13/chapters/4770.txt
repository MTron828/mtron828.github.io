Chapter 4771: That Thing

The phenomena from the union frightened cultivators. The hidden lords, on the other hand, whispered among themselves due to a secret unknown to others.

“Did Dao Sanqian do something like this back then, entering the dao source of the union?” An ancestor quietly asked.

Before becoming a supreme lord, the young Dao Sanqian was rumored to have reached the source of the primordial. No one could verify this. Nonetheless, he did become immensely successful afterward.

Therefore, legends regarding this source existed. One included it granting a great fortune, allowing one to possess a long lifespan and peerless power.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Seeing the source is more than just a fortuitous event.” A high ancestor from an ancient clan said: “This is a pathway to the mysteries of the grand dao, it is as peerless as can be.”

“Could you elaborate?” A junior ancestor became startled.

The ancestors nearby thought that Dao Sanqian’s achievement was already incredible, becoming a virtually eternal existence. Was there something greater than this?

“The mythical primordial tree.” The high ancestor whispered.

One ancestor blurted out: “It is actually real? Not just a legend?”

Peerless existences have heard of such a tree - the source of all the grand dao in Eight Desolaces.

From novice cultivators to the strongest, all of their grand dao and laws originated from this tree, the same for all the dao sources since they lack the dao fruits.

“It might not be a legend. Dao Sanqian has entered the union many times in history, not just once.” The high ancestor said.

“But he found the primordial source already.” A junior ancestor asked.

“From what I’ve seen of his subsequent actions, he only touched a branch, not the actual source. He is still searching for it.” The high ancestor responded.

“He’s still looking for a higher power? Is this the way to surpass the dao lords?” Another ancestor took a deep breath.

“Not necessarily, his ambition might extend further than that. He wants to enter the source and find the primordial tree. By meditating there, he hopes to obtain an unprecedented achievement in the dao.” The high ancestor explained.

“The entrance to the tree is there?” Everyone became emotional and understood why Dao Sanqian has been searching for the source.

“It is rumored to be one of the shortcuts, I don’t know how true it is.” The high ancestor said.

“So how many figures have been known to reach the tree?” One ancestor asked.

“Only the elites of elites. Puresun Dao Lord has obtained a dao fruit while training under the tree. Then there’s the duck egg buyer too.” The high ancestor said.

There was another name that the high ancestor didn’t say - Zhan, the final Immortal Emperor. She was already an emperor once she reached tree. Nonetheless, she still searched for the dao and obtained a dao fruit while maintaining her imperial status. This particular legend was prominent and widespread.

The titles of the Immortal Emperors from the last epoch have been forgotten. She was one of the rare exceptions. Moreover, during the great calamity, she was there to protect the world. Though many dao lords appeared subsequently, her fame still overshadowed theirs.

“I wonder if it’s real.” An ancestor murmured about these legends.

Not to mention them, even dao lords rarely made it there with the exception of the three stated prior. Most importantly, they existed long ago so records have been lost with time. Skepticism arose as a result.

After all, if the invincible dao lords couldn’t find it, perhaps it wasn’t real. Nonetheless, powerful cultivators continued to search for the tree, hoping to obtain one of its fruits.

“Is that what Li Qiye is doing?” Another asked.

The high ancestor nodded: “He is qualified to do so. I bet he’ll be able to find the tree, given his invincibility.”

The juniors remained silent because Li Qiye’s power has broken everyone’s sense of logic. Maybe finding the tree wasn’t a big deal for him at all.

On the other hand, the dark overlords and other supreme existences became startled.

“He wants to take that thing.” A terrifying creature in the shadows whispered.

The high elder’s suspicion of Li Qiye wanting to meditate under the tree was shocking enough. However, these eternal existences had a different conclusion.

They knew certain secrets unavailable to regular cultivators. In this case, the Primordial Union had an unimaginable item.

They didn’t care for dao lord weapons or even dao lord paragon weapons. Why? Because some of them had access to epoch paragon weapons.

Nonetheless, they still desired the thing in the union almost as much as everlasting life. Alas, both were out of reach.

They have tried many times before but Li Qiye had made preparations - opening the heaven’s window to ready the tribulations. This was a risk they couldn’t afford.

Thus, they have tried to come up with different strategies. Unfortunately, none proved sufficient.

Today, Li Qiye was heading there for it, causing them to be trembling with various emotions. That thing was about to appear in the world.

“He should not obtain it. Otherwise…” An existence in Highest Wild communicated with the others.

Li Qiye himself was at a dreadful level. If he were to obtain this thing as well…

For them at least, its value far exceeded the gauntlet at its perfect state. The master of the gauntlet couldn’t obtain this thing but they could.
