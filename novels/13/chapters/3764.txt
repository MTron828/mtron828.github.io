Chapter 3765: I Am Unbeatable

“Go.” The scion smiled as he glanced at the surroundings, still looking composed.

“Open the fortress!” Hu Ben glared at his foe and roared.

This confused some spectators. The gate was open, what did he mean by that?

Loud rumbles and dazzling lights occurred in the next moment. The entire fortress started quaking and the area beneath the scion suddenly sank downward.

In fact, the fortress was below ground now, creating something akin to a large cooking pot with the scion in the center.

The fortress itself was sleek and smooth like a mirror before the astonished spectators.

“What is going on?” Most were confused.

“I heard the sovereigns spent a lot of time preparing this back then, Meteoric Beam. It’s rarely used.” One ancestor said with a solemn tone.

The scion in the center wasn’t frightened at all. He was cool and collected despite knowing that a sure-kill move was coming.

“Be careful, Scion. We’ll be starting the mechanism soon.” Hu Ben said.

“I know, go ahead, I’m ready for it.” The scion smiled.

“Start!” Hu Ben scowled and declared.

“Buzz.” Something seemed to be rubbing against the mirror-like surface of the fortress, causing it to become even brighter.

An unknown power has been activated and time suddenly halted. Everyone saw a magnificent scene in this split second. Everything was frozen in the vicinity including the lights.

The latter suddenly turned into countless arrows. At the same time, the ground beneath the scion emitted an irresistible sucking force. All the light arrows started shooting towards him at an unbelievable speed.

They twisted together to form great beams with enough destruction to pierce through all affinities. Even the hardest substance would be reduced to nothingness. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The spectators were amazed because this was a method consisting of borrowing the powers of the word. Moreover, the scion’s location has been locked on. Dodging and fleeing weren’t possible this late into the attack.

The beams came from above just like lightning bolts. If they made contact, they would pierce his head.

“Boom!” The beams made direct contact, washing over the scion like heavenly waterfalls and drowning him.

“Nice!” One spectator shouted after seeing the direct hit on the scion’s head. The destructive power of the beams was unquestionable.

Everyone in the crowd thought that their head would instantly explode upon contact.

“Meteoric Beam, that sounds about right.” Another spectator said.

The members of the holy ground became excited and felt great about the situation.

One opened his eyes wide and stared at the beams: “Will he die from this?”

Most thought that he would definitely survive due to his mighty strength. However, injuries should be possible.

“Rumble!” The beams were suddenly pushed up. The spectators clearly saw the scion become enveloped in a pulsing divine light brimming with dao laws.

This defensive barrier fully nullified the beams. He started pushing the beams upward, going against the currents.

The confrontation of the two forces resulted in loud explosions and earthquakes.

“I can’t believe it.” Someone commented. The scion faced the attack directly with his own power, letting the beams actually hit him.

“That’s Righteous Scion for you.” Others took a deep breath.

“He’s very close to reaching the golden avatar. He’ll become an heir soon and will have a chance to prove his dao.” One ancestor remarked.

It became obvious that the scion has broken through the Grand Dao Sacred Physique realm.

After breaking through this realm, cultivators would have two paths. The first was Dao Lord Golden Avatar; the other was Myriad-dao Heavenly Physique.

The scion chose the dao lord path and has become an heir - a potential candidate for the next dao lord.

“He’s uninjured.” The young geniuses could see that the scion wasn’t trying his hardest.

“This attempt isn’t bad but it can’t defeat me.” The scion laughed heartily while pushing the beams upward.

The fact that he could still speak while being suppressed by the beam impressed the hostile audience.

“Damn, so this is the number one genius.” One commenter said with admiration.

Hu Ben’s expression turned ugly. This move from the fortress massacred numerous invaders before. Unfortunately, it didn’t leave a single wound on Righteous Scion.

“Anything else? Go for it.” The scion said, ignoring the beams fixated on him.
