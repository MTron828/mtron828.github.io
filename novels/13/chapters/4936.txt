Chapter 4937: Impossible

The old man was indeed made of wood. However, the exact origin remained unknown since people didn’t know whether he was a tree demon or a natural-born spirit tree.

Of course, no one questioned his power. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to keep the sack filled with treasures.

Conquerors and dragon lords had no further information either. They believed that he was deeply related to the academy or was a secret top-ranking member.

They recalled how Celestial Court sent emperors here but a single palm slain several in the blink of an eye. He was one suspect.

The academy and he never talked about this issue. He came and left in a hurry each time, never answering any questions.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, found something off about him.

“You shouldn’t be in this world.” He furrowed his brows.

Yunyun watched quietly, thinking that Li Qiye might be the only one who would knock the forehead of this mighty being.

“The worlds were one once.” He said.

“No need to tell me this, I know.” Li Qiye shook his head before asking: “I need to use you as a connection to see certain things.”

This was a command, not a request. Yunyun became startled again.

“Fine, I want to sense you though.” The old man didn’t refuse.

“Very well.” Li Qiye agreed.

The old man placed his palm on Li Qiye’s forehead while murmuring: “So familiar, we’ve definitely met before.”

“That depends on who created you.” Li Qiye said: “I’m starting the connection now.”

“I agree.” The old man said.

Li Qiye shot out a tiny primordial law from his finger. The moment it appeared, Yunyun became immobilized fully and felt how insignificant she was.

He then touched the old man's forehead, allowing the law to enter and creating a pulsing light. The old man's forehead became a gathering point for time, space, and all laws, creating a maelstrom that allowed Li Qiye to travel through endless distances and time to reach a place beyond anyone's reach.

Meanwhile, Yunyun felt her soul leaving her body and felt like nothing more than a speck of dust, unable to even scream in terror.

“Buzz.” He used the maelstrom to travel through different dimensions, worlds, and timelines, seamlessly crossing from one to the next.

“Pop!” The special pathway suddenly crumbled, the same for the dao maelstrom.

Li Qiye staggered several steps backward and became surprised: “How is it in this world? What is going on here?”

The old man’s eyes suddenly shifted once and scared the hell out of Yunyun. These eyes were not his and had the ability to reduce this world into nothingness.

“We need to speak.” The old man’s voice became different, seemingly coming from the past. It took an incalculable period of time for it to reach their ears.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye nodded: “I did not expect this, you shouldn’t be here.”

“I have no other choice.” The ancient voice responded.

“So be it, I will travel there.” Li Qiye agreed.

“I’ll be waiting.” The voice said, growing increasingly distant.

The old man then trembled for a bit as he regained his wits and asked: “Do you understand now, Young Noble?”

“Yes, a visit is required.” Li Qiye said.

"We'll be waiting.” The old man said, before quickly taking control of the deer and disappearing into the horizon with the carriage, leaving no time to waste. The pleasant sound of the carriage bells faded into the distance.

Yunyun could finally breathe afterward, finding herself to be drenched in a cold sweat. It felt like a nightmare where she was completely powerless.

“Young Noble, what happened just now?” She asked.

He didn't respond and looked upward, lost in thought. Yunyun could tell that something significant had occurred.

“Boom!” Suddenly, they heard the sounds of battle coming from afar.

Saber slashes could be seen in the air. One wave was strong enough to destroy Radiant Young Monarch’s aura.

It came from a middle-aged man in possession of a mighty saber intent.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Why is he here?” Yunyun was surprised to see him for he was none other than Ascension Sacred Lord.

So it turned out that Bai Shaojin accidentally activated the vessel and its phenomena. He tried to stop it but it was too late.

The young monarch came to capture him but Ascension Sacred Lord came out of nowhere for an attack.

Initially, the latter came for Yunyun and has been in hiding, not daring to cause trouble in the academy.

However, he saw the radiance of the vessel and wanted to rob Shaojin; the young monarch got in the way.

Thus, a battle ensued between two one-fruit dragon lords. Their auras immobilized the students, preventing anyone else from interfering.
