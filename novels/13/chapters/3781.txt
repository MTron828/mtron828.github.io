Chapter 3782: Boundless Buddhist Art

The ancient and peaceful bell tolls turned the world into a paradise.

Alas, the more-capable cultivators were scared out of their mind, not wanting to drown in this peace.

This was the power of conversion. For the experts here, they would be without physical injuries even during a forceful conversion. Alas, it would have negative effects on their mind, going as far as weakening their dao heart in the future.

The bell tolls were only the beginning. As they permeated the land, Buddhist light spanned for ten million miles.

Various rays floated in the air like threads and bathed everyone with motherly warmth. This feeling was nothing short of pure happiness and true satisfaction. They slowly closed their eyes to enjoy this unprecedented moment.

Numerous cultivators became immersed in the light, losing awareness of their current situation. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As for the powerful ancestors and high elders, they maintained their wits but were still shaken.

“Time to leave!” Many fled to a safe distance while taking their juniors with them.

After leaving the radius of the light, they finally relaxed to watch the fight.

“That was close.” One ancestor had cold sweat all over. Powerful beings like them had a hard time dealing with this affinity.

Most importantly, World Crossing hasn’t fully activated yet.

“What’s going on?” The juniors taken away were confused by the change of scenery and looked around.

“World Crossing is truly powerful. No wonder why Dhyana Dao Lord never needed to fight in the legends. All of his foes submitted wherever he went.” An ancestor said.

A junior like Golden Cicada using World Crossing was so effective already. What about the dao lord himself? The legends might be true.

With the influx of the light and bell tolls, diagrams appeared above the temples in the region.

Heavenly Dragon Temple wasn’t a single architecture, just another name for Heavenly Dragon Division. It consisted of around 88,000 temples or so and all of them were activated with diagrams and runic characters.

This was truly a magnificent and shocking spectacle. These images and characters turned the area into a Buddhist Kingdom, no longer recognizable compared to before.

The majestic Buddhist affinity could be felt in this great kingdom. The conversion force grew stronger.

The weaker cultivators within the radius started prostrating in the direction of Golden Cicada.

“Amitabha.” An image of a supreme Buddha appeared in the kingdom along with a chant.

The stars seemed to be rotating around this being; the vast cosmos flowed next to him. He exceeded everything in size, capable of grasping the world in his palm.

The chant released a higher concentration of light. Many cultivators were immediately turned into pious followers by this great Buddhist Lord.

“Merciful Buddha.” They prostrated on the ground with tears streaming down their cheeks.

The conversion affinity was solely focused on Righteous Scion. Nonetheless, the remnant waves still affected those nearby. These waves had limited power but they were still caught and converted.

Those who managed to get away stared at the prostrating mass in astonishment. Golden Cicada could have converted all of them without any difficulty.

“So strong...” A young cultivator turned pale.

“World Crossing is from a heavenly scripture, its power far exceeds a regular dao lord merit law.” One ancestor solemnly said: “Moreover, Golden Cicada Buddhist Child is using it while in Heavenly Dragon Temple, the best possible location for it.”

This merit law had no offensive technique or movement. In fact, the foes would feel happiness and joy - a type of killing without spilling blood.

“Buzz.” Buddhist light appeared around the scion after the emergence of the holy kingdom.

In any other situation, this could be construed as a positive experience - that the scion was learning a top Buddhist art.

This wasn’t the case right now. It meant that the conversion was occurring within him. If he couldn’t handle this force, he would lose and become the Buddhist Child’s loyal follower.

“Activate!” He roared and channeled his grand dao again. Dao laws started flowing along with endless chaos true energy inside his body in an attempt to crush the spreading Buddhist light.

“Pop! Pop! Pop!” His grand dao power seemed to be pushing the light back.

Alas, each time he destroyed it, the light would appear again with greater intensity and brightness. It became obvious that his grand dao was of no use.

“Damn, even the mighty scion can’t stop World Crossing.” A big shot from the last generation took a deep breath.

“Break!” The scion roared and his dao foundation lit up before releasing a black maelstrom.

“Zzz...” Buzzes could be heard wherever it went as it absorbed the Buddhist light like a whale.

Both the light and the conversion affinity eventually disappeared from sight.

“Intent Devourer of the seven chapters!” A spectator shouted after seeing this.
