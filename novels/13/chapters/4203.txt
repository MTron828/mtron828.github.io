Chapter 4204: Void Saint Child

The possibility of a fight between Ling Jian and Peace Ocean Sword King excited the crowd.

“Who will win?” One cultivator asked.

“I would bet on Peace Ocean Sword King.” An expert quietly said: “Talent-wise, he’s peerless in his generation and the previous. Moreover, he has two sword dao, they should overwhelm Sect Master Ling.”ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“You think so?” A last-gen member shook her head: “Sect Master Ling also has a heavenly dao - War God. It’s heaven-defying and perfect for battle. He has the experience advantage too, his energy should also be denser.”

“True.” One ancestor joined in: “Plus, it’s a fight only for three hundred moves, it won’t be easy for the king to win within this limit. It would be harder to guess without this rule.”

The crowd members spoke hushedly since this pertained to two top masters. No one wanted to offend them.

“Do you wish to get involved in this mess, Sect Master Ling?” Peace Ocean remained calm after receiving a direct challenge. His dignified demeanor and style were natural, not learned. Because of this, everyone felt a strange pressure while being in his presence.

“What choice do I have? Sea Emperor Sword King has shown its stance after blocking access to the island. We have no choice but to act.” Ling Jian said flatly.

He said what was on the crowd’s mind. They were just too afraid to speak up out of fear. This was the way of Daoist Sword Ground - unyielding even before the strongest sect.

“Daoist Sword Ground has a rich history with admirable sages.” The king said: “Its power is also renowned and recognized by the world. However, Sect Master Ling, this wasn’t my sect’s decision alone, you need to think carefully before rushing into this region.”

He reminded the sect master about the alliance between his sect and Nine-wheel Citadel. Daoist Sword Ground stood no chance against both.

Others took a deep breath, realizing that he was merely speaking the truth.

“We’ll see about that.” Ling Jian had a serious expression but didn’t relent.

It seemed that Daoist Sword Ground was ready to take the risk. The crowd found this quite impressive.

“Are you sure you know what you’re doing, Sect Master Ling?” Sword rays and thunder flashed in the king’s eyes as he became serious as well.

“Count us in too.” A third party interjected before a majestic aura manifested next to Ling Jian.

A middle-aged man appeared in that spot, wearing a violet robe. He appeared graceful and well-mannered in spite of his sharp and bright eyes. One would think that he was a mortal scholar before a cultivator.

“Flame Valley Lord!” Others recognized him right away.

“Hmm, he’s supporting Sect Master Ling.” Another expert found this surprising.

“They’re in the same group and always had a close relationship.” An older cultivator had more insight to add.

“All six Sect Masters are quite close since they’re in charge and need to keep a good relationship with each other.” An ancestor added.

“Is this going to be a battle between the sect masters and the kings?” Another joined in.

“Who knows?” A king from an old dynasty shook his head: “The only new members of the six kings are Peace Ocean and Void Saint Child, the other four are from the previous generation. Sect Master Shi of Armament is relatively young too, but all of them are cordial with each other. I don’t think there’ll be a fight between the two groups outside of an extraordinary event.”

Everyone agreed with this. They were classified into two different groups by other people. It didn’t mean that they had ties or anything.

“Flame Valley Lord.” Peace Ocean’s eyes narrowed after seeing the middle-aged man.

Flame Valley Lord was the current leader for both Flame Valley and Dao Institution. He was a formidable cultivator.

Peace Ocean didn’t want to face both at the same time despite being a top expert. These men have earned their reputation.

“Long time no see, Sword King, you’re looking as impressive as ever.” The valley lord smiled.

Though animosity existed, they still spoke cordially with each other.

“You must enter too, Valley Lord?” Peace Ocean got straight to the point.

“It looks like Myriad Era will be appearing here or something quite similar. I’m afraid I can’t let you and Nine-wheel Citadel monopolize this place.” The valley lord laughed and stated his intention.

“Yes, everyone has the right to at least prove their worth to the divine sword. This barricade is unacceptable.” Other top experts in the crowd agreed with him.

“Confident because you have the number advantage? We won’t be sitting idly by to watch.” A burst of hearty laughter interrupted the crowd.

“Buzz.” Ripples and golden waves appeared not far from Peace Ocean Sword King.

A portal opened and a youth walked out. He was shrouded in a golden radiance, looking like a spatial manipulator master.

Space resembled a river around him. Currents could be seen flowing around his arms. He had the appearance of a warrior, always commanding respect and attention wherever he went.

Similar to Peace Ocean Sword King, the guy seemed to be blessed by the gods at birth.

“Void Saint Child!” Someone shouted his title.

“No, he is the Void Sacred Lord now.” A big shot said: “He has been in charge of Nine-wheel Citadel for two or three years.”
