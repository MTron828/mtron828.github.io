Chapter 3746: First Swing

Lin Hao and Xiao Fengyun stood face to face while everyone else watched with bated breath.

Both were at the grand level of the Myriad-form realm. This was nothing short of impressive at their age. They might not be the best of the best but were still geniuses among geniuses.

They certainly had a bright future given their current cultivation and had no problem becoming Heavenly Sovereigns. In fact, they would be at the top level of that realm, becoming the strongest ancestors of a sect. Thus, this fight was worth a watch even for the top ancestors.

The two took the fight seriously, not daring to be careless.

“Who’ll win?” Some youths lost their patience during this standoff. For them, the fight was more than just Lin Hao’s personal score. The holy ground’s prestige was on the line as well.

“Senior Brother Lin, obviously, his inborn fate palace gives him a powerful life fire. Xiao Fengyun can’t stop it.” One spectator said.

“I hope so.” Another student replied. This would be a boost to the academy’s image. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A more insightful genius disagreed: “Lin Hao’s chances are low, to say the least. They’re both in the same realm but in terms of mastery, Lin Hao is far shallower.”

“As Fairy Dugu said, Xiao Fengyun is from a famous clan in Righteous, he has access to resources that Lin Hao isn’t privy to.” An expert agreed.

A few powerful geniuses from the holy ground thought about fighting Xiao Fengyun before Lin Hao. They hesitated because of Fengyun’s clan. This deterred their confidence.

Thus, the hopeful members of the crowd became quiet. The logic was sound - Lin Hao’s background was his biggest weakness.

Therefore, his available merit laws and weapons couldn’t compare to Xiao Fengyun.

“I’m starting now.” Fengyun unsheathed his saber.

“Clank!” Crackles detonated unceasingly as lightning waves engulfed the blade. He seemed to be holding a bundle of lightning bolts instead of an actual saber.

“Overwhelming Blast!” He roared and pushed his saber forward with lightning speed. The actual blade couldn’t be seen anymore, only lightning bolts twisting together.

The currents flowed swiftly like a torrential river, looking like a spear piercing through space. It felt as if a dam had fallen and the ferocious lightning bolts instantly rushed out to hunt Lin Hao.

It consisted of speed, power, and sharpness - crushing space in the process while aiming for Lin Hao’s throat.

This move was ferocious and potentially fatal while being extremely hard to defend.

“Activate!” Lin Hao was ready. He roared and released his fate palace. Life fire was released with a similar intensity.

This flame had an all-destroying destructive capability, able to burn through everything in its path.

“Boom!” The lightning river and the fire wave made contact, resulting in a terrible shockwave of fire and lightning twisted together. Loud crackles and blinding lights materialized, akin to the eruption of a volcano infused with lightning.

The flames seemed to have the upper hand and started drowning out the lightning. The flow suddenly reversed towards Xiao Fengyun like an unstoppable army.

“This is possible?” One youth became slack-jawed.

“His cauldron of life is special, no one among the young generation can have a stronger fire.” A big shot praised Lin Hao after seeing this.

The life fire seemed rather unstoppable, ready to burn the opponent to a crisp.

“Lightning Bird!” Xiao Fengyun showed no sign of fear as he performed his next technique. The saber immediately released more lightning.

“Screech!” As he swung his blade, a lightning bird flew out.

“The image of an auspicious divine beast.” Even the older experts became startled.

The saber was made from the dao bone of this auspicious beast.

“Rumble!” The bird soared upward and released more lightning bolts. It looked like the ruler of this affinity. Its claws could tear out the fabrics of space to open a portal to a lightning world.

It didn’t take long before an ocean of lightning accumulated to meet the incoming life fire.

“Boom!” This influx of power seemingly overwhelmed the torrent of fire.

Lin Hao saw this and finally used one axe for a vertical slash. Its speed was unreasonable. The afterimage in the air appeared a long time after the actual movement.

The monstrous slash seemed capable of splitting the world into two halves.

“Furious Slash!” His roar echoed in everyone’s mind.

“Boom!” Fengyun retaliated perfectly by parrying the axe with his saber, preventing his head from being split open.

The crowd felt pain in their ears from the loud explosion. Fiery sparks splattered from the impact point while Fengyun was pushed a dozen steps backward.

“Yea! Brother Lin!” The Duality students applauded since Lin Hao had the upper hand.

The slash earlier made them feel amazing. They have been holding back anger and indignation for a while now.

“Lin Hao’s reputation is well-deserved.” Another genius had to admit that Lin Hao was worthy of his fame. He might not be the strongest among the five heroes but definitely in the top three.

“He would be one level higher if he came from a big clan.” One ancestor sentimentally said.

Among the five, he certainly worked the hardest so his cultivation was solid.

The rare members of the crowd who came from humble backgrounds took pride in this. After all, he represented their dream.
