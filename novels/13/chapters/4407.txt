Chapter 4408: Five-sun King

“Five-sun King is the guest.” He revealed this to the group.

“Five-sun? From Eastern Desolace?” The group became emotional.

“Seriously?” Disciples from Dragon shuddered as well.

“We get to see Five-sun King today?” The youths became excited.

This went double for the female disciples. One of them nearly jumped up and shouted: “We’re going to see Five-sun King! He’s one of the most brilliant geniuses right now, a true conqueror of this generation!”

“A true dragon among men. Why is he here, maybe he wants to pick a queen from Dragon?” Another female disciple’s eyes turned into hearts.

Gossips could be heard everywhere. The members of Dragon were truly ecstatic and considered this a great honor.

“Why is he visiting Dragon?” A last-gen expert from another sect became startled.

“Is he that strong?” Someone from a small sect didn’t know anything outside of Southern Desolace.

“He can be considered the supreme in Eastern Desolace.” An ancestor explained.

“Yes, he is the rising sun there right now.” A clan member added.

A cultivator from Eastern Desolace became sentimental: “He is absolutely unmatched right now. He has united the fragmented land once more.”

“Many ancient clans from there have decided to support him in becoming the next dao lord.” A member from a clan there added.

Eastern Desolace was the oldest continent in Sky Border. It used to be the most prosperous with numerous behemoths and dao lords.

For example, the Pure Yang Clan had dominated for eras. The Three Schools of Void Imperfection were invincible as well. Then there was Skyvine Citadel and Eternal River School…

The golden age of this continent belonged to the Pure Yang Clan and its founder - Pure Yang Dao Lord. They protected the world from many ominous events and entities. This clan had the same position in the east as Lion’s Roar did in the south.

As time passed, it produced fewer and fewer insightful descendants. Later on, the clan suddenly decided to close its doors and stopped interacting with the outside world. They fell into obscurity as a result. The other behemoths eventually followed suit and disappeared from sight.

Keep in mind that this continent was once known as the Continent of Mortal Emperors. Alas, the disappearance of these behemoths caused quite a blow to this old land.

Though more talents and sects rose up afterward, none could compare to the Pure Yang Clan. This meant that the land was divided and lacked a central authoritative figure.

The rise of Five-sun King gave them hope again. He came from Five-sun School, a lineage with two dao lords.

Rumor has it that he was blessed with a peerless constitution, possessing the legendary Sky Eagle bloodline at birth on top of a heaven-level true fate. He was certainly the heaven’s favorite and he lived up to these gifts.

At a very young age, he was already in the golden avatar level and became a potential heir to the throne of the dao lord. Moreover, he visited many ancient clans in Eastern Desolace and impressed them with his intelligence.

Many ancestors appeared to support him. Because of this alliance, it didn’t take long before he became the lord of Eastern Desolace.

“Is he here to form an alliance with Dragon?” One expert analyzed.

“That’s a possibility.” One high elder responded: “The east and south are connected and he’s here with many ancestors too. Looks like he is representing Eastern Desolace on this trip…”

Others agreed with him. The current force of the king could certainly represent Eastern Desolace.

“An alliance would solidify Dragon’s status in the south.” Another elder whispered.

Others exchanged glances. This alliance could boost Dragon’s influence enough to potentially replace Lion’s Roar. In fact, this has been a relatively popular opinion in recent years.

“So we got ourselves a fun show.” One spectator concluded.

“I heard some big shots came along too.” A member of Eastern Desolace said. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“The three saints?” A clan member asked.

“Not sure about the three saints, but I know some from the eight paragons are here.” The member had good sources.

Three saints, eight paragons, thirty-six sovereigns - these were the strongest groups under Five-sun King.

The three saints were three ancient ancestors from the various clans. The rest also belonged to the top powers in Eastern Desolace. This was a testament to his popularity.

“Well, if any of them are here, then something big is definitely happening.” Everyone in the city was talking about this event.

“How many in all of Sky Border can actually compete with Five-sun King?” A young fan said with full admiration.

“Well, he’s one of the five young conquerors right now. He does have rivals and might not become the ultimate victor. For example, True Immortal Conqueror is matchless.” A knowledgeable expert responded.

“O-” A loud horn in the three branches sounded. This was the greeting horn.

Three battalions from the three branches emerged and lined up in a magnificent manner. Thousands and thousands of demons floated in the air at the end of the pathway to greet their guests.

“What a grand ceremony.” Outsiders were in awe, especially those from smaller sects.

“It’s not just Five-sun King but many other big shots from Eastern Desolace too. This welcoming ceremony makes sense.” One of them said.

“Look, the ancestors from the three branches are up there.” Another whispered, realizing how big of a deal this was.
