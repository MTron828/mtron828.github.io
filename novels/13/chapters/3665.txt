Chapter 3666: I’ll TeaChapter You How To Open The Door

The wooden door blocked Li Qiye’s path while he was the center of attention.

He opened his mouth and started barking: “Woof, woof, woof!”

The spectators became frozen chicken due to overly focusing and hearing something ridiculous. Sure enough, Li Qiye was barking, and several dozen times at that.

What a joke. People thought that he was teasing them.

“Creak.” However, the wooden door actually slowly opened.

This turned everyone into statues with their jaw nearly dropping on the ground. They became empty-headed since words weren’t sufficient to describe their current feeling. The barks actually worked. Li Qiye wasn’t just messing with them.

A while back, people have employed numerous methods. One used his strongest merit law; another relied on a mysterious treasure. Now, it seemed that they should have just barked.

Some big shots witnessed this entire thing. They had plenty of experience and saw many wondrous and strange things. This was still unprecedented.

It was dark inside the wooden house but there were dancing wisps of light, seemingly tempting spectators. Due to a lack of visibility, they had no idea what treasures were emitting the lights.

Many eventually regained their wits and exchanged glances. The events today have been illogical and unbelievable.

“Did anyone try barking before?” A guy asked his friend nearby.

The group smiled wryly. It seemed that people did everything but bark like a dog. If anyone had suggested barking to open a sealed door, they would have been laughed out of the square and branded as a madman.

Now, the whole thing seemed rather reasonable after Li QIye’s success.

“I would have barked if I knew this.” One person said with regrets: “It’s so damn simple, I’m so stupid!”

The entire crowd shared this sentiment. They wouldn’t have minded barking several hundred times in order to open the wooden door.

“Young Master, you’re the best! I knew you could do it!” Yang Ling jumped from excitement.

“I have nothing to say...” The crown prince shook his head. It seemed that he had needlessly worried since Li Qiye had everything under control.

He thought that he lacked knowledge and vision, unable to see the depth of Li Qiye’s abilities. Thus, he was inferior to Yang Ling in this regard.

Meanwhile, the second princess and Zhang Yunzhi became ashen. Not in their dream would they expect something like this.

The bet should have been a sure win. Li Qiye’s head should have met the ground.

After all, what made this woodchopper different from the rest? This could only be explained as a miracle, that the god of fate had bestowed immense fortune upon Li Qiye. The impossible became possible; a sure win has turned into a nightmare for them.

“How can this be...” The second princess had not a single clue regardless of how much she racked her brains.

“Go in, go in, check the treasures in there.” One spectator told Li Qiye while looking at the flashing lights.

He would have rushed in if it wasn’t for the workers from Wish Ward surrounding the square.

“Yes, there must be some special treasures in there.” Another had saliva dripping out of his mouth.

Yang Ling herself couldn’t wait and felt happy for Li Qiye since he was about to be rich.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye shrugged and smiled: “Not interested, I don’t want to be rich.”

He turned and left then the door behind him creaked and shut tightly once more.

“What?!” This shocked people even more than the barks earlier.

“Is he crazy?!” They stared at Li Qiye as if he was a fool or a madman.

A great treasury awaited him in that wooden house. He had the chance to obtain unbelievable wealth yet he didn’t even bother coming in to take a look.

Others have done everything in order to open that door. They wanted to become legends themselves but their attempts were futile.

Li Qiye, the heaven’s favorite and the sole victor, actually refused his prize. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Fuck, give it to me if you don’t want it!” A big shot started cursing: “You’re wasting a gift from heaven, an eternal fortune!”

“Does he not know the significance of the things inside?” People wished they could be him to make a different choice.

“A true prodigal son, to say no to everlasting wealth.” Others felt a strange pain.

Li Qiye walked out with a smile on his face, ignoring the comments.

“That’s the young master for you.” The shocked Yang Ling regained her composure. Only the young master was decisive enough to make this choice. Others weren’t at this level.

“Unbelievable.” The crown prince stared at Li Qiye for a long time before concluding.

“Amitabha.” Untethered Monk placed his palms together and closed his eyes. This was within expectation.

He knew more than anyone else here but didn’t wish to divulge this information.

“Asshole...” Someone mumbled, wanting to kick Li Qiye.

“Why didn’t you just give it to us?” Another gritted his teeth.

They were ready to fight to the death for this treasury but this guy just turned away from it. What a waste of an opportunity. He could have just given it to them if he didn’t want it. Alas, no one did anything outside of cursing Li Qiye.
