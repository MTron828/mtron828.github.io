All-things had complete control in his world. Entering it as an enemy was a risky endeavor since they would be subjected to immense pressure.

Nonetheless, Illumination showed no sign of hesitation before entering.

“Buzz.” A river of time suddenly manifested into reality and also infiltrated All-things World.

Illumination jumped up and stood on the resplendent river, assuming a form no less dominant than All-things?Dao Lord.

“My light is eternal!” He roared and faced the pressure of this world directly. The temporal river of light illuminated everything.

This was his grand dao and strongest merit law - the reason for his domination.

Although many disagreed with his conduct or even despised him, they had to agree that this dao was brilliant.

He turned into a giant and stomped on the river, creating a tsunami of time rushing straight for All-things Dao Lord.

“Together, untouchable.” All-things chanted in response, causing his entire world to be sealed.

A stagnating effect started and caused Illumination’s river of time to slow by a century, a millennium, ten thousand years, one hundred thousand years…

The temporal stagnation eventually froze the river of time itself and aimed for Illumination.

“Activate!” Illumination roared a split second before a complete sealing.

He summoned his peerless treasure - an antique cauldron. Time couldn’t wear it down and only strengthened it.

“Illumination Thurible!” Those who saw this for the first time became startled.

It released three strands of smoke that resemble three paths of reincarnation and karma. One of them coiled around All-things Dao Lord and released a karmic fruit.

Karma was something to be feared in the cultivation world. Now, one has attached itself to All-things.

“Detach.” All-things whispered while having to pull off his seal. His body became ethereal, seemingly returning to emptiness.

In this transcended state, he flicked his finger and vanquished the strand of smoke, causing Illumination to stumble several steps backward as if struck by lightning.

Illumination roared and retaliated by igniting the flames inside his cauldron, creating another world inside All-things’ own domain.

It immediately expanded and tried to break All-things World via violent explosions.

The two apex cultivators utilized the mysteries of the dao, capable of creating a world and its various affinities with a single thought. Each hand wave was destructive and awed the audience.

The cultivators in the palace observed the spectacle carefully. They had their own grand dao already but were still learning about utilizing one’s own domain in battle.

The two combatants were evenly matched and had a good understanding of each other’s battle style and techniques. It would take a while for one to come out ahead.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a figure darted into the palace straight for Ye Fantian’s cage and interrupted their observation.

“Excuse me, gentlemen.” He said as he made it to the cage as if this was an empty hall.

“Stop!” Rumination Dao Lord and the others shouted.

“Supreme!” Some shouted after getting a clear look at the uninvited guest.

He had the presence of a silvery dragon due to his shining robe, looking unstoppable and peerless. Even his enemies couldn’t find flaws to criticize his appearance and aura.

Although there were numerous dao lords and conquerors present, he still managed to evade all of them.

Nonetheless, the others reacted in time and started attacking him before he could take Ye Fantian away.
