Chapter 5619: Wanted To Kill You

The atmosphere became less tense as the two sat together. The sea breezes blew by and made her hair messy, prompting Li Qiye to fix it.

After a long while, she calmed down and asked: “When are you starting?”

“Soon, everything is ready except for the eastern wind. That is when we start.” He looked up at the sky and said.

“You must get it done or countless deaths would have been in vain.” She said forcefully.

“They would have died anyway but now, at least they died with a purpose.” He shrugged.

“Are you still human?!” Her eyes flashed murderously with rays capable of piercing the heart.

“I’m definitely human, you’re not.” He said with a smile. 

“You!” She glared furiously at him.

He smiled and tidied a strand of hair draping down her forehead: “Don’t worry, I will do what I must. Otherwise, how can I leave in peace? This small plot of land must be rid of all insects so that crops can grow.” 

“So you can reap it later?” She remarked.

“No, don’t misunderstand. I am plowing, weeding, and getting rid of pests. What grows after is no longer my problem.” He shook his head.

“Very well. When it is time for battle, I want him. You must leave him to me.” She said.

“I’m afraid I can’t promise you that. It is outside of my control and yours.” He responded.

“You know full well you have control over this.” She disagreed.

“If it were up to me, that wouldn’t have happened and things wouldn’t have come to this point.” He said.

“But all of this was your own doing. You had control over every step and can influence the outcome now.” She said.

“It doesn’t matter what you say, it will not be possible.” Li Qiye refused.

“You!” Her flawless and cold demeanor gained a tinge of red from being angry.

“Time will tell, don’t lose patience.” Li Qiye said: “I won’t tolerate failure because as you said, many would have died in vain. All causes will have their effects. You’ve waited all this time, what’s a little longer?”

“You speak lightly when your whims cause untold suffering and death.” She said.

“Have you ever thought that without my so-called whims, the suffering and death will continue in perpetuity? My only wish is to put an end to the cycle.” He retorted: “This is not a downplay to your agonizing experience but in reality, it is not even one-tenth of what I have suffered during my dao journey.” 

She gazed intensely, wanting to see into his soul and search for the truth.

“So, is he dead or alive?” She eventually asked.

He shook his head and didn’t respond.

Her heart trembled after not getting an exact answer. Although she hoped for a certain outcome, she feared the truth would be the opposite.

“Good people do not live long while villains will reign for years.” She remarked.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Don’t worry, I won’t reign for much longer since I’ll be leaving soon. At that point, even if the world calls for me, I will not answer.” He said.

“Where to?” Her words remained cold but her gaze softened.

“Where I should go.” He gazed at the sky, capable of seeing its farthest regions.

“Do you remember the promise you made when you left the thirteen continents previously?” Her eyes turned icy and sharp.

“Yes, I did promise.” He let out a soft sigh.

“Tell me then, is there still a chance or not?” She asked with a serious tone. 

He sighed again, gazing upward before shaking his head: “I don’t know, I think it’s rather unlikely.”

“That’s why you gave up.” She said.

“It’s not something I can decide nor should I, you know this. If this could be left for others to decide, it wouldn’t have reached this point.” He said.

Her gaze became softer again with a hopeful hint, longing for an awaited answer.

“Still alive?” She mustered the courage to ask. 

He took a deep breath and remained silent before answering: “It’s hard to say, a matter such as this is too unpredictable and beyond grasp.”

“So there’s a chance? You should do it!” She seemed revitalized and persuaded aggressively.

“You know that no one in the world can bring back someone who is truly dead outside of the villainous heaven.” He stared at her before revealing a faint smile.

“But you can, I know you can!” She answered.

He sighed again before answering: “Yes, I can, as long as all the conditions are right but it’s an ominous endeavor with serious consequences.”

“What matters more to you, her or these consequences?” She asked.

“Some things just shouldn’t be done.” He shook his head: “Not just me but the omnipotent villainous heaven believes this as well. Otherwise, entities that cannot resist temptation will succumb to corruption.”

“So that’s a no.” She took a deep breath.

“Well, perhaps things may not be as dire as you imagine. Maybe there is a glimmer of hope.” He suddenly changed his tune.

“Hmph, the word despair has never popped up on your face, Dark Crow.” She uttered coldly.

“You do know me well, I wonder why you insisted on trying to kill me back then.” He smiled.

“I only regret not being able to kill you then.” Her cold gaze didn’t hide her murderous intent.

She knew that she couldn’t kill him then and definitely not now.
