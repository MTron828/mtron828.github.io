Soaring Immortal had also heard about the hot matters between Fiercest and Zi Cuining. Such rumors were very unfavorable for them. After all, Zi Cuining would become their mistress in the future or even the imperial queen. That’s why they didn’t wish to hear such gossips regardless of whether they were true or not.

For their sect right now, the best outcome was to kill Fiercest!

“If you two are old friends, then please come.” After contemplating for a moment, the instructor replied.

Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh: “That’s how it should be, the style of a lineage with five emperors. This is more presentable.”

The instructor wasn’t willing to respond.

“Soaring Immortal is actually relenting!” The spectators faraway were actually startled to see the sect allowing Li Qiye to see Zi Cuining. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

No one expected this particular development. They thought the instructor would try to stop him then a massacre would ensue.

But now, they unexpected conceded to the astonishment of the crowd. The sect had been domineering after descending into this region with an unstoppable conquest against the demons. They had no qualms moving against anyone until now.

The validity of the scandal between Li Qiye and the goddess didn’t matter. Most importantly, she was about to marry Long Aotian but Li Qiye decided to interfere at this crucial moment.

This meant that as long as Fiercest was still alive, he would be a smudge on Soaring Immortal’s reputation.

“Fiercest might be the only person who can force Soaring Immortal to concede.” Someone murmured.

A disciple now led the way for Li Qiye who was all smiles. He and the monarch casually entered the sect’s territory. Anyone else would treat this place like the lion’s den. They would surely be prepared for him but Fiercest was completely indifferent, drawing even more admiration from the crowd.

On the contrary, Soaring Immortal was ready for battle. The disciples here didn’t dare to relax at all. They had full battle adornment ready and guarded their positions. This was because Fiercest was too notorious. Everyone knew of his bloodstained hands.

This was someone who would destroy a sect after some unfriendly words so how could Soaring Immortal not be careful? They didn’t want to be like the disciples on the Skyfire Warships, crushed like a pulp and dead without a grave!

It didn’t take long before the disciple took him to an old pavilion. It was floating in the air with a stairway made of clouds. It was heavily guarded with experts from Heaven Suppression instead of Soaring Immortal.

“Young Noble Li, I can only take you here.” The Soaring Immortal disciple quietly left after taking him here.

This was a wise move from the instructor. He didn’t want to confront Li Qiye directly and instead threw the problem at Heaven Suppression. It was the city’s choice now whether he can see the goddess or not.

In his opinion, the marriage between Cuining and Aotian had been decided by the high-ranking ancestors from the two sects. No one could change this outcome.

Because of this, he was confident that Fiercest wouldn’t be able to break this marriage alliance either.

For this alliance to work, Heaven Suppression must also be on their side when dealing with Fiercest.

“Halt, who are you?!” The guards protecting the pavilion immediately pointed their weapons at Li Qiye as he drew closer.

In fact, they were aware of the situation and who they were facing. Nevertheless, they must not let him see Zi Cuining. They weren’t here to protect her but to isolate her from contacting outsiders.

Someone of her power level didn’t need the protection from these experts. They were only under Ye Jiuzhou’s order to avoid any potential complication before the marriage was done.

Of course, Jiuzhou’s preparation wasn’t meant for Fiercest, only the other dissenters from Heaven Suppression. If he knew Fiercest was going to be coming, he would have personally presided over the area.

“Good dogs don’t block the way.” Li Qiye glanced at the prepared forces and smiled.

A youth came out from the guards. He was well-dressed with a high crest while radiating a dazzling light with the powerful aura of a noble.

“Fellow Daoist Li, our city lord isn’t seeing guests, please leave.” The youth didn’t back down even before Fiercest.

“Dream Dragon King, Ye Jiuzhou’s favorite disciple.” The experts nearby recognized him right away.

“He’s quite strong for being so young, already a half completion Immortal Physique on top of training the other amazing arts from Heaven Suppression. It’s a shame that the goddess is too talented so he was doomed to be under her shadow.” An expert who knew him said with a tinge of emotion.

It was almost a tragedy for the Dream Dragon King because his incredible achievements looked less impressive before Zi Cuining. He couldn’t become the city lord.

“It’s not up to you and not up to her either. If I say I want to see her, I shall.” Li Qiye stared at him and declared nonchalantly.

“You...” The king’s expression turned ugly. He found it hard to swallow this anger when someone came to the Grand Sea and treated Heaven Suppression in this manner.

Despite knowing Fiercest, his sect was no slouch either. Moreover, his master and grandmaster were Ye Jiuzhou and Gu Zun, respectively.

“Li Qiye, everything has a limit, you shouldn’t be too aggressive or you will have no place left to go one day, despite how vast the nine worlds are!” The king took a deep breath and didn’t want to concede. He answered with the perfect tone, neither supercilious nor obsequious.

“No need to get all philosophical with me.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “I don’t care about reasons. I will count to five, if you don’t make way, I’ll kill you all.”

The experts here weren’t happy to hear such contempt coming from a junior, evident by their angry glare.

“Fine, Li Qiye, I’ll check out your supreme arts!” The king didn’t back off and was ready to fight to the death. He had received the orders from his master to not let anyone see the city lord!

“You are not his match, get back.” Zi Cuining appeared on the pavilion above and gravely said.

The king hesitated and stood there quietly. He wasn’t in the position to disobey her publicly. After all, she was still the city lord.

Her appearance attracted everyone’s attention. This was a peerless woman just like a fairy, a goddess of the sea!

Zi Cuining had a stern demeanor since she was robbed of her authority by Ye Jiuzhou’s group. To be perfectly frank, she was virtually put under house arrest.

The spectators were holding their breath to see how this scandal will unfold!

Li Qiye chuckled after seeing her: “Not bad. Girl, time to leave.”

Cuining smiled wryly and shook her head: “Brother Li, certain things can’t be dealt with right now. I have my own problems, please excuse me.”

She naturally wanted to go with him in order to avoid the marriage. However, all the ancestors and old men from the village were locked into the Black Dragon Hall. The city right now was under Ye Jiuzhou’s control. If she were to leave, she would be playing right into his hands.

Thus, she must stay and wait for the right opportunity to strike back!
