Chapter 5197: Heavenly Flame Dao Controller

His technique could be utilized by any disciple from Alchemy Dao. However, he had reached a state of apogee.

The elders found his movements and mudra to be awfully familiar yet foreign. This was because they had never seen a master of this level before.

They once thought that there was no point in mastering the elementary techniques due to their limitation.

Most cultivators looked down on simplicity; they believed that the more complicated the merit laws, the more worthwhile. This was especially true for the secret laws.

The elders saw their ancient ancestors failing to control the cauldron with the best available merit laws. On the other hand, Li Qiye alleviated the chaos through the use of elementary techniques.

“Creak.” He controlled the movements of the nine layers perfectly in order to maintain harmony between the dao flames.

Eventually, they started flowing like water down the layers into the cauldron, no longer possessing any destructive tendency.

This was the first time the spectators saw these flames acting so docile. All one hundred different dao flames have fused together into a single stream.

Grinding soy milk was a close comparison. Only a highly skilled master could grind the soybeans into a smooth and creamy texture.

Currently, Jadecure Conqueror was the best alchemist in their sect. Alas, she wasn’t at this level either.

Watching Li Qiye in action left everyone speechless including the two ancient ancestors.

After exerting his dominance, he separated the dao flames again and made them rush up into the air like a hundred fire dragons.

“Heavenly Flame Dao Controller!” Gourdkeeper and Panacea bellowed in astonishment.

“This is the legendary method!” The six elders couldn’t believe their own eyes.

They knew how to use these elementary techniques employed by Li Qiye. How did it end with such a legendary effect?

“Boom!” A thunderous noise erupted and the fire dragons evolved into something greater. Lightning coursed through their body.

“A lightning tribulation!” Gourdkeeper and Panacea had refined wonderful pills before. Alas, even their best ones didn’t produce this phenomenon.

It meant that even the most basic materials would turn into wondrous pills. The tribulation signaled that the pills within were beyond the limit of the grand dao and became a challenge to the heaven.

The true dragons roared and rushed back into the cauldrons. Loud explosions could be heard while the flames returned to the earth veins.

“Now.” Li Qiye ended the process and opened the cauldron, releasing a boundless golden radiance and a permeating medicinal fragrance.

Various visual phenomena manifested into reality - dragons and tigers, a rising sun, and many others…

The two ancient ancestors who were saved stood there frozen like chicken, the same for the others.

Gourdkeeper and Panacea were widely considered to be among the top five pill specialists in the upper continents. Alas, they had never invited these phenomena before. The best pill-maker, Jadecure Conqueror, had never done so either.

Li Qiye took out the gourd inside and tossed it to the saintess. She poured out one pill and saw that it was golden with all of the various phenomena contained within. Just smelling it made any pain disappear.

“A full nine rotations!” She shouted after recognizing its quality.

“Impossible! No one after the progenitor has been able to do so!” The six elders shouted.

“Let me take a look…” Panacea wanted to check the pill; his hands were shaking as he accepted it.

The two brothers inspected the pill and became startled. Panacea was shaking so much that he nearly dropped it.

“This is the finest grade, the highest level of refinement…” Gourdkeeper murmured.

Nine-form Imperial Remedy, just like its name, had nine levels. The higher, the more effective.

Panacea considered himself to be a better healing-medicine alchemist than even Jadecure Conqueror. He had gathered materials that were at least a million years old for this cauldron.

During the process, he reached the eighth level and wanted to take it a step further. He intensified the flames and stability was lost. The ninth level was out of reach for him.

On the other hand, Li Qiye easily refined ninth-level pills, not to mention that this was the very limit as well - the finest grade.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
