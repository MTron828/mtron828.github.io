Chapter 5307: Barbecue

The conqueror was originally a lantern. He utilized his best technique and used his grand dao to summon a special flame.

Not to mention regular dragon lords and sovereigns, even conquerors and dao lords might not be able to endure it directly.

It could burn through the reincarnation cycle and even imperial treasures, reducing them to molten liquid. His peers were aware of this move and found it rather dreadful.

The distortion of space and time made escape virtually impossible. Thus, the target became trapped and burned alive.

However, as people activated their heavenly gaze to observe the flame ravaging Li Qiye, they unexpectedly found that he was perfectly fine.

Not even his clothes were burning. He looked to be enjoying himself as if embraced by pleasant sunlight.

“Impossible!” Lantern shouted in horror.

He has dominated for such a long time now. In fact, during Emperor War, he killed several dao lords and conquerors through this technique. This simply didn’t make sense to him.

However, his astonishment was replaced by a sense of danger. He stopped thinking and tried to run. Unfortunately, outrunning the chain was impossible so he became another meat on the skewer.

As for Godcloud, he had been gathering power and finally unleashed a wave of lightning straight at Li Qiye. The moment they made contact, they exploded and multiplied into more bolts, fully drowning him.

The explosions affected all of the upper continents, not just the battlefield. At first, the wave of lightning didn’t seem impressive until the chain reaction.

However, once the dust settled, Li Qiye still stood there - unharmed.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Godcloud couldn’t believe what he was seeing. He reacted by summoning countless auspicious clouds.

“Again?” Spectators thought that if all of these clouds were to explode, the continent would suffer devastating damage.

Thus, the dragon lords standing nearby and even the conquerors and dao lords from a distance immediately retreated, not wanting to be dragged into this mess.

However, blood splashed first before the explosions from the clouds. Godcloud looked down and saw the chain piercing through his chest.

“Ahh!” He bellowed in pain before being dragged in the air by the chain just like the rest.

“Flaying your skin and removing your tendons is too much work, too gruesome as well. I’ll just roast you then.” Li Qiye said calmly.

The flame tribulation that was engulfing him suddenly traveled through the chain and started burning the four.

“Ahh!” Their screams echoed across the battlefield.

Even when they were at their peak state, they couldn’t have stopped this unique flame. Now, due to their weakened condition from being impaled, they had no chance of stopping it.

No other option existed - not self-implosion or any escaping technique - since the chain had firmly pierced their true fate and fruits.

Lantern couldn't believe that after burning so many to death, he would be subjected to the same fate one day.

During the sizzles and cries, many also smelled the stench of roasted meat. This was quite a frightening delicacy - a skewer made of dragon lords and conquerors.

Eventually, the four muttered their last breath before being reduced to ashes in public.
