Chapter 5384: Fast Learner

“Illumination Conqueror.” Ye Fantian said calmly.

“Incredible, the young me in the past could only dream to be as bold as you.” Illumination couldn’t help but praise: “Divine Alliance will be able to stand strong for ages with you.”

“You’re too kind, Senior.” Ye Fantian cupped her fist.

“Follow me, young lady, and this will be easy.” Illumination said.

The crowd thought that he would immediately try to kill Ye Fantian. Otherwise, once her wings were fully grown, the outcome of a battle between them wasn’t obvious. Moreover, she had just dealt a devastating blow to Dao Alliance and Azure School.

“And if I refuse?” She asked.

Illumination laughed in response. The sound waves from them caused the stars to tremble.

Despite recent setbacks, he was still an apex conqueror to be feared by all.

“I will have to kill you then.” He said before reaching for her.

His hand wielded immense power, crushing the fabrics of reality. Spectators saw this and felt their knees buckling, aware that they would not be able to stop him.

Ye Fantian had obtained twelve dao fruits but was still inferior in terms of raw cultivation.

A thunderous sound detonated and lightning bolts suddenly rushed out of her chest. This astounded Illumination and he hurriedly retreated. Nonetheless, the lightning bolts still pierced through his hand.

It turned out that she had been saving tribulation bolts precisely for a moment like this and immediately fled the battlefield.

“She learns fast.” Li Qiye was amused to see this.

The actual power gap between them was still considerable, akin to a novice versus a master. She still needed to form an immortal shell and obtain anima before fighting Illumination Conqueror.

This only amplified everyone’s high evaluation of her. Given her courage and planning, she would definitely reach the top of the upper continents.

“You’re not getting away!” Illumination took one step forward and sealed her next spatial leap.

“Clank!” A sword slash cut through the containment; spatial fabrics scattered downward.

“Swordsea Dao Lord!” Many knew the combatant instantly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The current guardian of Divine Alliance and Ye Fantian’s senior - Swordsea Dao Lord.

“Illumination, have you no shame?” Swordsea blocked Illumination’s path.

“You’re just just in time, Swordsea.” Illumination’s eyes became resplendent.

The appearance of Swordsea Dao Lord stirred the crowd. Though Illumination was the founder of Dao Alliance, he was not necessarily the strongest due to members such as All-things and Swordsea. The trio was a force to be reckoned with, pushing Dao Alliance above its peers.

This party didn’t last long since the three didn’t agree with each other. Swordsea left first and then Illumination was forced into seclusion, leaving All-things as the next guardian of Dao Alliance.

Since they had fought alongside each other once, they had a good grasp of the opponent’s power level.

“Rumble!” Illumination immediately mustered all of his power to the limit. A domineering and blinding aura engulfed the battlefield.

“Clank!” Swordsea didn’t relent and raised his sword.

One could illuminate the entire world while the other’s sword slash could cut through an eternity - the perfect recipe for an evenly matched duel.

Ye Fantian had no intention of lingering around since she was everyone’s prime target. Her very existence threatened apex conquerors and dao lords. Thus, she fled into another dimension without any hesitation.

Unfortunately, a prison descended from above. She performed dozens of movement techniques and still couldn’t dodge it.

“Bam!” It successfully trapped her inside while spewing continuous dao laws, seemingly capable of trapping an immortal.
