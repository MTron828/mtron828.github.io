Chapter 5870: Still Alive

“This epoch physique...” Emperors and monarchs shuddered in astonishment.

They already felt insignificant like insects compared to the seven overlords. Alas, they were suddenly reduced to specks of dust before Epoch’s End.

“Ready to die?” His words alone could destroy a world. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“A bit interesting, worthy of a fight.” Li Qiye looked eager to try for once.

He took one step forward, not subjected to the confines of time and space.

“Break!” His casual punch needed no dao or technique. Nevertheless, Voracious and the others have tasted its effectiveness prior.

If it was based on the grand dao, they could take advantage of this and devise ways to nullify it. Unfortunately, the simple punch bypassed their cultivation and knowledge while being immensely destructive.

However, Epoch’s End was now the culmination of his cultivation, the might of six epochs, and the power of a heavenly treasure.

“It’s over if this is your limit.” He stopped the punch effortlessly: “Have a taste of six epochs!”

“Boom!” The various forces came together as Epoch’s End roared: “Heavenly Epoch Annihilation!”

“We’re dead!” Emperors and monarchs beyond the mirror cried out in horror.

“So strong!” The overlords became alarmed as well. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say they wouldn’t last a single move against the empowered Epoch’s End.

“Bam!” Li Qiye was frozen in place while everything around him crumbled. His body exploded next.

“That’s not good!” His followers witnessed the whole thing and became alarmed.

“Is it truly inevitable?” The founder of Celestial Court lamented.

“Hmm?” The overlords saw Li Qiye being crushed to dust but remained skeptical.

“He’s not unkillable, no one is.” Primal said. If that wasn’t enough to kill Li Qiye, then nothing else could.

“He’s dead.” Voracious murmured while hoping for the best.

Everyone had paid a heavy price at this point, burning their lifespan and vitality. They also suffered grievous injuries and needed this to be over soon.

“Should be.” Epoch’s End lacked confidence as well. That move just now was enough to kill an overlord but Li Qiye was a true monster.

He was sure that it had obliterated everything down to the particles. Alas, Li Qiye was known to be a cockroach.

“I’m alive.” A leisurely voice could be heard.

“Dark Crow!” The overlords responded.

“Sacred Teacher is still alive!” An emperor behind the mirror shouted.

“We’re still okay, the world is still okay.” An ancient god cried out.

“Good, good, good...” The founder of Celestial Court said quietly.

Li Qiye’s voice had a grating and antagonizing effect on his enemies. However, given the circumstances, they were the most pleasant sounds in the world.

“Boom!” The obliterated space around him suddenly erupted with life force - one far stronger than the destructive attack earlier.

As Epoch’s End couldn’t stop something close to creation, Li Qiye placed his palms together.

“Primordial Anima Slash!” He utilized the power of the pre-beginning - when there was only the primordial light. The high heaven didn’t exist back then either.

The light slash came from the center of his palm with a clear target in mind.
