Chapter 4227: Myriad Era

The chants stopped from Li Qiye’s legion after people saw the two overlords - beings existing only in whispers of reverence.

Even the experts and ancestors who knew all of their exploits didn’t dare to open their mouth. They were preoccupied with the experience of seeing the duo in person.

Prior to this, some thought that these two would have incredible divinity and bright radiance. This didn’t turn out to be the case.

Nonetheless, the lack of visual spectacles didn’t mean that they were weak. As they sat there meditating, the subdued rays of energy emanating from them still suffocated the spectators.

This didn’t apply to Li Qiye. He only glanced at the two briefly before turning his attention towards the island. Everyone else gradually did the same.

They noticed a boulder with a sword on top. Smoke was coming out of the boulder, seemingly sentient. They looked like lips licking the sword. The boulder had a black shade and a coarse surface, looking like sand grains.

However, upon closer inspection, the grainy texture consisted of runes, not sand. These dark runes seemed to be coming from the depths of the world. The countless nature of the runes made the boulder resemble the ultimate runic originator.

Tiny flames were embedded in the runic indentations. They released smoke and danced, seemingly licking the sword. This process left behind faint patterns on the blade; there was no order to them. Nonetheless, the grand picture was one of a dao chapter.

Those who recognize this sword would be shocked because it belonged to Daoist Peng. His heirloom had flown into Sword Ocean and pinned itself on the boulder.

This boulder appeared harmless at first, same with the weak flames. This was a misconception because there were ashes of powerful treasures and weapons, even the remains of ancestors.

It became obvious that the two behemoths have tried repeatedly to obtain the sword. Alas, this all ended in failure.

Top ancestors and their weapons were reduced to ashes before being able to get close.

“My sword…” Daoist Peng murmured but couldn’t get closer. This was beyond his level.

Eventually, people calmed down enough to talk.

“That has to be Myriad Era.” They didn’t know what Myriad Era looked like but intuition told them this was it.

Nothing else could motivate Vastsea Paragon and Earthraiser Vajra to come here. It appeared that they couldn’t get to the sword either, unable to handle the black flames from the boulder.

“What is that thing, why is it so dreadful?” One spectator asked.

Myriad Era was right before them; one just needed to be strong enough to take it. Of course, this required being more capable than two overlords.

Even if Nine-wheel and Sea Emperor didn’t try to stop them, they wouldn’t be able to get it either. The risk was simply too great.

A moment later, many turned towards Li Qiye - a man who could do the impossible. He became the most likely candidate to obtain Myriad Era.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Can Li Qiye do it?” Everyone became excited about a potential miracle.

“We can’t keep up with the young generation.” Vastsea Venerable commented while staring at Li Qiye.

“That’s just how it is, era changes and so do the people. If subsequent generations are inferior, then the world will fall into depravity. Thus, it’s not too late for you to leave.” Li Qiye smiled.

Everyone took a deep breath after hearing his domineering statement. No one else would dare to speak to two behemoths in this manner, telling them to leave.

If these top existences were to listen to him, they would throw away their reputation and prestige. Their sects would lose their authority and reach as well.

“Always overbearing.” A big shot commented.

Others spoke with reverence when in front of these overlords, not daring to breathe loudly. Li Qiye, on the other hand, never gave a second thought when speaking to anyone.
