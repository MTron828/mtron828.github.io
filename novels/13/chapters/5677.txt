Chapter 5678: You Should Be Thanking Me

“Primal was nothing, he didn’t dare to fart before me.” The dark being became annoyed after hearing this.

“Primal Ancestor alone might not be enough to scare the old you but what about Lord of Derivation? He must have despised you and your inborn gifts. He considered himself to be the most intelligent being in history, most likely viewing you as nothing more than a savage with brute strength. If he had your gifts, he would have been the true ruler of Trinity Epoch.” Li Qiye continued.

“Your instigation is useless.” The being sneered.

“I’m not instigating because what can a soul like you do to them?” Li Qiye said: “You know full well that they must have looked down on you, especially Lord of Derivation. He probably thought that if he had your inborn gifts, he would have defeated the high heaven and taken over. When you returned in defeat, I’m positive that Lord of Derivation definitely laughed at you. He thought that the great Trinity Ancestor was nothing special, still ran away like a stray dog and succumbed to the darkness.”

“Derivation is trash as well.” The being was furious after hearing this. He sneered and said: “The abomination didn’t dare to say a damn thing in my presence and ran from my light like a cowardly turtle.”

“I believe you because you were indeed the lord of everything during the beginning of Trinity Epoch. Primal and Derivation didn’t reach your height so they kept quiet. But, the same couldn’t be said about later on even if you didn’t go on an expedition.” LI Qiye said.

“Is that so?” The being sneered: “How can a few juniors compete with me?”

The true soul of Trinity Ancestor clearly didn’t respect the future generations.

“Hard to say due to the number advantage.” Li Qiye said: “Primal is not enough, sure, but count the madman Derivation in. Then Stonesplitter Patriarch as well.”

“Skysplitter was a slave in the old mines, nothing without my shedding some enlightenment on him.” The being said.

“How about Imperial Progenitor of Myriad Realms?” Li Qiye smiled: “Sure, you and Primal are both invincible and self-made with your dao and gifts. However, your contributions to future generations pale compared to Imperial Progenitor. He opened the cultivation path for your epoch, allowing all beings, mortals included, to cultivate without the need of having inborn gifts.”

“He asked me for help with creating that method, it is nothing of note.” The being said arrogantly.

“Your disdain is understandable. After all, it can’t compare to your inborn physique and true soul, one is inborn and the other cultivated after the fact.” Li Qiye said: “Then let’s talk about Dao Ancestor who studied from all nine heavenly scriptures. You never did it, and neither did Derivation and Primal. His diligent effort granted him success.”

“Manual labor, nothing more, just interpreting the dao of heaven and earth.” The being answered again.

“You looked down on them since you were certainly superior, but they also looked down on you since you were just born early and blessed with everything. They thought that if they had been the chosen one, they would have made the epoch more brilliant, one comparable to the most brilliant epochs. For example, the machine epoch.” Li Qiye said.

“If they were so great, why did they tremble before the might of the high heaven? They didn’t even dare to fight, only hiding in my epoch.” The being responded.

“True.” Li Qiye said: “But this didn’t prevent them from laughing at you and saying that Trinity Ancestor is just like them. All that pride and arrogance only to come crawling back and hiding.”

“Hmph, I can still kill them without an inborn dao chaos physique.” The being snorted.

“Who knows?” Li Qiye said: “At the very least, you returned and stayed at Celestial Court for so long. They didn’t seem to care about you but that’s alright, here is your chance. Reborn with this physique and cut them down, one by one.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Forget it, Dark Crow. I will not follow your plan, reviving and killing them.” The being laughed.

“I can’t help it if you see it that way.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“So you don’t want to kill them, these insects living on your plot? Not very convincing, Dark Crow.” The being said.

“There’s something you misunderstand.” Li Qiye said: “Even if this wasn’t my epoch, I would have still killed them back in Trinity.”

“Why is that?” The being asked.

“It’s simple, they are not allowed to live in the same world as me.” Li Qiye said.

“Bold words.” The being said.

“You should be thanking me. If it wasn’t for me, your Trinity Epoch would have been in an unsightly state.” Li Qiye said.

“What does that have to do with me?” The being said coldly.

“So you’re okay with letting them thrive? Is that why you didn’t kill them back then?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“They were still wet with milk during my reign and couldn’t amount to anything.” The being said with the proper amount of arrogance given his past prestige.

“Unfortunately, they didn’t see it that way. They only schemed on how to consume you and squeeze your epoch dry.” Li Qiye said.

“Say what you want, but if you want to use me to get rid of them, forget it. I will not cooperate with you, Dark Crow.” The being said.

“Am I more repulsive than them or something?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“They can do nothing to me and if I choose to be reborn, I can easily kill them. But to work with you, Dark Crow, that will only end one way for me, death.” The being snorted.

“That’s utterly incorrect. I have nothing but respect for Trinity Ancestor. A rebirth will be wonderful, another guardian deity for the world.” Li Qiye said.

“Who says I want to be Trinity Ancestor?” The being said.

“Addicted to being the darkness now?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh.

“Where do I fit in in such a resurrection? If it is without me, then life or death doesn’t matter. That’s the fundamental problem here.” The being said.

“Makes sense.” Li Qiye agreed and stroked his chin.
