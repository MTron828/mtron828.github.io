Chapter 5517: Path In Life

Ripples appeared in her clear eyes - a sign of disbelief.

“You’ve found me.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Young Noble!” Two pearl-like teardrops streamed down her cheeks.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“So we meet again.” Li Qiye sighed sentimentally before spreading his arms.

She couldn’t control her emotions and ran into his embrace. For eras, she walked alone from the nine worlds to the six continents, only wanting to follow in his footsteps.

In the end, she couldn’t catch up to meet him, not even during her last moment. Nonetheless, her wish still remained after death, resulting in this painting. This moment justified her effort and perseverance.

“The heart is the strongest force in this world.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

“All to see you, Young Noble.” She revealed a wonderful smile. The mysteries of the dao and their power couldn’t compare to this moment of satisfaction.

They embraced for who knows how long. She looked up to see his face while he gently caressed her cheek.

“You have done an amazing job, an indomitable dao heart.” He said.

“I never forgot your guidance.” She said: “Walk with me, Young Noble.”

He nodded and they held hands, interlocking their fingers. They strolled through the plain at a leisurely pace. The breeze accompanied by the scene of nature accompanied them.

This time around, the white cloud didn’t follow her, seemingly wanting to give them space.

“I entered the immortal city and witnessed its mysteries, allowing me to live longer.” She said softly while staring at him.

“Your determination allowed you to overcome it.” Li Qiye said.

“I thought that it would have been enough to catch up to your pace.” She said.

“It’s paradoxical.” Li Qiye said: “Taking the next step and reaching the other shore require an indomitable dao heart. Faltering means falling into the darkness, just one wrong thought and it’s over. However, someone with an indomitable dao heart would never take this step in the first place. So this means that there is only one possible result - damnation.”

“Yes, and no longer fit to see you then, Young Noble.” She said.

He smiled and glanced toward the horizon: “Immortal Dao City. Look at what they did, expending all of your lifespan.”

The reason for her death was due to running out of lifespan after comprehending the immortal artifact. Otherwise, she could have lived for much longer in a dormant state.

“My wish is fulfilled with our meeting, Young Noble.” She smiled brightly and said: “Life isn’t perfect and I was just a normal person. To be able to go this far was due to the path you showed me.”

“A single thought led you down a lifelong path, not necessarily for the better.” He sighed.

“I would have been another cultivator, one among the masses, who will die of old age in Crimson Night.” She said and held his hand: “I have no regrets, from our nine worlds to Eight Desolaces then the six continents, and now, here you are before me, Young Noble. I was but an insect but you showed me the vastness of the world.”

He let out a sigh again and gently touched her cheek. In the end, she had to rely on this special method to see him.

Was it worth it? Nearly an epoch of time spent on a lonely journey only to fail. On the other hand, she was right about her own limitations.

Without his interference, she would have died as a member of Crimson Night, unable to witness the flow of history. Which was the better outcome? Perhaps there was no right answer.

Nonetheless, she followed her heart bravely and tirelessly, always moving forward without regrets.

The scent of grass lingered in the air, sweet and bittersweet. A second in the painting was akin to a thousand years as they took a walk together.

“Young Noble, my heart is content. If there is another life, I would still make the same choice.” Eventually, she looked at him and said softly.

“I hope you will find happiness in the next life.” He responded.

“Buzz.” Particles appeared in the field and were blown away by the winds.

“Goodbye.” He felt disappointed, unlike her. Nonetheless, their past and emotions remained in this realm. He jumped on the particles to leave this world.

Meanwhile, the members of Sunset Glow were staring intensely at the painting. They saw a freeze in the painting as if the last moments had become eternal and indestructible.

They suddenly got the impression that even if this entire world was destroyed, the painting would still remain.
