Chapter 5518: Immortal Artifact

“Buzz.” The white cloud carried Li Qiye out of the painting.

All eyes were on him instantly but they had nothing to say. No one asked about the secret of the manor or what had transpired in the painting.

Li Qiye smiled at them and didn’t elaborate on the matter for there was no need. This time around, the cloud didn’t return to the painting and soared toward Sunset Peak instead.

“Boom!” A wondrous beam shot upward and illuminated the region.

Li Qiye knew what this was - the power of the immortal artifact taken from Immortal Dao City.

“The artifact!” Everyone was startled, especially Qin Baifeng and Sunset Glow Goddess since this hasn’t happened since their ancestor’s era.

“The grand ceremony starts today, be ready.” She then told everyone.

They listened and prepared for the grand ceremony while still thinking about the phenomenon earlier and the next leader of the valley.

“Young Noble, will you participate? The valley needs you.” The goddess asked Li Qiye.

“I won’t be staying here or anywhere else.” He smiled.

“I see, at the very least, it’s a shame that I am too weak to be a part of your journey, but please be a part of ours.” She said softly while staring at him. Her gentle eyes also contained an unyielding determination, hoping for him to agree.

“Sunset Glow has a successor.” He commented and nodded: “You should know that the dao is endless and not as good as you imagine. The only certainty on this path is how lonely you will be.”

“I am willing to follow your footsteps, Young Noble.” She took a deep breath and said.

“Everyone is free to pick their dao. Let’s go.” He smiled.

“This way, Young Noble.” She happily led the way.

Qin Baifeng bowed and made a gesture of invitation as well.

***

The sound of horns reverberated across the valley. Disciples set aside their tasks and hurried back to Sunset Peak. The ceremony seemed to be starting earlier than expected. Even the mortals ran for the peak, wanting to observe the ceremony.

This was because a new valley lord might be appointed during this session. With the recognition and approval of the artifact, this new leader would be able to take charge and possess enough power to guarantee the valley’s safety.

“Rumble!” The peak seemingly became a colossal gate; its two halves creaked and gradually spread apart.

An auspicious energy engulfed the valley with the hue of the sunset - a truly poetic and picturesque scene. Alas, there was a hint of melancholy as if the sunset had come too late.

With the peak parted, a narrow and elongated valley appeared before everyone. There existed a flickering immortal light deeper inside, seemingly eternal.

Disciples felt that as long as this light was around, nothing would be able to destroy their sect.

“That’s our artifact!” Some shouted excitedly.

Rumor has it that this artifact was the foundation for their current sect. After all, they had nearly faced destruction and the blessings of emperors and monarchs weren’t enough. Confidence was renewed with the rise of Cloudsweep Fairy.

None of them could take a good look beyond the light, unable to grasp the shape and form of the immortal artifact. Nonetheless, it represented an eternal hope.

Sunset Glow Goddess and Qin Baifeng stood by the entrance of the valley. Everyone else watched with bated breath, thinking that the next leader would be one of them.

An old woman appeared before the duo, receiving a bow of respect from all members.

“Matron.” They said with reverence.

Li Qiye had met her back the the temple - the old woman responsible for lighting the lamps.

She turned out to be the oldest ancient ancestor of the valley - the highest authority in the valley. Qin Baifeng and the goddess always asked her for guidance in times of need.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She was one of the few lucky survivors during the sect’s darkest age. She was there when Cloudsweep Fairy first showed up and during her passing.

Her cultivation was once shallow but under the guidance of the fairy, she finished cultivating the Sunset Glow Scripture and became the second strongest.
