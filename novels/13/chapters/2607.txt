The departure of this ancestor silenced the scene. Dissenters could only keep their mouth shut before the might of the federation.

This blood offering would stain the reputation of cultivators and break the unspoken law of not hurting mortals. Alas, they were powerless despite wanting to help.

Cloud Crane was quite powerful and came from a strong system. Unfortunately, all five Heavenly Merchants were present in Mingluo.

The federation’s strongest fighting force was here with the exception of their leader. Anyone would need to weigh themselves before interfering with this injustice.

Losing would mean death on top of implicating their own sect and system.

That’s why this ancestor had no choice but to begrudgingly leave.

The only ones that could pressure the federation were the three behemoths. Anyone else would just be courting death.

“Do it.” Green-robed Heavenly Merchant wore a cold expression and raised his hand, personally presiding over this event.

Everyone felt a suppression in his presence because of his everpresent aura as an Eternal. People felt out of breath as a result and didn’t dare to act recklessly.

The executioners raised their blade after receiving the command.

“No...” The chained captives cried out but it was too late.

“Whoosh!” The blade glinted before coming down. Blood gushed out and heads fell to the ground.

The blood poured into the grooves and stained the ground.

People held their breath at this sight. Some were curious whether this method would work or not.

Rustles happened underground and the soil became loose. Finally, hands started reaching out of the ground and several corpses got up.

“It’s them, this method does work!” People became surprised.

Everyone forgot about the blood offering and the decapitated natives. All eyes were on the corpses.

Some even thought that the federation’s choice wasn’t a waste of time, truly effective.

The reality was that for many of these experts, regular people were only ants. Their heart started beating faster at this development.

Of course, some didn’t appreciate the injustice but since there were benefits and tempting things up for grabs, justice and morals became worthless.

With this new knowledge, someone else would have carried out the blood offering even if the Trade Federation didn’t do so.

Some might be spewing justice from their mouth but they would secretly carry out this measure.

“Rumble!” The disciples from the federation were prepared. They instantly defeated the corpses that got out of the ground and pinned them down.

They took the black stones from the corpses. After losing this essence, the corpses squirmed for a bit before dying for real.

These disciples were fast and skilled to the astonishment of the crowd. Perhaps this wasn’t the first time the Trade Federation has used this blood offering method. They just chose to be blatant this time around.

“Another group.” Unfortunately, no more corpses came out of the ground so Green-robed Heavenly Merchant gave an order without batting an eye.

The second group of natives were brought over - paled with trembling legs.

Several more were decapitated which yielded a few more corpses. Green-robed Heavenly Merchant finally said: “That’s it for today. We’ll continue tomorrow.”

He then left along with the experts from the federation. A stench of blood permeated the air and the soil.

The spectators had different thoughts. Some had fiery eyes, seemingly wanting to try the same thing for the black stones.

After all, they were selling for a sky-high price. Just one could make many risk their lives over it. If they could harvest more with a single attempt, why not resort to a blood offering?

The creed of not involving mortals was thrown out the window right away. However, all the natives were captured by the federation right now. No more baits were available even if they wanted to try. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Qiye was still meditating inside his palace, looking just like a statue.

“Young Noble, please show mercy and save the citizens of Mingluo, they are being used as blood offerings right now.” Lin Yixue beseeched.

Li Qiye didn’t bother opening his eyes. After a while, he said: “Only the strong can control their fate.”

“Bang! Bang! Bang!” She was on her knees and repeatedly slammed her forehead on the floor without holding back. Blood began to drip down.

“Please show mercy, Young Noble.” Youzheng performed the same act.

Yixue continued this process until blood spilled all over the floor, eventually staining her dress.

Li Qiye finally opened his eyes and saw her bloody face. He sighed and waved his sleeve to concede: “Fine, I shall save them out of consideration for you.”

“Thank you, Young Noble.” She bowed her head again as tears flowed out. The bloodied Youzheng did the same.

“Go put bandages on.” He said: “I can’t save them forever. You need to rely on yourself in the future. The system needs you to grow stronger, or it will always be bullied by others.”

“We will do our best.” She clenched her fists.

She has always found herself blessed with happiness - adored by the entire sect. Moreover, Mingluo City enjoyed peace as well. Being weak didn’t deter them from enjoying life.

But now, this feeling of helplessness during a time of crisis overwhelmed her. She couldn’t protect her home and her loved ones. If it wasn’t for Li Qiye, their sect would be gone right now. They wouldn’t be here to talk about protecting the city and its natives.

“The path towards the dao is arduous, I hope you will strive unremittingly with your head held high. Become strong to protect the ones you wish to protect and uphold your ideals.” Li Qiye said.

“I will always bear this in mind, Young Noble.” She trembled, feeling all kinds of emotions. Li Qiye was the only one in the entire world who would stand up for them at this moment.
