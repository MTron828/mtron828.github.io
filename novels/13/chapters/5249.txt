Chapter 5250: Mediocre At Best

“My turn!” Someone suddenly shouted.

“Boom!” Vines drilled out from beneath Li Qiye and coiled around him with astonishing speed. At the same time, they released venomous fluid capable of burning vitality and lifespan.

Everyone looked over and saw a tree demon growing in size - the cultivator behind the attack. After wrapping the enemy, he started lifting Li Qiye into the air.

Some thought that he was being despicable. Although he stated his intention, the attack came a split second later. This was no different from an ambush.

“Devil-vine General!” Some recognized the cultivator who had a penchant for ambushing from underground. This had caught many individuals and countries off guard.

Unfortunately, the gauntlet released an explosion and destroyed the vines. The venomous fluid didn’t affect Li Qiye either.

Devil-vine couldn’t believe it and decided to retreat. Alas, the gauntlet was faster than lightning and quickly grasped the main body.

Li Qiye uprooted the tree and gathered power. The gauntlet’s flames intensified as he spun the tree in the air. The rotational speed increased rapidly and created a lightning maelstrom.

“Whoosh!” He eventually let go and the tree demon disappeared into the horizon. In a remote region, the demon finally fell and smashed into several peaks before hitting the ground.

Just like that, Li Qiye defeated four generals thus far. None was able to block a single move of his gauntlet.

“I’ll give it a shot.” The fifth general still didn’t give up.

He stepped forward and the crowd saw that he had two heads. They weren’t identical and looked more like brothers.

“Hmph-ha General.” Some recognized him instantly due to his unique appearance.

“Get ready.” Hmph-ha General said before splitting into identical clones. However, they were clearly real and not just dao avatars.

“How is he doing this?” A first-timer became startled.

“A skill from birth, or so I’ve heard.” A big shot said while observing the clones.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hmph! Hmph! Hmph…” Half of the clones started humming contemptuously.

“Ha! Ha! Ha…” The other half laughed heartily.

The combination of their voice created sonic waves surrounding Li Qiye before pressing inward.

“Crack!” Space itself was collapsing and a black hole appeared to trap Li Qiye. Meanwhile, more sonic waves shot violently forward to destroy him.

“That’s rather destructive, no wonder why he’s the most feared among the generals.” A famous dragon lord commented, unsure whether she could stop the sonic attack.

Li Qiye simply raised his hand, still unperturbed by the black hole surrounding him. Instead of turning into fortified armor like last time, the gauntlet disassembled and turned into concave shields.

The shields sent back the sonic waves with greater intensity right back at the general. The incoming sonic waves couldn’t neutralize them.

The clones were sent flying while still being battered by their own sonic waves. The real general skidded through the ground and carved out a bloody path. He was mangled to the point of being unrecognizable.

Just one move again. The gauntlet’s retaliatory measure easily took care of Li Qiye’s opponents.

The crowd couldn’t believe their eyes. Suppression Conqueror trembled with excitement while being fully fixated on the gauntlet.

“That thing is too strong.” One crowd member said, fully impressed by this treasure.

Imperial weapons required power and vitality for usage. Some of them even demanded a great cost such as blood or lifespan.

However, this gauntlet or ship didn’t seem to require power channeling. It had an auto response against all attackers. Thus, even a child could have defeated the generals with it.

“Generals? Mediocre at best, not worth mentioning.” Li Qiye commented with a smile.

“Let’s go again then if you dare!” Heaven’s Equal Avian shouted.

“Did you not see what happened just now? Fine, I will send you on your way if you seek death.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Screech!” Heaven’s Equal blotted out the sky by spreading his wings and releasing his frightening aura.
