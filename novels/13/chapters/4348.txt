Chapter 4349: My Turn

“Go!” The intent roared and released a supreme radiance to combat the dark version. It empowered the swords and lit them ablaze.

The new fiery swords tried to cut and burn the existence at the same time. Alas, they only managed to shake it once.

There seemed to be a dark domain around the existence, capable of freezing everything whether it be the radiance or the swords.

The light dissipated and the flames and swords crumbled into pieces. This existence seemed capable of breaking down defenses and reducing everything into a brittle state.

The intent’s defense was extinguished, leaving both it and the young lord vulnerable. The dark existence began burning both of them.

“Ahh!” The young lord’s cries echoed.

Though it was only an intent, everyone felt as if the monarch was actually dying as well.

“Nooo!” The young lord bellowed but it was too late. With the intent gone, his death was all but assured.

In the next second, the hand of the dark existence pierced his chest and robbed him of his vitality and blood. He became a dried corpse in the next second.

His eyes remained wide open, not expecting this end. He had a bright future and plenty of ambition to carry out. Alas, he would never be able to fulfill them. He couldn’t accept dying to an unknown entity and in such a helpless manner as well.

The crowd watched the whole thing in disbelief. The dark existence didn’t seem like it put a lot of effort into destroying the monarch’s intent.

“A lord of darkness?” Chi Jinlin knew that this being was above the level of ancestors.

“It is insane.” Jian Qingzhu realized that no one here could stop this dark existence. If it wanted to, it could murder all of them right now.

“We, we need to r-run…” The leader of a small sect stammered. Unfortunately, his legs didn’t obey his command.

They were fear-stricken and paralyzed before this unbeatable existence.

“We have to, to get back and report this… None of us can subdue it…” An expert turned pale.

“Your Highness-” Another turned towards Chi Jinlin.

Everyone thought that he was the strongest here right now - their sole hope.

Jinlin smiled wryly. Though he was rather capable among the young generation, he knew that fighting this existence would be suicidal.

“Boom!” Just when everyone thought that they were finished, a divine gate suddenly flew over and blocked the dark existence.

“Raa!” It pulsed brightly and released the image of a gigantic wolf howling at heaven. It carried enough force to push the dark existence back.

The latter sensed a threat and turned around right away; its gaze fixated on Li Qiye. Blood rays shot out as it scanned the target.

“Whoosh!” It lunged towards him with unbelievable speed, crushing the fabrics of reality along the way and leaving behind numerous afterimages.

It aimed to pierce Li Qiye’s heart with its claw. Alas, another gate appeared and released the image of a world-sealing mouse.

The claw struck the gate but couldn’t pierce through it, only leaving behind deep fingermarks. However, they gradually disappeared; the gate seemed to have an automatic healing property.

The other three gates joined the fight with their spirit animals - a sky eagle, an earth ant, and a divine bird.

Dao laws echoed and were turned into chains. These five gates created an absolute domain, sealing the dark existence in the center.

“Raa!” The existence attacked the domain with thunderous power and lightning speed.

The resulting shockwaves sent spectators flying for a long time. They became dizzy and lost their composure.

Alas, regardless of the existence’s frenzy and destructive attacks, it couldn’t break through the five gates.

The containment domain not only contained the power of the treasures but also Li Qiye’s own. How could this existence ever escape?

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” Deep prints on the gate disappeared with haste.

“My dao, eternal. My art, heaven sealed…” Li Qiye chanted while forming mudras with both hands.

He then twirled his finger on the lamp and ignited it, revealing its dark nature. The flame was feeble, on the verge of extinguishing.

However, it gave the impression of being able to incinerate the gods and even immortals. The lamp left his grasp and entered the domain of the gates, releasing its flame on the dark existence.

The being became engulfed in a black radiance that was not its own.

“Ahh!” It actually bellowed in pain.

The five gates then closed and sealed the area, imprisoning the being inside. They resembled a great cauldron and no one could see what was happening within.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Numerous palm prints protruded on the exterior - a sign of the existence struggling to break out.

Sizzles could be heard as the cauldron became red and molten from the heat, on the merge of melting away as well.
