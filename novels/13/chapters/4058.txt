Chapter 4059: Starshooter Sword Dao

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Eight-armed Prince took a deep breath to regain his composure. He successfully calmed down and glared at Li Qiye: “Li, you’re too arrogant. There is always a higher sky and a better man…”

“Nonsense, there is no sky higher than mine and no one richer either.” Li Qiye laughed.

His haughtiness couldn’t be contested since it was indeed the truth. Not to mention Sword Continent, perhaps no one in Eight Desolaces could compare to Li Qiye in terms of wealth.

Though this frustrated the crowd, Li Qiye was indeed qualified to make this statement.

“Spending is just a part of my life. In your eyes, it appears to be arrogance. The problem here is due to your wretched, penniless state, thinking that anyone with money is automatically arrogant. Child, stop feeling so insecure, try harder and become more open-minded. Just because someone is better and richer doesn’t mean that they’re arrogant…”

The latter part made Li Qiye sound like a senior sincerely guiding a junior. However, he added with a contemptuous expression: “But in this case, I am indeed arrogant, that’s just my style. You got a problem?”

“!!!” The prince trembled with rage, feeling blood rising up his throat.

The listeners were speechless, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. They put themselves in his shoes and thought that they might act even more arrogant and buy whatever they wanted. Thus, he was actually making sense about how they were mistaking his normal life for haughtiness.

“Li, your dirty money is not omnipotent.” Starshooter Prince stepped forward to support Eight-armed Prince, his ally with a common enemy: “This world is beyond your imagination, money is not enough to flatten everything. One day, you’ll pay for all of this…” He threatened with a menacing expression.

“False, I can do whatever I want because of my money. At the very least, there’s nothing you can do about it.” Li Qiye calmly stated. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I’ll make you see how mistaken you are soon enough.” Starshooter didn’t hide his murderous intent.

“Why wait for later when today will do?” Li Qiye laughed and said: “You’ll see how powerless you are before me right now.”

Having said that, he patted Ning Zhu’s shoulder and ordered: “Teach him a lesson about the result of those who dare to offend me.”

“Li! Fight me if you dare instead of hiding behind a woman!” Starshooter shouted.

“A pleb like you is not qualified to challenge me, the world’s richest. You think a dao lord would take a second glance at you when you challenge one?” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You!” Starshooter turned red with rage.

The listeners found logic in Li Qiye’s harsh responses. A being with his wealth didn’t need to do anything himself. A challenger like Starshooter was utterly insignificant; others would be more than willing to take care of this issue for him.

The princess walked forward, looking calm yet aggressive: “Your Highness, let’s get started.”

“Princess, you wish to be his hound?” The prince uttered coldly.

Spectators found this fascinating and entertaining. Not long ago, Starshooter Prince was extremely respectful of the princess due to her engagement with Peace Ocean Sword King.

Now, she was just Li Qiye’s maid. The shift in her status was matched by his attitude towards her.

Nonetheless, she was also one of the Ten Sword Prodigies. Her background and power were comparable to him. Thus, he showed caution before the battle.

“You need not worry about my personal life. Your Starshooter Sword Dao is brilliant and I wish to learn from it.” The princess remained calm.

The spectators couldn’t wait to see the fight.

“Who’s stronger between these two prodigies?” One expert brought this up.

The Ten Sword Prodigies were the top sword cultivators of the current generation. However, there wasn’t a clear ranking among them. Thus, this fight could give insight into their abilities and battle prowess.

Starshooter Prince was not qualified to cultivate Sea Emperor’s best sword dao such as Abyss or Vastsea.

However, he cultivated the Starshooter Sword Dao. This was still created by a dao lord so it had plenty of potentials.

“Starshooter Sword Dao versus Wooden Sword’s techniques, this is absolutely worth watching.” Others clamored.

“Which sword dao does the princess know?” A curious youth asked.

“I don’t think it’s Jade Bamboo Dao Lord’s sword dao but their progenitor, Wooden Sword Holy Devil’s technique.” Someone with a strong understanding of Ning Zhu answered.

“So which will be stronger?!” Excitement soared among the crowd.

“Since you wish to fight, so be it!” Starshooter Prince stepped forward.

He was in a tough position and couldn’t back down in public. After all, they had the same status so he needed to save face by fighting.

“Clank!” He unsheathed his sword, releasing resplendent light of the celestial affinity.

“Boom!” He channeled his energy and opened his fate palaces. The sky became replaced by a boundless galaxy filled with stars, looking like diamonds embedded on a black flannel sheet.

The starry lights were gorgeous but within them was a murderous intent. Each strand could pierce through his opponents with ease.
