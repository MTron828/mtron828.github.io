Chapter 5791: Mortal Against Mortal

“You will find no inspiration from me, Sacred Teacher, a trip is necessary for it is your chosen path.” Jiao Heng said.

“Yes, the path to be taken, and I’ve done it once.” Li Qiye smiled.

“How was it?” Jiao Heng became interested. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Li Qiye stroked his chin and replied: “Not enough since it is different without that piece.”

“And here you are, trying to find inspiration from me.” Jiao Heng laughed.

“It’s not up to me, if you don’t want to do it, it’s just a waste of my time.” Li Qiye said.

“I can confirm nothing on me can help you with your goal. What you seek lies beyond this mortal world, you need not attempt to shake my pure aspiration.” Jiao Heng said.

Li Qiye shook his head and said: “Aspiration and dao heart are determined and carried out by the self, they aren’t influenced by external factors. That’s just an excuse to escape blame and responsibility.”

“Your understanding of the dao heart is greater than anyone else in history.” Jiao Heng said sentimentally.

“Because I’m a mortal, a true mortal.” Li Qiye said: “I had to bolster my dao heart one step at a time on this path. There is a toll for taking shortcuts, and it comes knocking sooner or later.”

“Sacred Teacher, I was mistaken. No one can indeed influence my decision.” Jiao Heng admitted.

“That is why your choice determines everything, staying a mortal or transcending.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It is an impossibility. As I’ve said, it’s all severed.” Jiao Heng disagreed.

“The truth of your origin cannot be severed or changed to non-existence.” Li Qiye insisted.

“I know myself best, I am fully mortal now.” Jiao Heng said: “Your journey cannot be avoided. Let’s get back to the task at hand, this mech is amazing and requires an opponent of your level to test it out.”

“Very well, come.” Li Qiye gestured with his hand.

Meanwhile, their sudden and cryptic dialogue puzzled virtually everyone, whether they be from The People or Celestial Court. They felt like monks scratching their head only never to find hair.

“Sacred Teacher, please give this mortal guidance.” Jiao Heng laughed and said.

“I, another mortal, look forward to this.” Li Qiye chuckled at the joke.

“Mortal against mortal, how amusing.” Jiao Heng remarked before shouting: “From truth to origination!”

“Boom!” His twelve wills became one and his anima power erupted.

A new radiance manifested into reality, splitting the sky vault. This aura didn’t belong to an emperor. Primordial strands circled his true fate and true self, removing time and adding infinity.

The mech seemingly gained life, shedding its metallic presence and becoming a living being.

“Seeing the origin.” World Emperor who could still observe the fight commented: “Ancestor realm.”

“Breaking the limit.” Emperors nearby glanced at World Emperor.

“Dao Brother, you can do it?” Fan Chen asked World.

Everyone stared at him and knew that he was the best candidate.

World only smiled and said: “The realm has been reached long ago.”

“Yes, the founder and the three immortals.” Calamity said.

“It’s not easy becoming one given the circumstances.” Ren Xian sighed.

“And that makes it worth it, the difficulty allows one to travel farther. Brother, you and those from the nine worlds will surpass us.” World said.

The Immortal Emperors exchanged glances after hearing this.

“None of us can compare to you, Dao Brother.” Fan Chen disagreed.

“We’re all only just starting. Once you all start the ascend, you’ll leave all of us behind. In my opinion, this was the case for Min Ren, Gu Chun, and the others.” World shook his head while causing everyone else to contemplate.

His logic was sound - becoming an emperor in the nine worlds was more difficult than on the thirteen continents.

Only one could show up in the lower world while the thirteen continents could have several. Something similar was happening in Eight Desolaces and the six continents. Those ascending often became just as strong if not stronger after being given ample time.

Although they agreed that World was the best among them currently, this might not be the case later on.

There was a realm above and taking the next step meant reaching a new beginning. Immortal Emperor Gu Chun and Min Ren have embarked on this path. Perhaps they were Ancestors or even supreme overlords now.

“You’re right, just the beginning.” Ren Xian agreed.

“We have a long road ahead of us.” World nodded.

“I am satisfied here.” Fan Chen smiled.

“Brothers, our aspirations may differ and only time will tell. Nevertheless, we must strive forward without giving up.” World said.

“Indeed.” Everyone shared the same conviction, especially those who had gotten a taste of the primordial mysteries and used their powers.

This made them realize how much farther they could go.
