Chapter 3738: Hu Ben Of Vajra

Climbing up Minor Sacred Mountain was no easy task due to the innate pressure found here. The lowest steps still required the conqueror level.

Many began the ascend. The moment their feet made contact with the step, they felt the pressure pressing down on their shoulders - akin to carrying ten mountains.

The higher they went, the heavier the force - causing their bones to creak.

Nonetheless, they tried their very best. This served as a pilgrimage to pay their respect for the dao lords and sages. Furthermore, one would be hard-pressed to find a better spot for training.

333 steps, normally, were nothing for cultivators. This wasn’t the case here. Each step was akin to walking barefoot across a thousand miles within a desert.

For some, they would find it impossible to go further. The steps served as an uncrossable wall.

For example, starting at Virtuous Rank, the pressure more than doubled. The conqueror-level cultivators had no choice but to stop.

Conqueror and Virtuous Rank also served as a measurement of sorts. The youths capable of reaching the latter were definitely geniuses.

The successful ones had a joyous and prideful expression after reaching Virtuous Rank. After all, this was their time to show the world what they were capable of.

They looked back and saw many peers unable to move upward, unlike them. This was an achievement equal to Dugu Lan, Phantom Sacred Child, and Hu Ben.

“Rumble!” The world suddenly quaked; the loud explosions startled the ascenders.

After listening closely, the noises sounded like a cavalry galloping across a paved street, loud enough to hurt the eardrums.

They looked over and saw billowing dust. Indeed, it was a cavalry rushing forward like a tsunami.

The shine of their golden armor was blinding. The members looked mighty and sharp like thrusting spears.

“Boom!” They stopped at the base of Minor Sacred Mountain.

Just a second ago, the troops were moving at full force yet they stopped at the same time. These riders seemed to be one entity, capable of moving freely as a whole. The spectators couldn’t help becoming impressed.

“War Camp of Vajra.” The banners made the background of these troops obvious.

This was Vajra’s largest and strongest legion - one of their pillars.

“This particular group is Hu Ben’s.” Someone noticed the markings on the auxiliary banner.

“He’s finally here.” Another expert noticed him leading the group.

The leader wore golden armor and had an impressive stature, looking extremely gallant. His helm had a special symbol, looking like a thunderbolt descending from above.

Despite his young age, he had plenty of accolades on the battlefield. Many fell victims to his blade.

Vajra Dynasty took his development and training quite seriously due to his talents. He spent his youth training in Martial Hall. After sufficient mastery, he entered War Camp and became the youngest general there in no time at all on top of having the most potential.

His focus was on maintaining peace at the border, defeating enemies time and time again. Eventually, Archaic Sun King bestowed him with an official title - Peacekeeper Grand Commander.

Next to him was the third prince of Vajra. This wasn’t surprising at all because when the third prince was at the border, he received a lot of help from Hu Ben.

Hu Ben was clearly supporting the third prince. This played a large part in War Camp’s support for him.

Hu Ben jumped off his horse and looked around. As a battle-hardened general, he always had a fierce and murderous air around him - a stark contrast to his age yet felt perfect on him.

“The members of the holy ground have the responsibility to uphold its prestige even if it means death.” Hu Ben’s eyes flashed with lightning.

“Worthy of being one of the four geniuses.” One youth was moved.

“Not just that, he’s the disciple of a grandmaster.” A cultivator from Vajra quietly said.

Hu Ben was considered the best genius in Vajra. Rumor has it that he was the guardian’s disciple. This remained unconfirmed by the court.

Hu Ben made it past Conqueror to Virtuous Rank in no time at all without stopping once, impressing the crowd in the process.

“I’ll wait here for the letter.” He then sat down on the step and said.

Those nearby didn’t dare to disturb him and only nodded their head to greet him.

“Three of the four geniuses are here today.” One spectator said.

With the exception of Golden Cicada Buddhist Child, the rest expressed their view and would certainly come here.

Phantom Sacred Child arrived a bit later. His arrival was far more low-key since he came alone, only accompanied by a purple fog. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

No one saw how he got there; it was as if he emerged from the fog.

“Phantom Sacred Child is here now.” Numerous shouted after seeing his figure.

The lack of fanfare didn’t stop the crowd from noticing him. He had the most potential among his tribe on top of being a direct disciple of a grandmaster. Any of this was enough to make him stand out among his peers.

“Phantom Sky Step.” Someone from the previous generation had to praise: “What an amazing movement technique, few can keep up with it.”

The sacred child was famous for his agility thanks to this technique. Many ancestors stronger than him still couldn’t catch him.

His figure shook once and he made it to Virtuous Rank right away, not far from the altar.

The third prince immediately greeted him along with the other geniuses. He was far more amiable compared to Hu Ben.

A moment later, a clear voice sounded: “I apologize for making everyone wait.”

The crowd became excited after hearing this voice.
