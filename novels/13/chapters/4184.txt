People could only stare at the palace attached to the cliff. Attacking and entering were impossible even though they were awfully tempted by the legendary swords inside.

“Is there really no way?” Conversations sparked.

Someone suggested for everyone to team up: “We need to work together to defeat this dragon first, then everyone can get inside. Afterward, we’ll rely on our own abilities for the prizes inside.”

“That’s not fair. People might throw away their lives for only a few to obtain the divine swords? The majority will be sacrificial pawns.” Someone else said.

“Since when is fairness a thing? If that’s the case, then everyone can become dao lords.” A big shot disagreed.

“I don’t think it’s a bad idea.” Another expert said: “I’m more so afraid of people holding back, only wanting to take advantage of the situation.”

“Can’t do this, can’t do that, then why the hell are we even here? Might as well stay home with the wife and kids.” Someone else snorted.

Everyone had their own thoughts and agenda. Thus, no decision was made.

“Sect Master Shi, do you have an opinion on this matter?” A clan master asked Shi Yingxue.

Her presence was a sight for sore eyes. She was both attractive and dignified. Her innate elegance stopped others from having dirty thoughts.

She was the sect master of Armament, one of the Six Kings. Her power and status couldn’t be questioned.

Therefore, people quieted down and waited for her guidance. They needed a leader to launch an offense on this dragon palace. She became a top candidate.

“I’m just here to watch.” She smiled and said: “I’m sure the sword saint will have a better idea.”

“Rumble!” The moment she finished, people heard loud explosions and rays coming from a carriage in the distance. It looked like a sun was approaching.

“Nine-sun Sword Saint!” Others finally noticed.

A middle-aged man came out of the carriage. He had golden hair and looked quite gallant and spirited, clearly a heartthrob during his youth. He resembled a sun god with an innate divinity.

“I didn’t know the saint was so handsome.” Others were surprised and charmed by his external appearance. Many felt jealous as well.

There were plenty of younger and good-looking prodigies present. Alas, none of them matched up to him, whether it be their aura or style. Some female cultivators fell in love at fight sight.

“He was the world’s most handsome during his prime.” A last-gen cultivator laughed.

“Yes, both he and Terra Sword Saint are up there.” An elder agreed.

“Nine-sun Sword Saint is way more handsome.” Someone who had seen Terra Sword Saint back at Cloud Dream Lake said: “No one can compare to him right now.”

Age was not a problem when one was as good-looking as Nine-sun Sword Saint.

“Terra Sword Saint is not inferior, just different.” A big shot commented.

Both saints were the leader of their respective groups and were well-respected by the community.

Terra Sword Saint’s charm was more subdued while Nine-sun Sword Saint was dazzling like his title. Though they were listed as equals, Terra Sword Saint was actually far older.

Since both were famous, many often compared the two. They didn’t have much to go with because the saints normally kept a low profile and didn’t show off.

Nine-sun Sword Saint looked around; his sharp eyes were chilling. The crowd was intimidated since his reputation preceded him.

He gazed at the dragon palace in silence. Meanwhile, everyone else waited with bated breath. It became abundantly clear that they viewed him as a leader and would obey his commands.

“Sect Master Shi, do you have anything in mind?” He withdrew his gaze and asked Shi Yingxue.

“You think too highly of me, Sword Saint. I am no match for this palace but if you need my assistance, I will try my best.” She shook her head.

“Right, the two of us can’t break it down.” The sword saint said: “If you are interested, we can invite the Flame Valley Lord and Brother Terra as well.”

The crowd became excited and impatient right away. If these other masters were to come, then they would be a force to be reckoned with. The probability of success became far higher.

Of course, only cultivators such as Nine-sun Sword Saint and Shi Yingxue had the status to make this request.

“Hmm, the eighth grave is tempting indeed.” Shi Yingxue sentimentally said.

There were enough rewards here to warrant the risk.

“Make way, make way.” A man demanded the crowd to make a path. Sure enough, they actually listened.

“It’s Li Qiye.” Others were surprised to see him.

The entire world knew of his name by now, whether it be his reputation as the world’s richest or as a miracle-creator.

“The sorcerer is here.” One expert whispered.

“He wants the divine dragon sword too?” An old cultivator who was familiar with Li Qiye became surprised.

“I actually think he can do it.” A big shot chuckled after seeing him.

“Is he that amazing?” An unaware junior asked: “The sword saint himself said he couldn’t do it alone, isn’t Li Qiye just a new rich? He can recruit more Heavenly Sovereigns but is that enough?”

“Money is not omnipotent but Li Qiye is. There is no predicting him.” The big shot responded.

Nonetheless, the majority still doubted Li Qiye’s ability to break this palace down.

“This will be fun with him here, we got a good show waiting for us.” A spectator didn’t care about this at all. She just knew that this would be entertaining.

“Young Noble, you wish to enter the dragon palace?” Shi Yingxue came over and asked Li Qiye.

“I’m not interested in it.” Li Qiye smiled and tapped on Chen Cangsheng’s shoulder: “But this brat isn’t bad, I’m here to give him a fortune.”

Shi Yingxue understood that Chen Cangsheng was lucky enough to get into Li Qiye’s good graces.
