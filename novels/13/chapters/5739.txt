Chapter 5740: Splitting The Sky

Others shuddered after sensing her aura - another apex cultivator.

“Nightmoon!” Sword Emperor certainly didn’t wish to see her.

He was her only focus on the battlefield as she declared: “His life is mine.”

Those aware of the past didn’t find this surprising. She had attacked Celestial Court before to take his life.

A few were privy to her past. She came from the Qian as well - one of their nine emperors. Her title used to be Heavenly Emperor Suyun. [1]

Rumor has it that every emperor of the Qian had been killed, some by Sword Emperor himself. Heavenly Emperor Su Yun no longer appeared afterward so everyone thought she was also part of the list.

Later on, a conqueror with the title of Nightmoon rose meteorically and defeated everyone, going as far as attacking Celestial Court and calling out Sword Emperor.

A few ancient emperors and monarchs understood that she was still alive and somehow became Nightmoon Conqueror - a dreadful being with a primordial dao fruit, far stronger than before.

They believed that she suffered grievous injuries during the war and was teleported to an unknown location in the lower three continents by her father. She woke up a long time later, only to find the destruction of her clan. Moreover, her injuries persisted.

They speculated her next step was joining the academy and destroying her damaged dao - a precarious choice. Nonetheless, this turned out fruitful since she gained a primordial dao fruit and anima.

Therefore, they weren’t surprised to see her here, attempting to kill Sword Emperor once more.

“Very well, I leave it to you, Fellow Daoist.” Immortal Emperor Ren Xian moved to a different part of the battlefield.

“Die!” She summoned a crescent moon and used it like a hook.

“Bam!” Sword Emperor parried with his heavenly blade and retreated with lightning speed, seemingly having no intent of fighting her.

She would not let him leave and clasped her hands together, shooting out a lunar pulse in his direction.

Meanwhile, Immortal Emperor Ren Xian joined the fight against Heaven Burial Conqueror.

The latter was unstoppable with his divine ring, keeping up with both Immortal Monarch Fengying and Vajra Conqueror. However, it became a different story with another combatant joining the fray.

“Go!” Heaven Burial roared and sent the divine ring forward, breaking through numerous stars.

“Boom!” The impact nearly destroyed the entire region, causing a stalemate between the ring and the blade.

Fengying and Vajra took advantage of this, sending a draconic thrust and the vajra from two different directions.

Heaven Burial waved his hand and connected numerous divine rings, creating a defensive chain around him.

Unfortunately, most of his power was being used to stop Ren Xian so this defensive measure crumbled.

He alone couldn’t handle three apex cultivators, especially one as strong as Ren Xian. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Crack!” He was sent flying while vomiting blood.

“Don’t let up!” Fengying pressed onward, sending a roaring true dragon at the wounded combatant.

“Boom!” Vajra chanted and tossed his weapon into the air. It became gigantic and destroyed dao laws during its descent.

“We’ll see about that!” Heaven Burial relied on the ring and its three thousand broken worlds to stop the duo.

As for Ren Xian, he didn’t press the issue and flew to another battlefield.

“Fellow Daoist, have a taste of my blade too!” His target was none other than Light-dragon Conqueror.

Blessed by the countless sages, his power became eternal. The slash cut through time and space, never to extinguish.

“Lightbreak!” Light-dragon swung his saber in retaliation, sending out a light slash and splitting the sky into two halves. This move alone could create a new border between heaven, hell, and the mortal realm.

Alas, he didn’t have enough time to gather power so his slash couldn’t stop Ren Xian’s sword, resulting in his chest being struck. Nonetheless, his light armor prevented the sword from piercing through him.

This momentary distraction allowed Demon to take advantage of the situation, thrusting her spear through the same opening.

The light armor was able to stop Ren Xian’s blade, not Demon Nightspear. It pierced through Light-dragon’s chest, causing him to bellow in pain and turn pale.

He recoiled backward and blood sprayed in all directions, staining his light armor red. If it wasn’t for the armor, he might have met a tragic end to that spear already.

1. I looked this up but Suyun is the name of her sister, I’m unsure why her title is her sister’s name instead of her own, Suxin. Maybe it is to remember her missing sister. I’m also unsure whether I had translated this title 3,000 chapters ago during the 10 worlds arc. It would be Whitecloud or Purecloud but I couldn’t find it either ?
