Chapter 5641: Blood Waterfall

“Thank you for the gift, Sacred Teacher.” Immortal Emperor Bai Lian understood that this was the extent of his fateful connection with Li Qiye. He bowed his head one more time before standing up and leaving.

After he was gone, Thousand-hand Dao Lord prostrated and said: “Greetings, Sacred Teacher.”

She came from Ancestral Divine Temple of Lion’s Roar in Eight Desolaces; her connection with Li Qiye was deeper.

“The progenitor always taught us to serve you, Sacred Teacher.” She said, referring to Chi Xiaodie who was also known as Supreme Monarch or Nightyearn Butterfly Monarch.

She was once a disciple of the temple and had been taught by Chi Xiaodie. She didn’t let her progenitor down and eventually became a dao lord.

“Decent job at cultivation.” Li Qiye stared at her and said: “Still need further refinement.”

“I will strive diligently.” She responded.

“I’m going to take a look.” He glanced forward.

“May we follow you to broaden our horizon, Sacred Teacher?” Sindragon asked, not wanting to miss this chance. 

Thousand-hand felt the same way.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye smiled.

Sindragon turned back into his gigantic form and carried the other two forward with haste.

“Have you gone this far before, Fellow Daoist?” Sindragon asked.

Thousand-hand came earlier and delved deeper into this region.

“There’s a blood waterfall up ahead but the vitality there is too much for me to endure. I left and saw the samsara vessel, prompting the battle with Immortal Emperor Bai Lian.” Thousand-hand responded.

“The vitality aura is that dreadful there?” Sindragon shuddered after hearing this.

Thousand-hand was certainly stronger than him yet she still couldn’t endure it.

“I don’t know what it is.” She shook her head: “I’ve never seen a vitality aura like this one, but Demon Conqueror did warn me that it might have something to do with High Heaven Aegis. Something happened during the foundation of that place, ending with this blood waterfall and the creation of Lightning Realm.”

“I heard something similar.” Sindragon said: “The strategy was concocted long ago, using Bi’an Beastworld as the foundation along with Nirvana Primal Tree. Then four bloodlines combined the empress with everyone else, extending to the rest of the defensive realm. This connection made it possible for them to win the war.”

“The problem lies in the bloodlines.” Thousand-hand said: “I don’t know the exact details, who knows if anyone had made it to High Heaven Aegis recently? I wonder what is going on there.”

“Right, people don’t even know where it is.” Sindragon smiled wryly.

Rumor has it that without High Heaven Aegis, Imperial Field would have been blown to smithereens. The connection established by this special area allowed the empress and the others to be competitive against the darkness. Otherwise, it could have led to the destruction of the immortal continent.

Thus, everyone knew that High Heaven Aegis might just be as potent as Immortal Dao City. One was created by the effort of amazing cultivators while the other was a heavenly treasure.

“Sacred Teacher, what is your opinion on this?” Thousand-hand asked Li Qiye.

“A bloodline atavism that couldn’t be controlled.” Li Qiye said: “An eruption meant dragging High Heaven Aegis down with it along with all the members.”

“What a ridiculous bloodline, it shouldn’t exist in this world.” Sindragon recalled the blood worms in his body.

“Right, I’ve never seen anything like it before.” Thousand-hand had goosebumps while recalling the events in this ocean of blood.

“This is not that frightening.” Li Qiye said: “Once you see the ancient ming, then you will see the difference.”

“We have heard of them before, they were exterminated by you, Sacred Teacher.” Sindragon said.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t say anything else.

“We’re here, it’s right there.” Thousand-hand pointed ahead.

Before them was a blood waterfall descending into the ocean of blood. Strangely enough, there was not a hint of sound despite the scale, only an eerie silence.

One could look up and never see the source of the waterfall. It seemed to be coming from the high heaven. Thus, the impact should create thunderous splashes. Alas, there was nothing to hear.

In fact, the waterfall didn’t look like it was flowing despite certainly doing so. It appeared to have solidified and turned into a frozen blood wall. The very nature of this silent and motionless blood waterfall was incomprehensible.

It seemed endless, most likely the source of the entire ocean and Lightning Realm. It also emitted a strange blood mist - virtually imperceptible to the naked eye.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, after meticulous scrutiny, one would notice blood cells floating among the mist, always ready to multiply or drain the life of those touched by them.

Sindragon noticed the mist and activated a draconic barrier. The aura protected him from all sides but this wasn’t sufficient.

“Zzz….” His wings started rotting and the spread continued.

“Activate!” He summoned all twelve dao fruits, wanting to use chaos true energy to expel the decaying force.

His overwhelming strength couldn’t stop this force either. The rest of his body started decaying to his dismay.
