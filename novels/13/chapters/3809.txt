Chapter 3810: Heavenseize Spear

No one expected the scion to suddenly surrender. Most thought that they still hadn’t fought.

Furthermore, the scion was winning in terms of aura and momentum, hence the illogical development.

Of course, they would want nothing more than a win for Dugu Lan. It just didn’t seem right for him to give up under these circumstances.

“We won?” A spectator remained skeptical.

Only the older experts were able to see the details of the exchange earlier.

“That depends on your definition of victory.” One powerful ancestor remarked while still thinking about the fight. He didn’t directly state a clear winner.

“You’re being humble.” Dugu Lan disagreed as well: “If this is considered a win, then I’ll be embarrassed.”

“I can’t catch up to your sword dao when it’s millions of years away. In that case, how can I even think about winning?” The scion laughed.

The ancestors then realized that the scion didn’t have a way to reach her with his spear. Thus, his power became useless on the temporal scale, hence his swift admission of defeat.

“So it is a win...” Most only had a vague concept of what had transpired but this was still a victory confirmation.

“That’s why First Sister is number one in our academy!” The students from Duality started celebrating.

Other young experts raised their fist and shouted: “No, she’s the number one genius in all of the holy ground!”

Her victory earned crucial points for the holy ground, hence the celebration.

“I wouldn’t call it winning, just using a trick for the upper hand.” Dugu Lan said: “If this is a win, it will be an honorless one. I would rather have a direct fight to see your cultivation.”

“Your mindset is commendable, Fairy Dugu.” The scion was in good spirits as he replied: “If you wish to continue, then I’ll be more than happy to entertain you. It’ll give me a chance to see the rest of the sword art from the ancient emperor.”

The cheers abruptly stopped as the crowd exchanged glances. Since Dugu Lan herself said that it wasn’t a clean victory, it would be silly for them to continue cheering. They felt rather awkward as a result.

Of course, Dugu Lan didn’t care about this trivial matter. She continued: “I need to rely on the wise ones of the past in order to make up for my current inadequacies.”

“I can say the same because my cultivation is thanks to the help of the sages and ancestors.” The scion solemnly responded.

“Either way, let us continue to see the actual victor.” Dugu Lan smiled. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“So be it!” The scion’s eyes became fierce and bright again.

He summoned his weapon, a resplendent spear. The individual rays could pierce through eyes like needles. It had seven engraved orbs, looking like seven planets.

The orbs then started floating around the spear, releasing a domineering aura just like a primal beast. This terrible aura came from the spear itself; the scion has yet to empower it with his own energy.

“I named this spear Heavenseize.” The scion elaborated: “It is made from the dao bone of a resplendent god crow infused with gold star metal ingots. If I ever get to prove my dao in the future, I shall make it my patrimony weapon.”

“The dao bone of a resplendent god crow?!” A few ancestors were surprised to hear this.

“This dao bone is that amazing?” One youth became curious.

“It’s a high-level heaven dao bone of a king beast, extremely precious and valuable.” One ancestor nodded.

The listeners took a deep breath after hearing this. This material grade was often only used by dao lords. No wonder why the scion said that he would keep it as his signature weapon.

Moreover, the gold star metal ingots were precious as well. Thus, the result was nothing short of extraordinary.

“It’s a fine weapon.” Dugu Lan praised before releasing her vitality and fate palaces.

“Rumble!” One palace emerged after another. They poured down eternal dao laws.

“Twe-twelve fate palaces!” Everyone was stunned, including the students from Duality.

“She really has twelve palaces!” Some needed to do a recount.

Prior to this, they were sure that she was at the very peak of the grand dao sacred level with eleven palaces. Now, with twelve palaces, it meant that she was an heir, ready for the next step.

“Will she pick the path of the dao lord or sovereign?” This became the next question.

“First Sister is the best!” The students from Duality became excited again.

Since Righteous Scion was an heir, people assumed that she was at a disadvantage. This was an immense gap that couldn’t be made up.

Now, hopelessness was replaced by excitement. It didn’t matter which path she would pick. At the very least, the two was on a level playing field now.
