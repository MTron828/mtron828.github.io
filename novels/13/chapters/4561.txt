Chapter 4562: Oriole From Behind

The daoist took out numerous shells from ancient times. Barely discernible cracks were there. Perhaps they were larger once but due to continuous rubbing and polishing, they nearly became flat.

The texture resembled metal instead of a regular turtle shell. Each seemed to be immensely heavy. A weaker cultivator would break their hands if they tried to catch one.

Tiny dao lines wove together like threads inside the shells but in reality, they were still independent of each other and didn’t actually touch. This seemed to be a form of spatial and temporal manipulation.

He grabbed one of them and started chanting. It was difficult for listeners to tell whether this was a merit law or a mantra.

“Formation!” He roared and the shell in his hand flew outside.

“Clank! Clank!” The other shells fell down and scattered randomly on the ground.

Upon careful inspection, there was an actual order to their arrangement. The dao lines from the shells began harmonizing with each other.

The daoist formed a mudra with both hands while still chanting. The shells lit up and the dao lines released individual temporal rays. They could travel back to the past and allow someone to see the scene of their birth.

Runes appeared on the ground beneath the skeletal duck and connected with each other, summoning a passage to the river of time.

This was considered an attack so the skeletal duck wanted to attack. Its movement was simple - just a peck capable of piercing through all things and taking life away.

Alas, time oozed out from below and engulfed it. It then disappeared and returned to the past.

It saw its birthplace - a green field with mountains over yonder. Everything was beautiful and familiar to the duck. It found itself alive once more with life force flowing through it. This naturally captivated its thoughts.

The shells were ultimate treasures from the daoist’s clan. It didn’t have any offensive potential, only allowing someone to look at their past. Unfortunately for the reader, only the target could see the divination.

This was Jian Ming’s time to take action. He roared the name of his treasure: “River Sunset Sphere!”

A bright moon appeared above him along with billowing smoke. He flew through the smoke and was able to enter the river of time, precisely the period and area when the skeletal duck was born.

As the duck was immersed in the feeling of being alive again on top of seeing the distant past, Jian Ming locked on to his target.

The space above the duck’s back suddenly melted at an incredible rate. Jian Ming leaped through this spatial breakdown while grabbing the golden egg.

The duck immediately regained its wits and looked up, only to see Jian Ming disappearing back into the present day. However, the duck’s stare alone grievously injured him.

“Ugh…” He appeared through a temporal hole again and landed on the bridge, vomiting a mouthful of blood.

The duck also returned to the present day and activated its aura. This caused the spell to break and the daoist to vomit blood as well.

“Go!” The duo carried out the last part of their plan, jumping off the bridge.

Once back in the current dimension, the duck became dead again. No one knew if it noticed the missing egg. The only thing on its mind was to cross the bridge; it had no intention of giving chase.

“Ugh…” The two landed on the ground and spat out more blood. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just being stared at by the duck left them grievously wounded. In fact, the stares were only coincidental. The duck didn’t have enough malice behind it or they would have been killed on the spot.

“We did it…” Jian Ming was ecstatic to be holding the egg.

The daoist felt the same way. They carried out Li Qiye’s plan perfectly. Without his advice, they wouldn’t have been able to obtain the egg before being pecked.

“They actually did it!” The crowd couldn’t believe it.

After the initial astonishment, many stared at the golden egg with greed in their eyes. This was potentially a divine beast for their sect.

“Boom!” A figure landed from the air - Godwhip Princess.

The duo naturally didn’t like this development.

“My sect wishes to buy this golden egg. Name the price.” The noble lady in armor spoke in a commanding manner. She resembled a goddess of war.

“Bah, just say that you want to rob us.” Jian Ming wasn’t affected and barked back: “We don’t give a damn about what your poor sect can offer.”

“You sure talk big.” Her eyes turned cold as she walked toward the two.

The crowd knew that the price didn’t matter. The golden egg’s value exceeded anything they could offer.

“Go!” The two exchanged glances and ran toward Li Qiye.

They weren’t gentlemen who cared about honor and reputation. In their eyes, nothing was more important than staying alive. Running from a losing battle was just fine.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” She summoned a divine spear and released a torrent of energy rays.

They pierced the ground and caused spectators nearby to feel pain everywhere despite being far away.

“I got this!” Jian Ming summoned a great wall to stop the incoming rays.

“I haven’t forgotten about your insult earlier, you’re not going anywhere.” Six-winged Emissary shouted and joined the hunt.
