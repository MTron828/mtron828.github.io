Chapter 5230: What Immortal?

First, Boss Tang introduced this final auction as an immortal-level item. Now, he further revealed that it came from the outside - this certainly changed everything.

His auctions always included the greatest treasure but he didn’t use the word “immortal” trivially. Therefore, it must be something infinitely close to the described level.

“Can you elaborate on its origin, where did it come from?” Immensity Conqueror asked with a soothing tone.

“Not from Eight Desolaces or the six continents.” Boss Tang smiled.

Listeners exchanged glances after hearing this. Which world was capable of birthing such an item?

“Above the high heaven then?” Skysword Dao Lord became emotional.

“From above?” Cultivators currently staying in Imperial Attendant looked up at the sky after hearing this.

“Is there anything up there?” Someone murmured.

The three geniuses immediately thought about the possibilities. This issue was still out of reach for them.

“No, no.” Boss Tang said: “If I can get an immortal item from above, it means that I am capable of ascending up there. Why would I bother with this small business instead of having a jolly good time above?”

He still spoke arrogantly despite having a prestigious audience.

“There are more worlds outside, not counting above?” Big shots started wondering about this issue.

As far as they knew, there were Eight Desolaces and their six continents. Another world above was only a legend.

Older cultivators such as Immensity Conqueror didn’t say anything. They had a different perspective on this matter because they knew about the expeditions from the emperors in the ancient ages. Perhaps their destination was where Boss Tang got the item.

“In any case, the eventual winner of the item will not regret anything.” Boss Tang said with confidence, looking like a shrewd merchant boasting about his remarkable merchandise.

“Okay, I don’t care which treasure is your target, it’s too late to say that you’re not sufficiently prepared.” He added: “Everyone knows the rules, it’s not about the value of the auctions, it’s about whether I’m interested in your offerings. As for conqueror treasures or whatever, don’t even bother. I have a ship full of them already.”

The crowd thought that he was offending some of the conquerors in the audience. Of course, they didn’t actually mind since they knew he was right.

This auction was completely different. The most important thing was gaining the interest of Boss Tang. This required high-value treasures with unique properties to them.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

None of the thirteen representatives had an issue with the rule.

“Alright, here is the first treasure.” Boss Tang clapped his hand and the first treasure appeared - a ruler imbued with celestial affinities.

It wasn’t particularly bright but anyone looking at it would shudder at least once.

“Heaven Reckon, the legacy of Golden Temple and was once in the possession of the immortal. Today, it has fallen into the mortal realm.” Boss Tang raised his voice for the introduction.

“What immortal?” Jue Xian’er was the first to react.

“Hehe, not something I can discuss, it’s fine if you don’t believe me. Heaven Reckon is right before you, its history is as clear as day.” He glanced at the sacred monk after saying this.

“Amitabha. This is indeed Heaven Reckon. We lost it long ago and today, I shall welcome it back to Pure Land.” The monk placed his palms together.

Of course, no one doubted the authenticity of Boss Tang’s merchandise. Most were more curious about this so-called “immortal” in the description even though they had previously established that immortals didn’t exist.

“It can measure the heaven’s wills, meaning the future. If anyone wants a fortune, it can also give reliable clues.” Boss Tang continued.

No one started yet because not all were here for Heaven Reckon. Most were more curious about the final treasure.

“My master found a black jade from Night Marsh.” Xiao Qingtian presented a box with numerous seals.

Given their power, they were clearly created by Illumination Conqueror. He opened the box and revealed the jade.

It was also sealed by a special method from the conqueror. This was necessary because it seemed alive, always ready to escape.

A mysterious life force flowed around it - something new entirely to the spectators.

“Nirvana Blackstone.” Boss Tang was impressed to see the item: “Quite impressive of the conqueror to catch something like this.”

“Are you willing to make the trade?” Xiao Qingtian became excited because having the ruler could take him to the next height.

“No rush, no rush, you’re just the first bidder.” Boss Tang smiled.

Xiao Qingtian heard this and regretted losing his cool. Nonetheless, the crowd was certainly moved by the jade. Its effect should be to boost vitality and cultivation. Only characters of Illumination Conqueror could catch something like this.
