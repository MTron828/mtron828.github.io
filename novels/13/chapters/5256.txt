Chapter 5257: No Regrets

“It’s not sorcery, just a simple block.” Li Qiye answered with a smile.

Everyone took a deep breath after hearing this. Blocking Chaos Flurry without resorting to merit laws and techniques? Even a three-year-old knew how to block.

Suppression Conqueror was at a loss for words since he knew the might of his technique. Now, he began to see a hint behind Li Qiye’s statement regarding despair.

He felt helpless. Sure, Chaos Flurry was not his strongest ace card but it represented eighty to ninety percent of his power. This situation was unprecedented even during his battles with apex conquerors.

“How can this be?” A spectator questioned his own eyes.

“These metal giants are this strong?” Another asked while looking at the remaining statues outside the palace.

“Well, if they were, Imperial Attendant City could have taken down the alliances without any problem, they could even attack Celestial Court.” A big shot commented.

“It’s different. As far as I know, City Lord Zi Yan could only activate the giants, and not all of them either.” An ancestor with a good grasp of history said: “This Li Qiye is doing more than just activating them.”

“You’ve done three thousand strikes, it’s my turn now.” Back to the battle, Li Qiye smiled and said before swinging his armored hand.

His movement resembled that of a brute in a human village. There was nothing to it outside of a simple movement.

However, Suppression Conqueror’s expression changed. He raised his staff with both hands, ready to block a falling sky.

“Bam!” Fiery sparks splattered with the force of a million erupting volcanoes.

Though he managed to stop the blow, his staff clearly bent downward between his hands and almost broke. The impact sent him flying straight into his domain, causing cracks to appear on the barrier.

He vomited blood and turned pale since the strike left actual serious injuries. His internal energies and vitality were still churning.

As for the crowd, they saw Li Qiye’s actions from start to finish. He didn’t seem to have put that much force behind the swing, acting as if he was just playing with a child.

Alas, this was Suppression Conqueror who went all out. This whole thing didn’t make sense - a mighty conqueror being utterly defeated after one move.

“Just imagine all the metal giants in action.” A dragon lord commented.

Everyone coveted the giants now but knew that this was an impossible feat. Otherwise, they would have been taken eras ago.

“Such power, enough to survive a calamity.” Suppression stood up and healed his wounds before responding.

“Still not giving up, I see.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, I am alive so there is still hope.” Suppression remained resolute.

His embarrassed state had nothing to do with weakness. The problem was the gauntlet being illogically strong.

“Not for long if you insist on being stubborn.” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed.

“Everyone dies eventually. I would prefer dying on the battlefield while seeking the dao.” Suppression laughed heartily and said.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

His grand comment made cultivators’ blood boil.

“He’s right.” A few murmured while reflecting on their cultivation goals.

“There’s a reason why he’s a top conqueror.” Another said with admiration.

Resplendent Monarch and the others sighed, unable to say anything negative about Suppression’s unrelenting ambition and direct methods.

“Fine, display your worth so that you can die without regrets.” Li Qiye said.

“Very well, I had created a dao that can borrow force from outer space. You will be a witness today.” Suppression announced.

“Clank!” He folded his staff after saying this and surprised the crowd.

He folded it into eight different sections and turned it into a symmetrical octagonal symbol.

“Bang!” He embedded it into the air and made people wonder about his technique.
