“Clank!” The power of a progenitor empowered the slash, allowing it to destroy the ages and any immortal.

The swords released strands of light. Each seemed to be materializing into physical form, full of murderous intent. These bright rays were fatal, aiming straight for the throat.

This slash would remove any immortal in the world. The sword has finally revealed its true form and terrifying power. This primordial beast has shown its real fangs.

The emperor didn’t exert its true power earlier. He needed to be at this level before being capable of delivering this slash.

The crowd’s expression darkened, petrified by this murderous aura. Some dropped straight to the ground.

“Good.” Li Qiye smiled and casually raised his right hand in retaliation.

“Clank!” Another sword hymn could be heard. It wasn’t as sharp and clear as the one from the Immortal Slaying Sword but rather forceful with a deeper pitch similar to a large bell.

A bronze sword appeared. It was as massive as a mountain, lying horizontally in the sky and crushing the stars above.

Its size actually didn’t matter, only its incalculable weight - surely the heaviest item in existence.

“Whoosh!” It flew out and slashed at the other sword with pure strength. There was no murderous aura nor technique - just an immaculate power that could crush everything. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Because of its unimaginable weight, the moment it took action, the spatial area nearby got crushed and became a terrible void after loud cracking noises.

Perhaps it weighed a thousand times more than Three Immortals. Just imagine the force behind such weight. The most amazing slash wouldn’t amount to much when facing its might.

“Bam!” A contest of a peerless formation versus a heavy sword.

Unfortunately, the formation seemed feeble in comparison like an ant being crushed by a mountain.

Fiery sparks scattered before the Immortal Slaying Sword was blown flying. Even the figure behind the emperor suffered the same fate.

The heavy sword didn’t stop there; its shockwaves still continued forward through everything.

“Boom!” The weight of the strike seemed to be on the back end and has just now reached the front to hit Eight Formation True Emperor.

“Ah!” He bellowed miserably before turning into a mist of blood.

Since the start with his ultimate slash till his death only took the blink of an eye. The spectators didn’t even have the time to breathe before everything ended.

“Boom!” The formation collapsed, leaving behind the three floating swords.

Just a while ago, the emperor had the Immortal Slaying Formation on top of blessings from his kingdom and the power of Nine Secrets. Alas, just a single slash still took him down. The guy didn’t even have the chance to try and run.

The spectators regained their wits and trembled in fear. The king didn’t need to use any invincible art; just this bronze sword alone could make him invincible.

One slash from it could take down a kingdom or lineage. A million miles of land would sink to the core. Hidden powers and resources? Ancestors? True Gods? All to ashes.

The three immortal swords were still floating, unharmed by the contact earlier with the bronze one. They were clearly precious treasures.

“Not bad at all, mine.” Li Qiye smiled and reached for them.

“Clank! Clank!” The swords resisted his suppression since they already had a master, not wanting to submit.

Unfortunately, his great palm didn’t allow for resistance. They were instantly suppressed and fell into his possession.

He did a simple wiping motion and destroyed the seals of the swords along with the markings of Myriad Formation Kingdom.

There was no doubt that their master has changed at this point. The kingdom wouldn’t be able to summon them back.

“Buzz.” Suddenly, the bloody mist lit up. A condensation force took place.

“What’s going on?” A strong expert noticed this.

A shadow of Eight Formation True Emperor appeared in the bloody mist, only around the size of a fist.

“He’s not dead yet since his true fate hasn’t been destroyed.” An ancestor figured it out.

True Emperor was a resilient realm. A True God would have been ashes after being struck by that slash. However, the true fate of this emperor was still intact. He only needed time and certain conditions to create a new body and live again.

“Unfortunately, you are doomed.” Li Qiye chuckled after seeing this.

“Clank!” He casually used his new swords. They all swung down in unison.

“No!” The image of the emperor shouted and finally felt fear. He wanted to escape at this last second.

“Pluff!” It was already too late. His true fate was instantly cut by the three swords. It became extinguished and dispersed into light particles.

The crowd watched the slowly dispersing radiance while trembling inside. This signaled the death of the emperor. He no longer existed in this world; the end of a great genius.

Everyone became emotional and speechless, albeit with different feelings.

Not just in Nine Secrets but in all of Imperial, Eight Formation True Emperor was a brilliant prodigy. Becoming an emperor at such a young age meant that he had limitless potential.

Some considered him to be number one in Nine Secrets. They viewed him as their role model as they strived to become better and famous, perhaps reaching the imperial realm just like him.

Alas, they watched his death today after suffering an utter defeat to the hand of the king, someone they have looked down upon. This reversal was such irony to the emperor’s fans.

The older experts didn’t feel the same way. They felt a chill because the king was untouchable now. The fate of Nine Secrets has been determined. Everyone needed to obey him in the future.

They also knew that nothing good would come from opposing the king. It was suicidal on top of bringing potential sect-destruction. His reign of terror would far exceed Lucidity King’s.

Bingchi Hanyu gently sighed after seeing this. She had tried her best to convince the emperor otherwise. He was the one who chose this path.
