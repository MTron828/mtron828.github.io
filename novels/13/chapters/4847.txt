Chapter 4848: Dao Lord’s Death

“Your Majesty!” The two women who had left earlier appeared on the battlefield. They channeled merit laws into their weapon, wanting to help him block the slash.

They were supreme geniuses, the top of this generation. Alas, this meant nothing for they were facing Conceal Conqueror.

“Ahh!” The impressive barrier couldn’t stop the murderous slash for a single second.

Sword energies pierced and killed them in the blink of an eye. This happened too quickly for most cultivators.

“Silly girls…” The corner of his eyes became slightly moist. He didn’t have the strength to save himself, let alone them.

“Conceal, if you wish to know the secret, I will tell you, come closer.” He shouted.

Conceal approached after hearing this but his six dao fruits flew out of the fate palaces.

They twisted and fused together into a single one. Time and space came to a halt from this seal.

“!!!” Conceal became cautious and activated her dao fruits as well. Seven supreme grand dao activated and turned into the strongest defense.

“Boom!” Eight-stallion’s single dao fruit exploded and destroyed the entire battlefield.

All the laws holding this place together were reduced to ashes. This explosion was beyond its containment.

“Ahh!” Spectators became unfortunate victims. The majority was reduced to blood. Only the mighty sovereigns managed to flee, albeit with grievous injuries.

Chaos shook violently; its inhabitants were scared out of their mind. The shockwaves destroyed peaks and caused tsunamis in the lakes and rivers.

The great dao lineages such as Demon and Primal in Chaos became threatened. This applied to Deity, Heavenburial, and Lunar outside of the continent as well.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Eight-stallion has fallen.” Big shots from these lineages stood up in astonishment, realizing the result.

Of course, the main target of the explosion was still Conceal Conqueror. She alone faced the brunt of the explosion.

Her barrier had cracks everywhere as she was being pushed back. Nonetheless, due to her superior cultivation, she managed to stop the attack.

“Ugh…” She vomited blood and staggered backward.

“Whoosh!” A white ray flew out of the smoke and headed straight for her. It contained a power gestated from the start of time - enough to horrify her.

Her weakened barrier couldn’t stop it from piercing through, only managing to lessen the intensity.

“Pluff!” It pierced through her body, leaving a gaping hole.

She didn’t bother to find out who the assailant was and used her remaining strength to run away.

After a long while, the lucky survivors calmed down and gazed at the aftermath. Skybreak Cliff was no more.

The area outside suffered untold damage as well. This looked like the end of the world.

Both the combatants were nowhere to be seen, signaling the end of the battle.

“This is it, Chaos will fall into unrest again.” A peerless cultivator murmured.

Li Qiye lay on top of a hill, enjoying the breezes.

“Bam!” A shooting star landed on it and left behind a deep pit.

“Sigh, bothered again.” Li Qiye complained and then got up.

He came over and saw Eight-stallion Dao Lord in the pit, gasping for breath.

“Can’t survive.” He shook his head after seeing the injuries.

“Right.” Eight-stallion laughed and climbed out of the pit. He vomited blood before asking: “Who are you?”

“Just a passerby.” Li Qiye gave the usual answer.

The dao lord used his remaining strength to take a closer look and started laughing: “Hahaha, I’ve seen you before… through my son’s ultimate strike.”

“I see. It’s a shame that he is no longer around.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hahaha, it was a beautiful death.” Eight-stallion said: “I want to have a drink with you but unfortunately, I won’t have the chance.”

“Yes, you don’t have much time left. The dao fruits have been destroyed, not even an immortal can save you.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Are you interested?” Eight-stallion’s eyes flashed brightly after coming up with an idea.

“In what?” Li Qiye asked.

“I have a certain item that can trace up a particular bloodline pertaining to a certain someone.” He said excitedly.

“I heard of it and have been searching.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Hahaha, perfect, then I’ll give it to you!” Eight-stallion opened his mind and a blood ray shot out. It looked like a drop of blood as it drilled into Li Qiye’s forehead.

“So this is it.” Li Qiye took a look inside his mind.

“M-my life is over now.” Eight-stallion said: “Go to my Eight-stallion Dynasty if you have time, it is an interesting place worthy of your time.”

With that, he took off the imperial seal that was hanging on his neck like a pendant.
