Chapter 5069: Becoming A Tree

“Buzz.” She turned into a morning glory tree, becoming larger and larger. Her branches and leaves took over the entire basin in no time at all.

After taking up all the space possible, she started ascending vertically. This required immense cultivation as the fuel and fortunately, she had enough as a five-fruit dragon lord.

“Rumble!” Her transformation also re-shaped the continent. Peaks with gurgling streams ascended along her side. The water coursed to the bottom and started forming rivers and even oceans.

Ming Shi and Li Qiye witnessed a green continent in no time at all - verdant leaves and shimmering currents.

“She’s so strong.” Ming Shi praised her fellow sect member for this miraculous feat.

“Boom!” A divine light illuminated the continent and created the image of a great tree. Stars circled around its leaves as it gave birth to three thousand worlds.

“So this is a reflection of the divine tree?” Ming Shi murmured. She felt as if this tree could create the six continents without facing any issues.

Alas, the divine light didn’t last long and disappeared after a few seconds. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I’m afraid I can’t return to Untethered. Ming Shi, do you mind letting the ancestors know?” Tendril King’s voice could be heard.

“I will deliver the message, Senior Aunt.” Ming Shi bowed.

With that, the group was down to two. As they were leaving, Ming Shi kept on looking back at the green continent. She hoped to see her senior aunt again but alas, after a full fusion process, her senior aunt might become a god here and wouldn’t be able to leave.

“Where are we going now, Young Noble?” She asked Li Qiye.

“The ancestral nest, the origin of it all.” Li Qiye told her.

They crossed through more celestial domains and saw unprecedented miracles, at least for Ming Shi.

One of them was a colossal statue. Its broken state didn’t diminish its grandeur. Another location of note was a pond with tribulation lighting; a golden eagle was flying inside.

A frightening tsunami of lightning ravaged the pond in an unceasing manner. Nothing could survive in there with the exception of this eagle.

Chillglare Hawk’s screech was devastating but it was nothing compared to this golden eagle. It was the roar of a tiger versus an infant crying.

This eagle could devour thousands of dragon lords in the blink of an eye. In fact, it could contrast against true dragons and phoenixes as well.

Its feathers were damaged by the lightning bolts and stained with blood. Nonetheless, it still kept on training in the pond until it noticed something.

“I apologize for the lack of reception, esteemed guests.” It finally took a break.

“It’s fine, keep going.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Using tribulation lighting to polish your true blood is the best course of action, perhaps you will be able to obtain a divine bloodline.”

“Right you are, Sir.” The eagle went to a fierce lightning domain while speaking: “I’m afraid I can’t entertain you right now.”

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye was only passing by and didn’t feel like talking with the eagle.

“Boom!” A terrifying arc struck the eagle, causing it to focus again.

“Excuse me then!” It rushed into the air and faced the lightning arc directly, still capable of withstanding the destructive affinity.

“Is this the founder of Feather?” Ming Shi recalled the seal of Peacock Monarch - a golden eagle.

“That’s right.” Li Qiye nodded.

“These founder gods are so strange. God Ape Dao Lord just wants to be a monkey, Immortal Emperor Jin She wants to be a shepherd, and this golden eagle is a masochist.” Ming Shi murmured.

“It’s because of their varied background, so their pursuit and dao are also different.” Li Qiye said.

“We’ve seen Serpent, Tiger, Feather, and Bug so far. Wood’s Demon Conqueror is probably at the immortal continent, what about Mist? Will we see that founder too?” She asked.

“This god probably can’t stay in the divine nest and is long gone just like Demon Conqueror.” Li Qiye had an answer.

“What a shame, I want to see all of them.” Ming Shi sighed.
