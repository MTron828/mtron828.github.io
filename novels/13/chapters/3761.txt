Chapter 3762: Righteous Scion

Righteous Scion was imbued with a spirit that can conquer mountains and rivers then soar above Eight Desolaces. He looked like the greatest in existence, virtually unbeatable.

His aura surpassed all the geniuses in the holy ground and he had no intention of hiding it.

The grand dao resonated along his path. Laws poured down like waterfalls along with bright halos. The surroundings were affected by his mighty presence. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In fact, the birds and beasts within one hundred thousand miles trembled in fear, wanting to run away.

This was the case for human cultivators as well. Powerful countries and sects all felt the pressure.

The ancestors could withstand his aura and were unaffected. As for the young ones, their mind wavered under the suffocation and got the urge to prostrate.

This rampant proliferation of aura was a blatant challenge, showing utter disdain to the geniuses of the holy ground.

They were naturally furious but after experiencing this aura, they could only keep it to themselves. They waited for their top geniuses to make a move instead, hoping to repel him.

“Righteous Scion has inherited Righteous Supreme’s legacy, his achievements will just be as illustrious.” One ancestor emotionally commented.

This has confirmed his power. He didn’t need an army to deter his opponents. He alone was more intimidating than a million men.

“He’s past the border now.” His location was the focus of the holy ground. Everyone knew where he was right away due to the flow of information.

“That’s the Vigorous Tiger Legion’s territory. Will they fight?” One youth said. [1]

“Vajra’s Hu Ben is in charge there. The dynasty won’t sit idly by during this event, they can’t.” The young lord of a sect added.

All eyes were on the legion by the border now. This area had pivotal importance to the holy ground.

In history, Righteous and Buddha had numerous skirmishes. The legions here had to repel various invasions.

Now,, the scion wasn’t declaring war and merely challenged the geniuses of the holy ground. Nonetheless, not answering this challenge was rather shameful.

The current commander was Hu Ben of Vajra. Though he had entered War Camp later, he still maintained his position at the legion.

If the dynasty didn’t do anything about the scion, their authority would be questioned. Thus, the legion sent out scouts in order to meticulously watch the scion’s movement. They had to do something in order to avoid criticisms from the great powers in the holy ground.

“I alone will fight the heroes of this land, even the great armies of Buddha Holy Ground.” The scion took note of this and heartily laughed while moving forward.

“He’s challenging Vigorous Tiger and Vajra now.” Everyone heard him clearly, realizing that Vajra absolutely needed to do something right now. Otherwise, it would be too humiliating and disgraceful.

“Righteous Scion, we will answer your challenge.” A voice from the legion responded.

One figure emerged above the camp of Vigorous Tiger. He had a golden glow due to his armor, looking quite divine and battle-ready.

“Hu Ben of Vajra!” A spectator shouted.

“This is how it should be.” Many nodded approvingly while the youths heaved a sigh of relief.

Hu Ben had a great background in Vajra Dynasty. He originated from Martial Hall and was a general in War Camp on top of being the commander of Vigorous Tiger. Most importantly, he was one of the four great geniuses of the holy ground.

Thus, whether it be for personal or duty reasons, he should be the one accepting the challenge. He represented the legion in charge of the border and Vajra Dynasty’s prestige.

“I have heard about your talent and military aptitude long ago, Fellow Daoist. Today is a great opportunity to witness it in person.” Righteous Scion’s majestic and awe-inspiring voice sounded.

“Smoke-fire Fortress, I and my army will fight you there.” Hu Ben didn’t relent at all against his foe’s oppressive aura.

“So be it.” The scion didn’t waste words.

“That’s the youngest grand commander for you.” The youths of the holy ground suddenly became excited and started praising Hu Ben.

“He’s the pride of our land, not letting Vajra down at all.” Someone else said.

“The commander protects the border, truly a noble cause.” A youth with shallow cultivation was a fan.

Hu Ben’s initiative earned him numerous praises from the populace.

The news of their match quickly spread across the holy ground.

“Hu Ben will lead 100,000 men to fight the scion at Smoke-fire Fortress.” Everyone heard about it with haste.

“Let’s go already!” Most started running towards this area.

“We’re not strong enough to fight Righteous Scion but we can at least support Hu Ben. We can’t let Righteous Sect look down on us.” One youth said.

It didn’t take long before the mass ran towards the border, the majority being from the young generation.

“Will Hu Ben be able to stop the scion?” Some were worried because they knew how strong the scion was. He was actually superior to the four great geniuses so they didn’t have that much confidence in Hu Ben.

“Hu Ben alone is no match for the scion but don’t forget, Vigorous Tiger is a powerful legion. Hu Ben led it to numerous victories before.” Someone familiar with Hu Ben’s past exploits was relatively confident.

“Hu Ben is a gifted commander but the difference in power is too great. An army won’t do anything in a real fight between masters. It’s absolutely inconsequential.” A powerful genius disagreed.

“Regardless of the outcome, he’s worthy of admiration just by stepping up to represent Vajra Dynasty and the holy ground.” One young fan asserted.
