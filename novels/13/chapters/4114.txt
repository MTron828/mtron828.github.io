Chapter 4115: Being Rich Is Terrific

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Ahh!” Dark Dragon Monarch suffered the same fate as his spear. The two halves fell into the lake, adding a red hue to it.

The mighty cultivator couldn’t stop a single slash. Of course, it should be noted that he was amidst running away and had little time to react. Nonetheless, it wouldn’t be easy to duplicate this feat.

This showed that the man’s cultivation far exceeded both Dark Dragon and Crimsondeath Monarch.

Others took a deep breath after witnessing the murder. Such ability was rare in Sword Continent; he should be someone famous.

“Who is he?” Many experts murmured.

Some carefully observed Tie Jian but didn’t recognize him or his background.

“A master like this shouldn’t be unknown.” Another said. He should be a big shot ruling an entire region. Alas, no one from their memory matched this sword user.

“He seems so familiar as if I’ve met him before.” One ancestor said. Some of his peers also felt the same way but they couldn’t recall.

“He has to be from a big sect.” Another important figure mused.

Tie Jian didn’t reveal any merit law and sword technique. However, people thought that his style and temperament matched someone from a powerful sect.

“Having money is so nice, he gets to hire so many experts.” Someone expressed their jealousy and envy.

Most in the crowd still felt deep contempt towards Li Qiye since he had no redeemable characteristics outside of being rich. Alas, this rich guy had a force rivaling any great power under his control. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

This was a case of a nobody suddenly turning into a supreme existence. Nonetheless, the stench of a nouveau-riche and dirty money remained with him. He had no elegance and grace like others from the large sects.

“It’s over for Dark Dragon Island. There will only be seventeen now.” A spectator murmured after seeing the bandits completely wiped out after the death of Dark Dragon Monarch.

“Why didn’t the other islands come to help? Aren’t they on the same side?” Another found this rather strange.

Others exchanged glances after hearing this. There were no signs of other islands coming to help ever since the siege.

“Is it because Dark Dragon Monarch couldn’t call for reinforcement on time? The island went down too fast.” Someone else said.

“No, Cloud Dream Lake might not be that united. They’ll band together when there are enough benefits but normally, they operate independently unless there’s a command from Dark Gale.” An old expert understood the region.

“Don’t forget, the people are dead but the island is still there. Li Qiye’s group won’t stay here forever. Once they leave, the other islands can divide Dark Dragon Island.” A clan elder said.

Most agreed with this. The other bandits probably didn’t mind seeing Dark Dragon Island go down, there would be more room for them in the future.

“Rumble!” Crimsondeath Monarch and his men found the treasury of the island and started excavating it.

Spectators’ eyes lit up after seeing this.

“Dark Dragon Island has been operating for several thousand years, I’m sure they have many treasures and metals.” One of them said.

“No wonder why Li Qiye pursued the matter.” An old cultivator commented.

“Young Noble, we have found Dark Dragon Island’s treasury.” Someone reported to Li Qiye.

Li Qiye glanced at it and nonchalantly said: “Open it.”

“Rumble!” Crimsondeath and the others used all their might and successfully opened it.

“Buzz.” Bright rays rushed out of the treasury. It certainly had some good stuff - refined jades and metals neatly arranged. Colorful lights impressed the spectators.

This was not a supreme treasury or anything but it had plenty of resources - a monstrous sum to a regular cultivator.

“Allocate them in accordance to contribution.” Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at the treasury again. The content was no different than scrap metals to him.

“Thank you, Young Noble!” The members of the legion bowed towards him, looking quite excited for the handsome rewards.

Normally, after a successful take-down of an enemy sect, the spoils would go to the treasury. Only a minor portion was allocated to the contributors.

In this case, Li Qiye gave everything to them. Such generosity was well-appreciated; the morale of his followers improved.

“Sigh, I should have accepted the invitation.” One expert regretted.

During his previous recruitment, many worried about damaging their status and reputation so they didn’t join him.

In retrospect, this seemed to be the wrong decision. The salary was good on top of extra rewards - probably more money than they would get after a lifetime of toiling for their sect.

“I wonder if he’s still recruiting.” An expert quietly asked around.

As the saying goes - no one can resist the temptation of money. Those who looked down on Li Qiye previously still wanted to join him after seeing the potential rewards.

Even elders from larger sects thought about accepting the invitation at this point.

“Let’s go to our destination.” Li Qiye didn’t care for this insignificant child’s play and gave the order.

“Men, to Tortoise Monarch Island!” Xu Yiyun passed down the command.

The legion and his personal entourage started moving again. This time around, the girls were even louder since they were in a great mood.

“A man can enjoy the same treatment as a king as long as he has enough money.” One expert said bitterly.
