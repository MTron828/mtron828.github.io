Chapter 5675: Reborn?

Celestial Court’s declaration of war didn’t frighten Demon Conqueror who seemed to be a worthy leader of Imperial Field.

“There is no saving The People.” Immortal Emperor Hao Hai’s declaration instilled fear into listeners: “Immortal Dao City had abandoned them, one hand cannot clap. There will not be a repeat of Grand Dao War, only a massacre if you dare to resist.”

“The corpses of your emperors will laden our field if you dare come.” Demon spoke with conviction, raising everyone’s morale.

Imperial Field had never yielded in the past and would not do so in the present or the future.

“I see.” Hao Hai nodded and said: “Very well, I have said my piece, we will see how determined you are soon.”

“We will not show mercy.” Demon maintained her stance.

“Consider this a declaration of war. Prepare well.” Hao Hai said calmly then left.

No one tried to stop him because they couldn’t. He was at the apex level long ago and now, he had a paragon artifact as well.

“Drums.” Demon ordered afterward.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The sound of drums echoed across the field and could be heard by everyone.

“War is starting.” Both cultivators and mortals understood the situation.

“Celestial Court is coming.” The latter became afraid and hurriedly sought refuge.

This was a war between emperors. Weaker cultivators had no reason to interfere and they didn’t wish to either. The wise choice was to get as far away as possible. Otherwise, just any remnant blast could turn a kingdom into ashes.

The strongest cultivators of Imperial Field left their isolated cultivation and gathered at Thousand Emperor Island.

“So much blood will spill.” A few emperors and monarchs lacked confidence.

Immortal Dao City no longer answered and High Heaven Aegis had disappeared. The responsibility of protecting Imperial Field rested on their shoulders. Unfortunately, this burden was hefty for them.

“Boom!” Li Qiye crossed through High Heaven Aegis and landed at its farthest region, creating a pit with his flashy descent.

This was a self-contained world of silence with desolate mountains and cold soil. Looking up revealed ancient stars. Being here made one feel as if they had returned to the distant ages.

A golden light pulsed in all directions, guarding this silent land. Upon closer inspection, the source turned out to be a gigantic headless skeleton.

The bones looked just like gold. The golden light turned out to be tiny golden laws twisted together, forming something akin to a prison. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Each strand was no different than a supreme chain, representing an unbreakable will and dao. They were primal, seemingly the first branch of any dao in existence. The bones also contained incredible divinity, unfazed by the withering of time.

Li Qiye came closer and smiled, knocking on the bones.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The dao sounds erupted like a storm, capable of crushing anything nearby.

Since this skeleton took up virtually the entire region, the dao activation caused darkness to seep out of the soil with an untouchable force.

It could flip the entire immortal continent and surge to the sky - fighting whatever was up there.

However, a dao source and an inborn trinity were activated. Divine rings coiled around the skeleton and suppressed the darkness.

“Hmph!” The darkness seemed to fear the golden divinity and the inborn trinity. Its scowl alone could obliterate a world.

“How pitiful, needing to seal yourself.” Li Qiye smiled and sat down.

The darkness returned to the earth, leaving behind a strand resembling a black dragon flying around the skeleton.

“Junior, save your snark.” The dragon spoke with an ancient and oppressive voice: “You weren’t alive when I started this world.”

“What’s this? Getting all high and mighty because of seniority?” Li Qiye smiled: “Living for a long time doesn’t mean anything. At my young age, I’ve already battled the high heaven and slaughtered pseudo-immortals. Trinity, you are not special, you believe yourself to be a contender while in reality, you’re just a dog without a master.”

“You!” The dark entity roared furiously, seemingly ready to erupt again.

However, it calmed down in the next second.

“The succeeding waves of the great river push out the preceding waves.” It said, seemingly having sat down.

“Push? No, we crushed you all. Look at you now, and I didn’t even need to do anything.” Li Qiye laughed.

“Hahaha, the outcome is yet to be determined.” The voice laughed.

“Still confident in yourself or your brothers? I don’t think they view you as a brother though, just targets you’re trying to win over at best.”

“I can be reborn as long as I am willing.” The voice sneered.

“Reborn? By reshaping this body? An inborn dao chaos physique is incredible indeed, one of a kind in all of Trinity Epoch. It’ll be unbreakable once reshaped.” Li Qiye tapped the golden skeleton and said.
