Chapter 4864: Strange Cemetery

“Rumble!” The entire dynasty suddenly trembled once Firerage witnessed the fusion.

“What’s happening?!” Everyone thought that enemies were invading so they took out their weapons.

A colossal bull seemed to be turning, causing changes to the terrain. Firerage became startled and suddenly saw a light coming from the cliff. Li Qiye’s hand suddenly pierced through the outer wall. Once he pulled back, he was pinching a group of particles. 

They were ancient, seemingly having flown in the river of time for a long period. They could explain the mysteries of cultivation or contain untold secrets.

“Command men to go fetch this from the mountain bases in the dynasty. They will need this.” Li Qiye handed the particles over to Firerage.

“I’m afraid we can’t mobilize properly right now.” Firerage quietly said.

Li Qiye was yet to be the king so he didn’t have the authority to command the army. The soldiers wouldn’t listen to him.

“Let the imperial guard do it.” Li Qiye said.

“Well…” Firerage hesitated: “Your Highness, protecting you is more important than anything. Can this matter wait?”

He didn’t know what Li Qiye wanted to do. However, those changes earlier frightened him. Even a fool could tell that something extraordinary was taking place.

“What is there to protect me from in the dynasty?” Li Qiye chuckled: “Can you stop Venerable Dragon God?”

“...” Firerage couldn’t answer because the result would be too humiliating to say.

“Let the knights go since they are reliable and trustworthy.” Li Qiye ordered again.

Firerage accepted the particles and gave out the order.

Li Qiye turned to leave but Firerage gave chase and asked: “Your Highness, what was that earlier?”

He knew that the rumbling had to do with Li Qiye harmonizing with Eight-stallion Peak. His Majesty was never able to do this before but Li Qiye did it so effortlessly.

“A legacy, old and magical beyond words.” Li Qiye said.

Immortal Gate was once stronger than the Qian but most importantly, secrets greater than Authority Heavenly Emperor’s existence loomed behind the curtains. Not to mention the present, few back in the Thirteen Worlds were privy to this information.

All of this was purposely hidden by Purewood Divine Emperor after its destruction to the Ancient Ming.

“So this mountain is the foundation?” Firerage asked.

“Yes, this thing has been missing for a long time. Now, I have found it.” Li Qiye nodded.

“His Majesty pulled it back from space long ago.” Firerage said.

“This is the reason why he chose to stay in the lower continents. He knows about the underlying secrets.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see…” Firerage pondered. His Majesty could have gone to the upper realms long ago due to his powerful cultivation. Now, he finally got an answer.

How did a stranger know so much about the dao lord? Was Li Qiye really just a stranger?

“Where is he buried?” Li Qiye asked casually.

Firerage found this strange. Li Qiye’s tone should be more respectful regardless of whether he was the dao lord’s descendant or just a stranger. This was a rather sensitive question in the cultivation world.

“I do not know.” Firerage told the truth: “His Majesty had arranged this before leaving for battle.”

“True, it is taboo indeed.” Li Qiye smiled.

Eight-stallion’s choice was not surprising. Top cultivators normally had secret funeral arrangements if they were fortunate enough to die with their corpses intact. Not even their closest family and friends were privy to this knowledge.

While the two of them strolled in a remote plain, Li Qiye suddenly stopped.

There was a large garden surrounded by rusted steel poles propping up a canopy and forming a fence. Inside were memorial tablets, making it look like an abandoned cemetery.

His expression changed as he try to feel the beat of the garden.

“Who is buried here?” He asked.

“It was already abandoned when His Majesty came. He didn’t have a problem with keeping it around.”

“Let’s go take a look.” Li Qiye said.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Firerage obeyed the command despite not knowing why Li Qiye was interested.

The entrance was a dilapidated arched gate with engravings of lively birds and fish that couldn’t be recognized.

“Hmm, some discrepancies.” Li Qiye murmured.

“Uncle Xiang, open up.” Firerage shouted.

The stained dual doors could be easily pushed down. The iron lock was just there for show.

An old man from a cabin nearby came over. He wore a thin black robe and walked feebly over, seemingly coughing once every two steps. Just a gust of wind could sweep him off his feet.

“Guard Commander, what is it?” He opened the lock and asked.

“His Highness wants to take a look.” Firerage said.

Li Qiye glanced at the old man who kept his head lowered.

“What are you waiting for?” Firerage coughed.

“Old Xiang greets you, Your Highness.” The old man bowed.

“Many strange things here, and strange people.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Your Highness, Uncle Xiang is this cemetery’s keeper. He has always been here.” Firerage said. He could see that there was something off about this old man but since Eight-stallion Dao Lord didn’t say anything, it was none of his business either.

“You’ve been watching this place?” Li Qiye entered the cemetery and then asked.

“No.” Old Xiang coughed and shook his head: “But this is my clan’s profession. Once I became old and weak, I came here to find a peaceful place before the end.”

“Whose graves are these?” Li Qiye asked.

“I don’t know.” Old Xiang shook his head, still not looking at Li Qiye. He then returned to his cabin and didn’t follow the two.

They looked around and saw graves overwhelmed with weed. Most importantly, they were all unmarked.
