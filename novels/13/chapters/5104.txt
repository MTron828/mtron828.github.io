Chapter 5105: A Trap

“What do you want?” Li Qiye smiled and said.

Qing Songke stared at Li Qiye for a while and didn’t say anything. The guy was his father’s killer. As the saying goes - patricide, vengeance, not even the heavens can reconcile.

Did he hate Li Qiye? His hatred was profound but in reality, how many people had his father slain in the past? Now, since his father was dead so the victims’ family members were targeting him instead.

He had the responsibility to avenge his father. Otherwise, he would be unworthy as a son. His intent didn’t matter; the act must be carried out.

Of course, he also knew that this was a one-sided affair. The mere thought of carrying it out only served to console his state of mind for success was an impossibility.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He was not qualified to become a real threat. This was a man who killed conquerors and dragon lords like they were nothing.

In fact, just meeting Li Qiye now was a great honor. Top masters didn’t have this privilege but Li Qiye chose to grant him an audience.

This complicated situation made him feel helpless and trapped in despair. As Li Qiye had stated in the past, he was not eligible to stand in the long line of those who want to kill Li Qiye.

The disparity was immense and he knew his own limits. He could try his entire life only to amount to nothing. He also knew that Li Qiye was merciful for not killing him, let alone saving him twice.

Others would kill everyone to get rid of a potential problem in the future. Li Qiye didn’t need to do it himself; plenty of people would dirty their hands for him.

Being saved by the enemy was torture and all of this made him speechless.

“At least say something, don’t just stand there.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“You shouldn’t go to Mountain of the Ages.” He eventually said.

“Oh? What makes you say that?” Li Qiye asked.

“It is a trap.” He said with hesitation.

“Go on.” Li Qiye said.

Qing Songke didn’t expect this response because he had thought about the various scenarios before. 

He came to warn Li Qiye but thought that the guy might laugh or mock him. All in all, his expectations were mostly negative. In this case, Li Qiye actually became interested, seemingly believing him.

Remember, he was currently the lord of Reincarnation; the conquerors were on his side. Coming here to give Li Qiye information was nothing short of traitorous. Others might actually consider this a ruse.

“I don’t know the details, just that it is certainly a trap.” He responded.

“I appreciate your kind intentions.” Li Qiye nodded in response.

Qing Songke heaved a sigh of relief when Li Qiye accepted the gesture. Since Li Qiye had saved him twice, this was considered paying off the debt. With that, he would have less problem avenging his father.

“A trap it may be but I am a man of my word and must go.” Li Qiye smiled and added.

“Very well, take care.” Qing Songke didn’t try to convince Li Qiye. He turned and left since why would an ant need to worry about a dragon?

As he was walking away, Li Qiye’s voice came from behind: “Do you wish to avenge your father?”

Qing Songke froze. This scenario sounded as if Li Qiye would not let him leave this place alive. However, he thought that he was overthinking it. It was clear that Li Qiye had no intention of killing him.

He turned around and faced Li Qiye: “It is the son’s responsibility to avenge his father.”

“Rather courageous.” Li Qiye chuckled.

At this point, some ancient ancestors would tremble before Li Qiye, let alone utter these fighting words.

“Do you want to kill me?” Li Qiye asked.

“Of course, it is my mission.” He took a deep breath and said.

“Even if you cultivate your whole life and become a conqueror, you still won’t be able to kill me.” Li Qiye said: “I’m not telling you to give up on avenging your father, but obsessing with vengeance is no way to live. It doesn’t matter how strong you become, you will be swallowed up by the only thing on your mind. How pitiful.”

“That’s my business.” Qing Songke paused for a moment before coldly uttering.

“Fine.” Li Qiye responded: “If you want revenge, then check a scroll known as Chronicle of the Ages left behind by your ancestor, Blazing Conqueror. Others might view it as a shallow mantra that can be trained by anyone but it will be very useful to you.”

Qing Songke couldn’t believe it. His enemy was clearly giving him a hint on how to improve.

“Go.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Qing Songke regained his wits and bowed once before leaving.
