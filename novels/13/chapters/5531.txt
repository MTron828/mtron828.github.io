Chapter 5532: What Are You Afraid Of?

“I can’t help being amazed by your confidence, Mister Li.” The old beggar shuddered and said.

“Do you think you are superior to the primordial geezers?” Li Qiye answered with a smile.

The old beggar stared at him for a while before responding: “If I remember correctly, you only have one beam of primordial light.”

“Yes, only one.” Li Qiye smiled: “But think about this, if I had managed to obtain such a thing, what else couldn’t I do?”

“That’s a bold statement.” The old beggar said.

“Not at all, I seek perfection but can accept some flaws if necessary. I don’t think all of you have the same luxury.” Li Qiye said.

“Mister Li, there are more than just a few over there. A certain person had arrived.” The old beggar said.

“Yes, that person, so close to the high heaven.” Li Qiye wasn’t surprised.

The old beggar remained silent.

“You know he had lived far longer than me and any of you. In fact, not counting the dead geezers, how many are older than him up there?” Li Qiye asked.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“No one, only the heaven itself.” The old man contemplated for a bit before responding.

“Yes, infinitely close to possessing everlasting life.” Li Qiye commented.

“Just like the villainous heaven.” The old beggar said.

“Now here’s the question, why had he never made a move?” Li Qiye asked: “And, who do you think is stronger between him and me? What do Mister Zhao and the others think?”

“He is.” The old beggar didn’t need to think.

“Yes, that’s the consensus.” Li Qiye nodded.

“You disagree?” The old beggar asked.

“The truth is that you all fail to grasp the key principle behind this. It’s not about eternal life or who is stronger.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What is it about then?” The old beggar’s gaze sharpened.

“It’s about the pursuit.” Li Qiye said.

“The pursuit?” The old beggar murmured.

“You all are well aware of your pursuit and how similar it is.” Li Qiye said.

“What do I want then?” The old beggar asked.

“Either eternal life or becoming the replacement.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Because of this, within your heart looms a primal fear. All of you try to erase it through strength and cultivation.” Li Qiye said.

“Do you not have fear, Mister Li?” The old beggar asked.

“Of course I do, all living beings have fear, no exception.” Li Qiye admitted.

“What do you fear?” The old beggar expected no response.

However, Li Qiye actually answered: “Myself.”

“Yourself?” The old beggar was surprised.

“A me who fails to maintain my dao heart.” Li Qiye elaborated while looking up at the sky: “As long as I want to be myself, I will have no fear. Otherwise, it shall consume me.”

“I see, the way you avoid fear is by continuing to perfect yourself and maintain your path.” The old beggar said.

“On the contrary, immortality or replacement are solutions to overcome the fear of death in your heart. As long as this is your pursuit, the fear will always be there for they are one and the same. Thus, you all consume others, your own epochs, and other worlds. You view everything as insignificant and not worth saving, they have let you down so you consumed them as revenge. In the end, all of you are rather pitiful.” Li Qiye concluded.

“And you, Mister Li?” The old beggar stared at him.

“I am the same, pitiful because I have no choice but to walk this path and pitiful if I ever become your kind.” Li Qiye said: “Nonetheless, I prefer to stay unique for as long as possible.”

“How broad-minded of you.” The old beggar remarked.

“It’s not that. The dao beneath our feet supports us so that we can move forward. Alas, the only thing in your group’s eyes now is immortality.” Li Qiye said.

“Would you refuse immortality if it is before you?” The old beggar asked.

“It would be a lie to say that I don’t want it, but only if it requires me bending down and picking it up. You all searched for it tirelessly, only to lose your dao heart in the process.” Li Qiye said.

The old man didn’t respond.

“Do you think the villainous heaven sought out immortality?” Li Qiye continued.

“He is immortal already.” The old beggar said.

“That’s a shallow understanding. He doesn’t know what life and death are, so he does not care for immortality.” Li Qiye said.

“Please elaborate.” The old beggar asked.

“Since you all are blinded by this pursuit, what did some of you even see after fighting the villainous heaven?” Li Qiye asked.

“You’re saying that you had seen it clearly?” The old beggar said.

“Not clearly, but yes. What do you think the villainous heaven is?” Li Qiye asked.

The old beggar took his time finding the right words: “Born from the primordial.”

“Everyone seeks immortality yet it does not know of life and death.” Li Qiye didn’t continue the topic on the villainous heaven.

The old beggar ruminated before asking: “Mister Li, you surely know more about him.”

“Just a general idea. Go on.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Please don’t be offended when I say this, but the prime candidate to reach immortality or replacement is none other than him. I’m afraid you’re not at the top.” The old beggar said.

“I’m not offended.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “He and all of you are not qualified for either path. There is only one outcome for your lot, destruction. That is, if you don’t change your way.”

“How can you be so sure?” The old beggar asked.

“How long have you all been scheming? Have you succeeded? No, and what have you become? You lost your own epoch. You believe that you are in control of your destiny yet what life are you leading right now? Merely existing while having thrown everything else away. For what?” Li Qiye criticized.
