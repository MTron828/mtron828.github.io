No one knew what was at the bottom of the abyss or if one could climb out of it after entering.

Li Qiye still jumped in without any hesitation. His body rapidly descended and disappeared from sight, seemingly swallowed by the abyss.

After a long while, he finally appeared again, climbing out of the abyss. He sat down next to the cliff with a calm expression, albeit with a slight frown: “How strange.”

In actuality, he didn’t find anything under there. No danger or anything special.

“What is it?” He pinched some soil off the top and then scattered them through the gaps between his fingers. The remnant aura here eluded him.

Very few things in this world could actually escape his analysis. This was one of them.

In history and all the epochs, this type of power didn’t exist. Putting aside its actual strength, it was perfectly unique.

Another similar power with the same uniqueness belonged to the villainous heaven. Today, there was another type. This made Li Qiye ponder.

“I’m sure you have the answer.” His eyes pierced across the myriad worlds to reach the deep azure.

Of course, there was no response. This was to be expected. The opposite would make the whole thing more bizarre.

Li Qiye clapped his hands then stared at the abyss with a sigh: “How unbelievable.”

This news would cause an earthquake in the previous epoch. All inhabitants would shudder in fear from this unbelievable event. Li Qiye himself had a hard time imagining what happened.

He has been here plenty of times before, possessing a far better understanding than others.

“Drystone Courtyard is no more.” Li Qiye said sentimentally then left.

In reality, the twelve burial grounds were gone in the new epoch anyway.

Li Qiye crossed through numerous dimensions to reach the source of the ancestral vein. It didn’t use to be this easy getting through the place but everything had changed with time.

A lake of incredible essences existed in this place - the embodiment of worldly fortunes. Alas, it was withered right now, just a hollowed depression.

Nonetheless, there were still runic lines around it. This has been the case for millions and millions of years. The destruction of the eras didn’t matter; epoch might have turned to ashes without affecting these runes.

However, this was only in outward appearance. Those who have been here before would find that they were different after using their heavenly gaze.

The runes have lost their divinity or to be more specific, they no longer had life.

This was akin to a metamorphosis. The living entities in the runes have left, leaving behind the shells on the ground.

“Breaking out to be an immortal or to fight against the immortals?” Li Qiye started thinking about certain things worthy of remembrance from the past. A smile appeared on his face.

He took a deep breath and focused up. His eyes fell onto the lake.

This place was the source of Stone Medicine, the center of the three grand veins containing fundamental essences and fortunes.

Another difference he noticed was a stone pillar right on top of the lake. It wasn’t that impressive in size but the runes carved on it could clearly be seen. They were completely different from the ones in the lake.

The latter was formed in a natural manner - the accumulation of worldly fortunes. As for the ones on the runes, they were domineering and supreme - the culmination from the grand dao all over the places.

The pillar seemingly reached the deepest location of the earth and became one with it. This allowed it to connect with the ancestral veins.

Due to the empowerment gained from the veins, the runes on the pillar continued moving and changing. They engulfed one particular item on top of the pillar, obscuring it in the process.

A meticulous observer would note that the runes weren’t protecting this item. It was a suppression.

Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed as he intended on bypassing the runes to see the thing inside.

“Boom!” The runes of the lake gradually lit up and started a supreme symphony capable of piercing through time and space, from Eight Desolaces all the way to Nine Worlds.

“Rumble!” Their lights shot to the sky. In the next second, these runes woke up again, brimming with life.

A figure appeared in this boundless radiance. She seemed to be from the ancient era, ethereal and illusory. Others would mistake her to be from their previous dream.

Li Qiye quietly watched the figure. The figure itself was faint already and the light made it harder to see. However, one could tell that this was a woman.

The figure alone could suppress the firmaments. Other masters and invincible experts weren’t worth mentioning before her terrifying aura. The gods needed to prostrate and the devil would tremble beneath her feet.

She was Immortal Assailant Emperor, the last Immortal Emperor of the nine worlds, perhaps the most brilliant of them all. [1]

The two exchanged glances; this fleeting moment seemingly lasted millions of years.

Within the dao runes and the lake were laughter, competitions, and heart-to-heart conversations, some scolding as well. The past would always remain the same.

“I left something behind.” Her voice was both pleasant and dignified. Li Qiye found it awfully enjoyable.

“I don’t know what it is but I’m sure you can come up with a conclusion. Otherwise, this world is finished, the same for you.” She added.

“Yes, I know.” Li Qiye stared at the suppressed item on top of the pillar and nodded. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A brief silence ensued.

“Congratulations, that day has come for you.” He broke the silence first and was happy for her.

She didn’t respond, only continuing to stare at him.

1. Now it says Immortal Emperor. It was Grand Emperor before, but the grand here could just be great and not a classification. This is rather vague so we’ll have to go with the flow before more context
