Chapter 5048: Chosen Successor

All eyes were on the dragon lords. If they dared to do anything to Peacock Monarch, it would be a declaration of war.

Nightwalker gazed intensely at them but didn’t say anything. Lunar Rabbit did the same; its eyes had a chilling effect on the crowd. As for Bloodfly God, no one could tell what he wanted as he sat motionlessly on his throne.

“Deity and Heaven Burial must be scheming something, right?” Yunyun asked.

“Eight dragon lords aren’t enough. There are still five commanding gods left for Demon, they have no chance of winning.” Ming Shi said.

Goldcrest was also perplexed: “Right, and plus, they have nothing to gain here.”

The crowd members felt the same way. It was obvious that the eight dragon lords harbored malice. What was the reason? Treasures and vengeance weren’t on the table.

In fact, they had no advantage to speak of. The commanding gods of Demon were stronger as well.

“This will be a big change.” Li Qiye said.

“Big change?” Ming Shi didn’t understand.

Peacock Monarch ignored the unwelcome visitors and glanced at the beasts and demons. Despite being moments from death, he still maintained his dignity and authority.

“Today shall be my last. The throne will be unoccupied so now but worry not, I have chosen a successor in her. In the future, she shall create a divine source and take over Feather.” Peacock Monarch spoke while pointing at Lil’ Freckle.

“What?!” This astounded all listeners as they stared at Lil’ Freckle.

None expected him to choose this unknown girl as the successor. Most haven’t seen her before.

There were two ways to become a commanding god. The first was to be chosen by the previous god and create a god source. The second was to obtain a complete god source from the predecessor and be accepted by the other demons.

Most thought that he would pass the throne down to Chillglare Hawk. After all, he was worthy in terms of power and status. This would bring about stability because others would be deterred from competing.

Alas, as for this young girl, she couldn’t maintain her position before creating a god source. Demons would come to challenge her, resulting in unrest in Feather.

“Why Lil’ Freckle? She’s still too young, can she rule over the demons?” Ming Shi said softly. The girl’s tiny frame was only appropriate to become a delicious meal for the demons.

“She’s his descendant?” Yunyun said.

“Unlikely.” Goldcrest said: “Demon is different in that we don’t pass the throne down to the descendants because if they’re weak, they’ll be destroyed by the competitors. That would only be harming them.”

Outsiders cared about lineages and the orthodox branch. Demons only cared about power and ability. Even if Lil’ Freckle was Peacock Monarch’s daughter, the other demons wouldn’t respect her for it.

“Her dao root is special.” Li Qiye said: “She is the most likely to enter the divine nest out of all the future commanding gods.”

“Really?” The youths didn’t recognize it.

By now, everyone’s attention shifted to the other commanding gods. Normally, branches didn’t interfere with each other but it would be favorable for Lil’ Freckle to have their support.

“Mist will not interfere with the monarch’s decision.” Nightwalker shook his head, accepting the choice.

“Not interfering.” Lunar Rabbit spoke as well. It had a feminine voice, pleasant to the ear like the flow of a gentle stream yet its water was unbearably cold to the touch.

“The position of a commanding god isn’t a joke.” Bloodfly uttered coldly: “You should reconsider now, Monarch.”

The forest became silent afterward. Even Lunar Rabbit and Nightwalker stared at him strangely.

Normally, other branches didn’t interfere in this matter. Plus, it wouldn’t be effective at all depending on the support from the members of the branch in question.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This was futile and potentially problematic yet Bloodfly did so anyway.

“It’s starting.” Li Qiye smirked.

“We will keep your suggestion in mind and work harder in the future but from today henceforth, this young lady shall inherit the throne of Feather.” Peacock Monarch smiled and said.

“Commanding God, if you insist on doing this, you are disrespecting your branch’s creed and followers.” Bloodfly’s tone became serious.

“I also find this unsuitable.” Guardian Pagoda said: “This is absolutely a mistake that will have grave consequences for the ten mountains.”

Everyone became startled after hearing the pagoda’s revealed attitude.
