Chapter 3752: Chi Xiaoyue’s Power

Liu Huaishi gave off an unstoppable aura. Just one hand wave could cut down Eight Desolaces. The whip, in particular, could beat the immortals above and the devils below.

The members of Buddha Holy Ground took a deep breath while looking at the whip. They could easily sense its might. In fact, it was most likely on the same level as Chi Xiaoyue’s Scarlet Moon Seal.

“Righteous Sect is no slouch when it comes to resources.” One commenter said.

Liu Huaishi’s personal abilities were impressive enough. Now, he became a tiger with wings, virtually unmatched in this place.

He was a real disciple from Righteous Sect. Of course, he wasn’t comparable to someone like Righteous Scion but still far above Thunderblade Xiao Fengyun.

The Xiao was a powerful clan but still far inferior compared to the actual Righteous Sect. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s fortunate that Senior Sister Xiaoyue has a dao lord weapon.” One student said after seeing the powerful whip, becoming very worried.

Nonetheless, there was still a chance for Xiaoyue.

“This is your real weapon.” Xiaoyue stared at the whip and said.

“This is given to me by a senior in the sect, a legacy from a wise sage. I can’t exert it to its fullest potential and will only besmirch its reputation.” Liu Huaishi didn’t reveal the whip’s name but it certainly had an illustrious origin.

“It belonged to Soaring Crane Heavenly Sovereign, the master of Heaven Devourer Dao Lord. Its name is Divine Goldwhip.” Dugu Lan sitting under the tree revealed the name of the weapon.

“From Soaring Crane Heavenly Sovereign?” The crowd became startled, even those from the previous generation.

Heaven Devourer Dao Lord was none other than the man who revitalized Righteous Sect. Under his leadership, the sect became mighty again, enough to push back the formidable Buddha Holy Ground.

His master wasn’t as famous as him. Nonetheless, he was still a top Heavenly Sovereign. His whip allowed him to be uncontested as the sect master of Righteous.

The whip was definitely not weaker than Xiaoyue’s Scarlet Moon Seal.

“This shows that Liu Huaishi is an important disciple there, they’re focusing on grooming him.” Others were shaken after realizing this.

“I have nothing but the utmost admiration for your knowledge, Fairy Dugu.” Liu Huaishi didn’t try to hide at all while cupping his fist towards Dugu Lan.

“Be careful now.” Chi Xiaoyue showed no sign of hesitation after the revelation.

She immediately attacked with her seal after one warning. It swept forward like a majestic mountain and crushed everything in its path.

“Rumble!” Time and space shattered. The seal appeared in front of Liu Huaishi’s chest before others could blink once.

“Crack! Crack!” The area in front of his chest shattered as well even before the seal made contact.

“Good move!” Liu Huaishi laughed and flicked his wrist. A series of whipping noises could be heard and the whip coiled into a great wall to stop the incoming seal.

“Boom!” The resulting blast was deafening. Everyone felt as if the world was spinning.

Both combatants staggered three steps backward after the exchange.

“Seems even.” Others noticed after the direct confrontation.

“The whip is really strong.” One commenter spoke on the whip.

Remember, the seal was a dao lord weapon yet the whip was competitive. Of course, this was partly due to the seal being incomplete.

“Activate!” Liu Huaishi shouted, not daring to underestimate Chi Xiaoyue. He knew that if he didn’t go all-out, defeat would be inevitable.

He released all of his vitality. Eleven palaces appeared and lined up, turning the vitality into a vast ocean of blood. The true fate protected by the palaces looked like a deity with an oppressive aura.

“Grand Dao Sacred Physique!” One spectator shouted.

Liu Huaishi finally showed his real cultivation realm by revealing the palaces.

“Impressive.” Xiaoyue praised but didn’t relent: “Activate!”

Her auspicious energy and vitality soared to the sky like a reverse waterfall. Numerous geniuses nearby were blown flying by the shockwaves.

Her vitality was dense and pure, seemingly endless. Just this alone was startling. However, she also had eleven palaces in her blood ocean.

“E-eleven palaces!” The crowd became astounded.

At first, even the students from Duality couldn’t believe it. Some rubbed their eyes and recounted again.

Sure enough, eleven palaces. This meant that she was in the sacred physique realm.

As one of the five heroes, the majority was in the Myriad-form realm. Lin Hao himself was considered strong at the grand level of this realm.

That’s why everyone thought that she would be in this realm as well. After all, she wasn’t as famous as the others.

Right now, her true cultivation realm caught everyone by surprise.

“I think Senior Sister Xiaoyue is number one among the five.” One student said, realizing that Xiaoyue has been hiding her true abilities.

“I have nothing to be proud about when there are so many hidden experts at the academy.” Lin Hao became sentimental. Someone far stronger than him kept a low profile all this time. There was no need for him to be prideful.

“The academy is mighty indeed.” Liu Huaishi was moved as well.

“You’re no regular disciple from Righteous either.” Xiaoyue returned the compliment.

It seemed obvious by this point that Liu Huaishi was an elite even in that sect.

“It’s my lucky day to be able to see a dao lord’s art.” Liu Huaishi raised his whip, ready to fight again.

“I can’t wait to see the secrets of Righteous as well.” Chi Xiaoyue said seriously.

The Chi had a dao lord before but Righteous Sect had a far deeper history. She had no advantage to speak of in this fight.
