Chapter 4877: Dark Overlords

Li Qiye took his time tracing the monument with his finger in an effort to understand it.

Firerage followed Li Qiye and circled around the large statues. He felt like an ant crawling around a large mountain.

“Are these statues solely meant as a memorial?” He asked.

“Who says that they are statues?” Li Qiye smiled.

“What are they then?” Firerage found this surprising.

Anyone could see that this monument included four statues, one large and three small.

“It is actually a formation, or perhaps something a little more complex. Mmm, a treasure with an embedded formation.” Li Qiye said.

“I see, a formation treasure.” Firerage shuddered and took another careful look at the monument.

Despite not being a formation master, he was still a powerful Immortal Sovereign on top of having followed a dao lord for a long period. His vision exceeded many ancestors from other sects.

Alas, he couldn’t see any connection between the statues and a formation. There were no energy ripples or runic lines.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Is it still active?” He asked.

“Unfortunately, no. Otherwise, Immortal Gate would still be here.” Li Qiye responded and stared at Firerage: “Just think about its name, Primal Trinity Against The Heaven. That speaks plenty to its power.”

“It’s that strong?” Firerage shuddered.

“The resources of Immortal Gate exceed your imagination.” Li Qiye said: “It actually has an even greater treasure, far stronger than this thing.”

“What is it?” Firerage trembled and thought about another treasure - His Majesty’s immortal shield. It made him undefeatable for so long.

“What a shame.” Li Qiye didn’t answer and murmured: “It went on to serve as a stepping stone for the Ancient Ming.”

“This race sounds monstrous.” Firerage said.

“They are powerful and frightening. However, the being behind them was even more frightening.” Li Qiye said as he was still tracing his finger through the monument’s cracks: “This being overwhelmed the formation and seized a heavenly treasure.”

“Who is it?” Firerage couldn’t help but ask.

Li Qiye didn’t answer and gazed deep into the sky. However, the coordinates of his target kept on shifting.

“So this formation is crippled?” Firerage changed the topic.

Though the imperial guards have brought back the pieces and assembled them, the cracks still remained. Thus, no power could be sensed here.

“That depends on who we’re talking about.” Li Qiye smiled: “Your Majesty was truly lucky to come across a blessing for ages to come.”

“...” Firerage didn’t know how to answer. Calling His Majesty lucky wasn’t out of line. After all, cultivation success did require some luck.

The problem was - His Majesty was killed in battle. Was this still considered lucky?

“I’ve decided to help so I will go all out. Since your king couldn’t let go of Eight-stallion, I will guarantee its future prosperity.” Li Qiye smiled, raised his hand and slowly made a palm.

“Buzz.” Firerage felt his own grand dao trembling, that his dao source was being peeled off.

Li Qiye’s hand seemed capable of tearing time and space apart along with the myriad dao. Chaos true energy poured down like a waterfall.

Firerage couldn’t believe it because he couldn’t produce this immense level of energy despite his cultivation.

“Buzz.” Energies turned into laws and laws turned into a dao chapter.

Firerage was still in a daze as the chapter created a dao domain and sealed the area.

Space and time rotated within this domain like a trigram symbol. Firerage got the impression that this domain wasn’t the only thing rotating but the entire world.

Everything shook ever so slightly. This minute change was virtually indiscernible to regular cultivators but a few noticed it.

In the Immortal Continent, numerous conquerors and emperors felt this change.

Deep in the unreachable void filled with darkness, a terrifying existence suddenly awakened. This was because someone was trying to steal its supreme artifact.

Its eyes alone possessed untold power and destruction. No living being could ever hope to beat it.

Conquerors, emperors, and dao lords would tremble in fear. The mightiest dragon lords would be scared out of their mind.

This existence immediately spied on Li Qiye’s location, capable of seeing through the myriad realms in the blink of an eye.

In this same second, other eyes in the void opened as well and gazed upon the world. Alas, the first existence felt something murderous from the world, wanting to end it. Therefore, it closed its eyes again, no longer illuminating Li Qiye’s location.

The other hidden overlords did the same. Silence returned to the void.
