Chapter 4942: Sneak Attack

Unfortunately, Arrow Saint couldn’t save Four-faced Venerable and Three-armed Monarch. Bloodsea Blade lived up to his fame - always seeing blood once his blade was drawn.

Spectators were afraid, wondering how many more ancestors from Deity would show up.

“Fellow Daoist, you should have shown mercy.” Arrow Saint resembled a god as he spoke. His prestige was damaged by failing to save his allies.

“Their weakness killed them.” Bloodsea said, still holding his saber’s hilt.

The bloodlust was gone now but everyone still felt a chill around their neck. It was as if that saber could cut them down at any moment.

“Fellow Daoist, why do you insist on interfering?” Arrow Saint’s voice was profound and dignified, commanding respect.

“Start!” Bloodsea attacked again, utilizing another slash of the blood affinity.

No one expected him to attack so quickly, not caring about observed conventions during battle.

Of course, he was part of the Ten Monsters. These villains didn’t care about elegance or putting up an act. They preferred to just fight and kill.

“Break!” Arrow Saint also didn’t expect the sudden attack.

The dao was his bow and the stars were his arrows. He condensed their power and shot powerfully.

The celestial arrow pierced through the fabric of space, leaving behind illusory fragments. Though he was ten thousand miles away, it appeared before Bloodsea in the blink of an eye.

“Boom!” The slash and the arrow collided and quaked the region.

Both shattered at the same time but somehow, the slash resembled a cicada shedding its carapace. A second slash appeared after the disappearance of the first, still aiming for Arrow Saint.

This took him by surprise because this second slash was just as strong as the first. He took one step forward and used the earth as the bow and the dao as the arrow this time around.

The land beneath him shot up in the form of an arrow in order to block the second slash, looking like numerous peaks.

He didn’t stop there either, waving his hand and creating a rain of arrows right above Bloodsea. There were too many to count, looking like divine peaks shooting down with the intent of crucifying Bloodsea.

“!!!” Students were also caught in this radius. It felt as if he wasn’t trying to kill only Bloodsea but also destroy Abroad.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Clank!” Bloodsea leaped up into the air without any hesitation, spinning around like a spinning top with his blade and creating a tornado with a bloody hue.

This rotation successfully destroyed all the incoming arrows just in time since his momentum and energy waned. Suddenly, the space and time around him became twisted and melted down.

Spectators nearby felt their body and power being twisted as well. They wanted to scream and struggle only to fail.

“Boom!” An undetectable assailant attacked Bloodsea.

He raised his blade forward and the contact made a loud bang. Nonetheless, the force still sent him down to the ground and created a huge pit. He lost control of his energy and vitality, spouting out a mouthful of blood.

“I apologize, Fellow Daoist.” An emotionless voice spoke.

People looked up and saw a middle-aged man wearing a flashy robe, looking like a noble. Behind him was a great circle pulsing with celestial light, never stopping its rotation.

“Reincarnation City Lord!” Bloodsea uttered the title of the ambusher.

Many students heard this and couldn’t believe it. Some also glanced over in Qing Songke’s direction.

This city lord possessed three sacred fruits. Reincarnation was one of the twelve lineages as well, created by Blazing Conqueror.

Reincarnation City was part of it and has been around since time antiquity. Its patriarch was Timewatcher Conqueror.

He has done a great job revitalizing his sect and gained incredible influence in the entire lineage. After all, he was relatively young and already had three dao fruits. He had the potential of ending with six. At that point, he could ascend into the next two continents.

The ambush was unbecoming of his status. After all, Reincarnation City was a famous sect that follow the righteous path.

Thus, students stared at Qing Songke because the city lord was his father.

Qing Songke turned away as if nothing was happening or that he didn’t want to watch.

“Your saber dao is something else indeed, Fellow Daoist.” The city lord smiled, avoiding the issue.

It was one thing for Bloodsea to ambush others since he was a notorious villain. The same couldn’t be said about this prestigious sect master.
