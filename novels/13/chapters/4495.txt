Chapter 4496: Cloudgrasp Elder

While the two old men chatted, Li Qiye sat down while the daoist and Jian Ming stood by his sides.

Disciples from Archipelago stole glances at him because they thought that he didn’t look like an ancient ancestor at all. If Wise Ancestor didn’t say it himself, they would never mistake him for one.

If they saw him outside, they would only think of him as a regular cultivator, completely unforgettable.

“Many big shots have arrived.” The daoist scouted the hall and told Jian Ming.

Jian Ming’s black eyes moved back and forth like that of a thief. His focus was on the guests.

Even though some hid their appearances, he could still see a few clues.

“Haha, of course, it is a secret auction after all. Some of these big shots might be enemies too.” Jian Ming chuckled. He seemed eager to see some competitive biddings for the sake of entertainment.

“Hmm, these ancient lineages are here too. This auction will be fierce.” The daoist scouted the big shots and focused on several important figures. It seemed like he was tempted to make some moves again.

This secret auction didn’t let them down. These big shots were powerful and most importantly, wealthy.

They would certainly spend a large sum on their desired treasure. Enemies would compete using wealth instead of force in this place. Some would certainly try to be disruptive and increase the bid for no reason.

“Well, no one can compare to our young noble in terms of wealth.” Jian Ming laughed and raised his voice: “How can a flock of chickens compare to a crane?”

He arched his chest and looked as arrogant as can be as if he was a supreme being superior to everyone else.

The daoist glanced at him with disdain, thinking that he was about to ride Li Qiye’s coattails again.

Many participants nearby heard him and instantly looked over in his direction. Though they hid their identity and body, just the feeling of being gazed upon by them was chilling.

Jian Ming shuddered a bit and became nervous. Nonetheless, he composed himself and proudly said: “What are you looking at? Know your place before the peerless young noble.”

The comment peeved the listeners but since they were experienced, they didn’t bother reprimanding the juniors. Nonetheless, their juniors glared aggressively at Jian Ming.

“Are you not afraid of being beaten?” Li Qiye smiled.

The unfriendly gazes did intimidate Jian Ming. Nonetheless, he laughed and said: “Once again, I’m merely speaking the truth. If that is a crime, then ignorance is a sin and I’m trying to save people from doing so.”

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t say anything else. From an objective viewpoint, there was no problem with Jian Ming’s statement. Li Qiye was indeed peerless and others should back off. Alas, they were ignorant of his actual ability, albeit to no fault of their own.

The daoist stared at Jian Ming and didn’t have an issue with the actual statement. He was only annoyed at the guy’s sycophantic attitude. It was truly infuriating - an open invitation for others to want to stomp him.

“Bold words, I want to see how peerless he is.” A matter-of-fact voice sounded nearby.

Jian Ming and the daoist looked over and saw an old man with a sharp gaze. He didn’t have an oppressive aura but they could tell that he looked down on them.

This was someone who has been used to sitting above the clouds and accepting the worship of others, being in control of their fate.

The disciples sitting behind him also wore expensive robes and looked brilliant. This also made them appear haughty.

“An elder from Three Thousand Dao.” Wise and Turtle-seeker looked over and became serious.

An elder from Three Thousand Dao was often comparable to an ancestor from the other great powers. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Some hidden big shots stopped their stealth approach and came to greet him.

Jian Ming wasn’t afraid at all due to his backer. He was only taken aback for a moment before laughing: “Ah, it’s Cloudgrasp Elder, greetings.”

Jian Ming’s foul mouth was matched by his vision. He immediately recognized the elder.

“Junior, let your senior talk.” Cloudgrasp Elder didn’t want to converse with a junior.

Jian Ming became annoyed and continued: “Cloudgrasp Elder, our young noble is supreme, people don’t just get to talk to him. You’re only a junior in his presence so if you want to communicate, you’ll need to represent a senior.”

This conversation eventually attracted the attention of the crowd. Cloudgrasp Elder certainly had enough clout to prevent others from being rude towards him. This included the ancestors.

Now, a junior dared to provoke him? The disciples behind him didn’t stand for this.

The daoist contemplated and thought that this still required plenty of courage on Jian Ming’s part. Though he acted like a sycophant, he knew exactly what he was doing.

Cloudgrasp Elder’s expression darkened and glared at Jian Ming. This piercing stare caused some to shudder but Jian Ming stood proudly without backing down.

“I represent Skybreak Monarch today!” He uttered coldly. Each word struck like a javelin piercing the ground.

The crowd gasped after hearing this. They cupped their fist towards him in order to show respect toward Skybreak Monarch.

Even Wise and Turtle-seeker took a deep breath. This was one of the six great monarchs under Dao Sanqian.

“Skybreak Monarch…” Jian Ming licked his lips. He understood how frightening the monarch was. However, he couldn’t back down and besmirch his young noble’s reputation.

He bowed towards Li Qiye and asked: “Young Noble, he represents Skybreak Monarch.”

“Just a nameless junior, never heard of him.” Li Qiye answered without batting an eye.

This caused a furor to break out in the quiet hall. Someone had just insulted Skybreak Monarch, calling him a nameless junior. This was disrespectful to both the monarch and Three Thousand Dao.
