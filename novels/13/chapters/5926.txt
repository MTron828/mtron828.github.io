Chapter 5926: Good Boy

“Good boy.” Li Qiye smiled and rubbed its head.

The beast wagged its tail and stuck out its tongue, looking adorable and pitiful like a well-behaved puppy.

“What is this thing?” Chu Zhu remained cautious, aware of its murderous potential.

“A flood tiger.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Woof.” The beast let out a cry, feeling honored after being recognized.

“This is a flood tiger?” She took a deep breath.

“Of course.” He responded.

“Grrr.” It barked at her, clearly unsatisfied.

“Because it shouldn’t be around anymore. Flood tigers are descendants of two types of grand sea monsters from an ancient era, they usually slumber in Uncrossable Expanse, illusory and unpredictable with a potent bite. Rumor has it some Grand Emperors were eaten by them before.” She elaborated: “So this is an actual flood tiger?”

The beast was too well-behaved to match the mythical beasts. Nevertheless, its initial appearance was fierce indeed.

“Woof.” The tiger praised her for her knowledge.

She felt it was looking down on her despite acting like a puppy. In other words, this flood tiger seemed to be using its master’s authority to bully others.

“Buzz.” The light of the prison dissipated and the figures gradually disappeared.

“Stay.” Li Qiye raised his hand and stabilized the disappearing prison.

“Poof!” A dao flame manifested into reality within his palm. It didn’t possess any heat, only a refreshing feeling like the flow of the dao.

Chu Zhu had never seen a flame of this profound level before. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Zzz...” His flame melted the walls of the prison and activated its dao laws. Chaos true energy erupted like the opening of a world.

“This is...” His casual gesture made Chu Zhu feel something unique - such a dense level of chaos true energy not seen anywhere else in Sin.

With the palace melted into liquid, dao laws channeled this liquid into the figures and granted them a physical form.

The villagers watched in awe, unable to understand what was happening. Nevertheless, statues appeared all over their village now.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye took out a strand of primordial light and tossed it into the air. It automatically split into rays to enter the statues’ forehead, creating a pulsing effect.

“Boom!” The statues glowed resplendent for a second before their light converged and plunged into the ground beneath their feet, entering the earth veins.

Dao laws appeared in the subterranean expanses and connected the statues to the earth veins, granting them endless vitality.

“Splash!” Crystal-clear water suddenly gushed from the dried well.

“Water, water!” This drove the water into a frenzy. They jumped and danced in excitement.

After all, each drop of water was precious in this barren land. Now, water gushed out from the well, no different from an eruption of liquid gold.

This was only the beginning. Roots emerged from the area around the village and grew into verdant trees. In just a matter of moment, they blotted out the sun and gave the village shade.

Meanwhile, water from underground flowed ceaselessly, transforming into a stream. The once parched village became a true oasis and the soil turned fertile.

For ordinary villagers, this scene was beyond their imagination and could only be found in myths.

“Immortals, immortals have descended and graced us with their divine compassion!” They kowtowed repeatedly in the direction of Li Qiye.

Only an immortal could transform their village into an oasis in the blink of an eye, blessing them with a new life.
