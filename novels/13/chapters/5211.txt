Chapter 5212: A Favor Repaid

The pagoda could suppress nearly everything in the upper continents. Only five or so cultivators could actually withstand it.

“Why is he here?!” A twelve-fruit dragon lord’s expression darkened.

When not counting those who have entered the immortal continent, Immortal Pagoda Conqueror was among the top five cultivators.

He had dominated the lower continents and destroyed numerous sects of The People. He had slain famous conquerors and dao lords as well.

The most frightening thing about him was his primordial dao fruit. Just one alone granted him invincibility.

Only a few existences in history possessed this fortune - Luminous, Nightmoon, and Immortal Pagoda.

The former conquerors were mighty enough to challenge Celestial Court. However, they were no longer in the upper continents so he was the only one with the primordial fruit now.

Suppression and Immensity Conqueror no longer looked as relaxed as before after seeing the pagoda.

Li Qiye chuckled after seeing a primordial fruit in action since he was all too familiar with it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Why is he here?” One spectator asked.

Although it was only his pagoda, no other conquerors would dare to compete with him.

“He owes Alchemy Dao a favor.” The top cultivators understood right away.

As a pillar of Heaven Alliance, he always stood together with the heaveners. Alas, Alchemy Dao had invoked its fiery rune. Immortal Pagoda needed to answer the summon in order to repay the debt. This was the only logical explanation.

“That’s why people are afraid of Alchemy Dao.” Someone else commented.

Too many brilliant cultivators in history owed Alchemy Dao a favor for helping them with high-ranked pills.

Back in Immemorial Epoch War, Heavenly Sage Yuan saved numerous emperors and monarchs. This tradition continued with her successors.

Because of this, some of the current emperors and conquerors owed Alchemy Dao a life debt, and this must be repaid.

This was the reason why Alchemy Dao remained untouched despite possessing valuable alchemy materials.

“Boom!” The immortal pagoda easily crushed Impetuous’ dark galaxy.

The latter laughed and didn’t give up, summoning another galaxy. Alas, this was still crushed again by the pagoda.

“This throne is under my protection.” A suppressive voice came from above, rendering everyone breathless.

Immortal Pagoda Conqueror had made his intention clear in order to repay the debt to Alchemy Dao.

“Come and fight me!” Impetuous didn’t give up and unleashed a mighty attack: “Impetuous Skybreaker!”

An entire cosmo came together and rushed up toward the pagoda.

“Rumble!” This had enough power to destroy an entire region.

“You overestimate yourself.” The voice answered.

In the next second, a primordial power descended from the pagoda and obliterated the cosmo.

“Crack!” The pagoda slammed into Impetuous, breaking through several layers of dao defense in the blink of an eye.

Impetuous vomited blood, realizing that he was outmatched. He instantly opened a void zone and escaped, not giving a damn about his reputation.

The pagoda didn’t give chase. “Buzz.” It released a seal down onto the throne taken by Alchemy Dao.

“I believe I have made myself clear.” Immortal Pagoda Conqueror spoke again.

No one uttered a single word. Trying to seize the throne now was akin to not giving him face - a direct challenge.

“Boom!” After a brief silence, the pagoda flew back up the crack and the sky closed again.

“The debt is paid.” His voice echoed one last time. A promise for a supreme existence such as himself was ironclad.

“How many other conquerors owe Alchemy Dao a favor?” This was the question preventing others from making a move right now.

“This throne is guaranteed too, is there another target?” Someone asked.

Right now, the weakest throne occupier was actually Suppression Conqueror. However, he still had eleven dao fruits.
