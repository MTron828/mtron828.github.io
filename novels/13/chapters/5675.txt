Chapter 5676: Uniting The Three Bodies

“When my three bodies combine again, I shall return to the apex.” The dark being was not boasting but rather expressing reality.

“An inborn dao chaos physique, an inborn trinity true soul, that’s two. What’s the third? Your dao that started the epoch?” Li Qiye shook his head: “How are you going to use them? In my opinion, you’ve abandoned yourself and this ancestral bone has abandoned you as well, hence the need for the seal.”

“It’s all dependent on my whim.” The being said.

“I know what you mean and I just happen to have them, I know you can sense them. If you say that it is dependent on your whim, then show me. I have both your head and your inborn trinity blood right here.” Having said that, Li Qiye opened an ancient box, revealing a skull pulsing with darkness.

He obtained it from Bonesea first before it fell into the hands of Primal Trinity Dao. Now, it was back in his possession.

“Buzz.” As Li Qiye carried the head closer to the skeleton, some of its dark pulses turned golden, creating a contest between the two affinities.

“Hmph.” The dark being wasn’t surprised to see the head.

“This too, a drop of inborn trinity blood. You can have it back and show me what your whim can do.” Li Qiye smiled and raised one finger.

“Buzz.” A drop of blood condensed on his fingertip and had a golden affinity, harmonizing with the glow of the skeleton.

“Here you go.” Li Qiye said and returned the blood to the skeleton.

Even before the two made contact, flesh and muscles appeared on the bones. A primordial chaos manifested just like the beginning of the grand dao, wanting to morph this world back to its origin.

“Do not!” The dark being became alarmed and sent out an invisible barrier around the blood.

“Bam!” The blood was sent flying and landed on the ground.

Li Qiye stared at the drop of blood and shrugged: “Why don’t you want this to happen? You'll be reborn again with a perfect physique and soul, the great Trinity Ancestor will return to rule Celestial Court once more.”

“Hmph.” The being disagreed.

“Sigh, no one can help you if you don’t want to live.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“You wish to use me to destroy me?” The being uttered coldly.

“Oh darn it, sorry, I forgot that you’re just a mere reversal form that has fallen into the darkness. If I bring you back, the first thing you’ll do is destroy this form. There’s no way the holy being will allow such travesty to exist, a true abomination that had disgraced the body’s former glory.” Li Qiye said.

He paused for a second before continuing: “But you think too highly of yourself. I don’t need to bother with this method if I want to destroy you. Just brute force is enough and from then on, the mysterious visitor of Celestial Court will be no more, forgotten by the world.”

The being took a while before asking: “Then why did you bring these things here?”

“I’m just that good of a person, and I have nothing but reverence for the founder of the epoch, Trinity Ancestor. That’s why I want to help you be reborn with that head and blood drop. Am I not a good person?” Li Qiye said: “Now, it is up to you.”

“Haha, the first thing I’ll do after rebirth is destroy myself, you’re such a good person.” The being said sarcastically.

“The world will be a better place with the addition of a Trinity Ancestor and the removal of a mysterious guest. What a wonderful thing to do, I’ll be able to have someone to have a nice chat with.” Li Qiye said.

“Dark Crow oh Dark Crow, up to no good again.” The dark being sneered.

“Oh? You know this title? I’m truly honored.” Li Qiye pretended to be surprised.

“Who doesn’t know of your immoral deeds in Heaven Realm? I trust that old undying geezer more than you.” The being snorted.

“Hurtful.” Li Qiye stroked his chin: “Comparing a kind person such as myself to those bastards, sigh, is there no trust in people’s heart anymore?”

“You and him are the same. Dark Crow, you are known for selling people yet they will still thank you for it, haha.” The being sneered.

“That’s a slanderous statement.” Li Qiye waved his hand: “I’ve never caused harm to anyone, they simply sought demise. What could I have done but to accelerate this to spare them from unnecessary suffering?”

The being scowled in response.

“It’s fine if you don’t believe me. The fact of the matter is that I have brought your head and blood back, you can come back to life anytime you want now. I’ll also leave the door open in High Heaven Aegis, you can leave as well.” Li Qiye said.

“Look, here you go.” Li Qiye formed a mudra and his primordial strands came together to form a radiant gateway.

“See, I’m leaving this here.” Li Qiye said: “I’ve shown enough sincerity at this point, no one will stop you from leaving.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The dark being was surprised this time after seeing the gateway. He naturally didn’t buy Li Qiye’s benevolent generosity.

“The Dark Crow in Heavenrealm was no good and the one in the nine worlds was a butcher. I can’t imagine the current Dark Crow being a good guy, hahaha!” The being sneered.
