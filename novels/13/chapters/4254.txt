Chapter 4255: Mighty Comprehension

The comprehension strikes put the spectators in awe with their flashy destructiveness.

The auras of the dao lords swept by like tornados and flipped everything over, creating total darkness. The sky vault was not spared, the same went for the ground. Primordial chaos replaced current entities.

“Oh mommy!” Cultivators were scared out of their mind. Some actually vomited blood or even fainted after witnessing the untold power from the strikes despite being a million miles away.

A few were done with watching and simply wanted to be away from this battle. Alas, the dao lord-level suppression fully immobilized them.

The sun seemed to have been crushed while the ground was caved in. Lost in the darkness, they wanted to scream but no words came out from their mouth.

After a while, light returned akin to the start of a new dawn.

“How about this time?” One of them murmured.

“No one can survive that terrible move, right? The full force of a dao lord.” His peer was pale.

No one refuted the level of those strikes earlier. It had to be the full force attack of a dao lord. In this case, two were used together. They thought that only ashes were left of Li Qiye now. In their opinion, even an immortal would have been killed.

“He has to be dead.” Another stared at Li Qiye’s position and saw a void. The spatial fabrics there have been crushed so only a black hole was left.

The duo heaved a sigh of relief. That attack earlier took all of their strength and their sect’s foundation along with numerous cultivators.

Given their advanced age, they would have died after using the two attacks. Fortunately, the vitality and energy of their disciples and allies left them just fine.

Defeating the monster named Li Qiye was a testament to their strength. This was the fate of those who dared to oppose them.

“Is he really dead?” An ancestor observed the messy battlefield. If that move couldn’t kill Li Qiye, nothing else could.

“No one in the world can stop two comprehension strikes at once.” A supporter of Sea Emperor said.

Others exchanged glances. An ancestor from an ancient kingdom said: “Yes, he might be able to dodge or block one. Two are impossible.” This was a high evaluation of Li Qiye, mainly due to his possession of Finality.

“No grave for him, that’s what he deserves.” The disciples of Sea Emperor were ecstatic.

“That’s right, no mercy for the impudent.” Those from Nine-wheel finally relaxed.

They were vexed and annoyed earlier since their stronger ancestors lost to Li Qiye, not to mention the repeated insults and contempt. They wanted nothing more than to flay him and drink his blood.

Though the barbaric torture wasn’t possible, at least the guy was dead.

“Don’t celebrate so soon.” A distant voice interrupted their celebration.

Spatial remnants were blown apart along with boulders, revealing Li Qiye walking out of the void. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He held Myriad Era in front of his chest. The temporal light of the sword engulfed him and gave him a crystallized appearance. He seemed to have returned from a different temporal dimension.

“Li Qiye! It’s Li Qiye!” Many roared after seeing him.
