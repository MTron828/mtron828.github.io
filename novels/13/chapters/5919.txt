Chapter 5919: A Little Bit

The girl’s presence brought coolness into this scorching world, a bowl of icy springwater amidst the unending sand.

Her bright eyes, in particular, were comforting and refreshing like a spring in the wilderness. Her ponytail swayed in the hot wind, exuding an air of vivacity and freedom.

She slowed down the carriage and matched his pace, casting a shadow to shield him from the sun.

Anyone would be surprised to see her here, but she was also surprised to see the young man. She took a closer look and noticed his lack of cultivation.

His plain attire and ordinary frame made him unremarkable. Yet, something about him drew people in - an inexplicable sense of returning to simplicity and authenticity.

All in all, he was ordinary yet as alive as could be. She then glanced at the sword tied to his back, hidden beneath the cloth bundle.

It exuded no aura or gave any hint of sharp intent. This seemed to be an iron sword without a sharpened tip.

There was something off about this young man walking in the desert. His presence was somehow both incongruous and natural, adding to her confusion.

A mortal wouldn’t be able to survive the cruel sun and merciless sand. Of course, he didn’t seem to have an easy time either. His feet sank deep into the yellow sand after each step while the wind brought sand to fill his robe and blind his eyes.

Such harsh conditions would make the most determined mortal grit their teeth and muster all their strength. However, the young man’s expression showed no pain or discomfort.

His journey was enjoyable, no different from a morning stroll in one’s garden or an evening walk down the streets. He found enjoyment where others suffered pain.

Although full of doubts, she found no hint of him being a cultivator. In Sin, those who could hide from her gaze were far and few in between. No matter how she looked at it, he was not a hidden cultivator living in seclusion.

For some strange reason, this mortal’s presence in the desert was more natural than hers. She thought she had invaded his world and shouldn’t be here.

This sudden realization made her want to blurt: ‘Impossible.’

She roamed the realms freely so how did she become an intruder in someone else’s world? It felt as if he had created everything nearby outside of her. She didn’t need to be here for she was unnecessary - a first experience for her.

The young man didn’t say anything, seemingly unbothered by her presence. She followed him for a bit, still shielding him from the sun.

“Do you want a ride?” Eventually, she couldn’t help but break the silence. She had a pleasant and refreshing voice just like her aura. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He finally took a look at her, nodding with a smile before climbing up the carriage. He had a carefree expression as he took off his shoes and went to the back to lie down.

She was at a loss for words due to his demeanor and his actions, treating the carriage as his own and her as a driver. Did she come here to specifically pick him up?

She was an influential figure but her status and background didn’t matter now. She felt as if she needed to play the role of the carriage driver.

She smiled wryly and flicked her ponytail, still speaking with a polite tone: “My name is Chu Zhu, what’s yours?”

“Li Qiye.” He answered with a smile.

“Do you practice martial arts?” She glanced at his sword again. It looked like a weapon to fend off beasts in the wilderness.

“Just a little bit.” He said.

“Just a little bit.” She murmured, wanting to ask for more information but being nosy was not her personality.

“You’re not from here, right? Another continent?” She looked around and asked.

“I don’t know, I haven’t been here for a long time so this place has become unrecognizable.”

“You visited before?” She became interested.

“A long time ago but it didn’t look like this. Maybe I got the wrong place.” Li Qiye said.
