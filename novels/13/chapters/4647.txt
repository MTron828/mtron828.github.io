Chapter 4648: Heed My Call

Keep in mind that this was an attack performed by a top genius. The result was immaculate since he was comparable to many ancestors from the great powers.

This meant that the tablet could have crushed an ancestor into bits or blood. The victim had no chance of stopping it with their bare hands.

“He’s stronger than True Immortal Spirit.” One ancestor concluded. His peers felt the same way.

“He’s controlling the foundation of Golden Gate and is blessed by its fist dao. His own power might not be on the same level.” An expert doubted.

The supporters of True Immortal or friends of True Immortal Spirit didn’t think that Li Qiye could be so strong.

“Don’t forget, he dominated True Immortal Spirit before.” One big shot reminded the crowd.

No one could challenge this fact so they kept their mouth shut.

“Regardless of the circumstances, it is impressive that he can stop it with his bare hand.” A powerful ancestor said with a serious expression.

Listeners shuddered because they couldn’t have done the same thing regardless of their methods.

True Immortal Young Emperor, Speargrasp, and Tian Feng became serious as well. They considered Li Qiye a true threat.

“Heavenly Dao Raiser!” True Immortal Spirit roared and his halos merged together into a peerless dao.

“Rumble!” The runes in the tablet shot to the sky and created a divine path.

When the tablet was open to create this path, the peerless dao shouldered all the powers in existence. Everyone felt as if a dao lord was standing before them.

“The path of a dao lord…” One expert turned pale.

“The tablet has embedded grand dao from the lord, it’s stronger than regular dao lord weapons.” Someone took a deep breath and said.

“Boom!” The peerless dao in the form of a path smashed down on Li Qiye.

He shot downward like a meteor and slammed into the ground. Some thought that this was enough to obliterate him.

“Pretty impossible to block that attack.” One spectator said.

“It’s a sure-kill move.” Another expert commented.

This was an attack from a dao lord. Ancestors couldn’t stop it, let alone a junior. Grievous injuries or death were inevitable. Only ancient ancestors could have stopped it.

“Fist, heed my call.” They suddenly heard Li Qiye’s laughter and a chant.

“Boom!” A majestic fist intent rushed out like a tsunami from Worldbreaker. It roared like a dragon before entering Li Qiye’s body.

This fist intent was monstrous. Once released into a single place, it could annihilate a great power without any problem.

In this case, it was only one strand but nonetheless, it had immense potential. The empowerment made Li Qiye look like a primordial beast. One swing of his hand could destroy any foe.

“Impossible!” An ancestor bellowed.

“No way!” Mad Fist himself screamed.

The fist dao of Golden Gate originated from Worldbreaker Fist. Golden Fist Emperor studied Worldbreaker for generations before creating his own dao.

He observed and sensed the fist intents there, going as far as experiencing them with his body. Of course, he didn’t dare to do so for long since the risk was becoming a fist slave.

In history, no one has been able to control the fist intents from Worldbreaker or borrow their power. Only fist slaves could do so but it meant an eternity of imprisonment.

God Fist was the sole exception to this rule - a user of Worldbreaker’s fist dao that was able to leave this place.

Now, Li Qiye borrowed its power after a single chant. He didn’t perform a technique or mudra at all. In fact, he didn’t have his own fist dao and merit law. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

These were mere words that managed to summon Worldbreaker’s power. He has done the impossible.

“Boom!” The sky turned dark after Li Qiye’s second punch. This was akin to a massive black hole being punched into existence.

It carried the might of Worldbreaker Fist, meaning that it had enough power to sink Sky Border. The loud explosions horrified the crowd.

The tablet was sent flying right away while the punch continued to head for True Immortal Spirit.

“Fellow Daoist, show mercy!” The alarmed True Immortal Young Emperor channeled his power instantly while borrowing from the cosmic forces.
