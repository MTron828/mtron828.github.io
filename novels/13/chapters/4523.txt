Chapter 4524: Bestowing Grace

The crowd became nervous. He had been quiet in the last auctions so they relaxed considerably.

Though the competition remained fierce, no one went as high as Li Qiye did. Therefore, his involvement was not a good sign.

Nonetheless, they still felt curious about his bid since it would be nothing short of monstrous and oppressive. There could only be one winner for this final auction. The majority was only here to watch the show at this point.

“Obviously, who doesn’t want this? Finish the auction first.” One junior complained.

“If our young noble wants this, then he’ll get it. Take a look in the mirror first and realize how futile your bids are.” Jian Ming immediately retorted.

A few big shots gritted their teeth in annoyance. Wise Ancestor smiled awkwardly and slapped him again.

“What is your bid, Young Noble?” The auctioneer asked eagerly, feeling the same anticipation as the rest of the crowd.

“Very well, since fate has brought us together, I shall bestow a fortune to your auction house.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“A fortune? Great, great, that’s a great bid!” The auctioneer became emotional and blurted out.

When he repeated “great” three times, everyone knew that this was not going well.

“What fortune?” One big shot asked.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Someone who was part of the list complained: “This bid is too vague while we’ve bid real physical items, what is a fortune here?”

No bid has been praised on the same level as Li Qiye’s just now and this worried the winning participants.

“Our ancestor has just sent a message. In addition to the aforementioned items, an Immortal Monarch of our sect is willing to bestow his grace to the auction house.” Alchemy Child received a message from a high-ranking member.

“An Immortal Monarch?!” This shocked the crowd.

“What does this mean?” A youth understood little about this matter.

The big shots, on the other hand, understood what a favor meant in this case. It was a great deal for the behemoths to do so.

“In True Immortal’s history, only very few existences can have this title.” A knowledgeable cultivator commented.

The crowd exchanged glances. True Immortal had produced countless top masters before. Alas, only a few could gain this title. They could be counted on one’s fingers.

“How many have received True Immortal’s grace before? Especially from an Immortal Monarch too.” A big shot from the south murmured.

The grace could vary in nature. However, it usually meant that the receiver would gain the protection of the giver without doing anything in return.

In this case, it extended beyond that since an Immortal Monarch has personally bestowed his grace, meaning that he would offer full assistance whenever Grotto Courtyard was in danger. There were other benefits too, albeit not as consequential. Therefore, this truly added weight to their bid.

“In addition to the previous items, our progenitor is also willing to extend his grace to Grotto Courtyard.” Cloudgrasp Elder waited for Alchemy Child to finish before revealing the intent of his sect’s big shot.

“Progenitor? Dao Sanqian!” This prompted some older cultivators to take a deep breath.

This was a being existing alongside the river of time. The title alone stirred the listeners.

“How does this compare to the Immortal Monarch’s grace?” Someone wondered.

The protection of Dao Sanqian meant that the auction house could operate for years without worries.

On the other hand, although the identity of the Immortal Monarch remained unknown, this character should still be brilliant.

“Who would I pick?” A big shot murmured: “True Immortal or Three Thousand Dao? Feels about the same.”

“Not necessarily. The progenitor of Three Thousand Dao is known as the teacher of dao lords. He absolutely stands at the apex, no different from a dao lord, or so people say.” Someone from the west didn’t dare to say Dao Sanqian.

“This is True Immortal we’re talking about, someone with the title of Immortal Monarch is definitely an ancient existence from a dao lord’s generation, perhaps a disciple of Blessed Dao Lord or a general of another…” A big shot commented.

Others agreed with this. During True Immortal’s strongest era, someone with the title of Immortal Monarch must have incredible achievements and might not be inferior to Dao Sanqian.

“Don’t forget, True Immortal is older than Three Thousand Dao, it has an advantage in terms of resources and foundation.” Someone else brought this up.

This was also true. The rich history of True Immortal implied incredible wealth and stability. Three Thousand Dao was lacking comparatively.

“I would pick True Immortal.” One participant concluded.

By this point, they realized that all other contestants have been knocked out. It would go down to either True Immortal or Three Thousand Dao.

“We must have this item.” Alchemy Child said with absolute confidence since he was representing True Immortal, not just his master.
