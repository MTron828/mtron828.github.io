Chapter 4903: Seeing Bloodsea Blade Again

Despite being the empress dowager, she had all the authority in Illumination currently.

“I was sad to hear about the lady’s passing.” The elegant woman said with grief.

“But you were there during that meeting, Empress Dowager.” Jian Yunyun said.

“Yes, I was present indeed.” She nodded.

“And you didn’t remember past sentiments, not helping my grandma.” Yunyun’s tone remained cold.

“I did not due to the agreement. The Alliance shouldn’t have obtained the key or Primal’s future would be ruinous.” She said.

“The Alliance is no longer the Alliance without the key. Your insistence on going against the creed will end up severing Primal.” Yunyun didn’t relent.

“Everyone has their own stance and explanation.” She said: “Little one, if you wish to end this storm, you must either hand the key over or get your empress dowager to show up. Otherwise, this will tear the Alliance apart and you will be buried with it. Not even I can save you.”

“We will never hand it over.” Yunyun said and hesitated for a moment before adding: “I will let the empress dowager know and she will preside over this.”

Illumination Empress Dowager could read her expression and responded: “Others might somehow fall for this but you are aware of my relationship with your grandma. She wouldn’t have been so desperate if her master was still around.”

The two of them were as close as sisters. Divine Empress Dowager has been missing for more than ten thousand years yet her friend still had no idea of her master’s whereabouts. There was no reason to be fearful.

“If she didn’t know, neither do you.” She concluded.

Yunyun gritted her teeth and said: “I’ll have you know that I have clues about her location.” She has been traveling in search for the empress dowager.

“Tell me, I will brainstorm with you.” The empress dowager said.

Yunyun shook her head: “I cannot but trust me, give me more time. Everything will be fine once I find the empress dowager.”

The empress dowager pondered for a moment before declining: “Even if I trust you, others in Primal won’t. You are exceptional among the young generation but you won’t survive this by being so stubborn.”

“As a member of the Alliance, I must do what I should.” Yunyun said.

“You remind me of myself when I was younger.” The empress dowager said: “Out of respect for your grandma, follow me to Illumination and I will protect you. Wait until this matter is finished and you may go wherever.”

“Do you wish to imprison me?” Yunyun remarked.

The empress dowager smiled and said: “Think what you will. If it makes you feel better, your young friend can come with as well.” She glanced at Li Qiye who was minding his own business by the bonfire.

She assumed that he was either Yunyun’s friend or perhaps her lover.

“This has nothing to do with him.” Yunyun refused.

“So be it.” The empress dowager said: “Come with me, little one, it’s the right choice.”

“I do not wish to.” Yunyun had no time to waste.

“Then I’ll have to force you, I’m afraid.” The empress dowager insisted.

“Buzz.” Sacred strands of energy emanated from her body and engulfed Yunyun.

The latter found herself to be outmatched once again. She tried to activate her regalia but it didn’t react.

“Boom!” She performed the secret technique again - Regal Sky Dragon or rather, Heavenraiser Tree.

A paradise manifested into reality and contained various phenomena.

“This is unwise, little one.” The empress dowager’s aura intensified and suffocated Yunyun.

She was even stronger than Ascension Sacred Lord. Yunyun could stop one or two moves from him but this was a different story.

Suddenly, she realized something and glanced in that direction - a man was standing there like a lone wolf at night. He wore a steel hat, looking like a statue.

“Who are you?” One of the palanquin’s carriers shouted.

“State your name!” The four strongest guards immediately attacked. Sword rays formed a net around him.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Clank!” A red glow flashed and disappeared once blood was spilled.

All four were decapitated. Their eyes were wide open in disbelief because they had no chance of stopping the fatal slash.

“Bloodsea.” The empress dowager became serious after seeing one of the Ten Monsters.

Her experts gripped their weapons and glared at him. Alas, they were shaking inside.

He was notorious for leaving a trail of blood once he unsheathed his saber.

“May I ask why you are here?” She said calmly.

“Let them go, leave.” Bloodsea was a man of few words.

As the ruler of a great kingdom, she didn’t react well to threats.

“If I refuse?” She uttered coldly.

“Then you will be talking to my saber.” He gripped the hilt and released his saber intent.

It was strong enough to deter her since she realized the power gap.

“We’re leaving.” She decisively made a choice. There was no point in wasting energy here.
