Chapter 5050: Arrival Of The God

The outsiders worked together to temporarily stop Lunar Rabbit and Nightwalker.

“Not a bad plan.” Peacock Monarch said: “Bloodfly, I’m afraid you won’t come out unscathed from this.”

The ambitious Bloodfly wanted to destroy the other commanding gods in order to become the supreme leader of Demon.

“Monarch, there shall only be one god in Demon after this.” Bloodfly coldly uttered before taking one step forward, releasing an ocean of blood with an unbearable stench. His face resembled that of a giant mosquito preparing to suck everyone dry.

“Screech!” Chillglare Hawk flapped his wings and tore the ground apart. Though he was not a commanding god, he had the power to challenge one.

“Bloodfly, I’m afraid your plan won’t work.” An ancient voice came from underground. The speaker seemed to have been alive since the start of time itself.

“Vine God!” The demons became emotional after hearing his voice. Outsiders heard this title and became startled.

He was the oldest and most likely the strongest among the six commanding gods. He has been in charge of Wood after Demon Conqueror. His peers showed him nothing but respect due to his established prestige.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Vine God, I’ve been waiting for you. Where is Dream Monarch?” Bloodfly, on the other hand, didn’t show any sign of fear.

“Bloodfly, your traitorous act will do nothing but harm Bug. Perhaps your branch shouldn’t exist at all.” A drowsy voice could be heard and had a hypnotic effect.

“Dream Monarch!” Everyone knew who it was instantly.

With this final appearance, all six commanding gods have shown up.

Now, the tides have reversed since Bloodfly’s plan had no chance of succeeding. One wrong move and it was over for him.

“Looks like it’s over.” Goldcrest heaved a sigh of relief.

“No, it’s only beginning.” Li Qiye smirked while glancing at the sky.

“Who wants to destroy my branch?” A cold voice joined the conversation.

Bloodfly’s sinister tone was horrifying enough. Alas, this voice made him sound like sunshine. The creepy voice could pull someone down to hell and torture them for an eternity.

Weaker demons and cultivators immediately fainted upon hearing it.

“Whoosh!” A nether wind blew by and caused a series of screams. As if passed by, it left nothing but skeletons behind, men and beasts alike. More than ten thousand living creatures departed from this world in the blink of an eye.

“What the hell?!” Spectators bellowed from a distance after seeing how helpless the victims were before the wind.

“Zzz…” Buzzes could be heard as if they came from countless mosquitoes. They devoured everything and left only skeletons behind.

“Mosquito demons?” Cultivators dropped down to their knees in fear.

“What is this thing?” Yunyun and the others turned pale as well.

Meanwhile, the wind appeared before the commanding gods and turned into a large golden mosquito. It seemed to have been made out of gold. Its eyes had a bloody glow and could rob someone of their soul instantly. The needle was sharp and long, capable of piercing the flesh and sucking blood and flesh.

“Golden Mosquito God!” Everyone was shocked to see this being, including Vine God.

“That’s the founder god of Bug, an evil one.” Goldcrest whispered.

“How can you be here?!” Vine God shouted, aware of secrets unknown to the others.

He knew that this god couldn’t appear but this was no longer the case.

“Hahaha.” Golden Mosquito’s creepy laughter echoed across Demon.

It was impossible to block it out. Even his words and laughter invade the mind, always echoing and leaving behind unceasing nightmares.
