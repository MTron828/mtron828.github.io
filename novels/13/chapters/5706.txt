Chapter 5707: More Overlords Cannot Stop Sacred Teacher

“As if you’re the only one with anima.” Niu Fen laughed after seeing this.

His anima tree manifested into reality with twelve resplendent dao fruits hanging on the branches. The runes on the shell came together, forming an anima barrier.

“Rumble!” The empowered staff could clear ten million miles of land but couldn’t damage Niu Fen’s shell.

“Old we may be, we would still like to receive pointers from the young generation.” Immortal Emperor Zhuo Huo walked out of his flame and challenged Demon.

In terms of dao debut and background, the emperor appeared older than Demon. However, the older one regarding their actual age was debatable.

“Show me your peerless imperial flame, Fellow Daoist.” Demon accepted.

“Very well, shall we get started, Lord of Imperial Field?!” Zhuo Huo said before shooting out flames from his eyes. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They looked like tiny strands yet still pierced through space and laws. The temperature was high enough to melt the armor of those standing too close.

This scared the hell out of everyone because the potent attack required zero preparation.

“Buzz.” A pulsing blue radiance appeared behind Demon Conqueror and easily extinguished the fiery strands.

“Lord of Imperial Field, you can’t be from the six continents?” Zhuo Huo was surprised to see this and recalled a few things about this visual phenomenon.

“Fellow Daoist, you know the tales since you’re from Alchemy Kingdom.” Demon said: “There is no hiding from Sacred Teacher. Celestial Court cannot protect you.”

Zhuo Huo’s expression changed since he knew the famous teacher of emperors. In fact, he was aware of ancient secrets because the Dark Crow had ties with Alchemy Kingdom.

The dark hand behind the curtains was a dreadful existence. Nonetheless, he took a deep breath and said: “It’s different now, it’s not a single overlord but many will stand shoulder to shoulder.”

“More overlords won’t amount to anything, he’ll reduce them to ashes if they stand in his way.” Demon said.

Zhuo Huo was shaken but didn’t respond. All Immortal Emperors feared the Dark Crow one way or another.

“Sovereign Azure!” Demon made her move.

After a loud explosion, the azure appeared above the emperor and descended downward, releasing lightning swords.

“Sky Incinerator Tree!” Zhuo Huo roared and summoned a divine tree, growing from the soil to the clouds. It released an inferno hot enough to burn the lightning swords.

His imperial flame was frightening indeed, successfully preventing the azure of blades from taking him down.

He raised his hand and revealed a contrasting flame - a bright spark emitting a refreshing and cool feeling, enough to neutralize the heat from his tree.

“Imperial Flame, Nameless!” He roared and in the next second, the spark somehow appeared on Demon Conqueror.

Once latched on, escaping seemed impossible. As long as the target understood the concept of fire, this flame would be able to ignite.

Unfortunately, this phenomenon happened to some spectators as well. This flame seemed to be alive and wasn’t limited by distance and movement techniques.

“Ahh!” Because of this, the big shots couldn’t dispel the nameless flame on them and were reduced to ashes. They didn’t have the chance to resist at all since death was instantaneous.

As for Demon Conqueror, her azure aura surged and she vanished, leaving behind an afterimage like a cicada shedding its carapace.

However, another flame still ignited on her.

“You cannot escape, my flame stems from the heart and there is always fire there, it is a maggot in the bones and won’t let you free until you’re made of ashes.” Zhuo Huo shook his head.

“Is that so?” Demon smiled and activated something. Space became immensely deep and she retreated into this new dimension.

An enigmatic blue eye opened out of nowhere; its rays could penetrate the heart. This included the emperor as well.

Although he possessed a formidable dao heart, his mind was still penetrated.

“Poof!” The nameless flame on Demon suddenly shifted over to its own master and incinerated him.

“Extinguish!” He roared and turned off the technique before being killed by it.

He became emotional after seeing such a strange eye for the first time. Evading its gaze seemed impossible.
