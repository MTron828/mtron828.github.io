Chapter 4233: Challenging Vastsea Venerable

The bright star of the sword ground, Tie Jian, suddenly decided to leave one day. The reason remained unknown even for the sect members, let alone outsiders.

Ling Jian didn’t know the reason why either and only heard speculations from the seniors and ancestors. One stated that he didn’t share the same ideology as War God or the sect back then.

War and battle were essential to their creed once. However, after the initial decline, they undertook a more passive and isolating approach. On the other hand, Tie Jian wanted to stick to their principles, resulting in conflicts between him and the upper echelon.

Another rumor took it in a different direction, that he left with heavy responsibilities. This was supported by the fact that he left with other sect members, not alone.

Keep in mind that when cultivators leave their sect, their cultivation and what they’ve learned would be taken away. This wasn’t the case here. In other words, the purpose of his departure might be to leave behind seeds for the sword ground.

After all, the warlike history of the sect had created numerous enemies that would love to kick them while they were down.

Thus, this served as a plan for the worst-case scenario. In the event of destruction for the sword ground, at least Tie Jian and his men would still be alive to carry on the torch.

Regardless of the reason, Tie Jian never showed up again after leaving. The world forgot about this great genius. No sign of him was left in the sword ground either - no plaque or memorial tablet.

Therefore, his appearance surprised everyone including Sectmaster Ling Jian.

“Are we going to finally see the overlords in action?” One spectator said softly.

“Fellow Daoists, you two are respected masters in our continent. Unfortunately, I’m afraid you still won’t be able to change the tides today.” Vastsea Venerable shook his head.

Though the words were casual, they still encompassed his confidence in winning against Tie Jian and Hallowed City Lord.

“The overlords are still one level higher.” A high elder sentimentally commented.

Tie Jian might have obtained the legacy of War God and Hallowed City Lord was a renowned master. Alas, they were still viewed as the underdogs.

“Men are stubborn at heart.” Tie Jian said: “Hope is always there until the very last second.” With that, he unsheathed his sword.

“Clank!” His sword caused the other blades nearby to resonate and vibrate.

It exuded light waves. They weren’t overly bright but once others were illuminated, they felt their battle spirit surging. Dying in battle felt just fine in this moment.

Runes manifested into reality along with loud explosions. One could hear war horns before the final battle.

“War God Heavenly Sword!” Even Earthraiser Vajra was shocked to see this sword.

“...” Ling Jian couldn’t believe it; everyone else felt the same way.

“War God is back!” He shouted, not expecting to see the sword in his lifetime.

“Congratulations to you and your sect, Fellow Daoist. The heavenly sword has returned.” The venerable stared at the sword and said.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“So the rumors were true, the sword ground really lost it before.” An expert in the crowd brought this up.

Daoist Sword Ground once dominated the world after obtaining the heavenly sword and its dao. Though some of its future disciples made incredible progress with this dao, the sword stopped appearing in public.

Therefore, some outsiders believed that they had lost the sword during the era of Sword God, not that their later-gen disciples couldn’t control it.

The sword ground never confirmed nor denied this rumor. Only the upper echelon of the sect knew the truth. For example, Ling Jian.

He was aware that the sword has been missing for millions of years. Their elites for generations have searched for it. This might also be the reason why Tie Jian left the sect.

Who would have thought that he would actually find it? In reality, Li Qiye gifted him the sword after obtaining it from Black Tides.

“Thank you.” Tie Jian calmly responded: “I shall continue my First Brother’s battle today.”

Others exchanged glances after hearing this. It was said that the battle between the overlords was the reason for War God’s death. Was Tie Jian talking about avenging his senior brother?

“If you think War God’s death has anything to do with that battle, it’s best to forget about vengeance. I fought War God, so did Senior Sanqian. But I’m ready for retribution if you insist.” The venerable said.

“What?!” The crowd gasped after hearing this.

“The legendary Dao Sanqian was there too?!” Someone blurted.

“Eight Desolaces aren’t connected, how did Dao Sanqian get there?” One youth asked.

“That only applies to other people, not Dao Sanqian.” A big shot turned pale while talking about this legendary figure.

Though Dao Sanqian was from Sky Border, everyone in Sword Continent was still afraid of him.

“Good.” Tie Jian accepted.

“Then we don’t need to waste more words.” The venerable said: “My incapable self would like to witness your peerless sword techniques. Would you two come together or one at a time?”

“That’s an overlord for you.” A spectating big shot said.

The calmness in his voice didn’t stop the words from slamming into the listeners’ heart. He had absolute confidence in his power and was ready to fight alone.

His two potential opponents glanced at each other. Hallowed City Lord then spoke: “You have created the unstoppable Torrential Rain Blade while we merely follow the paths of the wise sages, and are doing a mediocre job at that. Thus, we’ll learn from you together.”

They knew that the chance of winning alone was rather low. It wasn’t the time to care about their personal reputation.

This had nothing to do with supporting Li Qiye either. After reaching this level, they wanted to test themselves against an overlord.

“Since Brother Vastsea will be preoccupied, would you like to spar, Fellow Daoist Li?” Earthraiser Vajra stepped forward and challenged Li Qiye.

It was obvious that killing Li QIye would put an end to all resistance. No other sects and cultivators would dare to challenge them for Myriad Era afterward.

The crowd’s attention returned to Li Qiye, wondering if he would accept a challenge from an overlord. They certainly wouldn’t.
