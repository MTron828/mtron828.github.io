Chapter 4804: Calamity Incoming

The frightening wound actually made spectators feel pain as it started an all-out invasion. With loud buzzes, more and more black cracks showed up above, looking like burnt scars.

“What is he trying to do?” Spectators trembled in horror.

Mighty cultivators at the ancestor level and above felt the urge to run away from this incoming disaster.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Great powers, especially dao lord lineages and ancient sects, sounded their warning gongs.

“What is going on?” Their members and ancestors became confused.

“Rumble!” Some of these sects activated their dao foundation right away. Loud explosions and beams were caused by dao laws, all to erect their mightiest barriers.

“Are we under attack? Or is it a disaster?” An ancestor wondered because this was the only time for the dao foundation to activate.

“Be ready for battle.” Ancestors ordered their juniors to prepare.

Sects closed their gates and activated various formations in preparation for anything. This occurred all over Eight Desolaces.

“Boom!” Ancient clans became active to the east. Their presence alarmed the entire world.

This included the Puresun, Eternal River, Void Imperfection Three Schools… They have been reclusive for eras now and stopped interacting with anyone else until today.

Some great powers and their lords decided to withdraw entirely. Mountains and continents suddenly shifted away from their original position, leaving the inhabitants flustered.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Rumble!” Incredible changes and visual phenomena happened everywhere.

“Is this another calamity?” Everyone could tell that something was wrong. It wasn’t an issue of one or two sects going down. Eight Desolaces were at risk.

A deafening blast came from the Primordial Union. Cultivators had no words to describe this level of power. The world seemed as feeble as an egg in comparison.

Their evacuation and preparation were stopped short since this forced them to the ground.

“Pop!” A layer of the world seemed to be peeled off.

People looked up and were scared out of their minds since they saw two suns made out of blood. They were hundreds of times larger than the actual sun; their bloody rays cut as deep as blades.

“What are these bloody suns?” Even big shots became startled.

“They’re not in our world.” An ancient ancestor dropped down on his knees and murmured: “This is a realm countless dimensions away, they are connected to us now…”

“Those are eyes.” An eternal existence was horrified: “A being that has been banished on the river of time. We can see its eyes now despite being potentially epochs away.”

“Did you say eyes?” His peers sweated despite once being the strongest cultivators of Eight Desolaces.

Just the two eyes alone could illuminate their world and more. Its mouth was probably large enough to devour everything.

“Did Dao Sanqian summon this thing? What is he doing…” This became the key question for top cultivators.

“It’s not a summon, he’s acting as a guide and is waking that being up.” A person from a mysterious lineage murmured: “Another great calamity, is this the end of Eight Desolaces?”

“We must stop him then.” A mighty Divine Monarch regained his wits and shouted.

These masters thought that the sacrifice of Three Thousand Dao had nothing to do with them. They only focused on protecting their own sect.

Now, this awakening was something else entirely.

“Boom!” Alas, it was just too late. Black fog oozed out of the countless cracks in the air.

Upon hitting the ground, they turned into terrifying specters from various races - demon serpents, fire gods, spirits…

Their targets were none other than the great powers of Eight Desolaces.

“Attack!” The ancestors personally led the troops with the help of their defensive formations.

Unfortunately, the barriers were useless. These specters soared forward and attached themselves to cultivators.

“Ahh!” The purpose was to drain their blood dry. The blood was then taken back to the cracks in the sky and painted them red.

“They want to open a portal for that monster to come.” Spectators understood right away.

Alas, great powers simply couldn’t handle the horde of specters.

“Boom!” During this evasion in a mysterious location of Eight Desolaces, seven ancient pavilions appeared and turned into a heavenly formation with a supreme trident in the center.
