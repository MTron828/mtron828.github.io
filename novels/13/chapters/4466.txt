Chapter 4467: Pertaining The Legend

The four clans had a complicated history beyond the grasp of their current members. The Wu had a detailed record but it was still missing multiple important information and periods. This was only rather inadequate.

The youth from the Jian was luckier because a particular opportunity granted him more information than the rest.

For example, Wise Ancestor’s group had no idea who they were dealing with. They guessed that Li Qiye was an ancient ancestor. As for the youth, he had met legends before and knew about this particular being.

“Enough flattery, get back to comprehending the dao.” Li Qiye said.

The Wu disciples immediately sat down again to learn the saber art. Wise Ancestor went back to copying each variation and transformation of the art, every small movement and swing.

The Wu wouldn’t allow the merchant to learn the art. However, he had no intention of doing so in the first place.

He came closer to Li Qiye and mustered his courage to smile: “Young Noble, my cultivation and abilities are shallow, would you be so kind to bestow me a supreme merit law? Just so that I have something for self-defense.”

He aimed to take advantage of this ultimate opportunity. Gaining something would be a lifetime of benefit.

Li Qiye glanced at him and said: “Do you know the origin of your clan?”

The youth honestly responded: “I do if it’s just about our clans. Our forefather entered the world and followed the mysterious duck egg buyer, contributing to the creation of Eight Desolaces. Eventually, these followers chose to stay here.”

“As for anything beyond that, I know very little, just that our clan has been there since time immemorial under someone’s protection. Am I right, Young Noble?” He carefully chose his words.

“If you know about this, then don’t you have enough merit laws already? You aren’t satisfied with them?” Li Qiye said.

“Well… I, unfortunately, don’t have access to the ancient arts.” The youth smiled wryly.

“Oh? I’m sure your forefather didn’t return empty-handed after following the duck egg buyer.” Li Qiye smirked.

The duck egg buyer was an elusive individual. Historically, dao lords were well-known, especially their background.

One particular question was always up for debate - who was the first dao lord?

Two top answers included Puresun Dao Lord and the duck egg buyer.

According to the records, Puresun might be the oldest dao lord. Moreover, his method of proving his dao was different from all the subsequent dao lords.

The tale told of him during his youth. He sat on top of an immortal tree and obtained a dao fruit, becoming a supreme dao lord in the process. In a sense, he was the progenitor of the dao lords.

The opposing theory stated that the first dao lord was actually the duck egg buyer, not Puresun. This person was the first to obtain the grand fortune, already learning the dao beneath the tree way before Puresun Dao Lord.

This particular event lacked sufficient evidence and record. Nonetheless, regardless of whether the duck egg buyer was a dao lord or not, the being was unbeatable and even stabilized Eight Desolaces.

None of the subsequent dao lords could match these achievements, hence the belief that the duck egg buyer must have been a dao lord.

The being’s background and everything else were a mystery, hence the strange title. In the legends, the being’s catchphrase was “just passing by to buy some duck eggs.”

Since future generations knew nothing about this being outside of this catchphrase, the being’s title became “duck egg buyer”.

Of course, the four clans most likely knew more since they followed the buyer into battle. Alas, these ancestors kept their mouth shut and didn’t pass down any pertinent information.

Thus, future descendants only knew that their clans had followed the duck egg buyer, nothing more.

Merchant Jian was the same way. He knew many things due to his fortuitous life, just not any information regarding the duck egg buyer.

“I’m afraid our clan has failed and didn’t inherit anything.” Jian Ming took a deep breath then said.

“A failure indeed.” Li Qiye smiled: “Because of your fortune, you have access to the immemorial legacy and all the advantages. If your ancestors know about your current cultivation and how unmotivated you are, they’ll climb out of their coffin to teach you a lesson.”

“I apologize…” The youth became startled and lowered his head.

“Merit laws are bestowed by the heaven but cultivation is earned by men.” Li Qiye continued: “You are an inheritor of the Jian’s legacy, try harder instead of shaming your ancestors’ prestige.”

“I understand.” The youth started sweating and got on his knees. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Li Qiye spent more effort on the youth than the others. The past was long gone; these descendants couldn’t be blamed for knowing nothing about their ancestors.

“Try your best, all you need is determination and perseverance to live up to your potential, you already have the right fortune.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

“Thank you, Young Noble.” The youth was happy to hear this positive assessment. Someone of Li Qiye’s level was stingy with his praises. His fortune must be above most supreme geniuses’.

“You are smart but in order to become a legend, intelligence isn’t enough. Your determination needs to turn into an unyielding stubbornness, an obsession of sorts. To put it simply, your dao heart needs to be focused. Alas, your vanity and mortal attachments will become your burdens. Always remember, there is no lack of geniuses possessing both talent and luck. But, only a few ever become legends. After all is said and done, only the dao heart matters.”

“I will keep this in mind, Young Noble. Thank you for your guidance.” The youth said.

Li Qiye smiled, having said what he needed to. The youth’s future was up to himself.

When comparing Wang Weiqiao with this genius, Wang Weiqiao appeared to be a fool. Nonetheless, Li Qiye believed that Wang Weiqiao’s future achievements would far exceed Jian Ming’s.

This was because Jian Ming enjoyed life and its pleasures, making it hard for him to focus. On the other hand, the old man was simplistic and plain, resulting in having a stabler dao heart.

The reason why Li Qiye spoke so much was because of the youth’s last name - Jian, not just his talent. The members of the Wu weren’t so lucky.
