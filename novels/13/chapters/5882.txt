Chapter 5882: Rebirth

“Three prime rings!” The emperors had a terrible feeling after seeing this.

The figure revealed itself - a headless body. However, a drop of true blood floated upward and entered the body.

Once the two joined, a majestic life force erupted and caused devastating explosions.

They have never seen such devastation from pure life force before. This didn’t stem from dao power or any other offensive affinity. This body alone had more life than the world itself.

It continued to spread and engulf the world. Living beings ranging from ants to emperors felt themselves becoming one due to the primal overgrowth.

Those with the primal anima understood that they were far from this level - a feeling of being able to live as long as heaven and earth.

“Inborn Dao Chaos Physique...” An overlord in the deepest region of Celestial Court opened his eyes.

However, the three rings ignited, causing everyone to feel as if they had evolved to the next level. Even an ant became rather strong. This feeling of ascension left them in awe. This might be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

“Inborn Trinity True Soul!” World Emperor knew what it was.

Only one person possessed this physique and soul in existence - Trinity Ancestor. His mere presence changed the epoch and propelled them to the next height temporarily.

“Boo!” A skull appeared and combined with the headless body - a process resembling the fusion of heaven and earth.

“Boom!” However, darkness rushed out from the skull and engulfed the body.

“The impudence!” The body roared and channeled all of its power against the darkness.

Alas, black flames from the darkness wrapped around the body and constricted. It became a contest between a dark power and the supreme primal light. They seemed evenly matched but if this were to spread, it would be the end of the epoch.

The emperors could only watch since there was nothing they could do.

“Trinity Ancestor is alive again...” They took a deep breath and felt fear once more, especially those who knew him.

Trinity Ancestor, the previous epoch lord, was born with the greatest physical characteristics in history. Geniuses and heaven’s favorites later on weren’t worth mentioning in comparison. Their physiques and such were closer to mortals than to him.

Imperial Progenitor who created a new system, Dao Ancestor who studied all nine scriptures, and Lord of Derivation who created life... these mighty overlords stood no chance against him.

His inborn physical characteristics alone made him eligible to start an expedition. Alas, this proved to be his undoing. What returned was a shadow of his former self - someone who had succumbed to the darkness.

He was eventually imprisoned in Heaven Aegis during Grand Dao War, unknown to the public.

World and the others watched the fight between his light and the darkness, trembling with fear. The light represented the original Trinity while the darkness was the mysterious guest of Celestial Court.

The physique and soul were matchless in their prime state. However, just this corpse alone still had boundless vitality and life.

If Trinity Ancestor were to win, the world might be just fine. Alas, the same couldn’t be said regarding the guest’s victory.

“Buzz.” An energy spear descended from the sky vault, aiming straight for the skull. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was conspicuous outside of the initial flash. Nevertheless, spectators thought that they had been pierced.

Trinity Ancestor’s two sides found this to be a threat because it could pierce through Seven Nights Epoch.

Both roared and retaliated with the three rings, attempting to stop the energy ray.

“Pluff!” As they were distracted by the ray, time suddenly stagnated.

All cultivators found the flow of time to be a billion times slower. In this split second, a dagger pierced the body’s chest as if it had always been there, just undetected until this crucial point.
