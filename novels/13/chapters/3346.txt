The two sides argued it out in the chamber. Other witnesses were summoned, such as the children from Liu Village.

Fuyou hated Three Truths and because of his temper, the discussion became heated.

Huang Ning and Zhan Hu have been looking for a chance to take down Li Qiye. This became a potential path for them so they took advantage of this.

They weren’t stupid and could see that he was a rising star in Divine Black. Taking him down would become increasingly difficult. They must do something now before he has a strong foundation.

Most importantly, the upper echelon valued the peace treaty between the two sects. This was perfect for them.

They also left Gong Qianyue out of it. She was still the more valuable disciple when compared to Li Qiye.

The sect might abandon Li Qiye for the sake of peace. After all, they would still have Qianyue afterward. This sacrifice was still acceptable.

The two tried their best to steer the conversation towards Li Qiye being the one at fault. They eventually went as far as saying that he was a spy from a third sect. This was a way to deteriorate the relationship between Divine Black and Three Truths. It would wait for both sides to fight and weaken. Thus, they asked for an investigation on Li Qiye.

“Li Qiye is not a spy, impossible. He just doesn’t choose his words carefully.” The chief elder naturally got his side.

“Hard to say, he only got here yet caused so much commotion, even breaking the peace that has been going for decades. Very suspicious.” A demon elder said.

The demon elders here didn’t fully believe this. They also wanted to use this chance for their own gains.

Humans have become more prosperous with each passing day in Divine Black. Ping Suoweng in the first generation, Su Xu in the second, now, Gong Qianyue and Li Qiye who was extremely devilish. He had created so many miracles in such a short time.

The high-ranking demons could see that if this continued, the humans would take over this generation and the next.

They didn’t actually want to trial him as a spy but taking him down a notch would be good to solidify their influence.

“Are you all insane? What kind of spy acts like him?” Mountainbearer King supported Li Qiye and glared at Zhan Hu and Huang Ning.

“Always act with prudence.” Iron Whip Demon King sat there, looking quite imposing and vigorous.

He exuded a majestic beast aura. One could hear faint tiger roars around him. Regular disciples would feel great pressure in his presence. Their legs would go weak.

“Thousands of our disciples died for this peace treaty, we can’t let it go down. It’s too early to say if this Li Qiye is a spy or not, however, we need to punish whoever is responsible for threatening the peace.” He added.

The comment struck the correct points. He didn’t accuse Li Qiye but certainly focused on him.

There were three demons among the five peak lords. The members in this chamber immediately stared at the bodhi king afterward.

The bodhi king might be the most influential figure among the demons. They wanted to hear his opinion.

However, he only smiled and didn’t say anything.

The crowd then turned towards the wolf king, Zhang Yue. He might be the weakest of the five peak lords but he still had enough authority to make strategic decisions.

“I have investigated this matter in the past. This Li Qiye is not a spy. Plus, what sect would send such a devilish disciple to be a spy? And have you ever seen a spy this arrogant before? So no, I don’t think he’s a spy, it’s just his attitude and a lack of control over his words. It’s not really an offense.” The wolf king mused for a bit before answering.

This answer surprised many of the demons. They knew that Zhang Yue didn’t like Li Qiye at first. He completely changed his tune now.

“Junior Uncle Liu brought Li Qiye here so maybe this is all premeditated. All the evidence is gone so we can’t find anything...” Zhan Hu spoke.

“Bullshit!” Liu Fuyou didn’t hold back and shouted: “The investigation was carried out by you. Finding nothing only shows your lack of abilities, don’t put this shit on us.”

“So you and that Li guy really prepared everything?” Zhan Hu snorted after successfully enraging Liu Fuyou to make him say the wrong things.

“You!” Fuyou turned red from rage.

“Enough, the spy thing, we’ll end this here. Don’t bring it up again.” Suoweng finally spoke.

He wasn’t loud but everyone heard him clearly. There was no opposing him.

Zhan Hu and Huang Ning couldn’t do much more. They didn’t dare to challenge his authority without having actual evidence.

“Hmm, we need to focus on Three Truths instead. They will demand an answer regarding the death of two division leaders.” The bodhi king joined in.

All eyes were on Ping Suoweng now.

“What do you think, gentlemen?” Suoweng asked while looking at the crowd.

“The peace between our sect is vital and should continue.” Zhang Yue said.

“But they lost two divisional leaders. How are we going to appease them?” A demon elder asked.

“Someone needs to take responsibility for this.” Iron Whip Demon King asserted.

“Junior Uncle Liu started this, he should go to Three Truths and explain what happened.” Huang Ning said.

“Nonsense! We don’t need to make any concessions when they were the ones who started this. They should be answering our questions instead!” Huang Jie shouted.

He knew that Liu Fuyou hated Three Truths because of Su Xu. The guy would definitely die after going there because of his ill-temper.

“Focus on the greater good instead of the individuals.” Iron Whip Demon King uttered coldly.

“Li Qiye haughtily told the disciples from Three Truths to go back with unsavory messages. He clearly wanted to antagonize and humiliate them. That’s why if we want to appease them, we must start with an apology from Li Qiye. As for the blood ginseng thing, we can ask them why they were trespassing in our territory. They’ll have to come up with a good answer then.” Zhan Hu took advantage of this opportunity.

The protectors and elders exchanged glances. Most agreed, even the human elders.

“I’m also responsible for this, so I’m willing to go with Li Qiye as his guard.” He then suggested.

“Me too.” Huang Ning instantly said.

The two of them knew that escorting Li Qiye to Three Truths would be the best plan. That would be the best time for him to die and the blame would be on Three Truths.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m
