Chapter 4179: Imperious

“Illusory Princess, there’s an order to everything.” Wavesplitter was always direct regardless of the situation: “Fellow Daoist Chen and I found this grave first.”

“So what?” The princess wasn’t easy to get along with. She uttered coldly: “The graves have no masters, the virtuous and the worthy shall be the ones to get the divine swords.”

“You want to monopolize this grave?” Wavesplitter scowled.

“And? The strong get everything in the cultivation world.” She didn’t relent and stared straight at him: “Be smart, Brother, and join us. I don’t think your clan will appreciate you going against Nine-wheel Citadel.”

She was as imperious as can be due to having all the right circumstances. Her sect was stronger than the Wavesplitter Clan as well. Moreover, they lost their clan master recently to Ninth. To go against Nine-wheel Citadel now might result in clan extermination.

“You!” Wavesplitter turned red, unable to handle the blatant threat and disdain. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Both of them were Weapon Heroes. He didn’t think that she was stronger than him in the slightest.

“Are you sure you want to go against us?” The princess spoke intimidatingly.

Wavesplitter’s chest heaved up and down from rage. His eyes turned red, bulging outward.

“Hahaha, fine, I won’t forget today, Illusory Princess!” He laughed from being too angry and decided to leave.

He wasn’t a fool and knew the consequences of going against Nine-wheel Citadel. He could take her on but she wasn’t alone. There were plenty of experts behind her, especially that ancestor.

Even if he were to win the duel, he would still lose the grave. Moreover, it would create animosity between their two sects. He would be dragging his clan down towards damnation.

“And you, Brother Chen?” The princess turned her attention towards Chen Cangsheng.

“Your Highness, I agree with Brother Wavesplitter’s viewpoint, first come, first served. Feel free to disagree.” Cangsheng took a deep breath and stared at the princess and her entourage.

He was gentlemanly and reticent. However, this didn’t mean that he would back down easily. There’s a sense of pride and a willingness to fight deep in his heart.

“So you want to go against our sect?” The princess scowled. She enjoyed the feeling of superiority after Wavesplitter backed down earlier. Now, Chen Cangsheng was doing the opposite.

“No need to threaten me with Nine-wheel Citadel.” Cangsheng shook his head: “Members of Daoist Sword Ground don’t need to back down, and our sects already have ongoing feuds. If you think that we’re purposely provoking you, so be it.”

“Haha, I wonder if War God is still around.” The old man with pulsing eyes finally spoke.

Daoist Sword Ground was another behemoth in Sword Continent - a lineage with three dao lords and was just as famous as Nine-wheel Citadel.

They operated with a love for battle. Their golden age was under the reign of War God Dao Lord. They fought everyone and became unbeatable on top of sending numerous expeditions to the forbidden zones.

Their three dao lords were prime examples of warriors. Thus, they had fought virtually every sect in Sword Continent in the past.

In fact, they didn’t back down against the matchless Blessed Dao Lord and the ultimate sect known as True Immortal.

This started changing later on after the weakening of the sect. They weren’t prone to fight as much as before. Nonetheless, this didn’t mean that their members were afraid of trouble. Unyielding blood still flowed in their veins.

The emergence of the cultivator known as War God led them back to glory. He was their most gifted disciple during the era of Jade Bamboo Dao Lord. Some considered him to be the strongest sovereign. Because of this, he became one of the Five Overlords.

The ancestor was trying to read Cangsheng’s expression to obtain more clues about War God’s whereabouts. No one wanted to mess with this being if he was still alive.

“A nobody like me hasn’t met the great ancestor before.” Cangsheng shook his head, not answering the question.

A war over a heavenly sword happened in the past. Eventually, even the Five Overlords got involved and fought over the ocean.

Numerous unfavorable rumors spread about War God’s fate afterward - death in battle, succumbing to serious injuries, barely staying alive to the present day…

However, after millions of years, Daoist Sword Ground still survived and the facts remained unknown.

The ancestor didn’t respond. A senior like him didn’t want to bully a junior so he let the princess talk instead.

“Daoist Sword Ground might not be afraid of regular sects, but our Nine-wheel Citadel is in the top two right now.” The princess uttered coldly.

“I’m well aware, Your Highness, but I believe logic and reason are on my side here.” Cangsheng insisted.

“I see, show us what you can do then since you won’t give up.” The princess challenged.

“If you must act imperiously, I will overestimate myself and see what I can do against your famous Void Wheel.” Cangsheng accepted.

“Haha, good, I’ll be the judge.” Li Qiye stopped looking at the lines on the cliff and clapped.

“Hmph!” The princess still hated Li Qiye but this wasn’t the time to deal with him.

“I’m ready to see your War God Sword Dao.” She said.

Daoist Sword Ground had one of the nine heavenly sword dao right now - War God.

“I am incapable and can’t use the dao to its fullest potential. Nonetheless, I will try my best.” Cangsheng said.

“Make your move then!” The princess summoned a treasure wheel.

It poured down dao lord laws. They rotated continuously, ready to crush the firmaments. The wheel itself was long the size of her hand yet it seemed capable of containing the entire world.
