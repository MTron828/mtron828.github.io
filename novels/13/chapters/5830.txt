Chapter 5830: The Villainous Heaven Couldn't Kill Me

The ugliness of this overlord was repulsive. Others had a hard time accepting his existence.

Not to mention an overlord, regular cultivators could change their appearance. If they were this hideous, they would certainly choose a different form to present themselves. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, Lord of Derivation didn’t do so. This wasn’t a matter of choice but because he couldn’t. This was his final form - a race known as eldritch.

Everyone’s first impression of him was the word “evil”. Some members of Celestial Court wanted to flee even more.

“Boom!” The flesh continent shook violently, blowing stars away in the endless galaxy. This was beyond anything emperors could muster.

“Now’s the time to run.” Li Qiye glanced at them, no longer forcing them to stay.

The immobilized emperors had conflicting opinions. For example, Light-dragon and his group couldn’t help being fond of Lord of Derivation despite his appearance.

After all, there was finally hope for Celestial Court. Since one had arrived, it would only be a matter of time for the other four to descend. With this victory, Celestial Court would be in charge of the epoch.

However, the other group wanted to leave after seeing Lord of Derivation’s ominous appearance. Although they weren’t good people, there was still a line they couldn’t cross. They didn’t feel this lord shared the same principle.

“Dark Crow.” A pair of eyes on the rotten flesh opened, looking as if they didn’t have a fixed position and could move everywhere.

They were tiny compared to his size, looking like mung beans and making him look more untrustworthy.

“The villainous heaven should have rid the world of your hideous self.” Li Qiye glared at him.

This was the line on everyone’s mind, even those loyal to Celestial Court. They just didn’t dare to say it.

“Hahaha, he couldn’t kill me!” Derivation took pride in surviving the ordeal.

“Right, he only shattered your courage and turned you into a cowardly turtle.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Junior, you weren’t even born when we ruled over the epoch, a mere ant when we chose to withdraw into obscurity...” Derivation seemed sensitive to criticism.

“You speak as if you’re special when you didn’t dare to fart before Trinity Ancestor.” Li Qiye waved and interrupted him.

“You!” This seemed to hit a sore spot.

“To be honest, he didn’t care for your self-proclaimed greatest intelligence and wisdom in history, only considering you to be slightly clever, nothing more.” Li Qiye said leisurely.

Derivation was furious. He didn’t care about the opinion of ants but Trinity Ancestor was a different story. All of them were imperious and mighty yet he still viewed them with disdain. Unfortunately, they could do nothing in retaliation.

Others had no idea of this past but Li Qiye chose to reveal his insecurities.

He took a deep breath and uttered coldly: “So what? He still fled and returned like a dog, nothing to be proud of.”

Trinity’s failure allowed them to breathe a sigh of relief. They rejoiced at the battered form of the returnee and laughed at him due to the stark contrast of his past and present.

“Sure.” Li Qiye said: “But a runaway dog was still a hundred times better than your lot, always shaking with fear after a few tribulations and hiding in the depths of the river here. The holes must have been dug deep just in case of another strike while Trinity Ancestor understood and feared the villainous heaven yet he still tried. Although only his fallen soul returned after the defeat due to the futility of the endeavor, you all didn’t dare to try, your dao hearts crumbled long ago. Now, you live a borrowed life, waiting for the era to mature and reap the benefits when opportunities come knocking, what rights do you have to mock him?”

Derivation trembled with fear. When was the last time someone dared to speak to him like this?

He lost the calm and collected bearings of an overlord. Alas, he didn’t have any in the first place given his grotesque appearance.

Worst of all, Li Qiye merely spoke the truth. Despite Trinity’s failure, he was truly superior, whether it be his courage, dao heart, or anything else.

They buried this truth, internally and externally, to maintain their pride and arrogance. Li Qiye wasted no time in reopening the scars.

“Brat, how could you possibly understand? You were but a lowly ant born in our era, not worth mentioning in the slightest. Halt your foolish tongue.” Derivation was furious since Li Qiye deliberately targeted his insecurities.
