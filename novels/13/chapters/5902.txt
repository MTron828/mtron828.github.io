Chapter 5902: When Gazing At The Abyss

“How about it?” Li Qiye patted it again.

The cloud stared at him, becoming cautious again.

“Not this again, mistrusting your good friend. You can’t go on like this, your best option is to find a companion.” Li Qiye said: “I’m not going to trick you since there’s nothing in it for me. In fact, your safety only benefits me.”

The cloud thought that if Li Qiye had malicious intent, he would have acted way earlier instead of waiting until now.

It glanced up at the sky, still unwilling to make the trip.

“Scared of Heavenrealm?” Li Qiye nodded: “Yes, it is drastically more dangerous than this world. The strongest cultivators here are mere ants there, so if someone knows of your true uses, they will maneuver and capture you.”

The cloud didn’t appreciate being viewed as a helpless damsel and glared at Li Qiye.

“I’m not looking down on you, it’s just that those old geezers living virtually endlessly have some incredible methods and the right to be arrogant. I wonder if they will survive the sweep.” Li Qiye said.

The cloud glanced at the sky again, seemingly searching for the villainous heaven.

“It won’t be a problem, the strongest cultivators in history who call themselves true immortals still do not dare to underestimate the villainous heaven. It has plenty of ace cards, any of which can kill these true immortals or whatever.” Li Qiye smiled.

The cloud nodded again, having some insight into the villainous heaven’s arsenal.

“But certain things are different.” Li Qiye commented: “The deterrence has weakened so they became restless, aiming to make big moves.”

The cloud seemed to be snorting at the suicidal ideas.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Look at it this way, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that is appearing in this epoch, it’s unprecedented.” Li Qiye said: “The cycle of epochs was part of nature until now when everything becomes more complicated. The villainous heaven doesn’t want this to happen either, how could the emotionless tribulation emissary break from the mold and change?”

He couldn’t help but sigh as he continued: “This emissary is willing to just live in the mortal coil, enjoying absolute freedom even if it means being destroyed eventually.” [1]

The cloud listened attentively, appreciating the story while being a little confused.

“This is a trade-off that others might not understand. From the very start, destruction and creation stem from a single thought, all are ephemeral. However, when one takes the time to experience it, the mortal coil becomes different. A supreme master might ask, what’s the point in experiencing the life of ants? They have been sitting on their imperious throne for too long and suddenly, mortal life becomes interesting again if they bother to try. The villainous heaven doesn’t get it either, it is a child with a pure heart, when it doesn’t open its eyes, everything is part of its dreams.” Li Qiye elaborated.

The cloud nodded repeatedly.

“The same can’t be said about the tribulation emissary. Gazing at the abyss and the abyss gazes back, the same concept for the mortal world. It draws you in with its many colorful splendors and emotions. That’s why the emissary willingly abandoned its form and walked the mortal world, not forcing the issue and just following its heart, that alone is enough.” Li Qiye said.

The cloud felt a bit lost because this was something many existences couldn’t pursue, not even the villainous heaven. [2]

“This makes the emissary a winner as long as it doesn’t take the next step, it will always be a winner.” Li Qiye smiled [3]

“However, the old men up in Heavenrealm cared not about this aspect. They saw an opportunity and started planning, digging a hole for the villainous heaven to jump in.” Li Qiye continued.

The cloud snorted again, maintaining the same perspective.

“Who is digging the pit? That’s up for debate, both sides think they’re the one with the upper hand. The villainous heaven naturally can’t allow this, hence the avatars needing to do the dirty work.” Li Qiye said.

The cloud glanced deeper into the azure upon hearing this.

“The true self won’t show up without a fight, there’s no need to think about this.” Li Qiye shook his head in response.

The cloud thought about it and agreed. Otherwise, everything would have been rewritten long ago.

“But yes, this is a good opportunity with the tribulation emissary extinguished, a small gap is there. Therefore, the old men cannot wait any longer.” Li Qiye said.

The cloud recalled a common saying among mortals - strike while the iron is hot. The idea was sound.

“They are close to having an everlasting life but not quite. Their desire grows stronger and their patience wanes. This angered the high heaven, initiating the sweep.” Li Qiye said.

The cloud had a good idea of the events at this point.

“It’s good to sweep everything up at once instead of individually. Who knows if all of this was just a plan to draw out the snakes from their holes?” Li Qiye continued.

The cloud couldn’t help but stare at Li Qiye, implying something.

“I don’t know.” Li Qiye shrugged: “But this is just a minor trick. These methods are just clever schemes, not as effective as one might think. Don’t be fooled by the illusions and facades, they only give the challengers hope. In the end, it comes down to an actual fight, this is the crux of the matter.”

1. There is a new term, 报劫 - announce/inform/revenge + tribulation. From the limited context, I believe it is an entity but using emissary might be the wrong word if it turns out to not be a physical entity. All in all, this is a literal translation so it should be safe enough. ☜

2. I feel just as lost ☜

3. I’m using it instead of she/he because I can’t be sure of the sex. This applies to the high heaven too, it is both it and potentially him. There might have been some inconsistencies in it/him but both can be correct ☜
