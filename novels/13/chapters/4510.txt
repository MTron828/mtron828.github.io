Chapter 4511: 20,000,000,000

Turtle-seeker Ancestor had a direct disciple with exceptional talent. Wise had met the youth and praised him repeatedly, congratulating Turtle-seeker for having a capable successor.

The disciple didn’t let the seniors down. Everyone in the sect had high expectations of him.

Unfortunately, he wished for success and became impatient. Moreover, his cultivation soared too quickly without ample consolidation, resulting in qi deviation.

Alas, the seniors did everything they could to bring him back from the brink of destruction. They saved his life and dao foundation but ultimately, his cultivation and dao suffered damage.

For so long now, they tried everything to mend the damages. The countless pills only had tolerable results.

This secret auction gave Turtle-seeker hope because these fire dragon pills were the best of the best to treat qi deviation. If he could win, his disciple might actually be cured.

After deliberation, the sect decided to muster all of its resources to win the ten bottles. Though Archipelago was a major power after eras of accumulation, there was still a large gap between them and the behemoths.

Therefore, he could no longer afford to bid anything after 4,000,000,000. Doing so would have detrimental effects on Archipelago.

Moreover, they naturally had more than one disciple. To focus on a single youth was not something the ancestors wanted.

“I have some savings.” Wise decided to help his old friend.

“Brother Wu…” Turtle-seeker was deeply grateful because Wise was willing to let go of the other auctions.

“4,500,000,000.” He bid afterward despite not having that much confidence.

“4,600,000,000.” Cloudgrasp wanted to win for the monarch’s sake.

“4,700,000,000.” Alchemy Child had his own master in mind. This price was still acceptable for True Immortal.

“4,800,000,000.” A big shot from an ancient clan desired the pills as well. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“5,000,000,000.” Turtle-seeker made his final bid.

5,100,000,000.” Alchemy Child didn’t hesitate for a second.

“5,200,000,000.” Cloudgrasp followed right behind him.

The two friends exchanged glances and couldn’t go any higher.

“Another three hundred.” Wise gritted his teeth and put everything he had on the line.

“5,500,000,000.” Turtle-seeker said the words and felt a sense of freedom. This was truly the last-ditch attempt.

“5,600,000,000.” On the contrary, Cloudgrasp felt no pressure at all with another bid.

Turtle-seeker gave up, realizing that this was not meant to be. He cupped his fist and said: “Thank you, Brother. Archipelago will always remember the kindness shown here today.”

Though he failed to win, at least he found out that he had such a good friend.

“I’m sorry that I couldn’t help.” Wise sighed and said.

“6,000,000,000.” Meanwhile, Alchemy Child, Cloudgrasp Elder, and the big shot from an ancient clan continued their competition.

“10,000,000,000.” Someone else suddenly interrupted them with a casual tone.

“10,000,000,000!” Some participants gasped after hearing the bid.

“Another ten times the original price.” A few of them became exasperated since this was his second time breaking the implicit rule.

All the participants tried their best to keep the final price as low as possible. This was the logical thing to do, except there was a dissident in this case. They felt unsafe because he could do it whenever he wanted, especially during the auction with the item they desired.

Nonetheless, there was nothing they could do because his bids were guaranteed by the auction house.

“Don’t tell me he’s working for the auction to bring up the price.” One big shot murmured, feeling awfully suspicious.

After all, Li Qiye bid an amount that was ten times the original starting price. Moreover, the auction house gave him unlimited credit as well.

“Hey, you’re working for the auction house?!” The big shots cared about face and didn’t say this out loud but one youth questioned.

The former didn’t want to disrespect Grotto Courtyard but younger cultivators had no qualms. They could also be forgiven because of their ignorance.

“What do you think?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hard to say due to your suspicious bids.” Alchemy Child interjected.

“Then play along, I don’t mind participating in this auction. The highest bidder gets the item.” Li Qiye smiled.

Others exchanged glances while Cloudgrasp Elder felt the worst since he was a prior victim.

“10,100,000,000.” Alchemy Child didn’t think that Li Qiye would dare to go all the way.

“10,200,000,000.” Cloudgrasp tried to read Li Qiye to no avail and decided to continue.

“20,000,000,000.” Li Qiye didn’t think for a second.

This bid made the crowd gasp loudly. Even Wise and Turtle-seeker couldn’t believe it. This was far beyond the ten bottles’ value.

“Still want to play?” Li Qiye stared at the crowd with a focus on Alchemy Child and Cloudgrasp Elder.

The two of them thought that he was just messing around, not expecting him to actually double the bid again. This new bid was too much for their pockets.
