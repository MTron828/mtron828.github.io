Chapter 4678: Entering

The union was no stranger to cultivators from Sky Border. This went double for older members, especially ancestors nearing the end of their life.

Rumor has it that this was a conference that began in the olden days. There was no host; guests from all over the world simply gathered in one spot.

Nonetheless, it wasn’t available to everyone due to its sporadic appearance. There were no rules regarding time and place.

Many waited patiently in history. Some were rewarded and could finally participate; alas, many others couldn’t wait that long.

A number of ancient ancestors have participated in numerous events, relying on them for life prolongation.

The union allowed one to enter the dao source and model a grand dao from time antiquity. Thus, some cultivators wished that they could stay there forever.

The circumstances and manifestation of the gate changed each time. However, it has never appeared in a forbidden zone before.

Some speculated that the seven forbidden zones and the Primordial Union represented two different supreme forces left behind from an old epoch.

They couldn’t appear in the same place, akin to a mountain not having enough room for two tigers. This would result in a collision of terrible consequences.

They also couldn’t guess the victor but today, the result became clear. Worldbreaker has utterly lost to the Primordial Union but this was quickly forgotten. The crowd focused on the gate instead.

As mentioned previously, the gate seemed to be built at the bottom of a great tree and carved from its roots. Therefore, a great life force surrounded it.

“It’s here…” An ancestor became emotional.

Experts immediately sent news back to their sect: “Tell the ancient ancestors now, the Primordial Union is beginning!”

Bright rays shot out of Worldbreaker and headed for all corners of the world.

Gongs and ringings could be heard in various powers. This was to wake up their slumbering ancient ancestors.

“The Primordial Union?” One ancient ancestor immediately went on the move.

Many beings in the abyss located in Inner Ruins gazed at the gate. Their wondrous eyes could pierce through it to see the core of the dao beyond…

Obtaining this dao source might be enough for them to live another life. No one could resist this temptation. Of course, they have lived long enough to learn patience since this thing wasn’t meant for them. Forcing the issue would not end well.

“Boom!” A golden brilliance suddenly broke through a seal. Loud cracks could be heard by everyone.

“Damn, the emperor broke out!” An expert from Divine Dragon shouted.

However, it was too late for them to react. The emperor soared upward like a dragon and leaped into the gate.

It recognized him and allowed entry, making it difficult for the alliance to pursue.

The ancient ancestors didn’t give the command. Being hasty didn’t necessarily mean success. As long as he was in there, they still had a chance.

“That was so close…” A member of Five-sun complained.

Initially, they found and surrounded him. Alas, he was mighty on top of having the gemstone. Their ancient ancestors didn’t push him to the edge, afraid of him going all out. Therefore, they chose to slowly wear him down instead.

Unfortunately, the emergence of the Primordial Union distracted them. This gave him enough time to escape.

“Let’s enter.” One ancestor calmed down and said.

“I don’t think the young generation can go, right?” A junior quietly asked while staring at the gate.

“To be more exact, the union refuses weak cultivators, it has nothing to do with age. Many geniuses have entered before.” The ancestor responded: “It’s fine, I’ll bring you all inside.”

The junior became excited to hear this.

“Dao Brother, the emperor is gone, looks like we don’t need to fight.” Five-sun King cupped his fist since the alliance no longer needed to seal the mountain.

Having said that, he left with his fellow sect members to the disappointment of the crowd. It looked like they needed to wait longer before the dao lord competition.

However, they didn’t have time to waste. The upper echelon of each sect prepared to enter the gate.

The alliance also made preparation. Unlike the great legions, the top members selected their most elite members and geniuses.

There was a limit to how many cultivators an ancestor could bring along. Therefore, they had to choose carefully. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“This is a chance for everlasting life.” One ancestor took a deep breath and decided to go alone.

“Stop fantasizing, we just need to prolong our lifespan.” His friend in the same sect said.

Beyond the gate were many chances for these ancestors to prolong their life.
