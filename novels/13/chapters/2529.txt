Li Qiye stood there calmly against the torrential downpour of swords, treating it like a drizzle.

“Clank!” The swords aimed at him in an orderly fashion, wishing to blow him into smithereens.

They were inches from him yet he still wore a smile on his face.

In this split second, he gently shot out something. The world quaked and space became crushed along with all of the swords. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They seemed fragile and collapsed into specks of dust, resulting in a rain of golden powders. One could hear their falling clatters.

“So strong!” The crowd gasped at the dominating sight - he destroyed countless swords with such ease.

They glanced at each other, thinking that the king’s power had no worldly bounds, far superior to any other affinity.

“Clank.” A gigantic sword materialized within the domain. The mountain range also lit up with bright rays from every peak. These sword energies exuded a divine presence and immense force.

The rays eventually gathered on the great sword. It didn’t take long before what seems to be all the lights in the world has accumulated on its blade in a blinding manner. The sword itself seemed to be giving birth to a world.

“Clank!” A world-tearing resonation crossed the air. The ground started cracking in multiple places; the spatial area nearby shattered as well.

This resonation alone could instantly turn a True God into nothingness. Its powerful sword energy could take down devils and fiends - quite an incredible power.

“Clank!” Another resonation resounded. The sound turned into a murderous vertical slash with an unstoppable sharpness.

It had locked onto Li Qiye and would find him even if he was a billion miles away. There was no escaping.

It was sharp enough to cut through the firmest defensive line in this world. Stars to pieces; the earth lacerated; yin yang and the five elements were severed; karma and cycles faced destruction.

The gods would tremble before this murderous and bloodthirsty slash. One could easily imagine the gods being decapitated, their heads flying in the air.

The spectators naturally shuddered, scared out of their mind.

“Weak.” Li Qiye smirked and casually raised his hand to stop the slash.

This naturally astounded the crowd since not even the toughest defense might be able to block it.

The strongest treasure of an Ascender would still be cut into two halves. Li Qiye’s frivolity stunned the crowd. Was he tired of living?

Stopping this slash with one’s bare hand was suicidal. Everyone could see the outcome - blood would gush from his severed arm. Even his body might be separated.

“Clank!” Unfortunately, nothing of that sort occurred.

Li Qiye’s hand firmly stopped the gigantic sword. It seemed to be the toughest metal in existence, untouched by the sharp blade. Only sparks came out of the impact point.

What more could the crowd say? This person came out unscathed before a direct strike. His flesh seemed to be tougher than metal.

They gasped in response. Not to mention Ascenders, Eight Formation True Emperor himself wouldn’t try to stop that slash with his flesh. Doing so would result in dismemberment.

The spectators couldn’t believe their own eyes. They wondered what his flesh was made of.

“I told you that I was only playing around with everyone earlier. To actually think that you can hurt me.” Li Qiye shook his head and twisted his hand.

“Crack!” The gigantic sword got snapped like a dried branch despite wielding the power of Nine-linked Mountains.

That slash just now consisted of Eight Formation True Emperor’s power, the force of the entire formation, and even a part of Nine Secrets System’s power. Alas, Li Qiye still shocked the crowd by defeating it.

“My turn.” He smiled, slowly making a fist.

As the fist started forming, the crowd felt an intense pressure. Though it didn’t carry a shocking or immense power, they still froze as if he had their heart in his grasp.

The clearer the shape of the fist, the more people stopped breathing as if there was an invisible hand seizing their throat. Opening their mouth wide didn’t get them any air either.

They had the illusion that he had the entire world in his palm. It couldn’t handle a single blow from him.

“Boom!” He finally unleashed his apocalyptic punch.

All back to dust - the only words that the crowd could use to describe this incredible technique.

“Go!” The voice of the emperor resounded.

“Clank!” Eighty-one great swords emerged instantly. They turned into the origin and slashed down in unison, creating a net of sword energy. This would last forever since they have created an independent cycle.

They carried a supreme intent seemed to be that of nature itself - the power of a true ruler. No one could withstand this force while being inside this domain.

“Origin First Strike, the formation’s real moves are coming.” A member of the crowd shouted with horror.

“Boom!” Alas, this supreme power and ruler’s intent still couldn’t do anything before Li Qiye’s punch.

“Rumble!” The eighty-one swords instantly collapsed along with their origin force.

They only appeared to be supreme on the outside, not possessing real force and couldn’t reach the apex.

The first continued to break through space in an unrelenting manner. It pierced through the entire sword domain and reached the deepest location.

The moment it made its way to the entrance in the sky, numerous layers of swords appeared to build the most resilient defense in the world - virtually impossible to penetrate.

Unfortunately again, Li Qiye’s punch easily pierced through the multiple layers.

They all shattered into golden powders and started scattering to the ground.

This scene naturally shocked the crowd to the core.
