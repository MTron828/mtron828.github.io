Chapter 4719: Dao Lord Bloodline

“Please give me pointers.” Shen Juntian slowly floated upward.

Li Qiye remained calm in the face of a dao lord weapon as if it wasn’t a threat.

“Start.” Li Qiye waved his hand again and didn’t assume a defensive pose.

Juntian took a deep breath. Others might find this nonchalant attitude insulting but he didn’t.

“Dao Brother, do you have a weapon?” He asked.

“Since you insist, I’ll pick a random one then.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Clank!” Li Qiye raise his hand and dao laws appeared in the air.

He reached forward and they twisted together to form a long sword of an ashen color. It looked inconspicuous but brimmed with sword energy.

It wasn’t a biting and painful energy. Nonetheless, the strands could reach the heart and had an exceedingly strong grand dao presence.

To be exact, the strands contained the mysteries of the sword dao. Those sensing them became immersed in comprehension and enlightenment.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

This was akin to scholars catching a whiff of the fragrance found in a library emanating from the scrolls. They would want to start reading right away.

In this case, cultivators took a deep breath and gained the presence of the sword dao. Their heart beat faster afterward.

The result was different depending on the individual. One saw ten thousand swords soaring to the heaven. Another sensed one sword breaking through the void. One more imagined a divine sword suppressing history itself…

“Magnificent.” The non-sword dao users still praised the energy strands.

“There’s a smell to the sword dao?” An expert found this surprising.

Taking in the energy strands and the accompanied fragrance was akin to learning the mysteries of the sword dao.

“No, but this is the legendary charm of the grand dao. Some try their whole life to reach this level yet Li Qiye is so attuned to the dao.” A sword king said.

Listeners became emotional. Some haven’t reached this level yet but still could understand the implications.

This was a new experience for them - Li Qiye turning dao laws into a sword in just a few seconds. Imbuing the dao into a weapon was an arduous process yet Li Qiye made it look easy.

“Using the dao as a sword.” Shen Juntian couldn’t help but praise: “Your mastery of the dao is second nature at this point.”

“Make your move.” Li Qiye chuckled and pointed his gray sword at the opponent. He seemed confident that he was the grand dao itself; his sword was capable of overcoming all obstacles.

“Buzz.” Juntian’s trident became resplendent and its dao lord aura erupted, torturing the crowd with unbearable pressure.

“Rumble!” His vitality and energy exploded. His supreme grand dao - Divine Song - intensified even though he wasn’t actively chanting. Numerous gods chanted instead and made listeners drop to the ground, fully converted.

A dao source appeared in his radiant true fate. This new state made his true fate far larger than before.

“Emperor!” The gigantic gods started walking toward Juntian who was becoming brighter and brighter.

The dao source inside his true fate was drowning in chaos true energy. The amount was enough to engulf the whole world.

The terrifying aura of an heir manifested into reality and took the form of a heavenly wheel capable of crushing both grand mountains and bottomless oceans.

He has fully activated his grand dao and gained more power than ever before from the illusory gods.

His improved battle prowess left the crowd in awe.

“Just his supreme grand dao alone can crush some ancient ancestors.” An ancient ancestor observed from a distance.

Next came the gathering of his true blood. This resulted in a deafening blast. A majestic figure made from his blood appeared behind him - a being greater than the stars. Gods and devils had to prostrate before this ruler; the myriad dao were subjected to his reign.

The subsequent dao lord aura broke through the sky vault. Even the strongest character thought about retreating.

“Dao Lord!” Cultivators dropped down to their knees. Some ancestors capable of withstanding the pressure did the same in order to show respect.

“That’s the effect of the bloodline.” An ancient ancestor became startled because it was as if a dao lord was here in person. The might of Eight-stallion Dao Lord seemed unstoppable.

“This is the ultimate profundity of the bloodline.” Another top cultivator gasped.
