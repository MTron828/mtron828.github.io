Chapter 4241: Avarice

As greed took over, the unreasonable request became reasonable in the crowd’s mind. They knew that robbing him was impossible, given their power. The duo was the only chance.

“Finality is a gift from heaven. Sharing it with the world is an immeasurable contribution to humanity.” Vastsea spoke: “Fellow Daoist, this choice of yours can prosper Sword Continent for years to come. You’ll be the most celebrated figure in history.”

The vajra also chimed in, acting as if he cared about others: “Right, if I had it, I would share it with everyone. That’s our responsibility, a way to strengthen the legacy of the sword dao in our continent.”

They changed the narrative and sounded like masters wanting the best for mankind. After all, it would be improper for overlords like them to demand Li Qiye’s personal item. Big shots like them couldn’t act like bandits.

On the other hand, shifting the narrative into helping Sword Continent made it acceptable and actually boosted their reputation. The end result was the same; only the justification was different.

“Senior Vajra is too kind.” An expert loudly shouted: “Yes, Finality Scripture should be public knowledge for the sake of our continent.”

“That’s right.” Cheers erupted as others repeated the same sentiment.

“Finality should belong to everyone, not a single person! It is the source of all the sword dao so anyone who attempts to monopolize it will be the enemy!”

“You’re perfectly right! Anyone who attempts to monopolize the scripture is the enemy!”

It didn’t take long for them to claim that Li Qiye’s scripture was public property.

“How pitiful.” Li Qiye looked at them and said: “Greed is driving you all crazy and clouding your conscience. Cultivating ten thousand years hasn’t been enough to cure stupidity.”

He then turned his sight towards Vastsea and Earthraiser, still with a smile on his face: “The so-called overlords are nothing more than sordid merchants, utterly disappointing.”

The duo turned red after the insult but refrained from acting out. They already had a plan and it was going perfectly.

As for the rowdy crowd, embarrassment turned into rage.

“Li Qiye, your greed is disgraceful and detrimental to society!” One expert shouted.

“Your path will lead to certain destruction, be smart and hand Finality over or you will die without a grave!” One more shrieked.

“Everyone in the world won’t let this stand!” Li Qiye became the enemy in no time at all.

He smiled and gazed at the greedy cultivators then said: “Is that so? Doesn’t sound bad at all. Come, I don’t mind killing anyone who harbors this thought.”

“Kill him!” An offended cultivator shouted.

“Kill him!” The crowd chanted as if wanting to cut him to pieces.

Of course, they might be screaming for blood but none was stupid enough to actually attack Li Qiye. They knew that only the overlords had a chance of subduing him.

“If you insist on being stubborn, Fellow Daoist, then I shall put my old bones to good use for the sake of Sword Continent.” Earthraiser said: “I hope you’ll share the scripture because it belongs to the entire continent.”

“Yes, Sea Emperor believes in the same ideal and will support you, Brother.” The venerable found that the time was right and added: “Whoever stands by our side will be given a copy of Finality Scripture.”

Hearts started beating faster right away. Everyone knew that it was impossible to learn or memorize the scripture in a short time. However, to have access to a copy? This was akin to possessing all nine sword dao.

Greed already had a firm grasp on them so it became even more irresistible.

“Sun-moon School stands with Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel in our aspiration to improve Sword Continent.” A sect master stepped forward and said.

“Benevolence will lend our strength to the continent.” A golem ancestor joined in.

“Aquatic Kingdom stands with Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel!” An old king loudly declared.

Numerous sects revealed their attitude and chose the side of Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel. They wanted a piece of the pie - a copy of Finality. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, the neutral parties exchanged glances. They would be lying to themselves if they claim to not want a copy.

However, this was a blatant robbery, an immoral and despicable act. Some of them didn’t wish to get their hands dirty.

“Sword Temple stands with the young noble. Get through me first before thinking about Finality.” Everlasting Sword God declared.

Her voice wasn’t loud but everyone heard her clearly. The third overlord had taken the side of Li Qiye.

“Hallowed City is on your side, Young Noble.” Hallowed City Lord calmly stated.

“You have our swords, Young Noble.” Tie Jian spoke on behalf of the sword ground. Ling Jian didn’t oppose this either.

“Wooden Sword Kingdom is at your command, Young Noble.” Poplar Paragon laughed heartily.

“The same with Armament Mountain.” Shi Yingxue revealed her stance.

“Count us in as well.” Nine-sun Sword Saint spoke for Virtuous School.

“We humbly ask for the chance to contribute.” Flame Valley Lord also picked Li Qiye’s side.

“Heaven Silkworm obeys you, Young Noble.” Dong Ling stepped forward and said.

A rift appeared in Sword Continent between two powerful factions - the alliance of Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel versus Li Qiye and his followers.
