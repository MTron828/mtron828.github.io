Chapter 5226: Recall Your Power

“Boom!” A divine mountain seemed to be manifesting into reality and suffocated the audience.

This aura came from a middle-aged man wearing a crest. Waterfalls of imperial energy poured down around him; visual phenomena could be seen in the back. His very presence deterred the dao and forced others into submission. The opening of his eyes could change the rhythm and flow of the world.

“Suppression Conqueror!” Some shouted his title as they looked up at him in awe.

Though far from the strongest, he was still dominating enough to take over Imperial Attendant City.

Resplendent Monarch scowled after seeing him. Unfortunately, he was just stronger than any of them.

“Conqueror, recall your power." Boss Tang demanded.

“My apology.” Suppression sat down and hid his aura. Nonetheless, others still feared and respected this legendary character for his ferocity and decisiveness.

He once had a terrible relationship with other sects because of his fiery temper during his youth. Thus, everyone including the alliances denied his request to join.

Only Hundred Dao accepted him and he didn’t let them down. One could say that the tides were always changing - the undesirable youth turning into a dominant conqueror. Today, it was time for him to oppress the powers who didn’t appreciate him.

Thus, some believed that his taking over Imperial Gate was a type of revenge. After all, Alchemy Dao, Qilin Manor, and many others rejected him once. Of course, he himself had never stated his intention.

Moreover, he still hasn’t crossed certain lines when dealing with Imperial Gate.

“Great, I’m not late.” Another middle-aged man appeared and cupped his fist toward the group, not looking arrogant in the slightest.

He was a swordsman with a friendly aura, wearing a cowl and looking inconspicuous with the exception of his bright eyes.

The three geniuses and Suppression Conqueror got up to return the gesture.

“Long time no see, Brother Skysword.” Suppression was courteous toward the man.

“So that’s Skyword Dao Lord! The leader of Dao Alliance.” An expert told his friends.

“Isn’t it All-things Dao Lord?” A friend said quietly.

“Yes, in position but All-things Dao Lord is usually away while Skysword Dao Lord deals with administration and other matters. He is very well respected.” The expert explained.

The group took a good look at him. Another said: “He doesn’t look like a supreme dao lord.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“That is his unique charm.” A big shot joined in: “He’s very sincere and trustworthy during his travel, respected by both friends and foes.”

“Really?” Someone said.

“There were rifts in Dao Alliance ever since Illumination Conqueror’s abdication. Skysword Dao Lord is the one holding them together.” The big shot whispered.

The group exchanged glances and didn’t dwell on this sensitive matter regarding Dao Alliance.

Nonetheless, this issue was highly speculated by others. Some believed that Dao Alliance was on the verge of separating during that period.

Later on, All-things Dao Lord became the guardian and with the assistance of Skysword Dao Lord, Dao Alliance was unified once more.

After Skysword Dao Lord sat down, the next to arrive was a gray-haired old man. His eyes still brimmed with wisdom and youthfulness, seemingly capable of understanding everything in the world.

Unlike Suppression Conqueror, he kept his aura at a minimum. Nonetheless, the grand dao still harmonized around him.

“Omniscient.” Skysword stood up, the same with the others. Even Jue Xian’er took a look at the old man.

“Ladies and gentlemen.” Omniscient cupped his fist before sitting down on the throne belonging to Cleansing Incense Dynasty.

“Why is Omniscient Dao Lord representing Cleansing Incense Dynasty, he’s not from there.” A crowd member became curious.

“He has always been a guest there, maybe he finally joined it.” A big shot said.

He was not the strongest among the emperors and dao lords. However, he seemed to know everything. Not to mention regular cultivators, even apex cultivators sought him out with questions. Rumor has it that he was privy to all secrets.

He preferred traveling the world instead of joining a particular faction. Alas, his appearance now implied his allegiance to Cleansing Incense Dynasty.

“The dynasty has been hiding its edge, perhaps this is a scouting attempt for the future.” One dragon lord whispered.

Everyone maintained caution when talking about this sect. It had dominated starting from Immemorial Epoch War all the way to Grand Dao War.

Putting its power aside, it seemed to have deep ties with Imperial Field from the immortal continent. This was the reason why Genesis Conqueror started Imperial Alliance in the upper continents.

Though the dynasty was no longer in charge of the alliance, its prestige still remained.
