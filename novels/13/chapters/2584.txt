“Let the past be the past. The ancestral legacy can’t be defended. As long as you’re capable, rebuilding is always a possibility and not a bad choice.” Li Qiye advised.

Youzheng smiled awkwardly: “Young Noble, please don’t laugh, but we have no abilities to speak of and can’t replicate the task of our ancestors. I’m only wishing for enough luck that our estate will survive the disaster.”

He sighed and continued with a bitter smile: “I won’t live for much longer now and will return to the soil. While I still have some breaths remaining, I might as well try my best for future descendants and die without regrets. Plus, dying at home is all I can ask for.”

More often than not, it was a luxury for a displaced man to die and be buried in their homeland.

Li Qiye didn’t respond.

“But this child is so stubborn. The more I say no, the more she wants to return, only to die...” Youzheng looked over at Yixue and helplessly said.

“Master.” She stared at the ground instead: “This is my home too, I want to stay... I’m not afraid of death if it’s here.”

“Silly girl, you are still young with numerous opportunities in the future.” Youzheng shook his head.

The girl remained quiet. She was someone who would never change her mind after making a decision.

“Mingluo City is no longer yours.” Li Qiye said flatly: “Forget about defending your inheritance because if people want to take it, they can annihilate you with a single finger.”

Youzheng knew that Li Qiye was telling the truth so he had no response.

In fact, he was startled earlier, thinking that he came to the wrong place. Mingluo has become so lively all of a sudden with numerous members of the big systems.

These experts consisted of True Gods at the very least with no lack of Ascenders. He felt his scalp tingling as a result.

It wasn’t hard for them to take over his sect. Those powerful Ascenders could kill him with ease.

“Stay here for now instead of suiciding outside.” Li Qiye commanded.

The two had a surprised expression, not expecting him to actually take them in. After all, he has already shown enough mercy by saving their sect earlier. They were nothing but strangers.

“Thank you, Young Noble.” The two bowed again. Yixue was especially ecstatic and stole glances at him, albeit with reservation.

Just being able to stay in the city was more than enough for her despite the rains and winds in this place. Of course, they decided to build a tiny wooden house instead, a temporary abode for the three.

Having a roof didn’t matter to Li Qiye. If he wanted to, he could have modified the terrain to establish a great palace.

Yixue was happy to have this wooden house and did a perfect job cleaning the place. She even decorated it with some flowers to make it presentable.

“Young Noble, why are these great powers here?” Youzheng asked inside the house, unable to restrain his curiosity.

He found Li Qiye rather easy to get along with despite his brutality in battle.

“Are the rumors about treasures true?” He heard these rumors while coming back and even saw cultivators excavating in his sect’s territory.

“Do you think there is a hidden treasure grove here?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Well...” Youzheng contemplated before answering: “Even if the city had any, it would have been taken away generations ago.”

Stone Harmony has been declining for a long time. Cultivators in the past have excavated this entire place. Anything worthwhile had been taken long ago; nothing is left for them.

This was a reason why the top merit laws and weapons of Stone Harmony all disappeared. When the big sects wanted to leave this system, they either took these items along or auctioned them away.

The only thing left behind for future generations was the withered land.

“A few things aren’t that easy to take away.” Li Qiye smiled. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hmm? The dao source?” Youzheng knew more than others because he was a top expert in this place.

“We still have a dao source?” Yixue was surprised since she thought that it had disappeared long ago.

“Yes.” Youzheng nodded and said seriously: “The dao source is still here, we just don’t know where it is. I and several True Gods have discussed this matter before. If there’s no dao source, the system would have crumbled long ago to Myriad Lineage yet it is still here. This shows that the dao source is still around. It’s a shame we can’t find it.”

“It’s not the dao source, just heavily related.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Are you here for this thing too, Young Noble?” Youzheng blurted before rephrasing: “No, you’re here for the evil thing underground.”

Li Qiye had talked about chasing an evil entity here so it was disrespectful implying that he was here for treasures.

“It’s no secret, I am indeed here for both.” Li Qiye said.

Youzheng smiled wryly with an awkward expression.

“Is it a supreme treasure?” Yixue stole a glance at him.

“Depends, it could also cause a disaster. That’s why your system declined in just one night despite having an intact dao source.” Li Qiye replied.

“The evil thing is here for it too?” Youzheng was shaken: “No, that can’t be. It was probably here a long time ago and was probably the cause of our decline. Now it’s back again for this thing?”

He had researched this before so he immediately understood after receiving some hints from Li Qiye.

“That’s one way to put it.” Li Qiye nodded.

Youzheng continued: “Will you be able to eliminate it, Young Noble?”

“It’ll be a problem if I can’t, not only to Stone Harmony but the rest of Imperial. A big problem.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s that scary?” Youzheng felt a chill.

“It doesn’t belong to this world.” Li Qiye spoke while staring towards the horizon.

“But if, if you can get rid of it, doesn’t that mean... that our dao source will be restored?” Youzheng suddenly realized something and became ecstatic inside. This was great news for their system.

“Yes, your system will soar again with majestic grand dao returning, a new breath of life and great prosperity.” Li Qiye stated.

“Really!” The elated old man got on the ground: “Young Noble, if you take care of this evil thing, you’ll be the greatest benefactor in the history of Stone Harmony. The system will worship you for ages to come.”

“Don’t be so quick to thank me. If this doesn’t go well, just one wrong move will turn your system to ashes.” Li Qiye sat in his chair and said.

Youzheng felt as if someone had just poured cold water on his head. Nevertheless, he remained spirited while still bowing: “But at least there is hope. Stone Harmony can’t escape destruction while going down this path anyway.”

“You are very optimistic.” Li Qiye chuckled.
