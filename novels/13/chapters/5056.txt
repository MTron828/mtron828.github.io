Chapter 5057: Palms Stained With Blood

Golden Mosquito, one of the six founder gods revered by countless worshippers, had survived for eras. Now, he was being dominated by Li Qiye.

His needle was not only his mouth but also his weapon. It was certainly tougher than dragon lord weapons and should be on the same level as dao lord weapons.

He climbed out of the mud, looking as pitiful as can be like a stray dog. Blood spilled from the cracks of his golden carapace.

No one questioned his strength either since he easily drained Bloodfly to death. Alas, if Li Qiye had kept on going, he might have been killed.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“D-do you know who I am?!” The wounded founder god was both furious and frightened.

He was once a supreme genius who managed to start his own deity branch. After escaping the seal, he had plans of eliminating the other branches in order to obtain all of Demon’s worshipping power.

He was ready to become the only god of Demon, garnering enough power to attack the divine nest and kill the old geezers. The outside world would also be within reach.

This was the first phase of his majestic plan. Everything was going to plan until Li Qiye came out of nowhere and ruined it all.

Years of waiting only to fail made him furious, wanting nothing more than to devour Li Qiye’s flesh and gnaw on his bones.

“Raa!” He roared and activated the power of worship in its entirety.

His personal tablet appeared and flashed red as if it had been stained with blood in a creepy manner.

The deity seal representing Bug became resplendent and exuded dao runes. They came together and formed actual divine characters. Waves poured out and engulfed all of Demon.

“Deliver your power to my deity branch, now!” He shouted.

The characters soared into the air and turned into a constantly revolving dao maelstrom.

All the animals and demons under Bug in Demon lost control and their powers soared toward the maelstrom. It served as an ocean capable of absorbing endless power. He became increasingly larger; just one foot was as large as a mountain range. The cracked golden shell healed again and was thicker than before.

“All mine, all mine!” He was far from satisfied with this much power and channeled his divine tablet.

When it illuminated the world with its red glow, screams could be heard from the members of Bug. Their blood broke out of their body and was sucked up by Golden Mosquito. Streams of blood came from all conceivable directions and scared the hell out of spectators.

“Why pick this incorrect path out of so many choices? How disgusting.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I’m ending this.”

He raised his hand and the sky suddenly turned dark due to a gigantic palm manifesting in the air.

When he pushed it down, everything beneath became nothing. Cultivators perceived as the best in the world were insignificant in comparison.

“Blood Exterminate!” Golden Mosquito roared and sent all of his gathered blood against the palm. They exploded and could destroy the galaxy above.

However, the blood explosions were useless and the palm kept on descending.

“Nooo!” The invincible founder god was nothing more than a mosquito before Li Qiye.

“Pop!” This was akin to a mortal killing a mosquito with clapping hands. When they pulled their palms apart, they could see a smudge of blood. This was the end of Golden Mosquito’s grand ambition.

It didn’t matter that he had the power of countless animals and demons. He never expected to die so early and especially not in this pathetic manner.
