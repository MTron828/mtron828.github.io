Chapter 5184: Burning

“I don’t think our sect will agree to this.” She said softly, stating the obvious.

Not to mention an outsider, even their ancestor couldn’t just take a flower.

“I didn’t say I was asking for permission.” Li Qiye smiled.

“...” She became worried after hearing this since this left her in a tough situation. Nonetheless, she felt the urge to help him.

“Let me report this to my master. If she refuses, there is nothing else I can do because the flowers are priceless.” She said weakly.

“That’s fine, I’m in no hurry.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Then will you stay at our Alchemy Dao during the wait, Young Noble?” She asked bashfully while stealing glances at him.

“Yes.” Li Qiye agreed since he had time to stay in the city.

She was awfully pleased since they could spend more time together. The more she thought about it, the shyer she became and didn’t dare to look in his direction.

As they were walking, he stopped to look at a statue leading to stone steps. It depicted a woman that was remarkably lifelike - elegant and beautiful like a jade lotus in a secluded valley.

Though she was far from being a kingdom-toppling beauty, she could captivate viewers with a long-lasting charm.

Her dress flowed gracefully while she held a lotus flower in her hand, looking like a fairy treading on the mortal realm. She seemed to be gazing into the horizon, perhaps reflecting on the past or awaiting the return of a certain traveler.

Li Qiye observed the statue in silence and transcended time and space, returning to the past once more. Everything was vivid and clear as if it was just yesterday. Her soft and elegant voice echoed in his mind.

“This is our founder.” She let him take his time before introducing the statue.

“So lifelike and vibrant.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

“The six continents have other statues of our founder but none is as lifelike as this one here.” The saintess said.

Li Qiye didn’t answer, feeling as if the girl from the past was actually there. Everything had changed - she gained incredible fame as Heavenly Sage Yuan. Alas, they could no longer see each other.

Shao Yao stood there in a daze. For some unknown reason, she got the strange idea that Li Qiye knew the founder.

His eyes were so profound, seemingly lost in memories. They were immensely charismatic and captivating, capable of drawing souls closer…

She calmed down and realized how flustered she was, not daring to let him see her red complexion.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye let out a sigh and told her.

She followed quietly behind him, making it look like this was his home instead.

“Senior Sister, we have a problem!” A disciple rushed over and interrupted their time together.

“What is it? Take your time.” Shao Yao wasn’t just a young girl lost in infatuation. When there was a matter concerning the sect, she regained her composure and became serious.

“Our garden is burning again.” The disciple anxiously said.

“Again?” Her expression soured as she wanted to leave. Alas, she has yet to prepare a place for Li Qiye so she stared at him.

“Let’s go take a look.” He smiled and said.

She heaved a sigh of relief and appreciated his gesture. The two of them went to the troubled area.

As the direct disciple of Jadecure Conqueror and a potential successor, she was responsible for many tasks in Alchemy Dao.

She was also in charge of a garden with precious medicines of at least 100,000 years of age, reserved for the ancestors.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

For some unknown reason, this garden has been burning recently with heavy losses. She couldn’t find the reason and thought that it might be arson. Alas, there was no evidence.

Once the two arrived on the scene, they saw flames soaring into the sky and intertwining to form a strange pattern. Disciples of Alchemy Dao tried to extinguish them to no avail.

“Extinguish!” She saw a few plants burning and let out a shout while forming a mudra. A seal descended with dao power and stopped the flames.

“Heat stagnation!” Miracle Saint Child appeared and also used a seal to stop the spread of the flames.

The two of them worked together and managed to extinguish the fire. Unfortunately, seven or eight plants have been lost.

Her expression darkened since this had happened repeatedly under her watch.

“Junior Sister, what is happening? This garden is for the ancestors and you know how much they need the plants. How are we going to answer for this?” The saint child uttered coldly.

This development was indeed unfavorable for her since they were competing for the successor spot.

“I will report to the ancestors and take responsibility.” She responded.

“This happened too many times already.” The saint child pressed on: “This is absolutely arson but the issue is that your people are being careless and irresponsible.”

The disciples in charge of the garden became alarmed since they could face serious punishment.

“What happened here?” An old man rushed over. He had a treasure gourd hanging on his waist and wore straw sandals.

He had shining amber-like eyes while exuding a formidable aura - clearly a capable cultivator.

“Junior Uncle.” Both the saint child and saintess bowed.

He was the junior brother of Jadecure Conqueror and a famous ancestor of the sect - Gourdkeeper Monarch.

“Shao Yao, I know you are excellent at farming, not to mention being educated in our techniques. Why are these mistakes happening?” He frowned.

“It is my fault.” She bowed and took no responsibility.

She had ordered fellow disciples to guard the garden carefully but it still happened again.

“In my opinion, Junior Sister’s group must have neglected their duties and left their post without permission.” The saint child said, kicking a horse while it’s down.

“Ancestor, we have diligently maintained our post, whether it be day or night.” One disciple turned pale.
