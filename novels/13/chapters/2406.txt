“Xsh, Xsh...” The two Longevity Trees fused together; the parts matched perfectly.

“So it was only an incomplete part...” The sage was shocked to see this scene.

Back in the olden days, their progenitor also came up with this conjecture. Unfortunately, the progenitor never got the chance to see the main tree so it ended at the hypothetical stage.

Today, the sage realized that their progenitor was right. What a shame that the progenitor couldn’t be here to see this.

After the complete fusion, a perfect Longevity Tree finally appeared before them.

“Buzz.” It released both immortal rays and dao laws. These strands of dao laws were as thin as a silk string. However, upon closer inspection, there were faint blobs of light everywhere. The laws consisted of unbelievably tiny worlds stringed together in a line.

A totem emerged, the opening of a majestic world with countless creatures living in boundless land for eternity.

The tree didn’t need to try; just its image alone was enough to shock the heart. No other trees could compare to it.

“Is this the real Longevity Tree?” The sage eventually asked after calming down.

“Its name is Three Immortals Tree.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

Li Qiye used to call it Longevity Tree but after entering the final level of Bewildering Palace, he understood the mysteries of the tree’s origin and found out its real name.

“Three Immortals Tree?” She repeated this name before looking at the emerged totems on the tree, seemingly opening a great world.

“That’s Three Immortals World?” She became startled.

“Correct.” Li Qiye’s eyes became profound: “Even a frog under the well can see all of Three Immortals through it.”

“So it is deeply related to our worlds?” The sage asked again.

“Not just related.” Li Qiye smiled: “The tree doesn’t only pertain to longevity. In fact, longevity is but one aspect of it. It has the same origin as Three Immortals World, that’s why it is supreme, unique, and eternal.”

“I see...”

Though this tree has been here in her sect all this time, they, including their progenitor, have never been able to figure out its true mysteries.

To a certain extent, the biggest use of this tree was its leaves for pill making. Of course, these few leaves contained a massive amount of power.

Li Qiye raised his hand and the tree started leaving the ground and floated onto his palm. Even an idiot could tell that this was an incredible tree.

“Where will you plant it?” She asked.

“It’s very hard to find a suitable field for it in all of Three Immortals.” Li Qiye focused across time and space; his mind seemed to be wandering in the void.

After a while, he withdrew his gaze and started leaving. The sage followed right behind him.

The two took their time enjoying this rare moment. After a while, she looked at him and said: “I know someone who has a method to reach Imperial.”

Ascension wasn’t simple for the inhabitants of Myriad. One needed to be an Eternal or a True Emperor before thinking about it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Only those strong enough could force their way up. Of course, it was much easier if there were people up in Imperial to help. For example, the Mu Clan was ready to accept Mu Shaochen, so it wasn’t especially hard to get him back up there.

There was another way. A few powerful systems have methods left behind by their progenitors who have traveled across all three worlds before.

Because of these methods, those weaker than Eternals and True Emperors have reached Imperial. Of course, the necessary resources for this task were insane. They wouldn’t do so unless there was no other way.

Given Li Qiye’s strength, forcing his way up was no problem - only a matter of wasted time. If there was an available method, then he could go up there even faster.

“Let’s have a look then.” Li Qiye smiled and didn’t mind too much. Forcefully go up or using the back entrance didn’t affect him.

“I’ll go ask then.” She hesitated for a moment before grabbing his hand for a long while before slowly letting go. Time went by slowly as if a century had passed.

Li Qiye was going to leave Longevity Valley. The girls didn’t want him to leave at all.

Their eyes turned red while saying goodbye to him. Even the wily Miaozhen lost her cool and wouldn’t let go of Li Qiye.

“I’ll remember you.” She hugged him tightly and started to sob.

“Silly girl.” Li Qiye hugged her back and used his gentle voice: “As long as the world is still around, we’ll have a chance to meet again.”

Like it or not, separations were inevitable. Li Qiye waved at the three girls and left with Longevity Sage.

The girls kept on waving at the two until they disappeared completely in the horizon.

The method mentioned by Longevity Sage was located at Yang Radiance Sect, the strongest system in Myriad.

Contrary to the public rivalry between the sage and the untethered, the valley and Yang Radiance had a great relationship. Outsiders weren’t aware of this.

Li Qiye kept a low profile after entering Yang Radiance. Nevertheless, the untethered herself still came to greet him.

They had some minor conflicts in the past, but she still gave him enough face by personally preparing a meticulous reception.

Of course, given Li Qiye’s current status, it was natural for him to enjoy such treatment.

“Untethered, we are visiting today to propose.” The sage calmly said: “This disciple of mine is interested in you, thinking that you are very beautiful and charming. So, Our Longevity Valley is officially requesting a marriage alliance with your Yang Radiance Sect.”

The sage was very similar to Fan Miaozhen in this regards. They had the personality of a demoness, always wanting to cause trouble. No wonder why the sage picked Miaozhen to be her First Disciple, one that would inherit her legacies. This playfulness was one of the most attractive things about her.

“Are you still half-asleep?” The untethered glared at her, cold and imperious as always.

The truth was that both the sage and the untethered were great beauties that could outshine the rest. However, due to their status and position, most didn’t notice their looks as much.

“Is that a no?” The sage continued: “Are you saying that my disciple is reaching high? He’s the number one expert of Myriad, more than enough to be your match. And you are marrying into Longevity Valley, not below you either. Of course, I will take advantage of you since you’ll have to call me Master. Well, actually, you’ll be the rude one calling me master because I’m younger and prettier than you.”
