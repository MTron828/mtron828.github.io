Chapter 3599: Love Beyond Words

Li Qiye’s eyes never diverted from the woman. A million years seemed to be passing in a second.

What attracted him weren’t her flawless features nor her intelligence, just how similar she was to the past.

She sat down in the meditative pose in front of him; her sweet fragrance wafted in the air in a mesmerizing manner.

“You still woke me up.” Her pleasant and unforgettable voice made the chirpings of oriole and skylark grating in comparison.

“This is still you at your best.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“No, I’ve changed for the better.” Kingdom-toppling wasn’t enough to describe her sublime smile. Nothing could make it better; even spring returned with just one smile.

“You haven’t changed.” Li Qiye pondered for a bit before answering softly: “It’s just a different form and path. Your original heart still remains or you wouldn’t have followed me back then.”

“You’re still the same so I’m sure you’ll permit whatever I do in the future.” She spoke in a calm and profound manner. Others would get the urge to converse with her forever.

“It’s a shame that you couldn’t do it, a mishap before even embarking on the journey.” Li Qiye revealed a bitter smile.

“Not all things in life go as planned. I’m not you who plans across the ages. I just did whatever I wanted.” She smiled and had accepted this.

“Right, that’s why you’re you, following your heart and desire without caring for the consequences.” He sentimentally said, feeling a bit disappointed and bitter.

“You’re not happy.” She gently patted his cheek.

He grabbed her hand and could feel the heat.

“I know that you didn’t agree with my choice, but you didn’t force me either.” She continued.

“How could I have changed you? You wouldn’t have changed for anyone, just like me.” He smiled.

“You could have done it, I’m sure, but chose to connive and indulge me instead.” She said softly.

“Right, I wanted you to stay the same. What’s the point otherwise.” Li Qiye eventually responded.

“Oh my merciless dark crow, that’s not you at all.” She chuckled and shook her head: “Others don’t know this side of you but I do. Perhaps I was wrong.”

“If your action is considered a mistake, then mine would have been a catastrophic blunder. I shouldn’t have kidnapped you.” Li Qiye said.

“Tricking a little girl is illegal too.” She joked, looking both beautiful and cute.

The past suddenly resurfaced. The girl back then seemed to be standing before him. This made Li Qiye stare in a daze.

She spread her arms and embraced his waist, snuggling her head into his chest. He embraced her and lowered his head to enjoy her sweet hair. This moment would stay with them forever.

Time seemed to be frozen; nothing wanted nor dared to disturb this tranquility.

After a while, she touched his eyebrows and said: “It’s hard to see you truly happy across the eras but I still want you to smile more.”

“I’m always smiling.” He smiled and said: “I’m still a big player, more or less, and can’t be wearing a funeral face all the time.”

She placed her palms on his chest and leaned back in, whispering: “I wish that there will be someone who can be your companion for generations to come, that the two of you will be able to see the beautiful sunrise and experience the joys of life.”

He enjoyed the gentleness of her voice and remembered when they used to lean on each other and watched the sunrise. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He suddenly hugged her tighter, aware that this was all in the past now.

“Have you been there yet?” She eventually smiled and asked him.

“I don’t dare to go there because he wants to kill me and I can’t just stand there and watch, right? But if I fight back, it’ll be a bloody fight.” He shrugged with a strange expression.

“Who can actually kill you?” She audibly chuckled.

He wouldn’t mind listening to her pleasant laughter forever.

“Stop the act, you can fool the rest of the world but not me. Though you have done a great job, I’m still the closest person to you both.” She shook her head.

He smiled and didn’t respond.

“It has been tough on several people who paid too much.” He said: “The world has no idea of their burden and even reviled them.”

“No one has done more than you, especially the infamy.” She gently touched his face and said.

He couldn’t help grabbing her wrist and stared deeply into her eyes. This became a still image for a long time.

“I know something has happened, otherwise you wouldn’t be here right now. It must be dire.” She said.

He shuddered inside. He had reached the end of the world and fought in the battles above all. He competed against the eternal overlords without batting an eye. However, this split-second affected him so he tightened his embrace.

“You don’t want to tell me.” Her eyes had nothing but tenderness and compassion.

“You’ll always be the happy and optimistic girl in my mind.”Li Qiye chuckled.

She stared at him quietly before nodding: “This will be our last meeting.”

His hands trembled after hearing this but he quickly calmed down.

“Trust me, you’ll be fine.” She held his face with both hands and earnestly said.

“I know.” He took a deep breath and responded: “I’ve grown numb to separation.”

“Yet you still want to take it.” She said with hesitation.

“Yes, that’s my intention, is that okay?” He nodded and said softly.

“I want to refuse but I can’t say no to you. As I’ve said earlier, it’s about whether you’re willing to do it or not.” She answered.

She took out a steel box that didn’t look too special. However, only Li Qiye could open it, no one else.

She solemnly placed it in his hand. He clenched the moment he touched the box.

He wanted to say something but she pressed her finger against his lips: “No need to tell me, keep it in your heart.”

He swallowed his words and nodded.

After a while, she said with sincerity: “Promise me this. Think about it carefully, millions of years have passed, just let them pass.”

“If it’s possible, I will.” He said after a long pause.

“You can do it.” She seemed to be the only one in this world who can change Li Qiye’s mind.

He didn’t answer this time.

“I see.” She continued: “Just remember, before you make the decision, at the very last second, think about it very carefully. Promise me.”

“I promise, I’ll truly think it over.” He eventually relented. He was a man of his words and would do so.

She nodded and trusted him since she understood him more than anyone else.
