Chapter 5693: I Hope You’re Right

The deities never expected to fall into a trap due to their rich experiences. To make such a mistake after a lifetime of success was lamentable. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The whole thing was just an act by Luminous Conqueror and West Bank Prime Emperor. Just one wrong move left them in this perilous situation, unable to escape from the ultimate seal.

One or two deities making a miscalculation was understandable. Alas, all of them were caught this time due to lingering sentiments.

They allowed the two outsiders to enter their forbidden ground, giving them this opportunity. Otherwise, the armies from Celestial Court had no chance of gaining entry.

Ancient Immortal Seal was a special light found deep in Celestial Court, as rare as could be. Only one or two strands were in Celestial Court’s position.

This light could seal everything within its reach, whether it be time or space or any living being.

Why did West Bank Prime Emperor have access to Celestial Court’s supreme treasure? This was more insane than the wildest dream.

“Zzz...” A blood-like liquid flowed from Luminous Conqueror’s true fate to the connected energy pathways and Momentous Dao itself.

The deities had connected their dao and laws to heal and rebuild Luminous. Since they were one with Momentous Frontier, Momentous Dao, and Momentous Star, Luminous could now connect all of these entities to a certain extent.

Temporal Serum’s flow reached Momentous Star as well. This was a mysterious and priceless artifact belonging to Celestial Court.

The lord and three immortals of Celestial Court spent a long time creating this special liquid with the help of their heavenly treasure. The plan was to use this liquid to connect the treasure and its members harmoniously.

Rumor has it that Immortal Assailant Emperor and the duck egg buyer marched for Celestial Court with a mighty coalition. This forced Celestial Court to use Temporal Serum once, revealing its existence.

Now, it showed up again within Luminous Conqueror’s true fate. No one suspected him - a hero who was on the verge of true death after defending Dao Domain.

He had risked his life repeatedly and sacrificed everything to take down some emperors with him. Therefore, the deities had no reason for distrust.

West Bank Prime Emperor had Ancient Immortal Seal and Luminous Conqueror had Temporal Serum hidden in his true fate - both items belonging to Celestial Court.

This meant that everything was part of a plan, culminating in this moment. The heroic prime emperor and unyielding conqueror put up an act to infiltrate Momentous Frontier and connect with the immortal weapon.

Luminous believed that by connecting with the deities, he would be able to control Momentous Dao and the weapon as well.

This was his ultimate goal - seizing control of a weapon far superior to any imperial weapon or even a paragon artifact. He estimated that its classification was true to its fame - immortal.

“My apologies, gentlemen.” Luminous stood up and bowed: “I have no intention of hurting anyone, only to borrow this weapon and the dao found here.”

The deities have been sealed by the ancient artifact; the only thing they could do was grit their teeth with rage.

Under normal circumstances, they could have used their cultivation and other methods to nullify or resist the seal. Alas, they had no reason to be cautious and their energy pathways were connected with Luminous Conqueror. In other words, they tied themselves up, unaware that enemies were near.

“Thank you, Brother.” Luminous bowed at West Bank Prime Emperor: “This day wouldn’t have come without your help.”

The prime emperor glanced in the direction of West Bank Imperial Clan and had a forlorn expression. He then said: “I hope this is worth it.”

“Absolutely.” Luminous said: “Brother, you are surely aware that even with your best effort, you will stay as an apex cultivator. The armies of Celestial Court can come at any time while Immortal Dao City is closed. The destruction of Dao City and West Bank was imminent.”

He paused for a second and continued: “But with this plan, we are gaining an unprecedented potential. You and I both know that we have reached the dao limit, where is the thing that can help us break this bottleneck?”

“Immortal Dao City.” West Bank changed the direction of his gaze.

The artifact was there just like before. Alas, no one could enter now.

“You surely came up with the same answer. Why did Purewood Divine Emperor and Immortal Monarch Yi Ye’s group never show up again? The same for Puresun Dao Lord’s group.” He said.

“Within is a new destination, perhaps an immortal realm.” West Bank said seriously.

“It goes beyond that, in my opinion. It is a place filled with fortunes, the keys to breaking through the limit.” He concluded.

“I hope you’re right.” West Bank stared straight at him.
