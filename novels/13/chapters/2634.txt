Colorful Balloons Take Flight

“Boom!” The tsunami described earlier was actually made of vines soaring through the sky.

They varied in size - some were as big as dragons while others were as tiny as a human arm. All in all, they made up an impressive spectacle.

They came from the sky and from the ground like an unstoppable horde of howling dragons, intending on sweeping Li Qiye away. The merchant wanted to distract Li Qiye and save the youth by doing so.

Most importantly, buzzes resounded around Li Qiye. Tiny vine tentacles grew at a rapid pace on his body, wanting to tightly wrap him up.

“Let’s not be a hero, shall we?” Li Qiye unleashed a devastating finger strike in response. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Flame shot out from his fingertip and incinerated the sky. This seemed to share the same source as a heavenly flame and began to burn the area. When the flame touched the vines, they suddenly exploded like a volcanic eruption.

It didn’t take long before an ocean of fire overfilled the sky. This fierce flame continued to burn up all the vines in its path without leaving anything behind.

“Icebound!” The deer merchant had no time to care about Lu Weijun since this flame was coming for his forest. He roared and released the power of ice to halt the incoming assault.

“Okay, goodbye now.” Li Qiye looked at Weijun and smiled before stomping down on his head.

“No, save me, Ancestor!” Weijun bellowed in horror.

His forehead suddenly became bright. Inside his ocean of memories was a strand of divine light that shoots upward.

“Boom!” A monstrous aura descended and froze time itself.

A figure appeared inside the light emanating from the youth’s forehead. He wore a daoist robe with solar eyes capable of swapping yin and yang.

His laws appeared and exerted pressure on the crowd. The Eternals nearby shuddered from this aura of an Everlasting.

“Hundred-days Daoist!” Someone shouted.

This figure lifted up Li Qiye’s foot, not allowing him to kill the youth. Though this wasn’t his true body, this divine intent still had a tiny portion of his might. It wasn’t overly large but it gave off an unsurpassable feeling of a towering mountain.

“The aura of an Everlasting.” Someone took a deep breath to get a good sense of this crushing pressure.

Just one divine intent from the daoist was already this frightening. What about his true body?

The figure looked capable enough to shoulder the firmaments for the myriad ages. A million years only lasted for a blink of an eye for this awesome being.

Because of this figure’s temporal mastery, time became frozen due to its appearance, on the verge of no longer existing.

“The daoist must really like Lu Weijun.” One ancestor commented since he left behind a divine intent to save Weijun.

“Just one strand of intent, I’ll kill your real body when you get here too.” Li Qiye’s eyes focused. He became shrouded in a divine flame after a loud explosion.

“Boom!” He stomped again, seemingly destroying the entire world.

However, only the figure and the youth were affected. The former became flattened and shattered into nothingness.

“No!” Weijun had already heaved a sigh of relief but the sky suddenly turned dark above him.

“Crack!” Li Qiye flattened his skull as well. Blood started flowing outward.

The atmosphere became tense for the spectators were astounded.

The daoist was an untouchable Everlasting in everyone’s mind. They were scared of just hearing his title and would acquiesce as a result.

If his divine intent were to show up, his enemies would give him face and spare Lu Weijun. Alas, this wasn’t the case here.

The stomp destroying his divine intent was ferocious - a move more impressive than stomping another Eternal to death.

The crowd couldn’t calm down at all while staring at Li Qiye in a daze.

“He’s fiercest in all of history...” One expert smiled wryly.

“The incoming battle will tear the heaven asunder. The daoist will definitely fight Fiercest to death after this.” One ancestor murmured.

This act from Li Qiye had resulted in an irreconcilable feud. It wasn’t just about Lu Weijun but rather, the daoist’s prestige. He has been challenged publicly by a junior so there was no way he could let this go. This was virtually akin to Li Qiye stomping on his face.

That’s why everyone thought that an incredible fight between these two was inevitable.

“Alright, one more down.” Li Qiye smiled and clapped once before looking around again: “Who’s next in line?”
