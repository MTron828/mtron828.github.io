Chapter 5643: Evil In The Bloodline

The grotesque statue seemed capable of growing infinitely. The growing masses could break out at any moment, terrifying spectators.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Blood poured down from the four faces in a nauseating manner, seemingly gestating evil creatures within. If they were to break out, they would act like parasites and eventually take over the host.

Fortunately, a majestic cultivator stood on top of the statue and suppressed the growth to an extent.

Dressing plainly couldn’t conceal her nobility. She resembled the greatest and oldest noble since antiquity. This nobility didn’t stem from accumulation over eras. She was already supreme in those ancient times.

The grand dao bowed before her. Where she stood became the center of heaven and earth, exerting a boundless power.

Staring at her face was akin to staring at the void. One couldn’t discern her facial features at a glance but with more time and effort, they would see the face of an elderly woman in her twilight years. This formed a stark contrast with her unmatched figure.

It seemed to be shrouded by an azure with stars being born within. It kept shifting between the void, old face, and this strange phenomenon. 

“Skyshroud Emperor!” Thousand-hand and Sindragon blurted after taking a look at her face long enough.

They had seen this famous Grand Emperor before but didn’t expect to see her again under these circumstances. She was one of the members who controlled High Heaven Aegis during Grand Dao War.

Now, she used her monstrous power and dao control to suppress the unknown entity. This prevented the things inside from breaking out and ravaging the world.

“What is going on here?” They took a deep breath. This was the first time they saw something that instilled such dread into them.

“A bloodline derived to the limit. Although it gives immense power, there is a price for understanding the most primal power.” Li Qiye sighed.

“This monster came from High Heaven Aegis?” Thousand-hand had an ominous feeling while looking at the four-faced creature.

“Not quite a monster, just the evil created after tracing back far enough. The bloodline shouldn’t exist in the world.” Li Qiye said.

“This is due to the Human-monarch bloodline?” Sindragon thought about what Li Qiye had said and speculated.

“Essentially.” Li Qiye nodded: “If this bloodline evolves naturally with the dao, then it would be fine. However, if it were to reach atavism…”

“This is a state of qi deviation?” Thousand-hand said emotionally.

“Not quite. Qi deviation stems from the self, a heart demon. This is just due to the innate evil existing since its inception.” Li Qiye said.

“What a mysterious bloodline, it seems endless.” Sindragon got chills while looking at the masses.

“Yes, its reproduction power has no limit, this is just one of its abilities.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“Unlimited reproduction.” Thousand-hand said with dread: “It, it’s like the ancient ming in the legends.”

“Good guess.” Li Qiye said.

“The progenitor had researched your past, Sacred Teacher, and found out about the ancient wars. Although she had never met an ancient ming and neither have I, the few descriptions seem to match.” Thousand-hand replied.

“This is just an imitation after seeing a precedent. They wanted to attempt the same thing but the difference between this and the ancient ming is considerable. This stained bloodline ultimately leads to extinction, only a few faint branches will remain.” Li Qiye smiled.

“This comes from Human-monarch, could it ever revert to being pure like the original version?” Sindragon asked.

“Yes, there is a chance. The four of them can obtain the original and glorious bloodline, they just need to cultivate long enough and remove the evil within.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand now.” Thousand-hand murmured: “These four women combine their supreme bloodline with everyone else’s bloodline using Bi’an Beastworld and Nirvana Primal Tree as the base. That’s how they fought as one.”

“Exactly. The heavenly dao is preserved in the bloodlines, they used the earth and the tree’s endless life force to not run out of true blood and mental power. It’s more complicated than just them combining their power.” Li Qiye said before sighing: “It’s just that to exert the most potential power, they still needed to trace back to the source and utilize the mysteries of Human-monarch. They had no other choice, this was the only way to link the bloodlines well enough to give the empress’ group enough life force to fight.”

With that, he stared at the monster and said: “They couldn’t last long enough until grand completion. The evil was not purified and took the chance to take over, hence their current state.”

“It’s a good thing Skyshroud Emperor is protecting them.” Thousand-hand murmured.

“Sacred Teacher, can you save them?” Sindragon couldn’t help but ask.

“I must.” Li Qiye said: “Otherwise, it’s only a matter of time before the evil within will escape and wreck the world.”

Just their sealed state alone was enough to frighten dao lords, not to mention their endless number. How would the world deal with them? What was effective against these malevolent creatures?

“The same as the ancient ming? I heard they obliterated the thirteen continents and nine worlds.” Thousand-hand remarked.

“Far from it.” Li Qiye shook his head:” The ancient ming is an entirely new existence. These things are still in a spiritual state.”
