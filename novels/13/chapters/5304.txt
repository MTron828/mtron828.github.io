Chapter 5305: Leaving So Soon?

The fog entered the portal and became part of its chaotic dao, suddenly disappearing from sight.

“That was Illumination Conqueror.” Meanwhile, a crowd member talked about the attack prior from the stars.

Everyone wondered if those lighting bolts were enough to injure and potentially kill the fog. However, this seemed rather unlikely since it had enough power to escape the seal from numerous ancient emperors and monarchs.

Nonetheless, he did leave an intimidating impression on everyone since they saw how impressive that attack was earlier.  Among the current generation, only a few beings could actually take him on.

“The dregs have been taken care of, withdraw.” Illumination Conqueror’s voice echoed across the battlefield, clearly not intending on dragging out this mess with Lesser Firmament.

“Clank!” A gong could be heard from Heaven Alliance.

“We’re withdrawing.” Lantern obeyed the command and told the others.

It seemed that the sinner had entered Ultimate, there was no need for them to fight Lesser Firmament now.

“Why is everyone leaving so soon?” Someone spoke as the forces were on the verge of withdrawing.

Everyone looked back and saw Li Qiye walking out of Lesser Firmament with a chilling expression - that he was in a bad mood and was about to take it out on them.

The forces stopped in their track, staring at Li Qiye.

“Sir.” Immortal Emperor Guan Feng and Immortal Emperor Yang Sheng came over and bowed. However, this didn’t improve Li Qiye’s mood.

“Commit suicide and spare yourself from a worse fate.” Li Qiye glared at Xiao Qingtian and the others.

The crowd gasped upon hearing this. The observers exchanged glances of confusion.

Guan Feng and Yang Sheng didn’t dare to say anything, quietly backing off. Unfortunately, the others didn’t possess the same knowledge regarding Li Qiye.

“Are you telling us to commit suicide?” Lantern’s eyes became ablaze.

His group had never experienced something like this before given their personal power and influence. In fact, even Illumination Conqueror couldn’t tell them to do so because the killing would require considerable effort.

The dao fruits were virtually indestructible. This was especially true for those with ten fruits and up.

“My patience is limited.” Li Qiye responded.

“He’s even crazier than I am! Men, destroy him!” Ferocity commanded.

The soldiers from the tower behind him rushed forward - giants, demons, river beasts…

Their march caused the ground to quake violently.

“Give it here.” Li Qiye reached for Jue Xian’er.

She became startled and let out a battle cry. Given her current cultivation, her voice alone could destroy stars.

However, he easily caught her as if she was a helpless chicken and took the chain away.

“Clank!” He extended it fully with both hands and glanced at the incoming dragon lords and demons.

“Whoosh!” He swung the chain and dismembered them from the waist horizontally.

“Ahh!” Blood splashed everywhere.

Their true fate and sacred fruits flew into the sky and activated their power. However, the chain grew longer and pierced through all of them, looking like a meat skewer.

He then slammed it vertically against the legion of Heaven Alliance.

“Prepare for battle!” Godcloud shouted.

“Kill, kill, kill!” The legion members roared thunderously and formed a grand formation.

It assumed the image of an endless land with countless dao and murderous potential. Alas, this meant nothing because the now-gigantic chain obliterated them.

“Ahh!” These dragon lords and sovereigns were reduced to a field of smashed berries. Having the number advantage didn’t help them here.

The massacre horrified the crowd but the chain didn’t stop there. It headed for the thirteen famous dragon lords under Heaven Hammer Conqueror.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

They were courageous veterans and didn’t run from battle. Their sacred fruits appeared and formed a line in order to stop the chain.

The fruits exploded upon contact and the chain went on to destroy the dragon lords in their avatar form.
