Chapter 3563: Speculations

Teacher Du tried for a bit and couldn’t come up with an answer. Perhaps he hasn’t actually met this old man and that this was only a weird feeling. Being stuck in this made him only think about the old man and not Li Qiye.

“Who was that old man?” Teacher Du realized he forgot to ask earlier.

“The young man was Young Noble Li.” One of Xiao Ling’s two friends answered since they were the most familiar: “We don’t know the old man but the young noble calls him Attendant.”

“Attendant?” Teacher Du frowned. Those without a name usually had a lowly background. Therefore, he shouldn’t have met the guy before.

“Young Noble Li?” He focused on Li Qiye instead. This guy left no impression on him, just another passerby.

“He’s a woodchopper.” The student named Zhang Yu said, not hiding his disdain and anger.

Someone like Li Qiye wasn’t qualified to stand before him. However, the guy still killed his mount. If it wasn’t for Xiao Ling, he would have killed the guy.

“A woodchopper?” The teacher became surprised. He noticed that Li Qiye was a Violet Marquis which wasn’t that weak.

He could easily become a wealthy man in the mortal world. Why would he be working as a woodchopper?

“Young Noble Li does gather wood and burn them to make charcoal.” Xiao Ling said: “But I feel that he might have another reason for staying there.”

A while ago, she thought that a cultivator acting as a woodchopper was too illogical and self-destructive. Upon further rumination, this might not be the case.

As the old attendant kept on repeating - his young master had his reasons for doing things. Others couldn’t speculate this.

She initially thought that he was just trying to be mysterious. A woodchopper living in the wilderness had no future to speak of, let alone acting inscrutable. She had a change of heart afterward.

“He’s nothing more than a woodchopper. He can burn all he wants and won’t get immortal metal, only charcoal.” Zhang Yu said.

“No precious metal but he still gained a lot living there. For example, that seven-colored draconic loach. He must have been staying there for a long time and know all of the precious materials and herbs.” Another girl said.

Xiao Ling and her two friends have changed their perspective on him, no longer looking down on his choice.

“Hmph, he’s nothing more than a blind cat coming across a dead mouse.” Zhang Yu went on: “There are precious materials everywhere in that mountain range. Anyone else born there would have picked up a seven-colored draconic loach too.”

“What are you all talking about?” Teacher Du was surprised.

“Young Noble Li actually boiled a seven-colored...” The friend told the story in detail.

The students who were there became envious. One said: “He’s so lucky, even finding that great fish.”

“Hmm...” Teacher Du frowned again. He was more knowledgeable and experienced than these students. It wasn’t that easy to find a seven-colored draconic loach.

“It’s not just luck.” Xiao Ling said: “Young Noble Li said that he was used to the place. He probably grew up there and became neighbors with the beasts.”

“Is that so?” Teacher Du pondered. This might be one possibility but there was still something strange about the whole thing.

Of course, some students disagreed. One objected: “How can that be? It’s the rule of the jungle there. The beasts respect power; any of them can eat him.”

“That’s right, Princess. He was just boasting so don’t believe him.” Zhang Yu added.

Meanwhile, Teacher Du contemplated without saying anything.

“Golden Cicada Buddhist Child was there too.” Teacher Du smiled after hearing about the monk and the fish soup. He had heard about the youth’s gluttonous nature before.

“Seems like this will be fun. Our academy’s genius is here too, maybe they’ll meet.” He revealed.

“Senior Sister Lan is here too?” The students became excited. Some of the males’ eyes turned bright.

“Yes.” Teacher Du nodded: “We’ll see if you’re lucky enough to see her in action. It’ll be a shame if she leaves too early.”

“She’ll show her prowess here?” Everyone wanted to watch.

“I’m sure it’ll shock everyone, we’ll be able to see her supreme temperament and aura.” Another female friend said excitedly.

It didn’t take long before the entire group talked about this “Senior Sister Lan”. Some male students didn’t hide their admiration at all.

They were talking about their academy’s top genius - Dugu Lan.

She was the most talented on top of being a direct disciple of the current dean - Five-colored Sacred Sovereign. He was one of the four grandmasters of Buddha Holy Ground. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Dugu Lan was known to be undefeated in the academy. Even the majority of teachers thought that they were weaker.

Both the male and female students considered her as an idol or goddess.

She rarely appeared in public so few of them were fortunate enough to see her. Thus, her trip to Myriad Beast Mountains made the group excited.

Teacher Du led them across numerous peaks. Suddenly, gales blew away the clouds.

The students looked up and saw a dragon, no, a massive serpent.

“Three-headed winged serpent!” Xiao Ling and her friends became afraid and had the urge to flee.

However, they noticed that there were people standing on top of the serpent now. This fierce creature has been tamed.

“Divine Ghost Tribe.” The academy students noticed the fog and mist surrounding that group.

“Friends, where are you going?” Teacher Du started a conversation.

The old man controlling the serpent also greeted with a smile: “Dao Brother Du, it’s nice to see you here.”

Duality Academy was one of the strongest powers in Buddha Holy Ground. No teacher there was weak. Some could dominate the entire world. For example, Five-colored Sacred Sovereign.

That’s why he wasn’t ignored like the students a while ago. The old man from the ghost race exercised prudence and respect when talking to Teacher Du.

No one dared to look down on Duality in the entire holy ground, not even Heavenly Dragon Temple, Vajra Dynasty, or Divine Ghost Tribe.

“Same, where are you heading, Dao Brother?” Teacher Du smiled.

“I heard that someone had found a mystical gem tree further ahead.” The old ghost didn’t hide this information.
