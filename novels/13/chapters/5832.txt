Chapter 5832: Try The Power Of My Cells

“Rumble!” Although emperors have turned into tentacle creatures, they retained their cultivation. In fact, their power somehow increased and broke through the existing bottleneck.

Light-dragon and his peers erupted with divinity and a billowing primal aura.

“Primal anima...” Demon and the others couldn’t believe it.

Although they have lost their anima since they have been devoured and destroyed, they still obtained the primal affinity.

The group didn’t break the limit, so they previously had no contact with this affinity. Turning into these monsters allowed them to soar one or two levels above - catching up to the founder, the three immortals, and the few emperors.

However, due to his primordial barrier, the miasma couldn’t do anything to Li Qiye.

“Try the power of my cells!” Derivation shouted.

“Not my first time seeing this, it’s just child’s play at this point.” Li Qiye smiled.

“They’ll be your end!” Derivation commanded the infected emperors to lunge for Li Qiye.

The piles of flesh roared and attacked like a flood, crushing stars along the way. Their ugly appearance and mighty power instilled fear into spectators.

“Scram.” Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at them. His aura erupted and sent out devastating shockwaves, sending them flying.

The force obliterated them into pieces. Those watching couldn’t believe their eyes since emperors with the primal affinity still couldn’t block a single move from Li Qiye.

Members of Celestial Court felt tiny before Li Qiye during the start of the battle. Now, this sensation has become more vivid and obvious. They were too weak to sense it sooner.

Li Qiye’s aura reduced the monsters to pieces. In theory, that should be the end of them.

However, the remnants squirmed and started piling up together as one, growing larger and larger until it was nearly the same size as Lord of Derivation.

The powers of the dead emperors stacked repeatedly and divine rings pulsed outward, ultimately manifesting into a single Ancestor.

“I can’t believe it.” An emperor became startled while watching in front of the mirror.

“Another Ancestor.” Another said sentimentally.

None among Light-dragon’s group was able to reach this realm when they were alive. Now, their corpses have broken through the limit.

“Raa!” The fleshy continent roared and colossal tentacles sprouted toward Li Qiye.

They looked like mountain ranges destroying everything along the way. The suction cups on them poured forth torrents of liquid.

They looked disgusting with a murky yellow color, coming together to form a vast ocean around Li Qiye, wanting to engulf him...
