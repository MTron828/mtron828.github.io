Chapter 5761: Take Me To See The Stars

“Boom!” His primordial laws coiled around the gate’s frozen ones, forcing them on a different flow.

The countless worlds and endless derivations became helpless and subjected to Li Qiye’s whims.

“Clank!” He lined them up into one place and his eyes lit up, causing everything to explode into smoke.

The remnant powers came together and formed a single mantra.

“Clank!” The mantra exuded three divine rings, capable of crossing through time and space.

“Trinity.” Li Qiye smiled, having expected this.

“What is that?” Ling’er became curious and touched the mantra. It resonated with her as if she was its master.

“A supreme mantra bound with life, it can connect with you.” He said.

“Created for me?” She felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity as if she had seen it before.

He nodded and pushed the gate.

“Creak...” The heavy gate slowly opened, allowing the group to enter.

Inside was a path extending deep into a starry platform. They eventually reached a platform and saw twinkling stars, seemingly whispering.

Each was unique and beautiful, far more spectacular than regular galaxies. It was as if a doting father had chosen the shimmering stars for his daughter to gaze upon.

“I’ve, I’ve seen this place before, this is it!” Ling’er couldn’t help raising her voice. Tears streamed down her cheeks inadvertently.

Although she had never seen it in person before, it always appeared in her mind like a dream. In her subconsciousness, she believed that she had seen this unforgettable expanse previously.

The stars’ whispers resembled bedtime stories, lulling her to sleep. They befriended and enveloped her with warmth. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I’m sure I’ve been here before too, not alone, someone was with me.” Emotions deep within her were stirred by the scene.

Li Qiye sighed and embraced her, resting her head against his chest. He patted her back and said: “They are beautiful because there is love.”

“Someone brought me here before, I’m sure of it.” She gradually stabilized under his comforting reassurance and wiped her tears.

“I know.” He responded and held her hand, walking deeper into space.

They made it to a raised platform, perhaps the highest point in this expanse. One could reach up and pluck the stars and when looking down, the entire world was at their feet.

An ancient coffin awaited them at the center of the platform; its age was impossible to discern. It glimmered occasionally with starlight and illuminated the stars nearby, giving the impression that it was made of a galaxy.

It seemed to be one with the expanse. Standing amidst the stars meant standing on top of the coffin. The two were fundamentally intertwined with no distinction.

Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed upon seeing this coffin. He gazed deeper into the expanse until he found an unreachable dimension.

A figure stood proudly there, seemingly part of that dimension. Behind him was another infinite expanse of stars.

He has been paying attention to the coffin’s location all this time and naturally saw Li Qiye, prompting the latter to smirk.

As he gazed at Li Qiye through the endless space, he seemed to be thinking or waiting for something.

An outsider appearing near the coffin was a challenge so he had several options - plunging back into the expanse and disregarding all caution to stop Li Qiye.

Or perhaps, he should just do nothing and allow Li Qiye to proceed. However, this might lead to worse outcomes that he had no control over. This was undoubtedly a dilemma. If he were to intervene, was he Li Qiye’s match?

As for Li Qiye, he had a smile on his face and waited patiently, curious about the figure’s choice.
