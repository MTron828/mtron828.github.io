Chapter 4246: Casual Slash

The venerable instilled fear into the spectator as he wielded Abyss. No one questioned the power of an overlord but the addition of the heavenly sword intensified the terror.

He has yet to activate his aura but everyone still saw an illusion - that he was the master of the universe. All lives were within his grasp. A breath of his could kill a billion.

“Boom!” He released his twelve palaces and torrential vitality, nearly breaking the sky itself.

The suppressive aura paralyzed the crowd and left them helpless.

“How can anyone beat him when he has that sword?” A mighty ancestor from another sect turned pale.

The sword seemed to be boosting his already-incredible power multiple times.

“Take this!” He roared and erased everyone’s courage. They felt their soul leaving their body.

He wanted to test Li Qiye’s power with this abyssal slash. Space and time twisted chaotically before sinking into the form of an abyss.

Nothing in this world could escape this black maw, not even the fastest being. The various affinities and laws weren’t spared either.

The abyss appeared above and expanded exponentially. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Fuck!” Spectators bellowed in fear. Their true fate was being affected, seemingly being dragged out of their body. Their mind told them to fly towards the abyss just like moths heading to the flames.

Despite being aware of this fatal desire, there was nothing they could do outside of screaming. This unbeatable slash alone could take down an entire kingdom.

Li Qiye retaliated in the next second - a simple swing of Myriad Era. It appeared sluggish but in reality, it was faster than time. Because of this, it looked slow to weaker cultivators.

Most importantly, it immediately exposed the weakness in the venerable’s Abyss Sword Art.

“Boom!” The unbeatable abyss crumbled right away. The terrible mental devouring process stopped and spectators calmed down.

This was akin to a full-air balloon being pricked by a needle and exploding instantly. The crowd couldn’t believe it - a simple move took down an apocalyptic abyss.

One would argue that Li Qiye saw numerous flaws in the venerable’s sword dao. This shouldn’t be possible due to the latter’s impeccable mastery.

Vastsea was aghast. He had used Abyss Sword Dao to fight against the other overlords before and was equally competitive. He had no idea how Li Qiye’s swing managed to nullify his attack.

“What is this sword art?” He wore an austere expression.

He knew that he wasn’t the strongest in the world, far from it even. However, no one should be able to solve his dao with a casual swing. This was no ordinary dao either. Its profundity was unmatched since it came from a heavenly scripture.

His attainment with it was near perfection and didn’t have any opening. Alas, the impossible happened.

Confusion was one thing but everyone recognized Li Qiye’s victory in the first exchange. Those on his side became excited right away.

“Is a random swing a sword art nowadays?” Li Qiye responded, leaving Vastsea with an awkward expression.

Remember, Vastsea Sword Dao helped his sect dominate the continent. Now, a “random swing” nullified it?

Li Qiye downplayed and disparaged his miraculous feat so those from Sword Sea thought that he was looking down on their Abyss Sword Dao and treating it as if it was worthless.
