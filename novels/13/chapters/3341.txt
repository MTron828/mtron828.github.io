“Senior Sister is so strong and cool.” The ones from Divine Black began singing praises.

She made them proud by instantly pushing back Shu Yaoyao. A while ago, they were being bullied and needed to hold back. Now, their anger and indignation turned into incredible satisfaction.

The Shu Brothers became alarmed. They had higher seniority and power compared to her. Alas, she had the upper hand due to her heaven merit laws. This wasn’t something they could make up.

“An inborn true fate is extraordinary indeed.” The exasperated Shu Jinqiao admitted. He continued on while staring at her: “But Miss Gong, this doesn’t mean you can do as you ple-...”

“Come together if you don’t want to give up. I’ll take both of you on.” Qianyue interrupted him.

“Miss Gong, you’re the one saying this.” Jinqiao’s eyes flashed, he was waiting for her to say this.

Their odds weren’t good in a one-on-one fight, whether it be him or his younger brother. However, the two of them together? That’s a different story.

Their cultivation was already stronger than her so this might greatly increase their advantage and chance of winning.

“Sure.” Qianyue coldly uttered: “I’ve heard that you two are a great team. We’ll see if it’s true.”

She seemed capable of shouldering great responsibility despite her age.

Everyone watched with bated breath, especially those on Divine Black’s side. They even clenched their fist and became nervous since Qianyue no longer had a clear advantage.

The two brothers moved into position and pincered her. One used a truncheon, the other a moon fork.

Their vitality erupted along with samadhi flames. The powerful waves made it difficult for the audience to watch.

“Let’s go!” Both brothers shouted at the same time.

Shu Jinqiao mercilessly swung his truncheon downward. “Boom!” A loud explosion detonated, resulting in a majestic force aiming to stop Qianyue from moving.

As for Yaoyao, he released more tornados from his moon fork straight at her. They coiled around her - another attempt at stopping her movement.

Unfortunately, she still managed to use an unbelievable angle to dodge the truncheon first before getting out of the tornado containment.

She appeared behind Yaoyao in the next second. “Clank.” Her sword illuminated the sun and moon before a vertical slash came for Yaoyao’s back. He was the weaker of the two so she chose him first.

The startled man swung his moon fork backward and used the “Sky-incinerating Flame” technique towards the slash.

“Boom!” Fiery sparks scattered. He tried his best to stop her sword but since she was under the empowerment of an imperial merit law, it didn’t look good for him.

He got pushed out of the air and smashed into the ground, creating a large pit.

“Stop!” Jinqiao shouted and swung his destructive truncheon again. It emitted numerous waves of energy.

She leaped backward as her sword became blinding with individual rays empowered by the Black Tortoise Imperial Art. It instilled the power of the cosmo into her sword.

“Boom!” Jinqiao got sent flying despite being more powerful. He broke down dozens of trees along the way before stopping.

The two brothers couldn’t believe it. They regrouped and stood shoulder to shoulder, paled.

It seemed that they had still underestimated the power of a high-level heaven merit law.

“So strong, the art of the great divine beast, Black Tortoise.” Yaoyao couldn’t help but praise.

This imperial law alone was the thing suppressing them. Their earth-level laws appeared mediocre in comparison.

“So that’s Black Tortoise Imperial Art.” The ones from Divine Black became emotional.

This was their first time witnessing its power despite hearing about it before. After all, it was a top-ranking merit law.

However, they only had a vague concept of its true power, only a general idea. That’s why they were awestruck right now. So, a high-level heaven law was virtually unbeatable.

Furthermore, they realized that when cultivators were in the same realm, having a higher-level merit law meant certain victory.

They started dreaming about the day when they could cultivate the heaven laws as well.

“Together.” The two brothers made up their mind and nodded.

“Clank.” Their weapons touched and sparks went off.

“Rumble!” Waves of light emanated from the contact.

The two activated their merit law at the same time. Jinqiao became an ape while his truncheon had a dragon coiling around it. Yaoyao entered a mad state; his moon fork had spirited monkey images appearing on the blade.

“Ape and Monkey’s Devil Form. Watch out, this team offense is very strange.” Huang Jie warned.

The two brothers cultivated a team attack, not only relying on their merit laws but also their weapons. Their battle potential became several times stronger as a result.

Qianyue became serious after seeing this form of theirs. It was quite famous in Three Truths so she didn’t want to underestimate the enemy.

“Die!” The two of them became crazy during the attack, just like an ape and a monkey. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The power stemming from their weapons exploded and blotted out the area. It manifested into something resembling a gigantic beast wanting to devour her.

She focused on using her imperial art and sword technique. The Black Tortoise continued on shouldering the heaven; her sword dictated the fate of the cosmo.

The celestials and the yin and yang changed direction in accordance with the whim of her slashes.

“Boom!” Her wondrous sword technique was blocked by the brothers.

She moved freely like a flood-dragon in the ocean, continuously unleashing more sword waves. They came together and formed a net that closes in on the two brothers.

Unfortunately, the crazed brothers rampaged and crushed the sword waves.

“Thump! Thump! Thump!” Qianyue was pushed several steps back by their attacks. Her inner energy churned a bit so she needed to take a deep breath to calm down.

Her peers became nervous with their heart hanging on a thread, they clenched their fists and started sweating. Meanwhile, the ones from Three Truths cheered loudly.
