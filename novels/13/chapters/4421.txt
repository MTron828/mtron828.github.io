Chapter 4422: Choice

Eyes turned cold after the contemptuous comment. The members of the east viewed Li Qiye as a nobody who spewed nonsense in front of them.

“Who is this impudent brat?” An eastern cultivator asked.

“He’s Li Qiye, the sect master of Little Diamond.” Someone from the south whispered.

“Little Diamond? Never heard of it.” This was a foreign title to the east.

“Just a tiny sect.” A member of Dragon smiled wryly.

“Hmph!” An eastern expert was unhappy and said: “Just an insignificant character then. Why is Dragon letting him run his mouth? What a joke.”

The disciples of Dragon smiled wryly and didn’t say anything else. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“This is just Li Qiye’s style, not caring about others’ feelings.” Someone in the know said.

Those who have been paying attention to Li Qiye thought that he was just being consistent.

“Junior, which sect are you from? Tell your seniors to come out!” An ancestor from the east shouted.

Li Qiye smiled and said: “A bunch of shameless old men who consider themselves paragons. Such thick skin.”

The ancestors from the east were livid after hearing this insult. As famous big shots, even the nicest among them couldn’t stand for this.

“Ignorant brat, do you know who we are?!” The ex-sect master of Five-sun shouted aggressively.

“No idea.” Li Qiye casually responded.

“I am the previous sect master of Five-sun. My son is Five-sun King, a supreme genius. The gentlemen and ladies here are peerless ancestors. He is Treasure Ancestor…” He went on to introduce the various characters.

This would be enough to frighten most, especially younger cultivators. However, Li Qiye lacked interest and waved again: “Never heard of any of you or even your ancestors, no point in telling me.”

The ex-sect master thought that their fame would be enough to make Li Qiye piss in his pants. Alas, there was no reaction from the guy. It felt the same way as punching with full force and only hitting air - a truly infuriating sensation.

“Scram already, I’m busy.” Li Qiye ordered and gestured as if he was swatting a fly.

“Is he insane, he’s offending all of the eastern envoys.” An audience member took a deep breath.

This alliance consisted of numerous ancestors from prestigious clans. Offending them was rather unwise.

“Junior, you are courting death by interfering with the marriage alliance!” The ex-sect master shouted.

“Still haven’t given up hope? Must I take off your head before you understand?” Li Qiye retorted.

“This is ridiculous!” The entire alliance could stand this no longer.

“You deserve death!” One ancestor bellowed. They didn’t come to Dragon to be humiliated.

“That’s not enough. As punishment for his insult, my son will enslave his clan for generations!” The ex-sect master roared.

“Your son this, your son that, is that all you do? Looks like your son is at least capable enough for you to be your pride. Hmm, I wonder if I kill you now, will he be capable enough to avenge you?”

The crowd became frozen and confused right away. They thought that Li Qiye didn’t know that he was messing with the father of a potential dao lord.

Only Jian Qingzhu gasped because she could smell the stench of blood already.

“Hahaha, a junior like you is talking about killing me?!” The ex-sect master laughed heartily.

“Last chance. Scram or your head will roll on the ground, but I guess I wouldn’t mind that either. We’ll see if your son can do anything about it.”

“Sect Master, kill him for questioning His Majesty’s prestige.” Featherhat Paragon uttered coldly.

“Sever his limbs, crush his meridians, then flay him slowly.” The ex-sect master ordered three nearby elders.

They immediately rushed over and surrounded Li Qiye in a triangular formation. Five-sun King was a powerful sect so they were mighty cultivators.

The three ancient demons from Dragon didn’t say anything. As for Peacock Monarch, he has been wanting to kill Li Qiye but restrained himself due to the circumstances. It wouldn’t be bad if Five-sun School would do it for him.

“Brat, consider this the greatest honor in your life. I can’t believe you’ll get the chance to be killed by us three.” One of the elders threatened, thinking that this leader of a tiny sect had no chance against them.

“Saber.” Li Qiye didn’t bother to stare at them.

“Clank!” Jian Qingzhu’s saber flew out of the scabbard and landed in his grasp.

“You may start.” Li Qiyet then pointed the saber at one of them and said: “Otherwise, once you’re all ghosts, you’ll complain about how I didn’t give you a chance.”

“Hahaha! The young ones nowaday are so bold.” The three turned red with anger.
