Once the spectators calmed down, applause immediately erupted.

Golden Cicada Buddhist Child managed to send the scion flying during their fight. However, that was more of a warm-up and no real injuries occurred.

Furthermore, the scion seemed rather serious this time. He might not be going all-out but was still using eighty percent of his power. Thus, Dugu Lan’s success was special.

“Incredible!” Some shouted with uncontainable excitement.

“First Sister’s sword art is unbeatable!” The students from Duality turned red with elation.

“Right, that move can’t be stopped by the young generation.” One genius had nothing but admiration.

“That’s Trinity Sword Art.” An ancestor emotionally murmured: “Void Zone lives up to its reputation.”

The powerful ancestors shuddered and shared the same thought - that their experience and power wouldn’t be enough to escape unscathed.

“I couldn’t block this move. The sword art is truly unbeatable.” The scion’s expression changed. He didn’t bother to look at the wound on his shoulder and was still in high spirits despite losing this exchange.

“First Sister, defeat him!” Duality students yelled again.

Other youths chimed in and showed their support: “Fairy Dugu! Do it for the holy ground!”

“Fairy Dugu!” Cheers could be heard from all members of the holy ground in the audience.

Dugu Lan was actually in a state of zen, not affected by external sounds.

“You’re still not going all out, Scion. This isn’t over.” Dugu Lan said.

“I’ve rarely been injured in a direct fight ever since the completion of my dao. I suppose I have to try harder since it would be a shame to not see all of Trinity Sword Art.” The scion smiled.

Having said that, his mighty aura swept through the area like a tsunami. This seemed to be an awakened state. He finally revealed his true power to the astonishment of the crowd. Many spectators were blown a thousand miles away. The older ancestors wouldn’t claim to be stronger than him either.

“Boom!” As he continued to gather strength, his energy manifested into a terrible maelstrom. His battle spirit seemingly tore the sky vault apart. Each of his movements brimmed with unstoppable destruction.

“Good!” Dugu Lan knew that letting him power up like this was unwise so she immediately unleashed her second technique.

The dark side of the sword was on top as she roared: “Lifeblood Earth!”

The sky turned dark first before the rest of the world. The end comes from heaven while the earth gives life - this was the second technique of Trinity Sword Art.

A typha tree emerged from the darkness. This was an evil tree only existing in the legends.

“Hmm...” Experts activated their heavenly gaze but still saw only darkness.

“My eyes?!” Numerous became frightened right away after losing their sight.

Normally, even in total darkness, a cultivator’s heavenly gaze would let them see. Lights no longer mattered as much.

But now, even the ancestors couldn’t see a thing. Some thought that they were blind.

“Why doesn’t the heavenly gaze work?!” Some started shouting.

“Calm down, your eyes are fine. This is a dao of concealment!” A mighty ancestor loudly declared and managed to calm the crowd.

They stopped panicking and focused up. From this, they sensed a dreadful darkness permeating the realm.

This darkness seemed to be a life force and created more living beings. This was akin to mud and soil giving life to vegetation.

“Something’s emerging!” Many shuddered right away.

As time passed, numerous new existences could be detected within the darkness. In the next second, they fused and became one.

“Boom!” A terrible power erupted, akin to the birth of the god of darkness.

The spectators dropped to the ground after sensing this terrible being.

“So this is Lifeblood Earth. It creates life from darkness.” A powerful ancestor had heard of a legend pertaining to this technique.

Another ancestor wanted to use their weapon to light up the area. Unfortunately, lights were crushed by this absolute darkness. No rays would come out.

“Damn.” The ancestor murmured.

The crowd had no choice but to yield and accept this dark power. There was no other choice.

“That’s Trinity Sword Art for you.” Another high elder remarked.

The move was only aimed towards the scion but everyone else was affected as well.

“Boom!” Suddenly, the light returned after a deafening explosion.

The spectators could see again - the scion floating in the air while raising his glowing Heavenseize. The seven orbs exuded endless flames, wanting to forcefully push the darkness away.
