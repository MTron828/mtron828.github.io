Cloudcrossing Falcon God had won everyone’s attention with his wrath capable of incinerating everything.

An Eternal was immensely powerful; Ascenders couldn’t block a single move from one. His rage caused volcanic eruptions and other natural disasters. The crowd stopped daring to look straight at him, feeling their legs growing weak.

The experts quietly retreated, robbed of color on their face. The next move from this raging Eternal might destroy everything here. Being too close to the battlefield could spell doom from just the shockwaves - dying before they know it.

Nevertheless, they couldn’t leave right away. It has been a long time since they saw a real Eternal.

After reaching this level, Eternals had a chance to ascend to Imperial Lineage. The best part of this was the increased lifespan. Thus, the majority of Eternals left right away.

After all, most experts who reached this level were quite old, perhaps on the verge of death. Nothing was more precious than living longer in their eyes.

The ones that stay behind couldn’t abandon their systems and chose to protect it, hence the few Eternals in Myriad Lineage.

Cloudcrossing Falcon God Yang Xun was certainly capable of reaching Imperial but chose against doing so. More surprisingly, he actually came out to support Mu Shaochen and risked losing lifespan in the process.

“If I can’t kill you, my last name will not be Yang!” The falcon god gritted his teeth and roared.

The shock waves emanating from his roar made people vomit blood even though his main focus was on Li Qiye. Unfortunately, his overwhelming rage didn’t affect Li Qiye at all. The guy stood there, seemingly aloof.

“Who cares if your last name isn’t Yang when you’re about to die.” Li Qiye chuckled.

A while ago, people would think that he was insane for talking to an Eternal like this, but after actually witnessing his murderous abilities, this no longer became the consensus.

“He’s the only one worthy of the title Fiercest.” An ancestor murmured.

“Hahaha!” The falcon god crazily laughed: “It has been many years since someone dared to say that to me, I guess the future generation will surpass us in time, but you’re still going to die!”

His eyes turned ferocious with a murderous intent lacerating the flesh, causing the spectators to feel pain.

“I won’t kill you right away, no, I’ll take my time flaying your skin, inch by inch, and ripping out your tendons so that your scream will echo all over Myriad...” A cruel smile flashed on the falcon god.

“Alright, I get it, it’s a nice dream but I’m sorry it won’t happen. The only thing that will, is your death.” Li Qiye casually interrupted. He expressed himself in such a nonchalant manner yet the words carried enough weight to be treated as fact.

The crowd glanced at each other - Li Qiye was so confident at killing the falcon god. Even if he was heaven-defying, can a youth kill an Eternal?

Plus, they could see that he wasn’t a True Emperor yet, so the possibility for success remained low.

“I will pin you down first.” The falcon god summoned and pointed a spear at Li Qiye.

The shiny, white spear exuded a powerful force, seemingly made from the stars in the sky and containing the power of their light. It seemed incomparably long and could ravage its brethren in the sky.

“Cloudcrossing Starspear! His famous weapon.” An ancestor murmured.

This spear might not be the falcon god’s strongest weapon, but it has followed him across numerous battlefields. Numerous True Gods have fallen to it in the past.

“Die!” The god roared, thrusting the spear straight at Li Qiye. His battle intent erupted, capable of piercing through everything alone.

The energy of his spear encompassed the penetrating power of light, violently heading for Li Qiye like numerous needles.

“Buzz.” The earth was being torn asunder like tofu. If the power of this spear were to make contact, even an Ascender would be torn to pieces. The crowd smartly retreated after seeing this.

Li Qiye retaliated at the perfect moment. He materialized a sword and instantly slashed forward.

The slash was formless and undetectable due to its incredible speed. In fact, people didn’t even see the sword.

Some powerful ancestors managed to see him raising his hand but failed to see the particular swing and its true profundities.

The dazzling thrust came to a sudden halt as if time has been frozen. This wasn’t the case.

The falcon god chose to stop the moment Li Qiye raised his hand and retreated with a time-surpassing speed. The flow reversed and the spear returned to his hand.

Everyone felt this particular temporal disturbance, but it wasn’t actually happening. After he retreated, a quiet yet resonating clank could be heard.

“Splash!” Blood gushed out of his hands.

People found that his spear has been split in half; his hands were severed as well.

“Bump!” Both hands and the two pieces of the spear fell to the ground. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The pale god instantly sealed his stumps to stop the blood loss. If he was just microsecond later in his retreat, his body would have suffered the same fate.
