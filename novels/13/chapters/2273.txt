“Boom!” The giant used its shield fiercely, creating a tempest in its wake. The sovereigns were blown flying while vomiting blood.

“So weak.” Li Qiye mocked again while drinking tea and enjoyed a massage from Fan Miaozhen just like an emperor. He looked both carefree yet tyrannical.

“These are the pillars of your kingdom? C’mon now, do your best or you won’t have the chance soon. Get Eternals to come as reinforcements, let’s not make a mockery of your coup.” He continued.

Such domineering and contemptuous words made it seem like he wasn’t afraid of anyone in Myriad Lineage. It certainly affected the crowd, causing them to hold their breath.

Normally, a junior making a comment like this would be quite annoying, especially if they had an attitude like Li Qiye. Alas, no one found it unreasonable or arrogance. His attitude seemed to be just right given the current circumstances. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Boom!” The giant slammed its hammer and shield together, looking just like a fierce gladiator, ready to go wild at any given moment.

It pointed the hammer at the sovereigns. It didn’t speak but this posture told the tale - a complete contempt against its foes.

This showing enraged the sovereigns since they rarely experienced this type of humiliation before. Moreover, it came from a non-living puppet made of branches. Their chest was about to explode from indignation; blood was churning and almost reaching the throat.

“Formation, Silver Dragon Fusion!” The sovereigns shouted and raised their weapons.

Their vitality and true energy surged like a storm, assaulting the area.

“Boom!” Under their command, all members of Silver Dragon released their true energy while also pointing their weapons at the sky.

It didn’t take long before their power gathered together. In the blink of an eye, formations appeared beneath their feet and head. These formations then instantly joined together while the members circled around the sovereigns. The members’ armors then turned into tiny components.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” These parts came together with the thirty-six sovereigns’ armors at the center.

Finally, a massive being made out of metal emerged, not smaller than the wooden giant at all. In fact, it was one head taller. Clouds were down near its waist.

Its hull was as white as snow with a golden luster. It seemed to be made out of silver with a touch of gold.

More shockingly, the image of a silver dragon was coiling around it, almost taking physical shape.

“Rawr!” The metal being roared, almost sounding like a dragon.

“Silver Dragon Carapace!” Even an Ascender shouted in astonishment.

“Their final move!” Another ancestor gasped.

“Now that’s more interesting.” Li Qiye chuckled: “So that epoch lord had reached this world too, leaving this supreme art behind.”

No one really understood his comment, not even the ancestors of Everlasting. This armor was the ultimate move of the legion. Rumor has it that the creator of Everlasting had found an ancient trunk full of manuals. From that, he came up with a secret method to craft the armor for the members of Silver Dragon. When necessary, these armor pieces could join together. They were just part of this gigantic being.

Of course, even the creator of Everlasting didn’t know that this was an art from a lost epoch of the nine and tenth worlds. He only knew the bare minimum of this art. Nevertheless, the metal being created from it was still quite powerful.

“Kill!” The being instantly attacked. Its first step shattered the void.

“Ra!” The wooden giant also roared back and rushed forward to meet it head-on.

The real victim here was the space around them. Everything was crushed and the world became unstable. People started getting dizzy and nauseated.

The metal being smashed the shield, resulting in a loud impact that could rupture eardrums.

“Crack!” Countless cracked lines appeared on the wooden shield before a full collapse.

This caparace was clearly stronger than the thirty-six sovereigns alone earlier.

“Bam!” The wood giant retaliated with a hammer blow but the metal being didn’t try to dodge so its back was struck.

It prioritized offense instead, punching the wood giant’s chest with both hands. This dual punch could cross through the world.

The punches failed because the wood giant had created another wooden shield. This shield got penetrated as well but it had served its purpose.

The tree empowering the giant allowed it to re-create another shield in a short time.

“Rumble!” The two giants didn’t hold back. Their fight caused the world to turn dark with splinters and branches flying everywhere.

The carapace had a great advantage due to its tough hull. It crushed the shield several times and even struck the wood giant’s chest once. Alas, it was still useless. A new shield could easily be molded and the damaged chest could close again. The wood giant was unkillable as long as the tree was fueling it with the power of life.

This frightened the supporters of Everlasting. Just Li Qiye alone was enough to suppress Silver Dragon Legion. Keep in mind that no ancestors from Longevity Valley have shown up yet.

In fact, to be truly accurate, Li Qiye hasn’t done anything at all. If he were to personally join in, wouldn’t he dominate this battle completely?

Thus, they felt regret about picking a side too early. This attempted coup from Everlasting wasn’t looking too favorable. They thought that Everlasting would be strong enough to defeat the valley, but this devilish First Brother was proving otherwise.

The representatives of the other systems watched quietly. This man from Insane Court was horrifying. He had so many strange and troublesome techniques. They were also disappointed because Li Qiye hasn’t done anything. This left them unable to gauge his true power.

The scariest thing for these systems was their inability to understand their enemy.
