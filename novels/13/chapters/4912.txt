Chapter 4913: South Emperor’s HeroismYôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A great calamity once descended with darkness. Salvation came from none other than Celestial Court and the gods.

Henceforth, it established its position as the supreme power. Emperors, monarchs, and gods gathered there and formed an unbeatable lineage.

New challengers appeared during the eras along with top conquerors. Alas, none could actually deal with Celestial Court.

Because of its prestige and authority, more conquerors and dragon lords ended up joining. This only propelled their strength.

Of course, this didn’t mean that they were untouchable. For example, The People had always put up a strong fight. Celestial Court started numerous wars and never seized a favorable outcome.

They have done so even before the calamity. They hunted the “sinners”, taking down sects and kingdoms that were protecting the branded.

In this old age, the academy had a different name. Nonetheless, it still accepted everyone without discrimination.

Celestial Court ordered them to hand over the sinners. Alas, the academy refused. The consequence was a great army marching to its gate.

It included six emperors and monarchs along with one hundred thousand cultivators. One man showed up to face them during the crisis - South Emperor.

With his sky halberd, he fought the six appointed generals and their army alone, buying valuable time for the academy.

Allies eventually came and the invaders were forced back, saving the academy from destruction.

Due to this heroic feat, a stone statue of him was built right outside the entrance.

“South Emperor, all alone, against the invaders, how domineering and wonderful.” Jian Yunyun became emotional after recalling this event. All the students knew about this tale.

Li Qiye’s attention turned toward the other statues. He then sighed and said: “What a beautiful couple.”

“You’re right, Young Noble.” Yunyun said: “They are husband and wife. We know them as Harmony Immortal Monarchs. The seniors of the academy said that if it wasn’t for their sacrifice, the academy might not be around right now.”

These two were well-known historical figures. Their statue has been observed and worshipped for eras now. They were the reason why the academy was here right now in Chaos.

During the first battle started by Celestial Court for the sake of punishing sinners, the entire world was dragged into this mess.

World Emperor, Immortal Emperor Hao Hai, Immortal Emperor Can Long, Brilliant Devil Emperor, Crimson Emperor, Darkness Heaven Emperor… None could stay away from this war.

South Emperor and the others were able to protect the academy initially. Alas, after total escalation, they had no choice but to travel to various battlefields to fight against the top masters of Celestial Court.

Ultimately, the emperors and monarchs in charge of defense made a decision to move the academy away from the upper world.

Of course, Celestial Court’s top generals didn’t let this happen and pursued. The escape path was carved with blood and sacrifice.

Harmony Immortal Monarchs fell in this battle while protecting the flank. This bought enough time for the academy to escape the grasp of Celestial Court.

The new destination was none other than Chaos. They were celebrated for eras with this statue.

“Harmony Immortal Monarchs, exchanging their lives to buy time for the academy.” Jian Yunyun bowed deeply toward the statue.

She was not the only one who would do so. After all, the couple was virtually unbeatable and could have escaped. Alas, they knowingly gave their lives up for a noble cause.

Without the sacrifice of the emperors, monarchs, and sages of the academy, Celestial Court might have taken over all six continents and enslaved The People.

“They are true protectors.” Li Qiye cupped his fist toward the statue to show the highest respect.

“Rumble!” Suddenly, explosions came from the horizon.

It was a tower soaring closer. This alerted numerous experts so they looked up.

“Immortal Pagoda from Deity.” The students said.

This was a powerful lineage started by Pagoda Conqueror, a part of Deity. It had massacred numerous sects and kingdoms from The People during the great war.

Thus, this sect was influential due to its founder’s exploits.

“Clank!” A gigantic sword showed up next. On top of the flying sword were numerous elders.

“Swordgrasp School!” A few from The Race recognized these old men right away.

“Why are they here?” Some found this surprising.

Swordgrasp was another powerful member of Deity. Most importantly, they could communicate with the two alliances on the upper continents. This was a special privilege so they served as a messenger of sorts.
