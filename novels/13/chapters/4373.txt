Chapter 4374: It’s Not Easy Being A Demon

The crowd was no longer rowdy as they watched the bear demon leave. They didn’t understand why their monarch insisted on protecting Little Diamond.

By this point, most knew about the feud between Li Qiye and Peacock Monarch. As the leader of one of the three branches, the monarch seemed to be opposing his own sect.

This left them frustrated because without the involvement of the ancestors, Goldbird Monarch was still in charge of Phoenix Ground regardless of his unreasonable stance. Thus, no one voiced their objection or it could be considered traitorous.

“Young Noble Li and the members of Little Diamond are our esteemed guests. If anyone else dares to be disrespectful, they will be punished in accordance with our sect’s laws.” The monarch gazed sharply at the crowd.

The demons couldn’t handle the intensity and lowered their head instantly. They then left the scene.

The monarch then glanced at the corpses of Sky Eagle and the others, letting out a sigh. He had expected this but couldn’t stop it because he was preoccupied with something else.

Nonetheless, this gave him more insight into Li Qiye. Why was the guy so confident? It was due to his own abilities. This was a hidden master who didn’t need any backers. Therefore, the guy was actually telling the truth.

Of course, that casual swing wasn’t much in the grand scheme of things but this was obviously not Li Qiye’s limit. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so nonchalant while staying in Dragon.

Sure, Dragon was mighty right now and unafraid of anyone. Alas, he was wise enough to also see that Li Qiye had to be strong and confident in order to be here.

In his opinion regarding an all-out battle, even a victory would be pyrrhic in nature. After suffering these losses, they would no longer be able to contend against Lion’s Roar in the future.

“I apologize for my members’ disrespect.” He invited the group back in and then apologetically cupped his fist.

Li Qiye smiled while the others returned the gesture. The latter didn’t dare to accept it from such a big shot.

“I’m sorry for being late. I was busy talking to the elders about your interest in our roost. After deliberation, we have decided to make an exception for you to visit.” He said.

This was not easy for him. The price was rather large before getting the elders of Phoenix Ground to agree.

The roost had pivotal significance and importance. Such a request from a nobody wasn’t well-received by the elders.

Normally, one of them could have become furious enough to order the destruction of this tiny sect. However, they actually agreed.

Of course, this had nothing to do with their insight and open-mindedness. The monarch made plenty of concessions for this goal. He had done everything in his power.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye smiled and didn’t care about the details.

“Right now?” The monarch didn’t expect this.

“I’m sure you’re not that confident, this is to avoid needless complication.” Li Qiye glanced at him.

The monarch smiled awkwardly after hearing this because it was indeed the case. He was afraid that an ancestor might suddenly change their mind and all of his efforts would be in vain.

“Either way, I will still keep on trying my best.” He sincerely answered.

“Sometimes, trying your best isn’t enough. There are too many stupid people, hence the reason for the destruction of their sect. More would be around now otherwise.” Li Qiye smiled.

The monarch sensed zero sarcasm in this casual comment. Alas, he could somehow see Li Qiye destroying sects and kingdoms with a smile on his face. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He had a bitter expression, aware of how unlucky Dragon was to provoke someone like Li Qiye. He realized that he was talking to a legendary existence at this point.

Alas, he couldn’t convince all the ancestors in Dragon. The thing he worried about the most might actually happen soon.

“Well, we’ll see how smart your sect is eventually.” Li Qiye added.

“Young Noble, you are a dragon soaring on the horizon, please don’t mind insects like us. Please show mercy later on.” The monarch became nervous and bowed deeply.

“At least Dragon is lucky enough to have you two.” Li Qiye said then walked out the door. The monarch took a deep breath and followed right after.

The roost was located deep in Phoenix Ground, always heavily guarded. Not to mention outsiders, even its disciples weren’t allowed entry without permission.

This was a mysterious and magical place. Rumor has it that one could obtain a fortune here. This wasn’t baseless due to the stories regarding Divine Luan Dao Lord.

She came after Myriad Eyes Dao Lord but her cultivation didn’t have anything to do with Dragon and Phoenix Ground despite being from the latter. During her youth, none of her merit laws came from the sect.
