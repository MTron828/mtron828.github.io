Chapter 5539: Paying Respect To The Deities

They came to a village with an old shrine at the entrance. There were ample incense sticks burning on the thurible and a line of worshippers.

Li Qiye jumped off Niu Fen and came inside. It was mainly open-air to let sunlight through and could only accommodate five or so worshippers.

To the left and right of the entrance were couplets. In the center was a statue with offerings and incense sticks in front of it.

All in all, the simple shrine lacked extravagance and was built from regular bricks and tiles. The pillars have turned dark from being stained by incense smoke, the same for the walls.

Li Qiye revealed a faint smile after seeing the statue depicting an old man in plain clothes and a straw hat. He appeared amiable and resembled an old farmer.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

There was a stalk of rice next to him, looking thick and large - a symbol of a bountiful harvest.

“This is our frontier’s Deity of Harvest.” Qin Baifeng, a native, introduced the statue: “The deity oversees the wind and rain, ensuring a smooth season and bountiful harvest. Most in rural areas worship him.” [1]

“I see, very helpful.” Li Qiye nodded with a smile.

“I know who he is, Immortal Emperor Di Yu.” Niu Fen chuckled.

“Do you know the deity?” Qin Baifeng was surprised.

“As far as I know, he had obtained a divine tree with the right affinity for agriculture. It is rather fitting that he’s the Deity of Harvest now.” Niu Fen smiled.

“I heard the same legend after joining Sunset Glow.” She said before approaching the statue and bowed with reverence.

When she bowed sincerely, the statue shimmered and its light coursed to the rice stalk nearby.

“Oh?” She didn’t expect this phenomenon.

The last time she paid respect was long ago, before becoming a powerful dragon lord with six dao fruits. Now, she was virtually a deity in the eyes of mortals.

“You have six sacred fruits.” Li Qiye said: “Your sincerity is equal to the prayers of ten thousand mortals. It will give this deity enough power of faith to protect the villagers.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see.” She understood the logic.

“This is Momentous Dao.” Li Qiye said: “They were amazing for learning and utilizing it effectively.”

The cloud tapped Niu Fen gently first while gesturing toward the statue.

“I cannot worship Immortal Emperor Di Yu, we are more or less acquaintances.” Niu Fen smiled and shook his head.

“If you bow sincerely, it will grant prosperity to this village for ten thousand years.” Li Qiye said.

“Will you bow too, Young Master? What will happen then?” Niu Fen tried to instigate.

“If I bow, the guy won’t be able to stay a deity, you do it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Very well.” Niu Fen couldn’t refuse any longer.

He took a deep breath, cleared his mind, and tidied his outfit. Although Immortal Emperor Di Yu was an ancient emperor, he might not actually be stronger than Niu Fen, or Calamity Dao Lord.

Since they were at a similar level, there was no reason for Niu Fen to pay respect since he didn’t need protection or a bountiful harvest.

Moreover, he didn’t grow up here and lacked the appreciation and love seen in a native such as Qin Baifeng.

Nonetheless, he still bowed sincerely to the statue - something he would never do even if the man were here in person.

After he finished the rite, Li Qiye smiled and told the group: “Let’s go.”

Niu Fen let out a roar and rushed outside. Everyone left the village afterward.

“Buzz.” A golden radiance brimming with life surged in the shrine after their departure.

It illuminated the entire village and took the form of golden grains, pouring down on all the fields. Fruits, grains, and vegetation immediately grew at a rapid rate - ready for the harvest.

This left the villagers in awe despite being used to agricultural prosperity. Because of their deity, their harvest has always been better than anything seen in the outside world. As long as they prayed with reverence, a year of abundant harvest was coming. However, this accelerated process was truly unprecedented.

“Our Deity of Harvest is visiting us, blessing us with his grace!” Some were moved to tears.

Subsequently, the village erupted in celebration with gongs and drums. They set up colorful decorations such as flowers and lanterns. They enthusiastically slaughtered livestock for a feast to worship their deity.

Of course, the prostrating villagers before the shrine had no idea that this wasn’t their deity appearing but rather, Niu Fen.

As an apex dao lord, his respectful bow was akin to the return of their deity - enough to bless them for ten thousand years.

The group arrived at perhaps the largest city in Momentous Frontier - a place with countless mortals.

Carriages and pedestrians filled the streets. Trading flourished in this city, allowing its inhabitants to prosper.

The group consisted of the mightiest cultivators. The moment they walked through the gate, they could sense that this region was one with heaven and earth. There existed a supreme sword dao all around them. This city was no different from an impregnable fortress, protected by a greater power.

“Sword City, the richest and most populated area in our Momentous Frontier.” Qin Baifeng said.

“The resting place of Daoflame Dual Lords.” Niu Fen nodded approvingly: “The couple continues to protect for eras after their passing.”

“Are you referring to the Deity of Blades?” Qin Baifeng couldn’t help but ask. [2]

“Yes, they are husband and wife, a match made in heaven.” Niu Fen nodded.
