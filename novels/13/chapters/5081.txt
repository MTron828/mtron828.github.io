Chapter 5082: Do You Want To Learn?

Anyone would be overwhelmed with despair after facing Li Qiye. The crowd knew that the previous slash was Conceal Conqueror’s best attack.

This was her finishing move, always delivering fatal results. Alas, it didn’t manage to injure Li Qiye.

When one’s ace card was this ineffective, it meant that defeat drew near. All eyes were on the conqueror - the undefeated cultivator was about to lose her streak today.

She looked solemn because this was unprecedented. Back when she fought Heavenpeak, she eventually won due to her assassination art despite being considerably weaker. With her heightened senses, she found enough openings to deliver effective blows.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye who appeared to be full of openings actually had none. He had yet to use merit laws as well, which made it even more difficult.

She thought that if he were to take action, the openings would become more apparent. Alas, he only used the dao heart so far and there was nothing for her to take advantage of.

“My turn now?” Li Qiye smiled.

The conqueror immediately entered a state of absolute focus - her prime. Her divine intents pulsed outward and enveloped the three continents.

Though she was frightened, she managed to become battle-ready in no time at all due to her impressive dao heart.

Everyone watched with bated breath and wide-open eyes, waiting to see the ultimate move.

“I’m starting.” Li Qiye thrust the broken branch forward without any mystique.

Experts and ancestors were surprised because it was another ordinary thrust. Alas, it surpassed all physical restraints such as toughness and distance.

It maintained a straight line stretching from the past to the present and to the future. It didn’t need any profundity, only moving forward endlessly.

Conceal could tell that this was another dao heart attack. Merit laws were no longer useful here. She could only fight back with her own dao heart.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Alas, she wasn’t at the level where she could muster up a defense using this enigmatic phenomenon.

“Boom!” She chose to use her seven fruits to create a wondrous shield. It contained chaos chapters and the might of the world.

“The immortal shield!” Some big shots shouted after recognizing it.

They had seen it before in the hands of Eight-stallion Dao Lord. It allowed him to be unbeatable regardless of the opponents.

She imitated the immortal shield with the help of her seven dao fruits, hoping to stop the dao heart attack.

She had gained a great understanding of the shield after fighting Eight-stallion Dao Lord so many times. Of course, it couldn’t compare to the real thing.

“Crack!” The broken branch crushed it and only slowed down a tiny bit.

The shield broke down to countless particles and time came to a halt.

“Pluff!” Everyone’s eyes opened as wide as can be. Their mind went blank after seeing the result - the broken branch piercing Conceal Conqueror’s heart. Blood streamed down and stained her dress.

This unforgettable scene would follow them for the rest of their lives - a seven-dao-fruit conqueror being pierced by a dried branch.

“Buzz.” Her seven fruits exuded chaos true energy in order to heal her wound.

However, her focus was not on the injury but rather, Li Qiye. Her eyes flashed with heated excitement. This was a hunter being pierced by the horn of her prey yet she still only cared about the wonderful nature of the prey.

The crowd, by this point, finally grasped the gravity of her defeat. Their knees buckled as they fell to the ground.

“The dao heart…” The only thing on the conqueror’s mind was the attack. Not even her life mattered as much.

“Do you want to learn?” Li Qiye suddenly asked.

“Yes.” She answered without hesitation.

“I’m afraid you can’t withstand the third.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Listening to the dao in the morning and dying in the evening, that is enough.” She answered fervently.

Some thought that they have misheard. Wasn’t this supposed to be a battle? Why did it sound like a willing master teaching an enthusiastic disciple?
