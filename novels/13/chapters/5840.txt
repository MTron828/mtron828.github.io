Chapter 5840: Patience

“Whoosh!” Once Li Qiye glanced at the incoming outburst, Stonesplitter immediately thrust for his throat.

He remained safe by still utilizing the protection of the shield, not needing any merit law or technique.

Everyone was at a loss for words. Today was their first time witnessing a battle between overlords and he didn’t leave a good impression on them with his cowardly battle style.

Skypiercer was sharp enough to pierce Li Qiye’s flesh, prompting the latter to flick the spear tip and nullify the thrust. Stonesplitter remained patient and waited again, recuperating the energy spent just now.

Meanwhile, the overlord behind the energy outburst finally descended.

“Boom!” His axe swing left a streak of bloody light, capable of splitting heaven and earth.

This blood axe horrified spectators since it was made from an untold quantity of blood essences. The area around Li Qiye was split into two halves before the axe drew near.

“So strong...” Everyone became suppressed by its power.

“Boom!” Primordial true energy coursed through Li Qiye’s hand like a waterfall as he blocked the axe directly.

Everyone finally saw the next overlord - someone possessing boundless true blood who could be the origin of all races.

They felt their ancient bloodlines were inferior to his. This included the three immortals.

“Primal Ancestor!” The trio recognized him right away. Just one drop of his blood could populate a dimension.

The name of his bloodline was Peacebringer Trinity - the purest of bloodlines. It dominated over the rest. He unexpectedly refined the bloodline into this axe, giving it incredible power and a suppressive ability.

Moreover, Primal still had ample vitality despite having refined his bloodline. It seemed to have never depleted so he wasn’t subjected to old age.

“Break!” The initial attack was one-handed, clearly not enough. He grabbed the axe with both hands and channeled more true blood into the axe.

It erupted with a fiery red glow, melting space itself and turning the world into a terrible furnace. He believed his bloodline would dominate and destroy Li Qiye’s bloodline.

As long as the opponent was alive and had blood, then the axe would be able to cut down via this connection.

While the two were locked in combat, a square tablet joined the fight, pressing down all worlds in the blink of an eye. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Nine-dao Chaos Seal!” The attacker roared, causing emperors to feel weak in their knees.

Images of the nine heavenly treasures appeared around the seal with laws rotating around them. They contained the numerous untold mysteries and powers of the world.

When used for offensive measures, he hoped that they would be enough to put an end to a distracted Li Qiye.

People got a good glimpse of him at last - an old daoist with a transcending presence. The mortal world seemed unworthy, he should be staying in an immortal realm.

Despite having lived for an epoch, his hands seemed to be carved from the best jades available. The seal felt just right in his grasp.

It appeared to be an immortal dao from the outside with the ability to derive copies of the nine treasures.

“Dao Ancestor!” His identity was obvious to all spectators. He looked independent from this world and displayed his mastery wonderfully.

Others couldn’t help feeling a sincere respect from the heart upon seeing him.

“Scram!” Li Qiye punched the seal, causing terrifying shockwaves to pulse out of Elder Galaxy. The entire epoch quaked violently as a result.
