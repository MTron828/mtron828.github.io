Chapter 5514: What Is There To Be Proud Of?

Although they had no problem and actually welcomed Li Qiye’s presence, they still became uncomfortable with his negative remark. Moreover, he had no evidence or reason.

“I do believe that this is not a trivial claim.” An older disciple said.

“If you say that we have only learned the bare surface, tell us what true mastery should be like.” A lively disciple shouted.

“Tell us!” Others raised their voice. All eyes were on Li Qiye, awaiting a response.

Qin Baifeng’s brows furrowed. She could control the crowd but this wasn’t a favorable development for Li Qiye.

She turned toward the goddess who still had a smile on her face, seemingly in no rush to do anything.

As for Shaoyun, he was glad to have the support of the crowd and became bolder: “If you can’t give us a reasonable answer, we will take your words as malicious insults and potentially a treacherous scheme, punishable ranging from kicking you out or even death!”

“Senior Brother.” The goddess’ smile disappeared after seeing his aggression.

Mu Shaoyun no longer cared for the only thing on his mind was to remove Li Qiye from the valley. With that done, he could easily crush the guy like an ant.

He arched his chest and said: “Junior Sister, am I wrong here? He came to our home and spewed insults, just removing him is already merciful enough.”

Her expression turned to anger after her words fell upon deaf ears.

“So you take pride in your accomplishment with the scripture?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I believe I have its essence within my grasp. If you are capable, then give me a pointer or two, but if you can’t articulate anything insightful, then punishments are justified.” Shaoyun said, wanting to get rid of this potential threat.

“Essence is certainly the wrong word here.” Li Qiye smirked.

The crowd members found his statement offensive. After all, Mu Shaoyun could be the third strongest cultivator in the valley. They believed that he had a strong grasp of the scripture, only losing to their senior sisters.

“Senior Brother, show him your mastery!” One disciple shouted.

“Right, broaden his horizon and make him stop thinking that we’re all incapable!” Another joined in.

Their support emboldened him, causing him to challenge: “Let’s see what you can do then. You can only blame yourself if you fail to back up your claim.”

“Go for it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Very well, activate!” He roared and became resplendent.

Rays of light exuded along with auspicious energy, culminating in the image of a boundless sunset.

This was a world brimming with energy, capable of crushing anyone standing too close to him.

“Buzz.” Runes manifested into reality and seemed powerful enough to lift the heaven. They connected and turned into thick dao laws resembling heavenly waterfalls with a red glow coiling downward.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Sunset Glow Goddess and Qin Baifeng used their grand dao power to prevent anyone else from being suppressed.

“Incredible, it’s taking on the form of an independent world, that’s grand completion, right?” One disciple shouted.

“It’s more than just grand completion.” A senior disciple said: “First Brother is a dragon lord with perfect mastery over the scripture. This is as good as it gets, enough to surpass the previous generation.”

All in all, everyone had nothing but praise for his accomplishment.

“What do you have to say now, brat?!” Shaoyun shouted at Li Qiye.

The crowd thought that his technique was impeccable. It would be impossible to point out a flaw.

“There’s nothing to be proud of, you don’t even understand where you stand.” Li Qiye shook his head after one glance at the visual phenomenon.

“You speak boldly but I’m still waiting to hear an actual response. Otherwise, I will end your dog life as punishment for insulting our sect!” The furious Shaoyun bellowed.

“Can’t he see that this is a perfect manifestation of the scripture?” One disciple said.

“Right, there’s no flaw to speak of.” Another agreed.

“Young Noble, please guide us away from ignorance.” The goddess, on the other hand, showed no sign of doubt.

Qin Baifeng remained curious, wondering if Li Qiye could actually spot any flaw in their scripture itself, not this manifestation from Shaoyun.
