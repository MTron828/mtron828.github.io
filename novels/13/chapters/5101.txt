Chapter 5102: The Race Shall Always Be Glorious With Celestial Court

In a sense, this wasn’t traitorous because the upper continents were separate from the lower continents. A conqueror had the right to choose after ascending but it was still difficult for Primal’s members to accept this.

“Ascension Conqueror.” Jian Yunyun who was watching from a distance became emotional after seeing this ancestor switching sides.

She was the future ruler of Primal so witnessing this was rather unpleasant.

“It’s common.” Conceal Conqueror said since she knew more about the situation up above. After all, she had a direct line of communication.

The allegiance in the lower continents no longer mattered once ascended. Conquerors and dragon lords were free to pick the other side. This change was often due to their unique experiences.

Now, despite being vexed by this, members of The People didn’t dare to say anything. The other side had two eight-fruit conquerors now.

“He once fought the dragon lords of Deity with his divine list. Oh, his unbeatable style back then.” An ancient ancestor recalled a beautiful memory. Now, it was a reminder of a lost time.

Now, these two conquerors represented Heaven and Divine Alliance. The Race’s members finally became excited once more after recent setbacks.

“The light of Divine and Heaven will always shine The Race!” Some regained their lofty aspiration.

“Rumble!” Laws started shooting into the air in Deity as well.

The pieces of broken pagodas suddenly came together again, rebuilt by true chaos energy. The gate returned to normal as if time was reversing.

“Ancestor!” The lucky survivors of Immortal Pagoda kowtowed repeatedly.

Another majestic figure descended after a loud explosion. Eight fruits could be seen along with six treasure pots. Each of them exuded a unique affinity and could be felt all over the lower continents.

Inhabitants heard the cries of six dragons. Their draconic auras were suffocating.

“Six-pot Conqueror!” Members of Deity shouted in excitement and ran toward Immortal Pagoda to greet this ancestor.

“It’s back!” They saw the radiant pagodas once more.

“Rumble!” A similar phenomenon occurred in Swordgrasp as well. True chaos energy engulfed the area like an ocean. The broken buildings were reassembled once more. Its foundation poured out enough power to help the process.

Endless sword energy swept through the lower continents as well, cutting off any peak that was too high. Just the sharp waves alone intimidated people.

“Clank!” They eventually came together to form a ship above Swordgrasp. A beautiful and majestic figure appeared on the deck with eight fruits.

“Ancestor!” The survivors of Swordgrasp prostrated.

“Vessel Conqueror…” An old voice trembled after seeing her.

She was once the most beautiful woman in the world, adored by all geniuses in that generation. Their hearts were broken once she left. They focused on cultivation, hoping to ascend and meet her up there.

Today, they got to see her again and they could tell that their love has yet to decrease. Unfortunately, some of them were at the end of their lifespan due to stagnated cultivation.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Four conquerors with eight fruits… that’s unbeatable!” Those from The Race jubilated, looking rather haughty again.

“The lower continents are ours!” Today was a great day in history for them.

“As long as Celestial Court is around, the world is ours!” One disciple declared.
