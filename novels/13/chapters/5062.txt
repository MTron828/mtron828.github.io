Chapter 5063: A Joyous Rabbit

“Sir.” Upon seeing Li Qiye, the old monkey got down from the tiger and came over to bow.

His movements were awkward and he used an archaic speech as if he was a newly enlightened monkey who had just learned to speak.

“You are returning to the source.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but sigh after seeing this.

“Right you are, Sir.” The monkey nodded and asked Li Qiye to sit down.

On the other hand, he squatted down since he was still used to the habit of squatting due to his current state.

Ming Shi and Tendril King came closer. The former stared at the monkey with great curiosity.

They didn’t see a divinity of a founder god from him. For example, Golden Mosquito’s divinity was impressive at first sight - clearly displaying his godhood.

On the other hand, the monkey’s divinity was actually waning. He seemed to be dispersing his power in order to return to being a true monkey.

Ming Shi remained confused but Tendril King had a different perspective due to experience and cultivation realm.

Though the monkey seemed to be degenerating, there was something inscrutable about his expression and words. He was somehow reverting back to the source, allowing him to wield the power of the original dao.

As for her, as she became stronger, she learned more merit laws and her dao power improved. This made her forget about her origin. Eventually, she would become the same as other cultivators, only stronger.

The monkey chose a different path - to reverse the effect of the dao.

“Sir, are you here to guide me?” The monkey asked respectfully like an enthusiastic student.

“What can I teach you? Even if I did, you would eventually walk on your own path again.” Li Qiye shook his head and smiled.

The monkey agreed. Despite his curiosity, he still leaned toward his own origin.

“I think I had a dream like that once…” The monkey scratched his head.

“One where you’re a dao lord?” Li Qiye smiled.

“A dao lord?” Something resurfaced for a second in the monkey’s mind before disappearing.

“You are a monkey right now but the past is still there, so a choice exists. Do you want to remember or forget your dream?” Li Qiye asked.

“Sir, can I forget?” The monkey scratched his cheeks, looking more and more like a regular monkey.

“If you want to forget, then you will forget.” Li Qiye said seriously: “On this path, you will end up where you began. Returning to the source is a way of returning to the truth of the grand dao. They are similar in principle and have the same result.”

“If you can actually reach this level, then you will forget about the past. God Ape Dao Lord will only be a dream, you shall be you, nothing else but an old monkey in this world.” He continued.

“?!!” Ming Shi and Tendril King were astounded.

There were records of God Ape Dao Lord in the lower continents. He came from a lower world and didn’t look like this back then.

They didn’t know about his exploits in Eight Desolaces and his wonderful creations - Armament Mountain and Eight Treasures Splitting the Heaven.

They were also surprised that he eventually founded a deity branch in Demon. This dao lord was once unbeatable and revered by all. Now, he resembled a common monkey.

If members of Armament Mountain were present, they wouldn’t know what to think about their progenitor wanting to revert back into a monkey.

“Well said, Sir. The path ultimately leads to truth.” The monkey instinctively scratched his head.

“Senior, why do you want to be a monkey instead of a dao lord?” Ming Shi couldn’t help but ask.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In the past, she wouldn’t dare to question a powerful being so directly. Alas, being with Li Qiye emboldened her.

“I forgot the details, but the past is nothing more than a dream.” The old monkey said.

“You have reached an incredible level, Senior.” Tendril King understood his path because she had a relative understanding of the dao and the source: “When you revert to the truth of the dao, your origin will be your dao and vice versa.”

“The dao is the dao, I am me.” The monkey said: “Can’t remember much more.”

“This is a different path, to be freed entirely in this world.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I don’t know if I should say this, but I don’t think it’s worth it. You were invincible once.” Ming Shi didn’t understand.

“All for a single wish.” The monkey said.

She clearly didn’t understand so Li Qiye interjected: “What will you do after becoming invincible?”

“Whatever I want, like running around just now, that was fun.” Ming Shi happily recalled.

“Then why don’t you just be a rabbit?” Li Qiye said: “You were born a rabbit, you can be carefree and roam in the plains without worrying about cultivation.”

“Well…” She couldn’t answer quickly enough.

“Because if you’re a rabbit, the hawk above might eat you, the same with the snakes below.” Li Qiye continued: “But what if you are strong enough to break out of this cycle, is it that bad to return to the origin, being a rabbit again?”

“Mmm…” She quietly contemplated.

After a while, she said: “What if I don’t want to be a rabbit?”

“Then you must follow a different path to reach the truth of the dao, to seek anima and become the dao.” Li Qiye said: “There is more than one path. The origin can reach the truth, the same for anima.”

“Twelve fruits to craft the perfect vessel for anima on the route to immortality.” Tendril King murmured.

She had five right now and with twelve, she could move on to the next step on the path to everlasting life.

God Ape Dao Lord did something different - wanting to forget the grand dao and his very own identity in order to reach the original truth.

This was something easier for demons compared to the other races. They had a hard time reverting back to their original state and required special methods.

Tendril King had researched this path previously but it didn’t make sense for her versus regular cultivation.
