Chapter 4045: Maid

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The members of Wooden Sword tried their best to hide their shock. Poplar Paragon would be a foreign title to regular cultivators.

However, top experts in the continent all knew the paragon - the number one cultivator of Wooden Sword.

Unfortunately, the paragon stopped appearing for a long time now. Even the ancestors of Wooden Sword rarely knew anything about the paragon’s current situation. Only the core members had an idea.

Outsiders assumed that the paragon was dead due to withering vitality and lifespan. Others thought that the paragon had been sealed and would only come out during an existential crisis for the kingdom.

Regardless of the paragon’s current state, the group was shocked to see A’zhi mentioning the paragon as a potential opponent.

They naturally weren’t a match for the paragon, meaning that they weren’t a match for A’zhi either.

They cast glances of doubt at each other. The king then cupped his fist and said: “Senior, were you acquainted with our forefather?”

“Too long ago, can’t recall.” A’zhi flatly responded, neither confirming nor denying.

The group didn’t know the answer, only that this old man was definitely stronger than them. The question was why was he under Li Qiye? Just money?

They were stuck in a difficult situation. On one hand, they wanted to teach Li Qiye a lesson. Alas, this didn’t seem to be possible since they would need to defeat A’zhi first.

The king spoke again: “Why not listen to what Ning Zhu has to say?” [1]

“Your Majesty, this is a matter of paramount importance, she shouldn’t make a decision…” The first ancestor hurriedly said.

The king interrupted him right away:” Why can’t she? This pertains to her life so she gets to pick. The sect’s authority shouldn’t infringe on the members’ freedom.”

“Little one, what do you think?” He then kindly asked the princess.

“Your Majesty, I was the one who caused this problem so I shall bear it myself. I am willing to stay. A member of Wooden Sword does not renege a bet.” She bowed deeply and said.

“Well said, well said.” The king nodded: “From now on, you are no longer a princess of Wooden Sword.”

She trembled after hearing this.

“Your Majesty!” The ancestors became anxious because she was a prized genius of the sect.

“This is her decision.” He waved his hand: “And she’s right, members of Wooden Sword will not renege. This is her fate for losing.”

“But… what do we do about Sea Emperor?” One ancestor asked.

Breaking the engagement with Peace Ocean Sword King could have serious consequences, leading to potential war.

“Since she’s going to be my maid, they can come to me if they have a problem with it.” Li Qiye smilingly interjected. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The ancestor snorted, still annoyed with Li Qiye.

The king sighed and told the princess: “Little one, there is no turning back for you. You’re no longer a princess and the sect will have to decide if you’ll stay a regular disciple.”

“I thank you for training me, Master, and the sect for grooming me. The holy kingdom is my home, I will repay this debt one day.” She prostrated on the ground, still trembling.

“Sigh.” The king said: “Take good care of yourself now.” He then cupped his fist towards Li Qiye and added: “Young Noble Li, please treat her well.”

“Of course I will treat my people well.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We’re leaving.” The king nodded at the princess before ordering the ancestors.

“Your Majesty!” The ancestors panicked but the king was already leaving. Most followed him with the exception of a few close to the princess. They talked to her for a bit before leaving to join the group.

She bowed towards these ancestors as they were departing.

Once they were gone, Li Qiye told her: “Fetch water for your first task. Do your best now.” He then returned to his room.

The princess took a deep breath and tried to calm down. This choice wasn’t easy for her today, abandoning her status as a princess and becoming a maid.

She could have resisted for quite a while because she had her own kingdom on top of Sea Emperor as her backers. Alas, her final choice was made.

If others were to know about this, they would think that she was crazy. Nonetheless, she thought that there was no point in regretting her action.

Li Qiye was laying down on his comfortable chair. The princess came into the room with a basin filled with water.

He didn’t open his eyes, seemingly asleep.

She crouched down in front of him and took off his shoes, placing his feet into the basin and earnestly washing his feet.

She had never done a chore before given her background, let alone washing the feet of a male stranger. Thus, she was slow and clumsy.

“You’re quite smart.” Li Qiye said: “But just know that one will get burnt eventually when they play with fire.”

“I don’t understand, Young Noble. I am merely carrying out my end of the bargain.” She calmly answered, no longer possessing the same pride as before.

“Really now? Who began spying on me even outside the city?” Li Qiye chuckled.

The princess didn’t expect him to know this. She composed herself and said: “I just happened to be there at that time.”

Li Qiye smiled and gently lifted her delicate chin. She looked up and met his gaze.

She was gorgeous indeed with sculpture-like features, especially her red, tantalizing lips.

“Sure, that might have been a coincidence.” Li Qiye said: “I don’t think our second meeting inside the city was.”

She didn’t respond.

He let go and leaned back down: “You’re smart enough to know who can help you. Unfortunately, you’re jumping into the pit by doing this.”

She continued washing his feet for a while before softly asking: “This place is a pit, Young Noble?”

“That depends on what you want.” Li Qiye replied: “There are pros and cons in everything. It applies in this situation as well.”

“I do not regret my choice. I am your follower now.” She replied.

“The descendant of Jade Bamboo Dao Lord is impressive. Your intelligence alone does not shame your prestigious and pure bloodline. Just know that being too smart can backfire sometimes.” Li Qiye said.

She started trembling again because he knew her true background - something misunderstood by others.

1. Ning Zhu is Calm Bamboo. It’s unclear whether this is a title or a name. It should be a title but he’s using it as a name instead of a real name here
