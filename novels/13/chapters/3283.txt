Gong Qianyue, contrary to the furious crowd, remained calm. She simply stared at him who was just sitting leisurely in his chair.

She found him to be an impossible-to-solve riddle. Everything was hidden behind a fog.

“So what do you want in case I lose?” She uttered.

The ones laughing at Li Qiye closed their mouth. They didn’t forget to throw aggressive glares and gestures at him.

“If you lose, I do need a maid to wash my feet right now. That’ll be your job.” Li Qiye looked at her with a smile.

The crowd couldn’t believe the words that have come out of his mouth. Once they regained their wits, their eyes became filled with anger. This was doubly true for her admirers who wanted nothing more than to tear him apart.

Qianyue was surprised. She thought that because of her stare, he would force her to marry him or something of that sort.

She wasn’t being egoistic in this case. After all, so many men in all of northern West King would love to marry her. Thus, her first reaction to Li Qiye’s answer was astonishment.

“Bastard, I’ll make mincemeat out of you!” The guy who stood up for Qianyue earlier had a twisted expression due to rage.

“Senior Brother Liu, he’s really asking for it, break him!” Others who were interested in her voiced their support.

The male disciples didn’t hold back on showing their distaste towards Li Qiye. Asking their goddess to be a feet-washing maid? They nearly exploded from anger after hearing this.

“Quiet down!” Qianyue had to yell at them again.

Her voice contained authority and power, successfully stopping the rowdiness. She kept on wondering about the source of his confidence.

He seemed to be certain of victory as if he could overcome the insurmountable cultivation gap. Yes, he believed that victory was within his grasp before the start of the battle.

She thought that he wasn’t putting up an act. This was his natural demeanor. She would have been able to see through him if he was only relying on his backers.

The crowd watched with bated breath, thinking that no one would be able to stop Qianyue from killing him.

Unfortunately, she didn’t make a move and simply glared at him and uttered: “Fine, I will give you time. I’ll be waiting at the examination.”

She started leaving and everyone made way for her. They lingered around for a bit; some still glared at Li Qiye, seemingly wanting to eat him alive.

Li Qiye naturally didn’t give a damn and continued to rest on his chair.

“An ant trying to take down a cultivator, can’t be more ignorant than this.” One disciple snorted.

“Haha, just wait, Senior Sister Qianyue will kill him then. She won’t need more than a second to take down an Iron Skin.” His friend added.

The guy called Senior Brother Liu had the most animosity towards Li Qiye. He got yelled at by Qianyue several times because of him.

“Junior Sister might be too merciful to kill you but I, Liu Wenyong, will finish you off eventually.” He threatened before leaving.

Meanwhile, Zhan Hu has been watching the entire time. He snorted at Li Qiye and said: “Better enjoy your remaining days because just one flame from Junior Sister is enough to turn you to ashes.”

He left, no longer wanting to cause trouble because the guy was already dead in his eyes. He knew just how terrible the samadhi flame was. Those with lower cultivation wouldn’t be able to stop her at all. Just one spark was more than enough to kill someone like Li Qiye, no need for an actual flame technique.

Others started leaving too. They hated Li Qiye more than at the start.

Prior to this, some only wanted to watch the show between him and Zhan Hu. Now, since he opposed Gong Qianyue, even the humans no longer sympathized with him.

He became the young generation’s number one enemy just like that.

The young ones from Liu Village quietly talked among themselves as Li Qiye was sleeping, unable to contain the urge to gossip.

“Who will win between Young Master and Senior Sister?” One kid asked.

“You serious? The young master will win, obviously.” A girl who adored Li Qiye beyond cure immediately answered.

“But people say that Senior Sister is the number one genius in Divine Black.” An older child who knew more became worried.

“So? The young master can do anything. He can answer all of our questions too, didn’t you hear the instructor? Nothing is difficult for him.” The girl repeated while trying to copy Fuyou’s rugged tone and gesture.

This embarrassed Fuyou standing not far away. He cleared his throat and left.

“Wait, Senior Sister will become our lady if the young master wins, right?” A cute, naive boy asked.

“You still sleepy? The young master clearly said that he only wants her as a maid to wash his feet, not his wife, okay?” The girl glared at him while emphasizing the word “maid”.

The other children nodded in agreement. People in Divine Black might make fun and look down on Li Qiye but not these kids since he had done so much for their village.

“Alright, stop chatting. Go train.” Li Qiye opened his eyes and playfully scolded them.

The group listened and immediately returned to their position.
