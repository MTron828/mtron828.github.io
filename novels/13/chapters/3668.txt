Chapter 3669: Meet Again?

The reading experience encompassed deep warmth and consideration - the same way it used to be in the past.

Jian Wenxin simply understood the Dark Crow too well. Though the letter mentioned Hongtian, it was still warm like sun rays brimming with optimism. They managed to reach all the nooks and crevices in the heart. All previous feuds have disappeared like smoke.

In history, the Dark Crow had no lack of friends and followers. Nonetheless, Jian Wenxin stood out among the rest. It was impossible to forget about her.

Mist built up in Li Qiye’s eyes while reading the letter. He sighed and actually felt rejuvenated.

He folded up the letter and murmured: “People always have attachments, to let go is also a type of happiness.”

He looked up in the sky and shook his head. He couldn’t do so because he was the Dark Crow and Li Qiye. Moving forward was his only path, not stopping.

Some in history have asked him this question - who would be able to keep him from moving on? He didn’t answer because he knew that he would never stop.

Jian Wenxin also asked him this before. In reality, she already knew the answer given her intelligence but still wanted to hear the words from his mouth.

Nonetheless, she still supported him regardless of the future. Alas, she chose to stay behind in the end.

Li Qiye also respected her choice. After all, everyone had the right to follow their heart.

“I pray that you’ll always be in good health for the eternal journey.” Li Qiye murmured and became emotional.

Perhaps this was the best result. Back in their generation, the two of them naturally had ways to prolong her life. Alas, she chose to let her lifespan run out. The line above was the last thing she said during their last meeting.

Millions of years have passed and he was still walking on this endless road. He met many people and saw different things. Alas, he remained alone; his shadow extended in a lonely manner.

The iron box didn’t only have a letter. It had another item with a great origin. Very few could recognize it.

As the Dark Crow, Li Qiye had knowledge of it since he had participated in the event but didn’t get it.

“Hongtian.” He touched the item and said: “Silly girl, the path is arduous with so much time left, no need to rush it.” He sighed with disappointment afterward.

Empress Hongtian was his pride, the most brilliant female emperor. However, he was more proud of her hellbent determination than her power.

Unfortunately, this stubbornness was also the reason why they went their separate way. It became a mess towards the end but he never hated her. Plus, it’s been so long that all negative sentiments are gone.

As someone who saw her grew up, he hoped for her to go further instead of being hindered by this issue. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Will she still hate me when we meet again?” He smiled wryly while touching the item.

The truth was that he noticed her clear markings in history. Her intent was obvious but he chose not to go. It was better not to meet until the time was right.

“Perhaps everything will end then. Silly girl, I hope you’re still doing fine.” He commented before sitting there in silence.

Today, Wish Ward became lively again because the hug mouse has been spotted.

“The mouse really appeared?” People remained skeptical.

“Absolutely, someone saw it with their own eyes.” One cultivator said.

“Who knows if it’s that mouse? It might be something else.” Another questioned.

“No, it’s the real thing. I think the national teacher of Vajra is here in person for the mouse. Unfortunately, he couldn’t find its location.” A cultivator with a good information network revealed.

“Another student from Duality saw its shadow but it was just too fast.” One youth said with regrets.

“Duality again.” People from other powers became annoyed.

“It was a student from Duality last time. Is it gonna be them this generation too? So unreasonable, stealing all the opportunities.” Someone from Divine Ghost Division complained.

“It’s not their fault.” A senior shook his head: “The mouse is sentient and smart, it is actively making a choice.”

“So we just need to catch it.” A youth thought about numerous methods to catch the mouse.

“Easier said than done.” A knowledgeable expert disagreed: “First, no one knows where it will appear and when. Its speed is comparable to a dao lord too. Don’t think about keeping up.”

“So how the hell does anyone see it?” A junior asked. He has been walking around Wish Ward without seeing any clue.

“It’s just luck. It’s still better than sitting in a room. One might see it in a corner somewhere.” His senior answered.

Everyone was going crazy to look for this mouse. If Wish Ward wasn’t powerful, they would have excavated the entire market. Nonetheless, some still tried to dig up the existing holes in secret.

“Let’s not waste time speaking. We gotta keep looking.” The appearance of the mouse actually hindered business at the ward.

People stopped going to the golden spring and focused on this new event instead. After all, Li Qiye was the only one who found anything.

“Sirs, please give it a shot, maybe you’ll be the next.” Untethered Monk became nervous and tried to stop the guests from leaving. He looked like a madame in a brothel.

Alas, this was rather futile since only a few actually lingered around.

“Boss, should we stop here and look for the mouse instead?” One worker asked after seeing the empty square.

“Stop fantasizing.” The monk answered: “You think just anyone can meet the mouse? It’s a special animal. Those capable of seeing it are exceptional with boundless potential. As for the common men? Forget about it.”

“We just want to join the fun.” The worker replied.

“What fun? No, we’re going to start a new business.” The monk said.

“An auction? Isn’t that the responsibility of the Second Manager?” The worker said.

“First, go look for some old temples with mouse holes. We’ll sell information on the potential locations of the mouse and force them to pay an entry fee.” The monk smiled.

“Uhh... Boss, aren’t we scamming people then?” The worker hesitated.

“What scam? How do you know the mouse won’t appear there?” The monk replied.

The worker actually agreed with this. No one knew the location of the mouse anyway. They weren’t exactly lying.
