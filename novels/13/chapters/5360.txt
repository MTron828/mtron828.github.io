Chapter 5361: Blinding Light

Ferocity headed for the bud with the anime dreamwater. The higher he went up the tree, the stronger the suppression.

Although the other big shots also wanted the dreamwater, they couldn’t get through the battlefield started by the two dao lords or compete against Ferocity.

“Fellow Daoist, stop right there!” A voice seemingly came from numerous dimensions above.

A figure appeared out of nowhere and climbed up to the ninth leaf, shooting out a beam capable of stopping time.

Everyone felt a second being as long as ten thousand years. Every small movement was dragged out indefinitely.

This applied to dao laws as well. Techniques and movements were all stopped abruptly. Most importantly, the beam was impossible to dodge - capable of slowing and piercing anything.

Thus, Ferocity was affected, being dragged into the temporal stagnation. His chest was the target and this could be a fatal blow.

“My dao!” Ferocity shouted at the last moment.

“Buzz.” An immortal light surrounded him. Each inch of his flesh became blessed and transparent, seemingly eternal and enough to stop the beam.

“An immortal avatar!” Someone shouted.

“He has an immortal avatar?” Another whispered, lacking information on Ferocity.

“How is this surprising? He was Supreme’s rival in the past, he probably had it since long ago.” An old dragon lord said.

Ferocity’s reputation took a dive recently after two consecutive defeats. Those lacking information thought that he only had twelve sacred fruits at best but now, he also had an immortal avatar.

The attacker has shown himself on the ninth leaf, possessing an aura resembling that of a demon god. It caused weaker beings to want to prostrate in reverence.

“Myriad Eye Dao Lord!” Many recognized him.

“The lord of Demon Dao is here.” A big shot commented.

Myriad Eye came from Eight Desolaces as well. He was a member of Dragon and joined Dao Alliance after ascending to the six continents.

He was originally from Demon Dao - a centipede managing to reach the dao. His dao was rumored to be rather unique. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Fellow Daoist Myriad Eye, you want the water too? Who else from Dao Alliance is with you? I’m down to take a group on.” Ferocity laughed and said, displaying his arrogance once more.

“I am alone, what about your allies from Divine Alliance?” Myriad Eye retorted.

“I left Divine Alliance already, and I don’t need anyone to beat you down.” Ferocity declared.

His sudden departure surprised everyone. Was joining an alliance just a game to him?

“I have no feud with you but I want this dreamwater. If you so generously choose to back off today, I will repay you in the future. Otherwise, I’ll have to be rude.” Myriad Eye said calmly.

“All of you from the prestigious sects act as if you’re the only one with money. How about this, you back off today and I’ll repay you handsomely in the future. Otherwise, I’ll cut off your dog head.” Ferocity aggressively responded.

“I see, a fight it is then.” Myriad Eye replied.

“Come, I will show you just how weak your eyes are.” Ferocity said.

There existed a stark contrast to their attitude and speech. One was polite while the other was crude. Nonetheless, both of them had no intention of backing off.

“Excuse me then.” Myriad Eye lifted up his robe and everyone had to close their eyes.

This wasn’t a matter of being blinded by intense sunlight but rather, feeling like their eyes were being pierced by countless needles all at once.

He revealed numerous eyes all over his body - the origin of his title. It might not be ten thousand eyes but one couldn’t count all of them at a glance.

A centipede didn’t have this many eyes. However, he was fortunate enough to come across this fortune and gain this special ability, paving his way to becoming a dao lord.
