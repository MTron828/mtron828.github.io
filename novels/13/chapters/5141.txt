Chapter 5142: We’re Just Fishing

A pond and the sky shared the same color. The water resembled a mirror with lightning accumulating at the bottom.

Standing next to the pond felt similar to floating in the sky. Since the stars were reflected below, it looked like people were standing on top of them.

At the depth of the pond was a lighting portal. The sheer energy there could crush a continent. The unique characteristics of this pond allowed for the birth of a divine fish.

A particular one was entirely golden and had a lightning affinity. It swam with incredible speed and looked just like a lightning bolt.

Given its plump appearance, the duo was sure that it would be particularly tasty. This was a species known as soaring divine fish - born among lighting and space.

Thus, whoever created this pond for the sake of housing this fish was surely a master.

Two men sat by the pond, each holding their own fishing pole. They enjoyed the moment, not forcing anything to bite.

The winds were particularly refreshing today and carried lightning particles. When they touched the skin, they would explode and cause a comforting numbness.

Fishing here felt the same as fishing in a galaxy - truly a scene to behold. The problem was that the pond was manmade.

A conqueror had gathered the dao of the earth and the water of the heaven to build this pond. It served as a perfect environment for soaring divine fish.

In other words, this was someone’s pond and an extremely valuable one at that.

Thus, it didn’t take long before they were spotted right away. Of course, they had no intention of being sneaky either. If they wanted to fish and enjoy the scenery, they would do grill the fish right here and now.

A horn sounded and next came metallic ringing.

“Someone’s trying to steal the fish!” An expert shouted.

“Sigh, we’re not stealing anything, this is fishing.” Jun Landu shook his head.

Li Qiye smiled and continued observing the pole.

“Who are you?!” A group rushed over; all were sovereigns and a few were Immortal Sovereigns.

“This pond belongs to Windchaser Palace, the divine fish is privately owned!” An elder shouted.

“Sir, I don’t want to fight so I leave this to you.” Landu shrugged and got behind Li Qiye to fish again.

The duo had thick skin indeed, to fish in someone’s private pond without feeling awkward.

“The worlds are privately owned by me, this pond is also mine.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“What the hell are you talking about? Are you implying that you own Windchaser Hall too?” The elder took this as contempt since Windchaser was a relatively powerful lineage.

“Well, I don’t know if I want to claim this land and the ants crawling on it as my own.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Such impudence!” The elder shouted. The others were livid because they understood his disdainful implication.

“Leave, don’t bother me.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Let’s find out who you are!” The elder reached forward.

As an Immortal Sovereign, his palm thrust was empowered by draconic lightning.

The moment his dragon claw was three feet away from Li Qiye, he couldn’t move forward any longer. There seemed to be an invisible barrier blocking the way.

“Boom!” It sent him flying afterward.

Li Qiye continued fishing without looking at the aggressive crowd.

“!!!” The elder realized that he was a powerful cultivator.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Sir, may I ask where you are from?” A youth ran over and became startled - these two’s cultivation couldn’t be assessed by him.

Nonetheless, they were fishing from his master’s pond. This seemed rather arrogant and provocative - a direct challenge to the conqueror.

“First Brother!” The disciples bowed after seeing him.

The youth was none other than a direct disciple of Windchaser Conqueror - a dragon lord with two sacred fruits with the title of Thunderspear Saint Child..

“We’re just trying to fish, you don’t need to know.” Li Qiye waved his hand again.

All eyes were on Li Qiye and Jun Landu. These two treated the pond like their own backyard.

The saint child wondered if they were here to provoke his master, hence trying to fish in the pond.

He winked at the elders who understood his intention. They commanded the disciples to be ready for battle. These foes were not to be underestimated.

Lights appeared all over Windchaser Hall along with mighty auras. Formations have been activated and Windchaser assumed its strongest defensive state.
