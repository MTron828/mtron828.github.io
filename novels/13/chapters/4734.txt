Chapter 4735: Easy Solution

World Primordial Sword could be considered a top technique even from a historical lens.

Several brilliant innate gifts gathered together in order to perform the slash with the help of the strongest weapons as well.

Among the young generation in True Immortal, everyone thought that True Immortal Saintess was the best sword user.

This notion was swiftly dispelled because the young emperor was superior. In reality, this has always been the case.

It’s just that he had always used Sagacity to defeat his opponents. Only a few knew about his mastery of the sword.

When compared to this particular slash, the saintess’ sword dao played the part of a firefly contesting against the bright moon. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Not a dao lord yet they just unleashed a slash greater than one could.” An ancient ancestor took a deep breath.

This was a noteworthy achievement - two heirs capable of producing a merit law on the dao lord level, a true testament to their ingenuity.

“Clank!” The slash divided heaven and earth then severed the yin and yang. A permanent scar was left on the spatial fabrics. The myriad dao in its trajectory would never be the same henceforth.

When staring at this slash, one could no longer see the past and the future. The victim would become stuck in an isolated space, unable to ever get out. It initiated a new cycle of life and death, only that it would end with death in finality.

Cultivators were scared out of their mind, pale. They dropped down to the ground and trembled with fear.

The true masters became alarmed as well, calculating the odds and damages if they were in Li Qiye’s shoes. Some found that decapitation would be the result.

Most importantly, the bowl was also sealing any possible escape path after he turned into a heavenly eagle.

This was a primordial power beyond the reach of mortals. Back in ancient times, just one feather from this creature could crush a mountain. Now, the great bird was flapping its wings and creating an unbreakable blockade.

Therefore, how could Li Qiye possibly dodge the slash despite his own greatness?

He decided to show them. His hands moved with incredible dexterity like a butterfly darting through a flower garden.

They strangely seemed to be coming from a different dimension, perhaps from the past or the future - not his current hands. This allowed them to make it through the eagle’s blockade.

The palms came together to form a mudra in a natural manner, perfectly catching the sword in the center.

This was akin to a divine sword returning to its scabbard in spite of its destructive potential. All of its powers were forced back inside.

No sign of dao fluctuation occurred such as laws manifesting and becoming visible. His movement was in tune with the grand dao, flowing in an imperceptible manner.

“Boom!” He then unleashed the power of the palm strikes - one capable of crushing the gods.

The clap didn’t make a single sound - the complete opposite of its devastating potential. The monarchs from the behemoths would be crushed just like a mosquito if caught.

Sure enough, the shockwaves emanating from the clap pulverized the mountain ranges nearby.

“Damn!” Cultivators finally realized what they were seeing and gasped.

Li Qiye caught the unbeatable slash with his bare hands. This was not his first time doing something like this but it shocked spectators more than the rest. If ancient ancestors were to try this, the majority would be decapitated.
