Chapter 5143: Conqueror, They’re Stealing Fish

Li Qiye ignored the barriers going up around them. This only worried the saint child even more.

After all, these two clearly weren’t afraid of them, meaning that they were at least at the conqueror level.

“Sir, may I ask why you are here? If there is anything I can do to help, I will not refuse.” The saint child bowed at the two.

Li Qiye glanced at the youth and smiled: “We’re just trying to catch the fish and grill it, nothing more.”

“...” The saint child had no response. Why did they have to come to someone else’s house to fish? In this case, the strongest lineage in the region and the pond belonging to a conqueror.

He believed that they were here to provoke his master so he bowed and responded: “My master travels the world and is not here right now. Seniors, if you have a message for him, I will be sure to relay it.”

“You’re not stupid.” Li Qiye smiled.

The youth purposely assumed the role of a junior so that these two masters wouldn’t make it difficult for him. They would have to wait for his master to return before causing trouble or it would truly be improper.

“But leave now, you don’t have any business here. We want to fish in peace.” Li Qiye added.

“...” The youth was left in a difficult position. This was the center of their sect and the courtyard of their conqueror. Was it really okay to leave them here? Windchaser Hall might be in danger.

“This palace is our conqueror’s home, outsiders are not allowed here!” An elder shouted, unable to handle this ridiculous situation.

The saint child had traveled with his master and saw powerful cultivators. On the other hand, the elders believed that their conqueror was the strongest. His home was not to be desecrated by these unwelcomed visitors.

Those daring to offend their conqueror were their mortal enemies.

“This is an unforgivable offense!” Another elder shouted.

The saint child’s expression soured after hearing the hasty comment.

“As I’ve said, we are merely fishing. Go away.” Li Qiye said.

“You’re courting death!” The elder couldn’t believe Li Qiye’s audacity and shouted.

“Boom!” He attacked with a treasure cauldron that spew out flames toward Li Qiye.

“Stop!” The saint child didn’t expect the elder to be foolish enough to attack an unknown foe after a few words of disagreement.

“Boom!” As the inferno drew near, a hand suddenly taught the cauldron, stopping its inferno before sending the elder flying. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The elder spat out a mouthful of blood and was furious. He instantly got up only to see a man wearing a brocade robe with the demeanor of a learned scholar.

Winds and clouds surrounded him and made him look taller than the sky itself.

“Master!” The saint child bowed.

“Conqueror!” The elders and disciples were ecstatic to see him and got on their knees. They feared nothing in his presence.

“Conqueror, they’re stealing our fish!” One elder reported.

“Fools!” He shouted thunderously and made everyone tremble, not daring to utter a single word.

“We’ve met again for the second time today, Young Noble and Lord Landu.” Windchaser Conqueror bowed deeply before the two.

He was alone this time; his lover was not with him.

“My sect members ignorantly ruined the mood, I apologize.” Windchaser said.

Everyone was horrified because given the conqueror’s response, these two were clearly at his level or higher. They were only ordinary disciples, so being disrespectful to conquerors might end in death.

They became drenched with cold sweat and couldn’t move an inch.

“It’s not their fault. We’re here to fish.” Li Qiye smiled.

Landu finally turned around and said: “We’re sightseeing and want to grill some fish. I thought about it and recalled the one you have here.”

“I could have prepared the fish for you if you had told me.” Windchaser said.

“Don’t try to play this game and linger around me like you did back then, it’s too much.” Landu waved his hand and said.

It turned out that these two already knew each other. This was back when Windchaser Conqueror was just a brat running around Peace Village.

He became very interested in Jun Landu, believing that this guy was the strongest hidden dragon in all the villages. Thus, he kept on asking Landu for help with cultivation.

Unfortunately, Landu refused and blocked him from coming into the courtyard. Landu’s way of life was to do nothing but live leisurely. Having a disciple would ruin his freedom.

Given Windchaser’s talent, he merely observed Landu’s dao as the guy was reading. The whole courtyard was a chance to learn the dao.

He greatly benefited and trained hard, eventually becoming a conqueror. He didn’t give up on trying to become Landu’s disciple. Alas, rejection was the answer.

Thus, the two of them resembled a pair of master-disciple or friends but were neither. Anyone else would be offended by the constant rejection.

However, Windchaser grew up in Peace - a place filled with strange cultivators. Therefore, he had no problem with Landu’s attitude.

Meanwhile, the members of Windchaser became increasingly afraid. The saint child was smart enough to send them away.

He then prepared a table with tea for them, treating them as esteemed guests.

“Splash!” Landu pulled his pole back and sure enough - the thunderous fish was finally caught.

“!!” The saint child couldn’t believe it.
