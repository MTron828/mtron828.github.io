Chapter 5585: Your Killer

“Who dares destroy my clan?!” A mighty voice echoed and drowned out all other sounds.

Listeners felt their soul leaving their body. Their lives were no longer their own. They screamed in astonishment but nothing came out.

Living beings prostrated on the ground in the direction of West Bank, as pale as could be.

“West Bank Prime Emperor!” Some recognized the voice and changed their expression drastically.

Somehow, an even more dreadful cultivator than Wang Taishou showed up. Although the clan started during the previous epoch and was fortunate enough to survive the great calamity, West Bank Prime Emperor brought it to unprecedented heights.

The clan was insignificant once but through a marriage alliance, it started becoming stronger. After the era of Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan and Immortal Emperor Fei Yang, the clan became the main fighting force against Celestial Court due to their emperor’s leadership.

Some considered him the greatest emperor when not counting the ones inside Immortal Dao City. With Immortal Dao City in apparent quarantine, only Luminous Conqueror stood equal to him. Due to his ability and dominance, his title eventually gained the word “prime”.

After Grand Dao War, Celestial Court ceased being militarily active. West Bank Prime Emperor became reclusive as well.

Nonetheless, his prestige and authority remained, enough to strike fear into the heart of his enemies.

“He’s here too?” Six-finger and Jadesword became alarmed.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Everyone exchanged glances, thinking that they were indeed the top dog right now after the closing of immortal Dao City.

Dao City was now under the protection of West Bank Imperial Clan but some might view it differently and bluntly - that they were the rulers now.

Six-finger Peak, Skysplitter Clan, and Timeworn Manor wouldn’t be able to stop West Bank from exerting absolute control over the city.

“You think too highly of your clan.” Li Qiye calmly said.

“Who are you?” A pair of eyes brimming with divinity appeared in the sky.

Their owner could see everything in the world. Mortals and cultivators felt as if they were being sucked upward, unable to do a thing.

“Please, recall your techniques!” Some tried to scream for mercy only to find the words stuck in their throat.

Just his eyes alone instilled unbearable pressure upon the inhabitants of the region.

“Skulking around still? Must I march into West Bank and crush everything first?” Li Qiye stared at the eyes and said.

“Very well, Dao Brother. Your arrogance is a testament to your power but I have been proven inferior to no one in my life. Come, let us battle. If I lose, I shall apologize. If you lose, you shall do the same and face the punishments.” The eyes disappeared but the emperor’s voice still lingered.

Listeners couldn’t believe it - the emperor issued a formal challenge to Li Qiye - an unknown cultivator.

“If I enter West Bank, it shall be no more. Since you all have contributed meritoriously in the past and I am in a good mood, I will spare it.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

Jaws dropped to the ground as Li Qiye continued to shock the crowd with his domineering attitude. Did he think that he could destroy West Bank by himself?

“Who the hell do you think you are?!” A dragon lord from West Bank was livid. He had two fiery horns seemingly capable of flipping the sky vault. His body was the size of a raging volcano, truly a sight to behold.

“Primal Demon Lord!” Many big shots recognized him - the second ranker of West Bank’s dragon lords.

This demon lord was already powerful before joining Imperial West Bank and served as a general against Celestial Court.

“Your killer.” Li Qiye said.

“Let’s see if you can!” Primal Demon Lord roared and grew considerably larger.

His curled horns thrust forward, releasing deafening blasts and destroying everything in their wake. Even ancient ancestors from mighty sects screamed in horror after seeing this power.

“Clank!” The moment they came close to Li Qiye, the throwing star pulsed brightly once.

Everything suddenly stopped and the sky was separated into two halves.
