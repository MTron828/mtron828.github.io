Chapter 5188: Just A Lotus

“Regarding the mysteries of a divine tree.” The monarch hesitated for a second before replying.

“It depends on the tree. The word ‘divine’ shouldn’t be used to describe just any common tree but people like to overuse this adjective.” Li Qiye said.

“I wholeheartedly agree.” The monarch made up his mind and tapped Li Qiye’s shoulder: “Come, let me introduce you to an old geezer.”

He acted familiar and was touchy regardless of Li Qiye’s wish. He laughed and said: “It’ll be rather beneficial for you if you can solve his problem. Keke, maybe he’ll be your backer in Imperial Attendant and plus, I won’t owe him anymore. If you can do it, just say the words and I’ll agree to anything.”

“Anything?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, do you have something in mind already? I won’t refuse as long as it is within my ability.” The monarch was a straightforward person.

“I’m afraid this might be too difficult for you.” Li Qiye said.

“What do you mean? Although I’m not a supreme cultivator, I still have ample resources up my sleeves. Just tell me what you want.” The monarch glared at Li Qiye, not appreciating the lack of trust.

Li Qiye had a faint smile as he responded: “I came to Alchemy Dao for a particular lotus flower. It’s great that you’re willing to help.”

“Which flower?” He asked.

“He’s talking about the Exalted Cascade Lotus.” The saintess quietly interjected.

The startled monarch took a second before glaring at Li Qiye: “Do you know that it is?”ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He then realized that this was a wasted question. Of course the guy knew what it was and its value.

“Yes, just a lotus.” Li Qiye said.

“Why do you want it? Pill-refinement?” He inquired further, thinking that this alchemist needed a priceless alchemy ingredient.

“No.” Li Qiye shook his head: “My courtyard has some bad luck so I need the flower to chase it away.”

“What kind of joke is this?!” The monarch jumped up and widened his eyes from astonishment.

“See, Junior Uncle, this arrogant guy is here with nefarious intent, we should capture him.” The saint child couldn’t help but interject.

“You, go find something else to do, you’re an eyesore right now!” The monarch shouted at him.

The saint child turned red as he stood there awkwardly for a few seconds. He eventually scowled and left the group.

“Are you serious about using our exalted lotus to chase away bad luck?” The monarch asked again.

“I’m serious.” Li Qiye said.

The monarch’s expression changed several times after seeing that Li Qiye was not messing around.

“Do you know how precious a single flower is and how long it takes to blossom?” He asked despite already being aware of the answer.

“It’s just a lotus.” Li Qiye said, rendering the guy speechless.

The monarch found this answer ridiculous. As far as he knew, his sect was the only one with a lotus plant of this level in all of the upper continents.

“Why do you want our lotus? Other alchemy plants can solve this issue.” He inquired.

“Yes, quite a few, such as the quaking immortal vine, abyssal golden flower, elusive draconic orchid. The problem is that they’re rather far away and this lotus is the closest.

“...” The monarch stared at Li Qiye as if he was staring at a madman.

Those alchemy materials mentioned were all wondrous. He had only heard or read about them, never seeing one in person.

“Are you really just using them to chase bad luck away?” He couldn’t help but ask the same question.

“What else?” Li Qiye waved his hand.

He felt the urge to yell at the guy for being outrageous but restrained himself since Li Qiye had displayed his knowledge prior.

These plants and flowers were virtually legendary. They should be used as inheritances and legacies for a sect, or to be refined into peerless pills. Using the exalted lotus for chasing luck away was simply ludicrous. Not even an apex conqueror could be so wasteful.

“I’m afraid I can’t make a decision on this matter.” The monarch gave up.

“It’s alright because I’m not asking for permission. I’m telling you out of courtesy.” Li Qiye smiled.

“... Are you saying that if we don’t agree, you will rob us?” The monarch stared at him.

“That’s a strong word, all I’m doing is picking a flower.” Li Qiye said.

The monarch felt the urge to yell out profanities but restrained himself. After all, he was a man of status and shouldn’t act improperly.

The lotus was one of their prized treasures and foundations. If Li Qiye were to try, the members would risk their lives to stop him.

“We do have one flower active right now but this is beyond my station. If you need it, I can help you negotiate.” The monarch took a deep breath and acquiesced.

“See, isn’t this going well? It’s hard to refuse someone courteous such as myself.” Li Qiye smiled.

The monarch didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when talking to this ridiculous man. He also wondered whether Li Qiye had enough power to take on Alchemy Dao.

Nonetheless, he was sure that the guy wasn’t crazy. He glanced at the bear and the old servant behind him - this only made the assessment more difficult.

“The negotiation requires some time, no?” The monarch said: “I will try my best to help you out but I’m unsure of the result.”

“I still have some patience, at least when it comes to your sect.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Great.” The monarch patted his shoulder again and said: “Let’s go back to our prior issue. I need your input on a problem of mine.”

“You owe someone a favor?” Li Qiye gave him the side-eye.

The monarch coughed awkwardly and said: “True, true. Hehehe, but I’m sure you will be interested in this.”
