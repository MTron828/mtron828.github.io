Chapter 4624: Worldraiser Dao Lord

Worldraiser had numerous tales, one being Blessed Dao Lord’s disciple. However, one would be mistaken to think that the dao lord had supreme talents.

In fact, this couldn’t be farther from the truth. Blessed Dao Lord had plenty of disciples and Worldraiser was completely average.

Worst of all, he couldn’t cultivate Blessed Dao Lord’s merit laws. This was unheard of during that generation.

This was rather strange because such a great being wouldn’t recruit disciples without careful consideration. His other disciples either had supreme talents, prestigious bloodlines, or something unique. They were geniuses among geniuses.

At the peak, his ten disciples were virtually invincible regardless of the time and place. They could compare to anyone in history.

Worldraiser was the exception. If he were in a crowd of pedestrians, he wouldn’t stand out in the slightest. His being recruited as a disciple was one thing, but he was even appointed as the successor of True Immortal.

This naturally shocked the world back then. Other disciples of Blessed Dao Lord and the masters of True Immortal couldn’t believe it. He could have picked any of them and they would be ten thousand times stronger than Worldraiser.

Of course, when Worldraiser was chosen as the successor, he was yet a dao lord. Some of the losing candidates became angry, thinking that this person had no right to inherit the most coveted position in Eight Desolaces.

Nonetheless, Blessed Dao Lord’s words couldn’t be challenged. None dared to disobey.

After his departure, there were a few who thought about taking over the position and or even killing Worldraiser. However, these treacherous plots ended with failure because ultimately, the majority of True Immortal still maintained solidarity.

Since Worldraiser was chosen, they fully supported and helped him rule over the sect. As time passed, the brilliant disciples of Blessed Dao Lord couldn’t obtain a dao fruit to prove themselves.

The next dao lord took everyone in that period by surprise - Worldraiser in his old age. He finally surpassed his peers and seniors then.

Future generations praised Blessed for having such wonderful insight, to be able to recognize Worldraiser’s ability to become a dao lord. No one else could have made the same choice.

Another lesson to be learned was perseverance. Worldraiser was an underdog his whole life but managed to succeed in the end.

This gave cultivators hope for the future. After all, geniuses were rather rare and always overshadowed common cultivators. The tale of Worldraiser sparked hope - that as long as one tried hard enough, they could become successful in due time. This was the right choice instead of giving up early on.

“True Immortal really has too many dao lord merit laws.” One spectator became envious and whispered while staring at the genius’ radiance: “All talented disciples have a chance to learn one. Even a third-gen disciple like him has access to this ultimate scripture.”

Their envy was understandable. Back in their own sect, a dao lord merit law was the prized treasure and a top secret. Putting the upper echelon aside, only those with peerless talents or official successors were qualified to learn them. Moreover, they would only learn a particular technique, not an entire scripture.

This wasn’t the case for True Immortal, hence everyone becoming emotional. They fantasized about joining True Immortal.

“If you insist on being stubborn, don’t blame me for being merciless.” True Immortal Spirit uttered.

“I hope you’ve bought yourself a coffin already since you seem to be suicidal.” Li Qiye waved his hand again.

“He speaks as if he has full confidence in victory.” A young listener whispered.

“Well, he took down one of their geniuses so far. It’s not an empty threat.” A big shot answered.

The crowd recalled Six-winged Emissary. He was a direct disciple of their sect master and shouldn’t be that much weaker than True Immortal Spirit.

“We’ll see about that.” True Immortal Spirit’s expression became austere.
