Chapter 4251: Chrono Lantern

The temporal affinity embedded in the sword couldn’t be fathomed and was capable of corroding all forces.

Therefore, nothing could even reach Li Qiye before being reduced to dust. The duo realized that keeping this up was detrimental and time would steal their lifeforce soon enough.

“Explode!” The two exchanged glances and immediately understood the next step.

Their fate palaces opened and longevity blood gushed out and formed maelstroms. Shock waves swept for ten million miles.

“Boom!” The explosion wielded enough power to destroy all of Sword Continent.

Exploding one’s longevity blood was reckless since this type of blood was extremely precious. Each drop contained an immense lifeforce, ranging from one year to ten thousand years…

This was especially true for apex existences like the duo. In fact, they most likely viewed a single drop as more precious than a top treasure. After all, their age was up there already.

Nonetheless, their decision to use this type of blood showed just how serious they took this fight, wanting to go to the very end.

The rampant explosions from the blood drops fueled their techniques to the limit. Lightning bolts suddenly detonated in the sword rain while the vajra’s fist became increasingly domineering.

“Ahh!” Spectators were smart to be extremely far away. Alas, those closest were still reduced to blood, prompting others to flee far away.

Li Qiye’s single sword resembled a tiny boat lost in a tsunami. Li Qiye smiled and shouted: “Chrono Lantern.”

A spark from Myriad Era illuminated the temporal fabrics across the realms. Of course, the duo’s moves were also affected by the net.

The powerful sword momentum and fist energies along with the endless vitality served as their fuel burst into flames due to the spark.

“Rumble!” In the next second, the raging flames incinerated everything about the duo. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ahh!” They bellowed in pain since their activated power caused a backlash and sent them flying while vomiting blood.

Spectators gasped and screamed after seeing this. They saw the duo aging rapidly, seemingly becoming thousands of years older.

Wrinkles took over their face; their hair became as white as snow. They resembled two grandpas on their deathbed.

No one said anything since they were trying to digest this development. They viewed the overlords as the strongest ancestors. Two of them fighting together should be nigh unbeatable.

Alas, Li Qiye alone utterly defeated them. No one would have predicted something like this previously.

“They lost…” Most had no choice but to accept this unbelievable reality. This was especially true for those aligning themselves with Nine-wheel and Sea Emperor.

“They exploded their longevity blood, how many years did they lose just now…” An expert took a deep breath.

The two overlords were old already, who knows how much longer they had left?

“That’s not the only thing. Their vitality and blood were burned by Myriad Era too, maybe seventy to eighty percent.” An ancestor explained.

Others realized that the duo no longer had that long to live even if they were to leave this place alive after defeating Li Qiye.

“Myriad Era’s temporal mastery is invincible.” A high elder shuddered.

“Time is the most terrifying force in the world.” The big shots turned pale.

Merit laws and techniques could be stopped or nullified. Alas, time was extremely hard to deal with.

It was flowing around Li Qiye’s sword and its dao. How could anyone bypass this?

“So this is the number one blade out of the nine.” Others stared enviously at Li Qiye’s weapon.

They thought that if they had this sword, they could also defeat the two overlords just like Li Qiye.
