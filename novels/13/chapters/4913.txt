Chapter 4914: Wealth Incites Greed

Jian Yunyun became startled to see the two sects because Deity was far from the academy. It was located in White Stone, not Chaos.

Moreover, Deity served as a representative of Celestial Court and was governed by the two alliances.

On one hand, the academy recruited everyone. Even members of Deity could become students here. However, the lineages on the other side knew to lay low when visiting the academy.

This was an unspoken rule in the lower continents. After all, in the present days, the sects and clans had children and successors studying here. In fact, maybe even their progenitors and ancestors were alumni.

Thus, they always gave face to the academy or there would be public backlash. Therefore, this aggressive approach was rather strange.

Those from Deity in Abroad wondered why their sects were showing up right now.

“Something big is going on.” Jian Yunyun quietly said.

Though she has only just gotten back and didn’t know what was going on, there must be a reason why these two sects were so arrogant.

“Let’s go in first.” She brought Li Qiye into Abroad Hall.

As they were walking in, a student rushed out and nearly bumped into Li Qiye.

“Sorry, sorry.” He immediately apologized. He looked around the same age as Jian Yunyun.

At first glance, he looked average but upon closer inspection, there was a metallic quality to his skin. It was as if knocking would result in a clank.

Once enough attention was spent on him, they found that there was a hidden hint of nobility and regalness.

“Brother Bai.” Yunyun recognized him.

“Miss-, no, Lord Jian.” He greeted Yunyun.

“Don’t tease me, Brother Bai, I am only a disciple of The Alliance.” She shook her head.

“That’s not my intention at all. I’ve heard that you will inherit the position.” He said before bowing sincerely: “Please don’t be too sad about Senior Black-dress.”

“Thank you.” She then introduced him to Li Qiye: “This is a friend from Abroad, Bai Shaojin. He is definitely a top student here.”

“My meager skill is nothing, Miss Jian.” Bai Shaojin smiled wryly: “I am but a firefly compared to the supreme geniuses. Who is this gentleman?”

He stared at Li Qiye and didn’t notice anything special. Of course, Abroad was full of both geniuses and regular mortals.

However, Yunyun might not be a supreme genius but she was still famous. Moreover, she was the successor of The Alliance, meaning that she could rule Primal later on. It was strange that she would be hanging around a regular student.

Yunyun hurriedly introduced Li Qiye to him. Li Qiye then asked: “Where are you from?”

“Brother Li, my clan is only a tiny sect not worth mentioning. My ancestors might have been great but I do not dare to bring them up since we descendants have let them down.” Bai Shaojin said humbly.

“Right, just remember to be careful of others’ greed.” Li Qiye smiled.

Bai Shaojin had a strange expression after hearing this. He then told them: “Friends, I have to report Swordgrasp and Immortal Pagoda’s sudden visit to the seniors. Excuse me.”

He left in a hurry so Yunyun frowned and asked: “Be careful of others’ greed?”

Li Qiye didn’t explain and said: “What is his last name?”

“Bai, of course.” She thought that the question was unnecessary.

“That’s not his last name.” Li Qiye casually responded and moved on.

She was surprised for a moment before giving chase: “Not Bai? What is it then?”

Li Qiye strolled onward without answering.

This place was large with tens of thousands of palaces. It had no problem accommodating several hundred thousand students.

The student demographic was extremely diverse from both The People and The Race. It didn’t have a clear social hierarchy either.

Though the academy didn’t place any restrictions on them, there were still certain rules while staying here. Equality was an important focus.

Nothing was missing in this massive city. Some students opened stalls to sell merchandise and treasure. A few had banners to announce their desired items.

This place was brimming with life, something more than just an educational institution.

Many greeted Jian Yunyun along the way. After all, she was considered a top dog in Abroad.

Her talent and cultivation were certainly exceptional. However, her prestigious status was even more important.

Some students saw her walking together with Li Qiye and started gossiping. They definitely looked out of place.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yunyun didn’t mind since this was a part of the young culture in Abroad.

“Big Sis, you’re back.” A girl appeared before them, looking awfully excited.

She was younger than Yunyun and wore an elegant lotus dress. Spirit energy flowed around her. Her clear eyes were round and white, truly a sight for sore eyes.

“Princess.” Yunyun greeted.

“If you call me Princess, I’ll have to call you Alliance Lord.” The girl pouted: “I told you, call me Ming Shi.”

She was a fast speaker and this made her cuter.

“Okay, Ming Shi.” Yunyun yielded.

The girl then winked at Li Qiye and asked: “Hehe, are you Yunyun’s boyfriend?”

“Boyfriend? Don’t spread rumors now.” Yunyun didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Ming Shi defended herself: “I’m not the one spreading rumors, I’ve heard that you have brought a boyfriend back this time.”
