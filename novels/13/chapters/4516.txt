Chapter 4517: Solo Auction

Alchemy Child’s threat during an auction didn’t win him any love from the crowd. For the big shots, doing so was despicable and unbecoming of their status.

Nonetheless, Alchemy Child was far from a big shot. To put it nicely, he was a trusted aide of the young emperor. To put it bluntly, no more than a mere servant in the grand scheme of things.

Therefore, he could say whatever he wanted without besmirching his reputation and status for he had none. It wouldn’t affect True Immortal’s reputation in the slightest.

On the other hand, he was a special servant due to his master. He could whisper to his master and be rather influential.

After thinking this through, some big shots understood why the young emperor sent him as a representative.

If anything were to go awry or improper, the young emperor could just say, “he was only a servant”. Moreover, Alchemy Child could still intimidate others using the sect without suffering proportional backlash.

“Having to resort to threat, I see. Is this what True Immortal does to win an auction?” Jian Ming asked.

“Provoking True Immortal, boasting shamelessly, and maliciously slandering my young emperor are all unforgivable sins deserving of death. Be aware of your precarious circumstance and change your way. Otherwise, my sect will annihilate you.” Alchemy Child switched the topic from the auction to something else.

No one here was a fool so they naturally understood his intention - wanting Li Qiye to back down from the auction.

On one hand, they didn’t want to lower their status by arguing with a servant. On the other hand, this servant was actually influential enough to carry out the threat.

“So many words only to say that your sect is too poor to compete. Our young noble has no time for the likes of you.” Jian Ming said with disdain.

“40,000,000. Keep it coming.” Li Qiye waved his hand and urged the auctioneer to hurry up.

“40,000,000, going once.” The auctioneer shouted.

“41,000,000.” Alchemy Child gritted his teeth and made another bid. He would need to ask for permission in order to go any higher.

“50,000,000.” Li Qiye casually responded. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Alchemy Child felt as if he had just been slapped in the face repeatedly after hearing this.

“50,000,000, going once.” The auctioneer said.

“Just give me a second.” Alchemy Child had no choice but to go communicate with his master.

“60,000,000.” It only took him a moment to return. He immediately made a generous bid.

It seemed like True Immortal was going to go all the way for this immortal grass. Most importantly, the young emperor didn’t want to lose to Li Qiye.

“While you were gone, Young Noble Li has bid against himself. It is 100,000,000 now.” The auctioneer revealed.

“...” Alchemy Child’s expression couldn’t be described with words. He successfully convinced his master to grant him a higher limit. Alas, Li Qiye has beaten him even before he got back, shattering his confidence and leaving him breathless.

This was akin to a cultivator breaking through to the next realm during a tough battle. They believed that they would be able to stomp on their foe now. Alas, what happened next was a swift defeat. This could drive someone crazy.

Alchemy Child’s eyes turned red, seemingly wanting to feast on Li Qiye’s blood and flesh.

“He actually bid against himself.” The big shots smiled wryly while shaking their head.

There wasn’t a rule against this because it meant more revenue for the auction house. Why wouldn’t they allow it?

In this case, the raise was sheer lunacy. All of their preparation was for naught when someone like Li Qiye was around.

100,000,000 was a ridiculous price even for a mature Shaking Immortal Grass. No lineage would do something so silly.

“He’s a madman.” This became the common opinion of Li Qiye.

“Did you hear that? 100,000,000. But judging by your destitute style thus far, I don’t think your sect can gather this much, just give up.” Jian Ming, the sycophant, continued his act.

Alchemy Child started shaking in rage; his face was as red as can be.

“I’m clearly provoking your sect right now, what are you going to do?” Li Qiye asked with a smile.

The big shots exchanged glances after hearing this. Few would dare to state this publicly and trivially.

“Where is he from? How is he so confident?” One of them whispered.

Alchemy Child felt blood streaming up his throat from anger but he couldn’t do anything about it.

“100,000,000. Sold.” The auctioneer slammed his hammer, signaling the end of an uncompetitive auction.

“The next item is very special.” He handed the item over before introducing the next: “It is from an immemorial lineage known as Seven Martial Pavilion.”
