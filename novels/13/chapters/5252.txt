Chapter 5253: Finest-grade Time-honed Pills

Those in the palace feel their blood surging in a pleasant manner. The older cultivators thought that they were returning to their prime, that their vitality was roaring like dragons.

“The time-honed pills are nearly finished.” One of them commented.

“More than that, these must be at the finest grade, never seen since Heavenly Sage Yuan’s era.” An ancient ancestor who had eaten these pills before said.

“Boom!” The tribulation finally descended with bolts aiming straight for the conqueror.

“Open!” She became alarmed and had no choice but to face it.

Her cauldron opened and all the pills flew out with the speed of stars. She immediately summoned a special bottle and roared: “Come!”

This pulled all the pills into the bottle and she closed the lid, signaling the end of the refinement process. The tribulation also dispersed since the cauldron was no longer active.

As she held the bottle, she saw the colorful light flowing on the exterior, realizing that she had just refined a finest-grade longevity bottle.

Of course, she knew that this wasn’t because of her own ability, hence her look of astonishment. She regained her wits and started remembering the alchemy dao earlier along with the flames. Given her comprehension, she immediately understood more about the art of pill refinement.

“There is no other bottle like this one.” The crowd stared intensely at the bottle in her grasp. Ancient ancestors, in particular, salivated at the thought of increasing their lifespan.

“The finest grade.” Suppression’s heart started beating faster since he was getting up there in age. Despite his exceptional cultivation, aging was still inevitable.

“Welcome back, my emperor, and thank you for enlightening me with your alchemy dao.” Jadecure stopped thinking about the dao and kneeled before Li Qiye.

Li Qiye nodded and accepted the gesture while everyone else couldn’t believe their eyes.

“So there is an emperor for Imperial Attendant?” A big shot murmured.

“Well, the name makes sense now.” Someone else responded.

Putting aside Resplendent Monarch’s claim and support, Li Qiye had done something no one else could with the exception of City Lord Zi Yan.

This alone proved that he was part of the orthodox branch, qualified to sit on the throne.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Eyes turned toward Suppression Conqueror who had a rather frightening expression. He eventually said: “Fine, so be it. Congratulations, everyone, you have won this duel. Imperial Attendant is yours once more.”

He had nothing to say after losing the alchemy duel. According to the rules, it was time to return sovereignty back to the orthodox branch.

The guests appreciated this man who was true to his words. A conqueror could accept losing in a graceful manner. Few could make it to his level while having a narrow-minded perspective.

“Thank you, Conqueror.” Jadecure and the others said respectfully. Although they were enemies who were willing to kill each other, they still played by the ancestral rules.

Suppression gazed at Li Qiye and said: “My Lord, can you truly control everything in Imperial Attendant?”

“Your ambition has no limit but you should know when to give up before it is too late. Run while I’m still in a good mood.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

The crowd took a deep breath. This was not Li Qiye’s first time showing contempt for the conqueror. Would he be able to endure the unceasing humiliation?

“Hahaha, I have never been afraid of anyone my whole life. There is no question about your unfathomable abilities but I must still see them for myself.” Suppression laughed and said.

Imperial flames oozed out of his eyes and caused loud detonations. The grand dao harmonized with him and dao laws shot up into the air like reversed waterfalls. His empowered state made him look like the ruler of the cosmo.

The city appeared tiny in comparison, the same for the stars above. They were mere specks of dust existing in his world.

Living beings dropped to the ground, unable to handle his activated grand dao. This applied to dragon lords with four or five sacred fruits as well.

It seemed that just by channeling his strength a tiny bit, he could crush the entire world. Everyone would be destroyed before they could scream.
