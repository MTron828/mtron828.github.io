Chapter 4845: Any Last Words?

The winds blew while the combatants remained still. This was far from being their first encounter.

These two mortal enemies had fought numerous times. It started with the ascension of Eight-stallion Dao Lord shortly after the death of Heavenpeak Conqueror.

In history, The Race and The People were locked in perpetual conflict, albeit milder in recent times.

Nonetheless, when the dao lord ascended, he eventually attacked Deity Lineage by himself. This might be the strongest dao lineage in the lower three continents. It was situated in White Stone Continent and had the backing of Celestial Court. It seemed to be the leader of the lower realms.

Moreover, Conceal Conqueror’s successful ambush was rather recent. The other lineages had a hard time keeping up.

However, Eight-stallion was unbeatable and forced Conceal to fight him. The latter’s injuries weakened her so she retreated. In the end, it took the combined might of Deity’s ancestors to force Eight-stallion back. Their feud started at this point.

Due to her incredible talent, she was able to cultivate two dao fruits at the same time, initiating her hunt.

Eight-stallion fought valiantly while knowing the right time to retreat. During a near-death moment, he obtained a second dao fruit. This was still far from enough so he eventually had to hide in the outskirt, spending all of his time training. With the third dao fruit, he returned to Chaos.

She immediately started the hunt once more after being aware of his arrival. Their ensuing battles caused massive destruction and stirred the audience.

The ferocious conqueror nearly killed him several times but through sheer luck, the dao lord somehow obtained the immortal shield.

The tides were reversed and Conceal became the hunted instead. He took the battle to Deity once more. This time, he didn’t hold back on the killing.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Deity had no choice but to go all-out. Their reclusive and slumbering ancestors woke up in order to suppress him. This battle lasted a long time; the dao lord couldn’t be beaten due to the immortal shield. Finally, he left triumphantly after reaching a stalemate. All eight continents heard of his title afterward while he became dominant in Chaos.

Conceal focused on cultivation after this humiliation. Given her resources and talent, she obtained three more dao fruits, becoming the strongest conqueror in the lower continents. Celestial Court gave her its blessing and approval afterward.

She challenged her rival again but due to the immortal shield, she couldn’t defeat him. This was her last challenge until the present.

As for Eight-stallion, he focused on stabilizing Chaos instead of pursuing her. He started a dynasty there and brought about peace.

Of course, “peace” was rather relative. Nonetheless, the last millennium has been a blessing to the people compared to the previous eras.

During this time, Conceal cultivated her seventh dao fruit, solidifying her status as the strongest once more.

The two of them were strong enough to travel to the upper continents and join their respective alliance. Alas, they decided against this to everyone’s astonishment.

“A dao lord versus a conqueror.” A sovereign said quietly.

This wasn’t that rare in history. Both types cultivated by gathering dao fruits. It’s just that dao lords came from the lower realm.

As for the origin of conquerors - this happened a long time ago in the legends. A vine appeared in the primordial chaos and with one word, it became a conqueror. From then on, conquerors became a potential realm in the eight continents.

“Long time no see.” Conceal’s tone showed no emotion. Nonetheless, spectators and ancestors took a deep breath, feeling as if a sword had just pierced their bones.

The way she looked at him was as if she was looking at a corpse. Everyone knew that the dao lord’s chance of victory was slim to none.

When they both had six dao fruits, he was still the underdog. Now, she had seven while he lost his immortal shield. This battlefield would be his grave.

“You’re as beautiful as before.” He still felt like flirting despite the grim situation.

“Any last words?” She uttered coldly.

“It’s too early for that. Plus, even if today is my last day, I have lived a fulfilled life and want nothing more.” He smiled, as heroic and carefree as ever.

“Hand over the item and I shall spare your dynasty.” She threatened. Her chilling aura seemingly froze the entire battlefield. Spectators had a hard time withstanding the biting chill.

She was frightening indeed, completely different from other dao lords and conquerors. Some ancestors and experts here have seen her peers before. They had suppressive pressure as well but not anything comparable to her murderous intent.

“The item I do not have, only my life.” He laughed, immune to her bloodlust.

Regular cultivators didn’t think much about the conversation but ancestors became emotional. This wasn’t only a duel to settle their feud. He had something she desired.

At her level, she had seen all treasures and merit laws before. She herself had the supreme dao fruits. Few things could actually tempt her so what could this item be?
