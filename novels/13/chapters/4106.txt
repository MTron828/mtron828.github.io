Chapter 4107: True Immortal On The Dao Path?

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Eventually, the conversation came to an end. The voice said: “The path towards the grand dao is endless, be well, Dao Brother.”

“Yes, we’ll meet again one day.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Though I haven’t met him, I heard that he came to a place known as Cloud Dream Lake and was challenged.” The voice revealed.

“Cloud Dream Lake? Looks like there’s a reason for going there.” Li Qiye said seriously.

“It’s impossible to know the details of the battle but since he went on the move again, the outcome is rather obvious.” The voice said.

“It’s just scouting.” Li Qiye said: “People will always be curious and give it a shot.”

“Nothing good can come from it.” The voice said: “At the very least, I’m unaware of anyone escaping unscathed. Though he rarely took action, he crushed every fight. That’s why he is still standing till now.”

“Right, never lost before.” Li Qiye smiled: “Because of this, he keeps on searching on the long path, otherwise, losing is inevitable.”

“Who can do it? The impossible.” The voice said. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“This is the crux of the issue. Defeat is necessary to gain more information.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t think more will try, it’s a grim endeavor. The outcome is known before the start of the battle.” The voice said.

“There will always be an end for everything, whether good or bad.” Li Qiye said: “Even the villainous heaven is no exception, it’s only a matter of time.”

“I hope it will be a good end then or the future shall be very grim.” The voice said.

The intangible nature of karma didn’t matter to mortals. However, the top existences cared about it. With a cause came a reason, with a beginning came an end.

Top existences have lived for billions of years but eventually, there would still be an end for them. It was impossible to calculate regardless of how much time they spent.

Occasionally, some of them might try to interfere or even change their karma. Unfortunately, it was difficult to assess the effectiveness.

Nonetheless, they all knew that something inevitable was coming - destruction far more terrible than any of the previous.

Not to mention the regular living beings, they themselves wouldn’t be able to get away. This seemed predestined by a higher power. They chose to bide their time patiently and silently, waiting for the inevitable day.

“It’s all the same.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “It’ll just be the final point for everyone. No one will be able to break out of the cocoon. From their end comes the start for the next, this is just an endless cycle.”

“But maybe it’s different for a true immortal.” The voice said.

“The world will cease to exist when there is a true immortal around. Karmas will not have any effect on one.” Li Qiye said.

“All living beings will die then.” The voice said softly.

“Since when do you care about living beings? I don’t think anyone does, only when it affects their karma.” Li Qiye said.

The voice didn’t respond. Characters of their level stood at the apex of three thousand worlds. They looked down at regular people and only saw ants. That’s why they continued the cycles with no regard to the loss of lives.

“Well, let’s get back to business. You have caused quite a commotion outside.” Li Qiye stretched and said.

“Dao Brother, you know what I am, just a bit gluttonous, that’s all. The brat did leave me a few things before escaping but too much time has passed and I’m hungry for anything, even scrap metals in your eyes.” The voice became a little awkward.

“Right, but since I’m somehow involved in this mess. Let them go, I’ll be taking a trip later and will bring you along, your appetite won’t be a problem then.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“I shall listen to you, Dao Brother.” The voice responded.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” Back in Armament Mountain, the disappeared disciples returned and rolled on the ground. They eventually woke up again and looked around.

They noticed that they were perfectly fine and became both happy and frightened.

“Everyone’s back! They’re doing well too!” Others celebrated.

The victims had no idea what happened. Everything remained a mystery to them. Their eyes had turned dark and then they couldn’t remember what happened afterward.

“We’re saved…” Shi Yingxue was ecstatic, realizing that she had found the right person. Losing the ancestral peak was worth it since she saved the rest of the sect.

The black maelstrom gradually dispersed as well. The grand formation and the two dao lord images also disappeared.

Li Qiye landed in Armament Mountain and was greeted by Shi Yingxue and other disciples.

“It seems like Li Qiye saved them, how bizarre.” Outsiders found this astonishing.

“This is full of mysteries, I’m sure it has something to do with the Tang.” One ancestor speculated.

“What do you mean?” Another asked.

“This whole disaster might have originated from the Tang. Let me elaborate, I believe the foundation of Armament Mountain might be built on top of the Tang’s ancestral land. However, both Armament and the descendants of the Tang had no grasp of this ancestral land’s mysteries and profundities, this disaster was a side effect. On the other hand, Li Qiye knew more than everyone else including a method to stop the maelstrom… “ The ancestor explained.

Everyone agreed with this since Li Qiye had control over the grand formation of the Tang. They also thought that it was interesting how an outsider managed to take over this wondrous land.

“How did the Tang not have a clue after millions of years? An outsider knew more than them.” One expert asked.

“Who knows, maybe there is a connection here. The progenitor of the Tang used to be really rich, Li Qiye is the same way. Maybe the latter obtained his legacy.” One big shot said.

“That might explain why Li Qiye has mastery over the plain.” Another agreed.

They thought that Li Qiye was somehow connected to the progenitor of the Tang. That would explain everything.
