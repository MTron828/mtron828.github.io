Chapter 5464: Can’t Even Be An Appetizer

Li Qiye then raised one leg up; the stars and the world itself moved to his rhythm. It became the only thing that mattered in the universe; nothing else had the same grip.

Myriad laws and mysteries of the dao became mere specks of dust before his foot, being lifted up as well. Spectators had the illusion that this was the foot of heaven and earth.

“Boom!” He stomped at the suppressive momentum of the tower and hook.

They were made from incredible metals and treasures, currently empowered by numerous capable cultivators. Their momentum empowered by the formations couldn’t be underestimated; no single soul could muster this level of power. This was the pinnacle of teamwork and resources - the highest achievement of cultivation in the upper continents.

A multi-colored radiance erupted as all of the power in the artifacts tried to stop him. The combined effort through many generations of Heaven and Divine Alliance broke down in the blink of an eye.

Everyone else in charge of the formation was smashed down to the ground as well, resulting in broken bones and heavy loss of blood.

They felt as if they were ants being stomped down by a merciless human, unable to resist. They groaned in pain while enduring the pressure.

Spectators from a distance trembled in horror. Although they were fortunate enough to not be the target of this cosmic force, they still ached all over and had a hard time breathing. Their legs buckled as they witnessed this spectacle.

Supreme and the others eventually got up. The shift in pose caused them to vomit blood but putting physical injuries aside, their confidence was shattered by the stomp as well.

Everyone could tell that he would have no problem killing all of them in just a second. The disparity in power was insurmountable. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

How many alliance members still had the courage to face him? Death didn’t deter them at first. However, their dao heart was crushed now, leaving them with nothing but despair.

Struggling was useless. Their lifelong achievements with the dao were not worth mentioning; all of their hard work became meaningless.

Supreme and Immortal Pagoda turned pale. The two of them have dominated for so long and had entered Celestial Court before.

Nonetheless, they were certain that Li Qiye was the strongest existence they had seen thus far.

“Is this it? Not enough to be an appetizer.” Li Qiye said, pouring salt on the wounds of his opponents.
