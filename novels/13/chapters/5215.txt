Chapter 5216: Just Taking A Look

There were a hundred murals or so, believed to be painted by the wise sages of Imperial Gate. Their purpose remained unknown and birthed numerous speculations.

Current cultivators thought that they hid the mysteries of the grand dao. The sages had imprinted their knowledge into the murals, so learning them was akin to learning Imperial Gate’s supreme manual.

Imperial Gate did not open this place to the public before Suppression Conqueror took over. Nonetheless, it was still guarded by guards in golden armor. Each mural had its own group of spear-wielding patrols.

These cultivators were part of a unit under the leadership of the Divine Hawk Monarch. Most of the areas in Imperial Gate were within their jurisdiction.

“Senior Uncle told me that murals depict a legend, I don’t know if it’s true or not.” Shao Yao whispered.

Li Qiye was immersed in the murals. The engraving skill was perfect but the same couldn’t be said about the content.

Some had few lines; others were extremely chaotic or complex. This was why they were thought to be merit laws.

As for Li Qiye, he could see that they were all related to a single person who had traveled across the nine worlds and thirteen continents - him!

Of course, others lacked the foundational knowledge so it was all a mess in their eyes, unable to figure out the starting point.

Li Qiye appreciated the fact that many were still keeping him in their heart. All of these secrets were passed down for eras. This was akin to reading a tale about himself. Memories of the past resurfaced again.

As Li Qiye observed the murals, Shao Yao observed Li Qiye. When she looked back at the murals before them, she suddenly felt as if the simple lines look rather similar to Li Qiye.

She regained her wits and thought that this was ridiculous. It must be due to her crush, making everything remind her of him.

As the two went on their way, others from all over the world did the same thing. They hoped to learn the legacies left behind by the wise sages of Imperial Gate.

At this time, one particular mural got Li Qiye’s attention. He became sentimental and touched it in order to feel its timeless aura - a way to connect with the past.

“Watch it!” A guard from Divine Hawk shouted.

“This place is not Hundred Dao’s property, it is still our Imperial Gate.” Saintess Shao Yao retorted. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“We have assumed control and make all the decisions now.” The guard strongly asserted.

Li Qiye smiled and said: “Return from whence you came before risking sect destruction.”

The guards nearby became alarmed and instantly looked in their direction. The audience nearby did the same.

“Who is this guy?” One neutral spectator whispered. This was a direct challenge against Hundred Dao and Suppression Conqueror.

“Who dares threaten Hundred Dao?” A youth walked over with a murderous temperament. His aura was of the fierce avian nature and intimidated everyone.

“Divine Hawk Monarch.” The experts nearby understood that he was the commander of the guards.

Li Qiye didn’t bother to look at him, still focusing on the mural.

“Miss Shao Yao, is he your friend?” The monarch saw the saintess and inquired.

“Yes.” She responded.

“I heard his bold statement earlier, I wonder if he can back it up.” The monarch said, ready to fight.

“I do not wish to kill here, be smart and scram.” Li Qiye said with contempt, clearly challenging Hundred Dao’s authority.

“Well, let’s see what you can do then.” The monarch took one step forward.

“It’s best that you listen to Young Noble Li.” Someone interrupted their conversation.

“Ye Fantian!” Everyone immediately looked over and became startled.

Moreover, the youth standing next to her was just as noticeable. He wore a sapphire robe and looked unbeatable. The land he stood on was blessed with his greatness.

“Xiao Qingtian!” They shouted his name as well.

He was a direct disciple of Illumination Conqueror and the current leader of Azure School.

Some believed that Azure School might take over Dao Alliance again and Xiao Qingtian would be the next guardian.

Therefore, people kept a distance due to both respect and fear. This was someone capable of reaching the apex in the future.

“Young Noble Xiao, Miss Ye.” Divine Hawk Monarch had to bow after seeing the two.

After all, one had twelve sacred fruits. Although he concealed his aura, just one glance alone could make others tremble in fear.

As for Li Qiye, he continued staring at a mural instead of paying attention to the two geniuses.

Ye Fantian took the initiative to approach. She stood shoulder to shoulder and said: “Are you comprehending it, Young Noble?”

“Just taking a look.” Li Qiye caressed the mural again.

“I’ve taken a look at all one hundred. In my opinion, there are definitely embedded grand dao within them.” She said casually.

“Is that so?” He finally turned to look at her.

“Of the heavenly level.” She repeated.

He smiled after hearing this.

Xiao Qingtian who was left out came closer. He took a look at Li Qiye and said: “Miss Ye, mind introducing us?”

Ye Fantian shook her head, causing Xiao Qingtian to be curious. The two of them appeared rather close.

“Young Noble, is there something special about this particular war mural?” He then asked Li Qiye.
