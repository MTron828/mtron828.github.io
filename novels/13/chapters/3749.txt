Chapter 3750: Eight Celestial Dragons

“Boom!” The shockwaves made it difficult for others to stand firmly.

Liu Huaishi’s attack frightened the majority of the mass, clearly showing them that he was stronger than Xiao Fengyun.

The force of the dragon-like whip caused Chi Xiaoyue to tremble once.

“Damn!” A genius gasped, feeling his palms drenched with cold sweat.

Some thought that they have made the right choice but not accepting the challenge. Otherwise, they would have looked like clowns after losing in one move.

“Shit...” The students from Duality worried the most while clenching their fists. She seemed to be at a disadvantage after the first exchange.

“His power is indeed above Xiao Fengyun.” One older expert became startled: “If he can reach the sacred realm, he’ll be eligible to become a sect master in just a few years afterward.”

“Die!” Liu Huaishi roared and leaped upward.

“Boom!” The fate palaces emerged and released majestic grand dao power and true chaos energy.

The whip in his hand coiled and the sky turned dark. A true dragon with black scales emerged and blotted out the area. Its draconic energy rampaged like a tsunami.

Others became frightened and lost their composure. Loud blasts came next and the draconic energy gathered, turning into an ocean drowning everyone. The overbearing draconic aura was suffocating. People’s knees buckled uncontrollably.

“Eight Celestial Dragons!” Liu Huaishi waved his hand and affected the spatio-temporal fabrics.

As the whip came down, eight dragons manifested into reality. They roared and started descending downward, ready to unleash an apocalypse.

Their shape and form varied - one was of the fire affinity, another was shrouded in a golden radiance, another was cold enough to seal the world in a layer of ice, one more was surrounded by darkness...

The fiery dragon’s claws melted the ground; the golden one tore space apart; the ice one began sealing the sky...

Each unleashed their destructive potential, seemingly wanting to destroy Minor Sacred Mountain.

Not to mention the young geniuses, even the older experts were startled by this attack. It displayed all of Liu Huaishi’s strength and proved the previous speculation of him being stronger than Xiao Fengyun.

Chi Xiaoyue gathered her strength into the half-moon. Her pure vitality erupted like an endless torrent.

The frightening vitality and lunar light instantly fused. The half-moon transformed into an arc before becoming a massive ball of light, serving as an unbreakable defense. At the same time, it also emitted waves of energy for retaliation.

“Boom!” Liu Huaishi froze for a moment; the eight descending dragons also slowed down.

However, this didn’t last long before the eight dragons regained momentum and resumed their attack.

They slammed onto the light ball. The golden dragon used its claws like divine swords; the fire dragon incinerated the outer layer; the black dragon used its dark affinity for a consuming attempt.

This combined power of the dragons seemed unstoppable.

The half-moon in Chi Xiaoyue’s hands flickered and dimmed down. She trembled continuously, seemingly unable to stop the attack.

“Break!” Liu Huaishi didn’t let up and added more power to the eight dragons. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Rumble!” His empowerment allowed the dragons to launch a relentless onslaught.

Eventually, cracks could be heard and seen on the circular barrier.

“Not good!” One spectator blurted out. It seemed that Chi Xiaoyue wouldn’t be able to hold on for much longer. Losing was only a matter of time.

“She’s not a match...” Another genius said.

“Senior Xiaoyue, you can do it...” One student shouted in support.

“Yes, you can do it! Keep holding on!” Other students cheered for her.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!” Unfortunately, more and more cracks appeared. The barrier was on the verge of collapsing.

“Boom!” After several more attacks from the eight dragons, the barrier finally crumbled and Xiaoyue was blown flying.

Liu Huaishi decisively gave chase with his whip. The thing pursued her like an evil dragon, wanting to claw open her chest to get to her heart. This move showed no mercy.

The spectators became startled by this development. Losing was one thing but she might actually die from this.

“It’s over...” A few turned away to not see a gruesome death. The whip was just ferocious and unstoppable.

However, a terrible power erupted and blasted everything in the near radius. It was as if a dao lord was here in person.

Even the whip was sent back. Liu Huaishi staggered backward from the backlash.

The perplexed crowd saw Chi Xiaoyue standing up straight and holding a treasure seal with both hands. It was as red as blood and painted the sky in the same hue.

Nothing in the world could match its weight. If it were to fall, it could destroy heaven and earth. It exuded a terrible dao lord aura, capable of sweeping through all evils.

Unfortunately, the seal was missing one corner. This seemed to be due to incompleteness, not that it was damaged later on. The creator of this seal simply didn’t finish the refinement process.

People couldn’t believe it. They thought that she would die to the whip but she turned the tides back during the very last moment.

“A dao lord weapon.” An ancestor recognized the seal right away.

Well, this was rather obvious for anyone due to its rampant aura.
