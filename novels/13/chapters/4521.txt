Chapter 4522: Offers

The first bid stunned everyone and caused them to stare at the bidder. Alas, this character hid their appearance and identity.

“Someone from the Puresun…” A big shot whispered to his friend.

This clan chose isolation and no longer interfered with the world. Its disciples stopped appearing as well.

However, this big shot made people think that he was from the clan due to his bid. After all, who else would have a mantra belonging to the dao lord outside of his own clan members?

“Fellow Daoist, you are from the Puresun?” A participant couldn’t help but ask.

Most became interested right away, especially members of the east. Their eyes became brighter.

The reason was very simple. Ever since the clan’s isolation, the east became a snake without a head. The great powers and clans of the east were no longer united so the land became weaker. If the Puresun were to appear again, Eastern Desolace might rise once more.

In reality, the majority of sects in the east wished to see the Puresun, Void Imperfection, and Heavenvine again. With the help of these ancient lineages, Eastern Desolace’s influence and authority would soar.

The cultivator in stealth shook their head and said: “Ladies and gentlemen, please don’t misunderstand. I am just an insignificant cultivator, not from the Puresun.”

“Then how do you have the dao lord’s mantra?” Someone from the east questioned.

“My ancestor was a general under the dao lord. He contributed greatly and was bestowed this mantra later on. It is considered our heirloom.” The cultivator responded with haste.

There was no problem with this answer because the dao lord had many generals under his banner. Moreover, there was no concrete detail about the gifts so it couldn’t be proven false.

“Remember, this is the key auction.” The person from the east said: “The first auction was already a dao lord sword art. Now, you’re using a dao lord merit law as a bid, don’t you think it is improper?”

Others agreed with this as well. A dao lord merit law was only the starting point for an auction of this level. Though Puresun Dao Lord was special, his mantra was still not worth the amber and the young girl.

“Have to try to know. After all, the auction house didn’t state any restrictions, any item can be proposed. It is up to them to accept or otherwise.” The hidden cultivator calmly answered.

“Puresun Mantra, would you accept it as a bid?” He then shamelessly asked the auctioneer.

The auctioneer only smiled, clearly refusing the mantra as a bid.

This wasn’t to say that the mantra was inferior. It’s just that the scroll alone was not comparable to the final treasure.

“One merit law from Scion Dao Lord and a hammer crafted by him.” One big shot said.

The auctioneer still only smiled.

The big shot didn’t give up and continued: “In addition to those two things, we will also offer a pot of nine-spirit flower. It has been our heirloom for 600,000 years and underwent nine cycles.”

“That flower is quite rare, there might only be a few in the entire world.” Someone else couldn’t help but praise. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They didn’t care about the dao lord merit law or weapon. However, this flower stood out due to its rarity.

“An impressive flower.” The auctioneer praised but still didn’t accept the bid.

“My offer is a cauldron from Stoneclimb Alchemy Emperor, a bowl of nightshine frost unique to Northern Profound Mountain, and three horns from a black-scaled dragon.” A grandmaster offered.

These items were rather rare but still didn’t interest the auctioneer.

“I offer an ancient scroll from a legendary place known as Buddhist Burial Ground. It is from a forbidden temple there, there is only one copy in the whole world.” A big shot from an ancient sect said.

“Great, this scroll can be on the list.” The auctioneer said.

“Oh?” The crowd exclaimed after hearing this.

A few of them understood why this was chosen over the dao lord items. The auction house had no lack of them. On the other hand, rare items and artifacts had a higher value.

“I offer a painting with the name, Emperors. It was painted by fifteen dao lords through the generations using all of their efforts.” A prime minister of a dynasty bid.

This attracted people’s attention. It was a work of art painted over many generations. Its value was not bad at all.

“It’s amazing.” The auctioneer praised but didn’t accept it as an offer.

“Heaven Dragon Gate is willing to offer true dragon blood, scale, bone, and claw, one each.” A big shot stated his affiliation and offered.

“True dragon?” A big shot said: “If there is someone actually in possession of these things, it would be Divine Dragon Valley.”

The big shot coughed and said: “It’s close enough, the dragon definitely has the bloodline of a true dragon.”

Of course, this meant that the dragon wasn’t an actual true dragon. It was just another species with a part of this bloodline. This offer wasn’t enough to be added to the list.

At this time, a seemingly-regular cultivator said: “I have a Heaven’s Will Secret Law of an ancient emperor.”

“These secret laws are not bad at all, they’re comparable to a dao lord’s patrimony merit law?” One big shot said.

“Then it is just on the level of the best dao lord merit laws. It is not competitive in this auction, there’s no point in bidding.” Someone else rudely commented.
