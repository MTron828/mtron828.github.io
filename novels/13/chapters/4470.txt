Chapter 4471: Accepting The Ancestor

“Brother, come over and greet the young noble.” Wise Ancestor said.

“Greetings.” Purpose Ancestor came over and was going to bow his head to greet the ancient ancestor. However, he stopped abruptly after taking a closer look at Li Qiye.

At first, he thought that this ancient ancestor invited back by the Wu should be an awe-inspiring cultivator. Alas, this ordinary youth’s cultivation was weaker than theirs. How could he be an ancient ancestor? Impossible.

Because of this, his head stopped lowering halfway. The other elders from the Tie shared the same sentiment while stealing glances at Li Qiye.

“Old Wise, are you sure you’re right on this? He’s your ancient ancestor?” Purpose Ancestor whispered to Wise Ancestor. He thought that the Wu has been tricked.

“A hundred percent.” Wise whispered back.

Purpose remained skeptical and said: “Which ancient ancestor then? This isn’t a trivial matter.” He kept his voice as quiet as can be.

If he didn’t trust Wise Ancestor, he would have thought that this was a joke and leave instantly.

“Trust me, it’s right. Hurry up and show respect before the young noble feels offended. Call him young noble.” Wise whispered.

“...” Purpose found this whole thing astounding.

“Ancestor, please do not hesitate. This is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our four clans, it will never happen again.” Jian Ming added, aware of the actual significance, unlike Wise Ancestor.

“The descendants of the Tie greet you, Young Noble.” Purpose took a deep breath and prostrated, albeit with lingering doubts.

“We greet you, Young Noble.” The accompanying elders prostrated as well.

They still questioned whether this youth was an ancient ancestor or not, and what were his abilities and power? The reason they chose to believe was due to their close ties with the Wu.

“Rise.” Li Qiye told them.

They bowed their head once before getting up. Nonetheless, skepticism remained in their eyes.

“Can’t do well forever just relying on the eighteen thrusts and Jade Spiral Merit Law.” Li Qiye glanced at them and said: “What happened to your Spear Ancestor’s perfected Stormpetal technique?”

The members of the Tie exchanged glances and gasped because Li Qiye knew their situation too well.

“Please guide us, Young Noble.” Purpose got on his knees again.

The Tie was once famous for their spear techniques. Their forefather, Spear Ancestor, had followed the duck egg buyer just like Saber Ancestor. In fact, they became renowned together with the title of Saber-spear Duo.

Alas, the Tie declined just like the Wu. They eventually lost their spear dao and were only left with mediocre merit laws.

“Fortune will come if it’s meant to be.” Li Qiye casually responded.

“...” Purpose Ancestor paused. It seemed as if Li Qiye had no intention of teaching them.

Jian Ming then started winking at him. Purpose wasn’t a fool and took note of this. He understood what he should do right away and bowed his head again: “Thank you for your guidance.”

“We are planning on asking the young noble to revive the tree.” Wise Ancestor whispered after he stood up.

Purpose was moved and said: “Via the union?”

“Yes, only a dao trace through the primordial union can do it.” Wise said softly.

Purpose stole glances at Li Qiye again. He had accepted Li Qiye as an ancient ancestor but still wondered if he could perform the union.

“You’re aware that we’re missing the dao stones for the union.” Wise got straight to the point.

“Are you sure?” Purpose whispered. The tree was important so handing the dao stones over carelessly was reckless.

“Yes, the Jian has handed their stone over to the young noble as well. The union needs four stones, so we need yours and the Lu’s.” Wise said.

The circumstances left Purpose hesitating despite trusting Wise. If they were to lose the dao stones, they would become sinners of the clans.

“Ancestor, this is not the time to hesitate.” Jian Ming urged: “Don’t be a frog under the well. Your one thought can change the direction of our clans, please give us the stone.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He worried that this hesitation might annoy Li Qiye. Everything would be lost then.

“I’ll go get it right away.” Purpose could tell that this was no time to hesitate. Thus, he decisively sent someone to fetch the dao stone.

It didn’t take long before the one from the Tie was taken here. He raised it with both hands and offered it to Li Qiye: “Young Noble, please accept the dao stone of the Tie.”

This one was of the frost affinity and had a white hue. The runic runes looked like ice flowers quietly blossoming.

It wasn’t cold to the toughest in the slightest, emitting a gentle sensation just like the fire stone.

“Still missing one.” Li Qiye said.

This prompted the trio to exchange glances.
