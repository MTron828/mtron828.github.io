Chapter 5171: An Eternal Light

He closed the coffin and stored it, preparing for another difficult task.

He raised both hands and summoned the most profound dao. Visual phenomena of the yin and yang becoming chaotic emerged. The river of hell started flowing backward.

Just one wrong move and the gate of hell would open. Thousands of ghosts and fiends would appear to drag him into the abyss and devour him.

However, his primordial light was eternal. He stood at the center of life and death. Neither heaven nor hell could sway him for his wish was more powerful.

He stabilized the soul fragments and morphed them into a cosmic light. With that, he infused the light back into the two flowers.

“Cannot endure in this cold void. I will lend you my assistance.” He sighed and said.

He forcefully pulled the flowers that were growing in the void before refining this dimension into them.

He then closed the dimension and returned to the garden, placing the flowers at the very center of this hallowed land.

The flowers could then bathe in the endless life force. Moreover, the king medicines would also strengthen them with their medicinal properties.

He raised his hand again to use a primordial method, infusing two light pillars into Immortal’s Peak.

“Rumble!” A supreme power sealed the peak, never allowing anyone else to take a single step inside.

“What is this phenomenon?” All the big shots nearby became alarmed.

“The immortal medicine?” A top alchemist became excited.

Excitement filled the air but no one could make it to the base, let alone climb up the peak.

There was one exception - an old woodcutter who made it to the base.

“Someone’s coming.” He looked up and murmured.

As for Li Qiye, he had accomplished his mission. He took one look at the flowers and the garden before smiling: “Now, bask in the sunlight. We’ll see what awaits you two in the future.”

Having said that, he descended.

The light inside the two flowers pulsed feebly as if they were alive. They fluctuated in his direction, seemingly waving goodbye. Life force seemed to be gathering in the pistils, perhaps they would be able to come back in the future.

As he walked down the steps, he noticed something and stopped.

“Cold and bright is the sight of Mount Emei…” He heard someone quietly singing - an old woodcutter carrying a bundle of firewood on his back.

Though dressed in simple attire, his aura couldn’t be overshadowed. Moreover, this was the base of Immortal’s Peak.

He came over and put down the bundle of firewood along with his straw hat. He bowed and said: “Greetings, Sir.”

He raised his head, revealing his rugged features as if they were carved from stone. His eyes radiated a steadfast gleam as if nothing could deter him.

An eternal light shining the ages - this was one way to describe him.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Greetings.” Li Qiye nodded in response.

The old man then cleaned a rock and placed some leaves on it before asking: “Please have a seat.”

While Li Qiye sat down, he took out a gourd and said: “I don’t have much to offer, only some wine to warm you up.”

Li Qiye accepted and took a big gulp before commenting: “High quality, made from impeccable techniques.” He then returned the gourd.

“You have good taste, Sir.” The old man took a big gulp as well.

He put the cork back on and said seriously: “Sir, you have a thing that Celestial Court desires.”

“You want it too?” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man rubbed his chin and said: “I’ve thought about it but I’m not sure of your actual depth.”

“A wise person should know how to proceed.” Li Qiye said.

“Wise people are often persistent and hopeful as well.” He said.

“How many can be persistent to the very end? Giving up can be a good thing. Once you lose hope, anything is possible.” Li Qiye didn’t care.

“Despair only comes when one’s grand ambition remains unfulfilled.” The old man said.

“Everyone believes they harbor grand ambitions.” To which Li Qiye responded.

“You have one as well.” The old man stared at Li Qiye.

“No, just personal desires.” Li Qiye corrected with a smile.

“When embarking on the path toward the gran dao, one should aspire to think on a grand scale and possess a vision that extends through eternity…” The old man said solemnly.

“I have calluses in my ears from listening to these grandiose words.” Li Qiye interrupted him: “You are merely displaying your skill before a true master. My heart-stirring speeches have become realities, eternal truths and mantras passed down for eras.”

“Sounds to me like you care more about the world than you let on.” The old man said.

“Proclaiming love for the world and such is nothing more than self-fulfillment. All those who claim to be saviors will bring destruction upon it.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Sir, your view is mistaken.” The old man retorted: “The world would be in turmoil and its inhabitants would suffer in the absence of a noble aspiration to support and guide.”

“Turmoil and suffering are brought about by those with grand ambitions.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“With all due respect, that is a cynical outlook. The will to do good is absolutely crucial in keeping this world safe.” The old man said.

“Do you see this blade of grass? And that tree over there? Do they have any ambition of protecting the forest from the wind and rain?” Li Qiye smiled: “If they do, they will have to grow larger and larger, taking up all the water and sunlight. How will anything else grow beneath? Is that still considered protecting the forest?”

“Well… a towering tree will become home to birds and beasts…” The old man said.

“What does that matter? Do you care more about the birds or the forest?” Li Qiye responded: “In the end, it will be outside of your control and you will have to go with the flow.”

“Sir, aren’t you becoming a towering tree?” The old man asked.

“No, I am becoming a towering tree not to save the forest but to be closer to the sun.” Li Qiye answered.

“...” The old man pondered in silence.

“Those who hold lofty ambitions and consider themselves as saviors will fall harder than anyone else when faced with failure. They will believe that their failure is the fault of the world, and that its inhabitants are not worthy of salvation so they bring about destruction instead. Once again, mere self-soothing excuses, the result of their own wavering heart and misguided intentions.” Li Qiye concluded.
