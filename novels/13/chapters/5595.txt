Chapter 5596: Slanted Dao

Despite the surge in morale, they were still the underdogs versus the armies of Celestial Court.

The latter had more top cultivators and general soldiers to fuel the formations. The second push failed to gain ground but nonetheless, it delayed the assault and gave certain groups time to retreat.

“Withdraw!” Leaders read the situation and knew that this was futile. They needed to survive to fight another day.

As mighty combatants fought against the armies, their juniors retreated to their sect instead of holding the front lines. Even if Dao Domain were to fall today, they could always take it back in the future.

This was a lesson from Immemorial Epoch War. The People was nothing compared to Celestial Court but after generations of blood and sweat, the heroic emperors eventually balanced the board.

On the other hand, War God Dao Lord’s blade couldn’t be stopped. He alone stopped an entire army while fighting five Grand Emperors at the same time.

This forced the commanders of other armies to come as reinforcement. He eventually became surrounded but still fought as ferociously as before.

His battle spirit served as an echoing drum. The beats empowered the remaining fighters with their resistance.

Nonetheless, one top cultivator fell after another. The outskirts of the city were reduced to pieces as well. If this continued, they would turn into forbidden zones.

“Boom!” Meanwhile, Luminous and War devastated the sky above. Stars exploded like fireworks.

Luminous lived up to his reputation, capable of stopping War Ancient God with the help of his primordial dao fruit.

Alas, this ancient cultivator could still keep up. Anyone else would have been killed by the conqueror’s relentless attacks. War fought like a raging primal beast, capable of devouring heaven and earth.

War and War God had a similar fighting style. The difference was that War God remained lucid and aware. His battle intent was unshakable.

War, on the other hand, fell into a frenzy state. Nonetheless, he had honed this battle style and was capable of assuming and leaving the madness when necessary. Other users of this might start harming their allies but he remained in relative control.

“Clank!” A sword hymn resonated loudly to signal an incoming slash.

Members of Dao Domain were horrified, thinking that the technique had pierced through their head and crucified them to the ground, still standing. Even emperors and monarchs saw this flashing image.

The attack wielded the death affinity on top of an unbeatable aura of despair. The targets couldn’t lift their weapon to fight back after being overwhelmed by despair. It pierced the spirit before the flesh, instilling helplessness into all.

“Bam!” It stopped War God’s scorching battle spirit and sword intent, finally causing him to stagger backward.

The attacker was a middle-aged man wearing a gray robe that had been worn out. His hair draped on his shoulders seemed to have been turned white by his aura of despair.

He looked lonely and melancholy, no different from a mortal scholar who had failed a recent state examination despite studying his whole life.

Strangely enough, his eyes contrasted his overall appearance. A determined glow could be seen, always empowering his aura.

“Just-once.” War God had a serious expression after seeing the man.

“Patriarch.” The man greeted with a readied blade. Although the aura of defeat came from him, the ones tasting defeat would be his enemies, not him.

“Just-once Dao Lord.” Others recognized him right away and became sentimental.

This was because Just-once came from a sect founded by War God back in Eight Desolaces.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Just-once was the third dao lord of Daoist Sword Ground, playing a crucial role in saving it from continual decline.

War God was both his sect patriarch and a relative, sharing the same bloodline. Unfortunately, they joined opposing sides.

Such things weren’t uncommon given the current political climate of the six continents. However, what made this case unique was that they were evenly matched.

“Your dao is slanted.” War God said; his battle spirit showed no sign of holding back even when facing a descendant.

“In what way?” Just-once asked, not weakening his aura either.
