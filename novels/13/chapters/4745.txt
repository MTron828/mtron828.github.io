Chapter 4746: Unbeatable

Skybreak Monarch also thrust his halberd downward - his friend who has helped him dominate numerous battlefields and kill mighty cultivators.

It was made from a special celestial metal infused with the dao bones of a great demon. The tip was especially sharp, capable of cutting the breezes that just happen to be passing by. Its target was none other than Li Qiye’s throat. Due to its speed, the trajectory left behind a lightning ray.

Once the target knew that it was coming, their neck would have been pierced already.

“Raaa!” Resonance Monarch also attacked by roaring instead of using a weapon. She released a tsunami of mantras right at Li Qiye.

Instead of assaulting the ears with unbearable volume, the mantras simply had a destructive affinity.

Anything along the way crumbled from the vibration, whether it be the toughest metal or a bottomless lake. Due to the endless nature of this attack, dao power, chaos true energy, and even spatial mastery couldn’t stop them.

“Boom!” Tyrant Monarch chose to turn his myriad dao into meteors, crushing stars along the way.

This was as if a true immortal has used a tail whip against the world. Both the physical landscape and its inhabitants would be destroyed in the blink of an eye.

These ancient ancestors didn’t hold back and terrified the crowd. Their attacks would leave lasting damage behind to the Primordial Union.

At this point, even the big shots outside of the union felt heaven-defying shock waves breaking through the dimensions. They knew that a great battle was happening within.

This was a total of seven ancient ancestors working together to kill Li Qiye. The crowd screamed in horror; some became paralyzed by the sheer pressure. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“This is something else.” An important figure wondered if Li Qiye could stop the incoming attacks.

“Buzz.” The gemstone in Li Qiye’s palm became blindingly bright again. This exuding radiance seemed to be forming a barrier to block all of the attacks. The heavenly swords and the meteors were immediately blocked.

In the next moment, the barrier started pulsing. After each pulse, it became a hundred times bigger.

The swords and meteors seemed like pebbles thrown into the ocean, leaving behind ripples. Alas, as the barrier grew larger, it seemed that the various attacks would need eras or travel through billions of miles before reaching Li Qiye.

However, this phenomenon didn’t affect Li Qiye at all. His hand moved freely and elegantly through the barrier.

His movement was at normal speed while the others became infinitely slow. This made it look as if he was waving at lightning speed.

The power emanating from the wave swept through the entire battlefield and more. The vastness and thickness of the world no longer mattered. He could easily push the realms without facing any resistance. This applied to his opponents as well.

The five monarchs and the demons reacted perfectly and just in time. Alas, their defensive techniques and treasures couldn’t stop the hand wave.

After loud explosions, their treasures disintegrated. All seven ancestors were sent flying with numerous broken bones.

They smashed into various mountains and pierced through them before stopping in newly-created craters.

The crowd became slack-jawed while staring at the ground stained with the mighty’s blood. Their mind became empty, unable to process this development.

Seven ultimate cultivators have teamed up and lost to a single push. This level of power was beyond their imagination.

“Hey… he didn’t even use a technique…” Someone assumed that the battle would have lasted for several hundred rounds and included wonderful techniques and variations.

Who would actually believe this story without being here in person to witness it?

“He’s unbeatable…” Golden Fist Emperor sighed after seeing this.

The push didn’t surprise him. The issue was Li Qiye’s perfect mastery over the gemstone’s power. He exerted it at will while not suffering any backlash.
