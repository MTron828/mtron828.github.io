Chapter 5820: Trinity Blade

The greatest swordsmen among the crowd felt inadequate after witnessing the slash.

Sword Emperor devoted his life to the sword; Immortal Emperor Hao Hai had access to the best of the best - a heavenly sword dao and Divine Beast.

Both paled in comparison to this ultimate slash standing at the apex of the epoch.

“Against Heaven Sword Dao!” World Emperor standing in front of the mirror couldn’t help but praise.

“Against Heaven? Whose dao is it?” Those nearby asked.

“Only one person knows this dao in the world.” World sighed and said: “The founder of Celestial Court.”

This excited listeners and made them gaze intensely into the heavenly mirror.

“Clank!” This slash broke through the confinement of the sword dao. It was living with worlds and the karmic cycles of their inhabitants.

It evoked the sense of all living creatures raising their hands, not only in this lifetime but also in the past. Generations were determined to bear the burden of the high heaven.

This made people think of a particular saying - even a lowly ant desires to show its fangs to the high heaven.

All things were insignificant beneath but all of them - albeit as insignificant as dust - wanted to push against it. This feeling evoked by the sword slash was unforgettable.

“Bam!” Alas, this was still not enough to stop the dimensional wall pushed down by Li Qiye. Living beings of the ages couldn’t bear the weight of the dimensions.

“Trinity Activation!” The swordsman roared. After loud hums, his sword became resplendent and released three divine rings.

“Boom!” They soared into the air and turned into an epoch, imbuing its power into the sword dao to stop the dimensional wall.

They had seen the three divine rings during the war with Imperial Field. These things belonged to the mysterious guest - Trinity Ancestor.

Some also knew the name of the sword - Trinity Blade. Its owner was none other than the founder or Human Monarch.

He was rarely seen in history, even more elusive than the three immortals. Today, he came out in full force, utilizing his best treasures and techniques to stop Li Qiye.

The sword was handed down to him by Trinity Ancestor before the expedition. It represented the highest authority in Celestial Court.

When used in combination with Against Heaven Dao, it momentarily stopped the descending wall.

“Unfortunately, still lacking.” Li Qiye smiled and pressed down.

A dimension eruption occurred and sent the founder flying, creating an abyss where he landed. He climbed back up, vomiting a mouthful of blood.

He was a muscular old man wearing an undecorated robe. Although he looked like an ordinary mortal, others still feared him. He gave the impression of having bountiful vitality, even more so than a youth. It could never deplete, granting him endless energy and instant recovery. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Spectators felt that Li Qiye could bring him down a thousand times and he would stand up again, provided that he survived the attack. He always enjoyed a prime state regardless of his previous injuries.

“So this is the Human Monarch bloodline.” Someone said.

This was the fourth immortal bloodline, Human Monarch. Previously, possessing one meant becoming a historically great emperor. Today, all four were seen together.

Nevertheless, they knew that he was no match for Li Qiye. The four immortal bloodlines somehow were weaker than Li Qiye’s seemingly lack of bloodline.

“Human Ancestor, you finally show your face.” Li Qiye smiled.

“How can I not come to greet you, Sacred Teacher?” Human Ancestor took a deep breath and said solemnly.

The three immortals addressed Li Qiye as “Dark Crow” while Human Ancestor exercised politeness.
