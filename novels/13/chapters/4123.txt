Chapter 4124: Plenty Of Money

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

All eyes were on Li Qiye but none doubted his financial prowess. This was only a drop in the ocean.

“One hundred million again.” Someone spoke.

“Don’t you know? That’s his favorite number. It would be foolish to bid against him, someone has to be a real masochist to do that.” An expert who had met Li Qiye before said.

“Might as well call him Millionaire Li.” An old cultivator said. [1]

“No, that’s an egregious underestimation since one hundred million is so little to him. In fact, he wouldn’t even notice it missing.” The expert elaborated.

“Billionaire Li then?” The old cultivator suggested.

“Still not enough.” The expert shook his head: “Maybe Trillionaire Li.” [2]

“I agree, that’s straight to the point. Just add his wealth to his title.” One youth agreed.

“Yes, Li Qiye should really just change his name.” Others agreed with this notion.

Of course, that wouldn’t be possible but they liked it enough to use it as a nickname.

Daoist Peng looked up and saw Li Qiye. He became ecstatic because this was the man he was searching for.

“Dis-” He was about to shout “disciple” but that wouldn’t be right given the circumstances.

“Boss, you’re here? I’ve finally found you! It wasn’t easy at all!” He stood in front of Li Qiye and was overwhelmed with joy.

Illusory Princess’ sharp eyes focused on Li Qiye. This was the case for the other two geniuses as well.

They have heard of him before but the first meeting still caught them by surprise.

“One hundred million?” Illusory Princess turned cold. She wanted to take a look or even just buy Daoist Peng’s sword. This was a matter of pride for her; the sword was irrelevant.

No one dared to interfere or bid against her, lest they want to antagonize her sect as well. Moreover, Daoist Peng was a nobody. There was no reason to stand up for a stranger.

On the other hand, this seemed on course for Li Qiye given his aggressive personality. Nine-wheel Citadel was never part of his consideration. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The princess has been used to special treatments. Even ancestors from large sects spoke politely to her. Thus, his bid was nothing short of provocation, akin to a slap on the cheek.

“You bidding against me?” She glared at him.

“Indeed, got a problem with it? I’ll make it five hundred million then. Feel free to keep it going, I’ll entertain you.” He said with a smile, not caring about her annoyance.

This only made her more livid since he increased his bid for no reason.

“Five hundred million now? I can’t imagine how rich he is.” One listener said.

“Get used to it, he has a hundred billion Dao Lord Refined Jades, this is nothing to him.” One expert said.

“Imagine how much money he spent recruiting all those experts and realize that he probably didn’t even bat an eye then. He’s probably sick of having too much money.” Another added.

“He’s done offending Nine-wheel Citadel now.” One youth noticed the princess’ ugly expression.

“As I’ve said, get used to it. The guy even stole the future queen of Sea Emperor, it’s impossible to be any crazier.” The first expert said.

“Offending too many people will result in death.” One big shot said.

Many agreed with this since Li Qiye was dealing with too many behemoths. If they were to mobilize against him, he would die without a grave.

Of course, some spectators were happy too. They disliked Li Qiye and wouldn’t mind witnessing his downfall. Furthermore, his wealth would become available again.

“Seems like you have more money than sense.” The princess uttered coldly, possessing enough self-control not to erupt in anger.

“Yes, it’s hurting my back carrying so much.” Li Qiye nodded, unaffected by her quip.

“Sword Continent is a place where strength matters…” The princess said, unable to back down. A top genius like her couldn’t lose to a guy like Li Qiye. She couldn’t contest with him in terms of money but her sect wasn’t afraid of him either.

“Yeah, yeah, I know. But, I have enough money to recruit all the experts I want. If ten isn’t enough, then one hundred. If one hundred isn’t enough, then a thousand…” Li Qiye waved his hand as if he was swatting a fly.

“Money can’t solve everything…” Her chest heaved up and down from rage.

“But that is precisely what I just did. If you can bid one billion, I’ll tell the daoist to sell the sword to you.” Li Qiye interrupted her again: “You got one billion?”

She gritted her teeth, frustrated due to her lack of finance. She wanted to display her superiority and win against this newly-rich jerk. Alas, he stopped her every time.

“You have no idea how strong Nine-wheel Citadel is, know your place!” One youth interjected to help her.

“Can Nine-wheel Citadel take things without paying? No, bandits from Cloud Dream Lake do that, not a prestigious sect. Wait a minute, this is Tortoise Monarch City, gotta pay here too.” Li Qiye had nothing else to do and decided to kill time, ready to retort against anyone.

1. The raw is Hundred Millionaire Li but this doesn’t work in English. Chinese has a word for one hundred million which fits better

2. The literal is Hundred Billion(aire) Li, but trillionaire just works better and the intent is the same
