Chapter 5835: Fine, Have It Your Way

“Boom!” The four emperors became massive with the intensifying epoch light. Their body seemed to be a vessel for an epoch.

The mere opening of their eyes caused stars to explode and chaos expanses to form.

“So strong...” The People’s members were astounded.

“Overlords are possessing them.” Immortal Emperor Chi Ye took a deep breath.

This had happened during a previous war with Brilliant Devil Emperor being taken over. Alas, there were four today.

“Boom!” The four surrounded Li Qiye and unleashed their auras.

“All here now?” Li Qiye smiled and smashed Derivation with the newly-created seal of death.

“Ahh!” The invincible overlord’s flesh and blood splashed everywhere. Their corrosive nature melted everything upon touch.

In the next second, all the pieces came together again and formed the whole body.

“Brat, can’t kill me this easily.” Derivation said.

“No wonder why the ancient ming was so resilient back then.” Emperors from the nine worlds recalled.

“No rush.” Li Qiye smirked and glanced at the possessed cultivators: “Welcome, Primal Ancestor, Stonesplitter Patriarch, Dao Ancestor, Imperial Progenitor of Myriad Realms. Primal, we couldn’t have a good chat last time.”

Primal or Heaven, Imperial Progenitor or Sword, Stonesplitter or Hao Hai, and Dao Protector or Profound didn’t bother responding.

“Clank!” They unsheathed their weapons - Heavenblade, Divine Beast, Trinity Origination Disk, and Nine-heaven Shroud.

“Rumble!” Elder Galaxy’s internal dimension shook violently and became unstable due to their presence.

The four chose to hide and only possessed these cultivators. Trying to find them in Elder Galaxy would take an incalculable period.

The founder and the three immortals became emotional, especially the latter.

“Finally, the ancestors are here, they’ll kill Dark Crow today and get rid of future complications.” Heaven Authority said.

“We should have eliminated him long ago, peace will come then.” Devil Bestowment became excited.

The founder didn’t say anything and watched quietly. After all, it was too early to celebrate when the overlords weren’t here in person.

“Haha, we haven’t teamed up in a long time, let’s kill the brat today!” Derivation laughed. At the very least, these four came to help him. Of course, he would have told Li Qiye all of their secrets.

However, the four glanced at him briefly with their golden eyes, having left a spot open for him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“They want you to fight me directly before helping.” Li Qiye smirked at him.

“Fuck, that’s not what we agreed on back then, you all should stop him.” Derivation cursed but the group didn’t respond.

Derivation realized they wanted to test Li Qiye’s true power first through him.

“Fine, have it your way.” Derivation had no choice because he was the first to descend and reveal his coordinates.

“Tsk, tsk.” Li Qiye shook his head: “The smartest in history got played by his friends.”

“You!” Derivation was proud of his intelligence during time immemorial. He considered himself the wisest and didn’t want to lose to the high heaven, hence his effort to create a new race.

Because of this, he created the blood and the ancient ming along with many fiendish creatures. However, this didn’t mean he was as calculating and scheming as Primal and the others. He had expended all of his efforts on the goal of creation and didn’t worry about other things.

“I go first and then it’s your turn next.” Derivation grumbled while being forced into a corner.

He had to play along to test Li Qiye’s strength before his allies would handle the rest.

The four nodded after hearing this.

“Brat, witness my true power!” He shouted.

“I will, we have plenty of time.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Boom!” He summoned a drum.

The moment it appeared, an indescribable aura permeated the region. It had a touch of malice, death, and curse all in one.
