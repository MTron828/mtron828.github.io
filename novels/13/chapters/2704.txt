“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The glow on Li Qiye almost became full-fledged currents and began to go wild.

The emperor looked over at him and said: “Dao Brother?”

“It’s fine, I don’t need it.” Li Qiye gently shook his head: “I want to see what this person is looking at. Plus, it’s useless even if I try to shroud.”

“What do you mean?” She was surprised.

“I told you before that I’m only a passerby and do not belong here. If a tribulation comes down, I’ll definitely feel the brunt because I have tested it before.”

The emperor furrowed her brows because fewer than few have experienced the tribulations in Immortal Lineage. Tribulations normally never came down here.

“Plus, I’m not the same as any of you. I have seen and struck the villainous heaven, so when a large-scale tribulation descends, I’ll attract an extremely mighty one just like a magnet.” Li Qiye’s eyes became profound as he looked upward.

The emperor became startled because she knew the level he was speaking of. The information hidden behind this secret was shocking. No one has ever done something like this in the history of Three Immortals yet Li Qiye had done it.

Strangely enough, Li Qiye seemed to be anticipating this: “Come, it’s been a while since my last world-destroying tribulation. Another taste will be nice.” He smacked his lips.

The emperor smiled wryly. Anyone else would be stricken with fear before a heavenly tribulation but Li Qiye seemed to be excited. Just how tough was his mentality?

“Bump! Bump! Bump!” Something in the external space seemed to be bumping into the sky of Immortal.

This world resembled a closed-off fortress while the banging sound came from a mighty invader trying to break through the gates.

“What’s happening now?” The emperor became startled as the entire world trembled.

“This is the best thing about Three Immortals, the reason why it doesn’t normally have tribulations and still standing strong all this time. Everything else has been blocked outside, your world is an isolated one. Even this massive-scale tribulation is having a hard time descending.” Li Qiye explained.

“Rumble!” Explosions continued with earthquakes everywhere due to an all-penetrating force from above.

“Boom!” Finally, a blast as loud as the detonation of a million thunder. Everything exploded and collapsed. The world was slightly pushed out of its balance and numerous people fell to the ground.

The sky instantly became bright again as if the gate above has been taken down.

“Boom!” The day returned with a terrible friend. Golden brilliance permeated like sun rays, giving everything a similar shade.

“Look, the tribulation is coming!” Someone shouted at this sight.

Sure enough, it looked like a dam has been broken with countless yellow bolts descending. The magnificent bolts looked like a golden ocean pouring down to drown Immortal Lineage.

“Rumble!” Each was as thick as a mountain range now with more than enough force to drill through the earth.

One of them crushed numerous peaks and a mountain range.

“Ah!” One Eternal thought that he wouldn’t be struck by it and couldn’t avoid in time. This dazzling bolt annihilated him, causing blood to splash everywhere.

“No!” Screams from the unfortunate masters echoed all over Immortals.

Some weren’t careful enough to hide so they became victims of these murderous bolts.

“Damn, just run for your lives!” The reckless experts were scared out of their mind and quickly concealed their presence.

The torrential bolts rained down and could attack their targets at any given time.

Several strongholds in Immortal became the primary targets. Nothing in the vicinity of these places remained unscathed from the barrages.

Sure enough, powerful barriers were erected, turning the inside into a separate domain to stop the terrifying tribulation.

Alas, the endless barrages of lightning bolts caused the barriers to vibrate uncontrollably with many ripples. Some eventually got taken down.

Li Qiye was also a primary target so thunderous explosions resounded near him.

It didn’t take long before the golden expanse turned into a superstorm. All the lightning bolts aimed straight at him and fired.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The area nearby got penetrated instantly. Mountains and rivers exploded into smithereens. The ground had thousands of large pits.

This terrifying tribulation could intimidate even the strongest master. They would shroud themselves and flee. This was common sense.

However, Li Qiye took the full onslaught without hesitation. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He opened his thirteen palaces and revealed his primordial tree. Supreme grand dao and endless vitality opened a separate domain.

“Come now!” Li Qiye laughed and bravely braced himself against the golden bolts.

The emperor in hiding nearby didn’t know what to do. Only Fiercest would commit to this domineering act. Progenitors themselves wouldn’t dare to face a tribulation of this level.

Nonstop detonations ensued. As his defensive lines grew stronger, so did the offensive barrages. More and more bolts gathered above him, never giving up until there is nothing left of him.

“Boom!” A section of his barrier faltered and one bolt pierced him, then another, and more... Blood naturally gushed out from the holes in his body.

He has been turned into a sieve. One could see the other side through these gaping, bloody holes. His blood and fleshy bits fell to the ground.

Even someone as strong as Li Qiye has been blasted to pieces.
