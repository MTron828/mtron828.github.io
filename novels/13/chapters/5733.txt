Chapter 5734: Sacred Teacher’s Whereabouts?

Heaven Burial’s innate presence alone instilled fear into the enemies.

“Celestial Court will not exist after today.” Demon insisted, answering the second apex cultivator.

“Is that so?” Everyone heard a hum but didn’t see a blade.

A swordsman descended and his sword dao engulfed the battlefield, infiltrating the mind itself. Everyone felt as if they were looking at a sword dao, not a person.

Individuals saw different things - a sword ocean, a single slash crossing the air, one strike against an immortal... 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If these were illusions and visual phenomena, then the firm-hearted would be able to dispel them or at least see the same thing.

However, the emperors and monarchs still all witnessed something different. They were forced to stabilize their mind enough and focus their gaze, only then did a skinny youth appear before them.

He appeared youthful yet the contours of his face told a different story. They seemed to be chiseled by blades and tribulations.

He should exude youthful vigor but there was a sense of vicissitude to him. Others immediately noticed his profound eyes. Deep within was a simple innocence to the point of being obsessed with the dao.

“Sword Emperor!” An ancient god shouted after seeing him. Everyone else shuddered after hearing this title.

He was the current lord of Celestial Court, the successor of Nether Emperor.

Many invaders imagined the lord to look different - imperious and untouchable. Sword Emperor, on the other hand, didn’t seem unlikable. His pure eyes alone gave a good impression.

He came from the immemorial Qian Clan, possessing an earth-shattering talent for the sword dao. At an early age, his legends already spread far and wide.

During his prime, Celestial Court declared war on his clan. A stalemate ensued since they couldn’t do anything to his clan’s great leader - World Emperor.

However, he betrayed the clan and delivered a fatal blow, leading to their decimation. This changed the tides of the war and he became a valued member of Celestial Court.

This act lived on in infamy and others reviled him. Future generations viewed him as an unfilial descendant, deserving of being spat upon at first sight.

Today, actually seeing him left others speechless. He didn’t resemble a despicable traitor in the slightest.

“Fellow Daoist Demon, you cannot defeat us with numbers alone.” Sword Emperor gave the impression of returning to the origin.

It seemed that the long years had erased his sword energy, aura, and hot-blooded temperament. The only thing staying the same was his relatively youthful appearance.

He spoke with sincerity as well, showing no hint of disdain. His delivery made it pleasant to hear and challenging to refute.

“How would one ever know without trying?” Demon responded with a solemn tone.

“It depends on The People’s ace cards.” Sword Emperor said.

He and his allies gazed at the invading armies but didn’t notice anything peculiar.

“And what does Celestial Court have up its sleeve?” Demon retorted.

“Everything. Before the river is our first line, as you can see. Then Fellow Daoist Hao Hai and the others wait beyond the river., and if we juniors cannot win, then the three immortals shall take action.” Sword Emperor spoke earnestly like a child, rendering it difficult for anyone to harbor hatred against him.

He paused for a moment before continuing: “We can use the heavenly treasure’s power as well. If I were to use it as a sword, I would be able to defeat you, Fellow Daoist.”

Everyone listened attentively and exchanged glances afterward. His answer seemed so genuine and surprising, not hiding his ace cards.

This was a man with blood on his hands. He had ordered massacres against his clan and The People but now, how could anyone associate the current him with the monster in the past?

“If this is everything you have, the best you can do is cross the river and that’s it. You will become trapped like birds in the cages, surrounded.” He said.

Although Demon had summoned an incredible force, she might not be able to defeat the multiple lines of defense, let alone take down Celestial Court.

“What’s inevitable will come.” Demon said plainly.

“Sacred Teacher is coming?” Sword spoke with a demeanor as if he were expecting a long-lost friend, not an enemy. This evoked a sense of anticipation.

“We do not know Sacred Teacher’s whereabouts, but when he comes, Celestial Court will surely be annihilated.” Demon shook her head.
