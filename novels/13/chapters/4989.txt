Chapter 4990: Seeing The Freckled Girl Again

Tenderil King was a supreme genius in the lower continents, possessing five sacred fruits and leading Untethered. Only a monster such as Radiant Monarch could compete or surpass her.

Other ancient ancestors dominated by simply becoming dragon lords. As for her, she had reached this stage long ago.

“Over here!” Ming Shi waved at her seniors.

Alas, they focused on something else and kept on going.

“They’re in a hurry.” Yunyun said.

“They must have found something.” Ming Shi said.

“Clank!” A mountainous sword soared through the horizon next. Sharp rays of energy descended like waterfalls, capable of biting deep into the bones.

Birds and beasts instantly hid in their caves, not wanting to come out.

“Incredible.” Goldcrest said after sensing the aura.

A white-haired old man controlled the sword, intimidating the entire region.

“Swordgrasp Venerable, the strongest ancient ancestor of that school. He hasn’t shown himself for ten thousand years now.” Yunyun whispered.

“Why are all these big shots coming?” Ming Shi asked.

“It must be for the god source, it broke down into six fragments.” Goldcrest said.

“They all want to enter the divine nest?” She asked because that was her aunt’s goal.

“Hmm, perhaps. Peacock Monarch is passing away soon, the new commanding god will be chosen before then.” Goldcrest said.

“That is Demon’s business, it doesn’t have anything to do with the other lineages.” Ming Shi said.

“Perhaps I’m overthinking this.” He responded.

“You’re onto something. If a demon were to obtain the six fragments, they will have a chance to become the commanding god.” Li Qiye smiled.

“An outsider god?” Yunyun reacted fast.

“It’s just a guess, I’m not sure that will happen.” Goldcrest coughed, not wanting to speculate.

“Well, if someone really wants all six fragments, they’ll have to get yours too. Watch out for your head, Rooster.” Ming Shi smiled at him.

Goldcrest hid behind Li Qiye and said: “It’ll be fine as long as the young noble is around.”

“Buzz.” A gentle radiance manifested into reality and engulfed the region.

“That’s another god source!” Goldcrest felt it and shouted. He was in possession of one and was familiar with its aura.

“What are we waiting for?!” Ming Shi became impatient and rushed ahead.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The others had no choice but to follow behind her, not wanting anything to happen.

Once they got there, they saw a deep valley that was rather well hidden by the terrain. Several demon monarchs were already there.

To the east was a three-headed boa constrictor, similar in size to the one seen previously by the group. It looked creepy with its tongues flicking in and out.

A massive spider resided to the north with hair piercing into the air like arrows. An old female face covered in wrinkles could be seen on its stomach.

Nearby was a bird, the youngest out of the monarchs here. However, its burning energy turned the rocks nearby into lava.

“Three-fork, Grimface, and Scarletflame Monarch…” Goldcrest recognized them right away.

These were top demon monarchs with countless underlings in Demon.

“Phoenix City Lord, this is ours.” The face on the spider’s stomach spoke with a creepy tone.

The fragment resided in the valley and exuded gentle waves of energy. However, the group was shocked to see the little girl holding it.

“Lil’ Speckle!” Ming Shi shouted. 

They recognized her as well since she was another student from Abroad. She looked rather feeble and weak compared to the three great demons. In fact, they seemed capable of devouring her in one bite.

The group didn’t know why she was here. Their impression of her was that she was strangely quiet and kept a distance from everyone.

Some students believed that she had experienced something traumatic before, leaving her in this pitiful state.

It seemed suicidal for her to be here. Furthermore, they were shocked to see the fragment in her hand.

“That has to be the largest one.” Goldcrest said.

“Come over here!” Ming Shi waved at her.

The freckled girl lifted her gaze from the fragment, her expression a mix of sadness and curiosity, rather than excitement or greed.

“Boom!” A youth suddenly landed nearby, creating a sizable pit in the ground.

He possessed a blinding radiance like a jewel during the night, always illuminating all four directions. He had bright eyes and long brows, looking full of life and spirit with a hint of arrogance.
