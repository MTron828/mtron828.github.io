Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The kingdom never explicitly stated nor confirmed her background. Others assumed that she was a jade bamboo demon. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

They didn’t know that she was the descendant of Jade Bamboo Dao Lord on top of possessing an exceedingly pure bloodline.

After all, too many generations have passed and the direct branch was no longer there. Furthermore, bloodlines would also become thinner with time before disappearing altogether.

Alas, there were exceptions to everything. One or two descendants later down the line might somehow possess a pure bloodline.

This was an extremely rare occurrence - being born with a pure dao lord bloodline. In these special cases, the lucky child would have an exceedingly bright future far exceeding their peers.

For Calm Bamboo Princess, she was able to become the successor of Wooden Sword and the direct disciple of the king due to her innate gifts.

Only the core ancestors of the kingdom had access to this knowledge but now, Li Qiye easily figured it out.

She took a deep breath and felt as if she was completely naked. All of her secrets were out in the open before him.

“I am in awe of your vision, Yong Noble.” She said, looking as obedient as can be as if she has become a different person.

“Having a jade is a crime.” Li Qiye smiled: “Being born with a pure bloodline is the same as having a piece of jade since birth, that’s why Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom picked you.”

Peace Ocean Sword King was the current ruler of the strongest lineage in Sword Continent, no need to elaborate any further regarding his prestige and authority.

Numerous sects would be more than willing to become in-laws with Sea Emperor. However, the latter eventually chose Calm Bamboo Princess. There was obviously a reason - her pure dao lord bloodline.

“Right, the engagement started during my youth.” She nodded.

“The conditions must have been quite favorable. Hmm, Wooden Sword doesn’t need resources. What was the demand?” Li Qiye smiled.

Wooden Sword was powerful but in this scenario, it was the one reaching up. Nonetheless, one could also say that the princess’ future was bright either way. Thus, Wooden Sword should have more plans before picking this engagement.

She opened her mouth but hesitated, only letting out a sigh.

“Let me guess.” He answered his own question: “They want a child.”

Wooden Sword should have fully supported the princess given her bloodline. Why did they want to send her away?

“Right.” She admitted with a nod.

For Wooden Sword, this engagement would net them a powerful ally. Moreover, Peace Ocean Sword King was talented enough to have a good chance of becoming the next dao lord. Thus, the child of these two would be supreme.

If such a child was given to Wooden Sword as its future successor, they might be able to have a dao lord as well. Furthermore, it would strongly bolster the ties between the two sects.

The above factors made Wooden Sword agree to the engagement.

“But you don’t want to.” Li Qiye smiled and knew all of this.

She looked up at him and said: “No one wants to be controlled and manipulated.”

As a disciple back then, she had no power nor the right to oppose the marriage. This didn’t change even after she became the successor.

She naturally didn’t want this deep in her heart. Becoming the future queen of Sea Emperor sounded prestigious and glorious. Alas, she knew that she was being used as a tool for reproduction.

Unfortunately, resistance was futile. The majority of ancestors in Wooden Sword agreed to this engagement so her hands were tied.

“That’s why you picked me. The audacity.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Someone as unfathomable as yourself should be capable and wise.” The princess said.

She had thought about various methods to escape this marriage despite being aware of the futility. Who would dare to offend Sea Emperor?

After the engagement was formalized, not even Wooden Sword could change its mind.

However, Li Qiye’s appearance gave her hope. His miraculous abilities made her think that he would be able to oppose Sea Emperor. This was the reason why she staged the next meetings and the bet.

“I don’t know about all of that, but is it wise for you to sell yourself to me as a maid?” Li Qiye chuckled.

She pondered for a moment before replying: “Being the future queen of Sea Emperor might not be better or more prestigious than a maid.”

She ruminated on this issue plenty in the past after observing Li Qiye before making the decision.

On the surface, the answer was obvious. The queen was countless times nobler than a maid. However, she disagreed with this because she would become nothing more than a reproduction tool for sale.

Therefore, taking this risk was necessary. She bet everything on Li Qiye’s abilities.

“All I can say is that Wooden Sword is run by idiots, to give up a good seed like you.” Li Qiye laughed.

“His Majesty treated me like a daughter and taught me everything.” She shook her head.

A few opposed the engagement. Her master was one of them but unfortunately, he couldn’t make the decision alone.

“Well, since you have chosen to join my side, do your best to serve me now.” Li Qiye ended it there.

“I never regret a decision once made.” She solemnly said then went back to her task of washing his feet.

After she was finished, she left quietly instead of bothering him.

“There’s potential here.” Lu Qi appeared next to Li Qiye like a specter.

“Indeed, very smart. Worthy of further grooming.” Li Qiye smiled.
