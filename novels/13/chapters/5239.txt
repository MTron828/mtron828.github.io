Chapter 5240: Sin Absolved

“Your moment of courage absolved you, that’s why you don’t need to act as if you’re a sinner. This guilt is not your burden.” Li Qiye said.

“I know.” Boss Tang stared at the sky in a daze.

Few could compare to him in terms of prestige. Alas, the world was unpredictable and he fell to the abyss.

Although he was only an innocent child and no one blamed him, the burden of the bloodline was traumatic.

“I can’t forget the followers who were ready to die for him on the expedition… yet the old man…” He trembled while speaking.

“They definitely died with their eyes open due to indignation. Their trust and lives were buried by him. Some of them even hugged me before departing. I just can’t forget their face, their heroism, and worst of all, the heartfelt trust in their eyes…” He took a deep breath and became lost in memories again.

Emperors, progenitors, and divine beasts left for a journey and never returned again. This wasn’t due to the overwhelming enemies but because of one traitorous ally - the one they trusted the most.

“The sin of the bloodline has left a heart devil in you, only you can get rid of it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I can’t face it.” He smiled bitterly: “Perhaps the old man couldn’t either. This is our bloodline.”

“You must face it while working even harder to prove yourself as someone different. Believe in your dao heart.” Li Qiye said.

“But I’ve done nothing thus far.” He said: “I need to become as strong as the old man and go farther to accomplish this.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“You’re wrong here.” Li Qiye shook his head: “There are those stronger and have gone farther than him but they still fell to the darkness. This had nothing to do with strength. On the other hand, the ones who fell in battle without regrets, not giving up even during the last second, not wavering for a single moment. How do they compare to your father?”

He paused for a moment before responding: “He is inferior.”

“Yes.” Li Qiye said: “And you have done the same, acting despite being aware of near-certain death.”

“I just wanted to test my luck.” He said.

“You had the courage to test your luck, few could claim the same.” Li Qiye said: “With that, you have proven that it is not an issue of bloodline, but rather, the person. The old geezers knew this.”

“I’m forever grateful for how well they treated me, that’s the reason why I’m still alive.” He took a deep breath.

As the son of an unforgivable sinner, he still managed to live a good life. He understood that this was due to their protection. Otherwise, although the world was vast, there wouldn’t have been a place for him. He never saw them again but still knew that they were keeping an eye on him.

“Try not to let them down now.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I hope so.” He responded.

Li Qiye dropped the issue and said: “I’ll be taking this tree.”

“Can it be saved?” He has been searching for someone capable of mending the tree during these years.

“Mmm, hard to say.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I don’t see the other half nor do I know what had transpired.”

“I didn’t see it either.” He said: “I searched and searched and only found this half. I couldn’t withstand it any longer and had to run, maybe the other half is still there.”

With that, he stared at Li Qiye and asked with a hopeful gleam in his eyes: “Big Brother, do you think they’re still alive?”

His hands trembled since he didn’t want to hear the wrong answer. Alas, it was not up to him.

“I do not know. In theory, the impossible had happened.” Li Qiye said.

“The old geezers are supreme existences, completely unbeatable in my memories. But… that monster must have been a reincarnated immortal, so I don’t know this time.” He said.

“This world can’t have immortals. If there is one, we have some troublemakers.” Li Qiye snorted.

“I can’t think of anyone else who can wreak so much havoc outside of you, Big Brother. Even the hidden dark lords couldn’t have done it due to their deteriorated state while the old geezers were at their prime. Moreover, you took care of a bunch too.” He revealed his lack of information.

“Everything is possible.” Li Qiye said while caressing the tree. It seemed to be responding by swaying gently. However, its incompleteness was severe, unable to form a connection with another world.

“Do you have any idea of who did this?” He asked Li Qiye.

“I can only think of one. An unimaginable existence.” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed.

He shuddered. Although he witnessed the events, they just didn’t make sense because the world was enjoying everlasting peace due to Li Qiye and the old geezers’ efforts. The stability was still broken somehow.

“Then you must return and kill him.” He remained confident in Li Qiye.

“I will definitely go back.” Li Qiye stared at him and said with a smile.
