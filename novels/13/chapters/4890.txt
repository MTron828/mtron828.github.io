Chapter 4891: Imperial Seal’s Uses

“Nonsense, you didn’t think I was being serious?” Monochromatic Master laughed at Li Qiye.

“You claimed to be loyal and wanted to purge the dissidents.” Li Qiye said with a serious expression.

“Your Majesty, I didn’t expect you to be so earnest. Well, here, I’ve invited two powerful cultivators for you.” He was nearly driven to tears while tapping on Fire Ape and Toad King’s shoulder.

“Well then, I order you all to attack Wild Dynasty right now.” Li Qiye said.

“Hahaha!” The trio exchanged glances and started laughing.

Everyone could see that they were here to cause trouble, Li Qiye might be the sole exception.

“I’m gonna die.” Toad King held his stomach while guffawing.

“There is something wrong with your new king’s brains. Does he not know his own precarious situation?” Fire Ape told Monochromatic.

The latter couldn’t help laughing loudly as well. He then said: “Your Majesty, excuse me for what I’m about to do.”

With that, the three of them became ready for battle. The guests and villains immediately retreated away from the monument.

Only Venerable Dragon God or Wild Dragon could stop the trio, no one else.

“Your Majesty, I’ll be honest. With the late king’s death, this dynasty is only an empty shell and I have zero interest in it.” Monochromatic Master thought that he had full control of the situation.

He was forced to join the dynasty after being defeated by Eight-stallion Dao Lord. It was either join or die. At the very least, submitting meant being alive and having some authority.

“Eight-stallion will become piles of bricks soon enough, why would I want to stay here?” His tone became cold.

“If that’s the case, why do you want the imperial seal?” Li Qiye acted naive.

“It seems like the commander hasn’t told you.” Monochromatic glanced at Firerage.

“What?” Li Qiye asked.

“The imperial seal is not only a symbol of authority, heh, it is also the key to the treasury containing the treasures and techniques accumulated by the late king. You had no idea, did you?” Monochromatic sneered.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Guard Commander, is it true?” Li Qiye stared at Firerage.

“Yes, Your Majesty, I didn’t tell you because the timing wasn’t right.” Firerage lowered his head.

“There won’t be any opportunity in the future.” Monochromatic laughed: “This treasury will belong to us.”

He then told Firerage: “Guard Commander, I am not heartless. Hand the imperial seal and I’ll let you leave.”

The implication was clear - telling Firerage to kill Li Qiye and take the seal.

Though he didn’t care about his reputation, he had worked for Eight-stallion Dao Lord before. Killing Li Qiye meant branding himself as a traitor. He preferred for Firerage to shoulder this infamy instead.

“Traitor, I will not let you harm His Majesty even if it’s the last thing I do.” Firerage strongly responded.

“Haha, what a loyal subject.” Monochromatic smirked: “Well, you will be able to contribute today.”

He then told Li Qiye: “Your Majesty, will you hand the seal over, or do I have to chop off your head first?”

“What a hard decision.” Li Qiye looked around while touching his nose.

“No need to look around, no one will be able to save you. Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God are busy right now with Wild Dynasty.” Monochromatic said. It seemed that Wild Dynasty came under his calling.

“Okay, fellow guests, do whatever you want since Eight-stallion will be no more after today.” He then told the rest of the crowd.

“Hear that, you brats? Aren’t you here to get a piece of the pie? Get started already.” Toad King told the villains.

“Go!” Some villains started shouting and attacking the soldiers and officials.

“Treasures shall be ours!” Others shouted and rushed toward the palaces, wanting to rob anything of value.

“Maintain your post! Protect the dynasty!” The captains and commanders were ready to stop the villains.

Chaotic battles ensued in the blink of an eye. Screams and cries could be heard everywhere.

As for the neutral guests from the prestigious sects, they tried their best to not be dragged into this mess. Some started leaving right away.

“The dynasty is finished. Your Majesty, hand the imperial seal over.” Monochromatic demanded.

“Don’t even think about it.” Firerage stood by Li Qiye and ignored the other skirmishes.

“Your Majesty, this is the final warning.” Monochromatic said.

“Your Majesty, there is another way to prevent Eight-stallion from falling.” The spectating Demoness suddenly spoke again.

“Oh, what is it?” Li Qiye asked.

“Let me be the regent and tell Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God to obey me, I will protect you from these villains.” She suggested while an enchanting and beautiful glint flashed in her eyes.

She wanted the dynasty as a whole, not a broken one. It would be meaningless to rule without Northern Monarch or Venerable Dragon God. This was her opportunity to be a rightful regent.

“Guest Minister, don’t forget your role. This is the time for you to support His Majesty.” Firerage chastised.

“Guard Commander, I have no obligation to do so. In fact, being the regent is my way of showing support.” Demoness said.

“Demoness, don’t you know that it’s easy for us three to kill you and your Warship?” Monochromatic sneered given the circumstances.

“Feel free to try, Civic Deputy.” Demoness smiled.

Her confidence took him by surprise. He didn’t know whether she was putting on an act because Warship’s actual power remained unknown.
