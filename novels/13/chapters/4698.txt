Chapter 4699: No Need

Li Qiye’s decision surprised and disappointed spectators. Earlier, he mustered an incredible amount of energy from the spear.

Some believe that he was virtually unbeatable with it in his grasp and Tian Feng was finished. Who the hell would give up such a dominating weapon when facing someone like Tian Feng?

In fact, others salivated and would risk their lives to obtain this patrimony weapon. Thus, they were astounded to see him returning it without any hesitation.

“How heroic and grand.” A big shot whispered: “This is during an important battle too, he’s definitely a top candidate to become the next dao lord.”

The big shots here appreciated both Tian Feng and Li Qiye’s style.

The former wanted to test himself and went as far as lending his opponent a patrimony weapon. The latter returned it without a care, not showing a sliver of greed.

“Don’t worry, I’ll fulfill your wish of destruction.” Li Qiye said.

Others exchanged glances and didn’t think that this was possible. Nonetheless, they gave Li Qiye enough respect by not calling him out on it.

“Hahaha!” Tian Feng laughed heartily, releasing unbearable soundwaves. Listeners from a safe distance felt their chest being hit repeatedly.

“I refuse to believe that you can take me down with your bare hands. No one in the world can.” He stated.

“Come.” Li Qiye gestured provocatively.

“Fine, take this!” Tian Feng leaped into the air again.

Due to his massive frame, his body actually smashed some stars along the way. During the descent, it caused nonstop explosions and the ground started shaking.

This was akin to another planet shooting downward, leaving behind a fiery trail. His body became ablaze.

“I’m coming!” He roared.

A terrible force came before the gigantic frog and flattened everything about the impact point.

“Goddamn!” Some cultivators bellowed in horror after seeing this.

Once Tian Feng struck Li Qiye’s area, the peaks nearby immediately turned into dust. Only a crater was left behind for the frightened spectators to see.

Not to mention one person, even a sect would have been annihilated regardless of its defensive measures.

“Is he dead?” A cultivator calmed down and asked.

“I think so.” A clan disciple’s knees were still buckling. In his opinion, no one could survive that impact.

“No, he’s still there!” A keen-eyed ancestor noticed something and shouted.

Sure enough, Li Qiye was completely unharmed while standing in the center of the crater. He managed to block Tian Feng’s gigantic frame with his index finger.

This was akin to an ant using its antennae to lift up an elephant. The impossible occurred in front of everyone. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Uh… what… how…” Many couldn’t accept this illogical development - a finger pushing up Tian Feng.

Before they could calm down, they saw Li Qiye gripping Tian Feng’s leg and spinning him in the air. This started a vortex of unthinkable proportion.

Trees and the water of rivers started being pulled into the vortex. The rotational speed was out of this world. Eventually, it became a spatio-temporal vortex - a void zone of death.

“Run away!” Big shots regained their wits and started running away.

“This is insanity!” A spectator shouted after seeing Li Qiye capable of playing a game with Tian Feng. The latter was helpless and could only play along.
