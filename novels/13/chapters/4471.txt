Chapter 4472: The Lu

“The last stone.” Purpose said: “Let’s go to the Lu to negotiate then.”

Their expression looked rather strange when the Lu was brought up.

“I don’t think there is anyone in charge after the geezer’s passing.” Wise murmured.

“The current clan master is Daqi who is up there in age now.” Jian Ming shrugged.

“We need to go because the last stone is required anyway.” Wise Ancestor decided. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

They knew that all four stones were essential for the union. However, there seemed to be something going on with the Lu.

“Virtuous Nephew, I think you might be able to convince their clan master for the dao stone.” Wise Ancestor suggested.

“Hehehe.” Jian Ming laughed: “Ancestors, don’t make it hard for a junior like me. The Lu Clan Master might not do anything crazy but he might either close the door or hit me with a broom.”

He made it clear that he didn’t want to go to the Lu.

“Our four clans have always been one, he won’t be that bad.” Purpose said without confidence.

“Hah, hard to say. My old man tried to come express sympathy last year but he didn’t even get inside.” Jian Ming laughed.

“I came for the funeral as well but the Lu didn’t see me. At least they gave me enough face to not chase me away with brooms.” Wise sighed and said.

“Looks like it is impossible to get the dao stone from them then.” Jian Ming said: “The Lu probably didn’t want to do it back then, just like everyone else, no?”

Everyone’s expression became awkward after hearing this.

“Let’s go and see.” Wise Ancestor pondered for a bit before speaking: “We must have the last stone.”

“What if they simply refuse?” Purpose prepared for the worst?

“Hmm, steal or rob?” Jian Ming’s eyes rolled back and forth.

“Not suitable.” Wise shook his head: “How can we steal from family? Preposterous.”

“The boy has a point.” Purpose said.

“We can only do our best, persuade them with feelings and logic.” Wise decided.

It seemed that the trio wasn’t optimistic about their chances in the slightest.

“Who will be the messenger?” Jian Ming shrugged: “Not me, they didn’t give my old man any face, so they’ll do the same to a junior like me.”

This left the group in a tough position. Since they were ancestors, they couldn’t handle being refused entry at the door. It would be too humiliating.

“Fine, I’ll go to the Lu for the last stone.” Li Qiye who has been staring at the tree interrupted the group.

“You will ,Young Noble?” The trio was caught by surprise.

“Your four clans are connected with me, it is worth my effort.” Li Qiye said.

They didn’t understand this connection he brought up. Nonetheless, they absolutely would never refuse his suggestion.

“We’ll go together with you, Young Noble.” Wise suggested.

“Let’s prepare some gifts to show our sincerity.” Purpose hurriedly said.

Li Qiye stared at them and said: “Seems like there is some guilty conscience going on here. Did your three clans team up and bully the Lu?”

“No, of course not…” Purpose smiled awkwardly and answered with a feeble tone.

“Then why the guilty conscience?” Li Qiye asked.

They couldn’t answer right away. Eventually, Wise coughed and said: “The truth is that it was just a misunderstanding. We had no intention of bullying them, it’s just that it had to be done back then for the Lu to avoid trouble. It was the best choice for the Lu and everyone. Plus, we’re trying our best to compensate them for it.”

“Best for the Lu and everyone? A lot of assholes in the world try to justify their actions by bringing up the greater good when in reality, it was selfish in nature. Worst of all, they would assume the moral high ground too.” Li Qiye criticized.

The trio had no response once more.

“Compensation is absolutely in order.” Jian Ming eventually said: “The four clans are one. Though there is a crack, we should try our best to mend it.”

“Right, the feud shouldn’t continue.” The two ancestors solemnly nodded.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye said and descended. The trio hurried after him.

***

This was no longer the golden age of the four clans. They weren’t prestigious and famous across the realm any longer.

However, their land was still fertile and their population was relatively acceptable. The only exception was the Lu.

Their declination was awfully apparent compared to the other three. Their territories were just as large as their counterparts. However, they were barren; even the streets looked abandoned.

It seemed that their population was declining at a rapid rate, making it harder for them to prosper and keep up with business.

Of course, the other three clans didn’t take advantage of this to take over the Lu’s towns. They, at the very least, maintained this final line and still considered the Lu as family.

Sure enough, as the group entered the Lu, they could see the desolation along the way.

The other three clans didn’t produce any supreme genius but at least they still had many descendants. The same couldn’t be said about the Lu.
