Chapter 5369: Who Are You?

In reality, there was another person who followed Li Qiye - Jue Xian’er. Unlike Ferocity, she kept a distance and only came slightly closer after seeing that Li Qiye was fine with it. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ferocity noticed her and didn’t comment. He didn’t wish to antagonize her because he didn’t have a way to stop her Immortal Piercer. Being locked by it meant certain death; there was a long list of famous victims including Heavenlight Dao Lord.

Few dared to provoke her after his death because she was merciless. This time around, she walked with her hands hanging down and a somewhat reserved demeanor - changing from an arrogant conqueror to a young maid serving her master for the first time.

“Go take a walk.” Li Qiye glanced at her and said.

Ferocity understood and tapped Xiao Hu’s shoulder. He laughed and said: “Brat, there’s something fun up ahead, I’ll take you.”

He pulled the youth with him before getting permission and ran off with lightning speed. They disappeared in no time at all while Xiao Hu’s scream echoed from afar.

Being able to read the situation was the reason for Ferocity’s success and survival. He only became arrogant after becoming a capable cultivator.

With them gone, Jue Xian’er caught up and walked shoulder-to-shoulder with Li Qiye.

“Your Evil Devourer is genuine.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“You can tell, Young Noble?” She bowed and wasn’t caught off guard by it.

She did cultivate a section of the Supreme Four Truths left behind by her father, Righteous Dao Lord.

“In that case, do you have any advice in case I have errored?” She asked.

“You are already a conqueror with a strong grip on the dao, not to mention having an orthodox starting point. I’m sure your father left behind proper explanations.” Li Qiye said.

She nodded because he was right.

Her father was Righteous Dao Lord and her mother shared the same name as hers. This was known to the entire world.

However, they didn’t know that she had access to her father’s legacy as well.

He was gifted and was able to properly derive the heavenly scripture. He then educated her on the right path. This solid foundation allowed her to become a conqueror.

“He was a great man.” She said softly.

Although she was no longer an abandoned orphan and her current success rivaled her parents’, she still felt sadness when talking about them.

The two of them were a perfect couple but in the end, they became enemies during Emperor War. Both died in battle subsequently.

She didn’t know who was right or wrong; both had their own perspective and reason. As a conqueror, her mental fortitude exceeded that of regular cultivators. Nonetheless, her parents’ fate still left a lingering wound.

“Pain is a part of life.” Li Qiye broke the brief silence: “Humans will always have emotions even if they embark on the dao path. Emotions serve as the driving force, one strong enough for them to endure the pain and suffering.”

He paused for a moment before continuing: “You are talented and possess a unique interpretation of the dao. However, if you cannot get over this matter, there will be a crack in your dao heart and you will waver one day.”

“How do I mend it?” She asked, mustering the courage to face her trauma.

She has been alone ever since her parents left her due to her distrust of everything. This left her unable to express her emotions and trauma to anyone else. Others viewed her as a cold and brutal conqueror, always keeping a distance.

Alas, she still had a beating heart beneath her chilling exterior. She finally met someone who wasn’t afraid of Immortal Piercer that she could talk to.

Taking this next step required courage and trust in Li Qiye. Keep in mind that the two of them had antagonistic confrontations in the past.

She somehow thought that this was her one chance to change her way and finally took the difficult leap.

She was well aware of her current mental and cultivation deficiencies. Fixing them was essential or she would be stuck in the current realm until death.

The crack in her dao heart caused stagnation. If she were to forcefully break through, she might suffer qi deviation and grievous injuries.

“Who are you?” Li Qiye unexpectedly asked.

“Jue Xian’er.” She still answered, albeit confused.

“No, you are Li Xian’er.” Li Qiye gently stroked her long hair before touching her forehead with one finger.

“Buzz.” She trembled while being engulfed in a flashing radiance. Something illuminated her mind in a comforting manner - a warm sensation she hadn’t felt after becoming an orphan.
