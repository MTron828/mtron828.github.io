Chapter 4727: River Demon of Death

The comment instilled a gruesome image into all listeners. Anyone else saying this would have been laughed out of the room for being ignorant.

In fact, some big shots would be annoyed and might decide to teach the speaker a lesson.

This naturally didn’t apply to Li Qiye. Ancient ancestors had no problem with him saying this either.

He had earned the right to speak his mind without bothering the crowd since they had no choice but to obediently accept.

After all, he showed his strength by forcing Speargrasp to meet his maker. How many could actually stop him?

Prior to this, everyone thought that opposing True Immortal was suicidal. Now, they shared a similar sentiment with Li Qiye.

He killed members of the behemoths without batting an eye. Therefore, no one felt safe opposing him.

“Hahaha, it’s been a while since I’ve heard such domineering words.” A voice accompanied by a chilling game appeared.

An old man appeared by the border of the battlefield; no one saw how he got there.

He had the height of a dwarf yet he was also skinny and feeble. At first sight, people thought that he had three heads but in reality, he only had one. The other two were skulls from young children propped on top of his shoulders. Who knows if he had killed them or merely picked the skulls up somewhere? All in all, this creeped spectators out.

He had a shabby banner from an ancient period. It was also wet like a piece of trash fished up from a river.

“The river demon!” He seemed to be a famous character. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The moment people recognized him, they staggered backward with fear - ancestors included.

Those from the east were particularly afraid of him. Even the ancient ancestors didn’t want to be involved with this notorious figure.

“This geezer is here too?” An eastern ancient ancestor waved his hand exasperatedly, clearly hating the demon yet not daring to do anything about it.

“The River Demon of Death is extremely powerful.” Someone said.

He was notorious way before becoming one of Five-sun King’s three saints.

“I’ve heard that he turned a kingdom into a cemetery once with countless wailing spirits.” An expert said with dread.

Massacres weren’t rare in the cultivation world. However, only a few tormented the dead as well. This demon was one of them, twisting the souls of the dead after massacring their kingdom.

Nonetheless, some weren’t surprised to see him here since Five-sun King was already present.

“I saw him before, he didn’t look like this.” Another took a closer look at him. He had the appearance of a child previously.

“He’s a river demon, a bizarre existence. We don’t know his true form.” A big shot from the east shook his head.

Li Qiye glanced at him and then said: “Just an insignificant demon with a putrid smell, rotting like dead fish.” He then waved his sleeve dismissively as if trying to blow away the smell.

His disdainful distaste for the demon astounded the crowd. None dared to do so, only treating the demon with reverence out of fear.

“Insignificant demon?” Others exchanged glances with wide-opened eyes.

The river demon has lived for generations, an unfortunate fact for his countless victims. He has never experienced this blatant contempt before, not even from the ancient ancestors or the monarchs from the behemoths.

“Hahaha, junior, killing you won’t be enough. I will also refine your soul and prevent you from reincarnating for eras, a fate worse than death.” He revealed a nefarious smirk.

“Calm down now.” A dignified voice stopped the livid demon from attacking Li Qiye.

Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor arrived with a pulsing divinity. Behind him were ancient ancestors from True Immortal.

They wore concealing robes to hide their identity. Nonetheless, their ancient aura was still frightening and intimidated the crowd.

The river demon was dreadful due to his evil nature. However, True Immortal’s group represented invincibility.

“Rumble!” Laws of the grand dao detonated afterward, starting a cycle of boundless derivation.

Everyone felt an invisible hand pushing down and nearly breaking their spine.

“Six Dao Monarch!” They looked around but didn’t see anyone. Alas, they knew that this monarch was here.
