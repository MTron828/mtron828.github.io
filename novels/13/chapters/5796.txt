Chapter 5796: Not Hair

“Sacred Teacher, I understand what you’re saying, but I roam the mortal realm and know nothing of them any longer.” Jiao Heng let out a sigh and said.

“That’s fine, do as you wish. You have one more move.” Li Qiye said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“And I will make it fun.” Jiao Heng laughed.

“Don’t let me down now, mortal.” Li Qiye gestured provocatively.

“Of course!” Jiao Heng laughed and released the divine rings in the mech’s arms.

They pulsed outward and destroyed stars along the way - a testament to the mech’s immense destructiveness.

This was only the beginning - the bundles of hair behind its back started moving. Due to their size, they looked like colossal celestial rivers.

A mech having hair was rather strange. What was the point of it? It seemed unnecessary. They flew toward one direction - Celestial Palace - and pinned themselves to the walls.

The vast palace always pulsed with heavenly light. Now, the hair looked like tubes and started absorbing the power of the palace.

This took everyone by surprise. A while back, Nether Emperor was able to draw out an enormous sum of energy from the palace. The tubes took it to the next level, taking all the rays.

“Looks like they’re dao channels, not hair.” An emperor commented, realizing the reason for the mech’s design.

“Given its strength, it can probably sap an entire world in just a short time.” Another’s expression darkened while thinking about the six continents as a possible target.

It drained life force as well, not just dao power, affinities, and essences. Not to mention mortals and beasts, emperors themselves wouldn’t be able to escape the tragic fate.

“A weapon capable of destroying or devouring worlds shouldn’t exist.” A monarch shuddered and said.

They thought about the consequences of having questionable pilots. For example, Jiao Heng was powerful enough to control it on his own.

What if he were to fall into the darkness one day? He and the mech would put an end to everything, leaving only behind wastelands devoid of life - a more terrifying place than hell.

Moreover, the temptation was there. What if the pilot could channel the power absorbed by the mech into themselves? If Jiao Here were to do so, he might reach a monstrous level after absorbing enough worlds.

“The darkness calls.” Most trembled after thinking about this.

They have thought about the consequences in the past but never to a profound extent. They believed that they could fight the temptation, that it was a matter of choice.

Jiao Heng became the perfect reference point and some thought they wouldn’t be able to resist. After absorbing this area, they might move on to the outside world.

A fight between emperors was devastating enough - a calamity for mortals and kingdoms. However, they often exercised restraint to minimize needless casualties.

This would no longer be the case once they made up their mind to join the darkness and used the mech to its fullest potential.

“Must not fall into darkness or I will be the end of my world.” A Grand Emperor murmured, stating what was on everyone’s mind.

They then suspected everyone else. A fallen emperor could cause immense damage to the six continents.

“What if someone stronger were to fall...” A monarch thought of this point.

Emperors were strong, but what about supreme overlords? What if they were to fall?

Supreme overlords would be able to devour everything. Emperors such as themselves were no more than delicious meals - a truly frightening thought.
