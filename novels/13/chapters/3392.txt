Lu Yiling’s blood spread out like a blooming flower. Everyone saw the whole thing and felt suffocated.

The entire region knew how strong he was. Now, he was killed by a single slash.

They became emotional; some pitied his lamentable fate. Others became stricken with fear.

His final attack was monstrous, to say the least, but it still wasn’t enough. Li Qiye’s sword flash rendered all opposition futile.

“There’s one fewer genius in this world now.” A spectator wrung his wrist then said.

Lu Yiling from now on would be remembered as a heroic man. His previous enemies had a newfound respect for him.

A while later, once the crowd calmed down, they stared at Li Qiye with nothing but admiration and fear in their eyes. Most lowered their head, no longer daring to look at him in the eyes.

He simply stood there without exuding any aura. He didn’t look different from a regular disciple of Divine Black.

Alas, this leisure style of his seemed invincible in the eyes of others. No one dared to cause trouble in front of him any longer.

At the same time, the members of Divine Black were on their knees - thousands of them.

The scene fell into silence due to the permeating fear.

“No, no...” Only one person was speaking - the sect master of Three Truths.

He couldn’t move beneath the claw of the golden dragon. Alas, he preferred to be dead right now after seeing Lu Yiling’s outcome. Pain and despair took over.

He taught Lu Yiling ever since the youth joined Three Truths. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he alone brought Yiling to the current height.

Their relationship could be described as master-teacher or even father-son. He always had nothing but pride in Yiling.

Today, their army has been destroyed. Lu Yiling’s death also extinguished all hope for Three Truths. This was too much for him to take.

People only stared at him, not having the same sympathy as they did for Yiling.

The winner takes all - this was too common in the world of cultivation. Moreover, he led his army to attack Divine Black. If they were to win, then Divine Black would be the one suffering right now.

Therefore, he brought this upon himself and couldn’t blame anyone.

“Still think about leaving?” Li Qiye suddenly spoke.

The crowd followed his gaze and saw the saber master trying to hide among the crowd. He became frozen and didn’t dare to move.

They realized that there were two survivors now - Three Truths Sect Master and Xu Nan.

Xu Nan was naturally scared out of his mind. It took everything for him to remain standing instead of kneeling.

He eventually took a deep breath and managed to subdue his fear. He smiled wryly and said: “Well... there’s nothing left to do here, Young Noble Li’s cultivation is matchless. This lowly one doesn’t dare to stay here as an eyesore.”

Many exchanged glances after listening. Xu Nan was considered a big shot in the northern West King. He was also a guest cultivator in Yin Yang Gate - something quite prestigious.

Alas, he spoke as humbly as possible right now, going as far as possible by referring to himself as “this lowly one”.

Nonetheless, no one would make fun of him for this. They might not have the courage to even face Li Qiye and might already be prostrating and begging for forgiveness.

“Did you forget what I said? No one is leaving this place alive.” Li Qiye smiled.

Xu Nan’s complexion turned gray; his hands started shaking. He tried his best to not lose his cool.

Similar to the sect master earlier, the crowd didn’t sympathize with him. He went along with the invasion so he deserved this.

“I really have no ill wills towards you, Young Noble.” Xu Nan’s smile was more unsightly than if he were crying right now. He continued: “It’s just a bad coincidence, that’s all. My fault for...”

“Make your move. I’ll give you one chance.” Li Qiye interrupted him.

Xu Nan’s legs started shaking. He didn’t have the courage to attack.

He along with everyone else knew the obvious outcome. He would be killed just like Lu Yiling.

“Young Noble Li, what’s the point of killing one more person?” He tried his best to speak clearly: “I’ve already admitted defeat. Having one more friend is better than another enemy. Plus, I am with Yin Yang Gate. We might be able to help you in the future.” He chose his words delicately in order to survive.

This naturally served as a threat too, reminding Li Qiye that he had ties with Yin Yang Gate. They wouldn’t let this go unpunished.

This sect was known to be the strongest in the northern region. One needed to think twice before opposing them. This applied to every sect, not just an individual. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Never heard of it. Stop wasting time, make your move before I finish you.” Li Qiye chuckled.

Xu Nan grimaced, realizing that an escape wasn’t possible. Alas, he still had enough pride that prevented him from getting on his knees.

“Must you go this far, Young Noble?” Xu Nan maintained his composure and stared directly at Li Qiye.

“In the case of victory, would you have spared a regular disciple from Divine Black asking for it?” Li Qiye smiled.

Xu Nan didn’t respond. The crowd didn’t say anything either.

A complete massacre wasn’t unheard of after defeat. Three Truths wouldn’t have spared a single disciple after achieving victory.
