Chapter 5202: Smells Familiar

Boss Tang was a unique existence in a world reigned by conquerors and dao lords. Sovereigns and dragon lords were also everywhere along with the occasional sightings of gods.

They were the rulers of this world; merchants shouldn’t be uttered in the same breath. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, Boss Tang always commanded attention. This included the most brilliant emperors and conquerors.

He operated a particular shop that might only be open for business every ten thousand years or so. It became the wake-up call for many slumbering existences.

The merchandise consisted of highly-coveted treasures meant for top cultivators. Joining the auction alone required tremendous power and resources.

There were thirteen thrones outside of the ship, meaning that only thirteen powers and individuals were eligible to enter.

Despite the renowned prestige of the auction, people knew very little about Boss Tang.

Rumor has it that he came from Eight Desolaces. Others said that he has been around since time immemorial. A particular belief stated that Boss Tang was actually an organization, not a singular man.

Some top conquerors had tried to find his origin before but came up with nothing. He was enigmatic, arrogant, and inscrutable. He never held back, always acting true to his desire regardless of the opponent.

This attitude was made possible due to his frightening power. This was why no one dared to rob him despite his wealth.

Both the old man and Li Qiye sniffed the air.

“Smells familiar.” The old man said.

“It’s there.” Li Qiye smiled but was in no hurry to make a move.

“Boss Tang, what do you have for the auction this time?” A cheerless voice resounded from the sky, piercing through heavens and earth like a sword.

Everyone felt as if they were being suppressed by an ultimate sword user, finding it hard to catch their breath.

“Sword Sea Dao Lord!” They all became startled.

He was one of the few entities capable of changing the future direction of the upper continents after taking over Principle Conqueror’s position in Divine Alliance.

A sea creature from Eight Desolaces actually managing to become the leader of Divine Alliance was shocking. This was a testament to his ability.

“Four decent items this time.” Boss Tang leisurely responded.

“Heaven Reckon, Dream Immortal Order, and a Reincarnation Nine-leaves.” He elaborated.

“!!!” The names of these three treasures shocked listeners.

“Dream Immortal Order?! One is still around?!” An ancient ancestor stood up and became overwhelmed with excitement.

“Where did he get one?” A conqueror felt the same way since this treasure was thought to be extinct.

“Heaven Reckon… I think I’ve heard about it before, a legendary ruler.” An ancient god found this title familiar. [1]

“It is deeply connected to Buddhism.” Someone else remembered its origin and took a deep breath.

However, the oldest emperors and dao lords were only interested in the third item - Reincarnation Nine-leaves.

“A chance to live again, perhaps.” An ancient emperor’s eyes pulsed with an intimidating light.

Any emperor at this point was near the end of their lifespan. They had consumed countless longevity plants in the past and couldn’t delay the inevitable. However, this item was one of the rare exceptions.

If they could somehow use it and achieve reincarnation, they would be able to live another life.

“I thought there was only one left.” A big shot asked his friend who was a king.

“As far as I know, Azure Peak has it.” The king responded.

“Where did Boss Tang get another then?” Everyone became curious.

This alchemy plant’s value was beyond words. Only one was known to exist and Azure Peak didn’t let anyone get close.

“The four alliances will compete for it since they can recruit an apex emperor with it.” The big shot said.

“It’s no different for the immortal order since everyone can use it. When was the last time one showed up? Entering the dream realm will change one’s destiny.” The friend said.

“What about the fourth treasure?” Someone else noticed that Boss Tang had only listed three things.
