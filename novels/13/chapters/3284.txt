The children began training their fist technique again in spite of the taunts and sneers. They had their own opinion of this merit law as well as an unconditional trust in Li Qiye. Whatever he taught them should be the best. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Young Master, we can really knock Senior Brother Zhan Hu’s teeth out?” One older child stopped and said with hesitation.

Due to his age, he knew more about Zhan Hu’s strength. This sapped his confidence.

“The you right now will lose but keep on training. It won’t be a problem later.” Li Qiye gave him a quick glance.

The boy became ecstatic and focused again, paying full attention to the smallest movements.

Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile after seeing the sincere expression on their faces. Pure ones like them had an easy time cultivating the dao since they didn’t have other distractions. This type of dao heart bred greater comprehension.

On the other hand, the ones from the powerful clans or those who have been in the sect longer, they had more on their mind with less focus on the grand dao.

For example, they wouldn’t cultivate Tortoise Fist because others would laugh at them. Or, they couldn’t resist the temptation of better merit laws.

The Liu children didn’t have this distraction. They immersed themselves at a high level during this training session to learn the three actions.

One’s innate talents didn’t matter as much with the help of a wise teacher. They only needed patience and perseverance to succeed. That’s why Li Qiye was bullish about their future.

Li Qiye’s challenge was known across the sect. Many certainly considered him to be ignorant and having an exaggerated opinion of his own abilities.

What would be the result of an Iron Skin versus a Sadmahi Materialization cultivator? The former wouldn’t last a single second.

“I can’t wait to see that guy lament before death.” Her fans were outraged after hearing his unreasonable demand.

“I’m sure Junior Sister will spare him but he’ll have no place to go in Divine Black. Someone else will take care of him.” Another snorted.

Normally, a fight between regular disciples wouldn’t earn the attention of the peak lords. However, Gong Qianyue wasn’t a regular disciple. All five peak lords heard about it right away.

South Conch Peak.

“There’s something wrong with this Li Qiye’s brain, daring to challenge Qianyue.” The messenger said while reporting this to Ping Suoweng.

“Don’t be so hasty to jump to conclusions. Anything is possible in this world.” Suoweng said while stared at the horizon.

The messenger couldn’t imagine anything different. How could an Iron Skin defeat someone in the materialization realm? How ridiculous.

“What is he trying to do? Do you think he can beat the girl?” Mountainbearer King asked his disciple.

He wasn’t looking down on Li Qiye but the circumstances demanded doubts.

“Well...” Fuyou didn’t know how to respond and took a while before replying: “The answer should be obvious but in the case of the young master, I don’t know.”

“A miracle will happen?” The king shook his head: “One realm is possible by using treasures, techniques, or some external schemes. We’re talking about six realms here, nothing can overcome this.”

“Plus, the girl cultivates one of our strongest merit laws, Black Tortoise Imperial Art. Need I say more about her treasures?” He smiled wryly and added.

“True, even our generation is feeling the pressure. Very few are stronger than her.” Fuyou admitted. Fuyou before his dao problem wasn’t that much stronger than her.

Zhang Yue was the oldest in their generation and joined the sect the earliest. He was also talented as well, not as great as Su Xu but still superior to most of his peers.

He was only at the yin yang realm right now. It wouldn’t be long until she caught up and surpassed him.

That’s why it was inconceivable for Li Qiye to defeat such an amazing genius. It went against all conventional wisdom.

“The path towards the dao is extremely long so some miracles will happen along the way.” Mountainbearer King said: “But, one can’t always rely on miracles and luck, only true strength. Not adhering to this rule is why so many geniuses die young.”

“Young Master is different from the rest. This is what makes him special.” Fuyou agreed with the king’s point of view but still added.

“We’ll see soon enough.” The king chuckled.

“Such nonsense.” Iron Rod Demon King snorted after hearing this news.

“I can’t believe how dumb this Li Qiye is.” The messenger hurriedly added.

“It’ll be clear then. Now, arrange to recruit talented disciples after the examination. Don’t let Thousand Demons get ahead of us.” The king narrowed his eyes.

The four peaks would always pick disciples after each examination at Jade Bird.

“Junior Brother Zhan Hu had prepared a list. He knows all the talented ones there.” The messenger handed a list over.

Furious Tiger had a great advantage because Zhan Hu was the current First Brother in Jade Bird. He knew many disciples there, especially the demons. This made it easy for him to pick the right ones for Furious Tiger.

As for the bodhi king, his eyes became profound and said: “The son of miracles, maybe another one this time?”

“I highly doubt it.” The disciple nearby replied: “His power is insignificant compared to Qianyue’s.”

“Don’t forget, Qianyue only activated five while he activated thirteen.” The king glanced over.

“Hmm, well, I can’t attribute this to anything other than sheer luck, just a coincidence.” The disciple paused for a moment.

“A coincidence?” The king said flatly: “If you were to go right now, how many can you activate? I’ll let you try a thousand times. How many thirteen activated blocks will you get?”

The disciple remained silent since he had no confidence.

“The show is only beginning. It’ll be lively here soon.” The king put on a wide smile.

As for Li Qiye, he was preoccupied with his own merit laws while training the children. These sessions happened every single day without fail.

During this period, many disciples from Divine Black considered this a waste of time and talents. Those who passed by would express their disdain.

However, one disciple became interested in Tortoise Fist and watched from a distance during the last several days. He didn’t want to bother them.

He became enthralled during this observation and didn’t share the same contempt towards Tortoise Fist like his peers.
