Chapter 5029: Heaven’s Wrath

It didn’t matter how strong Li Qiye was, he was essentially fighting himself while inflicting damage with the resulting flames.

“Activate.” Li Qiye played along and added more power. A bright light erupted as his dao, energy, and blood burned each other. There was no getting away from My Brilliance.

“Is this it?!” Jun Cuican became excited.

His allies felt the same way, not expecting his dao to be so magical. Cuican was confident in his dao but yes, there was an issue with speed. As Li Qiye had said, it didn’t become effective fast enough.

Thus, it wasn’t useful in a real battle because no combatant would stand still for the dao to hit them. If his enemies were willing to just stand there, he wouldn’t even need to use this dao.

Therefore, Li Qiye was a rare exception who purposely got caught by the dao. This seemed rather suicidal.

“Who else can create a dao like this?” Skystomper said with admiration.

As dragon lords, he and the others have created their own dao. Alas, these dao paled compared to what Jun Cuican had created.

“Not bad at all.” Wild Dragon laughed heartily: “I hate how annoying you are, arrogant brat, but I am truly impressed by this supreme grand dao.”

“Go now, stop wasting time!” Radiant Monarch, on the other hand, thought that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

“Make your move! I will also assist.” Jun Cuican shouted.

“Very well!” Swordgrasp Venerable summoned thousands of swords to form a larger blade. Its murderous intent ravaged the battlefield.

“Luminous Law!” Cuican performed a power-boost spell on the old man.

The latter’s sacred fruits became resplendent and his sword energy surged exponentially.

“Boom!” Everyone in Demon felt his sword energy clearly. They left cut marks all over the ground and mountains.

“Heavenwrath.” At the same time, Radiant Monarch leaped into the air while shouting.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lightning bolts descended and flowed around him.

“Buzz.” He wielded the power of light imbued with a heavenly tribulation. After a brief moment, the various affinities turned into a spear.

It represented the wrath of heaven itself, capable of punishing dissenters. Cultivators and demons fell to the ground as if they didn’t have a skeleton.

Skystomper and Pagoda Guardian’s knees buckled as well. All cultivators were afraid of the heaven.

“Luminous Law!” Jun Cuican blessed him as well.

“Rumble!” The lightning bolts became far more powerful and numerous. The end of the world appeared above Demon.

The sheer power of the heaven’s wrath immobilized all existences.

“Go!” Radiant Monarch and Swordgrasp Venerable shouted at the same time.

“Clank!” Time seemed to be reversing as the old man swung his sword.

“Boom!” Radiant Monarch threw the spear with all of his might.

The world turned dark instantly. The only thing visible to spectators was Li Qiye stopping the two attacks with his hands.

Alas, as the two raised their power, he tried to do the same but couldn’t. The internal conflict within him ignited into an ocean of flames. This implosion could reduce him to dust as long as he kept trying to channel his power.

“Die!” Wild Dragon joined the fray and spewed out true draconic flames.

“Luminous Law!” Jun Cuican didn’t forget to bless him as well and increased the temperature.

“Zz…” The flames turned into a fiery pulse as a result, burning all affinities along the way.
