“Someone who has lived for three generations!” The monarch gasped with a coursing chill after hearing this. She had always imagined just how wondrous these top existences would be but it still shocked her all the same. Such a being was beyond her imagination.

Though many Godking ancestors have lived for a long time in Mortal Emperor, they were always buried underground, not a real type of living. It was more apt to call it a hibernation to suspend their lifespan.

Even Godkings and Emperor Candidates would only live for one generation at best before dying.

Thus, living for three was too terrorizing. She has heard about the legends. There was only one person who has lived for three generations - her progenitor, the Black Dragon King!

The old man naturally could see her demeanor. He calmly spoke without any pride: “I’m only a wandering soul living a borrowed life, in no way comparable to a supreme talent like the Black Dragon King. Our situation is not the same.”

“Stop it, Zhengfeng. No need to be humble. You might not be the Black Dragon King’s match but you are still an existence that could only be count on one’s fingers in the nine worlds. When you fought Immortal Emperor Qian Li back then, you actually survived under his true Imperial Massacre. That’s an exceedingly rare achievement.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

This stunned the monarch completely. She even shuddered and understood just how powerful this being he had just introduced her to was.

A true Imperial Massacre could only be unleashed by an emperor when they channeled the power of their Heaven’s Will to unleash the ultimate blow of a life treasure.

Keep in mind that for millions of year now, many have claimed to have challenged emperors. Despite their defeat, it was still a commendable feat.

In fact, during these challenges, the emperors only used ordinary methods to fight them without utilizing the Heaven’s Will due to the unimaginable power of the latter.

Alas, this old man was able to survive a true attack from Immortal Emperor Qian Li. This was quite a feat.

“It’s because the emperor didn’t wish to kill me.” The old man sighed.

His humility didn’t diminish his achievement. Even an Emperor Assailant would die before a true attack like this.

The monarch finally regained her wits and bowed again towards the old man. Words were meaningless at this point.

Li Qiye waved his sleeve at her and said: “Leave for a bit, I have some personal business to discuss with Zhengfeng.”

The monarch quietly nodded and left with her mind still shaken. This old man was definitely powerful enough yet he still acted so respectfully towards Li Qiye. Who the hell was this guy to make a peak existence treat him in this manner?

Li Qiye smiled and said after she left: “No need to be so reserved. Sit. Not too many are left now. I can only have some nostalgic conversation with you and your sister.”

The old man bowed his head before sitting. He was only a junior before the Dark Crow in spite of his considerable power.

“Your Excellency, you’re here for Gu Zun?” He asked.

“I suppose. That and I want to take back Heaven Suppression. I don’t necessarily have to kill him because of the Black Dragon King but a punishment must be in order. If he obeys, then I’ll throw him into the eye of the sea but I will kill him if he is still unrepentant.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Gu Zun’s achievement is incredible but he’s still only a worm before you, Your Excellency. If you give the order, I’m sure there are three to five beings who will capture him for you.” The old man said.

Li Qiye gently sighed in response: “I know. Heaven Suppression is not only the effort from Lil Blackie, I put a lot of work into it as well. Gu Zun’s talents are supreme, unfortunately, he was born with the bones of a traitor. Blackie tried hard back then so I gave him a chance. Oh well, if he gives up, I’ll imprison him again. If not, then death.”

The old man remained quiet. Gu Zun might be considered an invincible character but the Dark Crow far exceeded him. Li Qiye didn’t even need to personally take action to destroy Gu Zun. This topic wasn’t worth discussing.

“Your sister made it out of her death meditation.” Li Qiye commented.

The old man nodded: “Yes, she’s still not stable for the time being. Just need some more time.”

“Then I won’t go see her so soon.” Li Qiye nodded: “It’s not easy for her either but she had been working all this time. You are different, when you reach the end of your path, it’ll turn you into loathful being.”

“It’s not good at all. Even the heavens do not want to take me out of disgust. I’ll have to keep living like this.” The old man smiled but his expression was gloomy.

“People in this world are bounded by love.” Li Qiye gently shook his head: “Qian Li has her own path and you your own. To tell the truth, I can’t judge you. You’ve made your own choice after all.” [1]

The old man sighed in response: “I can understand why the emperor didn’t like me. She can persevere on this path unlike me. Someone as amazing as her can go much further. [2]

“Your talents are countless times better than her. It’s not a problem of perseverance either, just your heart.” Li Qiye pointed at his heart and said :”In the beginning, you didn’t jump out of Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo’s grand dao and only fallen deeper within.”

He paused for a moment: “I’m not saying that his grand dao ruined you. With your talents, you could have jumped out of it but you chose otherwise. Because of this, Qian Li became emperor and you are here. I don’t know what to say, you’re just wasting your time and waiting for death right now.”

“Your Excellency, you tried to guide me back then.” the old man smiled and said: “But I’m too stupid to shine. I have let you down.”

“Like I said, everyone will have their own path and will.” Li Qiye disagreed: “As for shining, your achievements right now are great enough. Few could even reach your level right now but the world could have been your playground. Ultimately, you chose this small pub instead.”

“I don’t know what you are choosing.” Li Qiye said lightly.

“Choosing to wait for death then.” The old man calmly said without sadness.

“I can’t comment then. Keep walking with your choice.” Li Qiye had to smile back. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“You have always been like this, Your Excellency. It is a shame that I couldn’t help the Black Dragon King in that shattering battle.” The old man said with a tinge of emotion.

“I”m sure Lil Blackie didn’t care. The two of you embarked on two completely different paths so I can’t see you two together. He’s more domineering and aggressive. If he saw your lifeless and gloomy appearance now, he might have kicked you flying to the horizon.”

“You’re right, that’s why he never cared for me even when he visited the Yu Clan so he never went here. Sigh, I don’t want to see him either or I’ll just slow him down.”

“Forget it, it’ll just end with a fight given your personality and his.” Li Qiye laughed: “Of course, when the two of you were younger, you boys were two hot-headed kids, always helping each other.”

“You, Blackie, and Qian Li... Honestly, it was quite gratifying to see three amazing talents. Though you didn’t come from my tutelage, I was happy to hear people refer to your group as the ‘three heroes’”. Li Qiye sighed at this point.

“Yes, those were some memorable years.” The old man recalled: “I was a step ahead and couldn’t join your camp but I have never forgotten about your teaching. In my heart, you are still my master. Alas, I have let down your high expectations, failing to become an emperor like Qian Li and a tyrant for three generations like Blackie, just a nobody in the end.”

He still smiled without any regrets.

1. Due to the veiled nature of the Chinese language, certain words and phrases can be interpreted differently. The word for emotions here can be love, but in order to play it safe, I chose emotion. In fact, I lean towards love more since I’ve seen this line used for love in different novels but playing safe is always my style for ED. Also, Qian Li is revealed to be a girl here with the “her” pronoun. Some other translators might have a different interpretation of this particular line than me. Edit #2, after reading the next line, love is the right choice, not emotions.

2. Ah, now love makes more sense for the line above than emotions. I’ll leave these translation notes here for fun
