After successfully picking the lingzhi root, Three-eyed Prodigy got out of the lava while the same couldn’t be said about his two foes.

It became clear that his prior hesitation outside the spring was to figure out the path. After all, his golden eye gave him an advantage unavailable to others. It allowed him to see through illusions and on top of deriving mysteries.

“Clank!” A sword slash immediately greeted him outside.

“I’ve been waiting a while for you.” Semi-sword God stopped the battle with Spiritheart Emperor and decided to face the prodigy instead.

It turned out that he wasn’t in a rush to defeat the emperor and was waiting for this moment. There was no point in moving to the lava spring versus waiting for his prey outside.

He knew that the prodigy’s golden eye was special. On the other hand, he himself would have a hard time traversing through that lava spring and might be trapped there. Plus, the guy waited for so long thus he might have been able to understand the mysteries here.

“The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.” A spectator murmured.

Meanwhile, Shen Guzhan and Flying Sword Marvel were still stuck in the lava spring and fighting against the fire dragon.

Semi-sword God was clearly one step above them in terms of strategy.

“Hand over the lingzhi and I will spare you.” He threatened; his eyes fixated on the prodigy.

“Semi-sword God, you think you can kill me? Don’t overestimate yourself.” The prodigy sneered in response.

“I’m more than enough to kill you.” Semi-sword’s eyes flashed chillingly with murderous intent. He would kill the prodigy even if the guy were to hand the root over just to avoid any future complication.

“Okay, I will remember this. As long as I stay alive, I will eventually destroy your Metalkin Divine Court. Only one of us will exist.” The prodigy laughed and aggressively declared.

The experts by the lake gasped after hearing this bold claim then exchanged glances with each other.

No one felt that he was spouting bullshit. Right now, he was certainly weaker than Semi-sword God and Metalkin War God. However, he was definitely the youngest and most talented genius in Immortal Lineage. One day, he might surpass all of them.

Moreover, God Eye wasn’t a minor system. One day when the prodigy was strong enough, he could actually put up a good fight against the Metalkin Divine Court.

“You deserve death for your insolence!” The sword god’s murderous intent soared after hearing this.

He also knew that this prodigy would definitely surpass him in the future, necessitating a swift kill right now.

“Clank!” He instantly attacked with a slash fixating on the prodigy. It was as if the entire world was within his grasp.

The prodigy became suppressed and the area caved around him, wanting to turn him into a pulp.

“Now!” The prodigy and Spiritheart glanced at each other and shouted.

“Clank!” Spiritheart spread her wings and shot out all of her golden feathers like an unrelenting storm of needles.

Strangely enough, it felt as if she shot at the wrong target since the feathers were flying towards the prodigy, not the sword god.

“What’s going on?” The spectators became startled due to the unexpected developments. Was she trying to kill him?

“Activate!” The prodigy didn’t dodge the incoming feathers. His golden eye opened and exuded boundless radiance.

“Boom!” The coming of the feathers and the golden radiance resulted in a deafening detonation. A maelstrom took form along with continuous blasts. The world quaked with its rotation, seemingly being sucked inside.

“You’re going down!” The sword god roared and unleashed his fiercest slash, showing zero mercy!

Alas, the golden feathers instantly surrounded the duo and formed a tight cocoon. The maelstrom then sucked them inside. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Boom!” The slash still made contact with the maelstrom, successfully crushing it. However, the duo was nowhere to be seen.

“Hmph.” The sword god scowled after seeing this.

They could see that the two have left behind a backup plan in order to escape. They were certainly the weakest among the three sides yet still managed to leave with the lingzhi.

“Well done.” The bull laughed and praised: “The brat is talented and has some brains, maybe he’ll accomplish something in the future.”

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t comment. However, his expression clearly showed his satisfaction towards the prodigy’s fine display.

“So they had a good plan going in.” Many ancestors felt the same way. The prodigy wasn’t a brute that only relied on his cultivation.

“Haha, didn’t I say before? A perfect pair made in heaven.” The bull raised its voice again so that everyone could hear it.

Many glanced over at the prime minister, aware of the blatant provocation.

Nonetheless, they agreed that the prodigy and the emperor were a good match. They showed impeccable teamwork as well.

In fact, if it wasn’t for the engagement, they felt that these two should just get together. Their sects were similarly prestigious and he was strong and talented enough to be her dao companion.

Plus, no one has seen Spiritheart together with Metalkin War God before. The only thing between them seemed to be a marriage pact between two systems.

The prime minister’s expression soured once more.

“Pop!” Three-eyed Prodigy and Spiritheart Emperor finally got out of the lake and landed onshore.

The prodigy took out his treasure box and was met with a chilling aura.

“Iceflame Lingzhi.” Someone shouted after seeing the root in his hand.

“Miss Spiritheart, it’s yours.” The prodigy smiled and held it in front of her.

“I do not dare to take it all for myself since you have contributed as well. We get one-half each.” She shook her head.

“This lingzhi is of the cold affinity so it’s more suitable for you. You can just take my half.” He hurriedly said.

“I don’t think that’s fair...” She shook her head again.

“What the hell are you two going on about? I will decide for you. This immortal lingzhi is the brat’s promise token to you. If your seniors don’t agree, I will personally go there and beat them until they agree.” The bull instantly shouted after seeing their hesitation.

Many instantly clamored after hearing this and started looking over.

Spiritheart turned red because of the attention. She was still an innocent maiden despite being a powerful emperor.
