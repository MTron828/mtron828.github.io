Chapter 5519: Unfathomable

“The appointing ceremony for the next valley lord commences. Whoever is approved by the immortal artifact shall become our leader.” Sunset Glow Matron said before gently touching the two candidates’ head to express good wishes.

“Begin.” She said after finishing the blessing.

Qin Baifeng and the goddess bowed deeply before entering the valley. The entrance served as a portal to a different dimension.

Li Qiye was nearby and gazed into the portal, capable of seeing the immortal artifact itself.

“Buzz.” The immortal light seemed to be reacting to their presence and became brighter like a lit lamp. It flowed out of the narrow valley in a continuous fashion.

“The artifact is activated.” This was the first time many members saw the immortal light.

They spread to the sides in order to make room but the light stopped at the entrance. What they saw within the radiance varied.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Some saw their own grand dao evolving to the next level - a teaching process. Others saw a version of Sunset Glow Scripture. One page flipped after another, imprinting its mysteries into their mind.

Another saw an immortal preaching the dao. The speech was accompanied by heavenly flowers and hymns.

Everyone became immersed in this exceedingly beneficial phenomenon. Just observing attentively would result in cultivational improvement.

“Seal the six senses, protect your mind.” Sunset Glow Matron shouted and woke them up from this trance.

They woke up and regained their sanity, glancing at each other while breaking out in sweat. They didn’t understand that this power was beyond their reach. Some started moving toward the light and that would result in mental imprisonment, unable to wake up again.

Qin Baifeng and the goddess have protected their mind from this temptation. They took a deep breath and actually walked into the narrow valley.

“Boom!” They didn’t hold back and activated their power. Their auras erupted and amazed other members of Sunset Glow who felt as if they were being hit by a tsunami.

Fortunately, the matron also roared and stopped the waves of energy from sending cultivators and mortals flying.

As they walked into the valley, they exuded different a visual phenomenon.

The goddess was engulfed in auspicious energy, painting an ancient and majestic scene of the setting sun. Every step of hers was resplendent.

Qin Baifeng, on the other hand, revealed a sword dao akin to a peacock spreading its tail. Colorful sharp rays temporarily blinded the audience as they gathered toward the same focal point - Baifeng. This made it seem as if she was a phoenix being revered by all other birds.

Both displayed their cultivation and dao - only second to the matron in Sunset Glow Valley.

They utilized their power in order to enter the stream of light safely, wanting to prove themselves to the immortal artifact deeper into the valley.

Spectators watched with bated breath. If these two couldn’t do it, none of them could.

“They can do it, definitely. At least one will make it.” Many clenched their fists and supported the duo.

“Boom!” It didn’t take long before a majestic force propelled one of them out of the light.

“Bam!” The person fell to the ground afterward.

“Senior Sister Qin!” The crowd shouted.

“Boom!” The goddess was repelled as well and also landed on the ground, only making it one step farther than Qin Baifeng.

They stood up and smiled wryly while gazing at the narrow valley. They tried their best but couldn’t reach the end of the valley, let alone be recognized by the immortal artifact.

“We have failed.” The goddess didn’t seem disheartened by the outcome and acknowledged their failure.
