Chapter 4956: Utterly Shameless

The unfortunate students were covered in dirt after rolling down the mountain.

“Hahaha, nice job getting down!” Princess Ming Shi clapped and jeered at them.

They didn’t understand at all because the three treasures suddenly activated the moment they tried to make contact. In other words, Li Qiye’s curse seemed effective.

“Did he really do it?” Spectators started thinking that this was one too many coincidences.

They have never heard of anyone being capable of doing this before.

“Yeah, he’s the harbinger of bad luck. Whatever ominous thing he says will come true.” One student asserted.

“Really?” Others shuddered after hearing this and kept a distance from Li Qiye.

“Wouldn’t that be something? Then he can curse anyone to death.” Both members of The People and The Race were afraid of Li Qiye.

At this point, they preferred to believe in this ability than otherwise - better safe than sorry.

“You lost again.” Ming Shi waved at them and said: “Come, apologize to our young noble already. He might be merciful and spare your lives.”

Though it sounded as if she was taunting them, she was actually giving them a chance. After all, the bet dictated that Li Qiye could do whatever he wanted. This included killing them.

“We haven’t lost yet.” Swordgrasp immediately said.

“How so? Your luck has been stolen already. Hmph, still not convinced?” Ming Shi spoke in Li Qiye’s stead.

“We’ve only tried three treasures, there are still numerous left on the mountain. We can’t lose until we’ve tried and failed them all, that’s when it’ll be clear if our luck is still there or not.” Swordgrasp said cleverly.

Ming Shi had no response since this made sense. Students thought that Swordgrasp was playing dirty. Nonetheless, they couldn’t refute his logic.

“Yes, they have to try all the treasures first.” Someone from The Race supported the trio.

“How long is it going to take for them to try all the treasures on the divine mountain? The ceremony will be over way before then. This is impossible to complete, it’s cheating.” A student from The People snorted.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“This is only the beginning, we haven’t lost yet.” The young monarch said, agreeing with Swordgrasp.

“You just don’t know when to give up.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Let us try all the treasures first.” Halo said since this was their only way out.

“This is an unprecedented level of shamelessness.” Ming Shi said with disdain.

However, their argument was interrupted by the appearance of another student who tried to sneak up the mountain.

Alas, he was still spotted by a fellow student.

“Brother Bai, what are you doing here?” The student asked without thinking.

He couldn’t help but smile wryly; his plan was a failure.

“Bai Shaojin!” The young monarch’s group glared at him.

Everyone knew about Benevolence at this point. Some had tried to find Shaojin after the battle but couldn’t so they assumed that he had escaped.

“Bai Shaojin!” The trio of geniuses traveled up the mountain again.

“Don’t even think about it! I’m giving Benevolence to the academy!” Shaojin shouted at them.

This revelation stunned everyone. The value of Benevolence was made clear as Deity took the risk of offending the academy in order to retrieve it.

Now, Bai Shaojin wanted to gift it away? This was akin to the princess giving up the lantern.

“Benevolence belongs to Deity, hand it over lest you want to die.” Swordgrasp uttered coldly and took one step forward. His sword energy enveloped Bai Shaojin.

“Brother Bai, don’t make this hard on yourself, there will be no place for you to stay in the lower continents by doing this.” Halo leaped and landed in Shaojin’s path. His halo pulsed outward in order to block him.

“Don’t think you can bully him. We have his back.” Ming Shi joined the show.

“Indeed. This matter is dealt with, Benevolence does not belong to Deity. If anything it belongs to The People or whoever is connected with it by fate.” Jian Yunyun said. Goldcrest naturally had her back as well.

“That’s right, there is no logic in repeating that nonsense about Deity’s claim.” Students from The People supported Shaojin.

“I can’t believe we’re having this conversation again. If Benevolence is gifted to the academy it will belong to the academy.” Another shouted.

“Hmph!” The young monarch scowled and released his dragon lord aura aggressively.

Many were sent flying while vomiting blood, unable to handle his sacred aura.

“Number means nothing here.” The young monarch glared at the crowd, aware that he was the strongest.

Li Qiye waved at Shaojin and the latter hurriedly ran over, hiding behind Li Qiye.

“Alright, will you three end yourselves or do I have to?” Li Qiye smiled at the trio.

This astounded students who didn’t think that he would be so bold.

“You?” The young monarch’s eyes flashed with murderous intent.

“You did lose the bet earlier, now it is time to pay up.” Ming Shi wasn’t afraid of him.
