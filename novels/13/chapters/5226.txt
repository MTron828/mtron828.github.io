Chapter 5227: A Stone

“May I ask if you know about the matters above, Dao Lord?” Jue Xian’er asked.

“Pertaining which matter, Fellow Daoist?” Omniscient responded.

Meanwhile, everyone else listened attentively because Jue Xian’er was one of the coldest conquerors.

This had nothing to do with cultivation and personality. It felt as if coldness was part of her nature. Nothing in the world could warm her up and get close to her.

She had no friends, companions, or acquaintances. Her solitary nature chased others away from the start. Thus, her initiative took everyone by surprise.

“I will ask another day.” She said.

“That’s fine.” Omniscient nodded.

Some became disappointed after hearing this. They wondered what she was talking about - the matters above?

“Boom!” Another participant arrived and left a seal in the air. Suddenly, it was smashed by something and a figure rushed out to sit on the throne of Imperial Alliance.

It was round like an egg or a rock while being covered in fog. It seemed to be immensely heavy; the throne itself had a hard time withstanding it.

People wondered if it were to fall on Imperial Attendant, would the city be able to survive? The same for their own body.

“Brother Celestial Stone.” Skysword Dao Lord cupped his fist.

“Crack!” The stone cracked apart, revealing a pair of eyes. They were beautiful like a pair of jades.

However, staring at them for a long time would fully mesmerize someone, dragging them down into oblivion.

Thus, spectators trembled in fear and immediately looked away. Even dragon lords and conquerors focused up to protect their dao heart.

The stone seemed to be doing something akin to a nod toward the dao lord before closing its eyes again, not caring about anyone else including Suppression Conqueror.

“This is Celestial Stone Dao Lord?” Everyone was surprised to see such a unique cultivator.

There was no doubt that one slam from him could kill a dragon lord, not to mention his enveloping gaze.

Celestial Stone hailed from Eight Desolaces. Rumor has it that he was a member of the main branch of Stone Monarch, always proud and arrogant of his pureblood. Later on, he became a dao lord and started Divine Stone Ridge.

After ascending to the six continents, he joined Imperial Alliance and rarely showed himself in public. Some said that he spent his time being buried deep underground, no different from a non-sentient stone.

Thus, his appearance here today was rather surprising.

“What is Imperial Alliance aiming for? Which of the three treasures?” Someone commented.

“Amitabha.” A Buddhist beam from Pure Land crossed through the air and formed a great Buddha. Flowers descended and hymns echoed. Golden springs gushed upward in a magnificent manner.

The power of the Buddhist affinity engulfed the region, wanting to grant salvation to all.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Weaker cultivators started bowing in that direction. However, their seniors and ancient ancestors shouted: “Guard your mind!”

This woke them up and left them drenched in cold sweat. Just the image of the Buddha alone made them want to convert to Buddhism. This phenomenon was most likely intensified in Pure Land.

“How terrifying.” Someone said. Its actual power was unfathomable enough, not to mention this dreadful conversion affinity.

When the Buddha disappeared, a monk was now sitting on the throne chosen by Pure Land. His kasaya had a golden glow, and so did each inch of his flesh. It was as if he was made of gold, possessing an indestructible body.

A Buddhist halo rotated around him, always releasing and deriving the Buddhist dao.

“Pure Land Sacred Monk.” They didn’t expect to see this cultivator here in person.

He was well-respected despite not belonging to any top cultivation classification. He spent his life granting salvation to the suffering, focusing on mortals instead of cultivators.

Others didn’t want to waste time in the mortal world. Thus, his selflessness earned him well-deserved admiration. Today, he appeared for a different purpose altogether.

Pure Land had stronger cultivators so he didn’t need to participate in this event himself. Thus, his appearance was worthy of rumination.

“He must be here for Heaven Reckon.” Someone speculated.

“I agree.” Those who had relative knowledge of Pure Land had no problem with this comment.
