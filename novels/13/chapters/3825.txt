Chapter 3826: Leaving

Li Qiye returned to the temple and told the old servant and Fan Bai: “We’ve been here long enough, time to move.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Where do you wish to go, Young Master?” Fan Bai became curious.

“Black Wood Cliff.” He replied.

“Is your destination Black Tides, Young Master?” The old servant’s eyes slightly shifted after hearing this.

Fan Bai had no reaction due to her little knowledge. This wasn’t the case for the old servant who had traveled the world. He knew that there was nothing for Li Qiye to do at Black Wood Cliff. The only thing interesting there was Black Tides.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye responded.

The old man took a deep breath. While Li Qiye didn’t make a big deal out of it, those in the know would find this a serious matter.

Black Tides was one of the seven forbidden zones. All were extremely dangerous, hence their classification.

Not to mention ordinary cultivators, even the powerful supremes would be wary when talking about these places, let alone actually going there. Only Li Qiye could make this decision without thinking twice.

“The tides are receding.” The old servant murmured.

“You’ve heard about it?” Li Qiye glanced at him.

“It’s not like I don’t care about external events. The girl from Black Wood told Vajra about the phenomena already.” The old servant responded.

“Yes, it is receding.” Li Qiye nodded but this didn’t matter to him. He would take a trip there either way.

The old servant became worried after the confirmation. Though this happened numerous times in history, they were not prepared for it this generation.

The previous time happened during Eight Stallion Dao Lord’s era, the most recent one. A new dao lord has yet to appear. [1]

It hasn’t even been a full era since so no one believed Wei Qianqing. Normally, it would be a dozen eras or so.

Thus, the seniors of Vajra had a historical justification for doubting her report. This was the same for the old servant as well.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye had spoken and his words were absolute. The old servant thought that this was an ominous sign.

“Looks like you still care about the southern West King.” Li Qiye chuckled while looking at the old servant’s worried expression.

“I’m just a regular man who can’t forget about the place where I was born, unable to escape the constraints of the five elements and emotions.” The old servant smiled wryly.

“True, everyone feels the same way.” Li Qiye chuckled and agreed.

The old servant sighed. Things were looking bad for the south. In fact, the holy ground might be facing an existential crisis.

Previously, Buddha Supreme risked his life to protect Black Wood and still failed. Fortunately, Righteous Supreme and Eight Stallion Dao Lord came in the nick of time.

The consequence would have been unimaginable if these two didn’t come. The holy ground would be the first to go down.

In the present, Buddha Supreme was nowhere to be found. Righteous Supreme would have a hard time coming out. As for the dao lord? He hasn’t been around for a long time now.

The stake was just as high this time. Black Wood needed defenders capable of holding back Black Tides.

He glanced at Li Qiye. Who else could it be but Li Qiye?

“Young Master, are you intending on going straight in?” He asked.

“Not necessarily, I’m not a savior who cares about the wellbeing of others.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“But you still wish to go there.” He said.

Few in the world knew what awaited in the depths of Black Tides, only that intruders seldomly returned alive.

Nonetheless, he believed that Li Qiye could absolutely do so. But why did Li Qiye want to go there?

“Just going there to finish a trivial matter.” Li Qiye glanced at the horizon and said.

The old man thought that only Li Qiye would be able to say this in a nonchalant manner. Even dao lords didn’t dare to do so.

“That place is so bizarre.” He recalled.

“You’ve been there before?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Not quite, making that claim would be an exaggeration.” He became sentimental: “I was arrogant back then despite achieving nothing. I thought I was invincible and couldn’t help wanting to enter.”

He paused for a moment and memories resurfaced. He swept through Eight Desolaces with his saber, completely dominating his peers.

Because of this, he felt confident enough to enter Black Tides. He eventually found that it was endless and perilous. Fortunately, he knew when to quit and managed to stay alive.

“It’s immensely vast. I was like a headless fly going everywhere. I didn’t know how far I got at all.” He said.

“It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Just the fact that you left that place alive is incredible enough.” Li Qiye replied.

“You’re too kind.” He forced a smile.

Anyone entering that place would find themselves insignificant, akin to a drop of water in an ocean. Most would be lost right after.

To reach the deepest area was exceedingly difficult. Only mighty dao lords could do so. Of course, there was no guarantee of leaving it alive.

“So what is that thing?” He asked a question that has been on his mind for a long time.

“What did you see?” Li Qiye replied.

“Is it a ghost?” He boldly speculated.

Of course, “ghost” for cultivators was different from “ghost” in the mind of mortals. The ghosts described by mortals were nothing more than remnant intents with grudges.

“That depends on your definition.” Li Qiye smirked and said: “Most would consider them ghosts. As for me, I disagree and believe that they are things that shouldn’t exist.”

“I see.” He fell into rumination.

In the past, he got far enough to see unprecedented things that left an indelible impression on him.

“Go get ready.” Li Qiye commanded, then returned to his room.
