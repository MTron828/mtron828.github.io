Chapter 4440: Ravaged Land’s Secret

Ravaged Land was still shrouded by fog just like before. Heavenly gazes weren’t enough to see the bottom.

It encompassed more than half of the City of Demons. In history, both members of Dragon and outsiders have come to take a look.

It was open to all. However, Dragon gave no guarantee about visitors’ safety.

Nonetheless, travelers still came because mysteries bred curiosity. They wanted to see the potential secrets and treasures hidden there.

Unfortunately, the majority found nothing. That was still better than those who seemingly evaporated from the world after entering.

The latter group made the danger looming in there obvious. One wrong move would result in death without a grave.

Li Qiye stood on top and looked down at the mysterious land. Only Nine-tailed God accompanied him this time.

“Countless adventurers had entered.” Nine-tailed God commented.

“You too?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Several times already.” The demon responded: “And I gained nothing. This world keeps on changing, it’s impossible to predict.”

The great demon was curious about this land both during his youth and after becoming a mighty ancestor. After all, he naturally wanted to learn more about his own territory. Failing to do so was one of his biggest regrets.

“Well, at least you made it out alive. That’s fortunate enough.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I noted when things got bad and left without taking any further risk. This is the right way for someone as weak as me. Even dao lords could understand this place, I’m no better.” The demon admitted.

Others of a similar level might have refrained from disparaging themselves. There was no point in revealing this sensitive information.

“Your way of thinking is a sign of wisdom.” Li Qiye said: “Yes, dao lords can’t find anything either.”

“Many have entered, our forefathers early on. Even Sword Queen and Hallowed Dao Lord later.” The demon said.

Space Dragon Emperor picked this area for a reason. Moreover, he was successful in obtaining something from Ravaged Land. However, the other dao lords from Dragon didn’t gain anything from it.

Top cultivators came afterward - Sword Queen, Hallowed, Nine-wheel Dao Lord… They also failed.

This was the reason why Nine-tailed God didn’t find his failure unacceptable. He was just a junior in the grand scheme of things, no match for the peerless dao lords in the past.

“Are you entering, Sir?” Nine-tailed God asked despite already knowing the answer since they were standing here.

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded while staring at the place. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Sir, could you bring me along?” He smiled awkwardly while rubbing his palms. For some reason, he had absolute confidence in Li Qiye and didn’t want to miss this opportunity.

He believed that Li Qiye could do what the dao lords couldn’t. His intuition told him so.

Li Qiye didn’t answer. After a while, the demon coughed and said: “I apologize for asking something so serious.”

“It’s fine, you might not be able to find what you’re looking for in there, but at least you’ll visit a place your progenitor has been to before.” Li Qiye agreed.

“Thank you, thank you.” The demon bowed excitedly. This was one of the rare things in this world that could still excite him.

Li Qiye accepted the gesture and calmly observed the land. A long time later, he sighed and said: “Why did they have to go so far, fighting to the death?”

“Right, Feng Qi and Jiu Bian.” The demon understood.

The legend stated that both Feng Qi and Jiu Bian died after their battle. Of course, this was unverifiable because none had fully exploded Ravaged Land.

However, Li Qiye had just verified this and the demon believed him.

“Sir, I have a question, but I’m not sure if I should ask or not.” The demon eventually asked after a brief silence.

“Speak.” Li Qiye replied.

“Sir, are you trying to revive Feng Qi and Jiu Bian?” The demon said softly and became nervous while staring at Li Qiye.

Li Qiye entered the two secret dimensions first and now, Ravaged Land. This made him have a bold thought due to Li Qiye’s sorcery.

“A true rebirth is virtually impossible, especially when we’re talking about the strictest definition. It is creating life, something only available to the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“So it is not possible?” The demon replied. A being of his power had access to higher-level secrets and legends.

“When a life is truly dead, rebirth is impossible.” Li Qiye smiled: “But when one is strong enough and wants to revive someone, then…”

Li Qiye paused and his eyes became exceedingly profound.

“Then…?” The demon became anxious. He felt that he was about to see another door of the dao.

“Reviled by the heaven and hated by the ghosts.” Li Qiye answered. [1]

“Reviled by the heaven and hated by the ghosts?” The demon murmured.
