As Li Qiye left the land of the fire source on his way to Longevity Valley, he met a female daoist.

She was rather beautiful, around the age of thirty. She wore a loose robe fluttering with the wind but this didn’t deter others from seeing her wondrous curves. The winds pushed back and forth and they began to show - the shy, rolling hills. This hidden jewel made others want to carefully appreciate it even more. One could see her a hundred times without becoming bored.

She certainly looked heroic and had the graceful temperament of a daoist. Her complexion was as bright as the moon and eyes as dazzling like the stars and willowy eyebrows. One wouldn’t be shocked seeing her for the first time, but her beauty required time and patience. Each time seeing her again, people would find something new.

The daoist placed her palms together after seeing him and greeted: “Blessed be the supreme. Nice to meet you.”

Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile, also placing his palms together: “Oh Merciful Buddha, it is excellent to meet you.” [1]

A third party would definitely think that Li Qiye was messing around. Buddhism and Daoism were at odds and he was certainly not a Buddhist disciple yet he still performed their rite. What could it be outside of deliberate teasing?

However, the woman didn’t mind at all. She smiled in a natural manner: “Benefactor, fate connects the two of us.”

Her smile was like the return of spring, capable of melting the heart.

He smiled back: “Daoist, indeed we are, why don’t we make something of this?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Go on.” The woman had an amicable flow to her.

“How about a wife? Will you be my dao companion?” He placed his palms together and asked.

The sudden request would make others think that he was insane. This woman had an incredible identity and a prestigious status right now. Talking to her like this meant being tired of living.

“You’re quite straightforward, Benefactor.” She wasn’t angry at all.

“That’s who I am.” Li Qiye smiled: “If we are connected by fate, then as the adage goes, we’ll meet wherever we go. If that’s the case, then let’s not be sticklers to formalities. Come with me, I’m in need of a wife.”

“Then why must I go with you and not the other way around? Since you claim to not like adhering to conventional ways, follow me back to Longevity Valley.” Her autumn eyes were gentle. Just a wink was charming beyond words.

He smiled while rubbing his chin and taking a good look at the daoist. She nonchalantly met his gaze, her own full of elegance and insight.

“That’s not a bad idea.” He concluded: “What’s in it for me? Does your valley have many beauties?”

“As many as there are clouds in the sky. The moment you are there, you’ll be the moon surrounded by the star, it’ll be an amazing time.” She had a good sense of humor.

An outside listener would be astounded again because her attitude and tone right now weren’t matching her actual status, more like a madam of a brothel finding customers.

“My heart is beating fast now, looks like we’re connected by fate indeed...” Li Qiye placed his palms together again: “Similar people do walk on the same path.”

The daoist returned the gesture: “My title is Longevity Sage, our fate is proven by our meeting despite the sea of people.”

This was an awe-inspiring title - the lord of Longevity Valley, the ruler of Longevity System, one of the two great daoist sages in Myriad Lineage.

The emperor of Insane Court was no match in comparison because it had fallen. She was famous alongside the other sage, the sect master of Yang Radiance with the title of Untethered. Her cultivation was unfathomable.

She was well-respected and the valley continued to grow under her leadership. Right now, Li Qiye was teasing someone of this level; he truly possessed the gall of a tiger.

Nevertheless, she remained in a good mood and continued to humor him. Not everyone could do this, not after obtaining a high status.

Li Qiye continued on: “Let me add on to this fateful connection. I was actually planning on joining your valley in the first place, not expecting to meet you here, sage. Looks like our meeting was destined, will you fulfill it by walking with me, hand-in-hand?”

“Perhaps, if it is meant to be.” She dodged the request without being impolite. One could stare at her beautiful smile for an eternity.

She continued on: “Wait until I understand the world, then I’ll think about accompanying you.”

“Then you’re not going to the valley with me? What business is worthy of your attention?” He asked.

“Mundane matters for the sake of benefits and fame, truly vexing.” She replied: “A spectator watches the mundane world from afar while an impatient person is pressed with urgency and desires. This applies to me so I must go take a look.”

“Do you want me to come along? I am a good cheerleader and will be more than happy to accompany someone who is connected with me through fate.” He joked.

“Benefactor, your desires are not mundane matters, what you spectate is the light above us all. Trivial matters are not your concern, I shall go alone.” She smiled and said.

“Very well, but if you need me, just say the word. I will bear the world with you.” He half-jokingly said.

“I appreciate your kind thoughts.” She continued: “You should go rest at Longevity Valley first and meet the disciples there. I’ll return later to discuss the dao with you. Is that alright?”

He looked at her and asked: “What role will you give me to enter? Maybe as your dao companion?’

She chuckled in response: “A bit early for that, Benefactor. We have a spot open for a chief disciple, are you interested? Of course, you can go there first and see for yourself before making a decision.”

Anyone else would be slack-jawed after hearing this. The chief disciple role of Longevity Valley was certainly prestigious, similar to a successor. This person would eventually become the ruler of the valley one day.

Such a role should be reserved for their own disciple after intense deliberation. But now, she was giving this role to an outsider?

She seemed to be quite at ease as if this position wasn’t important at all, like she was recruiting a regular disciple.

“Chief disciple?” He mused and said: “A romance between master and disciple, quite exciting indeed. I’m itching to experience it.”

“Then you agree, Benefactor?” She smiled.

“How could I say no? The world is fleeting and ephemeral, so I need to make the most of it. I’ll be your chief disciple and take a look at the beautiful sceneries of your valley.”

She wrote a letter before handing it over to Li Qiye: “Take this to the valley and someone will receive you. Wait until I come back and we can talk about anything.”

He smiled: “Good, it sounds like you have no problem with me womanizing over there.”

“If you are capable, go for it.” She smiled.

Li Qiye smiled back; his eyes suddenly became resplendent and gazed frighteningly straight at her: “Is immortality possible?”

1. There’s no direct English translation for these two expressions, as far as I know. She is using the daoist version (miao zai) while Li Qiye is using the Buddhist version (shan zai). Although, I haven’t seen the daoist version that often while the buddhist one is everywhere
