Chapter 3792: Trivial

After the scion backed off, Li Qiye stretched and lazily told the trio: “Okay, all together or one at a time?”

All eyes were on the trio. Everyone thought that the three would naturally work together.

In a one-on-one scenario, the first to lose would be the third prince. This was rather unanimous among the crowd.

The three thought about it for a bit. The third prince naturally wanted to fight together with Hu Ben and Phantom. That would give them the highest probability of winning. Going alone against Li Qiye was akin to asking for defeat.

“Since you’re asking, you must be afraid of us teaming up. “ The third prince initiated a psychological taunt. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He was worried that Phantom and Hu Ben would care too much about face and agree to a one-on-one battle. That’s something he absolutely didn’t want to see.

“Obviously.” Li Qiye lazily responded: “As if the three of you together are a threat.”

Phantom and Hu Ben initially wanted to say some polite and humble lines first to make everyone look good. Alas, Li Qiye’s comment infuriated them. Such contempt was truly insulting for famous geniuses like them.

“We’ll obey if that is your wish.” Phantom coldly uttered.

Hu Ben scowled and said: “Your mysterious means are known by all so let’s see them today, we’ll see if you’re as magical as the rumors.”

“That’s no problem.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said: “I’m sure it hasn’t been easy for you all to get this far so I will allow a little bit of actual struggling. Otherwise, you’ll die without being able to close your eyes and will become resentful ghosts.”

The trio turned red and breathed heavily with rage. They could no longer maintain their elegant appearance, only wanting to use violence against Li Qiye and stomp his face into a pulp.

“So arrogant!” The crowd clamored again, whether it be the young or old. Both thought that Li Qiye was being outrageous.

Of course, a few experts didn’t find this surprising. They shook their head and murmured: “That’s Li Qiye, if he wasn’t like this, he wouldn’t be Li Qiye.”

The majority thought that Li Qiye would be able to kill the trio with just one move. That’s impossible.

The third prince took it better than the other two because of his internal lack of confidence. But Phantom and Hu Ben had a twisted expression due to the humiliation entailed.

“I see, I can’t wait to see how amazing you are then.” Hu Ben shouted sarcastically.

Phantom had purple lightning in his eyes as he said menacingly: “Don’t blame us for being merciless since you’re courting death. Today will be your last.”

“That’s right, this will be a battle till death. Don’t think about leaving this place alive.” The third prince took this opportunity to assert this again, fully pulling his allies into the fray.

“Bold words but I’m afraid they’ll be your last.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

Phantom and Hu Ben scowled thunderously and displayed their power to the horror of the crowd.

The trio no longer wasted time and began to position themselves around Li Qiye. As they gradually moved forward, the crowd watched with bated breath.

Meanwhile, the scion watched with great interest. He had heard plenty of things about Li Qiye and didn’t dare to underestimate him.

The problem was the cultivation gap. What shocking method would Li Qiye use to take down these foes?

The scion then came up with thousands and thousands of ways in his head in a matter of seconds. He put himself in Li Qiye’s shoes and knew that he wouldn’t be able to win regardless of his wondrous techniques and invincible treasures.

Even in the virtually impossible outcome of victory, it would be an arduous one with heavy prices. That’s why he was very curious about Li Qiye’s claim.

On the other hand, Xu Cuimei had a natural expression and wasn’t that invested in the battle as if the outcome was obvious.

The trio formed a horn formation, ready to support each other while surrounding the enemy.

Though they haven’t fought together previously, they were still top geniuses who could act with excellent teamwork.

Li Qiye still had a relaxed expression, unlike the trio’s solemn appearance. He smiled and said: “Okay, time to use your best treasures and techniques. It’ll be your last chance.”

Eyes widened after listening to him. Rumor has it that Phantom Sacred Child has managed to invite an invincible weapon from Myriad-blood Sect. The crowd certainly wanted to take a look.

“Good!” The third prince was the first to react. He was the weakest so there was no way he would hold back from the start. Otherwise, he could be slowing down his allies.

“Boom!” His vitality erupted and soared to the sky like the celestials, extending for a long distance.

“Myriad-form Sanctity, just barely though. One step in.” One big shot commented.

The others nodded. The prince wasn’t the best among the young generation but he still stood out.
