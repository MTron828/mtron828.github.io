Chapter 245: Our Heroic Blood is not Cold and Our Magnificent Aspiration Reaches the Clouds

Witnessing the entrapment of the ten thousand cavalrymen where even a drop of water could not drip through, the atmosphere of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was extremely tense. All the disciples went back to their stations as the sect used a huge amount of refined jade without a care to open all their defensive formations.

The battle was drawing close and Gu Tieshou’s expression had turned cold; however, his was not the only one.

Many sect and gate masters observing from afar were quite emotional. In these last ten thousand years, the Heavenly God Sect and the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom rarely mobilized like this against the other powers in their kingdom.

Today, the Heavenly God Sect was determined to destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and this greatly alarmed many heritages inside the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. If they dared to destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect today, then tomorrow, it could be another heritage’s turn.

“These are all the elites of the Heavenly God Sect!” A few people were in dismay as they looked at the ten thousand cavalrymen and their tight blockade.

Even the sects that were not situated inside the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom were alarmed. A sect lord murmured: “Even though the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect lost the battle thirty thousand years ago, the Heavenly God Sect also suffered great losses so they rarely underwent grand scale invasions like this. I’m afraid that this has been in the works for a long time, it’s not just a sudden whim.”

At this moment, everyone became aware that surrendering Li Qiye over was just an excuse. Destroying the Ancient Sect was something that the Heavenly God Sect must do.

“The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is at a disadvantage. No, to be exact, the Nine Saint Demon Gate is at a disadvantage. I heard that it has lost the support from the War God Temple and even their Demon King Lun Ri is being suppressed at the War God Temple.” A saint lord knew a bit of information and gently lamented: “This is a one in a thousand chance for the Heavenly God Sect. Without the support of the Nine Saint Demon Gate and the backing of the War God Temple while they have the backing of the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, this is their best opportunity to destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Not only this, this might also be their best chance to annihilate the Nine Saint Demon Gate as well.”

“Heh, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect sought its own death by having a disciple like Li Qiye. Hmph, making enemies everywhere; it would be a miracle for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to not be destroyed!” Some people who had grievances with Li Qiye were having quite a good time since the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was not able to escape from its impending doom.

At this moment, the ten thousand cavalrymen surrounded the sect, but Li Qiye remained calm. He glanced at the cavalrymen and was still as leisure as before while commenting: “Not bad. It seems like revenge for Dao Child Shengtian is only an excuse. I am a bit sad for the group of Dao Child Shengtian. They are being taken advantage of even after their deaths.”

“Hand over all of your Virtuous Paragon and Emperor Laws, then I might withdraw my troops!” At this time, the Heavenly Jewel Mortal King coldly exclaimed. He revealed his fangs and his true intentions.

The Heavenly Jewel Mortal King’s words sent chills to all the spectators. As for the Cleansing Incense disciples, they glanced at each other and exclaimed with outrage: “Even if we are killed to the very last one, we will not let them get what they want!”

Emperor Laws! Virtuous Paragon Laws! These were the things craved by everyone. Even though the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had declined, in the end, it was still an Immortal Emperor lineage! It had lost the majority of its powerful laws after the battle that year, but it still had powerful ones, such as the Kun Peng’s Six Variants!

“Daylight Sky Immortal Secret! The Heaven’s Will Secret Law!” Someone murmured. At this time, many great characters felt a burning heat rising in their hearts and even some temptation. Li Qiye had performed a Heaven’s Will Secret Law at the burial ground. If the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was to be destroyed at this moment, it would be a good time to take advantage of the situation to obtain this law.

“Heavenly Jewel Mortal King, even if we are killed to the very last man, we will absolutely never hand the Emperor Laws over!” Gu Tieshou said coldly with a commanding attitude!

The Heavenly Jewel Mortal King’s eyes glimmered with a flash as sharp as a sword and chillingly spoke: “Since your sect seeks its own demise, I shall help you!”

“Engage!” Gu Tieshou cried out to let the disciples prepare for battle.

“This is the last warning, will you hand them over or not?” The Heavenly Jewel Mortal King gazed down at the sect below, then at Gu Tieshou and Li Qiye.

“Ten thousand cavalrymen!” However, Li Qiye was still calm as he spoke: “I wonder if the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom behind you also came or not. If not, then ten thousand cavalrymen is not enough as an appetizer.”

Li Qiye’s arrogant words left Gu Tieshou dumbfounded with a wry smile. The ten thousand cavalrymen before them were all elites from the Heavenly God Sect; they were absolutely capable of breaking their sect. They essentially could not stop such a force!

“This kid turned crazy from fear. These ten thousand elites is plenty enough to destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect even if they do not use all of their power! He’s still speaking nonsense at the verge of their sect’s destruction!” Someone shook their head and commented. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Foolish little thing. Wait until I destroy your sect, then I will take my time interrogating you!” The Mortal King shouted: “Go, kill without mercy!”

There was no doubt that the Mortal King wanted to capture Li Qiye alive for his Heaven’s Will Secret Law along with his Immortal Physique Law!

“Boom!” At this time, the ten thousand cavalrymen took a step forward with a power that overwhelmed even the mountains and rivers with an extremely orderly formation. Their formation gave off a cold blooded and murderous aura, causing the entire ground of the sect to shake. Everyone could only imagine the fate of the sect once this cavalry descended from the sky. How could the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect deter this unstoppable cavalry?

“Stop!” At this time, a shout resonated through the sky, shaking even the mountains and rivers. Even a character like the Mortal King changed his expression with some surprise.

An old man void stepped in the sky to arrive at the scene. Each of his steps seemed akin to the movement of the celestials as the heaven and earth shifted. His blood energy resembled an endless wave. With extreme domination, it was as if his blood energy was able to overturn all things! Even people who did not recognize him still became astonished by the old man’s blood energy. One lord recognized his identity and exclaimed in horror: “Elder Jiang, an outer-sect elder of the War God Temple!”

“An Elder of the War God Temple!” Hearing such words, even people who didn’t recognize him were in dismay.

The War God Temple was the most ancient existence in the Grand Middle Territory and was built during the Desolate Era. After millions of years passed by and as Immortal Emperors came and went, countless sects had disappeared amidst the river of time and numerous heritages were destroyed, but the War God Temple still stood strong!

The sudden arrival of this old man caused the Mortal King to be greatly alarmed. They had received news that the War God Temple no longer supported the Nine Saint Demon Gate and even locked the Demon King in their temple. Because of this, he led the troops to annihilate the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and even to destroy the Nine Saint Demon Gate in one breath. He was one hundred percent sure of victory due to the support of the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom! If this battle was successful, then he will achieve a peerless status at the Heavenly God Sect. In the future, his prestige will be equal to the Progenitor of the Heavenly God Sect; it would be more than enough to go down in the historical annals!

His heart sank as he knew that the matter was not looking good with the arrival of the War God Temple.

“Heavenly Jewel Mortal King, this matter ends here. Quickly withdraw your troops!” Elder Jiang looked at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, then he ordered the Mortal King.

At this moment, the cavalrymen all stared at the Mortal King, waiting for his order.

“The War God Temple is extending your grasp a bit too far!” At this moment, a cold voice appeared. A man emerged from the void. This man wore a court official hat while standing in the clouds. A blue energy surrounded his body like a flying immortal in the sky.

“The Imperial Advisor of the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom!” After seeing this person, a person exclaimed with a pale face, then he murmured: “That year, even the Ninth Ancestor of the Ancient Kingdom praised his exceptional aptitude!”

“Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom!” Li Qiye narrowed his eyes and observed this Imperial Advisor of the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom that had just arrived.

At this time, the Mortal King also glanced at the Imperial Advisor. He needed the powerful support from the Ancient Kingdom. Even though their Heavenly God Sect was formidable, they did not have the capability to oppose the War God Temple; However, it would be a different story with the backing of the Ancient Kingdom.

“Qingxuan Xiong!” Elder Jiang of the War God Temple glared at the Imperial Advisor and gravely said: “Don’t make a mistake! Opposing the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is akin to being enemies with our War God Temple!”

His words changed everyone’s demeanor, including the Mortal King! Before, the Nine Saint Demon Gate had the support of the War God Temple, but a third-rate sect like the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was not valued by the War God Temple. Today, the War God Temple showed their stance in front of everyone; this truly shook everyone’s mind! The War God Temple strongly supported the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, they didn’t even mind being enemies with the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom.

Why the sudden change? Keep in mind that the sect was no longer the same as it once was! This caused everyone to glance at each other in confusion.

As for the group of Gu Tieshou along with the Cleansing Incense disciples, they were extremely excited and emotional! They didn’t think that the temple would actually support their sect! It was unbelievable that they have obtained the temple’s support even though they had never managed to get into such a giant power’s grace before!

Even Chen Baojiao and Li Shuangyan glanced at each other. At this moment, they seemed to be aware of something. Only Li Qiye was calm and nonchalant and no one knew what he was thinking.

“Your War God Temple’s heroic spirit can even devour the heavens!” Imperial Advisor Qingxuan Xiong of the Ancient Kingdom snorted and continued on: “I’m afraid that even your War God Temple in the present day cannot protect yourself. Your temple is too rotten; you should worry about yourselves first, don’t reach out beyond your grasp. The Grand Middle Territory is not a domain for just yourselves!”
