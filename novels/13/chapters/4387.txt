Chapter 4388: Just Like That

“I have never thought about leaving the city or betraying Phoenix Ground. I am always a member of Dragon, Phoenix Ground, and the Jian, not a deserter or a traitor.” She shook her head.

“What is your plan?” He asked.

“I want to save Father.” She replied: “Putting him under house arrest is a mistake, a detriment to the sect’s wellbeing. You know this along with many others.”

The monkey king only sighed. Currently, Peacock Monarch has garnered the support of Dragon Platform and Tiger Pond. The other branches and their ancestors also supported him.

It could be said that his influence was untouchable right now. Goldbird and the Jian were no longer enough to deter him.

Because of this, Goldbird was put under house arrest. The fact that he wasn’t prosecuted was thanks to the Jian’s power and authority in Phoenix Ground. Even Peacock Monarch couldn’t go overboard against them.

Nonetheless, it wasn’t wise for her to go against Peacock Monarch right now. She could be just fine while staying in Phoenix Ground but this might not be the case outside of it.

“I think you need to reconsider, just one wrong move might result in banishment.” The monkey king glanced at Li Qiye and then back at her.

He implied that Peacock Monarch and the others wouldn’t allow her to save her father, meaning that a battle was inevitable.

It could be construed as betraying Dragon and killing fellow sect members. At that point, both the father and daughter, even their clan, would be in trouble. Ultimately, betrayal was a serious offense.

The money king thought that she was strong enough to break into the prison on top of knowing the defenses of Phoenix Ground. Moreover, Li Qiye was unfathomable as well.

There was a high chance of success but what would come after saving her father? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Grandpa, don’t worry, I will not use force.” She revealed: “I want justice. We are a righteous sect thus there will be places with reasonable people.”

His eyes narrowed, seemingly aware of her goal.

“Fine, follow the rooster’s crow. That is the place you’re looking for.” He nodded.

“Thank you.” She bowed her head.

He waved his hand and said: “Go, we can open a path in Phoenix Ground but once you leave, there is nothing we can do.”

She bowed again before leaving with Li Qiye.

“Senior Uncle, what now?” A great demon nearby asked.

“What else can we do but watch?” The monkey king said.

“What about the monarch’s eventual trial?” The demon asked again about Goldbird.

They were lost without their leader who willingly put himself under arrest. They needed to be cautious of Dragon Platform and Tiger Pond wanting to take over.

“Ignore it for now, we’re not that easily bullied and the Jian won’t give up without a fight either.” The monkey king said.

“But the sect master has given the order.” The demon became worried.

“Sure, but he can’t make all the decisions here. The three ancient ancestors have yet to state their stance, it’s too early to say. Wait for it.”

The demon found this reasonable. Normally, the sect master was in charge but not for everything. The ancestors, especially the three ancient ones, had vetoing power.

“What if they will not interfere?” Another demon asked.

“Then we have to ask the demon god to make a decision.” A peer nearby answered instead.

Nine-tailed God was even above the three ancient ancestors. Any decision from this being was final.

“We can’t bother the demon god over something so trivial.” The monkey king shook his head.

A trial for Goldbird would be carried out by the three main branches. There was no need to summon the demon god. Moreover, they didn’t know where he was either way.

***

No one stopped Li Qiye and Jian Qingzhu along the way because the monkey king had given the order. They turned a blind eye and ignored the duo.

They left Phoenix Ground and returned to the city. There were peaks everywhere but the peace of nature couldn’t be seen.

People were everything, flying and riding on beasts. The news of the duo had attracted everyone’s attention. Regular disciples gave way but still gossiped quietly.

“Is Senior Sister Jian really a traitor?” One of them whispered.

“Impossible, she is a pillar of the sect.” The second was skeptical.

“But she left Phoenix Ground with that weak sect master.” Most were noisy and wanted to learn more.

“What’s so good about him?” A female disciple who had recently joined couldn’t understand.

Official disciples like them never cared about the countless small sects under Dragon’s jurisdiction.

They were merely stepping stones before reaching the final goal - Dragon.

“I don’t know, maybe there is something exceptional about him.” An older disciple shook his head.

“I don’t think so, I’ve met him before. There is nothing special about him.” The female disciple responded.

“Is his cultivation brilliant?” Another interjected.

“No, it’s so strange though. He's weak but he still managed to kill Senior Brother Sky Eagle’s group. I believe he has capable treasures.” A youth who had seen Li Qiye before joined in.

“Treasures? What are we talking about here?” Many became spirited.

This was the City of Demons, a rather complicated area where crooks mixed in with the honest folks. Some might actually take the risk to try and steal Li Qiye’s treasures.
