Chapter 4086: Battle Soon

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The beast legion instilled fear into the spectators. However, this was only the strongest legion under the first elder. It wasn’t the strongest in Armament Mountain. This was a testament to this sect’s power.

Though Armament Mountain only had two dao lords, it still withstood the test of time. There must be reasons for this and they couldn’t be underestimated.

“Boom!” The sky turned dark and people saw the bottom of a foot first. It stomped the border of the plain in a shocking fashion.

This great demon appeared before everyone. Sure, the plain was right next to Armament Mountain. However, it was still thousands and thousands of miles away. Nonetheless, this demon only needed one step to reach this place.

His head touched the sky and couldn’t be seen by the naked eyes. He was an ape with furs as long as waterfalls. Dao halos circled around him.

It was as if his body was a power source capable of creating new dao and worlds. Just one wave of his hand could annihilate a region.

“Celestial Ape Demon King!” People shuddered while staring at him.

He was currently serving as the first elder of Armament and used to be the national teacher of God Ape Kingdom for three consecutive generations. There was a chance that he could be as strong as Starshooter King, or at least extremely close.

Nonetheless, his appearance struck the crowd harder.

Starshooter King was obviously mighty and had a regal aura, looking like a crane among a flock of chickens. On the other hand, the demon simply had a monstrous body. His breathing alone let out gales and tornadoes.

Because of this, weaker cultivators falsely assumed that he was stronger than the king.

All in all, this alliance against Li Qiye became quite impressive. Not to mention a single cultivator, even a sect would be terrified.

“Two legions and two powerful sovereigns. Can Li Qiye’s grand formation handle this?” A cultivator asked.

“We’ll see soon enough. If the formation fails, it’ll be over for Li Qiye. More people will go for him.” A high elder replied.

At the present, no one dared to invade the plain because of the grand formation. However, when Li Qiye fell into a disadvantage, they would certainly want a piece of the pie.

“No, Li Qiye is insane. Maybe he’ll be able to route both legions. Just watch, everything will end quickly.” One ancestor said.

Only a few hoped for Li Qiye’s victory. The majority wanted to see him lose so that the legacy would be available again. Just a little bit from it would be enough to last a lifetime.

“Hurry up and fight already.” Another gloated, ready to see a bloodbath.

The two legions remained outside the plain. Their commanders’ eyes were fixated on the fortresses and towers.

This was especially true for Celestial Ape Demon King. He was quite frustrated due to the lack of information on the plain. They never realized its value in the past. These fortresses and towers seemingly appeared overnight.

He and the king exchanged glances, unable to fathom the formation and its source. Thus, they certainly lacked confidence in a direct attack.

“Junior, it’s not too late to give up or there will be no place for you to go in this world…” The demon king uttered.

“The world is where I am.” Li Qiye interrupted him: “This is quite simple, fight or pay the ransom? Just pick one and start already, stop wasting time.”

The demon king turned red but no one saw it to his large stature and hairy face. Being disrespected by a junior was both new and unacceptable to him.

“We’ll see how long you can last, brat.” He roared then swung his hand forward: “Start.”

Two battalions of the demon army started marching. However, they didn’t directly enter the plain but rather moved around its border.

At first, spectators thought that this was a surrounding maneuver to trap Li Qiye. However, this wasn’t the case since they only stood still. This no longer became a surprise pincer.

The king’s command seemed to be weakening his formation, making it easier for Li Qiye to win. People couldn’t understand his choice.

“Buzz.” Suddenly, roots came out of the members from the two battalions and started drilling into the ground.

“They’re plant and tree-based demons.” The spectators gradually got a good idea of their goal.

Things seemed to be moving rapidly beneath the plain, evident by the trails on top of the soil. Eventually, these roots dug out of the ground and started growing bigger, looking like serpents.

This phenomenon happened as far as the eye can see. Tentacle-like roots have taken over.

“That looks so gross.” One spectator felt his scalp tingling.

They began coiling around the coordinate lines, fortresses, and towers - looking like pythons killing their prey.

“The demon king wants to stop or destroy this formation from underground.” The spectators knew his true intent.

“Is it actually possible?” One expert wondered while staring at the countless roots and vines surrounding the buildings.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
