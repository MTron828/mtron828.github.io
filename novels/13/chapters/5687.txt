Chapter 5688: Grant Us Asylum!

“Boom!” The continent shook violently as Luminous Conqueror sacrificed his true blood and body. An infinite blaze of dazzling imperial flames swept through the realm, displaying total annihilation.

This tactic sought mutual destruction as the flames destroyed the stars. It engulfed War, Nine-wheel, and Just-once, sending them flying.

Qing Xuan and San Dao, on the other hand, couldn’t withstand this power. Their defenses collapsed, leaving them helpless to the flames. Sure enough, they exploded into blood mists.

Luminous paid the heaviest price - depleting all of his true blood and having his body disperse into ashes.

His primordial dao fruit and his true fate remained. Alas, the latter was as feeble as a candle in the wind. Even if he were to somehow survive this, he would have to start over from zero. The majestic Luminous Conqueror was no more. Just a gust of wind now could put an end to his life.

“Whoosh!” The grievously injured West Bank Prime Emperor rushed over. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In reality, his condition was just as bad since he had sacrificed his true blood and Prime Seal. He gritted his teeth and relied on sheer willpower to move.

He grabbed the true fate and primordial dao fruit, flying toward Momentous Frontier with his remaining strength.

“Yes, go!” Spectators felt overwhelming respect for this attempt. They prayed for these two to survive the battle.

In the future, there would be hope for them leading The People back and retaking Dao Domain. Such a thing wasn’t unprecedented during the eternal conflict between The People and The Race. Territories have been occupied by Celestial Court only to be won over in the future.

“Imperial Field is still around, we still have hope.” Some placed their hope on Imperial Field - a great power that could assist West Bank Prime Emperor and Luminous Conqueror in the future.

“They’re heading for Momentous Frontier.” Someone said.

Flying to Imperial Field was unrealistic given the distance even for emperors, not to mention the emperor being at the end of the rope. During his prime state, perhaps he could have employed a special method to do so.

Moreover, Celestial Court’s cultivators would surely pursue in full force. Momentous Frontier became the only viable option.

“Catch them!” Members of Celestial Court stabilized themselves after surviving the two detonations.

One apex cultivator after another headed for Momentous Frontier.

“Deities, please grant us asylum.” West Bank Prime Emperor no longer cared for permission and jumped inside.

Prior to this, as an apex cultivator, he wouldn’t dare to recklessly come in without permission since this would invoke the wrath of the deities. Alas, being one step slow meant certain death so he didn’t take the rules into account.

“They made it!” The survivors heaved a sigh of relief. There was still hope.

“Rumble!” War and the others arrived outside the border, aware of the consequences for entering without permission.

After a short while, their armies gathered outside Momentous Frontier as well. Not even a fly could get through.

They had a radiant pulse around them, looking unstoppable. Armors and weapons made them resemble a flood of steel. Everyone could see that no lineage could survive this.

Mortals in Momentous Frontier saw what was happening outside and trembled in horror.

“Can they endure?” Ancestors outside observed the scene.

They felt hopeful earlier but the grim reality dawned on them. Celestial Court was just too strong.

“The deities were apex existences back then. Space Dragon Emperor, in particular, was the pioneer of the dragon lord’s path, he could take on anyone.” Some spoke to reassure themselves.

“Right, Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor, they invaded Celestial Court before and left unscathed.” Another said.

We're heading to the hospital now for the c-section delivery. Wish us luck and I will try to translate while in the hospital.
