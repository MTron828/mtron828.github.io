The group didn’t march with loud fanfare nor put on an ostentatious show. Nevertheless, the atmosphere became tense right away.

They were virtually silent walking out of the portal in an orderly manner. This style actually made them feel invincible, capable of knocking down all obstacles - cutting through the mountains and earth, slashing through the lakes and oceans.

One particular person stood out in this group. He certainly commanded the spotlight wherever he went.

He was very young and dressed in all white with a cool attitude while holding a long sword. There was no aggression, pressure, and arrogance in him.

Alas, just his presence alone made people stagger backward with fear - enough to make them tremble. In fact, his glare could cause pain like a thrust penetrating the heart or the neck- a fatal sword move. People gulped and wondered if there was a hole in their throat with blood oozing out.

“Lightning Sword God, Su Mobai!” Someone shouted.

“He rarely leaves the Mu Clan. If he’s here, the emperor is definitely coming.” The crowd was surprised.

“Yes, it’s always with the emperor when he leaves the clan.” People felt dread.

Su Mobai was Puresword True Emperor’s First Disciple, also the master of Mu Chengjie who was killed by Li Qiye. Of course, Chengjie was only one of his disciples.

After hearing his name, the first reaction was thinking that he wasn’t from the Mu Clan. However, he actually had great status in the clan.

He had a different last name because he wasn’t born in the clan. His actual background was very humble and he had no noble bloodline to speak of.

His father was a worker on a farm, an untouchable of sorts. However, Mobai displayed incredible talents with the sword dao at a young age.

The emperor took note of this and brought him to the clan. He definitely didn’t let the emperor down. Under the emperor’s guidance, his cultivation soared greatly. Few youths in the clan could actually match him.

Remember, the Mu was ancient and vast with plenty of experts. This particular clan cared immensely about bloodline and background.

In spite of this, an untouchable like Mobai was able to rise through the ranks and eventually became Puresword True Emperor’s First Disciple. This was indicative of his excellent talents.

Some even said that he was just as talented as the emperor.

“Lightning Sword God is peerless due to his quick draw.” A youth was a big fan of Mobai instead of Puresword and Jade-break True Emperor.

“Yes, his cultivation isn’t a match for his faster, but in terms of speed, no one can compare to him. His quick draw will slit the throat before people know what’s going on.” Another youth lamented.

Mobai had plenty of fans in Imperial. The cultivators from small sects or had a humble beginning viewed him as their role model. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Though the two emperors had many admirers, they didn’t represent every cultivator, not the ones at the bottom of the social ranking.

They were born in the strongest systems and had a noble bloodline, blessed with extraordinary advantages from the very start.

Their current achievements were indeed due to their own talents and efforts. However, they were destined for greatness, not something the bottom-tiered cultivators could relate to.

This wasn’t the case for Mobai. An untouchable like him was basically an ant. Nevertheless, he managed to become one of the best cultivators in Imperial and overwhelmed his peers in the Mu Clan. People couldn’t help but praise him for this.

Ultimately, his background and achievements earned him sympathy and respect from weaker cultivators. They thought that they could become as famous and strong as him one day through sheer effort and determination.

“He chose an unconventional yet effective path. If he had only followed the footsteps of his master, then he would be shackled to that path, doomed to be inferior to his master. However, his quick draw is impeccable right now, perhaps surpassing the emperor himself.” An old expert said.

An old man who had fought against Mobai agreed: “Yes, his speed is unrivaled. True to his title, his comprehension of the sword dao is very unique, maybe not on the same level as the emperor but far above the other youths.”

Both the lowly cultivators and noble masters praised and admired Su Mobai for his current achievements.

Mobai didn’t enter Mingluo right away but decided to stay in a palace on the mound.

This mound has been blessed by Puresword True Emperor’s grand dao so it became a formation of sorts, capable of both offense and defense. This was a perfect place for an encampment.

He didn’t show himself again and without his orders, the Mu disciples didn’t dare to do anything on their own volition. Once again, this showed his high status in the clan.

Plenty of these disciples were part of noble bloodlines - descendants of emperors and even progenitors. But now, they still listened to someone with a different last name.

“Whoosh!” A green branch crossed through the sky a while later, also pinning on another mound outside of Mingluo.

“Rumble!” The branch started growing at an incredible pace.

The crowd couldn’t believe it. It was only as thick as a finger earlier but now, it has turned into a sky-blotting tree.

It continued to grow with nonstop detonations. Its thick roots looked like true dragons and drilled deep into the ground while roaring, fortifying the tree.

It began to absorb the spirit energy and water of this area, drying the whole place out. This crazily spread until only barren land was left.
