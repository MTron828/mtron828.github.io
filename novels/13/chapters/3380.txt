“Rumble!” The army of Three Truths finally marched against Divine Black under the leadership of the three daoists, aiming to take down the three main peaks of Divine Black.

On the other side were Zhang Yue, Mountainbearer King, and the chief elder leading their disciples. Morale was at an all-time high; their men were ready to fight to the death.

In the sky were two birds wrestling in the air, dashing upward then smashing into the ground. The stars trembled from their fight.

An elephant and a white tiger fought fiercely below. They crushed mountains and rivers just from their movements. Peaks broke down like dried branches.

Meanwhile, the great shield of Eight Zhang encompassed thousands of miles. It stopped the suppressive pagoda from above. Though the latter was empowered by the army of Three Truths, it was still stopped by the shield.

One could hear the explosions from a hundred thousand miles away. Just the sound waves were unbearable almost like the end of the world.

From another point, the Hellbreaker Drill was still trying to take down the crystal barrier. It seemed to be a stalemate.

The spectators were in awe. A war between two big sects was truly shocking.

“Divine Black is so strong.” One of them praised. Everyone could see that it hasn’t gone all out yet still managed to keep the army at bay.

“Remember, Three Truths still has three sacred-level cultivators. They haven’t begun.” Most were still bullish on Three Truths.

The ones nearby became anxious right away. Divine Black had an easy time right now but there were still Three Truths Sect Master and Xu Nan in waiting.

They only had one sacred-level cultivator - Ping Suoweng. He definitely couldn’t take on two powerful foes at once. Moreover, Lu Yiling remained a threat.

Suoweng’s defeat was inevitable. By that point, nothing would be able to save Divine Black.

“How is Ping Suoweng going to win? It’s over if he can’t come up with anything.” A spectating elder said.

While the battles raged in several locations, Suoweng and Three Truths Sect Master were locked in a staredown.

It looked as if they were just gazing at each other. However, the first exchange has already been made. A keen observer would spot a fluttering leaf being crushed by a terrible sword energy. These two were fighting with their battle intent - an invisible contest.

Eventually, they both took a step forward. Suoweng disappeared from South Conch Peak and the sect master got away from his army. The two were now standing face-to-face.

“It’s happening, a battle between two sacred cultivators.” The spectators shouted.

The sacred level was everyone’s aspiration. It was rare to see a fight of this level so they wanted to enjoy it to the fullest. Plus, they might benefit from it too.

“Long time no see, Suoweng. Your South Conch Sword Art is truly peerless. Our previous fight taught me plenty.” Three Truths Sect Master humbly said.

“You’re too kind. Your skills have reached perfect mastery, the apogee, even. Enough to make others sigh with admiration.” Suoweng said.

This wouldn’t be their first fight so they were familiar with each other - old friends on the battlefield. They understood each other more than most and sounded like friends instead of mortal enemies. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“After you, Suoweng.” Three Truths Sect Master politely suggested.

“Excuse me then.” Suoweng said. His eyes immediately flashed brightly. A sword flash exuded from his body.

“Clank!” This was akin to him being infused with a million divine swords. Some started spreading behind him like the tail of a peacock.

Swords suddenly became the ruler of this world, terrifying everyone with murderous sword intents. Others couldn’t help trembling as a result.

He looked different in the blink of an eye, no longer a friendly old man but the lord of swords with authority over life.

“That’s the real Ping Suoweng.” Some spectating sect masters murmured. A few were fooled by his appearance when they first met.

How could the master of a sect actually be friendly and amicable in this tough world?

Three Truths Sect Master’s weapon of choice was a ruyi scepter.

“Buzz.” It released a jade radiance, enough to drown out the area. Green rays started filling the area. They could immediately turn someone into a sieve.

“Clank!” The divine swords behind Suoweng gathered together and formed a sword dao. With this, he unsheathed his sword and released its power.

“A dao lord sword.” The spectators could tell right away.

Meanwhile, his opponent’s scepter also hymned. The rays condensed together and formed three lotus flowers right above him. They could shoulder heaven itself and affect the reincarnation cycles. It had a similar aura as the sword, meaning that it was also a dao lord weapon.

“A weapon contest.” A spectator said. Both sect masters were evenly matched with their weapons.

“I’ll overestimate myself and test myself against your sword art again today.” Three Truths Sect Master declared.

“Let’s see your Ruyi Trinity!” Suoweng responded as he channeled energy into his sword. Its grand dao and dao lord affinity exploded.
