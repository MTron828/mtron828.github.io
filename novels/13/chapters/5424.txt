Chapter 5425: For The People

The red rays became more violent before, shooting straight at those on the altars and turning them into sieves.

They didn’t utter a single cry of pain or struggle despite the devastating unfolding on them. In fact, they seemed to bask in the agony since this was another step closer to their grand goal.

The crowd took a deep breath while watching these top cultivators sacrifice themselves. They had achieved virtually everything and could live life to the fullest extent. Few could give up all the pleasures known to men, but they were going to do so.

Everyone could tell that Illumination was crazy. They didn’t expect some of his followers to feel the same way. They shared the same madness in their heart and obsession in their mind.

For Devil Conqueror - this was one way to avenge his sect, and the same for Riverwalker.

They didn’t sacrifice themselves for Illumination Conqueror but for their own pursuit that they deemed virtuous. They wholeheartedly believed that all they had done was for The People's sake.

“For The People!” They shouted as their dao fruits and sacred fruits were being crushed to pieces.

“Boom!” Blinding red explosions detonated, signaling the end of these cultivators.

“Farewell, Brothers.” Tears streamed down Illumination’s cheeks.

“How nauseating.” Swordsea sneered: “The victims here are the wise sages and The People, to have members like them.”

All-things only let out a sigh and held back any negative comment.

“Driving him crazy is a prerequisite to killing him.” Supreme commented, showing no sign of sympathy.

In reality, the majority of the crowd had no love for Illumination at this point; the exception being the few supporters still alive.

They considered him to be a shameful mark of The People. He was not a protector like the wise sages who fought in the ancient wars. These heroes never claimed to be virtuous or selfless.

Despite his claim, he didn’t seem to have thought about what would actually be beneficial for The People. Starting wars was the farthest thing from it. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They didn’t view him as a hero being pushed to the brink of despair but rather, as a madman trying to act out a play.

“Boom!” The dao essences and vitality of the sacrificed cultivators were refined by the altar. Runic lines at the bottom lit up and issued loud blasts. It felt as if countless true dragons were leaving their lair all at once, roaring and rushing forward.

This empowered the altar with a force capable of crushing all the illusory realms.

“What a waste, their essences should have returned to the world.” Swordsea said what was on everyone’s mind.

In order to reach this level, the sacrificed cultivators have taken in a massive amount of natural resources and dao.

Their refined blood could nourish the land for generations. Just one drop of blood would allow for numerous mortal kingdoms to rise.

The death of a conqueror was both a personal tragedy and a heavenly nectar for the mortal world.

Unfortunately, instead of letting their essences return to the world, they sent them to the altar for refinement.

“Boom!” The pool filled with devil dreamwater surged into the sky and became boundless, seemingly having gained sentience and merging with the illusory realm.

“Come!” Illumination roared and became resplendent. The pool started harmonizing with him and answered his summon, immediately shooting back down and latching onto him.

Loud explosions detonated around the grotto as he became empowered.
