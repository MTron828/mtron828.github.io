Chapter 5406: Star Transformation

Seven-star Conqueror didn’t know how to react; this was his first time being treated in this manner. He had seen apex cultivators before but they didn’t treat people like dirt.

“So overbearing, apex conquerors don’t even do this.” An ancient ancestor whispered.

“Right, apex conquerors display magnanimity, a trait not seen in Li Qiye.” A big shot whispered back.

“That’s just who Li Qiye is, always acting as if all things in the world are beneath his notice.” A peerless dragon lord couldn’t see through Li Qiye. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Since his appearance, many big shots have thought about his origin and strength. Was he on the same level as Sword Queen and the others?

More knowledgeable existences understood that he was substantially stronger, but to what extent?

“Brother, everything can be negotiated…” Seven-star took a deep breath and said calmly.

“If our young noble tells you to scram, scram or face the consequence.” Li Xian’er stepped forward and uttered coldly.

Seven-star turned red from anger after the repeated showing of disdain. As a dominant conqueror, he preferred death over dishonor.

Many didn’t sympathize with his situation. After all, if Jadecure Conqueror didn’t have a strong backer, she would be the one humiliated right now.

“You are being more than unreasonable.” He said.

“Fine, get ready to die then.” Li Xian’er summoned her Immortal Piercer.

“!!!” Everyone became alarmed after seeing the renowned weapon. Only apex conquerors could potentially survive an encounter with her.

Moreover, being pierced meant certain death - there was a long list of victims who believed they were above it. The only way to survive was to avoid it altogether.

Seven-star staggered backward after seeing the chain, finding himself to be in quite a predicament. He cared for his reputation and didn’t want to throw it away by running. On the other hand, this could be a fatal encounter.

Eventually, he made up his mind and shouted: “I will entertain you if it’s a fight you want.”

“So be it.” Li Xian’er had a merciless expression. The crowd could smell the stench of blood while being near her aura.

This has been her style all along - always ready to draw blood.

“Let’s go!” Seven-star released his six resplendent dao fruits, making it hard for weaker crowd members to keep their eyes open.

He had countless stars keeping him company and making him look like the lord of the cosmos. The seven main ones dictated the flow of this universe.

“Buzz.” They formed a celestial domain.

“Boundless Stars.” He murmured and dao laws surged downward like heavenly waterfalls. They seemed to be made from countless stars compressed together.

.

He then channeled their power into his grasp, fully dazzling the crowd.

“Star Transformation!” He roared and unleashed a meteor shower. They expanded infinitely and flew in the direction of Li Xian’er.

She immediately activated her Immortal Piercer. Its pulsing rays were as sharp as?blades.
