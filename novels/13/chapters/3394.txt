A celebration came to Divine Black after the battle. The members knew that Three Truths was no longer a threat, at least in this generation. Three Truths should be the one trembling with fear right now.

However, not all were celebrating. The experts began to consolidate their troops and battalions, especially the elders and protectors.

Some younger disciples were confused because the war was over. Nonetheless, the stronger ones realized that they needed to be in their peak state, always ready to mobilize.

Meanwhile, the neighbors of Divine Black were on guard. They kept a keen eye on its movement while feeling as if they were walking on thin ice. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The military drills of the sect didn’t help this issue either. These neighbors thought that something bad was coming during these sensitive times.

The previous battle ended with Three Truths’ main army decimated. They lost five daoists out of the seven including the genius Lu Yiling.

Thus, they lost their elites and have become a headless snake. Three Truths wouldn’t be able to muster up a fight.

If Divine Black were to attack right now, Three Truths would definitely turn to ashes.

None would criticize Divine Black for wanting to attack. After all, Three Truths took the initiative; this was justified retaliation.

However, the end of Three Truths would herald supremacy for its foe. The entire region would be an item in Divine Black’s pocket.

Without a powerful foe to hold them back, an expansion might be the next goal. The borders and immediate neighbors were the most likely targets.

That’s why the smaller sects nearby became nervous, afraid that the flames of war might come for them next. They had two choices in the future - either becoming tributes or risking destruction.

Li Qiye didn’t care for any of this. No one in the sect came to bother him either.

Most stayed far away from his peak. Those crossing by would try to keep their pace as quiet as possible, not wanting to disturb his peace. Some even bowed whenever they got close.

Today, Ping Suoweng came for an audience. After seeing Li Qiye, he got on his knees for a full ceremony.

The sect master of Divine Black was acting like a regular disciple before Li Qiye.

The latter lazily lay in his chair like always with Gong Qianyue serving him some tea.

Ping Suoweng expressed his gratitude since Li Qiye saved Divine Black, and that they would never forget about this.

Li Qiye was currently a member of Divine Black but Suoweng knew that he wouldn’t stay around much longer. This visit was only a touch of fate.

“You’re not here only to thank me, right?” Li Qiye chuckled.

Suoweng’s expression became awkward. He hesitated for a bit before speaking: “Young Master, Three Truths have crossed the line and our disciples are furious. They can’t forget about this transgression...”

“Stop walking in circles. You want to attack Three Truths, just say that.” Li Qiye interrupted him with a hand wave.

Suoweng’s face turned slightly red. He coughed and said: “It’s not that we’re trying to kick a horse while it’s down. The disciples just think that this is a godsend opportunity.”

“Sure.” Li Qiye nodded: “Mobilize and take them down. All of their territories will belong to Divine Black. This region is yours.”

“I, I haven’t thought about that.” Suoweng’s expression seemed unnatural.

In reality, both he and the elders harbored such ideas. This was rather understandable.

Three Truths was at its weakest while Divine Black’s morale was at an all-time high. Why would they wait now?

As for the territories afterward? That could be debated after the victory.

“This determines the course of Divine Black and its future. It is your responsibility along with the others’, talk to them about it, not me.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I am only passing by and simply decided to fight once. You all are the ones to take charge of Divine Black, don’t worry about me.”

Suoweng understood, realizing Li Qiye’s intention. The guy had done enough for Divine Black anyway.

“I’m worrying about the ancestral peak.” He eventually brought another issue up.

In reality, he had already made up his mind about the retaliation and future territory issues. However, the matter of the ancestral peak still plagued him.

Once this secret became known, Divine Black would become everyone’s enemy. At that point, not to mention attacking Three Truths, they might have a hard time defending their sect.

That’s why they were preparing for war. This wasn’t for the sake of attacking Three Truths but only to be ready for the worst. More powerful sects might be coming. For example, Yin Yang Gate.

Yin Yang Gate might be far away to the south but if it truly wanted to, it could still create a high-level portal to mobilize quickly.

Suoweng worried about this possibility the most. Everything would be fine as long as Li Qiye was around. However, how could a shallow pond hold a true dragon?

“Forget about the ancestral peak, it’ll be concluded in two days.” Li Qiye said.

Suoweng didn’t expect this but at least everything should be fine now. He became excited and asked for confirmation: “Really?”

Li Qiye didn’t answer.

He took a deep breath and bowed, feeling far better than before: “Thank you, Young Master.”

“It’s time for me to leave.” Li Qiye accepted the gesture and brought up something else.

Suoweng expected this, just not this early. He stood there at a loss for words.
