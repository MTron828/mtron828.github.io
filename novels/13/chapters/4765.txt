Chapter 4766: Perfect Immortal Physiques

This wasn’t just a reversion in terms of appearance. She had actually changed back to a child, hence her new personality. The mental growth wouldn’t be different from others.

This heaven-defying bloodline was rather rare and has been gone for eras. It wasn’t limited to just one reversion either.

It came from the depths of the sea and has been extinct. She somehow managed to wake it up billions of years later.

This wasn’t to say that it was all and well. She remembered who she used to be - a powerful dragon king who acted with wisdom.

Now, she kept her power, cultivation, and even retrieved her memories. This didn’t mean that she was who she used to be previously. The elegant and wise Wo Longxuan no longer existed.

“I don’t think there can be a better bloodline than this.” Jianshi said since Wo Longxuan had access to something no one else did, not even the emperors and dao lords.

“Your immortal physiques are just as impressive.” Li Qiye smiled.

The two had access to immortal physique arts. Initially, they used the version found in their own respective sect. Later on, Li Qiye guided them and gave them a superior version. They gained a physique extremely close to the ones created by the scripture.

After eras and repeated polishment, their physique was infinitely close to being perfect. In the distant past, a grand completion immortal physique could fight an Immortal Emperor. Some had won before too. Now, their physique has reached the immaculate pinnacle.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Keep in mind that cultivating these physiques was rather difficult. Supreme geniuses might be able to reach grand completion but imperfections and flaws existed during the process.

Heaven Devourer Evil Physique and Sacred Spring Physique - they allowed their users to become unbeatable.

“We owe it to you, Young Noble.” Jianshi bowed deeply.

“No, your achievement comes from your own effort, I merely corrected some mistakes.” Li Qiye said.

“Is there anything else we can do better?” Ruyan coquettishly asked, trying to charm him.

“How nauseating.” Wo Longxuan said with contempt, thinking that Ruyan was trying to seduce Li Qiye.

“Don’t be jealous, cute dragon king. You wouldn’t be able to do this given your current figure.” Ruyan glanced at her and taunted.

“Maybe I should break some bones. We’ll see if you can act cute afterward.” Longxuan threatened.

Ruyan took this opportunity to pat her heaving chest again and said: “I wonder if you can break my bones, Dragon King.”

Longxuan was certainly strong but Ruyan was no slouch either. The outcome of a fight between them wasn’t obvious.

“Vixen.” Longxuan gritted her teeth.

“Thanks for the compliment, you have to be attractive to be a vixen.” Ruyan chuckled.

The previous Longxuan wouldn’t care to participate in nonsensical bickering. Alas, she had a bad temper right now while lacking verbal quips.

Jianshi, on the other hand, focused on official business: “Young Noble, do you think our cultivation can still be improved? We have reached a bottleneck for a long period now.”

Her elegance and graceful maturity made her just as attractive as Ruyan. The two simply had different styles.

Li Qiye shook his head and said: “You two have done a great job with your physique, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call it perfect.”

“But there is still room for improvements in your eyes, Young Noble.” Jianshi stared at him with anticipation in her eyes.

Longxuan seemed possessive of Li Qiye and snorted after seeing Jianshi’s expression.

“A new realm requires an unmatched opportunity. This is rather difficult while being in this world.” Li Qiye said.

“What should we do then, Young Noble?” Ruyan asked.

“Hard to say, I’m not sure such an opportunity for improving your physique exists here. Your current achievement is already admirable and rare.” Li Qiye elaborated.

The two exchanged glances.

“This happened when we were trapped in the maelstrom. The precarious situation gave us a chance to polish our dao flaws.” Jianshi said softly.

“This didn’t originate from the precarious situation but rather, your dao heart.” Li Qiye smiled: “The circumstance was just a turning point.”

“Makes sense.” Ruyan agreed.

They listened attentively because seeing Li Qiye again was a rare event nothing short of a miracle. Few were qualified to receive pointers from this historical figure.

Most importantly, due to their current strength and stagnation, they needed his guidance more than anything.
