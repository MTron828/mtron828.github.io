Chapter 5232: Cultivation Is The Only Path Towards Everlasting Life

Everyone respected the monk who had such focus in life. He immediately returned to Pure Land after fulfilling his goal.

“I see, it is not meant to be. Goodbye, everyone.” Immensity Conqueror shook his head and left as well, surprising the crowd.

They thought that he would stick around to see the immortal item.

“Does he not want anything else?” One curious soul asked.

“It is best to keep it simple for the sake of the dao.” A big shot said: “Having too many desires will slow one down regardless of their talent. Since he has nothing else on his mind, he is able to go far.”

Boss Tang didn’t mind losing two participants. He laughed and continued: “Okay, the second auction will be for Reincarnation Nine-Leaves.”

He clapped his hand and a treasure box was brought forward. Opening it revealed the plant with nine round leaves with fine serrations, giving the impression that they were constantly rotating.

The plant occasionally exuded a faint light, akin to the shining of a gem - the same for the leaves.

“This is it?” Spectators took a look and some weren’t impressed by its appearance. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“This is more precious than heaven Reckon?” Another said.

“It might not be useful to young cultivators or regular people because death is death.” An ancient ancestor stared at it with a coveting gleam.

Those near-dead like him wanted nothing more than to grab the plant right now. Even the apex cultivators participating in the auction stared at it intensely.

As for the three geniuses, they understood its value but didn’t share the same intense feeling. Even if they were to bid, the plant would be meant for the aging seniors.

According to the legends, eating the plant gave a chance for reincarnation. The first leaf had a twenty percent chance of success. The subsequent ones had an increasingly lower chance of success. Failure meant dying but eating all nine could allow someone to maintain their memories after reincarnation.

All in all, due to the rarity of the plant and a dire lack of information, some who were lucky enough to come across it didn’t dare to eat without thinking twice.

“I’ve been searching for a long time now. Here it is right before my very eyes.” Immortal Emperor Yao Zu commented.

“Is reincarnation truly possible with it?” Omniscient Conqueror remained skeptical despite his vast knowledge.

“I only sell the merchandise, no guarantee. If one of you is successful later, be sure to send me a message.” Boss Tang smiled.

“Every medicine has three parts poison.” Immortal Emperor Yao Zu said: “Backlashes are inevitable when consuming a high number of longevity medicines. One attempt might decrease lifespan instead. The same applies to this plant. It might grant reincarnation or a hellish life, just a matter of cause and effect.”

“Longevity medicines can decrease lifespan?” Li Zhitian hasn’t heard of this before.

“This cannot be generalized, medicines are mostly effective, of course.” The emperor said: “Actual lifespan estimation is difficult. Some can last ten thousand years later than they should, and how would one accurately gauge the effectiveness of longevity medicines in those cases? Nonetheless, while medicines can save lives, they can also take lives.”

Others contemplated the matter in silence.

“The only true path to everlasting life is cultivation.” The quiet Celestial Stone Dao Lord suddenly remarked.

“Yes, only the immortal dao.” The emperor agreed: “Longevity medicines are still an external force, not a permanent solution.

“Okay, okay, if we’re done talking about everlasting life, let’s start the bid.” Boss Tang waited for them to finish before starting.

Li Zhitian slowly took out an item and spread it: “This is a leather scroll from time immemorial. Our seniors call it Epoch Membrane.”

“Epoch Membrane?” The group exchanged glances of confusion.

Of course, they knew that an item being used as a bid by the successor of Imperial should be something amazing.

“Timeless.” Omniscient didn’t wish to divulge its history.

“Not bad at all.” Boss Tang said: “Unfortunately, it is too small or I would resew it into a personal robe, it might save me from the next calamity. If you have a bigger peace, then it’s a deal.”

“The seniors did everything they could and only got this piece.” Li Zhitian smiled wryly.

Omniscient Dao Lord took out a jar and said: “A world in a jar.”

It had a resplendent light as if there were galaxies within. It appeared to be formed naturally instead of being manmade.

Spectators felt that if he were to flip it over, countless treasures would fall out of it.

“Wish Jar, I have heard of it before.” Boss Tang said.

“Yes, I have traveled the world and finally found it.” Omniscient Dao Lord said.

“It is marvelous but unfortunately, all the treasures dropping from it cannot compare to the jar itself. I am not establishing a sect so I don’t need that many treasures.” Boss Tang shook his head.

The paradox of the jar was that although it could release endless treasures, all of this couldn’t compare to the jar itself. This was useful to those seeking quantity instead of quality.
