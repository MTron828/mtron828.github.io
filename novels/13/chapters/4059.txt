Chapter 4060: Who’s Stronger?

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The starry rays were no different than swords. This meant that the entire area became a net of swords, capable of killing gods if they were inside.

The spectators felt a permeating sword dao in front of them.

“So this is the Starshooter Sword Dao.” A spectator murmured.

The prince has yet to attack but the sword rays were ready to make a sieve out of his opponent. Cold air would infiltrate the soles of the feet before spreading upward, causing people to shudder.

He was indeed impressive and worthy of being one of the ten. His power and talents were exceptional for his age. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Would the princess’ technique be able to contend against this?” A youth wondered.

In their opinion, the art of Wooden Sword Holy Devil should be inferior to Starshooter Dao Lord’s.

“You probably don’t know this. Wooden Sword Holy Devil had beaten War God Dao Lord in the past.” Someone from the last generation shook his head.

This anecdote of the past stirred the listeners. War God Dao Lord’s generation was long ago so people only had a shallow understanding of him.

He wasn’t the strongest nor the most brilliant dao lord. He stood out for his love of battle, never giving up despite facing stronger enemies. The challenges would continue until his victory.

Rumor has it that he originated from a fallen temple. He eventually obtained the heavenly sword named War God along with the matching sword dao. Thus, he was definitely no slouch in battle.

As for Wooden Sword Holy Devil, his origin was far more mysterious. He seemed to appear out of nowhere overnight and was already powerful.

Cultivators tried so hard their whole lives and didn’t get close to the dao lord’s level. However, Wooden Sword Holy Devil shocked the world by defeating the dao lord after his debut.

This miraculous tale lived on to the present even though he died in a forbidden zone. It was considered one of the most memorable battles in history. It also built a strong foundation for his kingdom afterward.

Thus, those in the know were interested to see which sword dao was stronger.

Ning Zhu readied her sword and gently rotated her wrist so the tip nearly touched the ground. She didn’t have rampant sword energy and an oppressive aura.

It seemed rather ordinary compared to the prince’s impressive display.

“Your Highness, you may start.” She said.

The prince didn’t appreciate this and uttered coldly: “Princess, do you think you can defeat me?”

Though she didn’t say anything, her attitude made it seem as if she was far stronger than him, that she didn’t want to be a bully. The prince fully disagreed.

“We’ll see the outcome soon enough.” She calmly replied.

The crowd thought that she had changed. Previously, she has always been prideful to the point of being overbearing. They didn’t think much of it before because she was qualified to act in this manner.

Now, she became as serene as a well or as deep as an abyss. This was something unusual for those her age. The big shots in the crowd sensed something dangerous coming from her.

“Let’s see your sword art then.” The prince became annoyed by her indifference.

“Buzz.” He roared and buzzes could be heard.

The crowd felt ripples appearing in the air along with a cold breeze.

The stars up above were immediately replaced by sharp rays. Just one could pierce through anyone. The chilling energy coming from them began sealing the air.

Ning Zhu became trapped in this ocean of swords. A single movement might activate the trap and it wouldn’t end well for her.

“Die!” The prince pointed his sword forward and the sword rays went straight for her.

The attack was truly magnificent. The spectators felt as if space had been pierced a million times; they had the illusion that they were the victims of this attack.

“What an attack of the sword dao!” One youth shouted while trembling.

Ning Zhu didn’t bat an eye. Her sword let out a hymn and became resplendent with a green hue. It was as if she was holding a bamboo stick that exudes an incredible life force.

She finally swung her sword. It lacked malice and murder, only an endless life force.

“Boom!” The majestic power of life crushed the incoming sword rays into particles.

Though they were sharp, swift, and numerous, they couldn’t oppose the princess’ destructive swing.

Numbers didn’t matter when it came to the sword dao.

Everyone gasped after seeing this. Ning Zhu lacked a domineering aura yet her first attack was the embodiment of this word - far fiercer than the prince’s celestial rays.

“The princess is far stronger?” Many youths were in awe of her.

“No, they haven’t gone all out yet.” An older expert shook his head and said calmly.

“Your Highness, don’t hold back now.” Ning Zhu told her opponent.
