Chapter 5160: Almost Shedding Tears

“Boom!” Everyone felt as if the sky was being imprisoned by the black clouds. A suppression akin to an invisible hand reached for the two conquerors, enough to obliterate any ancient ancestor or dragon lord.

This power was beyond anything they had seen before. This pressure felt as if it came from the high heaven.

“An ancient emperor!” Ancient ancestors and dragon lords became alarmed.

The fused being could have contended against this force but alas, they have been separated and their power waned drastically.

They roared and channeled their chaos true energy to stop the black clouds only to suffer serious injuries.

“Clank!” Heavenly Sword Conqueror and Sacred Sword Monarch returned, activating their domain and aura once more. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The black clouds slowly dispersed and the sun returned.

“What an incredible emperor.” Everyone understood that someone else was here to support Heavenly Sword School.

“It’s all part of a plan.” Someone else took a deep breath.

“Now it’s truly hopeless.” One ancestor murmured.

“The emperor isn’t here for them, it’s to prevent or kill any reinforcement.” A top dragon lord said with a solemn expression.

Others agreed with him. This made it clear that Heaven Alliance was in charge, not Heavenly Sword School.

The plan was to capture the two conquerors on top of taking down anyone who dares to come to save them.

“Which emperor is it?” A few ancient ancestors looked up in the air.

Alas, the emperor was shrouded by the black clouds, not willing to reveal their identity.

“Fellow Daoists, as you can see, you’re not leaving this place without surrendering.” Heavenly Sword Conqueror repeated.

The situation became the same as before - the conquerors were unable to withstand the two suppressive domains.

After being separated forcefully by the Heaven’s Will, they couldn’t fuse in a short time. Now, they relied on their dao fruits to stay alive since their physical body couldn’t handle the pressure.

“I think it’s over.” Some prepared for the worst.

The majority of the crowd had a good impression of the conquerors, whether they be from The People or The Race. Their romance was viewed as a wondrous tale; everyone wanted them to live a good life together. Conversely, they also disliked Heavenly Sword for their action right now.

Some hoped that a powerful cultivator would come to save the duo. This couldn’t be the end of their story.

“Surrender, it’s now or never!” Sacred Sword Monarch thunderously roared.

“In your dreams. We will never bow to Heaven Alliance even if it means our corpses laying bare here.” Windchaser laughed.

“Have it your way then!” Heavenly Sword Conqueror lost patience and his six dao fruits became resplendent.

Sacred Sword Monarch’s nine sacred fruits erupted brightly as well.

The heightened intensity caused the two conquerors to spit out blood. Bones began breaking down, unable to sustain the constant pressure.

Nonetheless, they held each other’s hands with love in their eyes. They regretted nothing for they were still together during the last moment, evident by the smile on their face.

This drove some big shots into tears. They appreciated the love that they couldn’t obtain despite living for eras now. One could not ask for more in life.

“Don’t let it end like this, no, it can’t end like this…” Even an influential character from Heaven Alliance quietly prayed.

In the small courtyard, Li Qiye and Jun Landu played another match while the middle-aged man observed the battle.

The latter sighed, knowing that this was about to be the end for the two conquerors.

“Sigh, why am I so soft this generation?” Li Qiye sighed and said: “Always on the verge of shedding tears.”

With that, he picked up one piece and flicked it forward, sending it through all dimensions.

***

“Boom!” The sword domain and the holy aura immediately crumbled before the piece’s supreme power.

Heavenly Sword and Sacred Sword were lifted off their feet before staggering backward, unable to stabilize.

“Ugh…” Both spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Yes!!!” This unexpected development garnered cheers from the spectators.
