Chapter 4866: Northern Monarch

“My name is Li Qiye, the ruler of Eight-stallion Dynasty.” Li Qiye smiled and took her down a notch.

“Yo-you’re lying!” She turned red and raised her voice: “Are you an illegitimate bastard? Don’t come here and claim that this dynasty is yours. It belongs to Father’s.”

“Well, your father passed it down to me.” Li Qiye flicked the imperial seal hanging on his neck.

A’zhui pointed at him, trembling in rage, and said: “You must have shamelessly resorted to despicable means to trick my father!”

“Oh?” Li Qiye put on an exaggerated look of astonishment: “You’re telling me that your father is an idiot, that during his last moment, I somehow managed to trick him into giving me the imperial seal?”

“You!” A’zhui was furious: “That’s not what I meant, I’m talking about you being a sinister swindler!”

“Regardless of your intention, you are stating that your father was tricked. Oh the great dao lord praised by all was actually played by me, to pass down his dynasty to me. Seems like his reputation was undeserved…”

“...” A’zhui trembled with rage, unable to respond.

She was just a little girl who couldn’t keep up with Li Qiye.

“Guard Commander, this thief clearly stole the imperial seal from Father, why are you letting him stay here?” A’zhui focused on Firerage instead: “He should be imprisoned and interrogated!”

Firerage shook his head and said: “His Majesty was wise and insightful. The imperial seal represents his will. If he didn’t wish for it, no one could take the seal from him.”

“Anything is possible!” She didn’t give up.

“Your Highness, your scenario is not possible. His Majesty’s grand dao is supreme. We cannot speculate his intent.” Firerage shook his head again, clearly stating that no one was allowed to question Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s decision, not even his daughter.

A’zhui had seen magnificent scenes before but ultimately, she was still young and let her emotions get the best of her.

“Did you hear that?” Li Qiye didn’t show mercy and continued: “Your father passed the dynasty down to me instead of you, doesn’t that make something obvious? That he thought you are useless and incapable.”

“I-I’ll rip your tongue out!” A’zhu was driven mad.

“Then tell me, why did your father not pass the throne to you if you were actually capable?” Li Qiye asked.

Her eyes turned red as she couldn’t answer.

Firerage sighed after hearing this. Though Li Qiye’s words were unpleasant, they were indeed the truth. The problem was A’zhui being too young and weak. Giving her the throne would only be harming her.

“Slap his mouth!” She commanded her guards.

They exchanged glances. Some wanted to obey their master but didn’t move after seeing Firerage’ glare. Plus, Li Qiye was the actual successor so doing anything to him would be unacceptable, to say the least.

“Guard Commander, slap his mouth to make me feel better!” She shouted with indignation.

“Please return, Your Highness.” Firerage didn’t listen.

“... Guard Commander, Father didn’t mistreat you when he was alive.” She didn’t like his attitude.

He only sighed and didn’t bother to argue with a little girl.

“How disappointing, look at how stubborn and foolish you are. Looks like I have to teach you a lesson in your father’s stead.” Li Qiye said.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“You dare?!” She shouted but still took one step backward.

“Pat! Pat!” Li Qiye easily caught her and slapped her butt ten times or so without holding back.

Her guards wanted to stop him but Firerage kept them at bay.

“Oaa-” Tears poured down like the rain.

As the daughter of a dao lord, she has always been pampered and never suffered mistreatment before. Now, an unfamiliar brat was actually bullying her?

“I-I will kill you and your family!” She unsheathed her sword and lunged at Li Qiye like a lion cub.

“Stop!” A gust of wind coiled around her and pulled her back.

A royal lady wearing a golden dress came into the room. Just one glance was all it took to recognize her unmatched nobility.

Her creator was kind to her - oval face, long brows, bright purple eyes…

The imperial-styled dress was large but didn’t hide her curvy figure. People couldn’t help stealing glances at her.

Her aura was invisible yet palpable, capable of piercing unguarded cultivators in the blink of an eye. There was no doubt that she has been used to a position of power, seemingly excelling at that.

“Aunt!” A’zhui rushed over and embraced her, finally finding an ally.

The lady gently patted A’zhui’s hair and said softly: “You mustn’t act improperly and ruin His Majesty’s reputation.”

A’zhui actually listened to her. She sniffled a few more times and then stopped crying.

“Northern Monarch.” Firerage bowed once before holding the saber hilt again.

She ranked second in the dynasty right now. First was still Venerable Dragon God in the dao lord’s absence.

She was far younger than the dragon god and Monochromatic Master. Her duty was with maintaining the border and expanding territory.

She was a devil but that’s the extent of everyone’s knowledge. The dao lord brought her back and didn't tell anyone of her background.

Her exceptional talent allowed her to become a dragon lord with two dao fruits at a young age. Thus, Eight-stallion Dao Lord trusted her and gave her ample authority.
