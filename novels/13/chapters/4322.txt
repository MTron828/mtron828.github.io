Chapter 4323: Dragon Saintess

“Boom!” A great elephant appeared before them.

The troops alone were intimidating enough and put everyone to shame. This elephant was even more impressive, capable of changing the landscape just by moving. Its aura could be felt far ahead.

“...” The youths had a hard time keeping their composure while feeling this aura.

“The young lord has arrived, kneel three times and kowtow nine times.” Deer King shouted an order to the crowd.

Many got on their knees without hesitation but others didn’t feel the same way.

Three kneels and nine kowtows signified the highest ceremonial gesture. The former group was willing to do so because he was the young lord of Dragon. Not all felt the same way. They believed that this worship rite was reserved for their ancestors or supreme cultivators. They didn’t mind just kneeling and bowing; the full rite was just too much.

“What are you waiting for?!” Deer King’s expression soured.

If he could get all the small sects to do this, it would result in a magnificent spectacle. The young lord would love it so this was his chance to curry favor. Those who didn’t follow the order antagonized him.

“It is fine to keep it simple for the young lord’s arrival. No need to mobilize everyone, others will only laugh at us.” An elegant voice could be heard as a young woman appeared with a maid behind her.

Eyes lit up after her appearance. She wore a green dress and had a dual-bun hairstyle kept together by phoenix pins. She was as pure and transcendent as a lotus flower, capable of soaring above like a phoenix. Her voice was mysterious yet pleasant.

Her beauty was simplistic and timeless, having no need for thick makeup and jewelry.

The maid standing next to her was none other than Miss Ming who had backed Li Qiye up before.

“Saintess.” Deer King didn’t dare to be impudent so he bowed.

“Saintess?!” The audience took a deep breath.

“She’s the saintess of Dragon?” An old sect master whispered.

“That’s her, I didn’t expect to see her here.” An elder who had seen her before responded.

“Saintess.” The crowd bowed to greet her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“So she’s the one in the rumor, she’s been staying at the ward.” A clan master commented.

Most had no idea that she was already here and in charge of the ward. They assumed that Deer King and his peers had administrative responsibility for this conference. This has been the case for a while now - outer disciples being in charge.

However, she didn’t show herself so they didn’t know about her presence.

“Wait, so the saintess is that new sect master’s backer?” A youth became startled.

“Maybe.” A friend answered as she stared at Miss Ming.

“How did he manage that?” Another found this unfathomable.

“No wonder why he dared to kill Eight Tiger Demon. What’s so special about him?” One more became jealous.

The saintess was a prestigious character, only slightly inferior to the young lord of Dragon. Moreover, she appeared friendly on top of being a beauty. To be in her good grace was the greatest fortune, hence their jealousy towards the sect master of Little Diamond.

Gao Qixin was trying to climb up the young lord’s branch. Alas, the crowd preferred to be in Li Qiye’s shoes instead.

After the greeting ceremony, the front curtain of a white canopy placed on top of the elephant’s head was pulled to the side, revealing a sitting youth.

He looked spirited with lightning eyes. There were faint dragon roars around him. Something bulged out of his hair - obviously a dragon horn signifying his noble blood.

He was indeed a top genius. Alas, he paled when compared to his father - Peacock Monarch. The latter was a once-in-a-thousand years genius and has become a top cultivator in the current generation.

“I hope you’re doing well, Junior Sister Jian.” He smiled at the saintess.

They were martial brother-sister but weren’t from the same branch. The young lord’s cultivation came primarily from his father while the saintess, Jian Qingzhu, belonged to a major demon branch in Dragon.

In the present day, her seniors were weaker than the dominating Peacock Monarch. However, her lineage wasn’t inferior in the slightest.

An ancestor of hers was Sacred Luan, a great bird demon who eventually evolved into a phoenix. This played into her being the current saintess of Demon.

“It’s been a long trip, Senior Brother, please come in.” She slightly nodded and stuck to formality.

The young lord looked around and the crowd became frightened of his pulsing eyes. They immediately lowered their head, not daring to meet his gaze.

Both he and the saintess were untouchable existences due to their power and background. They had no choice but to be subservient and respectful, one step short of prostrating on the ground.

“Only a bunch of nobodies?” He lost his enthusiasm after surveying the crowd.

Today, he wanted to show the great powers his supreme style by taking over the conference. Alas, there were only tiny sects participating. The whole thing became pointless, akin to a dragon posturing before a bunch of ants.

Of course, none dared to challenge his contemptuous attitude. Offending him meant death and potentially sect destruction.

“You’re a little early, Senior Brother. Others will soon arrive.” She said.
