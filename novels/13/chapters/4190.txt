Chapter 4191: Finding Treasures

Delving deeper into the ocean made everyone realize how boundless it truly was. They saw amazing phenomena as well.

In one area, there was a skeleton resembling a dragon. Each bone was as large as a mountain. Standing on top of it was quite a stirring experience. Many years have passed and the divinity has dispersed from the bones. Nonetheless, they still had the color of white jade.

Another skeleton had collapsed into the bottom of the ocean. Nonetheless, its sharp bones still pointed straight at the sky as if they were spears flashing with a frightening pulse.

A whale-like skeleton had its skull looking straight up and its jaws wide open, wanting to devour the sky. Because of its sheer size, it affected the current and created a maelstrom.

Cultivators were ecstatic to see these massive skeletons. One of them ran over and shouted: “A primal beast! Its bones and core must be extremely precious.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Others felt the same way and started a treasure hunt. This wouldn’t be a bad haul at all even if they didn’t get any divine sword.

Unfortunately, this group couldn’t find anything. An experienced ancestor nearby shook his head: “These bones have been around for who knows how many years. The precious bones and cores were either taken by the currents or eaten by other beasts. Plus, visitors in preceding trips would have found them first.”

Listeners agreed with this and gave up. They thought that the previous waves of cultivators must have taken all the good things.

Only a few were lucky enough to spot divine swords here. Shortly after the big waves of arrival, news came about the death of a gigantic beast. The water there was dyed red from its blood.

“Poplar Paragon and the ancestors from Wooden Sword managed to kill a one-legged monster and took a lightning sword from its back.”

“Damn, looks like Wooden Sword should never be underestimated.” One ancestor took a deep breath and said: “I saw how powerful that monster was just two days ago. It devoured a group from Nine-wheel Citadel including five elders in the blink of an eye.”

“Poplar Paragon is taking up the mantle again after the death of Pineleaf Sword Lord. The kingdom seems to be on an upward trajectory.” An ancient ancestor said: “He’s indeed strong enough to do so, only the Five Overlords are stronger than him right now.”

In a different spot, cultivators ran over after seeing flashing sword rays. Alas, they disappeared once people got there. It turned out that an elder from Daoist Sword Ground managed to seize the sword before anyone else.

On the surface, a group led by several ancestors from Sea Emperor was chasing a six-winged solar dragon for ten million miles. The dragon lost the fight and had to flee.

Sure enough, information traveled about this fight a while later. “The ancestors of Sea Emperor killed a six-winged solar dragon and obtained three divine swords from its lair!”

This message stirred the crowd and made them more enthusiastic. Alas, the majority of divine swords were taken by the behemoths.

“What are we even doing here? Just useless spectators?” A member from a small sect said bitterly.

Those from small sects and even vagabonds appreciated their luck in being able to enter Sword Ocean. They wanted to obtain a divine sword in order to change their future for the better.

Unfortunately, it was easier said than done. Only the top sects had the ability to seize these swords.

“We have zero chance.” A vagabond became dejected: “Just be happy that we’re alive in this dangerous place. I saw the sect master and members of Flying Grass wanting to fight a lionfish. All of them were eaten, not a single soul got out.”

“More of us are dying too. Our group consisted of sixty-seven non-affiliated cultivators. We got ambushed by a nine-headed serpent, now, there are only six of us left.” A young cultivator who was covered in wounds said.

“Don’t be so pessimistic, cultivation is a path filled with dangers and glories. Very few make it through with a smile. It’s not like we haven’t gotten anything, I know of someone who got a divine sword.” An older vagabond said.

“How?” The young one didn’t believe him.

“It’s true, I saw a golden dragon giving him the sword. It’s an amazing one too, like one from a dragon god.” The old vagabond replied.

“That sounds like a fantasy, you’re lying.” The majority of the group didn’t believe him.

“He’s not lying, I saw it too. That golden dragon had an auspicious aura and a visual phenomenon consisting of countless swords.” A prodigy interjected.

“It’s not unprecedented. Rumor has it that Violet Abyss Dao Lord was given a heavenly sword by a spirit fish in this ocean.” A relatively successful vagabond added.

“Yes, something similar happened to a genius from Nine-wheel Citadel too, a sword from an aquatic elephant.” Another old man nodded.

“Where is the kid then?” A few cultivators’ eyes flashed with greed.

Trying to rob the behemoths was courting death. However, a vagabond? That shouldn’t be a problem.

“Don’t be stupid.” An old vagabond shook her head: “The guy left long ago. Plus, the fact that he got a sword from a golden dragon means that his future is limitless, someone blessed by heaven. If you try to rob him, he’ll come back one day for revenge and exterminate your clan.”

“No, I was just curious, haha, that’s all.” The others smiled awkwardly after being figured out.

Everyone paid attention to the stories about the divine swords. Only Li Qiye didn’t care since he had a destination in mind.

There was a sinkhole in Sword Ocean - deep and bottomless. It was surrounded by water yet none could get in, not even a single drop.

It seemed that a powerful force separated it from the outside world.

Cultivators came and became quite interested in this weird phenomenon.

“There has to be a divine sword in there.” One youth wanted to enter.

“This is the eye of the sea, a rather famous place. You can go in if you’re tired of living.” A senior snorted.

“Is it that bad?” The youth asked.

“There is no returning.” The senior answered: “No one has returned alive in history, whether it be peerless geniuses or invincible ancestors.

“I see…” The youth took a deep breath.
