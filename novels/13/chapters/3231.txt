Li Qiye’s suggestion could have earth-shattering consequences. The trio became austere.

“I don’t think winning will be easy.” Emperor Xi mused.

He put it as nicely as possible instead of saying that Li Qiye wouldn’t be able to put up a fight. Though they haven’t seen this world, they had a pretty good idea after the first three invaders.

They would definitely not be able to return after a trip there. Of course, they knew that he was quite strong, stronger than any of them. Alas, the consequences would still be grave.

“Not easy indeed.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Just going to kill a few, I don’t plan on winning completely. It’s impossible to do so by just fighting randomly. Plus, it’s a good training session.”

The trio smiled wryly after hearing this. He spoke as if they were just common battles. This was far from the case. They would be awfully destructive and perilous, worse than any other wars.

“You still have more potential than us.” Emperor Sui pondered for a bit before suggesting: “Why not cultivate some more? Perhaps you’ll be able to cross through the final gap and become a true immortal. That’ll guarantee your victory.”

The group had a high evaluation of Li Qiye. His potential was the highest they have seen. If becoming a true immortal was possible, he should be the first one to reach it.

“They don’t exist for sure. Here, Three Immortals can’t gestate or accommodate one. Just imagine the price.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The three furrowed their brows, contemplating.

They all believed that true immortals didn’t exist. They weren’t true immortals despite their titles. Others incorrectly chose to call them this.

Perhaps they were true immortals in the eyes of regular people, but they knew that there was a long way to go before reaching this level. Moreover, there was no established method for them to reference.

“That’s why it is only a legend. I’m sure even in the case that it is possible, you guys won’t want to see the trade-off anyway.” Li Qiye chuckled.

The three started thinking about this issue.

“Your world is blessed with fortune, able to escape through many epochs. Will this continue on in the future?” He then asked.

“We know but we don’t have the same courage like you to walk on this path.” Emperor Nong sighed in response.

“I disagree, it’s because you three have things tying you down.” Li Qiye said: “We’re humans first before we’re cultivators, right? Otherwise, we’re no different than them.”

“You are correct.” Emperor Xi nodded and said softly: “Opening this rift is not out of the question but please consider. I don’t think you’ll be able to return.”

He put it as nicely as possible. Li Qiye’s result should be a miserable death in that unknown world. He had no reinforcement on top of knowing nothing about it.

“Well, I’ll kill until either I’m dead or there is nothing left. A death like that will still be worth it.” Li Qiye let out a burst of heroic laughter, treating this matter with a carefree mindset. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The three respected his decisiveness since they couldn’t do the same thing due to certain scruples.

“Looks like we’ll have a lot to prepare.” Emperor Xi said with a solemn expression.

“Yes, the calamity will come so do your best. The three thousand worlds will change, let’s hope that the new world will be better.” Li Qiye nodded.

Li Qiye had decided to fight and made ample preparations. He also readied his mindset because the consequences might be unfavorable, to say the least.

“You’re right, let’s get started then.” They no longer hesitated, deciding to fully support Li Qiye with their resources.

As Li Qiye said, Three Immortals have been exposed. The top existences would never stop trying to come back here. Another rift would mean the end of Three Immortals and they wouldn’t be able to stop it.

That’s why Li Qiye’s current goal was actually a great method. He might not be able to win the whole thing but given his abilities, he should be able to kill many of them.

The trio had plenty of resources after living for so many years. This was a great help for Li Qiye. Now his own treasuries filled with the materials from several redemption grounds have resulted in something incredible.

As Li Qiye and the trio were preparing for the attack, the rest of the world enjoyed peace.

The top masters in the expanse found this quite strange. There was no news of Li Qiye after visiting the three immortals so speculations arose.

“Another cultivation session, maybe? In order to become an immortal.” One progenitor said.

“Maybe he’s already an immortal and wants to take the next step, becoming a golden immortal.” Another master said.

Of course, golden immortals were only mentioned in the mortals’ stories and tales. No such level existed as far as they know.

“What is he actually doing? He’s already powerful beyond imagination.” Others simply didn’t know. They believed that he was already at the apex of cultivation. There was no getting stronger.

This particular thought was understandable. In the past, they thought that the dark existences were at the top but Li Qiye still easily killed them. How could there be something above him?

Most importantly, he was unbeatable in this world. Perhaps the three immortals together still couldn’t take him on. Therefore, he was at the ultimate limit of this world.

Of course, a few progenitors knew about Li Qiye’s higher pursuit, that he wouldn’t just stop here.

This peace was only a prelude before his next shocking move. A terrible storm brewed on the horizon.

Those in the deep crevices of redemption grounds started gazing at the azure. They seemed to notice a few things.

“It has been too long.” An ethereal voice sounded. It could only be heard and understood by the selected few.

“Perhaps someone is finally able to take the next step. This is an opportunity.” Another sighed.

“A chance to break the balance. Which side will the scale lean on?” One more from a redemption ground spoke.

They understood that the incoming battle carried great significance. All three thousand worlds would change regardless of the victor.

“It won’t be inferior to that past war.” Another person lamented.
