Chapter 4423: Swift Slash

“Start, I’ll only need one swing to behead you three.” Li Qiye ignored their rage and nonchalantly said.

“One swing?!” The three elders became livid. Their anger exploded like erupting volcanoes.

“Did I hear that right?” The audience felt that he was being too unreasonable.

The elders couldn’t compare to the ancestors currently present. However, they were still famous cultivators, far stronger than the young generation.

Li Qiye’s statement could only be construed as ignorant arrogance.

“His ignorance is nauseating!” A member of the east shouted.

“Is it possible? No way.” One cultivator answered his own question.

“Right, Five-sun is a great power. Their three elders should be capable enough. It’s impossible for him to decapitate them with one swing.”

Ancient Peasant and Ancient Lion exchanged glances. Ancient Treant also observed the development carefully.

The three elders could endure this contempt no longer. It had nothing to do with their personality or temperament. Anyone would be infuriated after hearing this.

“We swear to obliterate you today!” One of them roared.

“I’m afraid you lack the ability.” Li Qiye said then playfully flicked his saber.

The elders gritted their teeth and decided to make their move.

“Boom!” One of them raised a fiery cauldron. The flame billowed in the shape of a primal beast licking its tongue, ready to devour Li Qiye to pieces.

Another elder waved his hand and summoned a black gale consisting of countless sharp fragments. Their targets were none other than Li Qiye’s internal organs.

The final elder spread his fingers and then summoned a black bowl with murderous intent. Millions of spirits seemed to be wailing in there after being sucked in by the bowl. They have been tormented for countless years, unable to enter the reincarnation cycle.

“Devouring Pot, Drill Gauntlet, and Soulcrush Bowl!” Many from the east recognized these treasures.

“They’re not holding back, these are ferocious treasures!” The weak-hearted trembled after seeing the elders in action.

They clearly despised Li Qiye and wanted nothing more than to annihilate him. Thus, even though they were from a prestigious sect, they still attacked mercilessly.

“Die!” They no longer cared about appearances right now.

“Boom!” Fiery flames poured down like serpents, ready to lacerate and burn his flesh. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The second elder sent the fragmental gale towards Li Qiye, wanting to destroy his bones and organs.

The third used his bowl in an attempt to seize Li Qiye’s soul and torture it for an eternity.

“They’re not holding back at all!” One youth felt his legs trembling.

“That’s more like it-” One expert sneered but he couldn’t finish his sentence.

As spectators waited to see Li Qiye’s defense, all they saw was a bright flash.

Time came to a halt as this light crossed through space and time. They felt themselves being completely sealed. The single slash settled everything, capable of determining life and death.

Once they regained their wits, they saw three heads flying into the air.

“Pluff!” Three streams of blood gushed out like the spring before blossoming like flowers.

The three elders couldn’t believe it. Alas, they also saw their headless body and blood gushing out. Once their head rolled on the ground, their body also fell down.

They wanted to try and roll back to their body but this was naturally impossible. A few seconds later, they closed their eyes after their lifespan came to full depletion.

From start to finish, they never saw how Li Qiye decapitated them. They had never seen such a quick draw despite their battle experience.

There was no technique and energy - only pure speed. Even lightning seemed as slow as a snail in comparison. Its speed could travel across ten thousand years in the blink of an eye.

Once fast enough, a slash could overwhelm the mysteries of the grand dao and the greatest treasures.

This rendered the crowd speechless. Even the three ancient demons gasped with narrowed eyes, aware that they couldn’t have been able to stop it.
