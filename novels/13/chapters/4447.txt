Chapter 4448: True Invincibility

“Poof!” A phoenix manifested into reality, looking wondrous and dignified while soaring in the air.

It spread its wings and released a sky-blotting inferno, capable of refining yin and yang along with the myriad dao.

The aura of a phoenix engulfed the valley. All living beings trembled before this apex creature.

Though the demon god was hiding behind Li Qiye and activated his nine tails, his barriers were melting and couldn’t be rebuilt. It seemed that the flame of a phoenix made recovery impossible.

The worst part was - the demon felt an instinctive urge to prostrate, akin to peasants seeing the emperor for the first time.

He activated his vitality and true chaos energy in order to suppress this primal urge. It had nothing to do with his power, just his background as a demon.

A phoenix was divine and loomed above all demons. The bloodline of the fox, albeit prestigious and high level, was still not enough to contend against the phoenix bloodline.

“Boom!” The second power suddenly took over his mind and immobilized him. He felt an invisible power gripping his throat, intending on crushing him to a pulp.

He couldn’t breathe - this was a fear he had forgotten. Fortunately, Li Qiye finally took action and stopped it.

The phoenix power alone was horrifying. Nonetheless, it was direct so he could come up with a plan to stop it. On the other hand, that mental attack was impossible to assess. Once he realized that it was there, he had already became helpless.

“Raa!” The shadow of a strange hybrid crossed through the sky. Its power was invisible yet fatal.

Li Qiye retaliated by becoming resplendent. He raised his hand and appeared to be the only immortal in existence.

All dao and affinities circled around the tip of his finger and were subjected to his rule.

“Back off.” He waved his hand and exerted his dominance.

The demon trembled in horror since he felt severed from his grand dao. Li Qiye seemingly took over his own power.

“Boom! Boom!” Li Qiye’s targets were the phoenix and the mysterious shadow. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The two immediately retreated; their power also disappeared from sight.

The demon god heaved a sigh of relief. Alas, this was a little too early.

“Boom!” A cataclysmic force came next. He looked up and saw the stars in the sky exploding into pieces.

The attack this time reigned above all else, containing a might capable of sweeping through everything. He was but a speck of dust before it.

“Fuc-” He bellowed in horror because this was helpless.

A while ago, his nine-tail defense could last for a long time against the attack of the phoenix or even the mysterious power, as long as he was ready for it.

However, his barriers collapsed in the blink of an eye, akin to an ember being extinguished by a tornado.

It seemed that the reason why Li Qiye told him to stand back was because of this attack, not the ones prior.

“What is this…” He thought that he was witnessing the strongest force in existence - true invincibility.

He once believed that he could last five moves even against the strongest cultivator. This was rather erroneous.

“Boom!” His protector, Li Qiye, chose to stop the attack with his body instead of turning resplendent like before. It immediately engulfed him.

“Shit!” He bellowed because peerless weapons wouldn’t be able to stop this attack, let alone the flesh.

He was scared out of his mind but in the next second, he found the invincible power nullified.

This resembled a reef at the bottom of an ocean. It could withstand the waves forever without being swept away.

Peace returned with haste to his astonishment. The roaring storm subsided without warning and the ocean became calm again.

As he stood there in a daze, Li Qiye gently pushed forward and the unknown power receded like the tides. If he didn’t witness this in person, he wouldn’t believe it.
