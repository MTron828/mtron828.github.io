Chapter 3637: TeaChapter You One Move

While inside the temple, Yang Ling stared at Fan Bai with curious flashes in her eyes. She asked: “How did you do it? It has to be magic, right? Just one hand wave and you defeated those three. I think only First Sister can do it out of all the students right now.”

“Just like this.” Fan Bai waved her hand. She didn’t have a good grasp on her own power.

“Like that?” Yang Ling copied Fan Bai’s action. In reality, she has seen this numerous times before and was relatively familiar.

Alas, she tried and tried but nothing happened. On the other hand, Fan Bai could instantly control a majestic Buddhist power to eliminate her foes.

“There must be something I’m missing.” Yang Ling concluded. This movement looked extremely simple and useless in battle. Even a weaker foe would easily strike her down if she were to do something like this.

“I don’t know.” Fan Bai shook her head. She didn’t know the innate mysteries right now because she hasn’t reached the right height. Once at that level, she would have full mastery over it.

Li Qiye told the old servant that she would be able to stand at the apex. Understanding this power was essential.

“Mmm, Young Master, what is this peerless merit law?” Yang Ling had no choice but to ask Li Qiye.

“Buddha Bowing, it’s useless to tell you anyway since you don’t know.” Li Qiye flatly responded.

“Young Master, how about teaching me? Just a little bit is okay.” Her eyes turned bright as she smiled. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“It’s not suitable for you, I can try and you still won’t be able to learn it. Everyone has a suitable merit law. That combined with perseverance is the only way to reach the apex.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“Then what do you think is a suitable merit law for me?” Yang Ling was smart enough to go down this route while acting cute with her eyes.

“How do I know?” Li Qiye chuckled and ignored her request.

“Young Master, just teach me one or two merit laws?” She was also thick-skinned today and started acting coquettish: “No, even half a technique is fine, Young Master.”

She realized that this could be a great opportunity, especially today due to the current mood.

“Fine, I guess this is fate.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “How about Sword Point?”

“Sword Point?” Yang Ling became excited: “Are you talking about the technique left behind by Sword Emperor on Comprehension Peak?”

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded.

“You actually understood this?” Yang Ling was startled at first but then again, she thought that this wasn’t strange. Li Qiye had a penchant for surprising people.

“What about the technique left behind by Duality Master?” Yang Ling became curious.

Li Qiye smiled without responding.

“You understood that too?!” This time, she was truly astonished. Anyone else wouldn’t believe Li Qiye but she had absolute confidence in him.

“Young Master, can I learn that technique then?” She composed herself and blinked cutely.

“Hmm...” Li Qiye stared at her.

“Please, Young Master, I will work hard, harder than ever before, a hundred times harder.” She hurriedly convinced him.

“Seems like you’re smarter than you appear.” Li Qiye shook his head and said: “Fine, I’ll teach you Duality Master’s technique, Palm Spread.”

“Yes!” Yang Ling shouted excitedly after hearing this.

“Why do you want to learn this instead of Sword Point?” Li Qiye asked.

“Because Duality Master’s technique is unique. No one has been able to understand it or cultivate it.” Yang Ling revealed her thoughts: “This isn’t the case for Sword Emperor’s technique. He has plenty of descendants so this technique must have been learned by countless people in history. It lacks the same cool distinction.”

“Go, come at the right time tomorrow to train.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Yang Ling cheered and ran out of the temple.

The old servant watched her leave with a rare smile on his face. He said: “The girl isn’t a bad person. She just has a shallow perspective.”

Yang Ling didn’t know that she had given up on the better opportunity in Sword Point versus Duality Master’s technique.

“Everyone has their own fortune.” Li Qiye said: “Two sides to everything, good and bad. A sharp sword is a great weapon but it can also easily cut the user. Palm Spread to gather the ocean is a stable merit law, good for mental tranquility. Of course, if she were to go far enough, Sword Point would have been more suitable. She’ll be able to make a name for herself with regard to the sword dao. Unfortunately, this dao has a sharp sword and a cold heart, not necessarily a good thing.”

“True.” The old servant nodded: “All paths are different. There have been plenty of masters in history but none can truly claim perfection.”

“A heart without regret is a type of perfection, something worth cultivating. Being number one at cultivation doesn’t equate a perfect dao.” Li Qiye replied.

The old servant paused for a moment before nodding his head, agreeing with the comment. He then took his leave to perform his duties.

***

On the next day, the old man came to visit again. He was more respectful and nervous this time while standing before Li Qiye.

He brought a long list and handed it to Li Qiye: “Young Master, these are all the ores and metals in our reserve, do you need any of them?”

The long list contained extremely precious metals and ores. Some were coveted by all. Just this list alone was indicative of Duality’s immense foundation and resources, no need to even bring up the treasures and artifacts.

Li Qiye took a gander at the list before glancing at the old man: “There are a lot of decent items but as for the real good stuff? Looks like their number is diminishing.”

“We descendants are unfilial.” The old man smiled wryly: “The reserve and treasuries have been increasing in size, just not anything truly valuable.”

There was a reason for this. The academy might have produced plenty of dao lords and sovereigns but they eventually created their own sects. They left behind gifts to pay the academy back but certainly not their best items.

“There are a few decent ones, just not suitable for me, it’s a shame.” Li Qiye shook his head and returned the list to the old man.

“I apologize for my uselessness.” The old man accepted the list and told Li Qiye: “I think two places might have what you’re looking for.”

“Oh? Go on.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“You certainly have heard of the first place.” The old man said: “Sacred Mountain.” He stopped here without elaborating.

“I know what you’re trying to say.” Li Qiye shook his head: “It’s not hard for me to go up there, it’s just that I don’t want to bother with the long trip.”

The old man thought that it was strange but didn’t pursue the issue.

“The other place is closer to Duality, Wish Ward.” The old man continued: “It’s the biggest market in the holy ground, might be all of southern West King too. You might be able to find what you need there. If not, they’ll be able to help you procure the items.”

He paused for a bit before finishing: “I heard that some top-level artifacts are there right now, many big shots will be coming to take a look. You should too, Young Master.”

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Would you like me to go make preparation?” He asked.

“No need, I can go take a look myself.” Li Qiye waved his hand.
