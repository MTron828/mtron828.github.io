Chapter 5362: Ninety-nine-foot Sacred Tree

“I shall begin now.” Myriad Eye warned his opponent.

None expected him to be so cordial and polite, sounding like a mortal scholar. After all, he still had a demonic aura that he couldn’t shed despite becoming a dao lord.

“Open all your eyes.” Ferocity laughed.

“So be it.” Myriad Eye didn’t waste time and activated all of his eyes, forcing weaker cultivators to do the opposite.

“Boom!” The rays from his eyes intertwined together instead of shooting Ferocity directly.

Everyone felt absolute chaos in the world - even the karmic forces lost their balance. It became impossible to tell left from right. Everyone became lost in time and space; fate was no longer in charge.

“Chaos Vision!” The dragon lords became alarmed after seeing the dao lord’s favorite technique.

Ferocity retaliated by releasing all twelve of his sacred fruits. They formed a domain with boundless sacred light capable of purifying all affinities in existence. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Within this domain was a ninety-nine-foot-long tree - the source of the sacred light. Its presence allowed for one to find anima and everlasting life.

“A sacred anima tree!” Everyone bellowed after seeing it.

“He found anima!” They were astounded to see his true cultivation - no wonder he was able to fight Supreme in the past.

The sacred tree prevented Chaos Vision from affecting Ferocity, allowing him to counterattack.

“Eat this!” He laughed and formed a dao seal consisting of countless laws.

The ocean of force engulfed Myriad Eye and displayed the potential of a dragon lord. This cultivation path was still competitive versus the imperial ones.

Dragon lords in the audience couldn’t help feeling proud and excited while watching the fight. In history, dragon lords have been the underdogs compared to dao lords and conquerors.

With the emergence of Supreme recently, their path was finally taken seriously.

Alas, Supreme rarely battled after becoming the guardian of Heaven Alliance. Thus, the world didn’t have the privilege of watching a mighty dragon lord in action.

Now, Ferocity didn’t seem to be inferior to Myriad Eye Dao Lord in the slightest and won many fans in the process. Dragon lords felt as if they were on the battle stage themselves, living vicariously through him.

“Boom!” A fierce battle ensued between them.

Meanwhile, Lightgrasp and Five-sun continued their fight and did not hold back.

The sheer destruction of the two battles left everyone in horror. Some were suppressed on the ground, unable to move an inch.

Although the four were preoccupied, others didn’t have the power to seize the dreamwater.

“Will anyone else come?” Big shots wondered about the eventual outcome and could hear their heart thumping faster.

To seize the dreamwater now meant risking being surrounded by all four. That would be a rather unfavorable situation.

Sure enough, another figure climbed the tree with extreme speed and appeared on the ninth leaf.

“Clank!” She sent a divine chain forward, piercing through the suppression of the tree and reaching the pinnacle for the dreamwater.

“Look!” All eyes were on her. Even the four combatants stopped to take a look.

They came for the dreamwater and had no feud with each other. Therefore, they leaped backward and gazed at the newcomer.

“Jue Xian’er!” Everyone recognized her instantly.
