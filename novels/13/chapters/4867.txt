Chapter 4868: Maddened

Devilization was an exceedingly rare bloodline. This became truer after the calamity.

Moreover, the devils were no longer the same. They were once competitive with the heaveners and diviners; now, they were mere shells of their former selves.

Few in the world knew about this special bloodline. Alas, Li Qiye could tell at a glance.

“Your Highness, how do you know this?” She took a deep breath and asked.

“I’m an avid reader.” He leaned back on his chair and took another sip with a smirk.

She smiled wryly after hearing this. If reading could make someone omniscient, life would be far simpler.

She paused for a bit before continuing: “I was ordered to visit the academy before His Majesty’s duel.”

The academy didn’t have any other name. However, in the lower continents, everyone knew what this was referring to.

Academy, a part of the Hundred Races - it was even rumored to be the leader of this lineage.

In Chaos, numerous sects and kingdoms fell in history. However, the academy remained standing. The villains here didn’t dare to provoke it.

“I asked the academy for help since trouble will come.” She said.

The dao lord knew that his death would mean chaos for the realm, hence his command.

“But they refused.” Li Qiye smiled after seeing her expression.

“The academy only teaches the dao and answers cultivation questions, they do not interfere with other matters.” She took another sip.

In reality, this was already expected. She didn’t have that much hope before coming there.

“The dynasty is in trouble.” She added.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t comment.

“His Majesty once brought order to Chaos. Though he couldn’t fully stabilize the continent, the villains stopped acting so audaciously. His death meant an end to the temporary peace.” She had a sorrowful expression.

She couldn’t do anything to help him in battle. Now, it was her time to protect the dynasty.

“As for Primal, it cannot do anything in its current state.” She explained.

Primal Lineage once led Chaos. Unfortunately, it declined after the departure of Eternal Conqueror. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Maddened Lineage is, unsurprisingly, crazy. It has plenty of experts but they only contribute to the chaos. Nonetheless, it is not out of malice.” She went on.

“Maddened is insanity to the point of self-immolation, that is its dao.” Li Qiye smiled.

The cultivator known as Maddened was nothing short of a miraculous existence and started a dao lineage. Plenty of conquerors wanted to destroy it to no avail.

The most frightening thing about Maddened - the cultivator - was his cultivation. He was neither a dao lord nor a dragon lord.

Rumor has it that he suddenly became crazy after a certain point of cultivation and incinerated six dao lords and emperors. He left a void in Celestial Court - one that could never be repaired.

This dao was rather strange. Training was not necessary. One just needed to be in the special fire domain to gain the chance of becoming a top cultivator.

As for the originator himself, there were many legends regarding the start of this dao. One stood out above the rest.

It stated that during his youth, Maddened was a servant whose task was to light the fires for the stoves in the kitchen.

He was bullied and even burned by candles at times, resulting in a deep grudge. The strong feelings resonated with his dao heart and soul. Something incredible happened then - one of the Nine Heavenly Scriptures manifested into reality - One Heart.

At the initial stage of his new cultivation, he incinerated all of his bullies along with the entire sect. An area of ten thousand miles became scorched earth.

Henceforth, he became a terrifying monster in the six continents. His lineage added to the disorder of Chaos.

Those who try to cultivate in the fire domain couldn’t maintain their sanity. Only a few could do so. Four of the Ten Monsters came from Maddened.

However, they weren’t a real threat to Eight-stallion Dynasty since they didn’t have an ambition for conquest.

“Do you have a good grasp on Maddened as well?” Northern Monarch asked.

“I haven’t been there, I merely felt it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Felt it?” She didn’t expect this response since the distance between Maddened and the dynasty was immeasurable. Not even Eight-stallion Dao Lord could do so given the gap.

“And Demon?” Li Qiye smiled.

She calmed down and said: “Their six demon gods might be the strongest force in the lower continents. However, they do not venture out of the Ten Desolate Mountains. The sole exception is Wild Dragon.”

The ten mountains of Demon were endless in size, allowing the demons to prosper. The demon gods and monarchs there didn’t like leaving their domain. Only Wild Dragon chose differently.

“So the enemies are clear.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, His Majesty managed to lock onto them and dealt with any potential problem. There are still plenty of evil cultivators and sects in Chaos but they aren’t real threats.”

“There is only one.” Li Qiye said.

“Wild Dynasty.” She nodded.

Eight-stallion and Wild were the two strongest sects in Chaos.

Primal has declined, Maddened was unreliable, and Demon stuck to their own land. Lastly, Hundred Races remained divided.

Eight-stallion was part of Hundred Races and was eligible to lead Chaos. As for Wild Dynasty, its leader was Wild Dragon from Demon. He built his lineage in Hundred Races, wanting their recognition. He went as far as going to the academy to study. Alas, it still didn’t recognize Wild Dynasty.

Nonetheless, Wild considered itself to be part of Hundred Races. It played the role of a safe haven for villains.

Eight-stallion Dao Lord had sent expeditions several times to no avail. Wild Dragon was wily. The moment he noticed something strange, he would run back to Demon.
