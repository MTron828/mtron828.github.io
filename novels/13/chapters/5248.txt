Chapter 5249: Try Your Own Fruit

Instead of arrows, the toy-like bows were drawn with dao strings. Once pulled to the limit, these dao strings became extremely sharp and brimmed with power.

Just looking at them made the audience feel as if their body was about to be pierced into a sieve.

“Twisted-shot General.” Others recognized him.

“Try to block my shot?” Twisted-shot shouted.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Despite being enemies, he didn’t resort to an ambush. Thus, he announced his attack first.

“Why not?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Perish!” Twisted-shot immediately released all of the dao strings.

They pierced through space and left behind tiny holes in the physical fabric of reality. Moreover, they flew in an unpredictable manner, zigzagging randomly while still maintaining a clear destination - Li Qiye’s weak spots.

When the dao strings got close enough, they suddenly became infinitely slow and drilled into another dimension. This made it impossible to block them in a conventional manner. They appeared again in another spot and aimed for a different target on Li Qiye’s body.

Li Qiye didn’t mind because the gauntlet took a comprehensive approach by spreading out and covering him entirely in armor plates.

The dao strings were certainly unblockable but ultimately, they still had to hit Li Qiye in order to deal damage. Alas, the complete barrier rendered them useless.

This wasn’t due to the general lacking power. In fact, that barrage just now was enough to reduce even sacred fruits into bits. It’s just that the armor plates surrounding Li Qiye were unbreakable.

“What kind of metal is this?” The general stopped shooting and became startled.

Once he slowed down, people could see that the dao strings were actually made from sticky mucus oozing out of his body. He used a special method to condense and imbue them with the dao. This gave him the ability to injure even Suppression Conqueror while the latter was in full battle regalia. In this case, he didn’t see a single mark on Li Qiye’s plate.

“My turn, take this!” A different general landed in front of Li Qiye.

This was a large frog with a tree growing on its back. On the branches were trees of various colors.

“Treasure-fruit General!” Someone shouted his title.

He took down a black fruit and threw it at Li Qiye. Normally, a fruit thrown couldn’t even kill a child. However, the audience including Li Zhitian’s group became serious.

“A cursed fruit.” Many cultivators shuddered.

This frog was a strange existence born with a tree capable of producing fruits of various powers. The black one had an embedded curse and was feared by all.

“Pop!” The fruit exploded and covered the armor plates with a black, sticky liquid. It attached to the armor and squirmed like countless worms.

Impressively enough, it managed to infiltrate the armor plates that were completely untouched by the arrow barrage earlier.

“Zzz.” After finding an apparent gap, it drilled into the armor and disappeared from sight.

“He’s cursed now!” A spectator shouted.

The best way to deal with the fruit was to prevent it from exploding and releasing the black liquid. Its offensive potential included drilling into the body and even the true fate. Merit laws seemed useless against it.

“You can’t stop this.” Treasure-fruit was ecstatic to see the infiltration.

However, the armor plates suddenly receded and turned into a gauntlet again. Its rays resumed again and forced the black liquid out while still trapping it.

“What…” Treasure-fruit was left speechless after seeing this.

“Are you feeling cold?” Li Qiye smiled and reached forward.

Treasure-fruit understood that it was time to run and instantly retreated. Alas, he was still hit by the flames carrying the cursed liquid.

It still had the same property as before - always hunting the target.

“Poof!” Sure enough, his evasive maneuvers finally failed and he became engulfed in flames.

The other generals immediately ran over and helped him extinguish the flames. Although he managed to stay alive, he was burned from top to bottom and smelled like a roasted frog.
