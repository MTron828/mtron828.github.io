Chapter 4290: Poor

The majority of the disciples were weak, still stuck in the first four realms - Mortal Shell, Iron Skin, Bronze Tendon, and Silver Carapace.

In larger sects and kingdoms, new disciples would pass through these realms in a matter of two or three years.

In Little Diamond, the Conqueror Vessel realm was considered the top already for the young generation. Thus, the first elder being at the yin yang realm was virtually untouchable - a supreme existence in the youths’ eyes.

Li Qiye didn’t comment on their weak cultivation and accepted their bow.

After the ceremony, Elder Hu gave him a tour of the sect. After all, the new sect master was qualified to know the in and out of his new domain.

In reality, they only had a territory spanning one hundred miles or so. There wasn't that much of note - only regular terrains, no special grounds and ore mines.

Perhaps its impoverished state played a large part in its longevity. If it had any resources, other sects would have attacked long ago.

In this case, the stronger sects didn’t want to waste time conquering it. It would only require more manpower and resources to occupy.

During its glory days, it was far stronger and had plenty of lands, going as far as being superior to most dao lord lineages. Later on, it became weaker and lost control.

Eventually, Elder Hu led Li Qiye to the ancestral peak - one of the most important locations. It served as the home for the sect’s treasures and merit laws.

There was a statue of their patriarch on this peak, depicting him as a middle-aged man with incredible divinity and prestige - clearly a big shot during his era.

There were two ancient characters carved at the base. No one in the sect could read them.

“Here is our patriarch.” Elder Hu elaborated: “A grand-completion immortal physique master, impervious to swords and sabers, none in the world could injure him back then. Others referred to him as Diamond Long.”

“I see.” Li Qiye chuckled. He also recognized the two characters at the base - Zuntian.

He had an impression of this person; they had absolutely met before.

“Fate indeed.” He murmured. To think that he could come across the sect of an acquaintance from so long ago. Of course, the ties were gone now.

He didn’t say anything else as Elder Hu took him to see the treasury. Well, it would be more accurate to call this a storeroom. It was only guarded by a few exceptional disciples.

The treasures and merit laws were stored in the same room. To be blunt, no treasures here could fetch a decent price. Once sold, they could only let the disciples live a humble life.

“The merit laws are all here, feel free to take a look, Sect Master.” Elder Hu introduced the scrolls on a wooden rack.

Little Diamond was too small to have rules and regulations regarding access to its merit laws. Some dao lord lineages had heaven-defying and secret merit laws; even the sect masters weren’t qualified to see them.

This wasn’t the case here. Li Qiye took a look and saw how simple and common they were. Some could actually be purchased from street vendors.

“Our patriarch had an immortal physique law before but for some reason, it was never passed down. Our sect once had sacred physique laws and several heaven-level laws, but they’re all gone now.” Elder Hu had a sad expression.

They wanted powerful merit laws as well. Alas, they haven’t produced any disciple at the Myriad-dao level for a long time now. Top merit laws could be purchased but they were too poor to do so.

This was the reason why the previous sect master lost his life over the physique merit law.

“You have one now.” Li Qiye smiled and placed that scroll on the rack.

“Sect Master…” Elder Hu became emotional.

“Am I not the sect master of Little Diamond? Now it belongs to the sect.” Li Qiye said.

“Your generosity puts me to shame.” Elder Hu prostrated right away. It would have been perfectly acceptable for Li Qiye to cultivate that physique law alone. He had both the right and authority to do so.

However, he decided to share it with the rest of the sect. Such generosity moved the elder to tears. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“We are so fortunate to be under your leadership.” Elder Hu said.

“No need to be so happy, I can’t be your sect master for long.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“...” Elder Hu didn’t know how to respond.

“Take me to see the other elders.” Li Qiye said since he wasn’t interested in this treasury.

Elder Hu arranged another meeting in the main hall. This time around, Li Qiye sat in the main chair.

The atmosphere was slightly awkward since Li Qiye was a stranger. No one had talked to him previously outside of Elder Hu.

“What is your plan?” Li Qiye stared at them and asked.

The five elders exchanged glances, not knowing how to answer right away.

Eventually, the first elder spoke: “We follow your command, Sect Master.”

The other four were astounded after listening to Elder Hu telling them about Li Qiye’s generosity. This made it apparent that Li Qiye didn’t want anything from their sect. After all, that scroll alone was countless times more valuable than all of Little Diamond.

“What is your goal then? To revitalize the sect or improve your own cultivation?” Li Qiye smiled.

They haven’t thought of this before. For the first elder, he knew that this was the end of the road for him. There was no way of breaking through to the next realm.

This had nothing to do with a lack of confidence. He had a good grasp on his own talent and the lack of resources.

Not long ago, the sect used all of its resources and still couldn’t get the previous sect master to reach the next realm.
