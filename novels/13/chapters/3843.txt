Chapter 3844: Observing The Heaven

The spectators solely focused on the crystal ball made of water. It continued to shift and they all saw different things while being fully immersed.

The Grand Seer was as focused as can be after finishing the stabilization process. The crowd grew more nervous by the second, ready for the divination result.

He placed both palms on the crystal ball, causing it to become radiant. It started with an image of a clear sky but in the next moment, a loud explosion caused a black tsunami to take over.

It was nothing more than an image yet the spectators found it so realistic. They felt their chest being smashed by the relentless waves and staggered backward. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Black Tides!” Some couldn’t help looking in the direction of the black ocean. This was the first thing people thought of.

Suddenly, lightning bolts descended and illuminated the crystal ball. An unmatched divinity instantly banished the darkness and suppressed the ocean.

A faint figure stood at the center of the lightning bolts with a weapon at the ready. “Boom!” Next came a merciless massacre.

The blow seemingly pierced through the entire ocean in a shocking manner. The spectators became breathless after sensing this divinity through the crystal ball. They had a hard time recognizing the details because the attack released a blinding radiance.

Once they could open their eyes again, the radiance dispersed and the crystal ball lost its shimmer. Eventually, a layer of frost covered the surface, shrouding the images within.

They exchanged glances, still shaken. Everyone wanted to know the meanings behind what they had just seen.

So the darkness clearly indicated that Black Tides would do something next. What about the descending figure? Was that the heavenly genius?

They had no choice but to rely on the Grand Seer and his interpretation. He turned around and stared at them.

Though his eyes looked cloudy and spiritless, they thought that he could easily see through them.

“The astrological sign has emerged and determined the momentum of the future.” He briefly concluded without elaborating.

“Grand Seer, may I ask what is the meaning behind this?” A high elder became impatient.

“The mystery known only to heaven cannot be divulged.” The Grand Seer paused for a bit before responding.

Some were naturally unhappy because that’s precisely the reason why they came - to know more about the future. Anyone else would have faced criticism.

Alas, the Grand Seer had a prestigious position and no one dared to express their displeasure.

As disappointment struck the crowd, he coughed and said: “But since the divination ceremony has commenced anyway, we’ll make an exception today. Everyone can take a look.”

“Take a look?” The crowd clamored, finding this both exciting and unbelievable.

In history, the seers were the only ones in control. Others couldn’t come forward near the crystal ball. This was unprecedented.

“Can we look at our future and fate?” One member of the audience asked.

The Grand Seer glanced at him and said: “Everyone will see different things. It might only be a sign or a hint, it isn’t absolute.”

They started fantasizing about their own future. This was something irresistible.

“Grand Seer, may I ask about the heavenly genius?” One genius asked: “Will you designate someone with this title?”

People nearly forgot about the reason why this ceremony was such a big deal. Unfortunately, the Grand Seer didn’t wish to divulge the heaven’s secrets. This turned out to be quite disappointing.

“That’s up to you whether you’ll see this heavenly genius or not. The heaven’s secrets are right there.” The Grand Seer said.

Others thought that he was relinquishing his responsibility. Nonetheless, they worried more about participating in the process.

“Young Master, will that crystal ball show one’s future?” Yang Ling curiously asked.

“It depends on what they want to see and how.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What about you, Young Master?” She tilted her head.

“My fate is mine, not the heaven’s.” He responded.

“I see...” She murmured while repeating the phrase in her head.

This comment was rather common and has been used by masters or red-blooded geniuses. Nonetheless, she found it different when it came from him.

“Those who wish to divine, line up here.” The Grand Seer stood aside and gave everyone this incredible opportunity.

The way was right in front of them yet some started to hesitate. Yes, reading the future seemed tempting but what if the future was bad? No one wanted to face this.

“I’ll go.” A youth full of vim and vigor stepped forward. He climbed up the platform and stood before the crystal ball.

People watched with bated breath, wanting to see the first result. The youth was naturally nervous as he placed his palms on the ball.

The muddled crystal ball lit up again. He was the only one who could see images; others only saw a blinding light.

After a while, he released the ball, looking emotional and excited.

“What did you see?” A cultivator nearby asked.

He clearly saw something good so he happily responded: “I saw myself walking on a golden ladder, my name was on the golden plaque of successful national examinees, I had three flowers placed on my head...”

“The mystery known only to heaven cannot be divulged.” The Grand Seer interrupted the youth from recalling what he saw.
