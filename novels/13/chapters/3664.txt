Chapter 3665: The Chosen One

“Impossible!” Zhang Yunzhi bellowed after seeing the jade piece in Li Qiye’s hand. He had no choice but to accept the grim reality of the situation.

“The son of miracles did it again. First is the hammer from Myriad Cauldron, now a piece of jade from the golden spring. He does what no one else can, he’s clearly the heaven’s favorite.” One student from Duality said.

“Right, no one else can be so lucky.” The other students agreed.

It seemed as if the heaven had been paying attention to Li Qiye, always instilling fortune upon him. Miracles were nothing, just another meal to him.

“There has to be a problem here, he must have cheated!” The second princess loudly shouted: “So many people stronger and more talented than him have tried yet they got nothing. How could a nobody like him get something from the golden spring?!”

She had lost her cool and bearing due to fear.

The crowd stared at her. Sure, they were astounded by Li Qiye’s feat just now. However, the majority didn’t go crazy like her in trying to refute this fact.

It was impossible for him to trick everyone. They didn’t notice him doing anything special. This could only be attributed to fate and luck.

“Amitabha, there’s no problem here.” Untethered Monk announced.

His comment decisively ended this cheating accusation. No one here could compare to him in terms of prestige and cultivation.

The princess trembled with rage after hearing this. She was stuck in a precarious situation and fear started rearing its ugly head.

“Open the wooden door, let’s see what’s inside!” One spectator shouted at Li Qiye.

“Yeah! Do it!” One expert wished that he could be Li Qiye right now: “Maybe there’s a great treasury in there.” He salivated after saying this.

According to the legends, opening the door meant gaining eternal wealth. The only thing separating Li Qiye and this was one wooden door. All the spectators became excited with the exception of a few.

Though the treasury wasn’t theirs, it was amazing just being able to take a look. Li Qiye was the only one who could broaden their horizon.

“Sure.” Li Qiye smiled and stretched lazily before walking towards the wooden door.

The spectators fully focused on every action of his. Though the house wasn’t far away, the distance felt like a thousand miles to the crowd.

“Will he be able to open it?” One spectator couldn’t help but ask.

“Should be.” Another said with uncertainty: “After all, he already got a piece of jade from the spring, he must be the fateful one.”

Most believed that he would be able to do it after the successful attempt with the spring.

“Not necessarily.” One cultivator remained skeptical: “Remember, the founder of Wish Ward found a key to open the doors while he got a piece of jade.”

“I think the possibility is relatively low. He’s already shown his immense fortune as the heaven’s favorite. If he were to open the door, I’m just going to assume that he’s the heaven’s actual son.” Someone else smiled wryly.

Others also paid attention to the princess and Zhang Yunzhi. The wooden door became the crucial moment of the bet.

Of course, this group wanted Li Qiye to win so that they could see the princess naked...

“Fast, open the wooden door, victory is yours...” A few young ones muttered to themselves.

Meanwhile, the duo was extremely nervous and prayed for Li Qiye’s failure. “Don’t open, don’t open...” They wanted the opposite miracle to happen - for the door to stop Li Qiye.

He finally made it in front of the door and smiled. He was too familiar with it. It wasn’t hard for him to open it at all.

“Open it!” Another spectator shouted.

“Yes, do it!” The crowd clamored, too eager to see the content.

Zhang Yunzhi and the princess felt their palms drenched with sweat. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The wooden door is sealed by a supreme, you absolutely can’t open it. Just give up and we can renegotiate the terms.” The tense princess spoke in order to muster some courage. Plus, she wanted him to give up on his own accord. Losing meant doing something unthinkable for a woman of her status.

As the crowd urged him to hurry up, he suddenly wanted to do something else and smirked.

He turned around and stared at them: “Do you know why no one can open this wooden door?”

“Why?” The crowd became silent until someone asked.

“Because you don’t know the right method.” Li Qiye said.

“What do you mean? What’s the right method?” Another wondered.

A while ago, they would have scorned him for saying something like this, accusing him of posturing. Now, they actually believed him.

“Watch carefully and remember, I’m about to start.” Li Qiye chuckled before putting on a serious expression. He then turned around to face the door.

The stirred crowd watched him with bated breath, not wanting to miss a single detail.

Li Qiye smirked after winning their attention, seemingly quite amused.

“He’s about to do it...”
