Chapter 5908: Still External Things

“Who are you going to give it to? No one can endure it.” The eye found something amiss.

“It belongs to the living beings, to this world, to the epoch.” Li Qiye surprised the three listeners.

“You would do it?” The pleasant found this unbelievable.

“Why wouldn’t I?” Li Qiye said.

The three couldn’t come up with a response upon hearing this. Given their stature, they possessed legacy items similar to Li Qiye’s primordial tree.

This tree had no equal in history - the thing granting Li Qiye everlasting life and indestructibility.

Given the importance of legacy items, it was unfathomable that both parties had thoughts about leaving them behind to others.

“I am just a passerby. Although I own the tree right now, anyone else with enough talent and luck can connect and use it. Isn’t that the case for you three too?” Li Qiye said.

“Yes.” The eye agreed.

“I don’t need it, I am me and this legacy item is just an artifact, that’s all.” Li Qiye continued.

“Looks like we emphasize the wrong aspect, the reason why you have surpassed us.” The pleasant voice said.

“Yes, it is still an external item. The ultimate path relies on the self.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“You are enlightened, truly qualified to fight the high heaven. It is inevitable.” The deep voice said.

“Yes, it is inevitable.” Li Qiye sighed.

“How does it feel?” The pleasant voice asked.

“What?” Li Qiye asked for elaboration.

“When you are enlightened and looking down on this world and its people.” The voice said.

“Full of love.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You, love? I don’t think so.” The deep voice didn’t buy it.

“What do you see then when you look at the people?” Li Qiye asked.

“Mere ants.” The deep voice said the first thing on its mind.

“All things can be loved, even the ugliest and most ferocious ants can have a cute side to them.” Li Qiye waved his hands.

The owners of the pleasant and deep voices became startled at Li Qiye’s state of mind.

“You’ve done it.” The eye said: “We were talking about a reward for your help, how silly. You no longer need anything for you are farther on the road. It is only a matter of time now.”

“I wouldn’t be so sure. There are things worth observing and speculating in this world still.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The three supreme terrors exchanged glances. [1]

“I don’t think so.” The deep voice said: “You can enter the battlefield now, not even he can stop you.”

“They’re two separate matters. Since I’m full of love, I can appreciate visiting any place.” Li Qiye said.

“Can’t argue with that.” The eye responded.

“A person full of love such as myself finds joy in everything.” Li Qiye continued.

Others would dispute this in their mind, not daring to say anything. However, the three terrors here actually believed him.

“We wanted to tell you something.” The eye said.

“Go for it.” Li Qiye nodded.

“The world was not like this at inception.” The eye began.

“I can imagine, no epoch can compare to the primordial chaos. A small corner back then surpassed anything now.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Everyone wasn’t as greedy either and could endure.” The pleasant voice let out a sigh.

“The villainous heaven made the first move with the seal, or other possibilities could have been possible.” The deep voice snorted.

“But they went crazy, eating everything they could.” Li Qiye said.

“They lost control but this happened way later.” The eye said.

“So what happened?” Li Qiye said.

“No one remembers since so much time had passed. We left earlier so we know even less about the details.” The pleasant voice said.

“This is the crux of the matter, how were you able to take the first step?” Li Qiye asked.

“The seal prevented everyone from leaving, but an opportunity came later.” The eye explained: “The villainous heaven was finally challenged.”

“Mang.” Li Qiye was aware of this.

“Yes, Mang.” The eye wasn’t surprised by Li Qiye’s knowledge: “You’ve heard of this story before?”

“Yes, the only being to have successfully challenged and shook the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and his eyes became profound, seemingly capable of seeing through everything.

“We left with that. Everything changed unbeknown to us, but we do have guesses. And then you came later for that explosion, and it’s all gone now.” The eye said.

“It was already an empty shell, I did it a favor.” Li Qiye said: “But this is not what you want to tell me.”

“Yes.” The eye said: “Mang is not around anymore and the matter is settled with the villainous heaven on top, but there must be something else behind it all.”

“I’ve thought about this before, it did exist.” Li Qiye said.

“We initially wanted to give you information so that you could go take a look.” The eye said.

“But given your current state, you no longer need it.” The pleasant voice added.

“Therefore, our information is meaningless.” The deep voice admitted.

“Nevertheless, you three still want me to go to see if there’s anything left from back then.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Well, it’s not as significant since it was a defeat and you have surpassed Mang.” The eye said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Yes, I am getting a bit more interested now that you three have brought it up.” Li Qiye responded.
