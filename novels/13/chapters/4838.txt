Chapter 4839: World Jade

In a place farther and brighter than the heaven, more mysterious than the dao, there existed a single floating block of jade.

It seemed to be eternal regardless of the epoch and would continue to exist in the faraway future.

The sky draped down around the jade block in an illusory fashion. Though it appeared to only be one step from the mortal world, this one step was impossible to cross.

The inhabitants of Eight Desolaces didn’t know about this neighbor. From here, one could see everything happening in the mortal realm. Moreover, one could reach any place in Eight Desolaces by just taking one step out of the border.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, not even divine monarchs and dao lords could spot its existence. This was a one-sided relationship - the result of unimaginable circumstances.

This was not manmade but rather, a natural paradise formed by an inscrutable grand dao.

There was one exception - Li Qiye. He could see this place and enter it as well.

He stood there and observed the jade continent without saying anything or taking another step.

“Go take a look, just a short stay is fine.” Tantai Ruonan told him. In the present, no one knew more about Li Qiye’s emotions and thoughts than her.

He took a deep breath and finally entered. This place was tranquil and had beautiful scenery. Insects and birds could be heard everywhere in the verdant forest. This paradise offered pristine freedom and happiness.

Its inhabitants were one with the land. Their breath harmonized with its rhythm.

A hut could be seen on top of a peak. It appeared simple yet clean - the owner was clearly someone diligent.

An old woman inside was lighting the stove. Her simple dress was awfully clean and had an embroidery of a flower from the south. It depicted the flower masterfully using the fewest number of lines.

Her face was full of wrinkles; her hair was as white as can be. Her muddled eyes showed that she wasn’t far from her last day. An old woman like her could be seen everywhere in the mortal world.

The old woman’s eyes suddenly exuded endless rays. Her terrifying aura erupted along with her myriad dao.

She turned around and left the hut. In the next second, she emerged again in front of a cliff and looked to be in total control. The world and stars were within her grasp. She clearly had the power to kill any intruder in the blink of an eye.

Of course, she usually took this very seriously due to the reclusive nature of this place. These uninvited guests were clearly capable.

“Whoosh!” Li Qiye appeared in front of her with a single step.

She became alarmed and wanted to attack. Alas, her pulsing eyes saw Li Qiye; this prompted her to stop since she couldn’t believe it.

“Long time no see.” He let out a bright smile. The oppressive aura suddenly disappeared and this area became pleasant again.

She opened her mouth but didn’t know what to say for a while.

“I remember, you used to call me Brother Li.” His tone was as gentle as the spring breeze.

“Buzz.” She became radiant with waves coming out like a blooming lotus flower. She shed her mortal shell and revealed her true appearance.

She became a young woman with an incredible level of spirit energy. Her features were gentle and charming, truly an attractive woman.

She had an air of nobility that has accumulated over a long time, making it rather exceptional. Kings were mere subjects in her presence. Nonetheless, this didn’t make her imperious and distant.

“You’ve returned, Brother Li.” She bowed to greet him.

“Indeed.” He glanced over at the meticulously-kept hut.

There was a small tree next to the hut with only three leaves. However, they seemed to have been there for epochs now.

“Her Highness is inside, should I wake her up?” She asked. [1]

“No.” He shook his head while staring at the tree: “It’s not time yet, I’m just here to take a look.”

She nodded and kept him company. The two then walked over to the cliff and sat down with their legs dangling in the air.

“Her Highness has been waiting for your triumphant return, Brother Li.” She said.

“Right, waiting.” He was in a good mood while appreciating the scenery.

“Still not done yet?” She asked.

“It’ll be finished in this generation.” He said while becoming one with this unique area.

She felt his dao fusing with the land and didn’t prevent it.

“I will keep her company during the wait.” She said.

“I didn’t expect to see you here.” He enjoyed the warmth of the area.

“Her Highness came to find me after making up her mind. She needed assistance while staying in the temporal flow. I was fine with it since I wanted to see the world.” She said.

“I know, you have done well.” He said.

“It was an honor.” She responded.

“I’m actually surprised by your choice.” He became slightly emotional. Not everyone could wait for eras in the same spot.

“I’ve experienced the mortal coil already.” She said: “For me, this is definitely a fortune. I have benefited from these years. Plus, it is nothing compared to what you have done, Brother Li.”

“Thank you.” He expressed his sincere gratitude.
