Chapter 4309: Plan

The disciples didn’t know what to do with the box in front of them while feeling perplexed about this situation.

They saw Li Qiye nodding and decided to accept the box.

“As long as the rivers flow and the mountains hold, we shall meet again, Sirs.” Wang Zining cupped his fist towards the disciples then bowed towards Li Qiye. He took the coin and left.

The disciples also returned the gesture, feeling as if they had just signed a contract or something similar.

“Sect Master, what happened just now?” One of them asked and brought the box to Li Qiye.

They wondered why he chose the box over the treasure within. The difference in value was rather obvious. Nonetheless, they had great confidence in him.

Li Qiye took the box for a look before smirking.

“Sect Master, what is the mystery behind this box?” Elder Hu couldn’t quell his curiosity, aware that Li Qiye had a perfect reason for his choice. His confidence in Li Qiye couldn’t be overstated.

“Chalk it up to fate.” Li Qiye’s hand became resplendent with circling dao laws. He clenched his fist and the box started transforming - soaring dragon, the celestials, a river reflecting for miles…

These images had ancient runes and hymns seemingly chanted by the sages, enough to captivate all listeners.

The young ones from Little Diamond were astounded. They didn’t expect the old box to be so magical. This was obviously an amazing treasure. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Crack!” He loosened his grip and the box became normal again. However, a keen observer would note that the lines on the box became more defined versus before.

“Sect Master, you actually bought something so amazing with just one coin.” One disciple praised.

The others were in awe. It looked like they were too naive compared to their sect master.

“There is no free lunch. A bond has been forged so one day, we’ll have to honor it.” Li Qiye said.

They then realized that they had come to some agreement with Wang Zining earlier, something similar to a pact of friendship.

Though this was rather intangible, one thing for certain was that they would need to repay him in the future.

Li Qiye handed the box to Elder Hu and said: “Let them try.”

The elder took a closer look and didn’t notice anything peculiar. He asked: “How does this treasure work? What is special about it?”

“That depends on the individual, let them search for an answer.” Li Qiye preferred to let his flock of sheep run freely.

“Everyone, take turns looking at it. Feel free to share your insight.” Elder Hu understood and commanded.

After they got the box, they crowded up and became anxious. After all, they never had any exposure to a top treasure before. This was an opportunity they couldn’t miss.

“Master, I don’t understand. What was the goal of that man?” Wang Weiqiao quietly asked. He knew that Wang Zining was definitely not a mortal from a prestigious clan.

If this guy was a cultivation expert, why did he come here? If Li Qiye was right about the treasure being fake, then he was a swindler trying to trap the young ones.

This wasn’t rare at all in this city due to its high population and visitors. There were hidden masters mingling among dishonest merchants.

But if Zining was a swindler, why did he use such a precious box to carry the piece-of-crap treasure? What was his intention?

Only someone like Li Qiye would have the insight to pick the box over the radiant treasure. Weiqiao was also certain that Zining himself knew the value of the box. Thus, the guy’s action was rather confusing down to the end where Li Qiye paid a single coin for the box.

“A few people like to play around in the mortal world.” Li Qiye smiled and explained: “Moreover, fate and relationships can be more important than anything else. A bond can protect someone for generations to come.”

“I see…” Weiqiao carefully digested the guidance. He assumed that Wang Zining was actually a hidden master or a wise cultivator, not a naive mortal. Alas, he still remained confused about the exact goal.

“Young Noble, have you thought about it carefully yet?” The aunt came over and asked Li Qiye: “I’ll have you know that the miss I’m thinking of is from a cultivation sect as well, a temple or something. We can go take a look and if you like her, I’ll fix her up with you right then.”

She was indeed an enthusiastic matchmaker, wanting nothing more than to push a girl into Li Qiye’s embrace.

“Which temple?” Elder Hu casually asked.

The aunt pondered a bit to no avail. She answered: “Mmm, which temple… divine temple or something like that, she visited a while ago and has returned to see her family two days prior.”

“Divine temple? The Ancestral Divine Temple?” Elder Hu was shocked.

“Right! The Ancestral Divine Temple, that’s what it is. She told me but I couldn’t remember, my memory isn’t good anymore.” She smiled and said: “Young Noble, are you ready? Maybe this will work out and I’ll get my matchmaking payment.”

“Ancestral Divine Temple…” On the other hand, Elder Hu became frozen. His soul nearly left his body.
