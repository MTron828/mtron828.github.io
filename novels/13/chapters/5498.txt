Chapter 5499: White Cloud

Anyone would lay on this white cloud for a long nap upon seeing it. When it flickered, it had two darker patches nearby resembling the eyes of a panda - incredibly adorable. It could form hands as well - fat and fluffy, slightly short.

Hearts would melt just by looking at it - the perfect pillow for cuddling. It extended its hand and cautiously poked him several times with a brief pause amidst each - afraid of angering him while wanting his attention…

“This is…” Li Qiye was surprised to see the cloud.

The cloud covered its eyes, looking a bit shy. Nonetheless, it still stole glances at him through the gap of its fingers, clearly curious about Li Qiye.

“What is it?” Niu Fen took a careful look. He didn’t know how it got next to them without being noticed.

Cultivators were sensitive to being ambushed, especially those at Niu Fen’s level. How did the cloud appear next to him undetected?

He activated his heavenly gaze and didn’t notice any powerful aura coming from the cloud.

“That’s not right.” He murmured since it seemed like just any other cloud.

“Brat, who are you? Where did you come from?” He asked.

The cloud glanced at Niu Fen once before focusing on showing off to Li Qiye. It spread its arms and made it look like wings, allowing it to float away with the winds.

It seemed particularly friendly to Li Qiye and did the wing stretch several times, making sure that he had a good look. It then spun around so that Li Qiye could see all of it.

Niu Fen finally saw something with the rotation - he felt a mystical aura and power, virtually undetectable and different from anything else.

Such power had never appeared in this world before, at least not to his knowledge. It didn’t stem from the dao, not possessing chaos true energy or any worldly energy. There was no trace of anima either…

As an apex cultivator, he had seen powerful beings before including Li Qiye. This cloud was something unique.

It could have been floating in the air all this time and no one would notice anything peculiar about it.

“You came from Celestial Court? Or Immortal Dao City? Imperial Field?” Niu Fen asked again, thinking that the mysterious cloud must have come from these locations.

The cloud ignored him and blinked cutely at Li Qiye. It circled around him, seemingly wanting to play hide and seek.

Its friendly effort amused Li Qiye while Niu Fen didn’t appreciate being ignored.

“I see, don’t want to talk, right? I got it.” Niu Fen said before making his move.

He had noticed a spirit root deep in the cloud - this might be its true form. The cloud was only an external manifestation.

Of course, he couldn’t see the true appearance of the root, only sensing its energy fluctuations.

“Boom!” He called on the power of the dao and suppressed everything nearby, reaching for the spirit root.

The cloud raised its hands to block him but he had no intention of stopping. His might robbed the world of its colors.

This seemed to anger the cloud. It changed its color to that of a sunset glow, akin to someone becoming livid and flustered.

‘Boom!” It pushed Niu Fen and swept him off his feet; his head slammed against the ground.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This would shock any outsider from the upper continents. Some were stronger than him but to be able to take him down in this fashion? Only a selected few.

“What the hell are you?” Niu Fen got up and stared at it in disbelief.

The cloud changed back to its white color again and seemed to be making a funny face at Niu Fen.
