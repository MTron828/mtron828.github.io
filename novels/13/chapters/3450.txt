The ones in front of the entrance were packed like sardines. Some didn’t give up and continued to enter. They eventually found it futile.

“What the hell is this place? There’s no way to make it through.” One of them lamented.

“The treasury might be in there but no one can get to it, all we can do is salivate.” Another expert stared at the brilliance coming from deeper within.

“Maybe we can’t, that doesn’t mean others can’t. I saw the crown prince of Skylight leading his cavalry in there, the same with Wu ZHongtian and Firmaments Godchild. They still haven’t come out so there’s a chance they have made it to Fire Domain.”

“That’s true.” An older expert added: “People have been trying to understand this place for eras now. It is said that the stone forest is a derivation method, it’s just that we’re not strong enough to understand it. The bigger sects and their ancestors have more experience, perhaps they have come up with a working plan.”

“Then we have no hope of getting that treasury.” One disappointed soul said.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Their conversation was cut short.

They looked up and saw thousands of swords gathering in the sky, looking like a heavenly waterfall.

“Firmaments Sword Formation!” The dejected crowd became excited again.

They saw the godchild and several ancestors riding their sword with an ugly expression.

“Looks like Firmaments Gate failed too.” One guy whispered, afraid of being overheard.

Everyone could see that they lasted for a while. Nonetheless, the outcome remained the same. They made one mistake and were forced out, putting their hard work to waste.

That’s why their expression was justified. They followed the best method calculated by their sect to the teeth. There was just one mistake as far as they knew that took them out of the running.

“One more time?” The godchild and the ancestors debated. They have already spent plenty of effort and time with that first attempt.

Meanwhile, the spectators heaved a sigh of relief while looking at the sword formation.

At the very least, there was still a sliver of hope yet. The powerful sect and this mighty formation didn’t do any better than them.

“Why is this place so strange, it’s just like an endless maze.” One cultivator had tried dozens of times by this point.

“I’ve heard that way back then, this place might be part of an ancestral vein, the one day, the dao became chaotic and a reverse flow destroyed the vein and the spatial area nearby, resulting in this stone forest...” An erudite cultivator talked about its origin.

He went on for a bit and captivated the listeners.

“Boom!” A loud explosion detonated and another cavalry emerged outside the entrance. Some members were on the ground.

“Skylight Dragon Cavalry!” People recognized the group because the commander was the famous first prince of Skylight.

He looked to be in a sorry state at the moment, just no injury. He shouted and ordered his men to regroup and set up camps.

The side of Firmaments also felt better to see their failure, the same with the spectators.

“How far did you get, Godchild?” The first prince spoke first and broke the deadlock. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Not even close to Fire Domain.” The godchild smiled wryly with a tinge of embarrassment while telling the truth.

“We didn’t fare any better.” The prince shook his head: “We barely saw the domain in the distance but that’s it. The next step took us out.”

The prince and the cavalry perfectly moved in unison, almost as if they were one. Unfortunately, the calculation was still incorrect.

“Maybe our derivations and calculations aren’t complete.” The prince expressed his opinion.

The godchild exchanged glances with his ancestors after hearing this.

People could see that these two groups should work together. However, that would be bad news for everyone else.

“Buzz.” Chaos true energy interrupted their conversations along with the yin and yang.

A group emerged from the chaos, led by an awe-inspiring youth.

“Wu Zhongtian.” The crowd knew who it was.

“They messed up too.” Another whispered.

Those who came out before celebrated internally. They worried about Yin Yang Gate the most.

It was powerful enough already. With the addition of this treasury, it would be akin to a tiger with wings. No one in the north would be able to stop them then.

After the dust settled, everyone returned to the starting line.

“Brother Wu, what’s the situation?” The first prince’s relationship with Wu Zhongtian was good enough to ask.

“We couldn’t enter the domain but the treasury is definitely in there.” Wu Zhongtian revealed.

The crowd clamored as a result.

“The deepest part of the stone forest, no one will be able to get it then.” Some couldn’t accept this.

Meanwhile, the young geniuses glanced at each other. In reality, they didn’t contribute much to this effort.

The powerful ancestors from their sect carefully calculated the paths for the trip. Alas, errors seemed to be there.

In order to enter the domain, these ancestors might need to come in person. However, the situation in the north was delicate enough to prevent this.

“What about Ancestral City? Did they make it there?” Zhongtian asked.

This power didn’t react at all to the appearance of the treasury. This was their territory yet no ancestors from there made a move.

Because of this, the great powers had a harder time getting their mighty ancestors to come.

If these existences were to enter Ancestral for the sake of a treasury, it might prompt the pseudo-atavistic golem ancestors to wake up. No one wanted this development.

On the other hand, it was fine for these geniuses to try. The ancestors from Ancestral would turn a blind eye to the competition of the young ones.

Wu Zhongtian and the others had no idea what Ancestral was doing. The treasury was right there. How could they not want it?
