Chapter 4475: Old Friend Gone

Eras disappeared in the blink of an eye along with their secrets. Amazing tales and memories became forgotten; her story was one of them.

Despite her humble beginning, she surpassed all odds and became a sword-wielding god-king. Her tale started near the lake and beneath the gigantic willow tree.

She never told anyone about her past and her success - how she climbed up to an even higher sky.

There, she tried her best to catch up to a figure traveling on an endless journey. Unfortunately, her effort and success were not enough to make up for the insurmountable difference.

She became world-renowned during her pursuit but the world didn’t know about her failure. The thing she treasured the most was still the treasure known back then as the Golden Willow Crest. Its significance in her heart outweighed its actual value.

In the end, she had no choice but to leave the crest behind to her descendants along with a single intent, hoping to meet the figure again in the future.

Life and death; yin and yang - these contrasting affinities separated people. Nonetheless, an eternal intent could surpass this, allowing one’s dream to come true.

The intent was the only thing left of this wondrous cultivator. Of course, it was still impressive and mighty, forcing her descendants down on their knees.

However, she didn’t pay any attention to them, focusing solely on Li Qiye. She saw how he gently flicked her forehead again as time came to a halt.

The very existence of the intent was for this moment alone - a meeting to satiate her longing. Alas, this also meant the end of the intent.

She bowed her head and he accepted her gesture. This scene shocked the spectators.

She was an ancestor from time immemorial, someone worshipped by all four clans. Why was she bowing to Li Qiye?

“I am not lonely on the dao path. Don’t worry, your intent has accomplished its goal, no need to linger any longer.” He stared at her and sighed.

She gazed intensely at him, seemingly wanting to carve his image into her very soul. The climax of her tale was tragic. When he finally returned, she was no longer around. This obsessive intent was the only thing that was left.

“Return now, both your wish and dao are complete.” He gently flicked her forehead and created a spatial fluctuation. This encapsulated this moment and separated it from the river of time.

With that, ripples formed and started dispersing. The figure turned into particles and disappeared from sight. It became a part of time once more.

History was endless. Even top cultivators were nothing more than ripples. Alas, these ripples contained legends, longing, and hope…

Li Qiye felt a bit disappointed about this meeting. Nonetheless, let the past be the past. There was no need for him to dwell on it.

He walked on this path alone. Only someone with an immovable dao heart could last as long as time itself.

“Dust to dust, return to the earth.” He concluded. This was just another of many goodbyes. Disappointing, but at the very least, it was proof that he was still alive.

“Ancient Ancestor!” The group bowed again.

“Young Noble, your descendant was rude to you…” The clan master of the Lu apologized. He felt that Li Qiye was definitely an ancient ancestor of the Wu.

“Rise.” Li Qiye waved. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The group got up and didn’t dare to breathe loudly.

“Give the crest back to the Lu.” Li Qiye ordered: “Since Ten-crest Ancestor left it to them, it is theirs, no excuses.”

“We understand.” Wise and Purpose exchanged glances and obeyed.

The rift between the four clans has been mended with Li Qiye’s absolute command.

“Hand over the dao stone.” He continued.

“About this…” The clan master of the Lu became awkward.

“Virtuous Nephew, the young noble has spoken. Does the clan still not wish to obey?” Purpose said.

“Virtuous Nephew, don’t worry, we will bring the crest back to your clan in just a moment.” Wise nodded.

“There is no point for you to guard the dao stone right now.” Purpose added.

“It’s… not like I don’t want to hand it over.” The clan master coughed.

“Don’t tell me… your clan has lost it?” Jian Ming became startled.

“Is it true?” Both ancestors panicked.

“No, no. It’s not that serious yet.” The Lu waved repeatedly. Alas, he didn’t seem confident.

“Elaborate.” Wise pursued the matter.

“We don’t have the dao stone right now.” The clan master said with embarrassment.

“Where is it then?” Purpose asked. The group had a bad feeling about this.

The clan master took a deep breath and revealed the truth: “When our ancestral aunt was married to the Yu, the dowry included the dao stone.”

“What?! Your clan dared to use the dao stone as a dowry?!” Wise shouted.

“Those damned thieves?” Jian Ming interjected.
