The destruction of these world-renowned warships left everyone in a daze. Even the smaller type was fashioned with extremely precious divine metals. Eternals or even True Emperors personally cast them.

The creation process was arduous and meticulous. Each of these ships has been blessed by the aforementioned powerful beings before. They contained extraordinary power, similar to an imperial or Eternal weapon.

These ships have participated in many famous expeditions across Imperial and earned numerous merits. They were the harbingers of doom for one sect after another.

This group only suffered minor losses in the past. Thus, losing one or two ships was a big deal but today, Li Qiye destroyed a dozen or so already.

“Who is this guy?” Many ancestors were at a loss for words after seeing this.

Li Qiye was too unfamiliar with this crowd. People had no idea about his identity.

“I heard he called himself Fiercest or Li Qiye, but who knows where he’s from.” An outsider heard news about Li Qiye from the natives here.

“Fiercest?” This was their first time hearing this title too, almost like a newcomer. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“He’s a new genius?” Someone said: “That’s incredible, the future generation will surpass us in time. First, there’s Jade-break True Emperor and Puresword True Emperor, now there’s Fiercest too.”

“Buzz.” The armada suddenly turned directions, aiming all of their cannons straight at Li Qiye to deliver a fatal blow.

Perhaps there were more than two hundred ships here and too many cannons to count. The crowd naturally became afraid.

“Full firepower.” One person whispered: “They have used it once together and crippled a system. It never recovered afterward.”

“That’s too much. Do they want to sink Mingluo City?” Older experts became startled.

“We better get far away because a real fight will end with the city being penetrated completely.” One experienced master yelled before rushing out of the city.

In fact, chaos ensued right after the cannons aimed at Li Qiye. A horde started leaving the city, afraid of the consequences.

“State your name. Hidden Gold Grotto does not kill nameless juniors.” A general appeared on top of one ship and shouted at Li Qiye.

“Never heard of Hidden Gold Grotto.” Li Qiye stood there and leisurely responded.

This general slightly grimaced while the crowd exchanged glances.

“This brat is so haughty, talking like that to the grotto?” One spectator said.

Who hasn’t heard of Hidden Grotto in Imperial Lineage? In fact, people would shudder after hearing its name because of its domineering style.

“So you want it the hard way, huh?” The general’s eyes turned cold as he threatened: “I don’t care what your background is, don’t blame anyone for dying today since you’re asking for it.”

“Do your worst while you still have a chance.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve dismissively.

“Move up, full power, don’t leave a bone behind!” The general commanded with murderous intent.

“Buzz.” The smaller ships left the formation and went to the front, acting as a wall.

They loudly moved around and formed their own battle array before becoming bright. The wings in the back began to line up so these ships seemed to be connected.

“Buzz.” Space trembled as a result of the successful connection.

When everyone took in the whole picture, they found that the ships have surrounded Li Qiye. They looked like a golden net trapping Li Qiye’s area. Their lights continued to spread until a golden sphere emerged around him.

He was at the very center so there was no blind spot at all for the cannons. They have locked on completely and would open fire the moment he shows any opening, completely burying him with barrages.

“It’s starting.” A spectator murmured while looking at the ships. Around one hundred or so were surrounding him.

“Buzz.” At the same time, the ten great ships emitted a blinding light.

“The ten monarchs are joining too?” Someone gasped at this sight.

“That’s enough to cripple a system, isn’t this too much for a junior?” One expert became surprised.

“Fire!” An order resounded. All the small ships fired at once.

“Boom! Boom!” The entire city quaked as a result while shots drowned out the sky.

The citizens lay down on the ground, paled. This was the most terrifying display of firepower they have ever seen. It looked like a raging inferno from hell pouring down on the city.

“Rumble!” Continuous detonations hurt the eardrums. These flames coming from more than one thousand cannons directly engulfed Li Qiye.

The space around him began to crack and melt. That’s why everyone could feel the searing temperature and become parched.

The city itself seemed to be melting; the inhabitants had a hard time withstanding the increasing heatwave.

“Is he dead? An Eternal might not be able to withstand that firepower.” One person murmured while looking at the ocean of flames.

“He’s fine?!” A master could see through the barrages and shout in astonishment.

“Really?!” Everyone became startled and focused their gaze towards the center.
