Chapter 3827: Tag Along

Yang Ling visited before Li Qiye’s departure.

“I want to go to Black Wood Cliff with you, Young Master.” Though she wasn’t a genius, she still had admirable traits such as being very direct.

She was the first to know about Li Qiye’s journey because Fan Bai came to say goodbye.

“Why?” Li Qiye stared at her.

“I want to broaden my horizon. The seniors told me about Black Wood and its fantastic tales, it’s just that I never got the chance to visit it.” She hurriedly responded.

He only smiled.

“Young Master, please bring me too, I can serve you or do whatever you need, I’ll be very diligent!” She grabbed his arm and begged.

Others wouldn’t dare to be so familiar with Li Qiye. Yang Ling, on the other hand, got to know Li Qiye better so she acted boldly.

“Go pack your stuff.” Li Qiye eventually granted her permission.

She became excited and cheered before speaking: “No need to go back, my family already prepared everything for me.” Having said that, she patted her spatial pouch.

This wasn’t her idea alone. Her family, especially her father, wanted her to be around Li Qiye.

He was intelligent enough to understand Li Qiye’s limitless potential. There was a chance of him becoming a dao lord in the future.

Thus, he didn’t want to miss this opportunity and hoped that his daughter could stay with Li Qiye. This would benefit both Yang Ling and the clan. They might reach an unprecedented height as a result.

“Fine.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Yang Ling happily left and went to look for Fan Bai.

The latter played a big part in Li Qiye’s decision. Fan Bai didn’t have friends so it was good to have a cheerful girl like Yang Ling around.

Of course, Yang Ling and her father weren’t the only ones with this idea.

As Li Qiye was about to leave, the old man from Duality visited again with Dugu Lan behind him.

She was always a sight to behold wherever she went - beautiful and elegant, always commanding attention. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I heard about your departure, Young Master.” The old man bowed and said: “I’m sorry for the lack of hospitality during your stay at Duality...”

“Pleasantries are unnecessary.” Li Qiye interrupted.

“You’re going to Black Wood, right?” The old man smiled and asked.

“Mmm.” Li Qiye nodded.

“So is the seawater really receding?” His eyes shifted slightly.

The big shots in the holy ground have received this information from Wei Qianqing. Nonetheless, virtually all of them dismissed it.

He himself thought that it was extremely unlikely. However, Li Qiye’s trip there must be for a reason.

“You tell me.” Li Qiye replied.

He became nervous because this was a dreadful matter. No one in the holy ground could escape this. In fact, all of the south might go down.

“Then we must prepare.” He stared straight at Li Qiye and answered.

“Better work together well.” Li Qiye said flatly.

The old man had no response. The current holy ground wasn’t the same as before.

Prior to this, Buddha Supreme was in charge and solidarity was at an all-time high. One command from him would result in the holy ground working together.

Now, people thought that he was dead. Thus, the various powers had selfish calculations. Despite being one of the most influential figures, he definitely couldn’t unify the holy ground.

“I have neither enough power nor status to do this. Young Master, the holy ground relies on your leadership.” He said softly.

“A bunch of fools, when together, are still fools. There will only be more people and louder fanfare, do you really think they’ll wholeheartedly work together against the enemies?” Li Qiye chuckled.

The old man had an awkward expression. Li Qiye’s comment, though unpleasant, was still truthful.

Vajra was currently in charge but numerous other powers wanted its position. In the past, Buddha Supreme and Sacred Mountain prevented them from acting on it.

A few things were different in the present. First, Buddha Supreme was gone. Second, Archaic Sun King was considered to be a failed leader. Others no longer wanted to be under Vajra’s supervision.

As for Vajra, it certainly had the ambition of no longer being under the rule of Sacred Mountain. That’s the only way for the dynasty to be eternal.

All in all, even if these powers were to rally together for a common cause, internal strife would eventually take over.

“Young Master, are you saying...” He hesitated.

“Just let it be, it’s not actually a big deal. No legacy lasts forever. When it is time to fall, it’ll fall.” Li Qiye said.

“I can’t be as open-minded as you.” He smiled wryly. He didn’t share the same freedom as Li Qiye since he was responsible for Duality Academy.

Though Duality was separate from the holy ground, it was still built on the latter’s land. Thus, if the holy ground were to fall, so would the academy.

The problem was, even if he sincerely tried his best, Vajra and the other divisions wouldn’t listen to him anyway. Only Buddha Supreme had this level of influence.

He eventually sighed and gave up, wanting to focus on the academy’s survival instead.

“Young Master, it is a long and arduous journey to Black Wood.” He then spoke: “Let our Little Lan follow you and take care of your daily needs.”

He then beckoned for Dugu Lan to walk forward.

“I hope to be of service, Young Master. It is my honor to follow you.” Dugu Lan bowed her head.

The old man wanted Dugu Lan to stick around not only because of Li Qiye’s status but also for her to learn more.

Outsiders would consider this preposterous. Dugu Lan was the number one genius of the holy ground. Now, she was about to be Li Qiye’s maid?

“Nothing’s long and arduous about this, it’s just a stroll.” Li Qiye refused.

“Young Master, you must think that our little lady isn’t clever enough.” The old man smiled bitterly.

“No, she’s a rare genius. The academy is lucky to have someone like her.” Li Qiye glanced at her and praised.
