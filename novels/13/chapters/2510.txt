Spectators were still fixated on this fight. One quietly asked: “What techniques will the king use?”

“Maybe he won’t use any technique like earlier, just straight up killing.” Someone else responded.

Many nodded in agreement after hearing this. Earlier, they thought he would need several moves to defeat Tang Hexiang but he ended up only using his knee.

Perhaps the same thing would happen again.

“You shouldn’t be so excited when I’m still alive!” Hexiang furiously roared, unable to handle the disdain shown by both Li Qiye and the crowd.

“Alright, I’ll make sure you give up entirely.” Li Qiye smiled and started floating into the sky.

It didn’t take long before he was at the sky vault. Even someone as large as Hexiang needed to look up.

“Go now, do your best and have no regrets.” Li Qiye casually said.

Despite being high above, he still only looked like a fly compared to Hexiang. Just one swat from the shield could end him. Alas, everyone knew that size didn’t matter at all in this match.

“Die!” Hexiang shouted; his body as resplendent as a star.

“Boom!” He threw his sky-blotting shield up above and smashed through several stars along the way.

The sky turned dark due to its massive size. Li Qiye looked so insignificant, seemingly on the verge of becoming meat paste.

“Weak indeed.” Li Qiye shook his head disapprovingly while looking at the star-destroying shield.

He casually spread out his palm and pushed down. The sheer disparity in size between his palm and the shield created a comedic scene.

“Boom!” However, just this carefree palm strike was enough to stop the shield. It couldn’t move an inch forward, unable to affect his palm. The resulting shockwaves from the impact were still plenty destructive to the stars around. Unfortunately, it did nothing to the main target.

“The gap is too great, having a big body and giant weapons can’t do anything.” Someone from the last generation shook their head.

Logically, Hexiang should be able to crush Li Qiye easily due to the size difference. However, his heavy shield failed to move Li Qiye at all.

“Go!” He roared and sent out his true energy. A starry brilliance crazily engulfed the world as his power surged.

The shield also became resplendent and more powerful. Alas, still ineffective.

“Rumble!” The shield moved back and forth in order to gather momentum to slam into his palm.

It’s a shame that Li Qiye’s casual positioning resembled the suppression of the high heaven. Even the strongest character couldn’t get through his grasp.

“Die!” Hexiang’s eyes flashed after seeing the failed attack and added a spear thrust into the mix.

“Whoosh!” The dragon spear turned into a terrible ray aiming straight for Li Qiye’s throat to deliver a fatal blow.

It seemed that Hexiang was waiting for this moment for a while now so his speed reached the limit, only taking a split second to reach the target.

Due to the murderous intent and lightning-fast speed of the thrust, the spectators felt a chill by their neck, thinking that the spear was heading for them.

“Clank!” A metallic clanking resounded and the shooting ray suddenly stopped.

Everyone saw Li Qiye stopping the spear with his other hand, using just two fingers to stop the tip.

The crowd heaved a sigh of relief but something else happened right away.

A pagoda appeared and slammed into Li Qiye’s back. The sudden appearance of this treasure coincided with the spear thrust. The moment the spear got close to his throat, the pagoda appeared right behind his back. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Since both of his hands were occupied, he couldn’t stop the pagoda.

Another ambusher had joined the fray and worked perfectly with Tang Hexiang.

“Boom!” The pagoda oozed out the crushing might of an Eternal. Not only did it crush the space nearby, but it also took down the temporal affinity as well, turning everything back to the primordial chaos.

The shocked spectators found it hard to breathe due to the aura of an Eternal.

He took the full brunt of the strike and fell into the lake, sinking deep into the lake and disappeared from sight.

Everything happened so quickly. From the initial spear thrust to the pagoda sneak-attack only took the blink of an eye.

No one expected this to happen. Liu Chuqing’s expression soured as she blurted: “Not good!”

“Hmph!” The aura of the Eternal flowed like mercury in the air and permeated the place. Everyone was frightened by this incredible divinity.

They looked up at the sky and saw an old man standing there since who knows when? The pagoda floated above this godlike being.

“Central Commander Ma Mingchun.” No one dared to say his title loudly.

An Eternal had entered the scene with a sneak-attack with immense power.

Remember, the saber saint was very strong but he was still only at the ninth level, still a way to go before becoming an Eternal.

Plus, there were weak and strong Eternals. Among the crowd right now, few would dare to claim having enough power to challenge Ma Mingchun. Not too many in the systems were truly stronger than this commander.

Only great existences, such as the five supreme ancestors, were stronger than him.

“An Eternal has made his move.” This speaker didn’t dare to call it a sneak-attack.

In fact, it was unthinkable that a character as famous as the Central Commander would resort to a sneak-attack in public.

It was one thing for him to directly challenge Li Qiye. After all, his son Ma Jinming was killed by the guy.

Unfortunately, no one dared to criticize him the way they did with Tang Hexiang. Thus, people only shuddered while looking at this Eternal.
