Chapter 5804: Tribulation Slash

“I see.” Sword channeled his power, releasing twelve wills. They came together to form an azure containing anima.

“Boom!” He activated his bloodline as well - Heaven Authority. His vitality swept through the expanse as his forehead became radiant with the mark of the bloodline.

Those nearby couldn’t help but tremble after sensing the might of his bloodline. This went double for heaveners; some felt their knees becoming weak.

Their bloodline was inferior so they felt subjugated in the process. If a heavener could be born with this bloodline, the child could dominate his race without the need to cultivate. This bloodline reigned supreme and crushed all other heavener bloodlines.

Other races felt a similar pressure, albeit at a weaker extent.

“Crack!” His heavenly sword cracked, revealing the embedded dao talisman.

Activation resulted in a loud detonation and he became massive. The mysteries of the dao oozed out of the talisman, causing everyone else’s dao to harmonize and contribute.

“Myriad Dao Beginning!” Sword swung his blade, causing the world to turn dark for a split second.

Next, all dao within the world appeared colorfully, joining as one within his slash in the form of a heavenly dao.

“Rumble!” An ocean of lightning appeared and engulfed the battlefield.

“A tribulation!” Spectators shouted in astonishment and turned pale. This was the thing they feared most.

Li Qiye retaliated with a sword thrust guided by his heart. The blade traversed and connected myriad realms.

Everyone experienced a sensation of worlds opening up. They could go anywhere by just taking one step forward.

An immortal world of everlasting life, the desolate touch of a fallen world, or one filled with bliss and pleasure...

Although it was dangerously fatal, others couldn’t help but want to offer their body to the thrust, hoping to be taken to their desired world. Being pierced was an acceptable exchange.

In reality, attempting to dodge was useless in the first place. The thrust aimed to deliver the target to their desired world. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The driver of the technique was not Li Qiye’s heart but their own. The thoughts within their mind and heart transformed into the blade.

Somehow, the thrust made the heavenly tribulation miss home and retreat to the sky.

“Splash!” It pierced Sword’s chest and heart, pinning him to the fabrics of space.

“Incredible, so it’s my heart... I see...” He spat out blood while trying to speak.

Profound blocked in front of Li Qiye to prevent a finishing blow while others came to help Sword. Heavenly rays descended to mend his injuries.

Although he could stand, he felt his strength leaving his body due to the grievous injuries.

“Thank you for the lesson, Sacred Teacher. So the technique follows my heart, I am enlightened.” He said sentimentally.

Everyone had mistakenly thought that “Follow The Heart” was referring to Li Qiye’s heart. The fact that it was the target’s heart made this virtually impossible to dodge. The only way to end the technique was the piercing of the heart.

“You want to try too?” Li Qiye smiled at Profound.

Everyone took a deep breath. Profound was considered to be the strongest among them - a being rumored to have broken the limit. That’s how he fought evenly with World Emperor.

Although they didn’t quite understand World’s power ceiling, they saw how he managed to block a smash from Jiao Heng’s mech. That had to be above the limit.

“We can only accept defeat before you, Sacred Teacher.” Profound sighed while looking at Li Qiye, well aware of being weaker.
