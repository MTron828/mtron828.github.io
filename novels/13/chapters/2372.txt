The untethered gave a harsh glare at Longevity Sage for her comment. Though the two were antagonistic at times, they shared a similar view on many topics since they were both intelligent women.

“Marriage is a very big deal.” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “Not just anyone can become my wife, but the requirement is less stringent for a bed-warming maid.”

He didn’t directly state his intention but everyone understood. Keep in mind that the untethered was not only the sect master of Yang Radiance, powerful, and talented - she was also a supreme beauty, to say the least.

Many men could only look up at her, not daring to have any unnecessary thoughts. Alas, Li Qiye said that she was only suitable to be a bed-warming maid, a truly incomprehensible statement.

She naturally didn’t take it in stride. Nevertheless, she maintained her aloof and unreachable attitude, which was strangely attractive.

“Alright, this matter ends here if no one else wants to play.” Li Qiye smiled: “But of course, I welcome all challengers in the future, just know to bring more experts. Don’t embarrass yourself by coming with three or five Ascenders. At least make it fun.”

How could anyone retort? Even the falcon god, an Eternal, died without a grave against Li Qiye. If anyone wanted to attack Li Qiye now, they needed to bring Eternals at the very least. Ascenders were mere cannon-fodders now.

“Off we go.” He waved towards Wu Bingning and the rest.

The ladies followed him and left since no one would dare to stop them now. His departure allowed the crowd to breathe again. His presence resembled a mountain weighing down on everyone.

Those who have declared their intention of killing him felt the best. They dropped to the ground and murmured: “That monster is finally gone.”

“That person has unlimited potential, he won’t stay at Myriad or even Imperial in the future for Immortal is a better fit.” One ancestor speculated.

The crowd was shaken. Even the big shots among them had a hard time reaching Imperial, let alone Immortal.

“I don’t think anyone in Myriad can take him on, well, maybe Dracoform Martial God.” Another conceded.

The symbol of strength in Myriad - Dracoform. People shuddered upon hearing his name. If even he couldn’t face Li Qiye, then Li Qiye would truly be invincible in Myriad.

“Number one expert versus Fiercest, who will win?” Curiosity was at an all-time high.

The unbeatable versus the undefeatable - a battle between these two would be immensely exciting.

“A contest between the young and the old, it will go down in history.” The ancestors themselves became excited, wanting for this to happen as soon as possible.

Regardless of the outcome, this fight will be one of the most famous in Myriad.

Li Qiye brought the group to a broken expanse. Stars collapsed in the sky, leaving behind meteorites. Planet-size celestial bodies were hanging in the sky as if they were dragged down.

The ground was ladened with bottomless pits. Some had lava oozing out while others burned to a crisp - as hot as a cauldron. One more location was filled with corrosive and murderous intent...

“Imperial Demise...” Bingning and Ximo were shocked by this apocalyptic location.

“A place of death, progenitors have died here too.” Longevity Sage sighed and said.

This place resembled hell, more than enough to instill fear into the spectators.

It was the most dangerous location of Moneyfall. Calling the land here would result in summoning some incredible monsters.

Rumor has it that Regalia Ancestor had summoned a terrible fiend in this land. They fought and tore the world and stars asunder. The Eternals nearby trembled with fear.

A progenitor’s wave alone could unleash havoc. However, Regalia was never seen again after this battle. People assumed it ended with his death. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

From then on, this place earned the name, Imperial Demise!

This infamy naturally came with skepticism. True Gods came to test it out and sure enough, none ever came out. Eternals and True Emperors suffered the same fate.

Due to the assured casualty, people stopped coming here. They wisened up and realized that coming here meant suiciding. Just mentioning the name of this place was enough to shock anyone.

Longevity Sage’s expression became serious as she stared at Li Qiye: “Are you sure? A progenitor has fallen here as well. There’s no coming out.”

Li Qiye laughed: “Isn’t my death a good thing for Longevity Valley? No need to pay back your debt then and still got a fire seed for free.”

She glared at him: “Nonsense, I want you to live. Plus, we have agreed to your demand.”

He smiled back: “I’m just teasing you. Don’t worry, no one can take my life, not even the villainous heaven.” He glanced at the sky afterward.

“I must go in.” He turned his profound gaze towards Imperial Demise: “This is the only path. I have done what I could beforehand.”

The sage sighed again. She didn’t know his reason for coming here, but it certainly wasn’t for treasure. The risk far outweighed the potential gain. He could find treasures in many other places.

“Very well.” She nodded: “Try to live. Otherwise, our valley pretty much robbed you blind.”

“Don’t worry, I won’t let anyone take advantage of me.” He said.

“Young Noble, please be careful.” Ximo mustered the courage to grab his hand and spoke softly.

“Come back alive.” Bingning glared at him - this could be considered her encouragement?

“It’s fine, the wicked lives forever while the kind-hearted dies early. Someone as bad as me is virtually immortal.” Li Qiye smiled and entered Imperial Demise without a care while the rest of the group watched with bated breath.
