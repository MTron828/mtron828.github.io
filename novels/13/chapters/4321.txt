Chapter 4322: Young Lord

They hurried off and prepared the best gifts possible in order to please Dragon.

Another interesting piece of news came during their preparation.

“I heard Gao Qixin’s entry to Dragon is confirmed.” An elder spoke to his friend: “Deer King is the one doing the introduction. A big shot will be taking him in, not just as an outer but rather, an inner disciple.”

“He’ll become an inner disciple of Dragon?” The small sects were shaken again.

“Maple Ravine is set for the future then, it’ll definitely prosper.” One sect master became jealous.

“Yes, given his talent, he could become someone important in the future, maybe a protector or even an elder.” Others shared the same sentiment.

The members of the small sects always had dreams of joining the behemoths. It would completely change their fate.

The small sects didn’t consider this poaching and in fact, encouraged it, hoping to ride the chosen disciple’s coattails.

In reality, this disciple could completely forget about their previous sect. Nonetheless, the sect’s neighbors would need to think twice before doing anything foolish. All in all, the benefits couldn’t be overstated.

“Send gifts to Maple Ravine, we need to try and have an audience with Young Noble Gao.” The small sects changed their plan because this was a more doable approach.

They compared Gao Qixin to Deer King, thinking that this had even more potential. Deer King started as an outer disciple and had limited authority. Nonetheless, the smaller sects certainly feared him. Both the Du and Eight Demons have benefited from his protection and help.

On the other hand, Gao Qixin had the potential of becoming a protector or elder in Dragon. Building a good relationship with him right now was of utmost importance.

A while later, one of the rumors was confirmed.

“The young lord of Dragon has arrived!” Most were shocked because they didn’t expect him to come so early. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I’m sure there are more big shots coming.” A sect master speculated.

The young lord’s arrival was too sudden and made everyone think that the conference this year was somehow special.

“Hurry, we need to greet him properly!” The disciples of the ward became as busy as can be.

Other small sects also dropped everything in order to join the ceremony. Thus, the base of the mountain range became bustling.

Numerous cultivators lined up outside in order to wait for the young lord. This was especially true for those from Dragon.

They wore ceremonial robes and stood in orderly formations. They were clearly trained well and intimidated everyone nearby.

“What an impressive display.” The youths were in awe after seeing so many people.

“We’re talking about the young lord of Dragon. It’s an honor to see him in person.” A sect master explained: “See that group over there? They’re outer disciples. If they somehow gain his attention, they might be able to become inner disciples instead and fly through the ranks.”

“It’s more than that. He’s the son of Peacock Monarch, his bloodline is extremely prestigious. He’s definitely the frontrunner for the successor position.” An old man from a small sect quietly said.

“Really? The future ruler of Dragon?” Listeners shuddered as a result.

“Yes, he has the crystal dragon bloodline. The current sect master of Dragon has high hopes for him.” A sect master said.

“So his chance of becoming the next sect master is rather high…” It didn’t take long before people forget about Gao Qixin and focus on the young lord instead.

This young lord’s official title was Crystal Dragon. His father was Peacock Monarch, the current sect master of Dragon.

Dragon was the second strongest sect in Southern Desolace. Some believed that it was catching up to Lion’s Roar in recent times due to the latter’s gradual decline. Joining his banner would guarantee a bright future.

“Deer King is right there.” Someone shouted and the crowd stared in that direction.

A middle-aged man walked out of the ward. His eyes were bright and he had a rather tiny antler growing from his head. There was a noteworthy aura exuding from him.

“Deer King.” Members of the smaller sects greeted him right away.

He was famous in this region, starting as a wild deer and eventually ending as an outer disciple of Dragon. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he could decide the fate of the smaller sects.

Walking behind him was none other than Gao Qixin. The youth walked proudly with his chest arched forward, looking quite spirited. After all, his dream of joining Dragon has come true.

With the help of Deer King, Gao Qixin might be able to make a good impression on the young lord. That would truly pave the way for success.

“Rumble!” Suddenly, explosions came from the horizon. Banners started becoming visible.

This group traveled with the might of a celestial legion. The area shook violently as a result.

The inexperienced youths became aghast after seeing this incredible display of power.

“So this is the style of a great power…” One of them took a deep breath and tried to calm his shaking knees.
