Chapter 5558: Golden Cycle Slash

“Raa!” However, the broken pieces came back together and the skeleton roared again.

“Oh? Let’s see what you can do then?” Niu Fen leaped into the air and increased his suppressive pressure.

Meanwhile, Qin Baifeng was occupied with taking down the other moving corpses and skeletons. She swung her blades in all directions, preventing them from moving closer to any mortal settlement.

Alas, as she dismembered and decapitated them, they still stood back up and became whole again, virtually unkillable.

As for Li Qiye, he focused on observing the frontier. He took one step forward and gave chase, appearing at the entrance of a deep valley.

The aura he was pursuing disappeared in this place. The skeletons and corpses fell to the ground, no longer empowered.

Niu Fen and Qin Baifeng stopped fighting and hurriedly flew to find Li Qiye.

“Open.” Li Qiye knocked on the entrance.

“Rumble!” Layers of defensive runes emerged all around the valley, looking impregnable. It had the form of a golden bell, preventing anything from getting through.

Li Qiye added a bit more power, channeling it to all the barriers.

“Rumble!” The world seemingly sank and layers started crumbling, unable to withstand Li Qiye’s assault.

“Clank!” The moment the valley became exposed, a golden circle manifested into reality and attempted to decapitate Li Qiye with an unstoppable force. Regular emperors and dao lords might not be able to stop it.

“Bam!” Li Qiye grasped it firmly with his bare hand. Even if the opponent wanted to pull back, he couldn’t move it an inch.

“Who are you?!” A voice came from a grotto inside the valley. Next, the light in the valley condensed together into a single beam.

The world seemed to be pushed back by the pulsing beam. The stars and sun paled in comparison to the brilliance stemming from the beam. It added a layer of gold to the entire region. This could pierce through the horizon and kill the gods.

Li Qiye didn’t try to block and allow the beam to hit his chest.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Boom!” The impact was akin to the explosion of a million stars but still couldn’t injure Li Qiye. Anyone witnessing this would be left speechless.

“Boom!” Li Qiye smashed downward and extinguished the beam instantly, severing the golden light and exposing someone.

He dragged the person out and smashed him into the ground. Once the dust settled, it turned out to be a skeleton.

It somehow inspired gasps of awe instead of fear. It resembled the skeleton of a twelve-year-old boy - golden from top to bottom. It had eyes that resembled gemstones.

However, the most eye-catching thing about this perfect skeleton was the ring of light above its head.

It exuded holiness and made others feel inferior. They would want to prostrate because this could be the halo of an angel, capable of purifying the mind and soul.

The skeleton possessed a heart as well, but instead of being a throbbing red heart, it was gray as if covered in dust. Nonetheless, a flickering red glow could be seen on the surface as if it was in the process of becoming a real heart.

Strands of tissues grew nearby in the chest cavity of the skeleton. They were gray as well and had a creepy smell of death, growing at a faster rate after the skeleton was taken down by Li Qiye.

The skeleton shouted and gathered energy to suppress the growing flesh.

“Who are you?!” After successfully stopping the growth, it looked up and shouted at Li Qiye.

“D-dark Crow?!” It became both frightened and excited to see Li Qiye: “No, Sacred Teacher, please help us!”

“Hahaha, golden bones, actually accepting defeat?” Niu Fen and Baifeng had arrived on the scene.

“Calamity!” The skeleton was surprised to see Niu Fen but focused on Li Qiye: “Sacred Teacher, can we count on you?”

“Fate again.” Li Qiye answered sentimentally.
