Chapter 5700: Easy To Make Accusations

“The guardian is still here!” Some were moved to tears after seeing her.

“Immortal Dao City didn’t abandon us!” An ancestor became overwhelmed with emotions.

Everyone knew the lord of Dao City - Luminous Conqueror. However, there was another comparable existence - Genesis Conqueror.

However, she stopped appearing after the closing of the gate. This made everyone think that she had left alongside Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan and Immortal Emperor Fei Yang, delving deeper into Immortal Dao City.

Contrary to speculations, it turned out that she had stayed behind instead.

This surprised her opponents. Why didn’t she show up during the previous invasion? Moreover, why did she stay around after the closing? There was no need to do so. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Guardian, kill the traitors!” Some survivors demanded blood.

“Kill them, they are a disgrace!” Others shouted angrily.

They were powerless to kill Luminous Conqueror but this was a different story for Genesis Conqueror.

In fact, members of West Bank called out for their progenitor’s death as well. They no longer recognized him as one of their own, only a dark stain of their history.

“You two indeed.” Genesis assessed the situation with a cold stare. However, she was surprised after seeing the immortal weapon.

“Just as speculated, your collusion with Celestial Court.” She said.

“Hahaha! It’s easy to make accusations now.” Luminous laughed.

“It is the truth.” Genesis said: “You became impatient.”

“Today wouldn’t have come if you all didn’t abandon us and close the gate. The dao limit path doesn’t belong to you alone, we are also members of The People who have toiled yet we were thrown away. This is just cause and effect, you forced our hands.” Luminous retorted.

Listeners exchanged glances, unaware of the so-called dao limit path. Nonetheless, they were curious about the reason behind his betrayal.

After all, they knew how Deity Dao turned him to ashes back in the lower continents. It took a miracle for him to survive. Therefore, his hatred toward Celestial Court must be greater than anyone else’s; he would be the last to join them.

Some found logic in his reasoning but the majority still sneered and viewed him as the biggest disgrace.

“Your collusion didn’t start today.” Genesis said.

“You didn’t consider me as one of your own, so why should I do the same?” Luminous said coldly: “Why are we prohibited from embarking on the path? Since you’ve taken the initiative, I had to come up with ways to do the same, what’s wrong with that?”

“Mere excuses. Celestial Court wouldn’t have trusted you enough for this maneuver without a long period of collusion.” Genesis said.

“What about me then?!” West Bank Prime Emperor roared: “I spent my life fighting Celestial Court, why was I not invited? Was my contribution insufficient? I paid the price for the sake of The People yet I was still abandoned. Very well, I will abandon the world then!”

He was livid about being left out of the event. No one told him anything before leaving on a new path.

“Unfortunately, you have failed the test.” Genesis shook her head and said with a tinge of regret: “You abandoned your initial aspiration and violated your promise, you betrayed your trusted allies and deserted The People.”

“I wouldn’t have done so without being abandoned first, hahaha!” West Bank laughed.

“I am still here.” She said: “If you had passed the test, the position of guardian or delve deeper, the choice was yours.”

“What do you mean?” His expression soured.

“Who says Immortal Dao City is permanently closed?” Genesis said; her words struck his chest like a hammer.

Various emotions took over him - rage and perhaps regrets.

Everyone understood the situation - Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan and Immortal Emperor Fei Yang’s group had indeed delved deeper into Immortal Dao City.

However, the closing of the gate was only temporary since Genesis Conqueror remained. At the very least, this was a test for the other apex cultivators - West Bank Prime Emperor being one of them.
