Chapter 5534: Three Thousand Battlefields

After the conversation with the beggar, Li Qiye looked around and said: "To the battlefield, shall we?"

A cute cloud landed next to him, looking around curiously. As for Niu Fen, he assumed a snail form with a full stealth barrier erected, looking pathetic and withered.

“What are you doing?” Li Qiye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry after seeing this.

Niu Fen peeked out of the shell like a thief and said: “Hehe, this is called keeping a low profile. Since I stand at the apex, my arrogance and power are too conspicuous and make others jealous, it’s best not to attract attention.”

“Please, this is just sad. They left already, you don’t have to do this.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Hehehe, I just don’t want to steal your limelight, Young Master. But honestly, you often hang around extraordinary folks. One of them might think that I’m tasty and make a meal out of me.” Niu Fen said.

“Hmm, boiled snail, doesn’t sound too bad. And a grand-completion dao lord too, must be extra tasty.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Young Master, that’s not funny.” Niu Fen hid back into the shell and said: “Look at my decrepit body, the meat will be tough and old, akin to biting wood.”

The cloud stared at Niu Fen curiously, wanting to know the reason for his appearance.

Li Qiye jumped on top of the snail and smiled: “To the ancient battlefield.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Alright, let’s go!” Niu Fen laughed and gathered his strength, instantly sprinting ahead.

As for the cloud, it kept up in a leisurely manner, just floating side by side with Niu Fen.

Niu Fen had learned from the previous encounter so it no longer tried to outrun the cloud, maintaining an acceptable pace instead.

They arrived at the largest battlefield of Immemorial Epoch War. Physical damages aside, the death of emperors and monarchs turned this land into something ominous. Not to mention regular cultivators, even the strongest ones had trouble crossing through.

Space was torn apart and time obliterated. Storms could be seen raging across the plains, capable of destroying anything.

Various majestic auras and emotions remained - still enraged in battle. Energies from swords and sabers were virtually permanent. Dao infernos couldn’t be extinguished. They continued to ravage the area and foolish intruders.

Rumor has it that it didn’t have this scale at the start. Numerous battles occurred and as the scale increased, they spread and formed a single battlefield.

It served as a barrier separating the world. The only way to get through was from a divine bridge stretching above the chaos.

“We just need to cross this battlefield and we’ll reach Immortal Dao City, the territory of The People.” Niu Fen said.

“They fought fiercely.” Li Qiye gazed at the scene.

“So many fell, Crimson, Can Long, Ba Zhen, Hu Yue, Brilliant Devil Emperor… all behemoths.” Niu Fen said.

This battlefield was the climax of Immemorial Epoch War and the resting place of many amazing cultivators.

The few survivors were known by all - World Emperor, Nether Emperor, Sword Emperor…

“It’s difficult to gather corpses given its current state.” Niu Fen said sentimentally.

The powers of the fallen emperors and monarchs remained. Since they used their strongest possible attack before death, the remnant forces didn’t dissipate after these eras.

Those capable of entering and purifying these powers didn’t want to expend the effort due to the lack of benefits. A divine bridge was built instead, bypassing the deadly battlefield.

The cloud stared at this awe-inspiring yet tragic scene with great curiosity.

“We’re entering.” Li Qiye jumped off Niu Fen and walked into the battlefield. The two hurriedly followed him.

“Boom!” Chaotic storms immediately greeted them with sheer destruction.

Moreover, since all affinities have been obliterated, the battlefield has become a maze of time and space.

Li Qiye became radiant while Niu Fen grew larger. Runes appeared around the cloud.

“Rumble!” Taking one step forward was difficult for most but Li Qiye left behind footprints imbued with primordial light. Each step stabilized space and time, preventing the storms from causing further damage.

“Boom!” Once they made it through, a dao inferno containing a golden imperial affinity greeted them in full force.
