Chapter 4899: Primal Dao

“Is this all you wanted to know?” Li Qiye stared at the dazed woman.

Jian Yunyun regained her wits but clearly hesitated from speaking more.

“I guess not.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“I don’t know.” She stared at the bonfire while replying: “I’ve only heard about it.”

He used a stick to move the wood around for the bonfire, patiently waiting.

“How do you know all of this, Young Noble?” She eventually asked because the top masters from her branch had no idea what the bone was.

However, Li Qiye deduced many things after holding it for just a short period. Due to his average appearance, some might think that he was spouting nonsense.

Alas, she personally witnessed the coronation and saw what he could do. Plus, as the conversation progressed, she figured that his comments were virtually truths. How could someone who knows all of this not be world-famous?

“A little reading, a little traveling, that’s all.” Li Qiye smiled.

“...” She remained skeptical but still took his word for it.

“You still have something else to ask me.” Li Qiye repeated.

In the end, she had to spill it: “We do have something else in Primal but I don’t have it with me. I’ve only read about it in the scroll, hence my limited knowledge.”

“What is it?” Li Qiye smiled.

She hesitated again, prompting him to say: “It’s alright, I won’t force you. I only wanted to help out of consideration for your ancestor.”

“You know our ancestors?” She was surprised because he didn’t appear old enough.

“Do you?” Li Qiye chuckled.

She didn’t actually know very much about the progenitor and the early forefathers of Primal.

“How do you know them, Young Noble?” She asked.

His eyes tilted down at her regalia, causing her to feel uncomfortable as if every inch of her flesh was exposed. This made her shudder and blushed.

He stopped and said: “Blacksmoke Regalia is a peerless treasure. Though its owner didn’t rely on it, it was still worn and favored for a long period.”

“I see…” She became emotional because Li Qiye knew too much about the outfit.

“Do you know about Primal’s origin, Young Noble?” She took advantage of this opportunity.

“Primal was most likely created in the lower three continents as a sentimental remembrance.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Your Alliance is absolutely older.”

Once again, he completely astounded her with his knowledge because currently, the Alliance was only a branch of Primal. Nonetheless, she also had this suspicion.

According to the historical text, Primal was in charge of numerous kingdoms and sects. The Alliance was a bit different, serving as a link between various powers and was in charge once.

“A remembrance for what?” She asked.

Li Qiye stared at the bonfire for a bit before responding: “Someone or something, or a vengeful feud.”

“I see…” She thought about the broken bone again after hearing this.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Young Noble, I do have something to ask but the item in question is not with me right now. I believe this matter pertains to the mythical bone.”

Li Qiye narrowed his eyes after hearing this.

“Are you aware of it, Young Noble? I am referring to the Dao Ancestor Bone.” She knew that she got the right person.

“Man search for it to no avail.” He smiled.

“No. It actually appeared before and caused quite a stir. Celestial Court, Immortal City, and Imperial Field all mustered their full strength. This resulted in a terrible war between conquerors, dao lords, and emperors.”

“Go on, I’m interested in this old tale.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“I don’t know much.” She said: “This is only a legend. In short, its appearance changed everything and an empress showed up to fight something monstrous. It’s all rather vague.”

“I see. The brat was on to something. And empress…” Li Qiye murmured before sighing.

Previously, Eight-stallion Dao Lord was searching for someone and ended up obtaining a drop of true blood. This was related to the mythical bone.

“What is your goal in telling me all of this?” He then asked.

“I don’t know. This is about our Primal’s patrimony treasure.” She revealed.

“And you don’t have it.” Li Qiye said.

“Right, no one has it right now but, one person knows of its whereabouts.” She hesitated for a bit before speaking.

“Who?” Li Qiye asked.

“Divine Empress Dowager, a supreme ancestor of our Alliance.” She said.

This was a being capable of sweeping through the lower continents since she had six sacred fruits. Alas, she was not seen for more than a thousand years now.

“You don’t know where she is.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, she has been missing.” She nodded and sighed. If the empress dowager was still around, the Alliance wouldn’t have declined to this level. A junior like her wouldn’t need to bear so much responsibilities.

“You should be asking your sect’s seniors, not me.” Li Qiye said.

She opened her mouth, wanting to say something. However, she noticed something and got up.

“Who?!” She roared; her eyes gazed deep into the wilderness.

“Whoosh!” A radiance illuminated the area with the force of a tsunami.

The trees nearby were uprooted instantly. The gales made it hard for cultivators to stand still.

A middle-aged man came closer; his aura had preceded him.
