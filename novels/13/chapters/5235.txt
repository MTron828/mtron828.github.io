Chapter 5236: This Does Not Belong In This World

Though the four alliances desired the order and thought that they could outbid Resplendent Monarch, they didn’t protect Boss Tang’s quick decision. This was just his business style.

He didn’t necessarily want the most precious treasure, only the right one.

“Okay, the final treasure, the one you all have been waiting for.” Boss Tang laughed and clapped again.

The participants quickly forgot about the matter of losing the order and became excited again.

“I wonder what it is.” Ancient ancestors and big shots speculated among themselves.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As for the participants, they readied themselves for the final act. At the very least, they were glad that five competitors have left, lessening the pressure.

Boss Tang brought forth an old tree. It was severely damaged and incomplete, missing a large part of the trunk. The remaining part barely supported the few small branches. Given the appearance of the scars and damages, this must have happened long ago. The roots were nowhere to be seen.

“Hmm…” The participants paid careful attention and felt something unique. This was a remnant aura beyond theirs - calling it “immortal” was not unreasonable.

“This is the immortal treasure?” Other ancestors weren’t at this level and couldn’t sense this faint aura.

“How disappointing.” One crowd member said.

They assumed that they were about to witness something never seen before. Now, this was just a broken tree.

“So this is an immortal tree? Why is it special?” Some still believed in Boss Tang’s merchandise.

After all, his reputation was flawless on the six continents. There was no reason to doubt his words.

“This does not belong to this world.” Omniscient Dao Lord stared at Boss Tang in disbelief.

“I can spend my whole life learning about this immortal tree.” The cold Jue Xian’er expressed her opinion.

“Won’t be your turn.” Celestial Stone Dao Lord said.

As for the three supreme geniuses, they also sensed that something strange was going on. Nonetheless, their senses weren’t as accurate compared to these accomplished cultivators.

During the auction, Li Qiye who was visiting Imperial Gate had a smile on his face. After all, he got to see the chariot and even the broken metal. He recognized all the treasures since they once belonged to him.

“Why is this here? What is going on?” However, his expression darkened the moment Boss Tang took out the old tree.

Two impossible events had happened - the appearance of the tree in this world and its broken state. The lord of Black Tides had mentioned this to him but he didn’t think that it had deteriorated to this level.

“I will give this tree a name now, Everlasting.” Boss Tang said with a smile.

“Are you implying what I think you are?” Xiao Qingtian asked hastily.

“It depends on if you have the ability to fix it. Perhaps not true immortality but a life long enough for you to get tired of living.” Boss Tang confidently said.

The old dao lords and conquerors exchanged glances. Even in their current state, they were still far from being able to reach this level.

“This tree can grant everlasting life.” The ancient ancestors among the audience had solemn expressions.

One could say that everlasting life was the ultimate pursuit of cultivation. All the apex cultivators spent their lives trying to obtain this goal.

“It can’t, not in this state.” Jue Xian’er said.

“Obviously. If it is capable of granting everlasting life, I would be keeping it for myself. If you wish to pursue this goal, you must mend it first. I have taken out the best possible merchandise, it is up to you all now.” Boss Tang said before sighing: “Time is not waiting for me, otherwise I wouldn’t be selling it right now.”

However, everyone stared at the broken tree and didn’t bid.

“Still not buying it?” Boss Tang smiled and said: “Fine, I will fascinate all of you with its wonders.”

With that, he channeled his power into the tree and shouted: “Activate!”

“Buzz.” The image of a divine tree appeared before everyone.

It poured down delicate strings of immortal dao that shine with a wonderful radiance. Upon closer inspection, the strings seemed to be made of countless minuscule worlds. The laws came together to form a totem - a world filled with endless life force.

Just this image alone shocked the spectators who thought that no other tree could compare to this one. Even the powerful participants felt as if they were floating up in the air while being basked in this immortal aura.

Keep in mind that their dao heart and mind were immensely stable. Alas, they were still carried away by the phenomenon, unable to maintain their composure.
