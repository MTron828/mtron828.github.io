Chapter 5299: The Opposite Of A Healthy Lifestyle

“Our Azure School considers protecting The People as our mission.” Xiao Qingtian defended his sect and master.

“Cowards who only care about their own personal grudges, don’t call this a mission. When we were fighting against Celestial Court, all of you were still playing in the mud.” Immortal Emperor Guan Feng sneered.

“He’s not wrong.” A crowd member said.

Some still recalled the contribution of these cultivators from the previous epoch. Although it was now the era of dao lords and conquerors, they still have yet to fully replace their predecessors.

Azure School and Illumination Conqueror were revered for their achievements against The Race. However, in the grand scheme of things, what they had done was inconsequential.

Countless emperors and monarchs of The People marched to the front line during Immemorial Epoch War. The current stalemate in the six continents was built on their flesh and blood.

Even apex cultivators lost their lives back then. Thus, what Illumination Conqueror had done was child’s play in comparison.

It wasn’t fair to compare Supreme’s current group to the apex emperors. Only those such as the duck egg buyer and Puresun Dao Lord were eligible.

Guan Feng and the others survived the previous wars so they weren’t afraid of the upcoming challenges.

“Why dwell on the past? Just hand over the sinners or we will flatten your sect.” Lantern Conqueror threatened with an army behind him.

“We don’t care about the sinners or whatever, hand over Moon Embrace. Divine Alliance should be the one keeping it.” Ferocity laughed, clearly stating his intention.

“The evil remnants of the heavener race must be exterminated. Otherwise, we will be letting down the wise sages who have sacrificed their lives for the great cause.” Heaven Hammer said sternly.

Many members of the audience snorted after hearing this. Of course, they didn’t wish to join the feud.

“Is this it? Just these few conquerors?” Someone laughed and the portal to Lesser Firmmanent opened for a split second, allowing a divine throne to fly out.

It was shrouded in an immense radiance, pouring down imperial laws unceasingly.

Everyone saw a youth dressed in a white robe with embroidered dragon patterns along the edges. He kept the top of his robe unbuttoned, showing off his muscular chest.

He was unreasonably handsome and held a golden cup filled to the brim with the finest wine. An enchanting beauty rested her head on his knees.

He exuded a temperament of dominance and freedom, not looking like a proper emperor in the slightest. The majority of the crowd had no idea who he was either.

“Immortal Emperor Yang Sheng!” Xiao Qingtian was one of the few who had an idea due to his impressive knowledge. [1]

“Doesn’t look like a healthy lifestyle.” The big shots were surprised to see the emperor so different from the title.

Hearing the characters in his title painted the image of a healthy grandpa - gray hair yet no wrinkles. It would also imply a focus on nurturing the mind and character for longevity.

However, this man had nothing to do with this concept, whether it be his age or his conduct.

Drinking and spending time with a beauty were the acts of a licentious young master. Maybe someone had misunderstood when giving him this title.

The crowd didn’t know that he was the second emperor of Myriad Bones Throne. Back during his era, he was rather meticulous regarding everything - his meals, clothes, conduct…

Everything was in harmony with the world and its flows. If acquaintances from back then could see him now, they would think that he was an entirely different person.

He gazed at the crowd while gently caressing the beauty’s head, not giving a damn about the opponents.

People didn’t know how to feel. Should they be jealous of his lifestyle or look down on his seeming lack of character?Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Anyone else wants to play or just Heaven, Divine, and Azure?” He finished his cup and the beauty immediately poured him another.

“Since you all wish to destroy my Lesser Firmament, I shall massacre you like pigs.” He laughed and was even more direct than Immortal Emperor Guan Feng.

The opponents’ expressions soured. Immortal Emperor Guan Feng and Skysword Dao Lord, at the very least, spoke while keeping their status in mind.

Yang Sheng, on the other hand, spoke like an uneducated young master, not caring about his own image or the other parties.

“Stop wagging your tails as if you’re someone important. Heaven Alliance only consists of Celestial Court’s hounds, don’t be arrogant. As for Azure School, a bunch of cowards with dead wives and destroyed sects gathering together. I spit on your so-called noble mission.” The emperor went on: “Since you talk so much about protecting The People, Celestial Court is still right there. Launch an expedition and kill Nether Heaven Emperor instead of bragging about your accomplishments.” He had a good time insulting the coalition.

Others exchanged glances. Normally, top cultivators were dignified. Dao mysteries came out of their mouth, not insults. This emperor looked more like a thug pulling up his sleeves in preparation for a street fight.

“I like it this way more.” A crowd member preferred this instead of using a hypocritical veil. Curse when unhappy, and take action when dismissed. Pretending to be gentlemen while aiming to destroy Lesser Firmament was needless.

“Brother Yang Sheng, please calm down.” A voice sounded as a golden river emerged and formed a path closer to Lesser Firmament.
