Chapter 5634: I Am Sindragon


“Raa!” The dragon struggled in a frenzy to no avail.

Li Qiye saw the blood bolts on the verge of turning into worms. He sighed and said: “You’re lucky to have met me.”

With that, he released dao flames that wrapped around the dragon. The blood bolts became afraid and wanted to run after seeing this terrible force.

However, there was no way to run since the entire dragon had been encapsulated by the flames.

Anything touched by them instantly turned to ashes. The rest tried to drill deep into the dragon’s body to avoid destruction.

Unfortunately, fiery strands and wisps also entered the dragon. It became a one-sided hunting game.

The flames reached every inch of the dragon and didn’t give up until the last of the blood was incinerated. It was only a matter of time before the end of this game.

The dragon couldn’t move while being under Li Qiye’s suppression. The pain caused it to bellow and groan in agony. If this continued, the dao flames would also roast it entirely.

The blood bolts eventually realized that running was futile. The remaining ones gathered together again, ready to detonate to take down both the dao flames and the dragon.

Li Qiye’s flames naturally didn’t let this happen. They coiled around the mass and burned it with haste, preventing the explosion.

“Ahh!” The dragon shouted, no longer groaning.

“Sacred Teacher, please show mercy!” It regained its sanity and spoke.

Li Qiye smiled and ordered the dao flames to disperse while also removing his pressure.

The dragon lay quietly in the vast ocean, emitting a savory fragrance. Others wouldn’t be able to help salivating and cutting down some meat for a hearty meal.

Li Qiye exercised restraint and finesse in just removing the blood bolts. Otherwise, he could have just obliterated everything and then eaten the roasted dragon afterward.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The dragon heaved a sigh of relief after surviving the horrendous disaster. His eyes became lucid again, no longer infected by the bolts and worms.

His aura and divinity returned during his recovery.

“Whoosh!” He soared into the sky and revealed his full form - a colossal azure rock dragon that seemingly existed since the start of time. His tough scales still showed the ravages of wind and rain.

It brimmed with strength. Just one claw smash alone could destroy a continent. He resembled the ruler of the sky while soaring in the air.

“Bam!” He landed and assumed a human form. He prostrated in front of Li Qiye and said: “Sacred Teacher, thank you for saving my life. I would have become a puppet, damned for the ages.”

This form was a youth wearing short sleeves and short pants, displaying his well-defined muscles. He wore gold loops around his arms, looking robust and fierce like a hot-headed youth.

Despite his outward appearance, his imperial aura couldn’t be fully contained despite his best attempts. Even a remnant strand seemed capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas.

“It is fate.” Li Qiye said.

“This junior’s name is Sindragon. I have heard of your legends back in Imperial Attendant City and have nothing but the utmost respect for you, Sacred Teacher. It would be my honor to work for you and be your mount.” The youth said.

“Sindragon Dao Lord.” Li Qiye said.

“At your command.” He turned back into his dragon form and crouched before Li Qiye.

Sindragon came from Eight Desolaces. Rumor has it that he was an evil dragon at first, causing trouble everywhere.

Eventually, he was subdued by the sacred ancestor of Divine Dragon Valley and became the latter’s disciple.

He changed entirely after joining this sect, only searching for the dao afterward. Eventually, he became a dao lord and left part of his legacy there.

He ascended to the six continents and founded Hundred Dao with Peacock, Bones, and Divine Luan Dao Lord. They worked for Imperial Attendant City.

Once he reached the immortal continent, he joined Imperial Field and resided in Thousand Emperor Island.

Li Qiye jumped and landed on the dragon: “Rather lucky to not die here, I suppose it is due to your relatively strong dao heart as well.”

“My arrogance was the cause of this.” Sindragon smiled wryly and recalled: “Thousand-hand Dao Lord disappeared after entering this place so I came as well, wanting to see its mysteries. Initially, I found that the bolts could strengthen my body, so that’s what I did for a long while. I completely forgot about my initial goal.”

He paused and sighed before continuing: “I didn’t expect the bolts to secretly multiply in my body. Once it became apparent, I could no longer expel them.”

“You used these blood bolts to craft your body so you became their breeding ground, expulsion was impossible.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Right, I was too greedy, Sacred Teacher. I realized that it was outside of my control so I lay still in the ocean, using the rest of my strength to hinder these creatures’ growth. This turned out to be futile, these terrifying things didn’t stop. If it wasn’t for you, Sacred Teacher, I would have become an ugly worm dragon forever.” He shuddered after recalling the things squirming on top of his scales and inside of him.

“It wouldn’t have taken long.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, you came just in time, Sacred Teacher, you gave me a new life.” He felt lucky at the timing.
