“Die.” Li Qiye uttered only one word.

With that, he reached straight for the barrage of feathers. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Clank!” The feathers turned even brighter with a surging sword intent, nearly able to pierce through the ground to the very core.

This dominating attack horrified the crowd. If this falcon was already this strong, just how mighty would its master be?

Moreover, Li Qiye’s choice of retaliating with his bare hand astonished them as well.

“Will he be able to handle it? His hand is finished!” Many felt that the flesh couldn’t win against the feathers.

“Boom!” Contrary to their expectations, no blood was spilled.

His hand was perfectly fine despite the sharpness of the feathers.

He closed his hands and crumbling noises ensued.

The two wings of the bird were as tough as steel but as the swords shattered, so did they.

Before anyone could react, he grabbed its wing. The frightened falcon wanted to soar upward but it was too late for the grip was impossible to escape.

“Boom!” He lifted the entire bird with one of its wings and slammed it down on the ground, destroying several mountains in the process.

“Screech!” The bloodied falcon retaliated by using its claws and beak with lightning speed, carrying enough force to pierce through the sky vault.

Li Qiye ignored the counter and raised his foot, gathering a golden light at the bottom before stomping down.

“Crack!” Both claws and the beak disintegrated.

“As I have said, you’re nothing more than a little bird.” Li Qiye smiled and grabbed the bird’s other wing.

“Oooo-” Li Qiye ripped both of its wings apart. Blood gushed from the wounds, leaving the falcon laying in a pool of its own blood.

It had lost its stalwart and awe-inspiring aura, on the verge of death. All of this happened so quickly; the crowd was caught entirely off guard.

He stood on the bird while still holding its gigantic, severed wings. Though his expression remained calm, his domineering aura was anything but.

The mount of an Eternal has been taken down in such a brutal manner.

“You court death!” The sky seemingly exploded with a wrathful threat!

“Boom!” A palm descended from the sky.

Even before it came down, the area below it turned into a void. Lava gushed out from the nearby volcanoes. The spectators began to scream since some were dying from the pressure.

Ordinary True Gods felt that they were more insignificant than ants. Ascenders would be scared out of their mind; their first reaction would be to flee.

The falcon god in his fury wished to flatten Myriad Peaks. His palm heralded a cataclysmic scene. His rage was understandable. The falcon has followed him for so long, acting as his trusted confidant.

“Scram.” Li Qiye shouted and countered with a punch.

His golden fist wasn’t large but it carried the ultimate force in the world - raw power of the yang affinity.

Primordial chaos emerged as a result. Everything turned to ashes.

“Boom!” A rain of blood gushed out along with a moan. Li Qiye’s punch annihilated the falcon god’s palm.

The latter’s fingers were crushed completely. The pain caused him to groan.

“Crack!” Next, Li Qiye stomped again. The falcon’s large frame caved downward.

“Ooo-” The bird cried again while struggling to escape but it was too late. Its body turned into mincemeat from the force. Its master had failed to save it.

The world was robbed of sound; only the breathing of the spectators could be heard. So many people became slack-jawed, including the strongest beings around.

Li Qiye had crushed the mount of an Eternal into a gory paste before everyone - a scene establishing his hegemony. Who else in the world would dare to do something like this?

“Little animal, I won’t forgive you!” This roar destroyed dozens of mountains nearby.

A figure materialized in the sky - an old man wearing a cloak. Normally, he would look like a sage with a feathered fan and a silk cloth hairband, but now, his expression was twisted with rage. His pair of eyes were as bright and hot as two suns, wanting to burn everything in sight.

He was naturally the strongest ancestor of Cloudcrossing System - the falcon god!

His title was largely due to his great mount. It had done many things for him with its incredible gifts, so people started calling him the falcon god. Even if he could find a similar falcon later, it wouldn’t be able to replace this dead one. His title as the falcon god was done for.

He loved the bird since it was his lifelong companion. Rage became insanity and hatred directed at Li Qiye.

A tempest of wind and sand arrived. The sky turned dark just like a scene of the apocalypse. The spooked spectators didn’t have the strength to stand straight. The ancestors from various systems took a deep breath. An Eternal could certainly sweep through the world and destroy everything in his path.
