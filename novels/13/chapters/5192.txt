Chapter 5193: Monumental Effort Of Past

“The momentum of the nine worlds is meticulously embedded into the array. Adding one more thing will create an opening.” Li Qiye added.

“Then what should we do? If I can augment the array, maybe there is a chance of fighting evenly with Suppression. Otherwise, he’ll take advantage of the same flaws.” Resplendent asked.

“I think we have no chance of winning this time.” Gourdkeeper sighed: “We haven’t produced any supreme genius recently while our old bones just can’t improve anymore.”

“We can only count on Jadecure Conqueror’s pill-refinement skill.” Resplendent sighed without confidence.

“I guess so, I’m not optimistic since Suppression will ask for help as well.” Gourdkeeper said.

“We just need a cauldron of Time-honed Longevity Pill, that’s the most important thing.” Resplendent thought about another option.

“Yes…” Gourdkeeper seemed to have something on his mind but refrained from speaking.

“Winning what?” Li Qiye asked the two.

They exchanged glances and Resplendent eventually spoke: “Please don’t laugh, this is an internal political struggle in Imperial Attendant.”

“Oh? Go on.” Li Qiye was interested.

“The first lord of Imperial Attendant was none other than Lord Zi Yan from Imperial Gate.” Resplendent said: “Historically, all of us believed that Imperial Gate was the main branch.”

“Our Alchemy Dao, Iron Tree, Qilin Manor, and some others are responsible for protecting the city. The actual authority resides with Imperial Gate.” Gourdkeeper said.

Many believed that the two great pillars of Imperial Alliance included Cleansing Incense Dynasty and Imperial Attendant City.

The city lord and many of the founding members of Imperial Attendant fell during Grand Dao War. The survivors such as Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor remained for a period before leaving.

This drastically weakened the city’s fighting force. Nonetheless, it persevered until Imperial War.

Caparace Conqueror guarded the gate against the horde long enough for reinforcement to come before passing away.

Subsequently, Peerless Monarch took over Imperial Attendant City until her last years when she returned the rule back to Imperial Gate.

Imperial Gate still viewed her as one of them since she had fought with City Lord Zi Yan and the wise sages in the past.

She was the last founding member of the first generation. Her selfless act returned the reins back to Imperial Gate; she had no intention of letting Qilin Manor take over.

Relative stability continued until the appearance of Suppression Conqueror - a member of Hundred Dao.

This was a great power in the city but didn’t have an intertwining history like the others. Alchemy Dao, Iron Tree, and Imperial Gate all considered themselves a part of Imperial Attendant. The same couldn’t be said about Hundred Dao.

It was started by Bones Dao Lord. Firebird, Peacock, and Sindragon Dao Lord joined afterward. Thus, this boosted the sect to a level strong enough to overwhelm the others near the city.

However, because of the wise sages and Peerless Monarch during that period, the dao lords still obeyed the rules of Imperial Attendant. They certainly contributed greatly during all the wars.

Later on, the dao lords left while Imperial Attendant City suffered a decline. Suppression Conqueror changed everything afterward.

All along, Imperial Gate has been in charge since there was a mission. The other main branches focused on this mission and guarded the city, leaving Imperial Gate to rule.

As mentioned previously, Peerless Monarch only temporarily took over due to the crisis during Imperial War. Suppression Conqueror didn’t share this belief.

Through clever interpretation of the rules, he managed to seize authority from Imperial Gate. Though the others wished to stop this, they couldn’t stop the conqueror with eleven fruits.

“Suppression has overstepped his authority.” Gourdkeeper concluded: “Though it is almost time for the next election, we still need to defeat him.”

“Why does it matter who is in charge?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Young Noble, you may not know but Imperial Attendant has a noble mission. As for Suppression, he has no intention of following this path. The city will no longer be the same if we can’t retake sovereignty.” Resplendent shook his head.

“In my opinion, Suppression is rather ambitious and wishes to move against Imperial Alliance. I do not wish to see the city being used as a tool of war. Our city’s very reason for being will turn into ashes.” Gourdkeeper lamented.

The mission was to survive and wait for a legend to return. Alas, Imperial Attendant was at risk of no longer being the same under Suppression’s leadership.

“I cannot watch the effort of the wise sages go to waste.” Resplendent said bitterly.

Their group of ancient ancestors had tried their best but Suppression was simply too strong now.

“You had a chance with Resplendent Array but now, he has eleven fruits.” Gourdkeeper said.

“I must fix the flaws or it is truly impossible. Even then, it’s not a sure thing.” Resplendent said.

“Give me the tree.” Li Qiye stared at them and said.

“Young Noble?” Resplendent was surprised.

“I will recraft the array. Because the momentum is fixed due to lacking resources, it will never become as strong as the real nine worlds, there is still room for improvement.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“You can change the array?” Resplendent couldn’t believe it.

“It’s an easy task since it’s a small array.” Li Qiye said.
