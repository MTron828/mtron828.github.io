Chapter 4834: Finality Sword

The palm aimed to destroy Li Qiye’s grand dao and all karmic ties. No one could reach Dead Immortal’s level in duplicating the high heaven.

Meanwhile, Undying Lord burned his epoch true blood. The dagger’s power intensified and traveled all the way back to Li Qiye’s birth, wanting to erase him from existence. An entire epoch passed by in the blink of an eye.

As for the abyssal lord, he channeled the power of his entire epoch for an ultimate attack. A portal appeared and trapped him, hoping to seal him in this destroyed epoch forever. It dragged and pulled him closer with a force that made the sword domain shake violently.

Though the sword domain’s purpose was to protect Eight Desolaces and stop the combatants from escaping, it couldn’t contain everything once the battle started.

Strands of epoch energy still oozed out. Therefore, a calamity seemed to be taking place. Living beings could only pray that this wouldn’t get worse. 

This triple-pronged attack aimed at the current Li Qiye along with his past self during his most vulnerable period. Of course, he wouldn’t sit there waiting to die.

“Clank!” Nine sword hymns could be heard echoing on the river of time. They combined together to form a single dao.

Time, space, and all laws fused together and became one with this sword dao. They rotated and folded upon each other, twisting the fabrics of reality. A second became as long as a million years; an inch of space became as large as three thousand worlds; strings of laws were woven together to form a supreme chapter.

“Finality!” His voice echoed. This sword dao was the final destination of all dao - a perfect fusion of all nine swords and dao.

Weapons, laws, techniques - all would have to stop before it. This naturally included the palm of the high heaven, the flying dagger, and the power of an entire epoch.

They all stopped without warnings. Though the temporal dagger could cross through an epoch, an epoch was but a small crease of Finality. The great palm could only compare to one word of the supreme chapter, the same for the epoch attack.

This was the final profundity of a Heavenly Scripture and a Heavenly Treasure - everything ended here.

“Clank!” Li Qiye then deactivated the reality twist and unleashed a slash.

The three overlords couldn’t possibly stop the slash despite their epoch power and understanding of the grand dao. Epoch paragon weapons found themselves sorely inadequate.

“Ahh!” Their screams echoed on the river of time.

Undying Lord’s armor and body dispersed along with his death energy. The latter turned into the purest worldly essences that pour down into Eight Desolaces. Anyone who breathed them in would have a much longer lifespan and significantly-improved cultivation.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Dead Immortal’s liquid body flowed down into the world. Endless life force seeped into the earth and turned the land into a paradise. Living creatures also gained immense life force.

The abyssal lord was reduced to ashes. His flesh and blood along with his true fate turned into a collapsing ocean. Tsunamis spread out and engulfed Eight Desolaces, also nourishing them for eras to come.

Only three bright particles were left from the battle. These were the final remnants of their true fate. As long as there was still something left, they could heal again.

These particles tried to fly away and hide in the deepest crevices of the mortal realm. Alas, they couldn’t elude Li Qiye’s eyes.

Tribulation Sword came from above and extinguished them, one by one. This was the end of three overlords. Their dao essences and blood became nourishment for Eight Desolaces and its inhabitants.

Other overlords felt a chill after the end of the battle. Something was made obvious today - opposing Li Qiye meant becoming fertilizer for his epoch.

“Boom!” The Primordial Tree appeared and exuded rays to every corner of Eight Desolacse, whether it be the most remote region or the deepest abyss. 

The towering tree granted shelter to the whole world. It was impossible for the other overlords to run since the tree has spotted them.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye raised his hand and revealed the supreme chapter of his epoch.

“Heed my warning, overlords! Two paths lay before you. Either engrave your true fate into this chapter and be one with the epoch or I will slay you now to nourish it.” Li Qiye’s voice could be heard by all.

The overlords took a deep breath after hearing this. This demand meant tying them together with Eight Desolaces. The destruction of the epoch meant their own; its prosperity would also benefit them.

The alternative was being hunted down by Li Qiye.
