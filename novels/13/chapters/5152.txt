Chapter 5153: Declaration

Meanwhile, Thunderspear led his forces with the help of formations in order to break the swords in the air.

The more he fought, the stronger he became. He didn’t let down his master in this crucial moment.

“Clank!” His rampage was met by a godly slash from above.

Despite being empowered by a grand formation, he still couldn’t stop it and was sent to the ground while vomiting blood.

“Soaring Sword Monarch!” The neutral spectators recognized him right away.

The ancestors of Windchaser became alarmed since the opponent had six sacred fruits.

“Break!” The monarch raised his hand and channeled incredible sword energies to form a heavenly sword.

The ground shook violently while his opponents activated their defensive formation to the limit.

“Rumble!” The barrier crumbled before the slash. Mountains were disintegrated first due to their height, next came the palaces.

“That slash is enough to destroy a sect.” One spectator said. Relying on a conqueror barrier alone couldn’t stop him.

“Enough!” A gray-haired old man leaped out from one of the palaces. His hair fluttered chaotic to the wind as he released his five sacred fruits.

“Windchaser Lord, the conqueror’s senior brother!” Others recognized him as well.

He chanted and became shrouded in a golden radiance, the same for the entire sect. All of the rays gathered around him and boosted his power to the next level. The area around him cracked from the pressure.

“Blessed by the conqueror.” Everyone understood that this was an ace card left behind by Windchaser Conqueror.

Windchaser Lord relied on this empowerment and his five sacred fruits to stop the incoming slash.

“Boom!” After successfully dispelling the energy slash, he roared and released a solar punch against the monarch.

“Come accept your death!” The monarch laughed and summoned an ocean of swords against the punch.

“The monarch is rather strong.” A spectator praised.

Though Windchaser Hall had the locational advantages, the monarch had no problem continuing the assault.

“He’s known as the hound leader for a reason. As far as I know, Supreme had even taught him before so he’s unstoppable at the same level.” A dragon lord said.

“Rumble!” Although Windchaser Hall had commendable leaders, they wouldn’t be able to last long against the sword formations sending unceasing barrages downward.

“Where is Windchaser Conqueror? Why isn’t he back?” A big shot from The People worried, not wanting this territory to fall to Heaven Alliance. That would be the start of an invasion.

At this moment inside the small courtyard, Windchaser Conqueror’s brows furrowed as he glanced at the sky.

“Boom!” Another attacker threw a sword directly through the barrier and nearly pierced Windchaser Lord’s chest.

“Heavenly Sword Godmonarch!” Everyone saw a high-spirit youth descending with a bright world behind him.

His aura alone suppressed the opponents and made them vomit blood. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Heavenly Sword’s leader is here too!” Someone shouted.

Heavenly Godmonarch was a supreme genius - younger than Windchaser Conqueror yet already possess seven sacred fruits.

In the upper continents, dragon lords with twelve fruits weren’t rare. However, his young age made his accomplishment exceptional.

“I shall destroy Windchaser Hall today.” His eyes pulsed with lightning, ready to crush the opposing sect.

The members of Windchaser didn’t know what to do. They had to do everything just to stop Soaring Sword Monarch. The newcomer was even stronger.

“They need their conqueror now.” The big shots commented.

“Come out, Windchaser Conqueror!” Heavenly Sword Godmonarch thunderously challenged.

***

“Hmph.” Windchaser Conqueror’s eyes brimmed with murderous intent.

“Fellow Daoist, let us know if you need assistance.” The middle-aged man took advantage of this opportunity.

“I’ll keep that in mind.” Windchaser stood up and bowed toward the duo before flying into the air.

***

“Boom!” An unceasing aura of a conqueror emerged above Windchaser Hall.

Tornados manifested into the air and tore apart the sword formations.

“Ahh!” With their grand formations gone, experts from Heavenly Sword School were caught and torn apart by the tornados.

“Conqueror!” The survivors of Windchaser became ecstatic.
