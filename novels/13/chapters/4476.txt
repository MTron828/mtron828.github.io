Chapter 4477: Golden City

Visitors and citizens came and went, only the city remained. Golden was older than many great powers in Eight Desolaces.

Numerous reasons were attributed to its long-lasting success. First was freedom. Anyone could have a place here, provided that they had enough money to back it up.

Another stated that this was because Golden was close to Inner Ruins. The dangers hidden in the ruins made it difficult for others to wage war. Thus, even top cultivators refrained from doing anything here.

There existed certain rules as well. They were inviolable and protected Golden from any troublemaker.

Of course, the most popular theory talked about the islands above the city. They served as a pillar and kept the city safe from harm.

All in all, it was a popular place for cultivators to visit. This made it rather prosperous with more buildings and markets built. Therefore, it became a paradise for those with money. As long as they had enough in their pocket, they could find the right merchandise here.

Moreover, this was a place of possibilities as well. A random merchant on the street could turn out to be a famous monarch. An old man in the valley could have been a notorious cultivator. A salted vegetable stand could actually be the property of Lion’s Roar…

Some enjoyed the bustling life in Golden enough to forget their way home. This was especially true for newcomers from humble backgrounds.

Li Qiye’s group arrived near the city and could see the great walls and rolling mountains. They noticed massive palaces and pavilions floating in the air.

Each place had a different visual phenomenon. A mountain range had an auspicious glow while a floating palace had a divine one. Rainbows could be seen in the air as well.

People and carriages came from all directions. Massive beasts, flying cultivators, chariots… An inexperienced cultivator would be shocked to see this scene.

They would be impressed to see the various races as well - ghosts covered in black clouds, heavenly devils with their signature black radiance, and other strange demons. Even the elusive sky spirits could be seen as well. Awe-inspiring spectacles were common in Golden. This was a great world with no end in sight.

“Golden, the never-falling city.” Wise Ancestor became sentimental.

He was emotional because in the past, their four clans had properties here as well. Alas, they eventually lost the ability to run these businesses, hence the need to sell them.

Today, they no longer had a place to stay in Golden.

“The city is okay, what I really want to visit is that city in the sky.” Jian Ming smiled and stared upward.

A blinding radiance occupied the air with waterfall-like rays pouring down. Massive islands were floating a million miles above the city. From the ground, they looked as big as fists.

When spectators activated their heavenly gaze, they saw magnificent scenes. Rays poured down and served as curtains, completely shielding the islands.

Nonetheless, they could see towering trees on the islands, looking like umbrellas to block the sun rays. The islands, rays, and trees were divine, rendering it impossible for anyone to come close.

They were protecting the ancient palaces and architectures. These things also emitted supreme dao laws.

These were known as Golden Isle. Any cultivator looking up would feel nothing but respect and fear.

“Ridiculous!” Wise Ancestor smacked the youth’s head and scolded: “Are you tired of living? Your old geezer would be the first to tie you up and ask for forgiveness.”

“Hehe, I’m just curious and want to take a look.” Jian Ming laughed.

“Only a selected few are eligible to be invited for an audience.” Wise said.

Golden Isle never participated in outside events. Nonetheless, all of Eight Desolaces still feared it. It seemed to prefer isolation, not even interfering with the prosperous city beneath and viewing it as their property. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Hehe, Ancestor, I heard you were invited before, tell me more.” Jian Ming’s eyes lit up.

“It’s nothing, I was only there as a crowd member.” Wise said without pride: “No one dares to be arrogant there, not even the sect master of True Immortal.”

“Haha, that’s understandable.” Jian Ming said: “Who ended the Blessed Era? Who else but the invincible Emperor Ye, easily dominating True Immortal Sect during their golden age. They didn’t even dare to fart in the emperor’s presence.” [1]

“You need to watch your words.” Wise glared at the youth, causing him to only chuckle and stop talking.

Everyone knew this story but they didn’t want to talk about it lest they offend True Immortal Sect.

1. Ye means leaf, so it could be Leaf Emperor ?
