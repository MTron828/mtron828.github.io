Chapter 5654: Filial Grandson, You’re Finally Here

“You’re not getting away this time, Fellow Daoist.” San Dao spoke chillingly, making listeners feel as if his blade was mere inches from their neck.

The two of them saw Violet Abyss first. Qing Xuan’s expression became serious as he said: “So you’re staying here, Fellow Daoist.”

Next, they looked over at Li Qiye and became startled, staggering one step backward.

“Looks like you haven’t forgotten this old acquaintance.” Li Qiye smiled at them.

The two of them exchanged glances, having a similar relationship as War God and Just-once Dao Lord.

“Sacred Teacher.” Qing Xuan had a serious expression.

Future generations had little knowledge of Li Qiye, only hearing a few legends here and there. Qing Xuan was different - he knew Li Qiye and his merciless tendencies.

No one could escape death, not even emperors and monarchs. He had massacred plenty of them during the previous epoch.

“Long time no see, Sacred Teacher.” San Dao, despite his fame, dared not to be presumptuous and domineering before Li Qiye.

“Unfortunately, Azure Mysterious is already annihilated. Otherwise, engaging in a battle there would have been interesting.” Li Qiye commented.

The two of them felt nothing about its destruction, only thinking about the possibility of fighting Li Qiye.

“That’s fine, they’re just ignorant descendants.” Qing Xuan said.

Just like many others, time erased his feelings and attachments to his kingdom despite having spent painstaking efforts during its inception.

He left the nine worlds long ago but even if he hadn’t, his descendants there would eventually become strangers to him.

Without Li Qiye’s involvement, someone else could have destroyed it, not to mention the grand calamity.

“You know what will happen today, right?” Li Qiye asked them.

The two of them pondered in silence. They had no qualms about attacking anyone standing in their way, Violet Abyss included.

Alas, nothing good could come from attacking Li Qiye.

“Sacred Teacher, we have no intention of opposing you.” San Dao said: “There is no feud between us so we won’t risk our lives for nothing.”

“Whilst there is indeed no feud between us, I will have to kill the two of you if you stay in Celestial Court.” Li Qiye smiled at them.

The two of them became frozen and staggered backward again. After all, they had enough knowledge of Li Qiye to fear him.

“Sacred Teacher, it is different now.” Qing Xuan shook his head: “With a returning guest, Celestial Court will become unstoppable and dominate this era. We are merely obeying the inevitable.” [1]

“Did you two ever obey the inevitable when you were younger? Weren’t you going against the heaven?” Li Qiye remarked.

The two had no response. Long back then, they started as young juniors and eventually became Immortal Emperors. They were insects who once faced behemoths but never relented.

“Bam!” Their rumination was interrupted by the arrival of another man with a piercing aura of despair. It engulfed the air and made others feel as if their heart was being pierced by ten thousand swords.

“Filial grandson, you’re finally here.” War God laughed after seeing him.

This was not a mockery attempt because, in terms of seniority and blood ties, War God was indeed Just-once’s ancestor. [2]

“Ancestor, do you have the strength to fight again?” Just-once scouted the scene; his eyes narrowed after seeing Violet Abyss and Li Qiye.

However, he came from Daoist Sword Ground and shared the same love for battle as his ancestor. He didn’t have the same hesitation as Qing Xuan and San Dao.

“Not today, we’ll play again later.” War God laughed, not minding Just-once’s life choices.

Other ancestors would be indignant and furious after having a descendant join Celestial Court and try to kill them - an unfilial act of defiance and immorality, a betrayal of their roots. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

However, War God didn’t hold this against Just-once.

“Celestial Court wants your life so we have to take your head back, Ancestor.” Just-once responded.

“Unfortunately, I want to live today, so you should drop the idea and scram. I’ll kill you when we next meet.” War God waved his hand dismissively.

“Come strike me already, Ancestor.” Just-once demanded, feeling no shame in attempting to kill his ancestor.

“Next time, next time.” War God waved again as if shooing a fly away while laughing boisterously.

The trio exchanged glances. Qing Xuan shook his head, clearly not wanting to start a fight.

Just-once looked over at Li Qiye and felt the urge to fight. Nonetheless, he quelled this idea.

“Very well, next time, Ancestor.” Just-once bowed at him first before doing the same toward Violet Abyss and Li Qiye: “Sir, Fellow Daoist, apologies for the uninvited visit. Goodbye.”

He left afterward, not caring about anything outside of advancing his sword dao.

“Sacred Teacher, goodbye.” Qing Xuan and San Dao didn’t want to die today.

“If I see you two at Celestial Court, I’ll have to kill you then.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

The two paused for a moment before San Dao responded: “We hope that we don’t have to oppose you, Sacred Teacher.”

With that, they disappeared into the horizon.

War God dropped to the ground immediately and started healing. Rapid improvements could be seen since he was an apex dao lord. However, complete recovery required a lengthy period.

“Thank you, Fellow Daoist and Sir.” After a while, he stood up and bowed.

1. Singular or plural is unclear with guest ?

2. If you are on chapter 5654 of ED, you have probably read enough CN novels to know that calling someone “grandson” is a joke/insult ?
