Chapter 5106: Am I Early?

Mountain of the Ages was actually the name of a lineage. Of course, such a mountain existed but whenever people brought this title up, they were talking about the lineage in Reincarnation.

It was started by Blazing Conqueror as the main sect for Reincarnation. Thus, it had resources left behind by the great conqueror.

There were several notable conquerors hailing from the lower continents. For example, Luminous, Heaven Burial, Demon Conqueror…

They were brilliant and could compete with the best of them. However, the richest was none other than Blazing Conqueror. 

In fact, even conquerors born with a golden spoon from the immortal continent couldn’t compare to Blazing. Deity, Heaven Alliance, Divine Alliance, all else paled compared to him.

Yes, a single person was richer than an entire alliance. Rumor has it that the conqueror might be richer than the three lower continents combined.

Thus, due to his wealth, he never lacked beauties and friends. Princesses and other conquerors all wanted to have a good relationship with him. Wealth was the ultimate charisma.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This allowed the members of Reincarnation to have access to incredible treasures. During his generation, a regular disciple from there was wealthier than an ancestor from Deity. A vestige of this could still be seen in Mountain of the Ages. 

The second notable character from this region was Greenmountain Conqueror, the second to reach this cultivation realm.

He was a supreme genius but after obtaining the first dao fruit, he rarely showed himself and became nearly forgotten. After obtaining the fourth, he ascended to the upper continents.

Thus, he left a stronger impression on the world during his youth than when he was a conqueror. There was no battle record to be proud of after reaching the top while he fought numerous rivals previously. Now, he was back with eight dao fruits - a testament to his ability.

Meanwhile, numerous ancient ancestors and dragon lords waited outside Reincarnation. As for its members, they wisely retreated because this would be a devastating battle.

Today was the day of the battle. Its location was a majestic mountain range located in Reincarnation.

Every inch of land brimmed with divinity, still lingering with traces from the treasures of Blazing Conqueror.

Some looked back and saw a magnificent city - Reincarnation City, founded by Timewatcher Conqueror.

Alas, the current city was in disarray after losing its lord and became a headless snake. Qing Songke shouldered the responsibility of keeping it together.

Though Mountain of the Ages didn’t have the highest peak, it was now more special than any other mountain. This was due to a particular man standing on it - Greenmountain Conqueror.

With his presence, the peak became infinitely tall and unreachable. His aura was second to none.

Spectators observed him with different emotions. Some from the same generation as him had complicated emotions.

Even dragon lords who were close to him could only sigh since they were from The People. They once drank and learned the dao together, fighting their rivals from The Race.

The young conqueror was a lively youth and befriended everyone in the academy. Today, he had joined the other side, whether it be Heaven or Divine Alliance.

Those who called him “brother” once found this regrettable. Of course, they didn’t say anything for he was no longer their friend but rather, an imperious conqueror of The Race.

“Buzz.” He suddenly opened his piercing eyes.

“Am I early?” A lazy voice could be heard as if the speaker was still drowsy.

“Li Qiye’s here.” Spectators became excited right away.

“Just him alone?” Ancient ancestors from The People worried since they didn’t see anyone else.
