Chapter 5433: With The People

Illumination still thought about the people with his last breath. Alas, the crowd didn’t read the situation quite the same way. This was absolutely a heroic and stirring moment if it came from anyone other than him.

Nonetheless, this could still be a legendary tale for the mortals with certain embellishments added. Songs could be sung regarding a cultivator who fought for his people, eventually sacrificing his life. He paid the ultimate price without thinking twice. Was there anyone more heroic than him?Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

This happened often in history due to the missing pieces and inaccurate accounts. Devils could be remembered as heroes and vice versa.

This applied in Illumination’s case, especially at the beginning of his cultivation path. Many regarded him as a hero and a protector, fighting against Heaven Alliance for the sake of The People. In reality, his closest allies at that time knew otherwise, hence their eventual turn against him.

The strongest cultivators in the crowd ruminated on the issue, some even let out a sigh including All-things Dao Lord.

Was Illumination Conqueror a scoundrel? A villain? A two-faced hypocrite? Not entirely. In fact, more often than not, he was straightforward and unpretentious - willingly accepted responsibility for his actions.

Unfortunately, his obsession for revenge got the best of him, morphing his vengeance into a noble pursuit and twisting his mind. This persisted until the last moment of his life - a truly frightening reminder.

Since he always thought that he was right, he was willing to massacre anyone and everyone in the name of protecting The People. Those who opposed him were in the wrong and should be branded as sinners, to be erased from this world.

His previous supporters understood how far he had strayed at this point, that he was no longer the cultivator they respected in the past.

His dried corpse painted a stark contrast to how dominating he used to be, capable of commanding numerous cultivators. None expected him to go down in this manner, given his lifelong prestige.

As the saying goes - one might be able to survive an act of god, but no one could survive a self-brought calamity.

“Pop!” The eye disappeared at this point, granting relief and peace back to the crowd. They were still nervous about it potentially devouring everything.

“I hate madmen who don’t know their own limits the most.” Li Qiye coldly uttered without looking at the corpse.

At this point, not even Supreme and Eternal Conqueror dared to speak. The ordinary-looking man instilled fear down their very spine, robbing others of the courage to stare directly at him.

He easily defeated the empowered Illumination, meaning that he could obliterate anyone among them.

He gazed piercingly into the sky and deeper into space. Alas, there was no reaction from any location in the six continents or above.

After a few seconds, he noticed something and disappeared from sight. The silent crowd had no idea where he went but his absence was a welcomed development.

None dared to make a move because they didn’t know his stance. Although he had killed Illumination, this didn’t necessarily mean that he was on The People’s side. Ultimately, provoking him meant death regardless of one’s allegiance.

“It’s finally over.” One conqueror sighed and said while staring at the corpse.

Would anyone bother to give this apex cultivator a proper burial?

“That last plan could have worked.” Supreme commented.

Despite Illumination’s insanity, the plan utilizing Ye Fantian successfully baited both Heaven and Divine Alliance. They had no idea that he was capable of borrowing the illusory realm’s power, not to mention summoning the dream eye itself.

If it wasn’t for Li Qiye’s interference, all of them were in real trouble. They were overconfident and thought that given their teamwork, they would have been able to take him down.

At the start of this event, All-things stopped caring about his reputation and was willing to join Supreme for this battle.

This could have brought infamy and ruined his reputation. Nonetheless, this was something that must be done.
