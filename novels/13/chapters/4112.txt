Chapter 4113: All-out Battle

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Boom!” Crimsondeath Monarch and Dark Dragon Monarch’s first exchange caused tsunamis to shoot out from the epicenter.

Horrified spectators immediately retreated, not wanting to die for a dumb reason.

Dark Dragon staggered several steps backward, clearly at a disadvantage in a direct confrontation. His cultivation was one level lower. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Sisters, kill them!” Xu Yiyun joined the fray and unsheathed her sword. Celestial pulses manifested from the blade.

Her slash contained the power of the stars, ready to flatten the world.

“Go!” The beauties in the entourage leaped forward and summoned their treasures.

“Boom!” Weapons and treasures flew upward and unleashed untold devastation. The beauties didn’t hold back at all against the bandits.

Screams echoed repeatedly as the bandits lost more than half of their men. Large fish and other aquatic creatures were drawn in, wanting a taste of blood and flesh.

They couldn’t keep up with Crimsondeath Monarch’s legion on top of being hunted by Xu Yiyun’s group. This resulted in a swift defeat.

Yiyun’s group primarily consisted of powerful cultivators. At first, one would think that they were there strictly for appearances. However, due to their background, they possessed incredible cultivation for their age.

Normally they wouldn’t risk their lives for Li Qiye but the bandits spewed foul words so they did not hold back.

“We’re withdrawing!” Dark Dragon Monarch was losing his battle as well and jumped out of the battle.

He swung his spear vertically and separated the water to create a path straight to Dark Dragon Island.

“Withdraw!” The other bandits started running without caring about their comrades, wanting to have four legs to run even faster.

“Ahh!” This ended with a massacre for those too slow to run. Crimsondeath Monarch and Yiyun led the way and surrounded the survivors, not sparing a single one.

Dark Dragon Island lost two-third of their men. The lucky survivors were scared out of their mind, not expecting to suffer this terrible defeat. This was their first time losing so badly at Cloud Dream.

“Wow, they’re so strong.” The spectators were in awe.

“Dark Dragon is weak among the eighteen islands. The issue is that not many sects want to start a massacre at Cloud Dream Lake.” A high elder said.

Most understood this reasoning. For example, plenty of sects in Sword Continent could obliterate Dark Dragon Island.

It’s just that no one was willing to do so because it would be considered a declaration of war against Cloud Dream Lake. This would prevent their members from entering this region in the future.

“Pursue, kill them all.” Li Qiye ordered.

“Men, march!” Crimsondeath Monarch gathered his men again and marched towards Dark Dragon Island.

“Rumble!” Carriages and chariots trampled the sky. This legion led the way with Li Qiye’s entourage right behind them.

“Damn, they’re actually attacking the island.” Spectators found this astonishing.

“He’s not playing around, this is rather bold.” One expert thought that Li Qiye was being too arrogant.

“Isn’t this the same as poking a beehive? The other islands won’t sit still and watch. Is his group capable of contending against all eighteen islands?” One youth asked.

Normally, the eighteen islands operated independently. However, they were still under the jurisdiction of Dark Gale Camp.

If someone were to attack an individual island, the other seventeen might group up against them. Thus, it was rather unwise to carry out a siege.

“This is on par for Li Qiye. Cloud Dream Lake is just a lair of bandits compared to Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom. The guy even stole their future queen. He just needs to pay enough money for more experts.” An older cultivator said.

The crowd agreed with this. Everyone knew about Ning Zhu’s matter; this was nothing short of declaring war against Sea Emperor.

He wasn’t afraid of this behemoth, let alone Cloud Dream Lake.

The loud marching alarmed both neutral spectators and the bandits among the eighteen islands.

“They’re still coming, how dare they!” Dark Dragon Monarch received this report after making it back to the island and jumped out of his chair.

“Boom!” The island became resplendent and started spinning like a grinder.

“Dark Dragon Island is activating their defenses.” One expert said: “It’s known to be quite tough, no one has gotten through yet.”

“Crimsondeath, you’re pushing it!” A large image of Dark Dragon Monarch appeared on top of the island and shouted.

Crimsondeath coldly uttered: “It is not too late to surrender. Our young noble might show mercy in that case or it’ll be your last moment once we take down the island.”

Crimsondeath was notorious in the past and wasn’t part of the righteous path. He had destroyed sects before so this wasn’t a big deal. Moreover, destroying a lair of bandits was justification enough.

“We’ll see if you can take my island down! But remember, this is Cloud Dream, you’re not leaving this place alive…” Dark Dragon roared.

“Commence.” Li Qiye stopped this conversation and ordered while being fed fruits on his throne.

“Attack!” Crimsondeath led the way for his men.

“Attack!” The legion was right behind him.

“Boom!” The entire island actually started flying towards the legion to attack its enemies.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” The monarch and his legion stopped the first two smashes successfully but were sent flying by the third.

“Regroup!” He maintained his composure and ordered the legion for another offense while swinging his hatchets wildly.

Alas, this seemed rather futile. The legion couldn’t take down the island’s defense.
