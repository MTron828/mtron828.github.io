Chapter 5004: Buddhist Six Paths

Li Qiye seemed to care more about swinging his feet in the water than the monk.

“Amitabha.” The monk went on: “Benefactor, please visit the Land of Peace when you have time.” 

“The Land of Peace?” The group exchanged glances because this place existed in the upper two continents.

Buddhism, one of the twelve lineages, was a subsidiary of the Land of Peace. The latter didn’t belong to any of the five alliances up there.

Rumor has it that it was the source of all the Buddhist lineages in the six continents.

“Still haven’t given up on enlightening me yet? Even your true form won’t be able to do it.” Li Qiye stared at him.

“!” The youths became emotional and took a deep breath.

Mahayana was considered a sacred monk in the lower continents. In history, some conquerors and dragon lords showed him respect despite being stronger. Everyone else followed this precedence.

Whenever people met him, they were instantly impressed by his wonderful aura and Buddhist attainment. Not even powerful dragon lords such as Swordgrasp Venerable noticed anything peculiar. They had no idea that this was merely an avatar, not his true body.

Moreover, he resided in the upper continents? That astounded the youths as well.

An avatar surviving for so long away from the main body while managing to fool everyone else? There was a wondrous barrier separating the continents but it didn’t seem to affect the avatar. Just how strong was the real monk then?

They shuddered after thinking about this issue. Could a twelve-fruit conqueror do something like this? Perhaps not.

They stared at him and gained a new perspective on the current landscape of the lower continents. Everyone thought that the strongest right now was Conceal Conqueror while they started having doubts.

“Amitabha, Buddhism calls for the fateful, Benefactor.” The monk didn’t give up.

“There is no connection between me and Buddhism and even if there is, it’s not a good one.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“You should change your mind, Benefactor.” The monk said.

“I’m not interested unless you can change your six paths to nine.” Li Qiye said.

The monk became emotional and gazed intensely at Li Qiye. His eyes seemed to be turning into two Buddhist wheels containing three thousand worlds. They could enlighten and convert any living beings or souls. No one could resist this force.

The youths were horrified but fortunately, they were standing behind Li Qiye and had his protection. Alas, just one glance at the monk still gave them the urge to join Buddhism. 

Li Qiye waved his hand again and broke the technique: “Enough. Provoke me and I shall stomp your Land of Peace and end you all.” 

“Amitabha, I apologize for my impudence and unstable Buddhist heart.” The monk said while trying to calm himself. It has been a long time since he last experienced this emotion.

The world had only heard about the six paths while Li Qiye knew about the nine paths.

“Benefactor, how did you find this out?” The monk bowed, wanting to learn from Li Qiye: “Is it something I can seek?”

He performed a full rite of veneration to show the highest respect while the youth watched with bated breath.

They suspected that the monk was comparable to a twelve-fruit conqueror. Alas, he was still bowing before Li Qiye.

“Sigh, you monks have the thickest skin.” Li Qiye had no choice but to accept the gesture. He helplessly added: “Seems like I can’t rid myself of this annoying fate with Buddhism. How troublesome.”

This comment was suicidal since it insulted all the Buddhist practitioners on the six continents. However, the monk was ecstatic because he understood the implication.

“Benefactor, you wish to tie the knots with us?” He sat down cross-legged and asked respectfully.

“It’s not that.” Li Qiye responded: “The issue is that you monks are so persistent and latch onto me like ghosts. I can’t kill all of you, you just somehow drag your long tail from one epoch to the next.”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Amitabha.” The monk wasn’t angry at all and was happy instead: “This just shows how strong our connection is. Heaven and earth might wither, the myriad worlds might crumble, but the fate of Buddhism remains.”

“Okay, don’t need to tell me this crap.” Li Qiye said: “This might be able to trick others but not me.” 

“This is a fortuitous date. The Land of Peace requires your enlightenment, Benefactor.” The ecstatic monk said.

“No, I don’t want anything to do with that mess. When the calling of fate comes, so be it.” Li Qiye refused but still gave room to be involved in the future.

“Perfect.” The monk said: “I will wait for you forever for our connection is eternal.”

The youths got goosebumps because it sounded like a lover reciting a vow of love.

“I will only help once, it is up to you all to reach the nine paths or whatever.” Li Qiye said.

“Very well, Benefactor, and that’s all we need, we can handle the rest.” The monk happily said.

“Fine, now can you get out of my sight? I get a headache whenever I see bald heads.” Li Qiye waved his hand.
