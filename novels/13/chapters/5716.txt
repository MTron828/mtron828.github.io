Chapter 5717: Make The First Move

“Can’t say no after receiving ample favors.” The machine said: “You’re no stranger to this, Sacred Teacher.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Not to the extent of dying like idiots.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Are you sure, Sacred Teacher?” The machine took one step forward, causing the entire world to quake.

“So confident with this metal giant, do you think you can challenge me now?” Li Qiye said.

The disdainful comment caused listeners who didn’t truly fathom Li Qiye’s identity to take a deep breath.

The machine had enough power to stop the momentum of Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation.

During Grand Dao War, their forces were massacred. They wasted numerous resources and treasures to build up a temporary defensive line, only to barely stop the onslaught.

Eventually, this defensive line faltered and they lost more soldiers. Some emperors were lucky enough to be teleported back to Celestial Court at the last moment. Nonetheless, their injuries required a lengthy recuperation.

Today, this machine was enough to stop the majority of the formation’s firepower. Spectators still didn’t know of its ceiling just yet.

Only one thing was certain - no single imperial-level character could take it on. Li Qiye, on the other hand, questioned their intelligence for challenging him with it.

“Sacred Teacher, we are no stranger to your supreme domination. We, overestimating our abilities, still wish to try.” The machine said. None of the formation controllers was offended by Li Qiye’s comment.

“Indeed you are overestimating your abilities.” Li Qiye chuckled: “But have it your way since I can’t just let you leave after coming all the way here. There has to be a price.”

“Very well, please enlighten us, Sacred Teacher.” The machine responded.

“Come, show me the power of your secret art. Make the first move or you won’t have the opportunity to do anything.” Li Qiye waved his hand and said.

Ordinary cultivators viewed this as arrogance but apex cultivators became frozen, feeling suffocated. Could they challenge this monstrous existence?

They knew that his words carried immense weight. This was not sheer confidence, he truly didn’t consider them a challenge.

“So be it!” The machine roared and channeled more energy vectors. All the engines were running at full force.

The members did everything they could, pouring their vitality and dao into the machine. This impetus shifted the machine into a crimson hue.

All the vectors immediately flowed to the machine’s arms. Explosions didn’t only come from the machine but also from the vibration in space, creating a deafening symphony.

Spectators felt that the machine had enough power to push heaven and earth or crush the galaxy above. Its destructive capability was beyond their imagination.

“Die!” The machine swung with both hands, not relying on merit law or technique - just pure destruction encompassing incalculable weight and power.

“Boom!” Cracks could be heard even before the hands made it to the continent or the ocean.

The shockwaves revealed the seabed of the bottomless ocean. Cracks appeared everywhere - a signal of total collapse.

Living beings turned pale; some soiled their pants. They wanted to scream only to find their voice robbed.

The tremendous and terrifying force shook Imperial Field to the core, resonating through the oceans nearby. Water was lifted into the air and detached from the seafloor.

However, spectators became more astounded since this ultimate strike was blocked by Li Qiye merely raising his hand, requiring zero effort on his part.
