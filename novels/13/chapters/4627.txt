Chapter 4628: Fancy

Jian Ming looked to be in a tough position while he occasionally stole glances at Ye Tingrong. He was no longer his normal self, losing his shameless and fearless nature.

“Are you still a man? Can’t even speak properly now, how shameful.” The daoist said with disdain, prompting Jian Ming to glare angrily at him.

“Be manly and propose since the time is right.” The daoist went on.

“This is the best chance indeed, that’s why all the other sects are doing it.” Paramount Scion agreed.

“When if not now? Do you want to watch Miss Ye marry someone else?” The daoist continued.

“That’s not my intention…” Jian Ming felt bashful.

“Then what is it?” The daoist pressed on.

“I…” Jian Ming couldn’t come up with a response again.

As for Ye Tingrong, she didn’t mind and arranged a place meant for important guests before leaving.

Once she was gone, Li Qiye smiled and told Jian Ming: “There’s nothing embarrassing about liking someone. No need to hide it.”

“Young Noble…” Jian Ming turned red.

“Why the hell are you still hesitating? Even a blind man can tell that you like her.” The daoist laughed.

“She can tell too.” Paramount Scion smiled.

Jian Ming’s embarrassment only increased once the others exposed him.

“Don’t tell me this is the first time you’ve liked a girl, hehehe, no one else before? Are you a virgin?” The daoist teased.

“You’re the virgin!” Jian Ming barked back and gritted his teeth.

His strong reaction only served to further amuse the crowd.

“It’s fine to be embarrassed and awkward, just realize that if you actually want to win the beauty’s hand, take advantage of this opportunity.” Li Qiye said with a serious tone.

“Right, don’t be so indecisive.” The daoist said: “If you like her, show her. Just a marriage proposal isn’t a big deal, be your normal self.”

“Even if I like her, s-she might not like me back.” Jian Ming eventually said.

“How do you know she doesn’t like you? Remember, she doesn’t mind if you propose.” The daoist said.

“Everyone can propose right now though. And only one will get picked.” Jian Ming replied. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Give it a shot at least.” Paramount Scion said: “If you don’t do it, you will never know her feelings toward you.”

“What if she really doesn’t like me?” Jian Ming hesitated.

“Then that’s the end of that, no big deal!” The daoist became impatient.

“This is your chance to turn a crush into something fruitful, don’t keep it one-sided.” Li Qiye chuckled: “The alternative is to quietly watch her being in someone else’s embrace while telling yourself that it is okay as long as she is happy. Is that what you want?”

“Haha, there must be something wrong with him.” The daoist laughed.

“Wh-what should I do then?” Jian Ming smiled wryly.

“What else but to compete for her heart? Show her your sincerity through your action. If she doesn’t like you now, work hard until she does, you’ll be rewarded and so would she with happiness.”

Jian Ming didn’t respond.

“Do you still have doubts? The young noble is right.” The daoist said.

“I don’t want to take advantage of her.” Jian Ming said awkwardly.

“It is no longer up to her, her feelings do not matter since her fate is not under her control.” Li Qiye said: “She won’t be able to marry the person she likes, it’ll be True Immortal Spirit or maybe our young scion over here.”

“Even if she happens to like her fiance, the whole thing is just a scheme.” Paramount Scion said: “It is no secret that everyone is here for the peerless treasures. The sects will pressure the two lovers greatly and use all potential methods for their ultimate goal. Their relationship will crack afterward because of this fundamental conflict.”

“Therefore, your goal is purer than anyone else. You simply like her and have no ulterior motives. There is no sect pressuring you either.” Li Qiye said.

“I see…” Jian Ming murmured.

“That’s why you shouldn’t worry so much. There is no one else she can marry who will make her happy under these circumstances. She will be treated as a tool, there is no happiness there for there is a lack of sincerity in the first place.” The daoist said: “Let’s put it this way, do you like her enough to want and make her happy?”

“Yes.” Jian Ming nodded.

“Then don’t you think that you’re the best option versus all the other suitors?” The daoist asked.

Jian Ming was moved after hearing this.

“Put in the effort in order to avoid regrets. Fear no one and be confident in what you can bring to the table. Otherwise, you will do nothing but make excuses for passivity.” Li Qiye smiled.

Jian Ming’s blood started becoming hotter. He said: “Well, how should we propose to Golden Gate? What if they do not pick me?”

He had enough self-awareness to realize the lack of advantages. Putting Ye Tingrong’s feelings aside, his background, talent, and cultivation couldn’t compare to those from the behemoths.

“We’ll just have to kidnap her then.” Li Qiye smirked.
