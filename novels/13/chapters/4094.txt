Chapter 4095: Compensation

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Spectators didn’t dare to breathe loudly while staring at Ninth. As for him, he only gave a passing glance at the fallen combatants.

His eyes remained the same as they were in the opening - the opponents were no different than dead men.

He turned his focus towards Armament Mountain next, seemingly wanting to see through the entire sect.

“Is he about to attack?” An expert wondered.

“It seems reckless attacking Armament alone.” Another blurted.

Though Ninth had massacred two legions, this didn’t mean that he could take down Armament.

“This is something unique to Sword God Sacred Ground.” A knowledgeable cultivator explained: “They only care about the targets, nothing else. The difficulties and backers of their targets didn’t matter.”

Many nodded in agreement. The members of the sacred ground wouldn’t give up for any reason. Fear was not part of them.

“He alone won’t win.” A big shot shook his head.

In reality, Armament still had two dao lords. The entire sect has been blessed and augmented repeatedly. They are under the protection of a grand momentum created by the dao lords. Ninth wouldn’t be able to break it.

“Yes, it’ll be difficult for him to break down their defenses.” Another expert nodded.

One ancestor came up with a different perspective: “Ninth isn’t trying to take down Armament. His goal is to shake the tree and scare the monkeys. He can do many other things, such as killing disciples until they no longer dare to kill outside. Their sect master will have to come out eventually.”

“True, this wouldn’t be his first time doing this.” A big shot who had seen this in person agreed.

“What a headache for Armament.” Others exchanged glances.

Ninth might not be able to assault Firmament but he could kill its disciples caught outside. Most importantly, he wasn’t part of the righteous faction and could resort to ambushes and assassinations.

For example, opposing Nine-wheel City Lord and Peace Ocean Sword King was easier. They would not resort to despicable means instead of a fair fight.

Normally, the successors of the sacred ground also preferred to fight a fair battle against their targets. This would only become an issue if the targets were to dodge the challenge.

Ninth remained fixated on Armament. The spectators realized that an aggressive plan was imminent.

“This is not Armament’s year.” Someone gloated.

Ninth started walking towards the mountain, hellbent on getting a fight against Shi Yingxue.

“Leaving just like that?” A lazy voice sounded.

People looked back and saw Li Qiye laying on a long chair, seemingly sunbathing and sleeping. Ning Zhu brought it out for him.

They nearly forgot about him because of Ninth’s appearance.

“Someone else is shouldering the burden for him, shouldn’t he be celebrating?” A cultivator was confused; why would Li Qiye provoke Ninth right now?

Ninth had killed Celestial Ape Demon King and Starshooter King. Sea Emperor and Armament would definitely focus on taking him down before Li Qiye. This was absolutely a great development.

Ninth stopped and looked back at Li Qiye. It was the same gaze of indifference.

“What?” He coldly uttered.

“Is he tired of living? Why would he pick a fight with Ninth out of all people?” One listener wondered.

Most would rather pick a fight with Armament Mountain instead of agitating this god of death.

Li Qiye still lazily lay there; Ninth’s murderous temperament didn’t affect him at all.

“It wasn’t easy gathering all those fish for some money.” He said: “And here you go killing all of them so I won’t get to see a single coin. Tell me, what should you do?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“We got a show to watch now.” A big shot knew that the play wasn’t over yet. Ninth might not be the strongest right now but only a fool would provoke him. Li Qiye seemed to be a rare exception.

“I will spare your life.” Ninth coldly uttered. He spoke without any trace of arrogance and aggression - only stating it in a matter-of-fact manner.

Others would love to hear this coming from Ninth. It would make them less nervous in the future because he was a man of his word.

“My life is right here, you can’t take it anyway.” Li Qiye retorted.

This was as blatant of a challenge as could be. Ninth had no love

Sure enough, Ninth’s gaze became piercing just like a blade wanting to penetrate Li Qiye’s chest.
