Chapter 5093: Had To Flee Again

Li Qiye was slightly amused after scouting the state of the top three sects in Deity.

Why did someone strong enough to destroy them resort to this method? For example, Conceal Conqueror didn’t need to do it so secretly if she wanted to destroy Eight-stallion. It would be a direct attack on the battlefield.

Given the circumstances, everyone thought that it was Li Qiye. He was the only one strong enough to obliterate them in such a short time.

Moreover, he was on the hunt for Conceal Conqueror as well. Everything seemed to make sense.

“Putting the blame on me?” Li Qiye stroked his chin with a smirk on his face. Someone had been watching all along and came up with this plan.

“So confident, I see.” Li Qiye became interested: “This will take some time.”

Right as he tried to search for more clues, he came across an old man wearing a gray robe.

The latter bowed after seeing him: “You’re here too, Young Noble?”

“You as well.” Li Qiye responded.

“I’ve lost track of this person and look at the mess here now. Rather cunning and always looming in the shadows.” The old man said. He was none other than God Fist from Worldbreaker who came up to the six continents as well.

“Cautious of you, I’m sure.” Li Qiye said.

“The moment I ascended, I was ambushed right away. At first, I assumed that this was just another case of this world hunting ascenders. This wasn’t right, the ambusher was alone and wanted to capture me alive.”

“Because the living is more delicious.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Do you know who it is?” God Fist asked.

“Not quite, but I have a pretty good guess.” Li Qiye said.

“I see, you have a plan already.” God Fist responded.

“Since the guy seems to be interested in me, I’ll play along to be polite.” Li Qiye smirked.

“This person is definitely a conqueror.” God Fist gave as much information as he could: “The attacks are so strange though, these merit laws don’t seem to be part of the grand dao.”

“It’s not only for keeping the identity a secret, this is an ancient way, the most interesting thing about it.” Li Qiye said.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Is there anything I can do, Young Noble?” God Fist asked.

“Don’t disturb the snake in the grass, ignore it for now and wait for them to take the initiative. I don’t want to waste time forever here.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I understand.” God Fist cupped his fist and left after understanding Li Qiye’s intent.

If he kept on searching for the assailant, it would only make the person hide even more. This would end up wasting Li Qiye’s time.

After the old man left, Li Qiye entered a special dimension to start a search. After getting to a particular location, he reached out and forcefully created an opening.

“Bam!” Someone fell out of this hole - a woman covered in blood and wounds, not just the hole left behind by Li Qiye on her chest.

She tried to get up but after seeing that it was Li Qiye, she heaved a sigh of relief.

“Looks like someone got ambushed.” Li Qiye squatted down and smiled at her.

“I’ve lost, do as you wish.” Conceal Conqueror sighed and closed her eyes.

Resisting was futile even if she wasn’t grievously wounded. She couldn’t exert twenty percent of her strength right now.

Li Qiye observed the wounds and said: “Looks like the ambusher wanted you to survive.”

She didn’t respond. She had escaped back to Deity after fighting Li Qiye. Alas, she was instantly ambushed by a mysterious cultivator.

This caught her off guard completely because Deity was her territory. Nonetheless, given her exceptional awareness, she managed to escape right away with her best movement technique. There was nothing she could do to save the sects anyway.

Afterward, she hid in this special dimension but Li Qiye still managed to find her. She initially thought that she just needed to stay alive. One day, she would become strong enough to deal with any foe. Alas, she had underestimated Li Qiye’s scouting ability.

“Why was I left alive?” She realized that Li Qiye was making a great point. She hasn’t had time to think about the circumstances due to her wounds: “So that I could light the beacon?”

As the leader of Deity, she was responsible for informing the upper continents when necessary. For example, when a top master was taking revenge against Deity. This has been the protocol after Luminous Conqueror.

The two alliances didn’t wish to rebuild Deity another time due to the immense resources and effort required.

Furthermore, top masters always cared about their reputation and would challenge Deity directly. If it was a matter of vengeance, they would use this opportunity to inform the world of their reason for fighting.

In this case, the killer didn’t wish to be known and gave them no time to react.
