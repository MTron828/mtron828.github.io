Chapter 5053: Run Away!

“Li Qiye!” Both the combatants and crowd members were shocked to see Li Qiye.

No one had more fame than Li Qiye at the moment. Only Conceal Conqueror or perhaps this founder god had a chance against him in a one-on-one scenario.

After all, Radiant Monarch ran for his life while the rest of his allies were obliterated by Li Qiye. The monarch thought about that day once more - barely escaping death. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He didn’t expect Li Qiye to still be in Demon and worst of all, interfering in this matter.

“Does Li Qiye want to fight?” The beasts and demons prayed for this possibility.

On the other hand, Bloodfly’s worst-case scenario occurred. In order to fulfill his plan, he gathered powerful allies.

In a different scenario, destroying the other branches might incite criticism from the outside world. However, his allies consisted of authoritative figures from the great lineages.

In the case of success, Golden Mosquito would become the only god in Demon. Bloodfly and he believed that this would be enough to strengthen Demon and start a greater conquest.

Alas, Bloodfly has been worrying about Li Qiye. He knew that the guy was strong and devilish.

“Fellow Daoist Li, please don’t interfere with our business. When we are finished here, we will rebuild Demon and you shall be our most honorable guest.” Bloodfly said respectfully.

The still-conscious demons stared at Li Qiye, wanting to know if he would accept the favorable conditions.

“Once I become the true god of Demon, you may pick any treasure from the divine nest.” Golden Mosquito who was preoccupied with the divine tablet spoke up.

Nightwalker, Lunar Rabbit, and Chillglare Hawk became emotional after hearing this. Though they wanted to ask Li Qiye for help, they couldn’t offer a similar deal since they didn’t have access to the divine nest. The same couldn’t be said about Golden Mosquito who had most likely been there before.

“Sounds like a good deal.” Li Qiye said with a relaxed tone.

Radiant Monarch’s group heaved a sigh of relief. With Li Qiye on their side, they would have no problem benefitting from this transaction. After all, they were also offered handsome rewards for this.

Li Qiye smiled and continued: “But, I enjoy defending the weak against injustice. Plus, many of you didn’t like me before, seems like I would be doing myself a disservice by not participating.”

“If you dare to ruin this for me, I will hunt you down no matter how far you run, I will annihilate your clans and let you suffer a fate worse than death.” Golden Mosquito became furious.

“Since you say that, I suppose I’m having roasted mosquito today.” Li Qiye smiled and jumped off the branch.

“Kill him!” Golden Mosquito ordered.

Li Qiye walked forward and smiled at the enemies: “Let’s get started, I’m sure you all want to kill me as soon as possible. However, I won’t be giving you time to show off your moves today.”

Radiant Monarch and the others became nervous. The eight of them could take on any conqueror but Li Qiye didn’t view them seriously.

This wasn’t the time to become angry either because Li Qiye could actually defeat them in a few moves.

Thus, the eight dragon lords exchanged glances, wondering about the right course.

During this moment of hesitation, Radiant Monarch suddenly leaped into the air and soared for the horizon.

This stunned the crowd since no one expected him to flee in a hurry. He was the number one of the young generation and had six sacred fruits. Moreover, he came from Godchaser Palace and served as its pillar.

Running away meant throwing away his reputation along with Godchaser’s. The crowd truly believed that he would prefer death to running.

Of course, he himself didn’t care about any of this. He was pierced with his own spear in the previous battle and knew how frightening death was. Instinct told him to run despite being fully aware of the consequences.

“Coward.” Bloodfly God was livid on top of being afraid.

Unfortunately, Radiant Monarch was still stopped by Li Qiye despite being ten million miles away.

“You’ve already gotten away once, I have a reputation to uphold, you know?” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“Die!” Radiant Monarch had no choice but to channel all of his power.

“Boom!” The six sacred fruits released the purest light affinity. An explosion came for Li Qiye and reduced everything beneath to nothingness.

Time and space came to a halt before this devastating storm.
