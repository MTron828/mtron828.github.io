Chapter 4109: Cloud Dream Lake

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Note: Changing Cloud Dream Marsh to Lake.

Ning Zhu had a heavy heart about the challenge. Ninth was clearly targeting the Six Kings this time. It would be a battle to the death.

She saw Ninth’s power with her own eyes. Though he lost utterly to Li Qiye and had to run, it didn’t mean that he was weak. In fact, she was worried about Pine Leaf Sword Lord’s life.

“Go back, it’s good to see him one last time.” Li Qiye gave her permission.

“One last time…?” Her expression darkened right away. She wasn’t angry at his insensitive comment but rather, this seemed to be a death sentence for her master.

“Young Noble, do you mean…” She became slightly pale and had to ask for confirmation despite not wanting to hear the answer.

“People say that no one knows a father more than his son nor a master more than his disciple. Tell me, what do you think is your master’s chance of winning against Ninth?” Li Qiye said flatly.

She pondered in silence. Far from being a fool, she was smart enough to have an objective analysis of the battle. She might not be the one who understand her master the most but was definitely the closest person to him. Thus, she knew how strong he was.

She naturally hoped that her master would win. Alas, Ninth’s sword dao was impressive so the outcome looked grim.

Ninth’s sword needed to taste blood before returning to its scabbard. Her master wouldn’t survive the battle.

“Young Noble, please save my master.” She bowed towards Li Qiye.

Li Qiye had defeated Ninth before and could certainly do so again. Though she wasn’t a member of Wooden Sword any longer, she still remembered the kindness and support shown by her master. This was a debt she must pay.

Previously during the engagement with Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom, her master went against numerous elders and ancestors who supported the deal. Alas, he couldn’t change their mind.

Now, he was in trouble and she wanted to do everything possible to help him.

“Do you think it’s possible? It’s not up to me.” Li Qiye smiled: “You know what type of person he is more than me.”

Ning Zhu thought about it. Yes, her master would refuse Li Qiye’s help. As the king of Wooden Sword, he was calm and flexible. However, he was actually a prideful person.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have accepted the challenge so quickly. Others would have bought more time if they weren’t fully confident about winning.

Thus, he wouldn’t accept help from anyone and preferred to fight a fair duel, relying on his own power.

“Everyone has their own will. You cannot make decisions for him.” Li Qiye said.

She sighed after hearing this. Her unwanted involvement might actually be detrimental to his reputation. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I understand.” She bowed after realizing her impropriety.

“Go back and see him one last time. I must go on a trip to Cloud Dream with Yiyun to see who is audacious enough to not pay me.” He smiled.

Ning Zhu only worried about her master right now. She bowed one more time towards Li Qiye and bid goodbye.

Cloud Dream was the largest lake in Sword Continent. While standing ashore, it would appear to be a boundless ocean.

Moreover, it was well-known for its raging current as well. A weak cultivator would certainly drown once fallen.

But its size and turbulence weren’t its defining characteristic. It was most famous for its robbers and bandits.

Whenever the name Cloud Dream was brought up, people would instantly think about this unsavory aspect.

It had numerous islands - the home of various bandit groups. Despite their insane population, all of them have pleaded loyalty to Cloud Dream King - the lord of Dark Gale. Of course, outsiders preferred to use another title for him - Bandit King.

In reality, Dark Gale had a history older than even Armament Mountain or Virtuous School. Some historians even believed that it just might be the oldest lineage in Sword Continent.

This bandit camp had committed numerous atrocious deeds including killing disciples from the behemoths. Strangely enough, it survived all the eras. No one had heard of an expedition against it either.

Even dao lords kept their distance from Dark Gale instead of destroying it.

After all, bandits were normally viewed as morally-depraved villains but most importantly, weak. Any organized force should be able to take them down. This just wasn’t the case here to everyone’s astonishment.

Some attributed this to the camp having powerful experts such as its king and ancestors. Cloud Dream King was one of the Six Sect Masters so he was no slouch.

However, legend has it that there was a terrifying ancestor there with the title of Nightloom, capable of contending against the Five Overlords and should be as strong as Hallowed City Lord. All in all, he was one of the strongest cultivators in Sword Continent, a reason for Dark Gale’s resiliency.

Some disagreed with this notion because Dark Gale has been around for a long time before this ancestor. There should be other reasons for its success.

Unfortunately, the world couldn’t come up with any concrete support. The dao lords who knew the actual reasons never told the world either.

The place eventually became a haven for criminals and those with secrets to hide. Many with powerful enemies also chose it as their new home.
