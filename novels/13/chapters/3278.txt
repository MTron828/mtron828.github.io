Gong Qianyue has proven her supremacy among the young generation of Divine Black by reaching the materialization realm.

“Junior Sister Qianyue is the greatest genius of the northern West King.” One male fan of her said, clearly infatuated with her.

Her talent wasn’t the only brilliant thing about her. Her beauty was just as dazzling, the prettiest in Divine Black. She naturally had no lack of suitors as a result.

This wasn’t limited to their sect. Other young cultivators all around West King wanted to win her hand.

“She’ll definitely become the next sect master.” Another disciple admiringly said.

Her cultivation improvement shook Divine Black. It became a hot topic for many disciples and seniors.

On the second day was when she would come out of her training session. The young ones did everything they could to come there in order to greet and congratulate her.

A few experts from the older generations also came. They wanted to see the true extent of her current cultivation. Some elders were also present.

This treatment was unheard of for the younger cultivators. Both Zhan Hu and Huang Ning never got to this level of prestige. This made many think that she would really become the next sect master.

Li Qiye didn’t pay attention to any of this. It was just another day for him.

Fuyou has brought the children to Li Qiye’s place. The latter had already borrowed a Tortoise Fist manual from the library.

Of course, the sect didn’t give a damn about it. Anyone could borrow for as long as they want.

He didn’t pass down the original fundamentals of the technique to the children right away and chose to change it.

It only consisted of three actions but after his refinement, everything became different. It touched straight to the source of the dao of the fist. All of its profundities were added to the three actions.

The children were awfully excited to see Li Qiye again. They naturally wanted him to teach them over the instructors in Jade Bird.

Why? They realized the gap between Li Qiye and their instructors after listening to a few lectures.

Though Li Qiye only occasionally gave them pointers, he managed to answer all of their questions in a concise yet profound manner.

He also kept it simple and easy to understand. This made them want to listen even more. As for the instructors? The children felt that there was something off but they couldn’t put it into words.

They didn’t care whichever merit law it was because whatever he taught would be the best one for them.

He personally taught them Tortoise Fist this time around in order to give them a great chance for the future.

They were used to his instructing style and quickly understood this merit law.

“Tortoise Fist is not about the punch itself, it is an extension of instincts to reach all things and their profundities. Each breath contains derivations, each action channels chaos energy, its power stems from the dao...” He began imparting the true mysteries into the group.

Others had no idea that this merit law and its three actions could reach the source of the dao. It encompassed a perfect defense on top of being very easy to start due to its simplicity.

Moreover, it served as a perfect match with the All-things Mantra. Though the children didn’t cultivate this particular mantra, their South Conch was derived from it. They had the same origin thus they could perform Tortoise Fist.

The children learned the merit law quickly under his short tutelage and admired him even more.

“Who is more amazing, Young Master or Senior Sister Qianyue?” They became curious after learning the fist technique.

In recent days, Qianyue enjoyed the spotlight in the sect. She became the undisputed number one genius so that’s why this comparison was brought up.

“The young master, obviously.” The freckled girl immediately said: “He knows and can do everything even if he’s weak.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“True, he activated thirteen sections while the senior sister only got five, she can’t compare to him.” An honest child laughed and said.

The kids knew many of his deeds - curing their instructor, teaching them how to cultivate, and changing the fate of their village. He became their most-respected idol.

However, some experts from Jade Bird didn’t like it, especially the main instructor responsible for the children.

He was a human and had high hopes for the kid. Now, they left him to learn under Li Qiye. The whole thing was ridiculous in his eyes.

“Ridiculous, nonsense! How can you let a Mortal Shell teach them?” The expert loudly protested.

“An Iron Skin.” Fuyou corrected him.

“So what?!” The expert became even louder: “Senior Brother Liu, what are you thinking?! These children are amazing seeds but you’re ruining their future.”

“I’m the one who brought them here so I care more about their future than anyone else. I view them as my own disciples so I won’t do anything to jeopardize them.” Fuyou said.

“But, Li Qiye has terrible aptitudes. Fine, leaving that aside, you’re letting him teach them Tortoise Fist? I was about to ask the peak lord for a few high-ranked merit laws to teach them.”

“I appreciate your good intention, Junior Brother. I’m doing this for their sake. The mountain king has agreed as well.” Fuyou sincerely said.

The experts couldn’t pursue this matter. He became frustrated, not knowing why their peak lord would agree to this.

Sure enough, the news of the children learning Tortoise Fist spread across the sect.

“Tortoise Fist? Taught by that Li Qiye? Is this a joke, you’re letting someone with three mortal-level talents teach others? And Tortoise Fist on top of that.” Many found this ridiculous.

“This must be a cruel joke. Only an idiot would want to learn Tortoise Fist.” Another sneered.

Numerous disciples heard about this and wanted to come to take a look.

“Foolishness.” They confirmed that Li Qiye was really teaching them this merit law.

“There are so many better merit laws, so many idiots here.” A spectator shook his head.

“It’s because there are only three actions to this, so easy to learn. They’re from the mortal world so they need to learn the easiest merit law. Maybe they can’t understand anything harder.” One more sneered.
