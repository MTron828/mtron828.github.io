Chapter 4503: Invincible Sword Art

The auction didn’t take place in a private room without any windows or openings. It wasn’t hidden underground either like a basement.

Surprisingly, the location was rather refreshing and scenic with blue water and gentle breezes. It took place at a lake of unknown location. The big shots sensed that it wasn’t the same lake found after entering the grotto. After all, they were strong enough to discern the little details.

In the middle of the lake was an island with willow trees and pavilions - a perfect place for an auction.

The big shots sat down then the workers began to bring them appetizers and drinks.

An auctioneer with a goatee appeared and coughed to gather everyone’s attention. He bowed slightly and began: “I’ll commence the auction here. We don’t have that many auctions tonight, only ten or so. The highest bidder takes it, so please, gentlemen, pay careful attention.”

This auctioneer was powerful and experienced. Thus, he had no problem speaking in front of the big shots.

“Start then.” One big shot couldn’t wait any longer.

They came prepared and knew exactly what they wanted since they were on the invitation list. The auction house had given them a list before.

Ten auctions were rather few in number but still truly desirable. These cultivators have prepared ample money for their goal.

A disciple from the grotto brought up a wooden box with all the archaic characteristics. The few runes were majestic and powerful, a sign of the great treasure within.

The auctioneer opened it and revealed a scroll made out of unknown material, slightly resembling leather yet not due to its golden and metallic luster.

It emitted an invincible aura despite its rolled-up state. A sword could soar through the pages and pierce the throat.

“The first auction is a sword technique created by Skyblade Dao Lord.” The auctioneer introduced.

Though some knew the level of this auction, they still took a deep breath. The opening item was a dao lord-level sword technique, not bad at all.

“What is the source?” A big shot in stealth inquired: “Should the dao lord’s sword arts be gathered in Sky Hut?” This person hid their identity and appearance.

Skyblade Dao Lord was a sky spirit who came from Divine Ridge. With this impressive background, he was destined for greatness.

After becoming a dao lord, he created another top lineage in Sky Border - Sky Hut. It became the gathering of many various tribes of their race. Sky spirits were blessed from birth with great innate gifts, hence their numerous geniuses.

As the founder of Sky Hut, he left his legacy in Sky Hut. Thus, it was strange to see one of his techniques up for sale.

“Please rest assured, Esteemed Guest. All of our auctions are traceable.” The auctioneer elaborated: “This sword art isn’t stored in Sky Hut, they do not have any version either. This was created by the dao lord during his youth, it is the original copy. The dao lord hasn’t modified its content either.”

He paused for a bit before continuing: “Those who know anything about the dao lord should be aware that the Gu helped him quite a bit at the start. He cultivated and learned the sword dao there, this technique being one of them. Therefore, he remembered their kindness and left the whole scroll to the Gu. If anyone here is from Sky Hut, I’m sure you have read about this in your sect’s annals. Today, the Gu entrusts us with it on consignment.”

The big shots exchanged glances. One of them nodded and said: “I’ve heard of this before.”

Another nodded and said: “This is verifiable and trustworthy.”

“Very well, the auction for the sword scroll from Skyblade Dao Lord will start at 300,000 dao lord jade stones. No other levels are accepted.” The auctioneer began.

This was quite a start because 300,000 dao lord jade stones was a large sum for any great power. Of course, the big shots knew whether this scroll was worth it or not.

“310,000.” A cultivator in stealth bid.

After a few seconds, another answered: “320,000.”

The auction wasn’t too hot. This didn’t mean that the technique wasn’t worth the price. It’s just that the participants were from prestigious sects and had access to their own. Dao lord merit laws weren’t too rare.

There were other treasures in this auction that were rarer so they couldn’t afford to waste their resources here and needed to stick to their conservative strategy.

“330,000.” The cultivator in stealth seemed to be interested in the sword art.

No one else continued the auction because they wanted to conserve their jades.

“340,000.” This lasted for a bit before another bid.

“380,000.” The stealthy cultivator immediately raised it by 40,000 to show his determination.

This cultivator asked about its origin from the start, clearly interested in it.

Finally, no one else wanted to try. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“380,000… sold.” The auctioneer repeated the bid three times and concluded the auction.

The stealthy cultivator heaved a sigh of relief. It was fortunate that this didn’t go too far.

Others speculated that this cultivator could have been from Sky Hut, a descendant wanting to bring back their dao lord’s technique.

Of course, this was mere speculation since no one wanted to overly pry.
