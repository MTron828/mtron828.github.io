Chapter 4533: Fat Yu

“You dare to call our clan master fat?” The disciples of the Yu glared at him but didn’t seem to be particularly offended.

“Fine, can my ancestor call him that then? Given our clans’ relationship, you all should be kneeling to my ancestor, even Fat Yu would need to do so.” Jian Ming smiled.

The group then noticed Wise Ancestor.

Jian Ming immediately introduced Li Qiye and Wise: “Our ancient ancestor and the famous Wise Ancestor of the Wu. I’m sure you have heard of him before.”

Whether they knew Wise Ancestor or not, they still earnestly bowed towards the two. Though they didn’t kneel, this was still respectful enough.

Outsiders would find it surprising. The famous thieves actually conducted themselves like those from a proper clan?

“As I’ve said, our ancestors are here to speak to Fat Yu. Shouldn’t you let us in?” Jian Ming repeated.

“We need to report this to the ancestors.” The Yu members hesitated before replying.

The Yu were considered thieves due to some of their unsavory acts. They rarely interacted with outsiders and great powers.

The four clans were exceptions since they had ties with the Yu in the past. Later on, the Yu and the Tie had an alliance marriage. This helped with their relationship.

Of course, due to the Yu’s terrible reputation, this friendship was often kept a secret and direct contact was limited.

“Invite our guests.” A voice came from above. With that, the clouds suddenly parted and a gigantic ship could finally be seen.

Of course, clouds weren’t enough to hide something so massive. There was a stealth spatial technique at work here.

“Young Noble, up we go.” Jian Ming smiled at the group.

“This is my first time boarding the ship.” Wise Ancestor said.

“Haha, it’s actually bigger than it seems, it’s an independent realm.” Jian Ming has been here several times before and laughed: “It is their ancestral ground, these thieves have lived here for generations now, always floating around and stealing. That’s their way of keeping up with their ancestors’ traditions.”

“It’s a nice ship.” Li Qiye commented.

“Its name is God Vessel.” The daoist said: “Our ancestors have read their fortune before, helping them escape from the great calamity and actually benefiting from it.”

“I’ve heard of this before. They consider themselves to be the Yu but I think they’re just a side branch.” Jian Ming said.

“Wrong.” The daoist said: “Their ancestor was certainly from the main branch, it’s just that he was a sinner and was imprisoned. This allowed him to focus and become a greater cultivator. When the calamity came, the prison broke down and he came across God Vessel, eventually starting the current Yu clan. So you’re right that they’re no longer the orthodox branch. The original clan wouldn’t recognize them. After all, the Yu was a prestigious clan who wouldn’t allow any misconduct.”

“Well, either way, the Yu is no longer around, so they’re the Yu.” Jian Ming said.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye said.

The group then flew onto the ship. Once they got up, they found that it was actually even larger than expected. This was nothing short of a floating island.

Though the members of the Yu looked a bit rough, their manners were just fine when interacting with Li Qiye’s group. A prestigious bloodline still flowed in their veins.

Therefore, though they were bandits, they chose to be cultured bandits instead of reckless criminals.

The reception took place in the main hall. The clan master of the Yu was already there.

As Jian Ming had mentioned, he was rather fat. His body looked like a mountain of flesh. When he walked, his fat would jiggle.

He wore an expensive robe and shiny golden rings with five-colored jades embedded to them. This ostentatious look made him look like a pampered young master, not a bandit.

Deep in his eyes was a fierce glow - something that would catch others off guard. When he became serious, he would resemble a tiger ready to lunge on its prey. His fat frame wouldn’t affect his speed in the slightest.

“Yo, long time no see, fatty.” Jian Ming greeted in a familiar manner.

The clan master glared at him and said: “Brat, nothing good comes with your visit. Last time you snuck some of our disciples out, I haven’t forgotten.”

“Don’t worry, I’m just teaching them how to be good people instead of bandits. Plus, I’m doing it for free, what more do you want?” Jian Ming smiled.

“You’re itching for a beating?” The clan master uttered coldly.

Jian Ming wasn’t afraid at all even though this fat clan master was immensely strong, on the same level as leaders of the great powers.

“Fatty, watch your mouth in the presence of our ancient ancestor. Say the wrong thing and he might destroy your clan, you’ll be homeless then.” Jian Ming came closer and whispered.

One could see that these two were rather close. This was because Jian Ming regularly disposed of stolen goods for them, not to mention the closeness of the clans.

“Fatty, hurry up and greet the young noble.” He then said loudly to put on an act. He couldn’t let his clan know that he was helping the Yu with illegal transactions. Otherwise, his seniors would give him a harsh beating. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I, Yu Zun, respectfully greet the young noble and Wise Ancestor.” He bowed to greet the two. His large frame seemingly made the hall tremble a bit during the bow.
