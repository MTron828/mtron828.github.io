Chapter 5745: All Suffering Stems From Greed

The sheer size of the expanse astounded everyone, apex cultivators included.

They possessed immense avatars of unimaginable size - the head touching the heaven and the earth stomping the ground. Stars circled around them.

However, these avatars still looked tiny like a speck of dust in this celestial river - just another drop in the ocean. Thus, reaching the other shore became an impossibility.

Nevertheless, apex cultivators could jump infinitely through space and dimensions. With enough time and patience, they could still reach the destination before being trapped forever or obliterated by random storms.

Li Qiye took out something and placed it on the boat. It seemed to detect the river and released bright rays.

At first, they were disorderly and unstable. As the boat moved forward, they stabilized and came together to point in a particular direction, serving as a compass for Meru.

He used an oar to guide the boat without asking Li Qiye about the destination. This seemed like an endless journey akin to a withered leaf drifting with the wind in a boundless ocean.

Terrible storms detonated around them. A tsunami suddenly formed amidst the peaceful ocean, sending the boat to the sky.

This could scare the wits out of anyone but Meru remained calm and gripped his oar tightly, redirecting the boat.

After they made it through the storms, they were met by a massive maelstrom - one large enough to grind the six continents to pieces in the blink of an eye. In fact, that region wouldn’t be considered sufficient as an appetizer.

“Rumble!” It pulled the spatial fabrics of reality inside and crushed them into smithereens. The flesh stood no chance in hell. Emperors would become alarmed and find themselves in a fatal situation.

Meru roared and seemingly traveled through time with the boat, displaying flawless mastery with his control. He used the momentum of the maelstrom to increase speed and change direction at the right time, treading on the thin line between life and death.

He followed the direction of the light compass without fail, able to traverse any storm and peril. Although the boat moved at an incredible speed, it felt like floating on a serene lake.

“Sacred Teacher, can we save all living beings?” After crossing another storm and reaching a calm area, he asked.

“Why should that be done?” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Do you not wish to save them, to deliver them away from suffering and to paradise?” He asked again.

“Elaborate on this paradise.” Li Qiye said.

“A place absent of worries, fear, delusion.” He solemnly responded and still looked like an enlightened Buddhist despite his current form. Others couldn’t help wanting to kneel before him.

“It’s a fantasy world, Buddhas and monks themselves cannot reach this state, how can they possibly enlighten others? The fact that you wish to do so shows that you have worries on your mind.” Li Qiye said.

“...” He took a second before responding: “You imply that we should do nothing and that’s the best route?”

“Living beings are ignorant, their lives are arranged by stronger ones, hence their suffering. The source is none other than greed.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Of course.” He agreed.

“This applies to Buddhism as well. Suffering pervades its land and the cause is none other than its doctrine.” Li Qiye continued.

“I don’t agree, Sacred Teacher. Buddhism is mercy, seeking to deliver salvation.” He said.

“This so-called salvation centers around Buddha, seems like becoming slaves more than anything.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What is paradise to you then, Sacred Teacher?” He asked again.

“Anima.” Li Qiye said: “Born for the true self and die for the true self, with that, one can find happiness even in suffering, that’s paradise.”

He shook his head and said: “Anima can only be obtained by the highest level of emperors, regular ones could never reach it.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“If you do not possess a true self, why do you as an emperor have a true self? Where did your true self come from?” Li Qiye smiled and caused Meru to fall into silence again.

“The true self is always there, you didn’t create anima or open it. The anima found by an emperor is merely one type of manifestation.” Li Qiye said: “For example, Buddhists say that Buddha is in the heart, only in an unawakened form. To wake up is to become a Buddha. The difference is that when all living beings are considered Buddhas, what happens to their true selves? From anima to Buddha is only twisting its form. Not everyone wants to become Buddha yet they are still forcefully converted.”

“Sacred Teacher, it sounds like you are not pleased with Buddhism.” He said.

“It’s not a matter of personal displeasure.” Li Qiye said: “You consider your Pure Land to be paradise but are the inhabitants not slaves?”
