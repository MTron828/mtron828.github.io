The circling chaos affinity made it look like he had existed from time antiquity, a primordial being.

As he took one step forward, Divine Black hymned in harmonization. Chaos appeared in the entire sect.

This phenomenon took them by a storm, from the weakest disciple all the way to Ping Suoweng.

Li Qiye’s smallest gesture could drag their sect right now. Its power existed in each breath of his.

By opening his mouth and blowing, the power contained in the grand vein would immediately attack like a destructive tornado.

Thus, his slight movements became frightening. One swing was enough to crush the area.

“Chaos Mantra...” The awed spectators murmured the title.

Everyone could learn this mantra. In fact, versions of the mantra could be found in every street and alley in the mortal world.

Nowadays, no cultivator would want to train this lowest level mantra. Only mortals without backing would do so.

As for Divine Black, the disciples thought that their South Fence Mantra was countless times stronger. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

No one thought that this Chaos Mantra could be of use. Some even believed that the seven mantras were only meant for mortals’ physical wellbeing and a little life prolongment, nothing more.

Thus, what Li Qiye had done was beyond imagination. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that no other mantra could compare to it.

“No need to worry about any other mantra when Chaos can reach this height.” The bodhi king was pale from seeing this.

Suoweng was shaken too. He had asked Li Qiye about his demands before, perhaps a merit law or mantra from Divine Black?

He didn’t understand why Li Qiye chose the seven mantras back then. The sect had plenty of choices.

Now, he finally understood that Li Qiye could do anything. The strongest mantras from Divine Black were nothing to him.

“This is all you can do?” Li Qiye stretched, seemingly bored from the battle.

The duo lost their morale and staggered backward. They felt fear because their strongest attacks didn’t hurt Li Qiye in the slightest.

Of course, they didn’t have a grasp of his mastery in Chaos. Nonetheless, they could tell that he was one with Divine Black, allowing him to possess unfathomable power.

They have never felt this much fear before. After all, they were powerful and had prestigious backings. Alas, they could see the shadow of a death god looming over them.

The crowd became reticent, not daring to breathe loudly. Most were in awe of Li Qiye’s abilities since he survived the mighty blow earlier.

They also thought that realms and limits meant nothing to him. Li Qiye had jumped out of all restraints; he was the son of miracles.

“My turn.” Li Qiye stared at the two and smiled.

The smile scared the hell out of Zhan Hu and Huang Ning, akin to the death god waving at them. They got a chill running down their spine; their hands became wet with sweat.

However, they had no other option. Accepting defeat wasn’t possible at this point. They might be able to save their lives but not their reputation and status in Divine Black.

The two of them exchanged glances and immediately came up with a new plan.

They walked forward with their chest arching upward, their back straight, and their head high. This was necessary in order to build confidence and courage. Fear would only result in a worse defeat.

“We’re going to the end, show us what you got!” Zhan Hu shouted. A tiger roar came from within him like the awakening of a divine tiger.

“Don’t worry, I won’t be using anything but Black Tortoise. Are you two ready to go? I’m about to start.” Li Qiye smiled.

Tortoise Fist has been looked down on all this time by the audience. They thought that it wouldn’t be able to break Zhan Hu’s armor. Now, everyone and the duo became afraid.

Li Qiye’s technique no longer mattered the moment that chaos affinity showed up around him.

“Go!” The duo crazily roared.

“Raa!” Zhan Hu’s majestic vitality and power erupted along with true chaos energy. His armor assumed a bloody radiance.

A divine tiger finally showed up, looking ferocious with an oppressive aura. Its power surged out like a storm.

This was only the beginning. As Zhan Hu added his various affinities to the armor, Huang Ning placed both hands on the armor.

“Boom!” Huang Ning’s own powers surged into Zhan Hu’s body.

The former’s bamboo stick exuded a verdant light. The leaves pulsed with starry lights.

A totem in the form of a golden vine emerged behind Huang Ning. This opened a floodgate of power pouring into Zhan Hu. He became several hundred times stronger as a result.

“Boom!” The totem of his armor also took form.

The divine tiger materialized into physical form. Stars circled around its head while its feet ravaged the ground. It was larger than the tallest peak in Divine Black. Just one stomp could flatten the stage.

The crowd gasped in response. They felt like ants before this great divine tiger.

Huang Ning with the help of his bamboo stick helped Zhan Hu’s armor reach its ultimate form.
