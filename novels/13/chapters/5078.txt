Chapter 5079: Invisible

Was he going to fight a top conqueror with a dried branch? All the spectators were left speechless.

Even Li Qiye’s biggest fans thought that he was being too careless. Of course, this was rather expected out of Li Qiye.

Conceal only gazed at Li Qiye and didn’t bother expressing her displeasure.

“Don’t mind it, I don’t have a suitable weapon so I’m using this.” Li Qiye said.

“Good, we shall begin then.” She coldly uttered and released her murderous intent.

The crowd felt as if the murderous strands of energy could pierce through and deliver them to the next life.

“Go.” Li Qiye lazily waved the branch, looking casually as if she was only an ordinary opponent.

She took one step forward and disappeared from sight, leaving no trace behind.

Thousand-eyed Sovereign immediately focused up. He had a heaven-defying ability to observe everything nearby. Alas, he couldn’t spot her.

Powerful ancestors activated their heavenly gaze and couldn’t find her either.

“Her stealth dao is unmatched.” Thousand-faced said, thinking that other conquerors and dao lords wouldn’t be able to find her either.

It seemed that her dao had improved to the next level after fighting Eight-stallion, nearly reaching a state of apogee. She would put Shadowrider to shame if she had chosen the path of assassination.

“Not bad.” Li Qiye said before casually thrusting the branch randomly forward.

“Pop!” It pierced through time and space and forced an ethereal figure out in the open.

She instantly disappeared again; only top masters saw her clearly. Other cultivators only saw a flashing shadow or nothing at all.

“Interesting.” Li Qiye chuckled and thrust his branch again at an unexpected angle, piercing through several dimensions and making curved changes repeatedly.

This backhand thrust’s trajectory and curve defied conventional wisdom. This just wasn’t something cultivators normally practiced. This resembled threading a needle through different dimensions, moving between them effortlessly.

“Pop!” She was forced out again and became startled.

She wasn’t arrogant enough to think that she was the best and that no one could break her stealth dao.

Due to her mastery, mightier conquerors could force her out but this was a gradual process. In this case, Li Qiye did it with each thrust as if he had a full view of her movements.

A hum could be heard as her dao crisscrossed and intersected with slashes around Li Qiye. This was another focus of her dao, using enlightenment as blades capable of slicing through heaven and earth.

Cultivators exclaimed in horror. Merit laws and treasures couldn’t stop the overwhelming energy blades. Running away didn’t work because they could sever dimensions as well.

Ancient ancestors felt a chill coursing down their necks, getting the feeling of blood splashing out after decapitation.

“Rumble!” Li Qiye’s body withstood the slashes like nothing. Not even a single mark was left behind.

Conceal’s expression changed after seeing this. She had only seen this once before - Eight-stallion Dao Lord with his immortal shield. Her slicing dao couldn’t get through that defense. Alas, could Li Qiye’s body be just as tough as that immortal shield?

“Die!” She resorted to using her murderous dao - Seven-step Death.

She took seven steps in the blink of an eye and gathered momentum for a perfect slash. The world seemed to be flipped over, unable to withstand this attack.

“Boom!” Spectators were thrown flying before tumbling to the ground, unable to move. They screamed since they were experiencing the illusion of being dismembered.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

This move could kill dozens of dragon lords in an instant, even the more impressive ones. Venerable Dragon God touched his neck and looked down to see his fingers covered in blood.

“Clank!” Li Qiye lifted his branch and stopped the slash, shocking his opponent.

“It’s a decent move, but observe, this is the real dao of assassination.” He smiled and thrust the withered branch forward from a weird angle.
