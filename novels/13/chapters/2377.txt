The great eye focused on Li Qiye, causing an eruption of stars.

It eventually answered: “To see through my eye is not just destruction, it is damnation. So many heroes have fallen to the darkness, unable to stand strong after borrowing my sight.”

“I thank you for your consideration.” Li Qiye smiled: “Perhaps I am not the strongest in history and certainly not the most brilliant, but my dao heart allows me to stand tall.”

The intent took its time thinking before speaking: “So be it, prepare yourself.”

With that, the eye squinted. A magnificent scene appeared like the instant collapse of numerous galaxies and forced to converge onto a single point!

“Boom!” It sent off a pulse containing the power of these galaxies with a power greater than a big bang.

Previously, Everlasting Kingdom had also gathered the power of a sect to send out a pulse. This pulse was akin to a drop of water amidst the storm compared to this one. Even Yang Radiance or Vermillion Martial Court would turn to dust in a split second before this pulse.

True Emperors and Eternals were no match. Progenitors would find themselves in a precarious situation before something so mighty.

“Pop!” When the pulse struck Li Qiye, he wasn’t sent flying right away.

“Crack!” Under its bombardment, his body disintegrated. His muscles and bones shot out like specks of dust. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Remember, his physical body has experienced numerous trials. Once he activated its strongest state, he wouldn’t have a problem withstanding a heavenly tribulation directly. This pulse was far worse.

The Primordial Will appeared and the three maelstroms began to rotate to stop the pulse. His twelve laws poured down for more protection.

“Boom!” The pulse became brighter. The death of a million suns wouldn’t have the same intensity. This was the limit of luminosity.

At this point, even progenitors might not be able to stop this pulse. Keep in mind that this was only a single glare from the eye.

Li Qiye’s thirteen palaces instantly turned into an ancient expanse, allowing him to jump above everything as if he was the ruler of the high heaven.

“My law is eternal!” He chanted. The primordial tree opened an entirely new epoch. A world came into existence from the chaos with life starting again under his reign.

His one thought could bring about light; another could turn it to darkness. One to create an immortal; another to become a devil. He could create celestial bodies and everything in existence; yin in one hand and yang in the other. He became as great as Creation itself.

Progenitors would need to run before this form of Li Qiye, unless they were seeking death. Only a being like this eye could force Li Qiye to go all out. Progenitors weren’t qualified to do so.

“Rumble!” Li Qiye pushed against the pulse and began walking towards the depth of the eye.

Each step was walking on a temporal period, tracing back to the very source in order to see a non-existing past.

No one could ever research this period. For example, Samsara Wild Ancestor could go back to his own period on the river of time.

However, if he were standing here right now, he couldn’t reach the incoming years in front of his step because this had exceeded his limit. He would go on forever, only to find nothing but failure.

Li Qiye finally returned to the source and saw a great explosion. Everything was back to the beginning - no Three Immortals, no tenth and nine worlds, no light, no darkness...

During these long-forgotten years, the terror reigned. Supremes and invincible beings were mere ants, serving as food.

Hopelessness pervaded. This was the real source of darkness. Samsara used to call himself this, which was true only to his own epoch.

Compared to this real source, what he did was only child’s play.

Before this terror, how could one find hope? This went on for generations, eras... epochs happened like the blink of an eye.

Not to mention normal people, even great overlords and supremes surrendered to evil...

Like the eye had said, this terrible history could make one give up. Who would actually want to witness this reality?

“This is what I was searching for. The answer has been in the heart of everyone. Only through knowledge will I be able to win.” Li Qiye murmured.

His dao heart allowed him to stay sane. Though power was crucial, a fortified mind was even more important. Otherwise, the weak-minded masters would only add to the suffering, becoming the claws of darkness.

Li Qiye continued testing his dao heart against this dark history. Meanwhile, it was very exciting in Myriad Lineage.

Vermillion Martial Court has sent wedding invitations to all the systems and big shots in Myriad. Mu Shaochen and Wu Bingning will have a great ceremony at the martial court.

This might be the grandest wedding ceremony within the last few generations. Anyone with just a little fame had a chair waiting for them.

“We welcome everyone to join in this celebration. Of course, Brother Li Qiye is included. After all, not too many can defeat me.” Mu Shaochen showed his face and released this provocative statement.

The crowd was astonished by the audacity of this guy. Utterly defeated yet still want to go against Li Qiye again?

“He wants to go to the death.” An expert said.

Nevertheless, this type of provocation was effective and rather domineering. Everyone knew that Wu Bingning belonged to Fiercest’s camp.

“Shaochen is still alive. This might have something to do with the Mu’s immortal art.” An old ancestor shuddered after finding out.

Being turned into nothingness yet still alive? This particular art was quite heaven-defying.

“Well, even if Shaochen has more ace cards up his sleeve, he still can’t take on Fiercest.” The majority had no confidence in him.

Not long ago, they thought he could sweep through the world uncontested, but after witnessing Li Qiye’s strength, they had a new perspective.
