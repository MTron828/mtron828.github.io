Chapter 5507: Dao Path

Although the comment insulted Sunset Glow Valley, it truly couldn’t compare to the behemoths such as Immortal Dao City. Nonetheless, Li Qiye made it sound like they weren’t worth a single coin.

“We do not dare to insist if that is against your will, Young Noble.” Qing Baifeng let out a sigh.

“Hmm, not as insistent as your senior sister.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Her mindset and optimism are exceptional but I will try my best.” Baifeng said softly.

“Now that’s a better answer. Whatever you lack on the dao path, you can make it up with the dao heart later.” He nodded approvingly.

“I appreciate your advice, Young Noble.” She bowed and said: “I have to go as well. Please come to Sunset Peak if you can, our grand ceremony commences soon.”

Li Qiye nodded and didn’t say anything else. She bowed again and left the hall.

He stared at the central statue and became sentimental due to the familiar face. Some, once parted, could never meet again for they are separated just like heaven and earth.

He extended his hand and closed his fingers, activating the ancient runes on the tablet. They became resplendent, seemingly returning to life.

“Buzz.” They flew toward his palm like bees returning to the nest. It didn’t take long before all of them were there, initiating a dao derivation process. Eventually, they fused with his palm and disappeared from sight.

However, the tablet still looked the same and the runes were still there. It was as if nothing had happened.

Only those with enough determination and comprehension would eventually note a difference. The runes’ true power and auras have been taken - only their physical shell remained.

“Was this the right choice? There was still time.” He sighed and said while looking at her statue.

Alas, the statue didn’t respond. He stood up and started walking toward the entrance.

“Young Noble, have a safe journey. I hope the beautiful sunset will always accompany you.” The old woman appeared out of nowhere and waved at him.

“Goodbye, may the sunset be with you too.” He nodded and wished her well.

He left the temple and entered the valley, seeing a vast mountain range. The sect was entirely independent and self-sufficient - the home of both mortals and cultivators.

They didn’t mingle with the outside world and continued to be reclusive after the era of Cloudsweep Fairy.

Of course, they were rather prosperous and populated now compared to their darkest days. They had enough territories to maintain the isolation.

Li Qiye walked around until he reached a town sharing the same name as the valley - the home for many disciples and mortals.

Cloudsweep Fairy herself chose to stay here instead of Sunset Peak. Rumor has it that she was the one who built this town.

Every brick and tile of her house contained her love and emotion as she spent her last days here. Thus, many disciples viewed the town as a second ancestral ground.

Despite being a town, the place was lively with merchants and mortals - a stark contrast to the transcending air of Sunset Peak. This made it more pleasant to be around.

Li Qiye was surprised to see the architectural style of the town. This made memories of the past appear in his mind.

The structures were different from the current style in the six continents, even the thirteen continents and Eight Desolaces.

No one could recognize the style now because it belonged to Crimson Night Kingdom of the nine worlds. This style could no longer be seen anywhere else in the world.

As someone who had lived during that epoch and visited Crimson Night, he immediately recalled these memories.

Of course, the inhabitants themselves didn’t know the reason why their town was built differently than the outside world.

He became emotional and understood why she chose to stay here instead of Sunset Peak. She traveled through worlds, hoping to find a certain someone.

The immortal continent was not home and she had no intention of staying here at first. Other emperors and dao lords came here for the sake of cultivation, wanting to become stronger.

This was not her goal. She would have preferred to stay in the nine worlds if it wasn't for the search.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The thing that kept her here were the words “Sunset Glow”, the scripture that started it all. These characters were friends who accompanied her through her quest. She believed that as long as she remained diligent, she would have been able to see him again.

In the end, she realized that time was running out. Thus, she built this town and turned it into home.

He could feel her emotions and thoughts while gazing at the small town. She could have gone farther on the dao path but she picked Sunset Glow.

“Should have kept on going on the dao path, don’t stop for anyone…” He said wistfully.
