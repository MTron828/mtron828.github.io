Chapter 5317: Slam

Another statue of Heaven’s Allure with the same charm as the previous one. Staring at it was a dangerous game; someone managed to carve out her peerless appearance and demeanor through impeccable workmanship.

From this alone, one could tell that seeing her in person would have a devastating effect on the mind, especially on youthful cultivators. Interestingly enough, this statue had a different demeanor and pose.

“Another wonderful piece of art. It has to be a true master.” Li Zhitian said with admiration.

Li Qiye raised his hand again for a dao search. He derived the mysteries of the statue and sure enough, the same lustful moans and lovely whispers could be heard. Black liquid with a high viscosity flowed out again.

“It’s getting more and more confusing.” Zhitian commented.

“Someone is trying to attract primal darkness.” Li Qiye said.

“Primal darkness?” Zhitian wasn’t familiar with this name.

“It’s that incomplete product.” Li QIye said.

“Do you know the reason why someone’s doing this?” Zhitian asked.

“They know about primal darkness.” The old servant answered.

Few in this world knew about the creature known as primal darkness.

“Indeed, it must have been hiding in Reborn the entire time. Someone wants to lure it out.” Li Qiye said.

“If that’s the case, why resort to using these statues? They can entice this primal darkness?” Zhitian asked.

“That’s the interesting part. Why was Heaven’s Allure chosen?” Li Qiye nodded and found it strange.

“Maybe she’s the one who did it?” Zhitian had a bold guess.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No, she doesn’t need to return to the upper continents given her current position in Celestial Court, definitely not Evil Reborn either.” THe old servant shook his head.

“Regardless of who it is or the reason for the statues, it is successful.” Li Qiye stared at the thick liquid.

“So this primal darkness was here?” Zhitian also stared in the same direction.

“Yes, it came and had latched into the statues.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Why do I feel like this is another perverted scenario or something bad will happen soon?” Zhitian shuddered and had a terrible premonition.

“Someone, a conqueror at the very least, has a plan. The exact goal? Who knows?” Li Qiye smiled: “This person has a deep understanding of primal darkness and knows what it wants. Moreover, it must have taken immense effort to carve these statues.”

“What does the primal darkness do to warrant this much effort?” The old servant asked a key question.

“Is it strong?” Zhitian asked.

“The motive is difficult to speculate since the strongest can still be reduced to ashes. This mystery can only be solved through more clues.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“I wonder if there’s a connection between primal darkness and Heaven’s Allure.” Zhitian said: “Senior, do you know Heaven’s Allure’s background?”

“I do not.” The servant responded.

“It’s fine, we’ll figure it out in due time.” Li Qiye said before leaving the world of magma.

They saw the tiger-like creatures leaving their lair in order to find food. Unfortunately, this was ill-timed because they became prey to a dragon instead.

“Raa!” One appeared out of nowhere and swallowed up an entire pack.

“Screech!” Suddenly, a blinding radiance manifested above the dragon.

A peacock spread its tail and released five-colored rays and particles along with sharp dao lord laws.

The dragon was frightened and tried to escape. Alas, it was caught by the peacock’s claws.

It spewed out flames but this was useless - the battle was far from even. Its flesh was ripped apart by the claw.

It bellowed in agony until its belly was torn apart, resulting in death and becoming the peacock’s meal.

As for the tiger-like beasts, they were paralyzed on the ground, unable to run. The peacock then devoured a thousand of them in one go, far more brutal than the dragon.

“Peacock Dao Lord…” Li Zhitian recognized the peacock.

“Screech!” The bird noticed the group leaving the cave and immediately attacked with its sharp claws.

“Bam!” Li Qiye slammed the bird down to the ground, creating a crater upon impact and causing it to vomit blood.

The group was no stranger to Li Qiye’s power. Nonetheless, it was still an impressive spectacle to see him take down a colossal bird so quickly.

“Dao Brother, please show mercy, it’s a misunderstanding.” Peacock Dao Lord turned back to his human form and bowed to Li Qiye.
