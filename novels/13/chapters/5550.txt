Chapter 5551: The Immortal Gates Are Closed

“I don’t know the answer since I’ve only heard news of it from the general of West Bank.” Guo Cheng said: “Everyone is staying in Immortal Dao City including Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan and Immortal Emperor Fei Yang. Luminous Conqueror is in charge of Dao City now.”

“I wonder if something is happening there.” Baifeng took a deep breath.

Immortal Dao City was The People’s bastion, allowing them to fight against Celestial Court. Its strongest members resided there including the legendary Puresun Dao Lord. They were the only ones capable of fighting against Light-dragon and Heaven Burial Conqueror.

Alas, they have closed their gates recently.

“Can others still enter even if the emperors choose to not come out?” Baifeng asked.

“I have no way of knowing, perhaps only Luminous Conqueror or someone of a similar stature can answer.” Guo Cheng said.

“Hmm, why are the old geezers acting like turtles hiding in their shells? It’s not like a supreme existence is out to scare them, and plus, they’re no cowards.” Niu Fen said.

Guo Cheng became startled after hearing this and clenched his lips, not daring to say anything improper regarding the invincible cultivators, unlike this arrogant person.

“Doesn’t have to be an enemy, could be a fortune instead so they’re wary of greedy eyes.” Li Qiye said.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“If the emperors won’t come out, what is the response to an attack from Celestial Court?” Baifeng worried.

“Celestial Court cannot take down the gates of Immortal Dao City.” Niu Fen shook his head.

“But Dao Domain is exposed, Celestial Court can gain territories.” She said.

“It depends on the others then, whether they want to fully support Dao City. This depends on Imperial Field’s attitude.” Niu Fen smiled.

He didn’t have that much loyalty toward The People on the six continents. He merely fought against Heaven Alliance because he disliked Celestial Court. It had nothing to do with a sense of justice or comradery.

“!” Baifeng’s expression soured because Momentous Frontier could be dragged into this mess as well.

“Young Noble, would the deities of Momentous Frontier be able to stop an assault from Celestial Court?” She asked Li Qiye.

“I’m afraid they have their problems right now. Stopping Celestial Court will be difficult.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I’m sure Celestial Court will take advantage of this.” Despite being treated as an immortal in her homeland, she was nothing before the behemoth known as Celestial Court.

“Mobilization would be a good thing, it’s more troublesome if they close their gates as well.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Haha, I agree.” Niu Fen said excitedly: “Celestial Court is boundless, imagine having to find those old turtles in their caves, one by one. If they just swarm like bees, it’ll be easier, catching all in one go.”

Guo Cheng and Baifeng didn’t dare to comment because this matter was far above their station.

“Fairy and Immortals, Scholar Tree City is ahead, it is suffering the most from the disasters.” Guo Cheng said.

They couldn’t make it into the city before being stopped by a powerful group of cultivators. Their auras made mortals tremble in horror from miles and miles away. All had the same silver armor with a glow capable of illuminating the sky.

It consisted of Heavenly Sovereigns and dragon lords. Mortals would view them as an army from heaven.

It was surprising to see a cultivation army inside Momentous Frontier. Under normal circumstances, the deities would never allow this.

“Guo Cheng, I’ve been waiting for you.” The leader was a youth with an impressive aura, looking like the heaven’s favorite. His dragon lord aura could sweep through an entire region.

His presence resembled a great dragon descending into a river and causing a tsunami.

“Fairy Qin?” He saw Guo Cheng first before seeing the others standing behind him.

“Fellow Daoist Wang Chong.” Baifeng responded: “Why is your army here?”

The youth was a genius from the imperial clan of West Bank. He currently served as a heavenly general.

“I heard news of Momentous Frontier’s trouble and came to offer our assistance. The army will do everything it can to help the people here.” Wang Chong said proudly.

“Momentous Frontier does not need your assistance. The deities will take care of this.” Baifeng said.

“I don’t think so.” Wang Chong shook his head and said: “I don’t think the deities are here anymore. Otherwise, why would the land be ravaged by disasters?”

“The deities have their plan, your imperial clan needs not to concern yourself with this.” Baifeng said seriously.

“I’ve been to many places and never saw the deities taking action. In my opinion, they have abandoned Momentous Frontier. It seems like we need to take charge now.” Wang Chong said.

“You need to choose your words carefully, Fellow Daoist.” Baifeng’s eyes narrowed.

The imperial clan might be strong but this Wang Chong only had four fruits, certainly not her opponent.

“I’m not being unreasonable here. Look at the disasters, in this city alone is a plague or an incurable curse. I plan on burning it down to stop the spread.” Wang Chong said.

“What?! There are millions of people living here!” Guo Cheng became startled.

“This is necessary to stop the curse.” Wang Chong said: “If the deities no longer care about the land, we shall assume responsibility.”

“You mustn’t! Think of the inhabitants!” Guo Cheng shouted.

“Mere insects, no big deal to burn them all.” Wang Chong repeated.
