Chapter 5096: Want Revenge?

“It’s your choice now. You’re not an assassin and I don’t need an assassin.” Li Qiye said.

“I am not an assassin indeed.” She agreed.

She was different from Shadowrider in this regard. The latter also followed the same dao but he trained for the sake of becoming an assassin king.

As for her, she did it for the dao itself, not for killing or money. This was her pursuit.

“The start usually decides everything.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

She didn’t quite understand his point but knew that he was a man with a deep history.

“What do you want me to do?” She asked.

“That’s a question you will have to answer yourself, what kind of conqueror do you want to be?” He stared at her in response.

This required contemplation and inner reflection. She couldn’t answer right away.

He took her back to Eight-stallion. Her appearance shocked all the big shots and A’zhui.

Today, Li Qiye was a supreme existence. His very presence instilled both fear and a sense of prestige. It boosted a sect’s reputation a hundredfold.

The group didn’t expect Li Qiyye to be back so soon. Of course, they more than welcomed this. However, they didn’t expect to see Conceal Conqueror.

Venerable Dragon God and Northern Monarch didn’t seek revenge. These two were rivals and this was a personal matter.

After all, if she had lost, she would have been killed as well. This nearly happened several times when Eight-stallion Dao Lord still had his immortal shield.

The same couldn’t be said about A’zhui. The little girl despised Conceal for killing her father. She clenched her fists and glared at Conceal.

Nonetheless, she knew that this wasn’t the time to act up. She wasn’t a match for Conceal right now, not even with the help of her subjects.

“Want to avenge your father?” Conceal asked coldly.

The atmosphere became tense due to the disparity in power. This conqueror could easily destroy their dynasty.

“Yes.” A’zhui responded without any hesitation.

“Don’t let hatred blind you now. Train hard and once you’re strong enough, come and find me.” Conceal coldly uttered.

The seniors understood that this was a hopeless endeavor. Conceal was exceedingly talented, even more so than A’zhui’s father. There was a chance that she could become a twelve-fruit conqueror and seek the truth.

A’zhui, regardless of her effort, wouldn’t be able to reach this level. Thus, to live for the sake of vengeance meant living a pitiful and meaningless life.

“Your father doesn’t want you to avenge him.” Li Qiye said.

“How would you know?” A’zhui disagreed and scared the seniors. They didn’t want her to offend the monstrous existence.

“Have you killed before?” Li Qiye asked.

The girl didn’t answer and glanced over at Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God instead.

“True masters avenge themselves, to live and kill the enemies one day. They do not fear defeat and death.” Li Qiye said: “Only the weak will count on their progenies avenging them in the future, wanting their children to do something they could not?”

With that, he stared at A’zhui and asked: “Which is your father?”

She became emotional and knew the answer. Eight-stallion Dao Lord had never talked to her about this and even forbade his followers from participating.

It was a fair duel; a contest of power. He only blamed himself for being weaker than Conceal Conqueror.

“We appreciate your guidance, Young Noble.” Venerable Dragon God gently patted A’zhui’s shoulder and bowed.

The seniors understood that Li Qiye had done them a great favor. His return was rather significant as well. By this point, he would receive the highest treatment in any sect.

“You will understand your father once you’re older and strongest.” Li Qiye said: “Your dynasty has commendable members, keep at it.”

With that, he stretched and said: “I’m tired, time to rest.”

“I will arrange a place for you, Young Noble.” Fireblade led the way for Li Qiye.

While following the two, Conceal turned back and said: “If you want revenge, find me in the upper two continents in the future.”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A’zhui didn’t respond since this future was still so far away.

After the trio was gone, Venerable Dragon God told her: “His Majesty hoped to see you always smiling. He could have fled but he did not, choosing to fight bravely instead. He told me that it was a battle of destiny and honor.”

“I know.” She nodded.

Northern Monarch sighed as she listened. Even if A’zhui wanted revenge, she had a tough road ahead because Conceal was monstrously talented.

Moreover, she wouldn’t be alone either and might serve as a representative of Celestial Court. This was another reason why Eight-stallion didn’t want anyone to avenge him.

If he was such a weak-minded man, he would have escaped to Immortal City and be just fine.

“Eight-stallion Dynasty needs you.” Northern Monarch said softly.

“I know, I will not let it fall.” A’zhui wasn’t a fool. Instead of avenging her father, it was better to maintain his legacy. After all, he still worried about it before his last days.
