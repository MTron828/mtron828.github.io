Chapter 5141: Nothing To Do With Me

After Soaring Sword’s departure, the old man glanced at Li Qiye briefly before sighing and going back to clean a table.

“Supreme can only be stopped by a few.” He said.

Li Qiye smiled while the youth prepared tea for him again.

“They’re making a move soon.” Jun Landu stopped reading as well.

“What will you do?” The old man asked.

“Well, it has nothing to do with me, I don’t care about fighting and killing.” Landu shook his head.

“If the agreement breaks, everyone will be dragged into the mess.” The old man stared out the window.

“It won’t be Supreme alone.” Landu still knew about the political climate.

“Indeed.” The old man nodded. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Dao Alliance is in danger. The balance will be broken.” Landu became emotional.

“Brother All-things has a tough road in front of him.” The old man’s eyes narrowed.

“Sounds like you wish to join Dao Alliance.” Li Qiye smiled.

Among the four alliances of the upper continents, Divine and Heaven Alliance represented Celestial Court while Dao and Imperial Alliance supported Immortal Dao City and Imperial Field.

Imperial Alliance normally kept a low profile so the burden of protecting The People was on Dao Alliance.

“I am but a chef.” The old man said.

“Supreme definitely wants you to accelerate the process. When the balance is broken, everyone will have to pick a side just like back in Immemorial Epoch War, otherwise, Celestial Court will brand them as sinners.” Jun Landu said.

“Celestial Court.” The old man’s eyes turned cold.

Supreme alone couldn’t threaten the entire world but the same couldn’t be said about Celestial Court.

They represented numerous emperors and gods but most importantly, an unknown yet terrifying force.

In the past, the duck egg buyer and Immortal Emperor Zhan formed the ultimate coalition to attack Celestial Court. Although they won one battle after another, they still couldn’t take it down.

Though most emperors and dao lords haven’t seen this unknown force, they have heard rumors about it.

“I heard Principle Conqueror has abdicated.” Landu said: “This has to be the work of Celestial Court. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be leaving given his prestige and supporters.”

All along, Principle Conqueror preferred peace and always maintained a good relationship with Dao and Imperial Alliance. Because of this, the upper continents enjoyed peace for eras now.

Unfortunately, his spot was now taken by Sword Sea Dao Lord.

“Heaven and Divine will work together now, this is the prelude to a great war.” Landu smiled: “Will you join, Uncle?”

“Thinking about escaping a great war unscathed, hopeful but unrealistic.” The old man stared at him.

The immemorial war drastically reduced the number of emperors and monarchs. No one managed to stay clear of its reach.

The People suffered untold casualties and would have lost if it wasn’t for ancient forces joining in afterward.

Now, history was going to repeat itself. All the alliances and powers couldn’t stay neutral forever. Paradises were going to become war zones; top cultivators would find themselves experiencing a wake-up call about their invincibility.

After all, even the dominant Qian Clan fell from the conflict. Who else could claim immunity from another war of the same scale?

“I am just a free soul, the world won’t be able to pull me in.” Landu remained confident.

On the other hand, the old man was a famous master with more karmic ties.

“Master, should I gather our stuff?” The youth already had luggage and bedsheets rolled up.

“No rush, it’s not like I’m soiling my pants from being afraid of Supreme.” The old man smiled for he was afraid of no one.

The youth stopped panicking and sat back down.

“How vulgar, these racial wars.” Li Qiye put down the cup and said: “Ignore this mess… Celestial Court shall be destroyed.”

“The world will be at peace now!” Landu clapped happily after hearing this.

“Sir, you should visit Dao Alliance once.” The old man said.

“I’m not interested in Dao Alliance, only Celestial Court.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I understand.” The old man bowed.

“Sigh, it’s rare that we’re all together like this, don’t make it so boring with this talk.” Landu stood up and said: “We should be sightseeing, catch some fish and broil them.”

“Shall we?” Landu showed off his fishing pole.

“Hey, that’s ours.” The youth took a look and said.

“Hehe, I’m just borrowing it for a bit.” Landu smiled and asked the old man: “We’re gonna catch a soaring divine fish, are you in?”

“I still have to knead some dough later tonight, I’m not going.” The old man said.

“Sir, let’s go.” Landu turned toward Li Qiye.

“Very well.” Li Qiye got up and left.

“Goodbye, Sir.” The old man and the youth came outside to see Li Qiye away.

“Uncle, I hope I’ll be able to eat your noodles again.” Landu’s laughter came from a distance.

“I hope so.” The old man responded.

After the two were gone, the youth asked: “Master, what should we do? Will Supreme come?”

“It’ll be utter chaos once Supreme makes a move, All-things and the others will take action as well. This is not the right time and Supreme knows it as well.” The old man paused a bit before concluding: “This is only a warning.”

“We have to leave this place?” The youth worried.

“It doesn’t make a difference. A skirmish will only involve weak cultivators but in the case of an all-out war, it doesn’t matter where we are.” The old man said.

“And if Celestial Court joins?” The youth asked.

“Hmm…” The old man sighed and said: “Prepare a good coffin for me.”

“Master!” The youth panicked.

The old man said seriously: “In the worst-case scenario, no one will be able to escape. Celestial Court had failed several wars now so they’ll be prepared for the next. I am also prepared to die in battle.”

“Master, no one can defeat you.” The youth said.

“It’s because I haven’t fought someone stronger but this will change in the upcoming war.” The old man smiled.

“...” The youth had nothing to say.

“Everyone dies eventually, don’t be afraid. I will die proving that my path is correct. You need to train more now, I will pass down my legacy to you.” The old man said.

The youth nodded solemnly since this was his first time seeing his master being so serious.
