Chapter 4940: Sharp Tongue, Sharp Blade

Bloodsea, one of the Ten Monsters, has shown up again. He was a notorious figure despite not being the strongest dragon lord.

For example, the higher-ranking monsters were naturally stronger than him. However, he might be more feared than them because he had no shackles.

He roamed solo and uninhibited, a master in the art of killing. He moved with the speed of a tempest, unstoppable in his pursuit. The second-place ranker of the ten, Shadowrider, was also similar in this regard. The difference between the two of them was that one was more of an assassin while the other was a killer. Shadowrider would try to kill the enemies using any means necessary for the sake of money. Bloodsea was often more direct and didn’t require such reasons.

The students immediately thought about the rumors of him being from here. Though the academy never recognized this, it might actually be plausible.

“Must you join this muddled water, Brother?” Four-faced Venerable asked. He felt fear because Bloodsea was stronger, not to mention that he always followed through to the very end.

“Death to those who offend the academy.” He uttered coldly. Each word was threatening like the sound of a blade scraping flesh off the bones.

This sentence alone made students' legs tremble in fear. Everyone believed that he was from the academy even more. Otherwise, a lone wolf like him wouldn’t need to assist it.

“Brother, we are only trying to get back our stolen treasure, nothing more.” Three-armed Monarch said.

They didn’t wish to provoke Bloodsea. Other top masters were reasonable but the same couldn’t be said about him.

For example, these masters understood the significance of declaring war against Deity and its sects. Bloodsea, on the contrary, didn’t give a damn if he wanted to kill someone.

“No mercy, make your move.” Bloodsea said and slowly unsheathed his saber.

The saber intent was accompanied by palpable bloodlust. It was as if that blade had just decapitated someone and still had the stench. 

His chilling aura differed from the two dragon lords’. Theirs were endless but didn’t seem as fatal in comparison.

Nonetheless, the two dragon lords came to an agreement and decided to fight.

“Kill him!” They roared and worked together perfectly, not holding back in order to kill Bloodsea as fast as possible.

“Boom!” Three-armed summoned three treasures at the same time, one for each hand - a hammer, sword, and pagoda.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The first two caused massive physical destruction, while the pagoda transformed into a towering mountain, capable of subjugating the six dao. A tempest swept across the land, leaving the students apprehensive. 

The sages' faces spun rapidly, performing a rite to call forth a formidable tomb. The tomb descended, engulfing the laws of the world. It opened and started sucking everything in.

The students felt tiny and helpless, clinging to whatever they could to escape the venerable’s devouring winds.

Bloodsea replied with a resounding clang, his strike leaving a trail of light. His dao philosophy emphasized simplicity and decisiveness - a drawn blade must draw blood. His unique approach made him stand out even among more powerful cultivators.

"Rumble!" Bloodsea's slash left his opponents reeling with a deep wound. 

Had they been a split second slower, the strike would have been fatal. 

“You won't make it through the next one." Bloodsea’s bloodlust peaked, sheathing his saber for a speedy draw. The blade appeared to relish the taste of blood just now.

"Activate!" The two combatants were on edge, realizing the imminent threat of death. 

Bloodsea was a ruthless killer who showed no mercy, not even to the ancestors of Deity.

"Boom!" Three-armed Monarch gestured, summoning a hundred divine treasures with a single mudra.
