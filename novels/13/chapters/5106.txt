Chapter 5107: All Present

Li Qiye stood beneath the peak, looking insignificant compared to the imperious conqueror.

“The conquerors shall be triumphant.” Members of The Race clenched their fists, hoping to build confidence for the combatants and themselves.

After all, this battle could decide the fate of their alliance. If Li Qiye were to win, they wouldn’t be able to keep their head high for eras to come.

“The four conquerors will slay him with ease.” An ancient ancestor from The Race said with a hushed tone, not sounding absolutely confident.

“Li Qiye is the true lord of the lower continents, he’ll be victorious.” Someone from the opposing side shouted.

“Yes, no one else comes closer to touching him.” Many joined in.

“Masters have claimed to be unbeatable before but he proved them wrong.” Members of The People strongly supported Li Qiye for they knew the consequences otherwise.

“What do you have to say for yourself? Why did you destroy those sects and kill a conqueror?” Greenmountain spoke with a thunderous voice.

“And?” Li Qiye waved his hand with a smile.

“It is a crime punishable by death, the authority of Celestial Court cannot be challenged.” The conqueror gazed at Li Qiye and said.

“Brother, we should give him ample time to defend himself.” Another person descended from the sky.

The scroll is his hand fluttered to the wind and could blot out the world. Any cultivator being wrapped around by it would not be able to escape. Its master, Ascension Conqueror, had won numerous battles by using this method.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Fellow Daoist Li, you may provide an explanation for your action. We shall make a decision afterward.” He said.

“There’s nothing to say. Since you all are already here, you can’t come back empty-handed. The trip must have been difficult.” Li Qiye smiled.

Ascension’s eyes flashed as he attempted to see through Li Qiye. He felt that there was something off about this person.

As for the audience, both sides thought that he was being rather reasonable. Was this because he originally came from The People and wanted to protect Li Qiye?

“You’re right about that.” A beam of sword intent crossed through the air and left behind a scar.

This was just the sword energy alone. An actual slash could easily take down a relatively-large kingdom. A supreme beauty rode the beam and appeared before the crowd. People didn’t dare to appreciate her delicate features due to her cultivation.

“...” Older dragon lords became overwhelmed with love but only observed her from a distance. Alas, they didn’t have the power to actually be with her. In fact, just seeing her one more time was a dream come true for them.

“I won’t stop you from sharing your account of the events that have transpired.” Vessel said: “But if the accusation turns out to be true, you shall be punished.”

After all, she came from Swordgrasp and wouldn’t let this go easily.

“Whether I did it or not doesn’t matter. Just do what you have to do.” Li Qiye smiled.

“If you admit fault, you shall be eradicated in order to appease the souls of your victims.” Greenmountain said.

“Your bullshit is nauseating.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Do you confess?” At this point, another figure joined the battlefield with six rotating pots around him. These six pots have been his treasures ever since his dao debut. The reason why “six-pot” became his title was that he never used any different weapon or treasure.

“Does it matter? If I say that I didn’t do it, will you act as if nothing happened?” Li Qiye said.

“We can assess the situation accordingly depending on your answer. The truth is yet to be revealed.” Ascension remained relatively neutral.

Everyone thought that Li Qiye should at least defend himself before fighting the conquerors.

“Why did you destroy Heaven Burial?” Vessel asked. It was confusing due to the different methods employed by the perpetrator.

The foundations of Deity’s great powers weren’t destroyed. Otherwise, it would have taken them a long time to rebuild everything.

“I felt like it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I consider that as a declaration of war against Celestial Court.” Six-pot said with a serious tone.

The atmosphere changed the moment “Celestial Court” was brought up. This entity had always loomed above everyone, capable of easily suppressing them.
