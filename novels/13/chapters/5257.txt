Chapter 5258: Redflood

The embedded staff resembled a floating portal. No one knew what Suppression Conqueror wanted to do.

This was an entirely new variation of the staff. The conquerors who had fought him didn’t experience this either.

“Rumble!” Space and time started shaking violently while the staff exuded bright pulses and tiny dao laws.

The laws came together to form unique dao runes, also embedding themselves into space.

Space melted as a result and turned into a spatial liquid. The dimension within the octagonal shape started rotating even faster and turned into a maelstrom. Once the speed of the maelstrom reached the breaking point, it took the form of a black hole.

“Boom!” Endless power and light surged outward along with a wormhole. A portal manifested in the center.

Everyone could see the dangerous world on the other side - high temperature and perilous auras. The powers residing there caused instability in the upper continents.

Some dragon lords and conquerors were no strangers to this aura, hence their soured expression.

Lava engulfed this world; even the tallest peaks were still drowned in lava. Upon closer inspection, it might just be a different molten liquid with a similar viscosity.

Ancient weapons and could be seen - gigantic swords, cauldrons, and many others. Whether they be flowing with the current or standing still, there was one constant - that they were either damaged or still in an infantile form.

It seemed as if they were abandoned before completion or had clear defects and damages. Nonetheless, they still emitted a frightening aura of various offensive affinities.

This world resembled the cauldron of a supreme existence before it was abandoned, leaving these weapons behind.

Occasionally, the molten liquid would erupt into massive tsunamis or storms. This could cause devastating damage to the outside world.

“Redflood World!” One of them revealed its name.

“One of the four grand broken realms.” A dragon lord added.

Though some of them have traveled to this world before, this was a portal connecting the two realms directly.

“Incredible method.” A conqueror couldn’t help but praise Suppression.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Through his own grand dao and power, he managed to create a portal to the perilous Redflood inside his domain.

Conquerors and dragon lords had fallen there after making a single mistake. Evil Reborn, Perish, and Dao’s End were the other three broken realms.

“This is a genius conqueror for you.” Everyone unanimously acknowledged Suppression’s ability.

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye smirked after seeing this.

“You have your metal giants and I have Redflood. Today, I shall borrow its power to fight you.” Suppression said. [1]

Others exchanged glances after hearing this.

“He can actually harness Redflood’s power? That would be mind-blowing.” An ancient ancestor gasped.

“That’s Suppression for you.” Another responded.

“Why not?” Li Qiye smiled and agreed.

“Although I couldn’t control the metal giants, I was able to learn a dao through them to connect with Redflood. We will see if you can stop it.” Suppression said.

“I get it now.” Some listeners finally understood why Suppression was obsessed with keeping control of Imperial Attendant City.

After all, an eleven-fruit conqueror shouldn’t care about authority and influence. For example, although Sword Queen and All-things Dao Lord were leaders of the alliances, they rarely exercised this power or performed their duty.
