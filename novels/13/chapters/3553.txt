Chapter 3554: Entering Myriad Beast Mountains

Those in Buddha Emperor Division located at the plateau also started moving in the shadows. It was located in the center of Buddha Emperor Plateau, serving as the central division out of the five.

This floating city was one of the largest in the holy ground. Currently, Vajra Dynasty was in charge of this division.

According to the rumors, this division was created by Buddha Dao Lord. Thus, it became the core of the holy ground.

Though Sacred Mountain was the real supreme entity, it was too illusory. No one had an idea of its true location. Moreover, it never directly imposed its dominion, not even during the era of Buddha Dao Lord. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Thus, Buddha Emperor Division was in charge of administration and management. Therefore, its ruler also had authority over the rest of the holy ground while representing Sacred Mountain.

Of course, those capable of becoming the ruler of this dynasty were also qualified to reign, whether it be their power or intelligence.

In the past, Vajra Dynasty’s capital was far away from Buddha Emperor Division. This changed after they took over so they moved their capital here.

Today, the officials of the dynasty became alarmed after seeing the light. There has been a lull for a long time so the commotion made them contemplate.

“Is this a sign of the next era?” A few ambitious people had this thought.

After all, Vajra Dynasty has ruled for a very long time now. Many thought that it was time to abdicate.

If this were to happen, many among the five divisions would be eyeing the throne. Of course, it wasn’t that easy to take over Buddha Emperor. Whoever did it would need the support of the other four divisions then the approval from Sacred Mountain.

Nonetheless, Vajra has ruled for several generations and people have grown impatient. Just a gust of implication was enough to tempt them.

Of course, the majority of officials didn’t share this thought. One general gazed towards the mountain range and said: “If a ferocious beast is coming, that’s my time to make a name for myself.”

The holy ground always enjoyed peace, both internal and external. So many generals and experts hoped for something to happen so that they could finally be of use.

All in all, it didn’t take long before many sent troops towards the mountain range.

The calmest of the five divisions turned out to be Mortal King Division. It didn’t react at all.

This division had the lowest population and land. However, it was perhaps the most dangerous with inaccessible strongholds and traps.

A sect one said that at the plateau, it was better to provoke Heavenly Dragon Temple rather than Mortal King Division.

The former was strong but it consisted of kind, merciful monks. They would most likely spare their opponents.

On the other hand, the members of Mortal King might actually eradicate a sect once furious.

This division was a special entity even back during Buddha Dao Lord’s era. It was added into the holy ground’s territory but still remained neutral and didn’t join Buddhism.

Some other inhabitants and races also refrained from joining Buddhism. Alas, they were still affected by it, more or less. This wasn’t the case for Mortal King.

Moreover, this division had no interest in ruling the holy ground either despite being quite formidable.

They always remained nonchalant regardless of whatever happened in the holy ground, akin to the water in a well.

Thus, the five divisions in the plateau had different reactions to the changes in Myriad Beast Mountains.

The nobles and powerful cultivators from Divine Ghost and Buddha Emperor rushed towards the mountain range for an adventure.

The students from Duality took note of this and became agitated. The stronger ones also wanted to go there and train.

The academy finally relented and allowed them to do so. However, it did note that they were responsible for their own lives.

“Yes, we’re coming!” The spirited students heard the approval from the academy and immediately formed groups.

They jumped on their mounts and rushed towards Myriad Beast.

“You all, follow me. We’ll train there.” A teacher thought that this was a good opportunity and picked his favorite students for a trip.

In just a short time, the desolate mountain range had numerous visitors. They caused the place to be chaotic and loud.

The ones who stood out the most were naturally the students from Duality. The nobles from the capital and the experts from Divine Ghost needed to act properly due to their status. Thus, they kept it low-key.

This wasn’t the case for the students. They were young and vigorous on top of having permission from the academy. They rushed there with loud fanfare for the sake of training.

Numerous groups flew straight into Myriad Beast Mountains. Even their mounts were excited and caused loud rumbles and quakes.

They looked like feral children who didn’t have any education and did whatever they wanted here.

“Watch me!” One student saw a pack of earth wolves. His group consisting of eight students immediately surrounded the pack and started killing them. The wolves roared and tried to flee.

These beasts were only at the intermediate yellow level, not worth that much. It’s just that these students were eager to have some fun and didn’t care at all.

“Hey, look over there, so many ghost vines, let’s get them.” Another saw alchemy ingredients growing beneath a cliff. A dozen or so students rushed there right away.

These groups were clearly here to have fun.

Of course, a few prideful students with a prestigious background didn’t hang with this loud crowd. They only took a quick glance around before delving deeper into the mountain range.

Some of them weren’t here for treasures and chaos primal beasts. They were only curious and came to sightseeing or to train. This particular group normally had a noble upbringing.

In the sky, a group of five flew by and landed on a tree. They wanted to have a better look at the scenery.

“Raa!” They saw a massive ox crazily running, crushing the peaks and rivers.

“That one is strong.” A female student in this group was surprised.

“Rumble!” Behind this great ox were another thousand of its ilks. Their rampage flattened everything along the way in an unstoppable manner.

“Those are barbaric bulls on the move, don’t get too close. They will all attack us if we anger the ox king.” An older student warned.

“So how strong is that king?” The female student asked since this was her first time seeing one.

“Junior Sister Ling, it’s stronger than Teacher Qi.” The older one smiled.

The female student stuck out her tongue in a cute manner and didn’t dare to get close.
