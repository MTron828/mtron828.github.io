Chapter 4870: Monochromatic Master’s Loyalty

Undercurrents ran strong in Eight-stallion Dynasty at this point with armies and legions mobilizing. Disciples and experts discussed their future plans.

Not all members were groomed by Eight-stallion Dao Lord. In fact, many villains were also recruited since this couldn’t be helped in Chaos.

Demoness and Monochromatic Master were prime examples of this. They were famous villains who have committed heinous deeds previously. Alas, they lost to the king and joined the dynasty.

When he was around, they were obedient but now, some even thought about dividing the dynasty among themselves.

A few thought that Venerable Dragon God was going to take over. Although the members knew about the chosen successor, they thought that he was not worthy of the throne.

Even if he was an illegitimate child, his cultivation deemed him inappropriate for the position. The same couldn’t be said about the dragon god. He could rule over both regular disciples and ex-villains.

Moreover, his contribution to the land couldn’t be understated. He matched all the criteria to be the next king - power, position, prestige.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye didn’t give a damn about any of this. He was visiting an extravagant palace and its master came out enthusiastically and held his hand.

“Your Highness, I’ve been eagerly awaiting your arrival, day and night.” Monochromatic Master looked like a servant happy to receive his king: “Please, welcome to my humble abode.”

Firerage was unhappy with the close contact and grabbed his blade again.

“Guard Commander, I will only be drinking tea with His Highness.” Monochromatic laughed: “Plus, this is my palace and it’s Eight-stallion Dynasty, nothing is going to happen. I guarantee his safety because I will lose my head if anything were to happen. Stop worrying.”

Firerage couldn’t answer because this seemed logical.

If Li Qiye were to be killed in Monochromatic Master’s palace, Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God would demand retribution and punishment.

Therefore, while Li Qiye was here, it was in Monochromatic’s best interest to protect him.

“Your Highness, I’ve prepared quite a gift for you, let’s go take a look.” He winked implicatively at Li Qiye.

Li QIye smiled and told Firerage: “Guard Commander, stay by the door.”

“But…” Firerage felt as if he was letting Li Qiye enter the tiger’s den.

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye said.

“Your Highness, your bravery is commendable, no wonder why you’re the chosen successor.” Monochromatic praised before telling Firerage: “Guard Commander, rest assured that nothing will happen to His Highness inside my palace. Not even a hair of his will be harmed under my watch.”

Firerage had no choice but to watch the two of them enter the palace without him.

Of course, he didn’t let down his guard and was ready for any development. His men were ready as well to break in.

Monochromatic’s palace was extravagant with beautiful decorations - artificial mountains and ponds, delicious feasts and gorgeous maids, softly embroidered curtains…

“Come serve our king.” Monochromatic ordered and two gorgeous girls came into the hall.

They were shockingly sexy due to their well-rounded figure. Each flirtatious wink and smile incited the lust in men. Their thin, revealing dress only fanned the flames.

Once Li Qiye sat down, they practically latched onto him, enticing him with their sweet fragrance.

Two more, just as luscious, crouched down and massage his feet. Li Qiye seemed to be enjoying himself as he was fed fruits.

“Your Highness, how is it?” Monochromatic smiled, seemingly pleased to be of use to his master.

“Mmm, not bad.” Li Qiye said.

“Once you become the king, not to mention these maids, all beauties in the world will be yours, whether they be from The People or The Race. You will enjoy the finest things in life, Your Highness.” Monochromatic was glad to see Li Qiye being into this.

“True.” Li Qiye nodded.

Monochromatic pressed on: “Your Highness, I will devote my very being to supporting you. The problem is others don’t feel the same way for they lack my absolute loyalty. They want to eliminate you and take your dynasty. If we let them do as they please, you won’t be able to enjoy the greatest pleasures in life. In fact, they will definitely kill you first.”

“Your concern is reasonable.” Li Qiye rubbed his chin: “It’s just that I’ve only gotten here. How can I tell loyal subjects from treacherous officials?”

“Your Highness, isn’t it obvious that the civic deputy is a loyal subject who will toil endlessly for you?” One of the gorgeous women embracing Li Qiye revealed her sexy voice.

“Civic Deputy is loyal indeed. Even the sun and moon can testify to this.” Li Qiye agreed.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“My courage has no bounds when it comes to fulfilling your ambition, Your Highness.” Monochromatic became emotional and declared.

“It is a blessing to have someone like you around, Civic Deputy.” Li Qiye praised again.

“That is why I’m so worried about the traitorous members of the court who covet your throne.” He said.

“The audacity! Who are they?!” Li Qiye slammed the table.

“Your Highness, please don’t be angry, let Civic Deputy speak.” Another beauty said softly.

“Speak.” Li Qiye still appeared furious.

“Your Highness, I do not wish to slander anyone.” Monochromatic hesitated.

“I will pardon you, now speak.” Li Qiye benevolently said.

Monochromatic looked around and spoke quietly: “Your Highness, who wields the most authority right now in the dynasty?”

“Hmm, I’m not quite sure.” Li Qiye said: “According to Firerage, Venerable Dragon God has the most.”

“Right you are, Your Highness.” Monochromatic clapped and then lowered his voice: “The dragon god’s power exceeds everyone else. Moreover, he has Soaring Stallions as well.”

He paused for a moment before continuing: “Everyone looks up to him. I’ve heard that when you first arrived, many members said that you were not worthy of the throne.”

“Traitorous dogs! How dare they?!” Li Qiye became livid and slammed the table again.

“Please, Your Highness, don’t injure yourself.” One of the beauties rubbed herself against him.

“Regular disciples don’t have the courage to say these things. I’m afraid that they are under order to spread these malicious comments.” Monochromatic suggested.
