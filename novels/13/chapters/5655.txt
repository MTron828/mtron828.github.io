Chapter 5656: A Soldier

“Resolute Conqueror...” A spectator whispered his title.

“He’s here too.” Another whispered.

Resolute, a title that invoked respect and awe. He was one of the strongest conquerors in Celestial Court, standing equal to Light-dragon, Heaven Burial, and Titanic.

Nonetheless, he was different from the three who were destined to be great from birth.

Light-dragon was a supreme genius cultivated by Celestial Court with all of its resources.

Heaven Burial’s talent and comprehension stood out at a young age - a perfect seed for cultivation. Moreover, he was fortunate enough to come across Heaven Burial Dual Wheels, one of the nine heavenly scriptures.

Titanic was not inferior, coming from the imperial clan and being a descendant of Crimson Emperor. Moreover, she was born with a golden spoon - an immortal bone.

Resolute, on the other hand, came from nothing. He started from being a foot soldier of Celestial Court, serving numerous battles and improving after each one.

He participated in Immemorial Epoch, Skysplitter, and Grand Dao, making his mark in each one.

During Immemorial Epoch, he matured and improved through trials of blood and sweat, rising from a foot soldier to being a captain. Next came the rank of commander when he became strong enough to fight dragon lords and ancient gods. The next step took longer than before - proving his dao to become a conqueror.

Once Skysplitter started, he challenged Immortal Emperor Fei Yang and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan, leading his forces masterfully.

His legion always emerged with the least damage. Perhaps this was due to his warfare expertise or his humble origins as a common soldier. He was always a threat to The People, establishing himself as a cornerstone of Celestial Court afterward.

As for Grand Dao, he took the mantle of supreme commander for all legions, leading them to numerous flawless expeditions.

Rumor has it that he was appreciated by the highest existences of Celestial Court - Nether Emperor and Sword Emperor. They even offered him the position of Lord, but he was fond of the army and declined to everyone’s astonishment.

He who came from nothing was respected by both sides. Even emperors and monarchs appreciated his unparalleled success, aware that he was not born gifted nor was he a noble like them.

Members of The People revered him as well. After all, the majority of cultivators came from nothing.

His achievement represented possibilities in their lives - a reflection of their aspirations. If he could do it, they could also persevere and reach the apex.

Currently, he looked like a candle in the wind among the vast expanse. Everyone wondered what he was up to.

“Boom!” He activated his boundless vitality again, empowering his imperial flames.

As an apex conqueror, his power activation still sent people flying despite being ten million miles away.

Stronger cultivators still felt as if they had just been struck in the chest by a boulder, crushing through their bones. Normally, the pressure they could handle was incalculable yet his shockwaves alone inflicted considerable pain.

“Poof!” The imperial flame surged upward, capable of burning heaven and earth.

Unfortunately, the invisible power in the darkness immediately suppressed the flame, reducing it to the minimum.

“Very well!” His eyes narrowed and emitted a chilling light.

Explosions detonated as he stretched out his arms. He flexed and their vibration resulted in strands of light.

“Boom!” An anima tree appeared and released its power into his arms. It stood tall, seemingly wanting to burst the entire expanse open. Its ray strand contained the power of three thousand worlds. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He smashed his arms down on the expanse as if beating a drum. Spectators from a distance felt themselves being reduced to bloody mists. The ground beneath and the sky above were on the verge of crumbling.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” He smashed repeatedly.

The impact caused spatial ripples to pulse outward in the dark expanse. However, he didn’t seem successful in piercing the dark surface.

“What is he trying to do?” Emperors and dao lords became curious during the barrage.

Eventually, something actually came out from the dark surface. The bottom seemed to be a world of darkness and something had just awakened.
