Chapter 5474: Secret Of The Momentum

His appearance shocked all the spectators, causing them to gasp. During Immemorial Epoch War, he stood equal to Crimson Emperor of Celestial Court and Immortal Monarch Yi Ye of Immortal Dao City.

Crimson fell in the battle while the monarch no longer appeared in public. Today, Profound was finally seen again.

“Boom!” At the same time, a primordial light descended - one that could only be seen during the start of time.

The image of Celestial Court manifested into reality, prompting others to kneel on the ground. However, the most frightening aspect was the bright stars rotating around the court while exuding an unrecognizable power.

“What is this affinity?” Others haven’t seen this type of power before.

A monarch became overwhelmed with emotions and shouted: “It’s from a heavenly treasure, he’s borrowing its power!”

Sure enough, this unknown affinity eventually attached itself and blessed Supreme.

“Clank!” True Bones was finally able to display its true power.

A terrible phenomenon emerged behind the sword - skeletons belonging to true dragons, the strongest monarchs, dao ancestors…

The strongest beings of an epoch were robbed of their bones and vitality - all for the sake of creating True Bones.

With the help of an unknown heavenly treasure, Supreme gained the force of an overlord capable of using True Bones to its fullest potential.

While everyone thought Celestial Court was on the verge of descending, a golden river shockingly appeared with the yin and yang separated.

“Activate!” Someone shouted and destroyed the visual phenomenon, revealing a hidden peak.

This was hidden by a supreme method but when the image of the court appeared, the stealth method was at its weakest. The attacker was none other than an Immortal Emperor - a middle-aged man wearing a yellow outfit with a hat, looking like a laborer.

“Immortal Emperor Ming Du!” Everyone was surprised to see him floating in space near the mysterious peak.

Was he not a member of Heaven Alliance? Why did he interfere with Supreme’s summon?

As a senior member of Heaven Alliance, he was tasked with defending it during the war. Otherwise, The People might take advantage of their absence and attack their home.

“Boom!” He destroyed the peak as well, revealing another hidden entity - a giant made from peerless metals.

It slightly resembled the metal giants from Imperial Attendant City but was fundamentally different.

He then tore the giant apart, exposing the dimension inside. It was nothing more than a shell to hide strange effigies within.

No, these were living people lying on circular slabs positioned on top of a dao altar. The entire platform was inscribed with mysterious runes, channeling energy from living beings and using them as batteries for the sake of activating momentum…

The internal hull of the giant had countless dao stones and refined jades - all part of a supreme momentum’s framework.

“So this is the source of the supreme momentum.” An emperor took a deep breath.

Putting the immense resources aside, they used living cultivators as fuel for the momentum.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“They’re ancient emperors and monarchs.” Someone recognized these cultivators stuck in stasis.

“That’s… that’s Qian Dao Heaven Emperor, didn’t all of them die back then?” A Grand Emperor from the Heaven Race recognized the founder of the Qian.

Qian Dao Heaven Emperor was rumored to be the second Grand Emperor after Purewood Divine Emperor. Rumor has it that every top member of the Qian was killed with the exception of Sword Emperor.

“Look over there, Majestic Emperor of the diviners.” A different monarch saw another person and whispered: “He betrayed Celestial Court during Immemorial Epoch War.”

The living batteries included members from both The People and The Race. Their descendants thought that they had fallen during Immemorial Epoch War.

As for Li Qiye, he focused on a woman who was sealed as well. She still looked young and wore a gray dress, nothing more.

Her simplicity was unique in that it made everything else seem superfluous. She was a deadly weapon, devoid of unnecessary components.
