Chapter 4119: Wavesplitter

“No rush, I’ll go when it’s time.” Li Qiye responded.

“I understand.” The old man bowed: “Do you need a guide right now for the island?”

“No, take your leave if there’s nothing else.” Li Qiye said flatly.

“I will leave then, Sir. If you need anything, just give the command and I’ll do everything I can.” The old man didn’t linger around and bowed one more time before leaving.

He didn’t know why Li Qiye was here but one thing was certain - the guy didn’t come with malice or greed. This made him heave a sigh of relief.

It was tough to read Li Qiye’s personality so it was best to just stay away. He had lived long, starting from being a helpless tortoise. Putting his cultivation aside, this was thanks to his awareness and lack of arrogance. He built good relationships everywhere and the island prospered under his rule.

After the old man left, Li Qiye began walking around the island. This was one of the largest islands so regardless of the direction he was looking at, he still saw rolling mountains as if this was a continent.

He continued his steps in harmony with heaven and earth. An apex existence here would be able to notice the clues from his movement. They would shudder in horror because Li Qiye gave the impression of disappearing despite being physically there. He was becoming one with the world.

The stars have moved and the land has changed. Both this island and the entire lake didn’t use to be like this.

In the past, this region was protected by a supreme power. Alas, the great calamity broke the balance and changed what used to be unchangeable.

Nonetheless, the region’s foundation and core remained so Li Qiye kept on measuring and calculating them.

“It’s better to live a borrowed life than die a good death.” Li Qiye sighed while walking: “Old man, it’s still too early for you to die.”

His stroll lasted a while before he made it to a gulf with surrounding hills and a beautiful reef. The current was rather strong so few people came here.

There was one exception. He heard the clank of a saber and saw saber energies slashing in the air.

He stopped and watched this youth leaping upward with fluttering long hair. The youth’s saber was majestically radiant.

As he roared, he unleashed slashes splitting apart the water deep enough to see the reef at the bottom. He repeated this process as part of his training.

After another slash, the energy suddenly dissipated and he disappeared from sight. In the next moment, he appeared in front of Li Qiye, pointing his blade straight at Li Qiye’s neck.

He wore a cloak that didn’t hide his bulging muscles. He exuded ferocity and raw power. His eyes were stern with a tinge of melancholy within them.

“Who are you? How dare you try to steal my Wavesplitter Saber Art?” He uttered coldly.

“People are free to travel wherever they want, just as you are free to train here in public.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

The youth realized that this was indeed the case. He scowled and pulled his blade back, wanting to leave.

“Decent saber skill.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “I actually have a spot for a follower, do you want it?”

“Do you know who I am?” The youth stopped and turned around.

“Don’t know and don’t need to know.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Everything has an innate value and a price. Name the price and you will find that money isn’t a problem for me.”

“You’re that guy, Li Qiye!” The youth’s eyes narrowed.

“Indeed, so anything will only be a small sum for me.” Li Qiye said.

“Hmph, don’t think you’re all that just because of dirty money.” The youth didn’t like Li Qiye’s pompous attitude: “It can’t buy my Wavesplitter Art! I don’t want your dirty money.”

Others would be startled after hearing his title since he was one of the Four Weapon Heroes, Wavesplitter Young Lord. The others were Eight-armed Prince, Liu Yushang, and Illusory Princess.

“It’s because no one has given you a sky-high price before. They simply didn’t have enough money.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Clank!” Wavesplitter unsheathed his saber and pointed it at Li Qiye’s neck again with murderous intent.

“Tell me, do you think your money can buy your life right now? I just need one slash to send you to the other side.” He threatened.

“Yes, I just need one word to let your head roll on the ground. Do you wish to try?” Li Qiye calmly said.

Wavesplitter scouted the area but didn’t notice anything. There was no one else around.

“Just try and you’ll see that not only is my dirty money capable of killing you, it can also reduce your clan to ashes as well.” Li Qiye added.

“Are you threatening me!?” Wavesplitter’s murderous intent soared.

“No, I’m merely telling the truth, you’re not worthy of a threat. I can easily pay enough experts to end your clan.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Wavesplitter wasn’t stupid. He knew that Li Qiye was indeed telling the truth. A monstrous sum could invite enough experts to destroy his clan. No one could resist the right reward.

In fact, even the behemoths like Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel Citadel would join in. They would be able to take his clan’s wealth afterward as well. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You won’t live to see that day. I just need to thrust my blade forward and end you first.” Wavesplitter’s expression kept on changing until he made up his mind.

“I’ll stand still, you win if you can kill me. However, I can’t guarantee that you won’t die in the process.” Li Qiye smiled.

Wavesplitter waved, unable to tell if Li Qiye was bluffing. He thought that this was rather likely but the guy could have a powerful protector in the shadow as well. It would be idiotic for the richest man in the world to travel without bodyguards.

Alas, he had scanned the area earlier without noticing anyone. This meant that whoever was in hiding would be far more powerful than him.

“Hmph.” He decided to pull his saber back and said: “I don’t desire your wealth, richest man.”

“Then what do you desire?” Li Qiye asked.

“What I want is… Ninth’s head!” He coldly declared.
