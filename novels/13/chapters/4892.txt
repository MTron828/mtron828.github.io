Chapter 4893: Incinerated

Fire Ape’s flame was weaker compared to Flame-eater Child’s version. Nonetheless, mountains and buildings nearby started burning as well.

“Extinguish them!” The dynasty members had to prevent the total destruction of the capital.

Alas, some of them who were touched by the flames were reduced to ashes.

The beam’s target was still Li Qiye. Everything beneath its path turned into lava. A black hole was eventually formed since time and space couldn’t tolerate this temperature either.

“Watch out!” Firerage and A’zhui shouted at Li Qiye.

Alas, no one could save him, not even Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God since they were busy themselves.

He looked at ease while raising the tongs holding the charcoal forward. A miracle occurred - the fiery beam was sucked into the charcoal.

The latter resembled the bloody jaws of a great monster, capable of devouring all the Maddened Flame. Next, it also absorbed the flames ravaging Eight-stallion Dynasty. This only served to make it a bit redder.

“What the hell is this thing?!” Fire Ape yelled in astonishment.

“Patrimony Fire.” Li Qiye smiled and pointed the tongs at Fire Ape.

Before the demon could react, the charcoal has somehow reached his forehead.

“Ahh!” No one saw how Li Qiye did it but he branded the demon’s forehead, prompting him to scream in agony. Others could hear him from a thousand miles away.

“Zzz…” Smoke oozed out of the mark while he continued to scream. It eventually pierced a whole straight through and destroyed his true fate and sacred fruit.

“Bam!” His huge frame fell backward to the ground. His eyes were wide open and filled with torment. The last agonizing seconds of having his true fate burned to a crisp were unbearable.

This left the crowd frozen. No one knew what the hell this charcoal was. It first killed Toad King and now, Fire Ape. They couldn’t stop this slightly heated charcoal from ending them despite their impressive cultivation.

“Sigh, always fighting, when will this end?” Li Qiye sighed and blew on the charcoal, releasing some fiery sparks again.

“Fuck!” Mad Pyromancer saw the sparks and swung his torch instantly, releasing another inferno to form an unbreakable domain.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Unfortunately, the domain didn’t save him from being touched by the sparks.

“Nooo!” As a fire genius, he knew that this was bad news. His body instantly became engulfed in flames.

He tried to suppress this through various methods but it didn’t work.

“Ahh!” It only took a few seconds before only ashes were left of him.

Firerage, the imperial guards, and other officials stood there in a daze. Three members of the Ten Monsters were killed just like that.

“Do you understand your bloodline’s mysteries?” Li Qiye, who was unaffected by the killing, turned toward A’zhui and asked with a smile.

She didn’t answer because she was still lost.

“Have a taste of having your ancestral blood lit ablaze.” Li Qiye used the tongs to touch her with the charcoal.

She couldn’t react in time before feeling as if her body was melting away due to a fusion reaction with the charcoal.

She let out a blood-curdling screech after feeling a level of pain too harsh to be put into words. Every inch of her flesh was roasting. Normally, this excruciating process would knock someone out or kill them in no time at all.

Alas, she remained alive and fully conscious. Her veins and meridians started burning as well, causing her to twist in agony while screaming.

“Princess!” Firerage ran over but Li Qiye stopped him while shaking his head.

“Boom!” The power of a dao lord suddenly erupted as if Eight-stallion Dao Lord was still here channeling his might. This carried the mark of Heaven Authority. Six dao halos rushed upward and crushed the stars.

Her bloodline blossomed in a magnificent manner, turning her into a being similar to her father. Everyone in the lower three continents became alarmed.

“What an incredible method, Eight-stallion couldn’t pull this off.” Uncle Xiang was astounded after looking at the sky.

“Eight-stallion is returning to life?!” The other dao lords and dragon lords became startled and gazed in the direction of the dynasty.

“Boom!” The halos rotated around her but couldn’t stop the flames from invading her.

“Ahh!” She opened her eyes and shot out two fiery beams, incinerating the sky itself and all high peaks along the way.

“What the hell?!” Wild Dragon saw the beams flying straight for him and his floating dynasty.

It instantly pierced through him and the mountain, leaving two large holes.

“Ahhh! Go!” He bellowed before leaping into the air.

“Rumble!” All of Chaos shook violently.

Meanwhile, inside the Ten Mountains of Demon, a divine tablet floated up into the air.

Chaos suddenly turned dark as a figure of a serpent appeared above. It coiled around Wild Dragon and teleported him away.

“Serpent God Tablet!” Many big shots recognized it right away.
