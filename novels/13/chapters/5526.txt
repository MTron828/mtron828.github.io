Chapter 5527: Cute

Back in Sunset Glow Peak, members of the sect stared at the narrow valley with bated breath, awaiting Li Qiye’s return.

The goddess and Qin Baifeng watched attentively while becoming increasingly anxious. He had been in there for too long so they worried about his safety.

The truth was that they knew nothing about the situation inside since the immortal artifact was outside of their reach after the era of Cloudsweep Fairy. Li Qiye could learn the mysteries of the artifact or disappear forever in the valley.

However, they eventually saw a pulsing figure in the valley, seemingly floating closer.

“It’s him, he’s leaving!” Everyone became excited and shouted.

Sure enough, Li Qiye eventually showed up at the entrance.

“Finally…” They heaved a sigh of relief after seeing him.

He rode a white cloud, looking comfortable and inviting for the best nap possible.

“Are you alright?” Sunset Glow Goddess rushed over and was awfully excited, going as far as giving him a hug. The anxiety that had haunted her dissipated so she was nearly moved to tears.

“Of course.” Li Qiye playfully flicked her forehead.

“Are you going to stay here now?” She turned red and asked with a hopeful smile.

Alas, he only smiled in response.

“I see, I understand.” She understood his answer and nodded slightly.

However, her optimism returned as she looked straight at him and asked: “How many days will you say?”

He only smiled again.

“Kiss, kiss, kiss!” The disciples nearby started chanting, causing her to blush.

Li Qiye chuckled and kissed her forehead before speaking: “Silly girl, you don’t understand.”

Having said that, he raised his hand to summon an immortal ray out of the valley. He touched her forehead and it immediately entered her mind.

“Buzz.” Time came to a halt and everyone’s expression and movement became frozen. The flow of time could travel chaotically from this point but once the buzz was no longer around, everything became normal again.

They stopped shouting after seeing the light shining on her forehead and observed quietly. There seemed to be something different about her but they couldn’t put it into words. She looked as if she was no longer stained by the mortal coil.

“The world is worth cherishing, venture out and enjoy it before returning, hopefully still with a childish innocence.” He whispered.

“A childish innocence…” She murmured.

Spectators didn’t hear their conversation and thought that the romance was flourishing.

“Sigh, where did they run off to?” Meanwhile, Niu Fen has been running around, unable to find Li Qiye’s whereabouts.

“We’re right here.” Li Qiye appeared behind him and casually spoke. The white cloud was with him as well.

“You’re back, Young Noble.’ Niu Fen smiled before frowning and glaring at the cloud: “Brat, how dare you, I should really teach you a lesson.”

The cloud didn’t seem to understand. Its expression resembled a child with widening eyes of curiosity and innocence - truly adorable and cute.

“What are you looking at, never seen someone this awesome before? Maybe I should throw you into a mud pit and stomp a few times.” Niu Fen said.

The cloud didn’t seem to recognize his anger.

“That’s it, you’re about to get it.” Niu Fen rolled up his sleeves.

The cloud still looked as cute as before.

“Fine, I give up.” Niu Fen had no choice but to surrender: “Forget it, I am the greatest dao lord in history, as magnanimous as can be.”

The cloud stared at him in confusion, shifting back and forth between Niu Fen and Li Qiye.

“You don’t understand? Let me tell you about my tales and how unbeatable I am. Back then, when I showed up on the battlefield, other emperors and monarchs immediately stood to the side. I just raised my hand and they all trembled in horror.” Niu Fen boasted.

The cloud nodded repeatedly this time, seemingly understanding him.

“See, now you’re smart and cute, so easy to teach.” Niu Fen patted the cloud and said: “Wait until I’m in a good mood, I will teach you an incredible technique so that you can do whatever you want. Well, not that this is necessary since you can just say my name, and no one will dare to bother you.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I can’t listen anymore.” Li Qiye who was sitting on the cloud shook his head and said: “Your eighteen solutions are just child’s play to it.”

“Really?” Niu Fen was skeptical.

“Then go ahead and teach it, you’ll learn soon enough.” He smiled.

“Haha, I see. Did you hear that? I’ll teach you when I feel like it, it’ll benefit you for a lifetime.” Niu Fen patted the cloud again.

The cloud nodded again.

“Young Master, where did this little guy come from?” Niu Fen was just messing around earlier since he was bored. After all, he had the knowledge and insight of a top dao lord.

“From a place where it should come from.” He smiled.

“Might as well not answer.” Niu Fen complained.

He patted Niu Fen’s shell and said: “It’s a rare opportunity, talk to it more, teach it a few things.”

“I’ll keep that in mind.” Niu Fen said, aware that this cloud might actually be above his level. Nonetheless, Li Qiye must have a reason for telling the two to interact more.

“Where are we going now, Young Master?” Niu Fen asked.

“Another battlefield for purification.” Li Qiye looked around and said.

“Got it, to dao city then.” Niu Fen laughed and sprinted forward.
