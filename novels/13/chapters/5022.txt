Chapter 5023: Justification?

The tablet didn’t give much time for learning and gradually descended until it was no longer visible. The visual phenomena also dispersed into nothingness.

Nonetheless, most cultivators and demons were still overwhelmed - this was their first time experiencing this fortune.

At the same time, Li Qiye was now holding a single god source. It exuded divine rays of a gentle nature, permeating into everyone’s heart and dao without disturbing them.

This meant that just by keeping the god source around, there was no need to train. The god source’s gentle power would always improve the owner’s grand dao. This lucky cultivator could sleep the entire day and would still grow stronger.

This was especially true for those from Demon. With the help of the god source, they could wake up from hibernation one day and find themselves to be the strongest demon monarch.

“So this is the effect of the complete god source.” Tendril King sighed, aware that this was not meant for her.

Her fragmented piece also possessed this gentle affinity. Alas, it couldn’t permeate and seep into her grand dao for improvement.

Others couldn’t help but gasp after seeing this god source. One demon monarch whispered: “No wonder why possessing a complete god source can turn one into a commanding god.”

The owner didn’t need to be worshipped or accepted by other demons. There was unlimited growth just by keeping the god source around.

Everyone desired this perfect artifact. Putting the cultivation boost aside, there was a chance of entering the divine nest as well. The fortunes there were peerless, to say the least.

For example, just the divine egg taken by the War Monarch was impressive enough. It meant being able to groom a divine beast later on.

As the saying goes - flaunting wealth is a crime, and Li Qiye was a serious offender right now.

“What? You all want this?” Li Qiye slowly put it away.

Many salivated but were afraid of his power.

“Brat, what do you want? I am willing to trade anything.” Wild Dragon shouted. As a demon from this region, he desired the god source more than anyone else.

“Do you want it that badly?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I will obtain whatever it is that you want in exchange for the god source.” Wild Dragon laughed. He had a connection with the divine nest as well. His chance of success after entering was higher than the other dragon lords.

In fact, he thought that he could become more than a founder god. His goal was to become a second Demon Conqueror - the greatest of all demons.

“I don’t ask for much, just your head.” Li Qiye smiled.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Wild Dragon’s expression soured after hearing the joke.

“Hmph, you are nothing more than a ruthless killer.” Swordgrasp Venerable said: “An unvirtuous person such as yourself has no right to possess this god source.”

Of course, listeners could tell that he was bullshitting. Treasures belonged to the strong, not the virtuous.

Moreover, what was this about being a ruthless killer? All of them here were ruthless cultivators whose hands were stained with blood.

This was especially true for the dragon lords. Some of these imperious cultivators had massacred sects before.

“That’s right, give it to someone who is more deserving!” Nonetheless, they still shouted since this was an acceptable excuse.

Despite their aggressive tone, no one wanted to actually attack Li Qiye. After all, this would be suicidal. The only thing they could do was wait for a potential opening.

“Come get it then.” Li Qiye smiled and waited.

The shouting continued, not much else.

“Sigh, idiotic and cowardly.” Li Qiye shrugged and said: “It’s understandable to covet treasures, this is just human nature. The problem is being so afraid despite being cultivators. I suggest you all go pretend to be turtles and hide in your caves instead.”

As he spoke, he stared at the dragon lords.

They were naturally furious at the contemptuous insult.

“Li, I dare you to say that again!” Jun Cuican shouted.

“What else is there to say? If you want the god source, come and get it. There is no need for justification when robbing happens on a daily basis in the cultivation world. Act like men for once.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hahaha, so be it, I will rob you today then.” Jun Cuican was young and impetuous, being the first to step forward.

“Ruthless killer, I shall partake in ridding the world of evil.” Swordgrasp Venerable stepped forward and said: “It is our duty to carry out justice in heaven’s stead.”
