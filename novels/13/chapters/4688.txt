Chapter 4689: One Toss

The comment sparked rumination among the crowd since they have seen Li Qiye in action previously and unanimously thought that he was comparable to the five conquerors.

Just a while ago when Five-sun King confronted him, there was no clear favorite in that duel. Therefore, they thought that Wild Paragon was being careless with this claim.

Li Qiye was no longer the nameless junior he once was; his fame was now justified.

“Paragon, you are capable of lifting the sky with your six hands and won’t have any problem slaying Li Qiye.” Someone took advantage of this to flatter him: “Your grand dao is finished so you are unbeatable. His methods, albeit wondrous, are no match for you.”

“Yes, who can stop you when you use all six treasures?” A different youth flattered.

Some cultivators nearby frowned after hearing this. Though everyone wanted to please the paragon, lying like that was rather nauseating since they didn’t actually think he could kill Li Qiye.

Wild himself knew that these were mere flatteries but he still enjoyed them.

“Don’t let me see him or I’ll make him the first paved stone.” He confidently said.

His cocky attitude made the crowd actually want to see a fight between them, to see if he could back it up.

“You’ll be triumphant for sure.” Another sycophant didn’t find this embarrassing at all.

“Young Noble, someone wishes to challenge you.” Meanwhile, Jian Ming was paying special attention to their conversation and became irate.

Li Qiye chuckled and bent down to pick up a stone then casually threw it forward.

“Boom!” The spatial fabrics suddenly trembled after an explosion in the sky.

Everyone looked up and saw a meteor falling down with an apocalyptic momentum. A long fiery trail could be seen as the air was burning.

Despite Li Qiye’s playful toss, the stone still had immense power and appeared to be a meteor.

Those near Wild Paragon were sure that everything within a thousand miles was going to be obliterated by the impact.

“Back off!” They hurriedly leaped backward and flew away.

“Hmph!” Wild Paragon remained calm and waved his banner, blowing away winds and clouds due to the gales. Dao laws then poured down like waterfalls and blocked the path of the meteor.

“Boom!” The disastrous meteor broke down before the banner despite its incredible momentum. The power of the banner was rather impressive, creating a barrier as tough as an unbreakable mountain.

“Nice!” Spectators cheered instantly because Wild Paragon only needed to wave once to stop a meteor, fully displaying his might.

They thought that given his age and talent, he might actually become a second Dao Sanqian.

However, they didn’t notice a tiny pebble still flying toward him after the crumbling of the meteor.

Wild Paragon, on the other hand, became startled. He reacted quickly and channeled his energy for defensive purposes.

“Pop!” Nonetheless, the pebble struck him in the face with the force of a merciless slap. He spat out blood and a scar was left on his cheek.

The loud supporters immediately stopped cheering and stared at him in astonishment.

Wild Paragon was livid. He had just proven his dao and became a Myriad Sovereign. He thought that even ancestors couldn’t take him, let alone other geniuses.

Now, someone had publicly humiliated him during this glorious moment. This was impossible to endure.

“Coward, where are you?! Come out and accept death!” He roared thunderously and nearly ruptured listeners’ eardrums, causing them to bellow in pain.

The rage of a Myriad Sovereign was rather serious. He alone could take down a regular sect. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His three heads looked around while his eyes pulsed intimidatingly. He resembled a furious god looking for offenders.

“So this is a Myriad Sovereign.” The ancestors yet to reach this level paled in comparison.

“Come out!!” He roared again and released a tsunami of aura.

The crowd became intimidated right away and understood why he was livid. Though the wound was not serious at all, it dealt a considerable blow to his pride and prestige. He needed to kill the offender in order to rid himself of frustration.

“You said you wanted to kill me?” Li Qiye’s leisure voice could be heard on top of a peak nearby.

“Li Qiye!” Everyone knew Li Qiye at this point since he was considered equal to the conquerors.

All eyes were on Wild Paragon due to his strong words earlier. He talked about killing Li Qiye. Now, would he actually attempt to do so?

“Boom!” His six eyes turned cold as he released his energy. He immediately leaped toward Li Qiye.

Each step left behind a clear print in the sky and caused the region to quake. His pace brimmed with power. Everyone felt as if he was stepping on their chest, rendering breathing difficult.
