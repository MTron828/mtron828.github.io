Chapter 5375: Can She Do It?

Therefore, which legacy was more impressive between Genesis and Light-dragon Conqueror?

.

“They have to fight, the winner will have the better legacy.” An ancestor said.

Of course, they were no longer on the upper continents so even if there was a fight, none here would know about it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“In my opinion, Genesis Conqueror has the better legacy.” A conqueror commented: “Yes, obtaining twelve dao fruits at once is nothing short of extraordinary, no, monumental. But, Using just one dao fruit to reach anima without the fruit being primordial in nature? That’s truly unprecedented.”

“Either way, we’re witnessing history.” A dragon lord responded.

Normally, conquerors and dao lords obtained one fruit at a time; some faster than others. A few could get all twelve in a short time, ranging from decades to several thousand years.

The slowest was Immensity Conqueror - a genius who obtained the first fruit at a young age. Everyone thought that he would be able to obtain another eleven in a matter of decades.

However, his second never came. His children and descendants started surpassing him afterward. One hundred thousand years later, he finished eleven in one go and proved his worth.

Obtaining eleven fruits required an accumulation of one hundred thousand years. From that, one could see how hard it would be to duplicate Light-dragon Conqueror’s feat.

“Only a selected few have done this, Demon Conqueror being another.” An ancestor said softly: “If Ye Fantian can do this today, she’ll earn a spot in the historical annals.”

Others nodded in agreement. Although this lacked innovation compared to Light-dragon and Genesis Conqueror, it was still something to behold.

Li Qiye and the others also happened to be nearby. They came over and saw Ye Fantian’s repeated attempt at dao ignition.

“Can she do it?” Xiao Hu was curious and skeptical of her ability due to her failed attempts.

“Yes, she already has a plan, more than just twelve fruits.” Li Qiye commented.

“More?” Ferocity’s eyes widened after hearing this.

“Just watch carefully, it’s about to get interesting.” Li Qiye smiled since he knew what she wanted to do.

“She’ll prove herself to be the best among the Three Tians if she can obtain twelve fruits at once.” Li Xian’er commented. As a conqueror, she knew just how difficult this was.

“Buzz.” Ye Fantian continued to gather an insane amount of chaos true energy. Alas, nothing happened next.

This happened repeatedly and some grew impatient. Someone couldn’t help but say: “Looks like there’s no hope, obtaining twelve fruits is easier said than done. That’s why it’s a historical event each time.”

Nonetheless, some top dragon lords and conquerors still watched attentively.

“Putting the historical significance aside, Divine Alliance might have another apex conqueror.” A member of The People worried.

With twelve dao fruits, she might be able to have an immortal shell and anima in just a short time. It would break the balance between the alliances.

Those from the side of The People didn’t wish to see this happen and viewed her as a potential threat.

Some of them exchanged glances, wondering if they should stop her session here and now. This was similar to when Deity Dao ambushed Luminous Conqueror; it might be their best time to deal with her.

“I wonder if The People will try to kill her now. I would.” Ferocity told the group.

“If they have to rely on such a method, they won’t be able to truly rise. Cultivation, for all of its laws, is straightforward and noble.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Why not just kill the enemy when the circumstances permit? Sure, it’s despicable but both sides have done it before.”

“Right.” Li Xian’er knew about the historical precedents.

“We’ll see how many people are feeling suicidal then.” Li Qiye smirked while watching.

“Buzz.” Eventually, something finally changed with the ignition.

“Boom!” The next wave of chaos true energy erupted into a golden inferno and incinerated the sky.
