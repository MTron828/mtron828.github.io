Chapter 3520: Ultimate Attacks

On the surface, one side seemed to have the absolute advantage given their forces consisting of great armies and five ancient ancestors.

Alas, no one was sure of anything. Only Li Qiye seemed to be at peace, still as relaxed as ever. His attitude further intimidated both his foes and the crowd.

Normally, someone like him would have an oppressive aura right now. The strange absence added to the suspense. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s go!” Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign roared.

Sword energy erupted around him in a deafening manner, culminating in a draconic sword dao. It tore apart the sky vault; there seemed to be a million swords sweeping through and extinguishing the stars.

He was exerting his peak state, looking invincible as he raised his sword. The swords of others resonated as well, affected by his sword dao.

“Die!” The sword dao in the sky followed his command and rushed straight towards Li Qiye. they circled around him; a section twirled together and formed a gigantic sword, wanting to pierce through him before being stopped.

The rotation intensified and immediately crushed the ground underneath, leaving behind a crater.

“Rumble!” The speed reached the point where the swords turned into a fiery maelstrom, ready to refine everything near Li Qiye.

The crowd shuddered in horror after seeing the total annihilation of the area but it was only the beginning. Another section of the swords formed a massive grinder with numerous teeth. Even a star would be reduced to nothingness.

Thus, Li Qiye suffered a multi-pronged attack by both the maelstrom and the grinder. Only blood bubbles would be left of him if he were to be caught.

“Boom!” Li Qiye raised his hand to control the devil truncheon. It swung across the air, crushing numerous swords along the path.

“Clank! Clank!” If this kept on, the grinder would have no teeth left, only broken bits.

“Raaa!” While Li Qiye was assaulting the grinder, the dragon king spewed out a torrent of draconic flame straight at him.

This flame was formless but still possessed immense power. Space and time melted in its wake, as fragile as glass.

Li Qiye retaliated with a hand wave, creating another divine wall to separate the worlds.

“Boom!” The flame slammed into the wall, fully stopped. Nonetheless, it raged on and continued to burn the wall with its extreme temperature. The outer layer of the wall began to melt.

“Break!” Golden Sun Ancient Ancestor took advantage of this. His sun poured down an endless stream of sunlight containing needle-like rays. They also had an extraordinary temperature capable of burning down everything.

“Zzz...” Thousands and thousands of holes appeared on the wall as a result.

The crowd took a deep breath. Not to mention one person, even a sect would be destroyed before these three ancestors.

“Boom!” The wall finally crumbled with the addition of the sun rays.

The draconic flame and the sun rays rushed towards Li Qiye in an apocalyptic and all-devouring manner.

“Go!” Li Qiye roared and his two separate grand dao - one evil and the other divine - appeared before him to stop the incoming attacks.

“Boom!” A deafening explosion caused a tsunami to ravage the nearby ocean. The gods and the devil successfully stopped the attacks.

“My turn!” Silver Moon Ancient Ancestor joined the fray at this exact moment. His palms contained the power of the moon as he turned into a lunar god.

The rays poured down with a texture resembling liquid mercury. The targets were both the gods and the devil, completely drowning them out.

These entities had a silver layer completely covering them, similar to armors. Of course, this wasn’t for protection. The layer instantly froze and weakened them.

“Break!” Star Ancient Ancestor didn’t waste time and roared, gathering cosmic lights to form an immortal sword.

The cosmic sword could sever the six dao and the reincarnation cycle. Since the devil and the gods were weakened by the lunar shackles, they shattered instantly before this sword.

“Boom!” This gave ground for the draconic flame and solar rays to swallow Li Qiye.

At the same time, the cosmic immortal sword also struck the devil truncheon. “Clank!” The truncheon was blown flying with sparks scattering everywhere.

The explosion shook everyone to the core as Li Qiye was swallowed by multiple attacks - the draconic flame, lunar and solar lights, and the sword grinder. The latter started closing around him with insane speed and the grinding process began.

“Watch it!” Some couldn’t help blurting out after seeing the shocking destruction around Li Qiye.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t stop it and was trapped within the grinder.

“I think this is finally the end.” Many experts became emotional.

All the spectators thought that this fight was brilliant and colorful. Being able to watch it was truly a fortune.

Five ancient ancestors went all out and displayed their might. Most weren’t lucky enough to see this.

“Is he dead?” Someone murmured while looking at the various powers surrounding Li Qiye.
