Qingniu readied himself and stood proudly, still as confident as ever: “We’ll save someone from death, do you dare?”

All eyes were on Li Qiye now. Everyone was familiar with Qingniu’s medical abilities, capable of bringing people back from the brink of death. Few in the entire system could match him, let alone the young generation.

“Why not? You go first so that you can at least have the chance to do something.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Brother Hu, you can do it, no one else can compare with you when it comes to medicine.” Huang Quanwei showed his support.

The rest didn’t dare to show their attitude because they couldn’t represent their sects and didn’t know which side to pick.

Qingniu took out a frog and let his blade go to work. He cut off its limbs before adding more slashes, leaving it in eight pieces. Next, he chopped it completely on a wooden board.

“I’m starting.” He used his unique medicinal powder on the minced meat.

At the same time, he channeled his true energy into the meat with lightning speed. The pieces started coming back together.

He then used a needle and pierced the wounds with precise movements, just like a master craftsman.

It didn’t take long before he stitched the frog back together. There were still visible wounds and the frog was naturally on the verge of death, it was put back together perfectly.

The next step was from a treasure bottle with a thick liquid. This liquid covered the frog completely while emitting a musky fragrance.

“Let’s go!” He grabbed the frog with both hands and strands of energies entered its body through the veins.

The visible wounds were closing now and the frog skin became as smooth as before.

“Ribbit!” The little guy was feeling as good as ever and instantly jumped around.

“I’m done.” He took a deep breath and stared straight at Li Qiye. He might be inferior in other aspects, but medicine was something he believed to be the best at. It was his pride. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Nice!” The crowd couldn’t help applauding. Regardless of their feelings about him, they must admit that he was an amazing doctor.

“Incredible.” Even Pill King Feng Xiaochen was impressed.

Cultivators were able to create their own body after reaching a certain level as long as the true fate and dao foundation were still around. However, re-creating someone else or saving them from near-death? It required a heaven-defying method and a massive amount of resources - a much harder task.

Qingniu used his skills to save a frog that had been minced completely and restored it in full. It truly showed his matchless abilities.

“Your turn.” Qingniu saw how the Pill King treated Li Qiye earlier, but he remained confident in his art and still looked down at Li Qiye in this regard.

“A bit capable.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Then it’s time for you to show us your abilities. Of course, it’s not too late to accept defeat either, it won’t be shameful at all.” Huang Quanwei laughed.

Li Qiye smirked and flashed into nothingness. In the next second, he appeared again in front of Quanwei and casually said: “Saving a frog is no big deal. Saving a man? That’s real abilities.”

“What, what do you want?!” Quanwei became alarmed.

“Poof!” Before he could calm down, Li Qiye simply touched him. His eyes widened in fear but next, he exploded into a mist of blood.

“Buzz.” His true fate appeared since Li Qiye didn’t destroy him completely.

The scared guy and his true fate tried to run but Li Qiye immediately grabbed it.

“Now, I’ll show you how to raise someone from the dead.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Pop!” His true fate got crushed into articles that eventually scattered around.

Wu Xianyi who was next to him before turned pale and quickly got back.

In the next second, Li Qiye raised his palm. A massive life force appeared like the coming of a new world. It gathered the particles together, gestating it with life.

Before one knows it, a million years seemed to have passed as the particles came together to form Quanwei’s true faith again.

Li Qiye’s grasp shielded all divination and stole the creations of the heaven and earth. Everything was under his control.

“Buzz.” After the true fate came back, his body was being molded again. It didn’t take long before it was entirely finished.

“Bam!” Huang Quanwei fell to the ground, paralyzed while shouting in horror: “You, what the hell did you do to me?!”

The crowd became frozen after watching this unbelievable scene. Even the Pill King was no exception.

“Just mastering life and death.” Li Qiye glanced at the youth and said.

People took a deep breath after hearing this and accepted the gravity of this phrase since they have just witnessed it. Not only did he kill the guy, but he could also give him his life back.

“Young Noble, this exceeds the boundary of medicine, it pertains to the mysteries of life. Even at the very apex, the medicinal dao is only a tiny branch before the profundity of life. The only things greater would be eternal life and life creation. Nevertheless, what you have done so far is beyond our grasp regardless of our effort.” The Pill King emotionally stated.

The crowd didn’t know what to say. If this was still considered a medicinal method, then it would be at the apex of this dao, exceeding everything else - the real form of bringing people back from the dead.

“How is it compared to yours?” Li Qiye chuckled.

Hu Qingniu was as white as paper with beads of sweat running all over. He had nothing to say because this was beyond his comprehension. Like the Pill King said, it was no longer in the category of medicine.

Even if he could cure all illness and save someone near death, what Li Qiye did just now was on a different level. Li Qiye had destroyed a life completely before bringing it back, showing his understanding of the mysteries of life.

“I’ve lost.” He dropped butt-first to the ground, feeling his pride broken to pieces and unable to hold his head high.

“My life is yours.” He said feebly. Li Qiye had broken his life-long confidence and possessed what he yearned to achieve yet will never be able to.

“Scram now.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said.

Qingniu took a long time before looking up, completely indifferent towards life now. He slowly got up and left.

Everyone watched his departing figure and they felt as if he had become much older. The lonely youth then disappeared before everyone.
