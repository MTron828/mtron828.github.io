Chapter 4085: 80,000 Beast Demon Legion

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

In fact, even the members of his legion didn’t expect the king to act in this manner. They came with aggression in mind, ready to flatten the plain.

Plus, the king was also imperious at the start. No one had a clue why he decided to change his mind.

“What is going on?” One expert murmured.

“Yes, what an abrupt change.” A young cultivator became frustrated. Most wanted to see a real battle, not a negotiation.

“It’s about winning without having to fight.” A clan master said.

Others agreed with this notion. The king personally led his legion in order to show the power of his kingdom. This was to let Li Qiye and everyone else know about their destructive potential, that they could unleash retribution upon anyone daring to hurt their members.

Thus, the king’s change in attitude allowed Li Qiye a way to give up after seeing the potential future ahead.

“Starshooter using everything it has to defeat a junior, this type of victory wouldn’t be considered glorious at all.” One ancestor analyzed: “But they have no other choice due to this grand formation, easy for the defense and hard for the invaders. Failing here would ruin their reputation that has taken generations to build, so this is an easier way to deal with the situation.”

Others agreed with him and waited for Li Qiye’s response.

“You’re smart but still not smart enough, unable to grasp the situation. I won’t let go of the hostages because of this. Your best choice is to listen and hand over two-third of your treasury. Otherwise, be ready to smell some roasted meat.” Li Qiye chuckled before answering.

The members of the army were furious since they considered this as arrogance and ignorance - a blatant insult.

“Show some respect!” A general roared.

The king gestured for the generals to stop. Otherwise, they might have rushed into the plain.

“Your demand is unreasonable. No one in the world would agree to this, let alone our prestigious kingdom!” Starshooter King said. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The generals, soldiers, and even the spectators nodded in agreement.

No one would acquiesce to Li Qiye’s demand. Doing so would throw their reputation in Sword Continent away. They wouldn’t be able to look at anyone with their head held high.

“That’s your business.” Li Qiye smiled: “Feel free to refuse, just get ready to smell some roasted meat.”

“Li! Do whatever you want with us but just know that there will be no place for you to go! Sea Emperor will make sure of it!” Hundred-blade Noble roared.

Starshooter King agreed with him and said: “You need to reconsider. You might have the upper hand today but this will not last forever. I’m afraid disasters are coming for you.”

This wasn’t an exaggeration since Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom would join the fray eventually. Hundred-blade Noble’s master was an elder there. The latter would certainly try to avenge him.

This was before taking Armament Mountain into account as well.

“Who cares about the future? I live for today.” Li Qiye laughed: “Everyone dies eventually, whether it be tomorrow or another day. It is inevitable, so I shall enjoy life whilst I can and make it interesting by taking two armies down with me.”

Though the crowd was left speechless by his mentality, they thought that there was a sliver of logic in this. He was trading himself versus all the hostages. That seemed like a great trade.

“Take one step back and everyone wins, especially you.” The king uttered coldly.

“You seem to be misunderstanding something. I have all the cards right now and all you can do is say yes.” Li Qiye said: “Go back from whence you came if the negotiation is over, lest you want to smell some meaty aroma.”

The king’s expression became unsightly. Li Qiye seemed hellbent on keeping this up.

“Brat, don’t ask for a foot when giving an inch or you’re dead!” Another general shouted.

“What are you waiting for if you don’t wish to pay the ransom? Come get them, I don’t mind killing some more.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I have shown all the mercy I can but you chose the gates of hell instead of heaven’s door…” The king glared at him.

“I got it, come, let’s see how long you can last.” Li Qiye interrupted him.

Fury spewed out of the king’s eyes. His legion roared and readied their weapons and shields.

“Boom!” This heated atmosphere was certainly interrupted by the creaking of a heavy gate opening.

“Rumble!” Next came violent quakes and dust storms everywhere.

Everyone saw the legion of Armament Mountain rushing forward with the force of a tsunami. Its momentum assaulted the plain first.

It consisted of various demons - large serpents with a human upper half. Another was a great centipede demon with golden legs, then a tiger king as large as a mountain with fangs as sharp as blades…

“Raa!” They let out intimidating roars while crushing the terrains in their way.

“So many demons, is this Armament Mountain’s legion?” Many experts turned pale.

The Sky Spirit Legion of Starshooter was quite powerful. However, it lacked ferocity in comparison.

“80,000 beast demons, this is a great legion in Armament Mountain. It is under the control of their First Elder.” A high elder from another clan revealed.

Armament Mountain recruited from many races with humans and demons primarily in charge.

This didn’t use to be the case until God Ape Dao Lord. They started recruiting more demons and God Ape Kingdom became a top branch, not inferior to the main branch in the slightest.
