Chapter 5453: Young Master

The name of Celestial Court alone struck fear into The People back in the ancient epoch. However, a different era started after Skysplitter with the rise of Imperial Field and Immortal Dao City.

The duck egg buyer and allies made it all the way to Celestial Court, seizing one victory after another and eventually sealing Celestial Court.

Later on, other conflicts occurred with mixed results. Thus, no one could claim absolute domination, not even Celestial Court.

Today, Supreme’s confidence was met by skepticism and dread. After all, Supreme was far from being the blustering type. Since he had a direct connection to Celestial Court, did he have access to certain information not privy to others?

“I am speaking nothing but the truth. Know that when Celestial Court returns, it will take over the world.” Supreme said.

Other apex cultivators exchanged glances, feeling that there was something amiss regarding Supreme’s confidence.

“Death is the other option.” Immortal Pagoda Conqueror had a tougher stance than Supreme: “We can deliver judgment now.”

To hear Immortal Pagoda say this himself surprised Swordsea and Eternal Conqueror. The atmosphere became increasingly ominous.

Although they were siding with The Race currently, they were not part of Celestial Court. They could kill All-things and the others today but this might not have an absolute effect on the eternal conflict.

Sooner or later, Imperial Field and Immortal Dao City would send help to the upper continents and a reversal remained a possibility. Alas, what was this eternal plan to establish domination from Celestial Court?

Currently, Celestial Court didn’t have control over the immortal continent. The People have risen, becoming a worthy foe.

“You can’t even capture the two continents, let alone all six. Our Dao and Imperial Alliance aren’t the only powers here.” Calamity laughed, acting boisterously but in reality, he wanted to pry more information out of Supreme.

“The outcome is obvious now, struggling is useless. Not a single soul can stop the inevitable, the reign of Celestial Court. I sincerely advise all of you to take me seriously.” Supreme insisted.

“All of you” here included Azure Peak, Pure Land, and any other powers in the upper continents. Listeners naturally understood the implication.

This only made things more confusing. Was he not afraid of these powers interfering and saving the prisoners? His absolute confidence could backfire here and revert the situation.

“No mercy to the dissidents, no exception when the might of the heaven descends.” Immortal Pagoda repeated in a domineering fashion, mirroring his prideful attitude.

“Might of the heaven? Celestial Court thinks too highly of themselves, a bunch of ragpickers think they can represent the high heaven?” A leisurely voice answered instead.

All eyes turned toward the speaker right away. They saw an ordinary man walking in the sky, approaching the battlefield.

“Li Qiye!” He was no stranger to anyone at this point.

“Hahaha!” Calamity burst out in laughter and said: “Our young master is finally here, Celestial Court is done for!”

He kneeled on the ground and shouted: “Young Master, it has been eras since I last paid my respect to you.”

This startled everyone - an apex cultivator was down on his knees?

Jilin Buddhist Emperor immediately rushed over and prostrated before him: “Young Master, how long have I waited for this moment?” Her eyes became slightly moist while she was near him.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Spectators couldn’t believe their own eyes. This time, it was someone stronger than any of the current combatants.

“Attained all eight enlightenments to such a high level, well done.” Li Qiye glanced down and praised her, recognizing her as Jilin Mengying from the Ten Worlds.

“I am a mere firefly in comparison. My achievements are due to your guidance alone, Young Master.” She said.

Principle Conqueror brought his men over as well. He prostrated and said: “My Lord, my descendants and I apologize for the lack of proper reception. Please forgive us.”

He was the one who sold himself to Li Qiye, serving as a servant while keeping his true identity a secret.

Others were shocked to see this with a few exceptions, Li Zhitian included.

“Benefactor, we respectfully welcome you.” Azure Ancestor led the members of Azure Peak over and kneeled as well.
