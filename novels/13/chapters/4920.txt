Chapter 4921: Find The Thief

“Only the heart.” Li Qiye replied.

“Only the heart…” Bai Shaojin echoed in a hushed voice.

"Cultivators often spout nonsense such as 'treasures belong to the virtuous'. In reality, possessing an item doesn't mean one can truly use it. In fact, it can lead to disastrous consequences, even resulting in the destruction of a sect."Li Qiye’s gaze intensified as he continued.

Shaojin had thought of such possibilities before.

“Most importantly, more doesn’t mean better and amusingly enough, stronger isn’t better either. It has to be suitable because being obsessed with an unusable treasure will lead to ruin.” He finished in a thorough manner because the boy was a descendant of an old friend.

Shaojin shuddered as the weight of Li Qiye's words hit him. He bowed deeply to show his respect and understanding of the lesson imparted.

The truth was that his clan had plenty of treasures and heirlooms, enough to compete against anyone. He realized that he didn't need to concern himself with external treasures and merit laws. Once he became strong enough, internal resources would become available to him.

Given his current abilities, possessing top treasures could potentially be his biggest mistake.

Suddenly, their conversation was interrupted by loud noises and knocks coming from outside.

Jian Yunyun frowned and went over to open the door. When she opened it, she saw a group of disciples wearing the same uniform. These disciples were considered elites in any sect.

Her frown deepened as she recognized them as members of the Deity sect, currently studying in Abroad.

“What is it?” She asked.

One of them bowed and said: “Miss Jian, we apologize for the intrusion. We have been verifying fellow students who have just returned.”

“What does that have to do with me?” She said with an annoyed tone.

They have received orders from the seniors to look for Benevolence by checking potential suspects. Immortal Pagoda and Swordgrasp were hellbent on this goal.

Even though they were all students, Jian Yunyun's status far exceeded any of theirs. She had the potential to become the successor of The Alliance and even Primal. These uninvited visitors didn't dare to offend her.

However, they still had to carry out their mission and fulfill their duty, as it was of utmost importance and negligence was unacceptable.

“Nothing, Senior Sister Jian.” An older student was quick-witted and spoke with a smile: “It’s just that we heard you brought a friend home. You know that good and bad people intermingle in Abroad, so we would like your friend to register in order to keep everyone safe.”

He gave a proper and acceptable reason.

“No need.” Yunyun said coldly.

She had both authority and power to back up her words. In the case of an actual fight, it would be hard for them to find students capable of stopping her.

The students exchanged glances after hearing this.

“What is it?” A voice came from the hall.

They looked inside and saw Li Qiye walking out.

“That’s him.” One student raised his voice.

All eyes were on Li Qiye as he walked out of the house. Bai Shaojin had already left from the back entrance under Li Qiye’s command.

Those from Deity were happy to see him. One of the speakers earlier said: “Senior Sister Jian, we only want to register him by asking a few basic questions, there’s no malice involved.”

The disciple turned to Li Qiye and asked politely: "Brother, may I ask where you are from?" He wanted to get the information quickly before Jian Yunyun had a chance to refuse. The task was important, and failure to complete it could result in punishments from the senior members of the sect.

Li Qiye gave a non-committal answer: "I am just a passerby. I am from where I am from."

The group exchanged glances, some becoming visibly annoyed. One of them shouted: "You have some nerve to not take this seriously!"

Members of Deity were proud regardless of their actual origin. The lineage had reigned for a long time, and they took pride in this. Thus, Li Qiye's nonchalant response was viewed as a provocation.

"Who gave you the right to shout before us?" Yunyun's eyes turned aggressive as she unleashed her sovereign aura. It filled the courtyard and left the uninvited students frozen, feeling as if they were being weighed down by an immense pressure akin to the weight of a mountain.

They were taken aback and stumbled backward. Although she was not the top genius of this generation, she was still a Supreme Sovereign. They exchanged glances among themselves, realizing that their position was disadvantageous.

"Miss Yun, please don't be angry. I apologize on their behalf. “Another person stepped forward, exuding a powerful aura that counterbalanced hers.

The members of the Deity sect made way for him and bowed, showing reverence. The youth had a halo behind him, pulsing with an impressive aura that left others in awe and trembling in his presence.

“Halo Scion.” Yunyun frowned slightly after seeing him.

“Miss Yun, call me Huantian, no need to be a stranger.” He looked like a fan of Yunyun. [1]

“I didn’t expect you to support Deity.” She had no intention of returning the sentiment and said coldly.

“Our ancient ancestor is close to Immortal Pagoda, I am here to help a bit.” He replied.

The mention of this ancestor immediately silenced the scene. He was referring to the legendary Skystomper God of Heaven Burial.

"That's your problem, don't be overbearing in my yard. Leave.” She responded firmly.

But Halo Scion had no intention of leaving, his eyes fixed on Li Qiye: "Miss Yun, where is he from?"

"None of your business.” Jian Yunyun's expression grew increasingly unfriendly.
