Chapter 3849: Want To Calculate Me?

The listeners were disappointed to hear the brief response. That’s not the answer they desired. It should have included the words “heavenly genius” or “future dao lord”.

Nonetheless, no one dared to ask him for elaboration. After all, even invincible masters addressed him with honorifics. The ancestors and high elders present were all his juniors, let alone the young generation.

Three Slashes felt the same disappointment. After all, he believed that he had witnessed an incredible sign of auspiciousness. It told him that he would stand at the apex and look down at the world.

To take one step back, the Grand Seer should have at least praised his future sign. That would have been enough to elevate his status.

Thus, Three Slashes bowed again and continued: “Is there anything else you wish to teach us, Senior?”

He fished for a compliment but the Grand Seer turned a deaf ear, seemingly resting.

Three Slashes was both disappointed and unhappy. Alas, there was nothing he could do.

Though he was the prestigious young lord of the Biandu and the future ruler of Black Wood, it was still useless if the Grand Seer didn’t want to give him face.

In reality, the Grand Seer might have the same prestige and influence as Buddha and Righteous Supreme. His lack of cultivation power didn’t matter in this case.

“Sabers are dangerous weapons.” Someone suddenly spoke and interrupted the silence. It was none other than Li Qiye who had a smile on his face.

A scowl appeared on Three Slashes. He already had to restrain himself against Li Qiye prior. Even the Grand Seer slighted him just now so frustration built up.

He clearly saw an auspicious sign but the seer made nothing of it. Now, Li Qiye butted in and ruined his mood. Staying calm proved to be impossible.

“Enough of your drivel!” He finally shouted.

“It’s up to you to believe it or not.” Li Qiye shrugged: “Seer Watch does have some abilities from their ancestral clan, this ceremony is accurate indeed. The image of a descending divine saber means that you’ll die to one. This is an ominous sign, so better watch out now.”

Rage built up inside Three Slashes while listening to Li Qiye’s nonchalant tone. So now, the guy said that he had an ominous reading?

“Such impudence!” Some locals couldn’t stand this.

“His far-fetched reasoning is nothing short of an insult, he deserves death!” One youth furiously bellowed.

“Yes, someone who likes to fan the flames everywhere shouldn’t be allowed in Black Wood Cliff!” Others jeered rowdily.

“Banish him from Black Wood, never let him take a half a step inside again!” Another youth screamed.

“Just a banishment? That’s too easy on him. Insulting the Biandu and its young lord is a crime deserving of death. That’s the only way to appease the public.” Young Lord Tuhuo coldly uttered.

“True, kill him then!” Many experts shouted in agreement.

Li Qiye was only an outsider in their eyes so they would naturally take Three Slashes’ side. Even if the latter didn’t say anything, some would still be willing to kill Li Qiye in order to please him and his clan.

Three Slashes controlled his anger but his expression was no longer friendly. He glared at Li Qiye and said: “Since you know fortune telling, Fellow Daoist, have you read your own?”

“Yes.” Li Qiye smiled: “A boundless longevity.”

“Boundless longevity? The only things boundless are your arrogance and ignorance!” Someone from the last generation sneered.

“Someone needs to teach this egotistical maniac a lesson.” Many were eager to fight to make Three Slashes happy. Or at the very least, they needed to express their stance.

“Fools.” Li Qiye shook his head then said: “Let’s go.” With that, he turned and left.

He didn’t come here for divination at all. His goal was to take a look at this lineage because they were descendants of the Heaven Calculating Clan. He was interested to see how much they have learned.

After seeing the Grand Seer, he got a good idea and didn’t need to stay around any longer.

“What’s the hurry?” Young Lord Tuhuo snorted and walked over.

The other crowd members looked aggressive, seemingly ready to attack Li Qiye the moment Three Slashes gave them a signal.

However, Li Qiye ignored them while Wei Qianqing huffed thunderously. A chilling intent permeated from her, causing the crowd to pull back.

“Young Master, you do not wish to observe the heaven?” The Grand Seer opened his eyes and asked Li Qiye.

“Unnecessary, I already know what the heaven is like.” Li Qiye smiled and kept on walking. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hmph, he’s afraid of seeing his terrible future.” An expert said.

“Yes, running away like a cowardly turtle.” Another chimed in.

The Grand Seer was more anxious than anyone else to see Li Qiye’s departure. He hurriedly said: “Young Master, just take one look.”

He waved his hand and the crystal ball on top of the well flew towards Li Qiye.

He didn’t dare to force Li Qiye to do anything. However, he still wanted to find out more about Li Qiye.

“Buzz.” The moment the crystal ball got close, countless golden beams exploded akin to the eruption of the cosmos.

“What the hell?!” No one could keep their eyes open and started panicking.

“Want to calculate me?” Li Qiye turned his head towards the crystal.

“Boom! Boom!” Lightning bolts rained down along with a massive figure inside the crystal ball.

“Bam!” The crystal ball suddenly shattered. This made the astounded Grand Seer stagger backward, pale.

Once others regained their sight, they saw pieces of the crystal ball scattering downward. Li Qiye was already gone from the peak.

“Did you see that?” Confusion sprang among the crowd.

“What a monstrous visual phenomenon.” A powerful ancestor only got a glimpse and became stricken with fear.

“Even the Grand Seer’s crystal ball couldn’t handle it.” Another ancestor couldn’t see it clearly.

The top masters on the peak were at a loss for words.
