The three behemoths have failed their first attempt to the relief of the crowd. Everyone started back again on square one.

At this point, Wu Zhongtian, Skylight First Prince, and Firmaments Godchild decided whether to team up.

The atmosphere became tense during this discussion. Everyone became worried because these three sects might actually do it. In that case, no other power would get anything from the treasury.

“Hey, I heard there’s a map for the forest circulating.” A map appeared all of a sudden, and not just one either.

In the beginning, some people tried to hide it only to realize that there were a number of them available. Eventually, nearly everyone in the forest got their hand on one.

“There’s a map for this?” Some disappeared at first because their experience let them know the always-transforming nature of this place. A map was useless since it couldn’t change as well.

They quickly found this to not be the case.

“It’s not a regular map, there are clear methods dictating when to enter and the correct steps.” An elder carefully studied it and said.

Several big shots got their hand on one and became startled. There were several methods and routes listed in a meticulous manner. They seemed to be taking into account the changes of the stones.

“This is a type of calculation.” The trio of geniuses became astonished, the same with the ancestors from their sect.

“It’s meticulous, it can account for the changes within a single day and night. Who did this?” An ancestor from Yin Yang murmured.

The source of the map remained unknown. Nonetheless, the ancestors were surprised to see such an accurate calculation. Even Yin Yang Gate didn’t possess a method of this level.

The trio checked their maps and found them identical. The big shots shuddered, wondering about the heaven-defying being capable of understanding the stone forest.

Just how powerful was this person? They became curious and tried to investigate the source. Unfortunately, nothing came of it.

“Let’s go!” Some lost their patience and began entering the forest in order to get to the treasury first.

They rushed to the entrance like a flood. Sure enough, following the map allowed them to get deeper in there.

The three big powers became increasingly amazed at the map’s accuracy. Each step was perfectly calculated.

They saw the magnificent scenes and treasures again. Some saw the golden pagoda on top of the peak, the valley filled with auspicious energy, and the jade deers playing around in the thicket looking just like forest spirits...

This place had plenty of special herbs and trees along with mysterious treasures. The entire place itself could be considered a treasury already. Unfortunately, one could only stare.

Some lost to their greed and tried to reach for the treasures. The scene before them suddenly changed and they were sent back to the entrance. All their effort became wasted.

Others took note of this but they still didn’t give up. They kept on experimenting to find a way to seize the treasures. Only a few succeeded.

For example, an ancestor performed his own calculation on a flower at the base of a peak. Finally, he let caution to the wind and shouted: “Just have to try!”

He used his power to derive the coordinates of the shifted dimensions and performed flawless movements through space.

“Pop!” Sure enough, he got the right coordinates and successfully entered the peak to take the flower.

“An ancestor from Starshifter Gate got a strange flower!” This news spread across the area.

“The treasures here are real, not illusions.” This was confirmed.

“Should we try to?” More and more became eager to try.

Most understood that the imperial treasury was out of reach. It was more realistic going for other treasures.

Alas, reality was cruel. The regular cultivators had no chance in gaining anything. Only the mighty ancestors could barely derive the right sets of coordinates to enter the shifted dimensions.

As for the three top powers, they had zero interest in other treasures. Their goal was deeper into the forest.

The map let them travel freely and it didn’t take long before they reached Fire Domain.

The heat was unbearable even from a distance. They saw a dead land before them.

“Fire Domain.” They instantly knew the area right away.

Fire Domain was well-known even though people haven’t gotten there. The ground was scorched; the peaks and mountains were still there, just incinerated from top to bottom. Mud and soil had a black color. The least-affected places had a yellow shade.

Upon closer inspection, one could still feel indiscernible heatwaves ravaging the place. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, the most catching thing about this place was deeper inside. There seemed to be a torch burning there. Its flame was strong enough to reach the azure, wanting to burn a hole through it.

This flame was insane; the heat waves emanating from it seemed like storms. They took the shape of dragons and burned everything nearby and all intruders.

This was the only flame left in Fire Domain, located in the deepest region. This was perhaps the source of the high temperature found here.

The spectators in the distance became frightened by the draconic heat waves.
