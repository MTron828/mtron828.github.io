Chapter 4538: Pertaining The Legend

“No one knows his identity. A legend states that he is only a strand of soul. Another says that he came from the nether world. Some believe that he is an ancient existence…” Wise Ancestor elaborated.

“How can he live for so long?” Jian Ming inquired.

Wise Ancestor rubbed his chin and then said: “Who knows? The emissary has existed for a long time now. Dead or alive? Unknown. Origin, unknown. It’s a being shrouded in mystery.”

“How interesting.” Jian Ming then thought about the daoist and smiled happily: “Swindler, your renowned clan knows everything, hehe, what about this emissary?”

“We have indeed calculated this topic.” The daoist stared at him and said earnestly.

“Oh? Tell me already.” Jian Ming’s eyes lit up since these were his favorite topics.

“Why should I? Seering is a dangerous art, I can’t just give out this precious information to you.”

“Hey, what the hell are you saying? You have been following us, eating our food, and drinking our water on top of riding our young noble’s coattails. We’ll throw you out right now, wait, no, since we’re nice people, we’ll let you walk away.” Jian Ming accused him.

The daoist glared at him. He was only following Li Qiye, since when did he become a freeloader?

He coughed and tried to play it off: “Very well, I can appreciate your desire to learn so I’ll make an exception. Listen well, how much you learn depends on your own fortune.”

His attitude annoyed Jian Ming, prompting a brief glare. He then brushed it aside and laughed: “Tell me already.”

“The truth is that the emissary is not a person.” The daoist revealed.

“What do you mean? Is he a ghost? I guess that’s not a new thing in this world.” Jian Ming’s eyes lit up.

“Ghosts don’t exist.” Li Qiye smiled and interjected: “There are only resentful spirits and lingering intents. The absence of ghosts is actually a great thing for the world.”

“Really?” Jian Ming became disappointed: “So there are no immortals or ghosts, only people. That’s a little boring.”

“Do you still want to listen?” The daoist glared at him.

“Of course, of course, keep going. Let everyone know how impressive your clan’s divining abilities are.” Jian Ming got closer to the daoist and smirked.

“It’s just you who wants to listen.” The daoist said seriously: “Our ancestor, a great seer, attempted to read the fortune of the emissary. He found that the emissary was neither human nor ghost, a being whose root is far, far older than your clan.”

“Really? But our four clans are rumored to be from the previous epoch.” Jian Ming said.

“He is an even older existence.” The daoist said: “The fortune couldn’t trace all the way back but there were clues. He had deep ties with an ancient emperor.”

“That sounds plausible.” Wise nodded: “I did feel an archaic imperial aura coming from him. It is suppressive even for top cultivators.”

He had witnessed the opening of the crossing before and saw the emissary. This left an unforgettable impression on him.

“Ancestor, are you saying that the emissary is an ancient emperor?” Jian Ming asked.

“I’m not sure but that is a known legend among the upper echelon. It’s rather possible.” Wise shook his head.

“Why would an ancient emperor ferry the dead? Don’t emperors and dao lords ascend to a higher realm?” Jian Ming doubted this legend.

“It doesn’t have to be the emperor’s true body.” The daoist said: “It could just be an avatar or a divine intent or maybe… a previous incarnation.”

“Previous incarnation.” Wise focused on this last part since it gave him a fresh perspective on this matter.

“What is a previous incarnation? Who has something like this?” Jian Ming asked.

“Someone who has lived again.” Li Qiye said.

“!!!” The group became emotional.

Jian Ming calmed down and became excited. He got closer to Li Qiye; his eyes flashing brightly: “Young Noble, you must know the identity of this emissary, hehe. Can you please tell us?”

“A few secrets are beyond your station, not knowing is better for your wellbeing.” Li Qiye replied.

“Oh.” Jian Ming had no choice but to restrain his curiosity, not daring to ask any longer.

“Let’s get going since the opening of the cross is the best chance of meeting Pioneer Ancestor.” Li Qiye said: “Needing to go to the Yang Cemetery will make it more complicated, there are too many graves there.”

The group shuddered, not wanting to enter a place filled with mighty corpses.

“Young Noble.” The daoist had a question: “Is the reincarnation cycle real? The corpses in the Yang Cemetery all want to experience this, right?”

Li Qiye rubbed his chin and said: “The cycle? Yes and no, but true reincarnation isn’t like this.”

“I see.” The daoist ruminated. His clan has done plenty of research on this matter since it pertained to fate and time.

Li Qiye didn’t dwell on this topic and moved onward. The group hurriedly caught up.

***

Yin Yang Crossing was located in both Sky Border and Inner Wild, bordering Desolate Wild.

It consisted of three main areas - Yang Cemetery, Yin Wheel, and Yin Yang Bridge. The first two were always present but the bridge required the opening of the crossing before appearing.

While standing outside, the crossing had a crescent shape. To the left were Desolate Wild and endless mountain ranges. This included the Yang Cemetery.

This area was geographically perilous with peaks and ravines. Top masters would be able to see hazey energies engulfing this place.

The peaks were home to the graves of numerous experts. They came here on the verge of death, hoping to find a grave. They would then lay down in the coffin for years to come, awaiting the crossing in order to enter the Yin Wheel.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
