Chapter 4176: Dragon Palace

One misstep in Sword Grave would result in death for not only the person committing the mistake but all of their juniors and allies.

Some sects have lost their ancestors and didn’t get a divine sword in return. This was an unacceptable loss.

Nonetheless, people still risked it all because when successful, the reward was handsome as well - becoming famous and mighty on a global scale.

“Clank!” A sword flashed brightly in another spot; auspicious signs began to appear as well.

“Something good for once!” Numerous experienced cultivators ran in that direction.

“Someone got an auspicious flying sword, this aura is coming from it.” When they got there, the sword was already gone.

“Who is the lucky guy?” They asked right away.

“A disciple from a small sect, three-hundred-year-old but still just a regular disciple. He got lucky and found a divine sword within the shrine. Its auspicious aura was incredible.” An expert who was there told the crowd.

The guy was smart enough to immediately run and hide after obtaining this sword, not wanting to be robbed.

“How the hell did he get there? Nothing killed him along the way?” Others became skeptical.

After all, strong cultivators have found graves already but fell victims to the various dangers here.

“It’s all about fate.” One sect master sentimentally said: “When fate comes, so does luck. Many divine swords here are willing to follow the fateful ones while others kill whoever provokes them.”

Others agreed with this. Luck and fortune were mysterious forces beyond their control.

“Sigh, why can’t a genius like me be that lucky?” One genius complained: “That guy is so old yet still has no cultivation to speak of. It’s unfair that he got a divine sword.”

Of course, complaints and grievances did nothing to change the divine swords’ mind.

“Boom!” At a different corner, a divine sword rushed to the sky and unleashed numerous slashes for a total onslaught.

However, a net came from above with the power of a dao lord. It fully suppressed the area including the divine sword. People then saw several ancestors working together to seize the sword.

“Armament Mountain!” Others recognized them right away.

“They’re so strong, forcing a sword out and capturing it.” A clan master was startled.

“I heard that their clan master is personally leading the troops this time. They’re well-prepared.” One expert commented.

This also made people think because Armament Mountain didn’t specialize in the sword dao. It was inferior to Sea Emperor and other sword-focused behemoths.

“No one will say no to a divine sword from this area.” Someone speculated: “There’s only one dao lord every million years for a sect but don’t forget about all of its disciples.”

Others agreed because Armament Mountain certainly had a few dao lord weapons. However, this was not enough to share. The more powerful weapon it had, the better.

All in all, the grave was bustling right now. Many have lost their lives but a selected few obtained divine swords and changed their fate.

On the other hand, Li Qiye wasn’t interested in the divine swords. He continued strolling with the princess behind him.

“Is the person you’re wanting to meet here in Sword Grave?” She couldn’t help but ask.

“The inevitability will happen, no rush. Everyone has their own turf, let’s take a look around right now.” Li Qiye smiled.

The princess didn’t quite understand what he was talking about. As the duo was crossing through a thicket, Li Qiye suddenly stopped and stared at a dried tree.

It was rather thick, needing several men to lock hands around it. It seemed to have died long ago; this base was the only thing that was left. It had rotted from the rain and winds, just one push would take it down.

“It’s a good sword.” Li Qiye took his time observing before concluding.

“Hmm?” She didn’t notice a sword here at all but quickly caught up: “This is a sword grave, Young Noble?”

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded and elaborated: “Born from the yin with a darkness affinity, a boundless sword that can blot out the celestials.”

“It’s that impressive?” She knew that only an amazing sword could receive Li Qiye’s praise like this: “Is it suitable for you, Young Noble?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Its dao is not ready, there’s no point in me taking it away.” Li Qiye shook his head and glanced at her: “As for you, it won’t follow you so you can’t have it either.”

Despite being a sword prodigy with ample knowledge, she didn’t think Li Qiye was wrong.

“I lack the fateful connection then.” She accepted reality.

“Your mentality exceeds your peers.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Thank you, Young Noble, the seniors taught me well.” She said.

Compared to others in the young generation, she was not competitive and lacked ego. This, in turn, gave her freedom.

The duo abandoned this divine sword and continued onward.

“Rumble!” A series of explosions shook the sky. Waves of sword energies rampaged the upper region.

Cultivators’ swords started resonating with this phenomenon. A massive palace materialized in the air. It exuded a blinding golden radiance.

The entire thing seemed to be made from gold and jade - a home suitable for a divine king. High walls with dragon carvings surrounded the place.

“Dragon Palace!” Many became excited after seeing the floating architecture.

“Let’s go up there!” They rushed towards it.

“The eighth grave, Dragon Palace.” Snowcloud Princess noticed it as well.
