Chapter 3672: Entering The Treasury

Yang Ling jumped into the hole, as excited as can be.

Once her feet touched the ground, she only saw a blinding radiance making it hard to keep her eyes open.

She struggled; her eyes narrowed before getting a good look at the surroundings.

This appeared to be a public square but in reality, it was just a massive treasury causing her to gasp. The roof was high enough to look like the sky, containing countless treasures, artifacts, and materials. She felt tiny in comparison.

These items emitted the entire color spectrum. Some weapons had frightening auras or bone-chilling glints.

This was her first time seeing so many treasures in one place. It exceeded her imagination or rather, she had never dared to imagine something of this scale before.

Her eyes were wide open while looking at the mountains of chaos stones and coins. They looked like pyramids.

“Yin Yang Coins, Myriad-form Coins, Heavenly Sovereign Coins...” She gradually became dizzy since all levels of money were seen in mass quantity. She felt as if she was in an ocean with coins as far as the eye can see.

This was akin to a mortal finding himself in a room with gold bricks piling on top of each other - enough to drive someone crazy.

Their appearance was one thing but they also emitted a chaos aura. She felt as if she was in the center of the universe. Having this much money meant being a crownless king. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She eventually swallowed her saliva and asked the mouse: “They, they’re all yours?”

The hug mouse glanced at the mountains once, not thinking that it was a big deal.

Li Qiye didn’t bother looking and smiled: “Let’s go. The coins are nice but there are better things ahead. He started walking forward.

“Better things?” She gulped again but couldn’t take another step, still preoccupied with the money. This reaction was rather understandable.

She eventually followed the group into the material section. Divine metals and treasure ores were stored here, either scattered on the ground or stored in trunks and chests.

Her eyes had trouble taking them all into account. One metal had a crimson color from top to bottom on top of being ablaze. Loud sizzles could be heard coming from it. One would think that it could burn down the entire treasury.

Another large crystal ore had the appearance of a rock candy. It brimmed brilliantly, making people one to start a bite. No one would do so since it exuded a terrifying cold affinity. The ground around it had a layer of frost.

There was one particular root with a raging tornado around it. The root floated and spun in the air as a result.

“That, that earthflame steel is worth 50,000 per kilogram...” She recognized many of the materials and became amazed: “Whoa, that ice-source stone is so big, this is the first time I’ve seen one this size. Back in Wish Ward, a fist-sized one sold for 3,000. How much will this thing sell for...”

She had seen some of them before but only in small quantities. Nonetheless, they still fetched for a crazy price. The ones found here were unreasonably large, the same with their value.

There were some materials that she had never seen or heard of before, unable to assess their worth.

“Why are you surprised?” Li Qiye shook his head and pointed at a root: “This is the valuable item here. You can have more earthflame steel and ice-source stone and they still aren’t worth as much as that thing.”

“What is it?” Yang Ling stared at the root surrounded by a tornado.

“Windprop celestial wood.” Li Qiye said: “This treasury is not bad, still has a few decent stuff.”

“This is just not bad? I think several countries combined can’t have this amount of wealth.” Yang Ling disagreed.

Li Qiye only smiled in response.

The mouse didn’t say anything either; its lips slightly perched. Yang Ling felt as if this disdain wasn’t aimed towards her question but rather, it didn’t think highly of this treasury either.

The group eventually made out of the material section and saw a statue ahead. This place could be considered as the center of the treasury.

Li Qiye glanced at the statue and smiled: “A good spot right in the center. An ordinary person can’t do this, definitely the work of a dao lord.”

Yang Ling didn’t understand since she didn’t notice anything peculiar about the statue at first. However, the more she stared at the statue, the more familiar it seemed.

“I, I know who he is! He’s the founding king!” Something flashed in her mind and she blurted out.

“Yes, the patriarch of Vajra.” Li Qiye smiled in agreement.

“So I’m right...” She became stunned.

It has been millions of years since the founding date of Vajra. However, as a noble, she saw numerous portraits of this man, hence her ability to recognize the statue.

“It’s not left behind by a regular person due to how special the spot is, right at the center.” Li Qiye added: “This crafty method was carried out by Vajra Dao Lord to help out the dynasty.”

“Vajra Dao Lord created this statue?” Yang Ling said.

Vajra Dao Lord has never stated his relation to Vajra. This dynasty used to be known as Archaic Sun. It later announced that Vajra Dao Lord was a prince of the dynasty. Future generations even went further and considered him as an important ancestor, changing their name to Vajra Dynasty.

“So where is this place?” Yang Ling thought of something.

“You tell me.” Li Qiye smirked.

“It can’t be... this is the treasury of Vajra?” Yang Ling expressed her bold speculation.

“You’re right. This is the national treasury of Vajra.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“... the nation-national treasury...” Yang Ling stammered, not expecting this to be her current location.

This treasury was one of the highly guarded locations in the dynasty. It had plenty of seals and defensive measures.

Not to mention an outsider, even the royal members of the clan needed permission from the ancestors to enter. There were stringent rules for entry as well.
