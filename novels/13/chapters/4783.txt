Chapter 4784: Tian Tu

This newcomer turned out to be rather young in age and wore a plain robe. In fact, his lack of aura actually reminded people of Li Qiye.

The difference between the two of them was the determined pair of eyes belonging to the youth - a stark contrast to Li Qiye’s ever-so-present lackadaisical gaze.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The youth’s focus seemed to be in a distant place. His eyes brimmed with determination and perseverance.

The crowd noticed this because Li Qiye clearly paid attention as well. Otherwise, in another setting, they might not have given him a second glance.

With enough time, it became apparent to the top masters that he was special. No one would be able to move him from his position or defeat him. He was as still as an eternal mountain - unsurpassable and indestructible. This surprised them because they have never met him before.

“Senior Brother.” Specter Monarch bowed while Six-dao Monarch and Cosmic Lord bowed even lower.

The chosen honorifics shocked everyone because who could be older than Specter Monarch in True Immortal? Though the youth had a regular appearance, he was obviously anything but. 

“Specter Monarch’s senior brother?” Cultivators murmured in confusion. His senior brother must be another disciple of Blessed Dao Lord.

However, the ancient ancestors didn’t recognize him.

“He is Blessed Dao Lord’s disciple?” An undying cultivator from that actual generation wondered.

Of course, she didn’t have anything to do with True Immortal. Nonetheless, the accomplished cultivators from True Immortal were famous and known by all, especially Blessed Dao Lord’s disciples.

As a peerless dao lord, his disciples were rather brilliant. Even Worldraiser who was mocked for lacking talent still leaped over the dragon gate and became a dao lord. Therefore, this youth must be just as great.

In reality, not to mention outsiders, even members of True Immortal didn’t recognize him. This included hall leaders, protectors, elders, and even ancestors.

They never got the chance to meet Specter Monarch. Nonetheless, they still knew that there was such an ancient ancestor around. This wasn’t the case for this particular youth.

“A little interesting.” Li Qiye smiled.

The youth’s eyes seemed empty as if he was only focusing on something distant. The current world couldn’t command his attention.

However, he focused his gaze on Li Qiye after hearing this and bowed: “It is Tian Tu’s honor to meet you, Sir. My master has mentioned you before.” [1]

“Tian Tu!” Dao Sanqian realized who he was after hearing his name and found this astonishing: “Blessed Dao Lord’s first disciple!”

Listeners were amazed to hear this. The name was unfamiliar to them but that position was something else.

Normally, the most talked about disciple was none other than Worldraiser Dao Lord due to his underdog story or a supreme genius such as Specter Monarch.

“Wait, I thought Blessed Dao Lord’s first disciple was Worldraiser Dao Lord.” Someone else murmured.

“Do you know anything about this?” An ancestor asked his friends.

This was entirely new to them. They wouldn’t have known if it wasn’t for Dao Sanqian.

“It’s him.” An existence that has been to Worldbreaker before said: “He’s the one who learned the supreme fist dao there and still came out unscathed…”

“Leaving Worldbreaker?” The crowd was astonished.

“Wow, that’s Blessed Dao Lord’s first disciple for you.” Someone sighed and said.

Learning the dao in Worldbreaker meant becoming a fist slave. No one could escape this fate outside of Godfist. However, his status was still a fist slave.
