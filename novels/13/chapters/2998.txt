This ancient warship was massive and appeared before the world once more.

In the olden days, Fire Ancestor’s mighty force was praised to be the strongest expedition in history.

Arrogance Enterprise created a peerless warship - a feat enough to shock Three Immortals.

After so many years, this great ship showed up in Immortal Lineage once again. Alas, the crew was nowhere to be found.

No one was in a jolly mood right now despite seeing something so magnificent.

“The expedition ship is back?!” The elders of Arrogance Enterprise heard this news and immediately activated a heavenly mirror in order to get a better look.

“Yes, that’s Fire Ancestor’s ship.” They exchanged glances afterward.

“How can this be? That group back then could only be described as unmatched...” One of them turned pale. He was lucky enough to see the creation of this ship along with the crew back then. That crew was utterly peerless - one and only in history.

“...” The crowd shuddered at this realization.

“This is unimaginable. Fire Ancestor’s group back then was unreal. He had four other progenitors with him, more than ten full-strength emperors, and a hundred Everlastings... That’s enough to suppress the entire world.” A person lucky enough to be born in that era saw the expedition in person.

Four progenitors who were living reclusively back then actually came along with Fire Ancestor. These top masters accepted the summon and prepared to enter Uncrossable Expanse. Alas, none of them could be seen here.

The crowd became even more frightened after hearing the details. Many have heard about the great expedition before but didn’t have a good idea of the actual scale until now.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call that group unbeatable.

“So where are they...?” This question came next.

There would be obvious signs on the ship if they were alive. This was certainly not the case.

However, the other morbid possibility was just too much to accept. If all of them have died, then...

“I just don’t know...” The crowd wanted to know what had happened to this great ship.

They found it hard to breathe because of the ominous atmosphere. Nonetheless, no one dared to enter that ship.

Those who have tried to do so with the previous ones have met their maker with the exception of Supreme Emperor who ran for his life. The unknown entities up there were horrifically powerful.

Going up there might end in death. That’s why they weighed themselves against the emperor and chose to survive instead.

“It’s really not looking good...” The bull murmured after seeing the expedition ship: “Looks like it’s even worse than expected. Just what the hell is it over there?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It has always been monstrous, you just didn’t realize it before.” A faint voice answered the bull.

It looked back and saw Li Qiye standing there since who knows when?

It heaved a sigh of relief and said: “Sir, take a look and see what it is.”

Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed as he stared at the expedition ship, capable of piercing through it.

“Fiercest is here.” A spectator spotted him and said quietly.

A while ago, many were annoyed at him for various reasons. However, seeing him now made them feel better.

After all, having a big shot present served as a calming medicine.

“Let’s go take a look.” Li Qiye chuckled after the first observation.

“Haha, I’ll go wherever you go, Sir. You can even shoulder a falling sky, this is no big deal.” The bull laughed.

“May I come with you, Dao Brother? I offer you my service.” Holyfrost Emperor appeared and cupped her fist.

“So lucky...” Some still felt jealousy towards him despite the grim situation.

Holyfrost was mighty, talented, and one of the prettiest women in Immortal Lineage. So many men had a crush on her right now. Alas, none could win her attention until Li Qiye.

“Haha, little girl, you’re very smart.” The bull looked at her and laughed.

“That’s fine.” Li Qiye didn’t refuse and began heading for the expedition ship.

She followed right behind him, floating just like a fairy. Her cold demeanor made all the men go crazy.

“Haha, I’m going too.” The bull told Liu Yanbai to get on its back again before chasing after the other two.

The three disappeared inside the ship while the spectators watched on.

The expedition ship was still silent as ever. This went on for quite a while, akin to the group sinking to the bottom of the ocean.

“What should we do?” Some wondered. Fiercest was immensely strong yet still disappeared like the rest.

“Let’s go take a look.” A youth with great divinity and halos showed up and flew towards the ship.

“Shen Guzhan! He’s going!” Someone recognized him and shouted.

“We’re going too.” Several old men cloaked in black from top to bottom also appeared on the deck of the ship.

“Ancestors from Arrogance Enterprise.” Some still recognized them.

“It’s time to go.” Other ancestors couldn’t wait after seeing so many up there already, especially those at the Everlasting level.

“Don’t miss out on this.” People grew bolder and followed suit.

However, when their feet made contact with the ship, they were no longer on top of it.

The scene before them changed. They saw a massive plain with rolling mountains to the distance. Sky Pass was nowhere to be found.

“Where, where are we?” Some became startled.

“The ship is an independent world.” An ancestor noticed.

“Haha, that’s right, Arrogance Enterprise didn’t only create a ship. They went as far as building a base for a minor world. They created an entire celestial system here too for the crew.” A voice revealed.
