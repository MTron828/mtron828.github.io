Chapter 5018: Unsolvable

Though Skystomper wanted to avenge his disciple, he still needed to give Bloodfly face. Golden Cicada King was one thing but Bloodfly God was far more dangerous.

“Two god sources for whoever can solve this tablet.” Bloodfly himself brought this up again.

The guests naturally wanted the god sources. The problem was that both Radiant Monarch and Wild Dragon had failed. Others weren’t as capable.

“You should try, Sovereign.” Bloodfly God suggested.

Though he didn’t invite the sovereign and Truth Conqueror, these two were here anyway. It would be great if they could somehow solve the puzzle.

“I’m not interested in the god sources but I will give it a shot if you tell me the truth.” Thousand-faced Sovereign responded.

“Very well, since you’re so insistent, solve the tablet and I will tell you everything I know.” Bloodfly responded.

The sovereign’s persistent attempt confused listeners. Didn’t Phenomena Conqueror leave the lower continents already? Why did his master want to know his reason for coming to Demon? There must be more to this story.

Thus, they wanted him to solve this tablet in order to listen to the rest of the secret.

“It’s a deal.” The sovereign focused all of his faces on the table. Their worlds gathered into a single spot and illuminated the surface.

This was a magnificent scene that broadened everyone’s horizons. He didn’t resort to techniques and merit laws - only focusing his eyes on one spot.

A dao key manifested into reality - one capable of opening any puzzle.

“Creak…” The tablet seemed to be rotating in accordance with his dao.

Spectators watched with full attention as the black spots on the tablet were actually moving. He was capable of changing complexity into simplicity and solving any problem.

“Amazing, this level of derivation.” All the top cultivators couldn’t help but be amazed.

Some had six fruits just like him but couldn’t do something like this.

Creaking noises continued and Bloodfly God was visibly excited. It seemed to be working.

He had spent generations researching this tablet to no avail and thought that this guy was the master of a conqueror for a reason.

“Boom!” However, a primordial power oozed from the tablet and horrified everyone. Even the dragon lords staggered backward.

The sovereign was sent backward and his thousand-faced phenomenon disappeared. They only returned once he stabilized his stance.

“I am no match for this force.” He said while drenched in sweat. Whoever performed this seal was absolutely an apex existence.

“Just a bit more.” Bloodfly God said.

“A conqueror’s master indeed.” Radiant Monarch said, feeling nothing but respect since he had attempted it himself.

The other dragon lords felt the same way despite their pride and arrogance. They couldn’t have gotten as far as he did.

“A bit more indeed. I can derive and overcome the mysteries of the seal. The problem is the actual power sealing it at the last section.” The sovereign said.

“I’ll help you.” Bloodfly contained his excitement and said.

“You are a blood drinker. Strong but not part of the righteous dao, it is different from mine.” The sovereign refused.

Most wouldn’t appreciate the unpleasant comment since it sounded disdainful. However, Bloodfly only cared about the tablet currently so he ignored this.

“Conqueror, if you can support me with your pure power, we’ll be able to open it.” The sovereign asked Truth Conqueror for help.

The two of them working together should be unstoppable. The only person who could potentially beat them was Conceal Conqueror.

The others thought that if she were to help, they might actually be able to open this tablet.

She stared at it for a while before shaking her head: “I’m afraid I cannot help you, Sovereign. It is best not to open this ominous tablet.”

He sighed after hearing this, unable to force the issue.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Commanding God, why must you open this tablet?” She asked a crucial question that was on everyone’s mind.

“Just a matter of fate.” He didn’t wish to reveal.

“As I have said, don’t open this tablet.” She responded and glanced at Li Qiye before leaving.

“I suppose this is it. I will come again once I have more clues.” Thousand-faced Sovereign was also left in a tough situation.

He couldn’t solve the tablet nor force Bloodfly to speak. Therefore, he disappeared from the palace as well.

Their arrival left many questions for the crowd. However, it seemed that only Bloodfly could answer this.

Bloodfly wanted to keep the sovereign back but exercised restraint.

“No one can solve this tablet then.” He said with disappointment.

“Not hard at all, would only take a second.” Li Qiye said confidently while sitting in the master chair and eating melon seeds.

Bloodfly immediately gazed intensely at Li Qiye, intimidating weaker cultivators.

“I understand why Shadowrider is here as well.” He sat there nonchalantly, unaffected by the top masters around him.
