Chapter 5158: Omnipotent Sword

“Enough with the nonsense, let us begin!” Windchaser didn’t want to prolong this.

“Fellow Daoists, your stubbornness will be the end of you.” Sacred Sword Monarch’s holy aura pulsed outward.

His sword dao and his holy aura were one. Anything touched by the light was also being assaulted by the sword.

Two top swordsmen of the uppre continents were present. This actually boosted their dao when used in conjunction.

“Die!” Windchaser raised both hands and summoned winds and clouds, culminating in a terrible storm with the shape of a dragon. It coiled around him and released its draconic might.

Alas, the other side felt nothing because the heavenly sword easily blocked the storm.

“Rising Dragon!” Windchaser performed the first attack and the storm dragon soared forward, crushing everything along the way.

Its target was Heavenly Sword Conqueror, wanting to destroy his sword domain. It crushed all the laws in front of him and the sword barriers as well.

“Hmph.” Heavenly Sword Conqueror scowled and slashed the air, breaking through the fabrics of reality. From the gap came endless chaos and unstable affinities.

The heavenly sword inside the sword domain easily split the dragon into two halves. Nonetheless, the energy dragon didn’t stop and lightning bolts rushed out of its dismembered head.

“Boom!” It exploded and all the lightning bolts came toward Heavenly Sword.

“Break!” He roared and swung horizontally to create an azure, preventing anything from getting through.

This did more than just stop the lightning barrage. The physical force alone caused Windchaser to vomit blood.

As for Harkrain, she had attacked at the same time as her lover. Alas, Sacred Sword Monarch was prepared and utilized his sacred domain.

“Omnipotent Sword!” He unleashed a special technique to separate the couple.

Just a moment ago, they were standing together with their fingers intertwined. Now, the slash created numerous dimensions between them.

Harkrain’s expression soured and formed a mudra. Rain drops in the sky gathered together to morph time and space.

“Spaceshifter!” She chanted and turned the rain drops into gigantic swords before sending them toward the back.

This surprised the spectators because Sacred Sword Monarch was positioned to her front. The swords were completely off target.

However, they somehow appeared behind him, ready to pierce his heart. During this split second of temporal instability, she appeared behind him as well to deliver a fatal blow.

Her raindrops seemed capable of twisting the fabrics of time and space, making it difficult to evade her attacks.

Nonetheless, the nine-fruit dragon lord didn’t panic at all. Although he didn’t actually see the swords appearing behind him, he felt danger and created a sword barrier stretching across three thousand worlds.

“Rumble!” This successfully stopped the thrust and pushed forward.

She couldn’t stop it either and was sent flying, bloodied.

“They both lost.” The crowd saw the outcome. Although it was only the first exchange, both Windchaser and Harkrain suffered serious injuries.

“This might be their last day.” They knew that even escaping was not possible. They were sealed by the sword domain and the holy aura.

“It is not too late to change your mind. Heaven Alliance’s gate remains open.” Heavenly Sword Conqueror said.

“Join us.” Sacred Sword Monarch’s tone was far more aggressive.

In the eyes of regular cultivators, Harkrain and Windchaser Conqueror were virtually unbeatable.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lamentably, they still couldn’t control their own fate while dealing with the behemoth known as Heaven Alliance.
