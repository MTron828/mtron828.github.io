Chapter 5591: War

“Rumble!” Explosions returned to the peaceful Dao Domain.

Beams terrorized the ground from above - the descent of powerful cultivators. Once they stood up, their imperial auras immediately engulfed the region.

“Emperors!” Cultivators from Dao Domain became alarmed.

Lights came together to form a dao platform or a battlefield outside Dao Domain. An imposing army came into sight - all wearing golden armor with a unique glow.

This happened in several different locations - bright platforms and major armies. They were led by the majestic figures who appeared first, looking like giants.

“Celestial Court!” Members of Dao Domain were startled to see themselves fully surrounded.

“What are they doing…?” A big shot blurted.

“What do you think, a mass mobilization like that can only mean one thing.” An emperor remained calm and said.

“A sudden invasion…” A dragon lord said after seeing the armies all around the region.

“This is a declaration of war!” Big shots didn’t know what to think.

The immortal continent enjoyed peace after Grand Dao War. The three major factions came to an implicit understanding - a ceasefire.

Some said that this was due to Celestial Court’s unknown visitor being killed. Others said that Immortal Dao City and Imperial Field have suffered enough losses. Numerous emperors and monarchs had fallen, let alone weaker cultivators who were mere fodders.

In history, an official declaration preceded the great wars. Feuds and conflicts between their members didn’t warrant this, only an actual invasion.

If Celestial Court wanted to attack Immortal Dao City or vice versa, they always declared their intention publicly. Now, armies appeared without warning and shocked the other side.

“Starseer Conqueror, Heavendew Conqueror, Command Conqueror, Sanctity Conqueror…” A powerful cultivator observed the leaders of the armies.

“We’re surrounded.” Someone else commented - this seemed to be a direct attack.

“Blow the horns!” Jadesword, Skysplitter, and Six-finger prepared for battle.

The sounds of horns echoed across Dao Domain afterward.

“Celestial Court is invading, prepare for battle.” Sects and kingdoms entered a state of alert.

“Rumble!” Imperial lineages activated their barriers, fortifying their territories. Their strongest cultivators also appeared in person.

Unfortunately, due to the closing of Immortal Dao City, their side looked weak compared to the encroaching armies.

“Immortal Dao City, will it open again?” Big shots couldn’t help but glance in one direction.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Alas, the gates remained closed and no emperor came out to help.

“Damn it, who will protect Dao Domain now?” The People’s morale dropped drastically since everyone felt isolated and without help.

The pillars from the previous wars such as Immortal Emperor Fei Yang and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan were nowhere to be seen.

The available defenders included Six-finger, Skysplitter, Jadesword, the five elders, and a few more - far from being competitive.

“Emperors of Celestial Court, what is the meaning of this?” A cultivator shrouded in radiance demanded an answer.

“Luminous Conqueror will fight.” Some felt a bit better after hearing his voice.

At the very least, they still had one apex conqueror in charge. Otherwise, the whole faction was no different from a headless snake.

“Now is the time for Celestial Court to rule this region.” Someone walked out of the chaos and responded.

He possessed an impressive frame on top of huge hands, seemingly capable of delivering untold devastation.

He was up there in age and wore a gray robe, looking relaxed yet imposing - always ready for battle. The world fell into silence after his appearance.
