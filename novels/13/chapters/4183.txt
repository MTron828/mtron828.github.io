Chapter 4184: How To Enter?

“Boom!” The earth spun as the flying palace slammed into a cliff. The existing platform was a perfect match for the shape of the palace, serving as its foundation.

The entire thing looked like they were meant for each other, that this was their original form.

“The Dra-dragon palace!” Chen Cangsheng and Snowcloud Princess were astounded.

Though she was ready to see something amazing from Li Qiye, she didn’t expect it to be the eighth grave. She smiled wryly, thinking that it was impressive indeed.

“Over there!” Others have caught up at this point. They focused on the palace and didn’t notice Li Qiye’s group.

“It finally landed!” The news of its descent exploded across the zone. People rushed over right away due to the potential fortune in there after the landing.

“This is our best chance to enter.” The surroundings became packed with cultivators.

“I’ve been told that the divine dragon sword might be in there.” All were eager to give this a shot.

“Creak…” A creaking noise akin to a gate opening could be heard. In reality, it was the gigantic dragon coiling around the palace, not a gate.

Of course, this wasn’t a living dragon. It was made from unknown materials and supreme laws, resulting in it looking animated and alive. Its draconic aura oozed out in torrential waves.

The palace was made from gold and jade, looking magnificent and expensive. This was the case for the dragon as well. It’s just that ordinary gold couldn’t create something this magnificent. It slowly coiled around the palace as if it was on patrol.

“Can we actually go in?” One cultivator was afraid of the dragon.

“Might as well try.” A last-gen cultivator shouted and leaped forward like a thunderous crane, leaving a bright trail behind on his path.

“Raa!” Once he got close enough, the dragon roared and released its destructive draconic aura.

“Bam!” He was pushed back by the aura and smashed onto the ground, nearly pulverized from the ordeal. No one knew if he was still alive or not.

“It’s so strong…” Others gasped after seeing this.

“My turn!” One was undeterred and summoned a treasure pouring endless lava against the gigantic dragon.

The dragon easily took down the lava wave with one claw. The attacker didn’t get away either and was struck by the attack. He was reduced to a meat paste after screaming once.

“How the hell do we get past that dragon?” The spectators wondered.

“I don’t think anyone can beat it one-on-one.” One member speculated.

“Raa!” The dragon suddenly opened its mouth and bit something in the air during this moment of hesitation.

“Ahh!” A cultivator in stealth screamed. Space fluctuated a bit before he was swallowed by the dragon.

It turned out that a powerful cultivator wanted to try to sneak past the dragon. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out for him.

“We need to rush and attack together, distract it and some will be able to get in.” An ancestor had this idea.

Those nearby agreed and started forming groups for this purpose. This force included several hundred cultivators. They spread out and surrounded the palace.

“Go!” They exchanged glances and the leader gave the command.

All leaped up while summoning their treasures. Loud explosions ensued - pagodas, bright cauldrons, celestial words, mighty staffs…

The dragon suffered attacks from all directions. Colorful lights and flames engulfed the sky. Myriad laws danced like wild serpents.

They hoped to distract the dragon with these attacks and stop it from reacting to their intrusion.

“Raa!” The dragon roared and performed a full tail-whip.

The treasures struck by its tail exploded instantly. This resulted in something akin to fireworks at night. The attackers weren’t fortunate enough to escape regardless of their location.

The tail carried a meteoric force, sending cultivators flying into the ground and peaks. The weaker cultivators were reduced to nothing but blood. The stronger ones suffered grievous injuries, on the verge of death…

Several hundred cultivators went down just like that - a testament to the dragon’s power.

“This is impossible, it doesn’t matter how many divine swords are in there, we can’t get in.” Experts began to give up.

“Has anyone been in there before?” One youth asked.

“Yes, there has been one, at least to my knowledge.” An old ancestor pondered for a bit before answering.

“Who is it?” Listeners became attentive.

The ancestor elaborated: “Sure, there might have been others, but I personally know that one person has gone in there via brute force - Dao Sanqian.”

“Dao Sanqian!” Others were moved after hearing this thunderous name, ancestors included.

This name had more clout than even the Five Overlords.

“I’m not surprised at all, he’s invincible.” One expert murmured.

Others shared the same sentiment and didn’t question the validity of this claim.

“Did he take the dragon sword with him?” The youth asked again.

“Rumor has it that he obtained a draconic painting from there, nothing about a divine dragon sword though or the effects of the painting.” The old ancestor shook his head.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“How are we going to replicate this feat? We’re nothing compared to him.” One clan master smiled wryly.
