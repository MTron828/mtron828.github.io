Chapter 5293: The Unknown

“Boom!” A loud bang suddenly interrupted their conversation. It was as if something was hammering the sky vault itself.

“Zzz…” The portal leading to Lesser Firmament became resplendent.

Li Qiye and the godchild looked up and saw oval-shaped crystal walls stacking on top of each other, forming a barrier to seal this region off from the rest of the world.

“The crystal walls.” The godchild furrowed his brows after seeing this.

“Rumble!” Detonating blasts came from another side within Lesser Firmament. Nonetheless, they could still be heard through the barrier.

“Something’s happening.” Li Zhitian murmured.

A dark fog suddenly appeared within the radiance, surging and slamming into the barrier. Something seemed eager to break out of confinement.

“I have some business to take care of.” The godchild disappeared into the sea of people.

Li Qiye smiled and shook his head before leaving with the group. They found the new area of the tavern and saw that there was no customer still.

“There’s an issue with First Brother.” The boss of the tavern glanced in the direction of Lesser Firmament while bringing Li Qiye a plate of side dishes.

Cultivators including hidden emperors and dao lords became alerted as well. They could tell that there was a problem happening but no one could enter.

“Rumble!” An endless power erupted from there and swept across the two continents through the barrier.

Although people couldn’t fully witness the scenes unraveling in Lesser Firmament, they could see majestic figures shrouded in heavenly laws, roaring and attempting to suppress the fog. Moreover, a coffin seemed to be in there, barely visible.

“There’s something ominous inside Lesser Firmament.” A dragon lord whispered.

Lesser Firmament has been reclusive all this time. Only a selected few could actually visit. Thus, this resulted in speculations regarding the secrets within - that certain ancient emperors and monarchs were hiding something.

“Buzz.” A ray from outer space descended - a figure appeared outside of Lesser Firmament.

This was a youth with an impressive aura, easily recognized by everyone.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Xiao Qingtian of Azure School, why is he here?” Outsiders were surprised to see him.

“I, Qingtian, humbly offer my support in a time of crisis under my master’s order.” He bowed and said.

Everyone focused on the second half of his statement - under my master’s order.

“Is Illumination Conqueror appearing again?” One dragon lord whispered.

This was a name known across the upper continents; his fame didn’t diminish through time and inactivity.

His influence couldn’t be overstated among The People. After all, he was the leader of the coalition against The Race once; his contribution couldn’t be forgotten.

“We appreciate the kind gesture, but please return.” A visual phenomenon of a beautiful pair of wings appeared in the sky along with an answer.

The wings were holy and virtuous, prompting others to kneel in reverence.

“Who is that?” Anyone could tell that this was an incredible existence.

“Immortal Emperor Guan Feng.” An old existence could recognize the voice.

“All the emperors and monarchs from Lesser Firmament have lived for a long time.” Listeners knew that “Immortal Emperor” was a title used during the ancient eras.

Currently, many conquerors and dao lords have lived for eras. However, these emperors and monarchs were beings from before the great calamity.

Lesser Firmament, unlike the other alliances, didn’t actively recruit conquerors and dao lords. Their members consisted of mysterious cultivators from the world before the cataclysm.
