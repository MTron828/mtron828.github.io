Chapter 5495: Impossible

He had never thought of the future before since it would be the same as always due to his dao - hated by all.

“So you don’t need the current me.” He understood the situation.

His current self seemed to be independent from the regular coil of all living things. Nothing wanted to be near him; his existence was merely tolerated by higher powers. In fact, even the most terrifying calamity would actively avoid him.

However, Li Qiye seemed to have a plan for him - something that would surprise even the high heaven.

“The current you is still useful.” Li Qiye shrugged: “Even diarrhea has its moments, don’t you think?”

He glared at Li Qiye because he was indeed treated as “diarrhea” during Immemorial Epoch War. His presence on the fierce battlefields immediately chased away the combatants.

In the end, Celestial Court couldn’t handle the delay and their unknown guest was the one to deliver the killing blow.

“So you want diarrhea?” He asked.

“Not me, I want something else with a greater impact.” Li Qiye smiled and shrugged.

“What do you want me to do?” He asked again while staring straight at Li Qiye.

“If possible, I want you to remember one thing, no, two things.” Li Qiye said before changing his mind again and shaking his head: “One will do.”

“What is it?” The indifferent emperor couldn’t help but become interested.

“Go.” Li Qiye said.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Go?” He didn’t understand.

“There is a place that you have not been to.” Li Qiye elaborated.

This was enough for him to speculate Li Qiye’s intent. He replied: “You want me as a cannon fodder.”

“That’s a harsh way to put it. Maybe I just want to broaden your horizon.” Li Qiye said.

“You’re not the first to try something like this, Immortal Emperor Min Ren and Immortal Emperor Qi Zhen have done something similar.” He didn’t show any sympathy.

“Correct on some counts, but not all. I don’t need anyone to be cannon fodder.” Li Qiye said.

His eyes narrowed as he contemplated about the future. All of a sudden, he realized that there was a sliver of meaning in life, or at least - a tiny longing for the future.

“Hey, it’s not that bad being alive, right?” Li Qiye noticed this and patted his shoulder again.

“Yes.” He said after noticing the minute change in his mentality.

“Trust me, I don’t need cannon fodders.” Li Qiye added.

“Then what do you actually want?” He asked.

Li Qiye stared into the distance and took his time before answering: “Spring is coming so we need to plant the seeds, giving hope to those on the front line.”

“Hope?” He responded: “Have to survive the winter first before spring comes.”

“Yes, and this will be a harsh winter.” Li Qiye said.

“So I’m going?” He asked.

“You won’t see the winter but at the very least, you might be able to plant the seeds of hope in time for spring.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“The seeds of hope.” His frozen and dead heart was stirred by Li Qiye.

His dao had reached the limit and took him here - a strange phenomenon of being alive even after death. Now, Li Qiye sparked something akin to hope within him.

“An unprecedented miracle.” He murmured.

“Yes, one that is done by you.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“When we met in the past, did you predict what would happen?” He asked.

“How could I know way back then?” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You definitely knew, always calculating about how to take down the heaven.” He said.

“Don’t misunderstand, my pursuit has never changed, it is to find the answer.” Li Qiye said.

“Why must I go?” He asked.

“You assumed that I need cannon fodders but that’s not the case. I could have my pick of cultivators who are stronger than you.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s right.” He agreed. Plenty of emperors were stronger than him - Purewood, Bu Zhan, Fei Yang, and many others…

Above them were the legendary overlords. Li Qiye had no reason to pick him.

“As I said, it’s a matter of spreading hope during spring.” Li Qiye said.

“I can bring hope?” He asked since this was the opposite of his world-weary dao.

“Yes, because once things reach their extreme state, they will rebound in the opposite direction.” Li Qiye said.

“I still don’t buy it.” He said.

“Fine, because the villainous heaven will pay attention to you, can’t say that about everyone.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

“Impossible.” He disagreed since the high heaven certainly looked down at him with disgust.

“That’s why it’s interesting. The gifted geniuses and heaven’s favorites aren’t the only ones being watched. In fact, your repulsive self might be the most special one.” Li Qiye said.

“Are you listening to yourself?” This was one of the most unbelievable things he had heard.
