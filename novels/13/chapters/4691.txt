Chapter 4692: Assessments

“Bam!” The mantra struck the paragon and exploded. The youth fell like a meteor and smashed into a peak.

The scene became silent right away; only gasps could be heard.

Wild Paragon had all the momentum before coming into this fight since he has just reached the myriad level. People thought that he was qualified to challenge Li Qiye; a few thought that he would be able to win.

Those who doubted him believed that Li Qiye would need to try rather hard and show some ace cards, meaning that it would be a fierce battle. No one expected his victory to come so easily.

He didn’t use a supreme merit law or top technique at all. This made the disparity rather apparent.

“Just how strong is he?” One ancestor whispered.

“It’s hard to truly assess him. He looks weak in terms of appearance but once he makes his move, he looks unbeatable.” A big shot said.

From a distance, the saintess looked rather somber: “Senior Brother, this is your strongest rival. We must eliminate him.”

“Yes, he’s a big threat on the dao path indeed.” The young emperor admitted.

“There’s nothing about his background, he doesn’t give any hint with his attacks.” She tilted her head, pondering.

“He is so attuned with the grand dao, every movement is natural.” The emperor had a serious expression since he lacked confidence in going against Li Qiye.

This wasn’t the case for the other conquerors. Though they were relatively even in strength, he thought that he would emerge triumphantly. Li Qiye was the sole exception.

“You are at a great disadvantage against him, Senior Brother.” She became worried.

Despite a lack of information, the young emperor said: “It’s not just about personal strength and talent. It’s too early to be pessimistic and most importantly, he is alone. One man can’t change the tides.”

This was proven historically since countless supreme geniuses died before becoming the dao lord. Though their talent gave them the greatest chance, they still failed to last to the end due to the perilous nature of the competition

“I believe in you, Senior Brother.” She answered.

On another side, the handsome Shen Juntian has been watching as well. Next to him were Godwhip Princess and Paramount Scion.

“His mastery of the dao is unreal.” Shen Juntian couldn’t help but praise. His knowledge exceeded that of some ancient ancestors.

After all, his father was a dao lord. He had met plenty of top masters before so he had a good glimpse into true invincibility. He had sensed his father’s power previously.

“We must eliminate him somehow.” Godwhip Princess said.

Shen Juntian revealed a smile that completely captivated her. He replied: “This path doesn’t end well for most. The danger doesn’t end after becoming the dao lord either since more powerful foes will show up. This is just the nature of seeking the dao.”

“Your dao heart puts me to shame.” She had nothing but love and admiration in her eyes.

“No, I merely had a fortunate upbringing. I would be nothing more than an ordinary person if it wasn’t for Father’s augmenting my physical constitution, definitely inferior to the two of you.” He shook his head.

“You’re joking, Senior Brother.” Paramount Scion disagreed: “Even if you aren’t the descendant of a dao lord, your heart and mind alone make you exceptional, no different from an immortal from above.”

“Well said, Senior Brother Paramount.” The princess agreed: “You are the most benevolent person we have met, unstained by the mortal coil. We shouldn’t be muttered in the same breath as you.”

“You’re too kind.” He smiled again. Any girl would fall head over heels for him right now after seeing this dazzling scene.

Godwhip Princess was proud and arrogant due to her status and accomplishment. Shen Juntian was the only one who made her feel this way.

“Paramount, do you know his identity?” Juntian asked.

Paramount Scion shook his head: “I know very little about Young Noble Li but I speculate that he is deeply related to Ancestral Divine Temple.”

“I see.” Shen Juntian’s expression became serious.

“In my opinion, he might actually be related to… the Supreme Monarch.” Paramount became quieter as he uttered this title.

“The Supreme Monarch.” Shen Juntian shuddered once and stood up straight, looking dignified to show respect. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“The monarch’s direct disciple?” He wondered.

“I don’t think the Supreme Monarch ever had a direct disciple. The most likely person was Thousand-hand Dao Lord.” Paramount Scion responded.

“That’s one possibility.” Shen Juntian nodded: “Why would the monarch recruit a disciple after so many years?”

“Even if he is the monarch’s disciple, you are still stronger, Senior Brother.” The princess said. In her eyes, no other youth could compare to Shen Juntian: “You are the son of a dao lord and the disciple of a patriarch. He has no advantages to speak of.”

In terms of background alone, not even True Immortal Young Emperor could match him.

“No.” He said: “The Supreme Monarch stands at the apex. Not even Master dares to be careless and Father once said that she has something capable of killing dao lords.”

“!!!” The other two geniuses gasped after hearing this.

They believed that dao lords were invincible in this world. Just beating them was hard enough, let alone killing them.

They would have laughed at anyone else for saying this. Alas, Shen Juntian’s information came from his father, an actual dao lord. This might also be the reason for Dan Sanqian’s prudence.

“Senior Brother, all of this don’t matter. The one who will become the next dao lord is none other than you.” She still had absolute confidence in him.
