This development amused the crowd since it was rather rare.

“It’s fine if Her Highness wins. If anything, it’s pure love.” Even some of the male youths supported.

“That’s right, this might become a tale to be sung for a long time to come.” Others loudly chimed in.

“I hope she wins!” A furor broke out.

Some forgot their original goal, seemingly only wanting to see the princess winning and marrying the beauty. This would become quite a topic for Sky Border.

Moreover, it became far more interesting than a simple competition. They would prefer her winning over supreme geniuses such as True Immortal Spirit. That would be too boring compared to the alternative.

However, a third cultivator jumped onto the stage. He wore an embroidered robe with golden stitchings. He seemed to be from riches but his cultivation didn’t seem exceptional.

He smiled and told the two combatants: “Fellow Daoists, since you’re hesitating, how about fighting me instead?”

“Fine.” True Immortal Spirit wanted to get out of this difficult situation and accepted the challenge, thinking that he would only need a move or two to deal with this random.

“Brat, state your name first before fighting!” A crowd member shouted.

“I come from the distant Clan of the Clouds, others call me Xiao San.” The youth smiled.

Listeners frowned because they haven’t heard of this clan and person before.

“Just a nobody.” Someone said.

“Make your move.” True Immortal Spirit said.

“Very well, I’ll be starting.” The youth formed a mudra and roared: “True Dragon Call!”

“Raa!” A golden radiance erupted along with draconic energy. This powerful technique froze the crowd. They didn’t expect this nobody to be so fierce and mighty.

The energy in the form of a dragon looked primed to fight anyone.

“Go!” True Immortal Spirit didn’t dare to underestimate his opponent after seeing this. He raised his hand and swung down horizontally as if it was a hatchet. The slash was accompanied by thunderous explosions.

“Boom!” The shockwaves sent weaker cultivators flying. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Both of them staggered several steps backward after the first exchange.

“What the hell?!” The crowd couldn’t believe it.

“That was even.” One of them said.

The big shots became interested in this fight since it was rare for another youth to match up to True Immortal Spirit.

“Where is he from?” Someone murmured.

“I’ve never heard of him or his clan before.” Another shook his head.

“True Immortal Spirit hasn’t gone all out yet, not using a weapon either. I don’t think this Xiao San can handle it then.”

“Nonetheless, he is quite powerful and should be famous.” One commenter stated. This person’s power far exceeded most of the young generation.

“Who might you be?” True Immortal Spirit became surprised. [1]

“Just a nobody from the Clan of the Clouds.” Xiao San didn’t reveal his true origin.

“Fine, let’s see what else you can do. I doubt you’ll be able to hide your identity for long.” True Immortal Spirit said.

He learned enough to know the various famous techniques. Eventually, he would be able to force some clues from this youth.

“Era raiser!” He channeled his energies and released his cultivation halos. The next swing could split the heaven and earth to create a new world.

“Boom!” Chaos energy poured down like waterfalls. This slash was exceedingly destructive and suffocated the spectators.

“This is his true power?!” One of them shouted.

“Heavenly Dragon!” Xiao San was undeterred and retaliated with a golden dragon. It coiled in the sky and was too much for this dimension to bear.

Others found themselves to be as insignificant as insects compared to this dragon.

It became a contest between chaos and draconic energy. Once they collided, an explosion crushed the area and disrupted the spatio-temporal affinities.

“That’s a bit familiar…” A big shot thought that she had seen this dragon technique before.

“Indeed.” Her peer felt the same way but couldn’t come up with specifics.

The explosion from the two moves caused weaker spectators to vomit blood. The two sides staggered several steps backward again. This was another even exchange.

“Incredible.” People finally realized that this “Xiao San” could fight evenly against True Immortal Spirit.

“Who are you?!” True Immortal Spirit became startled again. [2]
