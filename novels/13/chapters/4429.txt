Chapter 4430: Horrified

With his comment, Dragon was no longer involved in the feud between Li Qiye and the ex-sect master of Five-sun.

This choice was rather perplexing. A top existence such as the demon god shouldn’t allow anyone to cause trouble in his territory, let alone kill an esteemed guest. In fact, he should be siding with the ex-sect master and protecting him.

Of course, no one dared to criticize him. He was a dragon and they were mere insects. Speaking up was akin to seeking an early death.

“Done tattling? Pick how you want to die.” Li Qiye stared at the ex-sect master.

This prompted him to stagger backward even more while trembling with fear - a stark contrast to his bravado in the beginning. Now, he could see a death god coming for him.

“Dao Brother, be benevolent when possible. If you drop this issue, Our Majesty will show his gratitude…” Featherhat Paragon shouted.

“I’ve given you all a chance several times but you refused.” Li Qiye said: “I’m more interested to see how he will avenge his father now.”

Featherhat Paragon couldn’t respond to this. He didn’t dare to make a reckless move since he couldn’t gauge Li Qiye’s true power.

After all, he was only working for Five-sun King, not a servant. There was no need for him to risk his life.

“The time is ripe. Let’s do this.” Li Qiye played with the saber again.

Everyone started thinking about the future. If Li Qiye were to kill the ex-sect master, would his son seek revenge?

What if Li Qiye was actually unbeatable? Would Five-sun King pay any price for this goal?

Most thought that the best option for Five-sun King was to endure, focus on the grand dao, and become a dao lord first. It wouldn’t be too late for him to try afterward, far easier as well.

“You!” The ex-sect master noted that the other ancestors had no intention of protecting him.

This was understandable since the ex-sect master was considered a junior and they weren’t from the same sect. The only reason why they even cared about him was his son.

“I-if you dare to touch me, you’ll become the enemy of Five-sun School, my son, and all of the east. You can run to the end of the world and my son will still hunt you down!” The ex-sect master tried to quell his fear by threatening.

“Correct, and I can’t wait.” Li Qiye smirked.

“...” The ex-sect master’s face turned red as fear began to take over.

“Make your move.” Li Qiye insisted again.

“Don-don’t be insane…” The ex-sect master stammered since he could see death’s door right now.

“Fine, don’t blame me for starting first.” Li Qiye no longer wanted to waste time and raised his saber.

Just this alone commanded everyone’s attention, even the strongest ancestors. From the beginning, Li Qiye had performed three moves.

The first was extreme speed, killing three elders in the blink of an eye. The second was a casual swing that injured the ex-sect master. The third easily repelled Featherhat Paragon.

None doubted their power. It’s just that they had no idea why the slashes were powerful with the exception of the first.

They thought that they could duplicate the second and third slash without a problem. A new cultivator could certainly learn these saber arts. However, these so-called ordinary arts defeated veteran cultivators.

The current action lacked vitality and energy channeling. There seemed to be nothing empowering it, rendering it difficult for spectators to learn.

Normally, crowd members would be singing praises of top techniques, telling their friends about how invincible they were or the profundity behind the dao.

In this case, no one had anything interesting to say because it looked like a mortal raising a saber.

Nonetheless, they were still trembling inside before the slash is delivered. Some were certain that the ex-sect master was about to be decapitated.

“S-stop!” The ex-sect master felt the same way, no longer daring to take Li Qiye lightly like before. He didn’t dare to confront this technique directly.

“My son, save me!” He threw his reputation away during this crucial moment and roared. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With that, he took out an old talisman created from valuable parchment and impeccable calligraphy. It pulsed with boundless radiance.

“Buzz.” A dao portal appeared behind him, opening a different dimension in order to help the ex-sect master escape.
