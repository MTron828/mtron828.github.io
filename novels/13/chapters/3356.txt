“Divine Tiger Possession!” Everyone was staring at the massive tiger, aware that it could kill all of them with one stomp.

That’s why they quickly retreated far away from the stage in order to stay safe. Weapons and merit laws couldn’t save them here.

This form was Zhan Hu’s strongest defense. It could also serve as an offensive attack with incredible power.

“This is a grand avatar?” They became amazed.

A few wondered if this was the same as the avatar gained from reaching Myriad-form Sanctity. Only those at this cultivation realm could assume this gigantic frame, capable of blotting out the sky and moving the ocean.

Anyone below this realm would be completely crushed by them. Just think about it, their finger was larger than a mountain range.

Those unable to assume the same form would have no chance regardless of their merit laws and treasures.

However, both Huang Ning and Zhan Hu were only enlightened beings, far from reaching the myriad-form realm.

“It’s not a grand avatar.” Zhang Yue observed the tiger and said: “Just the original form of the dao bone during its peak state.”

Zhan Hu’s own power couldn’t activate the armor’s true form during its peak. However, Huang Ning’s empowerment allowed this goal.

A high-level earth armor made from a dao bone meant that the original primal beast was at the yin yang realm - a being equivalent to Zhang Yue who was a peak lord.

“Boom!” The tiger raised its claw and slashed down on Li Qiye.

The world shook as a result due to its massive frame. Everything turned dark. It seemed capable of crushing all of Divine Black.

“Oh, mommy!” Many became scared out of their mind and tried to run.

This divine tiger possession was actually a defensive form. However, the best defense was offense so the tiger took the initiative.

Li Qiye was as insignificant as an ant in comparison. Nonetheless, he smiled and unleashed a very simple and powerless technique. It looked like an old man doing morning exercise to stretch.

“Tortoise Fist!” Everyone knew what it was right away. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

How could this weak punch be able to stop the massive tiger? Impossible, they thought. How could an ant move an elephant?

However, the punch was accompanied by chaos and grand dao. It instantly changed form.

“Boom!” A figure appeared within the chaos.

A divine aura ravaged the area and swept through the ages. One divine beast reigned over all living beings.

“Black Tortoise!” The great figure intimidated everyone in Divine Black.

An actual divine beast, Black Tortoise, has arrived from the chaos to display its dominion.

Masters and kings weren’t worth mentioning before this great beast.

The weaker disciples dropped to the ground. Some didn’t dare to look up at this wondrous being.

“The spirit of our patriarch?” A considerable number started worshipping the figure by kowtowing.

Even the peak lords couldn’t believe this. How could Li Qiye’s Tortoise Fist summon a divine beast?

Everyone here knew that their patriarch was a Black tortoise. The appearance of one right now made them think that its spirit was returning.

“A true divine beast?” The peak lords took a deep breath after sensing its immense aura.

Regardless of whether it was their patriarch or not, this event still shook everyone.

The weakest technique of their sect managed to summon a Black Tortoise. Was this really Tortoise Fist? Even heaven-level merit laws couldn’t come close to touching it.

“Isn’t it also called Black Tortoise Fist? Maybe this is its real name?” One elder murmured.

Prior to this, they knew that the actual title of this technique was Black Tortoise Fist. Alas, they considered it to be an unnecessary embellishment. It didn’t have the power matching its name.

Now, they really believed that it should be called Black Tortoise Fist.

“Oooo-” The creature let out a roar before raising its front leg.

In reality, the turtle wasn’t as big as the divine tiger. Nonetheless, its foot could destroy the cosmo.

Everything was reduced to ashes in the blink of an eye. A divine beast of galactic proportions was nothing more than a worm beneath its foot.

“Raa!” The tiger let out a miserable bellow before disintegrating from the impact.

“Boom!” Both Huang Ning and Zhan Hu were sent flying.

The Divine Tiger Blood Carapace instantly crumbled. Pieces shattered all over the ground. The two of them vomited blood and were painted red from top to bottom.
