Chapter 5419: The Final Badge

“Rumble!” The area shook violently due to the dreadful imperial auras since the combatants no longer held back.

Spectators from a distance had a hard time standing straight. Though they were prepared mentally for a fight of this magnitude, they found themselves akin to floating duckweed amidst a raging ocean. The waves alone could destroy them at any moment.

They once felt pride for being the strongest cultivators in their region. Now, they weren’t qualified to serve as cannon-fodders for this upcoming battle.

They realized that this was not the time to think about politics or the future implications of an all-out war. The only thing now was to think about how to survive.

Some ancient ancestors felt silly for thinking about breaking the Pact of Blessed. It was definitely the only thing keeping them alive.

“Boom!” Heaven and Divine Alliance marched toward Illumination Grotto.

A clear disparity existed between the two sides. Although Illumination had many supporters, his opponents could sweep through the upper continents.

The initial defensive lines began to crumble before the assault.

Nonetheless, Illumination didn’t panic and laughed. He then raised an old badge and shouted: “Heed my wish, destroy everything here!”

“An immortal order?!” Everyone became alarmed after seeing this.

“How does he have a second one?!” A conqueror bellowed in astonishment because he had used one previously.

Only five existed and they were priceless. Four have finally been used by Illumination twice, Supreme, and Jadecure Conqueror. Who had the last one or how did Illumination obtain two of them?

Of course, no one had time to think about these questions.

“Boom!” A supreme power descended - one far beyond anything else in the upper continents. Conquerors and dao lords weren’t worth mentioning.

“Not this again!” Someone who had experienced this power twice shouted in horror.

It felt as if an immortal was descending. The power of the illusory realm could obliterate anyone here, fulfilling Illumination’s wish.

Everyone fell to the ground, unable to handle the pressure.

“Damn you!” A conqueror cursed.

These top cultivators had no issue dying in battle. However, to go down like this was honorless.

“Heed my wish, I exchange my order for nullify his.” All-things raised a badge and said.

An eye seemed to be opening from an unknown place and repelled the pressure.

“The final badge.” Illumination commented nonchalantly while everyone else rejoiced.

The ultimate power receded like the tides, allowing peace and light to return.

].

Everyone on both sides heaved a sigh of relief. Followers of Illumination had different reasons for supporting him.

Some came to fight, not to be destroyed for no reason. Thus, they were furious at Illumination as well.

“Haha, so you had the final one. That’s rather unexpected.” Illumination laughed with a hint of anger.

“You were right, I didn’t have one and had to shamelessly ask Sword Queen for it.” All-things sighed in response and revealed the origin of his badge.

“How did you get the second badge?” Swordsea Dao Lord asked.

They have been watching Illumination closely and expected him to have one badge. Thus, Supreme was ready to counter during the first attempt. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, they had no idea where and how he obtained the second badge.
