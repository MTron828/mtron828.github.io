Chapter 5206: Is The Bun Good?

No one had a problem with Azure Peak and Cleansing Incense taking over two spots. Even after all thirteen thrones were filled, they wouldn’t dare to compete with these powers.

This was especially true for Cleansing Incense due to its murderous intent. Just this alone intimidated everyone.

Although the dynasty was far removed from its golden age, challenging it was awfully unwise.

“The mythical dynasty is here too, that immortal item is truly tempting.” Li Zhitian commented emotionally.

He regained his wits and bid goodbye to Li Qiye: “Dao Brother, I have something to attend to. Goodbye.”

After the youth left, Li Qiye glanced at the murderous intent and sighed: “Cleansing Incense, not bad at all.”

“Let’s go take a look at Imperial Gate.” Having said that, he smiled and said. This could either be a comment to himself or to his followers.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Imperial Gate once reigned Imperial Attendant City. Now, it had lost its role to Suppression Conqueror.

Of course, its decline meant nothing to Li Qiye since it held a special position in his heart.

The group crossed through the main streets and saw how lively the city was. Big shots have arrived so dragon lords could be seen everywhere.

Occasionally, even conquerors, dao lords, and ancient emperors were spotted. Of course, they didn’t announce their arrival yet. Some were here to watch the fun show, not qualified to participate in the grand auction.

Li Qiye didn’t care for most until he came across a traveling cultivator with a muscular frame. He resembled a high mountain with bushy eyebrows and thick, messy hair.

He limped with the help of a wooden stick and held a broken bowl. He carried a dirty backpack and still give off an extraordinary presence amidst the hustle and bustle.

Li Qiye smiled and followed him who seemed to not know anything about the surrounding vibrant world as if he was a walking corpse.

The middle-aged man stopped in a corner and looked around in a daze before sitting down. He placed his bowl on the ground and hugged his knees with both hands, trying to avoid the sunlight.

Nonetheless, he extended his legs and due to these worn-out shoes, his toes were exposed to the sunlight.

A passerby saw his pitiful state and tossed him some coins. However, the seemingly homeless man returned them.

A while later, someone else placed a few buns into the bowl. The man seemed excited as he picked up the buns and started chomping down.

It appeared that everything in the world - whether it be mortal pleasures or immeasurable wealth - couldn’t match up to these buns.

They were meaningless to him - dominion over the world, riches rivaling nations’ treasuries, or even the unreachable immortality.

Li Qiye sat down next to him and said: “Give me one too, haha.”

The man stared at the buns and eventually decided to give Li Qiye a new one from the bowl.

Li Qiye took his time eating; the man did the same. It was as if the buns were endless.

The former stared at his half-eaten bun and commented: “Nothing more to life yet death won’t approach, how agonizing.”

“Mmm.” The man paused for a moment before nodding.

“But do you know what is even worse?” Li Qiye took another bite and said earnestly: “Being able to die yet compelled to live despite knowing the pain all too well. The torment of having to face pain directly without numbing oneself.”

The man finally turned to look at Li Qiye. Although he was covered in dirt, his sculpted features remained. He must have stolen many hearts during his youth.

“That is life.” His voice was coarse yet charismatic.

“Indeed, but the brilliance of existence does not lie in the world but rather, the self.” Li Qiye smiled.

“A solitary dance.” The man paused for a moment before replying.

“The grand dao is a solitary journey. Dancing alone can be brilliant as well. After all, who can accompany and dance with you forever? Only mortals have this privilege when their lives only last for decades.” Li Qiye said.

“I suppose there are worse things than dancing alone.” The man said.

“Everyone is afraid of ghosts.” Li Qiye continued: “But if ghosts exist in the mortal world, the number of ghosts harming people is probably fewer than the number of people who harm others. The human heart is more terrifying than anything.”

The man focused on eating again, albeit at a slower pace.

“I have a bun that I cherish dearly but it ends up at someone else’s house. It’s rather heart-wrenching, should I just eat it?” Li Qiye asked.

“...” The man froze for a second before staring at Li Qiye.

“Does that make me a monster?” Li Qiye chuckled: “Being betrayed is a deeply painful experience, enough to make someone go crazy and do foolish things.”

“It is a monstrous act.” The man agreed.

“It is not worth caring about a bun that is willing to inflict so much pain and distress. Suffering for unworthy people and things, now that’s foolish.” Li Qiye said softly.

“True.” The man said quietly.

“So this isn’t the most agonizing experience since logically, it shouldn’t affect someone that much.” Li Qiye concluded.
