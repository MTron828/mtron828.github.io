Chapter 1201: Archdevil Armored Shark

Vicious and domineering — these were the two words that people found most appropriate to describe this human boy. Some were truly shaken and couldn’t calm down after this spectacle.

This was a blatant challenge to the Teeming Tribe. Just how overbearing was this? Not to mention a single cultivator, even a lineage wouldn’t dare to do this.

But now, the human youth named Li Qiye had killed tens of thousands of soldiers of the Teeming Marquis. Moreover, he even ate the marquis’ tendon in front of the crowd. This was too much to take in.

“Is he a Virtuous Paragon?” A cultivator calmed down and shuddered: “Even if he isn’t a paragon, he must be a Heaven’s Equal King.” [1. Top level of Heavenly King.]

Li Qiye’s eyes went back to the needlefish from earlier. It was not bothered at all and continued to eat the insect powder on the ground as if it hadn’t eaten for thousands of years.

Li Qiye didn’t bother its meal and only quietly watched on. He eventually smiled when this fish swam to the trap he laid out earlier.

“Whoosh!” He immediately took action. A bunch of hooks connected to long strings emerged from the seabed.

These fish hooks shot out with tremendous speed. Not to mention these needlefish, even a powerful expert would have a difficult time evading them. However, this particular fish easily dodged them and maneuvered its way out from the trap with incomparable agility.

As the fish made its way out from the trap, these failed hooks quickly came together to form a huge net.

This was the so-called immeasurable net of justice that the needlefish was trying to escape. With a buzz, space was sealed and the net engulfed the fish. [2. A widely-used idiom that is hard to duplicate here. Popularized by Justice Bao.]

It then disappeared and turned into two reins. Each of the reins hooked onto the feelers on the fish’s cheeks while the ends of the reins were in Li Qiye’s hands.

“You won’t escape that easily.” He held the reins with both hands and grinned.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!” This fish crazily pulled the reins into the Bottomless Trench!

The impossible happened; this tiny fish actually dragged Li Qiye towards the trench. His body slammed and shattered a lot of coral.

This violent scene attracted the attention of the many cultivators who were trying to catch the fish.

“Show yourself!” Li Qiye cried out and channeled a universal law into his reins.

“Clank!” The reins locked onto the feelers of the fish and turned into numerous runes. All of these runes began to rotate as the reins disappeared. Only two great laws were left, acting as huge chains that hooked onto the fish’s cheeks.

The little fish emitted a blinding light while being suppressed by the two laws. An ancient totem emerged along with a temporal portal. Something rushed out from this portal, seemingly coming from the past to the present.

When the blinding light disappeared, the needlefish was no longer there. Instead, a gigantic shark appeared before everyone. It had an archaic appearance; its skin was gray and its entire body was equipped with pieces of armor protecting its vital areas.

Its gaping mouth revealed teeth as sharp as blades. The glints reflecting from them caused people to tremble uncontrollably.

The shark emitted a terrifying aura like that of an awakening primal beast. All the cultivators were frightened by its presence as their legs quivered.

Many cultivators forgot about their current task of catching needlefish and murmured in a daze: “What is that?”

“Archdevil Armored Shark...” Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen were shocked as well. If this shark was able to break the chains, it would meet god, kill god; meet devil, kill devil.

Despite being a disciple of the Void Imperfection School, Ye Tu had only heard of its name and had never seen it before. Meanwhile, the more knowledgeable Teng Jiwen felt a chill inside after seeing the legendary beast. Being able to find such a mythical creature was due to Li Qiye, just how frightening were his abilities?

The other cultivators here weren’t aware of these facts. They were surprised to see the shark but didn’t know its origin.

The shark grew tame after being suppressed by the universal laws. Li Qiye then controlled it and jumped on its back. He stood on the beast in a gallant manner. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Fellow Daoist, you are quite lucky to obtain a pet like this.” At this time, Gongsun Qianer and her followers came over while looking at Li Qiye.

Of course, she didn’t know what it was and only assumed that it was a typical sea shark.

Li Qiye only coldly glanced at her without bothering to reply.

She was once again enraged by this arrogant attitude. She was a trusted assistant back at the Profound Sea Dynasty, someone who could do whatever she wanted. Few juniors dared to act like this in front of her.

They had a minor conflict prior to this, but now, her murderous intent was incited. However, she restrained herself due to this giant shark.

“Fellow Daoist, how about we make a deal?” She smiled and asked him with an easy-mannered look: “I want to buy this shark, you can name a price.”

“Not for sale.” Li Qiye had no interest in this transaction with the girl and slowly pulled the two laws back by wrapping them around his palms.

“Fellow Daoist, don’t be so quick to refuse.” She assumed a sincere appearance and pressed on: “My lord is the divine queen of the Profound Sea Dynasty and has a love for rare pets. If you are willing to give up this shark, your future will be quite promising and...”

Despite her sincere speech, there was arrogance hidden among the words. She was implying that it was her master who wanted the shark.

The Profound God-Monarch’s concubine, Gongsun Meiyu, liked collecting precious aquatic creatures. Thus, Gongsun Qianer had an idea after seeing this shark: if she were to offer it to her master, she would be loved and held in even higher esteem.

Of course, she didn’t know the shark’s origin. In her eyes, this was at best only a rare and precious pet.

“Not interested.” He interrupted her and pulled on the laws to change the direction of the shark.

This lack of sensibility from Li Qiye made her eyes turn cold. She attacked without any hesitation the moment he turned around.

A purple light flashed. In this split second, she performed her sneak attack with her phoenix hairpin. The hairpin shot out with incomparable speed in an attempt to kill. It was too fast, everyone could only see a purple glint aiming for Li Qiye’s nape.

“Careful!” Both Ye Tu and Teng Jiwen shouted after seeing the sudden sneak attack without any warning. It was too late even if they wanted to help.

In this split second, time seemed to stop with the hairpin that flew towards his neck. It turned out that Li Qiye easily caught it with two fingers.

Gongsun Qianer was aghast to see her most important life-protecting weapon stopped and quickly tried to recall it. However, it was trapped by Li Qiye’s fingers and wouldn’t budge, so her summoning was useless.

“Die.” A cold glint flashed across Li Qiye’s eyes, a glint that cut straight to the heart.

“My master is the divine queen!” She knew that the situation wasn’t favorable and screamed out in order to use her backing. However, she had yet to finish speaking when the sound of something being pierced came about. The hairpin had instantly shot through her skull. A bloody hole appeared as a string of blood began to flow.

Her eyes were still wide open as her body slowly fell down. Not even in her wildest dreams did she expect someone would actually dare to kill her!

“Junior!” Her followers regained their sanity and shouted at the same time before lunging at Li Qiye.

“Rawrr!” The shark cried out. With a popping sound, it swallowed all of these followers in one gulp.

The coral forest went quiet right away. All of the cultivators here felt pressured and glanced at each other. Not long before this, Li Qiye was massacring the Teeming Sea Tribe. Now, he even killed Gongsun Qianer!

This was not only offending the Teeming Tribe but also the four branches of Gu Chun. What a domineering and arrogant showing!

Dao Attendant Lin and Yan Yanglong were astonished as well. This was doubly true for the attendant. His heart felt cold since he didn’t expect this human junior to be so powerful!
