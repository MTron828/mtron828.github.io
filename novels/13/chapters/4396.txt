Chapter 4397: Easy Dismantlement

Jaws dropped to the ground after the fact.

“Thi-this can’t be…” One disciple from Dragon couldn’t believe his own eyes.

This was understandable because Celestial Tiger was a two-dao sovereign. His spear technique was impressive but it couldn’t injure Li Qiye at all. The guy easily seized the spear and turned the tides of the battle.

All of this happened quickly and easily as if he had handed his weapon over to Li Qiye.

Nonetheless, this was indeed the truth. Even the experts had a hard time believing it. They activated their heavenly gaze again in order to assess Li Qiye’s cultivation.

In their opinion, he couldn’t hide anything from their pulsing gaze.

“Impossible, he’s not strong enough…” Those from other sects also tried and came up with the same conclusion - Li Qiye could only be in the myriad-form realm at best.

There was an unreachable gap between myriad-form and myriad-dao. Moreover, Celestial Tiger was at the two-dao level, not just a new sovereign. A myriad-form cultivator beating a sovereign was virtually unheard of.

Celestial Tiger himself staggered backward while being covered in a cold sweat. He felt a bit dizzy because everything happened in an instant. Li Qiye’s action was too smooth and precise.

After all, he personally created the spear. The two of them had a connection so even a stronger foe shouldn’t be able to obtain it in this manner.

He wasn’t famous for no reason. He had defeated numerous disciples from Eastern Desolace before. Thus, he had ample abilities and battle experience. Alas, this foe truly frightened him.

He had used his heavenly gaze before and found Li Qiye to be weaker. This simply didn’t make any sense to him.

“You may have it back.” Li Qiye glanced at the spear and casually threw it forward. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Raa!” The dao bone was activated and released the dragon totem. It roared loudly with surging draconic energy. It seemed to be alive as it ravaged everything along the way.

Celestial Tiger gasped after seeing this. He knew the full extent of the spear’s power since he was its creator. Li Qiye was actually using the spear to its limit and this shook him to the core.

Moreover, the throw was rather casual as well. Li Qiye didn’t activate his power in the slightest. This was something even Celestial Tiger couldn’t do.

However, he didn’t have time to think and needed to defend himself.

“Activate!” He summoned a square shield to stop the incoming spear. It created countless peaks and allowed him to hide among them.

“Myriad Peak Aegis.” An expert from Dragon recognized it.

This was a famous defensive treasure from Tiger Pond. It has been passed down from one cultivator to another and gave off the impression of being impregnable.

The crowd had more confidence in the shield being able to stop the spear than otherwise.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The dragon spear roared and pierced through several peaks without a problem. The thick layers couldn’t even slow the spear down.

The crowd took a deep breath after seeing this. The spear seemed to have tapped into its hidden potential.

“Boom!” The last explosion hurt the listeners’ eardrums, stemming from the spear piercing the final peak.

Nonetheless, the shield successfully absorbed the power of the throw. The tip of the spear stopped after it pierced through Celestial Tiger’s robe and touched his flesh. He turned pale since he could feel the coldness of steel.

He felt completely overwhelmed and confused. How could his spear break through the aegis? Though he was a genius, it was a great treasure far superior to his own creation.

Today, the shield seemingly showed its true value. Alas, it wasn’t because of him. At the same time, he nearly died to his own creation as well. This was far from ideal.

Of course, spectators were speechless and stunned. Not to mention disciples from Dragon, many outsiders could tell that the aegis was superior. How did the spear manage to break through?

“How did he do it?” One disciple asked.

“Celestial Tiger himself couldn’t break that aegis.” An outsider took a deep breath.

“There has to be something else going on, it’s sorcerous.” One senior sister trembled.

“Li Qiye might have an artifact capable of boosting all of his techniques by thousands of times.” One expert speculated.

Those nearby found this explanation to be reasonable.
