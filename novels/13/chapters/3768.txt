Chapter 3769: One Move

The lance and the explosive ten suns heralded the end of the world. They engulfed the entire area and made the crowd tremble with fear.

Ten suns were certainly enough to be apocalyptic. Everyone felt tiny and helpless during this crucial moment.

“Bam!” The suns finally hit the fiery shield.

The latter had unbelievable thickness due to the multiple layers. Alas, this still couldn’t stop the ten suns.

The shield crumbled to fiery pieces and sparks. The crowd couldn’t believe it - this was enough power to sink the earth.

The ten suns continued pressing down on the wall after the swift dispatch of the shield.

“Boom!” The impact made it difficult to stand straight. Some actually fell to the ground while screaming in horror.

They had no doubt that the wall would fall too. However, once they actually looked, the wall of the fortress managed to stop it.

It was quaking continuously but it was still a successful stop, separating the world into two halves.

“Yeah!” The youths cheered loudly and raised their fists, turning red from excitement.

This was fleeting. The suns couldn’t smash the wall down with force so they released endless sunfire in the shape of a white tiger.

The beast was monstrous with a tail longer than a mountain range. Its terrible aura and roar swept through the area like a tempest and blew the spectators away.

However, the wall still managed to stop the roar. The white tiger then leaped forward and raised its front claws, treating them like sharp divine swords. They were golden and brimming with dao lord power.

“Power refined by a dao lord.” Some spectators could tell.

“Boom!” The claws left deep marks. This wall managed to stop the ten suns, just not the sharp claws of this dao lord’s power manifestation.

“Rumble!” Sections were ripped apart along with the pillars above.

“Ahhh!” Soldiers on the platform screamed as they were sent flying. Some were killed; others grievously injured.

Eventually, once enough pillars shattered, the divine wall disintegrated as well.

People watched in astonishment. The scion only needed one move to defeat Smoke-fire Fortress and Vigorous Tiger Legion. He had once again proven his supremacy.

He floated in the air and held the great lance. He didn’t need an oppressive aura to intimidate the crowd.

They all thought of one title while looking at him - the god of war! He seemed to be possessed by a god and was completely unstoppable.

“How can we stop him?” One genius from the holy ground turned pale.

Not long ago, some thought that the four geniuses had a chance. Now, this confidence was nowhere to be found.

“Is he really unbeatable?” Another said with empty eyes.

“Too powerful, he’s unmatched among the young generation.” One ancestor concluded. His peers agreed as well, at least when it came to the southern West King.

Smoke-fire Fortress has lasted numerous wars without falling. Now, it became a stepping stone for the scion.

One ancestor at the sovereign level thought that he would have been seriously injured by Ten-sun Grasp and the lance as well.

As for Hu Ben, he had plenty of experience, being a commander for Vajra. He saw numerous powerful cultivators before as well. Nonetheless, his confidence wavered before the scion.

He wasn’t feeling despair but still knew that he was no match for the scion. No one from the young generation could do so.

“Still lacking.” The scion said after fully convincing the crowd through action. He looked around and smiled: “If this is the last ace card of the fortress, it’ll be very disappointing. It doesn’t live up to being a famous stronghold of Vajra.”

He could say whatever he wanted at this point without seeming arrogant. The crowd had no choice but to swallow their anger.

“Fellow Daoist Hu Ben, do you still wish to continue?” He pointed his lance at Hu Ben.

All eyes were on the latter. They didn’t know if he had anything else up his sleeve. In fact, no one would make fun of him for giving up now.

They saw him trying his best. He wasn’t weak; his opponent was just too strong.

Hu Ben’s expression changed continuously. He eventually gritted his teeth and said: “Our fortress will take on another move from you.”

“Oh? I can’t wait to see.” The scion spoke with confidence.

“There’s still something else?” The spectators became interested again, especially the youths.

“Activate the main vein!” Hu Ben made up his mind and ordered.

The older soldiers outside of the fortress exchanged glances. They eventually nodded in agreement. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Rumble!” They formed hand seals and fire engulfed them. They looked like fiery tornadoes but instead of ravaging the sky, they actually drilled into the ground - creating scorched pits in the process.
