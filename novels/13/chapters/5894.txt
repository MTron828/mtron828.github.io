Chapter 5894: From Dust To Dust, Rest In Peace

“Just run!” Twilight shouted with his few remaining breaths.

The exploded darkness gathered again into the giant form.

“Oooo-” He was furious to see his brother on the verge of death. He grew larger and seemingly reached the next realm, opening the gate to the high heaven.

“Crackle!” Tribulation bolts descended from the gate, initiating a purification.

“A heavenly tribulation!” Emperors shouted in astonishment.

As the bolts landed on the giant, he somehow became resplendent with a pure dark affinity. Darkness was never dazzling yet it illuminated the world just like the ultimate light.

“The apex of darkness, the source of light.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but exclaim: “Such purity exceeds the limit of the dark affinity, your old man never made it this far.”

The lightning bolts’ destruction didn’t deter or destroy him. On the contrary, he grabbed the bolts and turned them into a lightning spear, throwing them at Li Qiye.

“Boom!” It had enough force to piece an epoch, scaring the hell out of the emperors.

“What a shame.” Li Qiye was amazed by the potential of the dark being while stopping the spear with his primordial light. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At the same time, the dark being became empowered by the lightning bolts. Nine layers of heaven appeared behind him.

“Raa!” He gathered them into his fist for another punch.

“The high heaven!” Emperors knew this had enough firepower to take down the epoch.

“Boom!” Li Qiye met it directly to prevent further damage to his world, being pushed downward by the fist.

“You have reached a monstrous level with this punch. Alas...” Li Qiye praised the being before utilizing his primordial power. He became eternal and loomed over the high heaven, causing the dark being to explode again.

“Time to finish this.” His activated state could make the mightiest cultivators tremble in fear.

His primordial light coiled around the dark being and initiated a suppression. The giant became increasingly small, slowly turning into worldly essences.

“Ra!” It let out one last cry while gazing at Twilight Hunter.

“No...” Twilight couldn’t do anything to stop it.

Eventually, the refinement process was completed and a heavenly rain under Li Qiye’s control poured down to all realms.

“The ultimate purity, no wonder why the old man wanted to devour him.” Li Qiye sighed.

“Ahhh!” At this point, Li Qiye had drained Twilight of his power. His dark true blood flowed around him.

Once Li Qiye released the process, only a bag of skin was left.

“From dust to dust, rest in peace now.” He used his light to refine everything.

“So this is the source of the heavenly rains.” The strongest cultivators in Eight Desolaces witnessed this scene through the broken dimensional fabrics and understood what happened back then.

“Doomed to a tragic fate since birth.” Li Qiye said sentimentally before releasing Twilight Hunter’s essences to his epoch.

Stonesplitter and the emperors sympathized with the overlord since they had a general idea after listening to Li Qiye.

Twilight Hunter was born in a world of light. Alas, behind this light was an unfathomable and boundless darkness. He was destined to either join or be devoured by the abyss.

During his ignorance, he thought he could spread his light and protect the epoch along with his unfortunate twin.

Eventually, his father devoured the epoch and he could only hide, becoming a wandering hunter. He needed sustenance for both himself and his brother. His birth was the greatest moment of his life, it only went downhill from there.

They thought he wasn’t as despicable and evil as the other overlords, having managed his hunger and greed.

“So how do you want this to end, me or you?” Li Qiye turned his attention to the suppressed Trinity Ancestor.

“Do I have a choice?” Trinity and the mysterious visitor have accepted defeat at this point.

Li Qiye’s plan was carried out successfully - all the dark overlords have been wiped out in his epoch.

“No, it’s just more painful if I have to do it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Fine, then I will go with dignity. After all, I was a man who had embarked on a noble expedition.” Trinity laughed.

“Alright, go for it.” Li Qiye smiled and removed the dark spear.

“Hahaha, what a life.” Trinity glanced at the epoch and said: “It’s a pity, I was too arrogant to appreciate this world.”

“Boom!” His three rings floated upward and suddenly wrapped around him before exploding.

They rotated and acted as a grinding mill, reducing his body down to a liquid first and then worldly essences.

Eventually, the three rings crumbled and turned into essences as well. Li Qiye gently led them into High Heaven Aegis.

Stonesplitter became sentimental - the most gifted being of the epoch chose to commit suicide. Of course, this was a more dignified death than his peers.
