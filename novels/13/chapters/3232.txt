The storm finally arrived after a brief interlude.

“Rumble!” Three Immortals and the expanse suddenly trembled as if it was the end of days. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A tsunami capable of reaching the sky nearly smashed the stars down at the expanse. A giant seemed to be rending heaven and earth, wishing to tear the world in two.

“What’s going on?” The inhabitants panicked in confusion.

The stars rustled, on the verge of falling down if this kept up.

“Rumble!” One wave after another kept on smashing the sky, intending on drowning the high heaven.

The cataclysmic phenomena frightened everyone. They have to get on their knees and pray once more.

The masters and progenitors in the expanse, on the other hand, remained calm.

“What are they doing?” They could tell that this was a man-made event, not natural disasters.

Only the three immortals and Li Qiye could affect the world to this level. This piqued their curiosity.

“Are they actually doing this? It’s too dangerous.” A progenitor who knew the inside story had a good guess.

This knowledgeable group became frightened because, in the case of failure, all of Three Immortals would go down too.

“It’s starting.” Those in the redemption grounds were actually excited instead of being afraid.

They knew that this day would come when Li Qiye asked for their amazing resources back then.

“Perhaps success is possible.” One existence murmured in these secretive places.

Another seemed to disagree. It had a serious expression as it gazed into the sky, capable of peering through any world. It reached the deepest location above but didn’t see anything.

“I wonder if that person is still around or not.” One overlord mused.

The invincible progenitors couldn’t hear this quiet voice. However, the other overlords countless dimensions away heard it clearly.

That person - even the strongest overlords put on a serious expression after hearing these words.

They were confident in Li Qiye’s expedition but once this person was mentioned, they felt great pressure.

“It has been a long time since his last appearance. I don’t think anyone knows.” One overlord quietly said. [1]

Only those who knew about him understood how frightening he was. However, he had disappeared a long time ago. Nonetheless, these overlords knew that he was still alive.

After all, they were still alive. How could he die before them? It’s just that no one knew what he was doing right now.

The powerful existences back in the nine worlds and thirteen continents also felt the powerful ripples.

“It’s beginning.” One terrible being in a deep dimension started fleeing to safer pasture. He knew that this might be the start of another disaster.

“I hope changes will come from this.” A person with a profound gaze residing in a burial ground said.

They knew that a disaster would come from this battle along with a change in momentum regardless of the outcome.

“Crack! Crack!” Tearing sounds could be heard by all in Three Immortals and the expanse.

“Look, the sky is cracking!” One person shouted.

All looked up and sure enough, a crack appeared on the sky vault, looking just like a star.

Everyone felt as if there was an invisible barrier up there being forcefully torn apart.

“Crack!” The tearing continued. The sky would be split in two if this continued.

“That’s...” The top masters in the expanse took a deep breath. That was a world barrier being torn apart - something they definitely couldn’t do.

“They want to enter a different world?” They realized what the four were up to right away.

“Can they do it?” The widening crack left them in fear, afraid for the worst.

Meanwhile, regular people back in Three Immortals thought that the sky was breaking down. Despite a lack of information, they instinctively trembled. Their survival instinct told them that this was definitely bad.

“Crack!!!” The sound intensified and could be heard everywhere.

The greatest existences watched with bated breath, especially those in the redemption ground.

“Boom!” Darkness suddenly oozed into the crack with the force of a primal flood, engulfing the world.

This was a monstrous existence from the other side wanting to invade Three Immortals.

The dark affinity naturally scared everyone out of their wits. They felt darkness entering them in the blink of an eye.

“Shit!” The top masters immediately fled with haste, afraid of a repeat of the past.

“Boom!” However, this invasion was interrupted by an immortal light - a supreme technique capable of affecting everything.

All felt feeble and insignificant in comparison. The power instantly repelled the mighty darkness, pushing it back to its own world while not damaging Three Immortals in the slightest.

The crack in the sky was illuminated by this immortal light. Inside this bright expanse was a wondrous figure - Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” He flew towards the crack, wanting to reach the world on the other side.

“So fierce.” The top masters were amazed at Li Qiye’s invincibility.
