Chapter 5059: Agreement?

Goldcrest became a new founder god and took in all the worshippers of Bug. The new name became Kun.

Demons, especially those who were still alive from Bug, prostrated before his throne. If it wasn’t for Li Qiye, all of them would have become corpses.

The commanding gods also congratulated him while he stood there in a daze, thinking about how he was on the same level as mythical characters such as Vine God.

“Rooster, look at you now.” Ming Shi and Yunyun came over as well. Ming Shi couldn’t help but tease him: “Don’t forget about us now that you’re a big shot, we’ve been through so much together already.”

“Your Highness, please don’t make fun of me, I’m not even sure if I can carry out my duty.” Goldcrest smiled wryly.

“I’m sure that if you try your best, you won’t be letting the young noble down.” Yunyun smiled.

What else could Goldcrest do at this point but follow the flow? The decision wasn’t up to him.

Today, many changes occurred in Demon but mostly for the better. Someone as crazy as Golden Mosquito was always a threat. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Though they lost two commanding gods, they also gained two new ones. The mood became better afterward since the storm was over.

Alas, this was interrupted by a chilling aura. Each stand could pierce the soul and leave behind an indelible mark.

It headed east and could be sensed by everyone in Demon regardless of whether they were underground or up high in the sky.

“Rumble!” Many couldn’t handle this pressure and dropped to the ground.

“A conqueror…” Powerful demon monarchs knew the cultivation realm of this intruder instantly.

This was a special conqueror as well. Alas, despite the chilling aura, no one caught a glimpse of the conqueror.

It seemed that it only took one step for this being to traverse the massive territories of Demon.

Vine God and the other commanding gods stood up after sensing this.

“Conceal Conqueror.” They recognized her right away.

She stood on top of a branch and was virtually undetectable. Staring at her meant becoming frozen since time came to a halt.

It only took her one step to arrive at Demon. She still had a veil hiding her face but no one doubted her unmatched qualities.

She has been out of the public’s eyes ever since her fight with Eight-stallion Dao Lord. Thus, her appearance was a big deal. Everything became silent; even a leaf touching the ground could be heard.

“She’s even stronger than before.” A dragon lord shuddered after seeing her.

He was there during the fight and took note of her murderous rampant intent. This sheer affinity alone made her unbeatable. However, it seemed far more subdued this time.

Most would actually think that she was weaker now due to a shift in her aura. Alas, the dragon lords and ancient ancestors could tell that she had gained heightened mastery over her murderous intent.

They also knew that she was wounded after that fight. However, she only became stronger afterward. She was a living legend in the lower continents and this was the case for a reason.

The commanding gods saw her and were preparing for a fight. Of course, they weren’t that confident in winning.

Why did she come? To avenge the fallen members of Deity and especially Radiant Monarch? This would be the logical answer.

“Conqueror, you have an existing agreement with Mist.” Nightwalker bowed slightly and reminded her.

This surprised everyone since they didn’t know about her relationship with Mist.

“I will not fight in Demon.” Her voice was pleasant yet authoritative.

Listeners speculated that part of the agreement included her not fighting in Demon.

“Didn’t she come here in the past and killed six dragon monarchs from Poison Dragon?” One dragon lord found this rather strange.

She had massacred an evil sect from Demon before when she was just sixteen. Numerous demons fell to her then so what was the reason for her holding back this time?
