Chapter 4997: Who Do You Think You Are?

“This is your last chance to show what you got.” Li Qiye added.

The crowd no longer commented on his arrogance after witnessing his power. Smashing the ultimate technique of a dragon lord that easily? He had earned the right to bluster.

“Fellow Daoist, please show mercy and the monarch shall drop the feud henceforth as well.” Golden Cicada said, wanting to save a life.

“Who do you think you are?” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

Golden Cicada couldn’t respond because normally, he had enough prestige to influence others. He was from the same generation as the current commanding god of Bug - Bloodfly God. Of course, he couldn’t force the issue.

“Hahaha, Brother Cicada, it is fine. One of us will die today because I must avenge my son.” Halo Monarch laughed.

“Your lineage has a heavenly scripture, show it to me before death.” Li Qiye gestured provocatively.

“Good!” Halo Monarch took one step forward and suddenly became immeasurably heavy, causing the ground to shake.

It couldn’t withstand his new weight. However, instead of his power erupting outwardly, it was gathering within.

The five fruits intersected and created a domain. They blossomed for a moment before fusing together into one.

“Heaven Wheel!” He roared.

The single form of the fruit emitted a pulse carrying the destruction of a million stars. Though Demon was vast, every corner of the land felt its crushing intensity. Living creatures in Demon became overwhelmed with fear.

The pulse channeled into the form of a heavenly halo. It was outrageously large and made Demon look like a single hill in comparison. It reached space and crushed one star after another.

As everyone looked up, they felt as if there was another world above. Even colossal demons seemed as tiny as specks of dust.

“This is the heavenly wheel?” Jun Cuican couldn’t help but be lost in admiration despite his pride and arrogance.

This was one of the two wheels from a heavenly scripture - Heaven. 

“My son, watch me avenge you! Die!” Halo Monarch bellowed and commanded the wheel to descend.

Before its physical arrival, its dao engulfed Li Qiye and prevented him from running. Meanwhile, spectators immediately fled, not wanting to be anywhere near the target.

“Rumble!” Demon faced a crisis with hundreds of peaks crumbling down.

“Damn!” Goldcrest was horrified since even a dragon lord like him could be reduced to nothingness.

“Will he be able to stop it?” Some demon monarchs stopped at a safe distance and discussed the situation.

The same couldn’t be said about weaker beasts and demons who were subjugated by the wheel.

“Boom!” It finally slammed against Li Qiye.

Keep in mind that even a kingdom was only a tiny dinner plate in comparison, let alone a single person. He was countless times tinier than the leg of a mosquito.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Nonetheless, this tiny being managed to stop the wheel with just one hand. It was as if he was upholding three thousand worlds contained in the attack.

Halo roared and channeled all of his fruits’ energy and dao power into the wheel. Unfortunately, it still didn’t move another inch.

“The heavenly scripture is strong but you have only learned the very basics.” Li Qiye smiled before closing his fingers.

“Boom!” The wheel twisted together like fried dough from the force before exploding.

“Ahh!” Halo was sent flying from the backlash, completely covered in blood.
