Chapter 4621: Who Else But Me?

“That’s the qualities of someone from a prestigious sect. Such wisdom at an early age, he will become someone great.” A high elder praised.

“True.” A sect master nodded in agreement: “Even if he won’t succeed the valley, he’ll still be a commendable lord of a region.”Divine Dragon Valley reigned over hundreds of sects and kingdoms. The most likely successor was none other than Tian Feng, a potential dao lord.

Given his current talent and power, the majority of his ancestors supported him to be the next leader of Divine Dragon. In reality, the official succession wasn’t far away.

Jadedragon Monarch should be proud of his own abilities and achievements. He was only slightly inferior to the five conquerors.

For example, Voidburn Godchild was a famous cultivator but still couldn’t compete with Jadedragon Monarch. Alas, the conquerors were just on another level.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When people talked about Divine Dragon Valley, they couldn’t help talking about Tian Feng. This didn’t mean that Jadedragon Monarch was incapable.

Since the crowd has spoken, this left the first elder of Voidburn in a tough situation. He wanted to avenge their godchild in order to answer to his sect. Alas, doing so would invoke the scorn of everyone here, damaging both his and the sect’s reputation.

“I would have no grievance if it was an even fight. However, you have cheated to kill our godchild, this is an unforgivable offense.” The first elder threatened.

“We cheated? Who was the first to use the Skyburn Flame to empower your godchild? How shameless.” Jian Ming retorted.

“You!” The first elder turned red with no response.

“He’s right, you were the first to interfere.” An expert in the crowd said: “Then they get to do it too. You broke the rule first.”

“At least lose gracefully, you’re ruining Voidburn Court’s reputation.” Others chimed in since they weren’t afraid of this sect.

“First Elder, the fight was indeed fair earlier.” Jadedragon Monarch nodded: “To dwell on this disparages Voidburn and Divine Dragon Valley’s reputation.”

The crowd was silenced after hearing this. They stared at the first elder, awaiting a decision. It was better not to comment now that Divine Dragon Valley was dragged into the mess.

The first elder’s expression soured. He wasn’t in a position to go against the monarch. Moreover, due to their alliance, Divine Dragon Valley’s reputation could be hurt as well.

“Fine.” He swallowed this anger and went with the flow. He then utterly coldly at Jian Ming: “I will remember what happened here today. Come to Voidburn if you dare in the future, this isn’t over yet.”

He needed to have the cool last words before leaving or it would be too pathetic.

“I’m so scared.” Jian Ming said this but his appearance was anything but.

The first elder scowled once and then left the battlefield.

“Young Noble Jian, your sword technique earlier was enlightening.” Ye Tingrong sincerely praised.

“It’s no big deal, it’s no big deal.” He smiled awkwardly instead of bragging about his skills.

“Brat, where is this sword art from? Also, what is this bloodline?” The daoist became curious.

“Don’t you know everything?” Jian Ming said proudly: “I dare you to read my fortune.”

His attitude toward the daoist was a stark contrast to how he responded to Ye Tingrong.

“You’re not worth it.” The daoist didn’t give him any face.

These two have always quarreled and Jian Ming never gave a damn regardless of what the daoist said. However, it was different in Ye Tingrong’s presence.

“Let’s go inside.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Times are different now, just about any random can come and propose a marriage alliance. Even if they want the treasure, they need to take a look in the mirror first before embarrassing themselves.”

This casual yet loud comment offended everyone but Jian Ming clapped and added: “You’re completely right, Young Noble. Randoms don’t know their place anymore.”

He fanned the fire and infuriated everyone. The latter was about to leave since the battle was over but now, they had a new enemy.

“Brat, what did you say?” One genius glared at them.

“Was I not being clear enough? You all are not worthy of the treasure.” Li Qiye calmly responded.

The crowd was furious, wanting to stomp him down.

“Trouble comes from the mouth, watch it.” Someone else uttered menacingly.

“Join the long line of those who want to kill me, I don’t mind.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hah, you speak as if you’re the only one worthy of the treasure.” A saint child sneered.

“Yes, who else but me?” Li Qiye replied.

“Ignorant fool, True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao are here too. They can obliterate you.” A genius angrily said.

“I would like to see them try.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

The atmosphere became silent again after this declaration.
