Chapter 5559: Sacred Teacher, Save Me

“Sacred Teacher, I am out of time.” The golden skeleton said anxiously: “This power is reverting me to the origin, the dead under heaven will be reborn with me.”

“What’s the rush, the young master can cleanse this evil at any moment.” Niu Fen smiled.

“So be it, that’s why we are here at the same place. Get ready, this will hurt.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s fine.” The skeleton took a deep breath and arched its chest forward.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye’s hand became engulfed in primordial light as he thrust it into the skeleton’s chest.

“Ahh!” The latter groaned loudly due to the unbearable agony.

“Pop!” Li Qiye forcefully grabbed the gray heart, wanting to pull it out.

“Ahhh!” The screaming intensified as the skeleton gritted its teeth and nearly fell to the ground, wanting to roll around to alleviate the pain.

The heart exuded gray strands that wrap around the skeleton’s ribs, not wanting to be severed. The gray flesh that was growing also latched onto the heart.

“Endure!” Li Qiye raised his voice and began the extracting process, forcing the strands to coil around his fingers.

“Ugh…” The gray strands had entrenched themselves into his bones and flesh. Pulling this was akin to being dissected by a knife.

“Pop!” Eventually, Li Qiye finished removing the heart and the infected flesh. The golden skeleton dropped to the ground and heaved a sigh of relief.

The extracted pieces released gray strands that coiled around Li Qiye’s hand, wanting to grow on it instead.

“What the hell is this thing?” Niu Fen and the others were creeped out while looking at the tentacle-like creature.

“Seal.” Li Qiye used a special law to immobilize everything before burning them with his dao flame. They pulsed brightly but couldn’t even explode due to the unbreakable seal.

Unlike the previous cases, one thing was left behind after the immolation - a drop of blood. However, there was a tiny gray thing squirming within it.

Li Qiye didn’t show any mercy and utilized his primordial light to burn everything inside the drop of blood. It resembled a flawless ruby after the complete removal.

Putting aside its wondrous exterior, it contained the purest power from the essence of the dao and a flashing primordial light. If other cultivators were to see this, they might call it the blood of an immortal.

“It smells nice.” Niu Fen took a deep breath and salivated: “I bet this is so nutritious, years and years of life.”

“Thank you for your assistance, Sacred Teacher.” The golden skeleton got up and started growing larger.

The golden bones gradually turned white. Flesh grew next and he transformed into a handsome youth with an incredible divinity, seemingly one with heaven and earth.

“Please, you had a perfectly good golden skeleton yet you chose to turn into this mundane sack of meat, how vulgar. Your previous frame was far more pleasing to the eyes.” Niu Fen said with disdain.

“I am a deity of this world so I should align with its inhabitants.” The youth responded with confidence.

“Look at your temples, you don’t look like this, stop trying to make yourself look better.” Niu Fen said.

“The world hasn’t seen my true form, that’s just a depiction.” The youth smiled.

“Deity of Cleansing?” Baifeng wasn’t confident but remained calm.

Guo Cheng, on the other hand, became overwhelmed with emotion. He could be looking at a deity right now.

“Indeed.” The youth revealed a gentle, dashing smile.

“Don’t be fooled by this handsome appearance.” Niu Fen exposed his old stories: “His skeleton back in Eight Desolaces was extremely unsightly. Thirteenth left countless holes and wounds on him.”

The youth was none other than Bones Dao Lord, one of the two Deities of Cleansing. Different accounts were passed down regarding his fate after the battle with Thirteenth.

“Sacred Teacher, I almost didn’t make it. Thank you.” Bones ignored Niu Fen and bowed toward Li Qiye.

“It is fate, I took your item back then and here I am, saving your life.” Li Qiye smiled.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“That’s perfect.” Bones appreciated the workings of fate and bowed again.

Li Qiye chuckled and glanced at the drop of blood in his hand.
