Chapter 5386: Who Caught The Cicada?

Due to the Pact of Blessed, only minor skirmishes between individuals occurred recently. The top cultivators had an implicit understanding of the political balance.

Members from both sides conversed and befriended each other, lowering the racial hatred and prejudice. The last several hundred thousand years were peaceful - a time of healing.

Due to the number of conquerors and dao lords involved in today’s battle, it seemed that the pact was finally abandoned. War could break out at any moment. None could remain neutral or they would risk offending their own side.

“Illumination is a criminal hurting The People.” A dao lord said with certainty: “He is no longer the same as before, the path he treads on will bring us toward damnation.”

“Conflicts will not cease as long as he is still around.” Another conqueror from The People agreed.

He once protected The People but now, he has become the source of all disasters.

“We need to be ready, we can’t only worry about ourselves.” A few sighed and prepared for the worst.

Right now, the conflict included Heaven, Divine, and Dao Alliance. It wouldn’t be long until Imperial Alliance was dragged into it as well.

“What a shame, she almost made it.” Ferocity said with a tinge of regret after seeing Ye Fantian captured by All-things Dao Lord.

“Not necessarily, this is only the beginning of the plan.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Just the beginning? I don’t think Ye Fantian will survive this.” Xiao Hu didn’t understand.

“You think All-things Dao Lord will kill her?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmm…” Xiao Hu thought about it and realized that if All-things had wanted to kill Ye Fantian, he would have done so from the start.

“Why did he capture her?” Xiao Hu asked.

“She is still the bait, and she knows this.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I got it!” Ferocity clapped and said: “All-things wants to use her to bait Swordsea Dao Lord.”

“I believe he’s trying to bait Illumination, not Swordsea.” Li Xian’er chimed in.

“For sure.” Ferocity agreed: “Ye Fantian’s very existence is a stain on Illumination’s reputation. They lost so many dao lords and conquerors only to fail. He must kill her in order to wipe away this shameful defeat.”

“So she wanted to be captured?” Xiao Hu murmured.

“If Illumination wants to kill Ye Fantian, he must deal with All-things first. Well, this would have happened either way since he wants Dao Alliance back. The girl knew this and aimed to spark the conflict between them, The People will start fighting each other then.” Ferocity said.

“You don’t think All-things knows this?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“He wants to take this opportunity to eliminate Illumination as well.” Xiao Hu blurted out.

All-things’ biggest threat right now was not Supreme but rather, Illumination. His goal didn’t matter, whether it be to stay as the leader of Dao Alliance or to maintain the current balance for the sake of peace. Illumination was the biggest obstacle.

Of course, Illumination shared the same idea - dealing with All-things first before focusing on Supreme.

Although Illumination’s prestige waned in recent times, he was still respected by a large number of cultivators. It would be improper for All-things to launch an assault against him.

On the other hand, what if Illumination were the first to attack? Then All-things would be justified in defending himself.

Ultimately, Ye Fantian served as a way for these two apex cultivators to fight each other without risking negative opinions.

She knew that they both wanted this and played along. After all, it would seriously weaken Dao Alliance either way.

“The girl is amazing, she has it all.” Ferocity had nothing but respect for Ye Fantian. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Young Noble, what is your opinion on this matter?” Li Xian’er asked.

“Nothing, this is inconsequential because The Race and The People are just the same. Sure, the three grand races were arrogant and believed in their superiority, but the distinction started with Celestial Court. That’s the real culprit here.” Li Qiye said.

“Right. The Race and The People aren’t separate races, both sides have humans and heaveners or whatever.” Xiao Hu agreed.

“What should we do then, Young Noble?” Li Xian’er asked.

“In terms of the upper continents alone, it will calm down after the death of Illumination and Supreme.” Li Qiye said before turning to the sky: “However, as long as Celestial Court is still around, the notion of sinners and racial prejudice will remain. The permanent solution is its destruction.”

“!” The group became emotional since they weren’t strong enough to challenge Celestial Court.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye smiled and started walking.
