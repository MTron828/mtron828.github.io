Chapter 5185: The Culprit?

Dereliction of duty was a serious offense, especially due to the importance of this particular garden. Their Senior Sister might not be able to shield them from consequences.

“We were here the entire time.” Another lowered their head.

“Then how did a fire start so many times?” The monarch took a look at the scene and said: “This is done by a true flame, it’s arson.”

This startled them even more.

“If it’s arson, then who did it? How did we not catch the culprit?” The saint child stared coldly at them.

Though he couldn’t do anything to the saintess, he could still take down her group and deal an indirect blow.

The monarch also stared at them, causing them to tremble in fear. They hurriedly reported: “Ancestor, we did not take half a step away from the garden, but we didn’t see anyone either.”

“The garden doesn’t burn on its own.” The saint child said: “Could it be that someone among your group had either stolen or lost a plant so in order to cover it up, they started burning randomly.”

The serious accusation frightened the group. They got on their knees and said: “Ancestor, Senior Sister, we have always obeyed the sect’s rules and wouldn’t do something like this. Please investigate!”

“Is there any other reason for this to re-occur several times? Losing a few plants, might as well burn it all up.” The saint child pressed on.

“Senior Brother, enough of accusation void of any evidence.” She coldly uttered.

“Junior Sister, you are responsible for this as well since you are in charge here.” He didn’t hold back.

The saintess glanced at her followers and then respectfully told the monarch: “Junior Uncle, I can guarantee that they are neither thieves nor arsonists.”

“Thank you, Senior Sister, thank you!” The group bowed and expressed their gratitude. They needed her assurance in order to survive any inquisition from the ancestors. At that point, even sect banishment would be the light punishment.

“Hmm…” The monarch couldn’t find any clue after observing the garden.

“This can’t just end here.” The saint child said: “If we can’t find the culprit, the same thing will occur again and the entire garden might be gone. Junior Sister, you won’t be able to bear the responsibility.”

“We will be more vigilant than ever.” One disciple said.

“Hmph, what if it happens again? Who will take responsibility?” The saint child said.

No one answered while the saintess frowned. In reality, she couldn’t come up with a reason why. There was nothing wrong with her agricultural skill so it had to be external.

“It’s not that hard finding the arsonist.” Li Qiye yawned before speaking up.

“Could you elaborate, Young Noble?” The dejected saintess’ face lit up after hearing this. Due to the tense situation prior, she had forgotten about him.

“The arsonist is here right now.” He said.

“In the garden?” The saint child looked around and said while staring at the saintess’ followers: “Indeed, it has to be one of them.”

“We didn’t do it!” Her followers were startled again.

“Who are you?” The monarch stared at Li Qiye and furrowed his brows.

“Junior Uncle, Young Noble Li saved my life twice back in Immortal’s Peak.” The saintess said.

“Since you claim that the arsonist is still here, who is it then?” The monarch asked. As an ancestor of Alchemy Dao, he was rather capable yet still couldn’t see any clue.

“Sigh, you all claim to be successors of alchemy, what are Alchemy Dao’s most amazing aspects?” Li Qiye asked.

“It’s obviously our two legendary pills, nothing can compare to them.” The saint child responded.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“An ignorant answer.” To which Li Qiye responded.

“You!” The saint child glared at him.

“Tell us then, which pills in the six continents are better than ours?” The monarch’s expression soured as well.

“Your founder was in love with alchemy. Her pill-making art is exceptional indeed but her greatest achievement in life is actually the dao of agriculture.” Li Qiye said: “Her pill refinement became more famous due to the wars.”

The monarch froze for a second before agreeing: “You are not wrong. I have read this in our historical scrolls.”

“Because you all didn’t focus on her true legacy, you can’t find the cuplrit.” Li Qiye said.

“What does that have to do with the arsonist?” The saint child said.

“If you had inherited her abilities and teachings, the answer would have been obvious.” He said.

“That’s a bold claim, I’m still waiting for you to reveal the answer.” The saint child uttered coldly.

“You don’t think I know?” Li Qiye asked.

“Reveal the answer and prove us wrong.” The saint child said.

“It is right before us.” Li Qiye said while staring at the saint child.

“Are you saying that I did it?” The latter’s expression darkened.

“No, I’m only disappointed in a potential successor of Alchemy Dao for not spotting this.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The saint child was furious: “You have insulted my sect and me several times now. Don’t think about leaving this place unscathed if you can’t find the culprit.”

“Oh? Is that a threat?” Li Qiye asked.

“Young Noble Li, what do you suggest we do to capture the culprit?” The monarch interrupted them.

“Very well, I will teach you the dao of alchemy today.” Li Qiye pointed at a plant in the center of the garden and ordered: “Dig it up.”

“What?!” Everyone couldn’t believe it because he was pointing at the largest and most precious plant in the garden.

It was a red cock’s comb looking like a soaring phoenix.

“We can’t! That’s Her Majesty’s phoenix crest!” One disciple shouted.

“The sect master needs it. Is this a joke?” The monarch’s expression changed.

Jadecure Conqueror was planning on using it as one ingredient for her next cauldron. The saintess herself came often to check on it.

Now, Li Qiye wanted to dig it up?
