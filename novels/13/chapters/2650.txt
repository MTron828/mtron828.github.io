“Boom!” The emperor took one step forward and crushed the void along with the laws in the world. Everything beneath his steps became ashes and insignificant.

The celestials were shaking with everything else. The world couldn’t handle his power. Just one remnant strand could take down all.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the land they were on would be crushed by a strand of his hair falling down.

He had unlimited vitality and invulnerability - a truly frightening state just like a progenitor.

People shuddered after seeing his slow yet destructive pace.

This was his peak form - something more than just the four of them added together. This peerless combination move made him look invincible.

“Who can stop his slash now?” The strongest Eternals present right now felt doubt.

The first person that popped up on everyone’s mind was the Everlasting named Solar Daoist, at least in Imperial Lineage.

“A True Emperor just has too much potential.” Another Eternal said enviously.

Among the four, the emperor was the youngest and also the weakest in terms of cultivation.

However, he became the primary force of this team. The rest could only aid him instead of directly going against Fiercest.

These were the advantages of being an emperor. His potential far outweighed even those stronger than him.

“Clank!” He pointed his Purecloud at Li Qiye. This alone was enough to make the crowd tremble. They felt as if their souls were being torn apart.

“One of us is going down today!” The emperor declared in a powerful manner, seemingly in charge of Li Qiye’s life.

“It’ll be you.” Li Qiye smiled, unperturbed by the emperor’s amazing form.

“Die!” The emperor didn’t waste words. His eyes turned fierce with murderous intent.

The world became dark as a result under his bloodthirst, wavering back and forth on the verge of destruction.

“So terrifying!” The crowd felt their legs giving in and got cold sweats all over.

“Clank!” He finally unleashed a slash.

It didn’t have the mysteries of the dao - only pure devastation!

Everyone could see gods and deities fall down before this slash; their blood splashing everywhere.

It didn’t have any technique variation and swift changes either yet death seemed to be certain. Everyone felt despair while watching the arc.

It was clearly aimed towards Li Qiye but they felt hopeless all the same. There was no point in resisting. In fact, they didn’t even have the courage to try and could only wait for decapitation just like a captured prisoner. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

They felt a chill running down their very soul. This slash has left a terrible trauma in their mind.

“Go.” Li Qiye casually responded.

“Rumble!” Countless stars over the horizon started shooting towards the slash, wanting to penetrate through the slash.

However, the emperor ignored the stars. His slash was still coming straight for Li Qiye.

The only thing on his mind was killing Li Qiye. This bloodthirst has become an obsession that could pierce through everything.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Everyone saw the stars exploding the moment they touched the emperor’s body.

Remember, each star had immensely destructive potential; each capable of destroying a kingdom or sect. They could have easily pierced through the earth.

Alas, they couldn’t force him to move even an inch. The three impregnable barriers surrounding him easily stopped the barrage of stars. They slammed into what seems to be the toughest wall in existence.

“Clank!” Meanwhile, the slash was still coming for Li Qiye, on the verge of decapitating him.

“Go!” Li Qiye swept his hand forward summoned a thunderstorm with descending lightning bolts.

“Rumble!” With the currents around him, he suddenly turned into a supreme thunder god.

He then ordered the tsunami of lightning bolts to stop the slash.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” The waves of lightning slammed into the firmaments and drowned out everything. They looked like numerous dragons leaving their lair. This force made the world resemble a tiny boat amidst a torrential storm.

“Clank!” The sword cut straight into the currents and quickly split it apart. It continued to head for Li Qiye who was in the center of this ocean, shrouded by lightning.

“Pluff!” It successfully broke through the currents and split Li Qiye into two halves.

This connection signaled the end of the world, rendering everything to ashes. The splattering of his blood would also extinguish the rest.

Everyone felt as if they were split into two just like Li Qiye as well. Their blood and viscera spewed out.
