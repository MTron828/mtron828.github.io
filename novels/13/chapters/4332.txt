Chapter 4333: Chi Jinlin

No one that wasn’t here in person would believe this story. The absurdity made jaws drop to the ground; this wouldn’t even happen in dreams.

Just a moment ago, they thought that he was about to be killed by the young lord of Dragon. Now, everything changed because of the heir’s appearance.

Li Qiye glanced at the bowing man in front of him and didn’t say anything.

Jinlin thought that Li Qiye didn’t remember him so he hurriedly said: “You stayed at my humble abode for a bit before.”

He was not the crown prince despite being the heir. Being the crown prince was not enough to become the next successor in Lion’s Roar.

Thus, the heir and the crown prince were two entirely different matters. In order to become the heir, one must be recognized by the kingdom on top of passing numerous tests from the royal clan and the temple. The only requirement was that this person must be from the royal clan.

Chi Jinlin was the son of the current king. However, his mother had a lowly background and no status. Nonetheless, he surpassed the trials and became the official heir of Lion’s Roar.

“You’ve improved quite a bit.” Li Qiye remembered him and smiled.

The listeners couldn’t believe it. They thought that despite the ridiculousness of the event, Li Qiye would take it back to normalcy by returning the gesture. However, he stunned them by answering so casually as if he was a senior of the heir.

“Sir, your guidance on that day helped me comprehend. I truly benefited from it.” Jinlin said.

As a member of the side branch, his path wasn’t smooth at all. He faced plenty of competition and contempt.

During his youth, his talent was high enough to be given top merit laws from the royal clan. He improved greatly and surpassed his fellow clan members.

Because of this, many seniors thought highly of him and that he had the potential to compete for the successor position. He didn’t let them down and won numerous competitions.

Just when everything was going perfectly, something happened to his grand dao and his cultivation stagnated completely regardless of his effort. The seniors, one by one, helped him to no avail.

Subsequently, his competitors surpassed him and he was no longer the best candidate. There were still some seniors who believed in him but their number gradually dwindled.

After numerous setbacks, he moved out of the capital and into an old city, hoping that the serenity would help.

Alas, this still didn’t work and he became dejected. It wasn’t until he met Li Qiye and received guidance that he found a way to break through.

Since he had been accumulating the entire time, this became an advantage. His cultivation caught up to his rivals in no time at all. Next, he passed the trials of the kingdom and the royal clan. Lastly, even their ancestral temple gave their approval so he became the heir.

Therefore, it could be said that his current achievement was due to Li Qiye, hence his attempt to find Li Qiye all this time. He became quite emotional after coming across Li Qiye again.

“It is your own fortune.” Li Qiye didn’t take credit.

Nonetheless, Jinlin viewed Li Qiye as a benefactor and a teacher. He replied: “Sir, since we have met again, please allow me to offer you a cup.”

Having said that, he invited Li Qiye up the stage towards the master spot.

Meanwhile, the young lord assumed that Jinlin was actually targeting him. The meeting was meant for him to become the leader of the young generation. Moreover, he was the one who commenced it.

“Your Highness, a criminal like him can’t sit down in that spot.” He didn’t hold back as a result.

As the son of Peacock Monarch, he didn’t need to be concerned with Jinlin’s feelings.

By this point, Dragon might just be as strong as Lion’s Roar. His father was their ace card as well. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“There must be a misunderstanding, Young Lord.” Jinlin wasn’t angry.

“Hmph.” The young lord aggressively sneered: “He killed our inner disciple first then Deer King, this is a blood feud. This happened in the ward and in front of everyone. How is this murderer not a criminal?”

Logic was on his side so regardless of the reason, Li Qiye did indeed kill members of Dragon in public so retaliation was justified.

Jinlin’s brows furrowed slightly. In reality, he didn’t care why Li Qiye killed those men. He had chosen to support Li Qiye no matter what.

“Young Lord, I’m sure you have a clear idea of what had actually happened since you were present.” Jinlin revealed his stance.

The crowd exchanged glances. Even a fool could see that he was supporting Li Qiye. As the heir of Lion’s Roar, he was qualified to represent his kingdom as well.

Some started regretting their previous choice. If they had known that Li Qiye was connected with Lion’s Roar, they would have tried their best to befriend Little Diamond.

As for the elders and disciples of Little Diamond, they have been lost the entire time. They had no idea why Lion’s Roar was backing their sect master.
