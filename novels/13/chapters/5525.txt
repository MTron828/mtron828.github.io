Chapter 5526: World’s Judgment

“What do you think then? Eggs are eggs and words are words?” The voice asked.

“Perhaps.” Li Qiye smiled.

“And there is a symbiosis relationship between the two.” The voice became certain all of a sudden.

“If that’s true, would you be here? What about the other words?” He smiled.

“Well…” The voice pondered for a bit before acquiescing: “I suppose co-existence is the better word.”

“That’s fine, but have you considered a more fundamental issue?” He asked.

“What?” The voice asked.

“The world’s judgment.” He said, causing a violent ripple shooting across this illusory realm. [1]

“The judgment of heaven and earth. That’s post-nascent.” The voice said.

“Why does that matter? I am post-nascent as well.” He said.

“The egg is pre-nascent.” The voice said.

“Then how do I become the egg?” He questioned.

“You can assume a state of pre-nascent.” The voice responded.

“Either state of origin matters to me not. I am me, my true self.” He shook his head.

“Back to the world’s judgment, it might not exist.” The voice said.

“Do we see the existence of eggs? The same concept applies to the omnipresent judgment.” He said.

The voice didn’t respond.

“You are the dao, separated from the mortal world and different from me and the egg. That’s why you cannot provide an answer.” He continued.

The voice agreed with this point but not the previous: “The judgment might not be a thing.”

“It seems like we can’t come to a consensus regarding this topic, let’s talk about something else.” He said.

“What?” The voice was always cautious of Li Qiye.

“I came with sincerity, absent of malice. There is no need for you to be cautious against my kind soul.” He said.

“I’m still convinced that you can become an egg.” The voice said.

“Forget about the future, I am not an egg right now.” He shook his head.

“It doesn’t change the possibility of that happening.” The voice insisted.

“I am absolutely sure that it won’t. My origin starts with my dao heart and will end with my dao heart, an immovable one making me a candidate. If this ever changes, I will cease to be myself and the circumstances of my becoming an egg disappear as well, isn’t this a paradox?”

“We’ll see about that.” The voice seemed to have done countless cycles of calculation before.

“Fine, whatever, I’m an egg then, let’s talk about the three stones instead.” Li Qiye smiled helplessly.

“The Trinity Stones.” The voice knew what he was talking about right away.

“Yes.” He nodded.

“They don’t matter since you’re an egg.” The voice said.

“It’s interesting, always a stone in one generation after another. They can have one possibility or three.” He said.

The voice entertained him and performed a derivation as well regarding this matter.

“Born from three yet interconnected. The past originated from the present and guards the future.” The voice gave an answer.

“What of the future?” He asked.

“The future…” The voice calculated again before answering: “It might be in the past or is shining in the present.”

“That doesn’t make sense.” He shook his head.

“That’s what the future is.” The voice said with certainty.

“Fine, what about the present? That’s the key.” He asked with a serious expression.

“The present…” The voice started the process once more and didn’t reply after finishing.

“The present is the present, it is here and now.” It concluded.

“It is not only in the present, there must be a key point.” He said.

“The present is the future and the past.” The voice said.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“No, that’s not right. Then all three stones are the same without any distinction, just one timeline and not three.” He shook his head.

“One stone for one timeline, one timeline for one stone, three together.” The voice repeated.

“Let’s try another perspective, the dao city is inscribed into a scripture, what about the three stones?” He smiled, forcing the voice to calculate with its unique ability.

“It’s a word.” It revealed the conclusion.

“Are you sure? Doesn’t seem to be the case.” His expression became serious.

“Absolutely.” The voice said.

“A word, to be actually living. Can you do the same?” He smiled and said.

He was answered with silence.

“Hey, did you hear me?” He asked again.

This time, he saw bright flashes as if the voice was pushing everything to the infinite, searching for all possible traces.

“A word is present, no doubt about it.” It said.

“Strange.” He stroked his chin and said: “Back to my point earlier though, what if you and Immortal Dao City become one entity?”

“Impossible.” The voice rejected this possibility: “I am the destination.”

“I suppose, you are both the origin and the destination, no need for anything external.” He smiled: “Can we apply the same reasoning to the stones? It should work the same way.”

“It’s there.” The voice said.

“Why is that? In the present, there should only be one stone and the three are not one right now. I wonder if something is off.” He speculated.

“There isn’t.” The voice didn’t sound as confident this time.

“If you’re not sure, try communicating and ask some questions.” He said.

“Impossible, don’t know where it is and it won’t respond.” If Li Qiye could see this entity, he would see it shaking its head.

“Interesting. What about the other words?” He asked.

“Don’t know.” The voice answered.

“Don’t know or don’t want to tell me?” He smiled.

1. The concept of the world itself being conscious and capable of delivering judgment, not the high heaven. I’m unsure why this is a significant point. These recent chapters have been very difficult to translate since they are so vague. It might make more sense once certain events happen in the future. I just need more information on the high heaven and that person/him/he. ☜
