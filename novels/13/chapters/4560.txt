Chapter 4561: Robbing

Once the Improper Four were gone, the woman also dispersed into particles and disappeared.

Incineration Treant fell into the silent death again. The leaf being gone didn’t seem to affect him since he didn’t pursue the four. Of course, losing this leaf didn’t matter compared to the reincarnation cycle awaiting him.

“Damn, didn’t think the four brats would actually be able to do it.” Crowd members became slack-jawed.

Everyone could see the treant’s might but the four used a special strategy to obtain the leaf. So far, they were only the successful ones. The rest have failed; surviving was already lucky enough.

Ultimately, these corpses were just unreasonably strong. Taking risks was one thing but the probability was negligible. However, the four youths managing to do it left the older cultivators in shambles.

“They came prepared on top of being rather prudent and secretive, possessing both brawl and brains.” A last-gen cultivator praised.

Everyone immediately understood that these four were actually from powerful lineages, most likely the ancient clans.

“Swindler, should we give it a shot?” Jian Ming became tempted after seeing the successful attempt.

“It’s difficult.” The daoist answered right away and shook his head.

They were strong but there still existed an unsurmountable gap. Moreover, just one wrong move meant death.

“Yo, just try to find the weakest or the most merciful.” Jian Ming didn’t give up. His treacherous eyes shifted from one corpse to another.

Alas, he couldn’t find an obvious target. All of them used to be mighty back during their own generation. The two of them wouldn’t be able to stop a single finger strike from one corpse.

The daoist also scouted the bridge and calculated with his fingers. Unfortunately, he couldn’t come up with a clear target either: “The weakest can still eradicate the two of us.”

“You’re right.” Jian Ming agreed.

“Try the skeletal duck.” Li Qiye suddenly suggested.

“The skeletal duck?” The two stared at the little creature.

“That’s the weakest among them?” Jian Ming asked.

“No.” Li Qiye chuckled: “It’s just that you two coincidentally have things that might be able to buy time for you to grab the golden egg.”

“How do we do it?” Jian Ming became excited.

Li Qiye stared at the daoist and elaborated: “Your clan has the temporal-reversal eight trigrams. Use that rotation to show the previous life, the duck will be distracted.”

“Young Noble, you know about these trigrams too?” The daoist couldn’t believe it.

Li Qiye then smiled at Jian Ming: “You have the River Sunset Sphere. As the daoist keeps the duck occupied, use it to obtain the golden egg. It is best to exercise caution and speed. Just one split second too late and it’ll be the end of you.”

“How do you know about my sphere too?” Jian Ming appeared to be frozen, feeling as naked as can be.

“You certainly didn’t return empty-handed. That fortune didn’t only include broadening your horizon.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

“You’re right, I’m dumb.” Jian Ming smiled wryly and agreed with this logic.

This sphere came from a once-in-a-lifetime trip, not something from his clan. He didn’t tell this secret to anyone, not even his closest friend or family member. He worried that once he revealed the origin of this item, it might cause a disaster for his clan.

However, Li Qiye knew right away. It was impossible to hide anything from this man.

“Swindler, still up for it? Let’s do it.” He calmed down and asked the daoist.

The daoist stared at the skeletal duck while gritting his teeth. After a brief pause, he answered: “Fine, maybe we can actually do it.”

Earlier, the duck killed a sovereign with a single peck. They would certainly die to the same thing. Nonetheless, they jumped up the bridge and surrounded the duck.

“These two want to try?” People noticed their attempt. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Due to the massacre earlier with many big shots dying, most have given up on robbing the corpses. Thus, the two became the center of attention. Everyone recognized Jian Ming because of his foul mouth.

“They want the golden egg.” A commenter stated the obvious.

“It’s impossible.” Both the old and the young thought that they had no chance.

“Someone as strong as Skyshield Monarch couldn’t block its peck. His defense broke down in the blink of an eye. Juniors like them can’t do anything.” A big shot shook her head.

“They need to know their limit and place.” A youth snorted.

“Looks like Li Qiye gave them pointers, maybe it is hopeful.” A clan elder stared at Li Qiye and then said.

“So what? The difference in power is too great, strategy doesn’t matter.” One ancestor disagreed.

“Darn right.” A genius sneered: “That Li guy might be lucky to be favored by the goddess but this makes him too confident. All he’s doing is sending those two to their death. As if some pointers can overcome this.”

All in all, the crowd wouldn’t bet money on Jian Ming and the daoist. At the same time, they were rather nervous.

Though they had confidence in Li Qiye’s guidance, they were still the ones to carry it out. Just one mistake would result in death.

Meanwhile, the skeletal duck didn’t react to them being near.

The two exchanged glances and then solemnly nodded.

“Let’s do this, swindler.” Jian Ming placed his life in the daoist’s hand and vice versa. They knew that they were responsible for each other now.
