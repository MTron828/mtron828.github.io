Chapter 5816: One Found and One Made

“What are these treasures?” The crowd became frustrated after seeing the strange items.

They have seen plenty of rare and precious treasures and become used to it. Alas, they couldn’t sense anything special from these items. Of course, this was not the time to play around so they were certainly extraordinary.

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye stared at them, surprised: “Not your creation, either Primal or Derivation’s works.”

“Primal Ancestor found the materials and Derivation Ancestor crafted them.” The immortals didn’t bother hiding the truth.

“It must be Old Derivation’s idea, no one is a greater genius than he, crafting them in tune with your bloodline.” Li Qiye said: “What’s more interesting is that they took the time to craft these items for you but not help with improving your cultivation after all these years. Is it a matter of comprehension or do they have ulterior motives?”

“Don’t you get tired of always sowing discord?!” Heaven Authority roared.

“I’m just curious, that’s all. You three lived in the immemorial period with few cultivators, meaning an abundance of resources and laws. They had access to the source of the epoch and didn’t have successors, they could have spent all of their time and energy into helping you three. Alas, you still can’t reach the everlasting stage, I don’t know what to say.” He ended with a smirk.

Listeners realized something upon hearing this. They found the dao to be missing something after reaching the apex. The overlords who had pioneered the path didn’t teach them mantras or methods to reach the ancestral level.

The three immortals of Celestial Court didn’t have the same restriction since they had access to the overlords’ help. Thus, they should be even stronger according to Li Qiye.

“What is the everlasting stage?” An emperor asked.

Meanwhile, Demon and her allies were observing the battle as well through a heavenly mirror, sharing the same curiosity.

Li Qiye’s dao lesson earlier helped them see origination through the truths. The path to the primal anima became apparent.

“After the primal anima stage.” Profound responded since he had embarked on the path before the rest.

“You’re wasting your time trying to influence us.” The three immortals shook their head.

“Why would I bother? Not like the three of you can betray and kill those two geezers. All of you will fall anyway, I’m just asking out of curiosity.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What a waste of time.” One of them said.

Of course, they would never admit to having inadequate comprehension. After all, they were the greatest geniuses of the distant ages, not to mention being some of the strongest cultivators right now.

“Okay, my mistake then. I suppose that the dao is still a personal process, but did they only show you the door or actually help you get inside?” Li Qiye smiled.

“You will never get the coordinates from us, we will die fighting.” Divine Eternal said firmly.

“Sigh, why do you think so poorly of me, I’m not that kind of person.” Li Qiye lamented.

You’re exactly that kind of person - this line was written in the spectators’ eyes as they gazed at him.

They knew he was trying to cast doubt into the three immortals. After all, it certainly wouldn’t feel good to not be treated with sincerity.

“Here’s something else you should keep in mind.” Li Qiye said: “Why did Old Primal leave Death Coffin to an outsider instead of you three? You’re way closer to him.”

Their expression changed dramatically afterward. The crowd was surprised to hear this as well. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Death Coffin, one of the nine? Celestial Court has it too?” An Immortal Monarch asked.

“Had, Sacred Teacher took it later.” Sword Emperor who was a participant in the previous war smiled wryly: “So Primal Ancestor was the owner.”

“Perhaps a shared ownership.” Profound’s eyes flickered, having heard some rumors.

“Why didn’t he keep it himself?” Another spoke softly.

Li Qiye had revealed many secrets today, including how Celestial Court had two heavenly treasures - Elder Galaxy and Death Coffin.

The former needed no elaboration - everything existed within the treasure. However, why didn’t Primal Ancestor keep and use Death Coffin or at least let the trusted three immortals keep it?

They were the representatives of the blood branch, not to mention being Primal’s disciples in all but name.

Li Qiye finally struck a sore spot, evident in the trio’s ugly expression.
