Note: I will be using the word “intent” here in this chapter. For people who are unfamiliar with this term, intent is the art of the weapon. It can be a sword intent, saber intent, spear intent... It is not the will nor awareness of the weapon, but it is the understanding of the user towards the dao of the weapon. For example, when a sword master reaches a certain level with his sword intent, even a leaf can become a sword. Sword and man becoming one is one level of the sword intent. Another level of the intent is everything in nature is a sword.

After another careful observation, Li Qiye then pulled out the saber.

“Zhangggg...” The unsheathed saber then unleashed a heaven piercing dao energy. In a flash, it was as if the godly saber woke up as it exuded a terrifying cold light that instilled fear into people, rendering them unable to look at it directly.

Sensing the peerless saber intent of the godly saber, the entire group of Li Shuangyan was amazed at this very second. This was a supreme godly saber — absolutely and terrifyingly incomparable!

“Boom!” While Li Qiye was still carefully looking at the saber, a sudden loud bang exploded as another aura surged forward in the sky. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Old Wu...” Lion Monarch Ba Xian coldly snorted and said: “Did you think I would bully your descendants without you around?”

However, in the blink of an eye, a blade cut through the sky, containing an invincible saber intent. This invincible blade that was capable of even cutting through the primordial beginning aimed straight towards the ancient palace!

“Old Wu, you still want to fight?” Against the incoming blade, Lion Monarch Ba Xian coldly scowled and unleashed an upwards fist that was capable of causing the heaven’s demise.

“Old Lion, eat my blade!” The Martial God’s roar finally reached them. A shadow void stepping in the air finally came. He finally regained his wits and immediately pursued to this place.

“Go...” Amidst the lightning and fire of the eventual battle, Li Qiye shouted. In the blink of an eye, Niu Fen carried everyone away as his body resembled a spinning top. In just a flash, Niu Fen actually traversed the void and turned into a curve to immediately escape Lion Monarch Ba Xian’s territory! This speed was truly unbelievable!

Heavenly Ancestral Snails had unimaginable divine abilities, especially after Niu Fen was given the divine solution by Li Qiye, he became even more incredible.

“Old Lion, you actually dare to think about my Heaven Traversing Eight Saber! Today, not decapitating you won’t do!” The roar of the Martial God rang from the far distance.

It was met by the angry shout of Lion Monarch Ba Xian: “Quit your bullshit, I don’t even want that rubbish junk!”

“Bang–bang–bang” At this moment, the Martial God and the Lion Monarch had started their battle!

They escaped in just an instant, and then Li Qiye signaled for Niu Fen to head towards an even deeper territory which prompted Li Shuangyan’s horror as she asked: “We’re not escaping from the Heavenly Ancient Corpse Burial Ground?”

“Too late, there is someone even more formidable ahead, we will go there.” Li Qiye shouted as he put the Tyrannical Immortal Saber into the treasure box of the Middle Continent Ancient Kingdom.

“Old Wu, you dare to scheme for my godly saber!” In an instant, Lion Monarch Ba Xian lost the connection to his saber. His facial expression greatly soured as he roared furiously.

“Stop breaking wind, I don’t care for your lousy saber!” The Martial God angrily roared and said: “Old Lion, give me my technique scroll!”

Between the fire and lightning of this battle, the group of Li Qiye had escaped for a long distance with Niu Fen exerting his fastest possible speed. However, such a distance for existences like Lion Monarch Ba Xian was simply not far enough!

In just a moment, there was a tall mountain blocking the path of Li Qiye’s group. The vastness of this mountain was impossible to describe. One could even say that this was the highest mountain they saw ever since they came to this burial ground. It could even be the highest mountain in the Heavenly Ancient Corpse Burial Ground.

The high mountain pierced straight to the sky’s horizon as if it had inserted itself into the deepest part of the sky. In the end, one could not see how tall it was just by looking up. It stood in the middle of the heaven and earth as the sun and moon appeared inside with the celestials rotating around it. Any existence would feel that they were so inconsequential when standing at this mountain’s base.

“Rush in!” Li Qiye shouted at Niu Fen right at this moment. Niu Fen — in the blink of an eye — headed towards this high mountain, wanting to climb above.

“Bang–bang–bang” At the very next moment, there was thunder at the edge of the horizon as two gigantic hands reached forward to this direction.

“Little Demon, you dare to steal my godly saber.” At this time, the furious voice of Lion Monarch Ba Xian appeared.

It was immediately followed by the thunderous explosive sound of the Wu Progenitor: “Where are you from, Demon Spawns. Daring to pretend to be my Wu Clan’s descendants!”

Two hands — one was from the Lion Monarch, and the other was from the Martial God. Both of them reached across the heaven and earth and aimed straight to grab Li Qiye.

“Boom!” At this moment, Niu Fen, who was dashing towards the high mountain, was bounced back. It was as if this mountain was covered by an impenetrable divine force.

“In the Bamboo Forest, an arrow that pierces the heavens!” At this moment, Li Qiye shouted and, at the same time, he told Niu Fen: “Rush in...”

Niu Fen unhesitatingly crazily rushed in towards the high mountain. “Boom!” In the blink of an eye, Niu Fen managed to carry the group into the high mountain while the two hands collided with the unparalleled divine power of the high mountain and were immediately pushed back!

After finally making it to the mountain, Niu Fen almost collapsed to the ground. Just a little bit less and they wouldn’t have been able to escape the grasp of the Lion Monarch and the Martial God!

In the blink of an eye, the Martial God and the Lion Monarch arrived. The moment the group saw them, they couldn’t help but feel the chills running through their spines. These two were invincible existences of a generation that swept through the nine heavens and ten earths! Once they made a move, the group’s fate would be doomed!

However, oddly enough, the Martial God and the Lion Monarch stopped right outside of the high mountain and didn’t dare to even take half a step forward.

Finally, the Martial God bowed towards the high mountain and said: “Predecessor, these brats pretended to be my descendants and stole my peerless technique. Please kick these brats out!”

At this point, Li Shuangyan’s group also looked again at the high mountain, and they noticed that there was a wooden coffin hanging on the precipice. It appeared to be simple without any magnificent features; however, as it was hanging there in its high place, it appeared to be one coffin encompassing the entire world as all gods prostrated before it!

They finally understood that the Martial God and the Lion Monarch were dreading the existence inside this wooden coffin.

However, the wooden coffin hanging on the precipice did not respond to the Martial God. It was as if it was too much of a bother! Even then, the Lion Monarch and the Martial God still didn’t dare to take half a step inside this place.

Seeing such a scene, regardless of whether it was Li Shuangyan or the the group of Niu Fen, everyone felt a chilling and shocking sensation in their hearts. Who was the Martial God and the Lion Monarch? During Immortal Emperor Tun Ri’s era, outside of Tun Ri himself, there was no one in the world who could suppress the two of them. If they combined forces, no one outside of Tun Ri during that generation could put a halt to their advance! Their joint power could decapitate the gods in the heavens and destroy the devils in hell!

But today, even though they came together, they did not dare to trespass into this place. One could only imagine how frightening the existence inside the wooden coffin on the precipice must be!

Since the existence inside the wooden coffin did not answer, the Lion Monarch and the Martial God were helpless. At this moment, the anger appeared in their eyes as the bloody rays flashed straight at Li Qiye.

“Little Demon, where on earth are you from, daring to pretend to be my Wu descendants!?” The Wu Progenitor coldly inquired.

And Lion Monarch Ba Xian also indignantly gritted his teeth and shouted: “Little Demon, you dare to scheme for my godly saber, did you lose the patience to live!?”

Li Qiye calmly stood on top of the snail’s shell and leisurely said: “The Tyrannical Immortal Saber and the Heaven Traversing Eight Saber, they are wasted in this Heavenly Ancient Corpse Burial Ground — isn’t this a shame? Both of you were a match made in heaven for a generation, so you should know even more clearly that the Tyrannical Immortal Saber and the Heaven Traversing Eight Saber had the same origin! Both of them together would be the real unbeatable offensive method!”

“Haha, hekhek, very good, a little demon like you is worrying about us!” Lion Monarch Ba Xian was so angry that he started to laugh instead as he smilingly replied.

Li Qiye was still as calm as before and smilingly retorted: “To be frank, swindling items from the dead is truly a bit immoral; however, I will form a good karma with you two.”

At this point, Li Qiye looked at the Martial God and continued: “The Sacred Wu Clan has fallen from era to era. You cannot leave the Heavenly Ancient Corpse Burial Ground unless you live again for another generation. You should be aware that your Wu descendants are unable to come and honor you. Even back when your Wu Clan had Virtuous Paragons, they were still not powerful enough to come here! Today, it will be even more impossible. Today, I take away your saber technique, and I will give your Wu Clan a good karmic return. I will save your Wu Clan’s one remaining bloodline, or, I will help your Wu Clan rise again in the future.”

The Martial God then looked at Li Qiye without saying anything for a long time.

“As for you.” Li Qiye stared at Lion Monarch Ba Xian and slowly spoke: “Your one lineage is already devoid of people for the most part. Today, I take your godly saber, I will also form a good karmic remembrance to your descendants. If I meet your descendants in the future, I will leave behind some words for them?”

Lion Monarch Ba Xian also gazed at Li Qiye for a long time without words. It was already amazing that he did not go crazy from being swindled out of his godly saber.

“Both of you should go back, it is not beneficial for either of you to be away from your dragon caves for so long!” Li Qiye leisurely looked at the both of them and smilingly said: “Today, I took away your treasures. To tell you the truth, I don’t need to form good karma with you two. I didn’t even need to swindle the both of you. It is not impossible for me to destroy or alter your Dragon Veins. Out of my own sentimentality for the relationship between you two and Immortal Emperor Tun Ri, I didn’t change nor move your Dragon Veins. If I wanted to destroy your dragon caves along with your blood effort for millions of years, it was not an impossible matter!” Li Qiye leisurely declared.

Both the Martial God and the Lion Monarch remained silent for a long time.

“Go back, my words are resolute. Today, I take away your treasures; I will form a good relationship with your descendants in the future!” Li Qiye finally said with a smile.

“Good” In the end, the Martial God stomped on the ground once and then turned around to leave without any hesitation!

Lion Monarch Ba Xian lingered for a moment, then he finally threw an item forward and gravely shouted: “Don’t forget the positive karma today!” With that, he turned around and left!

The Lion Monarch’s item eventually fell into the hand of Li Qiye. It was an ancient box with an unknown item inside. Li Qiye only looked at it once, then he put it away.

When the two finally left, Li Shuangyan’s group was finally able to let out a sigh of relief. Their stressed nerves were suddenly relaxed as they sat down on the ground.

“It was really dangerous just now.” Even Niu Fen couldn’t help but to wipe away his cold sweat. They actually managed to obtain two supreme treasures. This will be an unimaginable and legendary tale!
