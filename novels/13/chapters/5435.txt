Chapter 5436: Who Else But Me?

Immortal Pagoda was unstoppable back in the lower continents and had the same success in the upper continents.

He was ferocious and decisive during his conquest, destroying numerous kingdoms and sects along the way. The most frightening thing about him was his inborn primordial dao fruit - something most likely superior to having twelve fruits.

However, given his physical gifts, many believed that he would have been an apex cultivator even without the special fruit.

His appearance caused the first imbalance - four to three apex cultivators. Moreover, All-things, Darkfrost, and Sword Queen specialized in offensive abilities. They wouldn’t be able to stop his pagoda.

In the past, Calamity Dao Lord played the role of stopping him. Moreover, they had Illumination Conqueror as well.

Today, Illumination was dead while The Race still had another apex cultivator - Principle Conqueror.

Ever since his abdication, he was rumored to have been living reclusively back in his clan, no longer showing up. In spite of this, he should still stand with The Race during an all-out war.

“Who will stop me today?” Immortal Pagoda asked, looking ready to fight anyone.

Members of The People certainly felt great pressure due to the destructive nature of his pagoda.

“Who else but me? Haha, won’t be difficult playing with your pagoda at all!” Suddenly, a ray stretched closer from the horizon, allowing the rider to appear on the battlefield in no time at all.

“You’re finally here.” All-things smiled and said.

The rider was a thin old man with an antennae growing on his forehead. He had a shell on his back with twelve intricate patterns. The flowing runes could deduce the utmost wonders and mysteries of the world.

Although the old man appeared weak and feeble, the flickering flash in his eyes contained a primordial tablet capable of halting the flow of time.

“So you are back, Fellow Daoist Calamity.” Immortal Pagoda glanced at his shell and said: “I heard that your shell broke down.”

Fortunately, the descendants in Imperial Attendant City still remembered him and used a dream order to save him from his captivity.

“Hahaha, wasn’t difficult crafting a new one since I was bored being stuck in that palace. This one is so much better than the previous, I wonder if your pagoda has improved as well.” Calamity said.

“We’ll find out now!” Immortal Pagoda’s primordial fruit started crushing space and freezing everyone.

This battle consisted of the best of the best. Nonetheless, most were fundamentally weaker due to a lack of primordial affinity.

This applied to All-things and the other apex cultivators. They possessed anima but this was still one step lower than the power stemming from the primordial fruit.

“Good!” Calamity laughed but didn’t underestimate his opponent.

He raised his shell containing the mysteries of heaven and earth, condensing them into an impregnable wall. This was the toughest defense, no different from an indomitable dao heart.

“Impressive, your shell is indeed better now.” Immortal Pagoda praised.

Calamity stopped being complacent after losing his old shell to the palace gates. He spent years creating a new one - a culmination of his lifelong dao search and the innate gift of his race.

“The same goes for you, let’s do this!” Calamity said and pushed his shell forward. Despite being a defensive technique, its momentum still swept through the battlefield while being dangerous all the same.

Immortal Pagoda seemed happy to be facing a capable foe. He raised his pagoda and commanded it to descend while releasing chaos energy.

A battle between these mortal foes wouldn’t end any time soon, the same as how it used to be during the previous war.

“Brother, try this!” Supreme made his move as well, slashing his void dao in the direction of All-things Dao Lord.

All-things took this seriously and activated his renowned mantra. One entity turned into a dao capable of supporting all things.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Try this!” Darkfrost picked Swordsea as his opponent.

“Bring it!” Swordsea could control his ocean of swords with a single thought, wanting to drown the other sword user.

Both of them were practitioners of the nine heavenly sword dao.

“Fellow Daoist, shall we?” Sword Queen performed her everlasting sword technique.

Eternal immediately activated his bloodline and temporal affinity in retaliation.
