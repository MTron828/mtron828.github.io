Chapter 4380: Peacock Monarch’s Arrival

“Perfection from refinement and birth from fire.” Li Qiye said: “Even your incredible gift can’t resist the will of the heaven.”

If a phoenix could hatch from this egg, it would be a monumental event in history. Alas, heaven didn’t allow for such a creature to exist.

It would absolutely send down a tribulation - one strong enough to overcome the cycles of rebirth.

He then sat down, raising one hand and summoning tiny laws. With the other hand, he created a unique dao truefire. It had a primordial origin and carried the warmth akin to a mother’s embrace.

“Buzz.” The tiny laws flew upward and mingled with the dimension’s laws. It continued onward and aimed for the gigantic rune.

“Rumble!” An unstoppable divinity descended as the rune attacked Li Qiye with a phoenix flame. It instantly appeared above him while carrying enough firepower to incinerate myriad worlds.

“Screech!” It assumed the form of a phoenix and engulfed the entire dimension.

“Boom!” It certainly had enough power to burn all of Eight Desolaces into nothingness, eradicating every single sect and cultivator.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, chanted a mantra and became shrouded in a supreme light. He turned into a descending immortal capable of subduing the divine beasts.

Even a true phoenix would be tamed by him. This current state allowed him to be completely untouchable.

The hand that released the tiny laws earlier released a seal. Time came to a halt and the incoming phoenix stagnated, becoming a billion times slower than before while its flaws were magnified.

This seal rendered everything else insignificant. Even a divine beast would be subjected to its domination - in this case, the phoenix flame.

The bird let out a groan before falling down to the ground and turning back into strands of laws.

“Seal.” Li Qiye commanded, aiming for the rune.

This rune represented the innate talent and dao of a phoenix. Nonetheless, he still easily suppressed it.

His own dao manifested into reality above - signally a return to primordial chaos. Primordial energy took over the entire dimension.

Tiny laws shot out of the dimension and built a spatial passage through Phoenix Ground all the way to the depths of Ravaged Land.

All of these above factors caused the dimension to be engraved with something unique. The process was fully focused on the golden egg. Meanwhile, the flame from his other hand started surrounding the egg.

It could sense that something was amiss and tried to resist, intending on breaking Li Qiye’s seal and escaping. However, Li Qiye’s dao energy had suppressed everything so struggling was futile. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Sizzle.” The flame began refining the egg and leaving behind indelible markings. His laws also spun around the egg like spiderwebs.

He meditated for this goal. Time was not flowing in this dimension so a million years in here was no different than the blink of an eye.

As he was occupied in the special dimension, clamor broke out in City of Demons and the capital.

“Buzz.” A five-colored radiance illuminated the sky above and shocked the inhabitants.

“Sect Master!” The members of Dragon shouted in astonishment.

“Peacock Monarch.” Everyone knew the source of the light and felt that something big was going to happen.

“Screech!” Next came an ear-splitting phoenix cry that can be heard from anywhere in Dragon. It intimidated both beasts and men due to its supreme nature.

The sky turned dark for a moment before colorful rays took over. Demonic gales gathered above and turned into a majestic figure.

This wind-like entity flew towards City of Demons at a speed faster than lightning.

“He’s coming.” A spectator gasped.

Normally, he never needed to visit this city because it already had the three branches. Ancestors and the other monarchs had administrative control so he didn’t need to worry. He rarely came back after becoming the sect master.

Everyone in Dragon became emotional after seeing this. Even a fool knew his reason for coming.
