Chapter 5815: Raising A Crystal Ball

The three immortals could tell the difference between reality and illusion. They felt their blades cutting Li Qiye earlier and the pieces on the ground were truly him.

They had no idea how to make sense of the two bodies.

“Killing him is impossible.” Profound Emperor murmured.

“The sabers aren’t bad.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Cutting down my space, time, and samsara cycle but still one step away, unable to find the actual me.”

“He leaped out so fast.” The three immortals exchanged glances.

They did cut him down earlier but in the last possible moment, he somehow leaped out of that dimension’s fabrics of reality and cycles, leaving behind the crystallized shell.

They understood the process and the significance, unlike weaker emperors. The problem was how he did it without activating any power or divinity - a truly terrifying feat.

“My turn.” Li Qiye smiled and raised his hand, summoning the fragmented crystals beneath his feet.

They came together to form a crystal hammer as he laughed and said: “Take this!”

“Watch it!” The trio’s expression darkened as they utilized their strongest move.

“Boom!” Heaven Authority’s trident soared with a pulsing golden light. Devil Bestowment’s eyes released a mystical expanse for defensive measure. Divine Eternal’s disk spewed out hallowed laws.

“Bam!” All three defensive measures couldn’t stop the casual smash. The impact and shockwaves struck their chest like a heavy hammer, causing them to spew out a mouthful of blood.

They managed to get back up with faces as pale as could be. Just one casual blow from him left them heavily injured. This was far from his full power as well.

“Looks like you three can’t protect Celestial Court either.” Li Qiye remarked, leaving everyone breathless.

Although they knew this would happen, seeing his domination in such a short time still astounded them. He could defeat three Ancestors without utilizing any technique.

“One overlord is not enough, it has to be several.” They came to this consensus.

“Anything else?” He smiled at the trio.

They solemnly nodded and took out unique weapons. Heaven Authority wielded a staff with a mark identical to the one on his forehead, seemingly made from dried branches from an unknown tree.

It appeared out of place given his status and identity. If this were his ultimate treasure, it should be made from the finest grade metal exuding incredible divinity. The staff looked like it belonged to a dark wizard, not him.

Upon closer inspection, people noticed that something was amiss. The veins on the branch flowed as if alive. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As for Devil Bestowment, he raised something resembling a fragile crystal ball. It had no bottom in sight. Just one glance at it meant being imprisoned within its confines with no hope for escape.

Divine Eternal had something even stranger - a bundle of withered grass. Its dryness made it susceptible to an ignition capable of setting the cosmo ablaze. No creature would be able to survive.

Their choice of weapons surprised everyone. How could these be invincible artifacts? They looked more like random items found on a street market’s stall in the mortal world.
