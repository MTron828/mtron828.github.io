Chapter 4620: Mighty Slash

“Boom!” The flame empowered Voidburn instead of hurting him. The fiery aura around him became entirely different since it had a golden glow now. It seemed to be melted gold; how could a flame seem so tangible and heavy?

The damaged wall became tougher and gained a golden layer. Each brick seemingly weighed millions of pounds. His defense became numerous times tougher as a result and managed to stop the slash.

“He did it!” A spectator shouted.

The slash was terrifying and could only be stopped by a few youths from this generation. Nonetheless, Voidburn was able to do so after receiving help. Now, the tides have turned once more.

“What is this? The kid can’t win and now the adults want to play too?” Li Qiye smiled and raised one hand. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Buzz.” Tiny spirit-like runes appeared on his fingertip. He waved his hand, commanding them to enter Jian Ming’s body.

“Boom!” Jian Ming’s draconic aura intensified during this awakening process.

His ancient bloodline woke up and turned him into a dragon. His blood turned into draconic blood, causing the spectators to feel a suffocating pressure.

“Bam!” The slash suddenly exerted its strongest potential and became unstoppable.

The golden wall could no longer stop it despite the previous empowerment. The entire thing crumbled as a result

“You dare?!” The ancestor who wanted to save Voidburn was still one step late.

“No!!!” Voidburn turned to flee as fast as possible but it was too late.

Blood splashed from his decapitated corpse. His eyes were wide open in disbelief as it fell down next to the body. He never expected to die to a nobody before. He had such a bright future ahead…

The atmosphere became somber as everyone gazed at the falling corpse.

“He won…” Ye Tingrong couldn’t regain her wits. Due to her previous impression of Jian Ming, she didn’t think that he would be so strong. If she had to pick someone to be the winner, it would have been Voidburn.

Jian Ming’s slash was simply shocking. Moreover, his personality completely changed from a swindler to a god of death. The inviolable and merciless nature of the latter left a deep impression on her.

“I don’t think he’s weaker than any successor of the great powers.” Someone calmed down and said.

The majority looked down on him a while ago but he has proven himself to them with that ultimate slash. It seemed comparable to any dao lord technique. In fact, even the Fire Dragon Mantra was easily defeated.

“You’re dead, Junior!” The ancestor who helped Voidburn Godchild earlier finally arrived on the scene. He was furious after seeing the corpse.

“The first elder of Voidburn.” Many recognized him and whispered.

He was obviously furious. They came for a marriage proposal yet the potential groom was now dead.

“Can’t even accept defeat gracefully?” Jian Ming instantly retreated behind Li Qiye and laughed: “It was a fair fight, he lost because he lacked skill. If this is how your sect is going to act after losing, crawl back to your nest like good turtles lest you want to humiliate yourself again.”

He reverted back to his regular style right after the battle, no longer the god of death.

“A life for a life.” The first elder coldly uttered. He couldn’t come back to the sect right now without extracting retribution first.

If a member of the behemoths were to say this, the crowd would be silent. This wasn’t the case right now.

“Just accept defeat, it was a fair duel.” One expert shouted.

Others could see that before outside interference, Jian Ming would have won. Later on, two different seniors empowered them so this turned out to be fair as well.

“Elder, they’re right. No need to dwell over an honorable death in battle.” Someone else spoke up.

Everyone looked over and saw a youth in white. His robe fluttered to the wind - a scene from an elegant painting.

“Jadedragon Monarch of Divine Dragon!” A spectator bellowed.

Jadedragon Monarch, the junior brother of Tian Feng. Everyone knew about the marriage alliance between Voidburn and Divine Dragon Valley.

Normally, these two sects were always in the same boat. Now, Jadedragon Monarch should help the first elder avenge Voidburn Godchild by taking down Jian Ming’s group. The actual development was rather unexpected.

“The monarch knows right from wrong.” A few crowd members gave him a thumbs-up for being so reasonable.
