Chapter 4861: Monochromatic Master

Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor teamed up and research a way to improve their cultivation.

Finally, after painstaking effort, they decided to slay their previous dao and obtained a sacred fruit, creating an entirely new realm.

From then on, in order to honor their contribution and effort, the new realm was officially known as Heavenly Sovereign Dragon Lord.

Today, Firerage has also hit the limit as an Immortal Sovereign. Breaking through to the next step was immensely difficult. He had the help of a dao lord but this was still not enough.

Normally, one must rely on themselves. Outsiders couldn’t help and Firerage knew this. He had trained extremely hard but the bottleneck still got the best of him.

“Whether it be rushing or taking your time, there is no one right way in comprehending the grand dao. The latter can be surprisingly beneficial.” Li Qiye glanced at Firerage and understood his situation.

Firerage didn’t expect something like this to come out of Li Qiye. After all, it sounded rather profound and reminded him of His Majesty. His Majesty used to talk like this when he was still alive.

“Civil Deputy wishes for an audience.” A disciple came and reported, interrupting his stupor.

“Monochromatic Master.” Firerage hesitated after hearing this.

“We can’t send a guest away.” Li Qiye told him.

“Let him in then.” Firerage obeyed the command, albeit begrudgingly.

Monochromatic Master was different from Venerable Dragon God. The latter was strong and frightening but might not be a bad person. The same couldn’t be said about Monochromatic Master. This visit was definitely not good news.

A bit later, a man wearing a fancy embroidered robe with a cloak long enough to drape on the ground. His arrival was accompanied by a windy aura.

His face was especially strange - black on the left and white to the right just like a yin-yang symbol. Upon closer inspection, one would find that the two sides would occasionally swap color.

His aura was rather mighty. If he were to let it roam free, a tornado would manifest and destroy everything.

He was last place among the Ten Monsters and possessed one dao fruit, currently serving as a civil official in Eight-Stallion.

Venerable Dragon God had full authority over the army while he was in charge of administration.

Before joining the dynasty, he had his own domain where he reigned with absolute impunity. However, he lost to Eight-stallion’s subordinates later and had to join the dynasty. Putting his unsavory background aside, no one could criticize his administrative ability. 

“I am known as Monochromatic Master. I respectfully greet you, Your Highness, may you always be in good health.” He immediately kneeled before Li Qiye.

This lawless villain, surprisingly enough, chose to kneel before an unknown junior. He looked more loyal than Venerable Dragon God who questioned Li Qiye.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Your subject is overwhelmed with sadness regarding the late king’s death to the enemy. I will do everything I can to serve you and one day, may we avenge him.” He spoke with sorrow and tears.

Firerage didn’t fall for this and was still prepared to attack whenever.

“Rise.” Li Qiye waved.

Monochromatic Master stood up and stole glances at Li Qiye, wondering about the dao lord’s decision. He didn’t think that Eight-stallion suddenly became an idiot at the end of his life and would pass the throne to a stranger. There must be something else going on and he was here to figure it out.

“The journey must have been tiring with ruffians bothering you the entire time, I apologize for not being there to protect you, Your Highness.” He acted like a loyal subject.

“I appreciate it, Civic Deputy.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Your Highness, would you like to take a stroll with me and chat?” He glanced at Firerage and asked.

“Civic Deputy, say what is on your mind here, no need to leave.” Firerage immediately refused.

He would never let Li Qiye leave his side, especially not alone with this Monochromatic Master who was more dangerous than Venerable Dragon God.

The dragon god would never usurp but this guy could. This wasn’t baseless speculation either.

“Guard Commander, I only wish to speak to His Highness, are you questioning my loyalty?” Monochromatic Master smiled.

“I do not dare to question your loyalty, Civic Deputy.” Firerage said: “This is just part of my responsibility, please understand.”

His firm attitude left Monochromatic helpless. Though Firerage was not even among the top three strongest in the dynasty, his loyalty was second to none - the only person who couldn’t be doubted in this regard.

“Say what is on your mind here, Civic Deputy.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Your Highness, since His Majesty has just passed away, please be careful of treacherous members right here in our dynasty.” Monochromatic said quietly.

“Oh?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Some covet your throne, Your Highness, they might try to turn you into a puppet. Your power is limited right now so they will look down on you, thinking that you do not deserve your authority. Or, maybe they see that you are young and want to control each word and action of yours…”

“Civic Deputy, please mind your words.” Firerage uttered coldly.

In a sense, the former part could be referring to Venerable Dragon God’s group while the latter pointed at Firerage Saber.

“Guard Commander, my duty is to advise His Highness.” Monochromatic said: “Are you saying that I shouldn’t give my opinion, or is it because I’m exposing your plan?”

“You!” Firerage turned red with anger.

“I am willing to die for you, Your Highness.” Monochromatic said: “If you are worried about your safety, you should relocate to my palace. Anyone who wants to hurt you will have to walk over my old corpse first. I guarantee that you have my full support since I wish to carry out His Majesty’s wishes.” 

His eyes became teary and moving at this point.

“Moving to your palace?” Li Qiye murmured.

“You mustn’t, Your Highness.” Firerage anxiously said since that would be the same as walking into the lion’s den. 

Though Monochromatic wasn’t as strong as Venerable Dragon God or Northern Monarch, having Li Qiye on his side would make his authority legitimate. If the other two were to oppose him, they would be viewed as rebels.

“Guard Commander, I am only worrying about His Highness’ safety.” Monochromatic said: “There are too many scoundrels lurking in the dynasty. We will be sinners if anything were to happen to His Highness.”
