Chapter 5394: Celestial Court’s Destruction For The People’s Prosperity

“What happens afterward?” Li Qiye smiled and asked.

“The hundred races shall rise out of Celestial Court’s ashes.” Illumination answered without needing to think twice.

“Will that bring peace to the six continents? Nine Worlds and Eight Desolaces didn’t have heaveners, diviners, and devils, I didn’t see peace there.” Li Qiye responded.

Others pondered the question. War and conflicts never ceased in history. Humans fought demons and golems; sects were destroyed on a daily basis in Eight Desolaces. Mortals were caught in the conflict, meeting their demise without knowing why.

“If you insist on doing something so extreme, don’t just destroy the three races. Eradicate all cultivators, hundred races included. After all, mortals can’t be that destructive. Their wars are limited to blades and arrows, the area of effect is contained while any of you can destroy a continent with a single hand wave. Billions and billions have died because of cultivators so if we have to talk about those who deserve death, it would be you all.”

None could deny this because they had fought numerous battles to survive and make it this far. Moreover, Emperors War was particularly devastating with incalculable casualties.

“And you, Sir?” Illumination didn’t back down.

“My hands are stained with blood and I deserve to die a hundred times over, but I never claimed to care about the world.” Li Qiye smiled: “That’s why you are pitiful and unworthy of being called a conqueror. Although you have proven your dao and reached the top, you never faced your heart and desire. You claimed to be a savior while merely trying to carry out your own personal vendetta, resulting in countless deaths for The People.”

“If it wasn’t for me stopping Heaven Alliance, more would have been killed.” Illumination defended himself.

“You’re closer to being a clown than a savior. The People survived without you in the past while fighting Celestial Court and other mighty enemies. As for you, you lack the courage to fight Celestial Court, choosing to prance around in the upper continents, how sad, just a frog under the well.” Li Qiye criticized.

Illumination’s expression changed after hearing this humiliating criticism.

“Hahaha, Young Noble, you are so right.” Ferocity laughed and started clapping: “The People did live pretty well after Emperors War thanks to the Pact of Blessed. And even without you around, there’s still All-things, Darkfrost, and many others. To be blunt, your absence means nothing to the world. In fact, the world is a better place without you and Supreme, the two biggest pieces of shit.”

Others started laughing as well, signaling to Illumination that he no longer had the same grip over Dao Alliance as before. Moreover, he couldn’t refute the fact that prosperity had risen in recent times.

“There were many heroes during Immemorial Epoch, Skysplitter, and Grand Dao War.” All-things said sentimentally: “So many emperors lost their lives while the survivors chose to live reclusively.”

Several great wars had occurred in the past. It didn’t matter which side started the conflict; emperors and monarchs paid a heavy price. Nonetheless, the survivors didn’t claim to be heroes and saviors afterward.

“Brother Illumination, you’re far from being the only one to stand up against The Race and Heaven Alliance.” Skysword Dao Lord said.

Illumination had a tough time arguing against the crowd. He no longer had any supporters in the current version of Dao Alliance.

“Hahaha.” Illumination laughed and said: “It seems like we are not on the same path at all. I will not force anyone to join me.”

Having said that, he stared at Li Qiye and said: “Sir, I still stress the importance of the ancestral blood in changing the…”

Li Qiye waved his hand and said: “Since when do you get to tell me what to do with my things? If I hear another thing out of you, it won’t be just a slap, I’ll crush your head.”

Illumination staggered backward after hearing this. Even All-things trembled in fear after hearing the casual threat.

Illumination was furious but still feared Li Qiye, not daring to attack.

“So you stand on the side of Brother All-things, Sir?” He took a deep breath and asked.

“I’m not interested in joining this dog fight. You all will deal with it yourselves.” Li Qiye said: “Of course, if you think you have grown strong enough to provoke or scheme against me, I’ll be glad to show how sorely mistaken you are.”

Everyone froze after hearing this. Although Li Qiye didn’t release his aura, they felt as if their fate was within his grasp.
