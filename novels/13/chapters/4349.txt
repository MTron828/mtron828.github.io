Chapter 4350: Refinement

Explosions detonated unceasingly within the molten gates. The waves of assault were unending, the latter stronger than the previous.

“Raa!” The existence inside simply didn’t give up and left behind thousands and thousands of prints on the exterior of the gates.

However, this seal was absolute, and an escape seemed impossible.

Though spectators couldn’t see the scene inside, they could imagine the thing being burned by the dark flame from the lamp. It couldn’t extinguish this flame and had no choice but to try and break the walls.

“Boom!” One strike made a section of the wall protrude outward but it was still not enough.

The punch was insane. The gates blocked the brunt but remnant aftershocks still got out and swept everyone flying.

“How monstrous…” They were pale from witnessing the sheer power of the dark existence. Their sect wouldn’t be able to block a single move. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Raa!” The totem of a gigantic wolf above one of the gates howled. It stomped down on the wall and activated more runic chains to improve the seal.

“Whoosh!” A sharp gust seemingly came from the world’s sharpest blade. It was an ant pulsing with celestial radiance pushing its mandibles against its gate. The radiance spread to the gate and gave it immense power and weight.

“Screech!” The great eagle on another appeared divine. It spread its wings and soared upward before coming back down with full momentum, pushing its scaled claws against the gate. Loud metallic clanks could be heard.

A total of five totems appeared and formed an unbreakable alliance, rendering resistance futile. All the palm prints gradually became smaller until they disappeared completely.

“What an extraordinary treasure.” One expert sang praises of the gates.

Both members of weak and strong sects saw just how mighty the dark existence was. Alas, Li Qiye managed to imprison it.

“They are invincible.” Another sentimentally said.

They attributed Li Qiye’s success to the gates, not knowing that there was more to it.

“Boom!” The five gates became blindingly resplendent. A massive lock appeared above the cauldron-like prison and it suddenly became quieter inside.

The new suppression and the continuous burning weakened the dark existence. As time passed, the strikes became inaudible.

“Ahh!” As people watched with bated breath, they heard a scream filled with rage and indignation… This was the last sound of the battle.

“Creak…” The gates slowly opened again.

“Be careful!” The lucky survivors became startled and backed off, afraid that the dark existence was still alive and might try to feast on their vitality.

However, there was no sign of the invincible existence, only ashes. A gust of wind came in and blew them away.

“Phew.” They heaved a sigh of relief after seeing this.

They then took a closer look at the gates and the floating lamp. The latter looked old and still had a feeble black light within, only the size of a soybean. They found it hard to imagine that this lamp could burn the existence to ashes.

Those from the great powers had a better grasp of that existence than the ones from the smaller sects. This was a testament to the lamp’s destructive potential. Moreover, they also believed that this wasn’t the lamp’s fully activated state - the light in there right now appeared to be on the verge of extinguishing. There was a possibility of it being much more powerful.

Imagine if it’s mine - this was a thought shared by many and could be seen from the greed in their eyes.

Of course, they weren’t stupid enough to carry it out. After all, they saw what happened to the dark existence and didn’t want to follow its footsteps. Moreover, Chi Jinlin was on Li Qiye’s side as well.

“This isn’t over. Surrender and confess your crime or your sect will be responsible too.” Suddenly, a dignified voice erupted from above.

An invisible hand seemed to be crashing down and leaving everyone breathless.

The crowd members who had only enjoyed freedom for a moment were forced to the ground again.

“Who is it…” An elder from a small sect trembled with fear.
