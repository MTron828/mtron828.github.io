Chapter 4512: Casually Given

No one else would bid in a similar manner as Li Qiye. Alas, this seemed to be his style.

Other participants viewed this style as being malicious and overly provocative - the opposite of productive from a financial viewpoint.

Of course, the auction house would never forbid malicious bidding. It’s just that this particular one had an implicit agreement with all the big shots. Li Qiye simply chose to stir the pot.

“Hmph!” Alchemy Child uttered coldly: “What is your intention behind bidding so recklessly?!”

“As I said, he’s hired by the auction house.” One youth couldn’t help but blurt out.

This was a common notion the moment he trapped Cloudgrasp Elder into buying the void jade for an unacceptable price. Now, he once again elevated the price of the ten pills.

“Gentlemen, please mind your words.” The auctioneer became unhappy and said: “We have a gold-clad reputation and for millions of years, we have auctioned numerous valuable items that are even more precious than the ones here tonight. We do not need to resort to despicable means.”

This pertained to the grotto’s reputation so he didn’t appreciate these unwelcomed comments.

“My junior is ignorant for saying these offensive words, please forgive him.” A big shot immediately apologized.

The majority of the participants here did not want to offend such a major auction house.

The auctioneer scowled in response, showing off his dissatisfaction without pursuing the matter.

“Does it matter whether I’m working for them or not? The bid is as real as can be. If you don’t want to give up, then keep going. When no one else bids, then I’ll be paying for the item.” Li Qiye smiled.

“20,000,000,000. Any other bidder?” The auctioneer shifted the focus back to the auction. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Others exchanged glances. They thought about the smooth nature of dao cultivation with the help of the ten bottles. However, the price was unreasonable now given the massive quantity of finest-grade refined jades. The true value far exceeded 20,000,000,000 Heavenly Sovereign Refined Jades.

This was a considerable sum for any great power that exceed the bottles’ worth.

“And here I thought that even 50,000,000,000 is only a small sum for the great Three Thousand Dao. This should be even truer for True Immortal, a sect with a peerless foundation. I’m sure your sect can handle 50,000,000,000 dao lord jades, let alone this entry-level crap.” Jian Ming’s mouth spared no one.

He paused for a second before continuing: “The two of you should push the price up to 100,000,000,000 to make it grander. That bid is more fitting for people of your status.”

Cloudgrasp and Alchemy Child snorted and didn’t say anything else. They still wanted to bid but the price was too unreasonable. Moreover, they still thought that Li Qiye might be playing with them.

“20,000,000,000, sold.” The auctioneer eventually smashed the hammer and formally announced the winner.

“Wow.” Turtle-seeker became sentimental at the sky-high price. His entire sect wouldn’t be able to muster this sum.

The auctioneer then handed the ten bottles to Li Qiye. Though he hasn’t paid yet, he was on credit so he could take the items first.

Li Qiye accepted the bottles and didn’t bother to look at them before raising them in front of Turtle-seeker: “Give them to your disciple.”

“W-what?” Turtle-seeker and Wise were stunned despite being old ancestors.

“Is this a joke?” A big shot in the crowd found this unbelievable.

Both the pills and the winning bid were insane. No one here would want to hand over them to someone else, especially a stranger. Alas, this was unraveling before their very eyes, hence everyone’s astonishment.

If anyone were to offer the pills to Turtle-seeker, the latter would think that it was a cruel joke.

“F-for me?” Turtle-seeker stammered since he was overwhelmed with emotion.

“Who else but you? Your disciple needs them, no?” Li Qiye replied.

“...” Turtle-seeker had given up on the pills but here they were, right in front of him.

“I, I can’t repay you…” He spoke like a junior.

“I don’t need you to repay me, you can’t come up with 20,000,000,000 anyway.” Li Qiye chuckled.

He waved his hand and then said: “It’s no big deal, just consider it a part of fate.”

Wise regained his wits and was ecstatic for his friend: “Accept the young noble’s gift.”

Turtle-seeker eventually realized that this was actually happening. He got on his knees to show his gratitude: “If you ever need Archipelago’s assistance, just say the words and we will do everything we can.”
