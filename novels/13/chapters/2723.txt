“Just passing by.” Li Qiye unenthusiastically answered.

He let Jiahui put him down and he raised his hand.

“Buzz.” Space suddenly rotated.

One scene appeared after another as they moved around in space. No one felt that the cave was normal any longer.

Both Jiahui and the old man felt that they were traveling through different dimensions.

In reality, they didn’t move at all. Other spatial realms were simply overlapping with the cave.

Ramparts made of bronze appeared around them. This was an extremely powerful seal.

Those who touch these walls would be rendered to ashes regardless of who they are.

The old man was intimidated after seeing this seal. These spatial stacks resulting in this seal were definitely at the level of an immortal progenitor. However, one couldn’t casually perform it.

They needed to augment and refine it several times. Basically, great efforts and resources were essential. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The strangest part was that he sensed a familiar presence in this seal, allowing him to know its creator - Everlasting Forefather. This astounded him because he has been cultivating here to learn the mysteries of the system along with its merit laws.

One session lasted for numerous years but he never found this spatial stacking and the seal. Clearly, the person who left it and the one who found it were both stronger than him.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye released more flashing dao laws from his palm. They resembled a silkworm spitting out strings. Each law was profound on the same level as a supreme grand dao. They coiled together and transformed to form a peerless dao.

The old man’s eyes narrowed as he focused on deriving this grand dao. Alas, his power level couldn’t see through this law in such a short time.

More importantly, this grand dao wasn’t just old. It seemed to have escaped the five elements and the samsara cycle, meaning that it wasn’t subjected to the shackles of Tree Immortals World. Maybe it didn’t originate from here. However, the same presence of Everlasting Forefather could be detected too, even if only for a split second.

However, this youth couldn’t be Everlasting Forefather! But then, who the hell was he?

The old man had plenty of questions but he was certain about one thing - the youth had deep ties with Immortal Demon System, maybe with the forefather as well. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to concoct this aura. The latter might not be the case, but the former was virtually guaranteed.

The grand dao started turning into symbols that instantly imprinted themselves onto this area. They then melted and became one with space, seemingly making up for the previous incomplete parts.

“Clank!” One could hear an unlocking noise from shackles. The numerous seals in this area were opening up to the old man’s astonishment.

Only Everlasting Forefather should have been able to do this. Even an immortal-level progenitor would need a long time before breaking something of this level. However, Li Qiye did it so effortlessly as if he was the one who created it.

This was simply unbelievable. He started looking at the youth again, thinking that maybe he was indeed the reincarnated forefather.

Alas, this wasn’t too plausible because according to the rumors, the forefather would always reincarnate inside this cave.

He has been here for who knows how long but the forefather never happened before. But now, this guy came out of nowhere and knew the forefather’s grand dao so well - truly a shocking matter.

The old man started thinking that maybe the reincarnation spot for the forefather had changed. Of course, these were only speculations.

“Rumble!” The stacked space opened up a massive abyss that makes the old man shudder with fear.

One could easily lose their way in there and never be able to get out.

“Boom!” Li Qiye reached into this abyss. This resulted in a blinding radiance as if a world was being created there.

Immortal lights gushed out along with ancient laws. Some living creatures might be wanting to leave this abyss.

However, before these things could come out, immortal hymns started resounding. They resonated with the grand dao. Each hymn was giving birth to a peerless dao.

“Boom!” Li Qiye finally pulled back, revealing a scripture in his hand.

It exuded wondrous light, looking just like a pristine and primordial world.

People couldn’t look straight at it unless they were strong enough. The old man could see two words engraved on this scripture, made from mighty runes.

However, these ancient characters definitely didn’t belong to Three Immortals nor any world for that matter, at least in the old man’s knowledgeable mind.

“A heavenly scripture?” Alas, this didn’t stop him from knowing the value of the scripture due to an ancient legend.

Several heavenly scriptures have appeared in Three Immortals before. Their origin remained unknown.

As time passed, these scriptures disappeared from sight. People began to think that they didn’t even exist in the first place, only mere fabrication.
