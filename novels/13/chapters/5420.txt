Chapter 5421: Your Fate Is Sealed

The sky shook violently as he raised the truncheon. It carried the immensity of a divine mountain and left everyone breathless.

“Shall we?” Immensity asked Supreme.

Supreme answered with a void thrust capable of piercing through all things in this world. The hardest dao fruit and the most indomitable dao heart couldn’t stop him.

“Break!” Immensity smashed vertically without using any merit law or power, focusing on sheer weight alone while destroying all affinities along the way.

Fiery sparks splashed off the impact; each resembled a meteor smashing into Illumination Grotto. Weaker dragon lords struck by the sparks were left with bloody holes in their bodies.

Thus, combatants from both sides began to evacuate far from Supreme and Immensity’s battlefield.

These two apex cultivators no longer restrained themselves, meaning that no one nearby would be spared.

Meanwhile, Swordsea Dao Lord made his move. The glint of his sword illuminated the entire world.

The slash was on the verge of cutting through the grotto, prompting Illumination Conqueror to directly parry it with his radiant dao. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Nonetheless, the shockwaves still obliterated most of the grotto.

Illumination summoned his cauldron and released a strand of violet smoke. It separated into ten thousand dao capable of engulfing the entire illusory realm.

“Break!” Swordsea summoned an equivalent number of swords to overwhelm the dao.

Illumination gathered his dao together, turning them into the jaws of a great beast to devour the swords.

Swordsea wasted no time in summoning more. Even the strongest defense couldn’t endure the constant barrage. Each sword carried immense destruction; nothing would be left of the grotto if it wasn’t for Illumination’s defensive dao.

Black holes and void zones appeared everywhere due to their battle. Those who had never seen a top battle before couldn’t believe their eyes.

If this took place back in the upper continents, billions of mortals would have been murdered already before knowing what was going on.

“Boom!” Suddenly, the neutral All-things Dao Lord crushed his own prison and freed Ye Fantian.

The genius immediately joined the battle and began attacking Illumination’s allies.

“What’s going on?” Spectators didn’t expect this.

“The friendly facade is torn, it doesn’t matter anymore.” A dragon lord said.

“All-things!” Illumination bellowed furiously; his roar alone destroyed the nearby stars.

All-things returned to a safe location, not participating in the battle himself.

“Rumble!” Eventually, the momentum and formations of the grotto could endure no longer.

Barriers and formations crumbled before the combined might of Divine and Heaven Alliance. The gap was simply insurmountable.

Most importantly, the defenders’ morale reached a low point after seeing their leader using the immortal order with wanton regard for his own men’s safety.

Some had secretly retreated, no longer wanting to die here for Illumination’s sake. This left exploitable holes in the formational arrays.

The attackers made it inside the grotto. It was only a matter of time before a complete takeover.

“It’s over.” Immensity sighed and told Illumination: “I have tried my best, your fate is sealed.”

Having said that, he turned to leave the battlefield.

“Brother!” Illumination’s expression darkened after seeing this. Alas, his call fell upon deaf ears.

“Boom!” His momentary distraction caused him to lose an exchange against Swordsea Dao Lord.
