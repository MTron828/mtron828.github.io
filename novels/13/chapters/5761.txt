Chapter 5762: A Bet?

Eventually, the figure chose inaction and didn’t move from his expanse.

Li Qiye smirked and said: “Betting on this, I see.”

“Did you say something, Young Noble?” Ling’er looked up at him, confused.

“Nothing, I saw someone, that’s all.” He responded.

“The-there’s someone else here?” This scared her and made her look left and right, only to see no one. The coffin before them didn’t help either.

“They’re gone.” He smiled.

“Did you see a ghost?” Ling’er didn’t know that within a split second, two lords had just calculated many things while fixing gazes.

He smiled and gently patted her head: “Where are you going to find ghosts? Plus, people are scarier than ghosts anyway.”

“People are scarier?” She was surprised to hear this.

Meanwhile, the star circled the coffin repeatedly, seemingly excited. It tapped on the coffin, telling Li Qiye that something amazing was inside.

The cloud stared at the star with contempt, not wanting to be associated with this fellow.

Li Qiye answered with a smile: “Now you think the trip was worth it?”

The star nodded docilely, eager to make Li Qiye happy. He could do no wrong at the moment.

“Good things always come at a price, you better be careful.” Li Qiye said with a profound gaze.

This startled the star, causing it to stagger backward and become vigilant. It worried that he might be using it as a pawn.

The cloud sneered again as if to say that the star had no redeeming qualities outside of its existence for Li Qiye to take advantage of.

The star had enough and became infuriated, wanting to fight the cloud.

“Okay, don’t be anxious, I will open it.” He said: “You will be faced with a choice as well, are you ready?”

The star contemplated for a moment before nodding firmly.

“What about you?” He asked Ling’er.

“I am ready.” She stared at the coffin and took a deep breath.

“Creak!” The lid of the coffin was immovable for imperial-level characters but Li Qiye gradually pushed it to the side.

“Bam!” The lid fell to the ground, capable of crushing the earth.

A burst of starlight erupted along with their pleasant sounds. They saw a woman lying inside; Ling’er staggered several steps backward after seeing her face.

This was because the woman was identical to her. Ling’er had expected something like this. Otherwise, she would have thought that this was just an illusion. She covered her mouth immediately to not scream.

Of course, there was a distinct difference between the two - the woman in the coffin had a circular seal on her chest. Ling’er only had hers visible when activated by Li Qiye’s primordial light.

The woman’s seal was pulsing and surprisingly, it had an identical star to Li Qiye’s as well. His star saw this and became excited, releasing bright light.

The coffin’s star also had a distinct difference - a rune woven mysteriously into the shape of a cross was on top of its center. The rune appeared older than time itself - staring at it meant witnessing the moment of creation itself - the primordial chaos.

When one looked too long, they would find themselves witnessing their own life - from the moment of birth as a crying infant entering the world to the present.

Gazing longer could give them glimpses of the future - achieving greatness or remaining anonymous until death...

This rune wasn’t embedded with the star. Upon closer inspection, it was merely placed on top of the star and the woman.

It released starry particles onto the star, causing it to become resplendent inside the hallowed center of the seal. Was this star made from the accumulation of these particles across the eras?

Li Qiye’s star gazed excitedly at the rune and pointed at it, telling Li Qiye that this was it.

The cloud no longer had a look of disdain. It also became excited and ran around, telling Li Qiye about the rune’s extraordinary nature.

Li Qiye himself paid careful attention to the rune’s inscrutable mysteries. This was beyond the comprehension of any being in the world, Li Qiye included.

They spanned from the primordial chaos and encompassed all the epochs to the present. All existences and derivations could be found within.

“Hmm...” Li Qiye focused for a while before concluding: “It is still missing something, incomplete.”

At this moment, his star started revolving around the rune.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
