Chapter 4958: Casually Grabbing A Heavenly Weapon

“Boom!” He raised his hand and the region trembled.

Not to mention students, even teachers became alarmed because they felt a dao harmonization from the divine mountain.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” A particular treasure unleashed its oppressive divinity.

“Who got Skyquake Dao Controller?!” The schoolmaster got out of the chair in his office.

“The dao controller?” Even some ancient ancestors woke up again after sensing this.

It has not reacted to anyone ever since Jun Landu left it on the mountain. Supreme geniuses tried only to fail for eras now. Today, it was finally activated to the teachers’ and ancestors’ astonishment.

“Skyquake Dao Controller!” The students at the scene couldn’t believe it. This naturally included the trio of geniuses.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“H-h-he’s holding Skyquake!” A student stammered.

The young monarch in particular was overwhelmed with both shock and embarrassment. He has been trying to understand Skyquake this entire time.

Earlier, he was sent flying by it during the bet with Li Qiye. To put it frankly, it didn’t recognize his talent and comprehension.

This in and of itself wasn’t humiliating because he was far from being the first to fail. On the other hand, Li Qiye had successfully earned its recognition. This felt like a slap to the face for him for the young monarch.

“How can this be?” Another student said. The guy simply grabbed the controller and didn’t face any resistance. This was akin to stomping down every genius in history, especially Radiant Young Monarch.

“Maybe he’s actually a supreme genius?” Someone boldly speculated but Li Qiye didn’t resemble one in the slightest.

“There is a yin to every yang. Perhaps his ominous mouth is a curse from the heaven but on the other side, he gains a talent beyond our reach.” Someone else consoled himself by saying this.

After all, it was painful trying to comprehend these treasures to no avail. Watching someone else doing it effortlessly was difficult.

Of course, no one would recognize that they were the problem. It must have something to do with Li Qiye’s ominous curse.

“I have my weapon now, where are yours?” Li Qiye stared at the trio.

The trio had amazing weapons as well but they paled in comparison. The dao controller poured down delicate dao laws. Each was immensely profound and destructive.

“Hurry up.” Li Qiye only stared at his weapon, not his opponents.

This drove the trio crazy. They have never been disrespected in this manner since their debut. This was especially true for the young monarch. After all, he had met seven-fruit dao lords and they didn’t look down on him so blatantly.

Prior to this, students thought that it wouldn’t be hard for them to kill Li Qiye. This was no longer the case.

If Li Qiye could actually use the controller to the fullest extent, it would be rather frightening.

“Just holding the controller is a miracle given his power, there is no way he can actually use it.” Someone from Deity said. Others agreed with this sentiment.

“To death then!” Halo has been itching for a fight and didn’t analyze the situation.

“Rumble!” His weapon of choice was a disk. He raised it into the air and gathered the power of the heaven, causing him to grow larger and exude violent gales.

“Halo Disk!” Someone from Heaven Burial shouted.

“His father’s treasure.” Another said.

His father was Halo Monarch, a dragon lord with five dao fruits. He adored his son and gave him his favorite weapon.

This was one of the reasons why Halo was so arrogant. Due to his blood relationship with his father, he could fully use the disk’s power.

The blessing of the disk propelled him to a whole new level, causing students to gasp.

“Clank!” Swordgrasp’s weapon, unsurprisingly enough, was a sword.

Sword energy poured down from above like a heavenly waterfall, capable of piercing the earth and obliterating the hardest metals.

“That’s Swordgrasp’ heavenly sword.” A student from Deity became startled: “It is a symbol of the schoolmaster.”

If he was in possession of it now, it meant that he was chosen as the successor. Schoolgrasp was special since it had a direct line of communication with Divine and Heaven Alliance.

After becoming the schoolmaster, he could actually communicate with the peerless dragon lords in the upper continents - something people could only dream of.

“Hmph.” The young monarch scowled at Li Qiye and also summoned his weapon. He didn’t dare to be careless because of the dao controller.
