“I see.” Chuqing realized she misunderstood and lowered her head, blushing and embarrassed.

She became an obedient wife, closing her eyes in order to carefully sense the land.

After a long while, she opened her eyes and said with excitement: “Yes! A certain aura is echoing but I can’t really grasp it. It resembles a crisp sound.”

“Good.” Li Qiye smiled and nodded: “You didn’t waste time training in your mantra. I’ll have you know that you’re currently training in two secrets of the nine right now.”

“Two secrets?” She blurted out in astonishment: “You’re, you’re telling me that the mantra you gave me is two of the nine?!”

She hastily covered her mouth and looked around, afraid of being overheard. Fortunately, no one was around so she heaved a sigh of relief while patting her plump chest.

Li Qiye had nothing but adoration for this cute appearance: “What else could it be?”

“I, I don’t think this is proper.” Chuqing hesitated and worriedly looked at him: “You’re secretly giving me Dou and Zhe, it’ll bring a lot of trouble. I don’t want to learn it anymore.”

The nine secrets were the strongest merit laws of this system - its very foundation and core.

Everyone desired them; just one was enough.

Other people would celebrate this opportunity. It was a peerless fortune. Moreover, Liu Chuqing had trained in the word, Lin. She knew the significance of training in one.

Strangely enough, instead of rejoicing, she only felt worried because of Li Qiye.

If he were to pass these secrets of War Saint to someone else, a punishment would be in order. Even the king couldn’t do so.

In her mind, his safety far exceeded these secrets. As long as he could live a worried-free life, she wouldn’t ask for anything else.

“Why can’t I pass it to you? Don’t you want to be my wife? Then it’s a matter of course for me to give it.” Li Qiye smiled.

The girl became red from ear to ear, feeling very sweet inside when he said the word “wife”.

This address was better than all others and she loved it.

“But you still can’t pass them down.” She looked up, still worried.

She naturally knew the rules of great powers. These secret laws couldn’t be given away; no exceptions either. The consequences would be grave.

Li Qiye disagreed: “I, Li Qiye, can do whatever I want in this world. If I say yes, then it is allowed and no one can say otherwise. Plus, I’m not giving you Dou and Zhe.”

“Not those two?” She became frozen again. Everyone knew that War Saint Dynasty had access to Dou and Zhe.

“I’m giving you Qian.” Li Qiye revealed.

“Qian?!” She couldn’t stay calm: “I thought it was lost.”

Nine secrets existed in the system but only eight were known. Qian has been missing; no one has heard of anyone nor lineage possessing this particular word in the present.

Moreover, no one could materialize and derive this word from the dao land.

“That word doesn’t apply to me. I can find all that is lost without a single problem, as long as I will it so.” He casually said.

Chuqing was still shocked. She didn’t expect that she was actually training in a lost word. No one would believe her.

“Qian... it is a merit law that can boost power and allow its user to enter a crazed state?” She curiously asked.

“This is the reason why it is lost. The fools only managed to learn the bare surface, thinking that they have mastered it. Because of this, they used it repeatedly and lessened their lifespan, or even dying from implosion.” Li Qiye shook his head and laughed.

The practitioners of Qian in the past could enjoy a massive, temporary power boost. Once activated, they would fall in a state of frenzy, allowing them to defeat enemies of a higher level.

“As you comprehend the mysteries of Qian more and more, you will find that entering the crazed state is only elementary and not presentable. The true practitioners of Qian will have a heroic and fearless heart, and this will, in turn, polish your dao heart. In fact, one can say that Qian is the guiding principle of the nine secrets. After comprehending it in full, you will have a smooth-sailing to learn the other eight while lowering the risk. You will soar in the sky like a true dragon.” He elaborated.

She listened attentively and began to ponder the content in a daze. Each word was carving into her mind.

“Alright, silly girl, don’t just stand there, start comprehending the mantra.” Li Qiye pinched her nose again. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The bashful girl regained her wits and entered a state of meditation. Being around Li Qiye made her have peace of mind. That’s why she could meditate in public without any problem.

Some cultivators also spotted these two during their journey northward.

“Looks like the king’s nature is still the same and here I thought he had changed completely to focus on cultivation. He only lasted a few days, I guess mud can’t make a lasting wall.” A few people became disappointed and shook their head after seeing the two idling about.

“That’s why he lost his kingdom.” Another was much more disdainful: “Fairy Qin had no interest in him and she’s right. This piece of trash is not worth mentioning, there’s no way he can get into her sight.”

“What a pity for Waterfront Princess.” An older cultivator felt pity: “Her talents mean that she has a bright future ahead, but now, she’ll enter stagnation by hanging around with the king, bound by the marriage pact. She’s destroying her own future.”

“Right, that marriage pact is useless, she’s only doing this to herself, no need to carry out a nullified pact.” People felt sorry for her - a flower pinned in a pile of manure. Her potential wasn’t inferior to Bingchi Hanyu or even Qin Jianyao but she chose to waste it.

In fact, everyone knew that even if she didn’t hold up her end of the bargain, the king couldn’t do anything anyway.

The Bingchi sent a fake promise. Calm Lotus and Myriad Formation pretended that the pact didn’t exist without suffering any consequences. The princess of Myriad Formation and Qin Jianyao are doing just fine.

The king had nothing right now, not worthy of these ladies. Even if he were to bring up the marriage pact, he would only be asking for humiliation.

Liu Chuqing was the only one carrying it out. In the eyes of others, she wasn’t thinking straight and choosing to jump into a pit.

“In this day and age yet still upholding a promise with the weak. So, so rare, I don’t know if this is considered a virtue or stupidity.” An ancestor sentimentally said.

This choice of hers could even result in her death, marrying an insect when his enemies were the five great powers. Who would want to pay such a heavy price for the sake of a promise? The majority of cultivators certainly wouldn’t.
