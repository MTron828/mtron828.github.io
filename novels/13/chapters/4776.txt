Chapter 4777: Invincibility

“Poof!” Chaos true energy suddenly poured down and permeated the entire union. Cultivators breathed in and felt comfortable as if they were floating in an ocean of favorable energy. Training here would be ten times more effective.

“Li Qiye is coming out soon.” Ancestors and experts realized something.

“The dao source is opening again for him to come out.” A big shot stared in the direction of the fluctuation.

“Buzz.” Sure enough, primordial light pulsed from that direction and attracted everyone’s attention.

Li Qiye walked out from the radiance and it disappeared subsequently. All eyes were on him.

He looked the same as before - devoid of aura and divinity, just a regular cultivator at best. Taking account of appearance only, no one could connect him with an unbeatable cultivator who could treat dao lords like ants.

“What an incredible concealment art.” An ancient ancestor found this astonishing.

Li Qiye’s power was at the apex yet he could still hide it as if he was a mortal. It meant that he had perfect control over each strand of energy; this was as natural as breathing to him.

Nonetheless, due to their prior knowledge, spectators felt as if they were stuck in an ice cellar while being in his presence.

Geniuses and even ancestors quietly kneeled on the ground and breathed quietly without needing a word from him.

“Rise.” Li Qiye glanced at the crowd and said.

His words made them shudder. They took their time standing up in order to avoid being noisy to show respect. Most didn’t dare to stare straight at him.

“Bam!” Someone landed in front of him while concealing their own might.

He lowered his head and said: “Young Noble, please forgive our past transgression.”

This was none other than the leader of the six monarchs from Three Thousand Dao - Enveloping Monarch.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The once-dominant cultivator might not be qualified to stand before Li Qiye, let alone speak with him.

Therefore, the big shots considered his unprompted apology as being rude.

“What?” Li Qiye stared nonchalantly at him.

The gaze made the monarch feel his blood running cold. He felt that just one glance from Li Qiye could make him explode. He once stood at the top of the food chain but in reality, everyone beneath Li Qiye was all the same, just another ant.

“I humbly ask regarding what you found in the dao source.” He shuddered as he asked. He didn’t feel the same fear when he fought ancient ancestors and even Dao Sanqian in the past.

Nonetheless, he still mustered enough courage to ask. No one had a problem with his near-subservient attitude. Just being able to converse with Li Qiye was the greatest honor.

His question immediately got everyone’s attention. They all wanted to hear the answer but didn’t dare to ask. It was impressive that the monarch had the guts to do so after opposing Li Qiye earlier.

Of course, they were merely curious since the fortune in the dao source should be paramount. Moreover, they felt that whatever immortal item it was, Li Qiye was the most worthy to be its owner.

“Why should I tell you?” Li Qiye smiled.

In the past, listeners would focus on the perceived disdainful tone. Now, they felt immense pressure from a single sentence even though it was directed at Enveloping Monarch.

Li Qiye had a smile on his face instead of anger yet they felt their legs going weak. Some dropped back down to the ground and looked away.

His words alone carried enough weight to force others into submission, no need for aura or divinity.
