People had different speculations and feelings regarding Li Qiye’s entry to Ancestral. Some spread nonsensical gossip as well. Nonetheless, the fact was that Li Qiye was an esteemed guest of Ancestral. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, most knew that it became virtually impossible to capture him at this point. The city had numerous ancestors and experts at the ready.

Some have come up with plans and methods only to give up in the end. The other powers eventually retreated from the city altogether, albeit unwillingly. After all, the closer they were, the more likely they could take advantage of the situation or even capture him.

The issue was that Ancestral had increased its vigilance. The patrols became more numerous not to mention the mobilized army. Then the most important reason - their awakened forefathers.

The saintess demanded everyone to leave. It was wise to heed her warning given the circumstances.

For those daring to disobey at first, they quickly changed their tune the moment they looked up and saw the towering forefather.

Even if they were lucky enough to stay around, provoking Ancestral might result in a palm strike from this forefather. That’s enough to render their army to flesh pulps.

That’s why none wanted to take the risk. The best they could do was return to their sect and let their ancestors sneak into Ancestral.

This was the case for the three behemoths as well. They didn’t dare to antagonize Ancestral any further given the circumstances and also withdrew their troops.

“When will Yin Yang Gate make an announcement?” Someone quietly said.

In order to break the current deadlock, everyone knew that Yin Yang Gate must take charge. It was the only sect with ample power to oppose Ancestral City.

Plus, even if others had enough military forces, they didn’t have a reason to declare war. This wasn’t the case for Yin Yang.

Ancestral City broke the marriage pact and the alliance. Therefore, Yin Yang was justified in demanding an answer.

They couldn’t let go of this issue as well since it was humiliating and detrimental to their interest. They needed to make an example out of this in order to maintain their prestige in the north.

“Clank!” Today, a sword hymn emanating from Firmaments echoed across the region. A pillar of sword beam reached the deep azure and became as bright as ten suns.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The millions and millions of swords in the north hymned in harmony, whether they be hanging on their master’s waist or hidden in the storages.

Everyone could feel rippling sword waves as a visual phenomenon emerged above - a divine sword emitting terrible energy slashes. One slash alone could sever the six dao.

“So strong.” The experts noticed this and shuddered; the more cowardly type felt their legs trembling.

“Who is this?” Just the sword aura alone made people think as if they were being decapitated.

“Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign of Firmaments!” The news of this existence spread.

Meanwhile, a cut from a sword technique split the sky apart above Firmaments Gate.

“Who is that?” The young ones had no idea.

“What?! Is he not dead?!” The few ancestors knew about him and took a deep breath. One of them continued: “How is he still around? His sword dao burned back then, no chance of surviving that...”

They thought that they had misheard due to the rumors about the sovereign’s death. That’s why his appearance right now startled them.

“He didn’t die.” Someone got information from Firmaments. The sect was purposely releasing this piece of news. “The sovereign tried to reach a greater height back then, leading to the burning of his sword dao. He didn’t die from that, only needing to be in a final cultivation session. He probably broke through it to be here now.”

“The sovereign was frightening enough, how strong would he be after another breakthrough?” An ancestor became afraid.

“Maybe the strongest sword user in West King.” His friend, a high elder from a clan, replied.

A junior asked for more elaboration: “I never heard of him before.”

“The oldest ancient ancestor of Firmaments.” The high elder elaborated: “Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign is the disciple of that sect’s patriarch. He has incredible sword comprehension and earned continuous praises from Firmaments Heavenly Sovereign. He swept through his peers during his youth with his sword dao. Later on, because of his status, he rarely fought any longer. Nonetheless, people still thought that he was the strongest sword user in the north back then.”

“That strong?” The youth was impressed.

His appearance at this crucial moment was no coincidence. People couldn’t help glancing at the gigantic golem.

However, the golem forefather still closed his eyes, not affected by the rampaging sword energy. It seemed as if he was a silent guardian of Ancestral and would only retaliate against actual attackers.

“Does Firmaments want to attack Ancestral? They are so closely related and Firmaments has always been respectful before. They even listened to Ancestral’s commands many times in the past.” Another cultivator found this hard to believe.

The city was considered the ancestral ground to the golems and Firmaments was a golem sect. It became hard to know whether the sovereign came out in support of Ancestral or otherwise. Both possibilities were plausible.

“Nothing lasts forever, self-interests trump all.” The high elder put on a serious expression and continued: “The imperial treasury and the phoenix’s legacies are worth the risk. These things can elevate someone to a greater height.”

“More than that.” The ancestor smiled mysteriously and said: “There’s another matter, Firmaments might want to replace Ancestral as well. No one wants to be inferior forever.”

The group quietly pondered. Yes, this would be the best opportunity for Firmaments to rise up.

Ancestral’s reputation and role have been untouchable for the golems in history. Firmaments had no chance to change this. They might risk criticism and scorn with any attempt.

This was no longer the case. Ancestral chose to become everyone’s enemy. Plus, it had a good chance of winning because of Yin Yang Gate.
