Chapter 5017: I Am Here

Unlike the unbeatable Conceal Conqueror who didn’t mind taking action, Truth Conqueror always kept a distance from the public.

Most attributed this to her origin, that her very existence was a humiliation for Celestial Court. Thus, they could take action at any second to get rid of her.

Therefore, before possessing enough power to oppose Celestial Court, she rightfully chose to train.

Why was she in Demon despite not receiving an invitation? This question ran through everyone’s mind.

“Congratulation, Conqueror, on your fourth dao fruit.” Bloodfly said but his tone was anything but congratulatory.

“Four now.” The crowd stared at her. This was enough to threaten everyone here.

When compared to Conceal or Eight-stallion, she seemed to be lacking behind given her debut time and background.

Nonetheless, there wasn’t one standard for cultivation. From another perspective, she could be building a solid foundation and her future might be even brighter than Conceal’s.

Though some dragon lords here possessed six sacred fruits, they might not actually be able to beat her.

The reality was that dragon lords were still weaker than conquerors and dao lords. The only exceptions were unique historical figures such as Space Dragon Emperor or Ox-dragon Ancestor.

“Just a little improvement.” Truth said: “Commanding Lord, could you elaborate on this matter?”

“There is nothing to say.” A red light flashed in his eyes as he answered.

The demons and beasts felt pride because their god was still ready to face a conqueror.

The atmosphere became tense after the refusal. A commanding god versus a conqueror would be a monumental event.

“Looks like I’m not late, the party is still going.” A leisurely voice suddenly interrupted the tenseness.

Everyone looked over and saw four people. The leader of the group was an average man.

Who else could they be but Li Qiye and the youths?

“What a scene…” Goldcrest saw all the big shots and became anxious.

Ming Shi stuck out her tongue and hid behind Li Qiye. Yunyun was startled as well after seeing all the prestigious cultivators.

“Li Qiye’s here.” Everyone had heard of Li Qiye by this point.

His battle record had shocked the world - killing five dragon lords and Halo Monarch.

All eyes were on him instantly. Bloodfly God gazed at him intensely; Truth Conqueror did the same.

“Young Noble Li, I apologize for the lack of reception.” Golden Cicada rushed over to greet him.

“It’s alright, I’m only here to find someone and might ruin your party.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“You’re too funny, Young Noble.” Golden Cicada awkwardly responded.

“You’re Li Qiye?” Skystomper God took one step forward and intensified his aura, scaring all the crowd members.

“Who are you?” Li Qiye glanced at him.

“Skystomper!” He stated his title and uttered coldly: “You shall die for killing my disciple.”

“He’s Halo Monarch’s master and an ancient ancestor of Heaven Burial.” Jian Yunyun whispered.

Li Qiye waved his hand as if he understood and said: “Ah, I see, father avenging son, master avenging disciple, so common. Get in line with the rest of those who wish to kill me then.”

“The sheer arrogance, I will have your head today!” Skystomper’s aura erupted and caused waves in all four directions.

“Brother Skystomper, please calm down for now.” Golden Cicada didn’t wish for his banquet to be interrupted.

Li Qiye ignored him and came closer to Bloodfly God with immense speed.

“So the stench came from you, but you’re not who I’m looking for.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Who are you looking for?” Bloodfly God was on guard.

“That one assassin, Shadowrider.” Li Qiye nonchalantly responded.

“Shadowrider!” The crowd shouted. Their first reaction was to look behind to see if there was anyone there.

This title was nightmarish to most cultivators. Shadowrider was certainly not the strongest cultivator; many dragon lords here were stronger. Nonetheless, they were still afraid because it was virtually impossible to stop this assassin. Dying before realizing it was not ideal.

Thus, everyone became cautious; cultivation played a far minor role against this assassin.

“Young Noble Li, I’m afraid there is a misunderstanding. We are not harboring Shadowrider, our sect has nothing to do with this assassin.” Golden Cicada immediately said.

Being affiliated with Shadowrider was rather dangerous and risked becoming the world’s enemy.

“We’ll see about that.” Li Qiye smiled and asked Wild Dragon: “I heard you know a bit about this assassin.”

“And what if I do? Aren’t you that king from Eight-stallion?” Wild Dragon said.

“That’s right but I have abdicated. Just remember that if it wasn’t for my merciful nature, you would have turned into a dragon meal during the coronation.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Is that so? We’ll see about that.” Wild Dragon’s eyes turned cold with murderous intent.

“Go outside if you want to fight.” Bloodfly God interrupted: “The banquet today is to find a capable cultivator capable of solving the tablet.”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
