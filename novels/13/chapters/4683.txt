Chapter 4684: Soaring Dragon

The surging sword energy attracted cultivators nearby who didn’t want to miss a fun event.

“The vajra might be fighting the saintess’ group.” Newcomers found this astonishing.

“How strange, he has done so much for True Immortal before. Isn’t he a guest elder?” An expert said.

“It’s all because of that Darkviolet Celestial Horse Grass. Friendship doesn’t matter when it comes to something so precious.” A big shot read the situation perfectly.

The golden dragon roared while assaulting the formation.

“Go!” The saintess wasn’t intimidated and slashed straight at the sky.

Energy swords appeared along her slash. Meanwhile, the elite from True Immortal disappeared and became one with the formation.

Enough swords stacked up to become a mountain of blades obeying her wish.

“So this is a sword formation from True Immortal.” A spectator saw the blades coming for the dragon. This sword formation led by the saintess could kill an ancestor.

Nonetheless, the vajra maintained his original technique.

“Rumble!” The mountain of blades smashed into the dragon.

The impact shook the entire sword formation, causing immense instability.

“Sword Immortalization!” She roared and changed the swords into something supreme. They pierced through the sky vault.

“!!!” Spectators shuddered and felt as if their heart had just been penetrated due to the sharpness of the attack.

“Inescapable Net!” She followed the power boost with another technique. The empowered sword became murderous and destructive.

“No wonder why she is able to fight last-gen cultivators. This sword formation is frightening.” A frightened observer commented.

The first wave of swords cut the dragon’s neck, causing it to bellow in pain. The successive waves then minced it down to countless pieces.

“Ah, help!” The crowd then heard the vajra’s scream.

“The strongest vagabond still can’t take on True Immortal. They don’t even need ancestors.” Someone said.

“Only ancient ancestors can stop her. This formation had killed numerous ancestors before.” A big shot shook his head.

“Isn’t this vajra too weak? Not even one move?” Jian Ming murmured.

“Just watch.” Li Qiye smiled.

Since the golden dragon has been taken down, everyone believed that the vajra has lost after one move.

“Soaring Dragon!” The vajra shouted.

The saintess had also thought that the battle was over. Nonetheless, she also reacted quickly and used the same move: “Inescapable Net!”

The waves of swords appeared again and thrust forward.

“Raa!” This time around, the golden dragon penetrated the grand dao and reached the sword formation itself.

“Boom!” The formation collapsed like a broken mountain. The elites from True Immortal fell to the ground, screaming and vomiting blood.

The waves of swords turned back fast enough to destroy the dragon. Unfortunately, it had managed to hit the saintess with its claw.

“Ugh!” She was sent flying, seriously wounded.

The vajra showed mercy and held back. Otherwise, that claw could have obliterated her upper torso.

True Immortal lost in the blink of an eye. Most spectators didn’t see how the vajra managed to pull a reversal and break the sword formation.

“I got lucky and won by half a move. Do you have anything else to say, Virtuous Niece?” The vajra smiled.

“I have no complaints, Senior. We are not your match.” The saintess stared at him and gave up. He was clearly stronger and merely feigned weakness for a bigger opening.

“Dao Brother, bullying a bunch of juniors? How shameful.” A calm yet imposing voice interrupted them.

Everyone looked over and saw an old swordsman arriving. His aura was righteous and grand.

“The sect master of True Immortal!” A spectator shouted.

The saintess and the other members got up and bowed despite their injuries.

“It’s nice to see you.” The vajra smiled sincerely as if he was meeting an old friend.

“Dao Brother, you’ll have to ask my sword first before leaving with this grass.” The sect master smiled back. Though he spoke politely, everyone felt threatened by his mere presence.

“You’re making this difficult for me.” The vajra put on a pained expression: “My little girl truly needs it, show mercy this one time?”

“This grass has three million years of medicinal accumulation, we need it as well.” The sect master shook his head.

The crowd became excited because a battle between these two was absolutely worth watching.

“We’ve been friends for so long, I can’t believe that our bond might be broken over this…” The vajra sentimentally spoke and then suddenly: “Soaring Dragon!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Raa!” A golden dragon lunged for True Immortal Sect Master, wanting to claw him apart.

“How shameless!” Spectators became astounded by the sudden attack.

“Bring it.” True Immortal Sect Master wasn’t surprised.

“Clank!” He released his sword dao and boosted the energy swords just like the saintess did earlier with her formation.

“Pluff!” The slash instantly disemboweled the dragon.

“He made it look so easy…” A spectator said. That slash was mighty but that still ended quicker than expected.
