Mu Yalan looked over at Li Qiye before nodding at Huang Quanwei: “Please go ahead, Brother Huang.”

She ultimately decided against taking any risk based on the given information.

“Very well, I’ll start.” Quanwei sneered at Li Qiye again, quite pleased with himself.

He took out a pouch of various poisons: “Elder, it might be painful, I will need you to bear it.”

“Don’t worry, Virtuous Nephew. This old bones of mine can handle it.” The elder said.

Quanwei chose a bottle of ointment and began applying on the wound. The elder felt a cool sensation, all the pain have disappeared.

“Virtuous Nephew, this is an amazing ointment, removing the pain torturing me for several days now.” The elder became astonished.

“This is Black Jade, an antidote personally created by me. Any other poison would be cured right away.” Quanwei said.

“Brother Huang, you can actually make it?” Yalan was surprised as well.

The formula for Black Jade had been lost long ago; even their valley only had an incomplete scroll. Plus, the disciples here didn’t focus on poison too much, not caring to research it any further.

“Yes, I looked through so many texts before finding a way to make up for the missing pieces. This Black Jade of mine can cure anything.” Quanwei’s ego was being fed in full right now after seeing her surprised expression.

“Your poison mastery is indeed peerless.” She praised.

“No way, it is inferior compared to your medicinal abilities.” Quanwei responded. His mood couldn’t be better right now.

Nevertheless, he didn’t stop and took out several needles and inserted into the elders’ important meridians.

“Now!” He shouted and his needles lit up. Under his empowerment, black lines appeared around the elder’s body - the remnant poison.

The old man started to twitch, clearly feeling the pain from this process. Alas, he didn’t groan even once.

These black lines were forced into the chest area. Quanwei was fast and added more needles into the chest cavity, sealing the poison there. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, his Black Jade ointment was doing work as well. The wound gradually turned white with smoke coming out.

The elder was drenched in sweat but he felt much better than before as if the poison was being removed.

“I’m so impressed right now, you expelled this poison so easily!” He excitedly said.

“Not yet, this is only removing the hidden poison from your system. In order to cure it completely, we need other medicines.” He humbly said but his slightly smug expression told the tale.

“Of course, I was saved the moment you got here.” The elder was all-smiles, happy at the thought of being free from this terrible poison.

“Elder, hold on a while longer, the next step will be very painful.” Quanwei took out a bottle.

“Your bottle will end his life.” Li Qiye warned before Quanwei could use it.

This got the attention of both Quanwei and Yalan.

“Hmph, do you know what you’re saying? This is an antidote, why would it take his life? Don’t be ridiculous now.” Quanwei’s eyes turned cold as he spewed out aggression.

“Virtuous Nephew is indeed saving my life, not the opposite, don’t speak nonsense now.” Elder Yang was unhappy and would have shouted at Li Qiye if he wasn’t the First Disciple.

“Just a charlatan.” Li Qiye calmly said.

“What do you mean?” Yalan looked at him and said.

“The right medicine for the right illness, anything else is risking people’s lives.” He smiled in response.

“The right medicine?” Quanwei raised his voice: “The poison is from a Devilclaw Louse, a creature near a volcano containing true fire in its poison, rendering the veins. This bottle is a mix of Centurial Icelotus and Deepwater Glacier, perfect ingredients versus this poison. If this isn’t right, then what is?!”

“Brother Huang’s explanation is logical, do you have something else in mind, Senior Brother?” Yalan nodded in agreement and asked.

“Virtuous Nephew, I believe in your skill, no need to listen to someone else’s nonsense, please start.” The elder unhappily said.

“If the elder wishes for it, then please go ahead.” Yalan then told Li Qiye: “Senior Brother, please don’t disturb him during the process.”

Yalan had nothing against Li Qiye but she didn’t wish for any interruption.

Li Qiye simply smiled and didn’t bother explaining. Miaozhen did the same, waiting to watch the fun.

“Elder, I’m starting.” Quanwei said with a serious expression.

“Go for it, Virtuous Nephew.” Elder Yang was mentally prepared. [1]

Quanwei opened the bottle and scattered the medicine on his chest. Sizzle and smoke came out as if something was burning.

The elder had a twisted expression from the pain with sweat all over. There was no doubt that this process was excruciating. He tried his best while biting down in order to not scream.

As more medicine was poured on top, the black wound became gradually fainter before disappearing altogether. The poison has been cured.

Blood finally came out of the wound and Quanwei put away the bottle while heaving a sigh of relief: “Alright, you’ll be able to get up soon.”

At this moment, the elder was struggling for breath. It took a while before he regained his wits and felt comfortable like never before.

“You’re a miracle doctor, I will forever remember this debt.” The elder got up and cupped his fist.

“I have learned from your poison mastery today, Brother Huang.” Yalan praised as well: “This is a huge weight off my back now that the elder is fine.”

“It is my honor to help you, Junior Sister.” Quanwei said right away.

Yalan nodded. This whole ordeal has been quite stressful since she couldn’t come up with an antidote.

“Senior Brother, do you still have any pointer?” The successful attempt left Quanwei complacent, no giving a damn about this First Disciple.

Li Qiye still had a faint smile on his face.

“Poison mastery is a complex art, not just anyone can learn it.” Quanwei thought the lack of response meant fear: “In the present day, no one is my match when it comes to this art. Trying to do so would only be ignorantly displaying one’s slight skill before an expert.”

Quanwei was one-step short of pointing his finger at Li Qiye and scolding the guy. Strangely enough, Li Qiye was rather docile and only stood there.

“Ah!” Elder Yang suddenly dropped on the bed and began twitching again.

Earlier, he didn’t scream a single time like a real man during the healing process. But now, he constantly bellowed in pain. One could only imagine what he was going through.

“Elder!” The group was shocked to see this.

His face became whiter with a mist appearing around him and exuding a chilling aura to everyone nearby.

“What’s going on?” Quanwei was caught off guard.

Yalan sealed the elder’s meridians again with lightning speed. She fed him an emergency pill in order to protect his veins and true fate.

“Help, help me...” The elder could finally speak again but he seemed to be at his last gasp, unable to say anything afterward. The twitching intensified along with the cold aura.
