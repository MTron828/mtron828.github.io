Chapter 5670: Above The High Heaven?

Plowing as a dao seemed to be working for the man and his ox - an eternity of carefree comfort. Everything was under their feet as they tilled the field.

Li Qiye sat down on the field ridge, observing the act.

The man noticed Li Qiye and wanted to stop but he waved his hand, gesturing for the session’s continuation.

The man and the ox seemed busy yet not. The hardship of the labor and the poverty of farming didn’t exist, allowing them to plow at a leisurely and meticulous pace.

The mud field resembled a work of art, containing natural layers of the dao.

“Plowing heaven and earth to cultivate the dao.” Li Qiye found this marvelous and smiled: “You’ve reached it after so many years.”

“This is only a minor comprehension, the young ones are too amazing nowadays, your disciple can’t keep up.” The man shook his head in response.

“It’s irrelevant to talk about speed when the dao is just starting. Everyone believes that emperors stand at the apex and that’s the end of the dao, certainly not true.” Li Qiye smiled.

“A lifetime spent only to be at the elementary level, I am ashamed.” The man responded.

“You are not the most talented nor do you possess the highest level of comprehension among the emperors, but where are those geniuses greater than you now?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I feel a bit more at ease after listening to you, Teacher. Is this a little pathetic?” The man smiled.

“The thickness of one’s dao determines how far they can go.” Li Qiye said: “Don’t rush for quick achievements because slower progress might take you farther. This is an incredibly long road, a test of endurance and willpower. Blindly rushing forward may lead one astray into bypaths and deviant dao. Failing to guard the dao heart and everything previously became meaningless.”

“Yes, Teacher.” The man said: “It’s just that recently, age is catching up to me and the young ones are going to overtake me soon. I’m feeling like I’m being left behind by the era.”

Li Qiye shook his head: “If you’re already struggling because of age, what am I going to do? I would have one foot in the grave already in that case.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“When you put it that way, maybe I have been overly dramatic.” The man paused for a moment before laughing.

“You’re already remarkable, the dao doesn’t have to be dazzling, the only thing that matters is how far you can go. By attempting to go fast, you will end up forgetting and leaving things behind.” Li Qiye said.

The man sighed sentimentally and said: “You’re always right, Teacher. Before I know it, eras have gone by and my memories become hazy.”

“That’s why it is fine to pause and reflect, think about when you had just started with cultivation and when you reached the peak. What path do you want to take in the future and would it let down your young self?”

“Don’t forget the original aspiration to reach the destination. Teacher, I still remember our first encounter.” The man pondered in silence before remarking.

“Yes, it has been a long time.” Li Qiye sighed and said: “Did anything change?”

“No, Teacher is still the same.” The man blurted.

“And you’re still you, and this shows that everything is okay, your path has never been wrong. This journey is worth continuing and you can stick to your original aspiration.” Li Qiye said.

“I dare not to forget your teachings.” The man said: “Maintaining the dao heart is the only way to move forward.”

“We have come to understand after so many battles. Who are we fighting against? The enemies? Heaven and earth? No, just ourselves.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, our dao heart.” The man nodded.

“Disasters originate from us, depending on how long we can persevere.” Li Qiye said.

“Right, if everyone can just hold onto their beliefs at the apex, then there wouldn’t be earth-shattering battles or contests between light and darkness. Everything comes down to holding on and letting go.” The man said.

“You all didn’t eliminate him because he was a monster but because he had let go. If you had let go as well and joined him, there wouldn’t have been a war.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Holding on is difficult while letting go is so easy.” The man couldn’t help but say.

“Difficult indeed.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Teacher, what if I can’t reach the end and see the other shore?” The man asked.

Li Qiye gazed at him and earnestly replied: “Is that the most important thing? No, and you know this too. As you stand there, ask yourself whether you have any regrets or have you forgotten the real you?”

“I haven’t forgotten.” The man responded.

Li Qiye clapped his hands and said: “That’s enough then. At the end of the dao, we will still be eighteen with the passion of youth.”

“Passion of youth? Well said, Teacher.” The man said.

“This is why the fallen ones have no problem with eating an epoch and countless inhabitants. Their blood had gone cold and they became ageless monsters without their original aspiration.” Li Qiye said: “We must persevere because this gives our lives meaning. We won’t be reduced to living shells and deviate from our actual goals. The other shore can’t be reached when our path is slanted.”

“Yes.” The man said softly.

“The reason and cause do not matter. When one falls, they will have already lost the qualification to reach the other shore. Their power and lifespan matter not for their journey had lost its meaning. It’ll just be aimless wandering afterward.” Li Qiye said.

“How far can they go while wandering aimlessly?” The man asked.

“Endless the dao but the farthest location is often none other than the dao heart.” Li Qiye smiled.

“And how do we get there?” The man asked.

Li Qiye glanced upward for a second before replying: “Perhaps it originates from the high heaven.”

“From the high heaven.” The man looked at the sky as well.

“What is above the high heaven?” He asked next after a while.

Li Qiye only smiled in response.

“You are still searching for an answer, Teacher.” The man sighed.

“Everyone needs an answer, but most stop at where they start or even regress.” Li Qiye said.

“The high heaven is the farthest location, so aimless wandering won’t take one there.” The man murmured.

“You understand it well. Being fallen means unable to reach the other shore, if that’s the case, they no longer have the qualification to replace it.” Li Qiye nodded.

“A true dilemma for the fallen overlords.” The man said.

“It is too late once they know this and want to fix the path. Not everything can be restarted, especially a shattered dao heart, infinitely more challenging than restarting cultivation.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand.” The man listened attentively.

“Thus, there is no problem cultivating this field. It’s not a matter of the era abandoning you or you abandoning the era.”

“Which is better?” The man smiled.

“Think what you must so that your heart is at ease. As long as the dao heart is there, the rest isn’t worth mentioning.” Li Qiye said.

“I am enlightened once more, Teacher.” The man bowed deeply.
