Chapter 4681: Primordial Union

“We’re entering.” Li Qiye told the duo while gazing at the gate.

“Right, right.” Jian Ming and the daoist immediately followed him. This was the only way for them to enter since they lacked the right qualifications. Of course, they wanted to see what was inside.

“Buzz.” All three crossed through the gate and traveled through several dimensions before reaching what seems to be the other shore.

They saw a blue sky and beautiful mountains. Everything here seemed to be surrounded by rocks with no end in sight.

The tallest peak reached the azure itself. Galaxies and stars circled around it in a magnificent manner. Its nearby brethren were almost as impressive. The clouds only reached the ridge.

There existed an ecosystem at the pinnacle with lush vegetation, waterfalls, and rare creatures.

This gave the duo the impression that they have traveled to a primal world, still pristine and unstained by men.

They took a deep breath and found the air brimming with sweet chaos true energy. They took their time appreciating this atmosphere.

Back in Eight Desolaces, chaos true energy required time to gather and refine. This applied to the richest vein with the thickest density of chaos true energy belonging to any of the behemoths. This place only required breathing to sense and absorb this type of energy.

In other words, the energy in Eight Desolaces was akin to the broth of a large pot boiled with a small chunk of meat. The result became so bland with a barely discernible hint of meat, essentially no different from water. In this dimension, the meat was all used for a small bowl of soup, resulting in a thick and flavorful broth.

This meant that cultivation was rather easy here. A few people immediately felt a boost to their dao simply by entering. Bottlenecks became easier to break.

“Incredible density of chaos true energy.” The daoist breathed in repeatedly and smacked his lips, savoring the sensation.

“I never want to leave this place.” Jian Ming greedily did the same thing.

As for Li Qiye, he relaxed and felt the beat of this world. It was barely there but he could sense it. He matched its rhythm and became one with it.

The duo also took note of this. There were no visual phenomena around Li Qiye but they felt that he was melting away. This felt so real and illusory at the same time, perhaps shifting back and forth between the two planes of existence.

“One year here is the same as ten years outside.” Jian Ming got the urge to start training.

“Keep in mind that the ancestors of the olden days didn’t come here to cultivate.” The daoist responded.

Jian Ming nodded in agreement: “Yes, they wanted to live longer, hence the nesting process.”

As the group was talking, a buzz sounded nearby. A beam shot to the sky and turned into waves of light. The waves came together to wrap around an ancestor like a cocoon.

“Another ancient ancestor found a nest.” An old cultivator said after witnessing this.

“So that was a spot.” Many big shots became envious.

“Entering the dao source to model the grand dao and in this process obtain the primordial.” Li Qiye commented.

“How many can actually do this? Doing so would mean gaining rebirth one generation after another.” The daoist smiled wryly.

“Our four clans believe that once we enter the gate, we’re already in the dao source.” Jian Ming said.

“There is nothing wrong with that statement.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Being in the dao source is one thing but how do we connect with it? Being here is useless without this connection.” The daoist said.

“That’s the first goal of the old ancestors.” Jian Ming said.

“Nesting is one way to connect to the dao source. Of course, the majority of people come not to model the grand dao, only for a longer lifespan.” Li Qiye said.

“It makes sense, those who can enter are already up there in age with no lifespan left. They can’t miss an opportunity like this.” Jian Ming replied. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Doing this seems to be going against the original aspiration of the union.” The daoist said while looking at the cocoon.

Though this was considered a dao source, connecting with it was far from easy. The top ancestors would use their peerless merit laws and their understanding of the grand dao to guess the dao runes, hoping to activate and find a dao source. After would be the connecting process.

One method was through the cocoon technique, meaning that they would nest within the dao source. With that, they used the pure energy of the dao source to accumulate lifespan.

This wasn’t the case long ago. People once came here to perfect their grand dao via understanding ancient profundities. As time passed, the shift went from improvement into nesting for lifespan.

“Not everyone has forgotten.” The daoist said: “Dao Sanqian during his youth obtained primordial truths here, hence his current achievements.”

“That’s just a rumor, he himself has never admitted it.” Jian Ming said.

The scholar stared at him and said: “If you have found a method to become unbeatable for generations, would you let anyone else know?”

“Uh… you’re right, I would deny this every time.” Jian Ming had no retort.

“That’s why I’m sure he obtained something here.” The daoist laughed.

“Obtaining the primordial is easier said than done. If he had done that, he would be truly unbeatable. What he got was nothing more than the bare surface.” Li Qiye smile and shook his head.

The daoist quietly commented: “The ancestors have given up on this goal, only wanting more years. Reaching the primordial is left for the young generation.”

“Haha, I don’t think youths care either, they want to find expensive and rare alchemy materials, why bother waste time searching for something with potentially zero yields.” Jian Ming responded.
