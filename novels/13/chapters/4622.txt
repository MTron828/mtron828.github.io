Chapter 4623: Contemptuous

True Immortal Spirit stopped and perused the scene before focusing on Li Qiye.

Everyone scanned by his gaze felt their scalp tingling. His vision alone seemed to have cut off a layer of skin from their head - not the most pleasant sensation to have.

His sharp gaze nearly had physical reactions. This was even before the activation of his power or most would be immobilized right now.

His eyes became intense as they latched onto Li Qiye. Many trembled in fear after sensing his wrath. Alas, the heart-piercing gaze didn’t affect Li Qiye in the slightest. The latter patted his chest as if wanting to wipe off some dust.

This act seemed disrespectful as if implicating the True Immortal Spirit’s gaze was somehow dirtying him.

“You insulted True Immortal earlier?” True Immortal Spirit’s calm voice was commanding and oppressive.

“And?” Li Qiye smiled.

True Immortal Spirit narrowed his eyes, only increasing the pressure. Some of the weaker cultivators nearly dropped down on their knees. It was solely focused on Li Qiye. Otherwise, it might have made others vomit blood.

“Insulting True Immortal is a serious offense.” There was something menacing about the genius’ voice, reminding listeners of how death could happen at any moment.

“Doesn’t seem like a big deal.” Li Qiye casually responded. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Listeners took a deep breath and talked among themselves.

“Insulting True Immortal and then doubling down on it in public, that’s suicidal.” A youth whispered.

Li Qiye’s arrogance was truly unfathomable. No, at this point, it had to be described as “contempt” for the behemoths.

Everyone here chose their words carefully when talking to members of True Immortal, not wanting to offend them. Now, Li Qiye chose a more cavalier approach.

“Does he not care about his clan?” A clan member said.

“This is nothing for him. Do you not know that he killed Six-winged Emissary in front of True Immortal Sect Master?” Someone who visited Yin Yang Crossing said.

Those nearby heard this and became astounded. True Immortal would never let this go. Who could endure the humiliation and the direct challenge to one’s authority?

“He’ll die a graveless death.” Someone speculated: “They’ll massacre his clan too.”

“It’s not that simple. Li Qiye has Lion’s Roar and Ancestral Divine Temple behind him.” A big shot whispered.

This was worthy of ponderance. It seemed that the two sides were rather competitive.

“No wonder why he’s so bold.” An expert realized.

True Immortal Spirit’s expression was as cold as can be. Even a mud Buddha could become angry once pushed enough, let alone a member of True Immortal having been subjected to this level of contempt.

It was commendable enough for him to hold back. Someone else in the sect might have screamed and tried to obliterate Li Qiye.

“I will give you one last chance, apologize to True Immortal.” He uttered coldly.

All eyes were on Li Qiye. This wasn’t an unreasonable request - just a mere apology. True Immortal was showing mercy by allowing Li Qiye to do so.

However, Li Qiye waved his hand as if swatting a fly and said: “You think too highly of your sect. Leave before I send you to hell.”

Gasps could be heard among the crowd afterward.

“This is more than just offending them now.” One cultivator was shocked.

“How arrogant for Li Qiye to make this claim. True Immortal Spirit is one of the six prodigies.” An expert said.

“He can do it, I’m sure. He killed Six-winged Emissary without exerting that much effort.” Someone else said.

“He might be strong but True Immortal has ancestors and most importantly, monarchs. Why would one be impetuous enough to go against them for no reason?” A last-gen member added.

Virtually everyone agreed with this. True Immortal had plenty of geniuses and no lack of experts. Their monarchs were unstoppable as well.

“I see.” True Immortal Spirit’s eyes became cold enough to freeze people.

Spectators couldn’t bear this chilling aura; their teeth started chattering. Weaker cultivators dropped down on their butt.

“Let’s see what you can do then.” He said menacingly.

“Buzz.” Rays appeared behind him, each seemed capable of starting and illuminating a new world.

“Worldraiser Scripture.” An ancestor recognized the merit law right away.

“He actually mastered a dao lord merit law?” A high elder found this surprising.

This scripture was left behind by the second dao lord of True Immortal - Worldraiser.
