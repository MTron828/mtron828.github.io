Chapter 814: Jian Wushuang’s Arrival

After returning from the Ox-Herder’s imperial palace, Li Qiye had been staying at the Tie Clan the whole time. Outside of chanting to the old monument outside of the mansion, he had been training as well.

He would also occasionally teach the old turtle a thing or two about cultivation. Although the old turtle was a Heavenly Sovereign, calling his merit law as an indescribable, chaotic mess was not an exaggeration.

There was no other way. He was a vagabond cultivator with a lowly origin. His merit laws were all either stolen or found. Moreover, they weren’t great merit laws to begin with.

It could even be said that it was a miracle for him to reach his current level. Any other cultivator would have already suffered from qi deviation long ago.

Li Qiye could only make this comment: “You had a good river gestating you. If this wasn’t so, then you would have died countless times over.”

It was impossible for the old turtle to completely change his merit laws outside of completely restarting his cultivation, which required destroying his current dao foundation and cultivation. However, he was quite old. Destroying his cultivation was the same as taking his life. He would immediately die from old age, so Li Qiye could only mold his incorrect training methods.

As for Tie Lan, Li Qiye was too lazy to care about her. Whether she cultivated to enter the dao or not was not important to him. He had given her the merit law, the rest was up to her.

Tie Lan was also a cold person with an unyielding stubbornness. She remained unwelcoming towards Li Qiye’s stay at the Tie Clan and never gave him a friendly gaze. She never went to him to ask questions about cultivation either.

Of course, she was puzzled by Li Qiye’s actions. If, say, he was here for her clan’s treasures, then he should be searching around the Tie Clan. However, he didn’t try to search in any of the broken pavilions or buildings.

He only did one thing at the Tie Clan, preach at the ancient monument of their clan. This was quite ridiculous. Preaching an entire day to a monument — if any outsiders saw this, they would assume that he was mentally ill.

On one day, after finishing his daily preaching, Tie Lan came. She looked at him a bit with her usual ice-cold demeanor: “Someone is here for you!”

Having said that, she stood to the side without saying anything else.

Jian Wushuang came in right after Tie Lan, still as beautiful and charming with that air of arrogant nobility as always. No matter the time and location, she would resemble a phoenix showing off its most gorgeous feathers; no matter the time and location, she was always confident and arrogant like this.

This was Jian Wushuang. If there was one day when she didn’t display this imperious aura, she would cease to be herself!

Tie Lan couldn’t help but take a better look at Jian Wushuang. Although she was a mortal, she also had experience on the battlefield and had even become a general at a young age. Thus, she was naturally very confident as well.

However, Tie Lan’s cold and confident demeanor was overshadowed by Jian Wushuang’s temperament. She was inferior to Jian Wushuang in both looks and aura.

“You found me so quickly.” Li Qiye smiled; he was surprised to see Jian Wushuang here at the Beast Realm.

Jian Wushuang looked at him and said: “I have always valued time! When are we going to the Bi’an Beastworld?” She went straight to the point without any unnecessary blabbering.

“This matter can’t be rushed.” Li Qiye brought her into the Tie Clan. When there was only the two of them left in the room, he sat down and looked at her: “The pathway to the beastworld will take some time to open. But first, I need to touch your body a bit.”

“Touch my body?” Jian Wushuang immediately glared at him with her never-changing and aggressive demeanor. Of course, she didn’t misunderstand what he meant.

“Hmm, I’m afraid you won’t dare to face it.” Li Qiye touched his chin before speaking: “I have to let you know beforehand, this process is very painful. Will you be able to withstand it?”

“Just reveal the alteration.” She leered at him. In fact, back during her oath with Li Qiye, she was already mentally prepared.

Li Qiye slowly said: “In terms of physical conditions such as talents, aptitude, and merit laws, very few youths can compare to you! However, I want to turn you into an unprecedented divine general, thus I will have to change you. Are you interested?”

“I suppose you can train me into an Immortal Emperor.” Jian Wushuang proudly smiled. [1. Left out one line here: “Her smile was still beautiful and charming as before”. We see this line a lot with female characters. I’m not sure if it adds anything at all. Do comment whether you want to see these lines kept in or omitted within reasons.]

Li Qiye’s initial annoyance at Jian Wushuang’s arrogance had turned into appreciation. He shook his head and smiled: “You are not only arrogant but ambitious as well! Alas, you were born in the wrong era since this Heaven’s Will belongs to me.”

“Then how about an existence capable of challenging Immortal Emperors?” Jian Wushuang aimed to challenge Li Qiye. Although she had pledged loyalty to him, it didn’t mean that she couldn’t challenge him.

Li Qiye smiled at her provocation and responded: “An existence capable of challenging Immortal Emperors, huh? Definitely possible and I shall do so!”

“That’s more like it.” She was satisfied with this answer. Coming from the Jian Clan, she naturally had wise masters. However, after witnessing Li Qiye’s heaven-defying means, she had a different view on Li Qiye from then on; from that point onward, everything Li Qiye said sounded quite compelling.

Li Qiye shook his head: “You misunderstood something. What I meant was, if you put in the effort, then you can challenge Immortal Emperors. However, these are emperors of the past — ordinary emperors. But me? Impossible. I shall be the Eternal Prime Emperor!”

“Stop bragging.” Jian Wushuang coldly glared at him. Although she wasn’t quite sure of the authenticity of his declaration, she hesitated to flatly reject it as well.

“You will see.” Li Qiye didn’t mind: “However, if you want the power to challenge emperors, then you must be prepared. This will not be easy. You will need a firm dao heart and outstanding persistence. It is impossible to succeed in a short period of time.”

“Just say it, what do I have to do?” She was completely confident as always.

“The first thing I want to do is to change your true fate weapon.” Li Qiye solemnly stated: “Will you be able to accept that?!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression quickly changed upon hearing this. She was not a beginner at cultivation. She was quite powerful already and would reach the Virtuous Paragon realm in a short amount of time.

A powerful cultivator of this level would already have a sufficiently strong true fate weapon. In Jian Wushuang’s case, her weapon had been through enough tempering and was mighty enough.

“You should know that my true fate weapon was crafted from a nine heavenly accumulations stone. There is nothing better than it in this world.” Jian Wushuang responded with a serious tone.

Li Qiye replied with a smile: “You are erroneous about this matter. There is no good or bad destiny stones, only the most suitable one.”

Having said that, Li Qiye looked at her again: “You must change if you want to follow the path of your forefather, Immortal Emperor Diyi Jian. You must understand that although your true fate weapon is related to the bow, even if it was more powerful, it would not allow you to reach the end of the road.”

“Cultivation is different for everyone. Some reach the extreme from a singular sphere while others take in everything to reach the same peak. You? You must go on the path of one and from one to reach the zenith!” Li Qiye solemnly said: “If you want to surpass your forefather, you must use purity to reach the top with the bow alone in your heart and solely the arrow in your life. Only with this would you be able to transcend. Otherwise, you will never be able to surpass your forefather!”

Jian Wushuang turned silent after hearing this. She had many wise teachers from her imperial lineage, but even their God-Monarchs couldn’t clearly explain this path. This was due to the fact that even Immortal Emperor Diyi Jian couldn’t reach the end. The future of this path was full of unknowns.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but say: “What kind of stone are you replacing mine with? It is very difficult to find a stone that relates to the bow, not to mention one that could surpass the Nine Words True Bow.”

In fact, she loved the bow after receiving it. She was determined to use all of her effort to refine this bow for the rest of her life!

The Jian Clan was known as the best archery clan. They had countless bow artifacts, and the strongest was the emperor’s bow. However, this bow belonged to the emperor, so if the clan’s descendant wanted to surpass their forefather, they must refine a bow that belonged to them and them alone!

She understood the moment she held the Nine Words True Bow that it would surpass her forefather’s bow. Even though it was not a true treasure, she already considered it to be the most important weapon in her arsenal! It was ranked even higher than her true fate weapon.

“I’ve already picked one for you.” Li Qiye took out a destiny stone and handed it to her: “I plan for you to replace it with this stone. You can start refining it now if you’re ready.”

In the past, Li Qiye had taken many destiny stones from the Prime Ominous Grave. Many among them were nine accumulations stones.

“This destiny stone only has one heavenly accumulation!” Jian Wushuang took a look and was not happy at all.
