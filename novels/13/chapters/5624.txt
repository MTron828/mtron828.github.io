Chapter 5625: Long Time No See

Who else could it be but Li Qiye?4

He walked into the supreme domain and spectators thought that he was about to be reduced to a puddle of blood.0

“Boom!” The shockwaves of both combatants immediately attacked the intruder in unison.0ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Just these remnants waves could sweep through ten million miles, flattening mountains and overturning oceans.0

“Bam!” Light radiated from Li Qiye for a second and the waves did nothing to him.0

Heaven and earth followed his step; the yin and yang prostrated in submission; the reincarnation cycle halted. Three thousand worlds and a dao source could manifest into reality due to his whims.0

His existence reigned dominant over all else. Emperors and monarchs, supreme existences and eternal overlords - none could stop his stride.0

The immensity of the earth was as feeble as a window screen made of paper. The strongest cultivators would go down like spiderwebs beneath his foot.0

He entered the match and the planetary pieces became as insignificant as dust specks. He casually gathered the karmic forces of the emperors. Their previous contributions and auspicious karma gathered into a single piece.0

“Bam!” Everything was decided the moment he placed the piece on the imaginary board.0

Titanic’s incalculable weight and Demon’s eternal momentum exploded afterward. Next was the collapse of Titanic’s primordial power channeled from her fruit along with Demon’s peerless anima control.2

The endless karmic cycle overwhelmed the two apex cultivators and sent them flying.0

They flew through several dimensions before managing to stabilize their stance. This development naturally astounded them.0

Who could take control of their karma and use it against them in just a short time? That was an unbeatable attack.2

“What the hell?” Spectators below became slack-jawed.4

For most cultivators, emperors and conquerors stood at the top of this world. As for Titanic and Demon, these two were unreachable and enjoyed the scene at the apex. 0

Even imperial-level characters felt that there was an insurmountable gap between them and these apex cultivators. However, they were made to look like mayflies versus Li Qiye’s single move.0

When Demon took a close look at Li Qiye, her eyes became resplendent and shiny like two jewels. The reflection resembled the prettiest color of life.0

She smiled radiantly and her melancholic aura temporarily disappeared, looking like a girl seeing a family member after a long time. The smile could warm the heart like the coming of spring, melting winter snow away.0

“Your Excellency!” Demon couldn’t help but shout. Her smile said it all about her current state of mind - nothing but pure happiness.0

Li Qiye smiled after seeing her in person as well. She immediately rushed into his open arms.0

“It's really you, Your Excellency.” She was overwhelmed emotionally; tears of happiness streamed down her cheeks, having the same shine as diamonds.0

“Long time no see, little one.” He sighed and wiped her tears away.1

“It’s been too long, Your Excellency.” She buried her head into his chest. Life suddenly became beautiful and joyful again.0

The dao road she experienced was lonely - a true mental tribulation. Nonetheless, this was all worth it for this single moment.0

“I didn’t think I would be able to see you again, Your Excellency, that it wasn’t meant to be.” Xu Xinjie was the little girl from the Xu back in the nine worlds.0

The chaos and merciless wars during the dark ages traumatized her. Her mental instability and suffering prompted Li Qiye to seal her under Godwar Mountain and leave behind a great fortune as well.9

When she woke up, she gained two masters - Golden Dragon and Tyrant Tiger. They trained her well and she became a supreme conqueror.5

Nonetheless, the trauma remained in her mind. She was still the little girl trembling in horror amidst a sea of corpses.12

She saw her family and clan members fight bravely only to die. Waves of heroes rushed forward for nothing.0

The only solace in her mind was a pair of black wings from a crow, shielding her from the brink of destruction.
