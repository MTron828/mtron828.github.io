Chapter 797: Jian Wushuang’s Second Challenge

The battle location was unknown to everyone besides Li Qiye and Jian Wushuang. Even Ming Yexue didn’t know. Li Qiye chose this place to avoid outsiders seeing his secrets, at least for now.

Jian Wushuang was already waiting by the time he arrived. She hadn’t changed one bit; she was still as beautiful and charming with that same obnoxious pride.

Looking at Jian Wushuang would give the feeling that her beauty was not important because her arrogance alone was enough to make others back away. No matter how charming and kingdom-toppling she might be, others wouldn’t dare to come close, not even those who had a crush on her.

They would lose confidence before her arrogance and aggressiveness. Even those who were bolder would easily be deterred by her pride. Her attitude was not just for show. It came from her absolute confidence. She was a noble phoenix that looked down on the world and its inhabitants.

Li Qiye remained unperturbed. His temperament simply couldn’t compare to Jian Wushuang’s

arrogance. Nevertheless, it was not affected by her aggressive presence.

“I’m a bit surprised.” Li Qiye smiled after seeing her: “It mustn’t be easy for you to dare come challenge me again.”

Jian Wushuang coldly glared at him. Despite her defeat and even death at his hands, she was still as imperious as before without a hint of pretension.

She coldly uttered: “Why would I not dare to come again?! Victory and defeat are normal to a warrior! I will defeat you one day!” Despite her arrogance, her mentality was still quite good.

She didn’t falter after dying to Li Qiye and instead rose to even greater heights with a stronger battle intent. She was better than many people in this regard. For example, the white hair alchemist. He was a brilliant genius, but alas, he couldn’t handle the blow of defeat.

Li Qiye carefully glanced over her as if he wanted to see through everything. She, on the other hand, was not afraid at all and met his gaze head on with great confidence.

Compared to last time, Jian Wushuang was quite different in the sense that she was much stronger. Although her attitude did not change, she became less talkative and was more collected.

“Not bad at all. To continue treading forward after dying — this is worthy of praise.” Li Qiye voiced his praise after his observation; he now appreciated her character a bit more.

The two continued to stare at each other. Jian Wushuang’s eyes were sharp and overbearing. She was indeed an extraordinary girl!

Li Qiye smirked: “Although you have made some progress this time, you are still no match for me.”

“No need to bluster before the battle!” Jian Wushuang sneered coldly: “The victor has yet to be determined!”

Although Jian Wushuang was not as imperious as before, her arrogance and aggressiveness did not change one bit. Despite dying to Li Qiye once already, she remained undaunted.

Li Qiye shook his head in response: “No, in my opinion, there is no need to fight. The outcome has already been decided. You are not my match, and you won’t be able to surpass me.”

“Wait until we fight, then we can see whether I am your match or not.” Jian Wushuang snorted.

Li Qiye smiled: “Do you know why I came this time? It’s because I want you! If you don’t give me some benefits, then I won’t be interested in fighting today.”

“Li Qiye, I thought you were an indomitable fighter, but it turns out that you can’t even keep true to your words.” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Li Qiye smiled and slightly shook his head: “I didn’t go back on my words at all. Yes, I accepted your challenge, but it is up to me whether I will attack or not. I am standing right here, so you can attack me. After you attack, your challenge will officially begin, but I can also turn around and leave since I have no interest in fighting you! If you can catch up to me or stop me, then good for you. But if you can’t, then this challenge will be over. It will be your fault for not being able to stop me!”

“You!” Jian Wushuang almost vomited blood from anger. She coldly stared at him and uttered: “You must be afraid of losing to me!”

“Your taunt has no effect on me.” Li Qiye smilingly shook his head: “Regarding schemes, you are only a child in my eyes. If you think you are ready, then start the battle.”

Jian Wushuang was now furious. She didn’t come here to issue this challenge just so that Li Qiye could show up then run. She wanted to have a grand battle until she defeated him!

“What do you want?” She naturally was unwilling to have anything but a real fight!

Li Qiye looked at her and smirked: “What I want is very simple, just you! You must pledge loyalty to me, then you shall have a position among my generals. If you are strong enough in the future, even the number one general’s seat shall be yours!”

“In your dreams!” Jian Wushuang snorted: “I will neither pledge loyalty nor bow down to anyone. I will always be my own master!”

“You are mistaken.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Being my general does not mean you are below me. I view those who stand by my side as my own family! Moreover, if I lose, I can grant you all of your desires!”

“No!” Jian Wushuang rejected the proposition and coldly grinned: “If you must bet, then I can bet something different with you. If I lose, I shall hand over a supreme treasure!”

“Treasure?” Li Qiye shook his head: “Your Jian Clan’s treasures do not stir the least bit of interest in me, not even your Immortal Emperor True Treasure. Do you dare to bet or not? Of course, if you are afraid, then we’ll consider this battle as finished.”

“I have never been afraid before, but I will not make this bet with you. Your ruse has no effect on me as well.” Jian Wushuang coldly uttered.

“In that case, I am not very interested.” Li Qiye smiled: “I’m right here. You can start the duel all by yourself.” Having said that, he turned around and left.

Jian Wushuang did not attack. She was furious since this was not the battle she wanted. She wanted a real fight where a winner would be decided!

“Wait a minute!” She shouted right when Li Qiye was about to leave.

Li Qiye halted his steps and slowly turned around to look at her while smiling: “Changed your mind?”

Jian Wushuang was hesitant. She wanted nothing more than to rip him to shreds, but a real duel was even more tempting!

“I know you are unwilling and only want to destroy me!” Li Qiye chuckled: “I also know that you want to destroy my so-called devilish art with your strongest attack so that I will never revive again.”

“However, all of this doesn’t matter, don’t you think?” Li Qiye revealed a gentle smile that was rarely seen and raised his arms to the side: “I’m right here, do as you wish. Shoot me asunder, slash me into countless pieces, blow me into smithereens. I don’t mind whatever you want to do as long as you agree to our proposition.”

“Hmph, will you only rely on your devilish art to win?” Jian Wushuang snorted. She was both unwilling yet itching to try.

“You think I can only rely on this ‘devilish art’ to win?” Li Qiye shook his head while smiling: “Since you are so unconvinced, I can let you have a taste of my strength. I will still use this art to defeat you by allowing you to use any methods to try and kill me.”

“This will only be the appetizer to give you a chance to suppress and kill me.” Li Qiye smiled: “If you agree with my proposal, then after you fail to kill me, our duel will formally begin!”

“Any other rules?!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned serious after hearing this. This first test before the battle was a temptation difficult for her to resist.

“No other rules.” Li Qiye smiled: “You can use any methods, treasures, or techniques during the battle! Of course, you will only have one chance since I only need one move to defeat you!”

“One move?” Jian Wushuang’s anger welled up in her heart. She sneered: “Good, I also want to see just how powerful your archery is!”

She came prepared this time, so she was full of confidence.

“No, you misunderstood my intention.” Li Qiye gently shook his head: “I know you are proud and still think that you have a chance. Since that’s the case, I will let you witness my true strength. This one move of mine will not require any weapons or emperor laws. Just one move with my bare hands will be enough to take you down!”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
