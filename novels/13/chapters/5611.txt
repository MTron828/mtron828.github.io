Chapter 5612: Peace In Your Presence

“I’m just thirsty, that’s all, and it’s been a while since I drank some wine, maybe a few million years or something. What do you say, Young Master? Have a drink with your old pal?” Niu Fen defended himself.

“Coward.” Li Qiye said with disdain.

“We-well...” Niu Fen turned red and stammered for a while, unable to speak.

Li Qiye gently patted his shoulder and said: “Being a dao lord is an incredibly long and lonely journey, it is a great fortune to have a companion. Even if they can’t accompany you to the end, just part of the way will be joyous enough. The memories can be eternal.”

“The dao is too long, nothing lasts forever.” Niu Fen said softly.

“Yes, it is endless. Seek not perfection but rather, live with no regrets. When the golden wind and jade dew meet, they share an experience second to none.” Li Qiye said. [1]

“What if they don’t meet?” Niu Fen asked with hesitation.

“Then work harder.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Enough of this, what a sad sight for an apex dao lord. Scram!”

“Bam!” With that, he kicked Niu Fen and sent him flying like a meteor toward the chosen gateway.

“Young Master, you can’t treat me like this---” Niu Fen shouted before disappearing into the phenomenon.

Who knows if he would be able to meet the friend?

Li Qiye shook his head in amusement before shifting his focus onto Empress Star. However, a light flashed in another phenomenon, prompting him to enter it instead.

This was a remote island with few visitors - a true shame due to its striking scenery. The fair-sized island was surrounded by blue skies and pristine waters, looking like an emerald amidst the endless expanse.

An abundance of coconut trees could be seen from a distance. When the coconuts ripened, their fragrance wafted through the air.

One particular corner stood out due to its white sandy beach. The grains were fine, easily slipping through one’s fingers and scattering to the winds.

The clear waves gently brushed the beach. The sea breezes in combination with the crystal-clear water made this the perfect spot to relax.

Li Qiye did just that - walking on the white sand and letting his feet submerge in the waves.

Five or so others were basking in this serene and pleasant location, picking up shells along the way. They were indigenous mortals, relying on the island’s resources to survive. They picked up shells to make jewelry for sale to outsiders.

They wore short-sleeved clothes made from woven hemp. Their tanned complexion implied lengthy labor under the sun.

As the sun slowly rose, there were fewer and fewer shells. Only one remained to pick them along Li Qiye’s path.

He wore the same short-sleeved shirt and had his pants rolled up high. His complexion was fairer and he looked more refined as if he was a scholar once.

His spirit was high - someone who could endure hardship and toil diligently without any complaint or grievance.

He seemed more attentive and careful while picking shells, capable of finding the ones hidden well beneath the sands. Thus, his shells were more beautiful in comparison.

The mortals found shells to sell for subsistence reasons. He, on the other hand, viewed this as a hobby or a pursuit of beautiful things.

He showed a satisfied smile whenever he came across an exceptional shell. This alone made him content.

Li Qiye tagged along, eventually finding a fine shell and handing it to him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The man accepted the shell and wiped it with his shirt. After a careful look at the lines, he happily put it away and bowed: “Your Excellency, long time no see.”

“It’s been a while since someone called me this.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It’s been a while since we last met, Your Excellency.” The man continued to look for more shells.

“Right before my departure, Min Ren was around too.” Li Qiye became sentimental.

“Yes, the world changed drastically in the blink of an eye but you’re still here, Your Excellency.” The man reflected.

“Aren’t you still here too?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I was born in the mortal world and will be with it, the same can’t be said about you, Your Excellency.” The man reminisced: “You are an immortal and will leave in due time. As for me, I lead an unremarkable life and will chase unremarkable things.”

“It is wondrous, being able to pursue your desires while on the endless dao path. Many have tried for a lifetime, only to fail. True success is intoxicating.” Li Qiye said.

“Your Excellency, you told me this back then and I still haven’t forgotten. I can see that your dao heart is still as firm as ever.” The man nodded.

“Your attachment to the mortal world is just as firm.” Li Qiye said: “I once thought about staying here for a while but as I walked, I felt detached.”

“It is because you do not belong here, just a passerby, but this is my home.” The man said.

“Yes, that is why Min Ren handed the sword to you before leaving. He had been searching for a long time, someone to pass down the sword.” Li Qiye nodded.

“It should be in your possession, Your Excellency. It’s just that you have a high evaluation of me.” The man said.

“I can take it but it seems to be a waste. After all, a passerby has to leave eventually.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Keep it, perhaps one day, it will be of use.”

“I see.” The man said: “Your Excellency, you have been planning for that day for a long time now.”

“Just an idea, that’s all.” Li Qiye said: “A few things deserve a home so if Min Ren is gone, it’s time to pass it on. He won’t need it in the future.”

“We can’t compare to Brother Min Ren’s benevolence and aspiration.” The man said: “It’s a shame that I couldn’t follow him on his journey.”

“You belong here, so that trip wouldn’t have necessarily brought you joy. Everyone has a different pursuit, and the fact that yours hasn’t changed is priceless.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s just that due to your presence, it’s been so peaceful.” The man said.
