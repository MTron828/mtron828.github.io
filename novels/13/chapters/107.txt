Chapter 108 : Emperor’s Possession (2)

There was an unknown reason that caused the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect to not leave his mountain. This made the Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom change his mind and ask for an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure instead!

Even though the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom had many Royal Nobles, as many experts as the trees in a forest, and its Mortal King was a supreme Mortal King, they were still wary of the possessions containing the aura of an Immortal Emperor. An Enlightened Being, Ancient Saint, or even a Heavenly King without an emperor’s possession would not necessarily be able to stop the aura of an emperor’s possession.

Shengtian Dao released an outrageous and awe-inspiring brilliance as he coldly said:

“The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect — one day, I will personally annihilate it. Without killing this little animal with my own hands, I cannot let go of this hatred in my heart!”

It was not just Shengtian Dao who became crazy from anger, even Enlightened Being Si Tu was holding it back. However, they didn’t have any other options when the other party had an emperor’s possession.

The other Royal Nobles of the Kingdom also didn’t want to think too much so, in a flash, all of them entered the Evil Infested Ridge.

After entering the stone doors, everyone was transported to the Evil Infested Ridge. The moment they went inside, an ancient desolate presence struck their faces.

Outside of the ridge was the territory of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. After the great change, the mountains were faded and the rivers ran dry; the sect had declined. However, after coming into the Evil Infested Ridge, everything was completely different.

The mountains were lively with long vibrant rivers and the mountain ranges were monstrous. Taking a glance of the entire surroundings, this place was no different from a primitive era that was void of all human presence.

In this place, the jagged mountains were intertwining up and down, like giant sleeping dragons. In this place, the roots were like dragons and giant trees were like umbrellas, covering the entire sky.

The faint voices of the tigers and dragons were deep in the earth. Each of their ferocious roars stirred the souls of the people. It was as if this place was guarded by invincible beasts, as if the forest was infested with ruthless Longevity Spirits, causing others to have frightening chills.

Everyone felt the rich world’s energy in this place. It exceeded the natural energy of the immortal sects and ancient grounds of nations. The world’s energy was as dense as the mist, only an Immortal Emperor’s lineage could be comparable.

After the first group, wave after wave of cultivators went inside. They were all emotional from this place’s rich world energy. If they could cultivate here, then their improvements would be much greater than outside.

“The Evil Infested Ridge–”

Setting foot into this place, even Li Qiye had to softly sigh.

There were many legends in the Grand Middle Territory about the Evil Infested Ridge. Some said that this was the central area of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, so not only was this place was filled with world’s energy, but it had even more Heavenly Beasts and Longevity Spirits. In this place, the trees were the spirit medicines and the earth was gold.

This was why Immortal Emperor Min Ren used his supreme art to cut off this place from the rest of the world and created its own heaven and earth inside.

There was also another legend that the Evil Infested Ridge was not born in this place. It belonged to an outside world where the gods used to reside. Afterward, Immortal Emperor Min Ren carried it back to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and made it into their private property.

A different one stated that the Evil Infested Ridge was an evil ground. There used to be godly invincible devils in this place, but they were killed by Immortal Emperor Min Ren later!

... There were too many legends about this place, no one knew which were true and which were false.

“Don’t go in too deep. We should only go one thousand miles inside. Watch out for Heavenly Beasts and Longevity Spirits.”

A grand character reminded his disciples.

Many sects knew their own strengths. Even though there were many treasures that would blind the eyes, it was extremely dangerous. The deeper the area, the stronger the Heavenly Beasts and Longevity Spirits. They could reach the point where they could easily slay Royal Nobles.

The truth was, within the last thirty thousand years, the amount of sects that had entered the Evil Infested Ridge was not few. However, there were so many Royal Nobles that died in this place. Even Enlightened Beings shared their last moments here.

So later on, the experienced sects didn’t dare to take risks, especially at locations that were deemed as dangerous.

No one knew just how deep the Evil Infested Ridge was. There were many locations that were left untouched by humans.

“We’re going.”

Li Qiye told everyone. He commanded Gu Tieshou to open the portrait of Immortal Emperor Min Ren.

Anyone who stepped inside this land would immediately feel like they were observed by ferocious beasts from the jungle. However, the moment this portrait was opened and exuded its emperor’s aura, all of the Heavenly Beasts and Longevity Spirits ran away and didn’t dare to stay around.

One had to know that this piece of heaven and earth was sealed by Immortal Emperor Min Ren. No one could provoke his aura in this place.

Sitting on the snail, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was the first to head deeper into the Evil Infested Ridge.

“An Immortal Emperor’s lineage is truly great.”

With the portrait up above, all of the Heavenly Beasts and Longevity Spirits avoided them. Many people were envious that the fierce beasts were not drawing close to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.

“Hmph, it’s only a portrait, not even an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure.”

Of course, there were some people with bitterness in their hearts, such as Marquis of the Eastern River, Nantian Hao, and Shang Tian Dao. The more arrogant Li Qiye was, the more uncomfortable they were.

Hearing these words, Li Qiye turned around and looked at everyone, then he said:

“Yeah, so what if it is only a portrait? Not convinced? Come and bite me then!”

Many people were vomiting blood from anger because of Li Qiye’s provocation, especially Nantian Hao and Shengtian Dao, who had grievances with him.

“Ah! My hand is feeling a bit weak. You absolutely must not secretly follow behind us. If I am not careful when holding this portrait, I might slam it into everyone... that would be so embarrassing, ah!”

Li Qiye leisurely said while he gazed at the group of Nantian Hao and Shengtian Dao.

Such a blatant provocation made the group of Shengtian Dao lose their colors. Even Li Shuangyan had to glared at him once — this guy was extraordinarily arrogant!

Li Qiye wanted this result. Since the sect forced itself into the ridge, the Heavenly God Sect and Heavenly Jewel Kingdom were definitely not happy. He wanted to show off the emperor’s portrait, just so that they would think twice before acting. At the very least, this would allow for the disciples of the sect to calmly hone their skills inside the ridge for a short amount of time, lest they have to watch their backs the whole time.

“Bang– bang– bang–”

Finally, under the glares of many, Li Qiye, along with the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, disappeared into the depths of the forest while riding the snail.

What people didn’t expect was that even though the snail appeared to be bulky, its speed was as fast as lightning and wouldn’t lose to flying treasures.

Niu Fen carried everyone and, under the command of Li Qiye, went lightning-fast into the danger area of the Evil Infested Ridge. Even the ordinary grand sects would not easily penetrate this area.

“Where is this place?”

Seeing Li Qiye with a clear goal, Li Shuangyan was perplexed. If Li Qiye wasn’t so young, she would have thought that he had come here before.

“Down south.”

Li Qi Yi answered while watching the far horizon as he was sitting on the snail.

“We have entered the dangerous area. If we keep going further, we would reach the no man’s land.”

Gu Tieshou looked around and worriedly said:

“We will be meeting with Heavenly Beasts and Longevity Spirits over one million years old.”

“One million year old Heavenly Beasts?”

Hearing these words, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s disciples took a deep breath and lamented:

“I heard that one million year old Heavenly Beasts could even swallow a Heavenly Sovereign alive. Are we not going towards our death?”

“Big Sister, with Oldest Brother here... One million year old Heavenly Beasts, so what?”

Luo Fenghua, sitting on the snail, confidently said:

“With Oldest Brother here, we can avert all dangers.”

Luo Fenghua’s words silenced everyone. The younger generation especially worshiped Li Qiye blindly. One had to know that Li Qiye was only at the Physique Accumulation Realm. Even the third generation disciples had a higher cultivation than him.[1. I checked previous chap, he didn’t successfully build a second palace yet. Maybe this is why he is still Physique Accumulation before his second palace is completed?]

Niu Fen flew with extreme speed towards an unknown location. In reality, they had trespassed the territory of many Heavenly Beasts and Longevity Spirits; maybe these monsters were watching them secretly, but because they noticed the portrait of Min Ren, they didn’t dare to come closer. Min Ren was an invincible existence in this place, every being had to avoid him at all cost!

After quickly rushing southward, Niu Fen slowed down and gravely said:

“We have entered the territory of one million year old Heavenly Beasts and Longevity Spirits.”

Sure enough, at this moment, the aura of a fierce beast as vast as the sea permeated the air. Everyone felt as if their souls were strangulated, and it was sucking their essences away from their bodies.

“This is a Longevity Spirit!”

Li Shuangyan was also shocked and prepared her Life Treasure.

“All gods, withdraw –”[2. Double similar meanings here. You can interpret it as he is able to chase away the gods, but subjects of Chinese emperors are also referred to as “all gods”, so he could also be suppressing his weaker servants]

At the moment, Li Qiye took the portrait from the hand of Elder Gu and loudly roared. At this moment, the emperor’s aura bursted out and began to vigorously flourish. Each of the magical runes intertwining together created the mysterious word “Withdraw” that floated on top of Li Qiye’s head. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The mantra of the emperor’s aura was peerless. One has to know that the words of Immortal Emperors were made from jade and gold! The appearance of mysterious word “Withdraw” caused the frightening presence to immediately disappear like the receding tide. At this moment, even one million year old Longevity Spirits had to run.

No matter how old they were, in front of the profound words of Immortal Emperor Min Ren, all had to hide!
