Proving his supremacy with a single slash stunned the crowd.

It took a while for them to regain their wits. Their attention became fixated on the sword in Li Qiye’s hand. The blade was one meter long or so. It had strands of energy looking like ice needles coming out of it, giving off a chilling aura. However, these seemingly-cold strands had flames inside them.

The flames were animated and contained various living things. One of them was a world with numerous runes. Just one rune could crush the firmaments.

It contained both hot and cold, seemingly gestating three thousand worlds of dao runes. Anyone could sense its weight without actually holding it.

Thus, this gave it the ability to crush everything with its slashes. It instilled immense pressure on the spectators.

Just one strand of energy alone was awfully intimidating, let alone being the target of a slash.

Of course, they could tell that they couldn’t use this sword. In fact, they wouldn’t be able to carry it. A sword like this required a powerful master.

“What is this sword?” Some new disciples had no idea.

Very few in Divine Black have actually seen it before. Only a few elders and peak lords had this privilege. That’s why the regular disciples knew nothing of its origin.

“A patrimony sword.” Those in the know stared at the sword with respect.

“Left behind by South Conch Dao Lord?” Some became emotional. Only dao lord weapons could have this classification.

The older disciple nodded in confirmation to the astonishment of his peers.

Dao lord weapons were already amazing enough. They were high-level heaven weapons.

But there was something even better- patrimony weapons. These were the top artifacts left behind by dao lords.

Obtaining a regular dao lord weapon was the blessing of three lifetimes. As for patrimony weapons? They weren’t given to disciples and were kept as sect-defining artifacts to be used in case of war.

This particular sword was the ultimate artifact stored in South Conch Peak. It has always been under the watch of the generational sect masters. It represented authority and power.

Only Ping Suoweng could use the sword in this generation. However, he was limited to a single slash.

The high-ranking members understood the significance of this sword so they stared at Li Qiye with bated breath.

He used this sword so easily just now. This meant that he grasped Divine Black in his palm.

Some elders turned towards Ping Suoweng. Why? Because the guy wouldn’t be able to refuse if Li Qiye were to claim the sect master position right now.

Moreover, he would be powerless to resist, unable to take on Li Qiye and the sword. Thus, they worried about him.

What should they do in that case? Let the virtuous take charge or to fight to the death on Suoweng’s side?

Of course, Suoweng himself wasn’t worried about his position. He didn’t think that Li Qiye cared for it. Moreover, he would gladly give the guy the seat too.

The matter on his mind right now was the sword. He wasn’t worried about Li Qiye taking it away either.

He simply reminisced about the past and how much time he spent on it. The result was being able to perform one slash.

Now, after seeing how effortlessly Li Qiye made it look, he thought that he had wasted several thousand years. The worst part was that Li Qiye had three mortal-level aptitudes.

“Decent sword.” Li Qiye raised the sword to his front and bent the blade a bit before letting it spring back. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Clank!” The resulting sound nearly broke the world. Everyone felt as if their heart had just been hit and lost their breath.

It became clear that Li Qiye was untouchable with that sword in his hand. He could kill gods and devils right now.

“Anyone else wants to fight?” He smiled and looked around.

No one answered him. One could hear the drop of a needle at this point.

Those from the demon tiger clan kept their mouth shut as well. Losing both Zhan Hu and Iron Whip Demon King was a heavy loss. Moreover, their defining treasure was also cut into two pieces.

Their position in Divine Black was no longer the same. It would take several hundred years for them to recover.

Alas, their strongest cultivator, Iron Whip, died to a single move. Anyone else trying to fight Li Qiye was simply suicidal. In fact, provoking him now could spell doom for their clan. Choosing to be quiet now was the prudent choice.

The others had no reason to speak up. They wanted nothing more than for Li Qiye to leave them alone. Why would they provoke him given the circumstances?

“Very well, we’ll end this here today.” He smiled.

Everyone felt so much better after hearing this. They thought that he was far scarier than their sect master now.

“Clank!” Li Qiye threw the sword and it automatically flew back to South Conch Peak.

Some couldn’t believe it. How could he give this ultimate treasure back to South Conch Peak? No one would hand it over. Even the most generous soul wouldn’t claim it as their own but would still keep it around just in case.

The top members heaved a sigh of relief, aware that Li Qiye didn’t care to be the next sect master.

He got on his carriage again and told the children from Liu to take him away.

When he first got here, people criticized him for putting on an overly ostentatious act. Now, this no longer seemed the case because this was how it should be.
