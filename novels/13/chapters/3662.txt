Chapter 3663: Because I’m Handsome

“Let’s get started then. You two go first so that it’ll be fairer, I won’t look like a bully in this case.” Li Qiye smiled and told the two.

The unhappy couple scowled but still agreed. They went forward closer to Untethered Monk.

The latter placed his palms together and grinned: “Merciful Buddha, feel free to give it a shot. One person is eighty, two is one-sixty, do you want to come one at a time or...”

The monk couldn’t finish before Zhang Yunzhi tossed a spatial pouch at him: “The rest is a tip.”

“Amitabha, thank you, generous Benefactor. I hope you will be victorious.” The monk happily caught the pouch and wished the best for the two.

The interesting monk was absolutely on the same level as the four grandmasters. After all, one of them was his junior brother. Moreover, he was considered superior in terms of Buddhist attainment and talent as well.

Normally, masters of this level would be shown nothing but reverence by regular people. In reality, Zhang Yunzhi wouldn’t have dared to do this to any senior of his. Plus, big shots wouldn’t think much of the small sum either. It was akin to adding salt to an ocean.

That’s why this interaction was unique and could only be seen with Untethered Monk.

People easily forgot his status and power. They didn’t care that he was a top cultivator and the person in charge of Wish Ward. They considered him as a businessman and a bad monk. This was what set him apart from other masters.

Zhang Yunzhi and the second princess entered the square. They knew that many have failed before them but still held onto a sliver of hope. They thought that there was still a chance for success.

The spectators knew that this actually didn’t matter. Only Li Qiye’s attempt carried significance for the bet. Nonetheless, they still watched with full attention.

The two of them reached into the spring and found that people were right. This spring was bottomless.

They exchanged glances and decided to utilize their techniques. Their hands stretched long enough to reach for the stars but still not enough to reach the bottom. Thus, they didn’t grab anything. They had no choice but to give up, exasperated.

“See, no exception.” One spectator saw their hands being empty and said. Their failure was expected because they weren’t the most talented nor the most powerful among the crowd.

The two of them went to the wooden house and stared at the door. It seemed weak enough to be sent flying with one kick.

A master has previously declared that this door was blessed by a supreme existence. That’s why its resilience wasn’t surprising. The two were aware of this but still wanted to try.

Zhang Yunzhi summoned and gripped his silver spear tightly. It had a draconic style with rotating dao runes. The blade came out of the dragon’s mouth with an extremely sharp tip.

This was obviously an extremely powerful weapon, also quite renowned as being from the Zhang.

“Clank!” His armor released a silver radiance. “Raa!” The dragon on the spear seemingly came back to life. The blade tip had a terrifying glint.

“Activate!” The princess formed a mudra.

“Screech!” With a phoenix screech, she became engulfed in a true daofire with images of phoenix totems.

“Break!” Yunzhi roared and instantly took action, thrusting his spear forward.

In this split second, the princess empowered him with her true daofire. He resembled a furious fiery dragon, brimming with domineering energy. The attack became a combination between a silver dragon and a fiery phoenix.

“Their teamwork is impeccable. Just a casual attack is still quite effective.” An old cultivator praised the two.

The young ones became envious. This meant that the two of them had a deep emotional bond.

“Boom!” The strike struck the feeble door. After the silver light and the fire dispersed, the door still remained standing - completely untouched.

“Not enough.” No one was surprised at this result.

The two had no choice but to leave the square.

“Your turn.” Yunzhi coldly uttered at Li Qiye.

“Cherish your last moment while your head is still attached.” The princess glared at him as if she was looking at a dead man.

Since they have personally experienced the process, they became certain that Li Qiye had no chance. Thus, victory was theirs. Cutting off his head was the only thing that could appease her anger.

“Sure.” Li Qiye stretched his hand and smiled.

“Young Master, you’re too careless.” The crown prince shook his head. He didn’t want Li Qiye to die but there was nothing he could do to stop the bet.

“Amitabha. Benefactor, one-eighty.” The monk raised his hand, asking for the payment.

“I don’t have to pay.” Li Qiye smiled. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“No? Tell me a reason.” The monk didn’t expect this.

“Because I’m handsome.” Li Qiye responded.

This answer naturally prompted the crowd to erupt with waves of laughter.

“Handsome? Him? What a joke, he has not an ounce of self-awareness.” One young cultivator laughed.

A pretty female cultivator pretended to barf: “Self-awareness is a virtue, there’s a limit to narcissism. If he’s handsome, then everyone else are immortals.”

Their strong reaction was warranted. Li Qiye’s common appearance had nothing to do with the word, “handsome”.

“Insanity, take a look at yourself in a puddle of piss.” The princess couldn’t help but say some foul words due to her hatred for him.

However, Untethered Monk took another look at Li Qiye, this time with increased sincerity.

He then placed his palms together and sighed: “Benefactor, you possess an immortal physique shrouded in wondrous radiance and freed from a single imperfection while brimming with grand dao affinity. I feel ashamed of my inferiority while standing in your presence. The word ‘handsome’ fails to adequately describe your flawless appearance. Please come in.”

The first part was elegantly put and befitting that of a wise monk. However, the entire thing was mere flattery.

“Uh...” Everyone became flabbergasted. Why would this monk go so far in praising Li Qiye’s appearance?

“I don’t find Untethered Monk’s shamelessness surprising, he’ll praise anyone for a few coins.” An older cultivator said: “But there’s nothing in it for him, in fact, he’s losing money. What the hell is wrong with the monk today?”
