Chapter 3795: My Tree

The gentle Buddhist light allowed the tree to grow fast, from a branch to a regular tree with incredible leaves. They looked like bodhi leaves but this wasn’t a bodhi tree.

The leaves emitted the same Buddhist affinity downward and bathed the roots. In just a short time, it seems that millions of years have passed for the roots and the main branch, becoming an integral part of the world.

The tiny tree continued to grow in front of the awed spectators. Each leaf and branch pulsed brightly. With an increase in light, dao runes also emerged. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The tree seemed to be hiding an ancient Buddhist scripture containing peerless profundities.

It lacked oppressive pressure and chants. Nonetheless, once the tree was formed, many became shaken with an urge to kneel.

They eventually regained their wits and looked around, not aware of the tree’s purpose.

Flowers blossomed within the light and around the trees in a magnificent manner, looking like fireworks deep in space. The light flowers illuminated the area and mesmerized the spectators.

Each flower was one world - this was everyone’s thought. Sure enough, this was indeed the case.

New words were being created with numerous living beings inside. As their faith grew, Buddhas were being born as well.

It was astonishing to see this unforgettable process happening on Minor Sacred Mountain. Numerous spectators from a distance got on their knees, thinking that they were seeing the mythical paradise while being enlightened by a Buddhist Lord.

“Is this an illusion?” One ancestor became startled. They had no idea if the tree was actually blossoming or just an illusion created by Li Qiye.

Though these ancestors were extremely powerful, they still couldn’t see through the phenomenon.

If this wasn’t an illusion, then it would be even more shocking. Many have tried for a lifetime and never had the privilege to see the blossoming of a Buddhist tree.

They didn’t have time to think before the start of the next stage. The flowers disappeared, replaced by fruits on the branches.

The fruits varied in form. One looked like a holy Buddha; another looked like a child. One had the form of a pagoda...

The holy light emanating from them contained some sort of truths. The spectators became bewildered, wanting to take a bite or just swallow them whole.

“What is this?” The experts were certainly amazed by this spectacle. However, this didn’t seem to have anything to do with the fight.

Why did Li Qiye create this tree? It must have some special effects.

“Incredible.” Even Righteous Scion stroked his chin and mused: “Is this World Crossing? Hmm, not quite.”

Those nearby felt their heart beating faster and stared at the scion. He didn’t look very certain.

“It shouldn’t have anything to do with World Crossing.” One youth said, not daring to go against the scion who was famous for both power and knowledge. None among the young generation was qualified to talk with him about the dao.

An ancestor ruminated, agreeing that this wasn’t Dhyana Dao Lord’s World Crossing.

“It’s not the same but there are similarities regarding the mysteries of Buddhism.” A high elder from a powerful clan responded.

Many have seen World Crossing during the battle between Righteous Scion and Golden Cicada Buddhist Child.

Everyone vividly remembered the visual phenomena seen during Golden Cicada’s performance. Now, Li Qiye’s technique looked completely different.

“The Buddhamization Chapter.” Xu Cuimei standing in the corner sighed and murmured. Unfortunately, no one heard her.

Of course, no one would think of Buddhamization. First, few left alive in the entire world had the privilege of seeing the actual scripture in action.

World Crossing derived by Dhyana Dao Lord from the Supreme Four Truths was far more popular. In reality, World Crossing was a derivation or interpretation of Buddhamization.

Many have learned World Crossing in history. But as for Buddamization? Who knows who actually got to see it besides Dhyana Dao Lord. These masters weren’t known to the world.

Thus, the fact that Xu Cuimei could recognize the source of Li Qiye’s technique was indicative of her abilities. At the very least, it showed that she had made contact with a heavenly scripture.

The question was - how? Her sect had access to the Evil Devourer Chapter of the four truths, not Buddhamization.

“Okay, this is good enough.” Li Qiye clapped and relaxed his hands, no longer making the mudra.

“This is your weapon?” Phantom’s eyes narrowed while looking at the Buddhist tree.

At the start, they thought that Li Qiye would use the branch as a sword. They didn’t expect him to grow a tree with it.

“That’s one way to put it. As one wishes.” Li Qiye smiled.

Others paid no mind to his comment with the exception of Wei Qianqing. She was close to the statue of Dhyana Dao Lord and closed her eyes, entering a state of meditation. As one wishes...

“Keep on acting mysterious all you want.” The third prince said: “Fellow Brothers, let’s capture him now, he’s trying to buy time.”

Hu Ben and Phantom exchanged glances before nodding. They didn’t quite agree with the prince but it certainly looked like Li Qiye was buying time.

“No rush, no rush. I said that I would give you three a chance. What opponent do you want?” Li Qiye smirked.

He then gently knocked on a fruit and said: “This person, Dhyana Dao Lord, or Buddha Dao Lord, or Evilseal Pagoda...?”

The spectators followed Li Qiye’s lead through all the fruits and found that they looked very familiar.

Because the holy ground worshipped these sages, they had portraits of the dao lords. For example, Dhyana Dao Lord. That fruit that Li Qiye touched first truly looked like him.

“Dhyana Dao Lord, Buddha Dao Lord...” Even the ancestors took a deep breath.

Li Qiye’s casual tap on the fruit was nothing short of a hammer striking his opponents’ mind.

These dao lords were the ultimate existences in the heart of the holy ground’s members. If one day, they would suddenly need to face these dao lords? None dared to imagine this scenario.
