Chapter 5416: Who’s The Strongest?

She kept her eyes closed and meditated as if this had nothing to do with her. Powerful spectators could see her with their heavenly gaze and had nothing but praise.

Despite their experiences in life, they might not be able to face death as nonchalantly as the young genius.

“What a shame.” A conqueror lamented despite being from The People.

“She could have been an apex conqueror with anima.” Another sighed.

“Of course, she will be just like Light-dragon Conqueror.” A dao lord commented on her potential.

Given her achievement of obtaining twelve dao fruits and baiting the emperors with a heavenly tribulation, she could become comparable to the best of the best.

“Clank! Clank!” A sword ocean manifested into reality outside of Illumination Grotto. It included divine swords imbued with the grand dao, instilling fear into all spectators.

Everyone could see its destructive potential - this was the power of an apex cultivator.

Figures could be seen inside - the leader being Swordsea Dao Lord. His presence caused the world to feel crowded and oppressive.

His ocean was raging and so was his mood. An enraged dao lord could cause devastating damage - a sign that he was going to destroy this grotto at all costs.

He brought with him the strongest members of Divine Alliance. Their auras didn’t make things better for weaker cultivators.

“He’s furious.” A spectator commented.

“We should be the ones angry regarding his betrayal.” A big shot from The People said.

They haven’t forgotten about his defection. He used to be one of the three pillars of Dao Alliance - a reason for its dominance.

He garnered a lot of fans during Dao Alliance’s golden age. Alas, they didn’t expect him to leave for Divine Alliance and now, he was acting as its leader.

“Death accompanies cultivators, that’s all.” A big shot had a different perspective on the event.

While Heaven and Divine Alliance couldn’t allow this to happen, certain members of The People wished to see Ye Fantian’s death since her tribulation delivered considerable casualties.

“Boom!” A dao path soared forward and swept everything along the way with its majestic power.

A magnificent man walked on the path with many conquerors and dragon lords behind him. Their auras varied in color and shape while possessing the same dreadful attributes.

“Supreme and Heaven Alliance.” Everyone became emotional.

It seemed that a fight was inevitable today due to the gathering of these masters.

“Looks like an uneven match.” Illumination’s supporters worried after seeing his opponents.

“Buzz.” Lotus flowers appeared along with boundless life force.

The atmosphere was filled with intense bloodthirst but the flowers lessened this oppressive force, allowing people to breathe easier.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The third party only had one man and two followers, arriving without any fanfare.

“All-things Dao Lord!” All eyes fell on the leader.

“Where are his men?” Others wondered since the members of Dao Alliance were absent.

“Does he not wish to interfere?” An important character from The People asked.

“Heaven and Divine Alliance are knocking on our doors, they need to let go of grudges and unite together.” Another said.

The big shots from The People were unhappy since All-things Dao Lord showed no sign of wanting to aid Illumination Conqueror.

“He probably views Illumination Conqueror as the biggest threat.” A dragon lord didn’t find this surprising at all.

Those on the side of All-things Dao Lord wanted Illumination to fall today. Otherwise, Dao Alliance would never be united.
