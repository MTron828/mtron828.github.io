Chapter 4974: Becoming Bait

“Could he be the one?” Ming Shi asked since Shadowrider was a prime suspect.

“I don’t think so since I remembered something important.” The schoolmaster shook his head.

“What is it?” Ming Shi was heavily invested in this topic.

“Long, long ago, someone named a high price at the black market for a helper. The price was high enough to make it memorable.” The schoolmaster said.

“A helper, for what?” Ming Shi said.

“There’s a reason why it was asked at the black market, very secretive. The participating members were interested in it but it didn’t last for too long.” The schoolmaster said.

“Why?” She didn’t know about this black market at all.

“Because someone had accepted the job.” Yunyun explained.

“Yes, due to the insane requirement and reward, few could have actually accepted and completed it. There were a few candidates with Shadowrider being one of them.” The schoolmaster said.

Because of his position, he had relationships with cultivators from all over the world.

“Maybe this was just a coincidence, but it is one clue to all the missing cultivators. Plus, Shadowrider is an expert in this matter as well.” The schoolmaster said.

“Let’s go find this Shadowrider then.” Li Qiye smiled.

“How?” Yunyun asked.

“This assassin is impossible to find, no one knows what this person looks like either.” Ming Shi nodded.

Rumor has it that this assassin came from an ancient organization. Others thought that the person was fortunate enough to obtain an immemorial legacy, becoming a master without needing guidance.

“There are two ways to find Shadowrider.” The schoolmaster said.

“Go on.” Yunyun asked right away. This might be the only clue to finding her ancestor.

“Let’s pretend that there is only one person in the lower continents who knows Shadowrider’s whereabouts, this person would be Wild Dragon.” He said.

“Wild Dragon? They associate with each other?” Ming Shi asked.

“It’s just a guess stemming from a popular belief.” The schoolmaster shook his head.

“A popular belief?” Yunyun didn’t understand.

“Yes, that Wild Dragon doesn’t dare to provoke Shadowrider, a way to envision how frightening this assassin is.” The schoolmaster said.

“This implies that Wild Dragon knows where to find Shadowrider.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Exactly.” The schoolmaster nodded.

“Wild Dragon…” Yunyun couldn’t help staring at Li Qiye.

Alas, the villain had escaped back to the serpent throne after being pierced by A’zhui’s flames. They would need to enter the Ten Mountains of Demon in order to find him. Plus, would a six-fruit dragon lord speak to them?

“I don’t think Wild Dragon will reveal anything if the rumor about not wanting to provoke Shadowrider is true.” Ming Shi said.

“Is there no other way?” Yunyun became disappointed.

“The other method is to hire Shadowrider to kill. As long as there is money, this assassin will show up.” The schoolmaster said.

“This isn’t a joke, Shadowrider doesn’t fail.” Ming Shi said.

“Right, we might be playing with fire.” Yunyun agreed.

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and smiled at the schoolmaster: “You can hire him to kill me.”

“Are you crazy? You won’t even realize your last seconds, Shadowrider is the ultimate assassin.” Ming Shi became startled. Only a madman would hire such an effective killer in this manner.

“It’s too risky.” Yunyun disagreed as well.

The schoolmaster also shook his head: “This isn’t a good idea. From my estimation, Shadowrider can assassinate a six-fruit dragon lord or a four-fruit conqueror.”

“It would be fun to gather all Ten Monsters, no?” Li Qiye smirked.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yunyun didn’t know what to say. Li Qiye had killed four of them while Demoness had offered her service.

The only ones left were Flame-eater Child, Shadowrider, Wild Dragon, and Bloodsea Blade. Of course, Bloodsea was not on the list of targets.

“It’s too dangerous, I don’t want to trouble you over my own matter.” Yunyun still refused.

In fact, she thought that he could actually kill Wild Dragon in a direct battle. The same couldn’t be said about the elusive Shadowrider.

“Yes, don’t gamble with your life, there must be another way.” Ming Shi said.

“I’m not doing this for you, I’m merely interested and want to investigate.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Investigate what?” Ming Shi asked.

“Say, you have just hunted a deer, how will you cook it?” Li Qiye asked.

“There are many ways, roast, boil, steam, cure the meat…” Ming Shi reluctantly answered.

“When you were a baby, did you know how to answer this question?” He asked another question.

“What are you talking about?” She became confused.

“Let’s put it this way, I’ll give you a dragon lord. Do you know how to eat him and why?” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s disgusting.” She instantly responded.

“What do you think happened to those missing dragon lords and conquerors? Were they killed just for their treasures? Who would take such a risk over some treasures?” Li Qiye smiled.

“They got eaten…?” She became creeped out.

“The stronger the cultivators, the more delicious and nutritious. Of course, you have to know how to eat first. Otherwise, it would just be a waste.” Li Qiye said.

“Young Noble, there is a proper method behind this madness? Maybe an ancient evil art passed down from long ago?” Yunyun shuddered.

“Hmm…” The schoolmaster agreed. He himself didn’t know the right way to eat a dragon lord. It couldn’t be as simple as just boiling or stewing.
