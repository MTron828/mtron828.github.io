Chapter 5807: Power Of The Heavenly Scriptures

The shroud loomed above heaven and earth, causing everything to tremble. Spectators felt suffocated and lost control over their body.

Dao Ancestor gave him this shroud - an unfinished paragon artifact. Its power far exceeded an imperial treasure.

“The old geezers really like tricking people, throwing a bunch of items and calling them paragon artifacts. Your toy is not a paragon artifact, just an epoch weapon or an overlord weapon, it has a long way to go before it can be called a paragon artifact.” Li Qiye glanced at the shroud and said.

Everyone exchanged glances since they only had a faint idea of the criteria. They thought Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng’s Three Thousand World Mech was certainly a paragon artifact.

Immortal Emperor Hao Hai’s Divine Beast could be considered one as well, albeit not at grand completion.

“We are distant from the epoch level, so please offer us your guidance.” Profound was surprised to hear this.

Li Qiye stared at the shroud first before looking at Divine Beast: “You have an overlord weapon while his sword is an incomplete paragon artifact at the initial stage.”

“Thank you.” Profound cupped his fist and learned the different classifications: “Excuse me now.”

He had no intention of yielding and took a deep breath, releasing all twelve wills. They combined and formed an azure.

Everyone has seen this before - the sign of an apex cultivator.

“Rumble!” Next came the rumbling of truths. They surged like an ocean, signaling the presence of anima.

The ocean suddenly detonated and was replaced by primal chaos pouring from his now-golden anima.

“A primal anima.” The crowd could tell that Profound Emperor had reached the level beyond.

Emperors and dao lords differed from the process but the end goal was similar. Those with twelve fruits or wills could reach the apex and see the truth, or anima. Breaking this limit and obtaining a primal anima allowed them to embark on the next journey - Ancestor.

Cultivators could try for a lifetime and never become an emperor or a dao lord. The apex level was another impossible hurdle.

Apex cultivators had their problems as well, breaking the limit to see the truth in the primal chaos.

The path was arduous and becoming an emperor was indeed just the beginning. Most of the crowd members found this path endless, having spent eras cultivating.

Those lucky enough to reach the apex were greeted by an unsurpassable wall - the limit. They felt despair since there was no way forward regardless of their efforts.

Now, seeing several cultivators displaying their primal anima proved that the path was real and possible.

“Brother, what should we do to break the limit?” An emperor who was so close wanted to reach this primal state.

Seeing the truth was one thing but the method to reach it eluded them. No one had left behind or passed down the methods so they were on their own.

“From truth to origination, the road of the limit.” Li Qiye smiled and answered instead: “Anima is boundless, serving as the true form. Understanding and finding the truths will allow one to see the primal chaos and be reborn...”

His enemies listened attentively, memorizing each word. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity if they could somehow survive this battle. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Thank you, Sacred Teacher.” They bowed respectfully after the speech.

Meanwhile, Profound had waited patiently. He shouted: “Sacred Teacher, take this!”

“Boom!” His primal anima released boundless power - a force different from anything available to weaker emperors.

After the lesson, the crowd had a heightened awareness of this different affinity. Before this, they knew it was different but couldn’t articulate anything specifically or concretely.

“Boom!” Profound’s shroud unleashed the might of the dao.

Dao laws and primal power gathered to form nine heavens above. Everyone could sense the power of the heavenly scriptures afterward.

Another stark contrast stood out to them. The power of the heavenly scripture was natural and always existing while the primal anima’s power was cultivated and formed after the fact.
