Chapter 5052: The Tides Have Turned

Golden Mosquito must have struck a weak spot because Vine God’s personal tablet dimmed down.

“Friends, I cannot delay the disaster any longer!” Vine God shouted.

“Damn it!” The other commanding gods’ expression soured.

His green leaves started withering while a massive flower bud formed.

“His disaster is here, it’s another cycle!” Goldcrest shouted.

“Pop!” The flower blossomed and released pollen everywhere. A golden mist seemed to be taking over, leaving no place to hide.

Regular animals and demons were instantly affected - becoming paralyzed. The stronger demon monarchs and human cultivators sat down on the ground and relied on their cultivation to stop the paralysis.

“I have done all I can, take care now.” Dream Monarch who was attached to Vine King fell into a deep slumber.

He snored loud enough for everyone to hear. Those who were still awake were occupied with stopping the paralysis. Alas, physical forces couldn’t stop Dream Monarch’s hypnosis.

They fell to the ground, fully overwhelmed by both the pollen and the hypnotic effect.

Nightwalker, Lunar Rabbit, and Chillglare Hawk were weakened as well, albeit still maintaining consciousness. The divine tablets behind them also waned in brightness.

Unfortunately, this left them vulnerable to Golden Mosquito’s multi-pronged attacks.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Their tablets dispersed, unable to hold on any longer.

“Capture them.” Golden Mosquito then turned all of his focus and legs on the actual divine tablet, wanting to stop the summoning process.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Buzz.” His allies were engulfed in a crimson glow - a divine blessing from Golden Mosquito.

There was no doubt that the outsiders have conspired with Bloodfly God long ago. The divine blessing granted them protection from the dual maladies.

The commanding gods on the other side didn’t have the same luck. Thus, they had to rely on their own power but this wouldn’t last forever.

“It is time to give up, gentlemen.” Radiant Monarch sent his holy judgment down upon Nightwalker.

“It is settled already!” Skystomper God laughed and thought that his halo was unstoppable.

“Sword Rise!” Nightwalker roared and unleashed a devastating slash against the four dragon lords.

“Give up already.” On the other side, Pagoda Guardian and his three giants also used their treasures. The immortal pagodas turned into a devouring dao, wanting to take down Lunar Rabbit.

The latter spewed out a chilling wind capable of freezing the celestials in response, successfully stopping the pagodas.

“Monarch, let me send you onto your next journey.” Bloodfly God’s target was none other than Peacock Monarch.

“Hmph.” Chillglare Hawk used his wings like two blades.

Alas, he and his allies were severely hindered by the pollen and hypnotic snores. This left them far weaker compared to their peak state.

“Boom!” Chillglare fell to the ground, Nightwalker was grievously injured, and Lunar Rabbit got sent flying.

The tides have turned completely as a result. Many demon monarchs wanted to help but they were utterly paralyzed.

“Demon will unite after this.” One dragon lord murmured after seeing this.

“Perhaps the six branches will be gone, only one shall be left.” Another spectator said.

“A true disaster for the ten mountains…” Golden Cicada King watched helplessly.

Golden Mosquito was on the verge of becoming the only true god in Demon. The next plan was to attack the divine nest and become unbeatable.

“Ugh…” Nightwalker vomited blood, unable to break through the entrapment. The same situation occurred for his two allies.

“It is not too late to surrender, Commanding Gods.” Radiant Monarch said.

“In your dream.” Nightwalker uttered coldly.

“You’ll change your tune soon enough, Commanding God.” Skystomper sneered.

“Give up now.” Guardian Pagoda also demanded.

Lunar Rabbit didn’t bother responding.

“Kill them if they won’t yield.” Golden Mosquito ordered while still dealing with the divine tablet.

“Peacock Monarch, looks like you won’t be so lonely after all, so many commanding gods are coming with you.” Bloodfly said.

“Despicable traitor.” Peacock Monarch insulted.

“Kill them all.” Bloodfly told his allies.

“Wait a second now, let me join the party too.” A leisurely voice suddenly interrupted the tense atmosphere.

Radiant Monarch became frozen after hearing this voice, and the same for the others. They turned around and were aghast to see who it was.

He sat on top of a tree branch, swinging his legs back and forth casually while watching the crucial battle.

“Li Qiye!” Radiant Monarch staggered backward. He has never been afraid of anyone but Li Qiye was an exception.
