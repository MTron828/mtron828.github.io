Chapter 5177: Biting Rabbit

“Boom!” He whistled afterward and six large figures descended.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

They exuded mighty dragon-lord auras, looking like gods. His entourage became intimidated; they initially followed him, hoping to build a relationship for the future.

They didn’t expect him to have these powerful cultivators as guards. No wonder why he wasn’t afraid of anyone.

“Orthodox Six Gods!” The saintess was surprised to see these powerful dragon lords.

Rumor has it that they came from an ancient clan that was no longer around. Now, after coming across some ancient scrolls, they became dragon lords and vowed to establish their clan again.

Of course, some believed that they were merely embellishing their background and adding non-existent prestige.

“I am here under my master’s order to take all the king medicines in Immortal’s Peak.” Oddflame Pill Monarch was confident.

Some thought that this was a bold claim but others believed in his ability. After all, he had the alchemy knowledge and six capable cultivators.

“I will not show mercy to those who stand in my way.” He emphasized while staring at Li Qiye.

“Go!” He then focused on closing the seal in order to seize the lotus plant.

It tried to escape but couldn’t break the technique.

“Pop!” Li Qiye raised his hand and dispelled the seal, allowing the plant to run.

“Brat, you dare provoke me?!” The pill monarch was furious after seeing this.

“Yes.” Li Qiye responded.

“Fine, I will show you a fate worse than death then!” His eyes flashed murderously as he ordered: “Gods, capture him and tear out his tendons!”

“Oddflame, enough of this.” Shao Yao shouted.

“Saintess, this has nothing to do with you!” Oddflame was livid.

“Junior, surrender obediently now.” The leader of the six stepped forward and uttered coldly.

“You’re a dragon lord? Willing to be someone’s hound over some minor gains, how shameful.” Li Qiye criticized.

“Hmph, you’re asking for this!” The god roared.

“Don’t kill him, we’ll crucify him here to nourish the plants with his blood.” Oddflame snorted.

“Sigh, a bunch of fools. Since you want to capture all the king medicines, I’ll let you meet them.” Li Qiye said before whistling.

“Rumble!” Suddenly, numerous auras engulfed the sky.

“A ten-million-year vermillion tree!” The pill monarch spotted a divine tree with ripe fruits and became excited.

The six gods immediately rushed for these fruits. However, a vine whip forced all of them back.

“Six-wheel Godvine!” The pill monarch became startled again.

“Whoosh!” More medicine kings appeared - violet horse grass, seven-star crescent flower, timeworn flora…

Cultivators became ecstatic and immediately rushed for them. The six gods stabilized themselves and activated their power in order to form an energy net.

Unfortunately, these medicine kings seemed to be working together and summoned an incredible earth vein.

“Rumble!” Endless spirit energy oozed out of the vein.

“Shit!” The young monarch was a genius and could see that something was wrong, prompting him to escape.

As for the others, they were blinded by greed and didn’t grasp the situation correctly. The only thing on their mind was capturing the king medicines.

It was too late once they realized the precarious situation. The earth vein’s momentum suppressed everything.

“Ahh!” The human cultivators were reduced into meat paste by the pressure.

The six gods resisted the pressure but it was too late. The medicine kings’ roots drilled into their body for a draining process.

“Ahh!” Even their sacred fruits were devoured in no time at all.

These famous cultivators unexpectedly became dried corpses in the wilderness. The only person managing to escape was Oddflame Pill Monarch. He noticed that something was off after hearing Li Qiye’s whistle and decided to run.

“A stampede of king medicines…” Shao Yao turned pale since she had never seen so many of them together in one place.

“Alchemists can be too reckless, humans are viewed as potential food as well since these king medicines have lived for too long. Even a rabbit will bite when pushed to the edge.” Li Qiye said.

She trembled in horror due to the overwhelming auras. Li Qiye was right - any of them could eat her alive, just like cultivators eating plants and pills.

He waved his hand and the group immediately dispersed, once again shocking her.

She calmed down and thought that not even her master could do this. Only one person could do so - Heavenly Sage Yuan.

Though the world knew of Heavenly Sage Yuan as an ultimate alchemist, Shao Yao heard that the progenitor was actually an incredible agriculturist - capable of planting and nurturing king medicines.

One particular legend stated that when the progenitor visited a mountain, all the plants there wanted to leave with her. This included medicine kings.

Members of Alchemy Dao had never seen something similar in real life before until now. Shao Yao immediately believed that the legend was real after seeing Li Qiye’s summon.
