Chapter 5486: I Want To Be An Ox

“Sir, will I be fighting Celestial Court with it?” She took a deep breath and asked with a serious expression.

“No, I cannot wait that long. Celestial Court will not exist when you are ready.” Li Qiye shook his head.

This caused her to tremble because Celestial Court was an ancient existence. According to the legends, it had existed before the splitting of heaven and earth.

This was obviously an exaggeration. Nonetheless, it shared the same sentiment felt by many cultivators. Celestial Court had withstood the test of time, surviving one war after another.

Now, Li Qiye had absolute confidence in destroying it in the near future. Anyone else would have been branded a fool for making this statement. Of course, Li Qiye was an exception.

“Sir, what do you wish for me to do?” She asked, aware of her fortune in both being under Li Qiye’s tutelage and obtaining True Bones.

“Think grander, don’t be stuck with Celestial Court or this nonsense between The Race and The People.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I was short-sighted.” She lowered her head and apologized.

“Cultivation is a personal journey with a strong focus on the dao heart. You don’t need merit laws, the only thing I can do is to guide the way.” Li Qiye said.

“And that is all I need, Sir.” She said, not daring to be greedy.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“You don’t need to ask me what you should do, answer this question yourself during the journey.” Li Qiye said.

“What I should do.” She contemplated.

“You won’t be able to know the answer right now. Try again once you can wield True Bones.” He nodded.

“I understand.” She said.

He raised his hand and changed the fabrics of reality, opening a boundless world for her.

“Walk the path of the dao while listening to your heart.” He advised.

She stared at the portal and thought that upon her return, this world would change drastically.

“Would we be able to meet again?” She asked.

“If you travel far enough, then yes, we’ll meet again.” He said.

“I understand. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, I will repay you with my life in the future.” She performed nine kowtows in reverence.

He had given her enough confidence to attempt the twelve-fruit method on top of granting her True Bones. Moreover, she had a clear direction of what to do right now as well.

After paying her respect, she leaped into the portal without any hesitation.

Li Qiye closed the portal and wanted to leave. However, he frowned and glanced at someone.

“Young Noble.” The person immediately got on his knees and kowtowed as well.

He was none other than Ferocity who had followed Li Qiye previously.

“Why are you following me?” Li Qiye asked.

“I have no family or home, a forever vagabond with no option. May I stay with you and toil like an ox?” Ferocity was intelligent enough to know the great fortune of following Li Qiye.

Others would be killed for this insolence but he had the pleasure of following Li Qiye for a brief time. Perhaps he actually had a chance.

“I don’t need an ox.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“And it wouldn’t be your turn either, brat.” A massive snail approached the duo: “I’ll be the ox!”

The snail tapped on its shell loudly and said: “Young Master, I’ll carry you around.”

Li Qiye smiled, having far more patience for this snail than Ferocity.

Ferocity couldn’t respond because the snail was none other than Calamity Dao Lord. Of course, he didn’t know the history between these two back in Cleansing Incense.

“What have you learned?” Li Qiye shook his head disapprovingly.

“Young Master, I might not be the strongest but my techniques are still unique.” Niu Fen smiled wryly.

“So arrogant after learning the Eighteen Solutions.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Hey now, I have my own grand dao now, way better than the solutions.” Niu Fen protested.

“I suppose that sounds a bit better, you didn’t waste all this time.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Young Master, I’m a dao lord, you know? You’re making it sound as if I’m a nobody.” Niu Fen said indignantly. After all, he was an apex dao lord with few equals in the upper continents.

Li Qiye stared at him in silence, causing him to shrink his head down and add: “Of course, I’m just an insect compared to you, a firefly who can’t compete with the bright moon.”

“Your shamelessness far exceeds your cultivation.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Of course.” Niu Fen smiled happily: “Get on, Young Master, it’ll be just like the past.”

“What do you want?” Li Qiye was in a good mood as well.

“What else but to follow you wherever you go.” Niu Fen said.

“Fine, we’ll be going to the immortal continent since I’ll be following his path. You should focus on cultivation lest risk embarrassing yourself any further.” Li Qiye said.

“To the immortal continent then!” Niu Fen became excited: “We’ll crush Celestial Court and the old turtles in there!”

He reverted back to being Niu Fen from the nine worlds, no longer an apex cultivator of the six continents.

Li Qiye jumped on the shell and sat down.

“May I accompany the two of you, Young Noble and Senior?” Ferocity got on his knees.

Li Qiye smiled and summoned a short-handled trident out of thin air. He gave it to Ferocity and said: “Let’s see what you can do with this.”

“I humbly accept the gift!” Ferocity saw the weapon pulsing with primordial light and became startled. He didn’t forget to kowtow and show his gratitude.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye patted Niu Fen.

“Let’s go!” Niu Fen roared excitedly and disappeared into the horizon.
