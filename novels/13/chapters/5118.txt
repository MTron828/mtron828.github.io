Chapter 5119: Filthy Cockroach

Chrono Disk dispersed with the wind while everyone was left speechless. They have been on a ride of emotions after being turned into hopeless sheep ready to be slaughtered.

Actions were futile; only the upper continents could save them. This was especially true for the supreme geniuses and dragon lords since they were prime targets for Greenmountain Conqueror.

However, Li Qiye came out of the symbol like the warm sun rays and saved everyone. The future was bright once more.

Both sides found Li Qiye pleasant to the eyes regardless of their previous feeling about him. After all, who didn’t enjoy the rare sun during a frigid winter?

From hell to heaven in the blink of an eye - the contrast was drastic and made everyone reflect on certain issues.

Some thought that it wouldn’t be so bad if top cultivators such as conquerors didn’t exist.

Look at Reincarnation, so what if they had conquerors? Instead of being a protector, Greenmountain turned Reincarnation into an abyss. They could have lasted much longer without him.

“Feeling good?” Li Qiye asked Greenmountain with a smile.

The latter was crippled since his dao fruits have been destroyed. Death was calling even if Li Qiye were to spare him.

“Crowned in victory, condemned in defeat, kill me.” Greenmountain showed no sign of fear.

“That idiom is reserved for true cultivators who walk proudly and fight heroically. You, a cockroach who hid in the shadows to take advantage of others. You, are no conqueror.” Li Qiye disagreed.

“Hahaha.” Greenmountain suddenly laughed boisterously: “I am not the first and won’t be the last, haha… those stronger than me have done it before, even the epoch lords couldn’t resist the temptation.”

“That is why you are not worthy, the same for those who devour their own epoch. Don’t try to justify your filthy deeds with theirs.” Li Qiye said.

“Haha, and what about you? Perhaps one day, your fate will be like mine.” Greenmountain’s voice was harsh and grating.

“Save this for when you’re in hell. Only the weak speculate others’ intent based on their own lackings. Not everyone is as weak-willed as you.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Throughout the long years, some have fallen into depravity but many rose above it and worked for progress, not wasting a single moment fighting to keep the sunlight shining on the world. They never uttered a single word of complaint or regret.”

“No, men will always be the same…” Greenmountain didn’t buy it.

“Well, you’re not able to recognize someone exceptional for you have fallen.” Li Qiye said.

Greenmountain still didn’t believe that he had done anything wrong. Someone else would have done the same thing under the same circumstances. Everyone had the same darkness in their heart; all were cockroaches just like him - a justification for his actions.

“Death is right before you.” Li Qiye smiled.

Greenmountain’s withered face showed a touch of redness as he murmured: “Finally, it’s coming to welcome me.”

He devoured others for the sake of strength and life prolongation. If he hadn’t done so, he might have lived longer. However, death still arrived in the end - a karmic consequence of his sin.

“Kill him!” Someone suddenly shouted.

“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!” This started a chant from all the cultivators in the lower continents.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They had nothing but hatred for Greenmountain Conqueror, aware of the terrible fate had he been victorious. If anyone from Reincarnation were still alive, they would be shouting the same thing.

“Are you listening? Should I send you on your way or let the world judge you?” Li Qiye asked.

“... Kekeke…” Greenmountain’s laughter was creepy as if his throat had been torn apart. He made his choice and said: “Kill me.”

He didn’t have long to live given his current state. If others were to get a hold of him, they would torture and trample on him, letting him taste a fate worse than death. His dignity as a conqueror would be shattered.

“Very well, I will show mercy.” Li Qiye smiled and raised his foot.

Greenmountain closed his eyes and said nothing.

“Bam!” Li Qiye gathered the dao and stomped down, reducing him to a bloody mist.

This spelled the end of a conqueror. He wasn’t the most brilliant nor the strongest. Nonetheless, he left a deeper impression on the lower continents, even more so than Luminous or Heaven Burial Conqueror.

At the very least, Luminous and Heaven Burial still followed the same mold. Even someone like Maddened was rather normal in comparison.

What Greenmountain did was make people think that the world might be a better place without conquerors and unbeatable cultivators.
