Chapter 4265: Death

The figures floating above Nine-wheel and Sea Emperor seemed to be eternal and capable of untold destruction.

Dao laws poured down from them like heavenly waterfalls. They were at the dao lord level, resplendent and filled with peerless runes containing the truths of the dao lords. They rendered it impossible for anyone to get through.

Just one figure alone was enough to frighten all living beings. In this case, there were a total of nine.

If gods were to appear, they would still be considered insignificant compared to this force. Unlike the dread felt by others, the members of the two behemoths viewed these beings as the ultimate existences. They were uncontrollably emotional with tears streaming down their cheeks.

“The ancestors are here with us!” Both regular disciples and ancestors shouted.

The two overlords became overwhelmed as well and hope resurfaced. After all, this was the combined power of nine dao lords.

Meanwhile, the neutral spectators were horrified and immobilized by the various auras.

“Ancestors, please slay this monster and save us!” Many prostrating members from Sea Emperor beseeched.

“Ancestors, raise our banners and bring our glory back!” Those from Nine-wheel did the same thing.

The ancestors have returned in spiritual form so their morale was back. As long as these avatars were willing, they would be able to kill Li Qiye. In fact, they believed that their sincere effort to subdue the enemy had reached the dao lords. Thus, victory was on their side.

“Can anyone stop an attack from nine dao lords?” The crowd turned the sight on Li Qiye.

Those with complete confidence in Li Qiye wavered due to the insurmountable odds.

“Boom!” The dao lords actually answered the prayers of their sect members and made their move.

No one could see a damn thing due to the blinding radiance. The auras of these dao lords became flood-like and drowned out the entire world.

“Yes!” The two overlords and their fellow sect members were ecstatic.

However, the duo suddenly stopped and their eyes became wide open.

“Boom!” The incoming attack was shockingly aimed at them, not Li Qiye.

“Noo!” This was something they and their allies never expected. Why would the ancestors attack them instead of Li Qiye?

Everyone else became slack-jawed as well. Alas, they didn’t have any power to resist.

The true flames around them extinguished with haste and then the full brunt of the attack annihilated both their fate palaces and body. It only took a second for them to be reduced to a bloody mist.

The wind blew what’s left of their body away. This was the end for two supreme cultivators.

“Poof!” The ablaze foundation from both sects became normal again after their death. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

No one had an explanation for this development. When the avatars showed up, the members of the two sects thought that they would be able to destroy Li Qiye. He should have been annihilated by that attack, not their overlords.

Alas, this was indeed the reality and left them frozen for a long time.

“This can’t be!” After a while, they regained their wits and screamed in despair.
