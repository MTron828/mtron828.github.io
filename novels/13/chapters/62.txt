“Ahh...” The three sectional leaders shrieked miserably. The sound of bones breaking into pieces was incomparably hard for these people to hear. Everyone couldn’t help but feel their blood run cold. Without a doubt, the bones in the three sectional leader’s entire bodies were broken under this one kick.

Everyone shivered after they heard the sound of bones being fragmented. Warrior Canopy experts couldn’t even stop one kick from Li Qiye; just how frightening was this kick?

“Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique!” Li Shuangyan muttered to herself with a shocked expression. At this point, she had become clear on Li Qiye’s peerless Immortal Physique. It was one of the twelve, the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique.

The Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique’s heaviness could suffocate Gods and Devils. Once the physique appeared, it could suppress all magical laws. One had to know, to cultivate a peerless Immortal Physique was simply impossible for a mortal body, unless he was in possession of a peerless Immortal Physique Merit Law.

Since the eternal past till now, many Immortal Emperors have created peerless Immortal Physique Merit Laws; however, if it was a mortal body, the chance of success at cultivating an Immortal Physique was still minuscule.

Without a doubt, Li Qiye’s Immortal Physique was surely the original form. Reaching grand completion was only a matter of time! The meaning behind this was that Li Qiye’s physique merit law was even above an Immortal Emperor physique merit law. To be above an Immortal Emperor merit law; just what kind of physique merit law was this?

As Li Shuangyan thought up to this point, her expression greatly changed. She knew the implication behind this. The weakness of the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique was that its speed was too slow. However, the Kun Peng was an existence that possessed the fastest speed in this world. Li Qiye used the Kun Peng’s Six Variants as his Fate merit law, and this made up for the shortcoming of his Immortal Physique!

The Kun Peng’s Six Variants synergized with the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique; what kind of frightening existence was this? Li Qiye’s body was truly the most domineering and violent weapon in this world!

“Celestial Deities Imprisonment!” The moment Li Qiye had performed a mortal blow on the three sectional leaders, Leng Shizhi, who had escaped previously, sneaked an attack on Li Qiye. The Thirty-Six Celestial Deities Swords formation slashed towards Li Qiye with torrential sword auras that destroyed everything in its path; however, Li Qiye’s body was just like a Kun Peng, and he escaped the formation in the blink of an eye.

“Kun Peng’s Six Variants, be careful...” Protector Hu became alarmed, he had seen this merit law before. Out of everyone in the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, there was only the first elder that had practiced this law; this was the strongest Emperor merit law in the sect.

Li Qiye’s speed was too swift while Leng Shizhi was too slow to avoid, two cold auras flashed, a “Phoosh” sound rang, and the two Invisible Dual Blades pinned his body into the ground!

He was still wearing the godly armor on his body. One had to know, the godly armor on his body was crafted from Godly Gold metal; however, under the Invisible Dual Blades, his godly armor was like a thin piece of paper that was suddenly nailed to the ground!

“Ah...” With his body nailed to the ground, Leng Shizhi miserably bellowed.

“You couldn’t even understand one-tenth of the sword formation’s profound truth, yet you still wanted to trap me?” Li Qiye smiled insipidly with a severe gaze that showed he wanted to cut Leng Shizhi.

“Phoosh...” In the blink of an eye, a gust of wind rushed forward with blood energy blazing chaotically like a storm. Suddenly, Protector Hu made a move and snuck an attack behind Li Qiye. He wanted to pierce through Li Qiye’s chest with one move.

However, this one move was stopped by a single palm. Protector Hu had to take a few steps back.

The person who stopped this blow for Li Qiye was not Li Shuangyan, but it was Tu Buyu, who was always wearing an amicable smile. Unknownst to all, second brother Tu Buyu had already stood to the side.

“Protector Hu, as a protector, sneaking an attack on a disciple can’t be considered part of the rules.” No matter the occasion, Tu Buyu’s smile was always present.

Protector Hu let out a deafening roar: “Die!” He didn’t want to waste any words and he let out a long roar. He opened his mouth and spat out a pagoda. The appearance of this pagoda exuded an unending and boundless killing aura. The sound of the ghosts that continuously wailed tortured the ears as if one was in hell.

The pagoda’s appearance caused each magical law to descend. A loud “bang” sound occurred; this caused endless magical laws to transform into a humongous whirlpool. Within this whirlpool, completed runes were absorbed and spat out as the incomplete runes interweaved with each other into a composition. Once this composition appeared, it felt like it could annihilate all existences and swallow their souls.

In the end, Protector Hu was a Heaven’s Primal expert. This was the defining boundary for cultivators. Once a Heaven’s Primal expert made a move, a strong and unyielding aura immediately would come to be.

“Protector Hu’s Suppressing Evil Technique isn’t bad.” Tu Buyu wore his smile again and suddenly emanated sword vibrations. In a flash, his entire body brought in and sent out the Sword’s Spirit with his whole body that became a Sword Domain. Tu Buyu flew inside the Sword’s Spirit – into the sky like a proud God of War.

“Clank...” One sword slew the whole nine worlds! One sword struck down! The universe’s light came to an end! Under one sword, the entirety of heaven and earth were completely swept away! Tu Buyu’s hand was not carrying a sword, but his Sword Spirit encompassed the whole of the Heavens and the Earth.

“Formula of the God of War!” Seeing Tu Buyu’s move, Li Qiye beamingly smiled. His expression became serious, and his eyes stared straight at Tu Buyu.

In reality, the moment when Tu Buyu’s God of War Formula came out, Li Shuangyan was also shocked. She had suddenly remembered a legend regarding the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.

Protector Hu cultivated the Suppressing Evil Technique. One could say that this was a powerful Heavenly King method! Even though the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had fallen, and their Emperor laws were gone; as an Immortal Emperor Sect that had ruled over an ancient kingdom for millions of years, they still possessed many Ancient Saint, Heavenly Monarch, and Virtuous Paragon methods! These were also the powerful heritages of the sect, and, even though they had the methods, the sect lacked the inheritors!

The scenario of the God of War Formula that faced the Suppressing Evil Technique was not in the least suspenseful. In reality, Tu Buyu’s cultivation was not shallow either.

One “Bang” sounded. Tu Buyu didn’t have a physical sword, but once the God of War Formula was activated, the pagoda of Protector Hu couldn’t stop it. The suppressed pagoda was struck away by the spiritual sword, and Protector Hu wasn’t able to stabilize it. He was knocked away by the powerful sword’s spirit while he also violently sprayed a mouthful of fresh blood.

In a flash, Li Qiye disappeared. As his body turned into a Kun Peng, the heavenly transformation’s shocking absolute speed came into full-display! The moment Protector Hu fell down from the sky, Li Qiye instantly appeared in front of him.

In this quick moment, Li Qiye’s single kick ruthlessly struck downward like a whip. Protector Hu was already gravely wounded and was falling down from the sky; with Li Qiye suddenly making a move, he had no chance to escape, nor could he activate his Life Treasure. Li Qiye was too quick.

At this moment, Protector Hu raised his two hands like a heavenly king erecting a pagoda; he only wanted to stop the one kick of Li Qiye from thrashing down.

“Snap!” The sound of bones being broken rang out. Without any doubt, the technique essentially couldn’t stop this single kick from Li Qiye. A pitiful “Ahh” sound was soon heard. Li Qiye’s kick ruthlessly struck Protector Hu’s body, and the crackling sound of bones breaking sounded endlessly in the air.

“Bang” The moment they fell to the ground, the earth trembled. Protector Hu’s body was hammered by Li Qiye on top of the earth; at this moment, there was no saving Protector Hu. His whole body was deformed and had nearly become a fleshy paste.

The Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique: the supreme physique! Once the grand completion stage was reached, it was enough to make the Gods and Devils tremble in fear. The physical body alone was enough to crush the galaxy and suppress the heavenly skies!

Even though Li Qiye’s body had not reached grand completion, the weight of his body could be calculated in the millions of Jun.

Protector Hu was extremely unlucky; he was a Heaven’s Primal expert, yet still died in the hands of a Physique Accumulation disciple. No one could ever have the same misfortune as him.

Even if Li Qiye had the supreme physique, it wouldn’t have been this easy for him to kill Protector Hu. It was a shame that Protector Hu had also met the mysterious Tu Buyu. Tu Buyu’s move caused him to be mortally wounded, and, facing Li Qiye in addition, he didn’t have the strength for another fight. It would even be considered strange if he survived.

“Why the need to go this far.” Tu Buyu shook his head smilingly after seeing Li Qiye kill Protector Hu. Still, he didn’t try to stop Li Qiye.

At this point, no matter if it was Luo Fenghua or a different disciple from the Cleansing Jade Peak, their hearts shivered. Even though Li Qiye normally disciplined them to the point of bloodiness, they had never seen Li Qiye radiate such terrible killing intent before.

However, Li Qiye’s first move was killing all three sectional leaders and a protector. This vicious method was completely incongruous with a supposed thirteen-year-old boy. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Killing Protector Hu had no impact on Li Qiye. Li Qiye walked in front of Leng Shizhi, who was nailed down to the ground with fresh blood all over the place.

Even now, Leng Shizhi was still confused. He was a Warrior Canopy expert, so why did he lose to a new disciple that had only joined for less than one year? Li Qiye’s cultivation was obviously far below him, but he was, on the contrary, no match for Li Qiye!

In many cases, with a lower cultivation rank, merit laws alone weren’t enough to fill the gap. Even if he was practicing an Emperor merit law, there was no chance to be at the Physique Accumulation rank; yet, to still be able to defeat someone at the Warrior Canopy rank...

Even then, Li Qiye was Li Qiye; other cultivators couldn’t be compared to him. He understood the ultimate Dao truths of the Kun Peng’s Six Variants!

Li Qiye looked at Leng Shizhi and cheerfully said: “The sword formation was not bad; if you could have understood three parts, then maybe you could have actually trapped me. Unfortunately, you couldn’t even understand one part, yet you dared to be arrogant in front of me. I can only say, you were courting death!”

“You, don’t be rash. I, I, my master is an elder, yo-you, you...” At this moment, Leng Shizhi’s courage was completely broken. He didn’t think of such a result as this. Shouldn’t it have been as easy as turning one’s hand for three sectional leaders and his older brother to kill a disciple like Li Qiye?

“I know...” Leng Shizhi hadn’t finished his words when a “snap” rang out. Li Qiye twisted his skull; Leng Shizhi didn’t even have the chance to scream.

“Even if your master was a Mortal Emperor, I would still kill him without mercy.” Li Qiye threw Leng Shizhi’s head to one side, then rubbed both of his palms together in a carefree and calm manner like nothing had happened.

At this point, the Cleansing Jade Peak disciple’s legs became weak. In their eyes, Li Qiye was a death god that killed three sectional leaders and a protector as well as slaying Leng Shizhi in one breath; and, while doing so, his expression didn’t change even once. One had to know, killing a sectional leader or a protector called for the death penalty in violation of the sectorial laws! To Li Qiye though, this matter was seemingly meaningless!

“Do you want me to personally take you out of the Cleansing Jade Peak or not?” Li Qiye brilliantly smiled at the group of law enforcement disciples; his expression was both amicable and adorable.

Seeing the amicable and cute countenance of Li Qiye, the legs of these disciples greatly trembled. How was he merely a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy? Li Qiye was clearly an evil butcher! Li Qiye didn’t need to say a second sentence before these disciples immediately rushed out of the Cleansing Jade Peak.
