Chapter 5428: No Regrets

“What is he talking about, predecessors?” A conqueror asked.

“Don’t worry, I will explain.” Illumination seemed to be enjoying the moment: “Back during a forgotten era, someone created a way to destroy an entire race, truly a peerless feat.”

Everyone exchanged glances after hearing this. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It won’t amount to anything.” Swordsea uttered coldly since he had nothing but disdain for Illumination.

All-things Dao Lord emphasized balance and harmony but Swordsea did everything according to his own will and never compromised. His actions were driven solely by his beliefs.

Thus, he didn’t give a damn about Illumination’s past, contributions, or any remarkable quality.

Illumination didn’t mind and elaborated: “Sure, my version is not perfect and I am missing the ancestral blood. With it, I would be able to exterminate all three branches.”

Eternal Conqueror and the others scowed after hearing this.

“Nonetheless, I now possess the most ancient bloodline of the heavener, him!” Illumination raised his cosmic hand and chased away the darkness from the mysterious entity.

This revealed the person inside - a slumbering old man with a magnificent aura. Words couldn’t describe his greatness.

“!!!” Eternal, Swordsea, and other cultivators of their caliber became startled. Supreme’s demeanor shifted entirely as well.

Illumination lowered his hand and the fog shielded the old man once more.

“Now, do you believe me? I shall strike him and trace his bloodline downward. Anyone with a similar bloodline will be reduced to ashes afterward for no one can match my current state. Heaveners shall be no more after today.” Illumination’s laughter became increasingly manic, seemingly pleased with his masterpiece of a plan.

“Brother, stop right here. You will be killing The People as well, heaven and earth do not tolerate such an evil act.” All-things appeared closer to the battlefield.

“Hahaha, heaveners among The People deserve death as well. Heaven and earth can feel free to try and stop me.” Illumination laughed.

The four apex cultivators exchanged glances, realizing that they had been overconfident.

“We must kill him now.” All-things told the others.

This was the time to let go of personal feuds since Illumination had come up with a truly horrific plan. All heaveners might actually be killed, mortals included.

“It is too late now, I am no longer afraid of the four of you working together.” Illumination said.

“The power you’re borrowing is limited so you’re only twice as strong, at best. We can surely kill you.” Eternal uttered coldly.

The crowd no longer spoke since the battle?was reaching its climax. Even Illumination’s supporters thought that he was crazy for killing members of The People. They had no problem with killing Heaven Alliance and even The Race. However, this didn’t include their own.

“Sure.” Illumination admitted: “But you can’t kill me before I exterminate the heaveners.”

Supreme and the others maintained a calm demeanor. Nonetheless, they wondered if they could actually kill Illumination in time.

“I have no regrets since I’ll be burying the heaveners with me. It’s a shame that I won’t be able to take down The Race, but I have tried my best.” Illumination laughed heartily like a madman.

“You will be burying no one but yourself since even an ant would feel offended by being buried with a fool like you.” Someone else appeared on the battlefield.

Spectators who were disappointed with Illumination saw that the newcomer was an ordinary-looking youth.

“Li Qiye!” Most immediately recognized him.
