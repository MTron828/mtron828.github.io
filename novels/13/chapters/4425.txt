Chapter 4426: One Slash

The second swing was the opposite of the first - slow and observable. It also gave the impression of mastery and steadiness.

The trajectory of the saber divided the myriad laws and split heaven and earth. Everyone assumed that he would use extreme speed again. Alas, this swing was moving at a snail’s pace.

Nonetheless, it still shocked Jian Qingzhu. On the surface, it seemed ordinary but because she was its creator, she could see the clear transformation.

His performance could be traced back to the source, being as simple as can be. Though she could perform it quite elegantly, it looked rather flashy compared to his.

He had reached a state of apogee with perfect movement. One more inch would be too much and one fewer would be too little. It seemed that he had measured the swing to the exact.

The minute transformations were imperceptible by the spectators for they contain the most profound aspects of the dao.

She took a deep breath and tried to focus on catching the details. She thought that he was the saber technique’s creator, not her. Usually, creators had the best grasp on any particular technique.

Now, it looked like she was a student who hasn’t done a good job of comprehending it. This was rather confusing because she hasn’t taught him before. Nonetheless, his attainment had far exceeded hers.

“Whoosh!” It cut through the lotus petals like a butcher’s blade cutting through fat, meeting zero resistance.

“Boom!” The lotus itself felt threatened and became resplendent. The next layer of petals increased in size and flew towards Li Qiye with the force of a thousand mountains.

Unfortunately, the strongest state of the lotus was still not enough to match this profound slash. It continued forward and cut through all the layers as if they were blocks of tofu.

Meanwhile, the ex-sect master’s spear’s flames drew closer. The rays intended on obliterating Li Qiye.

He swung his saber again with the grace of a phoenix. The incoming inferno was immediately devoured by an invisible phoenix. The strongest flames meant nothing before this divine beast.

It then cut through several suns, causing them to explode and nearly send the ex-sect master flying.

However, once he calmed down, he saw Li Qiye’s saber inches away from his chest. He screamed and summoned a special mirror - his strongest defense. This was still not enough and the blade crushed it.

“Splash!” Blood gushed out from his chest as he screamed and started falling to the ground.

People became speechless as they saw the drops of blood dripping down Li Qiye’s blade.

Sure, the ex-sect master was far from being an apex existence. Nonetheless, a seven-dao sovereign was still quite impressive when compared to a junior. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

That wound was deep and frightening. The ex-sect master sealed the opening and stopped the bleeding.

Alas, his face was pale as he trembled while standing. It could be from fear or just blood loss.

The crowd was shaken to see the decisive exchange. However, the most shocked was still Jian Qingzhu. She didn’t realize that her own saber art could be so profound. She understood the next steps after observing Li Qiye.

“Just one swing again.” One expert commented after calming down.

The three ancient ancestors were deep in rumination, wondering if they could have come out unscathed from that slash earlier.

“That was to let you feel death. The next will take your life, will your son come and save you?” Li Qiye smiled.

“You!” The ex-sect master trembled, feeling both fear and anger. The latter was much more overwhelming.

This wasn’t his first time participating in a life-or-death battle. Alas, he thought that there was a death god with a cruel visage smirking in front of him - Li Qiye. He could indeed feel death incoming.

“Now, accept it.” Li Qiye smiled and raised his saber again.

“Fellow Daoist, show mercy!” Featherhat Paragon rushed over with lightning speed, wanting to save the ex-sect master. He couldn’t just stand and watch since he was working for Five-sun King.

“How meddlesome.” Li Qiye casually swung his blade.

“Splash!” It cut the paragon, leaving a bone-deep wound with blood gushing out.

He looked down at his chest and saw the horizontal wound, realizing that he was almost cut into two pieces. He immediately stopped, not daring to move forward.

The crowd finally got what they wanted - another swift slash. Unfortunately, they couldn’t see anything again.

“Are you ready?” Li Qiye smiled and asked the ex-sect master.

“You… don’t be insane… my son will avenge me and kill all your clan members…” The ex-sect master staggered backward repeatedly while shouting.

“Not this again. Die.” Li Qiye took one step forward.

“Stop!” Peacock Monarch could no longer watch this development.
