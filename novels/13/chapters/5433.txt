Chapter 5434: Promise

All-things knew that although Supreme was antagonistic, he didn’t pose as much of a threat compared to Illumination.

If Illumination had been allowed to act untethered, he would eventually lead The People to damnation. His death today erased a heavy burden on All-things’ shoulders.

“Goodbye now, gentlemen.” He turned toward the others and immediately left.

“After him!” Supreme immediately gave chase.

“Fellow Daoist, you should stick around a little longer.” Eternal laughed and began the pursuit as well.

They believed that this was the best opportunity to capture All-things and all of Dao Alliance. It would end the conflict with The Race standing on top.

All-things began scheming with Ye Fantian’s capture, wanting to bait Illumination and Supreme into killing each other.

It turned out that Illumination would have been the final victor in this match. His only misstep was not knowing the connection between the ancient heavener and Li Qiye, resulting in the latter’s interference.

The end of one match meant the start of another - Supreme and Eternal’s pursuit.

“That’s it for the Pact of Blessed.” The spectating dragon lords and conquerors saw this and knew that peace was no more.

***

All-things leaped into a different dimension but his opponents were able to keep up with his pace.

He suddenly turned around and stopped.

“Gentlemen, you don’t have to be so kind as to follow me the entire way.” All-things said.

Supreme and Eternal stopped, seemingly expecting him to stop.

“Brother, let’s put an end to our conflict now.” Supreme said.

“Don’t tell me you have the goal of destroying an entire side as well.” All-things smiled.

“No, that is the wish of a madman. However, I am loyal to Celestial Court. Since the six continents are under the court’s jurisdiction, I must force The People to comply as well.” Supreme shook his head.

“Rather ambitious, wanting to unite all six continents.” All-things said.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You misunderstood, I do not care about authority. It’s a matter of doing my best to carry out my task.” Supreme said.

“Why must you involve yourself in such worldly matters? It is unbecoming of your ability and potential.” All-things said.

“Perhaps things would be different if I was born in Eight Desolaces instead of Celestial Court. I could be carefree and detached from these issues.” Supreme answered sincerely.

All-things knew that he couldn’t convince Supreme. He turned to Eternal and said: “And you, Brother, you never cared about Celestial Court back in the lower continents and there will always be a spot for you in Immortal Dao.”

“I am not working for Celestial Court and won’t be joining Immortal Dao either.” Eternal said: “I’ll be freed from attachments and worldly affairs after returning this favor.”

“Your words carry a lot of weight.” All-things said sentimentally.

Eternal Conqueror was a legendary figure not bound to the upper continents. In fact, no one expected him to side with Celestial Court considering his exploits back in the lower continents.

Alas, top cultivators’ words were worth more than gold. Immortal Pagoda Conqueror committed to protecting Alchemy Dao and Immensity Conqueror went as far as giving Illumination a dream order.

Eternal - the man who united the lower continents and disobeyed Celestial Court - had to work with Divine Alliance.

“An emperor’s promise should be unbreakable.” Eternal said.

“I agree.” All-things said.

Many top cultivators took their promises to heart regardless of their stance. In fact, one day when a few fell into the darkness, they would still try their best to keep these promises. Eternal was one of them, hence his current allegiance.

“You should submit now, Brother.” Supreme said.

“How confident are you in carrying out this task?” All-things asked.

“If there is no more unexpected interference, one hundred percent.” Supreme didn’t hide it.

“Oh?” All-things stopped smiling because Supreme was neither arrogant nor ignorant.

The two of them have struggled for generations now without a victor. This was because neither side had confidence in a complete victory.

“What did Celestial Court give you?” All-things asked.

“It’s been here all along, it just required more time. That’s why some choose to stay here in the upper continents, you included.” Supreme said.

The three of them were apex cultivators capable of ascending to the immortal continent. However, they had their own reasons for sticking around.

Most never returned to the lower continents but the upper two continents occasionally had visitors from above.

“So Celestial Court’s ace card is ready now?” All-things inquired again.

Eternal glanced at Supreme as well, curious about the answer.

“Just a few.” Supreme nonchalantly said.
