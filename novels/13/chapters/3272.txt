Huang Jie’s support of Li Qiye made it difficult for Zhan Hu. The latter couldn’t question Huang Jie’s authority at this moment.

A few smart disciples immediately noticed that this went beyond a regular conflict. Even the relatively slower ones realized by now.

Humans and demons didn’t coexist peacefully in Divine Black. Zhan Hu came from Furious Tiger so he was naturally on the demons’ side. On the other hand, Huang Jie and Liu Leilong came from Eight Zhang, the camp of the humans.

Thus, this issue of Li Qiye was only a spark. The real problem was the ongoing competition between the two races.

“Junior Uncle Huang, you want to protect this villain too?” Zhan Hu strongly replied while trying to gain the moral high ground.

Huang Jie was too experienced to be deterred by this accusation. He responded: “He’s not a villain just because you say so. It’s a bit too early for that conclusion. Why are you so eager to push a regular disciple to his death? What is your actual intention, Virtuous Nephew?”

Huang Jie was far more eloquent compared to the hotheaded Fuyou, able to turn the situation against Zhan Hu.

Many humans present gave Zhan Hu a weird stare. On one hand, Li Qiye didn’t have a good reputation nor friends in Divine Black.

The majority of people didn’t have a good impression of him. That’s why they sneered at the start of the conflict.

However, the optics have shifted. Why was Zhan Hu so eager to push Li Qiye towards death? The guy was only a regular disciple.

Even in the case of Li Qiye being guilty, it wasn’t up to Zhan Hu to carry out the punishment. This required the permission of their peak lord.

Some human disciples felt that Zhan Hu was taking advantage of this to suppress their race. Their dislike towards Li Qiye suddenly switched to a feeling of solidarity. They felt the urge to team up against Zhan Hu.

“Your accusation is baseless and misses the point. I am simply performing my duty and upholding my responsibility, there is zero personal motive here...”

“I’m glad to hear that, you’re definitely the pride of our sect.” Huang Jie swiftly interrupted: “I’m sure you have no problem with letting the elders and peak lords decide then. I will certainly report to them how dutiful you were.”

Zhan Hu suddenly had no excuse to capture Li Qiye, unable to carry out his agenda.

“Hmph, I hope so.” He snorted in response: “Lawlessness isn’t tolerated in Jade Bird, all perpetrators will have to pay eventually regardless of their backing. I’ll make sure of it.”

“It is our fortune to have someone like you around.” Huang Jie clapped while smiling.

However, the main party, Li Qiye, was still walking away and didn’t hear a single thing.

Fuyou caught up and asked: “Young Master, do you have anything to add?”

He hoped that Li Qiye would say some de-escalating words that fit the current situation. He didn’t want Li Qiye to cause trouble everywhere in Divine Black.

“What is there to say? Just one dead guy, even a million dead is no big deal.” Li Qiye continued walking without looking back.

Fuyou couldn’t do anything but smile wryly. Huang Jie was caught off guard by Li Qiye’s aggressive comment as well.

“Hmph, did you all hear that?” Zhan Hu unhappily scowled.

The ones nearby thought that Li Qiye was being too arrogant. He certainly didn’t earn any goodwill with that answer.

The news of Yang Si’s death traveled across Divine Black, shocking one listener after another.

Their astoundment was understandable since a Silver Carapace cultivator being crushed to death by a statue was practically unheard of. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“What a terrible, terrible way to go.” Most shared this thought.

“But how?” The older ones were confused. The statue couldn’t weigh that much while Yang Si should have been able to lift up ten thousand pounds.

“Li Qiye must have done something.” Yang Si’s friends said with indignation.

“That’s impossible.” Others didn’t think that a Mortal Shell could pull this off, killing a Silver Carapace regardless of the methods.

“It’s just a coincidence, a terrible stroke of luck.” Another concluded.

However, weird things have certainly been happening around Li Qiye.

“Someone else might be behind this.” Another disciple came up with another possibility.

He thought that someone stronger than Yang Si might have done something from the shadows. A few disciples came up with some names but didn’t dare to say it outloud.

Making baseless accusations was a grave offense especially when it was directed towards the seniors.

Of course, Zhan Hu didn’t let this go so easily. He went to complain to the elders and the five peak lords.

The wolf king, Zhang Yue, took this matter seriously. First, he held high regard for Zhan Hu. Second, this death happened under his jurisdiction.

“Thoroughly investigate this. Report back to me when you find something.” Zhang Yue ordered.

“Peak Lord, there’s no way a Mortal Shell cultivator can kill a Silver Carapace. Someone else did something.” A disciple nearby said softly.

“Don’t speculate without evidence or face the consequences.” A flash appeared in Zhang Yue’s eyes then dimmed down. He then uttered coldly.

“Yes, I understand.” The disciple became afraid and lowered his head.

“Tell Zhan Hu that he has my full support regardless of the opposition. Figure out what’s wrong with this Li Qiye.” Zhang Yue went on.

The disciple acknowledged the command and left.

Zhang Yue started contemplating while looking outside with a cold expression.

Fuyou’s return didn’t matter since the guy was no longer a threat. However, these new recruits gave him an ominous feeling.

Certain circumstances landed him his position. Many others were eyeing his seat. Just one mistake and he could be replaced.

“Crushed by a statue.” The bodhi king stood still after receiving Zhan Hu’s complaint: “How mysterious.”

“Is it just a coincidence?” His disciple found it strange as well but kept his comments to himself.

“Too much to be a coincidence.” The king elaborated: “That statue has been around for millions of years. Have you ever heard of it falling down?”

The disciple agreed with this. That statue was built by their patriarch and never had unstable issues before. Now, it fell down right on top of Yang Si?
