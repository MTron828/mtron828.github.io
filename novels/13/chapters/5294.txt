Chapter 5295: Supreme’s Decree

The master of the armament was none other than World Emperor - a Grand Emperor that had once ruled the thirteen continents.

He was utterly unstoppable with the help of Moon Embrace, having the confidence to disobey Celestial Court during their inquisition against The People.

He and his clan stood before the might of Celestial Court, preventing them from taking one step further. This gave enough time for the remnants of The People to escape and recoup.

Rumor has it that eventually, he fell in battle and his clan was wiped out. Moon Embrace disappeared in the river of time as well.

Today, it had returned with the intention of entering Lesser Firmament through the crystal wall. This naturally shocked all the spectators, especially those who had the pleasure of witnessing World Emperor’s might in the past. Though he had passed away, he still lived in their heart.

“... Where have I seen this before?” The man in the tavern stood up and murmured after seeing the armor.

He couldn’t help touching his chest. In this split second, it was as if he was wearing Moon Embrace - a perfect fit that felt just right.

All eyes were on the crystal wall and the armor. Hearts started beating faster because there were only five immortal armaments in existence.

As far as the public knew, Purewood Divine Emperor had one. Crimson Emperor inherited one from Flame Emperor. However, it was lost after his death during Immemorial Epoch War.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Immortal Monarch Yi Ye had one as well, inherited from Six-Dao Monarch. As for the last immortal monarch, it had never appeared before so no one knew what it was or its current location.

These armaments followed them into Immortal Dao City, so it has been a long time since one was seen in public. Was this just a coincidence or an omen of what was to come?

Remember, this armor set was far more precious than any treasure at the imperial or dao lord level. This particular one had proven its value numerous times in battle.

“Moon Embrace…” Xiao Qingtian’s eyes gleamed as he teleported closer and reached for the armor.

The moon within the armor immediately became resplendent and sent him flying. He spun ten times or so before regaining stability, almost spitting out blood.

The armor’s auto defense easily repelled a twelve-fruit dragon lord before everyone’s eyes. Meanwhile, it continued to fuse with the crystal wall in an attempt of breaching Lesser Firmament.

“Boom!” The fog billowed and reached for that section like tentacles.

“Seal!” The majestic figures continued to perform a powerful seal against the fog, attempting to stop it from reaching the armor.

“What is that thing? Did it summon Moon Embrace?” The big shots took a deep breath after seeing the mysterious force.

Other dao lords and emperors gazed deep into Lesser Firmament, wanting to find more information on this mysterious being.

“Lesser Firmament is suppressing something extremely powerful.” An emperor from a distant realm whispered.

Everyone could tell that Lesser Firmament was in full lockdown. The emperors and monarchs there did not take this matter lightly.

“Fellow Daoists, let us help you subdue this evil!” Heaven Hammer shouted again.

“No need, leave.” Immortal Emperor Guan Feng wasn’t as polite this time in his refusal.

Outsides exchanged glances, wondering why Lesser Firmament didn’t want any help.

‘Whoosh!” Violent gales uprooted mountains before crushing them into bits. An auspicious cloud with a golden outline emerged and illuminated everything.

It smashed into the barrier and caused Lesser Firmament to quake. There was a conqueror standing on top of the cloud who declared: “Lesser Firmament, heed the decree from Supreme.”

The conqueror had a sacred aura; his robe was gilded extravagantly from top to bottom. He seemed to be the master of the elements, capable of summoning rains and winds. His very presence blotted out the sky.

“Godcloud Conqueror!” A big shot shouted.
