Chapter 4559: Skeletal Duck

“It might be a divine egg.” Ancestors swallowed their saliva.

“Taking this egg back and incubating it might give us a divine beast, it’ll protect the sect for generations to come.” One sect master murmured.

It wasn’t impossible for a top power to train a supreme cultivator. However, they normally would only be able to protect the sect for only one generation or even a shorter period. After all, humans had their own ambition and desire.

On the other hand, grooming a divine beast meant gaining its protection for generations to come. The sect’s prosperity would be assured.

“Do it already.” A spectator murmured.

Sure enough, a figure appeared next to the four phantoms. He wore a silver robe so his movement looked like a lightning bolt.

“Extreme Lightning King!” A high elder recognized the powerful cultivator.

“A sovereign who has reached the limit of speed.” A few big shots were surprised.

THough he wasn’t the strongest sovereign, he became world-renowned for his speed. People said that if he wanted to escape, no one could ever catch up to him.

Everyone naturally knew his intention - taking the chest away from the Pilfering Phantoms.

“Buzz.” The king raised his speed to the limit, leaving a trail of particles as he rushed through the air. He grabbed the chest and instantly made it away.

Spectators still saw afterimages of him next to the four villains but in reality, his true body was no longer there.

“Boom!” The four phantoms immediately took action and used their power.

Meanwhile, everyone thought that the king was successful because he was ten million miles away already.

“So fast!” They couldn’t believe it.

Unfortunately, four spirits appeared behind the thieves, raising their hands in the king’s direction and pulling back. Time seemed to be dragged back and the king appeared next to them again.

“Pluff!” Blood splashed in the air since one spirit pulled out the king’s heart in a gruesome fashion. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Ahh!” The king bellowed and then fell dead to the ground.

Spectators were stunned since they didn’t understand the transpired events. The king clearly made it far away yet the spirits of these villains instantly dragged him back. They seemed to have control of time and pulled a temporal reversal.

“What happened?” Not to mention the young generation, even a few experts were lost.

An ancient big shot calmly explained: “This is their ace move, Ray Grasp. It is capable of stealing back the time that has just passed by.”

“I see…” This scene and technique left a deep impression on the crowd.

The death of Extreme Lightning King didn’t deter the next participant. An ancestor appeared with eight layers of rotating shields and an ancient pagoda above him.

“Skyshield Heavenly Sovereign!” Many ancestors from the same generation recognized him.

“Go!” He instantly made a move. The pagoda came crashing down toward the skeletal duck with unstoppable momentum and divinity. During this suppression, he reached for the golden egg on the duck’s back.

“Crack!” The duck pecked at the sovereign once.

His eyes opened wide open in horror. Next, blood dripped down from a hole on his forehead.

“Bam!” The eight layers of shields crumbled and he fell straight down. His blood stained the bridge.

“What?!” Spectators couldn’t believe it. His defenses went down to a single peck from the skeletal duck.

“How can this creature be so strong?” One ancestor mumbled.

With the word “shield” in his title, the ancestor obviously had a capable defense. Alas, it didn’t last a single second versus the duck.

“Just what is this duck?” Another wondered.

A first-gen ancestor from a clan stared at the golden egg and said: “The creature is so mighty yet it still wants to bring the egg into the reincarnation cycle. It has to be a divine egg.”

The value of the egg became clear. Unfortunately, obtaining it seemed impossible.

“Kill!” By this point, many cultivators and big shots have chosen their target and began attacking.

Screams ensued because many died right away despite coming prepared. Remember that these corpses used to be unbeatable masters.

Nonetheless, greed blinded the attempters. Plus, the cultivation world required taking risks to move forward. It didn’t take long for the stench of blood to permeate the air.

Both the corpses and the emissary turned a blind eye to the slaughter. The corpses only retaliated once provoked, nothing more.

“It’s coming.” At this time, the Improper Four noticed something coming from the cemetery.

A treant got out of the grave, looking like a charred tree that has been hit by lightning and fire. This seemed to be the result of a terrible tribulation.

He had four legs and the face of an old man on the trunk, no differently from a friendly grandpa. Despite being dead, one of the branches had a leaf larger than a human palm. It was verdant like jade, seemingly filled with water and life force.
