Chapter 4823: Silly Da

This aura of death could be construed as life for the dark affinity - something rather contradictory.

It engulfed Eight Desolaces and gathered at cemeteries, tombs, and ancient battlefields. Nether winds blew through these places and suddenly, corpses climbed out of their resting place.

On the battlefield, souls appeared and hovered around until they took on a humanoid shape once more.

“Ancestors?!” This happened in many clans and sects.

“The ancestors are coming back!” This scared the hell out of cultivators.

This also occurred in the ancestral halls of clans and kingdoms. Yin energy manifested in the statues and memorial tablets. They turned into specters and came out to the horror of their descendants.

Normally, ancestors manifesting in spiritual form was something worth celebrating. The descendants would prostrate and show their love. This didn’t apply to this particular scenario.

“Eight-sun Divine Monarch, Skysoar Ancestor, Six-blade God, Earthbreaker Bull…”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Corpses and specters appeared all over Eight Desolaces. Worst of all, they were once famous cultivators that have dominated their generation.

The moment they came out, they launched an attack on those nearby.

“Ahh!” Screams could be heard everywhere.

Eight-sun Divine Monarch released eight rampaging suns and turned his own sect into ashes.

Skysoar Ancestor leaped upward before descending to destroy ten schools nearby. The people in the territory wailed in agony.

Six-blade God destroyed the celestials with a vertical slash, unleashing absolute carnage across a kingdom…

“Run!” Some top cultivators’ first reaction after seeing their ancestors was to get the hell away.

This scene was repeated throughout the land. As the corpses and specters destroy kingdoms and clans, the blood and flesh of the victims were reaped and sent back to Undying Lord. His armor flashed brightly while receiving the delicious meals.

“It’s been a long time since I’ve tasted this.” Undying Lord savored the moment.

However, his feast was stopped short. Bronze spears descended and pierced the corpses and specters, crucifying and killing them.

Massive bronze statues landed next and exuded an ancient light. They roared and joined the various battlefields while attempting to negate the death aura.

They were fueled by a supreme power, evident by the primordial light sweeping away the death energy.

“This legion is insane.” Peerless cultivators became intimidated by the sheer efficiency of this mysterious legion.

“I’ve heard about them in the legends, they’re actually here to save us now.” An ancient patriarch was moved to tears.

He had a particular scroll describing this legion and now, they were here during this moment of crisis.

Undying Lord didn’t react to the legion suppressing his death aura. He only glanced around for a moment. After all, his target was Li Qiye, not Eight Desolaces.

“Brother Da, shall we?” He told the supreme overlord with the duck beak. Alas, the latter didn’t react at all as if its brains didn’t work.

“It’s good that Silly Da is inactive. Otherwise, this epoch is finished.” A supreme overlord deep in space commented.

Silly Da was also known as Dark Star Lord. All of its names and titles were given to it by others; its true name was a mystery.

Rumor has it that it was born in a cosmic epoch as a star at the very beginning. The epoch moved to its rhythm and heartbeat. In fact, some believed that the powers of the epoch all originated from Da.

Apex existences appeared during the golden age of this epoch. Once a new height was reached, Da suddenly woke up.

“Da.” It let out a single sound before starting to swallow up everything around it. Apex existences and cultivators fought back, wanting to kill this world devourer. Alas, all of them were eaten. Eventually, the entire epoch became its food. The only thing that managed to stop Da was a heavenly tribulation, forcing it back to a dormant state.

It had no lineage or grand dao. Other supreme lords preferred for it to stay inactive.

Undying Lord couldn’t do anything about Da and moved onward. He appeared in front of Li Qiye and reached for his chest.

He could reap the universe with this seemingly ordinary action. Spectators let out a groan and couldn’t move an inch.

Anything performed by a supreme overlord was extraordinary. This was enough to take the true fate and the grand dao from an emperor or dao lord.

A hush fell over since everyone paid attention to this attack. They were about to see the answer - whether Li Qiye still had enough strength to fight back in spite of his heavenly injuries.
