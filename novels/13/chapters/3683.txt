Chapter 3684: Young Geniuses

“Clank!” Li Xiangquan in his empowered state summoned a long sword and immediately unsheathed the blade.

Everyone saw a bright flash subsequently. It was as if he was unsheathing a bundle of lightning bolts instead of a sword. Their arcs flowed chaotically, ready to penetrate.

His eyes became cold and imperious, making him look like an untouchable Heavenly Sovereign.

Other students from Duality couldn’t help but become overwhelmed with admiration.

“Worthy of being one of the five heroes.” Some felt proud to be in the same academy as him.

“Boom!” At the same time, a silver spear pierced the sky and resembled a galaxy filled with great momentum and battle spirit. Zhang Yunzhi looked like a god of war descending to the mortal realm, capable of fighting all the demons and devils. 

“What an impressive presence, only Senior Brother Zhang has something like this.” One student from Duality said with admiration.

Though he wasn’t riding a stallion right now, he still had the same oppressive pressure akin to that of an attacking rider. He could sweep through all the battlefields in Eight Desolaces, uncontested.

“Duality Academy has so many talents.” One expert had to praise Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan.

The two were actually already accomplished and relatively older before joining the academy due to their prestigious background. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This actually showed the charm of Duality. Only a lineage like this could recruit talents from all over the world regardless of the long distance. 

The students referred to the top peers as the five heroes of Duality. This could be construed as bombastic and arrogant. Nonetheless, these titles were widely accepted by the experts and sects in the holy ground.

This was both due to the academy’s history and the abilities of the five heroes themselves.

“Li Qiye, are you prepared?” Zhang Yunzhi looked down at Li Qiye, looking intimidating and dominating.

“This is it? How boring. I guess I need to hold back so that you two can survive to the third move.” Li Qiye casually said.

The two’s anger reignited again after hearing this.

“This brat still thinks the two aren’t powerful enough?” A spectator murmured.

“They are definitely strong enough to kill him with one move. He won’t be able to brag for much longer.” One Duality student snorted.

Some agreed with this because in their empowered state, Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan looked unbeatable.

On the other hand, Li Qiye had no aura and energy fluctuations to speak of. The guy shouldn’t be able to last one move.

They actually thought that the duo was wasting their time preparing so hard. Just one finger should be enough to crush him.

The duo exchanged glances. Li Xiangquan then threatened: “You shall have your death wish now!”

He then took out a diagram. It became larger and engulfed the area. An ancient and majestic capital emerged from the diagram.

It included officials. One was old and wore a golden robe. Others were young and handsome with qilin-engraved robes. Another civic official had a runic cloak…

All in all, these officials lined up inside the palace. They varied in appearance and age; only one thing was similar - their holy aura. This seemed to be the court of a god or an immortal.

The spectators became startled right away.

“What diagram is this?” A few became surprised.

“It’s a diagram named Hundred Officials.” An expert from Vajra elaborated: “A great treasure given to the Li by the court. It was created by one hundred mighty civic officials from Vajra, encompassing their powers.”

In Vajra, the civic officials weren’t weak scholars. In reality, the higher-ranking ones were just as powerful as elders or even ancestors from the sects.

A hundred of them worked together to create this gift for the Li? Only this clan had enough prestige and status for this great honor.

Li Xiangquan seemed to be the leader of these officials while being engulfed by this visual phenomenon. He was below one man but above all else. [1]

Zhang Yunzhi didn’t want to fall behind and took out a treasure in the shape of a steel halberd.

“Activate!” A visual phenomenon of a great cavalry arriving emerged. A million troops appeared behind him, possessing great bloodthirst and battle experience. 

He stood in front, looking like a divine commander ready to lead them to battle and conquer all enemies. Just one hand wave of his could take down a country.

“What treasure is this?” Many shuddered after feeling the ferocious aura of this treasure.

“Cavalry Halberd, a treasure Vajra used quite often back then for battles. After taking over, expeditions didn’t happen as often so they gave it to the Zhang as a reward for their contribution.” An old expert explained.

Everyone saw the stark contrast between the two geniuses. Li Xiangquan was in charge of the civic officials while Zhang Yunzhi led a great army. 

“Isn’t this the opposite?” Someone said: “They swapped roles.”

Many actually shared this thought. Li Xiangquan was from a military clan with plenty of generals. His father was the current Grand Commander.

As for Zhang Yunzhi, he came from a civic clan with deep roots in the capital. His father was the Grand Chancellor, in charge of the court’s officials.

The two successors seemed to have swapped roles. Li Xiangquan looked like a perfect official while Zhang Yunzhi had the bearing of a general.

“The son of the Grand Commander wants to work for the court and the son of the Grand Chancellor wants to be a general. How bizarre.” Another commenter expressed.

“Maybe the clans also want this.” One elder speculated with a serious expression: “The Li wants to extend their reach, the same with the Zhang.”

People couldn’t disagree with this logic. Both the clans have been sticking to their respective domain for a long time. Perhaps starting from this generation, they wanted to expand their influence.

“Li Qiye, are you ready? Otherwise, we’ll start first.” Li Xiangquan uttered coldly.

They certainly hated Li Qiye but since they were from prestigious clans, they couldn’t attack without warning in an official duel.
