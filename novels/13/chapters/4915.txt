Chapter 4916: Goldcrest Young Noble

“What demonic sorcery is this?” She took one step backward, alarmed.

“Isn’t that rather common nowadays with the rise of the demons?” A burst of hearty laughter came and interrupted their conversation.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A demon with white feathers came over, looking rather gallant. He was obviously a rooster demon.

The feathers were bright and conspicuous. At this moment, he maintained the form of a rooster yet had the bearing of a human.

Surprisingly enough, he didn’t have a hint of demonic energy, only a grand aura. When sensing the aura alone, one would mistake him for an accomplished cultivator.

He waved a paper fan playfully, looking like a scholar.

“Your Highness, what sorcery are you talking about?” He bowed toward Ming Shi before greeting Yunyun in a polite manner: “Miss Jian, long time no see. I am lost in jubilation to be in your presence once more.”

“Thank you, Brother Goldcrest.” Yunyun bowed and returned the gesture.

“What long time no see? Big Sis Yunyun only left for a little bit but you made it sound like years. Sounds like someone got a case of the lovesick.” Ming Shi teased him.

“Ming Shi.” Yunyun raised her voice.

“Your Highness, there is logic in your comment. As the saying goes, one day apart seems like three autumns. How I longed to see you again, Miss Jian.” The youth didn’t overly react and spoke calmly.

He then bowed toward Yunyun again and apologized: “I’m sorry if my one-sided crush is making you feel uncomfortable.”

He was clearly one of her suitors and didn’t try to hide it.

“Please, she has plenty, you’re not the only one. And don’t think too highly of yourself, she doesn’t keep you in mind enough to be uncomfortable.” Ming Shi didn’t hold back.

“You are right, Your Highness, I am too conceited.” The youth laughed and confidently said: “But as for her other suitors, although there is no lack of geniuses here, I humbly claim that I can defeat most of them.”

He did look rather powerful and confident.

“Stop acting cool, Rooster.” Ming Shi said: “It doesn’t matter how exceptional you are if she doesn’t like you.”

“True, it does require feelings from both sides.” This comment finally deflated him like a balloon.

“Thank you for your feelings, Brother Goldcrest, but I do not wish to be involved in romance right now.” Yunyun shook her head.

“I apologize again.” He bowed.

“All your flowery words are useless, Big Sis has a boyfriend now so you should give up.” Ming Shi interjected.

“Ming Shi, not again.” Yunyun could tell that this girl only wanted to cause trouble.

“The rumors are true?” Goldcrest instinctively stared at Li Qiye after hearing this: “My name is Goldcrest. Who may you be, friend?”

“Let me introduce him, our rooster is a great demon with innate talents. Get to know each other.” Ming Shi winked at Li Qiye.

Goldcrest Young Noble came from the ten grand mountains of Demon. He had no problem competing with the geniuses from the other lineages.

Due to his power and talent, he had enough confidence to think that he would come out as the winner of this romantic competition. His eyes became bright because he wanted to see the man chosen by Yunyun. His competitive nature took over.

Alas, he didn’t notice anything special about Li Qiye. The guy was just another cultivator.

“May I ask where you are from?” He asked, wanting to find out more.

“I’m a traveler, no affiliation.” Li Qiye smiled.

Goldcrest pondered - a man with no sect. If he wasn’t Yunyun’s boyfriend, why were they traveling together?

“Brother Goldcrest, don’t overthink this lest you say something regrettable.” Yunyun warned.

This incited Goldcrest’s curiosity. Yunyun clearly wanted to defend Li Qiye. Why was this cultivator worth her time and energy?

“Hehe, Rooster, I have you know that Young Noble Li knows sorcery.” Ming Shi said, still shocked at Li Qiye’s ability. She wanted to see more.

“Oh? In terms of strange arts and demonic abilities, I’m afraid no place in the lower continents can compare to our Demon.” He responded.

“Listen, Young Noble Li has an amazing pair of eyes. He just needs one glance to know anyone’s secrets.” She said before winking at Li Qiye: “Young Noble, am I right?”

Li Qiye only smiled, aware that she was using Goldcrest to find out more about him.

Yunyun thought about their first encounter and it seemed like Ming Shi was right. He understood everything at first glance so she herself wanted to confirm this.

“Just let the young noble take a look then, maybe make it a bet.” Ming Shi stirred trouble.

“Friend, do you really have such an ability?” Goldcrest could tell that Ming Shi was confident.

“Just make it a bet.” Ming Shi persuaded.

Goldcrest thought about it carefully before responding: “I’m just a wild demon with no secret to speak of.”

He smiled, not wanting to participate.

“Hmph, scared, I see.” Ming Shi snorted.

Goldcrest didn’t mind and cupped his fist toward Li Qiye: “Let us wait until another day to witness your amazing technique.”
