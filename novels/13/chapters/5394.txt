Chapter 5395: Who Will Stop Me?

Illumination was glad to hear Li Qiye’s neutrality and bowed in his direction: “I am rest assured after hearing confirmation from you, Sir. I am only here to take Miss Ye and have no intention of opposing you.”

He tried to use Li Qiye’s words against him, preventing the feared cultivator from interfering with the conflict between him and All-things Dao Lord. He has been attempting to get these words out of Li Qiye for a while now.

“Your little scheme is not clever, only unbecoming of a so-called apex conqueror. I do what I want and am shackled by nothing.” Li Qiye chuckled.

Although he didn’t support Illumination’s choice, he also didn’t wish to support Dao Alliance. If Illumination were foolish enough to offend him again, he would have no problem killing him. This applied to the members of Dao Alliance as well.

Thus, everyone viewed him as the blade of an executioner looming above them, always ready to chop their head off.

“I will keep that to heart, Sir.” Illumination bowed and was just glad to see Li Qiye sitting on the sideline. He had enough self-restraint to swallow his pride, something that couldn’t be said about many others with a similar status. His goal was more important than anything.

With that, he asked All-things: “Brother, I must take Miss Ye with me, will you acquiesce?”

“You are putting me in a tough position. Even if I were to agree, others will not.” All-things shook his head.

“Who will stop me then?” Illumination released his aura and caused explosions in the palace.

The indomitable fortress built by Blessed Dao Lord was quaking violently, seemingly unable to withstand his power.

Among the crowd, only All-things Dao Lord could stop him. Thus, the dao lord stepped forward and said: “A duel it is, Brother Illumination.”

“Let me witness your All-things Mantra again then.” Illumination had to take Ye Fantian with him.

“Very well.” All-things channeled his mantra and became resplendent.

From one to three and three to myriad creations. His life particles multiplied and created a boundless world with him in the center.

Instead of being an imperious lord, he served as a benevolent creator. Each thought could give birth to a new creation. The day and night changed to his whim.

“All-things World!” The group was in awe of the technique. Those from Eight Desolaces understood its prestigious history.

This was due to All-things Mantra - one of the seven grand arts from Eight Desolaces.

Normally, whenever dao lords proved their dao, they would create their own mantras and merit laws, focusing on the new ones and abandoning their previous cultivation methods.

The only ones who didn’t do this had access to the heavenly scriptures. This included Swordsea and Darkfrost Dao Lord. They had created their own dao but knew that these dao wouldn’t be superior to the heavenly scriptures.

As for All-things Dao Lord, he kept using the common mantra available to everyone. Only disciples from tiny sects would bother learning the seven mantras.

Nonetheless, he still used it as the main foundation for his cultivation - something unimaginable to those from Eight Desolaces.

The ones here were talented and had a firm dao heart. However, they still abandoned the seven mantras for their own dao.

All-things was an exception and moreover, he managed to reach the apex with it. He derived the mantra to the limit and created his own world.

“Forming a world using a basic mantra, I cannot do this.” Illumination admitted.

“Let’s begin, Brother.” All-things gestured while standing inside his world.

“Very well. If I lose, I will leave without saying another word but if I win, I will take Miss Ye.” Illumination said.

“It’s a deal.” All-things’ voice became majestic and in tune with the dao.

“Boom!” Illumination confidently entered the created world and was immediately met by torrents of power.

It only had one ruler and didn’t welcome Illumination.
