Chapter 4659: Celestial Spider God

“Will all six show up?” An expert speculated while staring in the direction of the two monarchs.

“Maybe even Dao Sanqian will come.” A big shot gazed at the horizon and took a deep breath.

“It’s possible, this gemstone might exceed even the elusive paragon weapons.” One ancestor had a serious expression: “Whoever gets it will wield a frightening power. It’s enough to tempt figures like Dao Sanqian.”

Others agreed with this comment. This was akin to the appearance of a new dao lord. However, this was much more predictable, unlike the sudden rise of the new owner of the gemstone.

All of Eight Desolaces would start changing. Would top masters such as Dao Sanqian be able to stop it? The uncertainties forced them to take action.

“Boom!” Another explosion caused the sky to turn dark and shook violently.

Everyone looked up and saw a massive figure. This was the reason why the sky turned dark.

“What in the world?” One cultivator took a deep breath.

Even an expert became afraid: “A great demon cultivator… wait, it looks wild…”

They saw a gigantic spider above. Its round stomach was as big as a thousand mountains piled on top of each other, looking like a star.

Its eight legs resembled mountain ranges with hair as sharp as spears with terrifying glimmers.

Such a ferocious spider should be a nauseating sight. However, its eyes and body spots looked like expensive diamonds. It exuded a divine aura instead of poisonous miasma. Therefore, despite its appearance, it looked rather holy.

“This is not a monster. It is one of the three saints, Celestial Spider God.” An eastern cultivator gasped.

“One of the three saints?” Most have heard of them before.

“Yes, they support Five-sun King.” The eastern expert solemnly said.

“Incredible, this event will be something else.” A big shot murmured.

This spider was one of the three strongest ancient ancestors under Five-sun King, serving as his dao protector.

It was from an ancient clan, not Five-sun School. These supporters wanted Five-sun King to become the next dao lord.

The three saints played a large part in his success in the east. This culminated in him becoming one of the five conquerors.

It came from Celestial Spider Ravine. In the distant past, this sect was rather insignificant. However, during the great calamity, something fell down the ravine and empowered the land.

Subsequently, the sect prospered and became a great power. After many more eras, their foundation and resources reached the right level for them to claim to be the strongest demon sect in the east.

Their spider god was absolutely as strong as the six heavenly monarchs of Three Thousand Dao. Thanks to this, Five-sun King became competitive.

“It looks like Five-sun King must have the gemstone as well.” A big shot from the east said: “I’m sure all five conquerors will want it.”

“This might be the key to the throne.” One ancestor commented: “This is the prelude to the actual competition. We’ll finally see all five try their best.”

Despair surfaced in everyone’s mind after seeing the spider god. Numerous invincible masters have arrived so their chance of winning was virtually zero.

They hoped that they would be the first to find the emperor, seize the gemstone, then sneak away unnoticed.

“Clank!” It didn’t take long before another large legion appeared after a loud bell, looking rather majestic.

“Lion’s Roar is here too…” A big shot saw the banners and became startled. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“They haven’t participated in any worldly matters for a long time now. Don’t tell me… even the Supreme Monarch will come?” An ancestor became emotional.

“Her Majesty is coming?” Everyone had a look of respect on their face.

Even characters of Dao Sanqian couldn’t earn the entire world’s respect. They were one level beneath the great monarch.

“Wait a minute, look at the banners in the back, that’s the emblem of the Puresun!” After a while, an eastern expert noticed something.

“The Puesun?!” The crowd couldn't believe it.

“No way, the Puresun has been reclusive for eras now, their members no longer walk the world.” Another disagreed.

“But that is indeed their emblem.” An eastern ancestor confirmed.

“None can resist the power of the gemstone.” An expert said.

“Look further back… that banner belongs to Golden City!” Someone else shouted.

“Golden City too? Another reclusive power.” A big shot from Inner Ruins said.

“Something is off. Look at the members themselves, the badges on their arm, they’re from True Immortal.”

“Right, I see banners from True Immortal too.” Another famous character said.

“Why are True Immortal using so many different banners? They certainly wouldn’t pretend to be the other sects.” This became confusing for everyone.
