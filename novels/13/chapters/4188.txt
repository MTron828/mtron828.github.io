Chapter 4189: Sword Cauldron

“Let’s go to the cauldron, we might be able to get something.” Quite a few began leaving the cemetery for Sword Cauldron.

“It’s the second grave, I’m sure whatever swords there will be amazing.” One expert said along the way.

Prior to this, the cauldron was not a popular destination due to the dangers looming there. However, the ocean had appeared and engulfed the area. This made the place even safer than Sword Grave.

Nine-sun Sword Saint felt the same urgency. He bid goodbye before leaving. However, his goal was not the cauldron but rather, the sword ray earlier.

“We’re leaving too.” Li Qiye smiled and headed for Sword Cauldron.

“I hope you don’t mind if I tag along, Young Noble.” Shi Yingxue followed Li Qiye and walked alongside Snowcloud Princess.

In terms of status, Shi Yingxue was a senior to the princess. However, she didn’t seem to mind right now.

Once they made it to the border, they saw a massive line of people waiting.

The cauldron was the fourth domain, far more sinister than the first three. There was a distinct difference as well.

Divine swords and fortunes were scattered across the first three domains. This wasn’t the case in this world filled with red.

Majestic terrains such as mountain ranges remained. However, there was no life left due to the presence of a scorching liquid.

It resembled lava or molten metal but was neither. On the surface was an ashen layer, looking a bit like rust or solidified blood with a faint stench.

Whatever this liquid was, it didn’t follow the mold. Normally, water would flow from high to low elevation. None of this applied here. The flow was chaotic and illogical. For example, water flowed from the base of a cliff to the top. Another crossed mountains and hills as if wanting to find a way out of this area. Thus, all of these different currents seemed to be alive and sentient.

Some believed that this place was used to refine thousands and thousands of divine swords, hence its name. The lava-like water was unknown metals being reduced to a liquid state. As for the layer of ash, it could have been the countless sacrifices. Their blood, flesh, and lives were used to create the divine swords.

Perhaps the dead was the reason behind the seemingly-sentient water. They tried to escape the cauldron just like lost specters.

The first-time visitors shuddered after seeing it.

“This looks like a refinement hell.” A youth said.

There was nothing dangerous in sight but just the atmosphere alone intimidated spectators. They seemed to be hearing wails coming from the red liquid, lamenting about their undeserved fate.

“Who knows.” An expert smiled wryly. They all experienced this same feeling during their first visit.

This was one of the reasons why people avoided this place. There were no divine swords available on top of the traumatic experience. Of course, the ocean made this trip different from the rest.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” Gigantic swords suddenly flew out of the red liquid. They were clear and transparent, being made from water and all with an ocean smell. They didn’t evaporate despite coming in contact with the red liquid.

“These are sword boats from Sword Ocean. This is how we get in.” A senior told his disciples.

People began boarding the boats. Some chose to be alone while others formed teams.

Due to the limited number of boats versus cultivators, pushing and fighting were inevitable.

A few weren’t careful enough and accidentally fell into the cauldron. They screamed in pain while sinking, seemingly being dragged down by invisible hands.

Normally, drowning and being trapped were impossible for cultivators given their power. This wasn’t the case here. The victims disappeared completely into the red liquid. Spectators became more careful after seeing this.

Those riding the sword boats were granted safe passage across the red liquid. Alas, the wait for the boats was quite long.

A few experts lost their patience and summoned their defensive treasures, wanting to follow the boats.

“Poof!” One of them flew in the air but was immediately taken down by an inferno appearing out of nowhere. Both he and his treasures were reduced to ashes.

Another made it farther. The moment she flew above a gorge, something flashed from below. It resembled a long tongue and coiled around her, pulling her downward. Her screams came subsequently.

One more was killed by a red beam piercing through his forehead as he attempted to fly past a mountain. He instantly died without uttering a sound; his corpse fell backward into the liquid. The source of the red beam was unknown since there was nothing on the mountain.

“I’m not going anymore, screw this!” Those who wanted to skip the boats quickly changed their mind and retreated.

“Hmph, try this when you’re a dao lord. Even the Five Overlords wouldn’t dare to be so adventurous here.” An ancestor shook his head: “This place is only second in terms of danger to Sword World. Only death awaits those who overestimate themselves!”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
