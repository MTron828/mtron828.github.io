Chapter 5777: Try Again And I’ll Kill You

Nether looked around and spotted a middle-aged man approaching.

“Immortal Emperor Fan Chen, you’re still alive?” Nether had a serious expression.

“Doing pretty well, why would I be dead if you’re still alive?” Fan Chen smiled.

Others became surprised to see him. True to his title, he had a love for the mundane world and a strong attachment to Buddhism.

He rarely appeared in public or competed with others. Only a few battles of his were recorded in history.

“I thought you died long ago.” Nether uttered coldly.

Despite Fan Chen’s low profile, some emperors understood that he was extraordinary and had chosen to stay in the mortal world.

In reality, he still ascended to the thirteen continents while keeping it a secret for unknown reasons.

He didn’t participate in the previous wars but even if he did, others wouldn’t have recognized him anyway.

Immortal Emperors speculated about his disappearance. Some believed he had passed away in the mortal world; others swore they had seen him next to Immortal Emperor Min Ren before the expedition.

Thus, these speculators were startled to see him again. He must have been hiding for a special mission.

“No reason to come out, just like you.” Fan Chen smiled.

“All this for me? It is an honor then.” Nether said.

“Not quite, but I can’t miss this opportunity. You will not be able to save Celestial Court today, I will slay you if you attempt to open the palace again.” Fan Chen said.

Unlike imperious emperors, his tone resembled a villager casually chatting.

From an achievement standpoint, Fan Chen couldn’t compare to Immortal Emperor Fei Yang and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan. This also applied to the younger generation where Demon and South Emperor’s group outshined him.

In spite of this, Nether took him seriously. He knew this Immortal Emperor didn’t wait patiently for nothing. His power was absolutely at the apex level.

Moreover, that slash earlier was the embodiment of dao simplicity.

“What have you gained after all these years?” Nether uttered coldly.

“Nothing much, but since we are fighting to the death today, there is no need to hide anything. Let me show you something.” Fan Chen took out a rusty iron sword - one that could be found everywhere in the mortal world and couldn’t be traded for two or three silver coins.

“Reversion.” Nether’s eyes gleamed brightly after seeing it.

“Reversion? Immortal Emperor Min Ren’s weapon!” Some shouted upon hearing this.

The blade was another of the five immortal armaments and belonged to Immortal Emperor Min Ren.

The list included Reversion Blade, Primeval Cauldron, Azure Omniplate, Moon Embrace, and Human-monarch Seal. [1]

Primeval Cauldron belonged to Flame Emperor and was passed down to Crimson Emperor. It disappeared after the latter’s death.

Azure Omniplate was the first treasure to be made public by its master, Purewood Divine Emperor. Only a few had the privilege of seeing it until now due to Immortal Emperor Ren Xian. It seemed that Purewood Divine Emperor didn’t take it with him to Immortal Dao City.

Human-monarch Seal was kept by Six-dao Monarch until his death due to a heavenly tribulation. Immortal Monarch Yi Ye became the next master, another cultivator who had entered Immortal Dao City.

The most popular one was Moon Embrace since World Emperor used it in his conquest, starting from his era to the valiant resistance against Celestial Court. Whenever the immortal armaments were brought up, Moon Embrace and World Emperor were the first to come to mind.

On the contrary, Reversion rarely made an appearance. Rumor has it that it initially belonged to Celestial Court and somehow fell into Immortal Emperor Min Ren’s possession later.

One source stated that the dark crow and many emperors from the nine worlds had ambushed Celestial Court, killing numerous members and seizing Reversion. This was in preparation for Immortal Emperor Min Ren’s future expedition.

With the blade missing onward, everyone thought that the emperor had taken it with him. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Very little is known about this weapon. If emperors and monarchs were to see it without any context, they wouldn’t recognize the blade.

“Reversion shall return to us today.” Nether said, confirming one speculation but not the rest regarding their failure against the dark crow.

“I’m afraid that won’t happen. The blade was in your possession once, right? It won’t accept you any longer.” Fan Chen responded.

“I just need to kill you first.” Nether’s eyes flashed murderously.

Celestial Court didn’t bother searching for the blade since they also erroneously thought it was taken on the expedition.

“Come, but if you only have imperial weapons, it’ll be an easy victory for me.” Fan Chen said.

“Then witness my treasure!” Nether shouted and a disk manifested into reality.

Concealing ace cards was unnecessary in this life-and-death struggle. The enemies were sieging their gate so he had to go all out.
