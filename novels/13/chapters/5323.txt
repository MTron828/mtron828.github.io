Chapter 5324: Who Might You Be?

An eternity was but a blink of an eye for the incoming sword technique. It encompassed simplicity, lacking the area of effect capable of suppressing the heavens and destroying three thousand worlds.

The only focus was to kill no matter who it is, capable of passing through countless domains and even the river of time itself. Even if the world was no longer around, it would continue to travel through the primordial chaos.

Li Zhitian and the old servant couldn’t help but admire the beautiful attack.

Blood splashed as her sword cut Coldflame Conquerors’ body and continue for the dao fruits.

Although the dao fruits were virtually indestructible and could always recover as long as there was a single strand left, this attack would also never stop. There was no doubt that he would die in due time.

“You’ve lost, Fellow Daoist.” However, she pulled back and said calmly, revealing a pleasant voice containing the rhythm of the dao. Listeners could never get tired of it.

She only looked around twenty years of age yet she was the renowned Sword Queen.

“Well done, you’ve seized the initiative with that decisive move.” Coldflame Conqueror had no choice but to give up: “I am a man of my word and will not renege.”

“I appreciate it.” She converged her energy back into her body.

With that gone, everyone found her to be amicable, no longer the guardian and leader of Imperial Alliance.

The two were evenly matched but Li Qiye’s comments pointed out Coldflame’s weakness and how to break it.

Because Coldflame was temporarily distracted by the revelation, this gave Sword Queen enough time to pull off a decisive attack.

“Thank you for your guidance, Sir.” Sword Queen lowered her head in gratitude.

As for Coldflame, he glanced at the old servant before shifting his gaze back to Li Qiye.

“Who might you be, Young Noble?” He respectfully asked, treating Li Qiye as a serious foe.

“Just a passerby.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Dao Brother, can you enlighten me on this?” Coldflame asked the old servant, clearly recognizing him.

“He’s the young noble, I don’t know anything else.” The old servant shook his head.

Coldflame couldn’t force them to answer since that would be rude. In reality, he was trying to calm down - how could this man know so much about the maddened flame?

He believed that he was the absolute authority regarding this dao since he had the highest achievement possible.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This had nothing to do with pride but rather, no one had reached his level. Maddened Conqueror was powerful and also reached the limit. Alas, he fell to his own insanity.

Maddened, the creator, was rumored to be dead as well. This left Coldflame Conqueror as the greatest practitioner of this dao. Alas, this unknown man seemed to know about its mysteries as well.

“Have you done research on the maddened flame, Young Noble?” Coldflame was aware that the smartest move was to walk away due to his current injuries.

He gained nothing from lingering around but curiosity got the best of him. After all, he wanted nothing more than to learn more about his own dao.

“Just a bit, it came from the nine heavenly scriptures.” Li Qiye smiled.

A glint flashed in Coldflame’s eyes. He definitely didn’t want to leave now.

“You’ve seen it before, One Heart?” Coldflame couldn’t help but ask.

All of the maddened flame cultivators have never seen the origination scripture. In fact, Maddened himself probably didn’t see the real version.

According to the tales, Maddened activated his dao due to his strong emotions. Coldflame knew that there was more than this.

After spending his whole life perfecting this dao, he was certain that Maddened must have interacted with One Heart one way or another. Perhaps Maddened himself didn’t recognize this and never brought it up again.

This was Coldflame’s biggest regret in life - his inability to find One Heart. He had searched for the real version but this was a futile endeavor.

Now, he wondered if Li Qiye had seen One Heart or at least a manifestation of it.

“I’ve read too many so I don’t remember if I’ve read a particular one or not.” Li Qiye answered with a smile.

“Young Noble, you must have read about the mysteries of the maddened flame since you know it so well.” Coldflame said.

“You wish to truly solve the madness, not just suppressing it forcefully.” Li Qiye casually remarked.
