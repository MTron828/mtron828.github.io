Chapter 3552: Buddha Bowing

As days went by, the girl knew the chants by heart, enough to recite it backward. Nonetheless, she still meticulously analyzed each word while incorporating it into her movement.

Though the attempts were identical, each gave her a unique feeling. This meant that she had incremental improvements in a gradual manner.

She cherished the opportunity so she was the first to wake up and the last one to sleep. Though Li Qiye didn’t teach her anything new, not an ounce of grievance could be found in her. Her entire mind and soul were hellbent on learning this lesson.

The old man frequently watched her training. This was quite beneficial for her too because her talents and knowledge were far inferior in comparison. He gave her indirect guidance or answered a few questions.

He knew full well that there were no standards nor rules for this type of cultivation. If he were to instill his own comprehension and knowledge into her, that would actually slow her down. Thus, he minimized his involvement as much as possible.

Nonetheless, he resembled a teacher more than Li Qiye. The latter virtually ignored the girl after the first session. He had only checked on her once or twice during his leisure hours then corrected certain things.

Other cultivators would find this teaching method ridiculous. The old man found this surprising but didn’t ask too much.

After all, Li Qiye had higher cultivation attainments. If he were to teach the girl anything, that would be akin to displaying his slight skills before an expert.

One day, Li Qiye saw this and didn’t stop it. He approvingly nodded instead: “Correct, you’re a passable teacher.”

“I have a question too, the girl isn’t limited to techniques and variations.” The old man smiled wryly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“That’s why her height will be greater than yours in the future.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “A few people just need one move in their entire life to be invincible. There’s no need to worry about techniques. Just worry about the essences of the dao along with a tough dao heart.”

The old man accepted this criticism since it came from Li Qiye. He carefully digested the meanings behind them.

“You, how many invincible techniques do you have?” Li Qiye looked at the old man and spread his palm.

“Thank you for your guidance, Young Master.” The old man took a deep breath and said.

He had learned plenty of merit laws and imperial techniques. However, only a few moves served as the foundation of his domination.

“You won’t be able to catch up to her with regard to this particular move.” Li Qiye smiled.

“May I ask for its name?” The old man became curious. Due to his erudite knowledge, he could recognize merit laws’ origin and source after seeing them for the first time.

This wasn’t the case for this particular move. He had no idea where it came from.

“Buddha Bowing. I crafted it specifically for her. As long as her dao heart is firm enough, she’ll reach the next height.”

“Buddha Bowing...” The old man was shaken by both the name of the technique along with Li Qiye’s action.

How could the guy create a move suitable for the girl in just one night? He definitely couldn’t do so.

He stopped speaking and stood to the side.

“Go fetch a few things here.” Li Qiye took out and handed a list to the old man.

The old man took a look and saw precious and rare materials. Of course, it wasn’t for someone like him to obtain them.

“Young Master, is this to change the girl’s fate?” The old man became startled.

“She has to do that herself. How can a tree grow and blot out the sky without experiencing enough storm and rain? I am simply laying a foundation for her.” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man agreed and bowed, leaving to carry out his task. He only needed several days to gather them despite their rarity.

Li Qiye immediately got started with preparing a supreme formation. He easily sealed space along with the other affinities - reincarnation cycle, yin and yang, karma...

The old man was in awe while watching this. The guy did it with such mastery while needing zero effort.

Li Qiye also had a cauldron with boiling medicinal water inside. It had a strange aroma.

He glanced at the girl and asked: “This will be awfully painful. Can you handle it?”

“I can.” The girl didn’t know what Li Qiye wanted to do but she had full trust in him.

“Good.” He immediately tossed her into the boiling cauldron.

She was startled while flying through the air. However, next came the heat trying to boil her.

“Focus, recite the chants!” She heard Li Qiye’s voice deep in her mind. She immediately recited the chants in order to stop the scorching water.

“Accept rather than reject, let the medicinal water seep into your body!” Li Qiye roared again.

She followed his instruction and the scalding heat came along. This pain was unbearable, causing her to scream. She gritted her teeth to stop.

In this split second, Li Qiye grasped the stars and turned their lights into needles, throwing them towards the girl afterward.

They struck her important meridians, turning her into a hedgehog. Unfortunately, the pain of the starry needles piercing was ten times worse than the scalding water. She screamed once before trying her best to stop.

Next, Li Qiye used the five elements, karma, and the yin and yang to press down on her, seemingly wanting to crush her apart.

She bellowed in pain but still gritted her teeth and persevered. The old man was happy for her.

After all, how many people in this world had the honor of having Li Qiye personally changing their fate?

This wasn’t a direct change but it would lay a boundless foundation for her. The future was limitless depending on her dao heart. The pain might be unbearable but surpassing this meant a lifetime of benefits.

With Li Qiye’s continuous refinements, the medicinal liquid in the cauldron gradually disappeared. On the other hand, a murderous energy manifested within the girl, becoming denser.

The refinement technique from Li Qiye was marvelous and effortless. Profundity just came naturally.

The old man became more and more impressed. He had seen top alchemists at work before, the best of the generation.

Unfortunately, they looked like new students compared to Li Qiye, as coarse as can be.

“This is fine.” Li Qiye eventually recalled his technique after finishing.

Meanwhile, the girl was still sitting in the cauldron in a state of zen. She had never felt this comfortable before, akin to her shackles being broken. She felt as if she could go anywhere now.

Suddenly, black clouds engulfed the sky along with thunder. A heavenly tribulation seemed to be descending.

The old man had a serious expression, realizing the significance behind this. Li Qiye, on the other hand, only glanced at it.

Ultimately, the tribulation didn’t come down.
