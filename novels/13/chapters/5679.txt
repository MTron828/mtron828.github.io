Chapter 5680: A Kind Proposal

“Misunderstood? If you were so kind, you wouldn’t have dug that pit for everyone. Hmph, we all could have fought together.” The being said.

“If everyone was willing to be on the same side, they wouldn’t have viewed it as a pit, only a kind proposal.” Li Qiye waved dismissively.

“A kind proposal?” The being sneered: “Taking down the three giants of Crimsonheaven and seizing their territories and fortress. I’m sure you coveted that land from the very start.”

“No way.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I came without any knowledge of that region and plus, I had no power and forces to speak of, how could I possibly have taken them down? This was due to internal conflict. Sigh, is that what people think? My poor reputation up in Heavenrealm.”

“Internal conflict, haha? Those three giants have been on good terms for countless years and fought numerous battles together. Others tried to instigate in the past, only to find that their bond was unbreakable.” The being said.

“Well, nothing lasts forever in this world.” Li Qiye said: “Think about it, how mighty and imposing you used to be, a true force to be reckoned with. You had lofty aspirations too, even if you couldn’t conquer the high heaven, you still could decide the fate of countless eras. Alas, your light is replaced by the darkness that you used to despise.”

“Hmph.” This was a sensitive issue so the being let out a furious scowl capable of crushing stars.

“Don’t be angry, I am just stating facts, especially about how glorious you once were.” Li Qiye smiled. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“The past is not worth mentioning, I am still walking on the same path, albeit with a different choice.” The being said.

“Now that is incorrect.” Li Qiye shook his head: “The path disappeared the moment you became part of the darkness. Your dao heart was shaken and there is no way to return to the path. It is the wrong side, and the reason why the villainous heaven has the shadow beneath his feet.”

Li Qiye stared at the dark power and said: “The moment you made that decision, deep down, you knew that all of this was just self-consolation. In the end, no matter how powerful you become, you’re still living a borrowed life under the shadow, you will never be able to reach the villainous heaven. The old geezers are still toiling and hopeful, but can they amount to anything?”

“Not necessarily, as long as the heaven is changed.” The being said.

“That’s just wishful thinking.” Li Qiye shot it down: “When you lose the path, you lose the destination forever. No matter how convoluted the next journey and how you wish for the new paths to reach that point again, it’s gone.”

“I will change the destination then.” The being said.

“That’s even more difficult. You couldn’t reach the villainous heaven’s height and that’s one destination. How much greater do you have to be greater than him to change it? Is your epoch still around to support you? No, then how can you overcome it?” Li Qiye disagreed.

“That’s your opinion.” The being said: “Having an epoch is not enough to support the high heaven and Terminus. You’re not that much more powerful with it.”

“Only chaos remains in the absence of a mortal world, so there will be nothing supporting Terminus. There needs to be a starting point for an ending point to exist, which is why the destruction of an epoch births another. What is the reason for all of this?” Li Qiye said.

“Then we shall create another.” The being said.

“There is no world in your heart, so where will a new one come from? This originates from love and emotions which you all have none of. Knowing the mortal world yet still cherishing it is a requirement.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“That’s your speculation.” The being said coldly.

“Refute all you want but deep down, you know it is the truth. Its absence makes you no longer worthy. Lifespan and power matter not since a wolf, ultimately, is still a wolf, unable to become a sheepdog, let alone a shepherd.” Li Qiye said.

“A shepherd is just someone who wants to eat sheep.” The being said.

“That’s a different topic, the point is that a wolf is not qualified to discuss what kind of shepherd they will become, it is futile.” Li Qiye said.

“Hmph.” The being snorted but fell into contemplation.

“You might think you’re having a grand time in this darkness but you don’t know that you have permanently lost your qualification. Your arrogance and pride are worth nothing now just like those old geezers. They claim to be the eternal rulers, destined for supremacy just like the villainous heaven. How ridiculous, they are mere clowns standing outside the palace, they will never be its lord.” Li Qiye continued.

“Again, this is your personal belief.” The being said: “Light and darkness are mere perceptions. When you stand at Terminus, if you perceive darkness as light, then it is light.”

“Hahaha.” Li Qiye burst into laughter and said: “You’re deceiving yourself now. There may not be a definition at Terminus for light but darkness’ definition is eternal. Your heart cannot illuminate, so you can’t decide whether something is light.”

“Wait and see, that day will come sooner or later.” The being said.

“How confident.” Li Qiye said: “How badly did you fail to undergo such a transformation? Did you think that eliminating the high heaven was hopeless so you turned around?”

“There is a pioneer for this path, if the previous doesn’t work, it is time to change.” The being said.

“That’s an interesting way to think about this. Fine, keep on surviving then, let’s see if you can outlast the old geezers.” Li Qiye said.

“Why do you think you are superior? What have you accomplished beyond our own?” The being said.

“I plan and act, never to be swayed by temptation, never waver in the face of difficulties, and certainly won’t retreat because the path seems impassable. I choose to sweep away the obstacles instead. We are different.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Please.” The being disagreed.

“There’s nothing I can do to convince you.” Li Qiye said: “Why do you think Crimsonheaven and the others crumbled?”

This interested the being, prompting him to ask: “How did you do it?”

“Do what?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Crimsonheaven was impregnable, the same for their bond. Alliances have tried before to no avail. Why were you the exception?” The being asked.
