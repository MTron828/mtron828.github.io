Chapter 5489: Charming

Those near the battlefield were subjected to an instinctive hatred. Perhaps that hatred always existed in the heart and mind, albeit hidden and controlled.

It would resurface one day, whether it be towards a person or thing. Eventually, this hatred could escalate and act as a flood breaking the dam, fully forcing someone into a blind rage.

Just looking at this place alone invoked this uncontrollable feeling, robbing someone of their sanity and control over their own body. This caused an intense feeling of nausea, hence everyone wanting to stay away.

The powerful dao heart of top cultivators couldn’t prevent this phenomenon for long enough. Their absolute control over their emotions was utterly nullified under these circumstances.

“Young Master, I can’t stay here a second longer.” Niu Fen’s nausea and hatred gradually intensified as he drew closer.

Of course, he could still last longer but what was the point? This was discomforting and meaningless.

“You’ve grown complacent.” Li Qiye smiled.

“This is akin to picking up a pile of manure and bringing it closer to my mouth, I can’t do it. Aren’t you sensing it too?” Niu Fen said bitterly.

“Wait here then, I don’t want to see your sorry state anyway.” Li Qiye said.

“Hehehe, you’re the best.” He bowed his head and was happy to be spared from this torture.

Li Qiye chuckled and kicked the guy flying before moving ahead alone to the basin. He saw nothing along the way; lifeforms simply didn’t want to be here, preferring not to be born at all.

Due to the ever-present repulsive aura, no one had managed to pick up the emperor’s corpse to give him a proper burial. Li Qiye was one of the few exceptions managing to get this close.

However, he saw a second exception standing on a mound before the basin. In fact, his brows furrowed after seeing her due to her unmatched appearance. This could temporarily cause others to forget about the unpleasant aura.

She was dressed in black with a thin veil. The loose attire didn’t do a great job of hiding her figure and only caused minds to wander with fantasies.

What truly made the heart race was her alluring aura, capable of ensnaring souls. One would become her prisoner after a split second of staring at her.

She only needed to stand there to grasp the senses. Spectators would be driven mad with thoughts of wanting to embrace her as tight as possible, going as far as wanting to fuse into one being with her.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She stirred up one’s primal desires and needs without needing to lift a finger. If she were to smile, that would deliver a fatal blow to anyone’s sanity and overwhelm the repulsive aura.

Nonetheless, the repulsive aura also diminished her allure to an extent. If others were to come here, they might not be driven crazy right away while being affected by two contrasting affinities.

“We’ve finally met, Sir.” She bowed in Li Qiye’s direction and said softly.

Her grateful bow could have been deadly, the same for her soft voice capable of turning bones into jelly.

“I didn’t expect to see you waiting here.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“It is because I didn’t wish to insult you with my aura so this place was the perfect choice.” The woman said.

“A perfect masterpiece indeed.” Li Qiye meticulously examined the woman’s appearance. Her dress and veil did little to shield her from his eyes.

Eventually, he sighed and said: “Born of nature and self-molded, Lord of Derivation couldn’t have done this.”
