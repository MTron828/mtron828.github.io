“Brother Qingtian, your tenacity is commendable.” Ye Fantian couldn’t help but praise. She thought highly of his courageous display.

“I am overjoyed to hear that.” He burst into laughter and didn’t try to hide his crush despite being in the spotlight.

“Young Noble Li, are you going too?” He then turned toward Li Qiye and asked.

This wasn’t only provocation out of jealousy; he also wanted to see Li Qiye’s ability.

“Mmm, sure.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Young Noble, do you think you can get through all eighteen?” Ye Fantian asked.

Everyone else had the same question on their mind.

“Can he actually do it?” Someone asked quietly.

“I think so, that’s why she asked that question.” A big shot said.

Alas, no matter how they looked at it, Li Qiye just appeared so ordinary. If he could cross the eighteen images, it would be utterly embarrassing for Xiao Qingtian and all the other dragon lords.

This would be nothing short of a miracle but given his power servants, maybe there was something more to him.

“The number of images passed doesn’t matter.” Li Qiye said: “It’s just that not all of them are up to expectation, it is best to remove the insignificant ones to better benefit future generations.”

“Uhh…” Everyone stared at him in astonishment, feeling that he was being ludicrous.

“Did he really just say that?” One commenter said.

They held back from criticizing him with unsavory words due to his unstoppable servant.

The eighteen images were created by the two founders. It could be said that no one else has gone as far as them on this path, not even the supreme existences would talk about improving these legacies.

This included those on the imperial path as well. Even if they were stronger, their cultivation was different.

Xiao Qingtian was left speechless; Ye Fantian didn’t know what to say either.

The former had proved his talent by obtaining twelve sacred fruits at such a young age. However, he didn’t dare to talk about surpassing the two founders or criticize their legacies.

As for Li Qiye, his tone was so nonchalant as if it wasn’t a big deal.

“You can really finish the eighteen images?” Xiao Qingtian remained skeptical. Just finishing the path was miraculous enough, let alone improving the images.

“You would be the second, Young Noble.” Ye Fantian said, changing the topic to something less provocative.

“Someone had done it before?” A crowd member asked.

“Was it Supreme?” Another thought of the most likely candidate.

“No, Supreme only took a look and hasn’t attempted.” Xiao Qingtian responded: “There is only one known case of success, Duality Master.”

“Just a mortal I am, just one thought to become cloud and mud. That Duality Master?” A big shot had heard of this historical figure before.

This title was relatively unfamiliar to most, unlike the renowned conquerors and dao lords who had countless feats in battle.

“Yes, he who dares go anywhere and befriends anyone.” Older characters have heard legends about him before.

He was eccentric and didn’t actually cultivate the dao. He traveled everywhere and drank with everyone, whether it be a mortal merchant or an invincible conqueror.

Li Qiye chuckled after hearing this but didn’t say anything before heading for the first image.

The crowd became attentive, not wanting to miss a single detail.

“Just finishing the path is wondrous enough, let alone changing the images.” One big shot whispered.

Xiao Qingtian and Ye Fantian’s eyes opened wide, wondering if Li Qiye could actually carry out his claim. Both thought that changing the images was impossible.

“He’s in the first one.” The crowd watched with bated breath.

“Second, third, fourth…” What happened next astounded them. The rate of his traveling through the image was the same as his pace.

“The tenth image!” Someone finally shouted.

The first ten steps were identical; he wasn’t slowing down at all.

“The thirteenth!” Another screamed in disbelief because he was still walking leisurely.

They saw Xiao Qingtian earlier whose spine was being bent by the sheer pressure. This simply didn’t make any sense.

“How is he doing this…?” Even the big shots couldn’t stay calm.
