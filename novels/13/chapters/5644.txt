Chapter 5645: Innumerable Army

Sindragon and Thousand-hand had no words for Li Qiye’s might. The mighty monster was utterly dominated by a single move from Li Qiye, unable to escape.

Li Qiye formed a seal and the primordial light pinning the monster down pulsed outward. They seemed to be sentient as they spread apart and began striking the individual sacs.

The penetration revealed black figures within. They seemed to be newborns with tentacles and horns.

Unfortunately, they could not grow since the primordial rays started burning them. The entire monster became trapped in a light cage while everything inside suffered a purification process.

“Ahh!” It had no chance of resisting and could only wail in both agony and rage. Eventually, it roared thunderously, seemingly summoning something.

“Splash!” A horrifying scene unfolded within the ocean of blood found in Lightning Realm. Bloody creatures emerged out of the liquid. The majority had a humanoid form with horns and tentacles.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Eventually, all the liquid condensed into this form, resulting in an incalculable number of monsters. With them gone, the water suddenly became clear and no longer had the stench of blood. 

They answered the summoning call from the colossal monster and grew wings, flying toward the hole.

The sky became filled with them - truly a nightmarish spectacle. The sheer number made it look like blood waterfalls surging back into the air.

“Get down!” Sindragon became alarmed and shouted.

“Rumble!” He and Thousand-hand immediately took action.

Sindragon spewed boundless draconic energy from his mouth, reducing a large horde down into blood.

Thousand-hand, true to her title, summoned energy hands to deal with the flying creatures, resulting in a rain of blood.

However, the creatures couldn’t die and came back together again, still heading for the hole.

The two didn’t appreciate their tenacity. Even reducing them down to a bloody mist was not enough.

They needed a method to obliterate the creatures down into nothingness. However, this would drain them of their energy and vitality. The two exchanged glances, thinking about the best way to deal with this situation.

“Let them come.” Li Qiye’s voice came from the other dimension.

The two followed his order without any hesitation.

“Whoosh!” Just like that, the massive horde flew through the hole and headed for Li Qiye, able to pinpoint the location of the colossal monster and bypass the distance.

Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye and simply stood there, allowing them to fully surround him. Waves of waves stacked on top of each other, almost resembling a star.

Suddenly, sizzling noises could be heard as they started melting into blood.

Sindragon and Thousand-hand exchanged glances, feeling nauseous by the scene. Of course, they weren’t worried for Li Qiye in the slightest.

“Boom!” The blood star surrounding Li Qiye erupted and primordial beams surged outward, reducing the blood creatures to ashes.

After a full sweep of the area, they combined and directly struck the weakened colossal monsters.
