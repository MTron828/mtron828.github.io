Chapter 4887: Wild Dynasty

The sudden quakes frightened everyone. This was due to a floating mountain range coming closer. Numerous buildings were built on top.

This mountain range was its own independent realm with clouds and fog. Its speed was the most shocking thing in spite of its size.

Once it got close enough, people could see that it was carried by a crawling eight-legged mountain demon. It traveled a thousand miles every second and caused the land to tremble. This was a rare type of demon so to see it today was a magnificent scene.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Gongs could be heard on the peaks on the demon’s back.

“Wild Dynasty!” The crowd became emotional after seeing this.

This kingdom was a gathering of villains in Chaos. It never enforced any rules and thrived in violence and destruction as well.

If it wasn’t for Eight-stallion Dao Lord and his dynasty, Chaos would have been engulfed in perpetual war.

“They’re finally here.” Everyone shuddered after seeing the mountain.

Wild Dynasty’s strength was known by all at this point. However, it couldn’t do anything when the dao lord was still around. Now, the worst has occurred for Eight-stallion. This coronation might be the end of their dynasty.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The villains became nervous as well. They wanted to have a piece of the pie if Eight-stallion were to go down. However, there was a real chance of Wild Dynasty taking them down as well.

The horns of Eight-stallion immediately sounded as a result. The power of a dao lord billowed in the air along with special runes, forming an inviolable formation.

“Boom!” Armored cavalries appeared and situated themselves in the arrays, becoming one with the formation. Refined jades also emerged to empower the dao lord runes. Eight trigram lines appeared in this unbreakable formation.

“Soaring Stallions Legion and their Azure formation!” A guest shouted.

This was the strongest legion in Eight-stallion. They were no strangers to fighting Wild Dynasty and had won numerous times before.

Azure was created by the dao lord himself, possessing both offensive and defensive capabilities. The area of effect was massive.

They had no choice but to activate the formation right now to deal with Wild Dynasty.

“It’s a shame that I couldn’t see the dao lord off on his journey.” An ancient voice with a special rhythm sounded.

Alas, this rhythm was anything but pleasant. Most became frozen while some even vomited blood.

“Wild Dragon!” The fiercest villains became serious after hearing this voice.

He was ranked first among the Ten Monsters. Just his voice alone was intimidating enough.

He had six sacred fruits - allowing him to stand tall in the lower continents. Currently, only one dragon lord was stronger than him - Stone Ox with seven sacred fruits.

However, Wild Dragon was more than just his cultivation. He came from Ten Mountains of Demon and used to be a lava earthdragon.

He eventually earned the serpent deity spot in this region, one of the six in this dao. Normally, the six demon deities couldn’t leave Ten Mountains after gaining their power.

One exception was the peerless Demon Conqueror. For some unknown reason, Wild Dragon was able to leave Ten Mountains.

When he lost previously to the dao lord, all he needed to do was run back to Ten Mountains. Eight-stallion couldn’t do anything then.

“Wild Dragon!” Venerable Dragon God stepped forward; his eyes became as bright as two torches.

“Dragon God, I’ve been waiting a long time for this day.” Wild Dragon answered.

“You will not run rampant in my presence.” The dragon god’s battle intent surged.

As long as he was around, so would the dynasty. This raised everyone’s morale and impressed the guests and villains.

In reality, many of the victories over Wild Dynasty were led by him, not the dao lord personally.

“Then I shall walk over your corpse.” Wild Dragon domineeringly said: “Your death and the destruction of Eight-stallion shall start the change in Chaos.”

“Bring it.” The dragon god didn’t relent.

“Good!” Wild Dragon didn’t show up but a portal appeared over the mountain and out came a black flood.

“Rumble!” This turned out to be a great legion.

“Condor Legion!” The crowd became afraid. This was a force that could devour everything above ground.

It had ravaged Chaos before and only lost to Eight-stallion Dynasty.
