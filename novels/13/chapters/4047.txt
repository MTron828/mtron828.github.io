Chapter 4048: Strange Occurrences

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The peak remained in Armament Mountain for generations. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it served as a foundation for Armament.

Historians went as far as stating that the prosperity of Armament was predicated on its possession of this peak. Thus, it was more important than anything.

“I’m afraid I can’t agree to your request. Most importantly, neither I nor anyone else in Armament can make this decision.” She shook her head.

Armament could not use this peak as a transaction regardless of the circumstances. Even their second dao lord, God Ape Dao Lord, lacked the authority.

To do so was the same as betraying the sect or disrespecting the progenitor, punishable by death.

“Then there's nothing I can do. Your mountain doesn’t have anything else that interests me.” He smiled. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She didn’t know how to respond despite planning meticulously before meeting him. The issue for her was that Li Qiye was special.

Their sect could deal with anyone else’s demand but his wealth was on another level. They were nothing more than a destitute group compared to him. Persuasion became difficult and she couldn’t come up with another treasure or condition to tempt him.

“Young Noble, why not let the sect master talk about the situation there first?” Xu Yiyun decided to help out.

“Since Yiyun is helping you out, go for it.” He smiled.

“Something strange is happening, it’s like we’re haunted.” Yingxue took a deep breath and said.

“Haunted?” Yiyun didn’t expect to hear this at all.

Others would find this hilarious because cultivators went against the laws of nature. Ghosts in the mortal sense simply didn’t exist. At the very best, they were mere spirits with grudges or obsessions.

This belief was especially true for the more powerful cultivators. They weren’t intimidated in the slightest.

In this case, one of the Six Kings was having this type of problem?

Normally, cemeteries or the wilderness would be the perfect places for ghost stories. On the other hand, Armament Mountain was filled with powerful disciples, not to mention their ancestors. Ghosts must be tired of “living” for causing trouble there.

Alas, Shi Yingxue had no reason to lie to them.

“It’s true.” Yingxue smiled wryly: “It’s only happening recently. We have people disappearing every night…”

“Hmm, could it be an enemy? Killing then destroying the corpses…” Yiyun suggested but then again, she herself found this implausible.

Armament Mountain had impressive defensive lines and barriers. If someone could sneak there and kill the disciples without being spotted, they would be powerful enough to not need to do so in the first place.

“No.” Yingxue elaborated: “Those who disappeared would come back on the next day. Even ancestors have experienced this. No one has died yet.”

“How bizarre.” Yiyun remarked.

“Yes, they said that they instantly lost all senses and woke up completely naked in the morning.” Yingxue smiled wryly.

“Hmm, they got robbed?” This was Yiyun’s first thought after hearing about their condition. Alas, this didn’t make any sense either. Once again, someone strong enough to do this in Armament could do so in the open instead. They would look down on such an act.

“I’m not sure.” Yingxue pondered for a bit before adding: “One of our ancestors experienced this as well. Before losing his senses, he said it felt as if something swallowed him. He couldn’t resist at all before losing consciousness.”

“A monster then?” Yiyun said but this felt more like a ghost encounter rather than a monster encounter.

“No one ever saw the ambusher’s appearance.” Yingxue shook her head.

This problem was kept a secret but the entire mountain clamored over it. They searched the entire sect but didn’t find a single clue. Ancestors calculated the various possibilities to no avail.

In fact, they heightened their defensive barriers to the peak level. Disciples and elders patrolled the boundary but it kept on happening.

This creeped everyone out. Even in the case of a powerful enemy, they would be able to see and know them. This would be less frightening than facing the unknown.

Thus, they could only consider the place as being haunted - something ridiculous in the cultivation world. This was the reason why Yingxue had to ask Li Qiye for help.

“Is it a mischievous game? Doesn’t quite seem like it.” Yiyun wondered.

“Who would be doing it then?” Yingxue smiled wryly.

No one has been hurt yet so the ancestors had thought about this possibility. However, which top master in Sword Continent would have the time to play around with them?

“What do you think, Young Noble?” Yiyun asked Li Qiye.
