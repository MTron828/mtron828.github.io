Chapter 4411: Five-sun King’s Divinity

Five-sun King’s lightning eyes made others tremble. He seemed to be the lord of the myriad dao and all living beings.

His aura was ancient and majestic. One could sense a noble bloodline right away. Thus, the birds and beasts in the region had to come and greet him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The celestial eagle bloodline.” Many were threatened by his aura and his bloodline, especially the demon cultivators. Their own bloodline trembled helplessly, forcing them down on their knees.

Prior to this, the evolution of Jian Qingzhu’s bloodline had threatened the demons here. However, the pressure emanating from Five-sun King was far more powerful due to his cultivation.

Celestial eagles were divine beasts as well. Thus, no need to elaborate any further on their divine bloodline.

He stood there with a glow consisting of five layers, each a different color. From a distance, it felt as if there were five firmaments that he was responsible for upholding.

“Five-sun King!” Many bowed out of either respect or fear. They then looked up and saw just how magnificent he was.

“Can’t ask for more out of a son.” A last-gen expert became sentimental.

“None can match him.” One youth said with the utmost admiration.

Top geniuses were always prideful. Alas, those in the audience had no choice but to lower their head in this case.

One ancestor gave him a thumbs-up and said: “Worthy of a being respected by all of Eastern Desolace. This is the making of a dao lord who will make the continent prosperous.”

Most members of the audience believed that he was rather likely of becoming the next dao lord. It would be an honor to witness one’s maturity process.

He then gazed at the crowd. As his eyes swept back and forth, they felt their soul nearly leaving their body and became immobilized.

“I apologize for making everyone wait so long.” His words were the opposite of his divinity.

Others found it rather pleasing because after all, hearing a supreme being acting polite was not a bad experience in the slightest.

“You’re being too polite, Virtuous Nephew. Everyone is eagerly anticipating your lecture, waiting a bit is no problem.” Peacock Monarch laughed since he wasn’t petty.

Five-sun King then turned towards Jian Qingzhu and said: “Congratulations on your peerless bloodline, Saintess.”

The crowd turned towards Jian Qingzhu. Most have found out about her bloodline by now.

Some were surprised to see her participating in the lecture instead of being punished by Dragon.

“Phoenix and celestial eagle.” A spectator murmured.

“Yeah, both have a divine bloodline.” Another said softly.

Everyone could tell that this was a rare moment - two cultivators with divine bloodline standing in the same place. Though they didn’t know about the pureness of the bloodline, the two were still heaven’s favorites.

“Imagine an offspring between them.” One expert had this bold thought.

Though he kept his voice low, those nearby still heard him and exchanged glances.

One was the lord of the east, another was the saintess of Dragon. Now when taking their bloodline into account, wouldn’t they be a perfect match?

Even the big shots from the east and ancestors from Dragon caught wind of this conversation.

However, someone from the east muttered: “But there is already a candidate for the queen position, she has to be a concubine.”

The demons and members of Dragon glared at the speaker. How could their prestigious saintess be someone else’s concubine? Dragon would never accept this.

Jian Qingzhu looked at him and calmly said: “Thank you, Your Majesty. Alas, I’ve only obtained the very bare surface, it’s not worth mentioning.”

Five-sun King nodded slightly and didn’t continue this conversation. He turned towards the crowd and said: “Fellow Daoists, I’ve made progress with the dao recently and would like to discuss its mysteries with everyone here today. If I made some mistakes, please correct me.”

The crowd became attentive again after hearing this. No one wanted to miss a single word from this supreme genius, especially those from small sects.

“Dao follows the heart, the soul seeks the origin…” He began and spewed out the sound of the dao.

Harmonious words echoed across the area and grasped the audience’s mind. Even elders and ancestors became immersed in the lecture.

It seemed that his reputation was truly deserved. His dao enlightenment exceeded many ancestors’.

Golden lotuses and flowers manifested into reality as he continued. Whenever he came across a profound topic, his words echoed for days. The celestials, yin and yang, and the five elements seemed to be rotating around him.

However, no one saw these wondrous visual phenomena because they were fully immersed in his dao lecture.

Even Peacock Monarch and the ancestors from Dragon couldn’t help but praise him whenever he got to an interesting part.

Five-sun King had earned his current achievements through his own talents and power. He didn’t only follow the footsteps of those before him. Some had toiled for a lifetime and didn’t know as much about the dao as him.
