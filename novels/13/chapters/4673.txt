Chapter 4674: Fight

Spectators became captivated by this meeting. Everyone knew that there could be only one final victor among the five conquerors. But now, there was a new challenger in town - Li Qiye.

“The competition is beginning.” Someone whispered.

Li Qiye was absolutely qualified as a candidate at this point. They just didn’t expect him to fight Five-sun King so soon.

With the exception of Firmament Mortal King, Five-sun King had the weakest background out of the rest.

Though Five-sun School was still a dao lord lineage, it couldn’t compare to Divine Dragon Valley, let alone Three Thousand Dao or True Immortal.

Currently, they didn’t have competitive ancient ancestors against the monarchs of the behemoths, especially not Dao Sanqian. Divine Dragon Valley, on the other hand, still had numerous demon gods.

Therefore, he was at a clear disadvantage. This included his bloodline as well.

Shen Juntian was the son of a dao lord. Therefore, he stood above the rest. As for True Immortal Young Emperor, although his ancestry was unknown, he was born with fate palaces, a supreme talent. This even exceeded Shen Juntian’s bloodline when it came to cultivation effectiveness.

Tian Feng’s ancient demonic bloodline was prestigious as well. However, Five-sun King had a secret true fate of the bloodline of a heavenly eagle. These two things combined made him equal to Tian Feng but still inferior to the other two.

When it came to innate talents, there existed three primary classifications - the dao physique, fate palace, and true fate.

The levels, from weak to bottom, included: inborn, mystic, and primal. The last level was exceedingly rare and mighty, but just the mystic level alone was enough to look down on the majority of geniuses. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

In the current generation, there were around ten young cultivators possessing a mystic true fate. However, a primal fate palace might not show up once each era.

Five-sun King’s bloodline was excellent. The problem was, it wasn’t pure. He wasn’t a direct descendant of the divine beast, only possessing a faint bloodline and relying on cultivation to empower it. This was why it was weaker than Tian Feng’s bloodline since Tian Feng was an actual demon.

While keeping the disadvantages in mind, Five-sun King still became a part of the Five Conquerors. There were other reasons outside of his cultivation talent.

Even ancient ancestors from hidden clans were willing to support him and come out from their hibernation. This was a testament to his charisma.

A big shot from the east once said that he was the heaven’s favorite, capable of changing the path of the future through stratagems.

All eyes were on him right now. They didn’t know the exact ranking of the five but knew enough to respect his achievements and wisdom.

“It’s not that I wish to stop you but I am assigned to guard this area. Letting you pass will be a dereliction of duty and I can’t let my sect down.” Five-sun King shook his head.

“If that’s the case, make your move. Just know that death will be the outcome.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

Few dared to speak in this manner against a conqueror. Li Qiye was one of the qualified few.

“Excuse me then.” Five-sun King took a deep breath: “If I lose, it shows that I wasn’t capable enough to stop you from passing.”

The crowd appreciated his politeness and humility. Everyone preferred the dao lords to be ladies and gentlemen.

“Start.” Li Qiye seemed nonchalant but no one criticized him for being contemptuous any longer.

They watched with bated breath - the fight for the dao lord position was beginning.

Five-sun King didn’t become angry even though his opponent wasn’t taking him seriously. His expression became serious.

“Buzz.” He took out his weapon - Bowl of the World.

“If he becomes a dao lord, will that be his patrimony weapon? Maybe even his paragon weapon?” One spectator whispered.

Chaos laws poured down from the bowl, each weighing ten thousand tons. The bowl seemed to be gestating an immortal world.

“Good treasure.” Li Qiye praised.

“You’re too kind, this is a blessing from the ancestors. They spent many years empowering for it to reach this level.” Five-sun King said.

Some believed that this bowl was created by Five-sun Dao Lord. This was actually false. He merely found a special stone existing way before his era. He then morphed it into a bowl but it still wasn’t a weapon yet.

Five-sun School gestated and empowered the bowl for many eras using worldly energies. It finally became a usable weapon during Five-sun King’s generation.

“Do you have a weapon, Dao Brother?” He asked Li Qiye.

Eyes turned toward Li Qiye. They haven’t seen him use a weapon previously as if he didn’t have one at all.

“My hands will do.” Li Qiye raised his hands and smiled: “But if you think this is insulting, I can take out a weapon.”

Others exchanged glances. The dao lord competition was fierce and merciless. Geniuses would immediately use their best weapons, unlike Li Qiye.

Five-sun King stared at him for a moment before replying: “Do as you please, Dao Brother. My shallow cultivation is not worthy of you using a weapon.”

The crowd preferred his humility over Li Qiye’s arrogance.
