Chapter 4894: A Bit Chilly

Spectators were in awe since they were looking at a legend right now. The Serpent God was one of the six great demons of their lineage. Today, Wild Dragon once again relied on it to escape.

Most didn’t have a good grasp of these deities. They realized the reason why Wild Dragon was able to survive despite losing to Eight-stallion Dao Lord repeatedly.

However, the thing shocking them the most was his escaping from Eight-stallion's daughter. He himself couldn't believe it. He didn’t have to go all-out against Venerable Dragon God but those two fiery beams pierced his body so easily.

The crowd didn’t understand how she managed to muster so much power just like her father. They also connected the beams to a mythical figure - Maddened - due to their power.

Of course, this was not related to Maddened in the slightest.

“Ahh!” Meanwhile, the girl was still suffering from the burn. Her six halos couldn’t protect her from this terrible fate.

On the outside, no one saw any flame ravaging her. This was an internal process - her everything including the true fate was being burned.

The only things keeping her alive were the six dao fruits imprinted inside her as well as Li Qiye’s apogee of fire mastery.

She was normally very stubborn and tough. Alas, her blood, dao, and true fate were all being roasted.

Once her body reached the breaking point, Li Qiye pulled the charcoal out of her body with lightning speed. It seemed less heated than before.

A’zhui fell to the ground, twitching while unconscious.

“Quite fortunate to possess the bloodline of the heaveners.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “The primal flame shall be hers to inherit.”

Firerage, the guards, and everyone else were left speechless. This was the end of the coronation?

“Bam!” Something smashed into the ground next to Li Qiye’s feet, attracting their attention.

This was none other than Monochromatic Master who was captured by Venerable Dragon God.

He had fled the moment he realized that something was off. Alas, what happened next caught him by surprise as well. This gave Venerable enough time to catch him due to the power disparity.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“My Civic Deputy, didn’t you want the imperial seal?” Li Qiye stared at him.

“Your Majesty! This servant was wrong, please spare me!” He begged for mercy.

“A temporary lapse in judgment is understandable.” Li Qiye smiled: “However, you have committed many offenses.”

“Scheming against His Majesty, traitorous to the dynasty, conspiring with villains against fellow subjects. Any of these is punishable by death.” Venerable uttered coldly.

“Dragon God, this is all false, His Majesty said that I should invite Fire Ape and Toad King to the coronation!”

“Oh, I almost forgot.” His comment seemingly reminded Li Qiye of something. The latter absentmindedly loosened his grip on the tongs, causing the charcoal to fall and hit Monochromatic.

“Ahh!” It immediately burned a hole through him.

“Please sp-pare me, Your Majesty!” He screamed and begged, seemingly experiencing the cruelest torture possible.

Listeners shuddered and got chills to the bones.

“You are not worthy of being a dragon god.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

“No-” Monochromatic was reduced to smoke, completely disappearing from existence.

Li Qiye picked up the charcoal and placed it back into the brazier. He shuddered and complained: “Sigh, it is still so cold.”

He sat back down with his legs up, gazing straight at Demoness.

She trembled in fear but was smart enough to come closer. She took off his shoes and placed his feet next to her chest. She looked up and said: “I’ll warm you up, Your Majesty.”

“Mmm.” Li Qiye leaned back and closed his eyes before giving the command: “Kill all troublemakers.”

“Affirmative.” Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God have taken control of the situation.

Villains who wanted to take advantage of the situation were surrounded by soldiers.

“Kill them.” The two of them ordered before joining the battle.

These villains, albeit strong, were no match for the duo and Soaring Stallions, looking as helpless as lambs being decapitated.

The stench of blood permeated through the capital. Corpses scattered everywhere.

Although palaces and buildings were in disarray, the dynasty members’ morale was at an all-time high. It didn’t take long before all the villains and malicious guests were dealt with.

Only those deemed as neutral and friendly were spared and gathered back to the square in front of the monument.

The soldiers then cleaned up the battlefield, taking away the corpses.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye who resembled a mortal king was enjoying the moment, resting his feet in the warm embrace of a beauty.

The winds became colder than before but the crowd didn’t dare to speak. Once the corpses and ruins were removed, the atmosphere became dignified once more.

Everyone lined up in front of the monument, waiting to see Li Qiye’s next command. Most thought that this coronation would be the end of the dynasty. The opposite actually occurred.

Four monsters have fallen while Demoness showed her subservience to Li Qiye. As for Wild Dragon, he fled back to Demon after being defeated by the princess.

It only took one day for Eight-stallion Dynasty to get rid of all of their problems - something truly unbelievable.
