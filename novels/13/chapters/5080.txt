Chapter 5081: All-destroying Wisdom SlashViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She had used her seventh fruit against Eight-stallion Dao Lord before as the final attack. This time, her slash lacked flashiness and gained power.

Her golden avatar seemed heavier as well, making it difficult for the rest of the continents.

“She’s at the peak seventh level already?” One ancient ancestor whispered because there was a considerable improvement.

Each strand of her power was being channeled into the avatar and not a single sliver was wasted. Despite her injuries last time, she managed to recover on top of improving her cultivation in no time at all.

“Impressive.” The other dragon lords admired her cultivation speed.

“Certainly in tune with Buddhism.” Li Qiye said.

Her seven dao fruits appeared and pulsed in and out, creating a dense sphere of chaos true energy. The individual ray was as thick as a mountain range.

Spectators suddenly felt their own grand dao levitating upward and transforming into the next state. This happened all over the lower continents as well.

Eventually, a supreme sword made of the dao was created. It was the pinnacle of the myriad laws, capable of severing anything in existence.

The mortal coil, boundless emotions, and the endless reincarnation cycles - these could be cut down. It reduced everything to nothingness and astounded spectators.

Dragon lords and top masters shuddered in fear. This sword was the embodiment of Buddhist wisdom, capable of obliterating them.

Wisdom Slash - the grand dao of her seventh fruit. This was used previously to kill Eight-stallion Conqueror. Now, she added this to her Buddhist Sever.

“Wisdom Buddhist Sever!” She roared and became the lord of all things as she raised the sword of energy.

“Slash!” She swung the sword down and caused the world to turn dark.

“Ahh!” Numerous cultivators bellowed and pissed their pants in terror. Some couldn’t even let out an audible scream.

This was the limit of her dao - all inhabitants felt as if they were being decapitated and then reduced to ashes.

“Boom!” Everything starting from the high heaven where the tip of the blade was all the way to the bottom dissipated.

Spectators immediately sealed their vision and hearing, not wanting to be crippled by the blast.

After a long while, they finally opened their eyes to see the result. Did Li Qiye survive?

Once the dust settled, they saw him standing there holding the same branch. It was broken now so he clearly used it to block the attack.

This shocked them even more than when she displayed her wonderful cultivation. No one here could have stopped that combination slash. Alas, Li Qiye did it with a dried branch and they saw it with their own eyes.

“Li Qiye got this for sure.” This became the consensus in everyone’s mind. He could beat her without using a weapon.

Conceal Conqueror herself turned pale since it was her first time facing such a terrifying opponent.

She wasn’t afraid of fighting stronger cultivators. Alas, none of her best moves worked and it didn’t make any sense. Numerous ideas about his identity flashed in her mind.

“It was an impressive slash but since you’re facing me, it fell short of success and couldn’t display its true potential.” Li Qiye said.
