Chapter 4444: Entering

The knowledgeable demon god saw Li Qiye swatting them away and couldn’t believe it.

He experienced just how intense these rays were. Nonetheless, they could be blocked and destroyed…

However, Li Qiye simply changed their direction by smacking them. This was unfathomable due to their speed and power.

With Li Qiye as the starting point, the rays shot out everywhere again. However, they didn’t hit the demon god or any other star.

In reality, given his mastery, he could have easily redirected them towards the stars but he chose against it.

Eventually, the demon god noticed that the rays were farming a massive, inscrutable diagram. The brilliance emanating from it illuminated the entire space, banishing the darkness with ease.

“Boom!” Once the brightness reached the limit, the rays suddenly exploded - the scene of an apocalypse.

The stars finally fell victim to this ultimate explosion while the demon god felt a threat and shouted: “Defense!”

He finally used all nine tails. They coiled together and formed the ultimate shield blessed by numerous totems.

The explosion struck his strongest defense, wave after wave. He felt that he was a small boat being stuck in a storm, on the verge of capsizing at any second.

Nonetheless, the great cultivator still managed to survive the explosion. He staggered backward continuously but remained balanced. He heaved a sigh of relief afterward and looked up.

The stars that attacked them were nowhere to be found right now. However, a coordinate node was finally visible and pulsed brightly.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye stepped on the node and he did the same without any hesitation.

Both were teleported to another dimension…

Just like that, the duo leaped through numerous chaotic dimensions in Ravaged Land. From the outside, this place didn’t look particularly large in the grand scheme of things.

However, beneath the fog and mist were numerous chaotic dimensions. Traversing through them required finding the right coordinate nodes.

During their journey, the demon god became increasingly afraid. They have entered some dangerous dimensions. Just one misstep and he would die here. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Moreover, he found the nodes to be too complicated. This might be the reason why numerous dao lords returned empty-handed. It required a true mastery of spatial manipulation.

Finally, the two fell straight down in the path of a vertical beam. He felt that he was returning to the real world.

It was as if they were back in the free fall. It was that this time around, there was a beam taking them down through the fog.

Eventually, they saw a circular barrier at the bottom. It was obvious that whatever inside was special.

Alas, cultivators couldn’t come close because the barrier was embedded with numerous dao runes of the lightning affinity. Coming close meant being annihilated.

Sure enough, when they fell down and Li Qiye touched the barrier, all the lightning bolts immediately attacked him.

The ocean of lightning bolts could eradicate numerous ancestors in the blink of an eye. The demon god was ready and used his nine tails again.

However, they easily broke through his ultimate defense. He managed to erect it fast enough to stop the onslaught.

Unfortunately, he didn’t know how long he would be able to keep up against the relentless assault. His vitality was depleting and he wouldn’t be able to fuel the barrier any longer.

In the past, he was smart enough to escape whenever things got dangerous. He only made it this far because of Li Qiye.

As for Li Qiye, he raised his hand and exuded a melting light, akin to fire melting snowflakes.

Sure enough, he actually managed to create a large hole in the runic barrier.
