Chapter 4984: Seeing The Little Girl Again

Their conversation was interrupted by a member who came in for a report.

“City Lord, there is a challenger outside. Several demon monarchs have been injured already.”

“A challenger?” Goldcrest frowned.

“Looks like you have a lot of enemies, Brother Goldcrest.” Yunyun chuckled.

He smiled wryly and said: “I really don’t since I’ve always focused on the dao.”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“They might be here for the god source.” He paused for a second before adding.

“If that’s the case, it doesn’t bode well for your city.” Li Qiye said.

Goldcrest knew Li Qiye was right. Countless demons desired the remnant pieces right now in order to improve their power.

“Let’s go take a look.” Goldcrest said. The enemy was already knocking on the door; he couldn’t be a coward and hide.

They climbed up the city wall in order to see the challenger. 

Meanwhile, demon monarchs of Phoenix took this very seriously. Several members have been wounded already.

“Rooster, come out here, I want to see your real form.” A pleasant voice came from beneath.

Li Qiye and the others found this all too familiar.

Goldcrest looked down and saw a cute girl posing aggressively with both hands on her waist.

“Princess Ming Shi.” He smiled wryly and didn’t expect this.

“You have been a bad boy.” She leaped into the air and unleashed a fist containing a majestic dao.

The demons shuddered after seeing her attack.

She was a Supreme Sovereign from Untethered - an orthodox sect specialized in the dao. Thus, her techniques contained immense power.

He laughed and placed his arms together, summoning white wings to form a shield.

“Boom!” He didn’t even move from the punch since his empowered form boosted him to the next level.

“Rooster, why did you hide your real identity? A monarch pretending to be a lowly demon in Abroad.” Ming Shi demanded an answer.

“Your Highness, I never pretended to be a lowly demon.” He said.

“You didn’t tell us your true background.” Ming Shi said.

Fortunately for Goldcrest, Yunyun joined the conversation: “Why are you here, Ming Shi?”

“Yunyun, Young Noble?! Why are you two here as well?” Ming Shi said.

“We’re tracking someone.” Yunyun said.

“I’m here with the seniors. We passed by this place and my senior aunt said something about a city lord known as Goldcrest, that’s why I’m here to teach him a lesson.”

“Tendril King is here too?” Goldcrest clicked his tongue in admiration.

“Indeed, I told them I have a friend here so they went ahead.” She smiled.

Tendril King might be her senior but was still considered as part of the young generation. Her talent and power far exceeded them. Even Radiant Young Monarch couldn’t hold a candle to her. [1]

She was a dragon lord with five sacred fruits, rumored to be training with an ancient art. Given her talent, she was qualified to enter the upper continents and still be a top dog there.

“Rooster, I bet you were afraid of us coming here and taking your stuff since you’re a rich city lord. Lying to us is unforgivable.” Ming Shi regained her focus.

“No, I merely didn’t comment on it, please forgive me.” He said before changing the topic: “Tendril King is incredible, how does she know what is going on in Demon as well?”

Others didn’t know about his background but Tendril King was able to spot Phoenix and knew about him. It seemed that she had great knowledge of the region.

“Of course, my senior aunt will be the ruler of Untethered, nothing can elude her eyes.” Ming Shi said proudly.

“Indeed, we will never be able to catch up.” Yunyun said sentimentally.

She had a chance of becoming the ruler of Primal in the future. Alas, she felt inferior and unworthy when compared to Tendril King.

“Why are your seniors here?” Goldcrest asked.

Cultivators such as Tendril King didn’t travel for no reason. Normally, these big shots would just stay and protect their sect. Therefore, something big must be happening.

“She said that your Peacock Monarch is near death, a visit is necessary.” Ming Shi said.

“So she’s here for the god sources too, how did the information get out so fast?” Goldcrest shuddered.

“You got one?” Ming Shi asked.

“Ahem…” Goldcrest cleared his throat and didn’t answer.

“Please, I don’t care for it but hehehe, my senior aunt might. If you don’t hand it over, she’ll chop off your head.” Ming Shi gave him the side eye.

“Why is Tendril King interested in the god sources?” Yunyun asked.

It was understandable for demons in the Ten Great Mountains to desire the god source. Tendril King was also a demon but not part of this system.

“The Demon God’s divine nest, surely.” Li Qiye said.

“Exactly, Young Noble. My aunt wishes to enter the divine nest.” Ming Shi said.

“Is it possible?” Yunyun heard legends that this enigmatic place couldn’t be visited by just anyone.
