Chapter 4890: Ambition

Venerable reached his peak state with the help of the Azure formation. He has shown his ace card and the dynasty’s foundation.

Losing to Wild Dragon meant the destruction of Eight-stallion. A massacre awaited them.

“Perish!” He roared and leaped into the air for a direct thrust at the gigantic earthdragon.

“Good!” A burning claw with an unbearable heat came from above. The ground beneath turned into lava.

“Boom!” Fiery sparks scattered everywhere with shockwaves destroying mountains.

This was absolutely a top-level fight. Guests and villains became frozen at this sight since this battle could change the landscape of the three lower continents.

During this battle, Old Xiang came out of his hut and looked into the sky. He coughed and murmured: “Trouble’s incoming.” With that, he went back inside and fell asleep, not giving a damn.

As for Li Qiye, he was completely forgotten and left alone since everyone became occupied with observing the battle.

“Hehehe, the era of Eight-stallion is over.” Pyromancer walked toward Li Qiye with a smile while waving his torch.

“You dare?!” Firerage immediately blocked in front of Li Qiye.

“Your dynasty will perish today, must you be buried with the brat?” Pyromancer sneered and waved his torch.

It became brighter and released an inferno capable of burning Eight-stallion down to ashes. He had done this before in the past, and not just once.

“Be careful.” The guests immediately got away from the monument.

“You won’t be doing anything here.” Northern Monarch stepped forward and released her grand dao, aiming it straight at Pyromancer.

Serenity was the name of her dao. Its activation caused the inferno to shrink back into the torch.

“Northern Monarch.” Pyromancer glared, not daring to underestimate this famous genius.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She already had two sacred fruits and couldn’t be weaker than him.

“Death to evildoers in my dynasty.” She intensified her dao, causing everyone to retreat.

Pyromancer reacted quickly and spat out flames without holding back. If her dao couldn’t stop it, then the dynasty would be trapped in an ocean of fire.

Thus, she was occupied with keeping the flames at bay using her cultivation. Spectators were impressed by her radiant and regal aura.

“Break!” Pyromancer swung his torch to create a fire dragon, wanting to take down Serenity.

“Blazing Sun!” She raised both hands and shot a sun at the dragon.

The creature roared and a fiery battle ensued. Nearby guests’ clothes immediately turned to ashes. They shuddered while watching a destructive contest between two different types of fire.

“Your Majesty, it is time to leave.” Monochromatic Master came over and told Li Qiye.

“Where to?” Li Qiye smiled.

“It is no longer safe here, I will take you to safety.” He hurriedly said.

“Civic Deputy, please stay back.” Firerage warned.

“Guard Commander, everything I do is for His Majesty’s sake.” Monochromatic said.

“No need, it is safe here.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Your Majesty, please listen to me.” Monochromatic insisted.

“It is fine, leave.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Your Majesty, if you insist on staying here, I’m afraid I will have to offend you.” Monochromatic’s expression darkened as he lost patience.

“Civic Deputy, how dare you not obey?!” Firerage shouted.

Other officials turned back after hearing him and glared at Monochromatic, wanting to protect Li Qiye.

Though both civic and military officials disliked or even hated Li Qiye, he was still part of the official branch. Traitors must be punished.

“Guard Commander, it seems like you’re the one who wishes to keep him close in order to make him a puppet.” Monochromatic shouted back: “Please come with us, Your Majesty.”

“Your Majesty, come.” Fire Ape came over.

“Stay back!” The officials and soldiers gathered in front of Li Qiye.

“Hehe, all of you are traitors who harbor malice against His Majesty.” Toad King walked up the monument.

“Protect His Majesty!” Firerage shouted, ordering his men and other soldiers to come help.

“No need.” Li Qiye said before staring at Monochromatic: “Civic Deputy, you have lost your cool with this disgraceful act.”

“Your Majesty, you are surrounded by sycophants and villains, we only wish to protect you.” Monochromatic said.

“You and them?” Li Qiye glanced at Toad King and Fire Ape.

“Your Majesty, you asked me to invite the heroes of the world to protect you and kill the traitors.” Monochromatic said.

“I’m afraid all I see right now are loyal subjects, only a few traitors.” Li Qiye said.

“Monochromatic, don’t waste time with this brat. Seize the seal and then we can leave!” Fire Ape shouted.

“Oh, so this is what you want.” Li Qiye glanced down at the imperial seal hanging in front of his chest: “You don’t want to be an official in Eight-stallion anymore, Civic Deputy?”
