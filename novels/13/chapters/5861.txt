Chapter 5861: I Allowed Them To Flourish

The boundless cosmic being had never shown his true form before. The larger overlords were astounded to see the little dwarf.

“Tianzu, you’ve finally shown yourself, so it is true.” Li Qiye said flatly.

“You’ve seen Tianji before then.” Tianzu had a pale expression.

“Yes, but I’m curious, why is Tianshou different from you two?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmph.” Epoch’s End said: “Machine Epoch’s prosperity was built on my intelligence, I was the one who gave machine life.”

“A bit of an exaggeration, no? You should be saying ‘we’, not ‘I’. And, I believe it is mainly Tianji’s contribution, you were the assistant, at best.” Li Qiye said.

“Ignorant brat, what do you know? Tianji merely helped Tianshou, matching his life with his supreme body. I was the ruler of all races in Machine, its cultivation method came from me. I connected our world with the myriad races while the machines were mere weapons.” Epoch’s End had an ugly expression as he shouted.

“Let me guess, your world had living machines. Tianshou was one of them, but you and Tianji were dwarves. Tianji relied on his genius and skillful hands to help Tianshou evolve into something worthy of his supreme frame.” Li Qiye blinked at Epoch’s End and continued: “In other words, Tianji was the one who started the cultivation techniques and Tianshou was the perfect lifeform, the ultimate embodiment of what your world could be.”

He stroked his chin and continued: “Well, they most likely got distracted afterward. Tianji focused on the mysteries of the high heaven after perfecting a cultivation method while Tianshou whose cultivation had reached the limit was no longer bound by the mortal world. You and the others were no longer significant, so he left Machine World in search of something else.”

“Hmph, Tianshou had no reason to be arrogant, he did nothing for our epoch. Tianji comprehended the mysteries and laws of the ages but so what, he shut himself off from the world. I was the one who took care of the myriad races, allowing them to flourish.” Epoch’s End raised his voice.

“I see, you were jealous of them because you ranked last among the three lords of Machine World.” Li Qiye said: “Although you believed that you were a benevolent ruler, the living beings respected Tianshou and Tianji, an unbeatable mech and a sage with peerless wisdom. Tianshou was too strong, his light extended beyond your epoch and you paled in comparison. They only saw him and not you.”

He paused for a moment before continuing: “It wasn’t your fault, how could you compete with a perfect being? But Tianji bothered you more. He was the pioneer of the grand dao and Machine’s cultivation system. The problem was that he was a researcher, so his findings were disseminated through your hands. You found yourself to be the bringer of prosperity and cultivation, but they didn’t hold this view, whether it be the common people or the strongest cultivators. They revered Tianshou as the highest lord, the head. As for Tianji, he allowed everyone to grow stronger and master their destiny, hence spine.”

Epoch’s End’s expression grew uglier as Li Qiye spoke.

“Despite your administration and reign, they knew that power and knowledge came from Tianshou and Tianji, you only served as a connection between them and the world, similar to how feet connect people to the ground, hence feet.

Despite having less contribution, you believe that you have done more than them.” Li Qiye said.

“Without my leadership, they would have become nothing more than bloodthirsty savages, unworthy of civilization and prosperity. Damn them, they deserved death!” Epoch’s End concluded with a chilling glare.

“So it’s jealousy.” Li Qiye sighed and said: “I initially thought that it was greed.”

“Hmph, I ruled the world and have seen all sorts of temptations, never faltering once.” Epoch’s End uttered coldly.

“No, you couldn’t resist the temptation of fame and prestige, not flesh and blood. You hated how you didn’t shine as much as Tianshou and Tianji despite being the savior of Machine World, such ugly jealousy.” Li Qiye said.

“Since they didn’t appreciate nor know who gave them their golden age, I destroyed them for they were undeserving.” Epoch’s End snorted. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“This is why people should never try to become saviors or take pride in it. The world will let them down.” Li Qiye sighed.

Listeners finally understood the origin of Epoch’s End - an overlord of the fallen Machine World.

“So that’s where Three Thousand World Mech came from.” The founder of Celestial Court murmured.

People assumed that this paragon artifact came from one of the five overlords of Celestial Court. In reality, his master - Trinity Ancestor - obtained it from Epoch’s End. He didn’t know more details about this transaction.

However, Trinity Ancestor believed that his inborn dao chaos physique was superior, so he didn’t bother bringing the mech on the expedition.

Did Machine World become the base of the paragon artifact? No one could answer this but one thing was for certain, this world had been destroyed by Epoch’s End.

“Haha, how amusing.” Voracious laughed and said: “He does deserve to die.”

Voracious devoured his epoch due to his insatiable greed but Epoch’s End did it out of jealousy.
