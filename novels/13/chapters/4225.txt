Chapter 4226: Overlords

Neutral cultivators also followed Li Qiye’s legion into the sea region. Some tagged right behind them and started chanting as well.

“Seven Nights Immortal, utterly incomparable!” More and more people joined so the shouting became louder.

The shift in Li Qiye’s public image was consistent and positive. The young master who has nothing but money earned many friends and believers.

In fact, some ancestors joined the group as well, albeit with reservation. They didn’t chant as loud as the others.

The remaining big shots exchanged glances, wondering if they should do the same thing.

“So there are three main forces right now?” One big shot said: “We have Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel, Li Qiye’s faction, then the rest.”

His group agreed with this statement. Since the alliance between Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel was virtually unstoppable, only Li Qiye gave them hope. The only way to oppose the behemoths was to join Li Qiye.

Those who didn’t want to join Li Qiye couldn’t join the alliance either. After all, the alliance most likely didn’t care for them nor did they need more cultivators.

As time passed, the neutral group started losing members, many of whom decided to join Li Qiye’s faction. This trend forced the rest to join Li Qiye, not wanting to be isolated.

Eventually, nearly all the other great powers were on Li Qiye’s side.

“Seven Nights Immortal, utterly incomparable!” This silly chant somehow gave them courage and made their blood boil with excitement.

Once they got deep enough into the sea region, they were met by suffocating auras. The individual wave of energy made it impossible for them to move forward.

This was akin to having an entire mountain range pressing down on their shoulders. This made them crouch down while heaving for air.

“This power…” They naturally knew where these mighty auras were coming from - the two overlords.

The legion finally stopped since the island was before them. On top were two legions; both had soaring banners.

A few were gilded, meaning that the big shots of their sect were present. They saw ancestors with gray hair and monstrous aura.

Though not all of the six sword gods and five ancient ancestors were here, just a few were enough to intimidate anyone.

However, all of them stood behind two old men in order to show subservience. They had to be Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra.

Both were meditating but they opened their eyes to gaze at the incoming legion.

Everyone stared at them in awe. Some thought that seeing the duo made the trip worth it. The five overlords have reigned for many years but not many actually saw them in person.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Thus, this was a monumental event for many. They thought that their imaginations of these beings were rather wrong.

Vastsea Venerable was a sea demon with a complicated bloodline. His long ears draped down to his shoulders.

There was a widespread belief that those with long ears like this were destined for success. Vastsea Venerable was the manifestation of this belief.

A simple robe covered his impressive stature. Though he was sitting down, others felt as if they needed to look up to see him, a being as majestic as a majestic mountain.

There was no radiance and visual phenomena around him. Alas, everyone shuddered as he gazed at them. This alone immobilized them and left them helpless.

As for Earthraiser Vajra, he was from the Sacred Spirit Race. His frame was far smaller compared to Vastsea Venerable.

His eyebrows were white like snow, long enough to extend down to his chest. This seemed to be a sign of longevity. Despite his humble size, no one could ignore him. He gave the impression of being a pillar capable of shouldering the sky itself. This was similar to the pressure emanated from Vastsea Venerable. Others simply felt inferior when in their presence.

His robe was a faint yellow and had a simplistic regal style. He seemed to be attuned with nature; each action of his contained untold force.

Both of them have purposely contained their aura and vitality in order to not affect others. Nonetheless, something innate about their very existence and cultivation suffocated those nearby.
