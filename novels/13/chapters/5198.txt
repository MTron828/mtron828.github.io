Chapter 5199: Eaten

The man’s mighty aura pulsed outward across Alchemy Dao. Its heat was unbearable for the disciples despite them being around flames every day.

Even ancestors had a hard time withstanding this temperature. This was partly due to his cultivation but most importantly, he possessed a unique demonic true flame at birth.

“Dracoflame Sparrow!” The Alchemy Dao’s ancient ancestors’ expression darkened.

“I apologize for the rude entrance.” The middle-aged man said: “I reported my visit to your disciples but due to the long wait, I took it upon myself to enter.”

Panacea and Gourdkeeper scowled after hearing this.

“What do you want?” Panacea uttered coldly.

“I am here under my master’s order to let you know that the date draws near. If Alchemy Dao has no objection, he will continue to rule.” Dracoflame Sparrow said.

Gourdkeeper glanced at the youth standing behind him. He was no stranger to the saintess - Oddflame Pill Monarch.

“Looks like you got help from Darkflame Cauldron Emperor.” Panacea snorted.

“This doesn’t violate any rule since the emperor has no sect affiliation. Of course, feel free to challenge my master again, whether it be alchemy or cultivation.” Dracoflame was a direct disciple of Suppression Conqueror and had nine sacred fruits.

As for Darkflame Cauldron Emperor, he was one of the best alchemists right now. Only Jadecure Conqueror was on the same level.

Of course, most preferred to ask her for help because her pills were orthodox and gentle. On the other hand, his pills were certainly effective, but not without side effects.

“Don’t forget that he is in Divine Alliance.” Gourdkeeper said.

“He is first a member of Hundred Dao. Plus, Divine Alliance is not an actual sect.” Dracoflame smiled.

“Mere sophistry.” Panacea responded.

“It is the truth, which is why you accepted defeat and my master became the ruler of the city. He is reasonable and obeys the rule, everyone knows this. Thus, no need to bring this up again, Monarch.” Dracoflame said.

The only reason why they didn’t accept Suppression Conqueror was due to his not being from the main branch. Nonetheless, he did not usurp the throne and followed all the ancestral rules.

“I am here today just to ask whether Alchemy Dao will rescind your claim or otherwise.” He went on.

“Hmph, don’t even think about it. His term is over, he needs to leave the city.” Panacea said.

“Then Alchemy Dao will have to defeat my master. Which do you pick?” Dracoflame asked.

“Pill Dao then.” Panacea exchanged glances with Gourdkeeper for a second before deciding.

“Who will the challenger be? You or the conqueror?” Dracoflame inquired.

“Our conqueror will take part.” Panacea said.

“I heard that she is not currently in Alchemy Dao or Imperial Alliance.” Dracoflame smiled.

“Don’t worry about our business. She will be there at the designated hour.” Gourdkeeper said.

“Perfect, my master will be waiting. Now, I must leave to go inform Qilin Manor and Iron Tree.” Dracoflame said.

“I suggest that you stop trying to take over Imperial Attendant.” Gourdkeeper said.

“No, we are a part of Imperial Attendant and only wish to contribute.” Dracoflame said.

“Is that so? I can see Suppression’s ambition already, pointing his sword at Imperial Alliance.” Panacea said.

“I do not dare to comment on this matter.” Dracoflame shook his head.

As Dracoflame was leaving with Oddflame, the latter noticed another group.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It’s you!” Oddflame shouted.

Dracoflame stared intensely at Li Qiye; sparks appeared in his eyes.

“Sir, you killed the six gods back in Immortal’s Peak?” He asked.

“Probably.” Li Qiye stopped and yawned.

“Looks like you weren’t just a passerby.” Dracoflame said while still trying to analyze Li Qiye.

“Senior, kill him.” Oddflame said, confident of his backer.

“I spared you once yet you court death?” Li Qiye smiled and ordered True Bear: “Kill him.”

“Raa!” True Bear rushed straight for the youth.

“Protect me, Senior!” He immediately hid behind Dracoflame.

“Halt!” Dracoflame waved his hand and released a cauldron with a divine inferno toward the bear.

The servant behind Li Qiye instantly retaliated and easily suppressed the cauldron, destroying the inferno within and forcing Dracoflame back.

“Ahh!” Oddflame couldn’t run and fought back to no avail against the mighty beast.

“My master knows Sword Sea Dao Lord, Divine Alliance will destroy you if you…” Oddflame was scared out of his mind once the bear opened its jaw.

“Crack!” The bear didn’t care for the threat and ate him alive.

Dracoflame could only watch because the servant was ready to stop him.

“You are cruel for letting your beast run amok.” Dracoflame told Li Qiye.

“So what?” Li Qiye said casually: “Your master is Suppression Conqueror, correct?”

“That’s right.” Dracoflame didn’t dare to underestimate Li Qiye.

“Tell him to get out of Imperial Attendant City or I will stomp him to death.” Li Qiye said.

“You!” Dracoflame’s expression became ugly.
