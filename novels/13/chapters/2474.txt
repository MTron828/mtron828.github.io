Yang Bofan had many admirers in the audience. Even the arrogant geniuses had nothing but praises for him.

His strong qualities had nothing to do with his master and his background. His exceptional talents spoke volumes.

Remember, Eight Formation True Emperor only had two palaces but Bofan, his disciple, was already a third-level True God.

The emperor wasn’t as strong as Eternals or his peers, but ordinary Ascenders couldn’t compare to him.

The issue here was that Bofan was still very young and hasn’t become his disciple for that long. Being a third-level True God already was very impressive and indicative of his amazing talents.

Some even said that he was more gifted and brilliant than his master. Perhaps catching up was only a matter of time.

Today, his visit here on behalf of the emperor was worth musing over.

“How has the emperor being?” Jianyao has not granted any audience until now. This special privilege only further proved Bofan’s talents, not just because his master was a True Emperor.

Ma Jinming was inferior to him in this regard despite having a legion commander - an Eternal - for a father.

However, Jinming still couldn’t gain Jianyao’s respect so Bofan was clearly above him.

“Fairy, my venerable master has been in isolated cultivation.” Bofan quickly bowed and said.

“He wants to open his third palace?” Jianyao asked.

“Fairy, he is not aiming for the third palace but rather researching the Immortal Slaying Ancient Formation left behind by the forefathers.” Bofan revealed.

“Immortal Slaying?” Jianyao was surprised to hear this: “The emperor is indeed a master at formations, virtually peerless in the contemporary. The fact that he is in isolated cultivation for Immortal Slaying means that he has a great comprehension of it already, not bad. He might reach grand completion the day he comes out.”

“Thank you for your blessing, Fairy.” Bofan said: “Master did have some good findings prior to this session, he is aiming at understanding the formation’s core profundities this time.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Immortal Slaying has always been difficult to control.” Jianyao nodded: “If he could understand it, he would be a tiger with wings roaming through the realms.”

“I do hope so, and we’ll require your help in the future.” Bofan said.

The crowd was startled to hear such high praises from Jianyao.

“Immortal Slaying Ancient Formation?” The young ones have never heard of this name before.

Meanwhile, the older experts and even the ancestors shuddered.

“Is it really strong?” A youth curiously asked.

“Very.” His ancestor said with a grave tone: “Myriad Formation Kingdom clearly relies on formations to compete with the rest of the world. The kingdom itself is a super formation, but they also have three other supreme formations. However, strictly speaking about arrays and complexity, Immortal Slaying is far superior to the other three. It wasn’t created by that kingdom, its origin is too old to be traced. Well, you can tell just how strong it is from its title. Unfortunately, few people from Myriad Formation could actually control this formation. It requires the realm of an emperor just to start learning about it...”

The ancestor paused for a bit with a serious expression: “If the emperor could actually understand it, it’ll make him comparable to a three-palace emperor and could even fight against a four-palace emperor.”

“Surpassing levels at the imperial realm...” People took a deep breath.

Those with common sense knew that at the imperial realm, the levels were very strict. A two-palace emperor couldn’t fight against a two-palace emperor. Having an additional palace meant total oppression. One exception to this rule was if the lower-level combatant was in possession of an ancestral weapon.

However, if Eight Formation True Emperor were to learn Immortal Slaying, then he could challenge emperors above him up to the fourth level.

“It’s just like an ancestral weapon, or even stronger than a common one.” Another murmured.

Remember, Nine Secrets System has been around for so long after its progenitor’s era. Thus, only a few lineages had an ancestral weapon.

Understanding this formation would give the emperor an ace card fortifying his status in the system.

“It looks like Fairy Qin views the emperor highly.” A speculator whispered.

“He is worthy of it if he can figure out that formation.” Someone from the last generation nodded: “The guy will be unstoppable among the young generation, even Waterwatch Saber Saint might not be able to take him on. At that point, Calm Lotus might start supporting him in the competition for the throne.”

“That’s true.” His peers agreed: “If he becomes the one with the most potential in our system, then he should be the king, nothing’s surprising there.”

“The Bingchi is quite perceptive. They sent a downtrodden princess to the new king and married Hanyu to Eight Formation True Emperor instead. Myriad Formation, the Bingchi, and with Calm Lotus’ support? I think that’s game over.” People shuddered after realizing this.

The Bingchi and Myriad Formation were two of the five great powers. Their alliance was already strong enough, so if the emperor were to win the support of Calm Lotus, then that’s three great powers in their alliance.

Who would be able to compete against them then? Eight Formation True Emperor would definitely become the next king.

While people were still musing about this matter, another meeting took place.

A youth came riding a vigorous stallion. It rode the waves just like a true dragon flying in the mist. He had an impressive and dominating aura despite not moving that quickly. Such presence attracted everyone’s gaze.

“It’s General Tang.” The spectators immediately recognized this rider.

“Tang Hexiang. Since when did he get here? So secretive.” Someone else said.

“No idea, I don’t think anyone saw him.” People glanced at each other, confused.

Hexiang was the commander of the Imperial Guards, a great genius of War Saint Dynasty, and a practitioner of the word, Zhe.

“He’s coming to see Fairy Qin too.” Everyone knew what he was trying to do.

“Well, he’s still a good candidate for the throne, supported by War Saint Dynasty.” An older expert said.

After the king lost his kingdom, Hexiang became the de-facto leader of War Saint. Many supported him becoming their next ruler.

After all, he was also from the royal clan - a great advantage. After the disappearance of Li Qiye, he had a good claim to the throne based on his background and status.

Because of this, the six legions and their commanders wanted him to be the next king.

This created a stalemate after the siege of the imperial palace between Myriad Formation, the Bingchi, and Myriad Formation. They couldn’t pick out a new king.

“Hexiang is strong but I don’t think he can take on Eight Formation True Emperor. Plus, the Bingchi and Myriad Formation are stronger than the six legions.” Someone commented.

“In theory, yes.” His senior elaborated: “But don’t forget, Hexiang has a better rightful claim to the throne. He’s part of the royal clan, so the other sects won’t have a problem with him taking over. It would be a lawful coronation. On the other hand, this doesn’t apply for Eight Formation True Emperor, it would be considered a usurping attempt. Not everyone will accept him.”

People agreed with this statement. Hexiang’s royal background was a great advantage.
