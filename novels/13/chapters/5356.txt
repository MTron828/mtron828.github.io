Chapter 5357: Sacred Tree

The trio rode the same boat across the dangerous river. Xiao Hu was annoyed by Ferocity since the guy was trying to steal his spot.

Ferocity wanted to stay by Li Qiye and felt bored along the way. Thus, he decided to occasionally tease Xiao Hu.

Others might be afraid of Ferocity but not Xiao Hu. After all, he spent his time with Hallowed Dao Lord and had met many big shots previously. He had a good response and traded blows with Ferocity. The latter couldn’t do anything to Xiao Hu in Li Qiye’s presence.

Eventually, they made it to the other shore. Once they left the boat, it started crumbling into the water.

More cultivators reached the other shore; their boats disappeared as well.

They saw a mountain range with towering peaks and heavenly waterfalls. Palaces were built among the clouds and exuded flashing rays. Within the ravines and gullies were noises from treasures.

“Fortune awaits us!” Many big shots and ancestors became impatient and started rushing toward the hidden palaces and ravines.

As for the top conquerors and dao lords, they didn’t care for these treasures and fortunes. Their goal was something else entirely.

“Why are you here?” Xiao Hu asked Ferocity.

“I am here for anima dreamwater, nothing more.” Ferocity revealed.

“Oh, you’re trying to create a sacred tree.” Xiao Hu said.

“Don’t be tricked by him, he already has anima.” Li Qiye chuckled and told Xiao Hu.

“You have a sacred tree already?” Xiao Hu couldn’t believe it because his master was still unable to reach anima.

Of course, an anima tree of a conqueror was different from a dragon lord’s sacred tree.

“Wait, I know of your reputation of being arrogant and untethered, but how are you losing every time when you already have anima?” Xiao Hu questioned.

“Who says I lose every time?!” Ferocity angrily glared at the youth.

Xiao Hu wasn’t afraid and said: “My master told me about how you got crushed by Immortal Pagoda Conqueror.”

“Crush is the wrong word, it was only a flesh wound.” Ferocity coughed awkwardly and said: “Plus, it’s Immortal Pagoda Conqueror we’re talking about. Not even All-things and Supreme can withstand that pagoda, he has a primordial fruit, you know? How many conquerors or dao lords in history do you think have one?”

“True…” Xiao Hu agreed again.

Ferocity decided to tease the youth again: “Your master can’t push up that pagoda either, just one go and he’ll take a journey down to the yellow river.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You!” Xiao Hu became angry as well but couldn’t retort.

He wasn’t ignorant enough to think that his master could survive an encounter with Immortal Pagoda Conqueror.

Firstly, this conqueror possessed the unique primordial fruit. Secondly, his master had yet to obtain anima.

“The only person who can stop that pagoda directly is Calamity Dao Lord.” Xiao Hu eventually said.

“Can’t argue with that.” Ferocity was happy to see the youth being annoyed.

“Hmph, at least my master dares to challenge Supreme. What about you?” Xiao Hu barked back.

“I will not since the gap has only widened since my last defeat. His sacred tree is mighty and beyond my reach. I admit that your master is impressive, not only because of his sword dao but also his courage and determination which I lack.” Ferocity had no problem admitting this.

“It’s not that you lack them, you’re just not as courageous and determined as Hallowed.” Li Qiye said: “If he were to remove his bloodline shackles, he’d become an exceptional apex dao lord.”

Xiao Hu had a proud expression after hearing Li Qiye’s high evaluation of his master. It was particularly meaningful since it came from Li Qiye himself.

“Yes.” Ferocity accepted wholeheartedly because Hallowed was well-respected among his peers.

“Buzz.” As they moved forward, they heard the sounds of battle.

“Boom!” Mighty auras surged around them; any weaker cultivator would be blown flying or even killed.

They looked up and saw a towering tree, enough to astound anyone. Its light made it seem ethereal without a physical body. However, upon closer inspection, one could really touch it.

Since it blotted out the sky, its light illuminated the region. Otherwise, there would only be darkness around the great tree. The light seemed to be protecting and blessing everything underneath.

Surprisingly enough, the colossal tree only had nine leaves. Nonetheless, each was as large as a continent.

They had their own galaxy - sun and moon, the stars, and then all the beautiful landscapes commonly seen elsewhere. Due to their sheer size, just nine leaves were enough to blot out the sky.
