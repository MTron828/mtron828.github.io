Chapter 4785: Limit Of The Fist Dao

Tian Tu might be the only person to have learned a dao from Worldbreaker without becoming a fist slave. Alas, his name was unfamiliar to the current generation.

“So strange, why does the first disciple of Blessed Dao Lord not have any amazing battle record and legends?” A mighty cultivator whispered.

This question was reasonable given his tutelage. All of Blessed Dao Lord’s disciples eventually made a name for themselves, contributing greatly to True Immortal.

Because of this, they were part of the historical annals. Of course, as time passed, these stories disappeared as well but remnants still remained. This didn’t apply to Tian Tu.

No one from True Immortal had an idea about him with the exception of the upper echelon. Nonetheless, Specter Monarch did confirm his identity so this dispelled all doubts.

“If you already know, why are you here?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I pursuit the way of the fist and only the way of the fist, nothing else.” Tian Tu calmly responded.

“So here to test it out on me?” Li Qiye asked.

“There are plenty of people stronger than me. I’ve seen the vestige of an immortal during my youth. Now that was invincible but it still isn’t my pursuit.” Tian Tu said.

This comment was interpreted differently by the crowd. Regular cultivators didn’t think much of it. After all, the word “immortal” has been used colloquially and was no longer confined to a strict definition.

On the other hand, knowledgeable and ancient beings became emotional. Given Tian Tu’s background, he has seen the miracles performed by his master and wouldn’t use the word “immortal” to describe them. There were too many and none was worthy of this word.

This meant that he was referring to something extraordinary that was not done by his master, hence their astonishment.

“What is your wish today?” Li Qiye smiled.

“To face defeat by the fist dao for that is the only thing I see.” The soft tone contained domineering confidence. He implied that no one in the world could compare to him in this regard.

“There is the fist scripture and Godfist in Worldbreaker, but the dao doesn’t stop there.” He continued.

This left the crowd frozen with many things coursing through their mind. Rumor has it that Worldbreaker contained a supreme scripture containing an immortal fist dao. It was hidden in their library and guarded by wondrous cultivators.

They didn’t know who exactly the guards were because few made it out alive. Only a few exceptions were known.

One ancient historian confirmed that the duck egg buyer has entered the library before. There was concrete evidence for this claim.

Later on, another credible source stated that the mythical Duality Master has done so as well - the only person to be invited into Worldbreaker with complete freedom.

Now, Tian Tu has also read the immortal fist scripture and probably fought with Godfist as well.

Godfist was another legend - the only fist slave capable of leaving Worldbreaker. Though Tian Tu didn’t reveal any detail, they must have competed with the fist dao. The result was unknown but it seemed that Tian Tu definitely didn’t lose.

“Who won between the two of them?” An ancient ancestor wondered.

Many became curious about the outcome of this battle. Both of their fist dao originated from Worldbreaker. To be more exact, the immortal fist scripture. It must have been a magnificent contest. Unfortunately, the world didn’t have the luck to see it.

“This cannot be the limit of the fist dao.” Tian Tu said.

The crowd exchanged glances and thought that he was being rather domineering. Did he think he has reached the limit of this dao?

“Is that so?” Li Qiye smiled.

“It is from my own experience.” Tian Tu stared straight at Li Qiye: “However, I have heard about another fist technique.”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He took a deep breath and his dull eyes suddenly flashed with excitement: “A punch capable of sealing the high heaven.”

“A punch capable of sealing the high heaven?” Listeners repeated in astonishment.

The high heaven was the ultimate existence, the apex of the apex. After all, just the heavenly tribulations alone were unstoppable. Who would dare to seal the inscrutable high heaven itself?
