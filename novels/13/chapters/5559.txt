Chapter 5560: It Is My Blood

“What is this?” Bones was surprised to see the blood.

“Wait, you don’t know what it is? It grew on you.” Niu Fen had a strange expression while staring at Bones.

“Would have been easier if I knew what it was. It happened so quickly, this thing attached to me and started growing a heart and then flesh. I had no choice but to change back to my original form and run away to avoid troubling my fellow brothers.” Bones smiled wryly and shook his head.

So it turned out that the death aura reviving everything did indeed leak from Bones Dao Lord. This happened when he was forced to change back to his golden form.

“It’s my blood.” Li Qiye sighed and revealed.

“What?!” Niu Fen and Bones blurted out in disbelief.

“This is your blood, Young Master?” Niu Fen said: “That can’t be, your blood can’t have this evil aura, well, not quite evil, it’s the smell of blood. Hmm, not quite either, it’s something unprecedented.”

“That’s the issue, it’s not death or evil, it’s actually the aura of a weapon. Its master has been hungry for too long, for epochs, hence its aura.” Li Qiye said.

“Why did your blood appear here, Sacred Teacher? And why did it invade our tablet and region?” Bones couldn’t come up with an answer.

“It’s all from the same branch.” Li Qiye said: “Your tablet came from me as well, it originated from Desolate Wasteland and I refined it with my grand dao later.”

“I see, no wonder we felt a strong harmonization with the world during our research. That’s why we embedded this supreme grand dao to this land along with our true selves, culminating in this paradise.” Bones understood.

In the past, his group gathered here due to a particular tablet. They had no idea where it came from, only that it had a supreme grand dao capable of a special refinement. They did just that and used it as the foundation for Momentous Frontier.

They made the tough choice of becoming the deities and co-existing with their creation. As time passed, the land prospered and more temples were built. Their blessings became stronger and everything went well.

This was until recently when the tablet was suddenly attacked by a gray aura. It coiled around the target and wanted to infect the internal runes.

The deities naturally didn’t allow this to happen. Thus, all came to suppress the aura.

Given their power, they could have threatened all of the immortal continents. Alas, they couldn’t stop the infection.

A few runes were taken over, causing areas to lose their protection and blessings. Bones was different from the others due to his original form.

He was an easy target for the aura and it somehow created a heart in his ribcage. He had no choice but to leave everyone, hoping to deal with it himself.

Fortunately, his fleeing path alerted Li Qiye who was able to deal with the aura.

“This wasn’t here before.” He commented on the drop of blood.

“It’s because there’s something else in this region, you all just didn’t notice.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Impossible, we refined every inch of this land with Momentous Dao. I’m confident to say that there was nothing else due to our thorough effort.” Bones disagreed.

The development was flawless and repeated several times, removing all impurities so that their Momentous Dao could seep into the region. This built a perfect connection with the usage of temples and their worshippers.

“This thing is beyond your level.” Li Qiye said: “You wouldn’t have been able to detect it even after a considerable improvement in cultivation, it has to be willing.”

Niu Fen and Bones couldn’t believe it. The former normally made fun of Bones but still knew about the power of the group. The whole thing seemed inconceivable.

“Why does something so strong still want to hide?” Baifeng became curious.

“It got scared after a beating, its condition is not great either.” Li Qiye said.

“So it’s just a coincidence?” Niu Fen asked.

“Not quite, it most likely felt a connection with Momentous Dao.” Li Qiye looked at the drop of blood.

“Why did it show up now of all times?” Bones became curious.

“It is because all of you did such a good job, Momentous Frontier grows more prosperous along with its dao. It was probably exhausted but now, the dao fed it enough so it wants to take over the tablet.” Li Qiye said.

“What about your blood, Young Noble?” Baifeng asked innocently.

“Because it’s a weapon.” Li Qiye said.

Niu Fen and Bones understood the implication right away.

“It shouldn’t be here.” Niu Fen took a deep breath.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Yes, it fell into this world.” Li Qiye smiled.

“During the grand calamity.” Bones glanced at the sky.

“What a shame, I didn’t get anything good then.” Niu Fen lamented.

“How greedy, you should be grateful for just surviving the ordeal.” Bones coldly uttered.

“Please, unlike your crappy island that got obliterated, I was perfectly safe in a supreme secret realm. Hehe, if I wasn’t occupied with other important matters, I could have fetched a corpse.” Niu Fen said.

“Nonsense.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh before slapping the back of his head: “The current you can’t take a corpse, let alone your past self, little snail.”
