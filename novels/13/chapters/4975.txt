Chapter 4976: Smashed

Despite the fierce ambush, Li Qiye emerged unscathed, with only a few specks of dirt staining his robe. Nonchalantly, he brushed off the grime with a quick pat, unfazed by the feeble attempt to harm him.

Yunyun heaved a sigh of relief after seeing this.

Shadowrider, on the other hand, became serious. This capable assassin had killed numerous famous characters before, homing their intuition every time. Now, this felt rather ominous.

“Is this all the world-famous assassin can do?” Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said.

A terrible feeling gnawed at Shadowrider as they contemplated the situation. The earlier strike had felt just fine, and now even a five-fruit dragon lord would be finished. The assassin couldn't help but feel uneasy.

Now, it turned out that Li Qiye was completely untouched. Shadowrider naturally knew how sharp the strike was, and the same for the grim situation.

“Come, try again, do your best this time now.” Li Qiye smiled.

Yunyun was left speechless since the famous assassin was not taken seriously by a junior. Keep in mind that even dragon lords feared Shadowrider. Alas, Li Qiye was treating the assassin like a child.

This was a first for Shadowrider - being treated in such a trivial manner. Only one or two cultivators in the lower continents could act this way.

“Clank!” Shadowrider summoned a different weapon with their left hand, resembling a meteor hammer with spikes.

These spikes seemed sharp like needles in the night, always ready to pierce the heart. The night beast raised its hooves, looking like a roaring stallion.

Alas, there was no sound coming from this powerful dragon lord.

The beast’s roar didn’t make any sound but still released a mighty shockwave. At the same time, Shadowrider swung the hammer, wanting to reduce Li Qiye’s head to mincemeat.

The spikes also shot out with a speed ten times greater than lightning. Each aimed for a weak spot.

The entire process was soundless and virtually indiscernible, akin to a viper striking from the shadow.

This was enough to kill a dragon lord but it didn’t stop there. Shadowrider let go of the hammer and let momentum take over.

The assassin then appeared behind Li Qiye as if they had been there the entire time, undetected. Another spear thrust was the choice.

Shadowrider didn’t hold back at all, utilizing all of their strength and speed.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Ahh!” Jian Yunyun couldn’t follow the steps. The only thing she saw was a hammer hitting Li Qiye’s forehead while the spear was inches from his back.

This consisted of four separate points of attack - Shadowrider’s hammer and spear, the night beast’s stomp, and the needle-like spikes.

As Shadowrider launched the attack, confidence surged through the assassin's veins. Surely, this would be enough to injure even a six-fruit dragon lord. But then Li Qiye's casual voice cut through the air, sending chills down Shadowrider's spine: "Eh, not as bad this time."

The assassin's heart sank, realizing that their best efforts had been effortlessly brushed aside. It sounded like the voice of a devil to Shadowrider. This move had never failed to kill or cause serious injuries before until now.

Failing twice as an assassin was an utter disaster. Shadowrider didn’t waste any time and dispersed into smoke, desperately trying to escape. Their movement technique was flawless. Even the mightiest cultivators couldn't break the spell or catch up in time.

However, in the next blink of an eye, something akin to an invisible hand caught Shadowrider.

Illumination Empress Dowager had suffered the same fate - being smashed repeatedly, leaving deep holes in the ground and vomiting blood.

Jian Yunyun caught up and couldn't believe what she was seeing. The last time she had been captured by the empress dowager and didn't know it was Li Qiye who had intervened.

Now, even though she couldn't see Li Qiye, she knew it was him behind Shadowrider's defeat. The second-ranked member of the Ten Monsters looked helpless before Li Qiye, not worth a single coin.

Shadowrider couldn't believe it either. They had believed they could exchange numerous moves with Conceal Conqueror despite the power gap. Being proven weak like this was horrifying.
