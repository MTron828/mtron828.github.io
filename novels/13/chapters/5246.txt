Chapter 5247: Beat You All

“Who I am matters not.” Li Qiye stretched and said: “This is your last chance to scram before I make my move. It will be over then.”

Listeners couldn’t believe what they were hearing since he was talking to a mighty conqueror. Sure, some in the upper continents could kill Suppression Conqueror. However, it wouldn’t be effortlessly even for apex cultivators. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Destroying eleven dao fruits while leaving nothing behind was a difficult task since they were immensely tough. Perhaps only someone who had obtained an anima tree would be able to do so.

“That’s some confidence.” One guest snorted at the comment.

Suppression’s expression darkened. His foul mood manifested into murderous strands that could decapitate dragon lords, let alone regular cultivators.

Only masters such as Xiao Qingtian or Li Zhitian could withstand his aura. The other big shots trembled from the pressure.

His generals were infuriated. They had fought alongside the conqueror and took pride in his success. Insulting him was the same as insulting them. If gazes could kill, Li Qiye would have died a hundred times over.

“You must defeat us before you are qualified to compete with His Majesty.” One general uttered coldly.

The other generals stood up and the atmosphere became serious. Suppression had eight renowned generals - two saints and six gods.

The saints included Sanctified Bones and Heaven’s Equal Avian. They were ancient ancestors from Hundred Dao and martial brothers of Suppression Conqueror.

The six gods were famous as well, making a name for themselves via the battlefields.

“That’s fine, one at a time or all together?” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Boom!” A top dragon lord stood before Suppression Conqueror and spread his wings, releasing bright pulses.

“Get through us first or crawl back from whence you came.” He was a divine firebird who spoke with a sharp tone.

“Heaven’s Equal Avian!” Many took a deep breath after seeing the senior brother of Suppression.

He had eleven sacred fruits since long ago, being far older than his martial brothers.

It’s just that Suppression was too gifted and improved rapidly, surpassing his brothers in no time at all.

As for Sanctified Bones, he reached his limit and had to rely on the eighteen images to possess twelve sacred fruits. Talent-wise, he was not a match for Heaven’s Equal.

Heaven’s Equal was the second in command, dealing with mundane and administrative matters that Suppression didn’t care for.

“I’ll greet him first with my blae.” One general jumped forward and shouted at Li Qiye: “Brat, you think you can get through me?!”

He resembled a bug with a metal carapace and a gleaming blade-like horn. The external runes looked attuned to the dao.

“Skyhorn General!” Someone shouted, recognizing one of the six gods.

His horn had killed numerous mighty foes due to its tough and sharp characteristics. Weapons were always pierced, even sacred fruits.

“Brat, take out your weapon already.” He smacked his horn, issuing metallic clanks.

“Very well, seems like I must show you fools what a real weapon is.” Having said that, Li Qiye glanced at the middle of the hall where there were numerous seats meant for the wise sages of the past.

At the center was an oval item looking like a ship with a dark color, seemingly made from unknown materials.

Upon closer examination, one would discover that instead of being made up of metals, the exterior actually consisted of runic lines. Because they were seamlessly integrated together, the gaps between them couldn’t be seen at all.

Li Qiye reached for it and suddenly, the ship became bright with rays pulsing outward. It activated and flew closer, hovering above him.

“What is this?!” The audience became startled.

This included ancestors from Imperial Attendant as well. Suppression Conqueror himself didn’t know what was going on.

Outsiders assumed that it was a mere decorative piece for the main hall. However, those from Imperial Attendant knew that this was a supreme treasure, albeit inactive.

It was rumored to have a strong connection to the metal giants outside. Alas, not even City Lord Zi Yan and the other wise sages were able to use it.

The rays coming from it possessed a terrifying destructive capability. Suppression stared at it in awe.

Ever since he took over, he had researched the history of the city and its treasures.
