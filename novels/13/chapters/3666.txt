Chapter 3667: Stripped

Everyone found it hard to stay calm because Li Qiye had delivered several shocking blows in a short time.

First was the jade piece from the spring, then the opening of the wooden door. Lastly, he went as far as abandoning the treasury inside.

Others criticized his wasteful choice while still being astounded. After all, how many could have made the same choice?

“What about the princess?” They eventually calmed down and looked over at the princess. However, the princess and Zhang Yunzhi were nowhere to be found.

“Over there!” A sharp-eyed spectator noticed the two trying to secretly sneak away.

They didn’t utter a sound and retreated in a meticulous manner. Unfortunately, someone still spotted them.

“Go!” The two no longer cared about being spotted and leaped to the sky in order to fly away.

“They want to run!” A cultivator shouted. The rest of the crowd realized that these two were going to play dirty.

“This will ruin their clans’ prestige and reputation.” An expert from the last generation shook his head.

Of course, the two didn’t give a damn about that. Stripping naked in front of the crowd was humiliating and worse than death. Thus, they chose to run away.

In their opinion, they just needed to fly at their fastest speed and Li Qiye wouldn’t be able to catch them.

“Amitabha.” Untethered Monk started speaking: “Benefactors, a bet is a bet, you must not renege. It is time to carry out your end of the bargain.”

The two naturally didn’t listen. If they actually wanted to strip, they wouldn’t be sneaking away right now.

“Looks like you’re not showing me, the arbitrator, any respect.” The monk wasn’t angry but his voice was still imposing. He spread his palm and reached for the duo.

“Boom!” The two fell to the ground. They mustered all of their strength in order to fly again. Alas, this was futile. They looked like doves struggling to fly.

“Excuse me then.” The monk pressed his palm down.

“Boom!” The duo’s clothes were torn off and evaporated.

“Ahh!” They immediately became naked. Stealthing techniques weren’t effective either. The two of them naturally shouted in horror.

They started running again with everything they got to get the hell out of this place. The crowd saw a naked man and woman sprinting out of the square.

Some people became elated. One guy whistled and shouted: “I can see everything clearly!”

“Me too!” Another youth’s eyes brightened.

Commenters started voicing their opinion while the princess and Yunzhi wanted nothing more than to jump into a pit to hide from everyone.

“Li, I will never forgive you!” The princess gnashed her teeth in anger. Her voice was filled with hate and viciousness.

Everyone could tell that when given the opportunity, she would cut Li Qiye to pieces.

Li Qiye heard her and simply shrugged.

“Young Master, you are something else.” The crown prince came forward and praised. This result truly broadened his horizon.

He thought that Li Qiye was dead for sure but a miracle occurred instead. Now, he realized that the ancestor must have seen something in Li Qiye.

Li Qiye smiled and told Yang Ling: “Let’s go back.” He started walking away with Yang Ling right behind him.

“I want to try the spring again, ten chances!” Numerous cultivators became impatient and waved their money at the monk.

“Twenty for me, no, thirty!”

“I want fifty chances!”

People poured towards the entrance, wanting to be the first instead of lagging behind.

A while ago, they viewed this as a waste of money. Li Qiye’s success changed everything. It was possible to find items in the spring.

Most importantly, Li Qiye didn’t take the treasury in the wooden house. Everyone still coveted the things inside.

“Amitabha, no rush, no rush, Benefactors. Everyone will have a chance.” The monk was elated to see the pile of chaos stones and coins in front of him. He sold more than ten times the ticket as before.

The square became filled with cultivators once more. Some worked on the spring while others focused on the door.

“Woof! Woof! Woof!” The strangest thing occurred. People started barking repeatedly, whether it be the old masters or young geniuses. Even the girls were barking. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

An unknown passerby would think that the square had hundreds of dogs inside.

Alas, copying Li Qiye didn’t work. Their throat became sore before anything happened to the wooden door.

“Why isn’t it opening?” They simply didn’t understand. The door opened for Li Qiye when he barked. Yet, they have done so thousands of times so far to no avail.

“You did it wrong.” One senior told his young disciple: “Li Qiye’s barks had a peculiar rhythm. I remember it very well, he went like this, woof, woof, woof-”

“That’s not completely right. I remember that his hands were touching his stomach and I clearly felt a power ripple. He must have channeled dao power from his dantian to his voice - a sonic attack against the door.” Another senior started touching his stomach with both hands.

“Still incorrect.” One more senior said: “I saw his location clearly, one meter and half an inch away from the door. He must have paid particular attention to this spot, perhaps it is the seal location...”

Discussions popped up in just a short time. People disagreed on how to bark - the rhythm and volume; the action and stance; the strength utilized...

All in all, the barks became varied and continuous. This lasted several days and newcomers thought that Wish Ward had become a city of dogs.

As for Untethered Monk, his coffer was filled with money by this point. Moreover, Li Qiye became the best advertisement.

People from the four oceans heard about it and came running. They wanted to be the next fateful person to obtain everlasting wealth.

Sadly, none found success regardless of their effort and method.

The monk stuck around the square with a smile on his face and kept on chanting: “Amitabha, Merciful Buddha.”

He naturally didn’t believe this barking nonsense. He knew that it was just bullshit. Li Qiye was able to open the door because he understood the innate profundities. It had nothing to do with the barks.

Nonetheless, he wouldn’t tell the truth because he was profiting from this nonsense. In fact, he vigorously propagated the story of Li Qiye’s barks.
