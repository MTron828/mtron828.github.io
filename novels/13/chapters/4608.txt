Chapter 4609: Puresword

The Improper Four listened and understood why Five-sun King wasn’t recognized by Li Qiye.

One must avenge their father’s death. Moreover, Five-sun King’s father did everything he could for the sake of his son’s future.

Now, the son actually tried to team up with his father’s killer for the same of his ambition, going as far as wanting to become sworn brothers. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

How inhuman was this? “Vicious and greedy” was putting it lightly.

His followers only focused on his good qualities and ignored the other implications, whether purposely or otherwise. In this case, they would praise him as being forgiven and magnanimous instead of being a sociopath.

“This brat is something else though, actually going as far as sacrificing his own women and not avenging his father. He’s merciless to himself and will be merciless to others. That’s why he’s so successful at being a hegemon.” Jian Ming commented.

“But not a dao lord.” The daoist said: “The dao lords are always clear on their stance, whether it be love or hatred. They will pay back a favor owed and dish out revenge when it is deserved.”

“Regardless of that, this brat is capable indeed to become the voice of the east in such a short time.” Though Jian Ming didn’t like Five-sun King, he had to admit that the guy was absolutely charismatic.

“Becoming a hegemon and becoming a dao lord are two different matters.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “The former is fleeting and meaningless in the grand scheme of things while a dao lord is recorded in the historical annals.”

The duo couldn’t disagree with this. There had been plenty of hegemons in the past, being praised as the lords of Eight Desolaces. However, most have been forgotten.

As for dao lords, it didn’t matter what they did. They could be alone or start a sect. They could lay low or exert their authority. Either way, in the long future, their brilliance and tales still wouldn’t be forgotten. This was one of the reasons why so many wanted to become a dao lord.

“Young Noble, among the five conquerors, who do you think is most likely to become a dao lord?” Puresword couldn’t contain his curiosity.

“Oh? Sounds like you want to give it a shot too.” Jian Ming stared at him and said: “Why not join the competition. Henceforth, it will be the six conquerors of Sky Border, not just five.”

Though Jian Ming liked teasing Puresword and the Improper Four, he could tell that Puresword was immensely strong. Though he only saw Puresword in action once and this might not be his real limit, this was rather apparent. The other members were mighty as well.

“Please don’t joke like that.” Puresword smilingly shook his head: “I am only an idle youth with no ambition. How can I become a dao lord? The best I can do is selling wine to get through the days.”

“Your clan has not produced a dao lord for a long time.” Li Qiye smirked.

Puresword shuddered because this once confirmed Li Qiye’s knowledge of his background.

“I do not dare to comment on the seniors’ matter.” Puresword calmed down and responded.

“That doesn’t matter, this is you we are talking about. You can think about becoming a dao lord.” Li Qiye said.

“Well…” Puresword hesitated.

A’han, Xiao Yan, and Woodman stared at him. Among the four, he was certainly the most talented with the most potential. Furthermore, his origin was also the best.

“My cultivation is shallow and my comprehension is slow, I am not qualified.” Puresword shook his head.

“Your Diamond Evil-subduing Fist is only a front to trick others. Your sword art is rather usable.” Li Qiye smiled and said, shocking Puresword.

He only used this first technique against others and rarely met a worthy opponent. Only a selected few knew that his sword mastery was even superior.

Despite him never using it before in public, Li Qiye still knew about it. The other three were shocked as well since they knew this secret. They only saw it a few times and didn’t have a good grasp of its true power.

“It’s just child’s play.” Puresword bowed slightly, not daring to be complacent.

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t dwell on the issue.

“Young Noble, may I ask if our brother has a chance of becoming the next dao lord?” A’han became curious as well.

“I don’t want to since I will not be competitive on this path.” Puresword smiled wryly and shook his head.

Li Qiye stared at him and said: “Go all out and compete, your chance of success is greater than Five-sun King’s.”

“Damn!” Jian Ming’s eyes lit up.

Ye Tingrong and Paramount Scion were astonished as well. They knew nothing about Puresword and his origin.

However, they saw the king’s attitude and knew that the Improper Four came from prestigious backgrounds.

Currently, everyone knew that the five conquerors had the best chance. This wasn’t to say that others were doomed to failure.

When talking about Five-sun King alone, he had a prestigious bloodline and amazing talents. However, Li Qiye said that Puresword had a higher probability of success. This was truly shocking because Puresword was completely unknown.

Nonetheless, they didn’t doubt Li Qiye’s assessment. It seemed that this youth was indeed qualified to compete for the dao lord position.

“You’re too kind, Young Noble.” Puresword smiled wryly and said: “A nobody such as myself can’t compete with a master like Five-sun King.”

“Is that so?” Li Qiye smirked: “Go back home and ask your ancestors, see how many supporters you can pull if you intend on competing for the dao lord position. Let’s test your clan’s influence.”

“Mmm…” Puresword didn’t respond.

The others took a deep breath afterward. Li Qiye implied that Puresword could also garner numerous supporters. He must be from a clan with peerless might and foundation.

Paramount Scion thought about the various ancient clans, hoping to find an answer.

“If you wish to compete, we will support you.” A’han smiled.

The four of them came from different lineages. Nonetheless, these lineages have been close friends for eras now.
