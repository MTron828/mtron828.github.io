Chapter 3535: Instruction

“Ancestor...” The young ancestor prostrated and begged: “Please reconsider for the sake of the sect.” He then smashed his head onto the ground, aware of the great blow to the sect in the absence of their sovereign.

“No need to say more, I have made up my mind.” The sovereign waved his hand.

“If one day, Yin Yang Zen Gate is in danger...” The ancestor knew that further persuasion was futile, only hoping that his ancestor would care about old ties.

“Invite troubles? Deal with them.” The sovereign flatly said.

“But... what if the sect goes down...” The ancestor didn’t expect this answer.

“So be it.” The sovereign had made up his mind and said: “Countless sects have gone down in history. What’s one more?”

“Ancestor!” The ancestor shouted but the sovereign was already walking out toward an unknown destination.

From then on, no one ever saw Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yan again.

Li Qiye looked down at Ancestral City from a high pavilion reaching the clouds. Everything else seemed tiny like insects.

He didn’t say a thing while Dragon King Commander and the others remained quiet.

After a while, he sat down with a natural expression, staring at the group. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Years went by in the blink of an eye but I still remember everything clearly.” The commander sobbed.

He used to be the four-eyed basilisk back then and enjoyed his youth - one worthy of remembrance.

Today, he stood at the top and looked back at the past. It would never come back.

“Indeed. I remember how you ran for your life while being chased by your sister.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Please don’t make fun of me, I only cared about playing around then and didn’t sympathize with her good intention.” The basilisk smiled and felt warmth: “It’s a shame she’s no longer here.”

Venerable Basilisk was also a top genius in that era. She lived quite long and left her clan to start Dragon Phoenix Valley. Alas, her power wasn’t enough to withstand the withering of time.

“I wouldn’t mind being chased around by her right now.” The basilisk’s expression became sad.

He had experienced numerous years and goodbyes. However, this particular memory still overwhelmed him with emotions.

“That’s time, there’s no going back after it passed.” Li Qiye said.

The basilisk nodded and took a deep breath. He stared at Li Qiye and said: “Look at how old I am now compared to you, Boss.”

“I’m always eighteen.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“I also want to be eighteen every year but I don’t have your dao heart. That’s the difference between us.” The basilisk said.

Of course, “old” here wasn’t about physical appearance. At their power level, they could always reshape their body at any moment. However, his dao heart was the thing that was old in this case.

“I’ve been growing bored recently, the grand dao is too long and lonely. Maybe resting in peace is better. On the other hand, you’re still moving forward in a heroic fashion, that’s why we can’t compare to you. Our dao heart probably would shatter if we experience the same things as you.” He went on to say.

“I’ll always be invincible regardless of the long path.” Li Qiye said: “There must always be a pursuit in life. A fish still wants to turn over, an insect still wants to bare its fangs at the high heaven. That’s what I want to do.”

“Your pursuit is beyond my imagination. If you’re a fish or an insect, then everyone else in the world is inferior to these things.” The basilisk said.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t respond.

Shi Qingjian and Ye Lingyao didn’t join the conversation since they haven’t reached the right level yet.

“Your clan’s girl is not bad.” Li Qiye glanced at Ye Lingyao and smiled.

“Not too stupid.” The basilisk said: “She was scared by you and immediately reported it to me. In the beginning, I thought someone had the audacity to pretend to be you.”

Ye Lingyao smiled wryly, recalling the first meeting with Li Qiye. That was truly a frightening experience.

She found him to be too arrogant and careless. It was a good thing that she didn’t try anything disrespectful because not even her ancestor would be able to save her.

“Good talents, same with her bloodline, boundless potential.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly.

“What are you waiting for? Thank Boss for praising you.” The basilisk had a happy expression and told Yaoling.

She came forward and bowed towards Li Qiye.

“Your next line is, please grant your junior a fortune?” Li Qiye glanced at the basilisk.

“Haha, Boss, you’re the lord of the world, bestowing one fortune or two isn’t a problem. Plus, you’re always generous to smart juniors.” The basilisk laughed.

“Very well, your bloodline is special enough. I have a phoenix art here, perfect for this occasion.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“A divine gift.” The basilisk was excited for his junior and said: “Peerless indeed, thank Boss again.”

“Thank you, Young Master.’ Ye Yaoling got on her knees, as moved as can be.

Being taught by her ancestor was already incredible enough. In reality, very few members in the clan have been this lucky for millions of years.

Today, she got something even greater - a gift from an existence treated with reverence by her ancestor. This would exceed anything else.

Once she stood up, Li Qiye raised his finger and metallic clanks could be heard. A dao law emerged along with a phoenix screech. A light flashed once before disappearing.

This dao law has entered her mind. Numerous runes and characters appeared within.

“Poof!” A phoenix trueflame oozed from her body.

She became ecstatic but didn’t forget to bow again. This supreme art was enough; she didn’t need anything more in life.

Shi Qingjian was envious but didn’t dare to ask Li Qiye.

“Since you have followed me recently, I do have something to give you. This is a garment made from phoenix feathers.” Li Qiye noticed this and said.

He took out a garment burning with phoenix flames. Hymns and visual phenomena of other birds bowing to a phoenix manifested.

Li Qiye personally created this garment after obtaining the feathers.

“Thank you, Young Master.” The emotional Shi Qingjian continuously kowtowed after seeing the present.

Li Qiye sat there and accepted the gesture while glancing towards the horizon.

“You want to leave already, Boss?” The basilisk said. He spent enough time with Li Qiye back then to understand his expressions.

“Hmm, I’ll be taking a look at the abandoned land, have to figure it out.” Li Qiye nodded.

“That place used to be the Buddhist ground, it’s all ashes now. Too many things happened and the world shattered. I didn’t pay enough attention to see what happened. I came to take a look later but that place was bizarre and inscrutable.” The basilisk said.

“A few things will always surprise.” Li Qiye smiled: “Heaven is omnipotent, or so they say. However, in this case, the villainous heaven couldn’t get everything right.”

“When will you ascend, Boss?” The basilisk pondered for a bit before asking.
