Chapter 5729: Outcome

Survivors of Dao Domain were scared out of their mind and could only watch the terrifying shockwaves from the implosions. They could sweep through the land, leaving nothing behind in their wake.

In this split second, Li Qiye placed his palms together, forming a cosmo within. When people looked at it, they could see the images from the start of the world. Galaxies and stars could be born in the blink of an eye. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He could also reverse the entire process, preventing an explosion capable of splitting primal chaos regardless of its power.

“Boom!” All affinities reversed from his palms pressing together.

The implosions stabilized and the chaos flowed normally; nothing was imbalanced enough to warrant destruction.

This naturally shocked all survivors. He somehow managed to stop the eruption of countless suns. The outgoing shockwaves receded like the tides.

“Bam!” Luminous and West Bank smashed against the ground, digging two deep pits.

Their dao and vitality were fully suppressed. The backlash from the failed implosion caused them to profusely vomit blood.

“How ambitious, wanting to drag Dao City down with you.” Li Qiye had a chilling glare.

“Bastards!” Survivors started cursing after regaining their wits, unable to contain their rage.

Those two wanted to drag everything down with them, not showing a sliver of remorse.

“Sacred Teacher, please kill them!” An ancestor roared.

“They deserve death by a thousand cuts, that’s the only way to appease the hatred in our hearts and the resentment of the deceased!” A member of West Bank shouted.

They wanted to devour the duo’s flesh and drink their blood - a stark contrast to the reverence in the past.

Once upon a time, just uttering the titles of Luminous and West Bank Prime Emperor instilled a sincere sense of respect. They had enough prestige to command everyone in Dao Domain for they had won the hearts of the people.

“Was it not enough to sacrifice everyone to Celestial Court?!” A West Bank ancestor screamed.

“My conqueror spilled her last drop of blood because of you! She didn’t deserve such a tragic fate!” Another shouted.

“How dare you try to bury everyone with you!? You’re no conqueror! This is why you weren’t chosen by Immortal Dao City!” Someone else shouted.

Just when they thought their hatred couldn’t be any higher, the duo proved them wrong with this final act.

The duo cared not regarding their infamy and only stared at Li Qiye - the only one capable of delivering the verdict against them, not those ants.

“It is time to return what you have taken.” Li Qiye said emotionlessly.

The two turned pale and gave up on resisting. No one could save them now.

“Do it.” They arched their chest and displayed the unyielding courage of conquerors.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye shot a beam at West Bank Prime Emperor’s head.

“Ahh!” The latter screamed in response as power was drained from him, seemingly reducing him to a mortal.

It pinned him to the ground and instilled untold suffering. He could have endured this if he still had his cultivation but without it, the agony was unbearable.

His screams echoed across Dao City. Everyone could imagine the sheer horror of the experience.

“Crack!” Sounds resembling bones breaking could be heard but this was not the case. Beams of light grew like branches and pierced his body.
