Chapter 4583: Bloodline

“What am I then?” She asked while staring intensely at him.

“You’ve regained youth and reverted back into a child.” It took him a moment before deciding to tell her the truth.

“Youth reversion? Is it because of my cultivation and grand dao attainment or something else?” She became curious.

“Not because of those but rather, your bloodline.” He smiled and said: “Of course, your profound cultivation allows your bloodline to activate. But, this wouldn’t have been possible without the bloodline even if you had reached the apex of cultivation.”

“My bloodline.” She said: “Hmm, I seem to be a human but not quite.” She didn’t have an impression of her race and background.

“Strictly speaking, you’re not a human.” Li Qiye shook his head: “But your bloodline and race aren’t deeply related. It’s not that you need to be a particular race to possess this bloodline.”

“What kind of bloodline it is?” She had no impression of this bloodline. Perhaps it was hidden in a deep corner in her memories.

“It came from an ancient age, deep under the sea.” Li Qiye said: “You yourself didn’t know of its origin, no one else did either.”

“An aquatic bloodline?” She murmured. Something suddenly flashed in her mind and she saw numerous majestic figures.

They looked rather unique - neither demons nor humans. Their size was gasp-worthy. They looked ancient, never needing to evolve since they were already perfect. This image only lasted for a moment and she couldn’t grasp any important point.

“Is this race still around?” She then asked.

“Your race, yes, but your actual bloodline branch? I’m afraid it is no longer around. It was already rare back in the ancient era, it is probably extinct now.” He said.

“I see, extinct.” She had a strange feeling after hearing this. She was already alone; now even her bloodline was gone. This left her in silence.

“Rest well.” Li Qiye said: “Your dao heart is firm but since you have just awakened, you are still unsettled. Your true self will return with ample time.” Having said that, he turned and left.

She called for him and asked: “If you have a choice to redo, would you preserve your lifespan instead?”

“I don’t know.” He answered without looking back.

“Why?”

“There are trillions of mortals in the world but they’re all insects. There is no need to add another insect in me.” He spoke his mind and then left.

“No need for another insect.” She murmured and started contemplating about her life if she didn’t embark on this path.

Both mortals and cultivators would eventually face the end of life. For a noble like her, she would enjoy all the luxuries and wealth available. Her last moment would be one surrounded by loved ones.

Such a life seemed more than enough - the ultimate pursuit for countless mortals. Alas, this didn’t stand out in the river of time.

As for her, she had the privilege of obtaining something unique - gaining her youth again. How many others had such fortune? Though she was alone now, did she regret her choice?

Li Qiye mentioned that he didn’t want to be another insect since there were too many already.

After a while, she smiled and flipped her hair back, looking more at ease than previously.

She stayed at the four clans for a short period until one day, she said: “I’m leaving.”

“Where to?” Jian Ming became curious.

“I’m not sure, just a place in my memory that I’m sure is very important since it has something of use.”

The group exchanged glances. In the last several days, they have witnessed her terrifying power. Thus, an important item to her must be incredible.

“What is it?” The daoist couldn’t help but ask.

“It’s just a feeling that the item hidden there is what I want.” She stroked her chin, a gesture out of place for a girl her age.

“It might not be there since it has been too long.” Jian Ming said.

Xiao Xuan has been sealed in the amber for who knows how many years? Perhaps that item was no longer there.

“If it is still in your memory, I’m sure that you have prepared for this day and it’ll be safe from anyone grabbing it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“True.” The others agreed.

During her prime, she must have been wise and predicted the future. An ace card prepared by her would have been under powerful defensive seals.

“Where is this place?” Jian Ming asked.

She scratched her head in response, looking annoyed: “I don’t know the name or the location.”

“Uhh…” Jian Ming didn’t know how to respond. It seemed impossible to find the place then.

Of course, the name wouldn’t be the same anyway. Major geographical shifts could have occurred as well.

“Is there anything unique about it? We can start from there.” The daoist asked.

“Hmm, yes, there is.” She stroked her chin and took her time thinking.

After a long while, she blurted: “There is a fist!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“A fist?” The daoist repeated.

Suddenly, he thought of something and shouted: “Worldbreaker Fist!”

“I have no impression of this name.” She shook her head.
