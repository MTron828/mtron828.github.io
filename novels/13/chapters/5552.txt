Chapter 5553: Zombie

One statue was entirely black and depicted a young man with blurry features, looking rather enigmatic. The second statue was more realistic but more frightening. It wore a black robe embroidered with white threads in the image of a skeleton.

However, despite their appearance, the mortals still revered them due to their health blessings. Their temples and shrines never lacked offerings and incense sticks.

“Why did the geezers pick such scary statues? Should have made them more normal.” Niu Fen said.

He recognized them - Immortal Emperor Bu Si and Bones Dao Lord. They chose to share the same deity spot after forming Momentous Frontier - something rather unexpected. [1]

“No reunion without an old grudge.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Right, rumor has it that they were mortal enemies back then.” Niu Fen chuckled.

“The deities aren’t fellow sect members?” Baifeng was surprised to hear this since she had access to some of the deities’ history.

“Sect members? They tried to kill each other upon sight.” Niu Fen laughed.

“It’s just a feud.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “In a sense, they do have the same origin so it’s not completely wrong to consider them as fellow sect members. From the look of this, it seems like they have made up.”

“I suppose feuds don’t matter when they have died several times after fighting each other.” Niu Fen shrugged and said: “Bones got killed back in Eight Desolaces too and still crawled back out.”

Baifeng didn’t know anything about this legend since she didn’t come from Eight Desolaces. According to the tales, Bones Dao Lord was considered unkillable - always capable of getting up.

However, he eventually came across a ferocious cultivator - Thirteenth. This swordsman’s ultimate slash was monstrous and managed to kill Bones. Of course, Bones still survived and perfected his merit law - Golden Cycle of Death. Future generations didn’t know about his survival and ascension to the six continents.

After learning about the past, Baifeng commented on something else: “The medicine horse is missing.”

There was an empty space near the two statues. There should have been a horse there - a symbol just like the divine stalk.

“There’s no divinity to the statues either.” Niu Fen shook his head.

“This isn’t the reason for the plague and illness.” Li Qiye said: “Mortals don’t get sick just by not having protection.”

“Right, there’s interference again.” Baifeng said.

Mortals in Momentous Frontier could live to a hundred without suffering serious illness due to the deities’ protection. Mortals in the outside world still lived relatively well, not suffering in agony constantly.

There must be something malicious and evil going on. Alas, this was beyond Baifeng’s ability.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Buzz.” Li Qiye raised his hand and illuminated the empty area, revealing a gray aura.

The others recognized it - the same culprit as before.

Li Qiye instantly pinched the aura with two fingers and immobilized it. It seemed to be screaming ferociously, attempting to break free.

“This thing again?” Not to mention Baifeng, even Niu Fen didn’t fully understand the gray aura. It didn’t seem like a force of darkness or evil. Niu Fen only knew that it didn’t belong to this world.

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye examined it and said: “It’s undergoing metamorphosis.”

After he finished pulling all of the aura near the statues, it released a slash out of nowhere, wanting to kill him.

He raised his hand, easily nullifying the energy slash before burning the remnant aura to ashes.

“In theory, mortals shouldn’t be able to endure having this thing inside them.” Li Qiye shook his head and said.

“Young Noble, are you saying that this is the thing causing the widespread plague?” Baifeng’s expression soured.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye said.

“So like a parasite?” She asked.

“Not quite, they’re just scattered powers that attach to living beings.” Li Qiye said.

“Scattered power? What if the source actually tries to invade actively?” Niu Fen became serious.

“You can’t contend with it either, looks like the deities of Momentous Dao are being suppressed by the metamorphosis.” Li Qiye said.

“So what should we do, Young Noble?” Baifeng became nervous: “Will everyone in the city die? And if this power continues to disperse, Momentous Dao will fall next.”

“They might become something like puppets?” Li Qiye said.

“Or zombies, right?” Niu Fen said.

“Pretty much, a transformation between Momentous Dao and this force.” Li Qiye said.

“What a strange thing…” Niu Fen murmured.

“Please save us, Young Noble.” Baifeng prostrated, aware that Li Qiye might be the only one capable of stopping this unknown force.
