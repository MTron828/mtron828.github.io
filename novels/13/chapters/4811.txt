Chapter 4812: Dead Immortal

The special wheel brought the two lords back to their epoch.

“Boom!” He immediately channeled his endless energy and summoned an armor made of dao light. 

Just the pulsing waves alone from the armor could kill emperors and dao lords in the blink of an eye. Time, space, and laws making up the epoch were instantly crushed. Only black holes were left behind.

Triune Epoch was far in the past compared to the modern era. However, cultivators could still feel his erupting power. The shockwaves piercing through time itself scared the living hell out of them.

“This is the power of a supreme overlord in his prime, not suffering any suppression. It’s magnificent.” An ancient ancestor trembled in fear.

“This collapsed timeline can’t trap me!” The alligator lord started devouring everything.

Although the epoch had nothing left - no lifeforms nad worldly veins, there were still stars and celestials. It seemed that he was correct - this wheel wouldn’t be able to stop him for long.

“Buzz.” Triune Immortal’s transcendent radiance pulsed brightly and created temporal ripples. She herself chose to join the reversal passage and went back to her epoch.

“Boom!” She immediately attacked her mortal adversary with a palm strike.

“Come, I’ve eaten Treant here, you are next! When the triune is united, I shall become a true immortal!” He was not afraid at all and shot out a devastating beam from his mouth.

The two didn’t hold back and continued their eternal contest. The subsequent explosions created primordial chaos and lightning bolts.

“That’s fortunate.” Someone back in Eight Desolaces heaved a sigh of relief. At least the two chose to fight in a different spatio-temporal sphere. Otherwise, their epoch would either be destroyed or swallowed up by the alligator lord.

Everyone started praying for Triune Immortal’s victory. Of course, a few overlords took it one step further - hoping that both sides would die.

After all, these were two overlords at their prime. Their flesh and blood were the finest resources in existence.

“Buzz.” As everyone paid attention to the shockwaves emanating from the fight, Gu Yin from Immortal Lake was preoccupied with something else.

The coffin lid opened and revealed a complete portal with silver ripples. Once the ripples stabilized, a particular being walked out into Eight Desolaces.

No one has seen anything like it before. It didn’t have a head, limbs, or even a body. It looked like a blob of mercury around the size of an adult. [1]

It had a pair of wings made out of holy light that was often seen on angels. It also had a halo above its head. The rays coming from it could purify the entire world.

“Do you see that?” Those nearby finally took note because they have been paying attention to the coffin from Immortal Lake.

“Dead Immortal.” A supreme overlord also noticed this and murmured.

“Th-the lord of Immortal Lake!” A divine monarch from an ancient clan shouted in astonishment. He has never seen this being in person but had read information written down by the clan’s progenitor who had visited the lake before.

This garnered everyone’s attention and astounded them. They have heard the legends regarding the ancient lineages of Desolate Wild. 

Back during the calamity, a corpse fell from heaven and destroyed a burial ground - a testament to its monstrosity. However, Immortal Lake still managed to obtain it.

“That’s Dead Immortal?” The appearance of this being took everyone by surprise.

They assumed that true to the title, it would look like a dead immortal, possessing either the death affinity or strands of immortal aura. In this case, this being looked out of this world.

“What is this race?” An ancestor wondered.

Strangely enough, Dead Immortal didn’t do anything yet. This was a stark contrast to Triune Alligator Lord who came with a bang.

If it wasn’t for people recognizing it, no one would have made a connection between it and Immortal Lake. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Only the overlords understood the significance of its arrival. This was an epoch lord that should absolutely be stronger than Triune Alligator Lord when comparing prime to prime. Alas, it had suffered a tribulation and suppression from the high heaven, no longer possessing the same dominance during the current epoch.
