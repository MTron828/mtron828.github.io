Chapter 5377: End Her Life Now

At this time, Ye Fantian’s spring of life watered the ancient runes. The pillar of life added numerous dao layers and the tree scattered life rays, granting them life and spirituality. The cauldron of life utilized its life flames to refine the runes repeatedly.

“Rumble!” Her grand dao surged toward the runes like soaring dragons next.

“She’s doing it!” Everyone could see how smooth the process was and understood that success was imminent.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a dozen figures or so descended from the sky. Their leader was none other than Myriad Eye Dao Lord.

The group consisted of three or so conquerors, the rest were dragon lords with eleven or twelve dao fruits.

“Myriad Eye Dao Lord and Dao Alliance.” Spectators understood their goal.

“Young Lady, I’m afraid we will have to interrupt your dao session.” Myriad Eye Dao Lord had nothing but respect for her after seeing her success.

Her determination and talent put them all to shame. They were famous geniuses in the past but never managed to reach her height.

Nonetheless, The People couldn’t allow the existence of such a powerful conqueror. Her power would absolutely overwhelm them.

Just Immortal Pagoda Conqueror alone was difficult enough so if The Race were to have someone as strong as Light-dragon Conqueror, it would be over for them.

As long as they could stop her from obtaining twelve fruits, they would be able to leave behind a dao injury. She would never become as strong as Light-dragon or Demon Conqueror then.

None on either side was surprised to see their interference or held them in contempt. After all, The Race would have done the same thing - the best example being Luminous Conqueror who was nearly killed by Deity Dao.

“Don’t even think about it.” A different group of mighty cultivators appeared.

Solar flames oozed outward from their leader - Five-sun Dao Lord who was leading top cultivators from Divine Alliance.

As a supreme genius of Divine Alliance, Ye Fantian naturally had dao protectors who wanted nothing more than to see her become an apex conqueror.

Ye Fantian took note of this and focused on changing the runes into dao fruits.

“Must be nice. She got helpers so even if the sky falls down, they will uphold it.” Ferocity said with jealousy.

As a dragon lord, he had experienced something like this as well. Of course, he only had a few close friends and no actual dao protectors of the conqueror level.

Li Xian’er sighed as well, also feeling envious of Ye Fantian’s prestigious background. She was a vagrant cultivator and had no one to protect her in the past.

Of course, Divine Alliance’s arrival was expected. Who wouldn’t want to have another apex conqueror on their side?

“Very well, old friends.” Myriad Eye Dao Lord readied himself for battle: “Let’s see if you can stop us!”

“Boom!” Having said that, he opened all of his eyes and unleashed a beam at Ye Fantian. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Enough!” Five-sun Dao Lord sent his unending solar flames in front of Ye Fantian, creating an uncrossable fiery expanse.

“Boom!” The beam caused the expanse to blow up chaotically, surging up to the sky.

“Go!” The members of Dao Alliance summoned their weapons with only one target in mind - Ye Fantian. They must either stop her cultivation improvement or kill her.

“You’re not getting through us!” Those from Divine Alliance also gathered their power and activated their dao, joining the skirmish.
