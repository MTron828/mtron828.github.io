Chapter 5407: Sealed

The rays subjected spectators to a feeling of despair. Toughness and speed were of no use.

“Boom!” Sure enough, the incoming planetary meteors were pierced by the chain.

It traversed through space and immediately sealed Seven-star Conqueror. He employed numerous evasive maneuvers, becoming fast enough to turn into numerous shadows.

No one could tell which image was the real conqueror. They started running into separate dimensions as well. Wasting a second to determine the real one meant being too slow.

Of course, this didn’t apply to Immortal Piercer.

“Pluff!” Blood splashed into space and stained some of the rocks nearby.

Time came to a halt and everyone saw a clear image of the conqueror’s chest being pierced by the chain. He bellowed in pain as it coiled around him for a complete seal. The other images disappeared from sight, leaving behind only the real body.

He didn’t give up and derived the mysteries of the dao. Alas, even his true fate and dao fruits have been sealed.

If it was just the body alone, a conqueror could still escape by abandoning the mortal shell. In this case, his fate was no longer up to him.

“So this is Immortal Piercer.” Spectators became emotional.

Hearing about the treasure versus seeing it in action were two different matters. Dragon lords and conquerors put themselves in Seven-star’s position and came to the same depressing conclusion - they would have no chance of escaping. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The sheer power and effectiveness of the chain also made them feel as if their chest was being pierced as well.

“Bam!” Li Xian’er started dragging Seven-star through space and smashed him onto a large floating continent. He looked like a captured dog, unable to put up a fight.

This was a worse fate than death for those who cared about their reputation. Seven-star matched this description.

“Boom!” Suddenly, auroras and celestial shimmers were blown away.

A portal opened in the air and released chaos true energy. They condensed to form a primordial light brimming with strength.

A pagoda came out of the portal; its laws could suppress the nine firmaments and all gods. Spectators found themselves as insignificant as insects before the arrival of what seems to be an immortal.

This aura far exceeded other conquerors and dao lords. Although they had dao fruits and an incredible aura, the pagoda simply took it to the next level. It possessed an innate quality while they had to earn theirs through cultivation - a fundamental difference and an insurmountable gap.

Thus, cultivators felt the urge to kneel before the pagoda’s superior presence.

“Immortal Pagoda Conqueror!” Everyone knew who it was right away - an apex conqueror possessing an inborn primordial dao fruit.

His special dao fruit made others think that he was above the likes of All-things Dao Lord and Supreme. It was comparable to Eternal Conqueror’s special bloodline - a true force to be reckoned with.

Rumor has it that the only thing that could stop his pagoda was Calamity Dao Lord’s carapace. Alas, the latter was trapped inside the bronze gate. Who could ever hope to stop the pagoda now?
