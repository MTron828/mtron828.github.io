The ten Vajras were mere dispersing clouds and falling leaves while Li Qiye was a violent gale. Just one blast and nothing would be left.

People didn’t see how Li Qiye did it, only the Vajras falling and breaking holes on the hills and grounds.

The area became quiet. The spectators were speechless as they looked up at Li Qiye with admiration. Nevertheless, fear and disbelief also permeated the area due to the devastation and blood.

The ten Vajras were top dogs in Imperial Lineage so their swift defeat took the crowd like a storm.

“Pinch me real fast so I know I’m not dreaming.” One expert regained his wits and asked.

“Ah!” He screamed from the pain after his friend didn’t hold back. He realized that this was indeed happening and blurted: “I can’t believe it, how could someone be so strong? He took care of the Vajras like taking out the trash.”

In fact, even the ancestors were frightened by this scene.

“They wouldn’t have lost so badly if they didn’t underestimate their enemy.” One old ancestor said.

“Regardless of that, to be able to take these Eternals down so fast indicates his superiority.” One expert took a deep breath.

This feat required massive power - one rarely attained by the beings in all of Imperial.

“Another master after the two recent emperors. He shouldn’t be inferior to Jade-break and Puresword at all.” A powerful ancestor nodded approvingly. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Wait a bit and see, ‘Buddhist Palm Scripture’ is the strongest technique from the ten. If he can block it, then he’ll prove himself to be just as strong as the emperors.” An ancestor from another clan said.

“This arrogant brat came out of nowhere but has the power of a young emperor, a perform storm of trouble for those who provoke him. It’s a good thing we’re not one of them.” A member of the group said while looking at Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” Explosions detonated with debris flying everywhere. Figures started jumping out of the pits.

The Vajras survived, albeit with serious wounds. However, experts of their level could fight until the very last breath.

They soared to the sky once more and surrounded Li Qiye. They still had an oppressive aura and the toughness of a mountain. Alas, the previous confidence and prestige were no longer there due to their bloodied and tattered appearance.

They glared angrily at him with murderous glint. They have once swept through the realms in an unstoppable manner. Numerous cultivators were intimidated after hearing their title but now, Li Qiye has done a number on their reputation.

They needed to kill him now in order to firmly reestablish their prestige in Imperial.

“Brat, you’re quite talented but we haven’t shown our real abilities just yet.” Iron Vajra shouted as his eyes exuded a blinding divinity.

“Is that so? I’m waiting to see your real abilities then. Go ahead.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“How bold, very well! Junior, I’m not trying to boast but once our Buddhist Palm comes out, only death awaits you.”

“Okay, okay, enough.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said: “I’ve heard plenty of boasting already. Ten Vajras? More like ten shameless braggarts. Make your move already.”

The ten’s chest puffed up and down from anger. Alas, this awkward situation couldn’t be helped since he did sweep through them earlier. Winning was the only way to fix this humiliation.

They glanced at each other before forming a mudra and chanting: “Ma ni mi ba mou.” [1]

“Boom!” One Buddhist gate appeared behind each of them and opened to pour out endless light.

The ten slowly retreated into the gates, disappearing from sight. The ten gates then became even brighter with enough brilliance to drown the whole world just like a primordial flood.

The boundless Buddhist light was all-encompassing and worked its salvation magic. Grains of light fell down. The world seemed to have a layer of golden sand, looking magical and profound.

This light eventually went away and was replaced by a gigantic lotus, looking just like a floating city.

“Buddhist Palm Scripture.” Someone murmured.

“This is their strongest combination move with peerless power. Few in this world can break it.” One ancestor emotionally said.

It was a scripture found by a wise sage of Hidden Gold Grotto. The text was profound and powerful, resulting in a powerful merit law and an exquisite combination attack.

Disciples from the sect in the past had a hard time exerting its true power until the generation of the ten Vajras. They were able to successfully cultivate this combination attack.

Some even believed that this particular move was the epitome of combination attacks.

“Its power is true. Jade-break True Emperor also attacked Hidden Gold Grotto once and defeated the ten Vajras. They had no choice but to resort to this move.” One expert revealed.

“How did it go?” People became curious.

“I heard they successfully pushed the emperor out of the sect. Of course, the emperor still left easily.” The expert said.

“That strong?” Many gasped in response.

“This is from a long time ago when Jade-break True Emperor was still young, far from being as strong as the present. Moreover, the battlefield was Hidden Gold so they had the help of their system as well. Because of the terrain advantage, they were able to use the move to its fullest potential. But this isn’t Hidden Gold today.” The expert looked at the sky.

“Sure, this place isn’t Hidden Gold, but the technique is famous for being virtually indestructible. According to the rumors, at full force, it can stop one blow from an ancestral weapon. It will be very difficult for Fiercest.” An ancestor said.

“Hidden Gold Grotto is strong indeed. Just the ten Vajras are scary enough, wouldn’t the four Treasure Monarchs be even more impressive?” A junior shuddered, feeling his hair standing on end.

This sect was indeed powerful enough to be a top lineage outside of the three behemoths.
