Chapter 5078: This Is My Weapon

The wind itself stopped blowing in anticipation of this battle. A drop of a needle could be heard within a ten million miles radius of Heaven Summit. Time finally got a needed break.

The world became small as if there were only two living beings left - Li Qiye and Conceal Conqueror. Everyone else was reduced to insignificant dust specks.

Spectators looked up and found themselves to be tiny ants looking at two dragons. Some thought that Li Qiye would win due to the precedence set by him. Others believed that Conceal Conqueror was still the undisputed champion of the lower continents.

Of course, they would get an answer soon enough.

Contrary to the tense crowd, Li Qiye appeared relaxed as he stretched his waist while looking around in all directions.

This confused Conceal Conqueror because stealth and ambush were her main skills. She believed that she was actually the best assassin in the lower continents. His action made her think that he was looking for people.

Ambushers wanting to take advantage of them? Or did he have allies?

However, the latter didn’t make sense because this wasn’t Li Qiye’s style. Moreover, she knew that he was clearly stronger and she was the underdog in this case.

This felt rather ominous so she became cautious. Her intuition also told her the same thing. Perhaps someone was indeed watching but she couldn’t spot them - this was virtually impossible in the lower continents.

“Is there a problem?” She asked; each word could pierce the soul.

“Nothing, if you want to fight, let’s get started and get this over with, I need to take a nap.” Li Qiye shrugged.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Listeners exchanged glances - only Li Qiye would dare to speak to Conceal Conqueror in this manner.

“Hand over the item and I will leave right away. Celestial Court will be kind to you in the future as well.” She was a straightforward person.

Listeners were stirred upon hearing this, even the top masters. It confirmed their speculation about her reason for staying here - a mission given by Celestial Court.

Li Qiye had obtained Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s item and now, he was the next target.

Winning Celestial Court’s favor was a serious matter. Even conquerors would think about it carefully. After all, they would always have a smooth passage in the upper continents and even the immortal continent.

Moreover, Li Qiye had always maintained relative neutrality, not standing on the side of The People or purposely antagonizing Celestial Court. With Celestial Court on his side, he would be equal to the great emperors and dao lords up there.

“I’m afraid you are misunderstanding something.” Li Qiye stretched and said: “I don’t give a shit about Celestial Court. Well, that’s not true, I do think about flattening them.”

This caused an explosion in everyone’s mind. Some wanted to scream in astonishment. “Domineering” was not enough to describe his statement.

Demon Conqueror and Luminous Conqueror - two brilliant cultivators - couldn’t flatten Celestial Court.

Someone as crazy as Maddened couldn’t do so either, only managing to leave a perpetual burning void there. Thus, Li Qiye’s claim was insane.

Nonetheless, no one openly criticized him for his declaration. Truth and Thousand-faced took a deep breath.

They actually had a good grasp on Celestial Court’s power, unlike the rest of the crowd who only knew it by its reputation. Was Li Qiye actually strong enough to do so?

Conceal Conqueror’s eyes narrowed and the chilling aura became increasingly unbearable. Everyone felt as if there was a layer of ice trapping them. The truth was that her gaze alone could kill the majority of the crowd if she so desired.

“Take out your weapon.” She didn’t comment on the absurdity of the claim and focused on the battle.

“I see that you have an invisible sword technique.” Li Qiye chuckled: “I suppose I need a weapon in order to block your attacks.”

Having said that, he casually picked up a dried branch and stripped off the dead leaves: “This is my weapon.”

The crowd was stunned after seeing his choice.
