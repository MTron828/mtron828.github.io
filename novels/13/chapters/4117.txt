“You’re quite insightful. My little cultivation is nothing before you.” The old man bowed again.

“I do enjoy being flattered.” Li Qiye said.

“I am speaking from the heart, I’m just a tortoise managing to reach the dao, can’t reach the apex.” The old man smiled wryly.

“This land is not bad at all. Even a worm can become something with the right luck.” Li Qiye commented.

“It is a blessing from above.” The old man said: “The land gave me a chance to cultivate, that’s why I’ve been here my entire life, just a frog under the well.”

“You’re unduly humble. Your power is enough to earn a spot among the top masters of Sword Continent.” Li Qiye said.

“There are too many masters out there, I certainly can’t compete.” The old man responded right away.

“You just don’t want to leave this island. It’s not a special treasure land or anything but there is a grand vein buried deep beneath, virtually undetectable. It helps your cultivation, albeit not at a rapid rate. But after millions of years, you’ll reach your goal one day.”

“I am in awe of your vision, Sir…” The old man was impressed by Li Qiye’s insight.

“It’s alright, I am not here to take your island, only to take a look.” Li Qiye waved his hand and continued: “I wouldn’t be here right now listening to you blabbering if I wanted it. Just one command would have been enough to take over.”

The old man looked a bit awkward after hearing this. He changed it to a smile right away and said: “Yes, you are a true dragon soaring on the horizon while this island is so tiny. It’s not big enough for you.”

He was indeed worried about Li Qiye liking the island. As he said before, he was just a regular tortoise lucky enough to be on the island and surrounded by its spirit energy. He had no master to guide him in the past and lacked an innate connection with the dao.

He never left the island before since it was everything to him. Given Li Qiye’s current forces, the guy could really take over.

Nonetheless, the situation looked favorable so far if Li Qiye could be trusted.

“You can stop worrying now and keep on being a good tortoise here.” Li Qiye said.

“Thank you, Sir.” The old man bowed his head and asked: “May I ask why you are here then? Let me know if I can be of service. I might be useless but I have a strong knowledge of the island and even Cloud Dream Lake. I will tell you everything I know.”

“Since you’ve been here for so long, have you seen any strange phenomenon?” Li Qiye smiled.

“What do you mean by strange phenomenon?” The old man asked.

“You were granted a path towards the dao just by being here. Tell me, what would be considered a phenomenon on this special island?” Li Qiye said.

“Hmm…” The old man pondered for a while before answering: “My inability restricts my vision, I’m sure I don’t notice all the mysteries but if I must bring something up, I’m sure I’ve heard the roars of a true dragon during my youth.”

“A true dragon’s roar.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Of course, I have never met a true dragon or heard its cries before. It’s just that the sound was completely different from those of regular dragons, not similar to the roars from techniques either. I really thought that it came from a true dragon back then.” The old man answered earnestly.

“That is indeed what you heard.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Really?” The old man shuddered because this was a creature only existing in the legends. He took a deep breath and said: “I only heard it occasionally during my youth, it stopped later.”

“I see.” Li Qiye pondered.

“Are you looking for something, Sir? It might be on the other islands.” The old man noticed Li Qiye’s expression.

“It’s here at the lake.” Li Qiye said.

“Maybe you should go take a look at Dark Gale Camp, it could be there.” The old man said.

“Trying to kill with a borrowed knife?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Of course not, Sir, that is absolutely not my intention.” The old man’s expression soured as he waved his hands repeatedly to deny the accusation.

“Really?” Li Qiye smirked at him.

“Yes, I have no ambition or plan to speak of, the only thing I want is to stay here, heaven is my witness.” The old man anxiously said, clearly feeling afraid of Li Qiye.

“Seems like you're afraid of Dark Gale Camp.” Li Qiye asked.

The old man put on a smile and said: “Dark Gale is the leader of Cloud Dream Lake, the pillar upholding everything. This region only exists because of it, otherwise, other great powers would have divided us…”

“Stop, I’m not a member of Dark Gale, no need to express your loyalty in front of me.” Li Qiye interrupted him and smiled: “Tell me, how strong is Dark Gale?”

The old man hesitated for a bit before speaking: “Dark Gale is older than the majority of great powers in Sword Continent and has countless elites. Cloud Dream King is a capable ruler as well and their ancestor is also quite unstoppable…”

This sounded like flattery but it was indeed the truth. People looked down on Cloud Dream Lake, thinking that it was a bunch of ruffians banding together.

If this was the case, how could it have survived for millions of years? The answer had nothing to do with the eighteen islands.

The masters of these islands have changed numerous times in history. The only constant and the only thing that mattered was Dark Gale Camp. It prevented other great powers from taking over and dividing the pie.

Villains and monsters gathered here in Cloud Dream Lake. Alas, no one had ever thought about rebelling against Dark Gale Camp. All of the above was a testament to its power.

“Have you been there before?” Li Qiye asked.

“I have, it’s a blessed place with plenty of talents, so much better than my island. It’s unfathomable as well.” The old man said.

“I see.” Li Qiye nodded.

“That’s why I said whatever you’re searching for might be there. You should visit and see.” The old man said.

“Why not?” Li Qiye agreed.

“Sir, I have ties with Cloud Dream King so if you wish to go there, I can lead the way.” The old man suggested.
