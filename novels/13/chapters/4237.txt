Chapter 4238: It’s That Simple

RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

They intended on surrounding Li Qiye but this was not without resistance. The ancestors from the other powers joined the fight as well - Nine-sun, Terra, Ling Jian, the lord of Flame Valley…

The atmosphere became awfully tense, on the verge of erupting. The tension was palpable.

“An all-out war?” The neutral spectators exchanged glances and felt uneasy.

A war would drag the great powers and their vassals into this mess. The weaker sects would be the real casualties.

“Imagine the consequences…” An ancestor from a large sect became justifiably worried. Countless inhabitants in Sword Continent could die from this conflict.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, remained calm and collected. He patted the sword and took a good look at it: “Hmm, this is grand completion, I suppose.”

There was another happy individual - Daoist Peng. He heaved a sigh of relief after seeing Li Qiye’s success.

On the other side, Vastsea and Earthraiser stopped their attack. However, their eyes remained fixated on Li Qiye. They had no idea how Li Qiye obtained the sword so easily when they did everything possible and failed.

“Fellow Daoist, how did you seize the sword?” Earthraiser’s curiosity got the best of him.

“I grabbed it, how else?” Li Qiye smiled.

“...” The vajra had no response. Everyone else felt the same way but he wasn’t lying. Raising his hand and calling out for the sword was all he did. Of course, none believed that it was so simple.

“Want to rob me?” Li Qiye stared at the duo.

“Young Noble, since you have obtained it, it belongs to you.” Everlasting Sword God was naturally on Li Qiye’s side.

This applied to Hallowed City Lord and his allies as well.

The members of the two behemoths then stared at the venerable and the vajra, waiting for a response.

These two became the main factor in whether a war would break out or not.

They thought about it carefully; numerous ideas flashed in their head. This decision was pivotal for their future. They and their sect knew how important this sword was since it was rumored to be the strongest out of the nine.

This rumor remained unverified since it never had a master before. The accompanying sword dao was a mystery as well.

If another great power were to obtain Myriad Era, it might change the balance in Sword Continent and affect their dominance. Thus, they blocked everyone else from coming in while trying to seize the sword.

The problem was Li Qiye’s alliance. He had top masters as his allies along with their sects, enough to pressure them and make this difficult.

Nonetheless, they were still afraid of him the most. He has been shrouded by fog and mist; his actions and successes were inexplicable. They weren’t certain of victory at all, especially not after seeing another miracle in person.

“Ahem.” The venerable spoke: “In my opinion, this requires further deliberation.”

“I know that Brother Vastsea has some incredible wines. How about sharing them with us while we talk this through? We need to be thorough.” Earthraiser nodded.

They neither confirmed nor denied Li Qiye’s possession of the sword, only wanting to buy more time.

The crowd breathed easily after hearing the lack of aggression. It seemed that the duo preferred anything other than a direct confrontation. This was absolutely good news for the rest of the world.

“What is there to deliberate? The sword is in my hand, as if I would give it to you two. Alright, this matter is over now, beat it.” Li Qiye replied.

He didn’t give them any face. In fact, this was a slap to the face before a large crowd. The duo was polite and made it easy for both sides to back down.

As for Li Qiye, he chased them away like flies. Top masters like them couldn’t handle the insult.

Though they didn’t know any anger, their sect members glared angrily at Li Qiye. The latter didn’t mind at all.

“Why is he so impolite? He’s talking to Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra.” One expert was dissatisfied, thinking that he was out of line.

“He’s either stupid or crazy.” One youth blurted without thinking.

“Is that what you think?” His senior said.

The youth had no response because this was clearly not the case. Would Everlasting Sword God and the others support a stupid or crazy person?

“There’s another possibility.” An old king mused.

“What is it?” Someone nearby asked.

“Would a Heavenly Sovereign care about the dignity and pride of a weak vagabond?” The king answered with a question.
