Chapter 5638: True Reincarnation?

Immortal Emperor Bai Lian couldn’t help glancing at the so-called nirvana vessel growing on the reef, licking his lips.

“Still want it?” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man became startled and bowed again: “Of course not, I was merely taking a look. I do not dare to covet something you desire, Sacred Teacher.”

Having said that, he glanced back at the dendrobium and said: “It’s just that, this thing can help with reincarnation.”

“Its reincarnation is not true reincarnation, only a way of prolonging life or seizing someone else’s body.” Li Qiye stared at it and elaborated.

“Sacred Teacher, from what I know, Immortal Emperor Yi Shi and Immortal Emperor Er Shi utilized this mystery to live again. I believe there was a third life in Eight Desolaces as well.” Bai Lian commented. [1]

“If they’re all the same people, then it is a third life indeed. There was an Immortal Emperor San Shi before the great calamity.” Thousand-hand Dao Lord joined the conversation. [2]

Long ago in the nine worlds, an Immortal Emperor was rumored to have a reincarnation ability. Even if he were to die, he would be reborn again in due time.

None believed in this tale but Immortal Emperor Yi Shi eventually fell in battle. Later on, a new Immortal Emperor took the title of Er Shi, giving credence to the rumor.

The same didn’t happen for a long period after Immortal Emperor Er Shi’s death. Just before the great calamity came another emperor with the title of San Shi.

The rumor was brought up again on whether he was the reincarnation of Immortal Emperor Er Shi.

They speculated that all three were the same person. It was just that the timeline between each rebirth was different.

San Shi dominated the nine worlds with his unstoppable divine flame. He was in charge of the world until he met the most formidable foe - Ice Empress.

A mighty battle ensued where the empress utilized a force capable of freezing the entire nine worlds to slay the emperor. She never appeared again afterward either, perhaps due to the heavy price paid to use that technique. Some even said that both of them had died during that battle.

“What was the name of this Immortal Emperor San Shi before the ascension?” Li Qiye asked.

“A supreme genius known as Tian Lunhui. Strangely enough, I think this name appeared several times in different generations.” Thousand-hand Dao Lord responded.

“All members of All-eras Ancient Kingdom, I’m sure. This is just Immortal Emperor Yi Shi’s technique, leaving seeds behind and always shifting.” Li Qiye said.

“I see, snatching the body of his descendants.” Immortal Emperor Bai Lian’s eyes flashed with realization.

“Yes, blood is thin in this case.” Li Qiye said: “As for reincarnation and rebirth, that’s just a deliberate attempt at mystification.”

“He left seeds within his lineage. If he were to be killed, he could snatch a different body then.” Bai Lian understood the intricacies and stared at the dendrobium: “That’s the crux of this mystery.”

“Yes, it’s not him but rather, this Reincarnation Loop.” Li Qiye said.

After hearing this, Bai Lian, Sindragon, and Thousand-hand understood that the legends were partly true.

All those Immortal Emperors were the same person but he didn’t possess the mystery of reincarnation. He merely relied on this treasure to flawlessly snatch the bodies of his descendants.

This required him to plant seeds among those sharing the same bloodline as him. It couldn’t be just any random stranger.

“Nothing is amazing about this.” Li Qiye commented: “Living again and again, for what? Was only a weakling who couldn’t improve enough. This is not the proper dao to follow.”

Most would love to have the chance to live again after dying. Nonetheless, the trio thought about it and didn’t necessarily disagree.

Immortal Yi Shi ascended three times to the proverbial throne successfully but that was it. He didn’t seem to grow stronger each time.

During his third life, he didn’t even have the chance to climb up to the thirteen continents before being killed by Ice Empress.

Thus, his success seemed limited to the group. On the other hand, regular cultivators viewed his life as a magnificent legend - becoming an Immortal Emperor three times.

Perhaps his ambition in creating All-eras Ancient Kingdom was to have an eternal dynasty so that he could rule for ages to come. Now, none of this came true.

“Reincarnation Loop.” Sindragon stared at the flower and said: “Is his soul hiding in there now?”

“Immortal Emperor Yi Shi is no more. The flower has a different master now.” Li Qiye answered while staring at the stamen filled with stars.

“A new master?” The trio couldn’t help staring intensely at the flower afterward.

“Another karmic knot to be loosened.” Li Qiye sighed and murmured to himself.

“Boom!” Having said that, he raised both palms and activated an unparalleled dao source.

Although he didn’t release an oppressive divinity, the trio still trembled in astonishment. This alone could reduce them to ashes if targeted.

Therefore, they hurriedly retreat to a safe distance. Otherwise, just a slight movement of his palms could make them vomit blood.

Space trembled as a dao light appeared in the center of his palms. He then reduced it down to primordial particles, resembling golden powder.

He scattered it down to the stamen of the flower, causing a reaction with the celestial expanse.

“Buzz.” Three thousand worlds lit up at the same time, seemingly on the verge of exploding.

The trio saw the erupting radiance and immediately protected their mind, not wanting to be affected.

Meanwhile, the light rings around the flower suddenly stopped rotating.

1. Yi Shi is first life/generation, Er Shi is second life/generation ?

2. San Shi is third life/generation ?
