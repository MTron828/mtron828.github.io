Chapter 4930: Gambling

Qing Songke prepared himself and reached inside the sack.

Everyone watched with bated breath and became nervous. After all, he was the first to attempt.

If he were to be extremely unlucky, this misfortune might infect the entire event. A second at this moment felt like an eternity.

“Time’s up.” The old man said.

He unwillingly pulled his hand back, revealing to the crowd that he found nothing.

“Just like the rumors, the first is always unlucky.” A student said with disappointment.

“Next.” The old man said.

Songke’s failure didn’t stop others from wanting to try. The temptation of success was too great.

“I’m going.” The next student took out a regular firestone.

He reached around for a bit and pulled out an ingot of shimmering metal.

“Crimsonmountain Metal.” Someone recognized the ingot and shouted: “That’s quite a hefty profit.”

Of course, this wasn’t a supreme fortune at all but the quick profit gave everyone hope.

“My turn, my turn!”

“No, I was ahead of you!”

…

Students wanted to beat each other to the line since this was a shortcut to supremacy.

Among them were some sincere souls who took out the best treasures. Alas, the majority relied on luck and only pawned the most ordinary items.

Some examples included a cultivation manual from the mortal world and ordinary ointments. A few took out some strange stuff that must have been picked up randomly, not worth a single coin.

The old man was fully surrounded by shouting students in no time at all. He accepted all the items without taking a second look. It was as if trash and treasures were the same in his eyes.

Because of this, a few thought about just using the cheapest things possible to pawn, believing that luck was the most important factor.

Of course, some of their friends disagreed and sneered at them.

One guy said: “What you’re pawning is not your item but rather, your fortune. There is only one so sincerity is very important here.”

However, the majority of both sides didn’t gain anything. The luckiest ones so far only obtained some decent treasures.

“This can’t be right, how can I be so unlucky?” A student said with indignation after pawning off his most valuable treasure and only getting an entry-level one back. He lost everything and was furious.

“Just accept the loss gracefully. No one forced you to play.” The old man said with a friendly smile.

This was indeed the case; the old man didn’t force anyone to trade. Moreover, no one here could do anything to him because he was clearly stronger than them.

Not all complained. Another exchanged a regular item but ended up taking a pagoda out of the sack.

“Boom!” Waves rushed out and smashed everyone in the chest, causing them to feel as if their body was cracking down.

“What a treasure…” They observed ancient runes and laws pulsing around the pagoda. It seemed capable of refining heaven and earth.

“Young man, you’re quite lucky to get this World-eater Pagoda.” The old man laughed.

“Th-thank you, Senior.” The student was overwhelmed with emotion. He bowed at the old man and instantly disappeared into the crowd.

He clearly had a humble background and didn’t want to die because of greed.

“I’m so jealous.” Many clamored since he was the first to obtain something noteworthy.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Those who had doubts after so many failures saw hope again and became lively.

“The pawnshop is real, we can get something great from it.” Some wanted nothing more than to reach inside that sack.

As time passed, no one was able to duplicate the feat done by that unknown student.

“The chance seems rather low, it’s just a gamble.” Goldcrest Young Noble commented.

“Yes, an exceedingly rare yet potentially lucrative fortune. No one can afford to miss it.” Yunyun said.

The buy-in for this gambling attempt was low so it didn’t matter to the students.

“Go.” Li Qiye told Ming Shi.

Her eyes lit up as she said: “You found out his secret, right? Hehehe, will I get something amazing?”

“Trust me, you will obtain a grand fortune.” Li Qiye smiled and rubbed her head.

His confident declaration attracted unwanted attention.

“Who do you think you are? The old man might be able to say this but you’re just a junior. Know your place.” One student said.

Of course, those nearby have been paying attention to their group. After all, it consisted of three top dogs in Abroad. They didn’t know who Li Qiye was and wondered why he was with them.
