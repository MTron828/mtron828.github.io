Chapter 5839: Shield Of Nature

“Boom!” A stone shield came from one of the exposed dimensions and aimed for Li Qiye’s head.

Nothing in the world could be heavier, thicker, or more powerful. It wasn’t large but the entire epoch had a hard time withstanding its attack.

Not to mention five emperors, not even fifty working together could stop it from turning them into meat paste. In fact, that would have been an impressive feat because the more likely scenario was them being turned into blood mists without the chance to scream.

“Boom!” Li Qiye punched the shield; his fist wielding the primordial power of time and space.

It didn’t destroy the shield, merely pushing the attacker back and making him spin once in the air before landing.

All eyes were on him - an old man with a bronze-like tan, seemingly having experienced countless years in the desolate wilderness.

Although he didn’t have an invincible aura, his dark blue eyes resembled the most precious gems and commanded admiration and awe.

They looked out of place on the old man, capable of seeing all the secrets of the world. He could find the most hidden treasures with one glance.

He posed defensively with his stone shield forward, unafraid of anything. It had an unsightly and uneven exterior, roughly rectangular and somewhat oval. The irregular edges looked like canines and gave the impression that it was forcibly broken off a cliff.

The entire shield had scorch marks as if it had been ravaged by flames. Dirt could be found on the edges and cracks, giving the impression that it was just excavated from the ground.

Its lack of impressive appearance didn’t mean much because while he had the shield in his hand, people felt as if he was holding the entire world.

When he gently rested it on the ground, it made a loud thud noise - a sign of the earth being unable to bear it.

“Stonespliter, you’ve finally crawled out!” Derivation shouted.

Listeners before the mirror took a deep breath. So this was Stonesplitter Patriarch - the pioneer of blacksmithing and the creator of the five immortal armaments.

Stonesplitter ignored Derivation and focused on Li Qiye alone, still raising his shield defensively.

“What a shield, created by nature too.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but praise.

“You’re too kind, just got lucky.” Stonesplitter answered humbly but everyone knew that this stone shield might be one of the strongest defenses in existence.

It shared the same title as him, Stonesplitter Shield. Because of this, he didn’t care for the five armaments and Cosmic Immortal Carapace, leaving them scattered across the realm for others to find. [1]

He came across a special meteor and spent his whole life obtaining and shaping it into a shield. Although its name wasn’t awe-inspiring, he was confident that it could become the toughest shield in history. It granted him enough confidence to stand before Li Qiye.

“Clank!” He summoned a spear, one just long enough to be a perfect match for both him and his shield.

It had a celestial shade like the stars with numerous forging marks after undergoing countless hammering, melting, and refinement. The essences of the stars were extracted and turned into the main material.

Due to the meticulous refining process, the spear looked somewhat rough and worn. Its potency stood in stark contrast - as sharp as could be. A slight touch could pierce through any cultivator or barrier.

“You’re hiding with Skypiercer? Attack with me.” Derivation gave up on running and egged his ally. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, Skysplitter remained defensive, hiding behind his shield and pointing Skypiercer at Li Qiye. This weapon could be enough to deliver a substantial injury given the right opening.

Emperors viewed Skysplitter as a magnificent cultivator and a creator of wondrous treasures. Thus, his overly cautious style surprised them. He looked as if he only wanted to wait for the right opportunity to ambush - something rather despicable and cowardly.

He didn’t care for their opinion or Derivation’s taunting. His only focus was to stay alive until the perfect moment.

“Boom!” Another epoch-level power descended before its owner and coiled around Li Qiye, intending to burst through him.
