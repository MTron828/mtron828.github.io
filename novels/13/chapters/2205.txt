After Li Qian took the ancestors away, Li Qiye casually raised his hand. The primordial laws also left the girl, restoring her freedom.

She was quite surprised and stared at him in a daze, not believing that he would do something like this.

“Sijing, prepare a place and treat her like a guest.” Li Qiye told Sijing behind him.

Nevertheless, the girl didn’t lose her caution: “What do you want?”

“What can I do? Eat you? Can’t exactly do much to a hostage.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Who knows what you want to do?” The girl snorted: “Perhaps you have some devious plans, heretics like you can’t be trusted.”

He stared up then down at her: “What plans? In terms of beauty, you’re only average, barely qualified to be a bed warmer. I’m not staring enough to eat just anything.”

“You...!” Her face turned red, eyes nearly spewing fire.

All girls worried about their looks, let alone someone as beautiful as her. Though not the prettiest in Myriad Lineage, she was still the number one at Vermillion. So many men would be willing to kneel before her.

She was certainly confident in terms of appearance so now, she certainly wasn’t fond of his comment to say the least, and definitely not his current attitude - seemingly can’t stand her.

“Do you know that your mouth stinks?” She gritted her teeth and retorted. [1]

If she wasn’t a captive right now, she would rush forward and break that foul mouth of his.

“Wait, you tasted it before, that’s why you know? Well, do you want a taste?” He smiled and teased.

“Pervert!” Her face became as red as rouge as she quivered with rage.

Li Qiye was quite amused: “Even if I was a pervert, I wouldn’t do anything to you since I’m a very picky eater.” Nevertheless, he looked at her again in an intrusive manner, seemingly wanting to pick out the best part.

She grew frightened and felt naked before his penetrating gaze, causing her to turn away.

Zhu Sijing smiled while watching the teasing session.

“Alright, no more playing around.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said: “Tell the disciples to take care of our esteemed guest.”

“Miss, follow me.” Sijing told Bingning.

Bingning scowled and gave him a glare. One needed to bow their head when in someone else’s home; otherwise, she would definitely try and fight this pervert.

“Wait, I forgot.” Li Qiye added: “Don’t think about causing trouble or escaping or I’ll strip you naked and hang you outside of royal court. Be a good girl now.”

She answered the threat with another scowl before leaving with Sijing.

After sending the ancestors away, Li Qian returned to see Li Qiye.

“I’ll leave after a couple of days.” Li Qiye said: “The future of Insane Court is up to you all.”

“You’re leaving, Forefather?” Li Qian was surprised.

“Yes, it is time.” Li Qiye chuckled while staring at the horizon. He didn’t come to Three Immortals because of Insane Court.

This trip here was a touch of fate, ending the karma between him and the old man.

Li Qian spoke softly: “If that’s the case, I’ll go in your stead and give an apology to the other systems.”

Li Qiye smiled: “Are you worried about me or the other systems?”

Being exposed left Li Qian awkward. He coughed and said: “I’m just willing to work hard for you, Forefather.”

“I know what you’re thinking but I’m not going to the other systems just to give them an answer. I have other businesses.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve and said.

“May I ask where you are going to? Which system first?” Li Qian asked for clarification.

“Longevity Valley, their pills are considered the best in Myriad Lineage so I wish to take a look.” Li Qiye answered.

Li Qian misunderstood, thinking that all ancestors after reaching a certain level would be interested in Longevity Pills. Who could resist the temptation of eternal life? Alas, Li Qiye was only looking for the mysteries behind immortality.

“May I ask when you will return?” Li Qian asked.

“You want me to stay here?” Li Qiye glanced at him and said.

“Not just me, but everyone in the system wishes for you to stay. As long as you’re here, we’re completely united.” Li Qian said.

This was indeed the truth. No one had a higher status than Li Qiye at the moment. He could give order to everyone; solidarity was important for revitalization.

“Everyone has their own path, same with a system.” Li Qiye said: “Insane Court is no longer a child that needs help every step of the way. But if this is the case, it will never mature beyond being a decorative flower inside the house, unable to face the storm outside. Because of this, my departure is a test for the system on top of being an opportunity. I have done what I can and left behind what I should. Your future must be carved by you, that’s the only way to truly strengthen the system.”

“I’ll forever keep your teaching in mind, Forefather.” Li Qian bowed deeply and said.

“Insane Court still has a long way to go. You all have much to do.” Li Qiye continued.

Li Qian gently sighed, aware that their path wasn’t going to be easy. Nevertheless, Li Qiye had carved a path for them, much better than before.

“Where are you going, Forefather? To Immortal Lineage or somewhere even farther away?” Li Qian asked.

“You want to ask about the final destination.” Li Qiye said.

Li Qian told the truth: “I’m simply curious about the end path of True Emperors and progenitors. Please enlighten me.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In fact, he wasn’t the only one curious about this matter because after each era, these beings would eventually disappear. No one knew where they went. Some believed they died from old age while others said they went to a faraway place.

There was one bolder speculation - a world named Everlasting. These beings would eventually go there and live forever.

“What’s the point in knowing before reaching the right level, it would only vex you. Just take it one step at a time, you’ll be qualified to find out more as an Eternal.” Li Qiye smiled.

Due to his massive memories and own research from ancient scrolls, he had a clear outline of the final destination in Three Immortals.

“Yes, Forefather.” Li Qian bowed his head and said: “If you could see the progenitor, please tell him that his descendants in Insane Court wish him good health.”

“You think Insane Ancestor is still alive?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile.

“We can’t speculate anything about the great beings.” Li Qian coughed.

No one knew where the progenitors went; some True Emperors have searched as well. The only thing was that Insane Ancestor told his descendants that he would one day reborn and ascend to become an immortal.

This was why many people in Insane Court believed he was still alive.

Li Qiye only smiled instead of revealing Insane Ancestor’s current whereabouts.

1. I had this translated as “Do you know that you have a foul mouth?”, sounds better, but the next lines require this literal translation
