Chapter 5874: Every Man For Himself


“Ahh!” In the end, Dao Ancestor and his unique physique couldn’t escape the fate of being refined.

He truly thought that this ace card would keep him alive regardless of the circumstance but reality got the best of him.

Stonesplitter became the only survivor out of the five from Trinity Epoch despite being the weakest and least prominent.

“Do it.” He let out a sigh and said: “Can’t escape death after all, that’s fine.”

“When did you become a sinner?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I know exactly when, my dao heart became unstable ever since the ambush. There was no turning back.” Stonesplitter said.

He spent his life working to craft an invincible weapon. His findings paved the road for Trinity’s blacksmithing system.

For example, all five immortal armaments came from him, the same for many other powerful weapons.

This obsession made him wonder about Divine Ancestor. He didn’t wish to devour him like the others, only wanting to use the corpse to create the ultimate weapon. In fact, he despised the idea of devouring flesh and essences to live longer. Unfortunately, his participation was for naught since they left nothing for him. 

Due to his principles, he didn’t participate in the splitting of the world. He also disagreed with them refining half of all living beings and chose to stay out of it.

“Don’t you know that the ultimate weapon is not made from the material or the sacrifice, but rather the willpower of its creator?” Li Qiye remarked.

“Alas, my cultivation was not enough. This is it for my pursuit.” Stonesplitter said.

His ambition was to create a paragon artifact but his cultivation wasn’t at the level where he could without taking shortcuts.

“Then keep on cultivating without taking shortcuts.” Li Qiye said.

This surprised him since Li Qiye turned away.

“Aren’t you killing me?!” Stonesplitter shouted.

“No rush.” Li Qiye said with a smile, picking his next target - Voracious Leviathan.

He looked tiny compared to the largest overlord.

“What a shame.” He shook his head: “You were special and could have become a true epoch lord, but a moment of greed resulted in eternal damnation.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Right, right.” Voracious agreed: “I know that I was wrong, please forgive me. I will change and become a good person from now on…”

He tried again after seeing Li Qiye not killing Stonesplitter. Would he be spared as well?

“You are a disgrace of an overlord.” Epoch’s End sneered.

“None of your business, we’re not on the same level either. You devoured six epochs out of greed, now that’s unforgivable.” Voracious said.

“It is unforgivable, so just take my life, that’s all.” Epoch’s End said.

“Hmph, if you truly had this thought, you wouldn’t have been hiding in the same rat hole as us and always praising yourself as a devourer of six epochs. Such a fearless soul would have embarked on an expedition but no, you were inferior to a brute such as Trinity. At the very least, the guy had enough courage to start.” Voracious barked back.

“Rat hole is the correct choice of words, birds of a feather flock together.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmph.” Epoch’s End closed his eyes, not bothering to retort.

“Dark Crow, spare me and I will protect your epoch for as long as I live.” Voracious said.

“Can’t make a dog stop eating shit, you are the least trustworthy of the overlords, a venomous serpent ready to bite its master.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“No, although I devoured my epoch, I will never break a promise.” Voracious said.

“Is that so, I believe when you were just a tiny snake, you made the same promise to Ancestral Dragon. What happened in the end? You devoured him.” Li Qiye said.

“Hmph, that was not my fault.” Voracious uttered coldly: “Ancestral Dragon wanted everything, all the worship. He didn’t want to share with me a bowl of soup, was it just because of my ominous birth?”

“Instead of becoming the source, you chose to destroy your roots.” Li Qiye said.

“Every man for himself, that’s the law of nature.” Voracious said.

“Yes, and for my own sake, I have no intention of keeping a snake around to bite me.” Li Qiye smiled before reaching forward.

“Ahhh!” Voracious’ agonizing screams echoed for a long time.

Li Qiye tore through the mighty scales and crushed his body and true fate with primordial pulses.

“Dark Crow, I curse you!” Voracious screamed.

“The villainous heaven’s curse can’t reach me, let alone yours. Maybe I should let you suffer for eternity instead.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Give me a swift end!” Voracious feared an eternity of torment more than death because Li Qiye could do so.

“Ahh!” Li Qiye showed mercy by eliminating Voracious and releasing the refined essences back to the world.

“Another heavenly rain!” Living beings benefited immensely from the repeated essence rain.
