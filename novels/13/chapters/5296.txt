Chapter 5297: Heavener Remnants

The crowd still remembered how Illumination Conqueror stopped Heaven Alliance and slew numerous dragon lords and sovereigns. In fact, even dao lords and conquerors went down.

Because of his influence and power, he garnered numerous supporters during Emperor War. Only a selected few had the same authority as him among The People.

Moreover, his threat was not empty since he could most likely kill everyone from Heaven Alliance in the crowd right now.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“However, Lesser Firmament deserves destruction as well for harboring heavener dregs. This is a looming disaster that needs to be eradicated.” He added.

Everyone became startled after hearing this. Some stared at the mysterious fog and had different guesses about the situation.

“What does Lesser Firmament have to do with the heaveners?” A youth asked.

“Harboring heaveners? But who? Why does Illumination Conqueror want to eliminate them?” A dragon lord murmured to herself.

Lesser Firmament was the home of ancient emperors and monarchs from The People. However, they were being accused of harboring enemies. What was their actual stance?

“This is our own internal matter, you need not worry, Illumination.” Immortal Emperor Guan Feng responded.

The members of Firmament had lived for a long time now. Although Illumination was a rising star, they didn’t need to be subservient to him.

“It is everyone’s responsibility to eliminate potential disasters for the greater good while always attempting to defeat The Race.” Illumination responded.

“Well said! This is our world!” Some big shots from The People wholeheartedly agreed with this comment and respected him for always thinking about The People above all else.

As long as he was around, there was hope of eradicating The Race.

“Taking in sinners is an unforgivable crime.” A voice from the other side of space had the same dignified presence.

“Supreme!” Everyone trembled after hearing him - the leader of Heaven Alliance and the ultimate dragon lord.

“Lesser Firmament, hand them over.” He demanded domineeringly, leaving no room for objection.

“I shall not show mercy to the dregs of the past.” Illumination spoke.

Everyone stared in the direction of Lesser Firmmament, wondering about the existence inside. Whoever it was, they were hated by both Heaven Alliance and Azure School.

Of course, a few cultivators had a pretty good idea at this point.

“Boom!” Lantern and Godcloud came together to open a portal. They each pulled one side of the gate and created a pathway for a majestic legion.

They came out with enough momentum to crush the stars.

“Heaven Alliance’s legion.” A crowd member said, noting that the members were all sovereigns and higher.

They marched forward and looked eager to attack Lesser Firmmanent.

“I can’t miss out on this fun, haha!” Suddenly, a wild aura manifested into reality.

“Ferocity is here too?” Everyone became started after seeing the owner of the aura.

“Rumble!” Behind Ferocity came another portal. The scene beyond the door was a great pagoda.

Incredible cultivators from all over the world started walking out - Gigantic dragon lords, demon emperors, eight-eyed creatures…

“The Tower of Warriors! Divine Alliance is joining too…” A spectator whispered.

“Swordsea Dao Lord created the tower and let Ferocity be in charge.” Another said.

Despite three great powers posturing against Lesser Firmament, Skysword Dao Lord announced: “Gentlemen, leave Lesser Firmament to deal with its problem. Everyone should leave instead of violating Blessed’s pact.”

The pact had maintained peace for a long period but now, it appeared Divine, Heaven, and Azure School were willing to break it. This meant that war would return to the upper continents.

“Fellow Daoist Skysword, Dao Alliance was established to protect The People. Are you here as a representative of Dao Alliance? I’m sure protecting heaveners isn’t a part of its mission. Perhaps it sorely needs new leaders.” Heaven Hammer questioned.

Many cultivators from The People actually agreed with this, hence their support for Illumination Conqueror.

The rift in Dao Alliance was no longer a secret. Azure School seemingly had a different vision for the future than the current leadership in Dao Alliance.

“That is a good question.” Skysword Dao Lord took off the robe with the Dao Alliance symbol and said: “I represent Eight Desolaces Dao and I stand with Lesser Firmament. If you wish to press the issue, I am ready to entertain everyone.”

The scholarly dao lord revealed his muscular physique hidden beneath the robe.
