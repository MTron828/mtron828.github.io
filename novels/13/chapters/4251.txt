Chapter 4252: Too Weak

The members of Nine-wheel and Sea Emperor were in disarray. Their unbeatable ancestors have been defeated by Li Qiye, someone they previously deemed as being suicidal for daring to oppose them.

They felt suffocated as if there was an invisible hand grasping their throat. All eyes were on the overlords now.

In reality, everyone knew that they were quite old but their power masked their age. Now, they looked feeble and weak like mortal grandpas shivering to the cold winds.

“So that’s the Myriad Era Sword Dao, magnificent.” The venerable got up; even his spine looked curved now. The injuries didn’t diminish the glow in his eyes.

The old lion was still fierce and intimidating. This phrase encapsulated the current scene.

“We finally got to see it.” The vajra became emotional.

Of course, they were still shocked to lose to a junior. Most importantly, he didn’t use any special or sorcerous method. He simply defeated them using Myriad Era and its dao. Losing the battle on top of their lifespan was hard to accept.

“You’ve lost.” Li Qiye stated.

This was not the first time he said these words in such a casual manner. Alas, the weight of his words this time was too much to bear.

Both the duo and their allies became frozen. A junior had indeed bested them in public. This situation was beyond their control.

“What do you think you should do now?” He smiled at them, seemingly ready to deliver judgment.

“What do you want?” The vajra uttered coldly. An overlord like him has truly fallen off the pedestal. He still had the same pride but the arrogance was gone.

He and his ally were no longer eligible to look down on Li Qiye. Their confidence has been shattered.

“Commit suicide or must I have to do it myself?” Li Qiye demanded.

“You!” The vajra turned red.

Li Qiye’s contempt could be attributed to arrogance and ignorance before. Now, since he had the upper hand, it was pure contempt and disdain.

“Li, don’t push it!” An ancestor from Sea Emperor shouted.

Their sects would never accept this because the overlords were their pillars and spiritual totems. If they were to commit suicide and apologize to Li Qiye, the sects’ prestige would be ruined.

“Fellow Daoist, your sword art is the best in the world. We accept defeat and let’s drop it at that? Our sects will no longer stand in your way.” The venerable took a deep breath and admitted. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

All eyes were on Li Qiye now. The venerable has chosen to surrender, the same with their entire alliance.

This would firmly establish Li Qiye’s dominance on the continent. No one would disagree in order to prevent further complications.

“You think too highly of yourself, I don’t care about what you and your sect will do. The only thing I want is your head.” Li Qiye glared at them.

The duo’s expression became extremely ugly right away. They have already thrown away their pride to surrender to him yet he still wouldn’t spare them?
