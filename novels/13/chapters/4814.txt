Chapter 4815: Nine Worlds’ Evil Subduer

“Your transgression against my young noble shall end with death.” The Divine Monarch’s voice was both pleasant and dignified. This was a supreme being respected by all of Eight Desolaces.

She wielded enough prestige and authority to command people without being forceful. Her appearance instilled hope into the spectators, having saved them from Dead Immortal’s domination.

“I see.” Dead Immortal said before disappearing from sight. Lightning particles suddenly appeared in front of her and turned into Dead Immortal.

Divine monarchs and ancient ancestors couldn’t see its movement at all. It was as if it has always been standing there, ready to decapitate her.

One particle turned into an ocean of lightning energy. This ocean then gave birth to countless living beings who treated Dead Immortal as their god. They included all sort of powerful creatures - a red dragon with lighting currents, a phoenix with lighting flames, and lightning monstrosities…

Dead Immortal could create a world with a single thought. It contained his primal source of energy - the embodiment of his grand dao.

“Rise!” The Supreme Monarch was undeterred and chanted.

“Boom!” Dao laws appeared everywhere in Eight Desolaces and created an outline. This activated the individual earth veins so they released boundless dao power and chaos true energy.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The dao laws then came together to form a supreme spear. It contained numerous affinities - holy, temporal, life…

She grasped the spear and an imperial inferno surged behind her.

“Rumble!” Within the inferno came majestic figures ready to protect Eight Desolaces. They pulsed with eternal light, seemingly having crossed through the river of time from the ancient era to get to this current epoch.

Each had a unique style. One had countless swords floating behind him, ready to contend against the heaven and gods. Another held a saber up in the air; just one slash would end an era. The third emperor had a dominating aura capable of devouring the sun and moon…

Min Ren, Hao Hai, Hong Tian, Qian Li, and others for the emperors. The dao lords included Puresun, Sword Queen, Blessed…

“Boom!” These supreme cultivators offered their strongest power to the Supreme Monarch.

She glowed radiantly as if she was the center of Eight Desoalces, brighter than a hundred rising suns.

“The spirits of the emperors and dao lords!” Spectators were in awe.

“They shall protect us, they haven’t forgotten their descendants!” Many kneeled and shouted with tears streaming down their cheeks. Some smashed their forehead on the ground from being overwhelmed with emotion.

They prayed wholeheartedly, hoping that these ancestors would save them from this calamity. Her power has reached the apex - most likely the very limit of a cultivator from Eight Desolaces.

After all, the supreme overlords hiding in space and secretive locations didn’t belong to this epoch. They weren’t included in this classification.

Her unsurpassed appearance and aura instilled hope into the crowd. They were witnessing the guardian deity in action.

“Unfortunately, you’re still too young.” Dead Immortal raised one hand.

“Boom!” The boundless ocean of lightning was instantly refined into a single hammer. All of the powerful living beings inside that world became a part of this weapon.

“What did it do to its epoch?” A supreme overlord became serious.

That world earlier might have resembled Dead Immortal’s own epoch. Now, that refinement could have been a duplication of the past. It made people wonder - did its epoch end to the high heaven or someone else? Was that world consumed by Dead Immortal itself?

“Dao.” Dead Immortal whispered. Wielding this hammer was akin to wielding a whole epoch.

The dao of the epoch became the handle; its power became the head.

It attacked instantly instead of letting the opponent seize the initiative. A hammer smash with the might of an epoch rushed toward the Supreme Monarch.

Inhabitants of Eight Desolaces felt their head being smashed as well and bellowed in pain.

She raised her spear with both hands for a parry, creating an impenetrable defense.

The resulting explosion caused most living beings to faint instantly. The stars in the sky exploded from the impact.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Bam!” The hammer pushed through her spear and struck her, causing her to fall.

“Noo!” A divine monarch who was still conscious roared.

However, it only took a few seconds for her to regain her stability. That successful strike didn’t leave a serious injury.
