Chapter 4520: Final Auction

The big shots became anxious as the final auction was being brought up. They started calculating their financial power and resources.

The auction house had told them about the various items, just nothing in detail.

“Very well, here is the final auction.” The auctioneer clapped and his sect’s disciples carried out a trunk with numerous seals from top masters - a testament to the value of the thing inside.

The auctioneer then opened the seal under watchful gazes.

“Buzz.” Temporal fabrics opened after the lid was lifted. Everyone got an illusion that time came to a brief halt.

Although this only lasted for the blink of an eye, it made them exchange glances. This temporal halt clearly came from the treasure.

They saw rays oozing out from the treasure. They had the shimmering of rubies, being as bright as can be with a temporal affinity.

Time was definitely the source of life. While they were illuminated by the rays, they felt an unending life source.

The treasure was as large as the trunk, tall enough to reach the chest of an adult. The entire thing was a translucent amber. However, there were several layers to them due to the varying shades of red.

Inside was a girl wearing a timeworn style of clothes. The big shots here haven’t seen anything like it, certainly not the style from this epoch.

Moreover, they looked rather expensive even from a cultivator’s viewpoint. This meant that she came from a prestigious lineage in the past.

She had clear skin and sculpted features on a small face. Her nose was the most perfect work of art. She appeared to be around eight years old but looked superior to anyone else.

At the moment of her birth, she was destined for greatness and ready to rule. She lacked the vivaciousness of a child and possessed a dignified temperament instead. This wasn’t something that should be found in a young girl. Alas, it somehow felt right when seen on her.

They couldn’t tell whether this natural-born noble was alive or otherwise. Nonetheless, they still felt intimidated by her presence.

Though they were prepared for the final auction, seeing it left them emotional.

Li Qiye finally showed interest in an auction. His gaze pierced through the amber layers to see the girl. The other treasures failed to garner his attention, not her.

Everything about her was a mystery. However, the encapsulation preserved her throughout the years.

“Swindler, is she alive or not?”Jian Ming whispered.

“I don’t know.” The daoist shook his head.

“Don’t lie to me, I know that you have calculated her before.” Jian Ming insisted.

The daoist paused for a moment before whispering: “Fine, I didn’t see anything, it was too chaotic.”

“I thought your clan’s divination was peerless. I guess you didn’t learn well enough, maybe not even at the elementary level.” Jian Ming egged him on.

The daoist swiftly responded: “You don’t know shit. That thing sealing her can separate all else. It’s not as simple as just calculating because you want to. It can stop time along any fortune-telling. She herself is a chaotic entity, trying to figure out this temporal flow will take an insane amount of time and effort.”

The daoist had some clues and wanted to calculate the girl’s identity. Alas, during this process, he found that it was virtually impossible and not worth the price. Moreover, it might even end with death.

“Who is she?” One big shot asked.

“I don’t know, but possibly not from our epoch.” An old peer with knowledge of antiques said: “Her clothes are from an ancient era. There are a few ancient clans from the east that might be from the same one, like Void Imperfection.”

“I agree.” Someone from the east nodded: “I saw a portrait before, an ancestor from Void Imperfection. The outfit is similar but I can’t be sure.”

“Is it a self-seal or did someone else seal her?” Another asked.

“Either way, the result is unreal.” An adept master at temporal seals said: “Something like this required an immense force, resources, and manpower.”

“Therefore, the sealing intent aside, this character must be very, very important.” His friend added.

They agreed that a seal surviving an entire epoch wouldn’t be used for a regular cultivator.
