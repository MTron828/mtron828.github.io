Chapter 5863: Epoch Scales

Their reverse psychology fell upon deaf ears. Twilight Hunter seemed to have zero intention of showing up.

The group couldn’t do anything. If they had Twilight Hunter’s coordinates, they would be revealing them right now - the same as what Derivation tried to do. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The situation didn’t bode well for them after being targeted by Li Qiye. They wanted to drag Twilight Hunter down with them if they were to die fighting. At the very least, he gave them another sliver of hope.

Epoch’s End and Voracious Leviathan knew that Twilight Hunter was still around and always watching from the shadow. Threatening to reveal his secrets didn’t work either because they knew nothing about him.

“Looks like Twilight Hunter is scared out of his mind, preferring to be a cowardly turtle hiding in his shell.” Derivation laughed and tried again.

He wouldn’t have said something like this in the past, not wanting to be ambushed by Twilight Hunter. Alas, he had nothing to lose at this point.

“He might get lucky but you all won’t.” Li Qiye smiled.

The atmosphere became tense since this battle would decide everything. Losing meant becoming Li Qiye’s food but winning meant having it all.

No one else but Li Qiye could defeat the seven of them. They only had one chance.

“We have to fight, risk it all!” Primal shouted.

“Yes, I want his head!” Derivation shouted back.

“Boom!” He released boundless power and curse, affecting the entire battlefield.

“Fight so that we have no regrets!” Primal activated his bloodaxe and blood turned into flames. This was the most primal of bloodlines, capable of subjugating any living being.

“This is it.” Imperial Progenitor and Dao Ancestor prepared themselves for the final battle.

“The ultimate blood feast awaits us if we win.” Voracious roared and became resplendent.

“Boom!” Divine Beast Epoch seemed to be returning in the form of a ravaged world. After loud clanking noises, the various continents and domains condensed into scales latching onto Voracious’ frame.

Voracious was already large enough but with the new scales, he became larger and heavier - impervious to all attacks. Only these scales made from an epoch could accommodate his colossal physique.

“Raa!” Each scale possessed a unique ray and innate gift - rebirth of a phoenix, the primordial dao of a kun peng, the eternal fire of a qilin...

Divine beasts were blessed with innate gifts, virtually unstoppable once reaching maturity. With the help of cultivation, they strengthened their gifts to a frightening level.

However, this epoch was special in that any creature could evolve. Regular birds could cultivate long enough and gain the gift of a phoenix, rebirth. This applied to all the divine gifts.

Because of this, each of Voracious’ scales amazed spectators due to the embedded gifts.

“The treasury of Divine Beast Epoch.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but praise.

These innate gifts rarely seen in the mortal world were all present on Voracious.

“Get ready!” Epoch’s End also gathered an epoch-level power, sweeping through and suppressing the realms.
