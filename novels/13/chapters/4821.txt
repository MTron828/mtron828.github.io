Chapter 4822: Undying Lord

“Buzz.” Strings of death energy oozed out of the hole. This had a different smell than the stench of death.

Interestingly enough, it was actually brimming with a strange life force of the highest purity. Whoever was nearby would get the sensation of being surrounded by zombies. In fact, they themselves would think that they were turning into zombies.

The strings came together to create a figure shrouded in black armor. Only the lights of the eyes were visible.

The armor was made from an unknown material, seemingly the physical accumulation of the celestial night or the darkness of a bottomless abyss…

Death and darkness accompanied the set of armor from the time of its creation. This wasn’t as frightening as the pair of eyes.

They weren’t as large as the alligator lord’s eyes. However, the glimmers coming from them belonged to death.

Staring at these eyes was akin to being sentenced to the last moment of life. Because of this, the auraless figure scared the wits out of everyone.

His presence could turn Eight Desolaces into hell and the inhabitants into lost souls. He fixated on Li Qiye and so did the supreme aura of death.

“Death is the final destination. It beckons for you.” The existence spoke softly.

The ancient language controlled the aura of death. It tried to corrode Li Qiye but was blocked by an automatic barrier.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Undying Lord.” A different overlord said.

In the current Eight Desolaces were numerous supreme existences. They have been hiding for a long time now. Some have awakened when necessary.

Undying Lord was one exception since he never showed himself. Only a few knew about his existence.

“Master, my mission is complete.” Cosmic Lord looked fulfilled as if seeing death rule the world was his wish.

“Is that so?” Undying Lord uttered coldly.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The wound on Cosmic Lord’s chest exploded repeatedly.

“Crack!” It became overfilled out of his control, expanding into weird shapes.

“Master, what is happening?!” He bellowed but it was too late.

“Nooo!” He couldn’t react before exploding into pieces, leaving behind the mark of death.

With that, the lord turned the mark into a gigantic portal. A colossal entity flew out and tore apart the sky vault.

This resembled an evil planet with pulsing dark flames. It seemed to be made from hardened lava. Thick cracks on the surface were ignited, looking like blood veins.

Those strong enough could see through the planet and see something akin to a giant. Could this planet be a coffin?

“Brother Da.” Undying Lord spoke.

“Crack!” The planet’s cracks became larger until it collapsed to release the thing within.

It landed on an ocean and the water instantly evaporated. All the aquatic creatures in this ocean were reduced to ashes.

Strangely enough, it wasn’t that scary in terms of appearance and reminded everyone of egg yolk.

It then gathered together into an upright form. Next came the broken pieces of the planet. They landed and attached themselves to the “egg yolk”, revealing the true form of the creature.

This thing wasn’t close to being as large as the alligator lord. Nonetheless, its height could rival the tallest peak in Eight Desolaces.

Spectators had a hard time describing this creature. It had a large beak resembling that of a duck. Its round eyes seemed to be all white. However, upon closer inspection, its pupils were as tiny as mung beans.

They were dull and lifeless as if the creature had a mental deficiency. Its body was made from the same hardened lava, looking cumbersome and slow. It had short legs and big feet - a close comparison would be duck webs.

Compared to the other invaders so far, this one didn’t look threatening in the slightest.

“Is, is this a supreme overlord too?” Someone from Eight Desolaces asked.

“Lord Da!” One supreme overlord residing inside a mine became serious: “It owes us many lives.”

Strangely enough, this supreme overlord didn’t do anything and only stood there like a fool.

“Death, descend!” Meanwhile, Undying Lord gave the command. His stench of death immediately invaded Eight Desolaces.
