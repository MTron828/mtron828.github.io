Chapter 4221: Sword Snatching

Li Qiye easily won the exchange despite his severed state to the crowd’s astonishment. His own sword still penetrated his torso. However, no blood came out - a stark contest to the duo’s current condition.

He reached forward right after the successful attack while Peace Ocean was screaming. His hand appeared right next to the king; his target being Vastsea itself.

The aghast king wanted to slash the hand but it was too late. Li Qiye grabbed the sword and Peace Ocean couldn’t command it regardless of how hard he tried.

“Clank!” Li Qiye seized Vastsea away from its user.

“!!!” The crowd gasped after seeing the daylight robbery.

“Clank!” Vastsea made some noises as if it was resisting. However, he brushed it gently and silenced it right away.

A moment later, it hummed continuously but this time around, it seemed to be happy unlike before - akin to someone meeting an old friend.

“Are you seeing this?” One cultivator asked.

Earlier, Li Qiye beating his opponents was already ridiculous enough. That ability alone would let him rampage across Sword Continent. Now, he even took Vastsea?

This sword was obtained by the progenitor of Sea Emperor and followed him across countless battlefields. It remained in his lineage millions of years later and enjoyed tributes in the form of energy along with blessings from other cultivators.

In a sense, Vastsea and Sea Emperor were deeply intertwined. It also had powerful seals embedded, making sure that no one could take it away.

Moreover, if someone could get through all the seals, they would still need to be recognized by the sword first. Li Qiye had just done both in no time at all.

Removing the seals should have taken an immensely long period since they were built and augmented across numerous eras. Alas, he only needed to brush it gently once.

This shocked the crowd just as much as his victory against the duo.

“What a domineering act, taking a heavenly sword away from Sea Emperor…” An ancestor became emotional.

In the past, when the users of Vastsea died in the battle, it would automatically fly back to Sea Emperor. Li Qiye stopped this and became the next master of Vastsea.

“It’s just insanity at this point.” Another murmured while staring at the sword in Li Qiye’s grasp.

“This is going to be bad, Sea Emperor will go wild after losing Vastsea.” One king said with a serious expression.

Many became frozen because Li Qiye had just shaken the very foundation of Sea Emperor. It would be strange if they didn’t do everything possible to salvage this situation.

Meanwhile, Peace Ocean turned pale. Losing Vastsea was too much for him or the kingdom to take. They never expected this to happen due to the eternal seals put on by their sages. Even a dao lord would have a hard time erasing all of them.

As everyone else was lost in astonishment, Li Qiye stroked Vastsea again and whispered: “Long time no see.”

The sword hummed quietly, seemingly happy to see an old friend.

This surprised the crowd even more, especially Peace Ocean. Despite being Vastsea’s current user, he had never communicated with the sword like this before. This was also the case for the previous users.

Li Qiye and Vastsea seemed perfect together as if the sword was crafted for his personal use. There was a sense of familiarity that seemed so natural between the two.

“Enough!” A deafening roar suddenly echoed in everyone’s ears with the force of a tsunami.

Some cultivators were actually sent flying by the sound waves. An ancient ancestor appeared in the sky and landed like a divine sword from the heavens.

He stood on the ocean and didn’t hold back his aura. Terrible sword energies kept on pushing spectators backward, rendering them breathless and weak in the knees. Weaker cultivators lost their ability to stand.

He wore a bronze robe and appeared quite sturdy. His aura was imposing and stopped others from staring straight at him.

“Ancestor Jialun…” A king calmed down and revealed the title of this cultivator.

Ancestor Jialun or Sword God Jialun, one of the six sword gods of Sea Emperor. Rumor has it that he was the leader of this group and also the second strongest ancestor in his kingdom.

“Ancestor Jialun is finally taking action.” Others took a deep breath.

“Hand over Vastsea and I’ll drop this issue.” His words pricked the crowd in the chest. They contained a powerful divinity and made it hard for others to refuse.

A top dog has joined the fray. Any attack from him would be horrifically destructive.

“Jialun, I will entertain you if you want to fight.” A pleasant voice answered the newcomer.

A girl whose face was hidden by a black veil stepped out of Li Qiye’s entourage. No one could see through her stealth technique.
