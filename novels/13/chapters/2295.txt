Li Qiye smiled back at Conqueror: “Not interested.”

“Brother, no, Big Brother, my bamboo swords are number one right now, when you use it, you will be able to sweep through the entire world and anyone in it, I guarantee it.” The young noble didn’t give up: “This sword is the symbol of a master. One is worth a million coins, ten can protect your region with ease, one hundred will make you the richest of all...”

He continued on and on boasting about his swords. The experts here didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This was a great genius of Myriad so he shouldn’t be lacking money. Nevertheless, he loved the thrill of the sale.

“Young Noble, I’ll buy one.” A beautiful cultivator was won over by his peddling.

“Such insight, my fairy.” Conqueror laughed, showing off all of his charisma and charm: “This is definitely fate. Come to Conqueror City later on and I will be the best host, showing you all of its beautiful scenery.”

“Thank you.” The girl smiled. After all, Conqueror wasn’t a regular merchant. He was a famous genius so hearing these flowery words from him was enjoyable to her.

“No need to thank me.” Conqueror smiled: “You’re unbelievably insightful and wise, someone like you is suited for dual-wielding because of your great hand-eye coordination, I presume. Who will be able to stop you then?”

He immediately tried to get her to buy a second one.

“I’ve already bought one, is that still not enough?” The girl coquettishly pouted.

“Oh, I suppose I assumed too much, please excuse me. Nevertheless, it is so nice to meet you today. If you need anything in the future, just come to Conqueror and find me.” The young noble immediately conceded with sincerity. His smile easily won people over.

“Hmm, I guess I can buy another.” The girl was touched.

“You’re definitely my best customer. No wonder why early this morning, I could hear the birds chirping, a good omen; they were telling me that I would meet a beautiful and kind fairy like you, it really is the blessing of three lifetimes. Thank you for your business, if you need more swords in the future, just come to me.” The young noble joked with a serious tone.

“You’re such a smooth talker.” She playfully protested after chuckling.

“Conqueror, are you selling swords or flirting?” An old cultivator who knew him shook his head and said.

“Elder Shi, please.” The youth answered formally: “Of course I’m selling, but I’m also willing to befriend everyone in the world without any ulterior motive.”

Everyone was amused by his serious expression. He has always been like this. Of course, he certainly wasn’t flirting. Given his reputation and handsome appearance, plenty of girls would come running.

Li Qiye also chuckled. He then threw out a bunch of coins into the river and out came an elephant. It was different from ordinary elephants since it absorbed and spewed out clouds and mists with a sweet fragrance. It also had a bright and holy aura - quite an impressive appearance.

It accepted Li Qiye’s coins and would take him across the lake.

“A fragrance elephant.” The crowd was astonished at this extravagant showing.

“What a spender, calling a fragrance elephant for just one person. Even the successor of a system might not enjoy this privilege.” Someone enviously said.

“You don’t know anything, he’s an idiot with a lot of money.” Someone next to him quietly said: “Don’t tell me you don’t know about the ant-feeding kid? The guy is rich, he can throw money away to ants without a problem, let alone calling out this beast.”

Many didn’t know about Li Qiye’s identity, but they were aware of his reputation.

Everyone agreed with the previous speaker. Li Qiye could throw away coins to ants without batting an eye. Calling out the most precious beast to cross the lake shouldn’t be surprising.

He got on the elephant already and told the girl from the Ling Clan: “You want to cross?”

“I...” The girl hesitated.

“If you wish to ride the golden fish, then wait longer. There will be a storm for the next several days.” He said flatly.

The girl finally gritted her teeth and accepted: “Well, then I will have to, to trouble you then.”

She got on and sat behind him.

“Big Bro, how about another person? Your elephant can handle ten people just fine.” Conqueror shouted.

“No. You call one yourself.” Li Qiye refused instantly.

“Big Bro, you can’t be so unfair just because she’s a girl.” Conqueror protested with indignation: “Our meeting is fate, not to mention that calling a fragrance elephant is so wasteful. A poor child like me doesn’t have enough money to call one... how many bamboo swords do I have to sell...?”

While the guy was blabbering on and on, Li Qiye had already set off with his elephant.

In the end, Conqueror could only watch while lamenting: “Sigh, the wise sage says that desires are instinctive. I guess I can’t blame men nowadays for doing so...” [1]

One ancestor suggested with a smile: “Young Noble, you can cross the lake with us if you don’t mind.”

He summoned a big boat afterward.

“Of course I don’t mind and I very much appreciate your kindness.” Conqueror smiled and got on the boat.

He was different from the other young nobles. Both he and Coiling Dragon were from the same system, but Coiling Dragon had more influence and fame since the guy was the direct successor. He also didn’t have any alchemy abilities like Miracle, making others want to ask for favors.

Nevertheless, the fact that he could still be considered on the same level as them should speak volume of his talents.

Strangely enough, he didn’t act imperious or unreachable like the other two. This guy was not only friendly but also gave the impression of being very playful.

Plenty of people in Myriad wanted to befriend him despite his inferior background. Some thought that he had a chance of becoming a True Emperor as well.

Any cultivator would view befriending a future emperor as a good thing. Moreover, this young noble never had conflicts with anyone. At worst, he would only bother people to buy his swords.

That’s why there were smiles everywhere he went. They usually reciprocated his bright smile. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

***

The current of the lake ran strong with loud splashes. When on shore, the spectators could think that one step alone was enough to cross this lake. Alas, this wasn’t the case.

Once actually riding on top of it, they would find that an ocean was the more accurate classification, very easy to get lost in.

This was why people needed to ride beasts and boats in order to cross.

Li Qiye was on top of his elephant with the girl from the Ling Clan. He didn’t say anything, looking quite comfortable.

On the contrary, the girl felt awkward and didn’t know what to do. She didn’t really know him outside of rumors about him being too rich.

“My... name is Ling Ximo.” She found it appropriate to introduce herself.

She wanted to cross the lake earlier but didn’t have that much money, only able to call a fish at best.

Moreover, her cultivation was weak. A storm would definitely end her with only a fish so she hesitated before. Luckily, Li Qiye invited her to cross the lake together.
