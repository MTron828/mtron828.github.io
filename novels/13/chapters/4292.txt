Chapter 4293: Accepting A Disciple

In reality, Little Diamond could still afford to take care of him. Though it was only a small sect, it still had several hundred members. Another mouth to feed wasn’t a big issue.

Wang Weiqiao simply wanted to share the burden. Though he was the weakest, he was still a cultivator so hard labor wasn’t overly difficult. Moreover, he was in great shape for someone his age.

“I’m sorry, Brother Wang.” Elder Hu didn’t know what to say.

Some young members in the sect also gossiped about this issue, albeit without true malice. Elder Hu and the seniors felt bad for him but he insisted on doing so.

“This is no big deal, my old bones are still tough.” Weiqiao said happily.

In reality, he was no stranger to jeers and sneers. In his first decades as a cultivator, he had suffered numerous setbacks and torment. There was no fatal danger but the psychological trauma could be too much for most.

As time passed, he became steadier and more resolute, able to accept the reality of life.

“Such a clean cut, well done.” Li Qiye picked up a block of firewood and took a look.

The block was perfectly split down the middle. The surface was smooth as if it had been polished.

From the gathering process to the split was a work of art - even distribution of power and flawless trajectory.

“You’re too kind, Sect Master. I’m merely used to it after eight to ten years, that’s all.” Weiqiao smiled. There was something about his physique that made it appear in tune with nature.

“Well said, that’s the same with cultivation as well, just have to get used to it.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Get used to it?” Both the old men repeated.

“But the grand dao requires comprehension. It’s too profound and mysterious.” Weiqiao disagreed.

“How does one comprehend the grand dao?” Li Qiye asked.

“From training with merit laws.” Weiqiao answered right away.

“Then where did merit laws come from? Did they fall from the sky?” Li Qiye continued.

“Of course not, they were created from the wise ones before us.” Elder Hu joined in.

“These created merit laws didn’t just appear out of thin air. This required observing the mysteries of the world and feeling the rhythm of the earth and the cycles of reality. These are the sources of merit laws.”

Elder Hu and Weiqiao didn’t understand yet and exchanged glances of confusion.

“I don’t quite comprehend what you are saying, Sect Master. Please enlighten me.” Weiqiao bowed.

“Tell me why you do such a good job at splitting firewood.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Doing it often and getting familiar with the process. Isn’t this rather simple?” Weiqiao said.

“When did it become so simple and easy?” Li Qiye asked.

“Well…” Weiqiao thought about it before answering: “Wood has grain, I just have to aim at one of them and it’ll split right away.”

“The fundamental here is finding the grain pattern, everything became easier after you realized this, a cleaner split with perfect firewood. It’s more than just repetition, no?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Thank you for your guidance, Sect Master.” Weiqiao felt something flashing in his head and immediately bowed.

Li Qiye accepted the gesture and continued: “You cultivate Chaos.”

“Your vision is second to none, Sect Master.” Weiqiao stood up straight again and praised: “It’s shameful but the sect did try to give me a different merit law when I first joined. Alas, I was too foolish to comprehend it so I had no choice but to cultivate the simplest mantra. Even then, what I’ve attained is negligible.”

“Don’t blame yourself, Brother Wang, no one was more diligent than you in the past. Your effort puts all the youths to shame, you’ve been a great role model for them all.” Elder Hu hurriedly added.

“People say that the clumsy bird flies early. Unfortunately, my effort isn’t enough to compensate for my limited abilities.” Weiqiao replied.

He wasn’t angry and frustrated at himself or anything. This was merely the truth. Chaos was one of the seven mantras, as simple as can be.

Every sect had access to a copy since it was widespread around the world. It was the cheapest merit law in terms of getting started with cultivation. The thing lacking was power.

Weiqiao spent decades training but had limited achievements. Others thought that he wasn’t suitable for cultivation.

“Effort will always be rewarded.” Li Qiye said: “Do you wish to keep on cultivating?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Sect Master, I hated my talentless self once and even thought about giving up. However, I’ve gotten my foot into the door and can’t give up. It doesn’t matter how far I go, I’ll keep on trying for the rest of my life. At the very least, I won’t be letting myself down by giving up and can rest at peace when the time comes.” Weiqiao answered with a smile.

“Well said.” Li Qiye nodded then stared straight at the old man to say: “I rarely take in disciples. Kneel, worship me as your teacher.”

“I…” Weiqiao was caught off guard by this suggestion.

Elder Hu felt the same way, not expecting Li Qiye’s disciple recruitment attempt.

There were several capable disciples in Little Diamond. They weren’t supreme geniuses or anything but a few weren’t bad at all. However, Li Qiye didn’t take any of them in.

This seemed like a rather strange choice due to Weiqiao’s lack of talent. There was a considerable age gap in the opposite direction as well.

“No one dares to question your understanding of the dao, Sect Master. Unfortunately, I’m afraid I would only be wasting your time. There are several young ones that are worthy to be under your tutelage.” Weiqiao regained his wits and answered.

He would rather Li Qiye spend his time more productively guiding the youths with the most potential.

“I can grant others fortunes but only a few are worthy of my tutelage. Kneel.” Li Qiye repeated in a cool manner.

Weiqiao and the elder exchanged glances, confused about the situation.

“Very well, I will commence a ceremony to inform everyone about this.” The elder suggested.

“No need for that, secular conventions aren’t necessary.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Shou-should I? I do not want to besmirch your reputation, Sect Master.” Weijiao hesitated.

He had a master in the past but due to his sluggish cultivation speed, their relationship was annulled.
