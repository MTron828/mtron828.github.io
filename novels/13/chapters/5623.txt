Chapter 5624: Powerful

The golden dragon didn’t stop flying despite the chains, attempting to break the supreme sequence with its sharp claws.0

Demon Conqueror picked up another star and changed it into the temporal affinity, placing it on the cosmic board.0

Billions and billions of years rushed in Titanic Conqueror’s direction. The golden dragon and everything in front of her board became engulfed by this withering affinity.0

Titanic was surrounded in all directions, having to face this timespan wherever she went. She needed to break through or she would be lost in it and die in due time.0

“Not bad!” Titanic displayed excitement instead of anxiety after having found a capable opponent.0

“Go!” She channeled her primordial power, playing a particular dao.0

It started as small as a boat before giving birth to myriad laws and arts. They came together to create a portal, allowing the boat to travel through the billion years.0

Traveling through this timespan would prove to be impossible for many. Those capable of making the full journey would find their vitality and lifespan depleted.0

However, her special boat crossed through the temporal expanse in the blink of an eye. She appeared in front of Demon and took the initiative - playing another piece.1

It contained the karma of an entire world and its inhabitants along with an overarching momentum built throughout the ages. This combination was destructive and deadly.0

“Bang!” Demon created a pillar connecting heaven and earth. Her thoughts became the will of the high heaven - something transcending all else. This summoned something akin to a dreadful heavenly tribulation.0

“Rumble!” Visual phenomena appeared above Thousand Emperor Island.0

They weren’t the gateways any longer but rather, the various moves employed by Demon and Titanic Conqueror. The world and all within were used as their pieces.0

One included an immortal sword only to be countered by a boundless azure. Spectators couldn’t stay calm while trying to keep up.0

Although they were fighting in a separate domain, remnant waves still oozed out and forced everyone onto the ground.0

The fight was visually magnificent but only top cultivators could truly understand the mystical changes on the board. They carefully observed the fight, wanting to see the combatants’ techniques and grand dao.1

One conqueror became greedy and activated his dao fruits defensively. He summoned his imperial weapon as well, wanting to enter the supreme domain.0

“Boom!” Although he had twelve dao fruits and a mighty weapon, he was met by the untethered shockwaves from the battle.3

They blasted him out of the domain, causing him to collide with an island below and shattering it into pieces. Towering waves emanated from the impact.0

It took a while before he managed to climb back up, spewing blood continuously. Every bone in his body was shattered so he swayed unsteadily, unable to stand straight.0

Others learned a lesson from his failure and didn’t dare to come closer. Just one mistake and they would be reduced to blood.0

“Who will win?” Those capable of observing the match had this question on their mind.0

Of course, the majority cheered for Demon Conqueror since her defeat would be terrible for Imperial Field.0

They knew that one day, Celestial Court would extend its reach to their region. This battle might just be a prelude.0

They also understood that it wasn’t easy for Demon Conqueror to win. Titanic was already an apex cultivator, not to mention the immortal bone and primordial dao fruit.0

It was amazing that Demon Conqueror could make the fight even. She was a true genius with few peers. 0

“Rumble!” The quakes became increasingly violent. The entire region was on the verge of capsizing despite the barriers.0𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

If the two continued, their independent domain might explode and that would spell the demise of Thousand Emperor Island.0

Meanwhile, the battle reached its climax. Visual phenomena appeared as they utilized their strongest abilities. Time and space were being melted. It was only a matter of time before the collapse of the domain.0

“Should we run?” This became the new question for spectators below.0

There was a metaphorical mountain hanging on a thread above them. When the thread gave in, they would be smashed to smithereens.0

However, they saw someone appearing in the sky - an ordinary youth walking toward the supreme domain.3

“Who is he?!” This shocked spectators.0

“Is this brat tired of living? That domain will crush him!” A big shot shouted.0

Remember, a conqueror with twelve dao fruit suffered grievous injuries a while back, let alone this young man.0

“He’s…” A Grand Emperor had a serious expression after seeing Li Qiye.
