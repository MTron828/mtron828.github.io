Chapter 5906: Different Goal, Different Path

The three voices didn’t respond.

“Fine, who do you want me to kill?” Li Qiye smiled.

The three voices took their time, seemingly unwilling to discuss this topic.

“A person who seeks the heaven.” The pleasant voice broke the silence.

“Didn’t seem like there was anyone like that in Three Immortals.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Later on.” The eye said.

“Let me guess, it has to do with you three.” Li Qiye smiled.

After a brief silence, the pleasant voice spoke again: “Yes, we were the masters.”

A sigh and a scowl came from the other two beings afterward.

“A combined effort?” Li Qiye said seriously: “That’s not your style or it would have been done long ago, you three have your reasons for refraining.”

“Someone else joined the fray with the brat and defeated the three immortals.” The eye said: “Therefore, I thought a battle was inevitable.”

“We have limitations.” The pleasant voice said helplessly: “There are too many conditions needing to be met for us to take action.”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“And so you three wanted a replacement, teaming up to train a disciple.” Li Qiye said.

“They marched to our gates, we couldn’t be on the defensive forever.” The deep voice responded.

“I see, the pain of being betrayed.” Li Qiye nodded: “So much effort for naught.”

“Painstaking effort and time.” The eye said before letting out a sigh of disappointment and sadness.

These beings came from above, possessing enough prestige and power to be called “immortals”.

They had lived as long as existence itself, having experienced numerous trials and tribulations. Nevertheless, this betrayal still left a scar on their iron-clad heart.

“Hearts are made of flesh, not iron, you’re no exception.” Li Qiye nodded.

The three of them had maintained independence all of these years. However, they broke this rule, working together to train a disciple capable enough to deal with a particular enemy.

This disciple made them proud and earned their affection after so much time spent together. They had been unattached from the rest of the world but lost emotions surfaced once more.

“Taking in a disciple was quite an exception, but to have feelings of masters? How unbelievable.” Li Qiye said sentimentally.

“Indeed.” All three sighed in disappointment.

“Mortals say those at the top are emotionless and ruthless. Perhaps it’s just that no one could get close enough to find out otherwise.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“No need to dwell on this. You shall kill him.” The deep voice remarked.

“A bone-deep hatred.” Li Qiye stared at them and said: “So your disciple was the reason, and here I thought the brat took you three down and forced you out. Looks like your patience ran out after today.”

“One wrong step and we were exposed, necessitating a departure.” The eye lamented.

“Betrayal and exposure, I wonder how the brat convinced your disciple to switch sides.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Well, let’s look at the bright side, at least you’re preserved your lives, right? It’s like moving to a new home.” Li Qiye said.

“You make it sound so easy. If it wasn’t for Heavenly Sin, we would have been dragged down too.” The pleasant voice recalled.

“Heavenly Sin was reduced to dust.” The eye lamented.

“So out of the six of you, three are hiding here, Sin died in battle. The other two, Devil and Darkness, are in opposition?” Li Qiye asked. [1]

“Not quite, a different goal necessitated a different path.” The pleasant voice said.

“If that’s the case for them, what about your disciple?” Li Qiye asked.

“We don’t have an answer to this question.” The pleasant voice responded.

“Tempting conditions or items shouldn’t have worked.” Li Qiye said: “Not with you three as masters, your riches were beyond anything he could offer.”

“The heart can always be tempted.” The deep voice snorted.

“Might not be something. The heart is so unreadable.” Li Qiye had a smirk on his face.

“So are you helping or not?” The deep voice asked again.

Li Qiye waved his hand: “Perhaps your grudge and hatred can only be unraveled by your own hands.”

The three didn’t respond and agreed with the logic. Slaying the traitor with their own hands would certainly be the best feeling.

1. These names could be changed later once I get the full context. Not going entirely literal until then but they are the six lords of the Redemption Grounds ☜
