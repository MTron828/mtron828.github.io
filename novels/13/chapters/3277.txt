Huang Jie had his reasons for worrying. The children from Liu had an amazing foundation, meaning that there was great potential there.

They were excellent seeds from the perspective of Eight Zhang. They could join it later on and become pillars with enough grooming and training.

They still had choices when it came to merit laws. However, Liu Fuyou wanted more for them, that’s why he came to ask Li Qiye.

In the beginning, the two assumed that Li Qiye would come up with an incredible plan, one that certainly wouldn’t include Tortoise Fist.

“Fine, we’ll follow the young master’s guidance and let them learn it.” Fuyou gritted his teeth and made up his mind.

Hesitation persisted but he chose to believe in Li Qiye who managed to cure his affliction, unlike the others. Moreover, Li Qiye had done such a good job with the children in a short period of time, turning them into exceptional seeds.

Thus, there was no reason to doubt him.

Huang Jie opened his mouth but refrained from speaking up. Though the children weren’t officially Fuyou’s disciples, they were pretty much that. He brought them to Divine Black and had the right to make decisions for them.

“Okay, bring them tomorrow and I will personally teach them. What they accomplish after is up to their own fortune.” Li Qiye calmly said.

“Great, I’ll bring them here tomorrow.” Fuyou happily agreed.

Li Qiye only taught them a little bit yet they have gained so much. Now, he was going to teach them a merit law? Fuyou immediately realized that they have nearly missed a great opportunity.

“Quicksand River.” Li Qiye smiled and turned his focus back on the surviving river. He then glanced at the ancestral peak one more time before leaving.

“We’re leaving.” He said.

The duo hurriedly followed behind him.

Along the way, they suddenly heard a poof and saw a flame rushing out from the top of a peak. It had three colors filled with divinity and dao power along with chaos true energy.

The scorching temperature seemed to be re-arranging heaven and earth, capable of incinerating a large hole in the sky.

Fortunately, this raging fire was under perfect control thanks to the majestic dao power. It didn’t hurt anything nearby, not even a blade of grass.

“Samadhi Flame. A really strong type.” The duo became startled.

They weren’t the only ones. Many experts in Divine Black took note of this, including the elders and peak lords.

“That’s the training place of that girl?” Huang Jie carefully judged the direction of the flame.

“Yes, looks like she has reached the Samadhi Materialization level now, no longer an Enlightened Being. Amazing, that’s an inborn true fate for you. The purity of that flame is not inferior to First Brother’s back then.” Fuyou became sentimental.

“We’re old now.” Huang Jie smiled wryly, feeling a bit frustrated.

After all, being caught up to by a junior wasn’t a good feeling. Huang Jie was an upper-tier cultivator during his generation. He worked hard but was still only an intermediate Enlightened Being.

Fuyou was even more talented yet he was stuck at Conqueror Vessel right now. But ultimately, even without his dao problem, he wouldn’t have been as good as her if they were the same age.

The samadhi realm was quite powerful. No one else among the young generation had reached it in Divine Black.

In fact, there were just very few cultivators at this level. They were strong enough to uphold some real responsibilities.

“We watched her join not long ago, now she has surpassed us.” Fuyou added.

As for Li Qiye, he only took one look and smiled, not paying it any mind.

The others in the sect became emotional at this sight after seeing the flame. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Nothing can stop the young generation from excelling. She’ll leave us behind in the dust in just a few years.” Mountainbearer King on top of Eight Zhang took note of this.

“She’ll be the second in our sect to reach the sacred physique level, maybe a heavenly sovereign...” The bodhi king in Thousand Demons commented.

“You might be faster, Peak Lord.” A disciple nearby said.

The king didn’t respond. He stared at the flame and fell into rumination.

Iron Rod Demon King in Furious Tiger also saw this. He had no choice but to praise Gong Qianyue even though she was a human: “Simply incredible, this girl is definitely superior to Su Xu.”

“All the good disciples are taken!” He then glared over at South Conch and scowled.

Qianyue seemed unstoppable right now; her momentum was on an upward trajectory. She would definitely become the next successor of the sect if she could reach the sacred physique level.

This would truly pressure the demons in Divine Black. Both Furious Tiger and Thousand Demons Peak would have no way to compete against South Conch.

“Samadhi Materialization...” Zhang Yue on Jade Bird carefully observed the flame: “The number one of the young generation.” He had no choice but to admit this.

His expression became serious. He knew that it was only a matter of time before she surpassed him at this rate.

His position would be up for grab then. Maybe he would need to abdicate and become an elder instead. As the future successor, she wouldn’t take over the sect master’s role so quickly. She would need to gain more experience as a peak lord. Thus, among the five current peak lords, he was the most likely to lose his position.

“Damn this inborn true fate!” He became very annoyed because this constitution has been a thorn in his side.

In the past, he was the oldest of the three geniuses but Su Xu surpassed him because he also had an inborn true fate!

Gong Qianyue was repeating the same thing. No, she seemed even stronger than Su Xu at the same age.

“They’re really the heaven’s favorites.” He eventually said.

He was quite powerful already as a member of the second generation, being a Yin Yang Celestial. He really earned his spot as a peak lord despite certain circumstances.

Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough to compete with Qianyue. Someone like her had such an easy time with cultivation.

“Senior Sister Qianyue is at the Samadhi Materialization realm now!” This news spread across the sect like wildfire.

“She’s the best in our sect.” Even the most talented disciples couldn’t do naught but accept inferiority.

For example, mighty youths such as Zhang Hu and Huang Ning became dejected while staring at the flame above.
