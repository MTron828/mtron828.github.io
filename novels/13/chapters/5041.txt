Chapter 5042: Trust In His Disciple

The youths stared at Li Qiye, wondering if they should tell him the answer. How would he react after knowing?

“Who do you think it is?” Li Qiye answered with a question.

The two didn’t answer since they didn’t wish to harm anyone’s reputation. Their words carried immense influence so people would take them seriously.

“We do not know right now.” Truth shook her head.

Li Qiye smirked and said: “I’m sure you have your suspects. Who was the first to pop up in your mind?”

Truth glanced over at the sovereign who remained silent.

Li Qiye stared at him and said: “Sovereign, I feel like you have a suspect already, and for a long time now.”

The youths became as tense as can be, awaiting a response from the sovereign. The sovereign only sighed because Li Qiye was right.

“I’m sure we both know I am talking about your disciple.” Others didn’t dare to break this veil of pretense but not Li Qiye.

The sovereign staggered backward since this was another piece of clue pointing at Phenomena Conqueror.

“Dao Brother, this is a serious accusation.” Truth said softly but wore a serious expression.

The youths didn’t dare to say anything, wondering if Thousand-faced Venerable would either become furious or try to hide his disciple’s crime by attempting to silence everyone here.

“Fellow Daoist, please watch your words.” The sovereign closed his eyes and placed his palms together.

“I didn’t say that he was the culprit.” Li Qiye smiled: “I’m just asking if you are suspecting him.”

“I saw him grow up and he is not the one, I stake my life on it.” Thousand-faced solemnly answered.

Li Qiye was moved to see this: “It is a blessing of three lifetimes to have a master such as yourself.”

“But Phenomena is missing indeed, that’s why I am searching for clues.” Thousand-faced responded.

“We did not see Phenomena Conqueror among the corpses.” Ming Shi finally spoke.

The sovereign stared at her and she lowered her head instantly.

“Are you certain that he did not go up?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes, I would have known for certain.” The sovereign nodded.

“Interesting. Could be good or bad.” Li Qiye commented on the circumstances.

“Good in what way?” Truth asked.

“Good as in he was still here and has been consumed.” Li Qiye said.

“...” The youths didn’t know what to say. How was that a good outcome?

“How is this good?” Thousand-faced Sovereign asked.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“If the culprit had eaten your disciple, it means that their taste will be more selective. Ordinary dragon lords won’t be worth the time, meaning a long hibernation might be necessary first.”

The two masters exchanged glances.

“What about the bad possibility?” Thousand-faced asked.

Li Qiye stared at him and said: “You know the answer to this already.”

Thousand-faced paused for a moment before letting out a sigh.

Li Qiye then told Truth: “If I were you, I would ascend to the upper continents right now. Staying here isn’t the solution, you need to face it.”

The youths have heard of her background before. Wouldn’t ascending make her a target for the alliances up there? Celestial Court still wanted retribution.

“I will keep your advice in mind, Dao Brother.” She bowed slightly.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything else and left with the youths.

After they were gone, Truth asked: “Sovereign, what is your plan?”

“Fellow Daoist Li is right, you are in danger.” Thousand-faced responded: “You should go back now, I will let you know immediately if I gain new information.”

“That’s fine.” She said: “Maybe it is truly time for me to leave.”

Shadowrider led the group into a forest with massive trees and blinding fog. This prevented the majority of cultivators from entering since it resembled a labyrinth.

“Here?” Goldcrest became serious.

“You know where this is?” Yunyun asked.

“I believe this is the base of Mist.” Goldcrest said.

“Is the founder god around?” Ming Shi was curious.

“No, the founder god is not in Demon.” Goldcrest responded.

“I thought the founder gods couldn’t leave Demon.” Both Ming Shi and Yunyun were surprised.

“Remember, this is just what I’ve been told, I haven’t met any of them before. But the only exception to this rule should be Demon Conqueror.” Goldcrest said.

“Wait, you’re not making sense. If they can’t leave Demon, where else can they be but here?” Ming Shi said.

“One theory is that they are staying in the divine nest.” Goldcrest said.

“I see, so founder gods can enter?” Ming Shi asked.

“This is all beyond my level.” Goldcrest said.

At this point, they were taken to the entrance. Shadowrider said: “My mission is complete, this is it.”

“Good.” Li Qiye nodded.

With that, Shadowrider gradually dispersed and disappeared from sight. Next, someone came out of the fog and scared the youths.

They were surprised due to his appearance, especially the striking similarity to Shadowrider. However, he chose to reveal his form.

“Nightwalker.” Goldcrest blurted out the title.

“Y-you look really familiar to Shadowrider, are you brothers?” Ming Shi asked with uncertainty.
