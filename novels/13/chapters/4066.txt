Chapter 4067: Blood Progenitor

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

A man made of blood was terrifying enough. However, the fear instilled by him into others was primal and instinctive.

He resembled the Blood Progenitor from the ancient era. Even his soul seemed to be made of blood - a creature born from this affinity.

Everything else in the world was nothing more than food in his eyes. He also had four fangs now. They weren’t particularly long but nothing could be sharper or more intimidating. This was in spite of Li Qiye not activating his divinity and aura.

There were other evil creatures and villains in the vast world. Just their name or title alone would frighten grown men. However, to personally witness Li Qiye was an entirely different experience.

Spectators would tremble and quiver uncontrollably, realizing that the evil cultivators they had seen before were nothing in comparison.

He became the ruler of the darkness and the embodiment of malice. Thus, the Vampyric Dyad felt the same fear from the depth of their heart. He was their worst nightmare.

Ning Zhu gasped in response while Liu Yushang’s jaw dropped to the ground in disbelief.

He thought that Li Qiye was a weak cultivator who got lucky. But now, this state of his was horrifying. He himself was an experienced cultivator who had traveled the world yet his legs were still shaking.

“Brat, this act doesn’t fool anyone. You’re displaying your slight skills before real experts.” One of the two shouted: “Your blood is mine!”

He was trembling inside but didn’t think that this was anything more than a physical transformation. It was impossible for the youth to turn into a supreme devil king.

“Screech!” He let out a roar and turned into a blood bat, wanting to bite Li Qiye’s neck.

“Fool.” Li Qiye scowled and released his divinity. His eyes became bright red like two suns. The force coming from them rushed towards the assailant. The progenitor of the race had total control over his descendants.

Blood took over the spatial fabrics and time came to a halt. The assailant found his soul to be under someone else’s control, akin to a servant in front of the king.

After immobilizing his prey, Li Qiye opened his mouth and aimed for the neck.

“No!!!” The victim bellowed in horror while looking at Li Qiye’s sharp fangs. They have always been the ones doing the blood sucking, never the opposite. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Sucking and swallowing noises ensued. It was as if Li Qiye had inserted a straw into the victim’s bloodstream.

“Nooo.” The victim struggled and twitched but it was too late. With the last drop of blood drained, his legs kicked out one last time before being summoned by death.

“Sh*t!” The other was scared out of his mind and immediately fled.

“Where do you think you’re going?” Li Qiye appeared in front of him, raising one hand to immobilize the next victim.

“No…” The latter could only speak, unable to move anything else.

Li Qiye revealed his fangs again for another bite.

“Please! Nooo!” The last of the dyad begged for mercy, albeit a little too late. He became a dried corpse as well.

The duo’s eyes were still open as they lay on the ground. They had done the same to countless victims in the past, never expecting karma to strike back.

“What the hell…” Yushang turned pale and crouched down while feeling awfully nauseous.

“The idiots know nothing about the origin of the Blood Race yet they dare to act like they’re progenitors, this is their just deserts.” Li Qiye licked his lips, looking quite dreadful.

“You’re, you’re a devil king?” Yushang calmed down and pointed at Li Qiye. His finger was trembling.

The harmless rich guy turned out to be a terrible monster with enough power to instantly kill the Vampyric Dyad. No one would believe this story.

“Says who?” Li Qiye smiled and became normal again. The thick blood around him flowed to the ground and disappeared from sight.

The aghast Yushang found this process akin to Li Qiye just taking off his clothes. The whole thing was surreal, like a dream. However, the dried corpses of the dyad were still there.

“What sor-sorcery did you employ?” Yushang asked. There was no evil aura left on Li Qiye.

“Sorcery? No, this is a transformation with a single thought. Tell me, what do you respect or fear the most?” Li Qiye smiled at the youth.
