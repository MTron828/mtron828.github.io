Chapter 5051: Divine Bestowment

As the voice and laughter infiltrated their mind, they felt as if they were losing control of their body to him. Fear overwhelmed them immediately.

Nightwalker and the other commanding gods didn’t expect this development. This was a founder god - a being above them.

Moreover, they heard certain rumors and legends about him. This was especially true for Vine God who had more knowledge than anyone else.

“The old geezers wanted to seal me but I am finally free, haha! I shall destroy their deity branches and afterward, there shall be only one and I will be the only god.” He declared.

Listeners immediately understood that he was sealed by the other founder gods. Nightwalker and the others already knew about this.

It was due to the evil god’s insatiable appetite, always consuming the other beasts and demons of the Ten Great Mountains.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Because of this, the other founder gods had no choice but to seal him. Alas, he was freed now due to Bloodfly God and Li Qiye.

“Golden Mosquito, the other gods will seal you again, you shall never see the light of day soon.” Vine God responded.

“Haha, they won’t have the chance, I will destroy their branches and prevent them from leaving the divine nest. They shall be next once I rule over the world.” Golden Mosquito declared.

“Go!” Vine God didn’t want to waste time and summoned his divine tablet.

“Activate!” Nightwalker, Lunar Rabbit, Dream Monarch, and even the near-death Peacock Monarch did the same.

Their tablets exuded a holy light along with deafening howls. This had a deterring effect on all creatures from Demon, causing them to drop to the ground and tremble.

Their individual runes lit up - a golden serpent, a great tree, and a peng blotting out the sun…

“Boom!” A divine power gushed out from their tablets and summoned the actual thing after loud explosions.

“Look!” The demons and beasts bowed before the real tablet.

As the real tablet emerged, its supreme power engulfed the entire region.

“Seal!” Golden Mosquito also made his move, aiming his numerous legs at the various tablets belonging to the commanding gods.

The impact clanks were metallic as if swords were hitting rocks. His frontal legs struck the actual tablet, wanting to seal it.

“They’re trying to summon the founder gods.” Li Qiye commented.

“Will they actually come?” Ming Shi became emotional.

No one here had seen the founder gods before with the exception of Golden Mosquito. Thus, this kept everyone on their feet.

“Descend!” Vine God’s roar echoed; his allies did the same.

“Boom!” The true tablet became blindingly bright. The sun itself paled in comparison.

“Rumble!” Majestic figures appeared and could be seen looming above the three continents.

A golden serpent was above all and took the form of a peerless emperor whose hands could grasp the three continents.

A peng had wings large enough to cover the nine heavens and ten earths. It seemed capable of swallowing the stars.

A divine monkey also showed up and leaped up higher than the firmaments. Its spirituality and energy were comparable to three thousand worlds and all of their inhabitants.

Their divine powers pushed down against Golden Mosquito, causing creaking noises. This evil god was immensely powerful but still had a hard time dealing with this oppressive force.

“Surrender!” Vine God shouted, still taking charge of the situation despite not being present.

If conquerors were here, they would be shocked because just this summoning had enough power to suppress a divine god.

“It’s too late!” Golden Mosquito roared and pierced through the dimensions with his stingers: “Show yourself now!”

“Ahh!” Vine God bellowed in agony. Mountains suddenly crumbled and trees were flipped over. Massive vines and branches were forced out of the ground.

“That’s him!” Spectators shouted.

Vine God’s true form was finally seen - a frame large enough to cover all of the Ten Great Mountains.
