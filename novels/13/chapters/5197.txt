Chapter 5198: Wondrous Flower

No one from Alchemy Dao had seen pills of this level before. Not to mention regular cultivators, even conquerors and monarchs could only dream of them.

The highest quality remedies were only seen back during the era of their progenitor, Heavenly Sage Yuan.

“I read that the progenitor refined a bottle during Immemorial Epoch War for the emperors and another for Grand Dao War. Both were used up by the injured combatants.” Panacea’s voice trembled.

“We are looking at some now.” Gourdkeeper was overwhelmed emotionally.

The servant took a deep breath after seeing them. This was something usable by him and apex conquerors.

True Bear let out a cry as well. Because of his previous recklessness, he nearly became insane. If he had this pill back then, all complications would have been prevented.

“Fine, you can have some.” Li Qiye took the gourd and poured some pills into his palm. He then tossed some to the servant and True Bear.

The two caught the pills and carefully put them away - the opposite of Li Qiye’s carefree toss. They then bowed to show gratitude.

Gourdkeeper and Panacea didn’t have a problem with this. Although the materials belonged to Alchemy Dao, Li Qiye had certainly saved their entire sect.

“Thank you, Young Noble, we will erect a shrine dedicated in your honor.” They and the elders bowed to show respect.

“No need for a shrine, just fulfill your responsibility by training better, that’s the best way to repay me. Stop besmirching your progenitor’s prestige.” Li Qiye stared at them and said.

The old men’s face grew hot with embarrassment. This was their first time being looked down upon with regard to alchemy.

They were considered the authority of this branch - always teaching others, never being taught until now.

Alas, he sounded like a teacher who was disappointed in his incapable students. They had no choice but to nod in agreement.

“Young Noble, could you teach us your peerless pill-making art?” Gourdkeeper was familiar with Li Qiye and shamelessly asked.

Li Qiye glared at him in response: “Your progenitor had taught you the heavenly flame control art already. You all failed to recognize her kind intention by doing a terrible job at training.”

“Yes.” They all nodded respectfully, not daring to talk back.

“We are idiots indeed, to miss the legendary technique.” Panacea sighed.

“Not quite idiots, just greedy and short-sighted for focusing on secret laws before mastering the basics.” Li Qiye said.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Thank you for your guidance, Young Noble.” Panacea said: “We will educate the young disciples better and learn from this ourselves. We will not besmirch Alchemy Dao’s reputation.”

“I’m not interested in what you do with the sect. I’m leaving after getting the lotus.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“What lotus?” Panacea didn’t understand.

Gourdkeeper then explained Li Qiye’s purpose for coming to Alchemy Dao. If it were anyone else, Panacea would have become livid at this outrageous request. Alas, they couldn’t refuse Li Qiye.

“We have agreed to give you a flower, Young Noble. We’ll report this to the sect master later.” Panacea said after a brief discussion with Gourdkeeper.

With that, he ordered someone to fetch a flower. Now with a short break, he sighed and reflected on the death of his disciple.

“Silly child.” He wanted to bury the saint child but there was virtually nothing left but scattering ashes.

A while later, the exalted lotus was taken to Li Qiye.

This one had blossomed; its petals resembled pieces of exquisite jade. They were warm to the touch; the pistil exuded a five-colored radiance along with special strands of dao laws. They resembled heavenly waterfalls and were always changing their shape.

There was an indistinct fragrance that required someone to get close. Despite its faint nature, it was unforgettable and could rid someone of their worries. Its purification nature could bring anyone back to the light.

“A wondrous flower.” Li Qiye sniffed and commented.

“Young Noble, will you stay at Alchemy Dao for a while?” The two ancient ancestors wanted him to stick around.

They wanted to learn more techniques from him for the sake of the sect. Unfortunately, he had no intention of staying after obtaining the lotus flower.

As he was leaving, warning gongs resounded across the sect.

“Enemies?” Panacea’s expression darkened.

“Rumble!” Bright barriers emerged in the air.

Alas, the intruders were too fast and made it through the barriers before they were fully formed.

Panacea and Gourdkeeper became alarmed and leaped into the air as well. They blocked the way and saw two intruders - one old and one young.

The first left behind a fiery trail, looking like the tail of a phoenix. The temperature increased rapidly as space was on the verge of melting.

The fiery trail turned out to be an actual tail belonging to a middle-aged man.
