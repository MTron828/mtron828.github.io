Chapter 5303: Uncontrollable Pieces

“It’s no big deal, just another boulder on top of many.” The man poured another cup for Li Qiye.

“Your suffering continues.” Li Qiye sighed.

“One wrong move and that’s it, all the planning after many eras will be for naught. Can you wait that long again?” He asked.

“I’m afraid my patience is running out.” The gleam in Li Qiye’s eyes could destroy all realms.

“Only one step left, and we’re here to help.” He said.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye sipped the tea and said softly: “Everything is going well?”

“The bait has been taken by most.” He said with a serious expression: “Not quite perfect yet though, Primogenitor hasn’t swallowed the bait fully.”

“So a little more nudging.” Li Qiye said.

“What about Evolution?” He paused for a bit before asking.

“That’s the interesting part. If all the fish have swallowed the bait, Evolution is not far.” Li Qiye said.

“Don’t forget that this is one of the smartest beings.” He said sincerely.

“Yes, but also crazy.” Li Qiye said: “Crazy people love crazy events, and once they’re caught in their own frenzy, they’ll become overconfident.”

“We still have to be sure that the baits are irresistible.” He remained cautious.

Li Qiye nodded in agreement: “Just have to help them bite a bit harder and then we can pull the net.”

“We cannot afford to make a single mistake.” He realized how important the mission was.

“You’ll have to keep enduring then.” Li Qiye said.

“Someone has to take up the hard jobs and plus, I don’t have the worst one. The brat is the one suffering the most.” The man said with a wry smile.

“Yes, it’s a noble sacrifice.” Li Qiye contemplated for a bit before nodding.

“He willingly chose to do so and must endure the consequences. It will be justified in the end.” He said.

“Don’t worry, this won’t be for nothing once we pull the net.” Li Qiye said confidently.

“Trinity is dealt with, what about everyone else?” He wasn’t as optimistic.

“It is indeed a problem. I do have an idea, it just needs further polishing. Voracious Leviathan and Epoch’s End must be dragged into this as well.” Li Qiye said.

“What if they know better? Then all of our efforts would have been in vain.” He remained worried.

“Once we make it that far, it won’t be up to them.” Li Qiye said confidently.

“We must destroy all of them in one go.” He nodded.

“We need a big bait for all the big fish, and Trinity will do.” Li Qiye said.

“Any other potential complication?” He asked.

Li Qiye gazed deep into space and said: “Twilight Hunter.”

He became tense after hearing this name and murmured: “The supreme hunter…”

“It will be fine, I’ll be able to handle anyone. I’m just afraid that they won’t come.” Li Qiye said.

“He hasn’t appeared in a long time, there are no trails left. Who knows if he is still around?” He responded.

“Others might have disappeared for a multitude of reasons, but not Twilight Hunter. The question is, is this worth his time and effort?” Li Qiye said.

“It’s been so long since the matter of Divine Ancestor. I don’t think the patient Twilight Hunter will take the risk.” He shook his head.

“We will just have to make it impossible to resist.” Li Qiye said.

“This won’t work, you will not be able to lure him out. The problem is that in this epoch, you are the absolute master, not to mention you are a returner from above. It doesn’t matter how delicious you are, Twilight Hunter will just wait for you to leave. Other meals might not be as delightful but still enough to satiate his appetite.” He disagreed.

“That’s the crux of the problem.” Li Qiye smiled: “The best of feasts is too obvious, he will wonder if it’s a trap.”

“What can we do then? Even if we get rid of everyone else, Twilight Hunter will always be there.” He said.

“We’ll kill them all, Leviathan, Epoch’s End, and Twilight Hunter. I won’t allow these insects to linger in my epoch.” Li Qiye said with murderous intent and conviction before pausing for a bit.

“Well, I do have a plan.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “We already have incredible baits, it’s about the execution.”

“He will not do anything with you around.” He said.

“Don’t be so sure, the baits from beyond the heaven are just too enticing. Be ready for some surprises.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Perhaps.” He didn’t wish to be pessimistic any longer.

The two of them drank the tea quietly for a while before the man asked: “So what happened? Who is this unknown guest? This wasn’t part of your plan.”

Li Qiye sighed and shook his head: “Even the most perfect plan will have some flaws revealed with due time. I’m not sure if I would have done anything differently.”

“You know now, and you have made a deal.” He speculated.

“Not yet, but time waits for no one.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“The end of one game is the start of another, when will it end?” He asked.

Li Qiye took his time thinking before replying: “It is getting closer. Maybe the answer will be there after two more games.”

“And this epoch?” He asked.

“I planted the tree not for the fruits. If there are fruits, they belong to the tree, not me.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“Who will guard this tree and its fruits then?” He asked with a solemn expression.

“The tree is fully grown and the fruits are ripe, the insects will be removed as well. I don’t want to be a gardener or a savior forever.” Li Qiye smiled.

He pondered for a bit before staring at Li Qiye: “You are willing to do so?”

“That’s the difference between you and me. You wish to shoulder the heaven while I am only passing by, anything else is a byproduct of my goal.” Li Qiye responded.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“This is your home.” He said.

“It is, but I won’t be here forever.” Li Qiye nodded.

“What about her?” He asked.

“I have done what I should and carried out my promise. The future will be as she desires.” Li Qiye said softly.

“She is no longer around now.” His tone became aggressive.

“If she is still alive, I will make sure that she’ll be around.” Li Qiye took a sip of tea.

“You’re a bastard.” He scolded.

“Not the first time I’ve heard this from you, I don’t mind.” Li Qiye smiled wryly.

“Hmph.” He was clearly dissatisfied with Li Qiye.

“I’m just a passerby, it doesn’t matter who they are.” Li Qiye earnestly said.
