Chapter 4090: Emotionless

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

They finally got away from Li Qiye but their supposed savior killed them. As colors started leaving their face, blood also gushed out of their chest.

Struggling was useless. The weaker captives didn’t even have time to react and had no idea that death had come for them.

Nonetheless, some fish still escaped the net and was drenched in cold sweat. That was a trip to hell and back.

“Boom!” At the same time, treasures and weapons assaulted Ninth.

The two kings went mad after seeing their dead disciples and unleashed their strongest attacks.

“Boom!” The world shook violently with sparks flying akin to numerous volcanos erupting.

Alas, one could still hear the hymn of a sword through the cacophony. Ninth’s sword could pierce through the myriad realms.

Spectators saw a majestic grand dao as Ninth turned around with incredible speed and easily stopped everything with one move.

Two legions have launched their offense - this was devastating enough to destroy the region. However, Ninth’s horizontal slash served as an unbreakable barrier.

“Clank!” He shifted from defense into offense - one sword became thousands and thousands again.

An overwhelming net of swords engulfed the battlefield and massacred both legions. Tens of thousands died right away with gaping holes on their body.

“Second variation, Emotionless!” The previous ancestor gasped.

Ninth had only used two variations so far yet he still frightened the crowd with his brutality.

The two legions were here to invade the plain. They didn’t expect to lose more than half of their men in this manner.

“Retreat, maintain the lines!” Both kings ordered a regroup.

Blood dripped down the tip of Ninth’s sword as he stood and glanced at the corpses like a god of death. This didn’t affect his mental state.

Spectators thought that few in Sword Continent could be as merciless as him.

The air became tense. Both the combatants and the spectators held their breath. They had heard of Ninth before but seeing him in action was a different story.

The two kings had an ugly expression due to this unfavorable deviation from their initial plan. This was an unacceptable loss to both sects and Li Qiye was no longer the primary target.

“You have no regard for lives.” Celestial Ape Demon King stated, still feeling fear.

“Swords are meant to kill.” Ninth didn’t think much of it; everyone else besides him was no different than a corpse in his eyes.

Normally, people would chastise a mass murderer and brand him as a devil or monster. Such descriptions didn’t describe here. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ninth came to kill. Whether it be one or a million didn’t matter to him. There was a certain purity to his conduct.

“Your turn.” He told the survivors.

The demon king staggered backward and said: “Why must you kill the innocent? Just wait for a duel between you and the sect master!”

He clearly didn’t want to fight Ninth.

“Is he afraid?” A youth asked after seeing the imperious demon king act so cowardly.

“Not necessarily, he just doesn’t want to die for no reason. After all, Ninth is looking for Shi Yingxue.” An older expert said.

“Is there a difference? Shouldn’t he be helping her?” The youth whispered.

Most sects would never let anyone get close to their sect master without putting up a fight. Such a scenario would invoke solidarity and teamwork.

As for the demon king, he insisted on letting Shi Yingxue fight Ninth.

“Armament Mountain has two main factors.” The ancestor simply responded.

Sure enough, Shi Yingyue represented the branch belonging to Armament Dao Lord. Humans were in control of this branch. As for the demon king, he belonged to the God Ape Kingdom’s branch where demons had control.

Thus, Ninth’s challenge was actually good news. If Shi Yingxue were to die in battle, they would be able to take over. This was especially true for him, considering his post as the first elder.

Therefore, it would be idiotic for him to fight Ninth right now. There was a serious risk of dying. All of his effort to get to his current position would be in vain.

“Once again, Buddha will show up after I kill enough monks.” Ninth coldly said.

Since Shi Yingxue was in an isolated training session, he just needed to kill enough people to force her out.
