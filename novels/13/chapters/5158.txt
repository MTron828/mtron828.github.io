Chapter 5159: Seeing A Heaven’s Will Again

Most felt nothing but envy and respect for the two conquerors. Unfortunately, they were going to die here today, a truly undeserving fate.

The only thing they wanted was to live their way. Now, Heaven Alliance was going to make an example out of them.

This frightened all the dragon lords nearby. Would they dare to refuse a clarion call from Heaven Alliance? Doing so meant falling into the same path as these two conquerors. Supreme was indeed a frightening leader.

They also lamented how cruel fate was - to do nothing but train for a lifetime only to be subjected to someone else’s whim. Even conquerors didn’t have the freedom to live.

“Conquerors are only beginners on the path.” A dragon lord murmured this phrase and felt hopeless.

If conquerors themselves were shackled by the flow of the world, what about weaker cultivators?

As they were separated by numerous dimensions, they stared at each other and whispered something unknown.

Both performed a mudra and time came to a halt. The only thing unraveling was their sweet words to each other. Their hand movements and words were identical.

This created a state of harmony between the duo and the world itself.

“Buzz.” Time remained frozen while dimensions became stacked on each other, nullifying the distance. The two appeared together again, inseparable.

“Dao Harmony!” The two shouted in unison.

“Rumble!” Their dao fruits appeared and gathered together, making the crowd feel as if the two conquerors were one - a perfect fusion.

The fruits controlled a single supreme grand dao and true fate, becoming something akin to an eight-fruit conqueror. The new being’s aura obliterated everything nearby.

“Crack!” Heavenly Sword Conqueror’s sword domain and Sacred Sword Monarch’s holy aura could no longer stop the new entity.

“Suppress!” Both shouted and channeled more power, wanting to seize the upper hand.

Alas, the power of the eight fruits easily flipped the domain and aura over, sending both combatants flying.

This reversal astounded the crowd. It was nothing short of a miracle - two different grand dao fusing together in a flawless manner.

This should have been impossible because everyone’s cultivation journey was different. In fact, fusing grand dao together should result in mutual destruction. How could the two of them turn into an eight-fruit conqueror?

“This is no longer a combination technique.” A dragon lord gasped: “Such a perfect dao fusion.”

The crowd had never seen a successful dao fusion before, let alone of this level.

“Only lovers ready to die for each other can do something like this.” A big shot said enviously.

Everyone yearned for their perfect half, only to never find them. A perfect fusion was no different than a pact between two souls. Their true fates have fused together, something rather unprecedented.

“Boom!” Heavenly Sword Conqueror and Sacred Sword Monarch abandoned their blockade and ran away.

As the fused entity tried to grab them, a blinding sun suddenly appeared next to them. Its endless power actually managed to break their fusion.

“A Heaven’s Will!” Windchaser and Harkrain recognized this unstoppable power. Unfortunately, they didn’t come up with a way to maintain their fusion forever, whether it be from an internal limit or external interference.

“Buzz.” Black clouds suddenly appeared and blotted out the blinding sun.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
