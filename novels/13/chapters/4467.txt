Chapter 4468: Visiting The Wu

The saber images and dao gradually disappeared since time was up. The young ones weren’t satisfied yet and tried their best to remember everything possible about its mysteries and profundities. There might not be another chance like this ever again.

Wise Ancestor heaved a sigh of relief. He merely focused on copying the content instead of understanding it. Fortunately, he managed to do just that before the room returned to normal.

“Thank you for your gift, Young Noble.” The clan master of the Wu led the others to prostrate before Li Qiye.

This gift of his gave them an opportunity to revitalize the clan.

“It came from the Wu, not it is back with the Wu, finishing the threads of fate.” Li Qiye accepted the gesture.

Of course, they didn’t know the fateful ties Li Qiye had with their clan in the past. They viewed him as an ancient ancestor of sorts.

“Young Noble, it’s rare to be blessed by your presence. Please, visit our clan so that I can have the chance to show you around.” Jian Ming bowed and said with a smile.

This peeved the members of the Wu since he was trying to steal their ancestor.

Thus, Wise Ancestor slapped the back of his head and said: “Jian Ming, where do you get the audacity to steal our ancestor? Why don’t we just move our ancestral shrine to your clan too?”

“Hehe, Ancestor, that’s not what I meant. Plus, you know that our four clans are one and the same. Your ancestor is my ancestor, I just want to do everything I can so that the ancestor can have a good time. Also, don’t you remember how well I served you when you visited our clan?” He spoke with sincerity, making it hard to retort.

“Brat, you and your sweet tongue.” Wise Ancestor had no response because the brat was right. The four clans have always been tight-knitted and supported each other.

Therefore, if Li Qiye was an ancient ancestor of the Wu, the Jian could also treat him as theirs.

“Young Noble, please return to the Wu.” Wise Ancestor prostrated and asked.

“Young Noble, please return to the Wu.” The others raised their voice.

“I also ask you to return to the Wu, then come to our clan later.” Jian Ming had a sloppy pose but still had an earnest tone.

He couldn’t directly ask Li Qiye to come to the Jian first. However, coming to the Wu first then his clan seemed perfectly proper.

Of course, the Wu didn’t mind this request either due to their close relationship.

“I have to go to each clan and bless them too?” Li Qiye chuckled.

The group felt their face becoming hotter. Wise Ancestor was the one to answer: “We have no hope of revitalizing the clan and aren’t qualified to participate in the Primordial Union. We’ll ruin our clan’s prestige so that’s why we put our shame away and invite you to participate, Young Noble.”

“The union…?” Jian Ming wanted to say something but refrained. He eventually murmured: “The young noble’s participation will be perfect.”

He knew a lot more but couldn’t reveal the details to them right now.

Li Qiye smiled and said: “Fine, I have time anyway so I’ll tag along with you unfilial descendants. Remember, you’re not my unfilial descendants though.”

The group became ecstatic despite the playful criticism.

“Thank you, Young Noble!” They happily prostrated again. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Thank you, Young Noble!” Jian Ming was happy as well. Though Li Qiye has yet to agree to visit the Jian, this was still a great development for the four clans and their members.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye stood up and the group respectfully made way for him.

Their trip back to the Wu began. Of course, the youth from the Jian also tagged along. He was far more clever than his peers, speaking in a pleasant and likable manner.

The Wu was built in Inner Ruins and right next to Desolate Wild, not part of any other territory.

Though there were many sects here, war was rather rare. The reason could be due to old pacts or out of fear due to the existence of ancient lineages. Because of peace, prosperity was inevitable.

The other three sects were located next to the Wu as well. They picked a prosperous area and built their clans together. Their solidarity has withstood the test of time thus far.

They were around during the Immemorial Era and chose to reside in Inner Ruins during the early Chaotic Era.

These were the years when numerous sects have been reduced to ashes. This land became available for the four great clans.

They prospered and became famous, actually having produced top masters - some were comparable to dao lords. Unfortunately, this golden age didn’t last forever. Nonetheless, they were lucky to have survived until now despite the gradual decline.

By this point, they were no longer well-known, the same for their illustrious history.

The borders of the four clans weren’t well-defined because this was unnecessary. Their members got along as well.

In the center was a towering peak considered to be owned by all four clans. Most importantly, there was once a great tree here.

It witnessed their rise and fall. Alas, it had withered in time. Now, it only served as a spiritual totem for the clans, a symbol of their unity, and a token of their past success. All in all, the withered tree carried symbolic significance for them.
