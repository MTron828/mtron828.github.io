Chapter 5883: What Are You Doing?!

The dagger of darkness struck the target as if it had been there the whole time. Once aware, it was already too late for Trinity Ancestor.

This was an epoch-level ambush, not to mention Trinity and the mysterious guest being preoccupied with each other. It bypassed all existing defenses and gave room for the energy spear from above to pierce the skull, preventing Trinity from moving.

“Twilight Hunter, is this all you know how to do?!” Both shouted in unison.

Now, spectators finally noticed the ambusher standing behind him. He was shrouded by a black cloak that was as thin as a cicada’s wing. It had a wide hat with a veil connected, fully hiding his face.

He seemed to be weightless and intangible like a wisp of smoke, capable of disappearing immediately. Once gone, it would be as if he had never existed in the world. No traces were left for anyone to find him.

Despite Trinity’s strength and defenses, he still managed to pin the skull and the body down.

“So that’s Twilight Hunter.” World and the others shuddered after seeing the legendary existence. It was said that none had seen his face before, not even Primal’s group. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The emperors have met overlords and witnessed their power. However, Twilight Hunter had no aura to speak of, not even a remnant strength of power or affinity. He could follow someone as their shadow and they wouldn’t have a single clue.

“What are you doing?!’ Trinity roared thunderously.

“Eat you, your physique and soul are enough to let me slumber for a few epochs.” Listeners had no idea where his illusory voice came from since they resembled whispers.

“I can’t forget the taste of this physique.” His eyes shimmered with greed since he had previously devoured Divine Ancestor.

Trinity Ancestor was even better since he had the true soul on top of the physique - this was the most precious and delicious meal in the epoch.

Primal and the others resorted to the blood refinement out of hunger. This also applied to Voracious and Epoch’s End but not Twilight Hunter.

He looked down on such acts, viewing them as savage beasts for falling to their hunger. He viewed the hunter as a mission of art. The preys were all carefully chosen - only the best in each epoch. Just one go was enough for him to last another epoch or longer.

“Thank you for the meal.” Twilight Hunter said ceremoniously, seemingly showing respect to the target.

“We can’t let him!” World shouted.

They didn’t know whether Trinity would remain himself or become the dark being again, but letting Twilight Hunter power up from this feast would be unwise due to future uncertainties.

“Boom!” The strongest emperors summoned the weapons given by Li Qiye with all of their might - the hexaplate, nine-dao seal, bloodaxe...

These epoch-level weapons and even a paragon artifact displayed incredible power.

“Hmph, know your place.” Twilight Hunter was annoyed at the interruption of his meal and waved his hand, summoning waves of shadow to repel the weapons.

His eyes turned cold as he used his dagger, extinguishing all affinities along the way.

“Watch it!” The emperors’ expression soured as they switched to a defensive stance.

The extinguishing dagger made the emperors lose their confidence, unable to tell if they could block it.

“Bam!” A stone shield descended and blocked the attack. Its simplicity had nothing to do with its effectiveness as it stopped the extinguishing dagger.

“Stonesplitter Patriarch.” Twilight Hunter said softly.
