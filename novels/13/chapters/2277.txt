“Boom!” One more divine palace floating in the sky was rendered to ashes by the beam. Their strong defense was proven useless today.

After piercing through this palace, it pierced through another peak and heading for a group of floating temples in the sky.

These temples were shrouded in fog, seemingly the home of the gods with an unquestionable prestige. All spectators would feel a sense of reverence.

It had its own defensive barriers that appeared to stop the beam. Futile it was, the beam continued on without fail.

“Hmph!” A scowl echoed across the entire system. Just this one sound was enough to scare a billion existences. Even the stars above trembled as if this scowl could make them fall down.

“Boom!” A divine wall descended right before the beam.

“Buzz!” The beam continued shooting at this wall. Sparks went flying but it was finally stopped this time around.

Eventually, Li Qiye used up the absorbed power but the wall remained standing.

People heaved a sigh of relief, especially the inhabitants of Everlasting. This disaster out of nowhere scared the crap out of them.

Meanwhile, Alchemy Hut was still quiet. What Li Qiye had done just now was domineering beyond words.

“Come out now, show me some real abilities or it would just be a waste of my time.” Li Qiye commented while posturing coolly with both hands behind his back.

His sleeves fluttered to the wind; he lacked an imperious aura found in many others with this leisure pose. Nevertheless, those staring at his back felt their heart freezing. They didn’t even have the courage to lift their head, let alone looking straight at him.

Domineering, invincible, unique; these words weren’t enough to describe he who seemed to be the ruler of Longevity System, a being above all.

“Just like back in Insane Court.” The Pill King commented with emotions.

Li Qiye had controlled Insane Court back then and now it was Longevity’s turn. The Pill King didn’t know how Li Qiye was doing it, but he thought that Longevity Sage made the right move by handing the position of First Disciple to him.

The divine wall slowly ascended, revealing the group of temples again. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Buzz.” Rays of light soared forward carrying the affinity of an Eternal. This divinity could handle the test of time.

These rays were followed by continuously rotating halos, seemingly creating a grand world with its own galaxy and countless living beings.

There was a center - the start of this world and the end of all.

“Boom!” Time suddenly gathered together, one era after another, a billion years elapsed within a single second. One meditating figure appeared in this dazzling moment.

He was the center of this world and the galaxy revolved around him. It was an old man; the opening of his eyes made all existences tremble.

“Forefather!” The experts in the capital of Everlasting all kneeled, same with the big shots and ancestors.

Even the emperor back at Alchemy hut got on his knees, feeling very emotional.

“Everlasting Elder Lord!” The Untethered recognized the man.

The representatives took a deep breath and found his appearance unbelievable.

“He Qianyu.” One of them quietly said: “Not only is he alive, he’s still in Myriad Lineage instead of Imperial Lineage. Just how much resources did Everlasting used to fuel him?”

The ancestors here were scared out of their mind: “I can’t believe he’s still here!”

It didn’t take long before some loyalists felt despair and murmured: “Can we stop him?”

The usurpers had the opposite reaction: “Nothing can be better than this, Everlasting’s old ancestor is still around.”

Not to mention ordinary people, even the big shots in Myriad Lineage would shudder upon hearing the name, He Qianyu.

This was one of the strongest ancestors of Everlasting, the master of Lifejewel True Emperor. As an Eternal, he stood on the same level as many True Emperors.

Ascenders at the ninth-level wouldn’t dare to fight against True Emperors, perhaps only the low-level ones. This wasn’t the case for an Eternal. They could go against the stronger emperors.

Everlasting Elder Lord was strong enough. Plus, he was prestigious for being the master of a true Emperor. This made him reign for quite a bit during his era.

Most believed that an existence like him would enter Imperial Lineage like all of the True Emperors. Their destination would be Imperial Lineage or even Immortal Lineage.

Most Eternals would figure out ways to enter Imperial Lineage instead of lingering down here. The reason was very simple, they could live much longer in Imperial, and even more so in Immortal Lineage.

This particular aspect was another thing where emperors were superior to True Gods. It was much easier for an emperor to go up to the higher worlds. Given the same start period, they could make it to Immortal Lineage while an Eternal had only made it to Imperial Lineage.

Everlasting Elder Lord was certainly a powerful Eternal. If he were in Imperial Lineage, he could live for much longer even in a state of hibernation. His vitality would wither at a slower rate.

That’s why everyone became surprised that he was still in Imperial Lineage. It showed the crazy amount of resources Everlasting Kingdom must have spent to keep him around. Of course, this might be worth it just to keep an Eternal around.

People finally understood why this kingdom was so confident in taking over. This Eternal was their biggest ace card, their killing move against Longevity Valley.

“If Longevity Valley doesn’t have an Eternal around, it won’t be able to stop the elder lord. Everlasting will be able to do it with certainty.” One clan ancestor commented.

No one has heard about an Eternal being around in the valley. Of course, this sect had produced many but they have gone to Imperial Lineage already.
