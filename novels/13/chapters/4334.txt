Chapter 4335: Activate The Altar Or Not?

“No need for that, just don’t bother me. This altar doesn’t need to be activated either.” Li Qiye said flatly.

The young lord scowled and uttered coldly: “The darkness from underground has engulfed the entire mountain range. The barrier might be stopping it now but it can break through at any moment. If it escapes, Southern Desolace will face an unprecedented disaster. How many sects will go down?”

The crowd clamored after hearing this. After all, there were ten thousand sects in this region. The weaker ones scattered across the land. None of them would be able to stop the darkness.

Thus, the young lord successfully stirred them. Only the great powers remained calm since they had enough experience and resources to deal with many things.

“That’s why we need to activate the altar and take care of the darkness now while it’s still weak.” The young lord declared, still set on accomplishing his goal.

“The young lord is right.” A member of a small sect said: “What do we do once it escapes? It’ll be too late to suppress it then.”

Most became nervous and afraid after hearing about this possibility.

“We need to prepare for the worst, it’s best to deal with it now.” One sect master stared at the billowing fog and said.

The top sects weren’t sure of what this black fog was right now. It actually wasn’t the most important point.

They were more worried about which side to pick right now - Dragon or Lion’s Roar. This pertained to the future wellbeing of their sect; they didn’t dare to be careless.

“What do you think, gentlemen?” The young lord asked the audience on the top stage: “We should activate the altar and deal with the darkness today. It will be a feat to be remembered, one done for the sake of our descendants. Why are we still hesitating?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Remember, he needed their help in order to activate the altar. The ones standing on the field below didn’t matter to him. They were too weak to be of use.

“We should deliberate again.” The daughter of Soaring Feather mused: “Of course, our top priority is to stop the darkness from spreading to the outside world.”

“I agree.” The young lord of Flow said.

Both of them had a good relationship with the young lord of Dragon so they supported him. However, they didn’t dare to bluntly go against Lion’s Roar so they chose their words carefully to stay relatively neutral.

The young lord felt great because the sentiment was shifting towards activating the altar once more.

Chi Jinlin naturally knew what he was doing and responded: “The divine altar is left behind by the Supreme Monarch. Activating it is a serious matter that requires the input of the ancestors. We shouldn’t be hasty.”

This silenced the crowd right away because Jinlin was right. The Supreme Monarch had an untouchable status in the south. Activating it required the approval of her Lion’s Roar Kingdom.

To do so without permission meant being responsible if anything were to go wrong.

“It will be too late if we wait for the ancestors’ input.” The young lord disagreed: “The darkness might escape before then and wreak havoc on the land. In my opinion, activate it now. I’ll bear the responsibility alone.” He assumed the role of an altruistic hero.

“Well said, Young Lord.” One weak sect master supported him: “You’re a real man.”

“Yes, a true man who has the courage to accept the consequence of his action. That’s the young lord of Dragon for you.” An elder added.

Many believed that the young lord was doing this to protect them. The smaller sects hoped that he would be able to activate the altar so that they can stop worrying.

“Lion’s Roar Kingdom does not agree with this decision.” Jinlin responded firmly. Though he wasn’t loud, each word was spoken with conviction.

The representative of Lion’s Roar has spoken, meaning that this was the kingdom’s stance.

Though some might disagree with him, they didn’t dare to voice their dissatisfaction. Opposing Lion’s Roar might get them annihilated before the darkness could get to them.

This statement seemed decisive enough to settle the issue. It shut up all of the young lord’s supporters since they wished to remain neutral.

“Your Highness, you will be a sinner if the darkness escapes and engulfs the world. Is that what you-” The young lord criticized, aware that he must get through Jinlin if he wants to lead.

“Young Lord, can you represent Dragon Sect and Peacock Monarch?” Jinlin interrupted him with a hand wave.
