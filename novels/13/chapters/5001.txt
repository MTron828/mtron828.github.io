Chapter 5002: Pagoda Guardian

Elemental King went all out but still couldn’t stop the palm strike. The force sent him to the ground.

The disparity of a single fruit was in full display. Though his fiery mastery was immaculate, his cultivation was simply weaker. The only way to win was to have a heaven-defying technique.

“Die!” Wild Dragon’s tyrannical roar intimidated those beneath.

“Boom!” Three large figures arrived and interrupted the battle, causing violent quakes.

“You shall stop here, Wild Dragon!” The figures shouted in unison, looking like three deities.

They were mountainous statues of different forms. If it wasn’t for their animated eyes, others would think that they were mere artifacts.

However, they exuded powerful auras and were actually alive.

“What are they?” Ming Shi asked.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Three guardian giants.” Yunyun whispered.

“Guardian giants?” Ming Shi hasn’t heard of them before.

“Immortal Pagoda of Deity, this is their prime fighting force. The guardians are here then.” Goldcrest said.

“Who are these guardians?” Ming Shi asked again.

“Immortal Pagoda Conqueror left a peerless pagoda to the lineage. This serves as their ancestral ground, the very source of their dao. Thus, they leave these statues and ancient ancestors there for generations.” Yunyun elaborated.

“Just three five-fruit dragon lords, how futile.” Wild Dragon laughed heartily.

Those who heard him thought that this was how the number one member of the Ten Monsters should be - always imperious and fearless.

Of course, he was also strong enough to take down these three giants, not to mention that this was his territory. With the empowerment of the serpent deity, he became far stronger than before.

“Boom!” A pagoda appeared at this crucial moment and automatically forced cultivators and demons to the ground. This was due to its existence alone, not that it had activated its power.

It forced the black clouds to disperse, revealing Wild Dragon’s true form.

He was a colossal fire dragon with scales resembling molten metal. Between the plates was flowing lava instead of flesh.

The main difference between him and another fire dragon was his bloated stomach as if he had just eaten a delicious meal. His bloodline alone exuded immense pressure and intimidated all other beasts.

Normally, Wild Dragon was shrouded by dark clouds and fog. Few got the opportunity to see his true appearance until now.

“Wild Dragon’s fortune must have been insane.” Goldcrest commented: “He evolved into a true dragon, albeit this is a thin bloodline. His original form wasn’t like this.”

“What did he look like before?” Ming Shi asked.

“He used to be a lava earthdragon, so more of a fat lizard leaving lava in its wake.” Goldcrest said.

“Haha.” She laughed after imagining a fat lizard crawling around.

“Boom!” The suppressive force came from an old man holding the pagoda.

He wore a gray robe, appearing dignified and intimidating. His gaze alone could destroy the six dao. Cultivators found these eyes capable of sucking their life away.

“That’s a guardian, I think he’s the oldest ancient ancestor in Deity.” Yunyun whispered.

“Old geezer, you dare leave the ancient pagoda?” Wild Dragon was not afraid.

“You shall run rampant no more, Wild Dragon.” The guardian uttered coldly.

“You won’t be able to kill me today, this is my playground.” Wild Dragon laughed.

The two clearly had an ongoing feud and it seemed that Wild Dragon was the underdog.

Rumor has it that this guardian was awfully close to possessing seven sacred fruits. If he had ascended sooner, he would certainly have seven by now. Alas, he chose to protect the ancestral pagoda.

This was a highly-anticipated match and a crowd built up, albeit at a safe distance. Yunyun and her friends also became interested.

“We’re leaving.” Li Qiye, on the other hand, only cared about Flame-eater Child who had left, not worrying about Wild Dragon despite the potentially dangerous battle.

Though the youths wanted to watch, they still followed Li Qiye. After they gained some distance, they heard loud explosions from behind.

They maintained a fast speed in order to keep up. Although the boy appeared clumsy and slow, he was as fast as a spirit while traversing Demon.

Perhaps due to fatigue, he eventually hid inside a valley and sat in front of a deep pit.
