Chapter 1000: Destroying The Saber Emperor School

At nightfall, Li Qiye’s declaration exploded throughout the Blood Race. Its lineages were in disarray and everyone became quite rowdy all of a sudden.

This was especially true for the Blood-devil Tribe. They held a dire emergency meeting. Many big shots from its lineages participated, including a few seclusive ancestors.

“So arrogant, challenging our entire tribe. Does he really think we don’t have anyone who can take him on?” It wasn’t just the Blood-devils, even some Blood disciples felt indignant at Li Qiye’s words.

Due to their great solidarity, once the Blood Race faced a powerful enemy, all of them would let go of their feuds and join hands. The humans were far weaker in this respect.

“Who does he think we are? Does he think that our Blood-devil Tribe is a soft tomato that he can crush as he pleases?” A Blood-devil disciple full of hope spoke: “We have billions of disciples and more than one thousand paragons with Godkings leading them. I don’t believe that he has the ability to kill us all!”

A big shot from the tribe coldly uttered: “Let him come, we’ll take him on anytime. No matter how powerful the enemy may be, our Blood-devil Tribe will fight to the end!”

In fact, this big shot wasn’t just boasting. In just one night, many lineages in the tribe quietly maneuvered their armies to form an unimaginably large coalition!

Spies were shocked to see this miraculous deployment from the tribe. They were not only unified but also had a fast and effective cavalry. It would be difficult for a tribe with such abilities to not become prosperous.

They used action as to respond to Li Qiye’s threat. This left a lot of people wanting to see more.

Everyone knew that in the last several generations, the Blood Race had become increasingly powerful in the southern region. The human race no longer had the strength to be called number one in the Barren Earth.

The Blood-devil Tribe’s unity allowed them to grow strong very quickly. Now, they were a force to be reckoned with for all the other races here. At this moment, they finally mobilized their troops on an unprecedented scale to fight Li Qiye to the death. How could people not become excited to watch this?

“One against an entire tribe — even Lin Tiandi can’t compete with this. This is the pride of our human race!” A proud human commented after seeing the Blood-devils on the move.

This was the reason why the humans began to falter before the Bloods; humans only worried about their own business, they only swept away the snow in front of their own gate. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have conceded the position of being the number one race in the Barren Earth to the Blood Race.

An expert who had received some information spoke: “An ambush of certain death. The Blood-devil Tribe has sworn to not give up before taking Li Qiye’s head even if they’re down to the very last man!”

This was a shocking piece of news. However, no one knew where this ambush would take place!

However, many people understood that this feud between Li Qiye and the Blood-devil Tribe was beyond reconciliation. Li Qiye had killed dozens of Blood-devil ancestors back on the Godwar Mountain and then ten more at the Thunder Tower. This was a great blow to their tribe. It would be strange if they could let go of this anger.

On the second day, Li Qiye left the Holy City by himself, not taking anyone with him.

“Li Qiye wants to make a move!” The eager crowd watched in anticipation. The Holy City was boiling with excitement. There was even a large group of experts tailing him!

Li Qiye flew in the sky; each of his swift steps crossed a thousand miles. However, judging from his expression, he had an inexplicable sense of ease. It was as if he was not going into battle and was instead merely taking a stroll outside of the city.

***

The Blood-devil Tribe had thirty-five great lineages and fourteen nations. The Saber Emperor School was one of them and also the one closest to the Holy City.

After almost half a day, Li Qiye arrived at the Saber Emperor School, but he didn’t enter. He only stood on the outskirts and gazed at the sect.

As a southern great lineage, the school’s ancestral ground spanned for thousands of miles. Rows of mountains pierced the sky like divine blades lined up one after another. This scene easily displayed the school’s might.

At this time, it was in a state of high alert. A great army defended the gates with rays of light that towered to the sky. Formations had been activated within. The school’s sealed ancestors all came out. Both Heavenly Kings and Virtuous Paragons presided over important locations.

The cultivators following behind Li Qiye also stopped on the horizon. They held their breaths while waiting for the battle to break out.

An ancestor from the school shouted: “Li, come here if you dare! Even if you were the reincarnation of an Immortal Emperor, we will still fight you to the end!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The disciples inside shouted as well. Their chant echoed in the mountains, creating reverberations across the area in an intimidating fashion. This was enough to show their will to fight to the end.

At this point, the spectators were waiting to see what actions Li Qiye would take to enter the school!

Li Qiye only smiled when he saw how united the school was.

“Boom!” An item jumped out then flew towards the school. Meanwhile, Li Qiye just turned around and left.

Li Qiye’s swift departure after releasing a single item confused many people. No one knew what he was trying to do. Even the experts in the school were startled. They thought Li Qiye would come and massacre them on their grounds.

“Buzz!” The item instantly flew inside the school. It quickly transformed into a gigantic green bamboo tree. Its enormity engulfed the entire school.

“What is that?” Everyone became wide-eyed. No one knew where this kind of bamboo tree came from.

People lifted their heads to watch the tree that poked through the clouds and blotted out the sun. Under its cover, the entire school seemed incredibly tiny!

“Boom!” While everyone was still confused, the giant bamboo suddenly slammed down and smashed the school.

“Rumble!” Many of the mountains inside immediately collapsed from this attack. The disciples inside were blown away, and many were even smashed into a paste.

However, it was only the beginning of the calamity. After the first smash, the tree’s great dragon-like roots instantly pierced into the ground.

“Zzz—” The sound of siphoning clearly resounded. The moment the tree took root in the school’s ancestral ground, it drained the worldly energy of this location like an ox drinking a river’s water. The energy underground was sucked up like a flood through a broken dam.

The large ancestral ground began to wither as its worldly energy was stolen. With a loud pop, cracks suddenly appeared on the land.

“Not good, stop it now! Open the ancestral foundation!” The ancestors in the school regained their senses, but it was already too late.

An ancestor shouted and took the vanguard while leading his direct disciples to attack the tree.

“Die!” Almost ten thousand disciples from the school frantically made their way towards the tree. The ancestors used all of their abilities. An endless amount of blood energy controlled the most powerful true treasures to attack the green bamboo.

In just a second, glittering lights appeared in the sky. One treasure soared up after another. Divine swords slashed the tree along with scorching flames. Some ice element techniques aimed to seal it as well...

However, as the tree continued to absorb the worldly energy, it became even more verdant. It emitted a green ethereal light as if it was forming a huge barrier.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!” The onslaught from the tens of thousands of disciples was completely stopped by this green barrier.

Next, one of the tree’s branches stretched out. It swept countless disciples flying. This scene resembled a huge tree smashing away countless ants. It was truly shocking!

“Boom!” An ancestor used his most powerful true treasure to break through this green barrier. He and several others instantly headed for the tree to cut it into pieces. However, before these powerful ancestors could reach the tree, a buzzing appeared. A sword-like branch flew down to meet the ancestor with the true treasure.

No matter how powerful this true treasure was, it couldn’t stop the branch. With a scraping noise, the branch pierced the true treasure and nailed this dead ancestor to the ground.

This ancestor quivered a bit before he died. He still didn’t know just what this green bamboo tree was to be so heaven-defying like this.

“Rumble!” At this time, the school had finally opened their foundation in order to stop the tree.

Alas, even the foundation couldn’t stop it. With crackling explosions, the roots of the tree pierced the ancestral foundation and drilled even deeper into the ground.
