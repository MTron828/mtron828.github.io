Chapter 5690: Deities, Please Save Him

Conflicting views emerged even among The People regarding whether Momentous Frontier should offer assistance.

They waited for a response yet none came from the deities. Meanwhile, Celestial Court waited patiently after hearing War’s declaration.

It seemed willing to accept the frontier’s neutrality. Of course, this required them to hand over Luminous Conqueror and West Bank Prime Emperor.

Willingness aside, Celestial Court also feared the unbreakable momentum that had been strengthened over eras inside Momentous Frontier. Taking it down was far from easy.

Moreover, it had an immortal weapon personally refined by Li Qiye. It had been embedded into the land and became the new foundation.

War and his peers understood the power of the weapon. If Momentous Frontier were to face them in battle, there was a chance they would lose everything, unable to accomplish their initial goal.

They had no confidence in actually stopping the weapon once empowered by the land. The price paid to suppress the weapon might include many of their lives.

“Deities, take your time, we will wait for a response. Just know that we will always respect your neutral stance.” War bowed slightly in the direction of Momentous Frontier.

With that, the commanders returned to their various camps and rested, seemingly in no hurry to launch an expedition.

Survivors heaved a sigh of relief. At the very least, this bought more time for West Bank and Luminous.

Of course, Celestial Court wouldn’t let them have too much time before initiating the siege.

Meanwhile, West Bank vomited blood inside Momentous Frontier. Although he had tried to stabilize his wounds, sacrificing his true blood and seal left devastating injuries. The fact that he was still alive was nothing short of miraculous.

He relied solely on willpower, gritting his teeth and mustering his remaining strength to bring Luminous’ true fate and primordial dao fruit into Momentous Frontier.

He was only his last breath now, on the verge of fainting. However, Luminous’ condition was worse.

He suffered fatal injuries from the combined assault of War Ancient God, Nine-wheel, and Just-once Dao Lord. He somehow managed to survive one strike after another. In the end, he saw West Bank and did the same thing - wanting to take all of them down with him.

It managed to kill Immortal Emperor Qing Xuan and San Dao, not the main trio. If he had regular dao fruits, he would have suffered the same fate as War God Dao Lord.

The primordial dao fruit withstood the sacrifice and protected his true fate. Nonetheless, the situation appeared dire as the light around his true fate became increasingly dim.

If this continued, his true fate would disappear and the primordial dao fruit would be meaningless then.

West Bank Prime Emperor knew this and used his own vitality and dao power to protect Luminous’ true fate. He channeled his anima force to light it up as well.

Unfortunately, he was in no position to help anyone right now, hence more spewing of blood. This attempt might end with him dying before being able to light Luminous true fate. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ugh...” He vomited blood again, realizing the futility of his action.

“Deities, please save Brother Luminous.” He had no choice but to seek help.

Alas, no response came - this was clearly a difficult decision for the deities.

“Don’t let him die like this, not after all he had done for The People.” West Bank begged for Luminous, not himself.

At the very least, he could persevere and survive. Luminous, on the other hand, needed external help.

“We dare not ask for your help against Celestial Court’s armies for that would mean war.” West Bank continued: “Just prolong Brother Luminous’ life, he doesn’t deserve to die like this, he is the pillar of The People.”

West Bank had never asked anyone for help, not even during the most perilous moment on the battlefield. In fact, most apex cultivators were like this. Their prestige and pride were priceless.

Alas, he threw his pride away for Luminous’ sake, not wanting to see his true fate extinguished.

“Deities, Momentous Frontier can still maintain neutrality after saving Brother Luminous.” West Bank Prime Emperor gritted his teeth and made up his mind: “Please prolong his life and I will surrender to Celestial Court, that is all I ask.”

What more could one ask for in a friend? Moreover, the emperor had also lost enough for The People. His clan was wiped out entirely while he had incurable injuries.
