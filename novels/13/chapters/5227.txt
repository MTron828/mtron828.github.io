Chapter 5228: Death Comes For All

“I didn’t expect to see you here, Sacred Monk.” Skysword Dao Lord greeted. [1]

“Amitabha, I am making a fool out of myself for being tempted by worldly matters.” The monk placed his palms together.

“For Heaven Reckon?” Suppression Conqueror’s brows furrowed since he was here for it as well.

He heard rumors of this ruler being capable of gauging the heaven’s will and measuring the immensity of all things. It had limitless potential and he would be able to carry out his personal goals with it.

Xiao Qingtian also wanted the ruler. No other treasure could peer into the secrets of heaven itself.

“Amitabha, Heaven Reckon once belonged to us, our legacy, before being lost to the outside world. I am here to bring it home.” The monk said.

“So it is true.” The crowd murmured among themselves and wondered how Boss Tang got a hold of it.

First, stealing it from Pure Land was virtually impossible. Moreover, if he had done so, he wouldn’t be auctioning it right now.

The others didn’t comment. Regardless of the treasure’s history, it would belong to the highest bidder now.

“Boom!” A branch manifested into reality out of thin air and grew into a great tree with more branches and leaves.

Instead of giving off a refreshing aura of life, it felt as if the branches and leaves were metallic weapons with shudder-inducing gleams.

This was the first time for many to see a tree of this nature. An old man walked out from the trunk, looking as if he was made from metal. He sat down on the throne belonging to Azure Peak.

“Brother Sentinel.” Skysword bowed slightly and asked respectfully: “I hope Azure Ancestor is doing well.”

“Yes.” The old man nodded and accepted the gesture.

The crowd found this unbelievable. Someone commented: “Who is he, to be deserving of this greeting from Skysword Dao Lord?”

“Sentinel Treant.” A big shot said.

“It’s because Skysword Dao Lord is a sky spirit.” Someone explained: “He proved his dao at Azure Peak and might actually be a descendant of Azure Ancestor. As for the old man, he is the guardian of Azure Peak.”

“I see.” Listeners understood after hearing this.

Azure Ancestor was one of the oldest dao lords, widely believed to be the progenitor of the sky spirits. As an apex dao lord, he chose to stay in the upper continents instead of ascending to the immortal continent.

Azure Peak became the home for all sky spirits. It was rather reclusive and rarely dealt with the outside world.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Why did Skysword Dao Lord join Dao Alliance and not Azure Peak?” Someone else remarked.

Given his power and connection to Azure Peak, he would be able to propel it to the next height.

“He has his own ambition, I’m sure.” A big shot said softly.

“So do you think they’re here for the leaves?” The questioner inquired again.

People knew that Azure Peak had a Reincarnation Nine-leaves just like the one up for auction.

“They will probably bring it back to cultivate too.” One ancestor said.

“Great, I’m not last.” Suddenly, an old man sat down in the spot reserved for Immortal Emperor Yao Zu. No one saw how he got there.

The first thing people noted was his age - a face covered in wrinkles with a lifeless complexion, a pair of muddled eyes, and other characteristics seen in an impoverished old man.

The only sign of his greatness was the occasional flare of fire deep within his eyes. These embers seemed rather frightening.

Everyone stood up after seeing him, even Celestial Stone Dao Lord.

“Greetings, Immortal Emperor.” They said respectfully to the emperor who lived in the same generation as the ancient ones.

This famous alchemist was sought after by everyone. Even Celestial Court required his help.

Later on, he lived reclusively and this gave enough room for Heavenly Sage Yuan to enter the spotlight. If he hadn’t done so, she wouldn’t have been as prestigious and famous.

“Thank you, everyone, I am too weak to return the gesture.” He only bowed his head slightly without standing up.

Everyone exchanged glances and sympathized. The end of life was inevitable even for the strongest cultivator. It was only a matter of time regardless of one’s fortune in life.

Immortal Emperor Yao Zu was naturally mighty, surpassing many contemporary dao lords and conquerors. Most importantly, his alchemy was second to none so he had access to the best longevity pills. Alas, death had knocked on his door.

Therefore, the top cultivators present saw their future in him. Of course, that was only if they were lucky enough to live as long.

This fate was the reason why they all sought immortality. Unfortunately, only immortals had everlasting life.
