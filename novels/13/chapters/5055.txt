Chapter 5056: I Am The Only God

Bloodfly God survived by sucking blood and flesh. Now, he finally had a taste of what his victim felt at the hands of his own superior.

Once the needle penetrated his shell, he couldn’t struggle in the slightest. His bloated frame became smaller and smaller at a rapid rate. It didn’t take long before there wasn’t a single drop of blood inside.

This was the difference between a commanding and founder god but most importantly, he was subservient to Golden Mosquito since they were from the same branch.

“Bam!” The dried corpse fell to the ground with eyes still open.

Remember, Golden Mosquito was freed due to his effort but this didn’t matter at all. If he had suspected this cold-blooded betrayal, he would not have chosen the same path.

A few demons shuddered while sympathizing with him. They worshipped their deity branch and grew with it, ready to die for their founder god. Alas, the reward for a lifetime of service was a horrific death?

“Not bad.” Golden Mosquito burped, still seemingly unsatisfied.

“Cooperate with me, this is a godsend opportunity for you.” Golden Mosquito said.

“How so?” Li Qiye smiled.

“We shall team up, the Ten Great Mountains belong to me, the rest of the world, yours. Moreover, we shall will take down the divine nest and you may pick anything from there.” Golden Mosquito said with a smile.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Listeners took a deep breath after hearing his ambitious plan.

“You think you can unite the world?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“It will be the two of us. Even if masters from the two upper continents descend, they will only be our prey. Nothing will stop us from using this land as nourishment then.” Golden Mosquito said confidently.

Golden Mosquito clearly wanted more than just reign over the continents. Demons and cultivators imagined this dreadful future and started praying for Li Qiye to kill Golden Mosquito. This included some members of Bug as well since they didn’t want to share the same fate as Bloodfly.

“Reality differs from your ambition.” Li Qiye said: “I don’t need the help of a mosquito like you to unite the world, the same for the divine nest if I desire it in the least bit. You think too highly of yourself.”

“You wish to oppose me then?” Golden Mosquito didn’t appreciate the verbal slap and became aggressive.

“You are not even qualified to be an opponent, just an insect for me to swat.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hahaha, no one dared to talk to me like this outside of the geezers in the divine nest. Don’t blame me for being merciless then!” Golden Mosquito had enough.

A gust of wind could be heard followed by a bang. This happened too fast for people to see clearly but Golden Mosquito started attacking right after speaking, aiming his golden needle at Li Qiye’s forehead.

It was actually inches away before the gust and the bang. This despicable method was unbecoming of a founder god - a being worshipped by numerous animals and demons.

He was essentially a god who should behave in a just and honorable manner. Alas, this particular one was rather unconventional and shameless.

He himself had no problem with this as long as he could kill Li Qiye. Any means would be acceptable for the sake of victory.

“Boom!” The golden needle struck the target but couldn’t pierce through it.

The toughness of Li Qiye’s body shocked him so he wanted to retreat. Alas, his needle has been firmly grasped.

Before he could calm down, his gigantic body has been lifted up in the air.

“Rumble!” Li Qiye smashed him repeatedly to the ground, crushing one peak after another.

Li Qiye became a wild dragon playing with his prey. The relentless smashing eventually left cracks in the mosquito’s golden shell.

“Crack!” The needle finally broke from the repeated stress.

“Ahh!” Golden Mosquito’s scream echoed across Demon. He vomited blood and couldn’t handle the pain.

Not to mention regular cultivators, the commanding gods became slack-jawed. Earlier, they went all-out and couldn’t break the golden carapace blessed with the power of worship.

Now, Li Qiye easily overwhelmed this founder god as if he was an actual mosquito. The latter couldn’t even put up an ounce of resistance.
