Most wouldn’t accept that only two remained after the three movements. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Gong Qianyue was a sure thing but Li Qiye? No way, he was only at Iron Skin.

“What’s off about him? How did he cheat?” Zhan Hu’s eyes flashed as he stared at the sleeping Li Qiye.

He knew that the bells had no problem because the elders and protectors themselves played the tunes. Plus, the fact that they got teleported out was definitive proof.

There was no way Li Qiye could actually withstand the pressure.

“It’s just Senior Sister Qianyue protecting him.” Huang Ning said, exasperated. Looking at the two alone in the hall made his jealousy ooze out.

Qianyue’s constant protectiveness of Li Qiye drove Huang Ning crazy. He wanted nothing more than to crush Li Qiye into a pulp.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The bells resonated again, especially the golden one.

It knocked into space and echoed across the area, forcing many to prostrate as if it was an immortal bell. Everyone must show their respect and reverence.

“This is the final movement! She’s really doing it.” An older disciple took a deep breath.

All eyes were fixated towards Qianyue in the hall. This final lesson wasn’t a part of the regular examination. Ordinary disciples wouldn’t get this chance.

Plus, who would want to do so in the first place? Getting to the last movement already meant twenty points - that’s already plenty.

For someone like Qianyue, she already had a perfect score after getting through the third movement. She could have ended it here yet still chose to try the final one.

“That’s the number one genius, the strongest disciple in Divine Black.” Even the older ones that had official positions said with admiration.

They joined the sect long ago. Their cultivation and age were higher than this crowd. Nonetheless, the strongest in this group still wouldn’t dare to challenge the final movement nor were they qualified to do so. After all, they didn’t get through the third movement.

Gong Qianyue was far younger and joined the sect late. Alas, she had more than caught up and earned everyone’s respect.

“Junior Sister Qianyue’s dao heart is the firmest too. She’ll be able to inherit our legacy.” The First Brother of South Conch said, completely convinced by her abilities.

His comment made people look at each other. The successor of their sect hasn’t been announced but who else could it be but Gong Qianyue?

“It makes perfect sense for Senior Sister Qianyue to become the next sect master. Both her dao heart and talents are impeccable.” The others agreed.

No one among the third generation of disciples objected to this notion.

“Our Young Master’s dao heart is impeccable too.” One unhappy child from Liu suddenly spoke up.

This ignited a wave of laughter among the crowd. One guy snorted: “His dao heart is impeccable? Then he wouldn’t be at the Iron Skin realm. It’s only due to luck and the senior sister’s protection.”

“Hmph, if his dao heart is considered impeccable, then my dao heart is unbeatable.” Another jeered.

“You dare to make this claim?” A cold voice suddenly sounded.

Everyone turned around and saw Gong Qianyue standing there since who knows when.

“Senior Sister...”

“Junior Sister...”

They had no idea when she got out and became startled. They then looked into the hall and saw the elders and protectors still playing the final chapter. Only one participant was left - Li Qiye.

He was still deep asleep as if he was laying on the softest bed.

“How can this be?!” Jaws dropped to the ground.

Everyone was at a loss for words. Qianyue couldn’t finish the final movement yet Li Qiye remained unaffected.

“There has to be something wrong, right?” One disciple said while staring at Li Qiye.

“Idiots.” Qianyue glared at them before moving to a corner and stopped paying attention. She touched her chin, deep in rumination.

The crowd turned red after being called an “idiot” by Qianyue. A while ago, they didn’t spare any words when making fun of Li Qiye.

Her comment wasn’t actually that harsh in comparison. However, being criticized by their “crush” definitely didn’t feel good.

All of this was because of Li Qiye! Thus, they diverted their anger towards him instead of her.

Huang Ning didn’t know what to do either. He thought that Qianyue had been protecting Li Qiye but this no longer seemed to be the case.

Though her “idiots” line wasn’t directed at him, it was still pretty much a slap on his face.

“Mmm, you’re still knocking?” Li Qiye woke up at this moment and stretched before glancing at the elders and protectors.

“You call this an examination? These movements can’t test the dao heart, this is nothing more than a game.” He shook his head next.

“Don’t tell me you know music?” The main elder became awkward and annoyed after hearing the disdainful word from a third-generation disciple.

“I played around for a few days back at my home. Okay, I’ll do it and test you guys.” Li Qiye smiled and stood up.

“He overestimates himself.” One spectator outside scowled.

“This Li guy is just too arrogant, thinking he’s all that after listening to the final movement. How is he qualified to test the elders and protectors.” The majority criticized.

Li Qiye naturally didn’t pay any attention to them. He took the stick from the elder and started smacking the golden bell.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!” Loud sounds erupted.

“Damn you, villainous heaven! I’ll beat your mother!” Li Qiye shouted while repeatedly swinging the stick like a madman. There was no musical composition in the slightest, only chaotic swinging.

“This is unbearable!” Many immediately covered their ears.

“Boom!” The golden bell itself seemingly exploded with a soundwave spreading across Divine Black.

“???!” The five peak lords became alarmed.

“Raaa!” The roar of a golden dragon suddenly blasted afterward.
