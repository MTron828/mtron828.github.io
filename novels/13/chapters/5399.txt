Chapter 5400: All-things Mantra

All-things Dao Lord assumed his peak state - the reward of cultivating All-things Mantra to the highest level.

“Our dao isn’t as fleshed out as yours.” Eternal continued.

All-things focused on the mantra alone, not needing any other dao or merit law. The so-called common method of cultivation was fully derived, granting him endless possibilities.

Few could resist the temptation of stronger merit laws. After all, growing stronger was a key goal of cultivation. Nonetheless, All-things remained steadfast from the very start, not changing his mind even after becoming a dao lord.

His achievement was rather unique - a testament to why he was an apex cultivator.

“Clank!” Supreme entered this world with his sword drawn, capable of withstanding the pressure.

He felt the power of All-things’ anima everywhere. It resembled an invisible hand gripping his throat.

“Boom!” He released his twelve sacred fruits as well on top of activating his immortal shell. The twelve palaces rotated and released an expanse of energy in the form of a tree.

It swayed gracefully and sprinkled particles downward. Upon touching the ground, they rippled like waves of light and started dissolving.

Supreme stood in this vast expanse of sacred energy, becoming a being equal to All-things Dao Lord. His sacred tree seemingly wanted to take over All-things World.

“All-things Vision!” All-things’ anima energy started scorching the dao in order to dissolve the sacred tree.

“Heartless Slash!” Supreme thrust his sword, this time in a slow and feeble manner. Everyone could finally take a good look at his rusted iron sword.

Nonetheless, it had a heavenly property. Gods, immortals, and all living beings were susceptible all the same - no different from straw dogs meant to be sacrificed.

Both techniques were at the apex of this world. All-things Vision could reduce the dao to nothingness and the same for the destructive thrust. They did not hold back and wanted to end this in one move.

“Boom!” Eternal Conqueror joined the fight as well, fully activating his bloodline.

The temporal affinity contained in his blood derived the mysteries of the dao to the fullest. It displayed one simple truth - life was bestowed by the high heaven. This was undeniable and served as one of the foundational basis of the dao.

“My will, eternal. Dao, everlasting. World, unbreakable…” Eternal chanted as well and summoned anima flowers inside All-things World.

This conflicted with All-things’ own anima and prevented it from stopping Supreme’s thrust.

“Pluff!” The rusted sword pierced All-things chest, causing him to stagger backward with a pale expression.

His opponents were two apex cultivators; two hands couldn’t stop four fists. In reality, no one in the upper continents could stop Supreme and Eternal, not Sword Queen or Immortal Pagoda Conqueror either.

“My apologies, Brother. Everything will end today.” Eternal said.

This was an honorless fight for Eternal and Supreme but it must be done.

“If this is the extent of your power, Brother, this shall be your resting place.” Supreme said.

“It is indeed.” All-things smiled wryly and shook his head.

His defeat was guaranteed. Of course, who knows if this was truly the extent of his ability but it didn’t matter at this point.

He had no reinforcement because the others were fighting their own battle. Darkfrost was held back by Swordsea - an evenly matched fight as well.

Only someone such as Sword Queen could help him. Alas, Dao Alliance did not communicate with Imperial Alliance for the meeting today.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“The next move includes the destruction of Dao Alliance.” Supreme said while still exercising caution.

He didn’t understand why Dao Alliance chose to gather in this area. Was it to capture Illumination Conqueror or bait them into taking action?

It seemed that this was a miscalculation. Although All-things was strong, he didn’t have enough forces to deal with Illumination while preparing for other threats from Heaven and Divine Alliance.
