Chapter 4611: Ancient Race

“What does the dao lord have to do with this race?” Jian Ming had to ask. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Rumor has it his ancestors are from the depths of the ocean and possess an ancient bloodline. The records are unclear and the dao lord had never commented on this before.” The daoist responded.

“I see.” Jian Ming looked around and said: “Well, so was this place an independent continent surrounded by the ocean at one point?”

“There are some ominous rumors about this place too.” Ye Tingrong joined in.

“What kind of rumors?” Jian Ming’s curiosity was piqued.

“Ghosts and such.” She titled her head, pondered, and then answered.

“Impossible, they don’t exist.” Jian Ming felt creeped out and looked around again.

“They’re just rumors, no one has seen these so-called ghosts before but there have been strange activities.” She said.

“What do you mean by that?” Jian Ming’s fear intensified.

“Occasionally, there will be ominous flashes and ghastly sounds. Then people also saw a few visual phenomena of numerous ships setting sails among the waves. The first-hand accounts aren’t numerous enough to be completely trustworthy.” She elaborated.

“Mmm…” Jian Ming pondered.

“Our sect investigated this place several times but didn’t find anything.” She added.

“Doesn’t have to be ghosts, it can just be the presence of a treasure.” The daoist shook his head.

“True.” Jian Ming clapped once in agreement: “It can be an emerging treasure or some unauspicious things were buried here. They can be the source of the visual phenomena and flashes.”

“It’s definitely plausible.” Paramount Scion continued: “Similar rumors are there for the other ruins as well. Countless cultivators have come seeking these treasures but none found anything. This included ancestors from my sect.” He didn’t hide the sect’s matters from the group.

“Well, if there are still hidden treasures here somehow, we’ll be rich after excavating them.” Jian Ming became excited and glanced over at Li Qiye and Xiao Xuan.

The others did the same. Li Qiye and Xiao Xuan had something to do here. It was unlikely for them to be here for an adventure, meaning that it might be a treasure they were after.

“I don’t know if there are treasures or not.” Li Qiye smiled and shrugged: “However, there are certainly remnant marks depicting an unknown history to the current world.”

“An unknown history…” Paramount Scion murmured and gazed at the ruins, becoming rather sentimental.

“The highest level of prosperity reduced to mere rubble.” Li Qiye spoke emotionlessly: “Forgotten, as well. Perhaps not all of them should be.”

A sentimental air took over the group. Just the mere size of the ruins alone painted a magnificent scene of the lineage during its golden age.

Perhaps this was the center of the continent - a place for the rulers of Eight Desolaces. Unfortunately, its dynasties and invincible masters have been forgotten by the mass.

In this split second, the group suddenly felt something flashing in their mind.

“Everlasting life and immortality.” The daoist was the oldest among them so he was the first to speak up: “No wonder why all the top masters in history sought immortality. This is the only way to be eternal, everything else is merely ephemeral like the passing clouds and dispersing smokes.”

The others exchanged glances and ruminated. Just think about it, even an era was nothing compared to the river of time.

Whether it be a person or a lineage, even the most riveting tales, all would be forgotten in due time. The ruins in front of them were a perfect example.

With this in mind, one would understand the obsessive search for everlasting life and immortality - a state comparable to the river of time. Of course, this was far beyond their station right now, not something they could grasp.

Jian Ming glanced over at Xiao Xuan since she had some attainments with regard to this topic. She was an ancient being who managed to return to the present time.

“Is she searching for a lineage?” Jian Ming murmured to himself: “This can’t be a coincidence.”

He believed that her hibernation and rebirth were all part of a plan. A single master or a mighty sect couldn’t have done so. It required an eternal kingdom with endless resources.

“Over here.” Xiao Xuan suddenly felt something else and led the group in another direction.

They traveled to the other side of the ruins. It had no semblance of its original appearance and was overwhelmed by nature.

“It is here, I’m sure of it.” She said before falling into a state of zen, seemingly recalling the past.

“Clean it up.” Li Qiye ordered and the group immediately obeyed. Both Paramount Scion and Ye Tingrong didn’t care about their noble status and carried out the heavy labor.
