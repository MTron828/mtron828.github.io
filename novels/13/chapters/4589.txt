Chapter 4590: Worldbreaker Fist

The ship crossed through the realms, almost reaching its destination.

“We’re here.” Jian Ming and the daoist stood up after sensing a particular fist energy.

Anyone would be shocked while staring at the scenery ahead. However, picking the right words to describe it was difficult.

A fist breaking the world - this was accurate but the area ahead wasn’t quite broken. The place was covered in dust but in reality, these particles were the remnant of fragmented space and time. The dust specks remained until now, creating an illusory expanse. The entire thing felt like a dream.

Back in the ancient age, a punch annihilated everything here including the fabrics of reality. It crushed the sky vault and created numerous phenomena. Stars fell down and so did temporal links. Numerous dao and runes were destroyed. Scenes of hell also manifested…

In fact, one couldn’t be sure if it was a fist since it was unreasonably enormous. What kind of creature would possess a hand this large?

The various visual phenomena were still pouring down due to the broken sky. However, the most interesting part about this was still the hand itself.

The entire thing had signs of damage, whether it be from the corrosion of time or when it destroyed this region. One particular finger was nearly severed from the hand, having cracks everywhere.

The wrist also had serious damage. Something had pierced through it but it was impossible to have a clear view due to the broken fragmentations filling up the holes. Nonetheless, the fingers were still clenched together to make a fist.

Though eras have passed, a frightening power still existed. In other words, in the case of an eruption, everything would be destroyed in Eight Desolaces. This included the behemoths such as True Immortal or Three Thousand Dao. Living beings would be reduced to ashes.

Outside the immediate area of the fist was a boundless territory. Many places also suffered serious damage.

The shockwaves emanating from the initial impact must have blasted numerous mountain ranges away. Craters and valleys were formed as a result.

The healing of nature began long ago, adding beautiful sceneries to the devastated land. Now, one could also see roofs and pavilions built on top of the mountains in close vicinity. There were faint figures moving around as well. A large population was actually living here.

This was Worldbreaker Fist, a place of legends. Its unique aura could be sensed from a million miles away.

This fist energy suffocated cultivators. According to the rumors, the closer to the fist, the stronger the suppression.

In the deeper regions, it became dense enough to obliterate ancestor-level cultivators.

“This is it.” Jian Ming said with a serious expression.

No one dared to take this place lightly because it was one of the seven forbidden zones, perhaps the strangest one.

“So familiar.” Xiao Xuan stood up and said: “Yes, there is something here.”

She narrowed her eyes, wanting to gaze deeper into the territory.

“A boundless fist intent.” Li Qiye closed his eyes to feel the aura. Once he opened them again, a faint smile also appeared on his face.

“Young Noble, the greatest talents in history would have to enter the region first before sensing the fist intent while you can feel it here already. You are unmatched in the past and will continue to be so in the future.” Jian Ming said.

“Enough flattery.” Li Qiye chuckled and continued gazing.

Jian Ming smiled happily, not minding being called out.

“Such overbearing energy.” The daoist became emotional, feeling like an insect before this force. This was a scenario of men versus an ocean.

There was one way to withstand the force - becoming its slave. The so-called “fist slaves” could endure this energy. In fact, they would be able to learn the fist intent and become the best in this regard.

“It’s weaker now. In the distant past, I heard even dao lords couldn’t endure this energy, let alone people like us.” Jian Ming said.

“Yes, I’ve heard the same thing before.” The daoist nodded: “It didn’t look like this back then. There was a gauntlet made of immortal steel with gems embedded in them. Each gem can extinguish all foes, making the fist eternal. All of Sky Border was affected by its frightening energy then.”

“What happened to the gauntlet and gems?” Xiao Xuan became interested in the tale.

“We have to bring up another mythical figure then, the duck egg buyer.” Jian Ming continued.

“Duck egg buyer?” This novel title was strange to her. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Yes, some believe that the duck egg buyer is the first dao lord, I don’t know for sure. But let’s assume that it is true. Egg Buyer Dao Lord then came here and destroyed the fist, weakening its influence.”

“Were the gauntlet and gems destroyed?” Xiao Xuan could imagine the steel gauntlet while looking at the broken hand.

It must have been radiant and exuded waves of unbearable energy, making it impossible for life to prosper.

“Yes.” Jian Ming said: “The dao lord entered alone, passing through the fist dynasty, scripture chamber, and fist domain in order to destroy the gauntlet. This left everlasting damage to the fist but look at it now, it is still rather scary to everyone.”
