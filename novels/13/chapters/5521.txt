Chapter 5522: Immortal Light

He crouched down to look at it and smiled: “Oh? Doesn’t seem like I’m welcomed here.”

No response came from the un-ignitable light.

“Must I do it myself?” He asked and still didn’t get a response as if the light had ceased to exist.

“One of my favorite hobbies is annoying others. I insist on a meeting.” He continued: “Alright, fine, let’s start this.”

“Poof!” A dreadful dao flame sparked in his hands.

Cultivators had their own dao flame. The strength and intensity depended on the affinity of the cultivator’s merit law.

Although Li Qiye’s dao flame didn’t look impressive like an inferno, it could burn down the entire world. Monarchs and dao lords wouldn’t be able to survive either.

However, the extinguished light still didn’t react. This was akin to a lamp being soaked with water. Li Qiye’s dao flame couldn’t force the light to appear again.

“I don’t give up that easily.” Li Qiye smirked and recalled his dao flame.

“Poof!” He released a primordial light instead, acting as if he was there during the formation of heaven and earth. He was the first existence with the first dao law and the first light - the origin of all things.

Primordial strands spread throughout his body, growing in his bones and flesh. It only took a few seconds before a primordial tree grew outward. Everything in this epoch was hanging on the tree including all affinities and the karmic cycles.

He channeled its power into his fingertip, creating a ray that couldn’t be smaller. It flickered and danced as if it had come to life as a playful spirit.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He sent it toward the soil and it immediately flowed through the target like electricity. The two were entwined together and sure enough, the light returned once more despite its unwillingness.

“Cooperation would have been nice, now it’s awkward.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

The immortal light flickered but couldn’t disappear due to Li Qiye’s frightening primordial light.

“Since I’m here, maybe it’s time to give me an answer.” He demanded and reached for it - looking like a mortal trying to extinguish a lamp.

“Zzz…” Sizzles could be heard as his hand was burned by it. Oil started dripping from his palm due to the heat.

Nonetheless, he closed his fingers and forced it into his palm. It traveled at extreme speed, finishing a full rotation through his body.

During this split second, it became unclear whether this was an illusion or hallucination but Li Qiye appeared in a different world.

This realm was massive and paradisical. Wondrous dao laws and springs cascaded from the sky. The dao transformed into floating peaks and mountains.

This seemed to be a place of ascension, allowing someone to reach immortality and peer into the high heaven.

With one flash, one could traverse through numerous dimensions and reach the villainous heaven, losing oneself to its profound wonders. This was the final area of this vast expanse - the culmination of the dao and the secret to immortality.

Who knows if these were mere illusions or otherwise?
