Chapter 5025: Piercing Blow

Four dragon lords surrounded Li Qiye in the air while the winds painted a solemn atmosphere.

Spectators watched with bated breath due to the scale of the battle. Radiant Monarch and Wild Dragon were one of the few with six sacred fruits.

One represented the righteous faction while the other was the leader of the villains. No one expected these two to team up.

Jun Cuican and Swordgrasp Venerable were weaker. The former had four while the latter had five sacred fruits. Nonetheless, this was more than enough to roam the lower continents untethered.

“Can he win?” Most thought that this was actually an even fight. After all, they haven’t forgotten Halo Monarch’s death.

“I’ve rarely teamed up since my debut…” Radiant Monarch spoke.

Li Qiye waved and interrupted him: “Just get on with it, you don’t need to blabber about the reason why, everyone gets it.”

“Very well, excuse us then.” Radiant Monarch responded without turning red.

“Hahaha, what a great day for me. Just a while ago, your Deity Dao wants to kill me at all costs. Now, we’re fighting on the same side, what a development.” Wild Dragon found this amusing.

The crowd felt the same way. The righteous sects have always wanted to kill Wild Dragon but now, they chose him as an ally.

“We stand together today and must not hold back.” Jun Cuican said.

“I only want the god source, you all can have the rest.” Wild Dragon responded.

Radiant Monarch, Jun Cuican, and Swordgrasp Venerable exchanged glances, coming to an understanding in the blink of an eye.

“I roam with the light.” Radiant Monarch chanted and activated his dao.

“Rumble!” Walls made of light descended to protect his allies. They were thick and tall, brimming with the bright affinity. Breaking one down had the same difficulty as piercing an ocean.

This allowed his allies to fight without worrying about putting up a defense. Moreover, he won the crowd over by starting selflessly.

“Go!” He shouted.

Swordgrasp Venerable’s eyes turned cold as a sword hymn could be heard. His five sacred fruits released rampant sword rays, reducing taller trees into bits. They then gathered together into a divine sword.

“Clank!” His sword thrust crossed through time itself and appeared before Li Qiye’s chest. He was nearly at the apogee level with regard to the way of the sword.

This was a quick draw, nothing more. Normally, his opponent’s head would fall to the ground after a bright flash. His sword would be sheathed before all of that.

It was only an inch away from Li Qiye’s chest but the latter still caught it with two fingers. The destructive and swift slash couldn’t leave his grip despite the venerable’s full effort.

Spectators gasped after seeing this. Pagoda Guardian and Skystomper God were aghast because they knew just how strong that move was.

“Too slow.” Li Qiye smiled and twisted the blade, breaking it instantly.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The venerable didn’t have time to be shocked because the broken blade was being thrown straight back at him.

The shooting blade exceeded his own quick draw, making it look slow in comparison.

“Boom!” The wall of light couldn’t block it either.

“Light, follow my lead!” Radiant Monarch reacted quickly and intensified the barrier. An ocean of runes surrounded his ally.

However, the broken blade still soared through the runes and pierced the old man’s chest, causing him to bellow in agony.

“Bam!” He fell to the ground as blood gushed out.

Spectators became speechless - a five-fruit dragon lord had just been beaten by his own blade.

Fortunately, he still had the strength to get up. The five fruits poured down chaos true energy and mended his wound.

The real damage happened to his mental state. He had a good grasp of his power level. Alas, he would have been killed without Radiant Monarch’s protection.

The remaining combatants became serious. Li Qiye’s power truly exceeded their expectation.
