Majestic Desert Splendor

The sage and her men were already retreating. After the impact, a torrent of debris scattered everywhere. They had to muster some power to destroy the flying rocks and mud waves.

It ended with them looking quite pitiful while climbing out of the mess. But this was still the best case scenario. If they didn’t run fast enough earlier, they would have been annihilated just like that imperial city. Of course, they were angry at Li Qiye but there was nothing they could do.

The spectators were shocked. This madman didn’t care about friends and foes, nearly killing the sage and the ancestors.

Since the imperial city was rendered to ashes, the momentum of Everlasting crumbled in whole. The disciples who became one with it were released and became paralyzed on the ground.

Some looked at the crater where their capital used to be. They felt despair and hopelessness. Everlasting would cease to exist from now on in Longevity System.

These survivors didn’t know how to feel. If the capital didn’t go down, perhaps they would have suffered the same fate as the victims before them - turning into blood. Alas, this was also the end of their kingdom and home. They looked up at the sky with an empty gaze, uncertain of what’s to come.

At this particular juncture, the entire system fell into a hush. All eyes were on the crater; people were coming into terms with the death of a kingdom.

Everlasting was the strongest military force here but it didn’t even put up a good fight. Nevertheless, Longevity Valley had made it obvious about the stability of their reign.

Contrary to the notion of declination, the valley’s power and resources far exceeded their imagination.

The portal back there was gone now, same with the bow user earlier. No one knew which ancestor this was or how strong. Serenity and peace returned to this reclusive sect.

“No!!!” After a long time, Everlasting Emperor regained his sanity and bellowed like a mad beast.

Though he was still alive, his life was meaningless since his kingdom was gone now. Moreover, he was the one who started this coup. He became the sinner, the true criminal behind the kingdom’s demise. How could he face his ancestors in the afterlife?

He roared and jumped off the altar. It didn’t take long before a bang was heard at the bottom. The guy committed suicide and became mincemeat.

No one really said anything at the moment. The supporters of Everlasting didn’t have the courage to run. Fleeing was useless right now.

A monk can run but not his temple. Their sects and kingdoms won’t be able to escape the incoming retribution. It was best to stay and await their punishment instead of making it worse.

No one could touch the valley right now after an example was made of Everlasting. Attempting to do so would end with utter demise.

Li Qiye sat back in his chair, assuming his lazy pose. The Wutong Phoenix Tree on top of Herb-plucking was gone too.

A stark contrast indeed, the destroyer of Everlasting versus this fella resembling a lazy kitten.

People found it hard to connect the merciless, mass murderer to the current him, someone akin to an ordinary mortal.

They became frightened. Perhaps destroying a kingdom was no big deal to him, no different from enjoying a meal.

The three sisters waited on him again, spoiling him like maids treating an emperor. Eventually, he asked the crowd: “Okay now, tell me, who is the leader of Longevity? I’m all ears.”

Both the usurpers and loyalists glanced at each other. They didn’t wish to anger this madman after seeing his terrible means.

This was a tyrant, and a murderous one at that. Negotiation wasn’t his forte either.

“First Brother, you are!” One expert kneeled and shouted.

“First Brother!” The crowd kneeled down, including the usurpers.

They could have the courage to oppose Longevity Valley, but not enough balls to refute this guy.

“I see, we are of one mind then.” Li Qiye chuckled: “But I’m not interested in being the leader at all. Someone else will do it, oh, they’re here now.”

Longevity Sage and the ancestors landed on the altar just in time.

“Valley Lord.” Many disciples kneeled to greet her.

The sage was still the master of the valley so all the representatives of the other systems performed the necessary social formalities.

Some shuddered while looking at her. There were rumors of her grave injuries a while ago but she looked perfectly fine right now.

This was clearly a play. Even if she was ambushed, her injuries were heavily exaggerated. The ancestors’ attempt at saving her was just a show as well. Because of this, Everlasting thought that this would be the best opportunity to attack and seize the reign.

Alas, the real victim here was Everlasting. They fell down the pit, and the saddest part was that they were the one who dug it.

If they didn’t start this war, Longevity Valley wouldn’t have been able to do anything despite being aware of this potential threat.

But now, a rebellion was an unforgivable sin. No one would say anything if the valley were to destroy Everlasting. The real schemer here was the valley, not Everlasting. Those who understood this felt a chill running down their spine. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Alright, beauty, I’ve dealt with the disaster and toiled as an errand boy while all of you are reaping the benefits.” Li Qiye looked at the sage and smiled: “The play is over.”

The crowd was stunned and stared at the two of them. Keep in mind that in terms of status, she was his master.

But now, he called her “beauty”, lacking the respect a disciple should show his master.

One’s master should be treated as one’s parents. Such a lack of filial piety deserved punishment or even expulsion.
