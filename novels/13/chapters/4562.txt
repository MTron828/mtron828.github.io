Chapter 4563: Killing

“Screw you!” Jian Ming struck first to gain the upper hand, taking out a wooden puppet and throwing it down.

It touched the ground and turned into a mountainous giant from the past.

“Boom!” The sky turned dark once it raised its hands for a smash.

“Bring it!” Six-winged Emissary was undeterred. His wings turned into divine swords and issued loud clanks.

The six then came together to form a single energy blade for a wondrous slash capable of cutting the stars.

It split the gigantic puppet into two halves. They fell to the ground and issued a violent quake.

“Die!” Godwhip Princess also launched her attack, thrusting her spear that roared like a true dragon.

“Rumble!” Jian Ming and the daoist’s defenses crumbled before her relentless thrust.

“Eat this!” Six-winged Emissary slashed in the direction of the duo’s escape path.

“Clank!” He unleashed a torrential downpour of blades this time around instead of a single slash.

“Break!” The princess maintained her assault. Her divine spear was unstoppable, continuing to break through their defenses. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The duo had a hard time keeping up with the multi-pronged attack, always being pushed back. This was due to their grievous injuries from messing with the skeletal duck.

Now, this battle left them in an even worse shape with wounds all over. They barely managed to stay alive.

The emissary and the princess didn’t hold back their power. Both were at the sovereign level.

Jian Ming and the daoist used all of their treasures and inscrutable techniques. This was still not enough.

“Looks like the golden egg is about to have a new master.” A spectator said.

No one else dared to compete against them. This was especially true for the emissary since the sect master of True Immortal was present.

Moreover, invincible ancient ancestors from True Immortal were hiding in the air. Even the strongest masters here would need to think twice before attacking. Nothing good would come from opposing these ancient beings.

“Young Noble!” After a dozen exchanges or so, Jian Ming was covered in blood. He had no choice but to ask Li Qiye for help.

“Not even an immortal can save you today.” Six-winged Emissary sneered, ready for the kill.

He hasn’t forgotten about Jian Ming’s foul mouth earlier and would never miss this opportunity. He planned to torture the brat for a bit before delivering the finishing blow.

“I don’t appreciate that comment.” Li Qiye initially wanted to leave the two alone so that they would suffer a bit. However, he smiled after hearing the emissary’s comment and teleported into the battlefield, standing in front of the duo.

“Break!” The princess wasn’t taken aback and aimed her spear straight at this throat.

Li Qiye simply flicked the tip of the spear. “Bam!” She felt a sharp pain in both hands and couldn’t maintain her grip. Thus, the spear went flying.

Her expression darkened, realizing the grim situation. She instantly retreated with lightning speed.

“Die!” The emissary gathered all of his blades together and shot them toward Li Qiye.

“Child’s play.” Li Qiye chuckled and swung his hand like a sword, eradicating the energy blades.

Amidst the astonished crowd, Li Qiye appeared behind the emissary and firmly grabbed his wings.

“Shit!” The aghast youth wanted to attack in order to break free but it was too late.

“Ahh!” The emissary bellowed in pain as his wings were ripped off his back, leaving behind a bloody mess.

Nonetheless, this freed him from Li Qiye’s clutch and he immediately tried to flee.

“You’re not leaving.” Li Qiye swung his hand again.

“Show mercy, Fellow Daoist!” The sect master of True Immortal couldn’t just stand and watch his disciple being killed.

He swung his sheathed sword horizontally and released a draconic grand dao soaring through the air.

“Sect Master, allow me!” Wise Ancestor roared and performed a top saber technique from the Wu.

This saber energy was overbearing and separated the area into two halves.

“Bam!” Fiery sparks splashed everywhere. The saber and sword energy slammed into each other, resulting in destructive shockwaves.

After loud explosions, Wise Ancestor clearly lost the exchange. He staggered backward with blood streaming down the corner of his lips.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye struck the emissary, obliterating all of his bones without harming his exterior. He fell to the ground and became a soft puddle; his eyes still opened wide in disbelief.

He didn’t expect to die here in the presence of his sect master and the other ancestors from True Immortal. His sect master couldn’t save him either.

Everyone gasped after seeing this. The atmosphere became silent and heavy.

Li Qiye had just killed the disciple of True Immortal Sect Master in front of his sect’s seniors and ancestors.

As the saying goes, look at the master first before kicking his dog. True Immortal even had a monarch here but this didn’t stop Li Qiye from killing Six-winged Emissary.

This went beyond slapping True Immortal a few times. It was a declaration of war.

People stared at him and thought that he had poked the beehive.

True Immortal Sect Master’s expression darkened after seeing this. It was an irreconcilable feud that required revenge. Otherwise, he would lose all face and reputation.
