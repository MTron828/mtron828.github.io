“It’s finally starting.” Spectators watched with bated breath since the battle was starting.

Ninth was all alone against two legions but his cold and distant expression remained. No one liked being gazed at in this manner; they felt as if they were dead men walking.

“Boom!” The beast legion had finished channeling their formation. Runes appeared on the ground and created a massive diagram.

It released boundless light just like the opening of an immortal gate. Each member became a part of this formation.

Celestial Ape Demon King’s vitality was as vast as an ocean, ready to drown everything.

“Rumble!” Dao runes, chaos energy, and vitality mixed together to form a maelstrom.

This monstrous accumulation of energy entered the demon king. He became larger than ever before with a layer of armor added. He became an ape, tall enough to grasp the celestials.

The armor was made from dao laws, looking like thick chains coiling around him. He became brimming with energy and destruction.

Various images of ancient and primal beasts appeared behind him. He looked like the ruler of them all.

“Myriad Beast Formation!” Someone with a deep knowledge of Armament Mountain shouted.

This formation was found by God Ape Dao Lord during his youth. He came across a hidden treasury by chance in a valley. It included this grand formation.

The demon king and his legion were doing a commendable job using it.

At the same time, Starshooter King’s legion also exuded a starry glow. The lights rushed to the sky and turned into an engulfing inferno. Similar to the demon king’s formation, this inferno illuminated Starshooter King.

He accepted its power and the refinement process. He turned into a pulsing celestial being. The seal on his forehead became clearer and more defined. He gained a pair of light wings.

Once they spread, he appeared to be a holy and supreme being - like an angel from above possessing incredible power.

The bow named Sky Spirit Starshooter in his hand trembled once and the world trembled with it. When he pulled the string back, people felt as if he was controlling the mysteries of the world.

They also felt their soul being affected by it - a truly frightening sensation.

“A dao lord weapon is peerless indeed.” They were intimidated already from a slight movement of the bow.

Even the strongest weapon at the sovereign level had a hard time competing with dao lord weapons.

“Raa!” The ape-form demon king summoned a rod as large as a mountain range, spanning for thousands of miles.

His roar destroyed peaks and forests, rupturing weaker cultivators’ eardrums.

He smashed downward and crushed space along the way. Minor spatial holes appeared along the way.

“Damn!” Spectators bellowed in astonishment since this was just a physical smash without merit law augmentation.

“That’s the first elder of Armament for you.” Another ancestor praised.

Regardless of the demon king’s personality and character, this smash embodied absolute power.

“Die!” Starshooter King pulled the string all the way back and swords manifested.

That’s right, the bow used swords instead of arrows. Thousands of swords hovered in the air. The aura of a dao lord oozed down like a flood to the horror of the spectators.

Everyone became suffocated by the immense pressure. Some fell on their knees, unable to stand up again.

“Clank!” The flying swords pierced through the spatio-temporal fabrics while launching at Ninth.

The rod of the demon king could crush the world while these flying swords seemed unstoppable in the same manner. Spectators thought that not even an immortal could survive.

As for Ninth, he had zero reaction while looking at the incoming attack and retaliating.

He raised his sword and everyone felt as if their chest had been penetrated. “Sharp” was the focus of this technique. Resisting was futile.

“Third variation, Heartless!” The experts shouted right away.

“Rumble!” Fiery sparks scattered, resulting in a cataclysm. Cultivators nearby were sent flying by the shock waves. Some vomited blood, unable to withstand the impact.

“So strong!” They turned pale after witnessing this.
