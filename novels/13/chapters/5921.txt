Chapter 5921: What’s Happening?

The landscape had changed but one could still imagine the casualties suffered during Sky Guard War.

“Sky Guard, one of the six heavenly wars. It’s a successful one.” Chu Zhu remarked.

The outcome included Supreme Black Ancestor and the emperors working together to kill the remaining sea monsters and evaporate the ocean.

The price was the destruction of Sky Moat. Stone Buddha and Godhand made the ultimate sacrifice along with the legion.

This legion had survived numerous eras and fought countless powerful enemies. The legion looked unbeatable until Sky Guard.

They became forgotten afterward, disappearing into the river of time. Only a few could recall Stone Buddha and her heroic allies.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye looked at the mountain range again and clapped his hands. He jumped back on the carriage and said.

Chu Zhu was left momentarily stunned after receiving the casual command. Although Li Qiye had no idea of her prestigious status, he shouldn’t have treated her like a servant.

Anyone else would have been frightened by her glare alone, immediately prostrating and quivering with fear. However, she couldn’t glare at him because she herself thought it was a natural development. Being his servant didn’t seem to be a problem.

This ridiculous notion made her think there was something wrong with her brain. This caused her to smile wryly again and rubbed her forehead.

She jumped on the carriage and started the journey through Sky Pass. Although this next area was not covered in sand, it was still dried and inhabitable with sparse trees and vegetation.

They played their role perfectly - a passenger and a driver as if this was Chu Zhu’s job.

She grew slightly frustrated since initially, she only wanted to take him out of the unbearable desert. For some reason, she gained a master out of nowhere and worst of all, she wasn’t entirely unwilling.

If she didn’t have full clarity of mind, she would have thought that she had drunk some kind of potion - the only explanation for this inexplicable event. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Up ahead.” During the journey, the relaxed Li Qiye suddenly got up and gazed at the horizon.

“What is it?” She had the illusion that a monstrous creature was right behind her at this second. She felt insignificant like a speck of dust while being near him and became afraid.

How many cultivators could make her feel this way? Not even the famous cultivator from Immortal Suppression.

She glanced back and Li Qiye wasn’t a monstrous creature, nor was she a speck of dust.

He still looked like a mortal without any cultivation, lacking the strength to tie a rope. What was that feeling earlier then?

They eventually came across an oasis, but not the lush and shimmering type as expected. It looked like a small village with a few green trees. Their presence made the village look like an oasis from a distance.

It appeared impoverished with only twenty or thirty scattering households. The houses were made from mud. In the center was a large mound of weathered rocks - the focal point of the village.

An old well could be seen nearby, seemingly bottomless with very little water in it.

The arrival of the carriage broke the serenity and alarmed the villagers. Regular farmers couldn’t survive the harsh conditions here, only brave and capable hunters.

The men were muscular and held homemade spears, staring at the unexpected visitor.

Chu Zhu looked around and saw that there were fewer than a hundred men. The women and children hid in their home.

The dozens of men surrounded the carriage but their homemade spears posed no threat to her. They were all shirtless and only wore shorts - unclear whether this was due to poverty or the heat.

They stared at it with great vigilance but the moment they saw Li Qiye, they couldn’t help but be surprised.
