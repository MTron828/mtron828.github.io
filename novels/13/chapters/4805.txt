Chapter 4806: The Shadow Conference

Each of her breaths suppressed the entire world though she has yet to activate her power. She appeared capable of taking command in any situation.

Some ancient ancestors have heard about her before and agreed that she lived up to the legends.

“Seven Martial Goddess.” The big shots knew that she has reached a level above the current “apex” of their world.

“How would you compare Seven Martial Goddess to Dao Sanqian?” Someone whispered.

A high ancestor from an ancient clan said: “Dao Sanqian is no match for Tian Tu, let alone the goddess.”

“Clank!” Her weapon of choice was an old trident.

Its appearance caused everyone to palpitate as if their heart and true fate have just been pierced.

The weapon had a palpable presence as if it has been cast from heaven and earth. Its tip represented the apex of sharpness with a frightening glint.

Ancient ancestors with dao lord weapons immediately felt that they wouldn’t be able to parry a direct thrust.

“This is far beyond dao lord weapons.” A big shot took a deep breath and correctly speculated.

The trident came from a forgotten epoch and has been suppressed by a supreme power. This made it impossible for its true power to be used.

Eventually, the suppression and seal were removed so the weapon regained its former glory.

“Clank!” She performed an upward thrust - simple and non-flashy.

Above the sky vault was another time zone completely. This banished dimension contained an unimaginable creature.

Due to the realms in between, no attack could ever reach the creature. However, her thrust immediately overcame time and space.

“Boom!” Alas, an unknown power successfully stopped the piercing blow.

“Damn.” An eternal existence gasped. That thrust wasn’t meant to kill a single cultivator but rather, an entire world.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Her eyes narrowed after the unsuccessful attack. This made heaven and earth tremble. Living beings felt an invisible hand slamming down and causing them to fall to the ground.

“Clank!” She swung her spear vertically, leaving a long trail of coordinates in the air.

Figures appeared among the coordinates. Each of them had a majestic aura, enough to make others prostrate in fear. This was akin to numerous dao lords arriving in person.

“What is that…” The unbeatable figures were strong enough to force ancient ancestors to the ground.

“I know what this is… the remnant intent of the sea gods, they are eternal.” One ancient ancestor trembled.

“Boom!” Their powers immediately blessed Seven Martial Goddess and turned her into a giant.

Her power surged crazily as more than ten sea gods blessed her with their remnant intent.

“Rumble!” It became abundantly clear that Eight Desolaces had a hard time accommodating a being of her level.

“That’s the Shadow Conference.” An ancestor on his death bed inside a timeworn clan of the east murmured.

“What do you mean, Ancestor?” A junior ancestor nearby asked.

The near-death ancestor shook his head and said: “As far as I know, sea gods from the Nine Worlds participated in a mysterious conference. In fact, the entry requirement was so stringent that not all of them were qualified to participate.”

He paused for a moment before continuing: “I believe that it was created to confront their own origin. That’s the extent of our knowledge.”

Meanwhile, other ancient beings were emotional since they finally got to see the legendary conference.

It was rather mysterious back in the previous epoch. Those in the know thought that it was destroyed after the grand calamity.

With her predecessors’ blessing, she became the lord of the gods.

“Clank!” She thrust the air again without holding back, piercing through the unbelievable distance.

“Boom!” The creature attempted to block again but was finally injured. Blood gushed down and stained the cracks in the sky.

This was naturally a horrifying scene for spectators because it looked as if the sky was bleeding profusely.
