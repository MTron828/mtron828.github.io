Chapter 5779: Fight For Prosperity

Battles occurred on several fronts, whether it be the contest between apex cultivators or the main armies.

Light-dragon’s group tried their best and became one - a flood of steel blessed by Celestial Palace. However, Demon’s army became fiercer and their song became louder with time.

The primordial energy waves emanating from them became denser and their laws became increasingly profound. Demon, Calamity, and other emperors were in a state of zen, finding themselves without limit.

The inferno became stronger and gradually pushed the flood of steel back. The group understood why Li Qiye took the time to create the primordial ship and didn’t come with them.

Accepting death and experiencing the dangerous celestial river helped them understand the primordial laws enough to fuse with them.

The ship couldn’t have taken them here without their teamwork and persistence, culminating in the dao ode.

Their innate understanding of each other reached a state of perfection, causing the inferno to be flawless and whole.

This didn’t apply to Light-dragon’s armies since they were only borrowing the power of a treasure, not truly harmonizing with each other.

Although their reaction time and dao comprehension allowed them to make minute changes in a split second, that was enough of a gap.

Ordinary cultivators couldn’t discern any weakness but Demon’s group could, capable of taking advantage of their slower foes. This left Light-dragon’s group at a sore disadvantage despite their best effort.

“Rumble!” Another mighty blow left a large crack in the flood of steel.

“Maintain!” Light-dragon roared and unleashed celestial dragons toward that spot. Everyone else poured more vitality to prevent further damage.

At this point, it became a one-sided affair with the supreme chapter pushing the flood back. Celestial Court could only focus on protecting the gates.

“Don’t let up!” Demon ordered and continued sending wave after wave of flames engulfing the sky.

“Boom!” More cracks appeared on the barriers and Demon’s army finally approached the gates. This prompted another combatant to appear.

“Break!” Twelve gods and devils descended to block Demon’s path; their master was none other than Titanic Conqueror.

Alas, her power alone couldn’t stop the primordial inferno.

“Bless them!” Light-dragon’s group reacted quickly and sent the power of Celestial Palace to bless the twelve entities, causing them to grow dramatically.

“Primeval Age!” Titanic received blessings from her allies and became resplendent. Her supreme dao fruit released unlimited strength.

The twelve avatars came together to lift a cauldron.

“Primeval Cauldron!” Demon became startled.

“Another one...” A Grand Emperor said after Crimson Emperor’s immortal armament.

Flame Emperor had it first and then Crimson Emperor. After his death during Immemorial Epoch War, this cauldron disappeared from the public’s eyes. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Nevertheless, it made sense for Titanic Conqueror to have it since she was a descendant of Crimson Emperor. Perhaps due to her incredible power and talent, she never had to use it before in battle.

Although she had no authority over armies, her battle prowess made her the protector of Celestial Palace.

“Boom!” The cauldron opened and released an ancient power against Demon Conqueror’s forces, one strong enough to herald the end of the world.

“We fight for prosperity, our blood will admonish the heavens!” Demon and the others had no intention of yielding.

“Boom!” The apex cultivators burned their true blood to draw their hidden potential and unleash the maximum primordial power.

The primordial chapter engulfed the battlefield, displaying the boundless power of Li Qiye’s epoch.
