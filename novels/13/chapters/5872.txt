Chapter 5872: Heavenly Rain

The growing process couldn’t beat the refining rays. Li Qiye’s power didn’t only destroy his body but also his dao, true fate, vitality...

“Ahh!” With his true fate gone, the vitality and dao couldn’t gather any longer.

Waves of light circled him, grinding relentlessly until his very being was reduced to the finest strings of essences.

They were dense and had a unique scent that could only be found at the start of the world. Sniffing it was akin to being embraced by heaven and earth or bathing in the dao source. A second was equal to centuries of concentrated cultivation.

Such a pure dao source was virtually unseen in their world. Absorbing a tiny bit was enough to last a lifetime.

Emperors and monarchs understood its significance after whiffing the air. Everything regarding Lord of Derivation was turned into precious dao essences.

For a mortal, one drop would grant them “everlasting life” in their world. For a cultivator, their cultivation would soar, breaking one realm after another. Becoming a dragon lord or an emperor would only be a matter of time.

For existing emperors, as long as they had enough essences, it would help them break the limit and obtain a primal anima.

“They’re incredible, imagine the cultivation boost and lifespan increase.” One Grand Emperor said sentimentally.

By this point, they could tell that overlords or stronger cultivators could refine the world and even their peers into dao essences. This was the reason for the epoch-devouring events in the past.

Overlords had access to numerous means to devour efficiently, turning weaker beings and landscapes into power or longevity.

Under different circumstances, an expanse of essences of this level would start wars. Overlords would come out and play as well, not just imperial-level characters.

In this case, Li Qiye did no such thing and raised his hand, sending the expanse upward. He created a rift first before turning the expanse into vapor-like particles.

After a moment, they condensed and rained down on the six continents and Eight Desolaces. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What is this heavenly water?!” Rain poured down from the sky and nourished the land. All living beings benefited from the phenomenon.

In the mortal world, old people afflicted with various illnesses became vigorous again.

Cultivators meditating outside immediately understood the dao after drinking a few drops. Their cultivation soared as they swung their blades, coming up with a new variation.

Trees in a remote forest took in the rain with their leaves. After enough accumulation, they radiated with a sacred light, becoming holy entities.

Of course, they didn’t know what was happening and thought this was an auspicious sign after so many recent terrible ones.

For mortals and weaker cultivators, they attributed this to the high heaven pitying their recent hardship and deciding to bless them with this heavenly rain.

After finishing Lord of Derivation, Li Qiye turned his sight toward the remaining overlords. They witnessed the event and knew it would be their outcome as well.

“Any last word?” Li Qiye smiled.

“We have lived for epochs and reigned over the living beings. It is a life filled with glory and prestige. How many can and will surpass us? I have no regrets.” Dao Ancestor said.

“No, someone who maintains their dao heart for their whole life, that is a life without regrets.” Li Qiye said.

“We have chosen our path, no regrets even if it is a dark one.” Dao Ancestor said.

“It’s a shame that we didn’t devour the whole epoch back then or you wouldn’t exist right now.” Primal said.

“You didn’t do it because the epoch was yet to reach maturity then.” Li Qiye retorted.
