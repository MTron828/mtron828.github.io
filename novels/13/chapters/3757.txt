Chapter 3758: Solution?

Eyes were wide open watching Liu Huaishi get blown away. The crowd couldn’t believe their own eyes.

Earlier, Chi Xiaoyue used a dao lord weapon and merit law yet couldn’t do anything to Force Devourer.

Now, despite being sealed and weaponless while sitting in the meditative pose, Chi Xiaoyue managed to repel Liu Huaishi by just closing her palm.

No one would have believed this illogical development without seeing it in person. Liu Huaishi himself found this astonishing despite personally experiencing it. There was no explanation for how she did it.

“What the hell is going on?” A spectator regained his wits and murmured.

“What kind of top technique is this? So bizarre.” One older expert added.

All eyes were on Li Qiye because it was apparent that his guidance made the reversal possible.

However, Li Qiye was still holding on to his fishing rod and had his eyes closed.

“Didn’t I tell you? Li Qiye can make the impossible possible, that’s just who he is.” Someone who trusted Li Qiye prior laughed.

Those who mocked Li Qiye or thought that he was being too arrogant felt their cheeks becoming hot as if he had just slapped them.

Some ancestors had an awkward expression; they also thought that he wouldn’t be able to break Force Devourer.

The effortless manner of how he did it naturally shocked everyone.

“What technique was that?” Another ancestor wondered, not seeing the profundity of Chi Xiaoyue’s slight hand movement. How was that enough to stop Force Devourer?

“Which sect is it from?” Liu Huaishi asked while staring at Li Qiye.

Alas, Li Qiye didn’t say anything. Chi Xiaoyue had no idea either but she didn’t ask.

“How interesting, it must have something to do with the secrets of Duality Academy.” Xu Cuimei clapped and smiled.

The crowd became startled. Members of the holy ground had no idea; how did someone from Righteous see the clues?

Some turned towards Dugu Lan. She might be the most knowledgeable of the academy’s techniques out of anyone here.

“We have a merit law like that?” The students started talking among themselves.

The student body was diverse, originating from all over the world. They also cultivated different merit laws. Alas, none could pinpoint this to any technique from there.

“It can be classified as being from our academy.” Dugu Lan pondered for a bit before replying: “But no student has been fortunate enough to learn or understand it recently.”

The listeners exchanged glances right away. The students, in particular, became emotional.

If this was indeed a merit law from Duality Academy, how did an outsider like Li Qiye understand it, unlike the rest?

“Very well, let me witness it again.” Liu Huaishi didn’t give up and walked towards Chi Xiaoyue.

He circled slowly around her instead of attacking right away, wanting to see some clues or potentially fatal openings.

The confusing part was that due to the way she was sitting, she was wide open. Any move would be fatal in this scenario.

This made it difficult for him. If an expert had one or two, then those would definitely be mistakes. In this case, they weren’t actually openings. He didn’t know how to start attacking her at all.

Meanwhile, the spectators watched with bated breath, wanting to see Chi Xiaoyue’s next move.

The ancestors were immensely involved with observing her method of breaking Force Devourer. Learning this would mean a lifetime of benefits.

Just think about it, being able to solve a chapter from Evil Devourer was extraordinary.

“Clank!” After a full circle, Liu Huaishi still didn’t know whether to start. Nonetheless, he still decided to release golden laws from his whip. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, the laws were aimed at her surroundings instead, completely trapping her inside. Not even water could get through.

“Now!” Liu Huaishi lashed and the whip instantly appeared above Chi Xiaoyue’s head. It lingered above and became resplendent.

The dao laws around her also started resonating with the whip. As the light became brighter, a formation eventually appeared on the ground beneath her, the same with the whip above.

It was apparent that Liu Huaishi wanted to trap her in this formation.

“What is she waiting for?” The spectators became nervous for her.

“Clank!” Both the formations exuded golden rays that envelope her. Liu Huaishi also activated Force Devourer. Time and space began to twist along with Chi Xiaoyue’s body.

“It’s getting too dangerous, she needs to do something!” One spectator said. If this continued, she would break down to pieces.

Some shifted their gaze towards Li Qiye again only to find the guy not doing anything.

“Please do something!” A student from Duality was scared out of his mind.

Unfortunately, Xiaoyue had no reaction despite the twisting of her body.

“Die!” Liu Huaishi finally made his move. The golden rays then turned into thousands of swords, ready to pierce through.

She was being affected by Force Devourer and shouldn’t be able to resist.
