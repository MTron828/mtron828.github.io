“Splash!” A tsunami appeared out of nowhere above the sky. It instantly engulfed everything. Just one bubble alone could destroy a star.

This seemed to be the river in the world, impossible for anyone to cross. All would feel insignificant before its immensity. Just a tiny wave would drown people instantly, no, even their world would succumb.

Resistance was futile; True Gods were no exception for they would drown instantly.

“What is that?” The crowd rightfully became afraid of the currents.

“Raa!” A beast roar echoed across the realms. The stars trembled from the soundwaves and could fall down at any moment.

A gigantic figure appeared above the river causing splashes to go everywhere. It was an elephant, as white as ivory and shrouded with a sacred light. Scintillating runes blessed the beast, making it look like it was made from a heavenly star.

Though the river could drown the world and wash away the sun, this elephant was unaffected during the crossing. Each step was firm and loud, seemingly carrying massive weight - more than enough to crush everything in the world. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“River-crossing Elephant, one of the twelve variations of the Martial Ancestor!” An elder shouted.

Everyone took a deep breath after hearing this, albeit, with difficulty due to the immense pressure of the absolute weight. They felt numerous mountains pressing down on them, wishing to break their spine in half.

Those who were familiar with Vermillion have heard of the twelve variations. This was the strongest merit law of this system, created by the Martial Ancestor. Rumor has it that this was the top technique of his life.

In the distant past, this technique swept through the world. People couldn’t handle half of a variation, let alone the whole thing.

Later on, Vermillion only had five left, losing seven. Few in the system were eligible to learn these five techniques; the matron was one of them.

This was the first time some ancestors here have seen this technique. It was indeed worthy of its fame, especially when it came from such a powerful being.

“Boom!” The stomp of the elephant resembled the stomp of a peerless master.

The ground cracked, seemingly so fragile. Even a True God would instantly turn into meat paste. People looked over at Li Qiye and thought that he wouldn’t be able to handle it.

“Unfortunately, you only learned the bare minimum.” Li Qiye smiled; his eyes became resplendent - more than enough to illuminate the endless space.

“Supreme.” He uttered a mantra.

Everyone suddenly heard a thump; a dao heart seemed to have fluttered.

This tiny movement was more than enough. Just one thump rendered everything into non-existence.

An entirely new world appeared, or just an emulation of one. A heaven and earth appeared, then living creatures.

A supreme figure walked out from the depth of this world. Peerlessly mighty, each of his gestures carried a martial intent. Just one simple step encompassed the essences of martial arts. Every fiber of his being breathed fighting.

“Martial Ancestor!” The matron cried out.

The crowd was astounded. How could this amazing existence appear in this place?

“What, it’s really him...” Another ancestor lost his cool and bellowed.

Though he has never seen the real person, this being looked exactly the same as the pictures and portraits back in Vermillion. The matron had seen these artworks before so she became horrified.

“Boom!” This figure took action, sweeping away the world with one palm and creating a tsunami in the process. This force could destroy three thousand worlds.

Windchaser Matron’s river was massive enough, but it looked like a tiny stream versus this one.

“Boom!” An even bigger elephant showed up and stomped down, annihilating the celestials.

One was a mature elephant while the former was a mere baby, too weak to handle a single blow.

“The same move...” The crowd didn’t know what was going on.

Martial Ancestor showed up and unleashed the same technique - just superior in every way and a thousand times stronger and more complex.

The matron herself had no clue whether this was real or not.

“Is it just an illusion?” One ancestor murmured because Martial Ancestor has been gone for a long time.

Wu Bingning thought she was seeing things as well. How could this be happening?

The elephant of Martial Ancestor crushed the matron’s river into nothingness. Her elephant cried out pitifully and became meat paste.

“It’s real!” The result showed everyone that this was real indeed.

The elephant then turned its focus at the matron and stomped down. The matron couldn’t handle such a massive force.

“Please show mercy!” Bingning cried out in horror.

Though she didn’t like Windchaser Matron, the old woman was still a member of Vermillion.

“Bam!” The matron was stomped on and started vomiting blood. She couldn’t move at all.

“Buzz.” Martial Ancestor and the technique disappeared, replaced by Li Qiye. The aura around him was also gone.

Not one in the crowd could comprehend this development. If it wasn’t for the matron being suppressed on the ground, people who would have thought that this was all an illusory trick from Li Qiye.

That wasn’t the case, so what the hell happened? It didn’t look like a merit law or a technique. It was mysterious and bizarre.
