Chapter 3693: Bronze Statue

The return of the Grand Commander and Grand Chancellor stirred up the dynasty. The two have always been scheming against each other but now, many speculated that they were going to team up in order to deal with Li Qiye.

“Young Master, my, my father wishes for me to return.” Yang Ling received a summon from her clan during the turmoil.

“Go back then.” Li Qiye smiled and nodded.

“I’m afraid... that something might happen. The messenger said that my father’s expression wasn’t so good.” She looked nervous since the messenger secretly told her about the situation.

She was there by Li Qiye’s side during the killing. There was a chance that the Li and the Zhang would target her as well.

Her father was a noble and this title was hereditary. The clan wasn’t under the jurisdiction of the two big shots either. Alas, the Li and the Zhang were just too influential in Vajra.

If they wanted to cause trouble, it would be quite unfavorable for the Yang.

“A time of chaos.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“What, what if those two clans want to capture me?” She hesitated for a bit before asking. She certainly stood no chance against those two behemoths.

“Don’t worry, I’m here. You’re in no danger since I can handle anything.” Li Qiye answered: “It’s good if they want to do something, there will be a fun show.” He revealed a smirk at this point.

She felt much better after hearing this since she trusted that he would keep his word.

“Then I’ll take a trip back.” She took a deep breath and bowed.

He nodded and gave permission. She went to pack up her stuff before returning to say goodbye once more time then left with her clan members.

Both Metropolis, Buddha Emperor Division, and especially the capital, were busy with the incoming storm. Some didn’t want to get involved in this mess.

On the other hand, Li Qiye didn’t give a damn and continued to cultivate.

Someone visited not long after Yang Ling’s departure. The first thing one would notice about the guest was his shiny bald head and colorful kasaya.

Who else could it be but Untethered Monk?

“Amitabha.” The monk bowed deeply towards Li Qiye and said: “How should I address you, Sir?” He took a glance at the bronze ring on Li Qiye’s finger.

“You tell me.” Li Qiye accepted the gesture and remained sitting.

“Well, I’m no longer part of the Buddhist doctrine. I am a merchant now.” The monk smiled while acting prudence. He rarely needed to act in this manner.

This ring was a big deal. If he was still a part of Heavenly Dragon Temple, then he would be subjected to certain restrictions and rules. This wasn’t the case since he was now the chief manager of Wish Ward.

“Forget it, it’s fine. You may call me Young Master. Although you might not be in a Buddhist sect, your heart is still with Buddhism.” Li Qiye said.

“Thank you, Young Master.” The monk bowed again.

Li Qiye was right. He had left Heavenly Dragon Temple and some considered him a traitor. Nonetheless, he still cared deeply about the temple since he was born there.

“What is it?” Li Qiye asked.

“Young Master, I heard you came to Wish Ward to look for precious metals. Our auction house coincidentally has some top types right now, some found by us, others on consignment. Would you like to take a look?”

“Your information network isn’t bad.” Li Qiye smiled.

The monk was clearly here to curry favor.

“You’re too kind, Young Master. The metals are in our treasury, shall we go?” The monk smiled.

“Alright.” Li Qiye wasn’t in a rush to find the metals but if the monk actually had something good, it would be fine.

In reality, he had no lack of precious metals if he actually needed them.

“After you, Young Master. It is an honor to have you here in Wish Ward.” The monk smiled brightly and gestured for Li Qiye to walk in front. He then showed Li Qiye the way to the treasury.

Wish Ward stood for two different things. The first was the overall market available to everyone in the form of a city. It was large enough to be comparable to other great powers.

The second referred to the actual store named Wish Ward, a subdivision within the area. It also had a large auction house.

Branches like these scattered across the holy ground and even Righteous Sect. One could find them back in the southern kingdoms as well.

The one here was the main branch, situated at the center of the city. Because of its presence, the city continued to grow, on the verge of becoming as large as Metropolis or Buddha Emperor Division.

The entrance, surprisingly, didn’t look grand and splendorous. It was a normal wooden gate, quite old judging by the tint of the wood. Nonetheless, it had an elegant appeal to it.

The power and resources of Wish Ward only came into full view after entering. Inside was a great courtyard with lakes and mountains. This was a separate dimension, allowing the store to look like a great sect with boundless territories.

It didn’t stink of money at all like another auction house. The beautiful scenery comforted the spectators.

Li Qiye stopped after arriving and stared at a large bronze statue. Albeit, there was a unique distinction - it resembled more of an art piece built in a medley fashion than a regular statue.

The entire thing wasn’t in one piece but rather countless parts assembled together. The fit was perfect.

It looked natural as well, seemingly not made by men but already had this form from its inception. The great entity stood there and stared at the horizon as if it was the ruler of the world.

Since it has been here for so long, vines and weeds covered the bottom. However, the lack of rust was surprising. It still had a bronze glow, ready to last for another eternity.

Untethered Monk stopped and waited for Li Qiye, staring and appreciating the statue as well.

“Young Master, did you gain anything?” The monk asked after Li Qiye averted his gaze.

Numerous people have stared at this statue but few could do so for long. Moreover, Li Qiye was special as well. The monk couldn’t miss this opportunity to ask.

“Gain? No. I do know of its origin though.” Li Qiye smiled. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You’re aware of its origin? Does that mean you can control it?” The monk became ecstatic.

“You know quite a bit.” Li Qiye glanced at the monk.

“It’s nothing, I’ve only heard from the seniors from the auction house. This status is apparently quite old. An ancestor from Wish Ward excavated from a great sect. The founder of this sect took it from a secret area. Many seniors have checked it out to no avail. It’s definitely not just a statue though.” The monk smiled wryly.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye smiled.
