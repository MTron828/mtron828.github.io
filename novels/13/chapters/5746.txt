Chapter 5747: The Founder Of Celestial Court

The boat stopped after the compass no longer displayed a clear direction with its light.

“Right here.” Li Qiye glanced around before smiling and tossing the thing into the river.

“Boom!” He formed a mudra as it sank to the bottom.

A unique light appeared next and a seal manifested into reality. This thing could hide anywhere and never be detected.

The thing thrown started melting and fused with the seal, causing something beneath to move.

“Boom!” A platform rose to the surface, carrying something with the semblances of a coffin - perhaps a treasure meant for nourishment.

A woman lay inside with her eyes closed, cradling a black sword. She had a tall and well-proportioned figure, dressed in a black attire outlining her voluptuous curves. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

She had the aura of an unsheathed divine sword, exuding a merciless killing intent. Although she was in a deep slumber, this murderous intent raged on.

Li Qiye sighed while staring at her and removed the seal.

“From the beginning of Immemorial Epoch War.” Meru uttered, aware of certain things after being in Celestial Court for so long: “They searched for a long time but couldn’t find her, so she was buried here. Who is this familiar with Celestial Court?”

Despite his skepticism, he didn’t dwell on this matter.

“Buzz.” Her eyes flashed murderously the moment the seal was lifted.

She clenched her sword, wanting to attack. Her murderous intent could pierce through the heart of emperors before the sword itself.

“It’s alright, don’t be agitated.” Li Qiye grabbed her wrist and said.

“Young Master!” She looked at his face and couldn’t believe her own eyes.

She thought that this was a dream. She had eagerly awaited his return, longing to see his face again.

Even during the moment of sure death, her final thought was regretting not surviving long enough for another meeting. Just one time would have been enough.

Now, the first face she saw upon waking up was none other than his. Although her heart was as firm as iron and as cold as a death god’s aura, she still couldn’t help but tightly embrace him.

He hugged her back and gently patted her back: “Now, now, the tribulation is over, the road ahead will be smoother.”

“Young Master...” She repeated - all of her emotions were contained in these two words.

The merciless chill melted and she became satisfied even if this were her final dream.

“Is this a dream?” She couldn’t help but ask.

He gently pinched her cheek and said: “Wouldn’t hurt if it’s a dream.”

“It’s not a dream...” She didn’t want to let go while staring at him.

It took a while before she calmed down and returned to her normal self - the cold woman always chasing after the sword dao.

Nonetheless, her aura was less intense than usual in his presence. There seemed to be a hint of spring amidst the wintry mountains.

“I didn’t expect to meet you again, Young Master.” Bai Jianzhen said.

“That would have been the case if your luck was a tiny bit less, you nearly died here.” He smiled.

“I was foolish.” She had matured, no longer having the same blind pride and confidence as before. Nonetheless, she seemed like a young girl again before Li Qiye.

“We came to gather information but then, we saw him, the mysterious guest.” She continued.

“You saw that he was weakened and wanted to kill him.” Li Qiye said.

“We thought that we could end it with a single move, how blind of us.” She lowered her head in embarrassment.

“There was something more to it than just luck, you two stood no chance.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Right, someone else blocked the move.” She recalled the past and how sorely she overestimated her strength.

“The founder of Celestial Court.” Li Qiye understood what happened.

“We immediately ran after the failed attack, their pursuit was relentless.” She said, having barely fought her way through the attackers.

“In my opinion, we should have been caught.” She frowned and continued.

“Yes, so why did you manage to escape?” Li Qiye smiled.

“He held back, the founder.” She recalled the scenes.

“The question is why.” Li Qiye said.

“This founder is rather mysterious and doesn’t meet with anyone else in Celestial Court, let alone making moves.” Meru interjected.

“He’s a human.” Jianzhen said confidently.

“A human?” Meru was surprised to hear this. Anyone else would feel the same way after finding out that the founder of Celestial Court was a human.

Jianzhen felt the same way. The founder should have been one of the three great races, not a human.

“Was it to bait you here, Young Master?” Jianzhen speculated.

“Who knows? Just baiting me shouldn’t have led to a war.” Li Qiye said.

The two women’s attempt at assassinating the mysterious guest infuriated Celestial Court, prompting them to declare The People as sinners.

The actual person giving out the decree was unknown. Was it the founder or someone else? All in all, this initiated the war now known as Immemorial Epoch.
