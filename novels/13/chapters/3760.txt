Chapter 3761: Too Confusing

A bronze ring was attached to the string instead of a hook. It seemed strangely moist and shiny as if it had drunk enough water from the creek.

It obviously couldn’t drink or absorb water; it merely gave off that strange impression. After being filled, the ring seemingly came back to life as if it was sentient - ready to turn into a creature, such as a true dragon, and soar among the clouds.

Dugu Lan became startled. She never saw this ring before but had heard of her master talking about it. She couldn’t believe that he was using it as fish bait. His intent remained unknown.

Initially, she assumed that it would be something strange like a hook without bait or having a strange shape.

This didn’t seem to be the case at all. His goal was something else entirely.

“Young Master, what?” She didn’t know what to say; her eyes darting back and forth between Li Qiye and the ring.

“Just fishing since I have nothing else to do.” Li Qiye chuckled.

She naturally didn’t buy it. The ring was peerless and had paramount significance in the holy ground. No one else would be as careless as him with it.

“Sigh, this crappy place is annoying me now, so troublesome. Should I just burn it to a crisp?” Li Qiye seemed unhappy about something. He then casually tossed the ring down the creek.

“Splash! The ring floated away with the string still connected. The latter seemed to be quite long.

She was still afraid despite knowing that he wasn’t going to throw it away like this. Her next focus became his intent.

Was there something special about this creek? She took a look at the water but didn’t find anything peculiar. Nonetheless, he must have a reason for his action.

“Curious?” Li Qiye smiled at her.

“I just don’t get it.” She stopped looking at the water and answered while touching her hair.

“Have you been to Sacred Mountain?” Li Qiye suddenly asked.

“Sacred Mountain?” She shook her head: “No, few are qualified to get there, only the top characters of the holy ground. I heard that the four grandmasters have done so to meet the supreme.”

Sacred Mountain was the ultimate symbol of authority at the holy ground - its true ruler. It remained elusive throughout history but still maintained a firm grasp. It was impossible to visit without an invitation. Those lucky enough to be eligible were amazing existences.

“That’s why you don’t understand. Of course, you might not even after going up there.” Li Qiye smilingly nodded.

She pondered in silence. It was too hard to understand someone like Li Qiye.

“Take a look at the land. Say, what if one day, all of it will be in your grasp. What do you think about that?” Li Qiye casually asked.

“In my grasp?” She was slightly jolted before regaining her composure, being smart enough to understand what he meant.

She had impressive mental fortitude but it still took her a while to regain her wits. She took a deep breath and said: “You’re joking, Young Master.”

“What if I’m not?” Li Qiye stared at her.

She became speechless; her mind empty. A while later, she answered: “Young Master, I don’t think I’m suitable.”

“Oh? Elaborate.” He smirked.

“If that falls upon me, I’m afraid I’ll lose to the scion before the battle even starts. It becomes something more than just a personal duel. Winning is absolutely essential and I can’t handle that, whether it be my state of mind or abilities. I rather fight while representing myself and nothing more. I know that I will most likely lose but fighting a top genius will be truly beneficial. I don’t mind the loss of reputation in that case.” She became solemn and continued: “My goal is to seek the mysteries of the dao and hope to reach the apex, not authority and fame.”

“Correct.” Li Qiye nodded and praised: “You’re not the most talented or the smartest but you truly know and follow your heart. This is quite rare. Your potential is limitless. You might lose to Righteous Scion in the incoming battle but who knows what the future will bring.”

“Thank you, Young Master.” She bowed towards him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Go now.” Li Qiye said and closed his eyes again.

She bowed one more time before floating away.

The news of the scion’s challenge spread across the holy ground. It didn’t take long before the start of the event.

“Righteous Scion is here!”

The news of him setting foot on the border traveled like a storm and shocked everyone. Who would dare to fight him outside of Dugu Lan?

He didn’t bring an army for the trip, only a few followers. Nonetheless, he still commanded attention along the way.

He rode on a war chariot with a few riders in front and back - that’s it. As he came from the east with this humble group, his momentum and aura were still wondrous.

The war chariot was made of bronze, looking quite ancient and full of scars from blades and arrows. It emitted a ferocious battle intent, capable of crushing everything in its path.

A fierce beast pulled the carriage. It had snow-white fangs and bony outgrowths on its spine, seemingly ready to pierce the sky. Nothing could stop this combination from moving onward.

The scion stood on top with both hands behind his back. He wore a purple robe, looking as gallant as can be.

He seemed to be a deity in control of lightning and clouds. The world seemed to be rotating around him. Just one hand wave of his could command thunderbolts to descend and slay an entire army.
