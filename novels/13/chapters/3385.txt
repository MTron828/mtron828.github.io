“Clank!” The glint of the sword illuminated the ages and all within.

“They’re actually patrimony weapons!” The crowd became aghast since they could sense the terrible sword energy.

These swords were created by Three Truths Dao Lord as one set, comparable to the patrimony sword of South Conch Dao Lord.

While still sheathed, the auras from the three terrorized the area, seemingly unbeatable.

So many experts were in awe because it felt as if a dao lord was here in person. The weaker cultivators got down on the ground. Some felt the urge to prostrate.

“Go!” Lu Yiling roared and the energies from the three swords immediately entered his heavy one.

“Boom!” He seemed to be blessed by a dao lord and his patrimony sword.

The evenly-matched contest between the two gigantic swords ceased instantly. The heavy sword of Yiling immediately sent its opponent flying.

This was the same for Suoweng. He spat out a stream of blood looking like a miniature red rainbow.

“No!!!” The members of Divine Black bellowed. Their sect would be finished with Suoweng’s defeat.

“Tree, aid me!” The bodhi king who was fighting against the saber master immediately left his battlefield. He crossed through the sky and called for help.

The Immortal Cassia instantly appeared behind Suoweng along with the bodhi king.

His thousand hands borrowed the momentum of the land; the power of Thousand Demons Peak’s formation poured into Suoweng’s body.

Suoweng’s internal chaotic flows stabilized with the bodhi king’s help. Next, his chaos true energy surged like a tornado.

“Clank!” His sword rays became as bright as ten rising suns.

His gigantic sword gained tailwind and became larger, piercing upward to join the stars.

“Now!” Suoweng roared and made his move. The sword above erupted with power and cut downward, destroying the celestials and the myriad dao in the process.

“So strong, that’s enough to flatten an entire sect!” Many experts exclaimed.

“Well done!” Lu Yiling was actually ecstatic to see such an amazing slash and met it with his heavy sword.

“Clank!” He directly confronted it while exerting the power of a dao lord to its limit. Everyone had an illusion that a dao lord was actually the one swinging - enough to destroy all evils.

“This is the power of a patrimony weapon. I can’t fathom how terrible it will be after they leave their sheathe.” A clan elder praised.

This woke up the crowd. True, Lu Yiling was only borrowing a portion of the swords’ power. This wasn’t its limit at all.

“I wonder if he can actually control them and for how long?” A spectator became curious.

A patrimony weapon was equivalent to a full-force blow from a dao lord. Thus, they truly wanted to see it in action.

“Boom!” The two swords collided once more. The world turned dark as a result before being blinded by bright sparks. They came down like a thousand meteors and horrified the spectators.

“Rumble!” Explosions detonated continuously.

The two swords once again became evenly matched after the power boosts.

“This might be okay for Divine Black?” One spectator said after witnessing the exchange.

“They’re unlucky facing a genius like Lu Yiling. Without him, I think Three Truths would fail for sure.” Another expert said softly.

Many nodded in agreement. Lu Yiling had left a deep impression on them. He was indeed a great genius. It was only a matter of time for him to become a Heavenly Sovereign.

“I shouldn’t be taking a break right now.” Heavenly Saber Master smiled after losing his opponent. He didn’t give chase and moved towards Divine Black instead.

“Over there!” Some spectators noticed this.

The bodhi king and Suoweng couldn’t do anything in response. They were preoccupied with Lu Yiling.

Meanwhile, Three Truths Sect Master and the drill were still attacking Divine Black. Many layers of crystal barriers have collapsed.

Though the members of Divine Black did everything in order to repair the barriers, the recovery speed was slower than the destruction. Thus, it was only a matter of time before failure.

“Let me lend you a hand.” The saber master unleashed a tsunami of slashes towards the crystal barriers.

“Boom! Boom!” Little pieces scattered as more barriers crumbled.

The sect master and the drill have already done a great job. Now, with the help of another sacred cultivator, the barriers collapsed like dried branches. The power of two sacred cultivators together was enormous.

“Boom!” The repair effort became useless at this point. The final layer exploded, signaling the end of the grand formation.

The drill instantly made it in and crushed numerous buildings.

“Ahh!” Seeing the monstrous artifact scared the hell out of the disciples. They fled back to the main peaks since they couldn’t stop it with their power.

“Rumble!” The saber master and Three Truths Sect Master moved towards the ancestral peak with no one daring to stand in their way. The remaining defensive lines couldn’t stop two sacred cultivators.

Meanwhile, on the other side, the white tiger, the shield, and the jade bird were all pushed back by their respective foe. They lost considerable power after the fall of the grand formation.

Divine Black was being forced back while the army of Three Truths took advantage of this and entered the gate. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“This is the end.” The spectators said while shaking their head.

“Divine Black won’t exist past today.” One of them sighed and lamented.

The bodhi king and Suoweng were barely keeping up with Lu Yilin. There was nothing they could do to help.

“Retreat!” Mountainbearer King and Zhang Yue gave the command to retreat because the enemies had all the momentum. They needed to regroup below the ancestral peak.

“Today is the end of Divine Black!” Three Truths Sect Master declared.

“Destroy them!” The army shouted before rushing towards the ancestral peak.
