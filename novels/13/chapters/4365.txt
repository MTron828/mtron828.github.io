Chapter 4366: I Insist

“Young Noble, I’m afraid there is a misunderstanding. The roost is not open to outsiders.” Goldbird Monarch responded with a serious tone.

This was the polite response. Anyone else would have been answered with criticism.

After all, no one would open an important location of their sect to an outsider. It had to be someone special.

Li Qiye was only the sect master from a tiny sect, utterly insignificant. This request could have ended with death. A big shot might just slap this ignorant sect master and crush him.

Goldbird didn’t do anything because Li Qiye was considered an esteemed guest.

Meanwhile, Elder Hu started panicking because Li Qiye’s request was rather disrespectful.

“I’m not asking, I’m telling you ahead of time because you seem to be smart.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

Listeners became slack-jawed as a result. Even the monarch couldn’t believe Li Qiye’s imperious attitude.

Given his speech and mannerism, anyone could see that he didn’t give a damn about Phoenix Ground. He acted as a great master talking to a nobody and his warning was out of kindness.

This was indeed the truth but no one viewed it this way. They attributed it to him being arrogant and ignorant.

Although the monarch believed that Li Qiye was special due to his daughter’s warning, this went beyond that. It was difficult for someone of his status to endure the perceived contempt.

Anyone else would become furious. As a demon monarch, he had already put away his pride to come and greet this sect master. On the other hand, there was a clear lack of reciprocation. The guy acted as if he was a mere ant.

“Ridiculous!” A demon standing next to him lost his cool and shouted: “The roost isn’t the place for you to do as you please!”

In fact, this demon held back greatly out of respect for the monarch. He thought about just slapping Li Qiye.

The monarch took a deep breath and waved his hand to calm the raging crowd and himself. This was a testament to his patience and amicable personality.

“Young Noble Li, this is not because of you, it’s just that the roost isn’t open. Even our disciples aren’t allowed to enter.” He repeated.

“Oh? What does that have to do with me?” Li Qiye continued.

This only served to further infuriate the demons.

“Young Noble, it sounds as if you wish to trespass!” The monarch had a hard time keeping his composure.

“I’m afraid you can’t stop me.” Li Qiye smiled. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You! Such impudence!” Another demon furiously shouted.

Li Qiye insisted on trespassing at an important location in their sect. This was too much to handle. The monarch himself was an experienced combatant and had dominated numerous battlefields.

He didn’t appreciate being treated in this manner as he spoke sternly: “Young Noble, this isn’t a joke. If you choose to trespass, you’ll be injured since blades do not have eyes. I won’t be able to help you then.”

He sincerely warned Li Qiye because experts and ancestors from Phoenix Ground would show no mercy.

“Yes, blades do not have eyes. I advise you all to not try to stop me but if you do, prepare extra coffins. I will be nice and leave your corpses intact.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I’ve had enough!” The demons behind the monarch either grasped or unsheathed their weapons.

Li Qiye didn’t seem to notice their aggression and stood there calmly. As for his allies, they were nervous.

It was so friendly earlier but now, weapons have been raised.

The monarch became livid at this point, nearly raising his voice at Li Qiye. Nonetheless, his daughter’s warning echoed in his mind so he endured.

“Why are you so confident, Young Noble?” He asked.

Breaking into the roost was a serious matter yet Li Qiye made it clear that he didn’t mind an all-out battle against Phoenix Ground.

“Did you think I came here to negotiate?” Li Qiye stared at him.

Li Qiye was gazing at him as if he was a pitiful idiot. This was a new experience for him but this time around, his anger subsided. This question illuminated the circumstances - Li Qiye didn’t come to Dragon to negotiate.
