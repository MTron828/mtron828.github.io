Chapter 5210: Seal The Dao Heart

Malice has yet to warm the seat before being rudely demanded to leave by Jue Xian’er.

As an evil cultivator, he had never been afraid of anyone and wouldn’t tolerate such disrespect. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What do you want?” He unsheathed his weapon and turned the sky dark with his evil energy.

“Rumble!” The dark maelstrom became larger and devoured the sky above them.

“What a dreadful aura.” The big shots trembled after seeing this.

An eleven-fruit dragon lord wasn’t the strongest cultivator here but still possessed immense destructive capability.

“You court death.” Jue Xian’er focused her murderous intent on Malaice.

“Die!” The other immediately attacked after seeing the escalation. An evil sword came out from the center of the maelstrom.

Everyone felt as if there was a dark eye staring at their very soul and sealing their movement. The sword instantly thrust toward her chest; its aura stagnated reaction time.

“Clank!” However, Jue Xian’er had enough time to summon her weapon - a long iron chain of a crimson color.

At first, it looked like a regular chain but after careful observation, one would find that it was made of countless laws imbued with the most precious metals.

“Immortal Piercer!” Regular cultivators shouted.

“So there it is.” A conqueror put on a serious expression.

“Oh?” Li Qiye who was heading toward Imperial Gate felt something. He turned around and saw the crimson chain, becoming slightly surprised.

“It’s called Immortal Piercer now?” He murmured at the weapon that was in his possession once.

“Boom!” The chain had no problem crushing the evil sword so Malice turned to flee but it was already too late.

“Ahh!” He bellowed in agony as the chain pierced his heart. His true fate and sacred fruits couldn’t escape either due to the chain’s sealing property.

She pulled back and dragged everything out of his body in a gruesome manner. Next, she commanded the chain to wrap tightly and obliterate the true fate and sacred fruits.

A feared dragon lord met his demise just like that. She didn’t need to use any technique to kill him.

“The chain deserves its reputation.” The others turned pale after seeing this.

Some conquerors had imagined themselves facing the chain before. Even apex conquerors wouldn’t be confident because they couldn’t see a single flaw within the chain.

“The chain affects the dao heart, only the dao heart can break free.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head after seeing this.”

The world has yet to understand the method to deal with the chain. Thus, she became a dreadful figure even for top cultivators.

“This thing shouldn’t be in this world.” Boss Tang’s voice came from the ship.

“You know about it?” She stared at the ship but he didn’t respond.

She didn’t push the issue and sat down on the last throne. With that, all thirteen have been taken.

If anyone else wanted to join, they would have to kick out one of the current participants.

“Now we just have to wait for the auction to start.” Someone murmured.

“I wonder if anyone else will try to grab a spot.” A big shot said.

“Get off!” Sure enough, someone shouted and stomped on the character “Imperial” belonging to Imperial Attendant.

“Such impudence.” Li Qiye frowned after seeing this.

“You dare?!” A figure leaped out of Qilin Manor in a flashy manner and activated Resplendent Array to stop the attack.

“Boom!” The foot destroyed the array and forced the combatant to show himself.

This was none other than Resplendent Monarch whose chest was heaving up and down while staggering backward in the air.

The one wishing to destroy the rune “Imperial” was an old man whose hair fluttered to the wind, looking like the quills of a hedgehog.

Loud detonations erupted where he stood since he showed no sign of restraining his power.

“Get back!” Others immediately retreated while the big shots were surprised to see him.

“Impetuous!” Resplendent Monarch’s expression soured.

This cultivator was Supreme’s rival once. Supreme eventually outmatched him and became the leader of Heaven Alliance.

Nonetheless, Impetuous was still a renowned dragon lord with twelve sacred fruits and an overbearing fighting style.
