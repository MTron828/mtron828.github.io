Chapter 5027: I’m Just A Passerby

Wild Dragon had relied on this blade to kill numerous powerful foes. He went into a frenzy and started slashing with indiscernible swiftness.

Demon became a chopping board as he did his thing, wanting to make mincemeat out of everything.

Seeing the countless slashes scared the hell out of spectators. Not only were the blades immensely sharp, but they also wielded unbearable temperature. This widened the area of effect.

Fortunately, all of them gathered into a single slash on the same target - Li Qiye. Space itself melted into a frightening black hole around him. This attack had more destruction than Radiant Monarch’s technique.

However, Li Qiye performed an upward palm strike and smashed the blade. Everyone thought that this was suicidal and he might lose a hand.

In reality, he sent the slash right back at Wild Dragon, instantly crushing the light barrier. Since Wild Dragon was in his large form, his mobility was limited and dodging was impossible.

He smashed into the ground, pulverized with numerous broken bones. He struggled for a bit before flying up into the air, revealing the shattered draconic scales. Some wounds were deep enough to see the bones beneath.

“Zzz…” Lava gushed out and healed the wounds.

It took a while for the crowd to digest the information - four dragon lords tried their best technique only to fail against Li Qiye. This was utterly unbelievable since Li Qiye made it look so easy.

Members of the alliance were pale and regretted underestimating the enemy.

“Where the hell did he come out from?” Everyone wondered about Li Qiye’s background.

This terrifying cultivator shouldn’t be unknown to the world. However, none had heard his name before. He seemed to have come out of thin air overnight.

Guardian Pagoda and Skystomper thought that they were very lucky for choosing not to fight. Tendril King knew that Li Qiye would be stronger than anyone here. He wouldn’t lose against this team but she didn’t expect him to dominate so hard.

She realized that giving him the god source fragment was a great decision. This saved her life on top of making him owe her a favor.

Golden Cicada King stood there in a daze. He couldn’t think of anyone capable of matching Li Qiye outside of the founder gods.

His enemies were also panicking, albeit trying to keep it to a minimum. They initially thought that the four of them should be enough to win and even capture Li Qiye.

“Where are you from, Fellow Daoist?” Radiant Monarch asked, thinking that only Conceal Conqueror had a chance against Li Qiye.

“From where I should be.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Are you from the upper two continents?” Radiant Monarch asked with a serious expression.

Others heard this and became emotional.

“From the upper continents?” They took a deep breath.

“Seems plausible.” One demon monarch murmured.

Radiant Monarch and his allies have been around for a long time and knew everyone on the lower continents. However, they had no idea about Li Qiye’s existence.

Someone couldn’t become this strong without making a name for himself. It required polishment and training, not to mention numerous battles. Therefore, he had to be from the upper continents.

This frightened people even more. If this were the case, then which faction was he from? Celestial Alliance? Imperial Alliance? Maybe even Celestial Court or Immortal Dao City? What was his purpose for descending?

“I am a mere passerby, not from the upper continents.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Of course, they remained skeptical due to his power level.

“You all got anything else or is this it?” Li Qiye asked while staring at them.

This sounded contemptuous if it came from anyone other than Li Qiye. Alas, he had proven himself superior to his opponents.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
