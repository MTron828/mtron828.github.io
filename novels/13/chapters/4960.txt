Chapter 4961: All Present

Releasing the three was obviously the best choice for Li Qiye’s future. There was no need to dwell on this decision.

He has already become famous after defeating them. Now, the feud between them could be resolved as well.

“I don’t think I will.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“Then it will be your last day in this world.” Arrow Saint answered menacingly.

“There are countless in line to say such words to me. In fact, you’re not even qualified to line up.” Li Qiye stunned the crowd with this response.

Arrow Saint might not be the strongest in the lower continents but could still dominate. He was far beyond the level of any young genius regardless of their potential.

His expression darkened. How could a prestigious dragon lord let a junior speak to him in this manner?

“You court death.” A murderous determination flashed in his eyes as he released the arrow.

“Whoosh!” Students felt as if their throat had just been struck by this lightning-fast arrow with no chance to scream.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This didn’t matter to Li Qiye; he reacted quickly by waving the dao controller in front of him.

The world spun in tumultuous disarray, causing Arrow Saint to falter and lose his footing. He stumbled backward, desperately trying to regain his balance as he took a dozen unsteady steps.

The students, meanwhile, were thrown off their feet, tumbling to the ground with ashen faces as they struggled to stand once more. It was one thing for the young monarch to fail; they could eventually accept this outcome.

Alas, even this powerful ancestor couldn’t beat the artifact? The power of this artifact was unreal, causing their eyes to turn red with jealousy.

“Skyquake…” Arrow Saint couldn’t believe it. He observed the fight earlier and assumed that the geniuses were still too weak and inaccurate.

Unfortunately, his three sacred fruits failed to stop him from being affected by the dao controller. He realized how terrifying it was after the personal experience.

“Buzz.” While everyone was lost in thought, a spatial ripple appeared above Bai Shaojin.

A hand came out of nowhere and caught him. In this split second, Li Qiye turned the dao controller and sent out a single strand of law.

“Boom!” This forced the kidnapper out as he was forced to use a cyclical dao wave to stop the strand.

“Bam!” This didn’t work because the delicate law crushed his dao and sent him flying with broken bones.

“A sect master acting like a thief, how shameful for Reincarnation.” Li Qiye said without looking at him.

This was none other than Reincarnation City Lord. Alas, the dao controller grievously wounded him.

He got up and tumbled backward, vomiting blood and turning pale. He had never seen such a formidable artifact before.

Students were stunned once more. That was a sneak attack yet the dao controller still dealt with it swiftly.

“If only I have it…” One student murmured, thinking about how to grab it from Li Qiye.

“Benevolence is unnecessary, there is no way it can compare to the dao controller.” Another boldly speculated.

Many agreed with this. Although they didn’t know the content of the treasury, they believed that these treasures couldn’t touch the dao controller. The choice was obvious to them.

Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord stared at the treasure intensely. They also gave up on Benevolence and changed the target.

Dragon lords such as them couldn’t beat the dao controller. This meant that it was far superior to dao lord weapons. No one could resist the temptation after seeing it in action.

“Ancestor, save me!” The broken Swordgrasp yelled.

The three of them were still being crushed by the laws. If this didn’t cease, their dao foundation and true fate would be obliterated soon enough.

“Let them go or you will regret your decision until death.” Reincarnation City Lord threatened.

He had thrown away his reputation recently due to the ambushes. Even his sect’s prestige was affected by his decision. However, this was not an empty threat since Li Qiye would be facing two great lineages.

“I hate being threatened the most.” Li Qiye smiled.

“This is not a threat!” A tsunami of demonic energy suddenly ravaged the area.

“Boom!” Stone Lion God’s return horrified the students.

It appeared that after they were defeated by the old man, they returned and stuck around near the academy, waiting for the right chance.

“Still one more rat, come out.” Li Qiye wasn’t surprised at his appearance at all.

“Pop!” Magnificent feathers appeared above, letting everyone know this cultivator’s identity.

“Oblivion Monarch.” The students expected it this time around.
