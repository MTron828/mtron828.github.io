Chapter 4452: Nest

Putting the dao sources aside, the most stirring thing was the bird nest resting on top of the branch.

It was magnificent, even outshining the incredible branch. The disparity was that of a firefly versus the moon.

It released immortal beams into the sky. They then erupted into infernos and released wondrous visual phenomena. It seemed that an immortal world was being open or that an immortal was descending.

Though this dimension was one of stagnation, the beams from the nest became the only thing that could make a difference.

Holy lotuses, deities chanting, divine citizens, the rotations of the worlds and heavens… Moreover, the nest had a special aura that demanded submission and reverence. The myriad realms seemed tiny in comparison.

This could be considered the throne of the universe. All living beings would undergo a pilgrimage to this place.

Those in the know would be shocked to see the materials required - phoenix wood refined by nine-cycle tribulations. The bottom was padded with azure tribulation grass.

These two things were desired by dao lords and even Immortal Emperors. Alas, they never got the chance of obtaining either.

Just one alone was impossible to find yet both materials were found in the same place. In fact, this could drive the lords and emperors crazy enough to risk it all. Either would be considered the greatest of treasure - an heirloom for eras to come.

In this case, they were used to build a simple nest. This might be the most expensive nest in existence.

Most importantly, it seemed to be blessed and protected by the seals and intents of numerous Immortal Emperors.

Because of this, it possessed power beyond imagination while being an unbreakable fortress. The world had a hard time withstanding its sheer weight, hence the special dimension.

The unique materials and the various empowerments elevated the nest into a supreme and inviolable entity. Those who dare to test it would risk destruction.

In a sense, this nest was more than a fortress. It represented authority and sovereignty over the nine worlds.

There was something lying in the nest. However, it has been shielded by the emperors so no one could see its true form. One had to forcefully break through all the seals before earning the privilege.

Li Qiye became rather sentimental while staring at the nest. As time passed, history gained numerous tales and legends.

Once upon a time before this nest, numerous youths ascended to the sky above the nine worlds.

In another era, the appearance of the nest caused quite a stir throughout the realms. During the era of the Ancient Ming, it became the symbol of hope…

Alas, these wondrous tales and characters eventually disappeared among the river of time. Future descendants no longer remembered the names of the brilliant emperors.

The same thing occurred to this nest during the Eight Desolaces Era. No one remembered the nest any longer nor its significance.

Memorable scenes flashed in his mind - a stubborn girl who wouldn’t give up cultivating, a kind-hearted boy observing the waves at dawn…

In fact, there were no longer any traces of some of these stories in Eight Desolaces. The flow of time was the only constant, nothing else could last forever with one exception - a dao heart firm enough to withstand the temporal battering.

Li Qiye took a deep breath and stopped thinking. He reached for the nest.

“Boom!” The powers of the nest immediately awakened. Flames rushed for him with enough force to treat all intruders as insects. Visual phenomena accompanied the inferno, ready to obliterate the unwelcomed guest. Imperious auras of Immortal Emperors woke up as well.

Majestic figures could be seen in the inferno; each capable of suppressing everything - Min Ren, Xue Xi, Mu Tian, Hong Tian, Qian Li, and many others…

Their combined might was too much for a single being to handle. This included Li Qiye from an emotional perspective. The eventful years filled with emotions returned, causing him to yearn for the past.

“Buzz.” He released his true fate and immortal rays. The dark hand behind the curtains and the ruler of the nine worlds have returned to loom above all else.

As he spread his palm to form a seal, everything came to a halt. Time started reversing back to the past. Images of a youth fighting a dragon, a woman fighting the heaven, a demon wielding lighting itself…

“The unforgettable years…” Li Qiye sighed and murmured. People always harkened back to their golden days when they were vigorous and ambitious. Beautiful memories were difficult to forget.

The seal from his hand moved forward and quelled the inferno. The majestic figures gradually dispersed as well.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
