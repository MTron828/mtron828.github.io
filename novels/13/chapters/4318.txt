Chapter 4319: As One Wishes

Everyone watched with bated breath because they knew the consequence of killing here. The beehive has been disturbed.

The ward belonged to the great powers so Li Qiye’s wanton disregard for the rules was contemptuous, to say the least.

Elder Hu became afraid because this was unprecedented. No one from a smaller sect had dared to kill in this area, lest they provoke the behemoths.

“It’s over.” He turned pale after seeing Li Qiye surrounded.

Sure, the sect master was probably strong enough to bring them out of here unscathed. Alas, even in this case, the ward would report their crime and stronger experts would pursue them later on.

Only Li Qiye remained calm as if this was no big deal.

“This is the end for Little Diamond.” The audience whispered.

Such impudence would not go unpunished. A light punishment would be merciful. The worst-case scenario would be sect destruction.

“Surrender now!” The leader roared.

The audience didn’t dare to breathe loudly after hearing the furious leader.

“What are you doing? Sheath your weapons.” Miss Ming interrupted and surprised everyone.

“Miss Ming.” The leader said: “Little Diamond Sect Master killed someone just now and broke our rules.”

This was indeed disrespectful to the ward. Moreover, Eight Tiger was related to Deer King, a member of Dragon.

Both the ward and Deer King couldn’t take this sitting down.

“Do you think I need a refresher course of the rules from you?” She said.

“But…” The leader was in a tough position. How could he answer to the higher-ups?

“Looks like Deer King did a terrible job with training. You should change your post.” Miss Ming’s expression darkened. There was something about her aura that intimidated the entire ward.

“My mistake, please excuse my stupidity, Miss Ming.” The leader realized that he had messed with the wrong person and lowered his head.

He received this position after being recommended by Deer King. Thus, he had no choice but to make life hard for Little Diamond’s members.

Deer King thought that he didn’t need to be involved in this mess. Just an order was enough to take care of Little Diamond.

Alas, this situation changed drastically the moment Miss Ming got involved. Though she was technically a maid, her master was a big shot and it wouldn’t be difficult for them to kick him out of his current position at the ward.

Thus, the leader didn’t dare to go against her despite wanting to curry favor with Deer King. He immediately put away his weapon and bowed towards Li Qiye. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The scene was strangely quiet since spectators were dumbfounded. Of course, Little Diamond’s members knew that she was doing this out of consideration for their sect master, not their sect.

But why would she do so? They couldn’t come up with an answer.

As for the rest of the audience, they wondered if Little Diamond had managed to climb up the right branch. Could they be carps swimming up the dragon gate?

First, they were assigned to the heaven-level rooms. Now, Miss Ming protected Li Qiye even though he had just killed Eight Tiger Sect Master.

“I apologize for our fellow disciples’ disrespect.” Miss Ming slightly bowed towards Li Qiye.

Li Qiye smiled and stretched: “It’s no big deal. I’m tired now and need to rest. Let’s hurry this up.”

His attitude surprised them once more. He was speaking to her as if she was a maid to be commanded.

Elder Hu thought that if they were in Li Qiye’s shoes, they would be enthusiastically thanking her for saving them.

“The audacity of this brat.” One crowd member whispered.

They didn’t know who she was. Nonetheless, given the reaction from the ward’s members, she was clearly someone important. Li Qiye’s attitude was overly haughty and borderline suicidal.

Strangely enough, she didn’t have a problem with this and ordered: “Prepare everything for the young noble.”

The leader didn’t dare to say no. Miss Ming had no problem with the guy’s attitude, let alone a nobody like him.

“Young Noble, just let us know if you need anything else.” Miss Ming added.

Everyone wondered how Li Qiye was receiving the best of treatments. He seemed to be an esteemed guest even at a prestigious place like the ward.

“Who the hell is backing Little Diamond?” This became the main question.

An elder speculated: “This new sect master must have a relationship with someone important. That’s the only explanation for this. Just who is he?”

Little Diamond had participated in numerous conferences in the past but this was unprecedented.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye’s group was led to the heaven-level area. They had their own courtyard as a result.

The grand style of this place showed that it was meant for big shots only. Not to mention the youths, even Elder Hu had never seen a place so extravagant before. Everything inside was expensive and precious.

“I think this courtyard is worth more than our sect.” An older disciple stared at the jade pillars inside.
