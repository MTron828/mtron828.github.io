Chapter 5339: Visitors

Zhitian listened and thought that Timewatcher had a point. Why must anima and everlasting life be the end goals of cultivation? This path had no end in sight.

“Everyone’s dao is different. Having a stopping point is fine.” Li Qiye said.

“Indeed, Sir.” Timewatcher had a wide smile, looking more like a playboy than a conqueror.

“So what makes you like Heaven’s Allure so much?” Zhitian remained curious.

“Hmm…” Timewatcher recalled the time spent with his crush and was visibly happy: “She is certainly gorgeous but there’s an intrinsic quality that makes her unforgettable. Spending time with her makes a man forget his ways. She is the ultimate prize in life, I’m sure, yet no one will claim it.”

“What will you do now?” Li Qiye asked with a smile.

“What can I do is the question.” Timewatcher smiled wryly and said: “I have no pursuit in life now since you destroyed the primal darkness. I don’t want to do anything now.”

“Not even cultivation? Zhitian asked.

“I’ve done that all my life and not much else. My time is limited now and I don’t share the same optimism as you for the future.” Timewatcher smiled.

Zhitian hadn’t thought about the future much but he knew that he was meant for great things.

“You’re old with one foot in the grave, Zhitian is a blooming genius, of course his future is limitless.” Li Qiye said.

“Indeed, which is why I need to make good use of the little time I have left.” Timewatcher said: “Well, given your bright future, perhaps you will be able to enter Celestial Court and see Heaven’s Allure one day.”

“How come you didn’t join Celestial Court to see her more often, Senior?” Zhitian was curious.

Although this question was rather personal, it was indeed logical. Timewatcher should have joined Celestial Court to spend more time with Celestial Court. Perhaps the close distance would make him more successful.

“Two entirely different matters.” Timewatcher said: “Can’t have it all in life. I like Heaven’s Allure but don’t want to lick Celestial Court’s stinky feet. I am willing to die for her but not bark like a hound for Celestial Court. Men have lines that they can’t cross and plus, if I had become a dog, she wouldn’t have respected me anyway.”

Zhitian had no response.

Timewatcher playfully patted his shoulder and said: “Well, a great genius like you need not lick anyone.”

The young and proper Zhitian turned red after hearing this. He truly had it all since birth - prestige and talent. Numerous saintesses and princesses were more than willing to be with him.

“However, allow me to give you one piece of advice.” Timewatcher said in a friendly manner: “Since you’re ambitious enough to seek anima, don’t ever get overconfident if you have the chance to see Heaven’s Allure. You best protect your dao heart or you will follow in my footsteps.”

“I appreciate the guidance, Senior.” Zhitian could tell that the guy was being sincere.

“Bang! Bang!” A visitor smacked the portal loudly and shouted: “Timewatcher, come out!”

The voice was imposing and powerful, clearly coming from a mighty cultivator.

Li Qiye was surprised because he recognized the voice.

“Big Bro, is all this commotion necessary?” Timewatcher laughed in response and opened the portal.

He had two visitors - an old man wearing a white robe and a clever-looking youth. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The former was surprised to see Li Qiye and bowed his head: “So you’re here too, Sir.”

“It’s been a while since our last meal.” Li Qiye smiled.

He was the owner of a noodle shop visited by Li Qiye and Jun Landu. The youth had worked there as a waiter.

“You must have done something and got captured.” The old man stared at Timewatcher and said.

“Haha, what are you saying? I’ve always been a good person and never broke any rules.” Timewatcher said.

“Is that so? Why did I have to save you back at the lower continents then?” The old man retorted.

“Okay, okay, you got me, no need to say more.” Timewatcher gave up.

Back in the days before his ascension, Timewatcher had made a lot of enemies due to his carefree attitude and penchant for romance. Thus, he antagonized several dragon lords and emperors, eventually becoming surrounded. The old man had to show up and save him.

The happy Timewatcher brought out more teacups for the master-disciple duo.

“Big Bro, what happened? Who managed to injure the great Hallowed?” Timewatcher finally noticed something.

This old man was none other than Hallowed Dao Lord - a renowned cultivator in Eight Desolaces.

He preferred to keep it low-key in the upper continents so only a few knew of his illustrious past.

“No big deal, I went to fight Supreme and lost.” Hallowed responded.

“That’s still pretty impressive, going toe to toe against Supreme.” Timewatcher said with admiration.

“No need to flatter me in the presence of Sir and this dao brother.” Hallowed said while glancing at the old servant.

“I’m just another ant here.” The old servant smiled.

“I suppose we’re all ants in his presence.” Timewatcher praised Li Qiye again.

“So what did you do? There’s a reason why you’re being so polite.” Hallowed asked his close friend.

Timewatcher turned red and said: “What are you talking about? Haven’t I been pretty good recently?”

“Well, I suppose you haven’t poked any beehive recently or bothered the ladies.” Hallowed said.

“Is that really your impression of me?” Hallowed complained.

“Yes.” Hallowed’s expression suddenly became serious: “Is it because of Heaven’s Allure? I heard some rumors.”

“That’s all in the past, Big Bro, don’t worry, I know better than to cause any trouble.” Timewatcher laughed.

The two seemed to be close like brothers despite the considerable age gap.
