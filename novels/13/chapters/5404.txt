Chapter 5405: Seven-star Grouper

Jadecure Conqueror’s appearance in Dream Abyss surprised everyone. They wondered why she was fighting Seven-star Conqueror as well.

The latter had six fruits - nothing out of the ordinary. However, he had Immortal Pagoda Conqueror behind him.

Rumor has it that he was a seven-star grouper who managed to reach the dao, eventually becoming a conqueror.

As a fish, he was fortunate to be in a pond inside Immortal Pagoda Conqueror’s grotto. Since he listened to the dao lectures, he eventually became intelligent and learned how to utilize the dao.

Immortal Pagoda Conqueror took note of the special fish and appreciated its willingness to learn. Thus, he became an unofficial disciple of the conqueror and excelled afterward.

The sky was the limit given his success with the dao. He had the ability to start his own sect but he chose to stay with Immortal Pagoda Conqueror, serving him as a filial disciple.

At this moment, he clearly held back against the opponents who were significantly weaker.

“Fellow Daoist, if you hand over the immortal order, there will be a generous payment.” Seven-star Conqueror insisted.

“An order from Dream Paradise, right?” A big shot asked.

“Yes, one of the few in the world and Jadecure Conqueror has one right now.” A top dragon lord said.

The crowd knew about the existence of five immortal orders. Two have been used by Illumination Conqueror and Supreme. Now, Jadecure Conqueror had one of the remaining three, having won it during Boss Tang’s auctions.

Given the order’s power in the illusory realms, they understood why Seven-star Conqueror was forcing the issue.

“And if I refuse?” Jadecure Conqueror asked while being surrounded by loyal allies - Hallowedsteel Ancestor, Resplendent Monarch, and many other ancestors.

“Then I’m afraid I’ll have to be rude.” Seven-star frowned after hearing this.

“Seven-star Conqueror, do not push us lest you want mutual destruction.” Hallowedsteel raised his voice. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Seven-star understood that this wasn’t an empty threat because they were in possession of an immortal order. In fact, even his master would tread carefully in this situation.

This was the reason why he exercised restraint or even the rabbit would bite once pushed to the limit.

“I am not taking your dream order for nothing, there will be a handsome payment.” Seven-star persuaded.

“No need, the order is not for sale.” Jadecure refused again.

“I must have it.” Seven-star insisted.

“The immortal order has an owner already, there is no point in this.” A conqueror among the crowd spoke.

“My master wishes to have it. Fellow Daoist Jadecure, please be flexible here.” Seven-star said.

Everyone thought that this was a bit ridiculous. Alchemy Dao obtained a spot with the help of Immortal Pagoda Conqueror. They gained success because of him and now, their failure might also be because of him.

“Is this karma?” Ferocity observed in the distance. He thought about taking the spot from Alchemy Dao, only to be injured by Immortal Pagoda Conqueror.

“Immortal Pagoda Conqueror is showing his true colors after the deadline is over.” An expert from Alchemy Dao whispered to Jadecure Conqueror.

“If Immortal Pagoda Conqueror wants it, let him come himself.” Jadecure Conqueror said.

“My master is occupied currently, so here I am.” Seven-star said.

Everyone understood that his master didn’t want to take the risk of Jadecure suddenly using the immortal order in Dream Abyss.

Li Qiye shook his head and appeared near the group while muttering: “Tired of living.”

“Emperor!” Jadecure and the others were ecstatic to see him. They came over and prostrated to show respect.

“Who is he?” A crowd member was surprised to see this.

“Li Qiye, that’s who.” Someone else responded.

Li Qiye was no stranger to the upper continents at this point. The emperor of Imperial Attendant, the slayer of Suppression Conqueror and many others, and someone who had slapped Illumination Conqueror.

Fear was everyone’s first reaction. Seven-star himself understood that a monstrous existence had arrived.

“Scram and I will forgive your transgression.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively.

This was a six-fruit conqueror being treated like a fly. Nonetheless, others understood that Li Qiye had killed far stronger opponents. Seven-star paled in comparison.
