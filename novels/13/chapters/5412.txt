Chapter 5413: The Three Stones

“To the end, huh?” Li Qiye sighed and said: “So much trouble.”

“The brat is hellbent on carrying this out. If Three Immortals can’t handle this, it’ll be conquered and the current world will be next.” The voice said.

“As expected, it’s a pity he won’t have the opportunity.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I have to say that you’ve taught them well.” The voice responded: “An assault of three timelines is still being kept at bay, giving us enough time.”

“Don’t you feel embarrassed saying this? You all ran and left a bunch of juniors to fight for their lives, isn’t this too much?”

“Not at all.” The voice said: “It is their responsibility to defend their world, you taught them that.”

“I never taught them to protect their world, only to maintain their dao heart.” Li Qiyye shook his head.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“It’s the same idea. Plus, we’re too old now to do anything, don’t blame us for taking a vacation.” The voice seemed to be amused.

“You were afraid of repeating history. If all of you were eaten, it would be a rather big mess.” Li Qiye smirked.

The voice paused for a moment before responding: “Yes, that’s why we ran here, it’s not good to feed the enemy, right?”

“It can go the other way as well, a cornered rabbit might start biting but as for who it bites, who knows? If you all stopped caring, it would have added to the chaos.” Li Qiye said.

“True, the reality is that the world no longer has much to do with us. We are merely exercising self-restraint.” The voice admitted.

“And I admire you all for that.” Li Qiye sighed and said: “Thus, in the future world and its river of time, you all shall have a spot.”

“We haven’t thought about it that far, we merely do not wish to do so. After all, we have been enduring for years now, why change our way?” The voice said.

“So I guess I can take back my promise then.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Don’t, your words are worth their weight in gold, no?” The voice immediately responded.

“Ah, okay then.” Li Qiye said: “Don’t worry, I will not be stingy after you all have made your choice. Your investment shall absolutely pay off.”

“Now that’s good to hear.” The voice let out a joyful laugh and exclaimed: “Maybe I should come out for a drink.”

“No need.” Li Qiye waved his hand: “Keep on being buried given your current state.”

“Fine, fine.” The unknown speaker was clearly in a better mood after their conversation.

“It seems like you all don’t understand me. I know what should be done and what to avoid. Otherwise, I can just destroy everything and make it simple for myself.” Li Qiye complained.

“No one can be trusted during trials and hardships.” The voice said.

“That’s a good point, I would feel the same in your shoes.” Li Qiye nodded.

“But it’s all in the past.” The voice happily said: “We’re just waiting for you to start.”

“Don’t be so anxious. In due time.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Well, it depends on how much confidence you have in your education and how long you think they can hold on. Once they lose, Three Immortals will be done for and war will come here.”

“It won’t be that fast.” Li Qiye said calmly.

“So you’ve done research already.” The voice said.

“Not quite, it’s just a feeling, that’s all. But you did say that I have dominion over three thousand worlds, so trust my intuition.” Li Qiye said.

“I suppose we don’t need to worry about it. Just know that when you depart, we won’t be coming with you.” The voice said.

“Hmm, your injuries are rather serious. Just rest and leave the rest to me, you have done what is needed already.” Li Qiye said.

“We simply made a choice, that’s all.” The voice let out a sigh.

“And that’s the most important thing in our cultivation realm, making the proper choice.” Li Qiye said.

“What would you do if you had the three stones?” The voice asked.

Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “I haven’t even thought about the gathering or what to do with them.”

“But he’s doing it. One is a stepping stone, what about the other two?” The voice said with a solemn tone.

“A few things can’t be controlled by anyone, not him or the villainous heaven. There will always be deviation even for a perfect plan. Do you think the stones will comply with their wish?” Li Qiye said.

“How will you respond?” The voice asked.

“Controlling all three stones won’t have the desired effect or it would have been done long ago.” Li Qiye said.

“Seems like you know their condition.” The voice said.

“I haven’t done enough research but I can speculate after talking to the old geezer.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Do you know where they are?” The voice asked.

“As we’ve discussed, one is moving forward with many great fortunes.” Li Qiye said.

“What about the other two?” The voice asked.

“The other one, not in this world.” Li Qiye responded.

“I see, there is only one place.” The voice understood: “You’ve been there before.”

“Of course, I had to for my goal.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So that’s why you know about the second one.” The voice said.

“It wasn’t a part of my plan. This was his move, not mine. Was it a good move? Maybe, but ultimately, this is borrowing someone else’s hand to get things done.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“What about the final stone?” The voice inquired.

Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “This is the most interesting stone, also the one with the most uncertainty. It’ll be full of surprises.”

“Haven’t you thought about getting there before him?” The voice asked.

“Why should I? Fate has its own plan and what I seek is not this predetermined fate.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You will refuse the three stones even when they stand before you?” The voice asked.

“If they insist on being a part of my fate, that’s a different issue.” Li Qiye said.

“Only a matter of time.” The voice said confidently.

“Seems like you understand them more than I do.” Li Qiye said.

“Not quite, I’m sure you know more about them than I do. It’s just that I understand him more than you do.” The voice said.

“Good, then let us make use of your knowledge.” Li Qiye smiled.
