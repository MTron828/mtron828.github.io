Chapter 4373: Threat

Blood seeped into the ground and stained it red. The stench made the crowd shudder.

Those from Phoenix Ground were no strangers to death but this still intimidated them. As for the young ones from Little Diamond, they became nauseous from the sanguine stench.

No one could regain their composure in a short time, not even the senior demons observing from a distance. The outcome was truly unexpected and unimaginable.

Members of Phoenix Ground thought that Li Qiye’s cultivation should be negligible compared to any of them. He was only a slightly bigger worm at best; any of them could stomp him to death.

However, the actual result was completely different. The seniors, in particular, found it more astonishing since they knew how capable Sky Eagle was. In their opinion, only a few youths in the current generation could kill Sky Eagle in this manner.

“Brat, you’re finished!” One of them landed in front of the residence. He wanted to save Sky Eagle earlier but it was too late.

“Boom!” He was livid and activated his bestial aura, releasing a devastating roar. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He revealed his true form - a giant bear demon with a frame as large as a hill. His aura swept through the area, wanting to crush everything.

“Raa!” He roared intimidatingly.

“A demon king!” The young ones from Little Diamond turned pale. Some of them felt their knees buckling since they could see themselves being swallowed by the bear’s enormous jaw.

“Bear King!” The members of Phoenix Ground were startled as well.

He was Sky Eagle’s master. Alas, his ferocious nature frightened his fellow sect members.

“Brat, blood for blood!” He shouted deafeningly as his eyes turned red with rage. It seemed that he had no intention of sparing Li Qiye or his allies.

“Clank!” A golden sword landed and released its energy, pushing the bear back.

A new figure joined the fray, one shrouded by golden radiance.

“Demon Monarch!” Everyone bowed deeply after seeing him.

Who else could it be but the current lord of Phoenix Ground - Goldbird Monarch.

“Demon Monarch, what is the meaning of this?!” Bear King bellowed.

“Bear King, do not be disrespectful to our esteemed guests.” The monarch’s expression darkened.

Bear King was not a member of the Jian, only Phoenix Ground. Nonetheless, he was still under the monarch’s jurisdiction.

“How are they esteemed guests?! He killed my disciple and another dozen member, he deserves death for this heinous crime!” Bear King barked back.

Their fellow sect members watched with bated breath. Though the ones here clearly challenged his authority by provoking Li Qiye, they still didn’t dare to show any disrespect. He had earned his status and reputation as a demon monarch.

“Demon Monarch, what you are doing is protecting a murderer! Don’t forget you are the leader of Phoenix Ground. You need to protect its prestige and members!” Bear King shouted.

Many actually nodded in agreement but didn’t dare to voice their support.

“If you have an issue with my conduct, bring it up before the elders but right now, leave! Young Noble Li and Little Diamond are guests here!” The monarch uttered coldly.

“You!” Bear King activated his aura again. It took the form of a light pillar shooting into the sky.

“Hmph!” The monarch released countless sword rays. A kingdom of swords appeared behind him with a surging dao. His aura also swept forward like a flood.

Bear King couldn’t handle this and staggered several steps backward despite his huge frame.

“If you insist on causing trouble, don’t blame me for being merciless.” A sharp glint flashed within the monarch’s eyes.

The youths from Little Diamond couldn’t believe it. They thought that he was an easygoing and amicable person, not expecting him to be so awe-inspiring.

His divinity overwhelmed the bear demon once he became serious.

“Fine, fine! We’ll see how long you can protect them for.” Bear King didn’t want a direct confrontation because that would be idiotic given the gap in cultivation. He angrily stomped on the ground once and then left.
