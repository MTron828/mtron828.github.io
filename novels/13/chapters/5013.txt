Chapter 5014: Thousand-faced Sovereign

Golden Cicada King had talked about the commanding god previously. Alas, Bloodfly God was still nowhere to be seen.

“Where is Bloodfly God right now?” Radiant Monarch asked.

“The commanding god is here but it is not up to me when he will show up. Please do not worry, you all will get to meet him.” Golden Cicada smiled and said.

“Why is this so troublesome? I am here specifically to see him.” Wild Dragon didn’t buy it and raised his voice: “Bloodfly God, I wish for an audience!”

Everyone waited for a response, not daring to say a single word.

Normally, demons such as Wild Dragon, Golden Cicada, and Chillgaze Hawk were the top dogs in Demon. Alas, they were still beneath the commanding gods. Only the fearless Wild Dragon dared to make demands right now.

The dragon lords understood that Bloodfly God was here in the city but for some reason, he didn’t wish to see them.

They thought about the rumor of this god being bloodthirsty. He had drained many demons and dragon lords for insulting him before. Thus, he had the worst reputation out of the six.

Just thinking about him spying on them left them nervous.

“Can you try and invite him again?” Pagoda Guardian said seriously.

“It’s not that I don’t want you all to see him, this just isn’t my decision to make.” Golden Cicada smiled wryly.

“We traveled from the other side of the world to join you here, this is not the hospitality I expected out of you.” Radiant Monarch said.

“I’m sure our commanding god is aware of your sincerity.” Golden Cicada responded.

Both sides reached a deadlock. Golden cicada couldn’t force his commanding god to come out while the other dragon lords didn’t appreciate the lack of respect. However, even if they were dissatisfied, what could they do about it?

“How can one not attend this grand party?” A drawn-out voice echoed across the palace.

Although it didn’t come with an oppressive aura, the words seemed to be spanning for millions of years and resonated in their heart. It was impossible to block it out regardless of their attempt.

The dragon lords could tell that the speaker was actually stronger than them. They looked up and saw a temporal stream crossing the horizon, seemingly traveling from the past to the present.

A cultivator sat cross-legged on the stream, looking like the ruler of heaven and earth. He could observe three thousand worlds with his one thousand faces.

This was not just a description - he truly had one thousand faces. Each was facing a different direction, observing a different world.

“Thousand-faced Sovereign!” The dragon lords recognized him.

Guardian Pagoda and Skystomper God bowed despite their prestigious status.

Meanwhile, the crowd took a deep breath after hearing his title.

“What is going on here, why is the sovereign visiting Demon too?” Someone murmured.

“Sovereign.” Skystomper and Guardian Pagoda greeted him.

He was the master to someone known by all - the most talented conqueror in recent generations, Phenomena Conqueror. He served as one of the oldest ancient ancestors in Lunar Lineage.

In the lower continents, Stone Ox was known as the strongest dragon lord. Rumor has it that he could fight against any conqueror without losing. Thousand-faced Sovereign was only second to Stone Ox.

Therefore, no one here could match him unless they were to obtain seven sacred fruits.

Golden Cicada didn’t expect this because he didn’t invite the sovereign.

It has been a long time since he last showed himself in public. Some thought that he had passed away due to old age already.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Commanding God, why won’t you join us if you’re here already?” His voice echoed, each word resonated across the realm and left no place for anyone to hide regardless of their peerless stealth technique.

“Buzz.” Darkness suddenly swept over like a tsunami as a figure appeared above the palace - thin and ethereal, almost like a statue that had been carved by a blade.

A strong stench of blood rushed over and creeped everyone out. The figure was dressed in a dark blood-colored robe and had a piercing gaze. They were mesmerized by his presence and felt as if something was draining their blood.

The dragon lords became uneasy despite wanting him to appear in the first place.
