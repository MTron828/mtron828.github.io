Chapter 5865: Together, Until Death

“Come back here!” Li Qiye appeared before the river and caused a massive tsunami, preventing them from crossing.

“Rumble!” The waves struck them and made them vomit blood, leaving grievous injuries.

He reached into the void and pulled something back - a white cloud. It reluctantly entered the river and made the water fly upward, creating an unsurpassable sky moat. Not a single soul could get through to leave Elder Galaxy.

The overlords observed the new blockage in astonishment. Li Qiye had somehow used the river to seal Elder Galaxy entirely.

They were afraid and furious after losing the perfect hiding spots in Elder Galaxy. Now, it has become their prison.

“I waited all this time just to let you run away? Don’t be so optimistic.” Li Qiye smiled at Primal’s group.

They have lived for a long time, witnessing death and destruction. Now, they served as the true rulers of the world only to have death come knocking after falling into Li Qiye’s pit.

“It is time to fight, no more ulterior motives.” Epoch’s End said with a serious tone.

“Whoever runs or fights inactively will be the first devoured.” Voracious couldn’t help but agree.

The duo was injured after being tricked by the five, clearly unhappy with their allies. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“We have to.” Primal exchanged glances with his allies and gritted his teeth.

“Together, until death.” Imperial Progenitor and the others solemnly told the duo, only a little short of a promise.

Despite their reluctance, the only option left was to fight Li Qiye without holding back.

Epoch’s End and Voracious snorted but put the past aside. Now was not the time to be petty and vengeful.

“I will use the curse for another tribulation, make yourselves useful.” Derivation roared.

“Crack!” His body split apart like a blossoming flower once more, revealing the source of the curse. Runes appeared along with lightning bolts.

He had reached the breaking point and wanted to fully release the curse.

All seven understood that ordinary means couldn’t stop or kill Li Qiye. Only the power of the high heaven had this potential; it had never failed before.

Moreover, given Li Qiye’s mighty cultivation, a tribulation meant for him would descend as well.

“Boom!” Li Qiye teleported with incredible speed, punching through the tribulation bolts and runes along with Derivation’s flesh.

“Stop!” The others knew that he was attempting to stop a full activation of the curse.

“Rumble!” All six attacked in unison, obliterating the dimensions within Elder Galaxy.

Living beings on the six continents and Eight Desolaces trembled in horror, aware that something was wrong.

Epoch’s End channeled the most terrifying death power using his hexaplate against Li Qiye.

Voracious turned Epoch Heaven into the brightest beam in existence, shooting it straight at Li Qiye’s chest.

Primal while swinging his bloodaxe repeatedly, performing the three variations in succession and summoning a rain of blood. Once he finished, all three moves combined together to form a blood slash.

Dao Ancestor harnessed the power of the nine heavenly treasures. They took on physical forms and descended, capable of reducing an epoch to ashes.

... ...

All six overlords did everything they could to let Derivation release the curse fully. This would summon numerous tribulations to stack upon Li Qiye’s own tribulation - that should be enough to suppress Li Qiye for them to deliver a finishing blow.

“Primordial Reversion!” Li Qiye raised his hand and roared. Numerous epochs and overlords have appeared in history but none was able to surpass the primordial beginning.

This affinity turned into a towering wall, preventing anything from passing through.

“Boom! Boom!” The group’s relentless onslaught with their best weapon failed to break the defense.

In this split second, Li Qiye’s fist pierced through Derivation, prompting the monster to scream.

“Ahh!” He exploded into countless pieces but was still alive. They squirmed and tried to gather again.
