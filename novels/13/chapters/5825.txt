Chapter 5825: Death Sentence

The four had a solemn expression as they each took out a gem. Upon closer inspection, these were four special bones that have maintained their divinity throughout the years.

Countless runes were carved deep on the surface, polished by the grand dao and laws. This process must have taken eras.

Onlookers felt as if they were holding a dao source but instead of being a natural entity, it was a part of them.

“Oh? And here I thought the rest of Divine Ancestor’s bones were devoured.” Li Qiye said: “Did you all secretly take them or were given them by Primal’s group?”

Listeners became emotional despite not knowing much about Divine Ancestor outside of him being Trinity Ancestor’s son whom the overlords devoured.

“Just a memento.” The founder answered briefly.

“I see, so you were being sneaky and the three immortals agreed with this scheme, using your immortal blood to refine the bones. If Primal were to find out, that’s a death sentence.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“We are only refining weapons, you’re overthinking it, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said.

“Fine. Let’s see what you have learned from them then.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Meanwhile, others wondered what had happened in the past. These four managed to hide bones with intact divinity from the overlords?

Moreover, they infused their immortal blood into the bones. If the overlords were to find out, this could be considered an attempt to revive Divine Ancestor - surely a death sentence.

Of course, the group had no intention of doing so, only wishing to change the bones into a weapon without the overlords’ knowledge.

“Activate!” The four roared and sent their blood into the bones, releasing an unstoppable divinity.

Human Monarch multiplied endlessly and reached the sky, taking over the world while deriving mysteries and living beings. Heaven Authority forced everything else into submission by acting as the sharpest blade. Devil Bestowment sealed the myriad realms and nullified other affinities. Divine Eternal had a withering nature via temporal prolongment.

Under these transformations, the four bones turned into four unique dao sources. Emperors lost control of their dao powers and laws.

The dao sources started dragging everything closer, forcing them to stabilize their dao heart and dao.

The four raised and placed these dao sources together.

“Boom!” They rotated and combined into one. The terrible explosion sent some emperors flying.

Blood changed into a boundless primal expanse, capable of melting the world down.

“Looks like the start of the world.” An emperor became startled.

“Not bad at all, to derive an inborn dao chaos entity out of the bones.” Li Qiye understood what they were trying to do.

“Activate!” Their mind became resplendent, releasing laws into the air to harmonize with Celestial Palace. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The blinding explosions caused spectators to close their eyes. As they channeled their power into the palace, they summoned more of Elder Galaxy’s potential. Power oozed out from the dimensional treasure and affected the six continents.

They could only focus on controlling the palace, not the entire treasure. The latter retaliated but the four blocked with their dao source.

The two forces collided and melted like water, becoming one as well.
