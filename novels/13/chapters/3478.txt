The Yin Yang ancestor only wanted to find a reason to stop Ancestral City from taking Li Qiye.

That development would be as bad as it could get for them. Ancestral would become superior afterward. No other sect in the north could take Ancestral, not even them.

“He must stay behind to pay for his crimes.” The national teacher from Skylight shouted.

“Ancestral can’t just take a murderer away.” Everyone used this reason to stand alongside Yin Yang. They thought that they had the perfect excuse - trialing a murderer instead of focusing on the treasury.

“Ancestral shouldn’t cover up for him. That’s going against justice and the rest of the world.” Another ancestor used this opportunity to accuse Ancestral.

“Yes, protecting him is akin to opposing everyone else, that’s not acceptable in the north.” The crowd became agitated and assumed the role of justice.

Loud complaints echoed across the field in order to stop Ancestral from bringing Li Qiye away. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“So what? Today, those who oppose the young master will become our enemies.” Shi Qingjian looked straight at the crowd and declared.

She spoke with confidence and determination. Everyone felt as if her words were knives pricking their heart. They took a deep breath to calm down.

She raised her hand and the army of Ancestral immediately prepared battle formations. Their battle intent could sweep through Eight Desolaces, rendering others breathless.

“No mercy for those who stand in our way.” She became domineering, ready to kill.

The scene became quiet right away. The shouters earlier closed their mouth and exchanged glances.

Though they were vocal with their complaints earlier, no one wanted to make a move after seeing the army of Ancestral. It would be foolish to be the vanguards and cannon fodders right now. Who would be dumb enough to rush forward first and die?

They needed to wait for the three behemoths on their side to make a move first.

“Miss Shi, are you adamant in opposing us?” The Yin Yang ancestor’s expression darkened.

“Don’t make me repeat myself.” Shi Qingjian replied.

It became abundantly clear that Ancestral City was firmly on Li Qiye’s side. It didn’t matter who they would antagonize in the process.

“This is the will of Ancestral City or yours?” Firmaments Sect Master asked.

“Qingjian is in charge of Ancestral now. Her decision is the sect’s decision.” Ancestor Lu revealed.

The crowd became astounded, especially the members of Yin Yang Gate. This was way too early for her to be in charge.

Sure, she was a brilliant genius not inferior to Skylight Princess. However, Ancestral City had plenty of powerful ancestors.

In terms of seniority and cultivation, it simply wasn’t her turn. Moreover, the city didn’t have any intention of doing so any time soon. Why did this happen overnight?

This made it tougher for Yin Yang Gate as well. If other ancestors were in charge, perhaps the two sects could still reconcile. With her in charge, not even an opportunity would arise.

By this point, everyone understood that the marriage annulment was her decision because she was in charge now.

“Miss Shi, why do you want to be our enemies? Ancestral has a great army but so do we, and they’re here now.” The ancestor from Yin Yang said.

“If Ancestral won’t back down, Skylight will stand with Yin Yang. Our army will come as well.” Skylight National Teacher added.

Firmaments Sect Master hesitated for a bit before speaking: “Everyone needs to work together for the sake of justice. Firmaments does not wish to fight but in order to destroy the villain named Li Qiye and avenge our fallen disciples, we will mobilize our army.”

These two powers have chosen Yin Yang’s side. However, Firmaments Sect Master spoke with some leeway and more finesse.

After all, Firmaments came from Ancestral City and it mainly consisted of golems. Thus, it was ridiculous for it to attack Ancestral City. The rest of their race would spurn them for doing so.

Therefore, he focused on Li Qiye and the vengeance aspect. It became more understandable and reasonable. They didn’t wish to fight and disrespect Ancestral but had no other choice.

No one could criticize a sect for wanting to avenge their disciples.

Of course, this sect master had an even more sinister plan outside of the treasures and legacies. In the case of an actual war, the fall of Ancestral City meant that the golems would lose their leader.

At that point, they could take that spot instead and replace Ancestral City. They would have supremacy over the golems for generations to come. This was worth any risk and effort.

“I agree to help Yin Yang Gate for the sake of justice.” Another ancestor took the opportunity to join: “My sect’s army will come whenever.”

“Everyone is responsible for slaying evil. Count our clan in.” The first elder of a clan said.

“That’s right, we won’t just sit idly by.” The rest of the crowd seemed eager to help.

They were ready to surround and attack Ancestral City at this point. This was a considerable threat because this alliance was mighty. Ancestral City might actually fall against the rest of the north.

“Ancestral, rethink this, are you ready to fight against the coalition of justice?” The Yin Yang ancestor threatened.

Everyone stared at Qingjian because her next move could decide the fate of Ancestral City.

“Miss Shi, hand over Li Qiye, and no trouble will come to your sect.” Firmaments Sect Master persuaded.

“My answer is, come, bring as many men as you like.” She didn’t relent in the slightest.
