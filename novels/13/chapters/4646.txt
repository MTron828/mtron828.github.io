Chapter 4647: Worldraiser Tablet

“Activate!” True Immortal Spirit roared and released his dao halos. They pulsed behind him and spread out like a pair of fiery wings.

Dao flames poured down and blotted out the world. Spectators could only see an inferno in front of them. The intensified dao power entered their body and fully suppressed them.

“He’s going all out.” Someone commented.

True Immortal Spirit stopped holding back, whether it be dao power, chaos energy, or his own vitality. He fully displayed his potential at this second.

“Boom!” His mighty power ravaged the area and didn’t give others time to react before freezing them.

“The weapon!” Everyone understood what was going on after feeling the immense suppression. This was akin to being stomped by a giant.

“Bam!” Some dropped to the ground and couldn’t move an inch, becoming helpless. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

They looked up and saw a stone tablet floating above True Immortal Spirit. It had countless runes carved on the surface. Its presence was no different than a dao lord being here in person.

“Worldraiser Tablet!” A big shot recognized the weapon.

Many famous experts have heard about it before. One of them became emotional and said: “This was carved from a dao stone using the power and merit laws of a dao lord. It has a suppressive effect once summoned.”

It contained the grand dao and merit law of Worldraiser Dao Lord. Its aura swept across a million miles. Therefore, cultivators in the region all paid attention to Golden Gate. They knew that a top fight was happening.

“All-suppressing Tablet!” True Immortal Spirit finally made his move.

The tablet released an ultimate power along with dao flames. It became larger than the sky and thicker than the earth.

“Boom!” As the tablet descended, cracks appeared all over the ground while space crumbled.

“Fuck!” Many spectators became aghast and shouted profanity. They felt that their body could be reduced to bloody mists in the blink of an eye.

At the same time, Golden Gate exuded boundless radiance. It added a golden layer to the world, making it look rather magnificent.

The foundation of this sect clearly felt threatened and automatically activated a mighty defense.

“Who is fighting right now?” Those far away from Golden Gate became startled.

“Activate.” Li Qiye smiled and punched again, once again borrowing the supreme grand dao of Golden Gate.

The power of the foundation entered Li Qiye’s body and followed his punch. The resulting radiance blinded all spectators.

Li Qiye turned into a supreme god - one with a boundless amount of fist dao energy within.

Spectators felt that he could punch through the sky vault and kill the gods above.

“Bam!” The fist and the tablet collided, resulting in devastating shockwaves. The crowd was blown flying while screaming.

They turned pale and couldn’t stay calm. The tablet and Li Qiye seemed to be evenly matched, resulting in more and more shockwaves flying out.

“He’s using his bare hand against a dao lord weapon!” A genius couldn’t believe it.

Mad Fist rubbed his own eyes. He thought that even if he could borrow the power of the foundation, he still wouldn’t dare to meet a dao lord weapon directly. His fist would be crushed right away. A mighty gauntlet was absolutely required but Li Qiye didn’t have one.

This felt like a scene in the legends but it was happening right in front of them.
