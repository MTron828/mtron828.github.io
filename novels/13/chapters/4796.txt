Chapter 4797: Secret Plan

Cosmic Lord’s banishment would certainly shock the world. Listeners could see that Six-dao Monarch didn’t wish to banish him, hence the final sentence.

All eyes were on Cosmic Lord with eager anticipation, wondering about his choice. They didn’t understand his stubbornness. After all, he had never done anything wrong previously and never disrespected his ancestors.

The only reason for the banishment was due to his own choice. Even a fool wouldn’t make this decision.

“I have let you down, Ancestors.” Cosmic Lord bowed towards the group and said: “I truly appreciate your guidance and teachings all these years, I engrave this to my heart. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to serve you in the future, how truly unfilial. I bid goodbye today and hope all of you will live forever.” 

Having said that, he earnestly performed a full rite of three bows and nine kowtows. 

The crowd watched in silence. In a sense, this wasn’t a banishment since he clearly chose to leave the sect he worked so hard to prosper.

This heartfelt goodbye successfully stirred spectators - a supreme ancient ancestor leaving his sect.

Moreover, the other side also showed compassion. Normally, a banishment included the destruction of the dao foundation. This was to prevent merit laws and other secrets from circulating to outsiders.

After all, someone such as Cosmic Lord clearly had access to the best merit laws and secrets in True Immortal. They risked him giving away all of this and decided to trust his integrity.

“Why does he want to leave?” One expert regained his wits and asked.

An actual reason grounded in logic eluded them. He already had it all in True Immortal - authority and respect on top of numerous resources. No other sect could provide the same thing.

Therefore, the relationship was mutually beneficial. If he were to leave, he would lose its protection, putting his strength aside.

“Aspiration and ambition drive him.” An ancient ancestor said.

Those from the same generation as Cosmic Lord knew that there was more to this decision.

“Fine.” Six-dao Monarch stomped the ground exasperatedly and said: “Leave it to fate then.”

“Take care.” Lin Mo glanced at him before leaving with Specter and Six-dao.

“Goodbye, Ancestors.” The banished Cosmic Lord kept his head lowered in their direction until they were gone.

“Dao Brother, you are free now. Three Thousand Dao’s door is always open for you.” Dao Sanqian bowed slightly.

Many understood that Cosmic Lord was far from being a vagabond. Many sects and clans were more than willing to take him in. On the contrary, most weren’t large enough to accommodate someone of his level.

Three Thousand Dao was one exception. It seemed to be a suitable destination. For example, Enveloping Monarch left Bones to join Three Thousand Dao.

“Thank you, Dao Brother.” Cosmic Lord bowed back and said: “It feels alright to be free though, the whole world is open to me.”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Very well.” Dao Sanqian didn’t force the issue.

“If you are interested, you may visit our Immortal Lake. We are the oldest existence in the world and have advantages unavailable to anyone else. It’ll be very beneficial for you to join us.” Gu Yin’s profound voice came from the coffin.

Listeners took a deep breath. Joining Three Thousand Dao was not an upgrade but Immortal Lake was a different story. It came from an older epoch and could actually be stronger than True Immortal. Perhaps he would be able to reach a higher realm after joining.

Keep in mind that these mysterious powers rarely recruited outsiders. Cosmic Lord was an exception.

“Thank you, but I have important business here. We may discuss this later.” Cosmic Lord said.

“Good, we’ll take care of business first.” Gu Yin said.

Others exchanged glances. A few ancient ancestors realized that something else was going on.

Gu Yin and Cosmic Lord clearly had a plan together, even Dao Sanqian was involved.

“Are you ready, Dao Brother?” Cosmic Lord asked Dao Sanqian.

“Everything is ready, we may try.” Dao Sanqian nodded solemnly.

Enveloping Monarch slightly frowned because he didn’t know about this secret plan despite being so close to Dao Sanqian.

They had experienced life-or-death battles before and Dao Sanqian always shared secret plans or other matters with him. Therefore, he had a bad feeling about this.

“And you?” Cosmic Lord asked Gu Yin.

“As long as it is possible, the agreement remains.” Gu Yin promised.

Everyone could tell that something grand and ominous was unraveling before them.
