Chapter 5046: Peacock Monarch’s Death

Nightwalker stopped convincing Goldcrest since it was up to the youth to decide.

As he was about to say farewell to Li Qiye, he suddenly gazed at the horizon.

“Peacock Monarch is about to die right now. Young Noble, I’m afraid I can’t see you off.” Having said that, he started flying away.

“Peacock Monarch is about to die?” Ming Shi murmured.

“It’s about time, the god source had been shattered for so long.” Goldcrest sighed.

“Buzz.” Light began illuminating the Ten Great Mountains. Next came a tsunami of power.

All living beings sensed it clearly and took comfort in it. There was no sense of suppression. They relaxed as if they were in a hot spring.

It contained five colors and spread like a peacock spreading its tail. The light was also as gentle as feathers.

“This feels amazing.” Ming Shi said with admiration.

“When a commanding god passes away, their power, vitality, and dao will return to the land.” Goldcrest explained.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Look at how many of them are showing respect.” Yunyun gazed into the distance and saw the animals and beasts laying on the ground while facing the direction of the light.

“They know a great monarch’s life is about to end.” Goldcrest said.

“Can we go take a look, please?” Ming Shi asked Li Qiye.

He has been looking in that direction and answered: “Very well, trouble is coming too.”

With that, he started walking and the three gave chase right away, not having enough time to worry.

This was a monumental event in Demon. The death of a commanding god meant the emergence of another.

Demons also lamented this end. The powerful ones came to visit Peacock Monarch during his last moment, wanting to see him one last time.

He has done a commendable job during his reign, minimizing conflicts and living in relative harmony with the other branches. Thus, he had the heart of the people.

He chose to spend his last moment at the deity symbol itself - a tree taller than any other. It exuded a five-colored light just like him.

As he sat there, he seemed to be full of life and energy. How could he be on the verge of death? He had no fear in his eyes either and calmly faced the inevitable.

Next to him was Chillgaze Hawk, one of the strongest monarchs in Demon. The two of them were completely different in terms of aura - one gentle and the other ferocious.

A little girl was kneeling next to the monarch. She tried her best not to weep while wiping the tears away.

A large gathering of demons surrounded the tree and paid their respect. Humans and outsiders have also arrived, wanting to see the death of a commanding god.

Li Qiye’s group came as well. They stood on top of a peak nearby to watch the moment.

“Isn’t that Lil’ Freckle?” Ming Shi was surprised to see the little girl next to Peacock Monarch.

Goldcrest and Yunyun felt the same way.

“Could she be his disciple or daughter?” Yunyun speculated.

“Rooster, and here I thought you know everything in Demon. How disappointing.” Ming Shi said.

“I never said that.” Goldcrest chuckled, recalling the days of the academy. He didn’t sense any hint of Demon from her previously. Plus, how was she able to leave Demon?

“The time is near.” Peacock Monarch smiled and his aura became even more radiant.

“Rumble!” The divine tablet appeared behind him.

This was his own, created from a seal imprinted on the marking spot of Feather in the real tablet.

Five more tablets appeared around the tree, each with a throne right in front of them. Only three thrones were occupied.
