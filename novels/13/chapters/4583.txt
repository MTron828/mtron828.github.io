Chapter 4584: That Place

Jian Ming and the daoist exchanged glances. Jian Ming spoke first: “Worldbreaker Fist is one of the seven forbidden zones, as perilous as can be.”

“Go on.” She said.

The two smiled wryly. Anyone else would have shuddered in fear after hearing this description but Xiao Xuan didn’t react at all.

“How should I put this…” Jian Ming thought about it carefully: “Putting aside other dangers, there is a belief that entering this area means becoming a slave to the fist forever regardless of one’s power and cultivation.”

“How strange.” She looked curious rather than afraid. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Jian Ming went on: “The rumor might be exaggerated. It’s not like one instantly becomes a slave after entering. It requires some staying there for some time.”

“How long?” She asked right away.

“There is no exact length.” He scratched his head and said: “It depends on the individual, ranging from one or two days or far longer.”

He paused for a moment to add emphasis: “However, it is certain that after becoming a fist slave, it is impossible to leave. Therefore, one must prevent becoming one at all cost.”

“What is the driver behind the phenomenon?” She inquired again, looking eager to enter that area.

“I don’t think anyone can answer this.” Jian Ming smiled.

The daoist continued the conversation: “The standard explanation is due to the fist intent. Each inch of that area is filled with it. It invades the soul and true fate, turning cultivators into slaves. It is frightening because one can be converted at any moment during their visit.”

“Right.” Jian Ming agreed and said: “It’s safe before the conversion. In fact, it can be cultivationally beneficial. It’s just that there are no signs at all. People may think that they are completely fine and then in the next second, they unwittingly turn into slaves to the fist.”

These descriptions only served to strengthen her curiosity. She said: “Where is this fist intent coming from? A living cultivator, a natural entity, or an item? There must be a source.”

“Well…” The two exchanged glances, unable to answer the question. In fact, this has been a mystery across the eras.

“Seems like this is the place then. It is hidden there.” She murmured.

“Lady, why did you seal your item there?” Jian Ming asked since she picked this dangerous location out of all places.

“You’re asking the wrong person, I obviously don’t know the answer.” She glared, prompting him to put on an awkward smile.

“I will go there to find it.” She then decided.

“Lady, do you remember a more exact location? Is there any marking?” Jian Ming asked.

“No.” She answered right away: “Just that there is a large fist, nothing else. I’m not even sure if there is an item in the first place.”

In her muddled memory, she recalled that there was something important. Only the image of a great fist was clear, nothing else.

“Worldbreak Fist is massive, some even consider it boundless. A lifetime is not enough to see all of it.” The daoist said.

“Sounds like the two of you are familiar with this palace. Good, you two will serve as my guides.” She commanded.

“That’s no good, that’s no good.” Jian Ming refused right away.

He didn’t want to mess around with that devilish place and become a fist slave for eternity. The girl had no idea where she sealed her item; this was akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack.

“Ah, I just remember that I have urgent business to take care of back at home, I don’t have time right now.” The daoist coughed and said.

“Right, right.” Jian Ming nodded repeatedly: “My father has been ill recently, his lower back hurts from exhaustion. I have to go take care of him and can’t be of service, My Lady.”

“Nonsense, if I tell you to come along, you will.” She left no room for negotiation. Her commanding aura was suffocating as she glared at them.

The two couldn’t run away even if they wanted to since she could easily end their lives. They had no choice but to stare at Li Qiye, acting pitiful.

“Fine, I have some time. We’ll go to Worldbreaker Fist.” Li Qiye said.

“You wish to go too, Young Noble?” She was glad to hear this because she felt safe being near him.

Though she wasn’t afraid of Worldbreaker Fist, traveling alone left her somewhat in low spirit. Now, this feeling was gone.

“Yes, affairs and fortune, a visit is warranted.” He stroked his chin.

“Haha, yes! We’ll go with you too, Lady and Young Noble.” Jian Ming and the daoist heaved a sigh of relief.

“Isn’t your father ill? What about your important business?” She glared again.

“Oh, it’s okay, I will have older brothers that can take care of business. They don’t need me.” The daoist shamelessly said.

“Yes, my father has been ill all this time anyway, it’s not that serious so I can tag along.” Jian Ming said: “After all, you will need someone to run errands.”

He patted his chest and declared: “I humbly offer my services!”
