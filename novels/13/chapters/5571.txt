Chapter 5572: Frightening Gusts

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye glanced at the defeated conqueror before commanding.

“Okay.” Niu Fen changed form and the group disappeared from the battlefield.

Spectators didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Which emotion should they be experiencing right now?

A mighty cultivator with access to anima willingly turned into a mount? The strongest emperors and dao lords didn’t have this privilege.

“This is absurd, does anyone know who he is?” A dao lord asked his friends.

The center of attention was not the powerful Niu Fen but rather, Li Qiye.

“Must be a legendary figure with a long history.” One conqueror responded.

The group traveled forward before Li Qiye tapped on Niu Fen’s shell, signaling him to halt before a sky-piercing mountain. It could be seen from any direction within ten thousand miles.

Not a single blade of grass or sign of life could be found on this gigantic peak. It should have been brimming with life given its size, occupied by trees and birds.

“Here.” Li Qiye said.

Niu Fen got down to the ground close enough to lick it. He sensed the flow of this area and said: “Yes, a foreign aura, faint but discernible.”

As for Qin Baifeng, she felt nothing outside of how barren it was.

“So this is where the weapon is hiding?” She asked, unable to sense any immortal energy.

“It would have been found long ago if it were so easy to detect.” Li Qiye said.

Any hint of its energy and sharpness would have brought about a horde of cultivators. A war would have ensued over it.

Moreover, the deities had refined the entire region numerous times but still didn’t notice it. It would have been able to hide here if it wasn’t for the gray auras and Li Qiye.

“Why is it trying so hard to hide?” Niu Fen could barely sense it and only after a long time.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

No one else would have spent so much time in this god-forsaken place to spot it. Niu Fen, powerful as he might be, only found out due to Li Qiye’s guidance.

“It’s afraid, it wants to run but doesn’t know a place.” Li Qiye said.

“Why is it running?” Baifeng thought that this weapon was already at the apex.

“Because there is something even more frightening. Moreover, its master is dead and not next to it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“No matter how powerful a weapon is, it was still created by someone. Its pseudo-immortal owner was killed in battle, it had no choice but to run.” Niu Fen smiled.

“Open it.” Li Qiye ordered.

“Leave the manual labor to me.” Niu Fen pulled up his sleeves and walked around the peak while knocking randomly.

“Yep, this huge thing was created. Alright, little miss, step back.” Niu Fen grinned and warned Baifeng.

The moment she got far enough, she heard a loud bang.

“Boom!” The peak instantly shattered after a single strike from Niu Fen, revealing a bottomless abyss within. It looked like a tunnel to a world of darkness.

She shuddered because as she stared into it, she felt that something was staring back at her - peering into her very soul and preparing to devour her.

“There’s wind.” She raised her hand to catch a gust of wind coming from below, only to see blood - a testament to the wind’s special nature.

“Come, we’re going down.” Li Qiye jumped down. The cloud was next, then Niu Fen, and lastly, Baifeng.

The gusts were immensely sharp and could bypass defenses. This only increased the farther they delved into the abyss.

Eventually, even imperial treasures couldn’t stop the gusts. Baifeng would have been reduced to pieces long ago.

They made it to a depth where Niu Fen himself would be pierced by the gusts. Fortunately, Li Qiye blocked everything for them.

“These astral gusts are coming from the immortal weapon, it’s right beneath.” Niu Fen said.

Baifeng, on the other hand, kept silent and focused on following Li Qiye. Just one mistake and it would be all over.

After the group jumped in, others started noticing the abyss once the peak was gone.

“The immortal weapon must be down there.” Someone said after feeling the sharp gusts.

Big shots immediately arrived, not wanting to give up.

“Ahhh!” Someone jumped down without thinking twice and paid the ultimate price.

“These winds are insane.” A Grand Emperor gazed below and analyzed the perilous situation.
