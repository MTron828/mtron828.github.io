Chapter 4377: Bathing In Flames

“Poof!” An ember flew out of the firewood and kindled the entire thing.

Gentle sizzles could be heard, confirming that these were firewoods, not stones or anything else. The flames looked rather unique, resembling cultivation flames but not quite.

There was a golden hue and they appeared rather animated. They danced like spirits with dao runes surrounding them.

As one observed closely, they would get the illusion that they were staring at an ocean of dao runes, not just flames.

The runes seemed to be changing and deriving grand dao, wanting to turn into a peerless merit law. They were accompanied by unbearable heat, akin to being so close to a rising sun.

Goldbird Monarch instantly moved back to a safe distance. At the start of the melting of the outer layer, the temperature was already high enough. Now, when the flames actually appeared, it became frightening.

An expert like Goldbird still couldn’t stand the heat. If he hadn’t run fast enough, he would have been injured.

Eventually, even the ashen top layer of the hill started melting into a thick liquid. The monarch took a deep breath, realizing the reason for the appearance of the hill.

The flames from the firewood had a temperature high enough to melt the ground, leaving behind the cooled glazed substance seen prior.

This was only the start too. If these flames could be used as an attack, it would incinerate any sect in Sky Border. Their territories would then assume the same appearance as the roost.

This wasn’t the only thing frightening him. The other was Li Qiye.

Just think about it, he only needed to sit down for a moment to rekindle the flames. In all of Dragon’s history, Divine Luan Dao Lord was the only one managing to do so.

There weren’t scrolls depicting the details of her cultivation and dao comprehension. However, it did mention that she spent a considerable period of time in the roost.

Li Qiye’s case was completely different. The monarch knew just how tough it was to resonate with the flames yet Li Qiye had no problem doing so.

He should be close in age to her back then. After igniting the flames, she went on to become a dao lord.

What about Li Qiye? He did it even better so would he become a dao lord as well?

“Am I witnessing the birth of a dao lord?” The monarch murmured.

Sky Border has produced numerous experts in this generation. Thus, if Li Qiye were to reach the apex, his path would be paved with blood.

Nonetheless, the monarch was quite emotional. Although he didn’t gain much from the roost, it was an honor witnessing a potential dao lord candidate right now.

“Poof!” The flames became stronger and stronger before shooting upward like an inferno. Thus, Li Qiye was swallowed up by the unceasing flames.

A black hole appeared above since they were capable of burning everything. Even the black hole started burning up.

The entire hill started melting like ice cream to the monarch’s astonishment. He did everything he could to withstand the temperature. Alas, if this went on, he would be reduced to ashes.

“This can’t continue…” He was afraid that the roost would be destroyed.

The climax of the inferno was akin to a great star exploding. Endless shock waves rushed out in a destructive manner.

“Screech!” A true phoenix cry could be heard, capable of piercing through time itself. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The monarch had heard the cries of numerous birds, even duplications of phoenix cries. Alas, he felt his soul being pierced right now and became submissive. The cry wasn’t something he could resist. It came from the king of all birds. This was certainly the role of phoenixes.

It overshadowed anything else he had heard before.

“A phoenix?” He prostrated on the ground and panicked. He had never seen a true phoenix before but within the flame was a divine and magnificent image.

It made his true form look like a chicken in comparison. He realized what it was right away.

The emergence of the image prompted Li Qiye to action. He stood up and clenched his hand.

“Pop!” An apocalyptic force manifested into reality, instantly extinguishing the flames.

The monarch felt like an insect as a result.
