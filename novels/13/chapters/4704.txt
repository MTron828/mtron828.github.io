Chapter 4705: Golden Fist Emperor

A peerless practitioner of the way of the fist looked rather unstable and weak. The petrification phenomenon was outside of his control despite repeated attempts of stopping it with all of his power and vitality.

Here, he tried to use the power from the roots of the land in order to stop the corrosive invasion. He also thought that he had done a great job and destroyed all traces. Alas, someone still managed to find him.

“Who are you?!” He glared at the unwelcomed visitors. His eyes spewed out an expense of golden light, causing Jian Ming and the daoist to feel a sharp pain on their neck as if they had just been slashed by a divine sword. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

His fist intent came next, attempting to pulverize their chest.

“Shit!” The two immediately ran behind Li Qiye to avoid being killed.

“Senior Fist Emperor, we’re on the same side, the same side!” Jian Ming shouted to avoid a misunderstanding.

“On the same side?” The emperor stood up and his suppressive aura only intensified.

“Hehehe, on the same side indeed. This is your Golden Gate’s new son-in-law, the husband of your jewel.” The daoist laughed.

“Tingrong?” The rays from the emperor’s eyes could pierce through heart. Jian Ming trembled in fear afterward.

Though he was wounded, his aura was still dreadful. He was clearly one of the strongest cultivators in the contemporary.

He focused particularly on Jian Ming, seemingly wanting to eat the boy alive. This was commonly seen in fathers-in-law - their daughters were about to be taken away by some bastards.

“How dare you force this marriage?! State your sect affiliation!” The emperor seemed ready to smash Jian Ming into a pulp.

His rage was warranted since he had imagined the scenario of the rest of the world finding out about the immortal gemstone. They would have schemed against him and one of the strategies included threatening him with Golden Gate. A forced marriage was another one.

He didn’t trust anyone, certainly not this “son-in-law” who appeared out of nowhere. He already showed plenty of restraint by not instantly attacking.

Jian Ming raised both hands and said: “Senior, please don’t misunderstand. We were both willing, I have proof.”

Having said that, he took out a crystal badge and handed it to the emperor. This was given to him by Tingrong just in case something like this were to happen.

The emperor opened it and read her message before trusting Jian Ming.

He put it away and asked: “What are you doing here?”

He wasn’t underestimating the group, it’s just that they couldn’t do anything against the behemoths.

“Saving you, hand the stone over.” Li Qiye said.

“Save me?” The emperor glared at him: “Here for the immortal stone too?”

His aggression returned, evident by the sharp rays emanating from his eyes. Jian Ming became nervous, not wanting a fight to break out.

The emperor has been on guard and tense for so long since everyone wanted the immortal stone.

“Don’t want to?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Do you know who you will be facing?” The emperor said.

“You, True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao? In other words, Dao Sanqian and the monarchs from True Immortal.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“So you do know. Why would I hand it over to you?” The emperor said.

“Still stubborn, I see. If it wasn’t for the marriage, I would just be taking the stone and leaving you to fend for yourself.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s a strong claim.” The emperor had glimpses of murderous intent flashing in his eyes.

As a sect founder and a mighty Heavenly Sovereign, how many could actually take him down? He escaped from the alliance, albeit with the help of the immortal gemstone. Nonetheless, this still required incredible personal ability.

“Your cultivation isn’t shallow. The problem is that you’re at the end of the rope, already using one punch in Worldbreaker. A second one is impossible and most importantly, this power is beyond your control.” Li Qiye said while staring at him: “You are barely managing to hold on, the power of the Primordial Union isn’t enough to disperse the invasion. This is futile.”

“Utter nonsense.” The emperor uttered coldly.

“Is that so? Do you still think you can stop the power of the gemstone? Even if you can borrow the force of the union, it will only delay your death.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Hmph.” To which the emperor responded.

This was indeed the truth. That gemstone was capable of resisting Worldbreaker itself. Alas, it had invaded and wounded him. This would only worsen with time.

He entered the union hoping to gain another external force. Alas, he couldn’t make full use of the union, only borrowing the bare surface. It was enough to slow down the invasion but death was looming on the horizon. Because of this, the petrification process didn’t stop.

“So you’re just waiting for the gemstone.” He said.

“Why do you want it? To die faster? You can’t control it and can’t bring it back to your sect. There is no place for you to go with it in your possession.” Li Qiye said.

The emperor had no response since he was well aware of the consequences. Having this gemstone meant always being the target of the behemoths.

If he were to bring it back to Golden Gate, this meant bringing destruction back to the sect. If he chose to run alone, they would still find him eventually. The world was vast but so did their reach. Moreover, Golden Gate would become a hostage.
