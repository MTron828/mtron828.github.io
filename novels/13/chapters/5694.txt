Chapter 5695: We Shall Become Overlords

Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The prime emperor didn’t feel the same way, still having feelings regarding his fallen clan. Perhaps some weak survivors were still alive, albeit suppressed and imprisoned.

On that day when he heard the plan from Luminous, he hesitated and didn’t wish to participate. This was the reason why West Bank Imperial Clan didn’t join the previous defense.

Today, he changed his mind after another invasion - working with Luminous to obtain the immortal weapon and enter Immortal Dao City.

Although the two merely acted, their injuries were real. The fall of Dao Domain and West Bank along with the heavy casualties were real as well.

They could be healed and rebuilt again but the lost lives were long gone. They buried Dao Domain for the sake of the play, hoping to enter Immortal Dao City.

“The arrow has been shot, we can’t take it back.” Luminous said: “Our journey starts today, from emperor to overlord. We shall occupy a spot on the river of time.”

The imperial realm was considered unbeatable, let alone those who stood at the apex. However, the latter could see the dao limit and secrets unbeknown to regular cultivators. There was still a stronger realm above the dao limit. Becoming an emperor was but the beginning.

However, being born on the six continents limited them. Even the immortal continent left no room for growth.

The best chance was to leave for a stronger location. However, one known location required an expedition - something beyond the duo’s ability.

Now, Immortal Dao City was the best opportunity. Though they didn’t know whether someone had broken the limit from there, they saw that no one had returned.

This was a long list of the best cultivators. The most recent included Immortal Emperor Fei Yang and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan. They entered and even closed the artifact, resulting in Luminous’ plan.

The two didn’t care about Dao Domain or how it could fall to Celestial Court. They must have found the path toward breaking the dao limit while leaving Luminous and West Bank behind.

Luminous found this indignation unacceptable and wanted to enter Immortal Dao City at all costs.

Of course, he was far from the only one since Celestial Court shared the same desire. Thus, they conspired together.

Luminous alone couldn’t carry out the play; he needed a partner. Therefore, he went to West Bank Prime Emperor.

The latter possessed the strongest lineage in the region and had reigned in this area for a long trek of time. The bloody conflicts with Celestial Court firmly established his clan as a leader of The People.

Unfortunately, he knew that he was at the end of the road. When Luminous came with the plan, what he heard was the incarnation of hope.

However, there was a distinct difference between them. Luminous came from the lower continents. His roots and descendants remained below so he had no love for the immortal continent.

Despite being the ruler of Dao City, he was still an outsider and had no shackles. In fact, he didn’t worry much about the inhabitants of the city, only his ambition.

The same couldn’t be said about West Bank Prime Emperor who was a native. He spent his life building the clan and the western front, fighting Celestial Court along the way.

He considered the resistance as his mission. Although he couldn’t always protect The People, he could maintain the survival of his clan.

His animosity toward Celestial Court stopped their first attempt. Luminous, on the other hand, didn’t mind at all. He was reduced to ashes by Deity Dao back in the lower continents, not Celestial Court directly.

In the end, he couldn’t resist the temptation and played along with the second invasion. After all, he had only started on the path and couldn’t stop here.

He was West Bank Prime Emperor - an illustrious being absolutely qualified to embark toward the dao limit. He couldn’t accept being stuck in this realm and wanted to become a supreme overlord.

“Let’s get started then.” He took a deep breath to get over the loss of his clan and descendants.

There was no going back now; the future awaited them.

“Yes, we shall become overlords.” Luminous said with a firm gaze.

Meanwhile, outsiders had no idea what was going on in Momentous Frontier. Survivors in Dao Domain prayed that the deities would buy enough time for Imperial Field’s reinforcement to come.

“Deities, time is up, what is your decision?” War Ancient God shouted, not knowing whether the two had been successful.

“Boom!” The armies prepared for the siege.
