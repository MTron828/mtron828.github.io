Chapter 4860: Loyalty

Firerage Saber blocked Venerable Dragon God from coming closer.

“Grand Commander, please stop.” The former said, ready to swing his saber at any moment.

“Guard Commander, what is the meaning of this?” The dragon god frowned.

“I should be asking you this question, Grand Commander.” Firerage said, not wanting the dragon god to be close to Li Qiye.

If he harbored any malicious intent, Li Qiye would be a dead man.

“I just want to take a closer look at his physique.” The dragon god said.

“There is no need for that, what you should do is carry out your duties, Grand Commander.” Firerage refused.

“I need to know more about the successor.” The dragon god insisted. He wanted to see if there was anything special about Li Qiye in order to deserve the throne.

Of course, he didn’t believe that there was foul play going on. The imperial seal was the strongest proof.

“His Majesty has passed the throne down to His Highness. Grand Commander, you only need to worry about your own post. As for the reason itself, isn’t that inconsequential at this point?” Firerage said.

“Guard Commander, if I insist, you cannot stop me.” The dragon god became unhappy.

This was indeed the truth. Firerage had no chance of stopping a cultivator with five sacred fruits.

“Clank! Clank!” The imperial guards appeared and surrounded Li Qiye, ready to attack.

“I cannot stop you, Grand Commander, but if you dare to disrespect His Highness, I will still show you my blade for protecting His Highness is our sacred duty. Do not forget yours.” Firerage said with determination.

“Your absolute loyalty is commendable.” The dragon god nodded and acquiesced.

Firerage didn’t gloat and said: “Grand Commander, I’m sure you will do what is best for the dynasty.”

“I have not forgotten my duty.” The dragon god said.

“Then it is time for you to contribute to His Highness’ cause.” Firerage immediately added.

The dragon god stared at Li Qiye. As the Grand Commander of Eight-stallion, he had the trust of its soldiers.

As he pondered silently, Firerage became nervous because without his support, Li Qiye wouldn’t be able to seize the throne.

In fact, the dragon god could become the next king since he was the strongest and had the highest authority right now.

After all, he could actually protect Eight-stallion Dynasty, unlike Li Qiye. Picking the latter could end with absolute destruction.

If the citizens were to pick, the majority would pick the dragon god in order to guarantee the dynasty’s survival.

Firerage naturally understood all of this. Therefore, the dragon god’s decision was of utmost importance.

The dragon god didn’t answer right away, taking his time to judge Li Qiye.

“Grand Commander, His Majesty is no longer around but don’t forget what he had done for us.” Firerage urged.

“I’ve never forgotten.” The dragon god said solemnly.

He was not always the imperious five-fruit dragon god. At the start, he was only a sectional leader of a small sect with limited access to merit laws. Moreover, he was up there in age and had no future prospects.

He then met Eight-stallion Dao Lord who had enough insight to spot his extraordinary bloodline and persevering personality. The latter taught him how to break his limit and begin his cultivation anew.

The dragon god then followed him to numerous battlefields, eventually becoming one of the founders of Eight-stallion Dynasty.

Therefore, he gained a new life thanks to the dao lord. If it wasn’t for Eight-stallion, he would have died of old age long ago as an insignificant cultivator.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“That’s good to hear, he has shown great kindness to the both of us.” Firerage nodded.

The dragon god let out a sigh and then bowed deeply toward Li Qiye: “Your Highness, it must have been a long journey. Please rest.”

“Okay.” Li Qiye smiled.

His attitude perplexed the dragon god. A regular cultivator should be trembling in fear before his presence but this person was unaffected.

He didn’t think that His Majesty would pass the throne to a random person. Nonetheless, the decision was still unfathomable. This was his first time not understanding His Majesty’s decision.

“Chaos will return to its true form soon. An incapable man won’t last even with our support.” He stared at Firerage and sighed again before leaving.

Firerage had a heavy heart after the conversation. It seemed like the dragon god was ready to fulfill his duty and had accepted Li Qiye’s status as the successor. Alas, Chaos and Eight-stallion Dynasty weren’t peaceful.

Many villains were afraid of the dao lord, hence their subservience. Now, how could Li Qiye subdue them?

“My apology for letting you become startled, Your Highness.” Firerage lowered his head.

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “He could have easily killed all of you.”

“You are correct, Your Highness.” Firerage admitted: “The grand commander has the bloodline of a true dragon and five sacred fruits. Even if I have some sacred fruits, I still won’t be able to stop him.”

“You are only a little away.” Li Qiye said.

Firerage was surprised that Li Qiye could see this. He smiled wryly and said: “I can only blame my inadequate comprehension. His Majesty had taught me before but this is all I can do.”

A dragon lord was similar to a dao lord. In the past, Ox-dragon Ancestor has reached the limit of his sacred physique. Space Dragon Emperor had the same problem as well.

This was due to the limitation of the sovereign realm. The two of them couldn’t take the next step and become stuck in the same place. The disparity between sovereigns and dao lords only grew with time.
