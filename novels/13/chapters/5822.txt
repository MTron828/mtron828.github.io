Chapter 5822: My Pursuit Is Being Loyal To Celestial Court

Everyone including the three immortals gazed intensely at the founder. The immortals didn’t wish to betray their ancestors by giving Li Qiye the coordinates.

Would the founder do the same? Their situation was different. The immortals were loyal to the overlords but the same might not apply to the founder.

“Sacred Teacher, I will not yield to you.” The founder firmly refused.

“You kept the balance all this time but how long can it last? What will become of you when all is said and done?” Li Qiye wasn’t surprised.

“My life goal is being loyal to Celestial Court.” He said.

“I doubt it, it’s just a matter of weighing the options.” Li Qiye had an ambiguous smile.

“I’m not sure what you mean, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said.

“What was on your mind after seeing the return of your master? Did you want to hand Celestial Court over or refuse?” Li Qiye said.

The founder had a strange expression while inquisitive eyes were on him. In the past, he always viewed his master with pride - an ultimate being capable of starting an expedition. His dao came from the master who feared no one.

The crazy Lord of Derivation and peerless Dao Ancestor’s group still couldn’t compare to his master.

Alas, the being that returned was not the master that he loved and respected. He didn’t wish to see this being’s return in the slightest but it was out of his control. The only thing he could do was try his best and carry out his responsibilities.

“You know full well that you cannot preserve Celestial Court, so it is time to make a choice.” Li Qiye said.

“I’ve already made many choices, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said slowly.

“Such as not giving it your all when it came to saving Trinity Ancestor.” Li Qiye said: “Was that your choice or their decision?”

When Trinity Ancestor’s other self was trapped by High Heaven Aegis, Celestial Court appeared determined to save him.

However, they didn’t go full force since their four strongest cultivators didn’t show up.

“The reality is that you never had a choice.” Li Qiye shook his head: “You think you can balance and mediate but that’s just wishful thinking. Did you have any agency when the overlords wanted to assassinate Divine Ancestor? No, you could only watch his tragic end.”

This comment touched a nerve, evident by the founder’s change in complexion.

“Let’s talk about something more recent, did you have a choice when Dao Ancestor proposed to divide the nine worlds and thirteen continents? You did not, the same as when Lord of Derivation proposed a blood refinement to replenish their vitality. They did not respect your wish and you had no opinion to express...” Li Qiye said.

“Despite your prestigious status, you could only watch them refine the hundred races on the thirteen continents and the three races on the nine worlds. Living beings were mere ants in their eyes. These three immortals probably didn’t care due to their blind loyalty, did you feel the same way?” Li Qiye gazed at the three immortals after seeing this.

Their expression didn’t change, unlike the rest of the crowd. Demon’s group beyond the heavenly mirror was shaken.

The emperors and monarchs didn’t know of this bloody history. So the nine worlds and thirteen continents were forcefully divided?

Moreover, all the races were available in both places at the start. However, the refinement process wiped out the three races from the nine continents and the hundred races from the thirteen continents.

It took a long time before the hundred races started appearing on the thirteen continents while the three races never returned to the nine worlds.

Because of this, the three races believed they were nobles in the thirteen continents while others were mere insects from the outside world. The feud between these two factions was started by these overlords.

The three immortals supported their decision but what about the founder, a human who was in charge of maintaining prosperity just like Trinity and Divine Ancestor?

He stood there in silence. This matter was forgotten but Li Qiye had just ripped open the wounds of the past, not only for him to see but also for everyone else. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Thus, you never actually made a choice since you didn’t have the option in the first place, for you lack the courage and determination of Divine Ancestor, willing to fight to the end without any regrets. You’re also inferior to Purewood Divine Emperor, he maintained his conviction and never compromised even if it meant being hunted and needing to hide in the shadows. Your so-called maintaining balance is only a thin facade, you never dared to resist them.”

“Your words are always thought-provoking and enlightening, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said sentimentally.

Li Qiye shook his head: “I can see that you never accepted this or you would have become an overlord instead of just being one step away. Your failure to reach the everlasting stage is due to having a weak dao heart, not ready to burn the bridges and die fighting.” [1]

Everyone became emotional upon hearing this.
