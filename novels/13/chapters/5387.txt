Chapter 5388: She Was Wonderful

Flowers on the old tree met the breeze of spring and scattered downward. Sipping tea and basking in this scenery made one feel incredible - truly the life of immortals.

“As long as the heart beats, there will be thoughts and desires. Just one wrong step and there will be an eternity of mistakes. You know, she knows, isn’t that enough? Having an end is not a bad thing at all.” Li Qiye commented.

“Isn’t that a rather cruel thing to say, Sir?” Darkfrost responded.

Li Qiye blew his teacup and took another sip before responding: “Who is crueler, the one saying goodbye or the one leaving? Who is in the better position now?”

“Perhaps she is.” He took a second before responding.

His wife lived as the queen of a dao lord and eventually passed away from old age with her husband on her side.

They had the ability to prolong her life through various means, potentially bringing her up to the six continents and continuing their cultivation. However, she chose to die naturally without any attempt at life prolongation.

“She lived a wonderful life and she knew it, it ended on a positive note.” Li Qiye sighed.

“Right.” He agreed.

The gap between them was ever so present. After all, how could she keep up with a great genius forever? As long as they kept on the same dao path, this disparity would continue to grow.

“It’s a long road and many, after becoming weary, choose to rest instead.” Li Qiye said.

“It is wearing me down even now.” Darkfrost said softly after reflecting on the past.

“The climb only gets harder.” Li Qiye commented.

Despite Darkfrost’s firm dao heart, he still felt something bitter about his life choices. Cultivation was far from easy for normal people.

Only madmen or those born with an innate love for the dao could walk this road without complications.

In a sense, his wife was fortunate. She started as an ordinary cultivator from Flame Valley. If she hadn’t met him, she would have grown old and become forgotten in history.

Because of their meeting, she became a queen and lived a life full of love. Despite his constant protection and guidance, she toiled constantly in order to be worthy of her position.

The world knew of her greatness but not of her struggle. Following his footsteps was an arduous matter; she knew that the future would only create a larger distance between them.

Moreover, she also knew that as long as she was alive, he would inadvertently slow down and wait for her.

This was no fault of her own. She gave it her very best but her husband was simply brilliant - a dragon destined to soar. She chose to rest so that he would be freed from her shackles.

“It was my fault.” He came to this conclusion.

“No, you brought light and love into her life, but that’s not to say that she wasn’t worthy of you. After all, she must have been an incredible woman for you to be dwelling in the past even now.” Li Qiye said.

“She was wonderful.” He said softly.

Li Qiye smiled and ate a special apricot without responding.

They sat in silence for a bit before Darkfrost asked: “Sir, how can you walk alone for so long?”

“If the path can be climbed alone, why do you need companions? The separation of a few steps can eventually become a thousand miles.” Li Qiye said: “If there is no way to mend this gap, it’s better not to start.”

“The emptiness when I look around makes me waver.” He said.

“If you can revive her, would you? Do not think, answer now.” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes.” He answered instantly.

Li Qiye sighed in response: “Your dao heart is unstable so you will not be able to resist the temptation. You may think you can now but once you face it, it will be an entirely different story.”

“I understand your implication, Sir.” He said.

“Revival is an ominous matter and is it what she wants?” Li Qiye said.

“I know that I shouldn’t do it for a multitude of reasons.” He gently nodded.

“Yes, you must cut it off or let it go, this is a part of cultivation.” Li Qiye said.

“I do not know what to do.” He responded.

“What else can you do?” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Move forward, that’s the only thing.” He responded.

“Cultivation is a journey forward to transcend boundaries. The farther you go, the more unfamiliar the world becomes. You must learn to let go.” Li Qiye nodded.

“But the memories remain.” He said softly.

“Don’t be shackled by them but remember to embrace and cherish them for they are the keys to maintaining your humanity.” Li Qiye said: “Now that you have more time to think, I ask you the same question again, revive or not?”

“You know the answer, Sir.” He said.

“Yes, the current you will choose to revive her despite knowing the drawbacks. This is dangerous because as you travel farther on the path, you will become alienated from your past and the world. At that point, what she wants and the potential ominous compilations matter not, only your own desire.”
