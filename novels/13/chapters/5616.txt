Chapter 5617: Infiltrated My Clan

Lightning bolts erupted within the jellyfish, adding yellow runes to its crystal shade. The exterior became as bright and golden as the high heaven.

In this split second, spectators would be able to see the yellow runes outlining something akin to the gigantic crab of the constellation known as Cancer.

The crab swallowed the power assaulting the shield and then spat it back out in a mystical manner, storing it for future use.

“You can have this back.” Li Qiye channeled the power into his body.

“Bam!” He gained a red aura before raising his hand, releasing a devastating palm strike capable of destroying worlds without needing to use his cultivation.

Her expression changed as she retaliated with a defensive palm strike, sealing all directions. One would be hard-pressed to find someone capable of breaking her defense.

“Bam!” She blocked it successfully and found that it had an identical force as her previous strike.

The impact lifted the water of the vast ocean beneath, creating an awe-inspiring spectacle.

“Hmph!” She became serious, seemingly wanting to kill Li Qiye. Few could withstand her activated aura.

“Suxin, let’s talk it out, alright?” Li Qiye raised his jellyfish again and smiled: “But if you want to vent, give it a good beating. Unleash a thousand palm strikes until your anger subsides.”

The woman pulled her hand back and glared at the shield.

“Always hiding in the shadows, does it work?” She coldly uttered, seemingly having no equals in this world.

“Depends on the perspective.” Li Qiye shrugged.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

She sneered in response. Even her sneer was graceful like a bright moon emerging from dark clouds.

“Just like before, lurking in the shadows and scheming in secrecy. I should have stripped your skin and pulled out your tendons back then.” She said.

“Sigh, that hurts my feelings.” He shook his head: “You’re making it sound like I’ve committed some unforgivable crime when all I’ve done is toil for others.”

“Is that so?” She approached the bed, wanting to look down on him. Her aggressive and imposing attitude didn’t diminish her beauty but made her feel more vibrant. 

“You know what you did when you infiltrated my clan. I should have killed you.” Her gaze was sharp like a pair of golden scissors capable of cutting him into two.

“I disagree. I entered your clan through the front entrance and all I did was drink some tea and talk, nothing more.” He shook his head.

“If it weren’t for you, our clan wouldn’t have been massacred. It’s all because of your poisonous instigation.” She said menacingly.

“You’re blaming the wrong person. You know full well that without my involvement, Celestial Court would have still made their move. The only way to avoid that fate was to become their hounds for life.” He argued.

“The Qian stood at the apex of all races, we didn’t need to yield to Celestial Court. You were the harbinger of calamity, the reason why everyone was reduced to ashes in battle.” Her eyes gleamed brightly and her murderous intent surged.

“The downfall of the Qian is truly regrettable.” He sighed softly and said: “But it was inevitable.”

“Hmph, you speak so lightly of our deaths.” Her hatred didn’t wane: “Is this your answer to our suffering?”

“I need not answer.” He shrugged: “The karma didn’t originate from me but rather, the relationship between your clan and Celestial Court. They simply decided to make a move then.”

“If it weren’t for your misleading whispers, things wouldn’t have taken this turn.” She said.

“An emperor such as yourself who has undergone a dao reconstruction should know better than to place the blame on me. Was your old man a gullible villager who could be tricked? No, he knew exactly what he was doing.” He met her gaze directly.

“What about Suyun then?” If words could pierce, Li Qiye’s heart would be in pieces right now.

He sighed and nodded: “If someone must take responsibility for this, I will accept it.”

“Of course, the responsibility lies on you, you were the cause of her suffering and death!” She coldly uttered.

“If you think that way, it shows that you don’t understand her despite growing up together.” He said: “She was not weak nor was she a pampered princess. She had her aspirations and ambition, her inner strength exceeded your imagination. As a Grand Emperor and a Conqueror, you surely know that an indomitable dao heart can’t be easily influenced by someone else. She merely held onto her own goal.”

“She wouldn’t have descended to the mortal world without your involvement.” She said.

“Sure, she wouldn’t have descended but the way I see it, she would have left your clan eventually to face the storms outside. That’s who she was, a kind, beautiful, and strong woman.” He said sentimentally with a smile.
