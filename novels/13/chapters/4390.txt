Chapter 4391: Internal Conflict

“No need to dwell on this feud issue, just hand him over.” Celestial Tiger demanded: “I won’t make it difficult for you, Junior Sister, the elders will be the ones in charge. I just can’t let him go.”

He was direct about this goal, coming only for Li Qiye and not Jian Qingzhu.

“Are you under orders from the sect master, Senior Brother?” Her eyes narrowed.

“No, he did not give the order but I can’t forgive anyone who killed our fellow sect members. They can’t die in vain. As the first brother, this is my responsibility.” He shook his head.

“Well said.” The crowd members praised; some even applauded or gave him a thumbs-up.

“That’s First Brother for you, the leader of the young generation. Those words alone are worthy of us risking our lives for his cause.” One disciple felt his blood boiling.

“It is an honor to have a leader like him since he cares about each and all of us. I am willing to offer my service.” Another added.

His comment just now earned him the love of the crowd. If they were to choose a successor right now, the majority here would absolutely pick him.

“Comparison is the thief of joy.” A female disciple murmured: “They’re both geniuses but First Brother is righteous, ready to die for his sect. On the other hand, Senior Sister Jian is abandoning her principles for personal feelings.”

“Indeed.” Someone else complained: “She’s going against her own sect for this nobody, truly ungrateful of what the sect has done for her in the last decade.”

Everyone gossiped quietly; some cursed Jian Qingzhu because they viewed her as a traitor who was not worthy of being the saintess.

Qingzhu didn’t mind the insults and calmly stood there. She knew exactly what she was doing.

If Celestial Tiger was here for the sake of the sect, so was she. Nonetheless, they only knew about his noble intent, not hers.

“Senior Brother, you must get through me first if you wish to capture Young Noble Li.” She shook her head and infuriated the crowd again.

A few outsiders couldn’t understand. One of them muttered: “Why is the saintess of Dragon so hellbent on protecting this guy?”

“The only explanation is stupidity, she’s betraying her sect because of this man.” Someone from Dragon answered.

“What a waste of resources.” Another girl said with disdain.

Celestial Tiger stared at her and asked: “Junior Sister, think about this carefully, is this little sect master worthy of you betraying the sect?”

“As I’ve said, this is a misunderstanding. Everything I’m doing is for the sake of the sect.” She replied.

“Ridiculous!” He didn’t buy it.

“Alright, shouldn’t you two fight already? Otherwise, I’m leaving since I don’t have time for this nonsense dragging out. I have some stuff to grab.”

“Such impudence!” Celestial Tiger glared at Li Qiye again but the guy was unaffected.

“Not to mention your previous crime, your comment just now deserves death.” He threatened. This was not an empty threat since he was a capable cultivator. He proved his power after traveling to Eastern Desolace and defeating many geniuses there.

“Plenty of people want to kill me, adding one more is not a big deal. It depends on your ability though.” Li Qiye shrugged, not giving a damn about Celestial Tiger as if he was absolutely superior.

Both Celestial Tiger and the crowd couldn’t handle this.

“This dog is so brave and haughty!” One disciple was livid.

“First Brother can kill you with one move!” Another shouted.

“Ignorant fool, who do you think you are?!”

“First Brother, cut off his legs first and avenge our fallen members!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The crowd was furious and wanted to see Li Qiye being cut down to pieces. Celestial Tiger felt the same way. Lightning coursed within his eyes in an intimidating manner.

“So be it. I heard you have incredible treasures and sorcerous abilities, I don’t buy it though. We’ll see if you are qualified to act haughty in Dragon.” Though he despised Li Qiye, he still insisted on a duel.

“Young Noble, let me fight instead. You can take action if I lose.” Qingzhu interjected.

“I believe others are blind to your kind intention.” He told her with a smile: “But fine, go for it.”

She bowed after receiving approval.

“Hmph, Dragon is humiliated because of her!” A female disciple saw the bow and found it unacceptable.

“Why is she debasing herself? The saintess of Dragon need not show respect to anyone.” A neutral party didn’t like it either.

“She must be sick in the head, this is ruining our reputation.” This sentiment echoed among them.

Their contempt for her grew as they watched her subservience.

“Senior Brother, please give me points.” She stepped forward and challenged.

“Junior Sister, you have disappointed the sect and ruined its reputation.” Celestial Tiger shook his head.

“Worry not about ego and vanity. You should be worrying about yourself since you are a pillar of Dragon. Losing you will be regrettable.” She replied.

The reason she asked to fight was to prevent Li Qiye from killing Celestial Tiger. It wasn’t easy for the sect to train someone like him. Plus, she didn’t want to see more sect members die.

“You are a pillar as well yet you are acting like a sycophant to this sect master. Even if I were to drop this, I’m afraid the sect will persecute you. What is your justification?” He said sternly.

“Yes, we demand an answer!” One crowd member shouted furiously.
