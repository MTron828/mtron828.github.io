Chapter 3820: Starting

“Not running away anymore?” A cold voice sounded and interrupted the pondering crowd. Its murderous intent made others shudder in fear.

They saw Sword Hero appearing on the horizon. Beneath his feet were floating swords spanning from Minor Sacred Mountain all the way to Duality Academy, allowing him to walk unhindered in the air.

The sword path released continuous sharp energy waves. Meanwhile, other swords in the vicinity resonated as well.

Cultivators all over the holy ground looked up and saw the sword path. The remnant sword intent resembled chaotic gales, truly discomforting the crowd.

He strolled across the path akin to a supreme sword god capable of severing the firmaments and levels of hell.

He didn’t hold back on both his murderous intent and oppressive momentum. The crowd had a hard time being in his presence.

“So strong...” No one could refute this right now. They thought that he was comparable to the four grandmasters.

Though he wasn’t in a rush, he still appeared on top of Myriad Cauldron Peak in no time at all. He scanned the area and instilled pain to those he gazed upon. It seemed that in his eyes, everyone else was mere ants.

“It doesn’t matter where you go, I’ll still teach you a lesson.” Sword Hero glared at Righteous Scion.

The scion furrowed his brows before laughing, wanting to retort. However, Xu Cuimei stopped him.

“I can sympathize with you wanting to stand up for the young generation of Buddha Holy Ground but we won’t play along.” She smiled and said.

“Sharp tongue, little lady. Who are you?” Sword Hero replied. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I am only a common disciple from Righteous Sect. However, don’t waste your time on me, you should worry about whether the young master will allow you to mess with us.” She showed no fear even when speaking to such a powerful existence.

Others held their breath as their knees trembled due to his aura. On the other hand, Xu Cuimei was as calm as can be.

This naturally surprised the spectators. Some big shots thought that there was more than meets the eye about her.

“Who is she, really?” A big shot wondered. She couldn’t possibly be an ordinary disciple from Righteous.

“I haven’t heard of anyone like her in the actual sect.” An ancestor who was a guest there more than once pondered.

A top genius would be groomed by the ancestors and become renowned. This wasn’t the case for Xu Cuimei. No one has heard of her before, not even the big shots who were familiar with Righteous Sect.

Sword Hero’s murderous intent surged as his gaze shifted towards Li Qiye.

“Since when does a member of the holy ground protect the enemies?” His voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

The older characters started thinking. As members of the previous generation, they knew that although Sword Hero was relatively close in age with the scion, he was still part of the previous generation - an ancestor-level character similar to the four grandmasters.

Moreover, he was from the royal family as well. It wasn’t suitable for him to try and teach the scion a lesson regardless of the latter’s arrogance.

Furthermore, the scion didn’t actually insult the holy ground during the journey. He maintained a certain level of propriety and merely challenged the young generation.

All in all, it was strange for Sword Hero to be hellbent on this matter.

“He must be annoyed, it has to be from the trip to the palace earlier.” An important character who knew Sword Hero quietly said.

His peers nodded in agreement. Not long ago, Sword Hero wanted to deal with Li Qiye but Ye Mingshi stopped him with an imperial summon. It seemed like Archaic Sun King must have frustrated him during the meeting.

From an outside perspective, Archaic Sun King was inferior. Nonetheless, he had authority as the king and could control Sword Hero.

Some assumed that this was due to jealousy. It wasn’t easy having such an excellent little brother.

Because of this, the vexed Sword Hero came out of the palace just in time to see the scion acting haughty. Thus, he wanted to show the youth the might of the holy ground.

Meanwhile, the youths didn’t think about this at all. They have been suppressed by the scion and actually supported Sword Hero. Plus, they viewed Li Qiye as a traitor who conspired with Righteous Sect.

“This guy has never done anything for the holy ground. Oh wait, he murdered our geniuses and helped the enemies, what a scum.” One genius snorted with disdain.

“All traitors should be put to death, kill him!” A youth who hated Li Qiye shouted.

“Your Highness, this dog bites the hand that feeds him. He deserves death!” Many started chiming in.

“Your Highness, please personally rid the holy ground of this vermin!” They wanted to see Sword Hero slay Li Qiye.

Of course, some youths actually wanted to support Li Qiye. Alas, they didn’t want to go against the mass.

To speak up for Li Qiye now could be risky since others might accuse them of supporting a traitor.

“So unreasonable, can’t beat them so they want to use a borrowed knife.” A genius whispered.

Everyone could tell that the scion was virtually unbeatable, standing at the top of the young generation.

Li Qiye’s devilishness was well-documented too. Everyone was afraid of him in Vajra. He became the thorn in the eyes of the geniuses as well.

Thus, it became apparent that these furious geniuses also wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to get rid of some powerful foes.

With Li Qiye and the scion gone, there was more room for them to grow and become famous.

“Looks like you have a bad reputation.” Sword Hero frowned while speaking at Li Qiye.
