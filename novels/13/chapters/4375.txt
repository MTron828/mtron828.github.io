Chapter 4376: True Appearance

The dao lord made the hill lit up in flames so she was rather special. Future generations assumed that she had learned a supreme grand dao in this place, hence the special phenomenon.

This was the primary reason why the entire sect considered the roost to be a significant location. She didn’t learn the top techniques of Space Dragon Emperor or Myriad Eyes Dao Lord. Her path was completely different and originated from this place.

This meant that by learning the mysteries here, one would embark on the path culminating in the final cultivation realm. This was priceless for any sect.

Therefore, the entry requirements have been stringent. Alas, no one had been able to replicate the feat. Nonetheless, Phoenix Ground still hoped that this might change in the future.

“Divine Luan Dao Lord was the only one who could spark the flames here. No one else managed to eke out a single ember, not even the most promising demon gods.” The monarch said.

Phoenix Ground had attempted numerous experiments before. One of the most hopeful was none other than Nine-tailed God, a member of the three branches.

His talents on top of the three branches’ full support gave him a chance to enter. Of course, he surely benefited from the trip but it was nothing compared to what Divine Luan Dao Lord had obtained.

This failure made some ancestors feel like giving up. He was extremely gifted on top of having their full support yet this was still not enough. This dealt a great blow to the ancestors.

Perhaps only the chosen ones could ignite the flames here - those meant to be dao lords. Thus, entering the roost gradually became a method of training instead. Getting true success became a matter of luck and fate.

“Not everyone can obtain a fiery rebirth.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s what it is?” He became emotional.

This was speculated before - both Sacred Luan’s transformation and Divine Luan Dao Lord’s supreme comprehension. Many ancestors certainly thought so.

Though the dao lord didn’t talk about it, they knew that it had to do with the flames of the phoenix. The rebirth could work on two levels - a physical and a grand dao one.

Li Qiye only smiled and sat down on top of the firewood.

“Young Noble, are you meditating to learn the dao here?” The monarch asked.

“It’s not quite the dao, just an innate gift.” Li Qiye said.

“Gift? Whose?” He became confused.

“What do you think this place is?” Li Qiye glanced down and said.

“Well…” He looked around and didn’t answer. What should he say? The roost of a phoenix?

It certainly didn’t look like one. An immortal stone? Perhaps in terms of appearance, but not quite either.

“Move back, you can’t handle this power.” Li Qiye didn’t reveal more and waved his hand.

He took a deep breath and kept a considerable distance from Li Qiye.

With him gone, Li Qiye placed both hands in front of his dantian and started forming mudras. He closed his eyes, looking like a Buddha sitting on a golden lotus.

The monarch watched with bated breath. His first reaction was that Li Qiye was trying to comprehend the dao. However, Li Qiye said something about an innate gift.

This was even more confusing because innate gifts were present from birth. It was impossible to obtain them afterward. Was he trying to obtain one here?

“Buzz.” The firewood beneath Li Qiye suddenly lit up. This was akin to cooling charcoal still having a little spark in them, on the verge of burning again.

The monarch couldn’t believe it; his mouth became wide open. He had personally trained here for three years and attempted many methods. Alas, he got nothing, not even managing to heat up the firewood.

On the other hand, Li Qiye only sat down for a bit and managed to activate them.

Though he couldn’t see what Divine Luan Dao Lord did here previously, he was certain that she didn’t do it as fast. He felt that he could ignite the flames again.

Sure enough, a heatwave greeted him a moment later. It was as strong as an erupting volcano releasing lava.

He hurriedly retreated and activated his chaos energy for protection. This was only an initial spark yet it could injure him. The fully activated flames should be horrifying.

“Buzz.” The outer layer of the firewood suddenly melted. After the heat removed this layer, it turned out that these things were actually wood, not stones or anything else.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
