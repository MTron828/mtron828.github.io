Chapter 4147: Abyss Sword Dao

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The scion seemed ready to fight or even kill Li Qiye. The crowd exchanged glances, thinking that this was quite a coincidence.

The scion questioned Li Qiye then the bandits started attacking Dark Dragon Island right after? Some thought that they must have been working together.

Attacking Dark Dragon Island would prevent Li Qiye’s reinforcement. The majority of his legion was located on this island and they were stuck, unable to help their boss.

This was Li Qiye’s weakest state - the best time to capture him.

“Eight-hundred Li Court is actually working with an orthodox sect?” One cultivator asked.

The islands consisted of bandits and villains - men whose status was completely different from members of Sea Emperor.

In fact, one could say that they were mortal enemies because Sea Emperor represented the righteous faction in Sword Continent.

Subduing evil was their mission. Would they still work with the bandits and vice versa?

“Nothing is impossible.” A big shot answered: “Eight-hundred Li Court might not be able to refuse. Remember, there’s a heavy price in not obeying Sea Emperor.”

This was indeed the case. Sea Emperor could call other powerful sects to attack Cloud Dream Lake. It wouldn’t be a good situation for the bandits regardless of their power. Thus, Eight-hundred Li Court probably didn’t dare to refuse Sea Emperor’s plan against Li Qiye.

“So the scion didn’t only come to watch the battle.” Someone else said.

“Of course, he did steal their future queen.” An expert whispered.

The scion clearly came with eradicating Li Qiye in mind. Sea Emperor had no intention of letting this go.

“Surrender obediently or do I have to make you?” The scion threatened.

“Scion, don’t get ahead of yourself now. You have to deal with me first.” Xu Yiyun answered instead.

She knew that no reinforcement would be coming so she shouldered the responsibility of protecting Li Qiye.

“Pendant Sword Maiden.” The scion glared at her and said: “If you must interfere, I will end you.”

He spoke confidently since he came prepared to take the princess away on top of killing Li Qiye.

“Very well, let’s see what you can do with your heavenly sword art then.” Her being amicable normally didn’t mean that she would back down against her foes.

Though she didn’t have a heavenly art, she still wanted to try fighting.

“Clank!” She stepped forward and unsheathed her sword, exuding a bright radiance.

“A fight between sword prodigies.” Someone whistled as the crowd became excited.

The ten prodigies represented the peak of the young generation. Therefore, this fight was absolutely worth watching. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The maiden can’t beat the scion. The gap is too clear.” One ancestor concluded before the start of the fight.

This was understandable since her talent and background were inferior. The scion had the Abyss Sword Dao on top of possessing a dao lord weapon.

“You’re courting death.” The scion unsheathed his sword and released an oppressive dao lord aura.

“Violet Abyss!” Others shuddered in fear after seeing this dao lord sword left behind by Violet Abyss Dao Lord.

This sword wasn’t actually the dao lord’s stronger weapon. Nonetheless, it was purposely created by the dao lord for the descendants to use in conjunction with the Abyss Sword Dao.

“Make your move.” The scion looked unstoppable while wielding Violet Abyss, capable of eliminating Xu Yiyun with just one hand wave.

His powerful aura alone intimidated the young spectators.

“So strong, he’s definitely first place among the tenth.” One genius took a deep breath, astonished.

They thought that they were no match for him even before the start of the fight. Nonetheless, this wasn’t shameful at all. He was a prodigy with access to all the best tools possible. Even last-gen experts would be taken down all the same.

“Fine.” Xu Yiyun wasn’t afraid at all. Her sword started vibrating and issuing hymns.

“Buzz.” A ray shot to the sky with enough momentum to cause the galaxy to spin.

“This is the Xu’s legacy? Their Eight-strike Sword Law is also very impressive.” One expert said.

The young ones were also in awe of her power. This was enough for her to dominate but alas, she was facing Abyss Scion today.

“Know your place.” The ground beneath the scion’s feet caved downward as he unleashed his sword dao.

An abyss manifested out of nowhere and sucked in Xu Yiyun along with her sword energy. Everything inside this abyss was being pressured by a dao lord aura.

“Rumble!” Xu Yiyun was trapped right away; her ray earlier dissipated.

“Abyss Sword Dao!” A youth screamed, aware that he would die right away to this move.

“The heavenly swords live up to their fame.” A last-gen master took a deep breath.

“Yes, the maiden is no match for him.” One ancestor shook his head after seeing Yiyun being trapped in the abyss. This fight wouldn’t last long in his opinion.

“Clank!” She unleashed a majestic sword energy with a verdant glow while being stuck in there, severing everything in its path.
