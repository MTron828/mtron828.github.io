Chapter 4933: Stealing Fortune

Halo Scion clearly implied that Li Qiye was the one who stole their treasure.

“Bah, ridiculous, Deity isn’t the only one with treasures.” Ming Shi immediately barked back.

“Halo Scion, please watch your words.” Yunyun uttered coldly.

His crush’s criticism left him in a tough situation. Alas, he answered back: “There is no smoke without fire, there’s a reason why he’s hiding everything about himself.”

“Deity doesn’t have anything worthy of my time, but you do deserve some punishment for your insults.” Li Qiye calmly said.

“Punishment? As if, show me what you can do then.” Halo Scion has never been afraid of anyone for he was the young lord of Heaven Burial and a descendant of Skystomper God. He would have taught Li Qiye a lesson if it wasn’t for Yunyun and Ming Shi.

“Fighting and killing would make me a bully, and I don’t want that. Let’s do this, I will make sure that you gain nothing from the pawnshop.” Li Qiye smiled.

Suddenly, Halo Scion had a flash around him for a split second. He didn’t know what was going on.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This surprised listeners as well because it wasn’t possible. Once they digested the information, they started laughing as if it was the most hilarious thing in the world.

“Has the brat gone mad?” A student from The Race sneered.

“Does he think he is Fortune itself? Talking about controlling someone’s fortune. Even the old man can’t do so, let alone someone else.” Someone from The People said.

“Did you hear that? You can stop dreaming about any treasure now.” Ming Shi, on the other hand, supported Li Qiye.

Yunyun and Goldcrest have never heard of such a thing - controlling fortune. Who could steal someone’s fortune? In a sense, killing and robbing their corpse could count as “stealing fortune” but this wasn’t the case here.

“Hahaha!” Halo nearly had tears from laughing so hard. He said: “Who do you think you are, to talk about deciding the outcome, haha, idiot.”

“It’s fine if you don’t believe me.” Li Qiye didn’t mind the insult.

“Scion, show him your fortune then.” Students from The Race shouted.

They didn’t think he could steal anyone’s fortune because only the heaven could do so.

“Very well, I will let you know your place, brat.” Halo said and walked toward the carriage.

The students who lined up let him cut to the front because they wanted to watch the show as well.

“I will pawn this.” Halo took out a relatively precious cobra bone made into a ring. Its divinity erupted after being exposed.

“Start.” The old man didn’t care about it either and opened the sack.

He immediately reached inside while everyone watched with bated breath. They wanted to see if he could get treasure - even the most ordinary one would be fine.

After all, if he were to come back with something, that would be akin to slapping Li Qiye in the face.

One second came after another, the atmosphere grew increasingly tense. Halo Scion’s face turned red because it felt as if his hand was stuck inside a massive world. He reached around repeatedly but couldn’t grab anything.

“Time’s up.” The old man said.

He had no choice but to pull back, revealing that he got nothing. Li Qiye was proven right.

Of course, no one thought that he was conspiring with the old man. The latter didn’t care for top masters, let alone a junior.

“Was his fortune really stolen?” One student murmured.

“Please, this is only a coincidence, the scion just wasn’t lucky. He isn’t the only one who got nothing either.” A friend didn’t buy it.

Many agreed with this statement, especially those who disliked Li Qiye.

“Right, I didn’t get anything either.” Another student said. Failing the gamble wasn’t embarrassing at all.

“Hey, where’s your treasure?” Ming Shi didn’t miss the chance.

Halo just wanted to leave and answered: “It’s just a coincidence, a blind cat coming across a dead mouse, that’s all.”

“Can’t even lose gracefully, I see.” Ming Shi smirked, always paying back a debt.

“It’s just one time, it doesn’t mean anything.” Swordgrasp came to help his friend: “Don’t think too much of it.”

“Then you go try, let’s see if our young noble can steal your fortune or not.” Ming Shi responded.

Goldcrest was interested in this as well and said: “Brother Swordgrasp, test to see if it’s meaningless then. If you get something, then you will be proven right.”

Since his secret was revealed by Li Qiye, he was still thinking about it deeply. This was another test in his eyes.

Yunyun found this hard to believe as well. Was stealing luck an actual thing?

The students here didn’t buy it either. However, they didn’t want to be involved in this bad karma right now and preferred Swordgrasp to try instead.

“Go for it.” A student from The People said, still holding a grudge about the interrogation.

“He’s afraid.” Another joined in.

“This is so silly, we shouldn’t believe this at all.” Someone from The Race helped him out.

Swordgrasp was left in a tough spot. If he didn’t step up, it would look as if he was afraid of Li Qiye - something detrimental to his current leadership role.
