Chapter 5621: Immortal Bone

“Go!” A conqueror leaped into the sky and summoned a bright sphere. He gathered more imperial power and shot out a beam straight at Titanic Conqueror.

“Halo Conqueror!” The boundless beam engulfed the air with incredible destruction.

Titanic merely waved her hand, utilizing her special ability.

“Bam!” It carried the weight of the entire continent, easily crushing the beam and the bright sphere.

“Ugh…” Halo Conqueror vomited blood while being smashed down to the ground, bloodied and beaten.

“Just like her reputation.” Everyone gasped after seeing this.

Rumor has it that this apex conqueror possessed a one-of-a-kind immortal bone. Information regarding the bone was limited to mere speculations and rumors.

One account depicted her being born with a bone mysteriously inside her mouth. When she started crying, the bone fused into her body and became her own.

Another said that she was already born with it naturally. Its presence granted a unique ability - boundless weight.

Once activated, she wielded the weight of three thousand worlds. Even an emperor couldn’t withstand this level of physical ability.

Some said that it gave her another ability - extreme speed. Members of Celestial Court believed that if she wanted to, she could become faster than Heaven Burial Conqueror.

Moreover, the bone was said to have a holy affinity. This allowed her to purify anything in the world including her opponents’ abilities. Whispers of her being more sacred than Light-dragon Conqueror weren’t uncommon.

However, she rarely took action and when she did, it always ended in victory. Just her weight alone suppressed one top master after another. None had the privilege of seeing the limit of her immortal bone.

Nonetheless, these tales and legends placed her one level higher than the other apex cultivators, at least in the public’s opinion.

All this time, none could resist being tempted by her immortal bone, not just The People but also Celestial Court.

Such a bone had never appeared among the three races before. She alone had this unique gift while others thought about studying and potentially duplicating it.

Most frighteningly, she also had a primordial dao fruit. The two innate gifts combined were matchless.

Others called Light-dragon Conqueror to be Celestial Court’s favorite. If that were the case, then Titanic Conqueror was the high heaven’s favorite.

“Buzz.” Space started trembling as Titanic became ethereal, seemingly escaping from the fabrics of reality.

The area around her collapsed entirely, buried by her movement.

“What is she doing?” Spectators below had a terrible feeling about this destructive development.

“She’s increasing in speed.” A Grand Emperor murmured with a serious expression.

His assessment was correct - Titanic used a special technique to increase her movement. She was so fast that others could only see an ethereal image - not the actual vibration in her body.

This speed allowed her to bypass any barrier but fortunately for Thousand Emperor Island, her goal was above.

“She’s aiming for Empress Star, the palace.” Her goal became clear to the top cultivators present.

Everyone knew about the star’s special suppression. The empress sealed her abode, not wanting any unwelcome visitors.

None dared to try to visit her when she was around except Lunargrasp Immortal Monarch.

The latter failed the first attempt and had to learn the dao of Immortal Dao City before trying again. With its help, she was able to enter the star.

This pure borrowed power strengthened her, allowing her to fight together with the empress during Grand Dao War. Immortal Emperor Fei Yang and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan didn’t possess the same level of control over the artifact.

Once the empress was thought to be gone, future generations attempted to visit her home to no avail.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

There was one exception - Duality Master. Rumor has it that he didn’t use pure force like Lunargrasp Immortal Monarch. He merely entered as if the suppression didn’t work on him, or perhaps he was not a target in the first place.

Of course, people weren’t surprised because Duality Master was the most enigmatic miracle in existence.

He easily entered Immortal Dao City and Celestial Court without facing any resistance. Some believed he made it to the other shore - the farthest region of Celestial Court.

This place had stopped the duck egg buyer and his allies previously. They just didn’t have Duality Master among their ranks; the word “impossible” didn’t apply to him.

Today, there was another attempt - Titanic Conqueror.
