Chapter 4838: White Crane Legion

Inside a warm palace with jade pillars all around and an open ceiling, the curtain draped down.

Li Qiye embraced Tantai Ruonan while she leaned on his chest with her eyes closed, enjoying the moment of serenity.

He inhaled the sweet fragrance exuded from her soft hair and listened to her heartbeat. This heart has been waiting for him for eras now without wavering once.

After a while, she looked up at the round moon and said: “It’s a full moon, just like the one back then.”

“True, how nostalgic.” Li Qiye followed her gaze and said softly.

“I still remember that night, a red moon and an equally red ocean of corpses and blood.” She said.

“It’s impossible to forget.” He agreed.

That night was brutal. They fought side by side and lost many soldiers in the battle. Eventually, a mountain of corpses piled up beneath them. They barely survived and eventually made it to dawn.

“It’s all in the past, the same with your mission.” He said.

“Yes, my mission is accomplished.” She nested in his chest.

“Must be nice.” He said sentimentally.

“Right, there is no end in sight for your path still, Young Master.” She gently rubbed her forehead against him.

“My path is endless, that’s just part of the grand dao.” He gazed at the bright moon above.

“I wish to follow you but I’ll just become a hindrance.” She said.

She was considered unstoppable in Eight Desolaces. Alas, Li Qiye’s path was arduous and tormentingly long. Her power was insufficient to follow him.

“As long as we’re both alive, there’s no need to walk together.” He stroked her hair.

“I know.” She responded: “Leave certain matters here to me.”

“No, you have already done enough.” He disagreed.

“Young Master, you’re working hard and so will I. Plus, I have no other responsibility in this world, let me do what I can.” She grabbed his hand and insisted with a serious expression.

She had toiled for eras but after the death of Triune Alligator Lord, there was nothing else for her to do in Eight Desolaces.

“Alright, stay at the Primordial Tree.” He met her eyes.

“Very well.” She agreed.

“White Crane is no longer here, unlike Tiger. If everyone agrees, I will leave it to you. The eternal glory needs a leader.” He said.

“Rest assured I’ll do a commendable job, Young Master.” She accepted right away.

This was indeed the truth since she was no stranger to leading legions. In fact, she was the commander of White Crane Legion. Under her leadership, it flattened the enemies and the path for Li Qiye.

“I know you will.” He didn’t worry about her leadership ability.

“It’s been quite a while, White Crane is no longer the same.” She said softly.

“Yes, it has flown long enough for me to almost forget. I wonder where it is now.” He gazed at the horizon. 

The mysterious White Crane Legion has left on a special mission. People often said that Tiger was the fiercest and White Crane was the most elusive.

By this point, the world no longer knew about its existence. Ancient beings with a strong grasp on history who knew about the dark crow didn’t have any knowledge of it either. Those that have heard of it before would assume that it was long gone.

“A journey can’t last forever, it will return one day.” She said.

“I hope so.” He said: “The world has changed.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Just not your dao heart.” She praised.

He chuckled and continued to appreciate the full moon.

On a chilling night with white dew covering the jade steps yet Lin Mo sat there in only a thin dress. Her chin rested on both hands as she stared at the stars.

She was Blessed Dao Lord’s blood sister, not a martial sister. Her life experience was just as impressive as her cultivation.

She has seen this night sky so many times already but today might be her last time.

“Waited for a while?” Li Qiye sat down next to her, also looking up at the sky with both hands supporting his chin.

“I thought about leaving long ago but never made up my mind.” She glanced at him for a second before gazing upward again.

“There were things here that you couldn’t let go of.” He said.

It took a while before she responded: “Seems like I do have to let go eventually.”

“Moving forward has significant implications.” He said.

“That’s why I’ve been waiting all this time, until today.” She said softly.

“For the right person.” He smiled.

“Yes, for the right person.” She agreed.

For some unknown reason, she didn’t follow the bright star that was her brother - Blessed Dao Lord.

“There is something on your mind.” He stared at her black eyes.

“When I was very, very young, I met someone.” Her expression became serious after saying this.

“A resplendent figure.” Li Qiye already knew.

“My memory is hazy due to my age.” She tried to recall the scene and said: “It’s hard to describe that person but now, I know how to after seeing you.”

“Not part of this world.” He smiled.

“Yes, not part of this world.” She nodded and agreed.

“From where then?” Li Qiye pondered while looking at the stars.

She couldn’t answer because despite her fortunes, she knew that the gap was immense. Overcoming it was impossible.

“I remember something that was said.” She remarked.

“What?” Li Qiye became interested.

She tried to remember all the details of the meeting and then said: “The person rubbed my brother’s head and said, ‘little one, your talent is sorely inadequate, not even one-tenth in comparison.’”

“Interesting.” Li Qiye started thinking after hearing this.

Blessed could be considered one of the three greatest dao lords in Eight Desolaces. Everyone knew how gifted he was, especially in terms of cultivation talents.

Who would actually think that he was inadequate? However, what interested Li Qiye was the person he was being compared to.
