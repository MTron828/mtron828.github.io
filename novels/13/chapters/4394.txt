Chapter 4395: Omniscient Eye

“You’re too kind, Senior Brother. I’m only one step ahead right now. With time, your Tyrannical Dragon Spear will certainly surpass me.” She showed no sign of complacency.

“I don’t think so.” He shook his head then said: “However, this does not mean that you’ll win today.”

She wasn’t surprised and nodded: “I’m aware that you’ve cultivated the Omniscient Eye since youth. You have an innate gift allowing you to do so, this is your true ace card.”

“Omniscient Eye…” Many members of Dragon became emotional; some even gasped.

“Is that our legendary merit law?” One of them asked.

“Yes, it is a secret law of our sect created by none other than Myriad Eyes Dao Lord.” An older disciple answered with a solemn expression.

“A dao lord secret law!” The outsiders nearby found this horrifying since secret arts were one step above regular dao lord merit laws.

“I didn’t know he was cultivating a dao lord secret law.” A member of Dragon said.

“Yes, secret laws aren’t easily passed down. Few can cultivate them but he has the right physical structure and gift to do so.” The older disciple nodded.

The Omniscient Eye was a secret technique left behind by Myriad Eyes Dao Lord who came from Tiger Pond. The sect and Tiger Pond naturally kept this a secret. Even top disciples weren’t allowed access but Celestial Tiger was special.

He possessed a special bone in front of his chest with a divining affinity. Thus, he was groomed by Tiger Pond at a young age before being given the Omniscient Eye technique.

“There’s a reason his full title is Tyrant-eyed Celestial Tiger. It means that when his eye is activated, he’ll dominate the entire world.” A senior sister elaborated.

“Ah, I see.” The others finally understood.

“This secret dao lord technique is very effective, or so I’ve heard.” An outsider took a deep breath.

They haven’t seen this technique in action before, only having heard of its wondrous tales.

“This saves time if you already know, Junior Sister. Please prepare well and don’t blame me for using it.” Celestial Tiger shouted.

“I am ready.” Qingzhu commanded her twelve fate palaces to line up in front of her. They formed a separate domain with clouds, mountains, and rivers. It separated Qingzhu from the current dimension.

“Clank! Clank!” At the same time, she raised her saber and released countless feathers and sharp rays.

She erected two formidable barriers in just a split second. Moreover, she suddenly disappeared from sight.

“I see, Fate Palace Domain and Feather Saber Illusion.” Celestial Tiger recognized the techniques. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He then pulled down his robe and revealed his muscular frame brimming with energy. His skin suddenly cracked in a rather frightening manner.

“What the hell is this?” Many became startled after seeing the cracks.

Once the cracks opened fully, blue eyes could be seen. His upper half was completely covered in them.

“Pop!” His entire ribcage opened as well and a larger eye could be seen, as blue as the water in the ocean.

It was rather animated and always darting back and forth. Its gaze could steal the soul of his opponent.

“So that’s the Omniscient Eye?” The crowd found the largest eye to be rather creepy.

“How is this a bone? He has so many eyes.” An outsider shuddered.

“The other eyes are from cultivation, the one in the middle of his chest used to be a bone. It was then molded by the secret technique and became an eye.” An expert from Dragon explained.

“Don’t look at his eyes.” A top cultivator from a different sect warned his juniors.

The expert from Dragon shook her head: “It doesn’t matter whether you stare at them or not. It’s not coming through your vision, it is aiming directly at your true fate. Sealing all six senses won’t do either, the best way to deal with it is running.”

Having said that, she started retreating from the battlefield. Many others followed her advice and got out of the eyes’ area of effect.

“Pop!” The large eye moved ever so slightly and glimmered. This was enough to frighten the crowd.

“Omniscient Eye!” He roared and finally activated his technique. All of the eyes shot out bright rays towards Jian Qingzhu’s defenses.

“Boom!” The defense created by the fate palaces illuminated the entire region and overshadowed everything else. This included the incoming rays.

“Activate!” Celestial Tiger roared and caused the rays to explode like the death of stars.

“My god!” Although spectators have closed their eyes and sealed their senses, they were still affected by the eruption.

Several hundred cultivators were rendered unconscious and fell to the ground. Even ancestor-level beings felt their true fate being affected by the gaze. Fortunately, their cultivation was enough to prevent any negative effects.

“Boom!” The explosions destroyed the light created by the domain, leaving nothing left behind.

“Clank!” Next came the ocean of energies created by her saber. They intended to stop the explosions of light. Alas, they seemed rather feeble as well, just like cicada wings.

Jian Qingzhu was forced to show herself once more and the brightest ray struck her.
