Chapter 4786: Truth

No one has ever dared to think about sealing the high heaven before. Just having the ambition was difficult enough, let alone actually attempting.

“Does such a punch exist?” A near-death ancestor whispered.

“Sealing the high heaven…” An ancient existence thought about a legend from beyond their epoch. Something flashed in her head at this second.

She had heard about this old tale before - one that frightened numerous top cultivators.

“This is referring to the forbidden one.” A being from a power belonging to the previous epoch whispered with fear.

This was a taboo subject in two epochs now - a shadow engulfing the entire world and instilling dread into all.

This became doubly true after the great calamity. Those from the forbidden zones and old earths finally realized the significance of this being.

They were considered taboo existences by the world yet they considered this dark crow to be taboo, not wanting to whisper his name.

Most listeners had no idea what was going on but the old existences watched attentively, albeit with fear.

As for Tian Tu, his sole focus was on Li Qiye. Battle intent started surging from him.

“The fist is my life and its limit shall be my end as well.” Tian Tu said.

Others became impressed because it was hard to find someone with such a firm dao heart with a single dao.

Cultivators trained in order to become stronger and gain higher status and authority. Or, some did it in order to be invincible and they would pick different dao.

Tian Tu, on the other hand, focused on only the fist dao and dedicated his life for this goal. Few had a mentality of this level regarding cultivation.

As the first disciple of Blessed Dao Lord, he had access to the best merit laws and techniques. He could have aimed for the top position as well with all the authority a man could want. Alas, this was not his pursuit.

“His fist dao is virtually unbeatable.” Dao Sanqian himself murmured.

Thus, Tian Tu respectfully asked Li Qiye: “A punch that can seal the high heaven, please fulfill my wish, Sir.”

“First Brother’s best punch is known as Truth.” Specter Monarch put on a solemn expression.

He was one of the rare souls that knew how strong Tian Tu was. The rest of the world never had the privilege of watching him fight.

Though Specter was considered to be one of the ten most gifted disciples during Blessed Dao Lord’s generation, he was still not a match for Tian Tu. In fact, the latter might have the highest amount of raw talent out of anyone.

He was the most qualified to inherit Blessed Dao Lord’s legacy and become a dao lord himself. Alas, the only thing that interested him was improving his fist dao and other fist techniques.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In fact, True Immortal could face destruction and he still wouldn’t give a damn. On the other hand, the appearance of a great fist user could make him come out of isolated training.

He lived for the sake of reaching the limit of the fist dao - Specter understood this about his senior brother.

“Truth…” Dao Sanqian heard this and said: “A being above Worldraiser Dao Lord.”

He heard about a legend that even after Worldraiser earned his title and dominated the world, he still commented about his inferiority compared to his senior brother’s fist dao.

“Truth?” The crowd exchanged glances since they haven’t heard of this technique before. There were no other known users of this dao.

Few have seen Tian Tu use it. Even then, it wasn’t at full power either. This was the case for Specter Monarch.

When they dueled, he wasn’t strong enough to force his senior brother to go all-out. Perhaps only Blessed Dao Lord and Godfist had this privilege.

“Come, show me your Truth.” Li Qiye’s excitement burgeoned as well after being infected by Tian Tu’s determination.

“I made my first fist at one, mastered a fist dao at three, created my first one at six, read the fist scripture at eighteen, and sought invincibility at twenty with my perfected dao, Truth.” Tian Tu recalled his life before the challenge in a matter-of-fact manner.

Though no one has seen him in battle, they became emotional and believed him. Reaching the apex at only twenty years of age? This was an unparalleled achievement.

The ancient ancestors knew that the mentioned scripture was none other than the immortal scroll found in Worldbreaker. He was that strong already at eighteen? This exceeded the limit of imagination.

“Why didn’t he become a dao lord?” An ancient ancestor wondered.

Specter Monarch knew the answer to this question. His senior brother avoided all distractions - the only thing on his mind was waiting to see the legendary punch.

“Sir, please give me pointers.” Tian Tu slowly raised his hand while clenching it to make a fist, assuming an offensive stance.

Everyone thought that the movements would encompass loud explosions and lightning flashes. Winds and clouds would be chased away. However, none of these phenomena emerged.
