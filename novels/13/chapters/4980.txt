Chapter 4981: Mist Deity

This reminded her of the first time Li Qiye saw Goldcrest. He mentioned something about a secret and frightened Goldcrest.

This meant that Li Qiye already knew that the guy was from the ten mountains at the start. She chuckled wryly, thinking that nothing could elude Li Qiye’s eyes.

They were the only ones who didn’t know while Li Qiye understood everything from the start.

“He has a special badge.” Li Qiye revealed.

“Yes, you are right, Young Noble. I have a badge that has been handed down from generation to generation. It allows the user to temporarily leave the ten mountains. Of course, this can’t compare to Wild Dragon’s fortune and especially not Demon Conqueror in terms of length.”

By this point, Goldcrest was no longer surprised by Li Qiye’s devilish ability.

“I see.” Yunyun said: “Your cultivation is incredible right now, you became a dragon lord after leaving Abroad in just a short time.”

She was sure that he was not a dragon lord when they last met. However, maintaining that white-phoenix form required the power of a dragon lord.

“You’re too kind, Miss Jian.” Goldcrest was happy to hear the praises. However, he didn’t raise his tail and gloat: “This is just a matter of location. Our Phoenix City worships the tiger deity so after returning, this affinity boosts my cultivation. Once I leave, it will disappear.”

This is one of the reasons why Demon was so tempting. The power level here was not the same as those in the outside world due to the power of belief and worship.

For example, Goldcrest was only a sovereign in Abroad. Of course, this was enough to outmatch most in the young generation. However, he actually reached the realm of dragon lord in the Ten Great Mountains. This gave him enough power to actually fight Radiant Young Monarch.

“Why is there competition between those from the same deity branch?” She asked, unaware of the details in this place.

“It is a matter of belief. We share the same deity but aren’t in an alliance.” Goldcrest said: “Factions from different deity branches can become close allies while as you see here, war.”

“How interesting.” Yunyun said.

“May I ask why you two are here, Miss Jian and Young Noble Li?” Goldcrest became curious.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yunyun glanced at Li Qiye first before responding: “Our young noble is pursuing Shadowrider.”

“Shadowrider? That Shadowrider?!” Goldcrest couldn’t believe it.

The title alone scared everyone including big shots. Goldcrest was no exception and felt as if someone was gazing at him from the shadow.

“Young Noble?” Goldcrest didn’t understand. Everyone else wanted to stay away from Shadowrider but Li Qiye was pursuing this character?

“Shadowrider might have something to do with the disappearance of several top masters, hence our pursuit. We followed traces and believed that Demon might be the lair.”

“Impossible.” Goldcrest said because most believed that Shadowrider was a human - a member of an unknown assassin organization.

Nonetheless, he realized that nothing could hide from Li Qiye’s eyes and said: “Where in Demon then? Hmm, the highest possibility should be Mist.”

He then realized that he should keep his mouth shut and stopped speaking.

“Elaborate.” Li Qiye asked.

“Well… I shouldn’t really speak on the other deities.” He lowered his voice: “Plus, I don’t know much about them, Mist is rather mysterious. According to our late ancestor, Mist’s founder god was an outsider.”

“An outsider?” Yunyun found this surprising.

“Right, not from Demon.” Goldcrest smiled wryly.

“Then how did this person start a deity branch here?” Yunyun said, assuming that all six deity branches were started by demon gods.

“I’m not sure.” Goldcrest answered: “According to the legends, a sword user came and carved a deity spot on the Divine Beast Tablet, starting Mist henceforth.”

“It’s that simple?” She asked.

“Miss Jian, you may not know that the tablet is the source of Demon, a piece that has fallen off the nest of the great Demon God. It is the reason why the creatures here have an easy time communicating with the dao. Only special demons can establish a branch on the tablet.”

Having said that, he lowered his voice and said: “It’s not a simple process. Eight-stallion Dao Lord is also a demon. He tried to carve a deity branch on the tablet, only to fail.”

Yunyun understood the significance of the tablet after hearing this. Eight-stallion Dao Lord was only second to Conceal Conqueror in the lower continents.

Alas, this demon wasn’t enough to establish a deity spot, unlike the mysterious sword user.

“So is this sword user a human or a demon?” She became curious.

“I don’t know, maybe the other founder gods know. The only thing known to all is that Mist God was an outsider.” Goldcrest shook his head.
