Chapter 5497: Gift

The emperor naturally understood that if he had continued to live reclusively, his world-weary dao could have continued to progress. He hated life but even death didn’t want him.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Now, Li Qiye’s plan gave him a chance to sever the previous karmic cycle, granting him hope for the next journey.

“My crow, no one in this world can compare to you.” He sighed with admiration: “And who else loves this world as much as you?”

“Told you I was compassionate and kind to all.” Li Qiye responded.

“You love the world for your own sake.” He took down Li Qiye’s attempt at self-aggrandizement.

“That’s fine, am I not part of this world too?” Li Qiye said softly.

“...” He sighed and agreed: “True. How do you want me to repay you then?”

“Don’t talk to me like I’m a greedy merchant.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I understand. Fine, I’ll go.” He nodded.

“And that is all that I need.” Li Qiye happily patted the guy’s shoulder for who knows how many times already and said: “Let us go big and have fun with this villainous heaven.”

“I do not know how to proceed.” He said.

“Don’t worry, this is your idea, it saves me a lot of time.” Li Qiye said.

“My idea?” He didn’t understand.

“Spying on the heaven. I just need to activate this dao for a bit, that’s all.”

“Heavenseer!” He blurted out.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye’s hand became resplendent. All of the surrounding space was turning into a gigantic drop of water containing the reflections of three thousand worlds.

“Pop!” He reached into the drop of water and infiltrated a particular treasury.

“Who?!” A supreme existence with an unimaginable aura stood up after sensing the intruder.

However, Li Qiye grabbed a yellow piece of paper and immediately pulled back. It was too late for the existence to do anything about the thief.

Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo was all too familiar with this piece of paper. He had given it to Li Qiye before, hoping that the guy would pass it down to someone else. Now, it has returned to him.

“Here we are, cause and effect.” Li Qiye said: “You once took pride in your ability to seer the heaven, now it shall deliver you up there.”

“How?” He asked.

“Since you’re dead, please act like a corpse and lay back down in this foul liquid.” Li Qiye smirked.

He smiled wryly and lay back down in the puddle.

“Activate!” Li Qiye grasped the myriad laws and refined the grand dao while pushing the yellow paper together with his palms.

A grand dao in the paper erupted, seemingly being granted life by Li Qiye. He rolled it up into a roll and thrust it into the hole in the emperor’s chest.

Li Qiye roared and activated his grand dao, channeling primordial energy and causing the fabrics of reality to bend.

“Boom!” A devastating pulse emanated from the paper and shot to the sky, capable of seeing the deepest crevices of heaven. After a few seconds, It transformed into an all-seeing maelstrom.

In this split second, the world shook violently and alarmed all living beings. Thunder could be heard and an expanse of light started forming in the sky. However, no tribulation descended just yet.

“Heaven, here’s a token of my love for you!” Li Qiye laughed and shouted at the sky.

His supreme grand dao started pulling all of the emperor’s aura of hatred before sending it through the maelstrom.

“Rumble!” Lighting and flames from the tribulation descended in retaliation. Even sharp golden bolts aimed at Li Qiye.

The high heaven was furious and finally sent down an unprecedented tribulation. Li Qiye was fully surrounded by massive arcs of lighting. Bolts detonated around him but he didn’t have an issue at all.

He took a deep breath, looking rather comfortable: “Nice, now I can wash off this stench with a lightning bath.”

He reached into the endless lightning expanse, seemingly looking for something. That only caused the high heaven to deliver its apocalyptic wrath.

“What is going on?!” Top cultivators were in shambles since they had never seen such terrifying tribulations before. The entire six continents were being illuminated by the lightning expanses.
