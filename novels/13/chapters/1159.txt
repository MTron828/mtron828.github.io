Chapter 1160: Ye Xiaoxiao

The lord smiled and sincerely replied: “It’s just as you say, love requires time. You haven’t met my daughter, so how do you know that she won’t agree?”

“You are indeed worthy of being the lord of the isle, you’re already laying a trap with just a few words.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh. Without a doubt, this lord was a smart one.

The isle lord smiled in response: “We’ll decide it like this. Nephew can keep on thinking about it carefully. If you haven’t made up your mind, then it is fine to stay here for a bit. Our doors will always be open for you, just treat our isle as your own home.”

“Thank you for showing such love.” Li Qiye smiled and nodded his head.

This lord was an open-minded person. There was no conflict of interest between the two of them right now, so Li Qiye accepted the lord’s attempt at winning him over.

As the lord made it to the door, he suddenly turned back and asked: “I almost forgot to ask, may I know who your master is?”

Li Qiye freely replied: “I am only a vagrant cultivator and the oceans are my home, it’s not worth mentioning.”

The lord didn’t inquire further. He only laughed and said: “Then I hope you can get used to this place. If you need anything, just let my disciples know.” He left after saying this.

He wouldn’t be too inquisitive after Li Qiye showed his unwillingness to speak about his origin. For Golden Isle, if this person came from a lineage in the Heaven Spirit World, it was definitely within their abilities to find out.

Li Qiye sealed his surrounding space once more after the lord left. He sat cross-legged to meditate. Even though his internal injuries were very serious, they were recovered in a short amount of time due to the Heaven Restoration Salve.

At this moment, his injuries were not a problem. The only issue was the unsolved Life Origination that was severely suppressing his blood energy.

Of course, he was not in a rush to solve this either. After all, such an item didn’t come easily. The process required time and the water of life to slowly dilute the drop of water.

He instead focused on the Space Scripture and its fundamentals. Although he had grasped its mysteries quite well at this moment, there was still a long way to go before he could use it at will. To do so, he would need to master its profundities.

There were four parts to the scripture, or four major chapters: World Creation, Space Control, Parallelism, and Cryptic Space.

Among these four chapters, World Creation was the most important and incredible. It was the most essential part of the scripture.

World Creation was not referring to creating new worlds and existences; the Space Scripture had not reached that level. After all, that was beyond the boundary of cultivation. Life creation was something left to the heavens alone.

To be precise, World Creation was about opening up space. The truth was that after reaching a particular realm, all cultivators could do such a thing. Godkings and Immortal Emperors were able to open larger spaces. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, the World Creation from the Space Scripture was different from these other methods. A space opened by an Immortal Emperor was different as well.

Once a user of World Creation reached the peak, even spaces opened by Immortal Emperors would seem much lesser in comparison.

World Creation was an arduous process, but if cultivated fully, then a new world would appear, a spatial realm on the same level as an entire world.

This level of space could accept everything, including any existence, item, and force. It was similar to creation like the start of the heaven and earth, the nine worlds. Because it had a spatial structure, the nine worlds were able to have sentient beings.

Thus, this was almost the opening of a world. With a successful opening, new life would one day be born. From then on, it would no longer be the nine worlds but ten. At that time, Li Qiye would become its supreme ruler. Of course, it was not something that could be done in a day or two.

The other three major chapters of the Space Scripture had their own characteristics and usages as well. Among them, Space Control encompassed the most content. For example, portal summoning, teleportation, banishment, space correction, deep space, displaced space, visual phenomenon space... all of this was part of the Space Control chapter.

Golden Isle treated Li Qiye with an incomparably warm hospitality as if he was the most esteemed guest they had ever received. This made his recovery very comfortable.

However, before two days passed, trouble had found his door. Early in the morning while he was cultivating in this room, someone shouting could be heard from the outside.

“Li Qiye, roll out here for this lady!” Despite the high volume, the voice was very sweet and pleasant. There was an indescribable charm and youthfulness to it.

Li Qiye stood up and left his room to find a girl standing in the living room, a very young girl to be exact.

The lass looked to be around thirteen years old. She grew up quite well and had a complexion as white as jade. Her spirited eyes were round and big in a fulfilling manner. Her small nose was sculpted without fault while her cherry mouth was as red as fire.

She stood with both hands on her waist while proudly arching her chest forward. This posture slightly revealed the valley and figure beneath the embroidered dress.

This little lass was truly lovely and cute; others couldn’t help but like her. Of course, her demeanor and posturing showed off her hot and strong personality.

Moreover, she was barefoot. The moment her small and exquisite feet fell into sight, everyone would be in awe for it was a perfect masterpiece made by the heavens. The crystal white feet had perfect proportions; a bit more would be too fat while a bit less would be too thin.

Flowers blossomed and fresh grass would spring up wherever she walked. It was as if she was walking on a field of flowers.

Her blood energy was still hidden, and the same could be said for her dao. It showed that she was not using any merit laws or techniques, yet lush vegetation was still appearing. This meant that she had an innate ability not found in others. This was a type of special constitution or unique bloodline.

Li Qiye glanced at her and the field below her. His eyes slightly narrowed before he revealed a smile: “I am Li Qiye, who might you be?”

“Ye Xiaoxiao.” She maintained her aggressive appearance while glaring at him.

“I don’t know you.” Li Qiye smiled and gently shook his head.

The lass was unhappy with this response. She replied in a fiery manner: “This lady is the princess of Golden Isle, the woman that you will marry!”

“Er—” Li Qiye smiled wryly. Other girls would be too bashful to say such words, but this Ye Xiaoxiao blurted them out without a problem.

He cupped his fists and said: “Oh, so it is Princess Ye. Long time no see, long time no see, I didn’t expect Princess to come.” [1. Something people say between friends. Li Qiye is being sarcastic right now by acting all familiar.]

“Long time no see my ass.” Ye Xiaoxiao stated with disdain: “You didn’t even know who I was earlier. Stop your act right now.”

Li Qiye laughed amusingly after seeing her fiery attitude. This little girl was very interesting. He readily accepted being exposed and leisurely replied with a grin: “Okay, I was messing about saying long time no see. After all, I’ve never even heard of your name prior to this.”

“You...” She was stumped for a moment and couldn’t come up with a response. She came with an imposing attitude to yell at him, so she expected him to arrogantly yell back at her so that she could kick him out of Golden Isle.

Either that or he would be suppressed by her aggression and become submissive. Thus, she would also kick such a submissive nobody out of Golden Isle.

She didn’t expect him to not act arrogantly or submissively.
