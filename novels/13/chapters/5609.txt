Chapter 5610: Thousand Emperor Island

Everyone on the immortal continent had heard of Imperial Field - the third power comparable to Celestial Court and Immortal Dao City.0

It didn’t operate as a sect but rather as a loose alliance. Its formation could be traced back to the empress.1

The world only knew of them after Grand Dao War but in reality, it had been in the works for a long period before that. They gained more recruits afterward.0

Rumor has it that this alliance has been around during the previous epoch. The empress - its primary founder - was an elusive existence.24

She never appeared despite The People’s existential crisis during Immemorial Epoch or Skysplitter War.0

Because of this, her fame couldn’t compare to Purewood Divine Emperor, Immortal Emperor Fei Yang, Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan, and many others.0

However, when the ancestral bone fell from the sky and the darkness came, the empress appeared with her allies - Skyshroud Emperor, Blade Immortals, Immortal Assailant Emperor, and more female cultivators.10

They created a defensive zone known as High Heaven Aegis to support the empress and Lunargrasp Immortal Monarch during their fight.4

Although this war didn’t last as long as Immemorial Epoch or Skysplitter, emperors and gods suffered devastating casualties.0

In the end, the empress and her allies came out victoriously against the darkness and descended back to High Heaven Aegis. From then on, no one saw them again.0

Rumor has it that most have died during the battle or still suffered grievous injuries, waiting for recovery.0

Nonetheless, more powerful cultivators of the imperial level joined Imperial Field afterward. The current leader was none other than Demon Conqueror.0

The loose structure and hierarchy didn’t mean that they weren’t united. Members were always ready to help each other.0

The powerful organization stood equal to Celestial Court and Immortal Dao City. With the closing of Immortal Dao City, everyone placed their hope in Imperial Field - the only thing capable of resisting Celestial Court.0

Some called this area Imperial Ocean instead due to its aquatic terrains comprising countless islands and continents. They were inhabited by both mortals and cultivators, both weak and strong alike.0

Emperors and their peers resided in seclusion on some islands while others preferred to spread the dao. Some ventured into the endless sea,  their whereabouts unknown.1

On any random island, one could find a fisherman who could be a mortal or an unbeatable emperor.0

The best way to find someone in Imperial Field was to head for Thousand Emperor Island. Thus, this was Li Qiye and Niu Fen’s first stop.0

Niu Fen wanted to find an old friend. Their relationship must be close to warrant him going out of his way for a meeting.0

Upon stepping onto the island, they saw showers of divine light. First-timers would certainly be captivated and astonished by this dreamlike place.0

The islands themselves were magnificent with grand mountains and rivers. However, the visual phenomena above were out of this world.0

Deep in space were ancient cities - seemingly the home of immortals. Another consisted of white sandy beaches or an azure expanse. Torrential storms could be seen along with peculiar rock formations…1

Those familiar with Thousand Emperor Island understood they were not mere illusions but gateways. The phenomena were mere glimpses of the realms beyond.0

The gateways could lead to dangerous locations, paradises, or cities filled with inhabitants. One could go anywhere starting from Thousand Emperor Island.0

Because of this, the island was known to be one of the most magical places on the six continents.0

Some believed that the gateways were built specifically for Grand Dao War, allowing fast access to any battle site in Imperial Field.0

“I am in awe every time, it’s so beautiful.” Niu Fen said.0

“Connecting all of them is a remarkable idea.” Li Qiye had a smile while looking at the diverse phenomena.0

“We can go anywhere from here except certain battlefields and High Heaven Aegis.” Niu Fen said.0

“High Heaven Aegis.” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed.5

“That realm is a secret now after Grand Dao. No one knows its exact location, only that it is somewhere in Imperial Field.” Niu Fen shrugged.0

Having said that, he lowered his voice: “Young Master, I just happen to be someone who knows where it is, one of the selected few, haha.”0𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Is this something to brag about? You just happened to be in the right place at the right time.” Li Qiye playfully smacked him.0

“Hehe, I owe it to you, Young Master.” Niu Fen laughed: “Someone did let me know back then but I didn’t want to bother people. I couldn’t help a lot either during Grand Dao War. South Emperor, Immortal Emperor Chi Ye, and Immortal Emperor Mu Tian did most of the work, focusing on the border and stopping the Celestial Court’s armies.”3

“I can imagine.” Li Qiye gazed into the distance and said.0

Niu Fen took a deep breath and said: “Corpses of emperors and monarchs rained down like dumplings and their blood stained the ocean red.”
