Chapter 5205: Cleansing Incense Dynasty

Li Zhitian was awfully excited to see the door opening, thinking that he would be able to see the master of the courtyard.

He didn’t expect to see someone so average like Li Qiye. However, the bear and the old man were clearly his followers.

He could see the power of the bear; why would such a powerful creature act like a pet? As for the old man, this person remained elusive but most likely stronger than him. In that case, his master must be even more frightening.

Therefore, it was strange because he could tell that Li Qiye’s cultivation was just average - completely insignificant when compared to his own.

This made him more curious because he hasn’t seen anyone like Li Qiye, whether it be in the upper continents or the immortal continent. The apex conquerors and emperors were nothing like him.

“Just a dead man, no point seeing him.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“...” He didn’t know how to respond and glanced at the courtyard again. There was no sign of death energy.

He assumed that Li Qiye merely joked and smiled wryly: “The phenomena were amazing.”

“There are many amazing things in this world.” Li Qiye responded.

He bowed slightly and asked: “I’ve just arrived and am unfamiliar with Imperial Attendant. Would you like to have a drink and chat about the people and customs of this city?”

“I’m just a passerby as well, just as unfamiliar as yourself.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I see.” He knew how to react accordingly so he bowed again and said: “I apologize for the impolite intrusion.”

“I’m sure Imperial Clan and Crimson Emperor are happy to have a descendant like you.” Li Qiye said.

“Do you know my ancestor?” He became startled.

“Who doesn’t know the Grand Emperor with twelve wills?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I am only a firefly compared to his greatness.” He humbly responded.

However, he stopped there because Crimson Emperor was a general against The People. It would be rude to praise Crimson Emperor when speaking to a member of The People.

“Knowing oneself is a commendable virtue.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I will take my leave now, Dao Brother. If you have free time in the future, I would like to invite you for a drink, it would be my honor.” He asked again.

“Of course.” Li Qiye glanced at the youth again and agreed.

“Boom!” At this time, another beam rushed to the sky and illuminated the two continents. No one could resist feeling a sense of awe while thinking that a supreme existence was appearing.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Pop!” A rune flew out of the beam and instantly imprinted itself onto one of the thrones.

“Azure Peak!” Everyone recognized the new rune.

“Azure Ancestor is returning as well?” Everyone shuddered after seeing this.

“Azure Ancestor!” Li Zhitian became startled as well.

The great ancestor created this power as a home for the sky spirits. No one dared to refuse when she took over this territory. Both The Race and The People were not allowed to enter.

It survived numerous great wars - a testament to her power. However, it has been silent for a long time until this auction. Was this a sign of its return?

“Clank!” People didn’t have time to think before they heard a loud clank.

A murderous strand of energy manifested into reality and frightened everyone. They felt as if their forehead had just been pierced.

This energy crossed through the world and pinned one of the thrones, causing all the top cultivators to become serious.

“Cleansing Incense Dynasty.” A dragon lord took a deep breath.

“Why now? Will it ask for Imperial Alliance’s authority back?” A big shot murmured.

Cleansing Incense was a title capable of making others tremble.

Azure School was an impressive sect but it was only a newly-risen star compared to Cleansing Incense.

It was unstoppable during Grand Dao and Imperial War. The legendary spear known as Emperor’s Demise put an end to numerous emperors and monarchs from The Race. Though Celestial Court was unbeatable during that period, Cleansing Incense didn’t relent for a second.

Since it suffered grievous losses during Grand Dao War, Heaven and Divine Alliance were able to breathe. Nonetheless, its prestige still remained today.

“I don’t have a problem with Cleansing Incense taking over Imperial Alliance again. After all, Genesis Conqueror founded Imperial Alliance.” An ancient ancestor said.

Genesis Conqueror was a special existence for diverging the path of cultivation. At first, everyone knew that conquerors could and should aim for twelve dao fruits.

This was no longer the case afterward since she showed that even just one fruit was enough to reach the truths of anima.

Of course, exceptions existed before this due to those possessing one primordial dao fruit. She pioneered a path allowing regular dao fruits to obtain anima as well.

Because of this, others gave her the title of “Genesis”.

“I don’t know.” A big shot from Imperial Alliance said: “I don’t think Cleansing Incense Dynasty will try. If it cared about authority, it would have done this long ago. This is most likely due to one of the treasures.”
