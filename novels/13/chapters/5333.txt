Chapter 5334: I’ll Be Back!

“Seniors, why are you doing this?” Zhitian couldn’t help but ask.

“Waterwalk and I come from The People, Godmist and Greenvine are part of The Race. We’ll leave our life to the heaven and see who is lucky.” Goldsheep said.

“...” Zhitian didn’t know what to say, thinking that these four might have been too bored and leisurely.

“Whhshh.” Godmist whistled and the waves surged even more. This was due to a massive creature splitting the sea part.

Everyone looked over and saw a ferocious fish with bone spurs gleaming like metal. Its tail and two fins were sharp like blades.

“Rumble!” Loud noises came from the creature’s mouth. It had countless teeth that were always moving and grinding, capable of crushing anything unlucky enough to fall in.

“Devil-gear Whale!” Zhitian immediately recognized this legendary fish right away.

It was immensely rare and could devour dragon lords and conquerors. However, this whale seemed to be familiar with the group and floated above the surface with its mouth open, ready for someone to jump in.

Greenvine drew a white line in the middle and took out a weathercock as well.

Greenvine and Godmist then stood on one side of the white line with Goldsheep and Waterwalk standing opposite of them.

“We did it ourselves before but we have guests now. Brat, sorry for the trouble but place it in the middle when the wind starts in a bit.” Greenvine handed the weathercock to Zhitian.

“Me?” Zhitian became anxious. This meant that the lives of these four conquerors were in his hand now.

“Don’t be in a hurry to die, I have a question regarding a statue.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Talking about that Heaven’s Allure statue? I sold it to Duality Shop.” Goldsheep laughed.

“Where did it come from?” Li Qiye asked.

“That bastard Timewatcher.” Goldsheep answered.

“Timewatcher Conqueror.” Zhitian murmured the title of a famous conqueror who enjoyed fighting and feared no one.

“Sigh, don’t bring him up anymore. We had a great time before and he even participated in our life bets but after seeing Heaven’s Allure, he stopped hanging out with us.” Godmist shook his head: “He used to brag about his romantic exploits back then but now, he’s completely lost his mind.” Godmist shook his head.

“I looked for him a long time back, wanting him to join the bet again but he kept on avoiding me, didn’t even open the gate. That annoyed me so I stole this statue from his home and sold it to Duality Shop.” Goldsheep revealed.

Zhitian and the others exchanged glances, thinking that these conquerors were rather interesting.

“Where is Timewatcher now?” The old servant asked in Li Qiye’s stead.

“Don’t worry, we are close to Timewatcher. Although we want to kill each other, we are still good friends. Once the bet is finished, the survivors will bring you to him.” Greenvine said.

“I don’t know if he will meet you guys since he only cares about these statues now.” Goldsheep said.

“That’s fine, just bring me to him. It won’t be up to him then.” Li Qiye said.

“Good. Brat, the winds are blowing, place it in the very center.” Greenvine looked up and told Zhitian.

The nervous Zhitian listened and placed the weathercock in the center.

“Whoosh!” The winds started blowing and changed the weathercock’s arrow direction.

Eventually, it stopped and the weathercock pointed in the direction of Goldsheep and Waterwalk Conqueror.

“Hahaha! Not so lucky this time, go die now.” Godmist Conqueror laughed after seeing this.

“Sigh, we’ve won three rounds before, why not another?” Goldsheep sighed frustratingly.

“It’s fine, we already won three, it’s not a big loss.” Waterwalk said.

“This is how you do a life bet?” Zhitian didn’t know what to say.

“Isn’t this preferable to fighting to the death?” Goldsheep said.

Zhitian wondered if this was true - four powerful conquerors with incredible abilities leaving it up to the wind instead of utilizing their cultivation.

They could have made the contest more interesting by actively changing the winds but they didn’t do so either.

Not to mention a prestigious conqueror, even regular people wouldn’t treat their life so trivially.

“Okay, I’ll go first. You’re in for a tough time with us gone, gonna have no one to play with.” Waterwalk laughed and said.

“Please, watching you two suffer brings us more joy than anything.” Greenvine responded.

“Suffering can be rather interesting at times, I’m about to die from these boring days anyway.” Waterwalk laughed.

“Old whale, I’m coming!” He leaped forward and landed inside the whale’s jaws.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” He didn’t try to stop the gear-like teeth from grinding on his body.

Nonetheless, it felt as if they were grinding an unbreakable block of metal. After all, he was still an invincible conqueror.

“Oh my god! This hurts so much, Godmist didn’t put on an act at all!” Flesh and blood sprayed as his body was ground to pieces.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zhitian and True Bear felt their heart pounding in shock while witnessing the suicidal act. The pain must be intolerable because he couldn’t die that easily given his physical prowess.

“Ahhh!” Eventually, even his dao fruits were crushed.

“I’ll be back!” They turned into dao particles and flew toward the horizon.
