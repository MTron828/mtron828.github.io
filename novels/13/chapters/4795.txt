Chapter 4796: Banishment

Immortal Lake was such a lineage, still threatening those who knew of it in recent years.

Its peers included Divine Ridge and Timeworn. These were the relatively well-known ones. There were more frightening powers slumbering in these lands.

Some believed that they were awaiting something. This could be more than just one epoch. The world simply didn’t know more information about this wait. Nonetheless, top masters have tried to figure this out before.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

These cultivators communicated these secrets among the upper echelon. Thus, regular cultivators didn’t have access to this information.

Specter and Six-dao were strong and prestigious enough to be involved in this matter. All in all, the dao lords and the sages speculated that their awakening would absolutely spell bad news for Eight Desolaces.

Absolute destruction and absorption were possible outcomes. Of course, maybe when the awaited time was here, it would be a different epoch completely instead of Eight Desolaces.

Therefore, Specter and Six-dao found this rather ominous. Nonetheless, they weren’t afraid of trouble and were ready to fight.

Meanwhile, some ancient cultivators became startled. They knew how strong Immortal Lake was since it was rumored to have an immortal corpse.

They were also impressed with True Immortal for not backing down, feeling proud that Eight Desolaces’ number one sect was standing up against these behemoths.

They thought that this could still be competitive. After all, True Immortal had Lin Mo and Tian Tu. If they were to go all out, they might actually win.

“Monarch, you are mistaken. I do not wish to interfere with your internal matters, I simply feel bad for your disciple who had impressive contribution yet is treated like a stepchild like now.” The being inside the coffin was addressed as Gu Yin by Six-dao.

Some actually agreed with him. Cosmic Lord has done great things for True Immortal and even Eight Desolaces. It seemed as if he was on the verge of being abandoned and punished.

“Hmph.” Six-dao scowled, not intimidated at all. Specter had a cold expression as well.

Spectators watched with bated breath. A fight between True Immortal and Immortal Lake would be one for the ages.

Lin Mo waved her hand to calm them down. She calmly spoke: “If Immortal Lake wishes to interfere with our business, I suppose I need to pay your sect a visit. Is this your decision or Immortal Lord’s will?”

Her tone was cordial and reasonable yet older cultivators became emotional afterward.

“Immortal Lord, is that the dead immortal in the legends?” An eternal existence shuddered.

Only these old beings knew about this figure that had several titles - Immortal Lord or an older title, Dead Immortal.

This was a supreme overlord feared by all. The current monarchs in Eight Desolaces didn’t necessarily have the courage to face this legendary being. However, Lin Mo dared to do so.

Gu Yin couldn’t answer. He could speak to Six-dao on the same level but Lin Mo was different. Plus, he didn’t have the authority to make decisions for Dead Immortal.

“I found this unfair, that’s all.” He finally answered.

Everyone could tell that he had acquiesced and didn’t want to go against Lin Mo. This being from Immortal Lake didn’t seem to be afraid of Six-dao or even Specter. However, this unknown woman forced him to back down.

“See, this is the True Immortal we know. They have incredible ace cards.” A divine monarch gained a new perspective on True Immortal’s might.

Lin Mo ignored Gu Yin and stared at Cosmic Lord who lowered his head.

“You wish to stay?” She asked.

“This disciple will stay.” He took a deep breath and said.

“So be it. From today henceforth, you will no longer be a disciple of True Immortal. Out of consideration for your grand achievements and contributions, I shall allow you to be free and keep your cultivation.” Lin Mo announced.

Top cultivators trembled after hearing this. Cosmic Lord has just been banished from his sect. He toiled his entire life for True Immortal and now, he chose a course leading to humiliation.

“Don’t be silly!” Six-dao Monarch shouted, wanting to keep him in the sect.
