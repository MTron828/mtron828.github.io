Chapter 5768: I Allow This Birth

“Boom!” The blood flames went on the counteroffensive, intending to drown out the primordial tree within Ling’er.

The explosions obliterated the host but she couldn’t die. The primordial body in conjunction with Li Qiye’s laws prevented the flames from spreading and burned them to nothingness.

However, even a single strand could multiply and blot out the sky in a split second - no different from a spider laying countless eggs, and then her offspring could do the same without any waiting period.

This type of life could consume everything with its spread. Thus, it was not allowed in the outside world.

It reached a level where if Ling’er were still allowed to create copies, her copies would be consumed as well. This force was enough to herald an apocalypse.

The struggle continued - Li Qiye aiming to extinguish the blood flames while they tried to burn the internal primordial tree to break free.

Her body worked against the blood flames, aiding the primordial tree to burn everything within. Li Qiye’s absolute suppression was unstoppable and stability came next.

With the last blood flame gone, her body stabilized and wielded a unique life force.

She seemed to be a newborn - a creation in the boundless primordial chaos. Karmic ties of the past have been severed. The sin of her existence all but disappeared.

A brand new life - devoid of any original sin and ominous cycles - belonged to Ling’er. However, only the high heaven was allowed to create life out of nothing.

A series of crackles came from above - a gateway appeared in the sky with an ocean of tribulation lightning behind it. Massive bolts and flames resembling dragons could be seen roaring.

The first wave immediately descended for Ling’er for she was not allowed to exist.

“Finally here.” Li Qiye laughed and said: “Villainous heaven, I allow this birth, it’s not up to you!”

“Boom!” He stepped forward, blocking the torrents of flames and lightning bolts.

This infuriated the villainous heaven and now, the gateway expanded to the rest of the world, allowing tribulations to descend from all directions.

Ling’er’s previous origin and sin no longer mattered; she was a new pure lifeform without an actual source.

When Li Qiye severed her ominous and sinful nature, he created a new her from the primordial chaos - an indirect way of life creation. How could the high heaven allow such a thing?

Space and time ceased to exist as the expanse was reduced to its original form. Emperors and monarchs couldn’t have lasted a second but Li Qiye raised both hands, preparing to resist.

“Rumble!” The wrathful bolts and flames failed to break his primordial barrier - the defensive manifestation of his eternal and indestructible dao heart.

Alas, the initially dimmed star on Ling’er’s chest started cracking, on the verge of falling off her. The moment of separation would spell the end of the star.

Li Qiye’s star panicked and lunged forward. The cloud tried to stop it but couldn’t.

“Bang!” The two stars collided right before the shattering. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Starlights flickered and collapsed inward into her body. The broken star was pushed deeper within, fully merging with her.

“Break!” Meanwhile, Li Qiye channeled more power and cleaved with his hand, releasing a primordial arc of light spanning across the ages.

This brought an end to everything, extinguishing the ocean of tribulation. The sky began to clear up afterward.
