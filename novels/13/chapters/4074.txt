Chapter 4075: Army Incoming

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Ooo-” Command horns echoed like the roars of dragons and tigers. A flood of steel hurriedly gathered by Armament Mountain, accompanied by an awe-inspiring battle intent.

“Armament Mountain’s horns.” The sects in the vicinity became startled.

“Ooo-” Armament Mountain seemed to be summoning its disciples.

“Is war starting?” Sect masters and elders wondered because the horns wouldn’t stop.

Regardless of the reason, they all knew that a big event was happening. Nonetheless, there were no external enemies, at least to their knowledge.

“I heard Li Qiye killed some of their members.” It didn’t take long before this message reached the majority.

“The richest guy?” A sect master became surprised after receiving this news.

“Hmm, aren’t they going overboard with this response?” A different sect master murmured.

Conflicts happened regularly and deaths weren’t uncommon. Armament Mountain had plenty of disciples so losing a few didn’t warrant blowing the horns of war.

“No, Li Qiye bought the Tang’s plain and I think there’s a treasury there. He messed with the wrong beehive.” Someone gathered information quickly and found out the reason.

“Does he want to start a sect?” A big shot wondered.

The richest man in the world could certainly buy influence and manpower. This could negatively affect Armament Mountain and lessen its authority.

Thus, Armament Mountain couldn’t just sit idly and watch. This was before mentioning the potential treasury.

Meanwhile, those right outside the plain were just as alarmed as anyone else after hearing the horns.

“Are they coming to fight Li Qiye?” Someone took a deep breath.

“They might be coming to take the plain back, can’t let someone else sleep in their bed.” A big shot saw things clearly.

Others agreed with this. First, the plain was just too close to Armament Mountain. They didn’t appreciate having an outsider in charge so near to their land. Moreover, this outsider killed their members as well.

“Rumble!” A mini dust storm formed on the horizon - the result of a horde of cavalries and carriages. Banners fluttered in the air and made spectacles tremble.

“Looks like Armament Mountain isn’t holding back against Li Qiye. This is going to be serious.” A spectator standing outside the plain commented.

On top of the carriages were disciples of Armament. They possessed impressive chaos energy and vitality. All had a stern expression.

Moreover, they didn’t contain their aura at all. Thus, this flood-like wave looked eager to drown out the plain.

Eight-armed Prince personally led this cavalry. He wore a crest and full armor. Each of his hands held a different awe-inspiring treasure - pagoda, cauldron… The energy ring stemming from him could prop up the sky itself.

Spectators couldn’t help but be impressed by his awe-inspiring presence.

“The prince is here in person?” Others found this surprising.

“Not just that, he’s bringing all eight treasures for the famous merit law. A great battle is inevitable.” An older expert took a closer look and said.

Eight Treasures Splitting The Heaven was a top technique created by God Ape Dao Lord. The prince already had them ready before the start of the fight. He seemed hellbent on taking down the opponent.

“Li Qiye, come out here and surrender!” The prince shouted in a domineering fashion.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s why he’s one of the Four Weapon Heroes, Armament Mountain will prosper once he takes over.” Someone else said.

“No youth can compete with him right now, he’ll definitely become the next sect master.” Another said.

The surrounding sects approved of Eight-armed Prince, wanting him to be the next leader of Armament Mountain.

“Why is there a fly buzzing so early in the morning?” Li Qiye lazily answered the challenge.

He walked out of the courtyard, seemingly having just woken up. His eyes were still drowsy as he gazed at the situation ahead. He didn’t look like he was giving a damn about the elite army led by Eight-armed Prince in the slightest.

The members of the army were furious. They had never experienced this level of contempt within their territory before.

“I demand an explanation for your murders!” The prince was furious just like the rest. He expected Li Qiye to be trembling with fear but the opposite occurred.

Such contempt was a clear challenge to Armament Mountain’s authority - something unforgivable.

“As I’ve said, trespassers will be killed. Why act so surprised?” Li Qiye responded.

“You!” The entire army glared at Li Qiye, wanting to cut him to pieces.
