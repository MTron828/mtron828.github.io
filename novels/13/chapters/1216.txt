Chapter 1217: One Massacring One Million

With that, Li Qiye glared at the Teeming Tribemaster and grinned: “Only an inept bunch boasting about how vicious you are every day. How domineering and aggressive, but ultimately, you’re still a bunch of turtles hiding in their shells.”

Such contempt left the spectators slack-jawed. No one had ever thought that they would hear this level of blatant disdain towards the Teeming Fish. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, some secretly applauded him, especially those who had been bullied by this tribe before. They felt especially happy since his words resonated with their own thoughts.

As a matter of fact, many knew that the Teeming Fish knew to pick their opponents very well. They weren’t ferocious to just anyone. For example, great hegemons like the Golden Isle, the Void Imperfection Three Schools, and Gu Chun’s Four Branches weren’t provoked by the Teeming Fish. Otherwise, they would have been slaughtered by the Immortal Emperors, treefathers and sea demons countless times.

As for the other sects, they weren’t strong enough to kill all of the fish so more often than not, they would suffer losses to these fish without voicing their displeasure.

“He’s right. Hmph! Rumor has it that the grand completion Immortal Physique users of Gu Chun’s Four Branches loved to eat dragon tendons, but no one has heard of the Teeming Fish attacking the four branches for revenge.” Someone couldn’t help say this out of dissatisfaction towards the Teeming Tribe.

His senior was frightened and immediately covered his mouth. He slapped him and stated: “Are you tired of living? Even if you are, don’t drag the sect into this.”

Li Qiye’s words darkened the tribemaster’s old face. He felt like his chest would explode from anger as he trembled.

The million fish in the sea had fire in their eyes while glaring at Li Qiye. If glares could kill, then Li Qiye would have died countless times already.

A Teeming Fish angrily shouted: “Tribemaster, let us tear this little animal to pieces so our brothers can eat his flesh, drink his blood and chew his bones!”

“Yes! Let us eat his flesh, drink his blood and chew his bones!” The other fish immediately echoed the sentiment. Their furious roars soared to the sky and shook the sea.

Many cultivators were aghast after feeling the wrath of the fish and turned pale. Today was the day that they would witness the ferocity of the Teeming Tribe.

“Devour me?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile before leisurely replying: “With a bunch of trash like you? Not to mention this army of one million, even if the billions of Teeming Fish in the Heaven Spirit World were here, I still wouldn’t give a damn.”

This direct provocation left people exchanging glances with each other. Here were more than ten high elders of the tribe and even the tribemaster himself. At least ten Virtuous Paragons were here, not to mention the vast armies of soldiers.

The tribemaster shouted: “Little beast, you will experience a fate worse than death! We shall stomp on your bones! My children! Feast on him!”

“Kill!” The furious army crazily cried out before frenziedly rushing for Peacock Land. These waves of fish slammed straight towards the island as if wanting to break it apart.

Li Qiye smiled and, with a buzz, a law emerged from his heavenly cauldron.

“Rumble!” In a split second, bubbles sprayed out of the sea. These bubbles looked just like little palms that began to grab the Teeming Fish. They grabbed all of them without exception despite their great numbers. Even the group of the tribemaster couldn’t escape. All were caught by these palms made out of water.

“Activate!” The shocked fish took action and tried to slash through these palm-shaped bubbles. However, this water had been refined by Li Qiye to be one with the ocean. How could these Teeming Fish cut through it?

“Too late.” Li Qiye gently smiled. With a boom, this area suddenly formed little cauldrons that ignited. The fiery cauldrons turned into huge palms that descended from the sky to grab the heads of these fish.

“Ah!” Miserable screams echoed across this land. These screams resonated with each other, creating a hellish scene. While listening to the ups and downs of this grim melody, anyone would feel that they were trapped in hell.

“Pluff! Pluff! Pluff!” The hands made out of water began to pull. These fish’s heads and bodies were separated, and even their spines were being pulled out. This was an extremely scary spectacle.

The tribemaster screamed: “No!” His body was being abnormally elongated. He tried to escape from the hands, but he still failed despite being a Virtuous Paragon.

Eventually, he let out one last shriek and couldn’t escape the fate of decapitation like the rest.

“It would be a shame to waste all of these lives.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Boom!” The cauldron flame changed again. These bubbles turned into stoves and instantly refined the million bodies into ashes. Their vitality was taken away and sucked into the Myriad Heavenly Cauldron.

At this time, the flame that came from the sky turned into crimson chains and hung the fish heads in the sky.

This scene was too spectacular and terrifying. The fish heads — still connected to their spines — were suspended in the air.

“Blegh!” One person couldn’t bear this horrible scene and began to vomit. Many cultivators ran away from fear.

Cultivators were accustomed to death, but slaughtering one million in one breath was truly rare. Not to mention, these fish were still hanging in the sky. This was a scene that no one had ever seen before.

“It was a trap!” The paled and dazed crowd finally realized that a terrifying trap was planted in this area in advance.

They also understood why Li Qiye warned everyone to stay out of the circle he drew. So it turned out that he was reminding people lest they be caught up in this as well.

Prior to this, they thought he had an ulterior motive, but it turned out that he warned them with good intentions. Cold chills emanated from within as they began to sweat. They only left the circle to make way for the Teeming Fish. If it wasn’t for that, their ends could have been the same as these fish before them.

“This must be a grand formation that harmonizes with the heaven and earth. Its power must be wondrous and must have taken more than just one day to set up.” A grand character from the previous generation understood the power of this trap after seeing the Teeming Tribemaster being unable to escape.

Li Qiye sweep through the crowd with his eyes and slowly uttered: “Go tell the Teeming Fish that I will be waiting here at Peacock Land. If they want revenge, bring it on. Or, they can cower with their tails tucked between their legs and never show their faces in the Heaven Spirit World again.”

A lot of people’s hearts skipped a beat after hearing this declaration of war. Li Qiye had set up a grand formation here to wait for more Teeming Fish.

Eventually, he looked at the few human cultivators and coldly spoke: “It is time for the human race to leave.”

These humans shuddered and some of them left immediately. However, a few chose to stay in order to see the outcome of this storm.

News of Li Qiye’s move spread across the entire Jade Sea in a flash. The listeners batted their brows after hearing about his massacre.

“This person is ruthless with great schemes. Who expected him to kill one million Teeming Fish in this manner?” A sect master murmured with fear in his mind.

“War is coming, the Teeming Fish will definitely not let this go.” A big shot from the Treant Race commented as well.

“Not just them, the Extreme Yang School and the Immaculate Expanse won’t let this go either, or else they’ll lose all face in the Heaven Spirit World.” An ancestor gently sighed.

In a short amount of time, the Jade Sea turned quiet. Many people were looking forward to the events at Peacock Land. However, they were not concerned about the Peacock Tree. Their eyes were on Li Qiye.

They all understood that his opponents had two choices: they could either fight a direct battle or avoid this trap and find opportunities to kill him later.

However, avoiding this battle would be a huge blow to their prestige. The reputation established by their forefathers would be shattered overnight. If they were afraid of a single human boy, how could they guard their own territories in the future?

By enduring the shame of having a million of their children massacred, no one would fear the Teeming Fish later on!
