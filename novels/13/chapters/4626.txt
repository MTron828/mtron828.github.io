Chapter 4627: Golden Mad Fist

This fist dao focused on absolute power. One punch could break heaven and earth along with the four oceans. Its energy rampaged like wild waves, instantly sending anything along the path on its way.

Crowd members were shocked after sensing it. They believed that it wouldn’t be inferior to any fist merit law of the dao lord level.

“Bam!” The punch smashed into True Immortal Spirit’s grasp technique.

The emanating shockwaves were violent and ferocious. Trees and buildings nearby crumbled in the blink of an eye.

This exchange ended with True Immortal Spirit staggering several steps backward - clearly losing the exchange.

“Please stop here, gentlemen.” An old man appeared in the air, speaking with a dignified voice. He had gray hair and wore a golden cloak, looking fierce. His arms, in particular, brimmed with martial strength.

“Golden Mad Fist.” An ancestor said.

The majority recognized the old man since he was the current leader of Golden Gate and Ye Tingrong’s grandfather.

He was relatively famous among last-gen cultivators. He didn’t dominate as much as Golden Fist Emperor but his prestige was comparable to sect leaders and rulers.

“Senior Mad Fist.” Others came over and cupped their fist. This applied to some ancestors as well since they were guests.

“Senior.” True Immortal Spirit slightly bowed. He had an unhappy expression as he spoke: “Your punch was incredible.”

He didn’t appreciate being stopped by Golden Mad Fist. Nonetheless, due to his upbringing, he exercised enough restraint to not act out. Nonetheless, his tone indicated dissatisfaction.

“You’re too kind.” Mad Fist cupped his fist back and said: “Your attack was gasp-worthy, my art compared to yours is akin to a firefly trying to outshine the moon.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Being praised by a contemporary master made the genius happy. His dissatisfaction disappeared with haste.

“Thank you, Senior.” Though his expression remained normal, he was actually elated inside.

Mad Fist then spoke to everyone else: “Heroes from the various regions, you are guests here at Golden Gate. If there is something lacking in our hospitality, please let me know so I can rectify the problem. As for personal feuds and conflicts, please settle them elsewhere. Our disciples are weak and can’t handle your might.”

He spoke properly and with sincerity, prompting the crowd to exchange glances. It was hard for anyone to speak out against Golden Gate right now since he had won the crowd over.

“Senior, we will act with propriety.” Many experts stated their stance.

The seniors and the big shots also nodded in agreement.

“What do you think, Virtuous Nephew?” Mad Fist then asked the genius.

The latter looked around and read the crowd. Refusing wasn’t an option currently since it would offend everyone. Moreover, the current pretense was that he came as a guest, seeking a marriage engagement.

“I do not dare to disobey.” He bowed slightly before glaring at Li Qiye and snorting. He didn’t add any fierce words and left right away. From beginning to end, he acted in a manner befitting of his status and background.

With his departure, it seemed that causing trouble here was not possible. Golden Mad Fist might interfere and subdue any problem.

“We appreciate everyone for being considerate.” Golden Mad Fist spoke again: “Please enjoy your stay.”

Everyone cupped their fist before leaving. Though they wanted to see a fight to the death between Li Qiye and Paramount Scion, the situation didn’t allow it right now.

Nonetheless, some left while having many things to think about. The most popular question was Li Qiye’s push. How the hell did he do it? Was it really a peerless treasure?

“Please follow me, Young Noble.” Ye Tingrong led the way for Li Qiye’s group.

They came to Golden Peak; she clearly had high regard for them since only a few were eligible to come to the main peak.

“Do you want to meet your father-in-law?” The daoist elbowed Jian Ming and whispered.

“Not this nonsense again.” Jian Ming turned red and glared at him.

“I wasn’t joking around. You may propose under my protection.” Li Qiye said flatly.

“Young Noble…” Jian Ming awkwardly stole glances at Ye Tingrong.

“This is a great opportunity if you fancy this arrangement. There will be no other so don’t regret it later.” Li Qiye said.

“Brat, the young noble is right.” The daoist said: “She’ll have to marry someone else if you keep on wasting time. I don’t think it is possible to delay a marriage arrangement this time.”

Ye Tingrong didn’t refute this comment since it was true. The circumstances forced her to marry someone regardless of her wish.

“Brother Jian, go for it.” Paramount Scion voiced his support. Though he was a suitor, he was only here to fulfill a mission and didn’t actually want to marry Ye Tingrong.

“I…” Jian Ming stammered, unable to speak.
