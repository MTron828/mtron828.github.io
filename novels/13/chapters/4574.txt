Chapter 4575: Truth

Nothing more needed to be said about Si Jingru’s prestige, just the respect given to her by the seniors everywhere said it all.

Even sect masters needed to lower their head in her presence. Among the young generation, only someone such as the successor of True Immortal was comparable. However, she wanted to serve Li Qiye right now.

For others, just standing close to her was a supreme honor. Who would be worthy of having her join their faction?

Li Qiye smiled and gently flicked her forehead: “I don’t have anything good to pass down to you. You just need more time and luck before obtaining great achievements. However, just take your time since the grand dao is arduous and long. An immovable dao heart is necessary before reaching the apex. You already have all the right prerequisites, work on your dao heart until ten thousand years are no different than the blink of an eye.”

Si Jingru listened attentively, took a moment to ponder, and then bowed deeply: “I thank you for your guidance, Young Noble.”

“Go, we might meet again one day on the dao path.” Li Qiye smiled and nodded.

“I hope to be able to follow you on this path later.” Si Jingru didn’t know when she would be able to meet him again. She then asked: “Will you visit Ancestral Divine Temple later?”

Entering the temple was a big deal. Only supreme masters were invited but judging by her tone, it would be their honor to have him visit.

“No, a meeting is just another separation in the end.” Li Qiye stared at the horizon and let out a sigh.

“I understand, may we meet again. I will be taking my leave now.” She bowed once more. As she departed, she couldn’t help looking at him for a while before leaving. She recalled the years when she told him both her joyous and sad moments, even her most secretive insecurities.

After she was gone, Li Qiye glanced at Lin Mo.

“When are you departing, Young Noble?” She asked, looking as serene as can be regardless of the circumstances.

“When the time is right.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Would it be alright if I follow you on that date?” She stared at him with her clear eyes.

“Why do you suddenly want to leave?” He asked.

“I’ve been in this mortal world long enough to see it a thousand times.” She tilted her head slightly and said seriously. [1]

“It’s all the same, just in a different form and location.” Li Qiye smiled.

She nodded in agreement: “I’ve heard this line before but still want to go take a look.” Her goal seemed to be to visit all places possible in the world.

The others were confused by this conversation. What was this about a departure date and mortal world, different form?

“I suppose it’s fine if that is all you want to do.” Li Qiye nodded.

Her starry eyes were special. Nothing in this world could leave its reflection on them. On the other hand, she was capable of seeing the souls and minds of others.

“Young Noble, what is your pursuit?” She asked.

His eyes became profound as he answered: “Everything in the world happens for a reason. Perhaps I’m trying to fulfill my desired vision.”

“I see. That requires knowing yourself and what you truly want.” She pondered for a moment before responding: “Someone once said that searching for the truth and proving oneself is the longest path.”

“It is a lofty goal indeed. Many peerless cultivators have tried their whole life only to fail. The prerequisite of seeing the truth might require everlasting life. When one has everything, that’s when they can realize their true selves.” Li Qiye said.

“When one has everything, that’s when they can realize their true selves.” She quietly murmured.

Wise Ancestor also listened and something suddenly flashed in his mind.

“But I don’t think that is your goal.” She said.

“No need for that because I already know as I’m standing here.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Listen to your heart and it will tell you the truth. No need to prove anything, be free and see who you truly are.”

“Mmm…” She fell into deep rumination. After a while, she seemed to be enlightened and bowed deeply: “Your words are better than cultivating for ten thousand years. I will take your teachings to heart.”

He smiled and accepted her gesture. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Since the grand dao has no end in sight, one needs a rudder and anchor to move forward. Do you have one, Young Noble?” She became curious.

“I am seeking for an answer, not for myself or anyone else, just an answer in and of itself.” Li Qiye responded.

“What answer are you looking for?” She asked.

“I do not know, maybe there is no answer. Perhaps the search and the journey are the answers.” He shook his head and said.

“Your perspective is unique and exceptional.” She couldn’t help but praise after gaining some insight into cultivation.

“As for you, you have seen what you needed to see, you just don’t know it yet.” He smiled.

“Right.” She agreed: “A child saw many things without understanding until far later. This was the case for me, unfortunately, the moment has passed. Nonetheless, it is a fortune to be able to see you today.”

“To see without understanding might not be a bad thing.” He responded: “Knowing doesn’t mean overcoming. Plus, who you are today was built on youthful ignorance. You could have become a shining star or the dark night, but in the end, those aren’t you. Do you like who you are right now?”

She took her time thinking before concluding: “The current me will do. No more, no less, not too much, not too little, just enough.”

“How many people can be lucky enough to say the same thing about themselves? This is due to your effort and luck.” He said.

“Like our meeting today.” She added.

“It’s too early to say that. This might be true for someone else, the greatest of fortune but for you, no. Our meeting might illuminate your mind or stir it up, causing unrest and instability, not a good thing at all.” He shook his head.

“I still think that meeting you is a blessing regardless of what comes next.” She bowed deeply.
