Chapter 4686: Shamelessness

This figure seemed unstoppable with dao laws engulfing the valley. This was an old man holding a divine shield, seemingly having just walked out of the primordial chaos. His light commanded respect and veneration.

“Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor!” A few recognized him right away.

He was the master of True Immortal Spirit and a cultivator who had dominated Eight Desolaces.

Ancient ancestors were certainly mighty. As for those from True Immortal? They were on another level.

“Untethered!” He glared menacingly at the vajra. Those looking at his eyes couldn’t help shuddering in fear.

He didn’t immediately attack and simply stated: “Our sect wants this celestial horse grass.”

He left no room for negotiation; his will trumped above all. If anyone dared to compete with True Immortal for this grass, they would immediately attack. Since he himself said these words, none doubted his ability to carry out the threat.

All eyes were on the vajra, eagerly awaiting his response.

“Ah… hahaha, how dare I not listen to you, Senior Heavenseal? If you wish to have this grass, I will hand it over with both hands.” The vajra laughed.

His sudden change in attitude surprised everyone again. A master like him should have ample pride and self-respect.

The big shots here might not be able to fight Heavenseal but they would still speak strongly, not wanting to disparage their reputation.

Now, the vajra immediately flattered his opponent like a sycophant, faster than someone flipping a page and without any resistance.

In their opinion, only a despicable and shameless scoundrel could do something like this.

“I can’t believe he is this type of person. Bending the knee before a stronger opponent.” An expert complained.

“This is unsightly to watch, so cowardly.” A big shot shook her head with disappointment.

This was especially true for the vagabonds. They became annoyed to see him so servile since he was considered the strongest of their type.

“Perfect.” Heavenseal was awfully satisfied with Untethered’s attitude, thinking that the coward has been intimidated by his mighty aura.

“The grass is yours, Senior.” Untethered smiled and bowed: “I’ll be leaving then. In the future, I will visit True Immortal and hope to learn from you then, Senior.”

Some spectators felt nauseous after seeing this act.

“The old geezer changes so quickly.” Jian Ming murmured.

“You may go.” Heavenseal was in a great mood and benevolently waved his hand.

“Thank you, Senior.” Untethered cupped his first and disappeared into the horizon, managing to ruin his reputation.

Of course, their contempt toward him was one thing, they wouldn’t have tried to fight Heavenseal either.

True Immortal Saintess heaved a sigh of relief. She didn’t expect an ancient ancestor to come for this grass.

“Capture it.” Heavenseal glared at the crowd before ordering his fellow sect members. He saw the fear in their eyes and loosened his guard.

“Soaring Dragon!” At this exact second when he relaxed, a golden dragon roared and attacked him from behind.

“Boom!” The mighty dragon destroyed everything in its path.

“Be careful!” The saintess shouted.

“Soaring Dragon again.” Everyone knew the ambusher’s identity right away. Who else could it be but Untethered Vajra?

Everyone thought that he was scared out of his mind earlier after seeing Heavenseal. None expected him to return for an ambush attack. Heavenseal himself felt the same way. He thought that the vajra’s balls could grow ten times and the guy still wouldn’t dare to attack him.

“Treacherous rat!” He became furious and swung his shield back to block the golden dragon. Its force could break down the largest mountain range.

“Raa!” The dragon disintegrated after slamming into the shield.

The crowd thought that the vajra was going to die to the remnant shockwaves. However, he appeared right next to the grass and captured it instead. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“!” Heavenseal realized that the ambush was only a diversion but it was too late.

The vajra leaped into the air and split into a million figures. All of them ran in different directions.

“I apologize again, Senior, hahaha.” The vajra’s voice came from all directions.

“Chase him!” The ancient ancestor was livid and flew into the air to give chase.

The saintess and master of True Immortal stood there in a daze. Did this vajra just steal the grass in front of their ancient ancestor?
