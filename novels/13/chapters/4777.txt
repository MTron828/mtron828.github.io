Chapter 4778: Know Your Place

Ancient ancestors held their breath after hearing this. An ultimate cultivator like Li Qiye didn’t need to explain himself or his actions to anyone. 

Thus, whatever he obtained in the Primordial Union was his business alone. After all, who could make him talk right now?

Enveloping Monarch felt a sharp pain in his heart and started heaving for breath. Li Qiye’s tone remained friendly as if he was commenting on the weather. Alas, he understood how foolish he was for asking.

“Congratulations, Young Noble. I’ve heard the news of your heavenly treasure.” Someone else interjected while Enveloping stood there frozen.

Everyone looked over and saw that it was none other than Cosmic Lord.

He revitalized True Immortal and led the world once. Thus, the crowd still respected him and he was certainly worthy of it.

However, he was still overshadowed by Li Qiye’s current prestige and status. His spotlight was completely stolen.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Putting this contrast aside, they also heard his comment and became emotional. The big shots and peerless cultivators thought that he was courting death.

Some have received information that it might be one of the nine mythical treasures. However, they didn’t dare to say a damn thing lest risk offending Li Qiye.

Now, Cosmic Lord dared to reveal Li Qiye’s secret in public. This was certainly unwise.

“One of the nine.” An ancestor whispered in astonishment.

“I didn’t know they were actually real.” A young expert felt the same way.

“No one has seen them before so it’s unverifiable.” The ancestor responded.

Astoundment struck everyone because it seemed that the mythical items were actually real since Cosmic Lord spoke with confidence.

They didn’t understand his decision at all because one hand wave from Li Qiye could obliterate him. 

“I can see why he used to be the alliance leader.” Another ancestor calmed down and said.

Everyone was afraid of Li Qiye right now and didn’t think about provoking him. No one dared to bring up the nine treasures but Cosmic Lord was different. His courage and decisiveness far exceeded theirs.

Foolish it may be, this was part of his charisma and perhaps the reason why he was able to rally everyone against Doom Godfiend.

“Quite fast with the information.” Li Qiye smiled.

His confirmation struck listeners like lightning. Their brains exploded and they stood in a daze. This included peerless ancient ancestors as well.

“They are absolutely real then!” One ancestor blurted.

The Nine Heavenly Treasures were artifacts exceeding even paragon weapons from the previous epochs. Those with knowledge of them understood their significance. Now, Li Qiye had confirmed their existence.

“Li Qiye is already unbeatable, now, he has a heavenly treasure too…?” A top genius murmured.

His power became unfathomable even for the most experienced ancestors and lords. He might exceed everyone in the past and the future.

“The nine treasures were born in the chaos with heaven and earth. It is a part of the world…” Cosmic Lord smiled, able to still converse normally with Li Qiye without trembling in fear.

“And?” Li Qiye interrupted him.

“Since it is a part of the world, it should be shared with its inhabitants.” Cosmic Lord concluded.
