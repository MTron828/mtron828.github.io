Chapter 5699: Just One Dao Fruit For A Lifetime

Luminous was hellbent on destroying the gate, not minding the destruction of Dao City or all of the immortal continent.

Eventually, he cut through the runes and power barriers, striking the gate itself.

“Creak!” A mighty slash pushed the gate inward, revealing a tiny gap. Of course, a small gap was all he needed.

“Clank!” Momentous Star immediately shot a beam into the gap, preventing the gate from closing.

“Open!” He roared and used all the power of Momentous Dao to pry the gate open.

“Creak!” Sure enough, it started moving away, inch by inch.

“Success is imminent!” War and the others were ecstatic; seeing their plan coming to fruition.

Although the process was rather slow, spectators understood that Luminous had done the impossible.

“Brought a wolf home.” Survivors could only watch.

“Dao City is finished, maybe Immortal Dao City too.” This struck a heavy blow to The People.

“Immortal Dao City might belong to Celestial Court now...” An ancestor’s voice was filled with despair.

During Immemorial Epoch War, The People struggled unceasingly for a place to live. They never had a place to stay for a long period, always running away from Celestial Court’s suppression before a counterattack.

Immortal Dao City gave them a permanent home. They built cities and villages around it, culminating in Dao Domain. This became the headquarters of The People.

Prosperity came after stability. Sects and kingdoms of the imperial level appeared.

The stability extended to Skysplitter War. The leaders relied on Immortal Dao City to fend off Celestial Court. A successful assault didn’t last long before the might of a heavenly treasure. Thus, as long as it was around, The People had no reason to fear.

This changed today when their city lord conspired with Celestial Court to open the gate to Immortal Dao City.

Hope stood no chance against despair. The loss of Immortal Dao City signaled the end for their headquarters, reducing them to unwilling nomads.

“Luminous, you bastard!” Survivors spewed the most vile curses at him.

The closing of the gate was dire but potentially temporary. It wouldn’t fall to Celestial Court’s control and everyone could always regain Dao City afterward.

However, Luminous’ treachery changed everything. The wolves have been invited to their home. The survivors wanted nothing more than to eat his flesh, drink his blood, and grind his bones.

The savior of the past had pushed them down into the abyss, preventing them from ever seeing the sun again.

“Creak...” The gate continued to be pried open by Momentous Star.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a magnificent flash appeared within the gate.

“Rumble!” A woman came out, surrounded by immortal runes. Their explosions were in tune with the dao. She alone seemed enough to prevent an army from taking a single step inside.

Her light illuminated the entire heavenly treasure and rekindled the survivors’ optimism.

“Genesis Conqueror!” Luminous’ expression soured after seeing her.

The members of Celestial Court became startled as well after hearing the title of this historical figure.

“It’s Genesis Conqueror!” Survivors got a good look at her - a woman wearing a faint yellow dress.

Her skin was as fair as the moon with star-like eyes and sharp brows. She stood there and illuminated the world with an aura of nobility and grace.

The explosive immortal dao runes made her look like a supreme being. Of course, she didn’t need them to be dominant since she was on the same level as Light-dragon and Heaven Burial Conqueror of Celestial Court.

Previously, dao lords and dragon lords required twelve dao fruits before crafting an immortal shell. The one exception was possessing a primordial dao fruit. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everything changed with Genesis Conqueror who only cultivated one dao fruit yet still created an immortal shell and obtained anima.

She pioneered an entirely new path - relying on a single supreme dao fruit to embark on the path of anima.

Now, she stood before the invaders as the guardian of Dao City.
