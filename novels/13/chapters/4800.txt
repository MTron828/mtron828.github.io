Chapter 4801: Betrayal

“Ahh!” Cheers turned into screams in Three Thousand Dao.

Both the young and old struggled to break free but this turned out to be futile. Their dao essences and power surged outward and headed for the maelstrom. In fact, ancient ancestors and even disciples of Dan Sanqian who once reigned the region shared the same fate.

“Ancient Ancestor, what is happening?!” One disciple bellowed.

“I don’t know!” The ancient ancestor had no idea. Her grand dao was actively restricting her.

The resonation process spared no one in Three Thousand Dao. They could only watch their power being absorbed by the maelstrom above.

“It’s the progenitor!” One ancestor shouted. Who else could control the dao of the entire lineage but their progenitor?

“Why, Progenitor?!” The upper echelon started shouting at the sky as well.

They wanted to ask the supreme progenitor whom they have been worshipping for eras why he was doing this.

Alas, no answer came outside of the sounds coming from the spinning maelstrom.

“What are you doing, Brother?!” Enveloping could tell that something was wrong despite being far away from Three Thousand Dao.

“Accomplishing the great goal.” Dao Sanqian’s ethereal state on the river of time looked rather frightening.

“What goal is more important than Three Thousand Dao? We created it together, it is our lineage!” Enveloping became furious.

“Brother, we can always create a new one, no different from planting trees for a new forest.” Dao Sanqian said: “Trees burning down doesn’t mean destruction. The ashes will make the land fertile enough for a lusher forest.”

“Are you joking?!” Enveloping’s expression sank: “Think about all the living beings, our disciples and descendants!”

Listeners took note of this and became horrified. Regular experts couldn’t see Three Thousand Dao but the ancient ancestors activated their heavenly gaze.

Though they couldn’t see the exact details, they saw the changes in energy flows. Dao Sanqian wanted to destroy Three Thousand Dao along with everyone in it.

He spoke without any sadness or remorse. This naturally creeped out the listeners.

“Lives never disappear in the reincarnation cycle. They might be gone now but they will return in the next life to join me. I shall bestow upon them my grand dao again.” Dao Sanqian responded.

“You have gone mad! Joining you is the curse of three lifetimes!” Enveloping shouted.

“Brother, you don’t understand my aspiration.” Dao Sanqian said: “This will be a new epoch and its creation shall have my involvement, my laws, and my grand dao.”

“Enough of this.” Enveloping soared upward for a spear thrust.

“Clank!” The beam coming from the tip of his weapon pierced through space, intending on piercing Dao Sanqian’s chest and killing him. Enveloping didn’t hold back at all.

“They’re fighting…” Spectators became emotional since they didn’t fully grasp the extent of the massacre.

Everyone knew about their long-lasting friendship. Some believed that they were willing to die for each other.

Future generations passed down tales and songs celebrating this ironclad friendship. No temptation could ever make them betray each other until today.

“Brother, don’t do this.” Dao Sanqian said before chanting: “Three Thousand Dao, Three Truths.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Boom!” Three figures appeared on the river of time to stop the thrust before attacking Enveloping.

The real one continued controlling the maelstrom in order to absorb the power of his lineage.

“Die!” Enveloping maintained his assault against the three avatars.

“What is going on?” Some weaker cultivators were still lost.

“Dao Sanqian is sacrificing all of Three Thousand Dao.” A senior solemnly said.

“But… but that’s trillions of people…” The junior was scared out of his mind.

“Yes.” The senior felt the same shock.

“Why… why is he sacrificing them?” The junior’s teeth chattered.

“I’m not sure, he is performing a grand ceremony, I don’t know the actual aim.” The senior shook her head.

“Rather merciless.” The ancient existences hiding in the abyss and forbidden zones said. Only an emotionless cultivator would be able to do something of this magnitude.
