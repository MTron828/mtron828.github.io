Chapter 4283: Dao Comprehension

Due to his silent state, the girl didn’t feel any threat from him and told him everything on her mind.

“There are too many layers to the divine dao, I don’t know how to keep on improving. If I don’t get through this next one, the sisters might surpass me.” She was pessimistic today.

Possessing a high status didn’t mean that she was freed from worries. As a heavily-groomed disciple, she needed to show results. If she were to be surpassed by her rival, she would lose her status.

“In history, the members of our sect cultivate the divine dao in different ways.” She murmured: “They all experienced something unique and personal. Recently, I saw a strange phenomenon, a divine tree blotting out the sky and my vision, I can’t see anything past it…”

She became frustrated because there shouldn’t be anything wrong with the merit law. Rumor has it that it came from a heavenly dao. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Their patriarch extracted it from a heavenly dao in order to protect the descendants. Thus, it had no form and was fluid like water.

Thus, disciples had varying results and power from cultivating it. This made the learning process exceedingly difficult and full of pressure.

A successful soul would be able to take over the sect and gain immense authority. This was an established rule - their leader must have finished learning this dao.

The strongest of these users was naturally their patriarch. In the distant and chaotic era, the patriarch annihilated evil and established an everlasting foundation.

Their divine dao became well-known, rumored to be superior to most dao lord merit laws. She had access to this dao at a young age - something quite enviable.

Everyone knew that she was a potential successor. Nonetheless, this didn’t mean that she lacked rivals.

Among the competitors, whoever successfully finished the dao first would become the official successor.

Alas, the recent phenomena during training recently left her confused. She asked the seniors and ancestors but didn’t get any concrete response or solution. Everyone had a different experience before so they couldn’t offer good advice.

“Why am I the only one with these phenomena that blind me? Is this qi deviation?” She told Li Qiye.

Being surpassed by the martial sisters was one thing. After all, they were all supreme geniuses. However, qi deviation might result in death.

“Why do you think these phenomena are detrimental?” She suddenly heard a voice.

“Ah!” She blurted out and stared at Li Qiye in astonishment, still looking as gorgeous as always despite the shock.

Ever since she brought him back, he was no different from a living corpse. She assumed that he could only listen without understanding.

Thus, his sudden speech caught her off guard.

“You… you can speak?” She stammered.

“I’m not mute so I can obviously speak.” Li Qiye’s soul had returned to the body so he became normal again.

She took another look and saw a distinct change in his eyes - they became unbelievably profound. She thought she might become lost the more she stared at them.

“You heard everything?” She thought about their previous conversations and turned red right away.

“I did not hear when I didn’t want to hear, so I was spared of your babblings, fortunately.” He responded.

“You…” She was embarrassed.

“All of you have done a terrible job training the divine dao passed down by your empress.” He changed the subject.

“W-what?” These words struck her deeply.

“Do not worry about these phenomena. Others would love to have them since it is a sign of the door yet they are stuck circling outside.” He revealed.

“Really?” Her eyes widened in disbelief but his words gave her hope.

“Of course.” He continued: “The visual phenomenon of the blotting divine tree is a sign, a reflection of the source.”

“A reflection of the source?” She became emotional and took a deep breath.

“What should I do then?” She hurriedly asked and forgot about everything else: “I couldn’t see anything outside of the tree, how can I understand its profundities?”

“Profundities aren’t learned with the eyes, use your heart and listen to its whisper, feel its beat. Listen and it will answer.” He explained.

“Is that so?” She skeptically sat down in the meditative pose and channeled her merit law and vitality.

Chaos energy permeated the room and the visual phenomena came back - the divine tree and the celestials floating around it. The myriad dao and time itself were subservient to the tree. Its existence supported all lifeforms.

Alas, the world created by the tree was just too large. She was tinier than a speck of dust in comparison and couldn’t fathom its immensity.

“The dao resides in the heart, release your mind and soul…” Li Qiye chanted while she was lost in her training.

His words echoed in her mind like bells, knocking on her very soul.

She followed his advice and after a buzz, when she opened her eyes again, she found herself to be in the illusory world.

Time and the celestials also flowed around her. The orders of the world could be clearly seen, truly a magnificent sight.

She became captivated by the colors; the most mysterious grand dao seemed to be imprinting itself into her heart.

“What was that world?” She forgot her way back while feeling this unprecedented dao enlightenment.

After a long while, she regained her wits and returned to the real world.

“How magical, I sensed it, its sound and beats!” She shouted.

“Thank you…?” She was ecstatic and turned around to show her gratitude.

Alas, Li Qiye was not there. She assumed that he had gone outside but still couldn’t find him after searching the entire sect.

She panicked and ordered followers to look for him. They still couldn’t find him within a thousand-mile radius.
