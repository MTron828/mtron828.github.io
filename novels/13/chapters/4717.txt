Chapter 4718: Peerless Genius

Though Jun Shentian was brilliant, the consensus was that Li Qiye was the overwhelming favorite. They didn’t expect the underdog to rely on his dao and bloodline to banish Li Qiye instead.

The tiny Li Qiye was now lost in countless dimensional layers, never being able to return. The result was the same as killing him.

“That’s the son of a dao lord for you, a magnificent move.” One lord said with admiration.

No one had a problem with his victory. Being able to banish Li Qiye displayed his power because others couldn’t have done the same.

“The five conquerors are back again.” One genius murmured.

“No, Shen Juntian is the clear number one now.” A female cultivator disagreed.

“Yes, he’s the number one in all aspects now, I love him so much…” Saintesses and princesses’ infatuation grew.

“Boom!” Unfortunately, the celebratory mood was short-lived because of a spatial detonation causing Shen Juntian to stagger backward.

A pulsing gateway opened in Li Qiye’s previous location and he walked out.

“It’s him!” Everyone recognized him and shouted.

“The banishment still didn’t work. I knew it, it’s not that easy to defeat Li Qiye.” A regional lord commented.

“Amazing, infinitely shrunken and banished yet he still came back so fast. He must have traveled through numerous dimensions, how insane.” An ancestor gasped.

“Power and speed, Li Qiye has it all. The five conquerors have to fight him together to win.” A monstrous cultivator from a secretive location said.

Li Qiye patted the dust off his sleeves and said: “A bit interesting. Well done at attempting to defeat overwhelming power with technique.”

“Dao Brother, how do we defeat you if you can travel between dimensions so freely?” Juntian didn’t look particularly surprised.

“The banishing technique wasn't bad, you are the top of the young generation.” Li Qiye smiled, implying that he was the best out of the five conquerors.

“Yet I’m still inferior to you, Dao Brother.” Juntian sentimentally said.

Li Qiye waved his hand and said: “Got anything else? It is time to display what you have learned from your father.”

His gesture seemed disrespectful but he had earned the right to do so. Not even Juntian’s fans dared to criticize him.

Most focused on the learning aspect of this fight, hoping to understand more of the dao. This was especially true for the younger generation.

“It seems that I’m truly overestimating myself. Nonetheless, I will keep trying my best.” Juntian said.

“Does he really want to fight to the end?” An expert wondered.

“I think so, this will end with death.” An ancestor stared at Juntian and responded.

“There’s no feud between them, this is unnecessary.” A female cultivator didn’t want to see this.

“He’s a true genius, not afraid of death while searching the other shore of the dao. A coward can’t reach the same height akin to an insect not understanding why the dragon roar defiantly.” A lord understood Juntian’s will to fight.

“Go for it, I’m ready.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Bam!” Juntian took out a weapon and rested it on the ground. The ground shook violently from its weight.

“Golden Trident.” Many big shots recognized the weapon. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Left behind by Eight-stallion Dao Lord.” One of them said.

It pulsed with a sacred light along with a dao lord aura without holding back.

Many here have seen dao lord weapons and sensed their auras before. Alas, this was rather different.

The aura was brimming with life and looked animated. This was a son using his father’s weapon so the aura could crush the sky or any cultivator.

A golden glow illuminated his flawless features, causing him to look holy. Everyone found him worthy of his background.

“Still have to rely on my background in the end.” Juntian said softly.

Others didn’t quite agree because he certainly played a large part in his current achievements and power. He didn’t dishonor his father in the slightest and none thought that he was unworthy of using his father’s weapon.

“I alone can’t defeat you, Dao Brother. I have to use my father’s weapon in order to see your true ability, my apology.” He added.

“Broaden my horizon then, son of Eight-stallion Dao Lord.” Li Qiye smiled.
