Chapter 4409: Esteemed Guests’ Arrival

CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Rumble!” Continuous detonations came from the horizon.

Flames and lights took over along with billowing clouds. An expedition appeared before the spectators.

They looked like they were moving slowly but in actuality, they were traveling at astonishing speed.

The vanguard consisted of eight rows of cavalries. The horses galloped and crushed the sky, leaving behind hoof prints.

There was only a thousand or so cavalries but it still gave the appearance of being a tsunami of steel, capable of crushing all resistance.

Next came the main force. They were accompanied by auspicious clouds and green mists while marching in a classical style.

It consisted a hundred thousand troops hailing from various sects, evident by the diverse banners blotting out the sun.

There were fierce beasts and birds, ancestors with incredible auras, chariots with ultimate offensive potential…

One unique group had elephants with pagodas placed on their back. White-haired men could be seen sitting on the balconies.

Another had a gigantic red hawk. The gaze of its red eyes resembled crimson rays. The gales emanating from its flapping wings could tear the flesh off bones. Five red-robed ancestors stood on its back, looking rather intimidating.

One group of auspicious clouds had a great demon king meditating in the center. A treasure sword was placed on top of his knees. It had a chilling aura, always ready to pierce the heart.

“So many representatives from Eastern Desolace.” The spectators below were shocked to see the force.

This was grander than their expectation. Moreover, these powers brought influential characters and ancestors, not just regular disciples.

It became apparent how important this visit was and the reason why Dragon took it so seriously with the ceremonious reception.

“Rumble!” One particular chariot was pulled by nine pairs of radiant auspicious beasts. Their glow fully radiated the surroundings.

One could tell that they were incredibly powerful. The chariot itself had countless engraved runes and jeweled tassels. The laws echoing from it were harmonious just like a dao melody, enough to make others immerse in it and forget themselves.

On top was an old man sitting cross-legged. His outfit was a golden robe with a five-clawed dragon.

His expression was dignified and commanded respect.

“That’s the previous master of Five-sun School.” Someone from Eastern Desolace recognized him and said softly.

“Five-sun King’s father.” Another added.

He wasn’t an exceptional sect master at all, not one worth remembering. However, there was one thing he did that would be remembered by everyone - fathering Five-sun King.

He had great pride in his matchless son. Thus, he abdicated his position and let his son take over instead.

The boy didn’t let him down and the sect prospered under his leadership for the last several decades, looking to become the top dog of the east.

“What an entourage, there can’t be a greater representation of the east than this.” Many spectators were in awe.

“This is Five-sun King’s brilliant charisma. Even the ancient clans are willing to send their members southward.” A demon said with admiration.

Even the reclusive high elders and ancestors from the ancient clans have shown themselves in public for the king’s sake.

“Where is Five-sun King?” One spectator asked.

“He’s coming later.” A clan member in the know answered.

The atmosphere brimmed with excitement due to the rare event.

“Screech!” A colorful radiance appeared and a peacock flew out of it. It had a long tail and spread its wings, leaving behind an afterimage.

The bird then turned into a middle-aged man with rays behind him arranged in the shape of a peacock spreading its tail.

He had an imposing gaze and a billowing regal aura, looking as if he was the only significant person in the world.

Everyone took a deep breath after seeing this wondrous cultivator.

“Peacock Monarch!” Many shouted his title.

“Sect Master!” The members of Dragon kneeled.

No ancestors dared to look down on this rising genius. Though many of them were stronger, he was far younger and more talented. It was only a matter of time before he surpass them.

He personally appeared to greet this envoy. The ancestors from the other side also got out of their carriages and stood straight up. Even the previous sect master of Five-sun did the same.

“It is an honor to be your host, fellow daoists.” Peacock Monarch cupped his fist, acting quite appropriate to the occasion.

They returned the gesture. The previous sect master of Five-sun came over and grabbed the king’s hand: “My horizon is broadened after seeing you, Monarch. You do live up to your reputation.”

“You’re too kind, Ex-master. Five-sun King is the peerless genius of our time.” Peacock Monarch said.

The sect master became spirited after hearing such praise. He arched his chest and said: “No way, he is far from being peerless since he’s only one of the five conquerors.”

“He has the disposition of a dao lord already.” Peacock added.

The sect master was ecstatic to hear such a famous cultivator praising his son and pride.
