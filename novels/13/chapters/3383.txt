Maybe calling him middle-aged was an exaggeration. He still looked relatively young and in high spirits with three swords tied to his back.

A certain sword energy resided in the middle of his brows. It seemed as if he was the sword and the sword was him. The three swords on his back have become a part of his body.

Most would think that he was born with a deep understanding of the sword, capable of holding one in the cradle.

“Lu Yiling, the genius of Three Truths.” An older expert shouted at this sight.

Many turned pale and some even staggered backward upon hearing this name. It was quite notorious in this region.

Three Truths had seven main daoists with the sect master as their leader. Lu Yiling was the youngest but also the strongest in the present day.

He and the sect master had the same master. This master only took Lu Yiling in as a disciple near the end of his life. Because of this, Three Truths Sect master served as both a Senior Brother and a teacher to Yilin. The latter owed his cultivation to the sect master.

His talents could be considered the top within the last ten thousand years in Three Truths. He became more powerful under the guidance of the sect master and became one of the seven daoists in no time at all.

Others immediately thought of another genius - Su Xu. Lu Yiling was only a bit older. Unfortunately, their fate was different.

Su Xu died during the war while Yiling became one of the leaders of Three Truths. If Su Xu had enough time, maybe he would be just as strong as Yiling right now.

“That’s Lu Yiling.” Others stared at him with admiration.

His appearance caused a stir in the crowd, especially those in Divine Black. Even Ping Suoweng had a serious expression.

The situation became quite problematic with another powerful foe joining the mix.

“This looks bad for Divine Black.” Numerous spectators thought so because Yiling’s slash earlier managed to stop both combatants. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

No one in Divine Black should be able to stop him so it didn’t’ bode well for them. Defeat seemed inevitable.

“Sect Master Suoweng, I couldn’t handle a slash of you and my senior brother helped me back then. Today, I’ll fight in my senior brother’s stead.” Lu Yiling looked eager to fight without being arrogant.

Suoweng took his foe very seriously. In the past, Yiling nearly lost to a single slash and was saved by his senior brother.

He was no longer the same today. His sword technique has reached a level above Suoweng.

“You have grown indeed, Fellow Daoist Lu, while we have grown older.” Suoweng replied.

“You should know that your sect has lost now that I’m here.” Yiling said: “If you care about your sect, surrender and hand the peak over or there will be nothing but ashes left.”

Yiling spoke with utmost confidence. The content was overbearing yet it was the truth. His tone was rather civil as well. Anyone else would have been viewed as arrogant when saying the same thing.

Many in Divine Black weren’t willing to accept this but none stepped up. Yiling was just too strong, even stronger than their sect master.

Suoweng didn’t respond. Everyone stared at him with bated breath, waiting for his decision.

“There’s no saving Divine Black, no other options.” One spectator commented.

Yiling was unbeatable in this battle. Both Ping Suoweng and the bodhi king couldn’t take him down. That’s why defeat was imminent. Thus, making the wrong decision meant sect destruction. Divine Black would be erased from the northern West King.

“I appreciate your consideration.” Suoweng took a deep breath and said: “But as long as I am around, Divine Black will still be around! I’m ready to fight to the death.”

“I see, you’re still the same, so unyielding. Alas, you will find futility in your approach. Nothing can save Divine Black. Maybe not in my hands, but someone else will eventually do so. You must know this.” Yiling loudly responded.

He wasn’t making fun of Suoweng and Divine Black. The two of them knew the current precarious situation due to the ancestral peak.

“I’m aware, but I’m not changing my stance. You’ll have to walk over my dead body to get to the peak.” Suoweng still wanted to bet on Li Qiye.

“So be it. As you wish then. Senior Brother, please back off, I will fight Sect Master Suoweng.” Yiling declared.

“I’ll make way for the more capable.” Three Truths Sect Master smiled and shook his head with regrets: “It’s a shame, Suoweng, our lifelong rivalry will not have a conclusion after missing the opportunity today.”

He wasn’t trying to make fun of Suoweng either, being as sincere as can be. Suoweng’s defeat and death seemed certain so they would lose their chance. This was regrettable indeed for the sect master. Alas, time didn’t wait for anyone. He could be patient in the past but not right now.

“A shame indeed.” Suoweng nodded in agreement.

Meanwhile, the members of Divine Black naturally didn’t like the solemn tone of this conversation. It sounded like one’s last words, definitely ominous for the sect.

Yiling moved up higher and stood face to face with Ping Suoweng.

“Hurry up, capture Divine Black.” Meanwhile, Three Truths Sect Master gave the command.

He then raised his scepter and created mountains with smoke and fog hovering around them.

He swung his scepter downward and commanded the mountains to fly straight into Divine Black’s crystal barrier.

“Boom!” The entire sect quaked again, on the verge of being pushed into the ground.

“Crack!” The move finally left a crack on the barrier, something that the drill earlier couldn’t do.

With this, the drill repositioned itself and focused on this weak spot, resulting in even more cracks.

“Again!” He created more mountains and sent them down.

“Boom!” The first crystal barrier exploded and the drill moved onto the next.

“Shit!” The elders and disciples in charge of the grand formation became alarmed. Their formation would definitely break if this trend continued.
