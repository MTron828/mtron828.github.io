Those from Divine Black naturally loved this news. Only Ping Suoweng remained calm as if this was within his expectation.

Xu Nan stared at the chaos true energy oozing from the bodhi king and said: “Not bad but unfortunately, your physique hasn’t stabilized. You’re not my match and won’t be able to stop me.”

The bodhi king had only reached this realm recently and couldn’t compare to Xu Nan who made it this far for more than a thousand years.

“I appreciate the reminder.” The bodhi king smiled.

“Buzz.” Demonic energy rushed out of Thousands Demon Peak like the gathering of great demons.

The formations there caused the divine tree to grow even bigger with branches filled with leaves extending. It exuded a green radiance that engulfed the bodhi king.

It seemed as if there were numerous tentacles around him that began sucking in this demonic power.

His own aura erupted after being blessed by the demonic force. It materialized into a terrible storm, dozens of times stronger. His body naturally grew as well.

His sacred physique immediately became as tough as a fortress and brimming with endless power. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He had gathered the forces of Thousand Demons Peak into his body. By relying on this grand formation, he stabilized his cultivation realm and made it stronger.

This perfect connection couldn’t be duplicated by many. The bodhi king could do so because he has been in Thousand Demons Peak for so long.

The spectators realized that they have still underestimated him. He was definitely far stronger than the other peak lords with the exception of Ping Suoweng.

“An old demon indeed with deep roots, definitely the second strongest in Divine Black.” Everyone started admiring him.

“How about now, Elder Xu.” The bodhi king’s head was up in the firmament. His thousand hands moved back and forth, seemingly capable of upholding the cosmo.

“It’s a worthy battle now.” Xu Nan leaped into the air; his robe fluttered to the wind.

“Clank!” He unsheathed his saber, allowing its light to illuminate the four directions. Its radiance had a white celestial glow. Perhaps it was made from the stars.

Because of this affinity, each cut could reach into space and use its power.

“This is the saber of a Heavenly Sovereign, can you handle it?” The saber master raised his weapon. It started hymning and shot out saber rays everywhere - a manifestation of the saber intent. He looked invincible with this weapon in his grasp.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The bodhi king summoned his weapons. Each of his hands wielded a different type. Each of them had a strange visual phenomenon. Upon closer inspection, it felt as if these treasures could combine into one. Therefore, it became difficult for spectators to see their actual shape and type.

“I heard this weapon was left behind by the patriarch of Divine Black.” One spectator whispered.

Though it seemed like he was holding countless weapons, it was just one magical artifact.

“Cosmic Mover!” Xu Nan didn’t hold back since his opponent had a similar-level weapon. He jumped up and performed a vertical slash, releasing a cosmic wave.

The slash turned everything in its path into space and stars. It started gathering power and increased in size. Nothing could escape it.

“Activate!” The bodhi king sent out a demonic energy with the force of an unstoppable tsunami.

“Boom!” A cassia tree of unimaginable size drilled out of the ground. Each leaf could contain a star. Everything else seemed tiny compared to this tree.

“Immortal Cassia, the ultimate technique of Divine Black, Nine Primeval Laws!” An expert recognized this move.

The bodhi king spent many years learning this particular technique.

“Clank!” The branches turned into divine swords that combine together into one.

It became a contest between the sword and saber. The resulting explosion blinded the crowd.

“Again!” Xu Nan didn’t give up and unleashed another cosmic slash, ready to destroy the world.

The bodhi king showed no fear and released an ocean of swords for a direct confrontation.

“Rumble!” Sparks came out like fireworks in the sky. This became another destructive yet even contest.

“This is the true power of Divine Black. Three Truths is going all out with their army, four of the seven daoists are here too on top of another sacred-level cultivator. They still can’t take Divine Black down.” One spectator commented.

“No, Divine Black has the advantage right now.” A clan elder who has been carefully observing the various battles asserted.

A while later in another area, the elephant began to lose grounds against the relentless White Tiger and needed to retreat.

In a different location, the pagoda couldn’t keep up its onslaught after depleting energy. The gigantic shield from Eight Zhang repelled it.

“They have the home advantage.” Many spectators nodded, agreeing with the clan elder’s assessment.

“Losing this battle will put Three Truths in a terrible position.” An expert said.

“Not necessary, it’s not over yet.” One high elder remained neutral and shook his head.

“Looks like we need to end this fast!” Suddenly, a shout could be heard by everyone.

A sword arrived from the horizon, stealing everyone’s attention. It suddenly split into two swords and continued forward with meteoric speed.

“Watch it!” Both Mountainbearer King and the chief elder of Divine Black became startled.

“Boom! Boom!” One sword struck the white tiger while the other the great shield.

Blood splashed out of the tiger so it faltered backward. As for the shield, blood began pouring out of the penetrated hole.

People from Eight Zhang and Furious Tiger were clearly injured after this exchange.

“Clank!” Another invincible slash interrupted the fight between Ping Suoweng and Three Truths Sect Master.

“Boom!” It nullified their current move without any trouble. Both combatants were pushed backward.

Just two sword techniques completely changed the tides of the battle.

“So strong! Who is it?!” The crowd gasped in response.

They looked around and saw a middle-aged man floating in the air.
