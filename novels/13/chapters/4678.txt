Chapter 4679: River Demon of Death

“We’re moving.” Other big shots began flying toward the gate, the same for regular cultivators.

“Pop!” Once some got close enough, they were instantly repelled.

“Open!” An expert didn’t give up and roared, summoning his treasure and activating his merit law for a direct breakthrough. Unfortunately, he was still repelled by the gate.

“Don’t waste your energy, it wouldn’t have such a cool name if it’s weak.” A cultivator nearby advised.

“He’s right, even Worldbreaker was crushed, we need to know our limit.” A third speaker lamented.

Those unable to enter had no choice but to stand and watch. As for the ancestors, they summoned their true fate and revealed their vitality. They leaped into the gate and caused ripples of light that surround them.

“Come.” The radiant ancestors waved and the light also infected their fellow sect members, allowing everyone to enter as well.

“Why do they get to come in?” Some spectators became jealous.

“The Primordial Union is also known as the meeting of the ancestors.” An expert said, aware of their shallow cultivation: “Strength is a requirement for entry, maybe age as well. All in all, they must be approved by the union.”

It seemed that at the very least, one needed to be a Heavenly Sovereign. This was a realm usually only reached by the ancestors.

“Splash!” Suddenly, an engulfing tsunami rushed over from the horizon.

Everyone looked over and saw a terrifying scene - this flood actually contained countless seemingly-drowned corpses.

Since they were caught by this phenomenon, they smelled a rotten stench from the corpses floating around them.

“What the hell!?” Some became nauseous.

Next came a demonic figure heading for the gate. This was a strange demon river as tall as a child and had three eyes and six arms. His gaze was creepy, causing everyone to avoid him.

“River Demon of Death.” Someone quietly said.

“One of the three saints from the east.” Another added.

He was Five-sun King’s dao protector just like the spider god. This being was evil and had drowned an entire kingdom before, hence his title. He might not be the strongest ancient ancestor but his dreadful aura was ominous and unbearable for weaker cultivators.

“Boom!” A rotation of the six dao emerged in front of the gate. Their power took over the scene and shocked the unprepared spectators.

“Six-dao Immortal Monarch!” An ancestor shouted and immediately moved away.

“He’s here…” Many couldn’t see the figure fast enough but still gasped after hearing the title.

Six-dao Monarch was the first disciple of All-things Dao Lord of True Immortal. He entered the union before anyone could catch a glimpse of him. The invincible aura came quickly and left the same way. Nonetheless, it left an everlasting impression on the crowd.

“So strong.” Someone shuddered.

“Of course, the first disciple of All-things Dao Lord has to be strong.” An expert got up from the ground after the pressure was gone.

That aura just now made some ancestors want to kneel. Though the river demon was terrifying, he seemed lacking compared to Six-dao Monarch. One instilled a creepy fear while the other exuded absolute domination.

“Buzz.” Another phenomenon affected everyone - a dao harmonization this time around.

A divine lotus manifested into reality in front of the gate. The petals spread open and a figure could barely be seen due to the dao maelstroms appearing around her. Heavenly flowers started descending.

Spectators didn’t have time to take a good look since they started losing control of their body. They floated upward, seemingly ascending and becoming immortals.

“What’s wrong with me?!” Someone shouted after losing control of their grand dao.

Anyone would be scared out of their mind after experiencing this since it left them fully vulnerable.

“Pop!” The figure entered the gate and the flowers disappeared.

Everyone regained control of the grand dao again. They felt like fish caught by a hook and were finally released back into the water just now. This left them drenched in a cold sweat. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Paramount Goddess!” An old ancestor stood there in a daze.

“That was her?!” Those near him blurted out in astonishment since this title was known by all.

“Yes, a supreme beauty back in her generation.” The dazed ancestor said.

“The previous priestess of Ancestral Divine Temple.” Another added.
