Chapter 4869: Current Situation

“Since His Majesty is no longer around, Wild will strike us.” Northern Monarch worried. Currently, they were no match for Wild.

“In my opinion, they will attack during your coronation.” She added.

Wild Dragon was fierce with six sacred fruits. Only a few beings in the lower continents could fight him - the late Eight-stallion, Conceal, and Stone Ox of Untethered.

The problem was Wild Dragon’s ace card - being able to run back to Demon whenever he wanted. This made him invulnerable, the reason why Eight-stallion couldn’t kill him after one thousand years.

Venerable Dragon God was strong but couldn’t beat Wild Dragon. Moreover, there were two other members of the Ten Monsters on the side of Wild Dynasty - Flame-eater Child and Mad Pyromancer.

This made it rather difficult for the current Eight-stallion Dynasty. In the past, only Deity could contest with it since it had the dragon god, Northern Monarch, and two more members of the Ten Monsters - ninth-ranked Demoness and tenth-ranked Monochromatic Master.

Wild was only slightly weaker but now, the tides have turned.

“If they want to come, let them.” Li Qiye smiled: “My coronation is a joyous occasion so the more, the merrier. Let’s all have fun together.”

Northern Monarch had no response. These guests from Wild were coming to destroy Li Qiye, not to celebrate with him.

That day might end with Eight-stallion Dynasty being left with mountains of corpses and rivers of blood.

She could tell that Li Qiye was neither an idiot nor a madman. This meant that he had enough power to prevent any mishap. Alas, he seemed to be an ordinary cultivator and his opponent was an entire dynasty.

“Just Wild Dragon alone can destroy all of us. I and the dragon god cannot stop him.” She said: “Plus, our dynasty lacks solidarity. The human heart is unpredictable once trouble comes knocking.”

This was not a problem when the dao lord was alive. The two members remained obedient in that scenario. The same couldn’t be said now and they might betray the dynasty.

“As I’ve said, we should be happy that so many guests are coming.” Li Qiye chuckled.

She simply didn’t understand. There was not an ounce of worry in him as if he had everything under control. 

After finishing their conversation, she left to meet Venerable Dragon God.

He was staying in a temple named War God that float among the clouds. He looked down at the dynasty, pondering. His breath and aura engulfed the land and commanded respect.

The dynasty required a powerful existence like him. The inhabitants could breathe easily in his presence. Though the dao lord was no longer around, they still had a five-sacred-fruit cultivator left.

Northern Monarch climbed up the stairs and saw him sitting imposingly on his chair.

“Dragon God.” She bowed.

He told a disciple to bring a chair over for her and said: “Northern Monarch, you have been working hard for the dynasty, so much traveling.”

“It’s not tiring at all. The only shameful thing is that I didn’t accomplish anything and let His Majesty down.” She shook her head.

“It is to be expected. His Majesty already knew that this would happen. The academy hasn’t done anything for eras now.” He sighed softly.

“Let’s talk.” She said.

He waved his hand and the disciples nearby left the two alone.

“Dragon God, what is your opinion on the new successor?” Northern Monarch asked.

He stared at her in silence.

She shuddered and became serious: “Dragon God, we have followed His Majesty together for so long. I won’t waste your time. Just answer this, will you support the new king?”

Her support alone was not enough. In fact, it was meaningless without his support. Not to mention fighting Wild Dynasty, they wouldn’t even be able to deal with him since he was the strongest and had authority over the army.

She stared intensely at him and prepared for battle if he were to refuse. Of course, she would also be his first target if he harbored any plan regarding the throne.

“What is your stance, Monarch?” He asked, aware of her potential. There was no doubt that she would be able to surpass him in the future.

If they could somehow survive the incoming attack, she would become a strong pillar for the dynasty in the future. Dealing with Wild Dynasty wouldn’t be a problem at all at that point.

“I support the new king.” She didn’t hide her decision: “He needs your support as well. This is how you can fulfill His Majesty’s last wish.”

The dragon god sighed and said: “My support alone is not enough to convince the others. The fate of the dynasty is hanging by a thread.”

“I’m aware that we have problems internally and externally.” She elaborated: “But, as long as we maintain solidarity, we can handle internal problems. If we can’t even fulfill His Majesty’s last wish, how will we keep the dynasty going?”

“If only others share the same feeling as you. I’m afraid they do not want the same thing.” The dragon god said.

“Those who disagree… we must eliminate.” She answered strongly.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Is that the right way to convince people of the new king?” He asked.
