Chapter 4486: Living Person

“So a living person.” Li Qiye’s interest increased after hearing this.

“Yes, in my opinion, she has been sealed for many eras now.” The daoist said.

“So what if she’s still alive? Do you recognize her or something?” Jian Ming asked.

“I do not, but that is precisely the crux of the issue.” The daoist said.

Jian Ming became confused and asked: “What does it reveal? Is there something special about this girl? Does she have three heads and six hands?”

“No.” The daoist flatly answered.

Jian Ming shrugged and said: “Well, Grotto Courtyard is a big market and has auctioned countless items so far. This girl is no different and one shouldn’t be surprised anymore at their offerings.”

“No, there is something different about this girl, absolutely different.” The daoist glanced at him and said.

“What is it?” Jian Ming could tell that the daoist was serious.

“Wait, my information network is impeccable. I should have heard something if there was a top item at Grotto Courtyard, there is no way that you know more than me.” He added.

“Ah!” He clapped and continued: “I see, you’ve been keeping an eye out on Grotto Courtyard, wanting to get your grubby hands dirty and this girl is your target!”

“Eat shit all you want but don’t spew bullshit!” The daoist said: “I am a man with a reputation, don’t besmirch my name.”

“What reputation?” Jian Ming said: “You want our young noble to go there and potentially cause a diversion for you to take advantage of!”

“He already tried before and failed.” Li Qiye revealed.

“Did you hear that? Such a nice reputation you have.” Jian Ming said.

“Shh! The daoist became startled and started shushing him: “Are you tired of living?! If the courtyard catches wind of this, they’ll feed us to the fish!”

“That’s your problem, I didn’t try to steal from them so only you will be fish food.” Jian Ming said.

The daoist’s anger ignited towards Jian Ming again.

Jian Ming continued: “I recall how you bragged about your grasping art. How are you going to steal from True Immortal when you can’t even get something from the courtyard? That’s suicidal.”

“You give it a shot then.” The daoist said: “The Seal Ancestor’s tentacles are everywhere in the courtyard and will know the moment you set foot in there. He’ll put you in an aquatic illusion before you know it.”

“Seal Ancestor might not be the strongest but he does have absolute control in Grotto Courtyard.” Wise Ancestor nodded and interjected.

“I see, so you got caught before, haha!” Jian Ming gloated on someone else’s misery.

“If it was you, you would be down in the pond right now instead of standing here.” The daoist boasted about surviving.

After all, escaping from Seal Ancestor was indeed impressive. He escaped unscathed and the ancestor didn’t see his identity in time either.

“The courtyard has no lack of peerless treasures, why do you pay so much attention to the fossil?” Jian Ming changed the topic. He has been to the courtyard before and knew about its wondrous treasury.

“From fortune-telling, of course.” Li Qiye smiled.

The daoist smiled wryly and told the truth: “Nothing can hide from your eyes, Great Immortal.”

“What did it tell you?” Jian Ming no longer doubted the daoist’s fortune-telling ability. He saw the process earlier and knew how impressive it was. Thus, there must be a reason why the fossil was special.

“I’m not sure, it’s hard to say.” The daoist shook his head and then stared at Li Qiye: “The fortune was very chaotic and blindingly bright. The images weren’t sequential, they reversed and looped randomly. In my opinion, this girl might not be from this epoch.”

“To Grotto Courtyard then. We’re taking a look.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I will lead the way, Great Immortal.” The daoist excitedly said.

They were supposed to go to the Yu but Li Qiye chose to put that matter aside. Nonetheless, Jian Ming was happy to oblige.

He and the daoist led the way, standing to shoulder. Jian Ming smiled and said: “Tell me more about this girl, what does she look like? Any special visual phenomena?”

“No idea.” The daoist didn’t want to answer. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Haha, Daoist, don’t be so difficult, maybe we’ll be working together later.” Jian Ming was very curious because of Li Qiye’s interest in the girl.

“Is that so?” The daoist glanced at him, acting superior since he had the advantage.

“Brother.” Jian Ming inched in even closer and whispered: “Let’s talk business, shall we?.”

“Go on.” The daoist asked.

“You use fortune to find the next target, right?” Jian Ming whispered again and got straight to the point.

“And?” The daoist said.

Jian Ming smiled and went on: “Then you should expand your business.”

“What business?” The daoist was at a loss.

“Brother, think about it, stealing is so risky. Once caught, you’ll be pursued by thousands of cultivators. Some of your targets may be just as strong as True Immortal.” Jian Ming elaborated.

“What are you trying to say?” This piqued the daoist’s interest.

“Change it up, no more doing business with living people.” Jian Ming whispered.
