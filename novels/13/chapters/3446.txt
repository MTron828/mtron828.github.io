In the next few days, Ancestral City became lively due to an influx of visitors. The ancestors and geniuses from the big sects appeared one after another.

News and rumors spread like wildfires during this period. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“The treasury of Immortal Assailant Emperor is appearing.” This particular one became well-known, stirring all listeners.

Initially, only the ancestors of the big sects were privy to this information. Their sects immediately considered this top secret and didn’t divulge it to anyone.

Now, it suddenly became public knowledge.

“That mythical emperor?” One expert took a deep breath and said.

“Who else can it be? There’s only one Immortal Assailant Emperor. This treasury should be incredible because the emperor was one of the most brilliant of them all.” A friend replied.

No one could resist the temptation of this possibility so they came to Ancestral City in droves.

This great emperor was historically famous. Thus, the remnant treasury should be peerless, to say the least. Any power obtaining it would enjoy an immense boost in potential. No one would miss this opportunity.

“The great emperor fought against the calamity in the legends. Can you even imagine the things in this treasury?” Hearts palpitated from excitement.

According to the legends, the emperor existed before Eight Desolaces and was unbeatable. There was a battle against a heavenly corpse as well. Some even listed the emperor among the top three of all Grand Emperors. [1]

This peerless emperor didn’t leave behind a system or any legacy. This made the treasury even more tempting.

“Maybe it has all the emperor’s merit laws.” One expert speculated.

“I think there’s more than that, maybe supreme treasures, perhaps a patrimony weapon! If I can get that, I’ll sweep through Eight Desolaces uncontested...” Another had a bold thought.

“In the legends, the emperor even had items from the high heaven, coveted by future dao lords. Maybe those items will be in this treasury too.” A history buff added.

“What are those things?” Someone heard this for the first time.

“I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before but they’re far superior to patrimony weapons from dao lords. It is said that with them, one would reach invincibility, able to punish heaven and suppress hell, killing dao lords shouldn’t be a problem. Its power is beyond imagination.” The first commenter replied.

“There’s something that strong?” People shuddered after hearing this.

Dao lord weapons were powerful enough. Patrimony weapons took it to the next level. Now, these artifacts from the high heaven were superior to the point of being able to kill dao lords?

That would shatter everyone’s common sense.

Some listeners swallowed their saliva. A few even swore to do everything they can for it.

“So where’s the treasury?” Scouts and cavalries roamed the city in search of the location.

“The treasury might be in the stone forest.” Sure enough, their effort was rewarded and this information became known.

Who knows if someone purposely gave out this information or they managed to convince an ancestor to tell them?

“Hmm, it’s not that easy getting there.” Someone murmured after hearing this.

“Yes, it changes every second, always. Just one wrong step and you can get lost. I went there more than ten times but never made it.” Another who has been there before became worried.

“Well, let’s go take a look first, maybe we’ll get lucky.” Nonetheless, most became restless and ran towards this area.

While the crowd was occupied with this, explosions detonated above. A large cavalry arrived; each soldier had intense bloodlust. Their armor reflected sunlight in a blinding manner. They looked like an armored dragon occupying the sky.

To the front were several chariots grinding down space. A gray-haired old man with a frightening aura stood on top of one.

“The Dragon Cavalry from Skylight.” One spectator shouted.

“Their royal troops...” Everyone took a deep breath.

“Skylight truly wants this treasury then.” Someone murmured.

This cavalry was one of the country’s strongest, mainly serving as a defensive force with numerous outstanding feats. Their appearance here caught everyone off guard.

Next came buzzing noises stemming from divine swords materializing up above. They spread out like a peacock’s tail and illuminated the horizon. The entire realm became trapped in this boundless sword domain.

It culminated into a river of swords right above Ancestral City. Each sword was ridden by an expert. They all emitted considerable sword energy.

“Firmaments Formation.” A keen observer recognized them.

The ancestors from Ancestral put on a serious expression at this sight.

“Their strongest formation, are they attacking?” One pale spectator shouted; his fear was justified.

Many thought that Firmaments Gate was attacking Ancestral City.

“No way, they have a strong relationship. Remember, Firmaments Heavenly Sovereign learned a grand dao from the park to become powerful. Plus, he’s a golem too and viewed this city as holy ground. How could Firmaments attack Ancestral?” A knowledgeable expert shook his head.

He was completely right. The sword riders bowed their head towards the city to show respect.

“Boom!” They released chaos true energy to create an auspicious rain that satisfied the land below.

“It’s a greeting.” People understood their intent.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The river of divine swords then flowed towards the stone forest.

“They’re here for the treasury too.” Another murmured after seeing this.

“Seems like Firmaments is determined to compete against others. They must have it.” His friend replied.

The moment they were gone, the yin and yang suddenly emerged and drowned the city.

“Again?” A spectator became startled.

The yin and yang started transforming and turned into a temporal affinity. One could see the past and the future there.

A group came out from this affinity with a powerful and dominating presence.

“Yin Yang Gate!” This was rather obvious for the spectators.

“Seems like a big conflict is inevitable over that treasure.” Another murmured.

“There’s no way they would miss it. They’re the strongest in the north.” Someone responded.

The ones affected the most by their arrival were the competitors.

Skylight Dragon Cavalry, Firmaments with their strongest formation, and Yin Yang Gate.

How could they hope to compete against these behemoths for the treasury?
