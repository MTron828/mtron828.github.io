Chapter 5759: Only This Place Can Bury You

“The path I’ve walked has no room for regrets, it was my choice.” Li Qiye said to Ling’er.

She stared directly at him while contemplating the possibilities. Perhaps her mortal life was a thousand songs but just one melody.

“I agree.” She took a deep breath and said.

“What makes you come to this decision?” He asked.

“I saw the stars, and I must see them again.” She gritted her teeth and clenched her fists.

After seeing her firm expression, he sighed softly: “Saw the stars and now your eyes are filled with them. Let’s get started then, just know that the outcome might not be what you expect.”

“I still agree.” She took a deep breath.

Primordial laws resembling spirit serpents coiled around his raised fingertip.

“Pop!” They entered her forehead, causing her to tremble.

A mortal’s sea of consciousness should be tiny. In this case, the laws broke down numerous barriers.

“Crack!” Her mind, on the other hand, was massive and contained countless memories.

Images appeared - both realistic and dream-like. In one scene, she was a rich noble girl. In another, just a poor daughter of a woodcutter. The third had her sitting on the throne as an empress...

“Buzz.” Her mind was fully exposed, revealing all the hidden memories.

“Buzz.” Golden waves emanated from her chest and a seal appeared.

It wasn’t imprinted on her skin but rather, her life itself. In the case of physical destruction and death, the seal could still bring her back.

It resembled a full moon with a hole in the center with thorn-like serrations, seemingly a unique symbol. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He touched it and it started rotating, seemingly awakening with a power to enforce perpetuity.

“Perpetual Seal.” He sighed, gaining more information about this issue.

“I know where it is.” She opened her eyes and tears streamed down her cheeks.

“This is the tradeoff for finding the truth, and it’s only the beginning. Do you still wish to continue?” He wiped her tears and said.

“I do.” She somehow became more unyielding, no longer the weak girl just a moment ago.

He nodded and no longer tried to stop her.

“Is everything true?” She asked.

“Yes.” He sighed and nodded.

“So it’s reincarnation in that mortal world?” She asked again.

“A true death will not have reincarnation, it is only a concept. However, there are methods and treasures capable of adhering someone to the world.” He said.

“Why was I chosen?” She didn’t understand.

“It might not be due to malice, perhaps out of love.” He said sincerely.

“Love?” Her thoughts drifted somewhere else for a moment upon hearing this.

“Is it him, the man who brought me to see the stars?” She murmured.

He nodded again.

“Will I be able to see him?” She stared at Li Qiye.

“As long as he agrees.” He said.

“Will you help bring me to him?” She asked.

“If that is your wish, you won't need me, you alone will suffice.” He gently touched her forehead.

She fell into silence for a moment before telling him: “I know where it is, I’ll show you.”

The group then headed to the cemetery. It wasn’t far from her home but this distance wasn’t possible for a mortal.

It appeared to be a plain surrounded by mountains and rivers, embracing the cemetery.

There were no expensive ornaments and decorations, only a single unpolished slab serving as a tombstone.

Ling’er seemed to be struck by lightning the moment she saw the tomb because of the characters engraved on it - Ling’er.

There was no other inscription. The characters seemed to be the work of someone extraordinary, granting them an eternal affinity.

Although she had mentally prepared herself, seeing it in person still shocked her.

“This... this is my grave?” Her fingers trembled as she touched the characters.

If she was buried here, then how could she still be alive? Was she just a ghost?

“Why was I left here all alone to reincarnate repeatedly?” She shuddered.

“The person who buried you here didn’t want you to be alone, but this is the only place that can bury you.” Li Qiye consoled her and gently patted her head.

“Why doesn’t he come to stay with me?” She couldn’t help but shed tears.

“Because he can’t.” Li Qiye sighed.

“Why not... why not...?” She murmured.

Li Qiye didn’t answer this time because he wasn’t the one who did it.

“If this is the truth, I just want to live one lifetime, that’s enough...” She caressed the tomb.

“But there is someone who wanted you to live forever, perhaps at any cost.” Li Qiye showed a hint of emotion while looking at the tomb.
