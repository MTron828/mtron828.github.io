Chapter 618: Personally Visiting The Humble Abode

Alchemists were able to cultivate materials and craft fate pills, longevity medicines, physique pastes, and various ointments. In short, things that any sect would always need, and many of these items were always in short supply.

Thus, one could imagine just how popular alchemists were. This was the case for the other worlds as well since there were less alchemists in those places and their system had yet to be as flourished and developed.

Because of this, the status of alchemists in the Stone Medicine World was much higher than that in the other worlds. Moreover, this world also produced more Alchemy Emperors.

“There are many strange things in this world.” Regarding the monarch’s worries, Bai Weng had such a conjecture: “Extraordinary people have their own train of thought; Young Noble Li’s skill is enough to sweep over this world. Perhaps he considers power and fame to be useless since he can obtain whatever he wants already. With a swing of his hand, countless people would want to offer him gifts and treasures. Maybe because of this, he got tired of rowdy places.”

The Demon Monarch became worried from this: “If this was the case, then what do we have to hold him down? If he has such abilities, then not mentioning the great powers, even imperial lineages would want him as well. The Alchemy Kingdom would also be tempted. We don’t have any advantage compared to those monsters.”

Bai Weng became spirited when this issue was brought up: “We can’t guess how these extraordinary people think. Back in the county, there is an envoy named Shi Hao. This kid is very honest and hardworking and has always wanted to become a powerful alchemist. I think Young Noble Li is staying here because he wants to teach this boy. I heard Shi Hao say that Young Noble Li was teaching him pill refinement. Even if the young noble doesn’t want to take him as a disciple, he is still training the boy.”

Bai Weng paused for a bit and continued: “I have asked Young Noble Li before. He wants to take a trip to the capital once. We can just introduce him to Her Majesty at that time. Whether this endeavor is successful or not, it’ll be up to Her Majesty.”

“Very well, how can we let go of such a powerful alchemist?” The demon monarch solemnly said: “I’ll personally go and pay my respects to him!”

Initially, Bai Weng wanted to recommend a young alchemist to Her Majesty, but he was astonished after seeing Li Qiye’s abilities. He knew that Li Qiye had the qualifications to act arrogantly, and whether he would stay at the Giant Bamboo Country to be an alchemist was dependent on his whims!

Such a great alchemist would have sects scrambling for his attention, so Bai Weng became even more determined to persuade the demon monarch so that he would ask Her Majesty to recruit a supreme alchemist like Li Qiye.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye continued his normal and relaxing life back at Jadeblood Mountain. He wanted to stay at the Giant Bamboo Country for a while as well as to take a look at the capital and the palace.

Under Li Qiye’s guidance, Shi Hao mustered all of his effort into pill refinement. Although he was a simple fellow, he still knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; he wouldn’t be able to find another such wise teacher once Li Qiye leaves. As Li Qiye repeatedly demonstrated the methods, Shi Hao didn’t dare to miss a single detail.

Bai Weng returned the next day with a companion.

Bai Weng and the Ancient Pine Demon Monarch both came to Jadeblood Mountain and noticed that the vegetation here along the mountains were full of life. The Jadeblood Bamboo planted here happily swayed back and forth as if they had come to life.

This was not strange at all. The Ancient Pine Demon Monarch was initially a pine tree, so he was very close with the flora. His arrival was naturally sensed by the vegetation on the mountain.

Shi Hao was frightened at the monarch’s arrival. He had been an envoy for a long time but had only seen the monarch once. But now, the monarch was actually here at Jadeblood Mountain — this was something Shi Hao wouldn’t have dreamt of before.

“You must be County Envoy Shi Hao?” The monarch revealed a friendly smile to Shi Hao.

The monarch ruled an entire prefecture that consisted of countless envoys, so his personal greeting left Shi Hao aghast.

Shi Hao eventually calmed down and quickly answered: “My lord, that is me.”

The demon monarch didn’t act condescendingly at all as he politely said: “We are here to visit Young Noble Li.”

Shi Hao didn’t dare to waste time and quickly led the two of them to see Li Qiye.

Inside the room, Li Qiye was still nonchalant after seeing a big shot like the demon monarch. To him, the monarch was not a big shot at all since he had seen too many true grand characters.

“Young Noble Li’s visit to the Giant Bamboo Country is our honor.” The monarch hastily said upon their meeting.

“The Giant Bamboo Country is indeed a place worth remembering.” Li Qiye replied with a smile.

The demon monarch placed an ancient box in front of Li Qiye: “This visit was in a hurry so I couldn’t prepare a big present. I have this little thing here and hope that Young Noble Li won’t laugh.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Li Qiye looked at the box and didn’t move at all. He simply nodded and said: “I accept your goodwill, so I will accept this gift as well.”

The demon monarch heaved a sigh of relief after seeing Li Qiye accept the present. It would be quite a bad start if Li Qiye were to reject the gift.

The monarch was old and experienced, thus his dealings were meticulous and well thought out as he said: “County Envoy Shi Hao had contributed a lot to the Stonetreading County; he is dutiful and dedicated. I didn’t bring too many things on this trip, but I do have a little gift for you.”

Shi Hao was stunned as he accepted the gift from the monarch. He was only a small character, an ordinary envoy, so receiving a gift from the monarch was an impossible matter, something beyond his wildest dreams!

The demon monarch went on to say: “Our Majesty adores talents and I heard that Young Noble Li intends to visit the capital once. How about we go to the capital together so I can take you to see Her Majesty? I wonder if this would be acceptable to you?”

The Ancient Pine Demon Monarch was a man of high position; how could he be so deferential to an ordinary young cultivator? His respectful attitude astonished Shi Hao, but he slowly got used to it. He understood that Li Qiye was an extremely amazing alchemist.

Li Qiye didn’t refuse and nodded his head: “Very well, we can go take a look at the capital. Shi Hao will come with me.”

Prior to this, he intended to stay at Jadeblood Mountain for some time to teach Shi Hao pill refinement, but now Li Qiye had decided to take him to the capital.

“I...” Shi Hao was stunned since he had never been to the capital before.

It was a long journey from the Stonetreading County to the Giant Bamboo Country’s capital. How long would it take for someone with Shi Hao’s cultivation to get there? It was nearly impossible unless an expert decided to bring him along.

“That’s good, that’s good. Shi Hao should go take a look at the capital for more experience and broadening his horizons.” Bai Weng added. He could tell that Li Qiye wanted to groom Shi Hao.

Li Qiye nodded his head and said: “Then it is decided.”

Shi Hao couldn’t contain his excitement since he never thought he would have an opportunity to visit the capital. This was one of his aspirations — to visit the heart of the Giant Bamboo Country!

After Li Qiye made his decision, the demon monarch couldn’t help but rub his hands together in hesitation: “Young Noble Li...”

Li Qiye raised his brows and said: “Say what you want to say.”

The demon monarch wryly laughed and said: “Recently, I have been collecting ingredients for a six transformations fate pill. I’ve been wanting to refine one to increase my cultivation, but I hadn’t met the right alchemist. It is fate that we met today, so I wonder if you can refine a six transformations fate pill for me?”

He quickly added right after: “As for the payment, Young Noble Li can just say it.”

Six transformations pills were meant for Heavenly Sovereigns. The demon monarch had cultivated for several thousand years, but his cultivation had been stuck at this bottleneck and couldn’t reach the World Sovereign level.

Li Qiye glanced at him and asked: “Is this a test?”

“No, no, please don’t misunderstand!” The monarch quickly waved his hands in denial and said: “If you don’t want to, then just pretend like I never said anything. That was not my intention at all, it is just that I want the pill badly enough that I couldn’t help but ask for your assistance.”

Whether the monarch’s cautious and respectful attitude were for show or were actually from the bottom of his heart, it was still the same case. At this moment, he didn’t want to annoy Li Qiye, a supreme alchemist that the Giant Bamboo Country could only wish for!

“Fine, it doesn’t matter if it is a test or your desire for the pill.” Li Qiye said: “Since you showed respect, I will refine one for free this time. Luckily for you, you only want a six transformations pill. I would have asked for a sky high price for one with seven transformations. A fate pill of that level would bring along a tribulation after all, so I wouldn’t help just anyone.”

Six transformations pills were for Heavenly Sovereigns, and seven transformations pills were for Heavenly Kings. At the latter level, pill refinement would bring along quite a terrifying tribulation for the alchemist.

Because of this, fate pills of seven or more transformations had prohibitive pricing that only Heavenly Kings or Virtuous Paragons could afford.
