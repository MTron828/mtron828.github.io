Chapter 5515: Shaming The Ancestor

“What are you waiting for, brat? Accept your death if you have nothing to say!” Shaoyun said with murderous intent while looking at the goddess’ expression toward Li Qiye.

“Fool, you are throwing away your ancestor’s face. I will educate you all in her stead.” Li Qiye said before raising one hand into the air.

“Buzz.” Everyone felt as if the valley was sinking and that they were standing on water.

Rays emanated from all corners of the manor and turned into the image of a paradisical sunset. Dao laws came from every brick and tile, eventually gathering together to form a scripture.

Everyone could sense its power and lost control of their own dao. Their dao harmonized and released their power. This included mighty existences such as the goddess and Qin Baifeng.

“Rumble!” The manor seemingly disappeared, replaced by a boundless grand dao.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This made the crowd want to kowtow as if their ancestor was now before them.

“The true scripture left behind by our ancestor…” Some murmured in a daze.

Li Qiye casually flipped his hand and special runes appeared on the scripture. They flew out in the direction of Shaoyun’s visual phenomenon, embedding themselves into certain spots and exposing flaws.

Due to the imperfection in his dao, his dao laws were instantly nullified.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” After loud explosions, the overall phenomenon collapsed and he could do nothing to stabilize.

“Boom!” The final blast sent him flying out of the town while vomiting blood. He flew and flew before hitting a peak.

Everyone was left speechless. Li Qiye didn’t do anything, only revealing the innate flaws and instability of his dao. Alas, this nearly killed Shaoyun.

They then stared at the scripture in his hand - the very treasure left behind by Cloudsweep Fairy.

No one had been able to summon it in history. Since they couldn’t truly understand the mantra, they had no way of seeing the real scripture.

The goddess and Qin Baifeng realized how far they were from true mastery over the scripture.

“Is that real…?” A female disciple murmured in disbelief. An outsider had done something unprecedented.

“How did he do it? He trained with the scripture too?” Another asked because this had to be the case. However, an outsider certainly didn’t have access to it.

“The arrogance.” Li Qiye shook his head and dropped the scripture. It dispersed into particles and runes, returning to the manor once more.

No one uttered a single word. Li Qiye had mentioned them only learning the “bare surface” previously or even worse. They once took it as an insult but now, he had summoned the real scripture - something their senior sisters couldn’t do.

They were utterly convinced by his ability and thought that he had the right to make those comments.

With the scripture returning to the manor, the visual phenomenon disappeared as well.

“Young Noble, this is more than just having a fateful connection with our sect. You are basically our lord.” The goddess sighed and said.

“The valley is meant to be governed by all of you, I am just a passerby.” He said.

“I would argue otherwise.” The goddess thought differently.

Meanwhile, Qin Baifeng was at a loss for words. Only the goddess was calm enough to have a conversation.

“Young Noble, since you can summon the true scripture easily, you must know the secret left behind by our ancestor as well.” She said with a smile.
