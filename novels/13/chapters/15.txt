The Immortal Bone Mirror revealed itself. The shiny glass had flowing immortal patterns that exuded an aura of a living creature. Even Yu He was fearful of its power.

The Immortal Bone Mirror flashed on the body of Li Qiye, forcing his life wheel and fate palace to appear. His life wheel slowly turned with a lack of pressure, and his fate palace had not yet been opened.

Yu He concluded: “He has a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and a Mortal Fate Palace that has not been opened; he has not started cultivating. Also, there are no hidden treasures on his body.”

The lowest level of cultivation was the Palace Foundation level. Once one started to cultivate, even the lowest of talents could open their fate palace in one day if fast, ten days if slow.

Under the gaze of the Immortal Bone Mirror, Li Qiye couldn’t hide anything. All that he is was revealed to the eyes of the spectators.

Protector Mo solemnly questioned: “Protector Hua, Protector Yu, are you satisfied now?” Being subjected to the Immortal Bone Mirror was a shameful matter to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Our apologies.” Yu He was a man of character. He nodded his head and politely said: “Li Qiye did not cheat.”

After hearing the confirmation from Yu He, the crowd had no more comments to make. They couldn’t believe that a mortal with these characteristics was able to pass the forest.

Xu Hui was the most devastated of them all: “But how can this be true!”

Li Qiye leered at him and spoke: “It seems that you are not convinced, but that is quite alright. I will make it so that you will crawl without hesitation. It is a mere Chaotic Heart Forest, only an idiot like you would barely reach level seven. Open your eyes to see your grandpa go once again.”

After his taunt, Li Qiye entered the forest once more.

All eyes were intensely focused on the forest, no one wanted to miss a single detail. They wanted to reach a logical conclusion that their minds could accept. If Li Qiye succeeds again, then they would have no choice but to change their view of the world. But if he failed, then all was good with the world.

“Level fourteen!” Nan Huairen was keeping count as Li Qiye went through the levels. Even though this was the second time, he was just as shocked as the first.

Yu He truly understood now. Although Li Qiye’s cultivation aptitude and physique could not reach the apex, he possessed unfaltering willpower. A thirteen-year-old had a stronger mind that he did after a thousand years of cultivation.

“Start crawling.” Li Qiye came back and mischievously spread his legs in front of Xu Hui.

“You!” Xu Hui trampled the ground in shame and his expression turned pure white. If he had to crawl beneath Li Qiye in front of all these spectators, then he would lose all face in the future.

“Our Nine Saint Demon Gate has our honor. If you lose a bet, you have to bear the consequences.” Yu He nodded: “Xu Hui, you were the one who wanted this bet in the first place. Now carry out your end of the bargain.”

Xi Hui almost fainted on the spot. If Protector Yu had spoken, then even his master could not save him. He ground his teeth and unwillingly knelt before Li Qiye. His body froze for a minute; this was the most shameful event of his life.

Eventually, he started to crawl through Li Qiye’s legs. Li Qiye looked down and spoke: “When people show me an ounce of respect, I will treat them well, but if anyone dares to cross me, then I will repay them tenfold. A genius disciple of the Nine Saint Demon Gate is nothing in my eyes!”

Finished speaking, Li Qiye turned around and walked away.

“Ugh!” Xu Hui fell down to the ground. He puked out blood from anger and went unconscious.

“Hui’er!” Protector Hua quickly grabbed Xu Hui and massaged his meridians.

After returning to the pavilion, Protector Hua and Yu He found their seats. Li Qiye was already sitting there arrogantly like a king. This made the other disciples feel the urge to beat him up.

Protector Hua leered at Li Qiye with great hatred in his eyes. When the master’s disciple was shamed, of course they would share the enemy. Shaming his disciple was the same as slapping him in the face.

Li Qiye playfully knocked on the table and said: “The first test has been completed, let us get started with the second.”

Before, Yu He thought that Li Qiye was ignorantly arrogant. However, after having thought about it again, maybe he had some secret tricks.

A mortal without the basics of cultivation... what was his backing that allowed for him to challenge the Nine Saint Demon Gate? Could it be that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still had hidden secrets not yet revealed?

Yu He quickly dismissed his last thought. As the grand protector, he was fully aware of the current position of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. If it had any secrets left, then it wouldn’t be submitting to the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.

The second piece of information was that Li Qiye had only joined the sect for a few days, and he forcefully used the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order to become the prime disciple. Even the six elders there did not welcome him.

Yu He had no idea what hidden mysteries this person was hiding, especially when he didn’t have any support.

Returning to the matter at hand, Yu He clearly spoke: “Right now, Xu Hui is not in his best condition. If you want to take the test, then we will have to change your opponent.”

“Honorable Protector, I am fine.” Xu Hui, all of a sudden, stood up straight. Despite his pale complexion, he violently leered at Li Qiye; a killing intent could be found in his eyes. He swore to himself that he would be the one to kill Li Qiye and use his blood to wash away his shame.

He used his proud posture to maintain and announce his confidence. He lifted his head high and proclaimed: “Protector, I can still fight!”

Yu He slightly frowned. He knew exactly what Xu Hui was thinking, so he gently spoke: “Junior Xu, your current condition is not fit for combat.”

This matter was very important for the Nine Saint Demon Gate, and Li Qiye had already won the first match.

“Senior Yu, this kid has a strong will, a minor setback will not deter him. Please give him another chance.” Protector Hua tried to support his disciple’s wish.

Xu Hui ground his teeth and said with extreme determination: “Protector, if I make a single mistake, I will pay for it with my life.”

Yu He contemplated for a moment. Within the younger disciples, Xu Hui had reached Heaven’s Mandate and was close to the Warrior Canopy stage. It would be difficult to find another who was as strong as him. Plus, his cultivation included the life wheel technique “Fierce Slaughter Sword.”

Yu He understood the strength of this technique; it was created by a Virtuous Paragon of their sect. If Xu Hui used his life wheel without hesitation, then none of his peers would be able to defeat him in a life or death contest, barring the strongest ones. If Xu Hui didn’t fight, then the safe choices would be Li Shuangyan or Leng Chengfeng. However, those two weren’t options they could choose.

Yu He was no longer underestimating Li Qiye, but he couldn’t think of a way for a mortal to defeat a Heaven’s Mandate cultivator with a Virtuous Paragon technique.

“Good, you will fight then!” After careful consideration, he agreed with the choice of Xu Hui.
