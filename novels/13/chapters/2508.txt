This victory from Tang Hexiang earned him some admiration from the crowd. They were shaken by his current power.

“Definitely strong, perhaps enough to fight against Eight Formation True Emperor, unlike most others.” One expert said sentimentally.

Although his despicable sneak-attack earned him the contempt of the spectators earlier, they had to admit that this lowly man was quite powerful.

“Clank!” Hexiang pointed his spear straight at Li Qiye and looked down with an arrogant smile: “Such meager skills aren’t worth showing off.”

All eyes were on Li Qiye now. Of course, most didn’t think the king would lose since he was simply unfathomable. They were only curious about his next move.

“Shamelessly boasting when that’s all you got? Very well, behold what I can do.” Li Qiye smiled and slowly stood up.

“The king is finally getting serious now.” Everyone watched as he stood up with their eyes wide open. They didn’t want to miss a single action from him.

Hexiang was annoyed to see the attention the king was getting. In the past, he was the one in the spotlight, not this terrible king!

“The king is unfathomable, he’s about to shock everyone.” An ancestor said with a serious expression.

Someone else quietly brought up: “How many moves can Hexiang handle?”

“I’m guessing, around five. He’s fused with that formation so it’s not just his own power. Those elites are there too.” A young expert replied.

“Five moves? You think too highly of him. The saber saint gave up after three moves, and I don’t see how this guy is stronger than the saber saint who is a real ninth-level True God, and a strong one at that.” A different genius disagreed. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Hexiang naturally heard the comments as well so his face became quite ugly. Previously, whenever he made a move, everyone would be talking about how amazing he was as a genius and how they wanted to see his amazing techniques.

But now, it sounded as if he was so incapable. Others were actually looking down on him!

His eyes flashed with murderous intent as he threatened: “Li, don’t think about leaving this place alive today!”

Li Qiye stood there and dismissively waved: “Got your fill of threats yet? If you’re done, then get ready, once I make my move, you won’t even have the chance to retaliate.”

“Let’s see what you got!” Hexiang angrily roared.

“Boom!” His true energy erupted straight to the sky like a pillar. This pulsing mass of energy seemed to be shooting straight to space.

He exuded an endless light. Layers of gold metal materialized on the shield and made it bigger and thicker.

“Ra!” Same with his dragon spear. It also grew in size to become a weapon capable of piercing the firmaments.

“Boom!” The world quaked once as he chose a stance with the shield blocking in front and the spear in the thrusting position, parallel to his waist.

This stance was perfect since it consisted of both offense and defense.

“It’s about to happen, let’s see how strong Hexiang is really.” Some of the crowd praised him.

“Li, come now!” After gathering all of the true energy onto his body, he was confident in stopping a move or two from an Eternal.

Li Qiye smiled in response and flashed into nothingness. He was unreasonably fast and ended everything before the sound could catch up.

“Pop!” Space rippled from his speed exceeding all limits.

The realm trembled as time seemed to come to a halt.

Fear and nervousness permeated the spectators as they watched this still-image in disbelief - Li Qiye kneeing the gigantic shield.

It instantly collapsed and Tang Hexiang’s gigantic body flipped over backward while vomiting blood.

“Boom!” A while later, the sound of the impact finally came about. Li Qiye had nearly exceeded time itself, creating an illusion of temporal stagnation and chaotic dimension.

Time began flowing again and the crowd finally captured these developments.

Hexiang landed on the lake, causing the entire mountain range to shake. Water splashed up everywhere like tidal waves before pouring down like rain.

He was floating on the surface; who knows if he was dead or alive?

Just a little while ago, people were still debating how many moves he could last. Some said five, others were less optimistic.

However, no one expected for the king to crush Hexiang’s shield and knocked him down with a single knee. This truly rendered them speechless.

Bingchi Hanyu was terrified to the very soul by Li Qiye’s power. This was the first time she had witnessed such a powerful man.

She thought that her fiance could sweep through the young generation, but this belief was being questioned right now. She felt the emperor being insignificant and weak while standing before Li Qiye.

Jianyao gently sighed, realizing that this story was over. The new king would be the ultimate supreme of Nine Secrets. He was only playing around earlier.

In this system, regardless of how brilliant and powerful one might be, they were just chess pieces on his board.

The saber saint forced a wry smile. Li Qiye was just toying with him earlier, showing mercy by letting him slash three times first. If Li Qiye were serious, he wouldn’t have been able to block a single move. Just one slash was enough to split him in two.

Though he wasn’t an arrogant person, he was certainly proud. Unfortunately, all of his achievements so far were trivial, virtually nothing compared to the king.
