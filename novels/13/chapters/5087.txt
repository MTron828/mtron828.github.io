Chapter 5088: One Punch Against Heaven Burial Conqueror

The smash didn’t stop at the ancestors and continued to break the mountain.

Cracks appeared everywhere on the surface. The power of a conqueror oozed out from the cracks along with chaos true energy.

There seemed to be a primordial source underneath - a wondrous concentration of energy.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“What a treasure ground, it is incredible.” A neutral big shot was left in awe.

In fact, not even Deity might have a treasure trove of this magnitude. This place made cultivation rather easy.

No wonder why their ancient ancestors all moved to the mountain to train after gaining the privilege.

“Boom!” A majestic figure emerged causing the three continents to shake.

Everyone felt this power regardless of distance and was forced to the ground. This included both dragon lords and conquerors. The moment he descended, he became the lord of all things.

Truth Conqueror and Thousand-faced Sovereign shuddered despite being far away from the battlefield.

“Heaven Burial Conqueror!” The sovereign trembled.

Heaven Burial - one of the strongest conquerors in history had sent a divine intent down to the sacred mountain.

“The progenitor didn’t forget about us!” Horrified disciples in the sect rejoiced. Their progenitor might actually be able to stop the villain.

“Progenitor!” They kneeled to the ground and tears flowed down their cheeks.

“Who are you?!” The divine intent opened his eyes. Just his gaze alone could kill anyone in this region.

“Boom!” Li Qiye answered with a punch.

He didn’t expect this and channeled his supreme arts to retaliate. Alas, this was useless.

Li Qiye’s punch represented the apex. All else were numerous levels beneath him. The punch pierced through Heaven Burial’s merit laws along with his head. It kept going, leaving a bottomless abyss in the center of the sacred mountain.

Spectators became speechless. Heaven Burial Conqueror was a legend. Although this was only a strand of divine intent, it was enough to deal with anyone in the lower continents.

In reality, it couldn’t block a single punch from Li Qiye. This result shocked everyone.

Members of Heaven Burial were as pale as death as they glanced around. Their spine seemed to be broken; their soul was no longer in their body. They either didn’t have the strength or the courage to get back up.

Li Qiye destroyed their ancient ancestors and dragon lords, even taking down their progenitor’s divine intent with a single punch.

Most importantly, he left irreversible damage on their sacred mountain - their spiritual totem. Their confidence and faith shattered as a result.

They didn’t have the courage to even stare at him even though he didn’t seem to have any intention of slaughtering the rest.

As for the big shots, they thought that this was more shocking than his victory over Conceal Conqueror.

***

After the destruction of the divine intent, a mighty figure suddenly stood up from his throne in an immortal palace floating among the stars. His wondrous eyes gazed down at the lower continents.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye ignored all of his and entered the massive hole in the mountain.

“What-what is he doing?” Spectators wondered.

“Is he trying to destroy Heaven Burial?” A big shot calmed down and said. This wouldn’t be difficult for him at all.

“What did they do to anger him?” A dragon lord wondered.

Back in the Ten Great Mountains, Skystomper God and his fellow brothers opposed Li Qiye. Alas, Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind. Now, something had infuriated him enough to warrant this onslaught.
