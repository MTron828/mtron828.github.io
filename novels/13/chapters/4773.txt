Chapter 4774: Another Li Qiye

This was something that could drive even the epoch lords crazy - one of the nine heavenly treasures, the Corporeal Zone.

Only a few in history managed to be in the presence of a heavenly treasure, let alone obtain it. They were born in primordial chaos and no other treasures could match them.

The previous master of the Corporeal Zone was none other than the Ancient Ming. This race was unstoppable and enslaved the nine worlds for eras. Even the races of the gods and devils lived like cowards during their brutal reign.

Outside of their unique bloodline, this treasure certainly aided their long-lasting supremacy. During this period, they were assaulted by new Immortal Emperors and top masters.

Alas, they managed to persevere and even took down some of their mighty pursuers. This required incredible power since the emperors were virtually the strongest cultivators outside of the hidden ones.

Eventually, the Dark Crow spent years formulating plans and winning battles with the help of his allies. The dynasty finally fell but the race survived due to the Corporeal Zone.

Subsequently, the Dark Crow had total control over the nine worlds yet still couldn’t eradicate them. Finally, with one final plan, he overcame the defensive nature of the treasure and wiped out the Ancient Ming.

Interestingly enough, this peerless treasure was never used to its fullest potential. Otherwise, the Ancient Ming might have been comparable to the true monsters looming above.

Its location was lost after the great calamity. Numerous sects sent out their disciples in search of the treasure only to fail.

As time passed, cultivators forgot about its existence. They viewed the nine treasures as mere legends, nothing more.

Only the dark overlords and those from the forbidden zones and burial grounds remembered this treasure.

They knew of its location but couldn’t obtain it. First, entering this area was challenging and perilous. Even if they got here, the presence of the skylight made it fatal.

They have lived a borrowed and pitiful life for billions of years. The high heaven would never miss the opportunity of reducing them to ashes.

Therefore, they exercised patience and didn’t pursue the Corporeal Zone. They waited until someone else could take it far away from the skylight.

After all, they didn’t lack time and had waited long enough. A bit longer didn’t matter to them.

At this time, Li Qiye turned his attention toward someone.

Yes, there was a person sitting in front of the Corporeal Zone with his back facing Li Qiye.

Anyone else would be completely shocked to see someone here. First, how did he even get to this unique location? Second, why didn’t he take the heavenly treasure away and dominate Eight Desolaces?

Li Qiye came closer and the person noticed the intruder, turning around slowly.

This painted an even more unbelievable scene. A third party’s eyes would shift back and forth between Li Qiye and this person, hoping to make head or tail out of this.

It turned out that this man was another Li Qiye.

“You’ve arrived.” The sitting Li Qiye stared at the newcomer and said.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye sat down, face to face, with himself.

Time came to a halt during this meeting. The two were identical enough that no one could tell them apart.

“Are you aware of the amount of suffering you have inflicted on me?” The second Li Qiye asked.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Yes, I’ve felt it too.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Carving yourself into the enemy and forcing the mind to believe it…” The second Li Qiye complained.

“I know.” Li Qiye said: “What happened to you also happened to me. Moreover, I was completely lucid.”

It turned out that the second Li Qiye was a strand of divine intent from the actual Li Qiye. The latter molded it into Bloodhand Butcher and forced it to believe that it was him. Next came the cruel torture sessions but the pain was felt by both of them.

“You were rather cruel to yourself.” The second Li Qiye said.

“If I couldn’t do that, it would have been a different path.” Li Qiye smiled bitterly.

“There is nothing wrong with that. As the saying goes - take care of yourself first before giving a damn about others.” The second Li Qiye said.

“True.” Li Qiye sighed and took a while before responding: “But, I prefer to do it my way.”

“My way.” The second Li Qiye murmured sentimentally.

“As long as I maintain my way and remember aspirations, I can handle any pain. Otherwise, I would become the same as the fallen dark overlords.” Li Qiye said.

“You do know they’re living rather well.” The second Li Qiye said.

“Right, but they have lost themselves.” Li Qiye nodded.
