The scene of Li Qiye being shot to death robbed the world of sounds. Everyone stood there, petrified, since a brilliant progenitor had just been ambushed.

A few glanced over at Flying Sword Marvel. Perhaps she could be the only half-step Everlasting to ever kill a progenitor in history.

“What, what a shame. An invincible progenitor can’t die in this manner.” One expert murmured.

How frustrating was it to accomplish so much then go down like this?

“The heaven is jealous of geniuses. He was too gifted.” One ancestor mourned.

Some big shots stared at the marvel with disdain. After all, she came from an orthodox sect but still resorted to this type of despicable method. This would ruin the reputation of her system.

“Too careless, simply too careless, and arrogant too. This is to be expected. He should have been ready for anything before performing this monumental task. That’s just how dangerous cultivation is, one can go down on this path at any time.” Another commented.

“Yes, Fiercest was too young and not prudent enough.” One more expert said.

On the other hand, Flying Sword Marvel didn’t care about any of this. She was overwhelmed with excitement and satisfaction while watching the falling corpse.

“It doesn’t matter who you are, opposing me will end with death.” She proudly said after an act of successful revenge.

No one said anything back despite not liking her action.

“You think too highly of yourself.” Suddenly, a casual voice sounded: “An insect with a sharp stinger is still only an insect. Wanting to kill a progenitor with just a progenitorial weapon? Ridiculous.”

A figure floated not far above the marvel right now.

“It’s Fiercest!” Many shouted.

“I knew he wouldn’t die so easily.” Some became excited, even those who didn’t like him.

For everyone here, a progenitor dying in battle to a stronger opponent was regrettable. But one dying to a weaker foe via ambush? That’s just embarrassing.

Li Qiye was bloodied with the arrow still stuck inside him. However, his expression remained as normal as can be.

“Impossible!” She jolted from fear, pale while staggering backward.

He finally pulled out the arrow and blood gushed out. The wound closed right away afterward.

“It would be a miracle of the ages if a single dragontooth arrow kills me.” Li Qiye threw the arrow and said.

He then stared at her and asked: “How do you want to die?”

By this point, she felt as if she had become nothing more than a walking corpse in his eyes. It’s just a matter of how.

The spectators knew that it was over for the marvel since Li Qiye survived. It didn’t matter that she was Luminous Master’s sister-in-law.

“No one will be able to protect her.” They thought, aware of Fiercest’s overbearing style.

“Go!” She still wished to struggle despite knowing the futility of it all and commanded. After all, no one wanted to wash their neck and obediently face the blade.

“Kill him!” Her group was absolutely loyal and rushed forward.

He didn’t bother looking at them. This group consisted of capable elites, at least in the eyes of others. For him, they were no different than ants.

“Pop!” He flicked his index finger and all of them turned into blood, no chance to scream.

He slowly floated down to the peak next.

“What, what do you want?!” She bellowed as her legs trembled with fear.

Due to her status and cultivation, she normally never gave a damn about anyone, able to do whatever she wanted. Now, she was scared out of her mind and got the urge to kneel down and beg for forgiveness.

Arrogance and pride didn’t matter before death.

“I’m thinking about the most painful death. Normally, I don’t care for torture but this is about sending a message, that a few things are far more terrifying than death.” Li Qiye smiled.

His casual smile scared all the spectators. Their legs started trembling as well.

His smile looked just like the smile of a devil - the most terrifying smile in the world accompanied by a stench of blood. It could become someone else’s nightmare.

They knew that if he so desired it, her death would be utterly miserable. Her beauty and talents no longer mattered. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You... my, my brother-in-law is Luminous Master!” She shouted.

“Pop!” He sent her flying with a slap.

It pulverized her once-enchanting face. The fleshy pulps made others avert their gaze. Of course, he could have killed her with one slap if he wanted to.

She struggled to get up and ran deeper into the continent because her saviors were there.

Li Qiye wasn’t in a hurry and started following her at a slow pace.

“Don’t follow me!” She looked back and became terrified.

She continued screaming while running with all of her strength.

He didn’t seem to mind and maintained the same distance regardless of her speed.

Many exchanged glances. This seemed to be a game of cat and mouse to Li Qiye.

This sensation of fear and embarrassment was more excruciating than death to her. Alas, she had no other choice, hoping to make it far enough to find some protectors.

“A troubling wind is blowing...” One ancestor murmured while watching her get closer to the sealed area.

“A battle between two progenitors soon?” Others said.

Could Luminous Master just watch as his sister-in-law beg for help? There was no way he would let Fiercest kill her.

On the other hand, no one could stop Fiercest from killing his target. Therefore, a battle was inevitable.

“A storm is brewing.” An Everlasting said: “This will be the most brilliant fight of this generation!”

“A fight between progenitors!” Two emotions struck the crowd - excitement and anxiety.

The level of destruction should be immense. One wrong development would result in unimaginable consequences.

“You know, will Luminous Master actually save her?” A spectator asked.

First, the marvel brought this upon herself. This would only be a matter of pride or a constraint due to family ties.
