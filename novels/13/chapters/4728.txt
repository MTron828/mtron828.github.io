Chapter 4729: Sagacity

Sagacity was named after its creator dao lord and didn’t let him down in battle. The same could be said for when the young emperor picked it up at the age of five.

Ever since his debut, he relied on his own power and talent to defeat his opponents, whether it be a peer or an ancestor. Few were worthy of him summoning Sagacity.

Those who have fought him before said that there was no chance of beating him while he had the spear in his hands. This, of course, was an exaggeration. Nonetheless, it expressed his battle prowess with it, akin to a tiger growing wings.

Tiny runes coursed on the surface - this was a supreme chapter written by Sagacity Dao Lord - Sagacity’s Search.

This merit law boosted the spear’s power and made it even more desirable. Just think about it, it contained information regarding the dao lord’s enlightenment journey as well.

“Buzz.” The young emperor channeled his grand dao power and chaos true energy into the spear, causing the runes to become bright and visible.

With that, dao laws poured down and circled around him. Suddenly, cultivators felt something wrapping around their mind and true fate.

Instead of being oppressive and painful, this was akin to falling into a spiderweb and becoming helpless prey.

“Sagacity’s Search.” They heard loud chanting from an unknown being, causing them to drop to the ground and prostrate.

Just the activated dao alone engulfed the crowd members. He didn’t need to use the spear to win.

He then pointed the spear straight at Li Qiye yet the strange phenomenon still robbed everyone of their freedom.

The incoming thrust didn’t have a destructive affinity. On the contrary, crowd members saw the vision of a supreme dao lord sitting in front of them and reciting profound mantras.

This was a lesson and a test for listeners. Those with weaker dao heart had no chance of resisting. The words assaulted the heart and mind, shattering all resistance.

Everyone felt their heart being pierced by this thrust and felt the cold of steel.

“Ahh!” Some couldn’t handle the pain and screamed; others also became suffocated and nearly fainted. The damages would have been fatal if it had been aimed at them instead of Li Qiye.

Once the pain dissipated and sanity returned, they saw Li Qiye stopping the thrust.

Of course, a successful block shouldn’t be surprising to anyone. The problem was how easy he made it seem - with two fingers.

It pierced through his robe and exposed his skin. Just a tiny bit more and he would be able to piece Li Qiye’s heart. Alas, this last bit was an unsurpassable distance.

The crowd gasped in disbelief because the young emperor was famous for being unbeatable when using Sagacity.

“How heaven-defying.” A big shot commented.

“Li Qiye had blocked Shen Juntian’s dao lord attack. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.” An ancestor said.

Others nodded in agreement because Shen Juntian’s dao lord attack was truly dreadful.

The emperor’s expression soured because these two fingers seemed to have taken root into the spear tip. He couldn’t pull the spear back despite mustering all of his strength. Thus, he decisively abandoned the spear and leaped backward.

“You forgot this.” Li Qiye chuckled and threw the spear.

“Boom!” The dao laws from Sagacity Dao Lord also activated and poured out like waterfalls. His power flattened the mountain ranges nearby in the blink of an eye. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This destruction was similar to that of a dao lord attack. This didn’t make any sense since this was the young emperor’s weapon.

It was both blessed and augmented by True Immortal Sect and the young emperor. Others couldn’t exert a similar level of power.

Alas, Li Qiye didn’t need time to be accustomed to it, no need for modification either. Just one throw was enough to deliver a devastating blow.

Those not in the know would think that this was Li Qiye’s own weapon, that he was a member of True Immortal with access to its supreme merit laws.

“How can this be?!” A spectator shouted in astonishment.
