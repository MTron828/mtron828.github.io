Chapter 3583: Just Chopping Wood

Eyes nearly dropped to the ground as the two conversed.

“This amazing creature is a king among high-level heaven beasts. Heavenly Sovereigns are afraid of it.” One expert became jealous since Li Qiye could talk to it freely.

No one here would dare to get close to this creature but Li Qiye treated it like a friend.

“My life would be so good if I can do this.” Another expert salivated.

Just think about it, being able to talk on the same level as a high-level heaven king beast. This would truly be beneficial for the future and made everyone jealous of him.

They watched as he came closer and closer to the golden egg. The beast didn’t try to stop him.

“Why isn’t the king moving? It should be protecting the egg?” One spectator took a deep breath.

This egg was clearly precious beyond imagination, enough to make this beast king value it more than its own life. Nonetheless, it still let Li Qiye get close.

He arrived next to the egg and rubbed it with a natural expression. He looked as if he was touching an egg of a chicken from his farm.

Everyone’s heart started beating faster from being nervous.

“Take it, just take it!” One expert clenched his fists while murmuring.

“Take it out here.” Another ancestor said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Virtually everyone wanted Li Qiye to take the egg outside. Since they couldn’t come into the valley, they needed Li Qiye to bring it out.

Various other possibilities would happen next. They could try to buy it from him or just rob him of it. Ultimately, the chance would be higher than zero.

“What do you think?” The oldest teacher of Duality looked at Teacher Du.

“I’m confident that he won’t take it out. That’s not who he is.” Teacher Du shook his head with a smile.

“Brother Du, you have great trust in him.” A different teacher smiled.

“I’m sure I haven’t misjudged him, he deserves my trust.” Teacher Du responded.

Sure enough, Li Qiye only gently rubbed it for a bit before leaving to gather firewood.

“God, this brat makes no sense!” One spectator couldn’t help blurting out.

“What’s wrong with him? He must be sick in the head to care more about wood than that divine egg!” One ancestor stomped the ground and cursed, not caring about his image.

“He has no idea what’s precious and not!” Another ancestor thought that his brains had some shortcomings.

This was akin to ignoring a mountain of gold for a pile of scrap metals. Anyone would curse after seeing this foolishness.

“If one of my men does something like this, I’ll make mincemeat out of him and feed it to the dogs.” Sir Shang gritted his teeth. It sounded as if this was still a light punishment, not enough to satiate his anger.

“An aberrant fella.” South Peak Marquis thought that Li Qiye was the strangest person he has ever met. Conventional wisdom didn’t work on analyzing him.

Numerous crowd members despised Li Qiye even though he didn’t do a thing to them, wanting to stomp him to death.

Picking wood over the golden egg? Letting him live in this world was a waste of food.

Most importantly, they wanted him to take the egg outside. This completely ruined their plan.

Next came the sounds of Li Qiye chopping a tree in a rhythmic manner. It became the only sound here since everyone was preoccupied with watching him.

They thought that this might be the stupidest thing a man could do given the situation.

“See?” Teacher Du proudly smiled.

“Brother Du, your insight is incredible. I am lost in admiration.” The other teachers were impressed.

“I wouldn’t have been able to resist the temptation.” The oldest teacher commented sentimentally while looking at Li Qiye.

The other teachers didn’t say anything, admitting that they would have fallen to the temptation as well. The value of the egg was just priceless.

“What’s wrong with him...?” One student quietly said.

“The egg is one thing but if I were in his shoes, I would try to be famous instead of chopping wood.” An older student started daydreaming.

Just imagine, being able to live in peace with chaos primal beasts. There was no need to chop wood. Other things using this resource would allow them to soar.

“That’s why you can’t become someone like Young Noble Li.” Yang Ling told them: “He considers the beasts as his neighbors so he won’t take their items. Hmph, all of you are thinking about stealing from your neighbors.”

The students didn’t say anything. She made a lot of sense but they thought that everything was possible when the egg was so valuable. Embarrassment and shame no longer mattered. Just one decision then would make them world-renowned, a trillion times better than being a woodchopper.

The older cultivators present felt the same way and couldn’t understand Li Qiye. They considered him either unconventional or idiotic.

After he finished chopping and placing the wood on his shoulder pole, he started singing again.

“He’s coming out.” Everyone became excited again to see this.
