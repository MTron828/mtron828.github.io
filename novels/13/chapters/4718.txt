Chapter 4720: Unbeatable Strike

“So that’s a dao lord…” Youths had nothing but reverence while staring at the majestic figure. This respect came deep from the heart.

The figure seemed as real as can be, virtually unbeatable and peerless.

Of course, he wasn’t actually here. This was the ultimate manifestation of Juntian’s bloodline, creating a force to be reckoned with.

“Imagine if the dao lord was still in this world.” Someone murmured, trying her best to envision the presence of an actual dao lord.

For those born too late or never had the fortune of seeing the dao lord, all they had was their imagination and it might not be sufficient.

On the other hand, the lucky crowd could never forget that scene, especially if it was during a battle displaying their apocalyptic power.

“Sky Rend!” Shen Juntian roared and showed the crowd true destruction. A boundless dao lord aura descended and made them scream in horror.

“Boom!” This attack contained Shen Juntian’s supreme grand dao and all of his energy and vitality… Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The crowd was temporarily robbed of their vision from the blinding radiance. The area around Li Qiye turned into nothingness, being reverted back to its original state of primordial chaos.

“Dao Lord Attack!” Some crowd members trembled in fear, on the verge of pissing their pants.

It had enough power to alarm those far removed from the Primordial Union and Sky Border. Undying monsters woke up and paid attention to the fight.

“How vivid, it’s like that dao lord is back again.” A monstrous existence said softly.

“Boom!” The attack struck Li Qiye and detonated with the force of a million exploding stars.

No one could stop this attack. Spectators quivered in fear; even ancestors with dao lord weapons in their possession stood no chance.

The world lost its colors and this lasted for what seemed to be an eternity. After a while, spectators could finally open their eyes.

They saw the area beneath Li Qiye being obliterated. His body sank to the ground with lava flowing next to him while his dao sword was blocking the trident.

The incredible might of the dao lord weapon still came down on the sword but Li Qiye’s expression didn’t change in the slightest.

No wound could be seen on his body; no sign of struggling either. It was as if he was merely taking a stroll in spite of facing such a devastating attack. His robe was still perfectly intact after the successful parry.

“Again…?” One spectator became astounded.

“This, this doesn’t make any sense! This is a dao lord attack we’re talking about!” Everyone gasped. Even ancient ancestors found this astonishing.

The monarchs of True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao were part of this group. They thought that even when wielding a dao lord weapon, they wouldn’t have been able to block that strike so effortlessly. In fact, they would have to go all out.

“What is this power?” A clan ancestor murmured in a daze.

“Don’t tell me only a dao lord can beat him…” Someone boldly speculated but quickly changed his mind. Most thought that Li Qiye has yet to reach this level.

An ancient ancestor shared a similar belief and said seriously: “No one will become the next dao lord but him. This competition is unnecessary because all the participants will be killed by him.”

His terror became abundantly clear at this point, especially to the older beings who have witnessed a dao lord in action before.

“Boom!” Space suddenly trembled and Li Qiye slowly floated upward.

His gray sword was actually forcing the trident back, allowing him to have movement again.

The continuous detonations nearly ruptured eardrums. The trident used its endless dao lord power to bring Li Qiye down but this couldn’t reverse the trend.

“Are you seeing this?” An expert became slack-jawed after seeing Li Qiye pushing back the dao lord’s suppression without breaking a sweat.
