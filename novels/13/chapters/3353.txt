The duo stared at Li Qiye with their weapon at the ready.

“We’ll give you the chance to attack first, just to make it fairer.” Huang Ning let out a chilling smile while acting generously.

In reality, he simply didn’t believe that the three actions from Tortoise Fist could kill the two of them.

For example, Zhan Hu had his armor. He could stand there and take so many hits from Li Qiye without receiving damage.

The armor was capable of withstanding heaven-level weapons. Bare-handed attacks had no chance to break through the armor and kill him.

That’s why Huang Ning looked so confident. He wanted to act cool right now in front of his peers and Gong Qianyue.

The crowd also agreed with this point and thought that he was being benevolent for giving up the first move.

“Please, the moment I make my move is when you’ll enter the yellow river, no chance to counterattack. I’m merciful even to ants, so go ahead, attack first.” Li Qiye smiled in response.

The crowd took a deep breath after hearing this.

“How the hell is his Tortoise Fist going to break that Divine Tiger Blood Carapace?” One demon blurted out, not willing to believe this.

Even statues would become angry after being referred to as “ants” in front of everyone. Zhan Hu and Huang Ning’s anger rekindled again.

“Fine, let us take a look at your amazing Tortoise First.” Zhan Hu shouted.

They actually didn’t want Li Qiye to go first so now, the situation became even more favorable. He couldn’t blame them for being merciless now when he didn’t take the given opportunity.

“Don’t regret your choice now.” Huang Ning smiled coldly. The cauldron in his hand exuded a billowing flame.

“You’re wasting time instead of enjoying your last moment.” Li Qiye looked bored already.

The duo moved to their position after exchanging glances, trapping Li Qiye in order to prevent his movements. The next action would be a fatal blow.

The crowd held their breath after seeing the duo’s careful preparation. The seniors felt the same way.

If Li Qiye could win, it would truly be a miracle. That’s why the seniors actually preferred to see his victory.

It wasn’t personal but rather, a win from the duo was expected. Nothing incredible would come from that.

On the other hand, a win from Li Qiye would turn this battle into a legend. They could benefit from watching this fight.

Plus, they wanted to see how devilish Li Qiye was. Could he further amaze them?

“First Brother, do it!” Some demon disciples began cheering for the duo.

“Young Master, Young Master!” The children from Liu cheered. Other disciples from Divine Black started cheering with them too. They tried their best to overwhelm the demon crowd.

This made it quite apparent how popular Li Qiye had gotten. His status had surpassed Zhan Hu and Huang Ning’s.

The annoyed duo nodded at each other, looking quite fierce.

“Kill!” Zhan Hu let out a mighty roar with the force of a tsunami.

The roar truly frightened some of the spectators. He swung his lightning hammer.

“Boom!” The sky turned dark and lightning bolts descended. This was akin to the wrath of a furious thunder god.

“Boom! Boom!” The thick bolts danced around like serpents. They actually surrounded Li Qiye before the thunderous detonations. This was enough to turn him into a sieve.

“Damn!” Many became startled.

“Go!” Huang Ning instantly made his move as well. A mighty flame rushed out of his cauldron.

It looked like a gigantic dragon rushing upward before moving straight back down for Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” His vitality and power soared to an insane level. Everyone could sense the bamboo stick on his back pouring life force into his body.

The dragon continued to grow in size while becoming several hundred times stronger. The stage seemingly exploded as this terrifying flame struck Li Qiye.

Both the lightning bolts and fire dragon smashed into Li Qiye at the same time.

It felt as if the stage had been penetrated. All of Divine Black shook as a result of the devastating strikes. Dust and debris immediately blinded the spectators.

The disciples were horrified, especially those who cheered for Li Qiye earlier. They became as white as paper.

“Quite strong.” An elder couldn’t help but praise.

Some of the seniors were startled. Those moves were strong enough to threaten them.

In fact, a combatant at the same cultivation realm would have been reduced to ashes in the blink of an eye.

“Is it over?” A frightened disciple wondered.

Ping Suoweng and the others activated their heavenly gaze to watch. They nodded approvingly after seeing the move earlier.

This was virtually the limit of their current power. It would be difficult to surpass this destructiveness.

After the dust dispersed, the area where Li Qiye stood earlier has been crushed. The center of this place had melted from the heat. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lava oozed out and began to cool into a mound. It was as if an underground volcano had just erupted. Li Qiye was nowhere to be seen.

The aftermath frightened the weaker disciples.
