Chapter 3764: Supreme Style

Hu Ben’s appearance relieved the crowd. At the very least, the holy ground gained some face back.

It would have been disgraceful if Righteous Scion walked straight to Minor Sacred Mountain without anyone stopping him along the way.

Now, Hu Ben - a commander of Vajra and one of the four geniuses - accepted the challenge at Smoke-fire Fortress. This was as proper of a start as can be due to Hu Ben’s various statuses.

“Hu Ben of Vajra, your fame precedes you.” Righteous Scion posed with both hands behind his back and smiled.

Though he was standing at the base looking up at Hu Ben, this didn’t matter at all. He was still the lord of all, looking down on his subject.

His aura and power were too much for the young generation. Other geniuses always seemed inferior in comparison.

“You’re too kind.” The fierce Hu Ben still enjoyed the pleasantry and cupped his fist: “Your fame also precedes you, Righteous Scion. Your reputation is well deserved.”

Enjoying this conversation was understandable due to the scion’s status. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call him the current number one genius of the southern West King. To have been heard by him before made Hu Ben feel quite good even though it was mere pleasantry.

“However, you’re not a match for me.” Unfortunately, the next sentence took Hu Ben down a notch.

The first line made Hu Ben feel like floating in the air. The next was akin to being hit in the head by a rod, enough to see stars.

Hu Ben’s smile disappeared right away. First was carrot then came the stick - no one would enjoy this treatment.

Others exchanged glances. Anyone else would have been branded as being arrogant and rude. After all, Hu Ben was a top genius in the holy ground and a capable commander.

Not to mention the young generation, even some ancestors would be wary of an all-out attack from him. The scion’s comment was rather contemptuous towards both Hu Ben and the holy ground.

Nonetheless, the crowd kept quiet instead of reprimanding him. He had proven himself after sweeping through his own region. He was qualified to make this domineering statement.

Some thought that he was merely speaking the truth. It had nothing to do with arrogance.

Hu Ben’s expression became unsightly. Nonetheless, since he was the first representative, he tried his best to smile in order to show off his magnanimity.

“I’m more eager to try now. I hope you won’t disappoint me either.” Hu Ben responded.

“Of course, I shall take down Smoke-fire Fortress today.” The scion replied in a dominating manner, annoying the holy ground once more.

Smoke-fire served as the first stronghold at the border. This had special significance so when the scion made this claim, it was as if he wanted to break the gate of the holy ground.

“I see.” Hu Ben was furious because of his opponent’s contemptuous attitude and absolute confidence in victory.

No one could handle being treated in this manner; even a statue would become angry.

“Since you’re so confident, my legion and I will see what you can do.” Hu Ben added.

“Come, an army or not, all the same.” The scion smiled. His style was both infuriating yet admirable to the opponents.

“He lives up to his reputation, so haughty.” One youth admitted.

“It’s normal for him to act in this manner since he’s so strong.” A genius agreed.

“Start!” Hu Ben didn’t want to speak anymore since the scion had an advantage in terms of momentum and aura.

“Rumble!” Figures descended from above and landed outside of the fortress.

These were older soldiers in golden armor. Bloodthirst emanated from them - a testament to their bloody experience on the battlefield.

The young ones became startled after seeing this. One said: “They’re the central pillars of the legion.”

“These men play a great role in helping the legion keep the border safe.” Some saw hope after seeing the soldiers surround Righteous Scion.

Maybe there was a chance since Vigorous Tiger had so many experts.

“This seems lacking.” The scion glanced at the combatants.

“You’ll find out soon enough.” Hu Ben raised his hand.

“Creak!” Platforms with crossbows on top began to rise from the walls. The crossbows were unique and emitted a frightening aura.

“Smoke-fire Crossbows!” Someone shouted: “The dynasty asked powerful Heavenly Sovereigns to make them back then.”

This was one of the stronghold’s strongest offenses. The dynasty invited numerous sovereigns for the sake of creating these crossbows.

“If you don’t mind, I will use everything possible for this battle.” Hu Ben said.

This was supposed to be a duel between geniuses but Hu Ben was using Vajra’s military power as well. Of course, the scion didn’t actually mind.

“That’s fine, I want to see your famous leadership.” The scion smiled.

Hu Ben was actually quite frustrated. He was obviously not a match in a one-on-one fight. However, he had his legion and the resources of the stronghold. He thought that this would be enough to put up a good fight.

“I’ll be starting then.” He said seriously.

The spectators watched with bated breath, hoping for a miracle.
