Chapter 4888: Flame-eater Child

“Screech!” The condors ate everything along the way including mountains.

Some guests started fleeing after seeing this sight. This was understandable because this legion didn’t discriminate between friends and foes.

“Start!” Soaring Stallions roared and activated Azure. Runes turned into countless dao swords that shot toward the enemies.

Loud shrieks came right away as the ferocious condors were pierced by the rain of swords, pinning them down and killing them. Blood stained the battlefield in the blink of an eye.

The guests heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the effective formation.

“Azure.” They witnessed the power of the dao lord’s creation.

Although the condors seemed endless in number and ferocity, they couldn’t get through the dao swords and were forced back.

“Activate!” Wild Dragon roared and waved a banner.

No one saw a mobilizing army but the ground was shaking as if one was incoming.

“Underground!” A powerful guest could tell that something was happening beneath.

Lines started protruding out from the earth, clearly the signs of tunnels.

“Armored Rat Legion!” One villain shouted and made everyone gasp.

They have heard about this elusive legion before. They normally hid underground and could bypass certain lines of defense.

They would then appear in the backline or the enemy’s ancestral ground, catching them off guard.

“Go!” Soaring Stallions turned into a giant. It stomped on the ground and released dao runes downward. Every inch of the land became tougher after receiving the blessing of a dao lord.

“Rumble!” With violent tremors, large figures drilled out of the ground.

They looked like small hills while wearing armor with spikes. Slamming onto the hardened ground left them dizzy. Once they regained their wits, they smashed into the barrier again only to fail.

The double-pronged assault was proven ineffective and left with heavy casualties. Azure under the control of Soaring Stallions seemed impregnable.

Suddenly, smoke and embers arose. Some buildings inside the capital started burning.

“Extinguish the fire!” The members of the dynasty reacted quickly and conjured heavy rains.

Alas, this didn’t do anything because cultivators suddenly felt an unbearable heat as if they were being roasted alive.

“Maddened Flames!” Fire Ape recognized the heat and became alarmed.

This type of flame was notorious, one of the strongest in existence. It had killed emperors and conquerors before on top of leaving a burning crater at Celestial Court.

Everyone traced the source of the heat and saw a child standing outside the capital.

He appeared to be eight or nine, wearing a yellow robe with ivory skin. However, his expression looked a bit slow.

He opened his mouth and released torrents of uncontrollable flames, hence the heat. The barrier was the only thing holding the destruction back.

Layers of runes focused on the affected area, as thick as can be in order to stop it.

“Zzz…” Alas, they started turning red from the frightening heat.

“Flame-eater Child!” Fire Ape shouted.

Those who heard this title became startled. This was the fourth ranker who had three sacred fruits, far stronger than Fire Ape or Toad King. Even the famous Bloodsea Blade couldn’t beat him despite having three fruits as well.

He was different from other heinous villains. The latter killed premeditatedly but he had a mental deficiency. It was interesting that he was able to absorb the flames of Maddened despite the innate disadvantage. Keep in mind that Fire Ape was nearly killed by it despite his cultivation.

The successful absorption boosted his cultivation and made him a powerful dragon lord - nothing short of a miracle. A fool was able to become a dao lord - this puts all geniuses to shame.

His flames were far stronger than Fire Ape’s. Unfortunately, he himself had no idea of his destructive capabilities and merely enjoyed playing with fire.

Whenever he spat one wave out, a thousand miles of territory and its inhabitants would turn to ashes.

Strangely enough, he only listened to Wild Dragon as well - the only man who could communicate and give orders to the kid. Therefore, he served as an ace card for Wild Dynasty.

“Ahh!” Azure was mighty but due to the absence of the dao lord, a hole was finally opened and the soldiers behind it were obliterated right away.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m
