Chapter 5283: A Mere Branch

Dragon lords dying would just be another day at Eagle Peck. Dao lords and conquerors would have a hard time as well; some mighty ones had fallen here.

Thus, True Bear with his three dao fruits couldn’t withstand the sword energies despite having a runic beast armor blessed with the power of the bear star. Blood oozed out between the cracks of his armor. Death was only a matter of time.

Li Qiye noted this and raised his hand, adding a symbol resembling the primordial tree. It exuded primordial particles and made the armor impregnable.

He didn’t help the old servant and Li Zhitian since they could handle this much.

The old man had an azure aura allowing him to traverse through time and space, expertly evading the rampant energy slashes.

Li Zhitian had a majestic grand dao. His dao heart was tough and the sacred fruits blessed him with their power, preventing any serious injury.

Nonetheless, he started sweating when they got close to the peak. The energy blades were infinitely close to his heart but he didn’t utter a single cry of pain.

Li Qiye nodded approvingly after seeing his unyielding nature. As for the old servant, he still didn’t have any problem at this point.

“Clank!” The hymn of a sword alone could disperse the soul.

Li Zhitian felt a sharp pain and immediately formed a mudra to seal his own heart, preventing the sword intent from piercing him.

The old servant finally reacted strongly, stomping on the ground and forming an independent domain around him.

They looked up and saw a black-robed man sitting on a boulder. He had a thin and sharp face; his cheeks seemed as if they were carved with a blade. He sat still and straight, emitting a chilling presence like the dead.

An unadorned black sword lay on top of his knees. The scabbard seemed to be made from two pieces of iron clamped together. The blade was rather thin and seemed fragile, lacking sharp edges.

However, the sword intent from it was second to none. This was more than just a weapon; the two of them were death incarnate.

When they saw him for the first time, they felt as if their throat had been pierced. Merit laws and techniques couldn’t stop it. Of course, the sole exception was Li Qiye who still had a smile.

Li Zhitian knew that he would have been killed in the blink of an eye despite being a supreme genius.

“If you wish to pass through here, leave your life behind.” The man uttered coldly in a matter-of-fact manner, not bothering to look at the group.

“Unfortunately, your sword might be sharp but it is not qualified to kill me.” Li Qiye said.

This prompted the man to raise his head and take a look at Li Qiye. Sure enough, only the empty eye sockets could be seen. The moment anyone saw the darkness in the holes, they would already be dead.

“You wish to block my blade?” The old man said emotionlessly; his voice resembled a sword being scraped against a sharpening stone.

“Not difficult to block the blade of someone who had taken the wrong path. The sword is killing you, not me.” Li Qiye said.

“My sword is killing me?” He stared at Li Qiye.

“The path of the sword is as grand as the heaven itself while yours is a mere branch. You have overestimated yourself and erroneously tried to prove your dao.” Li Qiye went on.

“One move for each person.” He didn’t become angry and simply stated.

“Do you all wish to try?” Li Qiye asked the group.

“I do.” Li Zhitian stared at the black sword, fully aware that death was a likely outcome. Nonetheless, he still wanted to test himself against a blade capable of cutting down the apex.

“Yes.” The old servant said, seemingly wanting to do this from the very start.

“Who’s first?” Li Qiye smiled.

“The clumsy bird flies early. I must compensate for my limited abilities with hard work.” Li Zhitian stepped forward.

“Very well, you go first.” Li Qiye patted his shoulder.

“Please give me pointers.” Li Zhitian bowed toward the black-robed man and raised both hands, summoning various affinities such as the yin and yang, even the reincarnation cycle.

Although he was still standing there, he managed to escape the constraint of time and space.

His given name was Zhitian, meaning a boy capable of stopping the heaven. “Zhi” became the focus of his dao - a defensive art capable of preventing anything from approaching him.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
