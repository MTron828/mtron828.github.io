Chapter 4344: Dark Creatures

The young lord’s intimidating gaze resembled a sharp blade thrusting at the heart.

“I’ve said enough, if you all wish to die, I will entertain you since it’s been a while since I last exercised. Come together, don’t waste my time.” Li Qiye lazily stretched.

The members of Dragon were infuriated by his overbearing and disdainful attitude.

Remember, they were second in the south, capable of changing the continent’s direction. All small sects trembled before them. Li Qiye was the only exception and he took it to the extreme.

“He’s so arrogant.” The weaker members of the crowd were frightened.

“I, I hope that he doesn’t drag us into this mess.” One sect master murmured.

They thought that Li Qiye was tired of living, going as far as provoking Dragon. Most were afraid of Dragon’s wrath. If Li Qiye was annoying enough, Dragon might decide to wipe out all the small sects nearby to make examples out of them.

“He just doesn’t know.” A great power’s disciple scowled.

“Brat, I will make you wish for death then cut you to pieces!” Someone from Dragon bellowed.

“How embarrassing.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I will send you down to see your ancestors, I hope you will change your way down there.”

“Fool, die!” An older disciple could stand this no longer.

“Boom!” He turned into an ape and reached for Li Qiye with a massive, muscular hand.

“Let the show begins.” Li Qiye chuckled and stomped on the water surface.

The entire lake shook violently before cracking noises were heard. Cracks appeared everywhere at the bottom of the lake and from them came the billowing black fog.

The ape couldn’t catch Li Qiye before stopping because he saw the fog morphing into something strange.

They were dark creatures with an oval shape, only possessing a pair of claws sticking out of the fog.

One of them moved with lightning speed and pierced through the ape without any resistance. It seemed to be formless and didn’t leave any wound behind on this demon.

“Ahh!” Nonetheless, the demon ape screamed in pain.

“Zzz…” Next, decaying noises could be heard as his body lost its vitality and blood, being reduced to a dried corpse. His mouth was still wide open since he screamed before death.

The dark creature became stronger after devouring the ape and grew a little larger.

More shrill screams came right away. A dozen or so creatures began devouring the members of Dragon.

It seemed that after the success of the first wave, more creatures buried beneath the ground felt something and more of them emerged.

“Formation!” A senior roared after seeing the incoming waves.

“Clank! Clank!” The vanguard formed a draconic formation. The dragon head took on the waves directly while the tail prevented them from being surrounded.

“Out of my way!” The young lord formed a draconic seal. A loud roar could be heard as energy dragons appeared and rushed towards the nearest dark creature.

The thing exploded from the force but then, the strands of smoke gathered again into the same creature. It began attacking the young lord.

He wasn’t afraid and roared: “Come, I’ll take you all on!” His aura swept through the scene as he rushed forward.

“What are these things?” The spectators gasped while watching the battle.

“They’re creatures of darkness?” A large-sect member took a deep breath.

“Don’t tell me, this Li Qiye can control them?” One expert speculated.

“Maybe the accusation was not baseless, he really conspired with the darkness.” A clan member said seriously.

They stared intensely at Li Qiye who seemed rather amused.

“Villain, hand the treasures over!” A member of a large sect came closer and threatened.

“Hand it over or die!” Another did the same.

A while ago, they kept a distance since they were afraid of the young lord.

Now, the members of Dragon were busy so greed controlled them once more.

“Rumble!” Numerous treasures flew towards Li Qiye, ready to push him to the brink of destruction.

“Blinded by greed.” Li Qiye shook his head and stomped the water again.

More and more dark creatures rushed out and attacked those near him.

“Ahh!” The victims were drained of vitality and became dried corpses.

The number of dark creatures had only increased thus far.

“Boom!” Meanwhile, the fierce battle raged on.

Despite their draconic formation, Dragon was having a hard time stopping the relentless horde.

Eventually, once the dark creatures found themselves unable to break the draconic barrier, they started devouring themselves.

The eaters became larger and stronger. Finally, only one was left - a true monstrosity with massive claws.

It smashed down on the formation with an unstoppable force, successfully crushing it and sending the disciples from Dragon flying. A massacre ensued.
