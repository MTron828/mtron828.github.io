Chapter 4847: Seven-step Death

Tsunami of War manifested from time and space, not from a particular source like water. It appeared without warning, devoid of a beginning and an end.

Since it came from two intangible affinities, its physical nature shared the same characteristics - transparent and omnipresent.

It began to ravage the battlefield in the form of vortexes. The strongest characters would still have a hard time getting away. This included Conceal Conqueror and her stealth technique.

Space crumbled, forcing her to appear constantly before going into hiding again. She utilized her movement technique to its limit, leaping through space and time. Alas, the vortexes were overwhelming.

“Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s attack is effective.” A sovereign commented.

The cat-and-mouse game continued unceasingly. Nonetheless, she still managed to retaliate during each flash.

With each appearance, her sword dao displayed its merciless potential - killing with every step.

“What is this dao?!” Weaker cultivators touched their neck and felt some open gashes.

“Seven-step Death!” Someone shouted, revealing that it was her third dao fruit.

Each step became more and more powerful and penetrating since they built on each other. Her murderous intent began to leak out of the ancient battlefield.

Inhabitants of Chaos that were far away still felt this chilling aura and became paralyzed on the ground.

“Rumble!” Eventually, the murderous technique gained ground against the dao lord’s vortexes. They couldn’t maintain their form and collapse.

Conceal Conqueror finally showed up again and thrust her sword toward Eight-stallion’s chest, gathering all of the murderous intent in existence.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

By this point, the murderous intent has grown to a level strong enough to slay weak cultivators outside of the battlefield. The individual intents pierced their chest and sent them to the next life.

In this crucial moment, another dao fruit released its grand dao as a defensive measure in the shape of a white hammer.

“Boom!” Sparks splattered from the impact.

He then summoned a spear that was rather in tune with him. It was created from a heavenly metal nourished by his dao. He looked majestic and invincible while holding this weapon - this was how a dao lord should appear.

“Light the torches, heed the clarion call, your lord is here!” He chanted before swinging his spear vertically, splitting the heaven apart.

Spectators shuddered while the big shots took a deep breath. In the previous one thousand years, he rarely had to go on the offensive because of his famous shield. Now, he finally showed everyone a patrimonial attack.

“Rumble!” The two combatants exchanged numerous blows in the blink of an eye.

They derived their dao to the limit and spectators had a hard time keeping up. As time passed, the pressure increased and forced them down to the ground.

The sovereigns themselves had a hard time keeping up. Their speed and intensity were too much for heavenly gazes to handle. Constant explosions kept all inhabitants on their toes.

Chaos was the home of many villains and merciless cultivators. Alas, they were overwhelmed with trepidation after feeling the shockwaves from the battle.

This included Wild Dynasty. Its members became rather serious. There was no doubt that these two were the strongest in the lower continents. If they got serious, they would be able to kill anyone.

As the fight reached the climax, Conceal Conqueror finally used her seventh dao fruit. The dao lord was keeping up when it was six versus six. Unfortunately, the disparity became apparent at this moment.

Just a single dao fruit was an immense difference. He couldn’t possibly make up this gap without his immortal shield.

“Boom!” All affinities shattered before an incoming slash from the conqueror. Sovereigns gasped in horror since no one in this region could stop it.

Eight-stallion’s defenses were swiftly dismembered. The slash cut his chest and blood gushed into the air once she pulled back.

However, she sliced horizontally, wanting to decapitate him for a sure-kill.
