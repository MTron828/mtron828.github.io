Chapter 5584: Five Conquerors, Twenty-three Dragon Lords

Wang Taishou’s name alone struck fear into all listeners for he was the leader of Imperial West Bank’s twenty-four dragon lords.

In the distant past, Wang Taishou was rumored to be equal to Supreme despite the latter’s prestigious background.

Of course, the ultimate dragon lords were still Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor. Nonetheless, these two chose Momentous Frontier and became deities. Their strength was now part of the legends.

Therefore, Supreme and Wang Taishou became the defining stars of the dragon lords - the goal of all cultivators on this path.

Wang Taishou’s exploits included leading his clan against Celestial Court. He stopped showing up after the wars since Imperial West Bank grew strong enough to need him for mundane matters no longer.

“Wang Taishou!” Cultivators and ancestors in Dao Domain were startled since they had heard of his legends before.

“Who killed my descendant?!” An ancient voice echoed with ample lethality. There was no escape once being targeted.

“He’s strong indeed.” An emperor’s expression darkened after feeling his surging power. This was a dragon lord as mighty as Supreme.

“So? Keep provoking me and Imperial West Bank is next.” Li Qiye smiled and said, astounding all listeners.

This might be the most overbearing statement they had heard regarding the number one clan of Dao City.

The clan had six conquerors and twenty-four dragon lords. Of course, they had lost two members so far - Turmoil Conqueror and North Star Grand Saint.

This was enough to reign over Dao City; no other clan in the immortal continent could compare with this.

After all, the majority of top cultivators had joined Celestial Court, Imperial Field, and Immortal Dao City. They preferred these alliances instead of starting their own clan or sect.

“Destroy West Bank?” Others gasped after hearing this.

Only a few could utter this statement without invoking jokes and laughter. For example, Purewood Divine Lord and similar characters. However, they haven’t shown themselves and might no longer be in this world.

Today, this declaration from an unknown cultivator shocked Dao City.

“Rumble!” Numerous auras erupted and engulfed Dao City, permeating every inch of land.

Living beings lost their color from being frightened. Ordinary cultivators and ancestors began fleeing but couldn’t get far due to the suppressive auras, becoming paralyzed on the ground instead.

“Boom!” Visual phenomena appeared above Imperial West Bank - images of true dragons roaring, divine bulls shouting at the sky, rotating celestials, and the yin and yang…

Runes and dao laws appeared amidst the blinding radiance, resembling divine chains and waterfalls.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“The wrath of West Bank…” Everyone understood what was going on.

Figures appeared among the phenomena - towering giants, fiery beings, majestic kings… These cultivators seemed ready to destroy everything standing in their way.

“Five conquerors and twenty-three dragon lords, the full force of the number one clan.” One spectator said while trembling.

“The world quakes before them.” A big shot turned pale.

No single power outside of the three alliances could handle their wrath.
