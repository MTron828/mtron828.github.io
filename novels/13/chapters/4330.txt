Chapter 4331: Heavenly Sovereign

The stench of blood permeated the air. Most young disciples haven’t seen something like this before, especially the new recruits. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Those from the great powers’ eyes became different as they stared at Li Qiye.

Deer King was in the myriad-form realm. This wasn’t particularly special, at least not to them. However, this guy was the sect master of Little Diamond, an insignificant sect. Nonetheless, he took down Deer King with his bare hands.

“Which realm is he in?” An expert murmured.

Another from a prestigious clan observed carefully with a heavenly gaze before replying: “Hmm, he needs to be at least at the Grand Dao Sacred Physique realm to kill Deer King so easily. Maybe it’s doable at the grand level of myriad-form but he looks like neither.”

The experts wondered how a tiny sect like Little Diamond has such a powerful sect master.

In Southern Desolace, anyone capable was recruited by the great powers to become outer and inner disciples. Deer King was one example.

Thus, someone as young as Li Qiye should have been recruited by Dragon and Lion’s Roar. How did this fish escape the net?

“Is he really from Little Diamond?” Another questioned.

Everyone knew about Little Diamond’s current power. Though it was as old as can be, it was still a tiny sect. No notable character has come from there in the last ten thousand years.

Currently, this new sect master was both young and mighty. This certainly made people wonder because he should have been a well-known genius just like Gao Qixin.

“Crushing the king with his bare hands, that’s a little too much.” An elder from a small sect trembled.

Deer King was strong enough to destroy most sect masters. Alas, Li Qiye was on another level.

“The impudence!” The young lord of Dragon had enough and got out of his chair.

His thunderous roar made the weaker cultivators see stars. Some lost their balance and fell butt first to the ground.

“You deserve death for killing a member of Dragon.” His eyes flashed with murderous intent.

He instilled fear into the heart of spectators. The young ones felt a pricking pain in their heart, causing them to falter backward and cry out in pain.

“If such a crime warrants death, then it looks like I’ll deserve many more deaths.” Li Qiye chuckled.

This retort scared the hell out of the minor sects.

“How does he have the guts to talk to the young lord like that?” One of them asked.

“All of Little Diamond will go down with him.” An elder turned pale.

No one wanted to have anything to do with Li Qiye or Little Diamond at this point. The young lord was about to unleash his wrath. It was best to stay out of the way because a disaster was coming.

The great powers were surprised as well. Their members didn’t need to be so afraid of the young lord. Nonetheless, they still needed to show him some face because of his father. They wouldn’t have spoken to him with Li Qiye’s frivolity.

“Quite courageous.” An expert praised.

“Boom!” The young lord channeled his vitality and energy for a destructive attack.

The waves emanating from him could crush anything as if they were dried branches.

“Shit!” The weaker crowd members turned pale and roared, unable to withstand the torrential pressure.

Even those from the great powers found this astonishing. His power actually exceeded their imagination since he wasn’t holding back due to anger. His problem was that he was completely overshadowed by his brilliant father. Thus, others only noticed his father, not him.

With his power activated, a divine light pulsed around him and made him look magnificent just like a deity capable of grasping the stars and using their power.

“He has entered the myriad dao realm and is a sovereign now!” One expert became emotional.

“A Heavenly Sovereign?” The small sects were frightened since he appeared to be unbeatable. This realm was completely unreachable for them.

Even a myriad-form cultivator like Deer King was mighty enough, let alone an actual sovereign. They found themselves to be a bunch of worms looking up at a soaring true dragon, feeling utterly intimidated.
