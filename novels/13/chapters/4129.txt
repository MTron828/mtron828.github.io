Chapter 4130: Spacebreak Badge

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Palpitation increased before the might of the dao lord weapons. People thought that just getting one weapon would be so nice; their name would be written in history.

“I just want one, that’s not greedy, is it?” A young expert’s eyes turned red with greed. Possessing one would allow him to dominate.

A senior immediately slapped the back of his head and scolded: “Feeling suicidal?! If it’s so easy, others would have done it long ago.”

The junior stuck his tongue out and didn’t say anything else. He wasn’t the only one tempted to take a weapon from Li Qiye. Nonetheless, they had qualms against actually doing so.

Illusory Princess’ expression soured after seeing her opponent’s weapons. Given her position in Nine-wheel, she was more prestigious than other princesses.

Alas, she didn’t have a single dao lord weapon. Among their young generation, only Void Saint Child was qualified to have one.

On the other hand, the guy she deemed as lowly and despicable had too many. This disparity left her in an awkward state.

“Okay, take out your weapons, broaden our horizon.” Li Qiye said lazily, looking bored.

Normally, this statement would sound ignorant and out of place when addressing Illusory Princess. Her weapons would obviously be incredible given her background.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye had what it took to make fun of her given his arsenal, whether it was on purpose or not.

“Hmph.” She snorted and raised both hands. Ripples appeared and a treasure appeared.

It resembled a lotus-shaped badge or pagoda made out of bronze. As time passed, it lost its golden luster. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Spacebreak Badge.” Many experts became startled after seeing the spatial ripples.

“A weapon left behind by a top Immortal Sovereign.” One elder revealed.

“Wow…” Others were moved because Immortal Sovereigns were arguably comparable to dao lords.

She would certainly have the weapon advantage in most situations. This just wasn’t the case this time because Li Qiye had the number advantage.

“I have to admit, Li Qiye can back up his arrogance.” One expert said.

“Yes, that’s the power of wealth.” An elder said.

Li Qiye completely dominated the princess in terms of weapons. Regardless of how he got it, the reality was that he had more dao lord weapons than anyone.

“Looks like I’m taking advantage of you when I have all the dao lord weapons while you only have one thing.” Li Qiye smiled.

She turned pale after hearing this. It was rare for her to have a feeling of inferiority, akin to a beggar standing before a baron.

“The competition towards the dao doesn’t only rely on weapons and treasures. The foundation is still one’s own strength.” She said but deep inside, she was going crazy from jealousy and cursing the heaven for being unfair.

“You’re completely right, Your Highness. Cultivators need to be aware of this, relying on their cultivation instead of ephemeral and pompous wealth. He should be a merchant instead of a cultivator!” One young expert shouted.

The majority of youths were on her side. Some naturally had a crush on her or wanted to build a relationship with the prestigious princess. However, a few merely hated Li Qiye’s ostentatious style. He had no abilities and virtues, unworthy of those dao lord weapons.

Though they weren’t as rich as him, this didn’t stop them from looking down on him in the slightest.

“Wow, making poverty sound so grand and lofty, this is truly an impressive skill. I am lost in admiration.” Li Qiye chuckled: “I hope I can act as noble and virtuous as you all when I’m poor, saying that money and treasures are just external and insignificant. Unfortunately, you all can say this but won’t be able to stick to this principle. Look, your eyes are red and you’re salivating while staring at these dao lord treasures, no different from hungry dogs spotting a bone, wanting nothing more than to take a bite.”

His harsh statement infuriated the crowd.

“Brat, watch your words!” One genius roared.

“I’m just telling the truth. How about this, do you want this dao lord weapon?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes!” The youth blurted out without thinking and turned red right away.

It was obvious that no one here would refuse a dao lord weapon. Downplaying the value of treasures and weapons was mere rhetoric, nothing more.
