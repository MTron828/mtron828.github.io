Chapter 5683: Another Celestial Court’s Assault

“Rumble!” Bright waves of light engulfed Dao Domain tonight, aiming for the various sects and kingdoms in the region.

Six-finger Peak, Skysplitter Clan, Timeworn Manor, Jadesword Pool, and many others were affected.

Majestic figures appeared from the waves of light and descended, releasing their mighty and dazzling auras.

“We’re under attack!” Top cultivators in the region became startled by the sudden development.

“They’re here already! It’s Celestial Court!” The gongs of war could be heard echoing across Dao Domain.

Imperial-level barriers emerged to retaliate against the large-scale assault.

“Go!” The cries of emperors could be heard as they led the defensive.

In Skysplitter, the sky was torn open and chaos energy poured down, empowering the members of the clan. Skysplitter Conqueror himself appeared, looking like a giant.

In Jadesword Pool, a loud explosion erupted and water gushed upward, turning into a rain of swords. This was due to Jadesword Conqueror.

The five elders of Timeworn Manor joined the fray. The oldest stood in the center while a hundred thousand disciples or so channeled their power into various statues placed in strategic spots. This formed a special momentum, allowing power to flow straight into the five elders.

A massive hand with a suppressive affinity manifested into reality above Six-finger Peak. The conqueror of this sect personally commanded his members to move mountains, forming a large physical barrier to stop the foes.

Numerous battles occurred at the same time. Top cultivators served as the main fighting force, illuminating the world with their auras.

“Celestial Court!” Luminous Conqueror stepped into the sky. His aura spanned for ten million miles, becoming a great shield around Dao Domain.

His primordial dao fruit and anima tree empowered him to stop the beams descending from Celestial Court.

Meanwhile, Celestial Court didn’t stop the summoning. Emperors, monarchs, dragon lords, and ancient gods spread out, heading for all corners of Dao Domain.

Nonetheless, Luminous Conqueror’s shield stopped the reinforcement with his heavenly barrier, resembling a general guarding the gates all alone yet not a single enemy could get through.

This temporary measure allowed his allies to take a second to maintain their composure and react.

“Kill them!” Six-fingers and his allies relied on their sect’s momentum to attack Celestial Court’s floating forces.

On the other hand, armies led by emperors and monarchs have gathered on the side of Celestial Court, undeterred by the strong retaliation.

“Rumble!” Top cultivators took the vanguard, acting as admirable role models for their men. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Jadesword Conqueror channeled a tsunami of swords and sent it toward the strongest commanders ahead.

Six-finger Conqueror’s finger strikes broke through everything while empowered by his sect’s momentum.

The Five Elders transformed into heaven and earth, becoming colossal beings with the help of the manor’s members. Vitality and momentum twisted together, resembling a maelstrom or the jaw of a great beast ready to devour Celestial Court’s armies.

Dao Domain's members were fully engaged and charged to face the grand armies of Celestial Court. Of course, this didn’t stop them from marching and forming majestic formations.

Celestial Court came prepared and blessed the troops with light, enhancing their strength and defense. This allowed them to charge fearlessly into the fray with an unstoppable momentum.

Luminous alone withstood the incoming beams, showing himself to be a true apex cultivator with his incredible display of power.

Alas, good times were always short-lived. Light beams relentlessly crashed against his barriers while the strongest cultivators of Celestial Court initiated their attacks. This included apex cultivators.

“Rumble!” Each strike could crush a continent, dealing immense damage to the barrier.

Luminous Conqueror staggered backward and felt his energy churning. The barrier collapsed afterward.

Without its protection, Dao Domain shook violently and the armies of Celestial Court rushed downward with no end in sight.

Luminous became startled after witnessing the full might of the reinforcement. Celestial Court’s offense looked to be their full power, far stronger than the previous assault.
