Chapter 4744: The Prize

No one had a problem with his answer. Nonetheless, it was rather strange because the competition wasn’t a personal contest.

As long as one was talented enough to become an heir, their sect would also be involved. First, they have spent immense resources on grooming these geniuses. The true payoff only came with the emergence of a dao lord.

Tian Feng had Divine Dragon Valley helping him. It wasn’t quite on the level as True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao but far superior to Five-sun School. As a supreme genius, Tian Feng was absolutely worthy of getting full support from Divine Dragon.

Alas, he never relied on his sect’s power in the past or now against Li Qiye. Most considered this as either foolish or insanity. The latter applied to Tian Feng.

“Interesting response.” Li Qiye smiled and trend his attention toward the ancient ancestors.

“One at a time or all at once?” He asked and left the crowd speechless.

This current alliance was virtually unstoppable and could destroy ten kingdoms in no time at all. How many would dare to face them alone? The other conquerors certainly wouldn’t.

“He’s unbeatable with that gemstone.” A big shot said while staring at his shining fist.

“The gemstone is unbeatable, not him. No one can fully control its power so forcing the issue will end with a fatal backlash. It’s suicidal.” An ancient ancestor shook his head.

This became clear to everyone after seeing the fist emperor using it a while ago. The power of the gemstone far exceeded the limits of cultivators.

“I will start.” Pagoda Monarch said seriously.

“Buzz.” His pagoda exuded a divine light and became larger again, piercing through the blue clouds and even the stars above.

The power of the pagoda crashed downward without the help of merit laws and techniques. The grand dao wailed in agony as they were being pushed apart. Mountains and lakes were instantly destroyed.

Li Qiye resembled a mosquito compared to the great pagoda. A direct impact should result in obliteration.

“Bam!” However, Li Qiye easily stopped it with his palm. The collision sent out destructive shockwaves and ravaged the already broken region.

The pagoda couldn’t move an inch downward and didn’t shake Li Qiye at all.

“Break!” The monarch added more energy into the pagoda only to have the same result. It didn’t matter how much he tried, the pagoda wasn’t moving in the slightest.

“Back at you.” Li Qiye smirked and pushed upward.

“Boom!” The pagoda suddenly flew back with lightning speed toward its master. Its speed and power were countless times stronger than its previous attack, enough to create a blazing trail.

The monarch became alarmed and let out a battle cry. He chanted a mantra to construct a towering dao wall.

This defense and his mastery over the pagoda failed him. It destroyed the wall and smashed him, breaking his bones apart. He vomited blood and slammed into the ground, resulting in a big pit.

He eventually got up while holding the pagoda. Alas, he looked pale and was shaking since his own weapon nearly killed him.

His allies were shocked to see this. This applied to the powerful members of the crowd as well.

Pagoda Monarch was absolutely a top cultivator capable of sweeping through Eight Desolaces. Today, he couldn’t block one move from Li Qiye and nearly met his maker.

“I would believe you if you tell me that he’s a dao lord already.” Someone told his friend, aghast. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“The power of the immortal gemstone. Not a dao lord yet is superior to one.” An old demon commented in a daze.

The allies exchanged glances, aware that trying to fatigue him by going one at a time wouldn’t work. All of them would die eventually. Thus, the only plan was to work together and attack from all directions.
