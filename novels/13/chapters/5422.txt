Chapter 5423: End Of The Road

Everyone could tell that this was the end of Illumination Conqueror’s era. However, he didn’t seem to think so.

“Hahaha, it is not decided just yet!” Illumination showed no sign of despair.

This naturally surprised everyone including his opponents.

“Still got an ace card?” Swordsea stared intensely at him.

All-things did the same while having numerous guesses popping up in his head.

The two understood Illumination better than anyone else since they were allies once. They knew that he wasn’t going to give up so easily.

“Of course.” Illumination teleported back to what was left of his grotto.

It no longer resembled a paradise, only a barren land filled with corpses. Casualties included those from both sides.

He saw his disciples and loyal brothers lying on the ground. Resources and formations built with painstaking efforts have been reduced to ashes.

He had a forlorn gaze as he said: “True heroes who sacrificed themselves for a supreme achievement. Brothers, you shall not be forgotten. Farewell on your journey.”

He then entered his personal palace. The others didn’t pursue him and commanded their allies to leave the grotto instead.

They had sealed the entire region so there was no escaping for Illumination. Thus, an evacuation was required in order to avoid needless casualties.

“Now this is an apex battle.” A spectator commented after only seeing four cultivators left in the grotto.

The assault earlier was meant to sweep clean the battlefield, readying it for this showdown.

“What else does Illumination Conqueror have up his sleeve?” Another said. The situation looked rather grim for him.

A few ancient ancestors and dragon lords didn’t want him to go down in this manner - falling to his mortal enemies. Alas, everyone knew that the odds were stacked heavily against him - Supreme, Swordsea, and Eternal Conqueror, not to mention All-things Dao Lord waiting in the background.

Moreover, other top members of the alliances have yet to show themselves - Darkfrost Dao Lord and Immortal Pagoda Conqueror.

They might be serving as contingency plans just in case Illumination truly had something unstoppable as his last attempt.

“This is a miracle of sorts, living a life culminating in being attacked by all the apex conquerors.” A conqueror smiled and said.

The big shots from The People were rather annoyed. Alas, they had no response because Illumination’s actions have alienated all of his peers. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

All-things Dao Lord wanted to kill him, and the same for Darkfrost Dao Lord. The remaining apex cultivators included Azure Ancestor, Coldflame Conqueror, and Sword Queen.

The former two were neutral while Sword Queen gave All-things Dao Lord her immortal order, making her stance clear. Immensity abandoned the battle as well, leaving Illumination all alone.

“Once a respected lord, only to be abandoned by all.” A previous ally of Illumination became sentimental.

He recalled the founding of Dao Alliance and its successful recruitment. Now, the current darkness stood in stark contrast to Illumination’s golden age.

“No ace card will change the outcome, the hearts of the people are no longer with him.” An insightful dao lord commented.

Not long ago, All-things and Swordsea Dao Lord didn’t direct their blade at Illumination, not even during Emperors War. Now, the fair-natured All-things himself wanted to end this.

Illumination became powerless against Heaven and Divine Alliance without the help of other apex cultivators. His ace card was only meaningless struggling.

“Rumble!” His palace started crumbling down, slowly revealing a large pool in the center.

It started flowing and connecting with the altar originally meant for Ye Fantian’s sacrificial ceremony. Illumination then leaped into the pool filled with an unknown liquid.

Others activated their heavenly gaze to analyze the event.
