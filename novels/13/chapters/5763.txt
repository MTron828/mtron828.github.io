Chapter 5764: You Can Live On

Ling’er was only a mortal and didn’t understand the profundity of the cultivation world. Nevertheless, she grasped an important concept and said: “Young Noble, your past, present, and future are not separated, why are mine separated?”

She struck the nail on the head so he replied: “Because you’ve been suppressed, so a specific version of you only appears at specific times.”

“Why was I suppressed, am I evil?” She looked somewhat puzzled.

“You did nothing wrong, you are a good girl.” He said.

“Then was I different from everyone else?” She was a smart girl and asked the right questions.

He only sighed in response.

“Young Noble, tell me, please.” Her eyes pleaded.

“Very well, it is because you shouldn’t appear in this world but someone had planned around this.” He responded. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Does that mean... my very existence is a sin?” Her fingernails drilled into her palms.

“Silly girl.” He grabbed her hands to release her grip.

He then tidied her hair and said: “Your birth is not a sin, the guilt lies with the person who orchestrated everything.”

“But it seems I really should not exist, that’s why I am left here.” She felt great sorrow while staring at the coffin.

On one hand, her true self was locked in this coffin, never to see the sun. However, a different her was able to live in the outside world. The whole situation was bizarre.

“You should live, and live well.” He said.

Tears streamed down her cheeks as she was overwhelmed with emotion. After a moment, she looked at him and asked: “Young Noble, are you here to kill me?”

He smiled wryly after hearing this.

“You don’t have to say it, I already know. You are a god sent by heaven to smite me, I must be an intolerable sin that cannot be allowed to roam the world.” She said.

As a mortal, she couldn’t imagine the secrets behind this. Nonetheless, her speculation still struck the fundamental circumstances.

“No one sent me here, and I’m not going to kill you. As I’ve said, I’m looking for something.” He wiped her tears and shook his head.

“That thing?” She glanced at the rune on top of the star.

“Yes, I’ve been searching for it for a long time now.” He nodded.

“Take it then, Young Noble.” She said without any hesitation.

He sighed while looking at the woman in the coffin.

“I see, this thing is used to seal me, or my sin, right? If you take it, the sin will be released.” She said.

“It is used to prolong your life, not a prison.” He said.

“I understand, you have to destroy me to take it.” She stared at him.

“Why is that?” He responded.

“Because the world does not tolerate my sinful existence.” She cried again, but having accepted reality this time around: “I’m sure that once released, it will only harm others.”

“You can live on, but very few under the heaven can make this possible.” He said.

“You’re one of them?” She couldn’t help but ask.

“I can.” He let out a sigh.

“Then, then I don’t have to die?” She came to her senses. As an ordinary girl with a kind heart, her emotions were written on her face.

“Yes.” He nodded.

“What should I do then, to avoid death?” She asked softly.

He gazed at her innocent eyes and revealed: “Thorough purification using the supreme power of an epoch.”

“Purify my sin away?” She asked.

“Remember, you are just a newborn, this sin is not your responsibility.” He said.

“Destruction must be easier than purification.” She hesitated before stating.

“Yes, easier, I just need to lift my hand.” He didn’t lie to her.

“Saving me is way harder?” She asked.

“Yes, because you are still something that shouldn’t exist.” He nodded.

“If, if that’s the case, then just destroy me, Young Noble. I am just a mortal while you are a deity.” She said softly: “I suppose this is a happy ending for me, at the very least, I won’t be reviled by others anymore.”

“Silly girl, difficult, sure, but I can do it.” He smiled and patted her head.

“But we are strangers.” She said.

“It is fate, and I shall grant you a chance. Cause and effect, and you deserve it.” He smiled.

“No, it is because you choose to save me, Young Noble.” She stopped crying and smiled.

“Either way, accept it wholeheartedly and cherish it. Let your future be bright.” He said.

“I will remember how you bestow this chance to me, Young Noble.” She said with a firm expression.

“Then we shall get started, a conclusion to this touch of fate.” He said.

“Okay.” She nodded.

“This process will be agonizing, you must persevere.” He said.

“I will, Young Noble.” Her determination was evident.

“Very well.” He said and instantly pierced her head with a burst of primordial light.

“Ahh!” The ray came from the top of her head yet didn’t kill her, only delivering unbearable pain to a mortal.

“Endure.” He focused and summoned a primordial tree behind him to support this starry expanse.

He became the lord of this area and waved his hand, releasing the purest primordial rays. They converged together, turning into a bright liquid.
