Li Qiye didn’t give any consideration to the sword in his hand as if it was only an ordinary blade. His expression was one of disinterest. This would be fitting as if he was holding a toy stick, not a patrimony sword.

“That’s a patrimony sword!” Both the involved parties and the neutral spectators were shaken.

“He can wield and control it...” All eyes were on the sword as one elder said.

This artifact was far stronger than a regular dao lord weapon. Even a sacred cultivator might not be able to control one. In a successful case, some limitations might still exist.

However, Li Qiye held it with such ease and leisure. People actually forgot that he was only at the Bronze Tendon realm.

As for the ones from Divine Black, this wasn’t their first time seeing Li Qiye controlling this sword. Nonetheless, their enthusiasm didn’t diminish during their observation.

“It’s happening!” So many were trembling with excitement. They could see him use their ultimate sword to kill the enemies and solidify their sect’s prestige.

Their blood ran faster and hotter because the fight would make their sect world-famous and herald a new era.

“A patrimony sword.” Lu Yiling’s expression became serious right away. His suspicion has, unfortunately, come true.

He had his own patrimony swords and knew of its power. The pressure became greater.

Li Qiye’s own power was already unfathomable so he was relying on having the weapon advantage. Maybe he had a chance of survival by using them.

Now, his last spark of hope was extinguished. This made him palpitate.

“You need to run as far as possible! Three Truths will be there as long as you survive!” Three Truths Sect Master beseeched, realizing that Lu Yiling couldn’t do anything. Both of them had the same level of weapons now. This was hopeless.

Thus, he only wanted Lu Yiling to leave this place alive. He had the biggest chance for success out of them all. That’s why he hoped Yiling would start escaping. He would be the last seed of their sect.

“Thank you, Senior Brother.” Yiling shook his head: “I seek the peace of mind so I would rather die in battle today instead of escaping and abandoning you who treats me better than anyone.”

This won some sympathy from the crowd. Although these two were technically martial brothers, the sect master served as his master. Their relationship was deep. Yiling wouldn’t abandon him or the rest of Three Truths.

Some would consider this foolish. Others would praise him for being virtuous. As for Yiling, he himself said that this would give him peace of mind.

“Show me what you can do with your patrimony swords.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Very well.” Yiling took a deep breath and threw away unnecessary thoughts. He knew that this next attack would decide his fate along with the sect.

“Clank!” The heavy sword let out a long hymn. The three swords behind him floated up into the air, slowly leaving their sheath. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The hue from the glints of the three swords was different. They were pure and resplendent, reaching the limit of these colors. No, this wasn’t limited to just being a color anymore. It has transcended to an art form.

The aura of a dao lord naturally erupted like a storm. Many experts couldn’t keep their eyes open and were forced far away from Divine Black.

They eventually floated around Lu Yiling and let out three hymns from left to right and from shallow to deep. Each hymn acted as a step or a character, ready to display a grand dao.

“Three Truths Swords, a full set consisting of Heaven, Earth, and Man.” An expert from the last generation said.

Everyone stared at the floating swords with bated breath. The ones from Three Truths were even more nervous since they knew their lives were in Lu Yiling’s hands.

“Patrimony swords, Three Truths versus Divine Black, this is their biggest fight in history.” An old cultivator said.

These two sects have fought for generations but they have never resorted to using these weapons until now. It would definitely determine their future.

“Our Patriarch, Three Truths Dao Lord left these swords behind. Truth of the heaven, truth of the earth, and truth of men. They are the most powerful weapons in our sect, worthy of fighting against you.” Lu Yiling introduced the three.

“They’re fine swords. You may start.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

His attitude made others smile wryly but no one considered him to be arrogant. This was how it should be even when he was facing a genius like Lu Yiling.

The two had a stark contrast in attitude. Li Qiye held his sword as if he was holding a random stick. On the other hand, Lu Yiling looked as solemn and dignified as can be while controlling the three swords.

“The final battle between Divine Black and Three Truths.” The spectators became serious as well.

“Leave right after I make my move.” Yiling told the three daoists.

They became emotional after hearing this, realizing that he wanted to buy time so that they could run.

“What about y-...” One of them murmured

“Enough.” Yiling waved his hand and interrupted the guy. He focused up and stared at Li Qiye, determined to perform his strongest technique.

The actual members of Three Truths were willing to die with him. Alas, the daoists knew that they would die in vain.

“Your future would have been magnificent but unfortunately, you’ve joined the wrong sect.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Not true.” Yiling solemnly said: “The sect made me who I am. This is all worth it.”

“A good man indeed, grateful and selfless. I will perform three moves. Survive and you may leave.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly.
