Nearly everyone here thought that his comment was too arrogant and ludicrous.

They knew that Zhan Hu was very close to becoming an Enlightened Being. Several more years after that and he would be at the materialization level.

At that stage, how could these children and their Tortoise Fist defeat him? Simply impossible.

First, Zhan Hu would have access to mightier and more profound merit laws in the future. Second, his demon tiger lineage was quite powerful as well and had its fair shares of amazing techniques not inferior to the sect’s merit laws. That’s why his father had such an imposing title, Iron Rod Demon King.

“Ignorant fool.” One demon snorted: “Senior Brother Zhan Hu’s inherited iron rod is peerless. Even a black Dao Lord merit law can’t stop it.”

“Hahaha, I see, Tortoise Fist must be the best, hahaha...” Zhan Hu’s eyes became murderous while laughing.

“You must think that you have the greatest talents, enough to be an ultimate teacher? Coming here and recklessly teaching disciples... They can train for another one hundred years with Tortoise Fist and I can still destroy them with a single finger.” He added.

“The first part is true.” Li Qiye said: “Even the weakest student of mine will be countless times stronger than you.”

“Are you listening to yourself?!” Zhan Hu finally erupted with fury: “If you’re really talented, then you wouldn’t be a Mortal Shell right now. Oh wait, my mistake, our young master is at the Iron Skin realm now, so miraculous, the best in our sect with matchless dao comprehension, the number one in all of northern West King...”

His sarcasm was as clear as day. Some of the crowd bought it too and laughed while staring at Li Qiye with disdain.

“He’s nothing without his protectors.” One disciple quietly said.

Of course, they wouldn’t dare to name Fuyou and Huang Jie. Nonetheless, they thought that this was the case. Li Qiye wasn’t worth a single coin; even the terrible disciples in their sect were superior to him.

Li Qiye ignored the sarcasm and leisurely said: “Seems like you finally know your place and recognize greatness. Yes, I am indeed number one in the world when it comes to talents and comprehension.”

He blew his own trumpet hard enough to stun the crowd. It was as if he took Zhan Hu’s sarcastic comment seriously.

Fuyou smiled wryly; he didn’t know what Li Qiye wanted to do by playing along with the guy.

“He’s stupid enough to misinterpret it?” One disciple stared at Li Qiye.

“Maybe, there is no limit to stupidity and ego in this world.” One demon added.

“In the world? You’re not even the number one in Divine Black.” Zhan Hu had a tough time.

Others would be embarrassed by all the criticisms and mockery. They wouldn’t be able to keep their head up high but this Li Qiye didn’t give a damn at all.

“Just Divine Black? No, I’m definitely number one here, no big deal.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re the number one from the bottom up!” One disciple immediately became annoyed and shouted: “Senior Sister Qianyue is our number one!”

“Oh? Far inferior compared to me.” Li Qiye chuckled before sitting down in his chair, closing his eyes.

“Hmph!” How could a scowl sound so pleasant?

A beauty appeared out of nowhere. She commanded everyone’s attention. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Senior Sister!” A furor erupted because of her.

“She’s visiting our Jade Bird!” So many became overwhelmed with excitement.

“Look, she’s definitely the prettiest in the sect.” The older ones were enamored with her.

Someone like Gong Qianyue would have this response wherever she went due to her talents and beauty.

She wore a light-green dress, looking like a forest fairy. It accentuated her perfect figure, stealing the soul of men and the confidence of women.

A faint flame could be seen around her. It didn’t exude any heat but people couldn’t help feeling respect. This was the sign of the Samadhi Materialization realm.

Zhan Hu’s expression changed as well. They were both geniuses and he was older than her. Moreover, he was born in a prestigious clan so he had access to more resources. Alas, she still surpassed him.

Her flame could annihilate his weapons and turn him to ashes right now.

“Junior Sister.” He revealed a wide smile and came up to greet her.

Unfortunately, she only had eyes for Li Qiye - ones filled with coldness.

This animosity had nothing to do with Li Qiye’s comment earlier. It was due to their first meeting back in the pond when he saw her naked.

She tried to find him after the pillar pushed him out but failed. From that point, she swore that if she were to meet this jerk again, she would teach him a lesson. She slowly walked towards Li Qiye.

A few spectators snorted and gloated: “Hmph, the boasting idiot is about to get it, let’s see how Senior Sister will deal with him.”

“Bah, she can take him down with one finger. Can’t believe he bragged about having superior talents to her. He should take a look at himself in a puddle of piss to see what he really is.” Another said with disdain.

“Senior Sister shouldn’t waste her time on a piece of trash like him. I’m more than happy to make him stay in bed for a month or so.” An admirer of Qianyue sneered.

Meanwhile, Zhan Hu watched this scene with a smirk. He was more than happy to see Qianyue take care of Li Qiye.

In this case, even Huang Jie and Liu Fuyou wouldn’t be able to protect him because her backer was the sect master himself.

Li Qiye was still laying in his chair with his eyes closed, completely ignoring her.

“Still acting haughty in front of Senior Sister?” Many disciples didn’t like this.

She stood in front of him and didn’t make a move just yet.

“And here I thought you would hide forever.” Li Qiye finally opened his eyes.

“Hmph.” Her cultivation was strong enough to intimidate others with just a single scowl. They no longer dared to look straight at her outside of Li Qiye.

“You’re very confident.” She spoke coldly. Nonetheless, her voice was still pleasant enough.

Though many in the sect admired her, they didn’t dare to get close due to her cold and distant nature.
