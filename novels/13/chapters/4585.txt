Chapter 4586: Five Conquerors Of Sky Border

Most interestingly, some said that he was Eight Stallion Dao Lord’s son. This rumor was substantiated with actual evidence.

First, Dao Sanqian was Eight Stallion Dao Lord’s dao protector. Now, his son became Dao Sanqian’s direct disciple. In other words, either the dao lord entrusted his son to Dao Sanqian or the latter sought the youth out first.

This particular dao lord was a romantic playboy during his youth. This didn’t change after he became a dao lord either, always having dao companions with him. However, the existence of his children was not publicized.

After he left the world, many geniuses claimed to be his chilren. Alas, they didn’t have proof since he was no longer around. This made it difficult to legitimize their claim.

Other dao lords wouldn’t have this problem but Eight Stallion had too many scandals and dao companions.

As for Shen Juntian, his rumored bloodline didn’t come from him nor Three Thousand Dao. A knowledgeable historian started this theory after learning the boy’s birthplace, life trajectory, and various circumstances.

Shen Juntian himself and Three Thousand Dao didn’t verify this theory. Now, Li Qiye’s comment certainly confirmed it for the group. Shen Juntian did indeed have the bloodline of a dao lord.

“The last dao lord, his prestige and authority still remained. This bloodline is extremely dense, it must be mighty.” The daoist murmured.

There were no lack of dao lords’ descendants in history. Nonetheless, there were levels to this.

In this case, Eight Stallion Dao Lord reigned in the last generation. His grand dao still engulfed the world. Therefore, this bloodline was new and vigorous compared to older bloodlines. Shen Juntian had immense potential as a result.

“I’m sure he gained a lot from his last training session.” Jian Ming was a busybody and asked the youth: “Is he ready to kill the other four conquerors?”

Though Paramount Scion came from a noble upbringing, he didn’t have the same arrogance as his peers.

“I do not dare to speculate.” He shook his head: “His cultivation is above mine, the same with the other four scions. Nonetheless, I can say that his cultivation has certainly soared after this session, reaching a great height.”

“A lot of words to tell us nothing.” Jian Ming replied.

“Well, I’m not qualified to assess his attainment of the dao.” The youth smiled.

“Really?” Jian Ming smirked: “Seems like you’re good friends with him and know his power quite well. Who do you think will win among them in a real fight?”

“Hard to say.” The youth told the truth: “In a real fight, I’m sure it won’t be a one-on-one scenario.”

“Yes, the competition for the next dao lord is a competition between sects or even races.” The daoist nodded in agreement. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jian Ming and the daoist exchanged glances. All five conquerors had a good chance of winning.

Shen Juntian, True Immortal Young Emperor, Five-sun King, Tian Feng, and Firmament Mortal King. Which of them would become the next dao lord?

“I think Five-sun King is the weakest of the bunch.” Jian Ming commented.

In the final competition, their sect would become involved as well. Shen Juntian had Three Thousand Dao and Dao Sanqian. The latter was successful in the last generation.

True Immortal Young Emperor also had advantages. True Immortal had trained many dao lords before and had ample resources.

Tian Feng’s background was no slouch either - Divine Dragon Valley.

Five-sun School was strong but it couldn’t compare to the behemoths.

“Don’t forget, he has the ancient clans of the east supporting him.” The daoist reminded.

“True, they might have some horrifying geezers that are still alive.” Jian Ming agreed.

These clans would naturally join the future competition. Maybe Five-sun King still had a fighting chance.

“What about Firmament Mortal King?” Jian Ming asked. She was the most mysterious of the five with an unknown background.

“Fellow Daoists, may I tag along?” Suddenly, a pleasant and charismatic voice sounded as another landed on the deck.

A faint fragrance lingered in the air. Smelling it made one feel as if they were standing in a pristine mountain and listening to the gurgling streams.

Jian Ming and the daoist looked over and saw a tall girl, looking healthy and beautiful. She also wore a neutral-gender robe instead of the common dress. She appeared simple and natural while possessing both strength and elegance.

Her face was a sight to behold. Though it wasn’t unreasonably gorgeous, it was well-balanced and natural. Her faint smile was bright and unrestrained, showing no sign of pretension.

A girl like her would always leave a lasting impression on spectators.

“Mortal King.” Paramount Scion bowed slightly to greet her.

“Mortal King?!” The daoist and Jian Ming blurted out.
