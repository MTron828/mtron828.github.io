Chapter 4885: Rewards For All

Wanting to reward Wild Dragon sounded ignorant. Even Eight-stallion Dao Lord wouldn’t do something like this.

Moreover, each inch of territory was earned by the blood of its members. Now, this king seemed ready to gift it to someone else.

“Your Majesty, you are so generous. We don’t ask for much, just Eight-stallion’s territory will do.” Pyromancer smirked, stating his true intention. It was no secret that both sides desired to end the other.

“Not out of the question. Let Wild Dragon know that when he comes to pledge loyalty, he may pick any territory in Eight-stallion as his own. I am in need of capable followers, this applies to everyone else in the world as well. We shall share the world together, rewards and land shall be yours.” Li Qiye laughed loudly and declared.

Pyromancer’s expression soured. This brat wanted his lord to surrender and obey?

This might have been possible back during the dao lord’s reign. No one questioned his superiority over Wild Dragon.

This was especially true with the help of the immortal shield. Wild Dragon lost several times and had to run back to his system in order to survive. 

However, times have changed drastically with Eight-stallion no longer being competitive.

This new king’s arrogance infuriated Pyromancer. Alas, he could only scowl due to all of the experts surrounding Li Qiye.

This was the one time when Li Qiye said something that the members of the dynasty enjoyed in spite of how ridiculous it was.

“Hahaha, Your Majesty, I can appreciate your ambition.” A figure appeared and laughed boisterously back at Li Qiye: “I want the riverland to the north, will you grant it to me?”

This turned out to be a large toad with a crown. Its body pulsed with evil mist and fog, culminating into a type of death energy.

His appearance caused the guests nearby to immediately back off. The death miasma was deadly corrosive.

“Corpsepoison Toad King!” Everyone in the crowd became startled. Some gasped audibly at his sight.

He was ranked seventh among the ten and naturally came from Demon. According to the tales, he enjoyed eating corpses in order to spew out powerful miasma. He once ate three whole sects for this purpose.

Therefore, cultivators in the three lower continents usually became nauseous at his sight.

As for the members of Eight-stallion, they immediately entered a state of battle and stood up since the demon appeared without warning.

“Civic Deputy, why is he here?” An influential official asked Monochromatic Master since he was in charge of the guest list.

“His Majesty wished to invite everyone, I merely obeyed.” He calmly answered.

He had clearly invited Toad King here but used Li Qiye as an excuse. Others couldn’t fault him for this.

“The riverland?” Li Qiye said: “Not a problem at all. Become my subject and it is yours.”

“We mustn’t!” Many officials protested right away.

“It is fine to recruit powerful and famous cultivators to increase our dynasty’s strength.” Li Qiye smiled.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Others couldn’t quite disagree with this logic. Though they disliked the monstrous demon, he was indeed powerful and could deter other villains.

Why would he work for the dynasty without getting something in return? This was no longer the era of the dao lord where he could force villains to work under him.

Nonetheless, the officials turned to Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God for guidance. They simply sat there and gave tacit permission.

Some officials were rather annoyed. They obtained that region by paying with blood and sweat. Now, this prodigal king was going to give it away so easily?

“Haha, if Old Toad can get the riverland, what is my reward if I were to join Eight-stallion Dynasty?” An unpleasant voice interrupted the scene. Listeners felt as if their heart was being struck by a hammer.

Another figure showed up among the crowd, one as large as a mountain. This was a large ape with a ferocious face and unbearable heat waves. The most dreadful thing was a different face in front of his chest that spits out scorching flames.

The creature resembled a volcano that could erupt any moment and destroy the region. Its gaze instilled pain into the audience.

In fact, weaker cultivators suffered from blisters on their skin due to the heat.

“Fire Ape!” Many shouted this title in astonishment.

The sixth ranker with two sacred fruits has shown up. However, he was from Maddened, not Demon. The fire domain there didn’t kill him but gave him its power.

Though he wasn’t as insane and murderous as Mad Pyromancer, he was known to have a foul and impetuous temperament.

The latter half of the Ten Monsters was present in Eight-stallion. This was a force strong enough to sweep through the lower continents.

Their presence contributed to the coronation’s grandeur.
