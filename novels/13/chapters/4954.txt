Chapter 4955: Not Knowing One’s Limit

“It’s either a yes or a no.” Halo raised his voice.

“What are the terms?” Li Qiye smiled.

The three exchanged glances after hearing this and came up with an idea.

“You will lose if you can’t steal all three of our fortune.” The young monarch said: “We will take your dog head then.”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Bet your life if you dare.” Swordgrasp said, wanting to avenge their previous humiliation.

“Not a good idea.” Yunyun whispered.

Goldcrest felt the same way. Sure, Li Qiye was devilish. Nonetheless, even the smallest probability of failure could happen. There was no need to risk one’s life over this little feud.

“You won’t be arrogant anymore with your head chopped off after losing.” Halo egged Li Qiye on, thinking that he was hesitating.

“Bah, can’t even accept defeat and want to start another bet? How utterly shameless.” Ming Shi said.

“Double or nothing! Bet your life on it!” The young monarch was furious.

“If you don’t dare to play, then stop running your mouth here.” Swordgrasp threatened.

The trio wanted to force Li Qiye away by making it a life-or-death situation. That would be enough to solve the young monarch’s predicament.

“And if I win?” Li Qiye asked with a smile.

The trio became frozen because they didn’t expect him to actually entertain this offer. They remained skeptical about his ability and thought that it was still just a coincidence.

However, what if he could actually steal fortune and win the bet?

All eyes were on the trio now, awaiting their response. They felt the same way - still not buying Li Qiye’s devilish ability.

Nonetheless, they were more than happy to watch the show and see if Li Qiye could prove himself. After all, they had nothing to lose.

“I wonder if he’s actually bad luck incarnate. This is a good opportunity to find out.” One student whispered.

“If we lose, you can do whatever you want to us.” Halo Scion was the youngest and barked back.

Alas, he regretted his impulsiveness and glanced over at his allies. It was too late for the other two to stop him now.

“Good, we have an agreement then.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Bring it.” Swordgrasp said since the arrow has left the string.

“Say your last words now or you won’t have the chance later.” The young monarch glared at Li Qiye.

“That’s my line.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We’ll see about that.” Swordgrasp said: “The truth will be revealed in just a moment.”

“Let’s get started already, I can’t wait to cut off your head.” Halo shouted.

“Buzz.” The young monarch used his sacred light to defend himself again. The aura of a dao lord suffocated those nearby, even forcing them down to the ground.

Swordgrasp and Halo also released their vitality. The former created a curtain of swords while the other’s halo expanded outward.

The three used the same strategy again - using their cultivation to prevent anything from getting close.

“Come, steal our fortune, show us your ominous power!” Halo challenged.

Li Qiye smiled and raised his hand: “You shall gain nothing, only banishment.”

He spoke with a casual tone and students didn’t notice anything peculiar.

The young monarch was the strongest and he didn’t sense anything special. He felt something weird back in the pawnshop but not now.

“Watch me, fool.” He became confident again and thought that Li Qiye was a dead man.

He sat cross-legged in front of Skyquake Dao Controller and extended his light.

“Wait for decapitation.” Swordgrasp didn’t feel anything peculiar and sneered. His target was Heaven Suppression Shawl.

“We got this.” Halo laughed, completely confident this time as he went for Immortal Beasts.

“Boom!” Suddenly, the three treasures released their power.

This was enough to shake the entire region. The three forces made everyone feel insignificant. Although the young monarch was a dragon lord already, he was still sent flying along with his two friends. This applied to the other students as well.

“Rumble!” They rolled down the mountain, completely helpless against these unstoppable forces.

Once they made it to the base, they were pale with fear.
