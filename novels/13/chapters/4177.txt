Chapter 4178: Prodigies And Heroes

The fifth grave was indeed dangerous. Nonetheless, this was justified by the potential rewards.

Unfortunately, the elders from Dao Institution were killed earlier, unable to open a path. Thus, the rest of the crowd could only watch.

Plenty of cultivators have tried before. Powerful defensive treasures and merit laws didn’t work, neither did artifacts with an anti-poison property.

Many speculated that one must rely on ultimate power to withstand the smoke. Other methods simply weren’t enough.

The actual smoke was a mystery as well. It could be a type of miasma but in that case, sacred artifacts and antidotes should work against it. If it was merely physical, then defensive treasures should show some efficiency.

Unfortunately, the smoke could infiltrate and bypass everything on top of being undispellable.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye only glanced at the smoke and didn’t have any intention of stopping.

The princess sighed while looking at it. She thought about picking up the corpses but this was beyond her right now. She would need someone else to pick up her corpse after trying.

The two continued strolling across the cemetery. Li Qiye took his time, completely unafraid of the hidden dangers. He didn’t seem to be seeking treasures either, just walking around aimlessly.

Nonetheless, she still assumed that he was here for a reason. She kept on following him and would do so for as long as he allowed. This was her best opportunity to see the magic and mysteries of the forbidden zones.

Strangely enough, they have been largely untouched outside of the first ambush. It felt as if the dangers here were staying away from Li Qiye.

They eventually made it to the base of a mountain. He looked up at the steep cliff and saw that it was weather-beaten.

Loud explosions and sword hymns were heard. A battle seemed to be raging ahead.

They saw two combatants fighting for quite a while now. The princess was surprised because they were her peers.

One was a member of the Ten Sword Prodigies, Chen Cangsheng. The other was one of the Four Weapon Heroes, Wavesplitter.

“Gather!” Wavesplitter roared and leaped upward, gathering waves of overbearing saber energy.

“Clank!” The next slash released unrestrained waves of energy and left a deep mark on the ground.

“Come!” Cheng Cangsheng roared and didn’t have the same scholarly air as before. His hair fluttered as his battle spirit surged. He held his head high and was ready to fight anyone to the death.

He raised his sword directly upward and released its power, ready to stop the incoming slash.

“Boom!” The impact destroyed everything nearby. Both sides staggered backward.

This was unsurprisingly an even fight. Both were prodigies from top sects.

Li Qiye wasn’t interested in their battle and moved closer to the cliff. However, those two had a different idea.

They immediately stopped and rushed over.

“Dao Brother Li, I saw this place first, so let’s share.” Chen Cangsheng maintained a polite tone.

On the other hand, Wavesplitter didn’t hold back: “We got here first, so wait in line.”

“Why are you two fighting?” The princess had a good idea but still asked.

“We’re just sparring.” Chen Cangsheng coughed.

“There’s definitely a sword grave here and we came at virtually the same time. That’s why we’re fighting, the winner takes the grave.” Wavesplitter revealed.

“Still haven’t caught the duck yet already debating on how to split it. Isn’t that idiotic?” Li Qiye smiled and stared at the cliff.

There were lines that seemed to be natural at first but upon closer inspection, they followed the order of the grand dao and resembled the lines on a blade. One could hear a faint hymn after spending enough time here.

The princess understood why these two were fighting. Even if this cliff wasn’t a grave, it should still be special in some way.

“You’re right, Dao Brother, I am being impatient.” Chen Cangsheng smiled wryly.

“Hmph, it’s none of your business.” Wavesplitter didn’t like Li Qiye in the first place so he snorted.

“True, but annoy me and I’ll let you taste the dirt on the ground.” Li Qiye glanced at him.

“Hmph, the members of our clans are not afraid of trouble!” He tightened his grip on his saber.

“I’ve never been one to care about background, provoke me and it’ll end the same for anyone.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Wavesplitter wasn’t stupid and knew all about Li Qiye’s devilish abilities. This rich young master wasn’t one to be trifled with. However, it wasn’t easy dealing with Li Qiye’s contemptuous attitude. Reason stopped him from attacking Li Qiye so he calmed down.

Even Scion Abyss’ group lost to Li Qiye; he didn’t have much confidence in winning.

“There’s something here.” A melodious voice interrupted their conversation.

A girl came over with a group of experts. Among them was a white-haired cultivator with a cold gaze. Halos emanated from him and refined the nearby spatial fabrics - a testament to his power despite him purposely containing it.

“Illusory Princess!” Wavesplitter’s expression soured.

Li Qiye alone was already a big headache. Now, the princess and her men were here too. It would be impossible to monopolize this grave now.

“You!” The princess wasn’t happy to see Li Qiye and gritted her teeth.

“You’re Li Qiye?” The powerful old man glared at him.

Alas, he ignored them and focused on the lines.

“Li Qiye, be smart and leave. We want this grave.” She remained imperious despite having lost before. This time, she came with a strong backer.
