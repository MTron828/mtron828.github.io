Solitary left in a lonely manner, true to his title. The crowd had nothing to say since this was the best result. His death would be quite regrettable.

“Your turn now.” Li Qiye turned towards his enemies and coldly uttered.

All eyes were on Myriad-armed and his group now. Their three systems have gathered and must work together since they stood no chance alone versus Li Qiye.

With Solitary’s defeat, it meant that their strongest Ascenders were no match for him. Though they were eighth-level True Gods, the gap between them and Solitary was massive. Possessing a number advantage was useless.

At the Ascender level, the power disparity couldn’t be made up by adding one or two combatants.

Even if Myriad-armed and Blade-reaper worked together, they wouldn’t have been able to beat Solitary.

Thus, though the alliance had almost ten Ascenders, they wouldn’t be able to touch Li Qiye at all. This, in turn, meant that a massacre was incoming.

The ancestors were the pillars of any system, losing them would mean a great loss. The three systems would need several generations to make this up. The alliance was aggressive earlier, thinking that they had the advantage. But now, their expression became austere with a touch of pessimism.

Escaping was not an option for it would result in a complete loss of face. Plus, Li Qiye wouldn’t let them run either.

There was only one choice - fight to the death!

“Death is nothing in the pursuit of justice against evil!” Myriad-armed sounded quite heroic.

“Stop it.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve: “No need for such grand rhetoric before me. It’s not like I haven’t seen your pitiful state after losing. If it wasn’t for Pill King and the others, I would have decapitated all of you.”

Myriad-armed became red. He only wanted to re-establish his stance and seize the moral high ground on top of building the courage to fight, but this verbal slap from Li Qiye ruined it all.

“Li, to a warrior, death is preferable to humiliation!” He shouted back.

“Unfortunately, you’re no warrior.” Li Qiye chuckled: “So much weaker compared to Solitary Sword God, let’s not flatter yourselves now.”

The group glared at him but couldn’t do anything about it.

“Our three systems will work to destroy the evil that is...” Blade-reaper began.

Li Qiye didn’t care: “I know, I know, I didn’t say that you can’t go together. Don’t worry, I’ll give you time to use your best move. Just all come at once to make this faster.”

“Fine, we won’t refuse then!” Blade-reaper waited for this.

If Li Qiye were to use his quick-draw to start, many ancestors on their side would instantly die.

“I’m waiting.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

The ancestors naturally disliked being shown such contempt by Li Qiye. They were big shots in Myriad Lineage, and anyone would tread carefully against their alliance.

Nevertheless, they restrained themselves and must come up with a greater plan in order to annihilate Li Qiye.

After a while, Li Qiye floated up and asked: “Are you prepared?”

He looked at them as if they were already dead. The crowd took a deep breath after seeing his confidence.

They knew that he wasn’t all talk, completely capable of slaughtering everyone here.

“To the death!” Blade-reaper coldly uttered.

He stood at the center while the rest lined up around him. Though he wasn’t the strongest Ascender, he still became their core.

The guy raised a treasure bowl, full of blood, not just his alone but of all the ancestors and experts here.

So it turned out that during the fight between Li Qiye and Solitary, they have come up with a plan, gathering a little blood from everyone to fill this bowl.

This was the true blood of these ancestors, very precious in nature. Now, Blade-reaper had a stoic expression as he took out a tiny bottle covered in powerful seals. It was obvious that the sealer was an amazing character.

The spectators became curious - what was inside this bottle? Some stretched their neck to have a better look.

“Pop!” He removed the seals.

“Boom!” A wave of light surged to the sky and illuminated the entire area like the explosion of countless suns.

A divinity billowed, one that could cross from one era to another - completely untouchable.

“The aura of a progenitor!” Even ancestors shuddered from astonishment and fear.

The weak couldn’t handle this power, no different from a progenitor being here in person.

Just one single drop of blood came out of the bottle, resembling a ruby more than blood. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“A drop of true blood!” One ancestor blurted.

People were naturally shocked. One drop of true blood from a progenitor was priceless.

“Heavenstart Saber Progenitor’s true blood...” Another sensed the saber energy from the drop.

This explained why Blade-reaper became the nucleus of their plan. He was the only one who could take out this item.
