Chapter 4450: Nameless Tablet

“Yes and no.” Li Qiye had a strange half-smile on his face as he answered. His eyes appeared profound, seemingly remembering and thinking about something.

The demon didn’t understand Li Qiye’s expression. The guy seemingly turned into a statue and was traveling elsewhere.

He got the impression that the Li Qiye earlier no longer existed. This man before him had turned into someone else - one that has lived for countless years dating back to the start of time.

Despite a lack of tyrannical aura and energy ripples, this form was rather impressive in the demon’s eyes. He believed that the current Li Qiye had the cosmo within his grasp. Gods and devils would tremble in fear before the ruler of all.

Naturally, his knees started buckling as well. He felt a strong urge to kneel and prostrate before a superior being.

A while ago, Li Qiye released his energy and it was truly unbeatable. Now, this mortal form frightened the demon god even more.

He started imagining Li Qiye activating his energy in this state and couldn’t come up with anything. This was simply beyond his imagination.

He took a deep breath and channeled his merit laws to calm his dao heart. The trembling finally stopped.

He then turned his attention to the slab instead. Time passed by and only failure awaited him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Where is this opportunity for immortality…” He murmured helplessly.

He wasn’t foolish enough to think that it would be so simple. Nonetheless, the manifestation caught him by surprise.

He could see that the mysteries would be hidden in a perfect manner. However, this unique opportunity should have released a special phenomenon. For example - the image of an immortal world, the mysterious reincarnation cycle, the transformation and derivation of the yin and yang…

In this case, there was only a nameless slab and zero visual phenomenon.

“I’m too weak.” He sighed and gave up.

After all, even peerless existences couldn’t obtain immortality. He was nothing compared to the wise sages in history.

In the present days, others worshiped him as a great demon god. Alas, he himself knew that he was just an average cultivator when compared to the brilliant dao lords and matchless historical cultivators.

His self-awareness allowed him to give up and be at peace. There was no need to force the issue.

As for Li Qiye, he started rubbing the tablet in a slow yet rhythmic manner, akin to the flow of the waves or the tapping of the grand dao.

His hand released sacred rays as a result. They were primordial and reversed space back to a chaotic state.

They seemed to be there at the start of the world and have witnessed history. They traveled through time to reach the present and didn’t change in the slightest. Time and external changes had no effect on them.

The slab reacted and released identical rays. “Buzz.” The rays from two different sources started twisting together as if this was their destiny.

The demon god felt his grand dao resonating with this phenomenon. His dao laws appeared and were out of his control. Something greater was summoning his power.

This was naturally not pleasant, losing control of one’s own grand dao.

Enough rays came out to engulf the entire tablet. The area around it appeared to be the mysterious primordial chaos.

Next came a loud yet distant explosion. Perhaps this was the explosion that started the world itself. Now, this sound finally came to the present day.

With this explosion, the primordial chaos was split open and primordial energy poured out like mercury. In just the blink of an eye, it took over the entire valley.

Primordial energy was the most basic type of energy for cultivators. As a demon god, he had accumulated an impressive amount of energy in his life. Alas, it was only a drop compared to the flood coming out of the explosion.

“Is this the chance?!” He blurted out.

Alas, the dense primordial energy suddenly disappeared. He thought that the slab had absorbed it completely.

Everything became normal again outside of one change - a diagram finally appeared on the nameless tablet.

It was the image of a crow, depicted with awfully few lines yet looking animated. The crow seemingly wanted to fly away from the slab to reach the nine heavens. He could even feel its aura and the gales from its flapping wings.

Simplicity didn’t diminish the vividness of the effect the diagram had on him. He could see wings large enough to blot out the sky, raising a dark curtain over the entire world.

He didn’t know what to feel. He had seen visual phenomena of phoenixes before but now, he felt the urge to prostrate before this crow diagram.
