Chapter 4635: Grand Dao Golden Bulls

Everyone could tell that this youth didn’t come from a humble background. With this disadvantage, one would have to participate in numerous battles before becoming this strong.

There was no way they could be so strong during their debut. This was because they lacked the right merit law and cultivation resources. Only time and experience could help them grow stronger.

Therefore, to rise up meant surviving one battle after another, accumulating power through blood and sweat.

This maturity process included defeating many capable cultivators. Becoming famous was inevitable. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

If a youth were to come out of nowhere and be this powerful, it often implied that he came from an impressive lineage. Only such lineages had the ability to groom a capable cultivator in such a short time without relying on battle experiences.

After all, they would have enough members to contend among themselves, not to mention the guidance of seniors and ancestors.

True Immortal Spirit’s technique was incredibly impressive but his opponent still managed to keep up. It became clear that their cultivation was about even.

How many youths were in this category? Currently, Paramount Scion, Godwhip Princess, and Jadedragon Monarch were present.

They all came from monstrous lineages and were famous. The same should be the case for Xiao San.

“Do you notice anything?” Many big shots activated their heavenly gaze.

One shook her head and was lost like the rest. They felt that there was something hiding his true background.

“Haha, I’m just a nobody with no background to speak of.” Xiao San laughed in response.

“A nobody managed to block my Era Raiser?” True Immortal Spirit didn’t buy it: “You clearly came wanting a fight, why bother hiding your background?”

“You think too highly of me, I’ve only trained in a few average techniques, nothing more.” Xiao San didn’t reveal his background.

“Senior Diamond, please don’t play a joke on my junior brother.” A distant voice came from the horizon yet everyone heard the words clearly.

They contained an imperial aura as if a young emperor was speaking. Listeners could already see a lord sitting among the clouds.

This aura became increasingly unbearable, causing everyone to get the urge to prostrate. Auspicious clouds replaced regular ones and created a path for a great force.

Banners fluttered to the wind and were carried by spirited young cultivators. They had magnificent appearances and cultivation. Any of them would be considered a top genius in a great power.

Hope and awe would be the first two emotions felt after seeing this group. They wore the same uniform and pulsed radiantly. They looked like children of the gods visiting the mortal world for the first time.

“True Immortal!” Spectators became emotional. How many other sects in Sky Border could muster a force like this?

“Rumble!” A grinding sound came next as if a heavy chariot was crushing the sky.

Eight golden bulls came into sight. Each was as big as a peak and had bulging muscles. Their horns were bright, looking like treasure blades. Their eyes resembled bells with incredible divinity.

“Grand Dao Golden Bulls, extremely rare auspicious beasts!” A big shot recognized the species.

They were also unreasonably expensive. Seeing one was hard enough, let alone owning eight of them.

Normally, great power treated one bull as a guardian deity or a mount for their strongest ancient ancestor. Their preciousness displayed True Immortal’s wealth and resources.

The chariot was cast from an ancient bronze with incalculable weight. It could easily crush a mountain without slowing down. Bright dao lord runes were clearly carved on the hull, resulting in an unstoppable empowerment.

This was obviously a dao lord treasure capable of fast traveling and stopping any offense. The crowd started speculating about the person inside the chariot.
