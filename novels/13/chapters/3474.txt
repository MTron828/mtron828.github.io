The stillness became unbearably eerie. They stared at Li Qiye as if wanting to eat him alive.

“How lively.” He didn’t mind at all and smiled at the mass.

Many shuddered after seeing this smile. Li Qiye was only a Silver Carapace yet he had such a calm bearing before the powerful crowd. It was as if he was looking down on inferior beings.

Nothing happened yet. It was unwise being the first to make a move instead of waiting for a better opportunity. It would be best to watch the impatient groups massacre themselves first.

Unfortunately, everyone harbored this thought so stagnation continued.

“What did the emperor leave behind?” One spectator got bored and shouted at Li Qiye.

Everyone naturally listened attentively, waiting to hear an answer. Their eyes became redder and greedier like a pack of hungry wolves. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The emperor was considered one of the most brilliant Immortal Emperors, the last of their kind. Her treasury encompassed all the treasures of the nine worlds, perhaps the largest one in history. Their greed seemed justified after putting things into perspective.

“The treasury?” Li Qiye smiled after seeing their expression.

Each word of his right now stirred the crowd. So even though he purposely spoke slowly to tease them, they still remained patient.

“There’s nothing in there, only scrap metals.” He concluded.

No one believed him despite this actually being the case. They exchanged glances of doubts.

They saw him entering the dao portal and he certainly got the treasury. Plus, the emperor should have left something behind.

“Hmph, who are you trying to trick?” One older expert snorted: “The emperor possessed the greatest treasury in the world. No one will believe your nonsense.”

Others nodded in agreement because his answer was too illogical.

“Up to you, I don’t care either way.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively.

“That treasury has items belonging to everyone in the nine worlds. It should be given back to the descendants. Everyone should have a share.” Another old cultivator said.

Robbing Li Qiye would be improper since some of them were from righteous sects. How could they attack a junior without the right justification? It would ruin their sect’s reputation.

That’s why they needed the right excuse regardless of how forced it was.

“True, true.” The crowd applauded and agreed. Another expert from a big sect said: “The treasures of the world belong to the wise and capable, not you alone.”

“Yes, it’s for all to share. Take it out now.” One ancestor fanned the fire.

“Don’t make the mistake of monopolizing it out of greed.”

The crowd loudly shouted, forcing him to hand the treasury over before taking action.

“You all look like crowns right now, a bunch of ruffians trying to act all dignified. How shameful for the righteous sects to stoop down to this level.” Li Qiye was amused.

A few of the shouters earlier turned red but most didn’t care.

“Hand it over or everyone will attack!” An impatient crowd member shouted.

“That’s right, don’t think about leaving with it.” Another guy pointed his weapon at Li Qiye, ready to attack.

“I see. Fine, I’ll deliver all of you to the next life.” Li Qiye had a smirk on.

Normally, a Silver Carapace was no threat at all but Li Qiye managed to deter some of them. They shuddered after recalling how he massacred multiple armies not long ago. The brutal carnage still haunted them so his words carried plenty of weight.

No one wanted to be the first to try since death might be the result.

“Foolish and cowardly.” Li Qiye shook his head.

This disdain still wasn’t enough to force anyone to attack him. They all wanted to wait for someone else to go first.

“Boom!” An old man interrupted the stalemate and landed in front of Skylight’s army.

“Prepare the formation!” He shouted.

“Rumble!” The high-morale soldiers moved to the right position, raising their weapons and shield.

They were just watching earlier until this man came. Now, they were ready for battle.

“The national teacher of Skylight.” The vanguards of the crowd retreated after seeing him.

“He’s actually here.” Most felt dread after seeing the old man.

He was a fierce character in charge of Skylight, having conquered the nearby territories. His hands were stained with blood.

“Clank!” Next, a divine sword landed and pinned on the ground, causing a loud blast.

It looked just like a peak due to its size. People who looked up saw another old man; his robe fluttered to the wind. He seemed to be an unsheathed sword due to a sharp, rampaging aura.

“Firmaments Sect Master.” A few recognized him.

The dead godchild was his direct disciple. He embarked on the path of the sword, having killed many opponents and gaining notoriety during his youth.
