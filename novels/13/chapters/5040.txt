Chapter 5041: On The Right Track

The presence of these two masters would shock and intimidate anyone. One nearly had seven sacred fruits while the other had four dao fruits.

The youths became nervous and didn’t dare to breathe loudly.

“Fate brought us together again, Fellow Daoist.” The duo didn’t expect to see Li Qiye either.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye smiled.

Meanwhile, the thousand faces of the sovereign focused on Li Qiye. Being gazed upon by this being was an inexplicable feeling.

The youths felt as if they have become transparent. Everything about them could be seen clearly - whether it be their pores or veins. Even the slightest movement was detected.

In fact, he could even derive their merit laws and origins. Secrets and flaws were as clear as day.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Despite the intrusive nature of the gaze, Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind at all.

“I apologize.” The sovereign bowed and said: “It’s a terrible habit but I couldn’t help myself after seeing your cultivation fortunes.”

“Saw anything interesting?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I only saw a chaotic expanse, nothing else.” Thousand-faced Sovereign was embarrassed.

Truth Conqueror was surprised because he should have been able to see at least some clues. Few could hide everything from him.

“I’m just a regular cultivator, that’s why there is nothing to see.” Li Qiye said.

“If you’re a regular cultivator, then where do the rest of us stand?” Truth Conqueror smiled and shook her head.

He was famous at this point for killing the various dragon lords. In fact, most believed that only Conceal Conqueror was a match for him.

Due to his insane battle potential, everyone speculated that he was from the upper continents.

“Fellow Daoist, you must be from the upper two or even the immortal continent, right?” Thousand-faced Sovereign asked.

“No, but I do plan on going up there to take a look soon.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The two masters exchanged glances and had a sense of foreboding, that this guy would cause a lot of trouble up there.

“If there’s nothing else, goodbye.” Li Qiye said.

The sovereign hesitated for a moment before asking: “Fellow Daoist, I do not question your strength. It’s just that there are dangers hiding here right now, please be careful.”

His sincerity amused Li Qiye who continued the conversation: “What danger do you speak of, Sovereign?”

Truth Conqueror answered instead: “We have been thinking and researching it. A villain is lurking in the shadows to ambush others.”

The youths heard this and wanted to talk about Phenomena Conqueror. However, would he believe them at all?

“I hope that it’ll happen to me since it’ll be entertaining.” Li Qiye said.

The two exchanged glances again. The sovereign said: “You are strong enough to be fearless.”

It was up to the guy to heed his warning.

“Your Majesty, have you figured out anything?” Ming Shi asked nervously, truly wanting to spill the beans.

Despite being a genius from Untethered, she was just another disciple when standing in front of the two masters.

Truth smiled and appreciated her courage before answering: “Nothing concrete, only a few speculations.”

She was modest and open-minded, not displaying a hint of arrogance.

Ming Shi was truly tempted to bring up Phenomena Conqueror but managed to keep her mouth shut.

“Do you have something on your mind, Little Sister?” The conqueror asked.

Ming Shi shook her head and didn’t respond.

“If I were you two, I would just stay in my sect.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“What makes you say that, Fellow Daoist?” The sovereign said.

“You two are looking for someone who has a penchant for devouring cultivators.” Li Qiye had no qualms.

The two were stirred after hearing this despite their experience.

“Could you elaborate, Dao Brother?” Truth hurriedly said.

“There’s nothing much to say since you lack information.” Li Qiye waved his hand before finishing: “But, I can say that you’re on the right track. From my estimate, he has reached a power level where ordinary dragon lords aren’t enough. However, a six-fruit dragon lord or a four-fruit conqueror, that’s another story.”

They didn’t have proof before but Li Qiye’s words seemed to serve as confirmation.

“Old man, you aren’t as delicious, not a real target.” Li Qiye glanced at the sovereign first before speaking to Truth: “The same can’t be said about you. Four dao fruits are one thing but most importantly, you are nobility so your bloodline is the finest delicacy.”

The listeners present shuddered after hearing this.

“Do you have any evidence at all, Dao Brother?” Truth asked.

“Well, we have found the missing people or rather, their corpses. Void Saint Child, Sword Lord, all of them. Need I say more?” Li Qiye nodded.

“Fellow Daoist, who do you think the culprit is?” Thousand-faced Sovereign took a deep breath before asking.
