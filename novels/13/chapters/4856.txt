Chapter 4857: Unknown Guests

“Ahh!” Blood splashed and Pyromancer disappeared from sight. He only used the powerful fiery dragon to buy enough time to escape, having no intention to fight in the first place.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Few found this surprising despite Pyromancer’s prestigious status as a dragon lord. These villains had no morality to speak of.

This wouldn’t be the case in Deity or Heaven Burial. These righteous lineages cared about their reputation and righteousness. Their members preferred an honorable death over a disgraceful survival. This included regular disciples, let alone sovereigns and dragon lords.

Pyromancer knew that he had no chance of surviving after the fifth-ranked Bloodsea. A hero didn’t care for immediate losses, only the bigger pictures. Others could call him a coward and he still wouldn’t give a damn.

Other villains debated leaving since anything else would be suicidal. This was rather strange because Bloodsea was a lonewolf who didn’t have any friend. Why did he want to protect the dao lord’s corpse?

“Anyone else?” Bloodsea’s cold eyes scouted the surroundings. Everyone met by the gaze immediately trembled in fear and backed off.

Few in Chaos could actually fight him, not counting the top four rankers.

“No? Then scram.” He uttered coldly.

Though many became annoyed at his aggressive attitude, they still left in order to avoid being killed by him.

“I’m still interested.” A harmonious voice answered him. It came from a man standing on top of a tree by the front of a forest.

He wore a gray robe and black cloth shoes, looking rather conspicuous. His face, for some reason, was a blur.

Spectators suddenly stopped leaving and exchanged glances. Someone daring to oppose Bloodsea must also be immensely powerful.

Alas, no one could see through the blurry phenomenon. This was rather rare in Chaos because the villains had no problem being held accountable for their atrocities. In fact, they looked down on those who hide their identity.

“Who are you?” Bloodsea’s eyes glimmered with sharp intent.

“Just a nobody. I come without malice, only wanting to see Eight-stallion Dao Lord for a bit. In particular, the destroyed dao fruits.” The old man said.

“Ask my blade first.” Bloodsea raised his saber.

“So be it.” The old man wasn’t afraid.

His attitude made Bloodsea serious. The latter had a bad feeling about this.

In the grand scheme of things, Bloodsea wasn’t the strongest in the lower continents. However, he had met the dragon lords and dao lords before. Was this man one of them?

“Take this!” Bloodsea unsheathed his saber again.

Saber intents immediately cut all the trees in that forest within a thousand miles radius.

“Clank!” He swung and released a bloody slash.

The movement was too fast for most spectators. This horrified the hell out of them while feeling sharp pricks from the intent.

It left a bottomless gash on the ground. This time, it affected a straight line of ten thousand miles in that forest, destroying everything.

Bloodsea’s techniques lacked variation and ingenuity. They were direct and fatal.

The old man flashed into disappeared for a second before appearing again, allowing him to evade the slash.

This was rather hard to believe due to the swift precision of the slash. Bloodsea realized that this enemy was rather frightening. Worst of all, he knew nothing about him.

“You’re not from Chaos.” He speculated.

The crowd wondered which continent he was from, and which lineage? Deity? Heaven Burial? Immortal Platform? Or Untethered…

“I am a passerby, where I am is home, so Chaos is my current home.” The mysterious cultivator smiled.

“I’ve never seen you before.” Bloodsea said, aware that the foe was stronger than him. He tried to think about the potential matches in the lower continents but couldn’t come up with anyone.

“Now let me take a look?” The cultivator walked forward and ignored the guards.

“You dare?!” The guards readied their spear and shield.

“This is unnecessary.” He flicked his finger and repelled the guards in front of him, leaving behind a chasm.

“So strong!” Everyone including Bloodsea took a deep breath.

“I’ve finally found you.” However, another old combatant blocked his path.

He had a refined and dignified appearance, seemingly glowing. This was as grand as can be - akin to a pine tree growing on the side of a cliff - not afraid of winds and rains.

He had an unhurried temperament - a calmness obtained after experiencing countless near-death opponents. The world could change drastically for the worse yet his composure would always be the same.
