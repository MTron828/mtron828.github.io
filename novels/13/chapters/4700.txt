Chapter 4701: Being Unbeatable Is That Simple

“The dao is long and arduous. I will spare you today, feel free to challenge me again in the future.” Li Qiye smiled at Tian Feng before leaving with his group.

The crowd watched his departing figure in silence.

“Bam!” The dying Tian Feng also leaped up and disappeared.

Some were impressed since he was still able to move despite his feeble state. Others wouldn’t have been able to move an inch.

The battle left plenty for the group to think about. They wondered how to recount this story accurately in order to get people to believe them.

The youths, in particular, didn’t know what to think. The majority of the young generation adored the five conquerors and thought that one of them would become the dao lord.

Alas, a new monster has arrived - Li Qiye. He suffocated them and shattered their faith. It seemed that he had a far greater chance of winning versus the other five.

“Li Qiye, debuting late yet is still ahead in the race.” An old ancestor concluded: “He’s absolutely first place right now in my eyes for the dao competition, the other conquerors aren’t even close.”

No one refuted him and pondered in silence instead. Li Qiye’s vocal supporters were no longer mocked.

Meanwhile, the big shots started thinking about the implications.

“Who can actually stop Li Qiye from becoming a dao lord?” One youth asked.

His senior stared at the horizon and said: “No other conquerors can beat him in a one-on-one fight, not the young emperor or Shen Juntian.”

“It’s unbelievable but true.” Others had no choice but to accept this reality.

Though the conquerors had peerless talent and resources, they couldn’t touch Li Qiye in a fight. Tian Feng’s utter defeat was the perfect example.

Li Qiye made it look effortless since he only used his bare hands and simplistic movements. This made his standing clear - somewhere far above the geniuses.

“Fortunately, the competition doesn’t only consist of solo fights. The dao fruit, sure, it requires personal comprehension and enlightenment but as for external matters such as enemies? It’ll be an inter-sect conflict.”

Sure, the heirs would need to search for the mysteries of the dao fruit during the process. This required personal enlightenment regardless of how much help they got from their ancient ancestors.

If they couldn’t prove their dao, then becoming a dao lord was impossible. Their background and sect couldn’t do anything about this.

This process has been recognized and accepted by cultivators for eras now. The heirs would have to face many perils and opponents. One of the most important factors included their own lineage. This became rather important given the current situation where Li Qiye was far above the rest.

“I wonder what Li Qiye’s background is.” An expert whispered: “True Immortal Young Emperor has the monarchs from his sect, the same for Shen Juntian with his six monarchs and even Dao Sanqian. If Li Qiye is truly alone, it doesn’t look favorable for him.”

Once True Immortal or Three Thousand Dao became serious, these top masters could actually take action to eliminate Li Qiye. If he didn’t have sufficiently powerful dao protectors, he would die on this path.

“The five conquerors might team up too, that’s another unsolvable dilemma.” An ancestor said.

Others knew that such an alliance would be the greatest force in Sky Border. In this case, Li Qiye would face a dead end for his dao path.

“I think this might happen because Li Qiye is too frightening.” A clan ancestor agreed.

Li Qiye shined too brightly currently. The five conquerors must eliminate Li Qiye for any of them to have a chance. Therefore, an alliance to kill Li Qiye seemed inevitable and it wouldn’t be difficult.

On top of a verdant hill with a heavenly waterfall, True Immortal Young Emperor sat underneath the shade of a pine tree and enjoyed fine tea. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A majestic and regal aura suddenly arrived. The guest was none other than Five-sun King.

He stood in front of the emperor and smiled: “You’re in a good mood, Brother.”

“You are a welcome sight for sore eyes, Brother Five-sun.” The emperor smiled, looking like a lord from an upper realm looking down on his subjects.

Two disciples from True Immortal hurriedly prepared a mat for Five-sun King to sit down. Next came the tea.

“It’s good.” Five-sun King took a sip and said.

Immortal energy then manifested out of nowhere yet it was pleasant like the autumn wind. A person unstained by the mortal coil appeared, inciting gasps of admiration everywhere he went - Shen Juntian.

“I’ve received your invitation.” He sat down next to the two.
