Chapter 4455: Seed

The area became enriched with primordial laws and powers. These were the strongest and most eternal affinities. Alas, the temporal flood still withered them.

It contained the power of billions of years all focused on the same target. The transformations of the worlds happened in the blink of an eye. This could make oceans turn into mulberry fields in an instant. A dao lord here would be reduced to dust, unable to resist this temporal force.

The primordial laws continued to heal and rebuild themselves. Alas, the other side attacked relentlessly. They couldn’t handle the withering and started to crack.

“Boom!” This gave room for the flood to strike Li Qiye directly.

“Activate!” He was prepared and roared, turning his body into an immortal fortress containing all the laws. In fact, calling it a primordial cosmo wasn’t an exaggeration.

The flood immediately entered his cosmic form. Despite its colossal size, it was still being affected by the withering force of time intending on reducing it to a speck of dust.

Li Qiye channeled his immortal rays internally in order to sweep away the invasion. The rays contained boundless life force and slowly healed the rotting areas.

Alas, the temporal flood seemed to have taken roots in his body and continued an unending cycle.

He saw the past again, albeit unwillingly - bringing a hot-blooded youth around the world, seeking a fortune for a young lady, burying one friend after another…

This process continued again and again until it brought in the power of karma. The karmic tribulation of the massacres carried out when he was the Dark Crow joined the power of time.

“Sever!” His true fate joined the battle and started eradicating the karmic tribulation.

Finally, radiance took over his internal body and turned it into an immortal world. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Crack!” His energy blade cut through the crow’s forehead. The light in there dispersed and something rolled out into his palm.

He took a look and saw that it was a seed. Yes, a seed around the size of a finger with a gray hue.

Just like the nest and the crow, it appeared regular at first. However, only the strongest characters would be able to see a particular ray circling around the seed. This wasn’t always present since it pulsed in and out of existence continuously.

Noticing this was akin to being on the river of time, surrounded by loneliness and silence. In the duality between eternality and ephemeral pulsing, one could suddenly sense an opportunity to grasp everlasting life. The ongoing pulse gave the best glimpse into what would be construed as everlasting life.

“Everlasting life, coveted by all.” Li Qiye sentimentally commented. He was too familiar with this feeling in the past.

“Old man, it had to happen. It would be too unfair if you had immortality as well. It’s just that your gamble was too risky.” He said while staring at the seed.

He knew what the old man wanted to do. Unfortunately, the latter couldn’t control everything.

In the beginning, he thought that he could control the Dark Crow. Alas, his puppet managed to sever all ties and escape the control of the grotto. The thing he didn’t take into account was Li Qiye’s immovable dao heart.

The old man expended untold efforts and resources in order to create an everlasting crow. This was another way to return to the world. Alas, all of these calculations were in vain since Li Qiye eventually gained complete freedom. Because of this, the grotto failed during the final attack. Its ace card was already gone.

Now, Li Qiye had in his hand a legend coveted by all cultivators. Most importantly, it used to be his companion for a long time and helped him accomplish many things.

Though his dao heart was unique, it wasn’t enough to let him walk on the dao path forever without the seed.

“Old man, close your eyes and rest. Though I do not inherit your will, feel free to watch my next move.” Li Qiye smiled.

Having said that, he put away the seed. He glanced at the crow in the nest and this world one last time before leaving.

Everything started here and this was the final ark for the Dark Crow. From now on, it began with Li Qiye.
