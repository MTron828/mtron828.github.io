Chapter 4152: Chaos Seal Formation

The combined power of Abyss Scion and the seniors would be virtually unstoppable. A junior like Li Qiye seemed suicidal for challenging all of them at once.

“I think he actually has a chance in a one-on-one fight against Abyss Scion, but this is ridiculous.” One expert murmured.

“Li Qiye is consistently domineering, overbearing, and most importantly, undefeated. He just keeps on becoming stronger and stronger through various methods.” A few actually liked Li Qiye’s odds.

“Sure but there has to be a limit. It’s not like he’ll be able to challenge dao lords.” A last-gen cultivator didn’t buy it.

“I wonder what the brat has up his sleeve to be so confident.”

By this point, everyone knew that Li Qiye was not a fool nor was he crazy. Though they hated his personality, they recognized his abilities to a certain extent. The problem here was that they saw no path towards victory for Li Qiye.

The scion and the others didn’t buy it either but rage and confusion blinded them. They couldn’t come up with a reason for his confidence.

“Are you sure you want to take on all of us alone?” The scion glared at him.

They assumed that Lu Qi would be helping in some way. That’s the only way for him to win.

“Don’t worry, if I say I’m doing this alone, I’ll be alone.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Accept.” Wandao Jian told Abyss Scion, clearly wanting to kill Li Qiye.

The scion took a deep breath and said: “So be it, we will entertain you. Prepare your best merit laws and treasures then…”

His eyes flashed greedily only for a moment. Everyone coveted Li Qiye’s treasures, himself included.

His allies and the members of the crowd had a similar reaction. Killing Li Qiye here meant seizing his resources.

“If Sea Emperor can get another dozen dao lord weapons…” One crowd member didn’t dare to finish this thought.

Others became emotional. Sea Emperor’s capital already had plenty of dao lord weapons. If they could get Li Qiye’s weapons too? This would start an age of dominance never seen before in this region.

Normally, Wandao Jian and the others cared about their reputation and prestige. This prevented them from attacking Li Qiye as a group.

However, he was the one challenging them in this case. This gave them all the justification needed to kill him and take his treasures. No one could criticize them afterward; Li Qiye would be the one at fault due to his insolence.

Thus, this scenario was developing favorably for Wandao Tian and Sea Emperor.

“Sigh, so much time wasted over some trivial crap. I don’t need dao lord weapons to kill some little lizards, just a brick would be enough.” Li Qiye said dismissively, once again fanning the fire.

“Junior, I will flay you!” One elder from Sea Emperor gritted his teeth.

Li Qiye waved his hand as if he was swatting a fly: “I was wrong, you’re more of an annoying fly than a lizard.”

Meanwhile, the crowd started discussing among themselves.

“The money fall method again?” One expert quietly said: “Maybe he can win if he uses enough dao lord refined jades.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I can’t wait to see the amount necessary to defeat that group.” Another agreed.

“We’re ready to see your money fall method.” Abyss Scion unsheathed his weapon.

His group also believed that Li Qiye would be using this method for the battle. Thus, they glanced at each other and nodded before spreading out. They paid particular attention to their position.

“Activate!” Wandao Jian roared and began releasing laws from his hands. Dao runes appeared beneath his feet and spread outward.

The other elders did the same; similar runes also appeared beneath them.

“Buzz.” The runes wove together to form a diagram large enough to affect this area. The laws released by Wandao Jian became empowered and pinned themselves into the spatial fabrics.

Chaos energy and dao were sealed inside its area of effect. The spectators found themselves becoming powerless.

“What is this formation?” An astounded expert bellowed. Losing chaos true energy would frighten anyone.

“Mmm, not bad. Using this Chaos Seal Formation to deal with money fall.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So that’s what it is!” A neutral ancestor heard the name and recognized it.

“You’ve heard of it before?” His friend asked.

“It is a sealing formation meant for chaos energy. Remember, money fall is a secret method capable of controlling this energy. Thus, the formation is its nemesis.” The ancestor responded.

“I’ve heard of a particular rumor regarding Sea Emperor and its intent on solving all the secret arts in the world. Their wise sages for generations have researched this matter. In other words, they probably figured out how to deal with money fall as well.” A different ancestor added.

Others exchanged glances at this dreadful possibility. Most great powers didn’t have the resources and ability to do this but Sea Emperor was a different story.
