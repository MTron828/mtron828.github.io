Chapter 3700: Unique Weapon

Most were stunned while looking at the massive bronze statue. How would one use it as a weapon? Lift and smash it at the regiment?

This wasn’t a bad idea due to the weight of the statue. However, this would still greatly limit the user’s movement and actual abilities since it was too cumbersome.

Attention fell on Li Qiye. Would he actually use it?

Li Qiye chuckled and glanced at the monk.

“Young Master, try and see if you would like it. If not, forget about it.” The monk put on a forced smile.

The spectators didn’t know the underlying story. They thought that Untethered Monk was Li Qiye’s backer.

After all, people would think twice if Li Qiye had his support. This applied to the two powerful clans as well.

Only Li Qiye and the monk actually knew what was going on. The latter wanted to know the mysteries of the statue. How would one use it as a weapon?

This question has been haunting him. The ancestors of Wish Ward have failed to understand the statue. His only hope was Li Qiye.

He couldn’t directly ask Li Qiye to divulge the method to them. They gave him a precious metal but to ask for the solution would turn the whole thing into an unsavory exchange of benefits.

Thus, the monk took advantage of this opportunity in a tactful manner.

Li Qiye understood the monk’s intent. The guy wanted to know but couldn’t ask or negotiate.

“Fine, then watch carefully. I won’t repeat the instruction.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Amitabha, thank you, Young Master.” The monk bowed with a dignified expression, feeling immensely grateful. Li Qiye had no obligation to tell them the method. They wouldn’t dare to demand it from him either.

Meanwhile, the spectators didn’t understand the bow. It looked as if it was an honor to support Li Qiye right now. The whole thing seemed ridiculous.

The monk then smiled towards the soldiers of the regiment and said: “I have no business here since I’m just an errand boy. Feel free to continue, gentlemen.”

Having said that, he waved his sleeve cooly and floated into the air, leaving the battlefield.

The soldiers and generals heaved a sigh of relief, the same with the Grand Commander, Grand Chancellor, and the ancestors from the two clans.

The direct involvement of the monk would ruin their plan. Their two clans together still weren’t a match for him unless they could invite their ancestors from the ancestral ground. However, these older ancestors wouldn’t come out without an existential crisis.

Li Qiye smiled at the soldiers and said: “My merciful self will let you all start first so at least there’ll be a chance.”

The soldiers became livid and red from the blatant disdain. They weren’t used to this treatment due to their reputation at the holy ground.

“Vanguards, assume your position! The blood of the enemy shall bolster our prestige!” The general of the regiment shouted.

“The blood of the enemy shall bolster our prestige!” The soldier’s roar echoed and caused the listeners to tremble.

The leading soldiers raised their shield and spear. The shields acted as a bronze wall in front of them. The spears then inched forward from the opening, revealing the shimmering tips that could pierce through any foe.

“Activate the formation!” The vanguards roared and released their vitality.

Chaos true energy empowered the leading formation. The runes lit up and they became connected as one without a single gap for the enemy to take advantage of.

“Forward!” A deafening horn accompanied the order.

“Kill him!” The vanguards rushed forward, resulting in loud explosions. Both the ground and the buildings nearby quaked violently.

“Boom!” The first line turned into a triangular drill with an all-piercing tip. It surged forward with a frightening momentum, akin to an unstoppable mountain of steel. Even the largest mountain range stood no chance of slowing it down.

“Pretty decent, a formation from the Zhang is naturally good.” One expert standing far away praised.

The Zhang might be in charge of the civic officials but after seeing this regiment, everyone knew that they were capable in terms of military strategy as well - not necessarily inferior to the military Li Clan. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Rumble!” The drill made it to Li Qiye in no time at all.

The spectators held their breath. Li Qiye looked tiny compared to the massive drill. His tiny and feeble frame could be crushed in the blink of an eye.

In this crucial second, Li Qiye raised his right hand and started chanting: “Venerable waves and jade spirits...” [1]

His arm became resplendent with dao runes emerging. The characters that he spoke manifested and attached themselves to his arm. One could hear sizzles as if someone was branding his arm with a branding iron.

The right arm of the statue also lit up. “Clank! Clank! Clank!” Pieces from this section automatically peeled off and flew towards his direction before latching onto his right arm.

Strangely enough, the pieces were extremely large but they were reduced to the perfect size before the attachment.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye. Only the strong masters saw the whole process clearly.

Meanwhile, Untethered Monk in the distance opened his eyes as wide as possible. He memorized all of Li Qiye’s actions and words.

The pieces covered his arm and became a single piece as if it was cast in this manner in the first place.

“Poof!” It immediately shot out a blue flame with impressive offensive potential.

“Break!” Li Qiye directly punched the incoming drill afterward.

“Boom!” The world seemed to be shattering from the explosion. Time came to a halt.

“Crack!” The spectators saw his bronze hand crushing the drill tip. The formation crumbled afterward then the spears and shields.

“Ahh!” The first wave of soldiers got sent up into the air before exploding. Bones and pieces fell down on the pavement, issuing loud noises. A rain of blood started as well.

The vanguards were helpless before Li Qiye’s punch. Numerous soldiers bellowed in agony before being pulverized in the air.
