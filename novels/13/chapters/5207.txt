Chapter 5208: Endless Riches

“Sir, have you ever been betrayed?” After a long while, the man asked Li Qiye.

“Kill or let it be. These are mere actions one can take, unrelated to the dao heart.” Li Qiye said.

“I am still affected, cannot bear to kill.” The man said.

“Then ignore it. To have loved is enough. Although I did present kill as a choice, perhaps it is not the right choice.” Li Qiye said.

“I once thought that love was unbreakable.” The man sighed.

“Unbreakable? When the dao heart can be broken, everything else can break as well.” Li Qiye said.

The man froze for a second before bowing: “You’re right. My own dao heart is not unbreakable, I can’t expect anything else to be unbreakable.”

“It is inherently difficult. To reach this level means being indestructible, not even death can break it because then, death is only death, nothing more.” Li Qiye responded.

“I understand.” The man said.

“This is the price to pay for being the heaven’s favorite. You must endure tribulations to justify the initial favor.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Right, but who can refuse the blessing?” The man said.

“If your wish does not align with the heaven’s, then tribulations and hardship will take you down.” Li Qiye continued.

“Yes, having too much and losing them all, unbearable because of overwhelming desires.” The man nodded.

“We can keep it simple, you only need one pursuit for the dao.” Li Qiye smiled.

“And what is yours?” The man asked.

“An answer.” Li Qiye glanced at the sky.

“You’re willing to abandon everything else for this answer?” The man asked again.

“Anything relating to the answer is my own doing, the rest has nothing to do with me.” Li Qiye said.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I understand.” The man bowed again.

“Good.” Li Qiye stood up and started walking away while still speaking: “There is a price for wealth and power, your price has been insignificant compared to what you have been given.” With that, he disappeared into the crowd.

The man’s eyes gradually became lucid again and colors returned to the world.

“I have walked and enjoyed the mortal world more than enough.” He glanced at the sky with a focused expression while murmuring.

“Endless Riches or not, I am still Blazing.” With that, he vanished into the crowd.

As Li Qiye walked toward Imperial Gate, bright lights appeared outside again from the various powers including Alchemy Dao, Qilin Manor, and Iron Tree.

The lights gathered together to form the character of “Imperial”. It imprinted itself into one of the thrones. Its power and divinity couldn’t compare to the marks of the other participants.

“Imperial Attendant, one spot.” Resplendent Monarch of Qilin Manor declared.

“Hmm?” Some big shots became confused because Suppression Conqueror had already taken up one spot. Was this a challenge to him?

“Looks like we got a show?” Both the city’s members and outsiders understood that something was going on.

“I’m taking one as well.” A faint voice sounded and suddenly, something swept the entire world up.

Cultivators became afraid since they lost control as well. Fortunately, this only lasted for a split second.

“Boom!” A mark resembling an ear could be seen on one of the remaining thrones.

“Immensity Conqueror!” Everyone recognized the mark.

“He’s back?” Another conqueror shuddered after seeing it.

The big shots from the four alliances didn’t underestimate him either. He was a legend just like Principle Conqueror, perhaps even one level higher.

He was talented enough that no one doubted his success. Sure enough, he became a conqueror at a young age.

For some strange reason, his cultivation stagnated for a hundred thousand years or so. Even his descendants started surpassing him.

At this mark, his cultivation suddenly soared again, allowing him to obtain eleven dao fruits in one go. This legend didn’t join any of the alliances but this didn’t affect his status in the upper continents.

“Leave me one spot.” An existence woke up from a deep slumber. His voice came from a distant valley.

“Oh? Still alive.” Li Qiye stopped and smiled after hearing this voice.

“Zzz.” A wisp of flame appeared on one throne and left its mark.

“Who is that?” This mark was unfamiliar to most spectators in the city.

“An ancient Immortal Emperor, Yao Zu.” One conqueror revealed and startled everyone.

“This old geezer is still alive?” A mighty existence up in the clouds found this surprising.

“Immortal Emperor Yao Zu.” Listeners repeated his title in astonishment.

This was another legendary figure - a predecessor of Heavenly Sage Yuan. Not only was his alchemy peerless, so was his cultivation.

Ancient emperors and even Celestial Court sought his aid. Alas, he was too arrogant to care for any of them.

Rumor has it that he was either killed during the calamity or died a normal death. Today, his appearance shocked everyone.

“He’s here for the nine-leaves.” A big shot in the sky understood.

These unbeatable big shots knew that his lifespan was coming to an end. He had consumed the finest-grade longevity pills so they were useless to him now.

“Living a borrowed life, how meaningless.” Li Qiye glanced in the direction of the valley and shook his head.
