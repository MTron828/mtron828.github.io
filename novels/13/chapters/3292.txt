She clearly saw Li Qiye touching Daowei before the punch.

The movement and transformation of the fist technique seemed fine. It broke through Wenyong’s palm strike’s mistake and struck the latter’s cheek.

In one sense, this could be construed as changing something simple into magic. This was definitely possible for powerful cultivators.

The real masters could use the simplest techniques and have incredible results - Qianyue knew this.

But Daowei shouldn’t have been able to inflict that much damage in spite of its accuracy. Wenyong was in the corpus realm. Daowei shouldn’t have had enough force to break through the violet energy barrier.

Thus, Qianyue knew that the crux of the issue was the punch’s power, not the punch itself.

It managed to break through Wenyong’s innate barrier - something impossible for Daowei.

Therefore, she stared at Li Qiye and thought that he must be stronger than a Violet Marquis Corpus.

Her eyes narrowed, wanting to figure him out. Unfortunately, all she saw was an Iron Skin cultivator.

She believed that she was right. Iron Skin was indeed his current cultivation realm, which made everything even more confusing.

How could an Iron Skin penetrate the Wenyong’s defensive lines? She simply had no explanation for what had transpired.

Meanwhile, many disciples and even the elders were suspecting her.

“Why does Senior Sister Qianyue favor this Li Qiye so much?” One guy murmured.

“Poor guy, he won’t be able to find all of his teeth.” Another said since Wenyong was being carried away.

“Good, you passed the trial.” Li Qiye laughed and tapped Daowei’s shoulder.

Daowei still couldn’t accept this and looked up at the elders.

“Yes, twenty points.” The elders had to accept this. It didn’t matter how it happened; these two really defeated Wenyong.

“Thank you, Young Master.” Daowei bowed towards Li Qiye and returned to his original team despite having twenty points now.

Qianyue glared at the crowd before moving up the steps due to their hushed accusations.

“Okay, take your time fighting, we’ll be waiting up there.” Li Qiye smiled and waved at his fellow disciples, looking like a favored sycophant. He then followed her up the steps.

The crowd could only watch the two of them leave.

Qianyue found a shady and cool spot to sit down, wrapping her hands around her knees with her hair draping down - looking as attractive as can be.

Li Qiye sat down next to her without any hesitation and leaned on her to sleep.

She became vexed. This was her first time meeting such a jerk, taking advantage of her in public with no regard for anyone.

She tried to push him away but he didn’t move at all.

“You want to die?” Her eyes were cold enough to kill.

“What are you talking about? You’re my maid. Your responsibility is to take good care of me.” Li Qiye responded.

“Since when am I your maid?” She wanted to stomp on his face.

“You forgot our bet already? You’ll be my maid when you lose but don’t worry, I won’t mistreat you.” Li Qiye replied.

“Wait until you win first.” She thought that he couldn’t be any more shameless.

“It’s all the same, there’s nothing you can do against me.” Li Qiye casually answered before shifting his body against her to find a comfortable position to sleep.

“You’re really this confident against me?” She had never experienced this before, being the top genius of Divine Black. How could an Iron Skin cultivator defeat her?

Unfortunately, he was already asleep. Only his even breathing could be heard.

She nearly vomited blood from anger. He was the first man who had slept while leaning on her. Moreover, he did it so blatantly too as if she were really his maid.

Plus, he was the first one to see her body...

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She got the urge to strangle him right now.

The disciples below also saw all of this, hoping that Qianyue would kick him down the stairs or just kill him outright.

However, the two of them sat below the shade, looking like two lovers.

This made the spectators grit their teeth in anger. How dare he took advantage of their goddess? He deserved more than death.

“Ah!” One male disciple was completely distracted by this and got sent flying by his opponent.

He didn’t only lose the battle but also twenty points. Worst of all, the lover in his dream was being courted by someone else.

Many shared the same animosity towards Li Qiye but they couldn’t do anything.

“Boom!” Huang Ning and his team defeated their opponents in no time and went up the steps.

He saw Li Qiye sleeping while leaning on Qianyue and became furious.

“Junior Sister, why are you tolerating this scoundrel?” Huang Ning waited for her permission to throw Li Qiye off.

By this point, many have won and moved up the steps. They became envious of Li Qiye’s luck and jealous of his taking advantage of Qianyue.

They would love to be in his situation. Losing one thousand years of lifespan in exchange was just fine. They would jump into a boiling cauldron to earn her love.

Thus, they nodded in agreement with Huang Ning while glaring at Li Qiye.

“He’s tired.” Qianyue said while looking at Li Qiye.

Huang Ning saw that her eyes seemed to be different while looking at Li Qiye. He wasn’t too clear and hoped that he was only overthinking it.

A guy like Li Qiye wasn’t worthy of Qianyue. She was only being kind. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“He didn’t even do anything, how can he be tired? There’s no chance of him getting through the second trial.” The annoyed Huang Ning said.

“Yes, Senior Sister is the only reason why he made it to the second trial.” The others chimed in.

He was the thorn in their side and the source of irritation. They wanted to criticize him in order to make Qianyue dislike him.

“He can’t even beat a child with his Tortoise Fist. He’ll fall down right after the next gong.” Another tried his best to put Li Qiye down.
