Chapter 4164: Entering Sword Burial Zone

Stepping through the gate teleported them away from the Dragon War Plains. A new world appeared before them.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Their swords and sabers immediately resonated with whatever was in there.

“There’s a supreme dao here.” One expert commented.

The loud hymns and clanks happened for a reason. This was especially true for the top masters. Their weapons were famous and wouldn’t react for no reason. It was either to warn their master of danger or that there was a dao resonation.

The latter was likely. Alas, no one knew where this supreme dao was.

An ancient yet stately aura greeted everyone. The swordsmen could sense the ever-present affinity of the blade in each inch of the land. They could reach forward anywhere and still touch this beloved dao.

“What an animated sword dao.” One swordsman said, thinking that using his sword techniques here would be akin to a fish returning to the water.

“A great place to train.” Another started waving his hand. Though cultivation didn’t increase upon entering, they felt their power increasing for some reason.

“Where do we go now?” One cultivator looked around and felt lost.

This independent realm was massive with mountains and hills as far as the eye can see. There was no lifeform here either. Red clouds engulfed the air as if the entire sky was on fire. This was rather bizarre.

“Boom!” Loud explosions interrupted their plan. They all looked back and saw a legion marching in the air, as grand as a true dragon and as fast as a lighting dragon.

They didn’t waste time and entered deeper into the burial ground, leaving behind a trail of dust and smoke.

“They’re from Sea Emperor.” Someone managed to see the banners despite the legion’s speed.

“Seems like they have a clear target in mind.” Another shouted after seeing their decisiveness.

“Not surprising at all, they have done their research throughout the generations. Rumor has it that they had mapped out the entire place.” One expert said.

“Most likely true. It is widely believed that they had obtained several heavenly swords and dao in this place. Sword Sea Dao Lord obtained his in one of the five domains here, the river. Violet Abyss Dao Lord probably got them here too. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Sword Burial made Sea Emperor what it is today, so they will definitely not miss this opportunity.” Another chimed in.

“Boom!” The moment he finished speaking, a pagoda came through the gate. It resembled a sun with heat halos rotating around it. It also flew straight into the inner region and left behind a long trail of after-images due to its speed.

“Nine-wheel Citadel, so fast.” People became startled. Most importantly, they thought that the pagoda wasn’t slower than the legion earlier. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“They’re going in the same direction as Sea Emperor.” One crowd member noted.

“Why are they in such a hurry? Do they know something?” An ancestor wondered.

“Maybe it’s the immortal sword in the legend.” Someone else blurted out.

“That might not exist, but it could be another heavenly dao and sword.” A high elder shook her head.

“Another?” A youth wondered.

“One of the nine paths of Finality, Myriad Era.” One ancestor said: “That’s the only heavenly sword and dao that have yet to show up.”

The other eight have appeared before in the world. Some might be lost currently but only one was missing entirely - Myriad Era. This made people feel quite strange.

“Does anyone know why?” A junior asked the crowd.

The prime minister of an old kingdom replied: “Not sure, I’ve heard theories of this dao being the leader of the nine paths and also the hardest one to cultivate.”

“I wonder if it already has a master who just doesn’t use it.” Another interjected.

“Impossible, the power of a heavenly dao and sword are beyond imagination. Its user will be unstoppable, there’s no way to keep it a secret.” A clan master disagreed.

“Yes, Sword Temple’s Everlasting is untouchable.” One ancestor from an old sect said: “Back then, the temple had numerous disciples who didn’t learn Terra and only focused on Everlasting. They dominated nonetheless.”

“No need to talk about the past. Right now, Everlasting Sword God is dominating and hasn’t learned Terra yet either. He’s still on the same level as Vastsea Paragon and Earthraiser Vajra. Imagine the real Myriad Era Sword Dao.” A royal lord became emotional.

It was common knowledge that Sword Queen created the Everlasting Sword Dao along with Everlasting in an attempt to imitate Myriad Era. Just the imitation alone was incredible, what about the real thing?

Because of this, cultivators later on thought that Myriad Era was the strongest out of the nine.

“Who cares, we gotta get going! Myriad Era Heavenly Sword or Myriad Era Dao might be there!” A big shot shouted before heading in the same direction.

“He’s right. We might not be able to get it but just seeing it is a fortune in and of itself.” Another expert didn’t waste time. Many others followed.

“Do we follow them?” A junior asked his master.

“No, we’re going to Sword River first. It is the closest and less dangerous.” His master said.

“Yes, if we can’t cross the river, we probably shouldn’t go to any other places.” A peer added.

“Not necessarily. Sword Burial has five domains going from outer to inner. However, the outlines and separation aren’t well-defined since they do intertwine in some parts, there are mapped out ways to safely get through. People usually choose them to get to the inner region.” The master said.

“I’m down with just heading to the river, that’s where Sword Sea Dao Lord got his fortune.” The third disciple became excited.

Normally, the majority of visitors would pick the river first since it was the outer domain and the starting point. It didn’t matter if one wanted to go to Sword Abyss or Sword Grave or any other roundabout route, the river should be the first destination.

People headed for different areas of the river, some arriving near the upstream and others closer to the downstream spot. They all heard loud explosions and clanks before arriving at the shore.

The river coiled around the inner regions and had towering mountains on both sides. Thus, naming it a “canyon” would have been more accurate.

However, the things flowing in this river weren’t water but rather, countless broken pieces of swords. This was something people had never seen anywhere else.
