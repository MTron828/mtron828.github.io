Chapter 4731: Imperial Sword

“Let’s get this going so I can end it fast, I have other matters to attend to.” Li Qiye urged.

The young emperor and Five-sun King were visibly agitated by the nonchalant comment but didn’t act on it. They had too much self-control; anyone else as prestigious as them might be trembling with rage.

Nonetheless, they knew that Li Qiye was stronger. Letting their emotion get the best of them would only display their inadequacy.

Listeners smile wryly after hearing this. Li Qiye has never changed his tone regardless of who he was speaking to.

“Have it your way!” Five-sun King shouted.

“Come.” Li Qiye gestured provocatively with his hand.

The two geniuses exchanged glances and prepared themselves.

“Boom!” Five-sun King channeled his vitality and released it, showing the crowd his prestigious and ancient bloodline.

Of course, his bloodline couldn’t compare to Shen Juntian. It also lacked the same regalness as the young emperor of True Immortal.

Nonetheless, the aura came from an ancient era. As he breathed in and out, he resembled the lord of the myriad dao.

“Screech!” A sharp affinity tore apart the region and scratched everyone.

The vitality manifested into the form of a heavenly eagle. Its spread wings blotted out the sky. This was a king of beasts, a being above the rest of its ilk.

“The eagle bloodline!” Someone shouted.

“Buzz.” Next came the reveal of his fate palaces and true fate. The latter was different from everyone else’s.

Halos circled around it and resembled independent realms. They contained mysterious abilities capable of seeing the secrets of the heavenly dao and reaching the end of the path.

Its mysteriousness made others shudder and feel fear. This had nothing to do with cultivation. His true fate alone insisted that he was superior. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“A mystic true fate.” An expert commented.

“Two incredible innate gifts in one.” A genius whispered.

Though his eagle bloodline was thin and not direct like Shen Juntian’s dao lord bloodline, he was able to improve its rank through cultivation. Unfortunately, there were still limits to this height.

As for the true fate, it couldn’t quite compare to the peerless primal fate palaces of the young emperor.

However, he possessed both of them. Therefore, this placed him in a top spot in the young generation, not counting the other conquerors.

“Clank!” The young emperor summoned a sword, no longer using the Sagacity that helped him become famous.

It was golden from top to bottom, looking thick and heavy.

“Emperor is the sword’s name.” He pointed it at Li Qiye and surrounded his opponent with a mighty sword intent: “It is my true fate weapon.”

The sword boosted his aura to the apex, making him the lord of both men and beasts.

He created the sword through his true fate. If he were to become dao lord, it would become his patrimony weapon or even a paragon weapon.

It lacked the regal aura seen in Sagacity but on the contrary, it felt more suitable for the young emperor.

Sagacity, ultimately, was not his own. His ability and talent weren’t enough to exert its true power. This didn’t apply to Emperor. He was capable of using the sword to its very limit. This was the reason why cultivators crafted weapons through the true fate method.

“Is it stronger than Sagacity?” Someone questioned.

“Buzz.” Five-sun King stuck with using his Bowl of the World. It still pulsed radiantly and appeared to be unstoppable.

Spectators watched with bated breath, awaiting the start of this battle where two conquerors would go all out.

“This will be a magnificent spectacle.” An expert whispered.

“It always is, every dao lord competition.” An ancestor smiled.

“Who will win though?” A genius wondered after seeing the new team.

Shen Juntian had lost but maybe these two would put up a good fight.

“Fool.” An ancestor shook his head: “They have no chance of winning. If they do their best, maybe they’ll be able to see more of his strength.”

“Well, I’m guessing they’ll last three to five hundred moves.” Another ancestor speculated.

People didn’t have a problem with it. This team should be strong enough to last a while.
