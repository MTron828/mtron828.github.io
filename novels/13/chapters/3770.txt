Chapter 3771: Landslide Defeat

The massive bow looked like a crescent moon from the string being pulled back all the way. Its power was palpable as if everything in this region was being gathered here.

Hu Ben was well prepared in delivering a finishing blow.

“The final ace card of Smoke-fire Platform, the vein is the bow while the earth flames serve as the arrow.” One ancestor emotionally remarked.

The big shots from the last generation were in awe, aware of the power contained in this arrow. Being struck would have terrible ramifications.

This wasn’t an actual weapon, just part of the fortress’ foundation in combination with the lava dragon.

“Raa!” The dragon’s claw slashed the white tiger’s forehead.

“Boom!” The word, King, on the tiger’s forehead, was crushed. Thus, the barrier crumbled right away and the tiger was torn apart.

The dragon then came for the scion, wanting to tear him to pieces without mercy.

“This is the best opportunity!” One ancestor shouted.

As the dragon was on its way, Hu Ben also released the string and fired the fire arrow.

This arrow melted space and time along its path, akin to snowflakes touching a molten blade. Its target was the scion’s throat.

“Whoosh!” It was inches away from his throat before people heard the wind-breaking noise. They felt sharp pains all over from the gales.

The two fatal moves from the dragon and the arrow made contact with the scion at the exact same time. This resulted in total spatial devastation. The spot where he stood melted and became something akin to a quagmire.

“Hell yes!” Some started cheering after seeing this. Hope resurfaced once more on the side of the holy ground.

This should be enough to seriously injure the scion, winning some face back for their side.

“What a magnificent and splendid attack.” One youth heaved a sigh of relief.

“Hu Ben is worthy of being one of the four, his ability is commendable.” A genius clapped excitedly.

The top ancestors nodded approvingly as well: “Yes, Hu Ben’s plan was masterful.”

This celebratory mood permeated the crowd. Unfortunately, they stopped laughing a while later.

After the spatial quagmire dispersed, the scion appeared before them again. There were no serious injuries contrary to their expectation. In fact, there was no sign of blood. Only his clothes and hair were slightly disorderly.

They saw him holding a spear made out of bones to block the dragon’s claw. As for his other hand, he was gripping the supposedly fatal arrow earlier.

This arrow contained incredible power yet his two fingers stopped it from piercing his throat. The distance of one inch made all the difference.

Astonishment and speechlessness struck the crowd. Hu Ben’s ultimate attacks didn’t harm the scion at all.

Hu Ben turned pale as a result. His opponent’s strength was insane.

“This was an impressive attack. Unfortunately, it’s not enough to kill me.” The scion smiled and activated his power, becoming dazzling along with his skeletal spear.

“Whoosh!” The spear pierced through the lava dragon and slew it. Next, he added force to his two fingers and broke the fire arrow.

The arrow, bow, and dragon were one - the foundation of the fortress. Since two have been destroyed, the bow exploded as well.

Hu Ben was sent flying as a result, smashing through several peaks while vomiting blood. His armor and bones shattered.

He ignored his wounds and leaped backward. This swift maneuver made him spit out blood again but he didn’t dare, instantly disappearing into the horizon.

Everyone watched Hu Ben run away like a dog without a master in silence. The youths opened their mouth but no words came out.

They weren’t in a position to criticize him since he had actually done quite well. They might not have done any better. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Hu Ben had tried his best and still lost. His opponent was just at another level.

“Old geezers like us might not have been able to pull off a more powerful attack.” One big shot commented.

Thus, fleeing after doing everything he could wasn’t disgraceful.

“Not satisfying at all.” The scion chuckled while floating in the air.

The geniuses of the holy ground lowered their head, not daring to challenge him. It would be futile anyway since their defeat could be far worse than Hu Ben’s.

“Rumble!” He called for his chariot and went on the move again.

While he looked around, no one dared to meet his gaze. Finally, his eyes focused on the direction of Minor Sacred Mountain: “I hope this trip won’t end as a disappointment.”

With that, he crossed through Smoke-fire Fortress and entered the holy ground.

The crowd continued to stare at his departing figure in a daze.

“Who can stop him?” One genius became pessimistic.
