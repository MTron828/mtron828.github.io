Chapter 4694: Heavenly Six-treasure Annihilation

As tall as the heaven while crushing the earth, his arms looked like six mountain ranges looming above. He activated all of his power, resulting in a dreadful spectacle.

He still controlled his energy but the aura alone instilled fear into the crowd. Waves and gales emanated from him, a natural phenomenon from someone so strong.

People looked up and his eyes looked like six suns. They felt as if they could spew out flames and incinerate the world. Some immediately got on their knees, unable to handle the pressure. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just his gaze alone could be so destructive. This was beyond the ability of many cultivators present.

“Boom!” All six treasures released boundless light. Each ray was accompanied by engulfing flames.

“His six treasures are the finest from Desolate Sacred Ground, left behind from an ancient era. Rumor has it that the six of them together are about as strong as imperial and dao lord weapons.” A big shot from the east commented.

Everyone could tell that Wild Paragon was about to unleash an ultimate move.

“Boom!” He revealed his twelve resplendent palaces. The most-refined chaos true energy gushed out of them. Each drop contained the essence of his grand dao.

Others had a hard time keeping their eyes open.

“Die!” He finally made his move.

The gigantic divine sword split the world into two halves as if it was cutting a chicken egg. Others bellowed in horror, feeling their own body being separated.

The pagoda released a vortex of chaos true energy that could draw everyone in and refine them. Even the myriad dao could fall victim to its pull.

As for the banner, it covered a million miles of land. It released strands of dao energy with a refining property as well, turning the land beneath into hell. Anyone below would be reduced into blood.

“Run!” Those affected by its coverage immediately turned and fled.

Next came the jewel. It became the heaviest item in existence and crushed the fabrics of reality. The world and its inhabitants couldn’t withstand the jewel’s weight.

“Heavenly Six-treasure Annihilated!” Wild Paragon channeled all of his merit laws and energy into this dreadful move.

By this point, weaker cultivators were no longer interested in watching the fight. They only thought about running away in order to be safe. Unfortunately, some of them were too weak and dropped to the ground, paralyzed.

“This is it.” One expert said: “Can Li Qiye stop this devastating strike or would he fall?”

“Impossible. Li Qiye is on the same level as the five conquerors. He can’t die to a single move.” A big shot with a strong understanding of Li Qiye said.

Others nodded in agreement right away.

As the attack descended, it heralded apocalyptic signs. Verdant hills and rivers disintegrated into nothingness.

Li Qiye smiled and made a fist. “Buzz.” It pulsed with a golden light.

“Golden Fist Dao!” Others recognized his technique right away.

Some had seen it back in Golden Gate when he controlled its foundation and borrowed the power of Worldbreaker.

However, he didn’t summon any external help this time. His punch alone created an eternal golden radiance.

As he punched the air, the golden light left behind an everlasting mark. Spectators became amazed at its splendor and thought that a heavenly kingdom could come from it.

They didn’t have much time to think because its power manifested and sent them flying. Some vomited blood while others couldn’t handle the pressure and were reduced to blood.

“Fuck!” Many screamed in horror and kept on running.

“Boom!” The punch faced the combined might of the six treasures.

Despite their impressive power, the punch reduced everything back to the origin. The grand dao and true chaos energy of the treasures were immediately defeated.

It moved onward and struck one of the paragon’s heads. Though it was larger than the sun, he still screamed in agony.

In the next second, it exploded from the pressure. Blood and bits of flesh splashed everywhere.

“Ahh!” His scream made everyone shudder.

“Bam!” He fell backward and smashed numerous mountains, shrinking back to his normal size.

He was still alive since he had two heads left. Nonetheless, his courage was completely destroyed just like the head so he turned to run.
