“Yes.” Bingning replied to the inquisitive matron.

“Taking a stroll can be good, but if you are finished, it is time to come back. Everyone is worried about you.” The matron didn’t care about the validity of the excuse.

“I have no intention of returning right now.” Bingning maintained her ground.

“The martial court needs you.” The matron continued: “As the successor, you have tasks to do and disciples to lead.”

“Master and the elders can handle everything, my absence is inessential to the prosperity of the martial court.” She shook her head.

The matron’s eyes became serious after hearing this. Everyone was watching and could sense the change in mood.

“I’m not asking, this is an order from the sect, you must return to the court right now.” Her eyes turned cold as she emitted her aura.

“I’m sorry, Ancestor, I won’t be returning right now.” Bingning remained steadfast.

“Such impudence!” The matron’s divinity was frightening: “Disobeying a direct order is a great crime, not even a successor is above the law!”

“I’m aware of the gravity of this crime.” Bingning responded seriously.

“You should know that a light punishment consists of expulsion, a heavy one is crippling their cultivation! It’s not too late to go back with me now!” The matron uttered coldly.

The crowd was shaken. Disobedience was indeed a serious issue. Once expelled, the person would have nowhere to go in Myriad Lineage. As for the worst case scenario, they would become a mortal again.

The goddess was the successor with limitless potential and prestigious status. She was also considered by some to be more talented than the three young nobles. It’s just that she had a late debut versus them.

She was a promising imperial candidate, and anyone else in her shoes would be appreciative of their circumstances. Being kicked out of Vermillion was akin to falling down from the clouds to an abyss, no chance to climb back out.

Bingning took a deep breath and said: “Thank you for your reminder, Ancestor, and for everything the court has done for me, but I still won’t be coming back.”

She couldn’t make her stance any clearer. The crowd gasped in response. This was a betrayal of sorts. How could she dare to do such an unfilial and rebellious act?

“Traitor! Do you think your wings are tough now?” The matron became furious: “The court has expended countless effort to groom you, yet you dare to be so stubborn? The court won’t stand for this!”

“As I have said, I’m appreciative of what the court has done for me. As a disciple of Vermillion, I will repay the court with my life when it needs me. But that is limited to upholding my responsibility to protect the court. However, each disciple of the system is family, not an item to be traded! That’s all I have to say.”

“Fool. The ancestors only want what’s best for you so they chose the easiest path. You can’t understand their wise intent.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I will pick my own path.” She said firmly.

“Have you no shame?! I will not allow you to do as you please today and will take you back for re-education!” The matron declared.

“Return from whence you came.” A leisure voice suddenly jumped in: “Don’t needlessly cause trouble and humiliate yourself.”

Everyone looked over at the speaker - Li Qiye.

The matron’s sharp eyes fell on him as well; they flashed with murderous intent.

“You’re that Li Qiye!” She uttered.

“That’s me.” He seemed nonchalant and dismissive of the matron.

“You’re the one egging our disciple to...” She scowled.

“Incorrect. Everyone makes their own choice. I simply appreciate her talents.” He interrupted again.

“Junior, no need to be arrogant for this is not Insane Court, but so what even if it was? It’s only a fallen dao system, can’t reach the apex. Be smart and scram or it won’t end well for you!”

The harshness of her words had a strong effect on the crowd. Her master was Dracoform Martial God, the number one expert of Myriad. Thus, her words carried immense weight. All systems and ancestors would feel trepidation right now.

“This is a big deal.” One ancestor murmured.

Though the Mu Clan was frightening indeed, they were still not in Myriad Lineage. This was a threat looming in the mind, different from the threat posed by Stormchaser Matron and Dracoform Martial God. This threat was right here in Myriad Lineage. Dracoform himself could flatten any sect or even an entire system in just a short time. In fact, people would bet on Dracoform over most True Emperors.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye ignored the threat.

“Junior, you aren’t qualified to pair with our successor!” The matron continued: “Insane Court is in ruination, so stop dreaming about marrying the successor of Vermillion Martial Court like a frog wanting to eat the swan! Scram now or you won’t be able to keep your life, and your court will turn to ashes!”

The crowd took a deep breath. If Dracoform were to join, all of this could happen. After all, he was an invincible Eternal.

“You think too highly of yourself and your system. Just one system alone is no different from a dog to me, can’t reach the apex.” Li Qiye retorted.

The blatant provocation to both Vermillion and Dracoform stunned the crowd. These words would never come out from anyone else in Myriad Lineage.

Some ancestors who have met him before smiled wryly for they have experienced “Fiercest” before. This madman didn’t care about anyone, whether it be the strongest in Myriad or the Mu Clan from Imperial. No one knew why he was so confident.

The matron was ready to kill. She said with a threatening inflection: “I will let you know now that only Young Lord Mu is worthy of our successor. We will never spare anyone who tries to break this marriage!”

This was the first time the martial court had confirmed this marriage alliance despite the previous rumors. It seemed to certain now since it came from the matron.

Moreover, this wasn’t only for Li Qiye to hear, but also for the rest of the crowd - telling all of her fans to drop this idea.

Thus, the youths who liked her were shocked and unwilling to see this development. Everyone also understood why she chose to disobey the sect. So it turned out that she didn’t want this particular marriage.

Alas, a single disciple like her couldn’t refuse. It seemed like Dracoform himself had decided so no one could change it.
