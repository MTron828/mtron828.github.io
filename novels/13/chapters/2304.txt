Leaving Bewildering Palace left Li Qiye in the desolate region of Moneyfall.

“Young Noble, where are we going now?” Ling Ximo asked timidly.

“If time permits, we’ll go somewhere that might let you find your sword tomb. But whether you can get it or not is up to you. You must be able to connect with it or it will only be a flower in the dew or the moon in the water.”

Ximo hesitated for a moment before taking out an old box. She handed it to Li Qiye and said: “This is something our forefather left behind. He said it is the key to taking back the tomb, can you use it, Young Noble?”

Li Qiye opened it and was met with a massive sword energy. He took a good look and said: “This is indeed the meaning of the sword, but it won’t be that simple. You will need perseverance in order to succeed.”

“I will try my best.” She stared straight at him and said firmly.

Despite knowing the difficulties lying ahead, she was ready to pay any price and her eyes showed her determination.

“Good.” He nodded: “Then mentally prepare, pain will be unavoidable.”

Ximo left the box with him. It was more important than her life and pertained to their clan’s survival so she shouldn’t be handing it to anyone. Moreover, she didn’t know Li Qiye for that long but for some reason, she trusted him more than anyone right now. She felt no anxiety leaving it to him, not worrying that he would take it for his own. It was safer in his possession anyway.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything and put the box away.

“Swords for sale here, 5% off if you buy one, 20% off for two, 40% off for ten, or one hundred for a very good price...” They didn’t get far before hearing a familiar voice.

On a beach shore, someone was carrying a large bag and peddling his bamboo swords. Who else would do something like this but Conqueror Young Noble?

“My Fairy, my bamboo sword will make you even more transcending and graceful...” He latched on to a group of young female cultivators and went to work with his bright and sincere smile.

“You are the young noble from Conqueror?” The girls smiled back at him.

The guy was quite famous for many reasons - his status, talents, and looks. Moreover, his amiability made many girls want to befriend him.

“I am, pretty ladies such as yourselves should visit our humble sect. It’s a tiny location so our citizens will certainly be amazed by your beauty. It is a blessing of three lifetimes.” His words were flowery indeed but didn’t sound off-putting.

Other passersby shook their head and smiled. They have grown used to his strange behavior.

“Let’s buy one each then.” His smile won the girls over.

The truth was that these bamboo swords weren’t worth the listed price. They only bought them in order to make a friend.

“Stay safe, pretty ladies. Come to Conqueror when you can.” The young noble remained enthusiastic after the successful sale.

“Ah, Big Bro, we meet again. How about buying some of my swords?” Conqueror went over to the duo as they were about to cross the lake.

Ximo wanted to laugh but didn’t dare to. She didn’t understand why someone of his status would act as a merchant.

“No.” Li Qiye refused again.

“Big Bro, friendship starts upon the first meeting; brotherhood blossoms on the second. This is our second, so we are brothers.” Conqueror put on sword into Li Qiye’s hand and sincerely said: “Well, consider this a meeting present.”

Li Qiye chuckled, finding the youth amusing. He then took a look at the sword.

It was made entirely of bamboo. Nevertheless, Conqueror meticulously carved and paid attention to the little details.

“I personally made each one; they have their own aura and are unique.” Conqueror said.

“Not bad.” Li Qiye traced the sword’s edge with his finger and nodded approvingly.

Conqueror’s face was beaming after earning the praise. His smile became wider and brighter: “One sword to own the world; two swords to be unique in history; three swords for an unstoppable formation...”

Despite the grandiose and funny rhetoric, Ximo still wasn’t buying it. She didn’t see what was so special about these swords.

“Big Bro, do you want to buy one? Buy one, get two free, how about it?” Conqueror offered: “They are made from our ancestral bamboo, the very foundation of our sect, a great treasure and the symbol of Coiling Dragon System. It once connected to the very veins of the system...”

He continued bragging. If it wasn’t for him bringing Coiling Dragon up, people would have forgotten that he was part of this system, and his sect, Conqueror, was only an old city there.

“Hmph, such a big tone.” A snort came about: “How can Conqueror represent Coiling Dragon?!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This interjection drew the attention of the crowd.

An old man with a group of experts got off their boat. He didn’t give any face to Conqueror Young Noble at all.

He wore an imperial robe; a saber was his weapon of choice. His chilling aura belonged to the True God level. His unforgiven eyes deterred others from staring straight at him.

“The king of Five Saints. So many experts from that kingdom are here.” Many recognized him and talked among themselves.

“Miao Lei of Five Saints, looks like we’ll have quite a show to watch.” An elder was ready to have fun.

“Isn’t Five Saints a kingdom of Coiling Dragon System, Conqueror Young Noble is from there too. Why the animosity?” A youth asked his senior.

“It pertains to the origin of Coiling Dragon.” The senior smiled.

“What, Royal Lord Miao, our Conqueror can’t speak for Coiling Dragon? Only your kingdom can?” Conqueror retorted, still smiling.

“Coiling Dragon is under the rule of Eight-armed Dynasty. They are the only one who can represent our system.” Miao Lei uttered coldly.

“Talking about the Praymoon Sect? They are only parasites of the system. The only reason I’m not demanding sovereignty is that I don’t want to bring war to the people.”

“You...” Miao Lei’s expression shifted.

Some understood what was going on while the young ones were confused.

“What’s happening?” One youth asked about this conflict between members of Coiling Dragon.

“Just a debate about the orthodox branch.” His senior said: “The current sect in charge, Eight-armed Dynasty, is not the descendants of Coiling Dragon Progenitor.”

“What about Conqueror Young Noble?” The junior inquired again.

“Who knows?” The senior shook his head: “Rumor has it that Conqueror was the founding location of Coiling Dragon, but it’s still just a rumor.”
