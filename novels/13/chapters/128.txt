Chapter 129 : Evil Slaying Battlefield (1)

This would normally be a funny scene, and it was indeed very funny, but at this moment, no one dared to laugh.

This brat, Nan Huairen, was a wily and greedy fella, but he believed in gods. When it came to gods, his heart became very frightened and he started shivering. At this time, he was sincerely apologizing to the giant tree.

The moment Nan Huairen finished kowtowing, an item suddenly fluttered down from the sky and landed right in front of Nan Huairen. The item had a golden glow. It sucked in and emitted strands of golden silky lights, like a lotus. This lotus was made from gold. Even though it seemed ethereal, the inside contained many lotus seeds that were flashing sparkly brilliances.

“Good brat, you were truly sincere.”

Li Qiye couldn’t help but nod his head and praise:

“The Cassia Lotus Tree has forgiven you and bestowed a Six Lotus Seed — this is a truly great item. In the future, it could even be refined into a Godly Treasure! Hurry up and thank the Cassia Lotus Tree. You need to know that this thing is extremely rare.”

Hearing Li Qiye’s words, many people were shocked. To be able to become a Godly Treasure, at this time, even someone who was not knowledgable would still recognize that the golden lotus seeds were not ordinary.

The surprised Nan Huairen quickly kowtowed to the giant tree again, then he happily picked up the Six Lotus Seed with the utmost of care.

At this moment, many disciples were staring with admiration at Nan Huairen. They couldn’t believe that he actually got such a sacred item. As his master, Protector Mo was ecstatic as well. He didn’t think that Nan Huairen’s sincerity would grant him such an item. This was truly fated by the heavens.

At this moment, a disciple couldn’t help but copy Nan Huairen. He hoped that the godly tree would also grant him a sacred treasure.

“Don’t waste your energy.”

Li Qiye shook his head and said:

“Innocent and free of hidden intentions — that would be true sincerity. Seeing a bit of results and copying with a tainted heart... This is simply not sincere.. The fortune of Brat Nan Huairen is not shallow; one cannot force themselves to have such good fate and fortune.”

Hearing this, the other disciples couldn’t help but laugh in a forceful and embarrassed manner. Even though they wouldn’t be able to obtain a sacred treasure, everyone, including the protectors and sectional leaders, all respectfully accepted the giant tree ahead of them as a Godly Tree.

Li Qiye didn’t care about these things. He simply told Gu Tieshou:

“Elder Gu, I will head east once again. You will stay here with the disciples and never leave this place. Otherwise, it could bring about a disaster.”

“I will take care of it.”

Gu Tieshou didn’t dare to take the matter lightly, so he replied with a serious tone.

Li Qiye took Li Shuangyan, along with Niu Fen, to leave the holy ground. On the way, Li Qiye divided the holy water and lotus ashes to Li Shuangyan and Niu Fen, then he said:

“If we are met with the roots of the Evil Typha, you must slash it. However, you must immediately get away from the Evil Typha flowers. If you are trapped and cannot make an escape path, use the lotus ashes to repel the evil. If the Evil Typha flowers get on the body or the evil root pierces the flesh, then use the holy water to cleanse it; otherwise, it will suck your blood.”

Li Shuangyan and Niu Fen carefully put the holy water and lotus ashes away. They memorized the words of Li Qiye with considerable weight; they didn’t dare to be careless.

“What are we going to do this time?”

After putting away the lotus ashes and holy water, Li Shuangyan asked.

“It depends on the situation.”

Li Qiye looked towards the eastern direction in the far distance, and he said:

“I don’t know what the current situation is like. In short, before the situation deteriorates, we will take care of these devilish things. Otherwise, once they grow again, it would really be a disaster.”

“Bang... Bang... Bang...”

However, when Li Qiye’s words had just ended, the entire eastern region shook, and then the muddy earth pierced the sky. In the far east, inside the no man’s area, suddenly, there were gigantic bony outgrowths that extended from the ground. Each of them was ten thousand zhang long. The more frightening part was that each of them was as black as lacquer, and they were surrounded by black energy.

In just a second, the entire eastern region, that was azure with its clear water, was suddenly covered by strands of black energies. They emerged and hunted across the entire no man’s area without much effort, turning it into a hell zone.

Anyone seeing such a scene would have to cringe with an ominous feeling in their hearts.

“Rawr...”

At this point, a loud roar came about. The Heaven Extermination Devil Ape rushed out from its nest and its terrible presence permeated throughout the no man’s area.

“The Heaven Extermination Devil Ape...”

Seeing this one million year old Heavenly Beast, everyone was shivering in fear. Even a character like Heavenly Prince Qingxuan couldn’t help but greatly sour his expression.

However, when the great ape had just erupted outside, inside a ravine in a far off distance, another long roar emancipated, and a Longevity Spirit also flew up.

“Oh mother, a one million year old Longevity Spirit...”

Everyone trembled in fear. A one million year old Longevity Spirit and Heavenly Beast — their auras were like a large tsunami that swept away all of the eastern region! The cultivators’ faces were as white as sheets, and the weaker ones fell to the floor in fear.

“It’s over, it’s over...”

At this moment, a cultivator lost his wits. He was scared to the point where his soul flew about.

It was too late to escape. It could even be said that in the face of a one million year old Heavenly Beast and Longevity Spirit, even an Enlightened Being wouldn’t be able to escape.

However, the Heaven Extermination Devil Ape and the Longevity Spirit in the sky essentially ignored the invading cultivators. They let out a long scream and, with a bit of hesitation, they eventually abandoned their nests and ran away from the eastern region. The Longevity Spirit rushed north while the great ape went west, and they disappeared in the vast desolace.

Now, Li Qiye narrowed his eyes. He observed the giant pillaring bony extrusions without saying anything for a long time.

Even Niu Fen became surprised. He felt a sinister omen and muttered:

“What is that thing?”

“It used to be skeletal remains.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Li Qiye revealed a smile and said:

“It had died for millions of years, yet it still wants to borrow the bones to revive.”

“What kind of evil existence is that? A five million year old Heavenly Beast? Or a five million year old Longevity Spirit?”

Niu Fen became emotional. Each bony pillar was ten thousand zhang high. One could only imagine how monstrous this evil existence was.

Li Qiye calmly smiled:

“It’s not a Heavenly Beast nor Longevity Spirit, but something much more terrifying. The other two could be killed, but this mysterious thing is difficult to slay. It is incredibly hardy beyond imagination. As long as some of its roots are still there, it will remain alive and plan for its resurrection.”

Niu Fen and Li Shuangyan couldn’t help but become alarmed. There is such a thing in this world! Truly daunting...

“Let us go. We will go see.”

At this point, Li Qiye smiled and said:

“Maybe we could dig out its last hope, and maybe we’ll even get some good things out of it.”

As Li Qiye was riding the snail to the eastern region, many cultivators were glancing at each other while seeing this apocalyptic foreboding.

“This... Is this really the treasure of the gods coming into being? I feel like it is more of an evil devil coming into being...”

A sect master saw the bony outgrowths with his pale-white face.

“This place is ominous.”

Old Man Guan, standing next to Heavenly Prince Qingxuan, stirringly said.

Heavenly Prince Qingxuan’s eyes became powerful, as if he could see into the deepest parts of the no man’s area. Finally, he slowly spoke:

“It may be ominous, but so what? The extremely ferocious area of the heaven and earth will surely give birth to a godly item! This is the thing that we need. What ominous and dreadful existence in the world would dare to be arrogant under the godly presence of our ancestor?”

Hearing this, Old Man Guan felt some truths. Their Ancient Kingdom was a lineage of two Immortal Emperors; it was enough for them to disdain all of the Eight Desolaces. They were here with preparations. Even against a bigger danger, they could still escape unscathed.

Heavenly Prince Qingxuan did not hesitate and brought everyone to continue heading towards the deepest part of the no man’s area. At the moment, the Heaven Extermination Devil Ape had escaped, so they didn’t need to be slow. They directly pushed deeper inside the area with a much greater speed.

Since Heavenly Prince Qingxuan had rushed in, Dao Child Shengtian didn’t want to lose. Thus, he also gravely said:

“We will also enter.”

The national teacher, Enlightened Being Si Tu, said in a worried manner:

“Young Noble, I’m afraid this is very dangerous.”

“I know this.”

Dao Child Shengtian continued:

“We have entered the treasure land so we cannot go home with empty hands. Furthermore, if there really is a treasure of the gods, there has to be hidden dangers. Where in this world will there be a godly treasure that is easily obtained! If there is a Godly Monarch weapon, I will need such a thing to help me accomplish my supreme ambitions!”

Finished speaking, his eyes revealed a scary, yet determined, glare.

“Young Noble is powerful and wise.”

Enlightened Being Si Tu agreed. In order to accomplish a great deed and step on the road to become an Immortal Emperor, one needed such ambition, and such firm dao willpower.

Heavenly Prince Qingxuan and Dao Child Shengtian, one by one, went into the depths of the no man’s area, leaving many sects and countries that were hesitant, behind. Even these juniors, Heavenly Prince Qingxuan and Dao Child Shengtian, had went in... The spectators couldn’t help but become tempted. The sects and countries here had more than an ordinary amount of power, and they even had Royal Nobles from the last generation leading them as well!

“We will also go in! With the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom and Heavenly God Sect opening the way, what are we scared of.”

A sect master gravely said:

“Even if we can’t seize the Godly Monarch weapon, if we were to be able to get one or two Godly treasures, it would still be worth the trip.”

Finally, many great sects all came to this conclusion after the two young men entered into the depths of the no man’s area.

There were some small sects and cultivators who gave up on the idea. The sudden protrusions of the bony outgrowths surrounded by black energy were too creepy, causing others to feel uncomfortable. Thus, a few of the heritages decided to give up.
