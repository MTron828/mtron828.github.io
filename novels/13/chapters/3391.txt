Majestic Desert Splendor

Only ashes remained of the great army to the astonishment of the spectators. Even the most battle-hardened cultivator got cold sweat all over.

The army didn’t have a single weak combatant since it consisted of the elites from Three Truths. It could definitely contend against anyone in the northern West King. Unfortunately, not a single soul survived. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Ugh...” Some members of Divine Black and the crowd vomited, unable to handle the stench of blood in the air. Thinking about how many people have just been killed churned their stomach.

A few turned pale and couldn’t get up from being mentally drained. Their legs still trembled.

“No!” Three Truths Sect Master shouted during the aftermath: “No... this can’t be...”

It seemed as if his soul had left his body. Only despair remained.

His sect was built upon the effort of the wise sages and years of accumulations. The elites in the army have been groomed and given countless resources. All of this was gone now because he misread his enemy’s power on top of wanting personal gains. He had just buried his sect, becoming an eternal sinner.

“No...No...” Tears streamed out as he lamented. It was just too late.

“Divine Black completely reigns this region now.” The spectators calmed down next and one elder murmured.

This army served as the pillars of Three Truths. Its end meant a total collapse. It wouldn’t take long before this sect faces declination and inevitable destruction.

Moreover, Divine Black had plenty of room to grow now without a powerful enemy. This would be the development in the next several thousand years.

Lu Yiling was pale. He couldn’t save the army since he couldn’t break through Li Qiye’s sword technique. His abilities and power were useless. He gave it everything he had to no avail.

“Time to end this.” Li Qiye smiled and swung his sword again.

The slash lacked a peerless style, an overwhelming suppression, and a murderous will. However, it still cut down the myriad dao and everything else in the world despite being a single flash.

This flash seemed to have existed before the start of time. It pierced through the primordial chaos in an unstoppable manner.

Lu Yiling and everyone else became afraid. He could see death already during the flash.

“Run!” Three Truths Sect Master felt the ominous signs and shouted.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t up to Yiling. He couldn’t run after Li Qiye swung the sword. Escaping was impossible regardless of one’s speed and abilities.

The slash had severed time and space. One could be a billion miles away and it would still cut them down.

“Activate!” Yiling had no choice but to fight to the end. He poured all of his vitality and even true blood into his three patrimony swords.

“Clank!” They became red as if covered in blood. They then released a crimson flame incinerating the air, refining the myriad dao, and changing the yin and yang.

It utilized its strongest and most terrifying power. This flame contained the myriad dao within; they gathered together to form an untouchable supreme grand dao along with the image of a dao lord.

People quivered in response to this dao lord aura. So many became suppressed, paralyzed on the ground.

“A move from a dao lord!” This was indeed the strength of a dao lord - enough to sink all of Divine Black.

This was Lu Yiling’s ultimate strike. He traded his lifespan and vitality in order to muster enough power to use it. His hair turned white as snow right afterward as he rapidly aged. If he were lucky enough to survive, he would need to spend the rest of his short life as a cripple.

“Clank!” A clear sword hymn could be heard through the explosions in spite of its relative quietness. The flash of a sword cut through the supreme dao of this dao lord in an unstoppable manner.

Time came to a halt for a short moment. The aura and sword flash disappeared. Everyone saw Lu Yiling falling backward clearly due to the temporal stagnation.

They then noticed a tiny wound around his throat. After a while came the beads of blood streaming down.

This tiny wound was the most fatal blow since the slash earlier had cut off his true fate and life.

“Well-deserved...” He knew that this was his last moment as his life passed away. He died without regrets and with his eyes closed.

“Bam!” He fell and smashed into the ground. Blood eventually stained the area.

A great genius of the sword had just fallen today. His invincible sword dao couldn’t save him against Li Qiye’s slash as if it was pre-determined.
