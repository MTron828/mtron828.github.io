Chapter 4508: Trapped

The elder became the center of attention since everyone eagerly awaited his decision.

They believed that although the void jade was rare, it wasn’t worth the current bid. One could use the void coins to redeem for other things. For example, items from Void Zone.

Of course, they thought that the monarch could afford this sum. After all, as one of the six grand monarchs beneath Dao Sanqian, he had dominated for many eras and should have immense resources.

The elder’s expression changed continuously. 30,000 was also approaching the monarch’s limit. Losing the auction would leave him in a tough position but so would winning it.

Furthermore, losing to a big shot was rather acceptable, not an unknown junior. It would be humiliating for Three Thousand Dao, especially after all the taunts and jeers.

“31,000.” Eventually, he decided that face was more important than reason. Thus, he gritted his teeth and continued.

In a way, making this bid showed everyone the monarch’s wealth and his sect’s superiority. If Li Qiye kept on going, then at least he has tried his best.

Everyone took a deep breath after hearing this and turned their attention toward Li Qiye.

“Wow, 31,000. You win, Cloudgrasp Elder. A starting price of 3,000 went all the way up to 31,000, so impressive. Three Thousand Dao’s wealth lives up to its reputation.”

“You!” The elder turned red, thinking that he has fallen into a trap.

The sarcastic praise didn’t make the elder feel any better about winning. It only served as a reminder of stupidity.

At first, due to Li Qiye’s speed and decisiveness while bidding, everyone thought that he truly coveted the void jade. Now, it seemed that he had no intention of winning in the first place, only wanting to bury the elder alive.

The old man vomited blood from anger and fainted. He could have won with just 5,800 until Li Qiye got involved.

“31,000, sold.” The auctioneer slammed his hammer. It was too late for the elder to change his mind.

Many big shots smiled wryly about the final price and the trap. Anyone else would have been laughed out of the room at this point. Alas, they pitied him instead as they watched him being unconscious.

“Sigh, he can blame no one but himself. He jumped into the pit and then even poured dirt down.” Jian Ming shook his head as if he felt sorry for the guy.

If the elder was still awake, he would have vomited blood again after hearing this.

This served as a cautionary tale for the big shots. They thought that they needed to keep an eye out for Li Qiye in future auctions.

“The third item.” The auctioneer said as an ancient medicine trunk was being brought out.

Inside were ten jade bottles exuding incredible heat waves. It felt as if there were volcanoes on the verge of erupting.

“Ten bottles of fire dragon pills made by Fire Dragon Enlightened Being of Divine Dragon Valley. These are his best work, the only ones left, made from the best possible materials and with the greatest love.” The auctioneer said. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Ten bottles?” A big shot stared intensely at them.

“They’re the best indeed.” The participants agreed.

Fire Dragon Enlightened Being was a renowned alchemist who specialized in fire-affinity pills.
