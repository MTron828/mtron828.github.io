Chapter 5420: Repaying A Favor

Rumor has it that each of the four alliances had one immortal order. None expected for Illumination Conqueror to possess two.

“Given by a friend.” Illumination smiled: “What a shame.”

He had purposely used one dream order and baited Supreme into using his. With that, he planned to use the second one today.

Heaven and Divine Alliance had their full forces gathered. Although Dao Alliance and Divine Alliance were missing, All-things alone made a great target.

This second order could kill all of them. In fact, he wanted Immortal Pagoda and Eternal to be present as well.

He had considered the possibilities of All-things or anyone else in his list possessing an immortal order and found it unlikely.

He thought that the last one would belong to Imperial Alliance or Azure Peak. Thus, he purposely never provoked anyone from these powers.

Ye Fantian became the perfect bait for everyone but alas, All-things possessed the final badge.

“You deserve death.” Supreme wasted no time and unleashed his void slash again, cutting through the defenses and entering the grotto.

“Go!” The members of the two alliances rushed forward.

“To battle!” Devil and Riverwalker led the other dragon lords and conquerors to fight.

].

The grand formations of the grotto empowered them while launching impressive beams. Although they were drastically outnumbered, this was the most favorable location for a fight. Illumination had spent untold resources for the sake of creating a powerful foundation for his grotto.

Devil and Riverwalker focused on controlling the flow of the formations’ momentum, empowering allies and slaying foes.

Unfortunately, no defensive lines were stopping Supreme’s sword. He served as the vanguard and was unstoppable.

The formations - effective but far from omnipotent - couldn’t encompass the entire battlefield. They had no chance of locking down an apex cultivator such as Supreme. Devil and Riverwalker realized this and only aimed at other targets, completely ignoring Supreme.

Without anything slowing him down, Supreme killed a dozen dragon lords and conquerors in no time at all. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He appeared before Illumination and unleashed a void slash capable of killing conquerors as if they were mere mortals.

“Boom!” However, a palm descended with a domineering aura. Those nearby felt suffocated as if a divine mountain was pressing down on them.

Supreme pulled his sword back into a defensive pose after the failed attack.

The assailant was none other than an old man. However, he maintained a muscular frame and looked to be rather vigorous. His broad shoulders and arms could lift up the sky.

His physical appearance was impressive but there was a distinct absence of the dao and aura. Nonetheless, he gave everyone a feeling of security, that he could handle anything during the most perilous moments.

“Fellow Daoist Immensity.” Supreme became serious after seeing him.

“Immensity Conqueror!” The rest became startled to see another apex conqueror.

Contrary to Supreme and the others, Immensity had been neutral all this time. How did Illumination get him to come here?

“Fellow Daoist Supreme.” Immensity greeted back with a natural expression.

In previous eras, both sides have tried to recruit him to no avail.

“I didn’t expect you to help out Illumination.” Supreme said.

“What can I do? A favor must be repaid.” Immensity sighed, revealing the reason for his interference.

“You gave him the second badge.” Supreme speculated because Immensity spent most of his time in the three illusory realms.

“Yes, I came across it by chance.” Immensity nodded.

This made everyone wonder about the past between Immensity and Illumination. Just how heavy was this debt? Giving Illumination an immortal order wasn’t enough?

“I will get past you then.” Supreme was not deterred by this unexpected development.

“It is my pleasure to see your blade.” Immensity said before summoning his weapon - a truncheon.

It seemed to be made of the stars, hence its incalculable weight.

“Heaven Suppression Truncheon.” Supreme’s eyes narrowed after seeing this.
