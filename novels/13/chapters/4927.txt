Chapter 4928: Deer Man

“What the heck are you talking about, evil wind?” Ming Shi asked. Yunyun and Goldcrest didn’t feel anything either.

Li Qiye didn’t look down for a while, still with a smile.

“Is there something peculiar?” Yunyun whispered.

“It’s coming.” Li Qiye said.

The princess heard this and grabbed Li Qiye’s hand again: “You have to help me, let me be lucky once.”

“I’m not your lucky star, how am I going to do that?” Li Qiye responded.

“No, do it right now.” She coquettishly winked her eyes repeatedly, trying to be cute: “This pawnshop absolutely has numerous secrets, our ancestors have tried before to no avail. Don’t be shy now and miss this rare opportunity, this is your chance.”

Her tone became forceful at the end, causing the other two to shake their head.

“The princess has no shame.” Goldcrest commented.

“I dare you to say that again, Rooster.” Ming Shi glared at him.

He chuckled and wasn’t afraid of her. Plus, he gave her a lot of leeway due to her lively and kind nature.

“Now.” Li Qiye said.

Ming Shi dropped the issue with Goldcrest and looked up at the sky.

“Ring, ring, ring…” Everyone suddenly heard ringing from a distance even though there was nothing in sight.

It brought about a joyous atmosphere as if something grand was coming.

“Finally!” Students rejoiced after hearing this and lost their patience. All turned their head toward the source.

Radiant Young Monarch and Swordgrasp Young Noble were present as well, sharing the same excitement.

The ringing became increasingly pleasant and louder. Suddenly, a figure appeared and left a dark trail along the way. Each leap consisted of ten million miles, taking it from the horizon to above the academy in no time at all.

“Yes!” The students sheered.

“It’s here, it’s here!” Ming Shi couldn’t contain her excitement and gripped Li Qiye’s hand tighter: “Young Noble, look, look at its secrets!”

So it turned out that the so-called pawnshop was a carriage pulled by a deer. The carriage was bright red and had a happy aura.

A lantern was hung by the side, nearly out of oil so the flame was flickering. Nonetheless, it managed to light a path for the carriage.

Everyone then turned toward the driver - an old man also wearing a bright red robe. It covered him completely and prevented others from seeing his frame.

He had a red hat as well on top of a long, white beard, hiding his features.

The thing attracting everyone’s attention was an overly large sack right behind him. It seemed to have numerous treasures inside.

“Wait, it’s all wood.” A few students took note of this and were surprised. Everything was made from wood, whether it be the deer, the carriage, or the old man.

Upon closer inspection, they didn’t seem to be carved but were actual entities. It was as if there was a type of tree growing into this form after countless years. All three entities were one, not separate.

Moreover, they had a connection to the world itself. As it flew in the air, it was no different from the air or the earth.

“I didn’t expect this.” A first-timer student said.

“This is the pawnshop, it has always been like this.” A friend who had heard about this from his ancestor said.

“Are the rumors true then?” The first student asked, skeptical about this being’s fortuitous ability.

“It has been around for millions of years. In fact, it might date back to the founding of the academy, so you tell me.” The friend responded while staring at him as if he was an idiot.

Numerous stories existed of lucky people becoming masters thanks to this event, the most recent one being Greenmountain Conqueror.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He was a great genius from Reincarnation but had issues with the grand dao, unable to harmonize with it.

As a student in Abroad, he eventually found a scroll from this event, and harmonization became possible. Due to his innate talent, the dao became easy enough for him to become a conqueror.

This was a prime example of the potential benefits stemming from this event. Thus, all the students were excited to participate.

“Long time no see, young friends.” The wooden man spoke. His voice was no different from a living grandpa and was brimming with life.

The tone soothed and comforted listeners, changing their state of mind. Skeptical students suddenly found the rumors plausible afterward.
