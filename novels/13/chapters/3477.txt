Ancestor Lu might not be the most powerful in Ancestral City but he was quite influential. Thus, his direct denial of the marriage pact took the crowd like a storm.

Earlier, the saintess’ comment could be considered the hotheaded temperament of a woman. It would only lead to minor disharmony between the two sects. After all, a junior had no say in something so important.

Now, it became more than just empty talk when it came from Ancestor Lu. This meant a complete disregard for face. Any friendly relationship between the two sects was finished from this point onward.

This happened too quickly for the crowd to react. It was especially hard for Yin Yang Gate because Ancestral City showed no signs of it previously.

“What is Ancestral doing? Maybe the non-supporters have taken charge?” Many ancestors quietly discussed this matter. They have heard about the two sides previously.

Perhaps Ancestor Lu’s faction has taken charge and made this decision.

“Elder Lu, this is a matter of utmost importance. Please think about it first.” The ancestor from Yin Yang said.

This ancestor was confused because he had met Ancestor Shi just several days ago. Elder Shi was a supporter of this marriage alliance and he was still in charge.

Moreover, he hasn’t heard of any political changes in Ancestral Recently. Elder Shi and his faction shouldn’t have lost authority.

Therefore, why the sudden change of mind? He couldn’t come up with a reason.

“This is a unanimous decision of Ancestral City after considerable deliberation.” Elder Lu answered with a solemn expression: “We are no longer friends, let alone allies.”

This stirred the crowd more than the previous statement. Breaking the marriage pact was one thing because not all ancestors there supported this. The other faction had plenty of support.

But now, the latter sentence was much harsher and carried more gravity.

Previously, the two sects were still friends for many eras despite not having a marriage alliance. What was Ancestral City up to now? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“A declaration of war in the future?” One neutral ancestor took a deep breath.

“Not necessarily.” His wise friend whispered: “I just think they want to sever all ties with Yin Yang.”

Many felt this way when the saintess revealed her stance. Elder Lu’s confirmation made them confident in this speculation.

“But why? What would make Ancestral City turn from Yin Yang Gate? Such an extreme decision?” One listener wondered.

Ancestral City kept to itself but still maintained a cordial relationship with the major powers in the north. This change of attitude could include Skylight and Firmaments as well.

“Elder Lu, I want to see Elder Shi.” The ancestor from Yin Yang demanded. The marriage alliance was one thing but this was one step short from embarking on a path of no return.

“You may see him whenever. He’s right in the city.” Ancestor Lu spoke with a calm demeanor - a sign of absolute confidence in their choice.

“Okay, leave if you have no business here.” Pearlstone Saintess then told the rest.

A hush fell over the scene. Many glanced over at Li Qiye - the target of their mobilization. They naturally didn’t want to leave without the imperial treasury.

“What about Li Qiye?” A hidden crowd member asked.

“The young master is our city’s esteemed guest.” Pearlstone responded.

“Esteemed guest? This is clearly the case of a wine-lover’s heart not being in the cup. You only want to monopolize his imperial treasury.” Another hidden speaker said. [1]

The crowd traveled far just for Li Qiye. Now, they were annoyed that Ancestral City would take him away.

“Just be straight about wanting the treasury, don’t act so righteous.” Someone else added.

They might not dare to fight Ancestral City’s army but also didn’t want to give up so easily.

“No one can accept this.” Another purposely instigated.

The ancestor from Yin Yang cleared his throat and declared: “Li Qiye is a heinous murderer. Our three sects wish to try him along with the rest of the world.”

“That’s right, Ancestral City can’t keep him.” Skylight National Teacher added.

“I agree.” Firmaments Sect Master said.

All three behemoths were on the same side now, clearly having reached an agreement.

Yin Yang Gate, in particular, was more pressed to not let Ancestral City have the imperial treasury after this conflict.

Ancestral was already strong enough. If they were to get the treasury, it wouldn’t be long until they became unstoppable in the north.

Thus, the situation became quite interesting. The other side had just fought a bloody battle over the treasury. Now, they decided to team up to capture Li Qiye again.

The other sects realized that the behemoths were using them but they didn’t mind at this point. It would be all over if Li Qiye were to leave with Ancestral. Both the imperial treasury and the phoenix’s legacies would be gone.

“We support Yin Yang Gate. Li Qiye’s trial should be open to the public. Ancestral City can’t just take him away.” An ancestor from a big power said.

“Right, this has to be the way to go, a public trial.” Others chimed in.

They had no chance to fight against Ancestral City alone. However, all of them combined could do so since Ancestral City might not risk offending everyone else.

“What if I want to go with Ancestral City?” Li Qiye smiled.

“No.” An ancestor immediately shouted: “This is no longer up to you.”

“We demand justice for the death of our disciple!” The Yin Yang ancestor shouted.
