Chapter 3825: Speculation

Li Qiye didn’t stick around for long after the two were gone. He tossed the hammer back onto the anvil and descended.

“That’s it?” Both the students and teachers nearby were surprised, especially the latter who had been watching the entire time.

The teachers thought that Li Qiye was on the verge of doing something incredible after refining the remnant dregs. Perhaps a great treasure would be the result.

The molten liquid in the cauldron was still surging and splashing. The flame was powerful as well, not allowing the liquid to cool.

Some teachers landed on top of the peak with students behind them.

“Hmm, let’s see here.” A powerful teacher wanted to scoop up the molten metal but pulled his band back due to the scorching temperature.

They had no idea why Li Qiye left midway during the process.

“Maybe he was just playing around out of boredom?” A different teacher murmured.

One older teacher shook his head: “No, Li Qiye is not that type of person. He does everything for a reason.”

“Is it possible to refine these dregs into a weapon?” A teacher asked: “Sure, the dregs left behind by dao lord-level refinements are probably valuable but not in the eyes of someone like him. This is too much effort.”

He was right. Ordinary cultivators could find the molten metals to be valuable. On the other hand, the true masters wouldn’t waste their time refining these waste materials.

“He’s too eccentric, we can’t understand his intent.” The old intent shook his head and concluded.

His peers agreed with him and smiled wryly.

“Well, that doesn’t matter. The return of the flame is still great news for our academy.” One teacher became excited.

Since the cauldron was back, the academy had more chances in the future to craft an amazing artifact.

“True, it’ll be way easier to craft something strong now.” Others nodded in agreement.

Ultimately, they didn’t dare to interfere with Li Qiye’s business. They ignored the perpetual interaction between the flame and the remnant metals.

The students that tagged along were curious as well. However, they focused on the hammer instead.

Everyone knew about its legendary tales with the dao lords and top sovereigns. Alas, no one was able to pick it up after the main flame extinguished until Li Qiye.

He summoned an ocean of lightning with it and took down Sword Hero. By this point, even a blind fool could see how wondrous this hammer was. It was right in front of them too.

“Should we try lifting it again?” A student asked.

“Even if you can lift it, are you going to take our academy’s treasure away?” A peer glared at him.

“Right, but there’s no rule about taking it away.” The first student remained interested.

The crowd agreed too. The hammer was left here for millions of years and there was no rule about bringing it away.

The academy seemed content with just leaving it alone. Anyone could take it if they were capable enough.

Thus, they stared at the teachers who were still talking about the remnant metals. The latter didn’t seem to care about this issue.

“Well, if the academy doesn’t stop us, it’ll belong to whoever can take it away.” The first student asserted.

This logic was simple enough. The listeners felt their heart beating faster.

A while ago, students attempted to lift the hammer out of curiosity. Now, after seeing it in action, temptation and greed overwhelmed them.

“I’ll give it a shot.” A hot-headed student stepped forward.

“Up you go!” He gripped the hilt with both hands and mustered all of his strength. He activated his merit laws and different methods to no avail.

Others gave it a shot again despite the first failure. In fact, some even teamed up and tried to lift it together.

No one managed to move the hammer, not even by an inch.

“Why can’t we move it?” They eventually gave up, albeit begrudgingly because Li Qiye did so without putting in any effort at all.

The hammer seemed like paper when he lifted it earlier. They had no idea why.

“Just give up. Your current selves have no chance.” The oldest teacher walked over and smiled at the group.

“Teacher, why Li Qiye and not us?” A student inquired.

“This is a heaven-defying hammer. Only powerful characters like dao lords and supremes can lift it. Others will just be wasting their time.” The teacher replied.

“This still doesn’t answer how Li Qiye did it. He’s not a dao lord or supreme.” Another argued. Though Li Qiye was devilish, his cultivation was still shallow.

“Because the hammer allows it.” The teacher patiently explained.

“Hmm?” The students remained confused.

“The hammer finds Li Qiye worthy, that’s why he can lift it without exerting any strength.” The teacher said.

“So this hammer basically can recognize its masters?” Another asked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Sounds about right.” The teacher nodded.

This revelation caused the students to ponder.
