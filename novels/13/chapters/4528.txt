Chapter 4529: Untethered Vajra

“Slap me again? In your dreams, today is a different day.” Alchemy Child snorted.

“Oh? Got a backer this time?” Jian Ming smiled and said: “I’m afraid to say that your backer won’t be able to protect you from the young noble. He can wipe out your sect with one hand.”

“You’re not leaving this place unscathed today after insulting our sect!” Alchemy Child threatened.

“Yep, that mouth still needs a slapping.” Jian Ming concluded.

“Gold Elder.” Alchemy Child told the old man next to him.

The latter had no choice but to step forward. He cupped his fist and said: “Gentlemen, let’s put this behind us. We can talk and clear out any misunderstandings. I, Untethered Vajra, would truly appreciate it.”

“Untethered Vajra?” Wise has been staring at the old man the entire time. He thought that he knew him from somewhere and became startled after hearing the title.

“Untethered Vajra?” A young listener nearby found it unfamiliar.

However, the older experts, especially the vagabonds, immediately became emotional.

“He’s here?” One of them blurted.

“Who is he?” The young listener asked.

One old vagabond stared at the old man with admiration in his eyes. He excitedly explained: “Untethered Vajra is renowned and was well respected by many great powers. He might be the greatest vagabond cultivator in the world.”

“He’s that strong?” Those nearby were surprised.

“At least in the previous generation, he was unbeatable among vagabond cultivators.” The old vagabond continued.

Untethered Vajra swept through the realms and was considered an esteemed guest wherever he went. Some considered him to be the most accomplished vagabond cultivator.

This was easier said than done. Though he wasn’t the strongest cultivator, he was a role model for those from humble beginnings.

“That’s not what I heard. He might not be a vagabond or from a small sect at all.” A passerby joined the conversation: “Rumor has it that he is from a timeworn lineage dating back to the previous epoch. They lived in a place known as Vajra World and were the strongest there. Alas, the great calamity ended their epoch. Nonetheless, their sect was lucky enough to have survivors. These men then lived in seclusion and no longer went by their old names. Of course, these facts are all disputed…”

This passerby had so much knowledge of the vajra and enlightened the crowd.

They noticed that he seemed to be protecting Alchemy Child and started talking.

“Why is he mingling with True Immortal?” One asked.

“Not strange at all, he was good friends with many great powers and even served as a guest cultivator for many of them.” An expert responded.

“Vajra, help me teach them a lesson, let them know the immensity of the world.” Alchemy Child ordered.

The vajra smiled wryly. He thought that he was very unlucky being near Golden. True Immortal then came asking for help. He didn’t like being ordered around by this arrogant brat. Alas, there was nothing he could do.

Alchemy Child recruited him because the youth was hellbent on obtaining the immortal grass. He couldn’t return to his master empty-handed. He wanted to contribute and be remembered for this.

“Why did Alchemy Child seek Untethered Vajra? True Immortal has plenty of experts.” A crowd member commented.

True Immortal certainly didn’t need to ask anyone for help but it was happening right now.

“Maybe their ancestors can’t come to Golden fast enough.” One youth said.

“No, they’re doing this on purpose. Robbing someone is not good for their reputation.” One senior understood and sneered.

Others agreed with him right away. True Immortal cared about its reputation and didn’t want others to think that they were robbing Li Qiye of his immortal grass, at least not so blatantly.

Once this happened, they could justify it being Alchemy Child - a servant - acting on his own volition. Furthermore, Untethered Vajra was not from their sect.

Untethered Vajra didn’t know all of this, only that True Immortal needed his help and he couldn’t refuse.

“Fellow Daoist, please come with us to True Immortal.” He demanded with a commanding tone.

His voice intimidated the crowd and showed them his power.

“Not interested.” Li Qiye glanced at him once.

“I apologize then.” He roared and raised his hand.

Bestial roars could be heard as a golden radiance erupted. Images of dragons and tigers could be seen as he became gigantic.

The crowd members shuddered after seeing his gathered power.

“Whoosh!” His large hand reached for Li Qiye with flashing lights, looking like a golden dragon with its claws at the ready.

Li Qiye seemed feeble in comparison, unable to resist. Alas, once it actually came close enough, it was no different than a breeze hitting him.

Li Qiye became amused. This man was putting up an act so he decided to play along. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He retaliated with a palm strike and easily stopped the attack. The old man exaggerated by staggering several steps backward.

“Fellow Daoist, your power is… something else.” Untethered Vajra struggled for breath.

“That strong?” Spectators couldn’t believe it.

“His cultivation doesn’t look that impressive.” An older cultivator found it puzzling.

Of course, it wouldn’t be difficult for Li Qiye to stop this combatant. However, he didn’t use any force at all yet the man still acted as if he was defeated.
