“The girl got this far too.” Li Qiye was surprised to see this and instantly decided to go back in time.

He focused his gaze on the statue in order to read her past. She appeared before him, no longer a statue but a beauty dressed in white and a piece of jade tied to her waist. The simplicity of her attire didn’t diminish her nobility.

The loose dress didn’t fully conceal her breathtaking, perfect curves. Her delicate and tall figure appeared to be meticulously chiseled by the creator. All in all, not a single flaw could be found.

Unfortunately, her face itself was hidden behind a veil with the exception of her vivid eyes. Of course, this didn’t stop Li Qiye’s gaze.

He broke through the enigmatic barriers and found an imperial aura that has been waiting for none other than him.

“Shouldn’t have done this.” He sighed and said.

Skyshroud Emperor’s origin remained unknown. Some believed that she hailed from the Heaven Race, perhaps even Celestial Court.

“I heard Skyshroud Emperor’s bloodline is second to none. Do you know the popular saying about her? That she was born for someone alone.” Someone suddenly remarked next to him. [1]

He looked over and saw a gorgeous girl who didn’t seem to care about her appearance at all, wearing a loose, unisex robe while not having any makeup on. Her hair was casually tied into a ponytail as if she came from a small village.

Both her attire and demeanor didn’t match her stunning beauty. Nonetheless, this created a marvelous contrast and a unique charm that was hers alone. Of course, some would consider this to be an improper deviation from the norm.

In fact, her appearance had caused hushed discussions among the crowd. Many came to greet her but she only nodded slightly at best, not wanting to participate in pleasantries.

Li Qiye smiled and stared at her. She stared back with a golden radiance flashing deep within her pupils.

“My name is Ye Fantian. May I have your name, Young Noble?” She bowed and asked with a carefree demeanor.

Xiao Qingtian, Ye Fantian, and Li Zhitian were the “three Tians” of the upper continents. Their talent was historically exceptional.

She was the current jewel of Divine Alliance, taught by one conqueror and dao lord after another. In fact, Sword Sea Dao Lord himself had taught her the dao.

Since all three shared a similar name and talent, it wouldn’t be strange for them to share the same cultivation realm.

This was actually not the case. Xiao Qingtian and Li Zhitian both had twelve sacred fruits currently. If they could create an immortal shell, they would be able to compete with existences such as Supreme in the future.

Ye Fantian, on the other hand, picked the imperial road even before the other two became dragon lords. Thus, her cultivation was initially faster but for some unknown reasons, it stagnated entirely.

Because of this, she was mocked by many including her own sect members. They said that she didn’t belong in the trinity.

Their disdainful ridicule didn’t affect her in the slightest. She remained free-spirited and continued her path.

Something noteworthy was that despite her apparent setback, the upper echelon of Divine Alliance didn’t give up on her. They continued to treat her as the heir.

Once the public found out about this, they stopped mocking her and started respecting her instead.

Why? Because of several historical precedences, one of which being Immensity Conqueror who was stuck at one fruit.

At first, everyone believed that this was his limit. He shattered this notion when he obtained eleven dao fruits in one go, surpassing those who had surpassed him previously.

Therefore, many speculated that this was a similar scenario - Ye Fantian obtaining twelve dao fruits in one step.

Two other conquerors, the best of the best, had done something similar - Demon and Light-dragon Conqueror.

With this, she would be able to become an apex conqueror comparable to Immortal Pagoda and All-things Dao Lord. At that point, her two rivals would pale in comparison.

Now, the consensus was that she was a slumbering monster - the potential successor of Divine Alliance.

“I feel that calling you young noble rolls off the tongue more than Brother Li.” She said after Li Qiye told her his name.

“That’s fine.” Li Qiye smiled.

She stared at him before glancing at the bear and the blue-robed old servant. The bear’s power was obvious but the same couldn’t be said about the old man.

“Greetings, Senior, may I have your name?” She bowed in his direction.

“I’m just a servant.” The old man responded with a deep voice.

Her brows furrowed slightly since she felt that she had met him before, and that she even knew him. There must be a reason why this unfathomable cultivator was serving Li Qiye.

“Young Noble, it would be an honor for our Divine Alliance to have you join us.” She got straight to the point and extended an invitation.
