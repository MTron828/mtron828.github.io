Li Qiye was immobilized as if his veins had been sealed, unable to muster any strength.

“Fiendish Confinement!” A horrified spectator shouted.

“Yin Yang’s terrible imprisoning technique.” Someone had heard of it before.

This was meant for capturing evil villains or traitors. A large-scale version of this technique could capture thousands of enemies on the battlefield in one swoop.

If all the chains were focused on one person, it should be enough to capture a heavenly Sovereign. This technique was both effective and cruel.

Once trapped, the victim’s muscles and veins were finished. They would become crippled and be stuck on a bed for the rest of their lives.

“He can’t move.” The spectators thought that Li Qiye was a fish on the chopping board now.

“Kill him!” A shout came from Firmaments Sword Formation. The divine swords started rotating into a circle, forming a massive drill of immense destruction. It intended to reduce Li Qiye to bits.

“Raa!” The golden dragon formation also roared. The scales on the creature shot out like the sharpest blades in existence.

This torrential attack could add a thousand holes onto a mountain. Li Qiye wouldn’t fare much better.

The dragon didn’t stop there and slashed at Li Qiye’s throat with its ten claws, wanting to decapitate him right away. After a single flash, the claws were already next to Li Qiye’s neck.

The triple attacks came in unison with the greatest urgency.

Escaping was impossible. Of course, the victim was immobilized anyway. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“There’s no avoiding this.” Everyone thought that it was over.

“Right.” They knew that it would be a terrible death - exploding to dust.

“That’s what he gets for opposing Yin Yang Gate. Nothing good can come from it. Arrogant people like him will always be killed, it’s an honor to go down to the princess and the others, what more does he want.” Another coldly gloated.

Quite a few people here wanted Li Qiye to die so they were applauding.

“Boom!” In this crucial moment, an ocean of lava came out of the domain and drowned Li Qiye entirely. It became a cataclysmic scene akin to the end of the world.

The fight with the geniuses earlier had some erupting flames but this was on another scale entirely. The shockwaves from the influx of lava sent the spectators flying.

“Screech!” A screech could be heard - one that could frighten even the cruelest devil king and tear apart the azure.

“A phoenix!” Someone saw the image of a phoenix within the flame. The rest became stunned.

Just its image was enough to intimidate the nine firmaments. Even the gods would run away since struggling was futile.

“A mythical divine beast...” Some dropped to their butt or their knees.

This wasn’t a real phoenix but the image of one alone was unbeatable.

“The legends are all real, this was really a phoenix’s nest.” One ancestor became amazed. He didn’t think he would be able to witness something like this in his lifetime.

The image spread its fiery wings and blotted out the sky. It flapped once and unleashed the flames, ready to annihilate everything.

The chains around Li Qiye, the chilling mirror above, the countless divine swords - all were melted in no time at all.

The wings of the phoenix severed all affinities in its path. Just a tiny touch immediately cut down the massive golden dragon and dissolved the formations.

“Ahh!” Blood rained down along with severed heads. The ground became red in no time at all.

The armies of all three sects were immediately killed. The several ancestors along with the trio of geniuses weren’t spared either.

Their eyes were wide open while their head was separated from their body. They only managed to see the wings of the phoenix as the last thing.

They finally learned what could be considered a sure-kill move and total despair. Their merit laws and treasures were useless against this great bird.

The bodies finally fell to the ground, resulting in loud thumps. Blood flowed like a stream in the domain. The alliance was massacred like insects.

A while ago, Wu Zhongtian and the other two geniuses thought that they were untouchable. Now, their corpses were becoming cold on the ground.

This result was as shocking as can be.
