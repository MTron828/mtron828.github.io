The altar suddenly rose, shifting into something resembling a jar at first before finalizing its form as a drill.

The mountainous drill started spinning, resulting in continuous explosions that intensified alongside the rotation speed.

The drill flutes were deep and wide with sharp edges. The tip itself could pierce through anything. It tilted upward; its back size pushed down on the ground.

“Hellbreaker Drill!” An expert from the last generation recognized this artifact and said: “A sieging tool of Three Truths that hasn’t been seen in a long time. Three Truths Dao Lord created it for his disciples to take down demonic fortresses.”

“A high-level weapon artifact empowered by thousands of experts? Damn.” Another shuddered.

Three Truths Dao Lord’s lifelong goal was to subdue evil and demons. However, some of these creatures hid deep in the valleys and mountains - easy to defend and impossible to siege.

Therefore, he spent ample effort and thoughts to create this drill with a meticulous method. The user didn’t need to be especially strong since it could activate via the power of the mass. It would be just as effective.

This was a perfect weapon to attack another sect’s stronghold during war.

“Go!” The elders of Divine Black saw the drill ready to fly into the air and personally presided over the grand formation.

The thousands of disciples in Divine Black also added their energy and vitality into their defensive scheme.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Numerous crystal barriers at the dao lord level materialized.

“Boom!” The drill flew upward and thrust straight towards the first barrier, causing sparks to go everywhere.

The entire sect quaked, the same with the sky. It could have easily devastated their territory without these activated barriers.

The barriers were no joke. This powerful drill still couldn’t break it, only leaving behind a shallow white mark.

“Rumble!” It then started spinning right on the impact point, hellbent on breaking this defense down.

“Full force!” The elders of Divine Black shouted. The members no longer held back. They sent their chaos true energy and grand dao power into the grand formation.

The main formation became resplendent and more barriers materialized on top of being thicker than before. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Divine Black’s barriers aren’t just for show.” Many praised after seeing this.

Divine Black was an ancient sect that had a dao lord before. Ordinary powers had no chance of taking it down, the same with this drill.

“Members of the Firebird Branch, follow me!” The fifth daoist, the old woman, rode her bird towards Divine Black.

A battalion split off from Three Truths’ army and followed her. Their target was Jade Bird Peak.

“Firebird Against The Heaven!” The old woman shouted. Her energy erupted as she unsheathed her sword. It immediately turned into a sharp claw.

“Firebird Against The Heaven!” The members of the battalion immediately formed a firebird formation connecting with the old woman. It took the form of this bird and she was in charge.

The firebird’s wings blotted out the area as it screeched and unleashed its sharp claws down below. It seemed eager to break an opening via Jade Bird Peak.

“Activate the formation!” Zhang Yue was undeterred. The members of Jade Bird immediately activated their own formation.

A jade bird emerged, green from top to bottom. It was empowered by the overarching formation of Divine Black as well.

The two gigantic birds started fighting above; each was as fierce as the other. Gales emanated from their movements; the clouds dispersed. Their claws left deep marks on the ground.

“Elephant Branch, with me!” The third daoist riding an elephant commanded.

His elephant took one step forward and created intertwining runes, eventually forming an elephant formation.

The equivalent battalion fused into this formation and a gigantic elephant emerged. This thing was taller than any peak in Divine Black, seemingly capable of swallowing the stars. Its long nose could coil around a thousand mountains.

“Boom!” The elephant stomped on the first crystal barrier, causing the entire sect to quake. This looked quite effective.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” It then swung its nose repeatedly down on the barrier. Light started scattering from the barrier surface.

“Raa!” A tiger roar could be heard. The chief elder on top of Furious Tiger shouted: “Enough!”

He led the disciples there to use their power in order to empower another formation. The tiger roar had an insane power.

A white tiger eventually emerged on top of the peak. It jumped down and its heavy tail crushed the land. It became the elephant’s opponent.

Though Iron Whip Demon King was dead, the chief elder took over and the power of this peak didn’t weaken.

The two fierce creatures fought outside the sect and destroyed the landscape to the spectators’ horror. These creatures could easily crush them into mincemeat.

“Hmph.” The man riding the flood dragon joined the fray: “Men, follow me. We shall refine our enemies.”

He utilized his pagoda and activated the formation within.

“Go!” Another battalion entered the formation. The pagoda immediately became gigantic, large enough to put all of Divine Black inside.

“Poof!” It sent out an endless wave of flames, capable of scorching all demons.

“Demon Incinerator!” The man shouted and used the formation to its full potential with the help of his fellow sect members.

A figure emerged within the flame, looking like a celestial descending to the mortal world for the sake of killing evil.

The flame naturally aimed straight for Divine Black with unstoppable momentum.

“Bring it!” Mountainbearer King laughed and instructed his disciples to start activating their part of the formation.

“Clank!” A great shield flew out with a bronze shimmer. A force capable of flattening everything erupted. This shield was capable of both defense and offense - an omnipotent formation.
