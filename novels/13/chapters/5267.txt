Chapter 5268: Worse Than A Beast

Li Qiye stood in a casual pose, prompting the woman to shout: “Li, are you ready?!”

“Can you address me differently? Like Fiercest or Young Noble, Boss is fine too?” Li Qiye said.

“No more wasting time, you’re going down!” She roared and leaped forward, utilizing the same grappling dao.

The old servant and Li Zhitian activated their heavenly gaze to the limit, attempting to slow down time to not miss a single detail. Alas, her move seemed to surpass time itself so they didn’t get a good look at her movement at all.

“Bam!” Li Qiye fell in perfect synchronization with her momentum. It was as if the two had seamlessly coordinated a dance together with an unparalleled level of understanding and teamwork.

She fell as well and most importantly, right on top of him. Their faces were close enough that they could feel each other’s breathing.

“Look away.” Both the old servant and Li Zhitian turned away while wondering why she fell as well.

She herself didn’t understand what happened either. It felt like he was trying to play along with her instead of performing a counter. Their rhythm intertwined perfectly, causing them to become a single entity - pulling and pushing on each other. Thus, when he fell down, so did she.

“How did you do it?” She stared at him in disbelief.

“You’re the one throwing yourself at me, I didn’t do anything.” He raised his hands innocently as if protesting.

“Cut the act.” She glared at him.

“Sigh, you’re making me feel embarrassed.” He said.

She glanced down and saw his hands wrapping around her waist: “Is this your idea of being embarrassed?”

“Sorry, sorry, I got nervous and didn’t know where to put my hands.” He said calmly: “You’re putting me in a tough situation.”

“Is that so?” She didn’t relent.

“Yes, acting like a beast right now is unbecoming of me, but acting like a gentleman seems even more inappropriate and makes me feel like I’m inferior to a beast.” Li Qiye joked. [1]

“Be a beast then.” She said provocatively.

He paused for a moment before shaking his head: “Forget it, it’s not my style.”

“You’re already worse than a beast.” She raised her voice, making it sound as if Li Qiye was about to violate her.

In reality, she was the one pressing her chest against his, seemingly determined to seduce him.

“I’m not in a position to say no.” He said helplessly.

“Then go ahead and do as you please.” She bit her lips; her eyes looking dazed from the alcohol.

“No, no, I prefer hiding in my shell like a turtle instead, I can’t die just yet.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Bah, a true coward.” She said.

“I don’t understand, I’ve been a good person all my life and I don’t think I’ve offended you.” Li Qiye asked.

“Because your last name is Li, because you’re a coward, and most importantly, your name is Qiye.” She said.

“Yes, yes, all my faults, I hope I won’t have this name in my next life or I’ll have some inexplicable problems for no reason.” He said.

She scoffed and got off him.

“Are you satisfied now, Miss? Wait, no, that sounds like we’ve done something indecent.” Li Qiye got up as well and joked again.

“One more time.” She waved provocatively.

“We should end here, your technique is truly one of a kind.” He smiled wryly.

“No need to flatter me, it won’t win you any points.” She said arrogantly: “We’re starting again and I’ll turn you into a pig head this time.”

“Fine, have it your way.” Li Qiye acquiesced.

The other two finally turned to watch again, activating all of their abilities to reach their peak state.

She didn’t immediately lunge forward this time and slowly circled around him while maintaining a distance.

“This isn’t your style, Miss.” Li Qiye stood still, or so it seemed. Somehow, his body always faced her directly as he maintained eye contact.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The old servant and Li Zhitian could see that Li Qiye wasn’t moving physically. This was an illusion because he managed to match her rhythm and momentum again.

Without knowing the context behind the battle, a spectator might mistake this as a cooperative training session. The two parties’ minds seemed to be connected.

The woman naturally knew this - her chance of victory relied on breaking this connection.

She started by purposely creating openings in her stance. Therefore, Li Qiye also had openings.

However, she remained patient because attacking right away wouldn’t work given their harmonized state.

As for the old servant and Li Zhitian, they understood the goals of the combatants but couldn’t duplicate this in action.

After a long while, she finally took action. Her movement was swift enough to create several afterimages, all attacking at the same time.

This successfully knocked him down but unfortunately, she fell down as well. There was one key difference - he was on top now.

“Look away!” The old servant and Li Zhitian had to avert their gaze again.

1. Common joke in romance novels. When the two main characters are intertwined like this, the male character is stuck thinking about whether he should make a move or not. To make a move means being a "beast" (as in lustful and out of control), but to not do anything is being "inferior" to a beast (as in having no courage like Japanese harem protagonists, you know what I'm talking about) ☜
