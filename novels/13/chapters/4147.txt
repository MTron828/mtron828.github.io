Chapter 4148: Ning Zhu’s Ability

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Jade Bamboo Rend!” The move was brimming with life and possibilities.

The most suppressive technique still wouldn’t be able to destroy it completely. After all, it had a tenacious life force regardless of the harsh conditions.

This surprised the spectators because they saw it earlier when Pinelead Sword Lord used it against Ninth.

The move stopped the suppressive aura and the terrifying abyss.

“Princess Ning Zhu.” A spectator murmured after seeing Ning Zhu getting involved.

People exchanged glances as their interest in this conflict grew. The princess had repeatedly refused the scion’s request to return to Sea Emperor. She seemed to be firmly on Li Qiye’s side - a true puzzle to everyone present.

“Why would she ruin her future like this?” One cultivator asked.

“Is she crazy? She’s going against Sea Emperor now for this unworthy guy?” A youth added.

“She must be possessed.” Even older ancestors didn’t understand. She actually picked Li Qiye over Peace Ocean Sword King: “I don’t see any charm and charisma oozing from him.”

It was one thing for her to keep her word after losing the bet. However, she had a chance to get out of the situation yet she didn’t grasp it.

The moment she swung her sword, it became clear to everyone that she was more than content with being Li Qiye’s maid.

The scion had an ugly expression, and rightfully so. He thought that he would be viewed as a savior by her. It was fine for her to take a neutral stance but to actually attack him?

He had the same thought as other cultivators and became awfully annoyed.

“Your Highness, it’s not too late to turn back or you’ll regret it.” He uttered coldly.

This was a warning, telling her to wake up or face the wrath of Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom.

“Thanks, but the string of fate between Sea Emperor and I is severed, no need to dwell on it. Scion, go back now, you’re the one making a mistake.” She calmly responded. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The crowd gasped after hearing this. She didn’t mind going against Sea Emperor for the sake of her master?

Though they didn’t understand her decision, they did appreciate her courage. After all, few dared to go against this behemoth.

“Your Highness, blame your own stubbornness then, not me.” The scion’s eyes flashed murderously.

She had chosen Li Qiye so her very existence was a symbol of humiliation for his sect. Thus, it would be best for her to die in his eyes.

“Boom!” He released his vitality. A primal beast seemed to be awakening; its aura engulfed the area to the astonishment of the crowd. Even older masters were impressed.

“Perish.” He chanted and no longer held back. Violet Abyss released a destructive torrent towards Ning Zhu.

She leaped upward for a slash capable of severing everything. No other affinity could stop it.

“Sever!” Spectators were no longer strangers to this move.

Sparks as large as boulders splashed everywhere. Waves emanated from the contact point and forced spectators back.

After this exchange, Ning Zhu staggered three steps backward. Nonetheless, she remained calm and composed.

This surprised the crowd because they thought that it would be a landslide victory for the scion. His expression soured as well since he didn’t expect her to be so strong.

“My turn.” She flew forward like a shooting star. “Clank!” Golden flashes appeared around her; she seemed to be covered by a layer of gold - a blessing from the gods.

This next move wasn’t as merciless and decisive as “Sever”. It was in tune with the rhythm of the world, seemingly containing the profundity of the myriad dao.

“Bring it!” The scion roared and swung his dao lord sword again. Another massive slash rushed forward.

“What is this sword technique?” People didn’t recognize Ning Zhu’s art, not even the ancestors who were familiar with Wooden Sword. They knew that it didn’t come from this kingdom.

“It’s not from Wooden Sword.” One ancestor said.

“Then what the hell is she using?” One expert asked.
