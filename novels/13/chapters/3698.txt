Chapter 3699: One Against All

All eyes were on Li Qiye after his appearance. He glanced at the sky and said: “The hour is almost over, it’s not too late to release them.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“And if we don’t?” The princess strongly responded.

“Blood and viscera will feel these streets then.” Li Qiye smilingly answered.

Those capable of listening became frozen as if they could see the scene of carnage already and smell the terrible stench.

“As fierce as always.” One expert commented. Others gave him a thumbs-up for always maintaining this image.

After all, the two clans could do whatever they wanted in Vajra. This was doubly so after they teamed up. That’s why Li Qiye looked so courageous to the crowd.

“You must be daydreaming if you think you can trample this place alone. I shall add your head to the ceremony as an offering to the dead...” The princess glared murderously.

“I’ve heard that plenty of time before. People are right about one thing - big breasts, small brains. This phrase is perfect to describe you.” Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted.

Some listeners couldn’t help laughing but eventually restrained themselves. The princess was adored by the royal clan so they knew better. Nonetheless, waves of laughter were still audible.

Some also stared at her breasts, whether on purpose or otherwise. They agreed that they weren’t small. Those who have actually seen her naked back then started fantasizing.

She turned red with embarrassment and trembled with rage.

“Li, I swear I’ll cut you to pieces today!” She gnashed her teeth with a twisted expression on her pretty face, seemingly wanting to eat his flesh and drink his blood.

“Let’s get started. I want to see what the two famed big shots have up their sleeve.” Li Qiye glanced at the two mansions.

Even a fool could see that he didn’t give a damn about his opponents. This relaxed attitude looked quite domineering, causing the spectators to gasp.

The two regiments took note of this and were furious. They might not be the strongest groups in Vajra but were still famous for their battle prowess. They have killed countless on the battlefield before.

Thus, Li Qiye’s disdainful attitude was directed towards them as well.

“Men!” A general on the west side from Abyss Dragon Regiment shouted.

“To formation!” The troops roared and marched forward in an orderly fashion. Their voices loudly echoed in everyone’s ears.

The soldiers to the west were brimming with powerful and bloodthirsty auras.

“They’re quite strong.” One spectator admitted.

Don’t think that the Grand Chancellor and his men were useless for being civic officials. The former was mighty, not inferior to any clan master. The members of the Zhang weren’t weak either, not limited to bookworms. Some honed their crafts on the arduous battlefield.

“Li Qiye, take out your weapon! You’re not leaving this street alive today. This is what you deserve for killing a member of our clan! We shall have vengeance!” The general of the regiment shouted.

“Well spoken but we’ll see who’ll die soon.” Li Qiye clapped and smiled.

The crowd watched with great anticipation, paying extra attention to the saber hanging by his waist.

“Sword Point again?” One of them wondered.

“I want to see him use it again. I’ve been trying to learn it recently and finally felt something. Maybe just one more time...” One Duality student’s eyes lit up.

“Sword Point!!!” Some yelled at him.

“I want to see him do something else, it’ll be boring to see Sword Point again.” An expert disagreed.

After all, not everyone could learn Sword Point. Some have given up since learning the technique was impossible. They would rather see his other ace cards.

“You’re right, I heard he got treasures from the hug mouse. It would be nice to see them.” One cultivator said, looking quite hopeful.

They wouldn’t mind seeing some top treasures from the mouse during this battle.

“Don’t worry, the weapon is here.” A newcomer interrupted the rowdy crowd.

The sky suddenly turned dark as something gigantic appeared on the western entrance.

People looked over and saw a large statue appearing out of nowhere. Once they got a better look, they found that a monk was carrying it with one hand.

It looked heavy but the monk had no problem doing so, looking quite relaxed.

“Untethered Monk...” They were surprised to see him. He seemed to be aiding Li Qiye.

“Untethered Monk is on Li Qiye’s side? Since when?” One spectator said.

The general of Abyss Dragon became startled, the same with the Grand Commander and Grand Chancellor who were still in their respective mansion.

The monk was a businessman with a carefree attitude, not paying attention to trivial courtesies. This didn’t change the fact that his power was not inferior to the four grandmasters. If he were to join the battle, no one in the two factions would be able to stop him.

“Untethered Monk...” The general staggered backward...

“Relax, relax.” The monk smiled and cupped his fist: “I’m not here to fight, just putting this weapon down. Young Master Li is eager for an exercise so I’m just a deliverer this time. I hope he’ll find it suitable.”

Having said that, he dropped the statue in front of Li Qiye. “Boom!” The street caved down a bit - a testament to its weight.

“Young Master? Is this weapon okay?” The monk placed his palms together and smiled.

“That statue is a weapon?” One spectator asked, bewildered.

“Why not?” An expert said: “It’s pretty unstoppable if he can lift it, enough to smash half of the street.”

“Wait a minute, this looks like the statue from Wish Ward? Isn’t it meant for decoration only?” An older cultivator recognized the statue’s origin.

Those who have participated in the auction at Wish Ward have seen it plenty of time.
