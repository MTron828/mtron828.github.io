Chapter 5582: Sacrificing The Sacred Tree

Li Qiye’s nonchalant attitude surprised listeners as well. His calm demeanor stood in stark contrast to Wang Teng’s untethered fury.

Nonetheless, the comment suffocated top cultivators even more so than Wang Teng’s rage.

Dao lords and conquerors could withstand the furious aura but felt helpless after listening to Li Qiye. Just his words alone acted like an invisible hand grasping their throat. Resistance seemed futile.

“Die!” Wang Teng no longer cared about the circumstances.

He had nothing but success in life, culminating in a sacred anima tree. Alas, he still had to watch his father die before him.

His sacred tree released all of its power and became radiant. All of the immortal continent could see his tree surrounded by stars. Its majestic form trumped all else.

Inhabitants of Momentous Frontier became afraid since they could be reduced to ashes in the next second. This seemed to be the end of the world.

“Boom!” A blood beam erupted and burned the sacred tree like an inferno. Once half of the tree was ignited, space melted and a blood hue took over Momentous Frontier.

The spread didn’t stop; anyone could look up and see red streams all over the immortal continent, reminding them of blood.

“He’s burning his true blood and sacrificing his tree.” A monarch gasped after seeing this.

“This is crazy, it’s a last-ditch resort, he’ll die from this.” Six-finger retreated as far as possible.

The worst of enemies wouldn’t resort to this suicidal measure. In this case, Wang Teng’s animosity couldn’t be contained.

Meanwhile, Wang Teng’s sacred tree turned into a cauldron. A radius of ten million miles started melting. Dao laws and other cycles of reality twisted from the heat and gathered toward a single point - Li Qiye.

This was an attempt to refine the power of Momentous Dao to kill Li Qiye - a fusion of the various affinities and powers. If they were to converge on Li Qiye, perhaps he would be crushed and refined.

“He will destroy Momentous Dao to avenge his father?” Monarchs and emperors ran for their lives, not wanting to become fish trapped in the net.

Unfortunately, the mortals and other living beings couldn’t run away fast enough.

Massive casualties were expected from a battle between top cultivators. Both sides would utilize their strongest merit law and techniques, often resulting in absolute destruction. Billions could perish due to mere blastwaves.

However, most wouldn’t actively choose to sacrifice a region to empower their attack. This broke their code of morality.

Of course, this wasn’t because they cared about mortals whom they often viewed as insects. It was a matter of pride and sanity.

“Big mistake, no mercy then.” Li Qiye’s brows furrowed after seeing the attempt.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Clank!” The throwing star delivered a slash capable of severing the river of time. Its chilling gleam could be from anywhere on the continent as well.

Apex cultivators and reclusive behemoths took a deep breath after sensing it. The sky vault was immediately cut into two halves. Everyone touched their neck, thinking that they had been decapitated.

Time came to a halt, leaving a still image of Wang Teng burning his blood and sacrificing his tree.

In the next second, he was dismembered into two halves - the same for his sacred tree. This shocked everyone because they had never witnessed a sacred tree being cut down like this due to its toughness.

“Rumble!” His body pieces fell along with the tree. His true blood, immortal shell, and everything else disintegrated into scattering particles. They melted into the soil and turned into nutritious worldly essences.

Wang Teng attempted to refine Momentous Dao but now, he became fertilizer for the region.
