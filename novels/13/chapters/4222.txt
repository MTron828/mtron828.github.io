Chapter 4223: Slash

“This is it.” Li Qiye chuckled and swung his sword.

“Boom!” The world spun and the stars trembled. The flow of the cosmo became affected by this single slash.

Just this casual swing could take down gods and devils. Three thousand worlds would be obliterated in the blink of an eye.

The crowd opened their mouth, wanting to shout but no words came out. An invisible hand seemed to be grabbing their throat and taking their breath away. They felt their very soul being dragged away by the momentum of the slash.

Defensive techniques were useless before the boundless onslaught. Strong resistance would be swiftly dealt with by an even greater force.

“You dare?!” Sword God Jialun roared and wanted to join the battle.

However, Lu Qi activated her sword dao and instantly blocked his path.

“Boom!” Both Peace Ocean’s dual sword dao and Void’s ultimate spatial quarantine crumbled with haste.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Their impressive power and impeccable talent stood no chance against the ultimate slash from Vastsea and Li Qiye.

“Ahh!” It dismembered them into several pieces. As the pieces fell down, their eyes were still wide open in disbelief.

Success in life stopped them from ever imagining such a terrible scenario. This was especially true for Peace Ocean. He never thought that he would be killed by his own Vastsea one day.

The stench of blood permeated the air as more flowed out.

The scene came to a deathly silence. All the spectators became slack-jawed and were unable to calm down.

Peace Ocean and Void were supreme geniuses sitting on top of the world. They were unbeatable among the young generation. Today, Li Qiye killed both without a problem. The news of their death would cause untold chaos.

“I remember meeting him the first time in Hallowed, never thought that something like today would happen.” One expert said.

Those who saw Li Qiye back in Hallowed felt the same way. The guy was only an unknown junior back then who got lucky enough to obtain the Preeminent Legacy.

People dismissed him as being an uncultured young master, absolutely not worth mentioning.

On the other hand, Void and Peace Ocean were the leader of their respective sect, possessing enough authority to change the momentum of the world.

Thus, Li Qiye couldn’t compare to either one outside of having more money. They could easily crush a brat like him whenever. This turned out to be false.

Both geniuses fell today to Li Qiye in a fair duel. Words weren’t enough to describe this event.

During the start of the feud, Li Qiye’s few supporters were mocked for taking his side against Peace Ocean and Void. One of them was Ning Zhu who thought that this day was inevitable.

Thus, she looked calm unlike the rest of the crowd. She made her choice during the legacy event back then, choosing to be his maid instead of the queen of Sea Emperor.

Many thought that she had gone crazy or stupid for doing something ridiculous.

The silence lasted for a while until Sword God Jialun broke the silence: “You!”

Li Qiye had killed the two representatives of Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel. This was an official declaration of war.

“Zzz…” Smoke came out from the broken spatial fabrics and dimensions and gathered into a second Li Qiye.

His initial body parts were still separated in the chaotic space so there seemed to be two Li Qiye at the same time.

This made people exchange glances of astonishment. Eventually, the trapped Li Qiye disappeared from sight.

Only the big shots knew that Li Qiye was never stuck in the spatial separation. He has always been outside; the broken pieces seen by them was a phenomenon known as fragmented spatial reflection.
