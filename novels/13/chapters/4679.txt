Chapter 4680: Black Coffin

Paramount Goddess should be called Paramount Ancient Ancestor by this generation, capable of sweeping through the world.

Putting aside her wonderful and kingdom-toppling appearance, just the tale of her entering Three Thousand Dao alone could never be forgotten. One ancient ancestor lost to her after another. All five monarchs tasted defeat in her hand, forcing Enveloping Monarch to fight despite a gap in seniority.

Finally, Dao Sanqian finally showed up as well after her fight with Enveloping Monarch. This battle record made sure that future generations would remember her for eras to come.

The victor between her and Enveloping Monarch remained unknown. The facts were that Dao Sanqian had to show up and that she left Three Thousand Dao with all her limbs intact. This sparked rumors of them being evenly matched. Moreover, Dao Sanqian also began an isolated training session, wanting to reach a greater height.

Some disagreed, believing that she lost. However, Dao Sanqian had qualms about killing her due to the existence of the Supreme Monarch. Therefore, he allowed her to leave Three Thousand Dao.

All in all, the actual outcome didn’t diminish her fearlessness and battle prowess.

“The temple never had a weak priestess.” A big shot from the south became sentimental.

The Supreme Monarch hasn’t shown up for eras now. The temple also chose a reclusive policy. Nonetheless, everyone knew that the temple would shock the world once it decided to participate. All the big shots exercised caution when dealing with anything perhaps related to Ancestral Divine Temple.

“Does this mean that the temple will act?” Many became surprised.

Wars and world-changing events didn’t force anyone from the temple to show up. Now, Paramount Goddess was here - a rather significant implication.

“This union seems special.” The daoist whispered while staring at the gate.

His train of thought was interrupted by a group of five appearing on the horizon. Though they were still far away, everyone felt a large boulder dropping down on their heart.

They didn’t reveal their true appearance; all wore a special black cloak with only the eyes exposed. Not a single clue about their origin could be detected.

One person led the way while the remaining four carried a coffin with a black shade that couldn’t be any blacker. It looked like charcoal and was capable of devouring light. It occasionally flashed with eye-catching black metallic pulses.

This group purposely kept a low profile while arriving. Alas, they still garnered everyone’s attention. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The crowd felt an instinctive fear and took one step backward. Even the ancient ancestors made way for them, let alone the juniors.

As they passed by, the pressure and fear intensified. Experts couldn’t help bending their back and lowering their head. The prideful geniuses showed weakness as well.

Six-dao Monarch had the strongest aura now with his six-dao affinity, forcing many to kneel. Alas, the aura-less group had the same intimidation effect as the monarch. Of course, the thing that was truly dreadful came from the coffin, not the pallbearers.

The person inside the coffin was unknown but everyone thought that it must be someone historically renowned.

Li Qiye also paid attention to the coffin after it arrived. Its destination was obviously the gate of the Primordial Union.

“Who is this?” Eventually, the pressure waned and people could speak again.

“I have no idea.” This question couldn’t be answered.

“Is that Dao Sanqian?” A speculator said.

This was immediately denied by a knowledgeable ancestor: “No, Dao Sanqian has a different style when healing to battle, bright radiance and oppressive divinity, not like this purposely conspicuous group.”

“It’s someone from Inner Ruins.” An old ancestor revealed.

“Inner Ruins….” A wave of astonishment coursed through listeners.

Inner Ruins, a place of the unknown. The only thing for certain was that it had countless masters.

A dao lord said that it was not inferior to any of the seven forbidden zones. The difference was that the inhabitants of the seven forbidden zones weren’t allowed to leave. The fist slaves of Worldbreaker were perfect examples. Inner Ruins didn’t have the same restriction.

“Which sect?” An ancient ancestor asked.

“Unsure, perhaps Divine Ridge, could be something else.” A peer shook her head.
