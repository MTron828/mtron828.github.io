Chapter 3600: Last Meeting

Time came to a still during their embrace. The woman eventually wrapped her hands around his neck and kissed him. He hugged her tightly and they kissed passionately; none wanted to let go.

After an indeterminate period, they finally let go, albeit reluctantly.

“If you want...” His voice was filled with emotion and determination, seemingly making an important decision.

“No, this is perfect already.” She pressed her finger on his lips while shaking her head.

Li Qiye sighed softly and didn’t push the issue.

“Goodbye.” This last word of his seemingly echoed across the world and inside his heart.

“I love you, goodbye. Maybe never meeting again is the best outcome, right?” She stared deeply at him in response.

Li Qiye chose to stay silent.

In the end, she couldn’t help kissing him again. The light around her became increasingly dimmer.

“Pop!” She scattered into particles falling to the ground. Li Qiye stared at them in a daze without moving, seemingly turning into a statue.

“Bye.” He eventually murmured. A drop of tear streamed down the corner of his eye. Nothing in the world was as resplendent, beautiful, and precious as this teardrop.

Unfortunately, no one else saw it at this moment.

The old servant and Fan Bai were waiting patiently outside and didn’t dare to disturb Li Qiye. They didn’t even dare to cough and disturb the duo inside.

Fan Bai was very curious about this supreme woman coming out of the wall. The whole thing was magical and what was her relationship to the young master? That’s why she kept glancing towards the main hall.

On the other hand, the old man remained composed. He was also curious about the woman’s background and origin.

A while later, Li Qiye walked out and the two of them came up to greet him.

Fan Bai glanced at the hall but the woman didn’t come out. Where is she? Wondered.

The old man knew what happened and didn’t dare to ask Li Qiye.

“Come, we’re leaving this place.” Li Qiye simply ordered.

Fan Bai was surprised because she thought that they would continue to stay here. She was more than willing to be in this remote region. This place was wonderful as long as Li Qiye was around.

The old man only nodded in response.

“I’ll, I’ll gather our stuff.” Fan Bai regained her wits and told Li Qiye.

“No need.” He shook his head and raised his hand.

“Buzz.” Bright runes appeared around the temple, capable of spatial manipulation.

The temple actually shrank in size until it became small enough to fit in Li Qiye’s hand.

Fan Bai watched in awe, not expecting this transformation. No wonder why the young master didn’t need her to gather their stuff. This temple could be brought with them wherever.

“Where are we going, Young Master?” The old servant asked afterward.

Li Qiye looked up towards the horizon and said softly: “To Duality Academy.” His eyes became slightly dazed after saying this.

The old man didn’t understand why he had this depression. However, he also gazed towards the distance after hearing the words “Duality Academy”. Certain feelings and thoughts rose inside.

“What, afraid of that place?” Li Qiye glanced at him.

“It’s nothing like that. I’m just thinking about how fast time goes by, turning into an old man in the blink of an eye.” The old man smiled and shook his head.

“That’s why many people think about immortality. That’s all you need to be eternal.” Li Qiye responded.

“Except those close to you will leave one by one.” The old man sighed.

Though he couldn’t live forever, he certainly lived longer than his contemporaries and had experienced plenty of separations.

“Right. We can only say that time spares no one. Living long enough isn’t necessarily a good thing.” Li Qiye responded.

The old man nodded in agreement.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye rode the boar and ordered.“I’ll lead the way.” The old man picked Fai Ban up before taking one step forward.

This one step took him a thousand miles - a truly astonishing speed.

“Gao!” Lil’ Yellow didn’t want to lose and also chased with lightning speed.

“We’ll see who’s faster.” The old man’s competitive blood churned after seeing this and increased his speed after laughing.

The dog utilized all four legs to their limit and soared in the sky just like a true dragon.

On the other hand, Lil’ Black and Li Qiye didn’t seem to be in a rush. However, the boar groaned after three steps as if it was using all of its might.

In reality, it was actually only a bit slower than the other two. It crossed through mountains and peaks with each step.

Just like that, the group headed for Duality Academy.

This academy was located in the Metropolis Division of Buddha Emperor Plateau. This division could be considered the most prosperous location in the holy ground. The place was home to trillions of mortals as well.

This great population served as a strong foundation for the holy ground. The most common thing in the holy ground had to be temples and shrines. Moreover, every household had a Buddha statue as well. The smoke of incense could be seen everywhere.

Buddha Holy Ground was not only the largest Buddhist sect in the southern West King. It was definitely among the largest in all of Eight Desolaces.

It was created by Buddha Dao Lord, one of the strongest dao lords in history. He possessed supreme Buddhist treasures and had entered a forbidden zone before.

Rumor has it that during his youth, he was taught by a great Vajra from an ancient holy ground belonging to an old epoch. His title was Vedas.

Vedas took in Buddha Dao Lord as a disciple and taught him Buddhism.

Later on, Buddha Dao Lord entered the world and popularized this doctrine to save many living beings. He chose the southern West King as his home and created Buddha Holy Ground. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Across the years, this power continued to grow and had plenty of believers. A very long time later, a person eventually arrived and took a look at the incense-filled holy ground.

His one chant echoed across the river of time - 80,000 Buddhas are nothing more than statues and gods up in the firmaments are mere floating duckweeds.

He then waved his hand and created his base. The Buddhist statues within ten thousand miles instantly crumbled. The incense smoke extinguished and all the high monks retreated, not daring to stay close.

Golden spring gushed from the ground beneath him. Architectures suddenly took form and just like that, Duality Academy was formed.

He was none other than the renowned Duality Master. His arrogant phrase was heard by all the masters beneath the nine heavens.

However, the invincible existences and arrogant monsters didn’t dare to respond. Buddha Holy Ground itself with its countless high monks also remained silent despite having their territory taken over by Duality Master.
