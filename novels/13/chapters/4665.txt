Chapter 4666: Shen Juntian

Just this man’s appearance alone overshadowed everyone else. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

With regard to appearance and aura, the conquerors were all exceptional - dragons among men. Alas, they definitely couldn’t compare to Shen Juntian.

If someone were to claim the young emperor to be the most handsome, it might spark a disagreement. Others might say that Five-sun King was more handsome or vice versa.

In this case, none would refute Shen Juntian being the most handsome since this was a losing battle.

He had a celestial glow and seemed to be standing in a separate dimension. He was a pure lotus born in the firmament, unstained by the mortal touch. A son of an immortal couldn’t be better looking or nobler.

In fact, the word “noble” would be considered as praise when used to describe others. However, to use it on him was belittling his actual status. Words failed to adequately picture him.

He held a golden halberd exuding the power and light of a dao lord. Dao laws poured down like heavenly waterfalls. It also issued a pleasant ringing, seemingly accepting the youth as its user.

This was a fully-awakened dao lord weapon capable of unleashing its true power. Most geniuses couldn’t reach this level of mastery when using a similar weapon.

“Shen Juntian, the son of Eight-stallion Dao Lord and the disciple of Dao Sanqian.” One big shot murmured.

When people talked about this conqueror, they would often bring up his background rather than his achievements. After all, he was the son of the most recent dao lord whose prestige still remained.

There were other dao lords’ children around but no one compared to Shen Juntian in terms of recentness.

“He has to be the dao lord’s son.” Many believed it due to his immaculate features.

There were those who doubted this because both Dao Sanqian and Shen Juntian never confirmed his origin. However, the spectators here agreed with this claim right away.

“Only a dao lord’s son can have this presence.” A high ancestor stared intensely at him.

“What do you mean? The other conquerors’ auras are just as impressive.” One junior disagreed.

The high ancestor nodded: “Sure, they are impressive as well but they don’t have this type of presence. It is the presence of a lord.”

The juniors exchanged glances of confusion.

“It is an issue of bloodline, only children of a dao lord will possess this special characteristic. Their bloodline is felt by the weapons. Look, Golden Halberd was Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s weapon, it is so happy to be with Shen Juntian. That says it all.” The high ancestor explained.

People paid more attention to the weapon and agreed. Outside of the dao lord himself, perhaps the weapon liked his children the most due to their bloodline.

“Shen Juntian!” Girls started screaming.

“I want to have your baby…” A girl shouted a bold statement while blushing.

“Me too!” Another joined in.

Their enthusiasm shocked the crowd. Of course, even proud women such as Godwhip Princess had a crush on him. This was a testament to his attractiveness.

Unfortunately, he didn’t have time to care about these beauties.

“Boom!” A big shot from the dynasty greeted him with a punch.

“Bring it.” Shen Juntian let out a captivating smile and thrust his halberd forward, releasing its unstoppable aura.

“My life wasn’t wasted, I got to see Shen Juntian!” A female cultivator became crazy.

This happened to many among the crowd. Some became dazed while staring at him.

“Divine Fist Dynasty, it’s our turn!” A thunderous voice shouted.

“Boom!” A beam descended and forced back many of the capable fist slaves.

“Tyrant Monarch is starting.” Someone commented.

“Boom!” Another wave of attack halted the offense of many fist slaves.

“Skybreak Monarch!” They recognized this combatant as well.

A shield also showed up to stop numerous punches. It contained incredible divinity.

“Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor is here too.” Many disciples cheered for the ancient ancestor.

Numerous top masters from the alliance joined the battle. This boosted their forces enough to stop the onslaught.

The king of the dynasty remained calm despite the appearance of these capable cultivators. He seemed confident in winning, not showing a sliver of anxiousness. Everything seemed to be going in accordance with his plan.

“Is this enough to stop the dynasty?” Spectators enjoyed every second of this epic battle.

“The dynasty is unfathomable.” One ancestor noted the king’s demeanor and said.

This was far from their full strength since it had plenty of invincible masters yet to join the fight. There was a reason why they managed to survive numerous expeditions from the dao lords.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye’s group has made it to the base of the mountain, the opposite side of the main battlefield.
