Chapter 5032: Shadowrider’s Origin

Nightwalker was the revered commanding god of Mist. No one expected this connection between Nightwalker and Shadowrider.

One was a demon while the other was a human from an unknown assassin organization. They were so far apart and most importantly, the commanding gods couldn’t leave Demon.

Others would be shocked to hear this. Of course, Shadowrider wasn’t lying about this matter.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Li Qiye chuckled and wasn’t surprised at all.

“Looks like your lineage is rather capable.” Li Qiye smiled and sat there like an old friend.

His attitude only frightened Shadowrider even more, not knowing his intentions. Even his true body couldn’t do anything against Li Qiye.

After two exchanges, he had a good idea of Li Qiye’s power. This was someone above the level of the lower continents with the exception of Conceal Conqueror.

“Just tell me what you want, I will try my best to fulfill your request.” He surrendered.

“Let me ask a question first. I heard the schoolmaster mention something about a particular job in the dark market back then, you should have been the one accepting it.” Li Qiye said.

“I see.” Shadowrider said: “This was all a trap for me.”

Li Qiye shrugged: “The result would have been the same. It would only take me more time to find you.”

“Yes.” He nodded and admitted: “I accepted the job and not just one, we worked together afterward.”

“Who hired you?” Li Qiye inquired.

“Don’t ask me, I have no idea.” He smiled wryly.

“Really now?” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed while gazing at him: “I will pry all of your memories out of your head and watch them, second by second.”

“I’m telling the truth. I don’t know who this person is.” He said: “I was responsible for either stopping or killing any target who tried to escape. That’s all I know, it was just a job.”

The details didn’t matter to him since he was an assassin, only the payment.

“Several big shots have died because of our work.” He added.

Li Qiye continued to stare at him and he went on: “I personally know of Sword Lord and Void Saint Child.”

Li Qiye still didn’t speak but this was enough to force him to speak: “That’s really the extent of my knowledge. Though we worked together, I was responsible for keeping an eye out for runners.”

“A guard dog.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“That’s one way to put it. I didn’t care about the target or the details.” He didn’t mind the insult.

“And what about Phenomena Conqueror?” Li Qiye asked.

“What do you mean?” He paused for a second.

“Don’t worry about anything else, just answer this first, was Phenomena Conqueror one of the victims?” Li Qiye asked.

He hesitated for a moment before answering: “I only know of Sword Lord and Void Saint Child, I didn’t see Phenomena Conqueror.”

“But you reacted earlier, you know more than this.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I am an assassin who operates in the shadow but I will not defame others.” It took a while before he answered this time.

“It’s just you and me here.” Li Qiye said: “You’re merely expressing an opinion, not accusing anyone of anything.”

“I believe the person who hired me might be a conqueror.” He eventually revealed.

“Now that’s more interesting.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “Go on.”

“I’ve never seen the person, rather mysterious. I just know that I am far weaker.” He said: “Though everything was hidden, my intuition tells me that it is a powerful conqueror.”

“A conqueror hiring an assassin.” Li Qiye commented.

“It’s a bit ridiculous, no one will believe it, but I’m sure of it.” He said.

“It’s the reason why you’re still alive. Even if you want to expose this secret, no one will believe you.” Li Qiye said.

“True.” He said.

Conquerors were supreme beings, whether they be from The Race or The People. They represented the apex of the dao.

They were worthy of respect. Though some were mass murderers, they always did it in an open manner. People would believe the words of a conqueror over that of an assassin.

“Hmm…” Li Qiye pondered the possibilities.

Shadowrider hesitated for a moment, opened his mouth as if to speak, and then closed it again.

“Which conqueror, in your opinion?” Li Qiye asked.

“... I don’t know, I lack details.” He shook his head.

In reality, there weren’t that many choices to pick from in the lower continents.

“Aren’t you curious about it?” Li Qiye smirked.

“Being an assassin is just a profession, I don’t need to be one so it’s not really any of my business.” He said.

“Why is that?” Li Qiye stared at him.

He was afraid of Li Qiye’s gaze and spilled everything: “I only want to keep this lineage going, that’s all, I don’t have to be an assassin.”
