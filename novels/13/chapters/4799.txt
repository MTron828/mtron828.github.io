Chapter 4800: Calamity

The three’s combined might couldn’t force Li Qiye to lift a finger. On the other hand, his auto-defense left them with grievous injuries.

His very existence instilled despair and fear into the spectators. What was the point of cultivating? The greatest genius working for a lifetime still wouldn’t be able to stop one finger strike from him.

An ant might shout with all of its vigors and still couldn’t gain the attention of a dragon soaring on the horizon.

Nonetheless, Dao Sanqian didn’t give up and floated upward.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Buzz.” His three thousand dao manifested again and gathered into a river of time. His shadow stretched infinitely on this temporal river and the same thing happened to his actual body.

He turned into a giant and everyone needed to look up to see his face.

This was the form many known him for - a great cultivator standing on the river of time. Prior to this, some might not know the reason for this description. They assumed that it was due to his age and experience. Now, it became rather literal - a retelling of his ultimate state.

“Buzz.” He raised both hands and controlled time itself. The strings of time suddenly shot out in all directions.

When everyone thought that they were heading for Li Qiye, they pierced through space and traveled to another location in Sky Border.

“What….” Enveloping Monarch felt something ominous after seeing this.

In this split second, something happened to the floating Three Thousand Dao.

The lineage had a broadly defined territory, acting as its leader while possessing two-thirds of the eastern land.

The other powers had strong ties with Three Thousand Dao. Their merit laws and foundations often had something to do with Dao Sanqian.

“Whoosh!” The inhabitants and cultivators suddenly saw the temporal strings appearing from the air.

“Do you see this?!” They looked up in astonishment and tried to dodge.

However, they weren’t the targets. The temporal strings drilled into the ground and disappeared from sight.

“What happened?” Confusion and horror struck them.

Initially, they thought that these strings would pierce and kill them. This was not the case.

“Buzz.” The endless territories of Three Thousand Dao had runic lines appear on the surface. They formed a massive formation.

“The dao foundation is activated?” The ancestors and monarchs of the sect became alarmed and observed the situation.

“Is something bad happening? The foundation woke up to protect us?” A disciple innocently said.

This reaction was understandable because foundations were usually activated to protect the descendants from powerful enemies.

“Rumble!” Three thousand dao in the shape of cauldrons appeared all around the sect.

“The ancestor is protecting us!” Everyone from the sect had mixed feelings about this - happy to be protected by Dao Sanqian, distressed because of a potential enemy attack.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The grand dao within them resonated with the dao cauldrons.

They became resplendent and felt their power gushing out. They thought that the great ancestor has just blessed them, allowing them to reach their peak state.

“I’m, I’m breaking through!” Someone yelled.

While regular disciples celebrated the blessing, a few ancestors and monarchs felt something off about the resonation.

“Boom!” A maelstrom suddenly emerged in the center of the sect and turned into a temporal cauldron.

It started spinning and releasing loud explosions. The resonation process suddenly became violent and dao power escaped their master’s body.

“What the hell?!” Disciples lost control. The power of their dao and dao essences streamed out of their eyes.

This happened everywhere in Three Thousand Dao. These streams of power gathered at the maelstrom and were absorbed entirely.
