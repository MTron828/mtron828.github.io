The atmosphere became awfully tense due to the arrival of Yin Yang Gate. They certainly backed up their reputation with strength.

This army of theirs proved their determination in obtaining this treasury. This significantly lowered everyone else’s chance.

After all, few sects could compete with them in terms of power and resources in the north, let alone individuals. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

A youth walked out of the chaos encompassing the yin and yang. He looked transcending, on the verge of ascension.

He wore a thin robe; its sleeves fluttered to the wind. This didn’t make him look weak in the slightest. Each step of his could take him to a greater height above the grand momentum and the azure.

Visual phenomena materialized behind him, making it look as if he had total control over the grand dao and the universe. This seemed like the coming of a ruler.

“Wu Zhongtian!” Not just the young generation but even a few ancestors were surprised.

“The first senior disciple of Yin Yang.” Some were shaken; others stared at him with admiration.

“Wait, isn’t the first brother of Yin Yang their young lord, Bai Jianchan?” An uninformed spectator quietly asked.

“No, Wu Zhongtian has this role. He started cultivating earlier than Bai Jianchan.” An older cultivator answered.

Wu Zhongtian was famous in all of the north, not just within his sect. He was known as the right-hand man of Bai Jianchan. In reality, he wasn’t only highly evaluated by Jianchan. The ancestors in the sect also felt the same way.

Some even said that if it wasn’t for a peerless genius like Jianchan, Wu Zhongtian might be the next successor.

His eyes swept through the city in a cold manner. Those gazed by it felt as if they were struck by lightning.

“Li Qiye, where are you?!” His shout echoed across the realm.

“Li?” Many experts exchanged glances and thought about the same event.

“It’s that devilish fella. Looks like Zhongtian wants revenge.” Discussions sprung up.

“He killed Zhongtian’s blood brother and Feathersword. Yin Yang won’t let this go easily.”

This was definitely another reason why Zhongtian came to Ancestral, wanting to personally avenge his fallen brother.

“The guy is finished.” A few gloated at others’ misery.

“I don’t agree.” One neutral expert voiced his opinion, albeit with hesitation: “This Li Qiye’s background is still unknown. The maiden is his backer, maybe Ancestral City is involved too.”

Her fans naturally didn’t like this comment. One of them scowled in response: “The maiden can’t protect him forever. Plus, she won’t antagonize Yin Yang over him. Actually, I’ve heard that she left the city already.”

“True, and Ancestral City definitely won’t protect him. Remember, they have a marriage pact with Yin Yang, why would they help an outsider?” Another suitor sneered.

They wanted to see Li Qiye’s death since he was a thorn in their side.

“Li Qiye, come out and accept your fate!” Wu Zhongtian thunderously demanded.

People held their breath. Some thought that Li Qiye wouldn’t show up out of fear.

“The flies are buzzing loudly nowadays. Stop bothering my Young Master’s training session, scram!” Qing Shi stepped out instead of Li Qiye.

His arrogant remark surprised everyone. They then glanced towards Zhongtian.

He dared to publicly compare Zhongtian to a fly and telling the guy to scram? No one else in the north would dare to do so.

“This brat is insane, he’s nothing more than Li Qiye’s servant. Does he think he’s a big deal?” One listener said.

“Idiot.” An expert close with Yin Yang snorted.

“Who are you?” Zhongtian stared at Qing Shi and said.

“Nobody, just my young master’s errand boy.” Qing Shi wasn’t afraid at all: “Don’t waste your breath here. The young master is busy with cultivation and has no time to deal with you. Scram.”

Those who have met Li Qiye before found that the servant was just as haughty as the master.

“Like master, like lackey.” One of them said.

Zhongtian’s eyes shot out bright rays since he wasn’t used to this treatment. He coldly uttered: “What an audacious errand boy. I’ll teach you a lesson in your master’s stead.”

“Bring it, let’s see what you can do.” Qing Shi laughed.

Most thought that Qing Shi didn’t know his own limits.

“The guy is blinded by pride and arrogance!” One spectator shouted.

“Hmph.” Zhongtian made his move - a slap.

“Boom!” The sky turned dark as a palm as big as a mountain reached for Qing Shi. The palm crushed space and contained immense power.

Zhongtian didn’t hold back and wanted to kill this servant right away.

“He can’t blame anyone for being merciless, he brought this upon himself.” Some spectators snorted after seeing this.

“Enough!” Another explosive roar sounded. It was as if a supreme existence was suppressing everyone here. People staggered backward as a result.

Wu Zhongtian was no exception, he faltered backward as well. The palm strike was easily stopped. He took a deep breath and glanced in the direction of the voice.

“Ancestral City isn’t the place to fight. This ends here.” An old yet commanding voice echoed.

“Ancestor Lu...” Wu Zhongtian’s eyes flashed.

The listeners couldn’t believe it, especially the golems who became stunned.

“Ancestor Lu is out now.” One golem said: “His Venerable is in charge of the city’s affairs.”

Not to mention ordinary experts and prodigies, even ancestors from Yin Yang would speak of him with respect.

Zhongtian was a big shot among the young generation but he lowered his head before Ancestor Lu.

No one in Ancestral dared to be disrespectful in his presence. Some even bowed.

“I had no intention of offending Ancestral City.” Zhongtian explained: “It’s just that the villain killed my brother and our sect’s disciples so we demand justice...”

He made it clear that this wasn’t a personal problem only. Yin Yang Gate had his back after losing an army.

Forgiving this issue would be detrimental to their reputation and status in the north. That’s why Zhongtian led another army here, not only for the treasury but also to slay Li Qiye.
