“Zero points for failing during the first movement, ten points for the second, and twenty points if you can make it to the last one.” He continued.

The listeners carefully pondered and wanted to make it to the second set at all costs. That would give them a chance to move on.

“The trial focuses on examining the dao heart which is the root of cultivation. Our patriarch once taught that talents decide your starting point but your destination is predicated on your dao heart, not your talents and merit laws. A firm dao heart means endless possibilities. It means that you can persevere on the long and arduous journey towards the dao.” He put on a solemn expression.

The disciples held their breath while listening. Nonetheless, some of them didn’t care about the dao heart too much. The whole thing seemed so far away and intangible.

It was better to focus on finding a powerful merit law or obtaining a peerless weapon. However, they still took this trial very seriously. More points meant an easier path for the last three trials.

“Get ready, we’ll begin soon.” The elder concluded his speech about the dao heart and reminded the disciples.

“Elder, what about the final movement?” Qianyue asked.

“You want to challenge it, right?” The elder laughed and said: “It is not part of the examination but since you made it past the third movement last time, we have discussed and agreed to let you try the final movement if you still have strength. Keep in mind that it is long and complicated, far more demanding compared to the first three. We’ll see how well you’ll be able to do.”

“Yes.” Qianyue remained blunt and didn’t say anything else.

Others would want to get more out of the seniors if they had her talents and power. She didn’t care for anything else other than the challenge itself.

Many became envious of her power. They were only thinking about making it through the first and the second movement. That would be the best result already. The third movement seemed impossible. However, she wanted the final one.

It has been a long time since the final chapter was played during this trial. Some said that when this happened, it was when their current sect master was still a regular disciple.

“Okay, we’re starting!” The elder thunderously declared and woke up the disciples.

They focused up and changed their state of mind, separating themselves from the outside world.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The bells began making indistinct sounds, seemingly coming from the deepest crevices beneath the ground.

Though the disciples tried their best to protect their mind and calm their dao heart, they were still instantly taken to a strange domain.

Mist and fog engulfed the area in a bizarre manner. The bells seemed capable of spiritual evocation, calling the soul from the body with whispers.

Many disciples shuddered as a response. The weaker ones couldn’t help opening their eyes.

They were no longer in the great hall but rather, a dark cemetery.

Graves and corpses scattered about. One could see green ghost flames among the engulfing mist and fog. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The individual disciple found themselves to be alone. Their peers were no longer next to them. This was naturally frightening to a new cultivator.

“Shit, where am I?!” One stood up and shouted.

Another turned and fled, wanting to escape from this cemetery.

The moment they lost their cool, the scene before them immediately changed. The warm sunlight returned and the cemetery was no longer there. They were now standing in front of the gate to the second trial.

They have lost control of their dao heart, hence the disqualification.

They came up to look into the hall again. The place was still the same, only that the elders and protectors had begun playing the bells. Some disciples were still there.

The hall was sealed so anyone outside was unaffected. Even if they could hear the bells, it was nothing more than regular noises.

“Sigh.” Quite a few have been teleported out before the end of the first movement.

The majority consisted of new recruits. They had shallow cultivation and a weak dao heart.

“I should have picked a spot farther away from those bells.” One disciple still didn’t realize the problem and said with regrets.

“Same, I wasn’t ready. I should have just kept my eyes close the entire time.”

As the first movement was approaching its end, several exceptional disciples who stood out in this generation were sent out.

This was their first time participating in this trial so despite their talents, they still couldn’t make it through the first movement.

“What about that piece of trash? He ran away, right?” Someone thought about Li Qiye after calming down.

The others started looking around. In terms of cultivation, he was definitely at the bottom, if not the weakest. If these stronger participants have been sent out, so would he.

Unfortunately, he was nowhere to be found.

“Haha, he probably left already out of shame.” One disciple gloated.

“No, look, he’s still inside.” Someone saw Li Qiye still leaning on Qianyue, comfortably sleeping.

“???” The eliminated disciples found this impossible.

“How is he still in there?”

After all, they were far stronger yet still couldn’t resist the bells.

“Can’t you see? He’s deep asleep. That’s why he’s not affected by the bells.” One demon snorted.

“Yes, that’s why.” The others nodded in agreement.

“The bell melodies are part of the dao. Even a deaf person can hear it.” The protector guarding the gate interrupted.

This made the crowd exchange glances of confusion and doubts.

“Then why is he still there? Maybe he’s unconscious?” An older disciple didn’t accept it.

The protector glanced inside and shook his head: “No.” In fact, he was confused as well.

Li Qiye’s cultivation was definitely among the weakest in this batch but he still lasted longer than those stronger than him.

“Something is wrong, no way.” Another disciple said but couldn’t come up with a reason.

The protector didn’t say anything while agreeing with the sentiment.

Half of the participants have been removed after the first movement. Some were considered young geniuses.

On the other hand, some of the relatively weaker cultivators were still inside, successfully surviving the first movement.

This made the ones outside skeptical about the result.

“I’m stronger than them, why aren’t they eliminated?” One young genius wasn’t convinced.
