Chapter 4406: I Want It

There was no end to Peacock Monarch’s grand dao currently. He still had plenty of years left, unlike most ancestors. Their vitality weakened, hence an inability to improve their cultivation.

On the other hand, the young monarch still had plenty of room for improvement. There was a chance for him to reach the myriad or even the supreme level.

He would live longer than the three ancient demons and would assume this position later on. The sect master post was only temporary.

Because of these advantages, the upper echelon held him in high regard. He became virtually untouchable in Dragon.

Jian Qingzhu naturally understood this as well after listening to Ancient Pheasant.

“So we should leave my father be for now?” Qingzhu asked. She didn’t care about the political contest, only wanting to save her father and preserve his reputation.

“It’s not a pressing matter right now.” Ancient Pheasant said: “Taking him out is easy but it’ll escalate the situation.” He shook his head after saying this.

He then stared at Li Qiye and asked: “What should we do, Sir?”

“As I've said, I’ll just be killing whoever is in my way. I’m here with matters to take care of and don’t mind killing a few.” Li Qiye smiled.

Ancient Pheasant smiled wryly, not knowing what to say.

“The juniors were blind and have offended you. Could you forgive them?” He asked.

“It’s just a peacock. Just kill him, talents are useless if he’ll bring nothing but trouble to the sect.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Well…” Ancient Pheasant didn’t expect such a blunt response.

As an ancient ancestor, the demon didn’t agree with everything Peacock Monarch did. Nonetheless, he still considered Peacock to be a good seed and a pillar for the future.

However, Li Qiye was right. Pride and arrogance could be a source of downfall not only for Peacock but all of Dragon.

In this split moment, he also got the feeling that Li Qiye was unstoppable. They or any other behemoth had no chance of stopping him.

“A peacock has limited future. I like her more.” Li Qiye pointed at Jian Qingzhu. Just this one phrase alone has changed Qingzhu’s fate.

The demon started thinking. In terms of raw talent, Qingzhu was obviously inferior. However, she had gained the peerless phoenix bloodline. This might be enough to influence the current train of thought in Dragon.

“Kill him and let the girl take his spot.” Li Qiye concluded.

This nonchalant comment sounded as if he was talking about the weather. Alas, it prophesied a potential massacre and would change everything about Dragon.

Only those who understood his power would know that he was not messing around.

For the larger sects, changing the sect master was a monumental event. In Dragon’s case, it required the approval of numerous ancestors. The balance of power was rather delicate so such a thing wouldn’t be easy.

This didn’t stop Li Qiye from being decisive in changing Dragon’s future direction. It was either to obey or face destruction.

“We-we musn’t!” Ancient Pheasant became startled.

Killing Peacock would create an unfixable rift. Dragon would suffer serious losses, being unable to rise for a long period of time. Of course, this didn’t matter to Li Qiye.

“Young Noble, please don’t.” Qingzhu joined in. She had no ambition of wanting to replace Peacock; her only goal was to save her father.

Moreover, she didn’t want to embark on a path filled with bloodshed. One could say that becoming the sect master required stepping on the bones of fellow sect members.

“I’ve been rather patient with your sect’s internal problems. I’m only here to take what I want, no question.” He said.

“What do you want, Sir?” Ancient Pheasant asked.

“Outside of entering Tiger Pond’s secret area, I also want the thing left behind by your progenitor in Dragon Platform. Oh, and the palace as well." He revealed.

“...” Ancient Pheasant was at a loss for words.

Entering the secret area was acceptable. However, the legacy left behind by their progenitor was the ultimate treasure of Dragon. They would never share it with an outsider.

Furthermore, Li Qiye even brought up the palace. This was another unreasonable request. Such demands could be considered a declaration of war.

“I, I think this will be difficult.” He shook his head and smiled wryly.

“As I’ve said, I will not be negotiating.” Li Qiye responded, making his point clear. If Dragon were to refuse, he would kill his way in.

Either way, Dragon was about to suffer heavy losses.

“Young Noble, could you let the ancestors talk it out?” Qingzhu said.

“Yes, it pertains to the foundation of the sect, I alone can’t decide. Please give us time to deliberate, no need for violence.” Ancient Pheasant took a deep breath: “How about this, please go see the geezer from Tiger Pond with me so we can negotiate.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Sure, negotiate all you want.” Li Qiye chuckled.
