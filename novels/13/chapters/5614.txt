Chapter 5615: Boiled Crab

“Forget it, I’m not interested.” Li Qiye tossed the piece of crystal back to the crab.

“Bam!” The crab caught it and threw it back to Li Qiye, chirping louder than before.

“Don’t want to live anymore? Why are you asking for death?” Li Qiye asked.

The crab waved its claws, insisting on refinement.

“Fine, looks like you’re tired of living. Very well, what else can I say then? Just know that once I refine you, you will become a treasure and won’t be able to live as freely as you are now.” Li Qiye said.

The crab looked excited instead of afraid after hearing his agreement.

“Others won’t be able to refine you well, I suppose fate brought us together. I’ll start the cauldron.” Li Qiye sighed and raised his hand.

“Clank!” Supreme laws appeared and came together to form a cauldron of heaven and earth.

Alchemists would be shocked to see this. The cauldron brimmed with chaos true energy, causing space to be overfilled.

“Poof!” He activated the dao flame within. Although it didn’t seem particularly strong, it gave the impression of being able to burn everything.

This flame belonged to a true immortal. Just a single spark alone could reduce a continent down to lava, burning a path down to the core.

Space and time were being refined as well, becoming fuel for the dao flame. The yin became one with the yang due to the burning refinement. The reincarnation cycles broke down into the same essence.

He placed the crystal into the cauldron and the flame took this as provocation. It raged wildly with the highest profundity.

The crystal couldn’t handle its intensity despite being tough enough to withstand any imperial weapon. It was created from a Heaven’s Will fused with grand dao and bones. Thus, it contained an unimaginable power despite its small size, being more precious than most divine metals.

“Zzz…” The crystal gradually melted into a liquid form. 

A refinement process wielding the power of all affinities ensued, changing the liquid back into solid then back into liquid…

The innumerable repetitions allowed the crystal to integrate the forces of time, space, yin and yang, reincarnation, karma… A harmonious and natural perfection arose.

“Almost.” Li Qiye glanced at the crab standing on the coconut tree and said: “It’s not too late to change your mind. Just living and being free isn't so bad.”

“Whoosh!” However, the crab immediately jumped into the cauldron.

“Sigh, so many strange things are happening nowadays. A crab wanting to be boiled.” Li Qiye shook his head.

He activated the flame again to change the process. The refined crystal became resplendent with Heaven’s Wills rotating inside.

The power of the high heaven was awakened, albeit only in tiny strands. Nevertheless, the moment they emerged, an incredible force surged to the sky as if a new life was being formed.

“Rumble!” Black clouds appeared above, signaling a heavenly tribulation.

“Boom!” Lightning bolts descended like a storm toward the cauldron, illuminating the entire island. Mortals and other creatures were scared out of their mind.

The middle-aged man who was cooking stopped and stared at the tribulation. 

“To the fateful one it goes, that’s just how fate is.” He murmured.

The waves of bolts couldn’t destroy Li Qiye’s cauldron or the crystal within and ended up aiding the refinement process.

Once it dispersed, a shiny crystalline treasure finally exited the cauldron. It had the form of a crystal jellyfish, seemingly alive and breathing. Its inhalation and exhalation synchronized perfectly with the rhythm of heaven and earth.

While grasping it tightly, it felt like a shield with tentacles cascading downward as if they were fate decrees from the heavens.

“Perfect is not an exaggeration.” Li Qiye admired the one-of-a-kind treasure in his hand. The mortal world rarely saw something of this level.

It contained the power of the high heaven, serving as the strongest line of defense and making it unbreakable.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

No one would think that this was a treasure. Would a jellyfish be adequate as a shield?

“Have to name it.” Li Qiye gently rubbed it and murmured: “Crystalline Crab Bulwark of Indestructibility. After all, the villainous high heaven is just like a crab, domineering and arrogant yet unbreakable.” 

“Yes, this will do.” Li Qiye seemed satisfied with both the shield and the title.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a tsunami surged closer, on the verge of drowning out the whole island.

“Someone’s here.” The middle-aged man took note of this.
