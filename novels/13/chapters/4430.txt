Chapter 4431: Dao Obliteration

“Buzz.” Light flowed within the portal and caused spatial ripples, creating a pathway spanning billions of miles.

The crowd became emotional and exchanged glances.

“Is he going to run?” One expert said. This dimensional portal could take him from Dragon all the way back to Five-sun School.

The talisman capable of opening this long-range portal was indeed impressive and could be considered a top treasure.

However, the crowd didn’t focus on the talisman but rather, would the ex-sect master escape?

Though he had retired, he still represented his sect and his son. Running right now meant besmirching the reputation of both. In this case, others would always bring up this unsavory story when talking about Five-sun King.

Many cultivators would rather die in battle, lest they be known for their cowardice.

The ex-sect master naturally struggled with this as well. He would set a terrible example. His son’s supporters and fellow sect members might copy him and run during precarious situations.

Moreover, he came as an envoy of the east. This would destroy the alliance’s morale as well.

Thus, he gritted his teeth and crushed the talisman. “Pop!” The portal behind him immediately dispersed.

“What?” Many were surprised by his choice since he took the time to open the portal. They thought that he would escape since that’s the whole point of the talisman. Alas, he had changed his mind.

“Junior, we’ll see who will win!” He roared and released all of his energies and vitality.

“Rumble!” Seven halos emerged and rushed towards Li Qiye. The ex-sect master chose a reckless and direct strategy - using his halos to attack. They represented his seven grand dao empowered by his energy and vitality.

This was a move widely known as Grand Dao Obliteration - using one’s power without holding back in the slightest.

However, it also carried significant risks since the user’s grand dao could be damaged. Sovereigns have worked their whole life in order to reach this point. Having their halo damaged meant losing everything and becoming a cripple.

They have grown used to being dominating masters. Becoming weak was a fate worse than death.

Alas, the ex-sect master no longer cared about the consequences. He thought about taking Li Qiye down with him because escaping was not an option. The latter would ruin his son’s reputation and diminish morale.

After all, if Five-sun King’s own father would run in battle, why would anyone else risk their life for him?

“Rumble!” The seven grand dao came crashing down and destroyed numerous buildings nearby. Even spatial fabrics started disintegrating.

They destroyed everything in its path while encircling Li Qiye. The area turned dark as a result.

“Get back.” The three ancient demons warned their fellow sect members. They could tell that this ex-sect master might blow himself up to kill Li Qiye.

“Clank!” Li Qiye raised the saber horizontally in front of him and slowly pushed forward.

Everyone could see his action clearly this time, even the weakest cultivators present.

“Boom!” The incoming halos seemed to be hitting an invisible wall made of saber energy. It couldn’t move one inch forward, let alone touch Li Qiye.

“He stopped it!” The crowd's eyes widened in astonishment.

Li Qiye only pushed his saber forward yet he managed to stop a grand dao obliteration. No one would believe this without seeing it in person.

“Whoosh!” He then fully swung his saber. The slash cut through the halo as if they were blocks of tofu.

The size didn’t matter since they would be cut down eventually. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“He’ll be crippled at the very least!” An ancestor from the east shouted.

“Activate!” The ex-sect master didn’t seem to care. He became shrouded in a bloody radiance. His chaos energy and dao obliteration became red as well.
