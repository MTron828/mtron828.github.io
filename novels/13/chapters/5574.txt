Chapter 5575: Sorry, You’re Unqualified

Figures descended while Li Qiye was refining the throwing star within his world cauldron. Eyes were fixated on the weapon immediately.

These big shots couldn’t reach the abyss at first, unable to handle the gusts. However, the throwing star gave up and descending became safe. Thus, everyone jumped right in.

“The immortal weapon!” They shuddered after seeing it for the first time.

“Rumble!” The crowd grew larger with time.

The big shots had seen wonderful treasures before. Thus, they realized the weapon’s significance immediately.

“Dao Brother, this is an immortal weapon from the legends?” Someone stepped forward and asked Li Qiye. His sword energy flowed like a tsunami with his movement. This was before the activation of his power.

First, everyone felt a refreshing feeling as if they were bathing in a clear lake. However, there was a chilling intent hidden within the aura.

“Jadesword Conqueror.” Baifeng recognized him right away - the founder of Jadesword Pool.

Li Qiye didn’t bother answering and focused on controlling his dao flames to refine the weapon.

“Zzz…” The cracks started coming together again - something others might not notice at a glance.

“Dao Brother, could we take a look at the weapon?” Among the crowd were five old men; one of them asked.

Each looked like a god with an ancient aura, seemingly existing since antiquity. As they stood together, they formed a universe with a special aura capable of suppressing others.

“Five Elders.” Everyone recognized them - the founders of Timeworn Manor.

They were born as god and proved their dao before the calamity. All five survived along with their lineage. Although they rarely appeared, their manor supported The People.

Their appearance today showed just how tempting an “immortal” weapon was to cultivators.

Li Qiye didn’t respond either, causing the five elders to exchange glances.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Not to mention regular cultivators, even emperors and dao lords greeted them with respect. The same couldn’t be said about this ordinary fella.

Although they felt slighted, they only scowled and didn’t say anything else.

“This ultimate weapon belongs to the fateful and the virtuous.” Someone declared.

He was none other than Turmoil Conqueror who had healed up from the previous injuries. After all, Niu Fen had no intention of taking his life.

As a conqueror with untouched dao fruits, Turmoil healed his body in just a short time.

Nonetheless, his boldness surprised the crowd.

“Hahaha!” Niu Fen burst out in laughter and said: “Was the last beating not enough? Here you are again, running your mouth. Seems like I have to crush you again to make you realize the immensity of heaven and earth.”

The crowd recalled Turmoil’s pig-head appearance after the beating. That was truly humiliating.

Nevertheless, a conqueror such as himself possessed enough mental fortitude to still show up in public.

“I might be weaker than you but I can still speak the truth.” Turmoil still looked majestic.

“What truth?” Niu Fen smiled.

“A treasure of this level belongs to the virtuous.” Turmoil repeated.

“Okay, then do tell, what makes someone virtuous? Who is the most virtuous here?” Niu Fen entertained him.

The crowd exchanged glances but none dared to make the claim. Although they coveted the weapon, they still couldn’t shamelessly rob Li Qiye without just cause.

“Putting qualifications aside, everyone should have the privilege to take a look at this ultimate weapon.” Turmoil said.

“Right, we only want to take a look, that’s all.” A crowd member shouted.

“I’m sorry to say but none of you is qualified, only my young master. That’s why it is now time to return from whence you came. Otherwise, it’ll be a graveless death.” Niu Fen didn’t hold back, causing the crowd’s expression to sour.
