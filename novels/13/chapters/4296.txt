Chapter 4297: Reckless

“Sect Master, I am a friend, not an enemy. Watch your words.” Du Weiwu’s expression soured. He had no idea that death was already knocking on his door.

“Gotcha, I’ll keep that in mind. Will you do it yourself or do we have to?” Li Qiye smiled but didn’t change his mind.

“...” Weiwu grimaced, realizing that Li Qiye wasn’t playing around.

“If you do it yourself, I will go easy on you.” Li Qiye added.

“Enough! Don’t you know who I am?!” Weiwu lost his cool and bellowed.

“Don’t know, don’t care, but you’re definitely a nobody.” Li Qiye said: “I’m in a good mood today so I’ll toy with you.”

“Hahaha! I see, the puny Diamond Sect is so arrogant nowadays.” Weiwu’s rage made him burst out in uncontrollable laughter.

The five elders became irate right away. If it was a big shot saying it, then they would have no choice but to endure. However, it was Du Weiwu.

They had enough self-awareness to know how weak Little Diamond was. However, Du Weiwu was a nobody. It would be a different issue if it was his uncle from Dragon Sect.

He himself wasn’t qualified to stand before them and Li Qiye. Little Diamond was actually stronger than his clan.

He was just a junior speaking to elders and a sect master yet he dared to call them “puny”? This blatant disrespect was unforgivable. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Kill him.” Li Qiye nonchalantly ordered.

Weiwu staggered backward after hearing this and shouted: “My first uncle is the sect master of Eight Demons, my uncle-in-law is from Dragon!”

“Never heard of them.” Li Qiye gently picked his ear.

The elders naturally wanted to do this but had scruples. Eight Demons was relatively the same as them in terms of power so this was doable. Alas, Deer King could crush them with a single stomp.

Thus, they hesitated despite being livid at the arrogant youth.

“Sh-should we?” Elder Hu asked.

“Nothing more than insects.” Li Qiye replied.

They exchanged glances and found that Li Qiye never gave a damn about these cultivators, not even Deer King.

“Sect Master, I’m afraid people will speak ill of us if we kill a guest.” The first elder chose his words carefully: “But we also lose face if we let someone insult us without consequence. Let’s have a proper punishment, just take one of his arms.”

He came up with a compromise because killing the youth might really be poking the beehive.

“Good point.” Li Qiye smiled: “Sever one arm then.”

The elder stepped forward with a serious expression and said: “Young Master Du, you should do it yourself, it’ll be easier on everyone.”

“Do you know what you’re doing?!” Even a fool knew that he was in trouble at this moment.

“Cut off one arm and we’ll help you down the mountain.” The first elder said.

Weiwu’s expression became ugly while still retreating and shouting: “D-don’t be foolish! Know who my uncles are!”

“You’re the fool.” The first elder became impatient and shouted: “Let’s go!”

He wasn’t a top master but with his yin yang realm, he was more than Weiwu can handle. Just his aura alone intimidated the youth.

He only had the thought of escaping in his mind. He turned and immediately fled. A little character like him didn’t care about prestige and reputation.

Unfortunately, the first elder immediately blocked his path. He changed direction but the elder was still faster.

“Die!” He summoned a sword and thrust it towards the elder’s neck. It traveled like a poisonous snake but the elder easily swatted it away.

“Crack!” He broke the youth’s arm.

“Ahh!” The pain made Weiwu scream in agony.

“Leave now.” The first elder stopped and coldly uttered.

The pale youth was both furious and afraid. Nonetheless, he still bellowed: “You all, j-just wait! My uncles will definitely avenge me and, and flatten your sect!” With that, he ran for his life out of the sect.

“What a brat.” The fifth elder felt much better after seeing the youth being taught a lesson.

“This might be problematic though.” The first elder had a worried expression instead of being satisfied.

“Right, the brat is nothing, the same with the Du. The problem is Eight Demons.” The second elder worried as well.

“We can handle Eight Demons, I’m just afraid of interference from Deer King.” The first elder replied.

The elders exchanged glances. It was tragic being part of a weak sect. Destruction could happen whenever.

“Sect Master, what should we do?” The first elder saw Li Qiye’s indifferent attitude.

“Don’t pay no mind, this is trivial and will only serve as entertainment since I have free time.” Li Qiye casually responded.

“...” The elders had no response.

It seemed plausible for Li Qiye to look down on Eight Demons. However, underestimating Dragon Sect was rather ignorant and arrogant.

Recently, they had listened to Li Qiye’s dao lectures and knew that he was extremely capable. Nonetheless, this was a behemoth they were talking about.

“Dragon Sect is true to its name, a dragon soaring in the horizon, not an entity we can afford to provoke. We should exercise prudence, Sect Master.” The first elder warned.

“If they choose to be disobedient, I suppose I’ll be tearing out dragon tendons and drinking dragon blood.” Li Qiye said.

The elders smiled helplessly after hearing this. The sect master was beyond their control.
