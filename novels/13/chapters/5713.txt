Chapter 5714: Destroy Imperial Field, Eliminate The Sinners

“Boom!” A dark power engulfed the figure of Trinity Ancestor with the force of countless fiends. Spectators shuddered as a result.

The dark dragons melted time and space around the inborn chaos divine rings, eventually crushing them entirely. Fabrics of reality were turned into ashes and scattered down the islands.

The collapse of the divine rings left the figure vulnerable and dragged downward by the darkness, eventually disappearing.

Those without access to certain secrets would think that a dark power had suppressed the great being.

“Imperial Field hides the darkness, it wants to devour everything and must be destroyed first!” Members of Celestial Court shouted.

“Destroy Imperial Field and the sinners!” The soldiers chanted.

“March, take them down!” They became fanatical, ready to die for this noble goal.

The majority had no idea what was going on - they only saw the darkness swallowing the progenitor of Celestial Court and The Race. Thus, Imperial Field deserved death for this sacrilege.

They recalled the crusade that started during Immemorial Epoch War and found that massacring these sinners was not unreasonable in the present.

However, cultivators with actual information knew all the secrets behind this. Celestial Court’s upper echelon had been burying the truth until absolute domination.

“Rush forward!” The commanders and soldiers from Celestial Court believed that they were fighting for the noble goal of protecting The Race and this world.

They no longer feared the barrage of the formation regardless of how many men had been killed in front of them. The weight of responsibility coursed in their veins - destroying the darkness.

“Rumble!” The machine giant received enough energy vectors to finally seize the upper hand - pulling the arrow away from its chest. It felt as if the entire world was being pushed back.

“Boom!” It gained an unfathomable amount of power and crushed the silver arrow into pieces. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ugh...” This caused serious injuries to Demon and her allies.

Resolute and the others immediately suppressed the apex cultivators on the other side.

Meanwhile, the horn of death continued to blow, sending unending waves of spirits at Imperial Field.

“Merge again!” Demon ordered another pullback.

They had no other choice or their formation would crumble entirely. Reducing the area of effect became the best option - the only way to stop the enemies coming from all fronts.

Celestial Court’s main armies, the machine giant, and the specters destroyed all the abandoned islands, looking eager to take down the slaughtering formation.

“Surrender now before it is too late.” The giant’s voice could be heard by everyone: “Otherwise, everything will be reduced to ashes.”

“Keep spewing your bullshit, Celestial Court will fall before us.” Calamity Dao Lord laughed in response.

“Fine, have it your way. Don’t blame us for being ruthless then.” The giant responded and channeled its incredible power. Waves pulsed outward like tsunamis, making it clear how overwhelming it was.

“Wuu-” At the same time, the sound of the horn became louder and louder. More colossal monsters were summoned, heaving and shaking the entire ocean.

“Focus up!” Demon shouted.

Unfortunately, the formation kept on shrinking despite their best effort. Defenders became nervous because, without reinforcement, they wouldn’t last for much longer. This might spell the end of Imperial Field.

“How lively.” A leisurely voice could be heard.

Next came a “pop” in everyone’s ears and time came to a halt. A blink of an eye became as long as millions of years.

They saw their movements being delayed and infinitely slow. It became clear that someone had suppressed every single living being on the battlefield.

However, this suppression didn’t force them to the ground in a physical manner, only freezing their very core and leaving them breathless. An eerie feeling of insignificance and helplessness took over.
