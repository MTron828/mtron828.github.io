Chapter 5168: Immortal’s Peak

Li Qiye glanced at the peak and let out a sigh again.

“You don’t think there are immortals?” The girl saw his expression and asked.

“Do you?” He answered with a question.

“No, I don’t think so because there are no true immortal medicines.” She hesitated for a bit before answering. After a few seconds, she added: “Why did they wait for an immortal?”

From the records and tales back in her sect, she believed that her venerable ancestor was waiting for an immortal as well.

Her ancestor, Heavenly Sage Yuan, had met countless legends before. The mythical emperors and monarchs had sought her assistance with alchemy. Who could this immortal be, seemingly a level above them all?

“And you’re right about that.” Li Qiye said.

“...” She felt disappointed despite being right since she wanted to hear the opposite answer.

“Rumble!” Suddenly, an armored cavalry descended from above, led by a youth wearing an iron cap with a sharp and indomitable aura.

He was an Immortal Sovereign - a top genius.

“Saintess.” He bowed toward her and his men did the same, creating a wave of steel.

“Crimson Dragon Monarch!?” he then noticed a corpse and became alarmed. He rushed over and asked: “Saintess, are you hurt?”

“I’m fine.” She waved her hand.

The youth maintained caution due to the monarch’s death. He stared at Li Qiye in disbelief before asking with a serious tone: “Who may you be?”

“Crown Prince, mind your tone.” The saintess chastised.

The youth immediately bowed after hearing this: “Yes, Saintess.”

He was the crown prince of Iron Tree, the son of a dragon lord. Alas, his prestige couldn’t compare to hers.

Moreover, he had a crush on her as well but unfortunately, he had ample competition. Numerous behemoths were willing to have a marriage alliance with any member from Alchemy Dao. In this case, she was the successor.

“Young Noble, is it alright if I accompany you during your search?” The saintess bowed slightly toward Li Qiye.

Her polite manner annoyed the crown prince. Why would someone of her status - not inferior to a goddess - need to lower herself to accompany this man?

“No need.” Li Qiye refused and walked away.

“Take care, Young Noble. Please visit us at Imperial Attendant when you have time so that I can be a good host.” She said with sincerity.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Alas, he didn’t bother looking back or answering her.

She stared in his direction for a long while and this annoyed the crown prince even more. The goddess in his heart had never treated another man like this.

“How arrogant.” He murmured: “Saintess, that man disrespected Alchemy Dao and should be punished.”

She glanced at him and moved forward without responding. He didn’t get the message and followed her.

***

Li Qiye headed straight for the main peak. Although it was elusive for even dragon lords and conquerors, nothing could hinder Li Qiye’s path.

He easily solved the labyrinth consisting of ever-changing momentums. He made it to the base and looked up with a smile: “Not bad, using the world’s momentum so masterfully.” With that, the ascension commenced.

The peak had numerous mystical stones and towering trees. Green streams coursed down the sides. It was as if the spirit energy from the region all gathered here.

There were plenty of precious alchemy materials here - one-million-year-old blood ginseng, violet heavenly flowers, profound vermillion fruits… The plants here were virtually never seen anywhere else.

They were kings among kings, capable of traveling at immense speed. A few were stronger than conquerors or dragon lords.

As he climbed up, he felt auras comparable to that of emperors. The sheer pressure alone could drive someone directionless as if the world was spinning around. One would fall into another dimension and be completely lost.

Leaving the spatial labyrinth as fast as possible was imperative. The longer the stay, the higher the chance of being lost forever.

As for Li Qiye, he only needed a few steps to cross through the dimensions. The special formations couldn’t slow him down.

“Pop!” With a final step, he crossed through all the obstacles.

“Impressive.” He couldn’t help but praise.

He saw his destination - a garden surrounded by a clear stream. The rarest and most precious plants and flowers could be seen here. This included various types of king medicines.

Tiny heads quietly peeked out of the ground after noticing an intruder. Though they hid just as fast, their medicinal fragrances filled the garden.

They were clearly sentient and this garden served as their home.

“A perfect garden, no wonder why amazing plants can grow here. This is what I’ve been trying to find.” He nodded after analyzing the peerless garden.
