Chapter 4523: The Dongfang

Nonetheless, their criticism was warranted. Imperial secret laws were mighty but they weren’t superior to the best dao lord merit laws.

Even if this one was somehow special, it still couldn’t be exchanged for the key auction.

The cultivator said: “Our law is special not because of what it is but rather, its origin.”

“Are you saying that this law is from an immortal, not an emperor?” A few participants started laughing after hearing this.

The cultivator didn’t become embarrassed and earnestly answered: “Sounds about right.”

“Sounds about right?” The crowd stopped laughing and became serious.

They were only messing around earlier but this response changed everything.

“Impossible, immortals don’t exist.” An ancestor from an immemorial sect shook his head.

The cultivator calmly explained: “I’m not saying that our law came from an immortal but rather, a very particular existence.”

“Who?” The auctioneer showed signs of being interested as well.

The cultivator pondered in silence for a bit. He clearly hesitated before answering: “This is a taboo that few know about. Our clan is from an immemorial era and has ties with this being, hence our fortune.”

“Taboo? What taboo?” The big shots started thinking about it.

Suddenly, as they spoke and thought about this issue, a bolt seemingly coursed through their mind and made them shudder in unison.

“The one… that shouldn’t be spoken.” They eventually recalled a particular legend. They then shut up and realized that this cultivator might be talking about it.

“So the Dongfang has this history.” One of them murmured.

“Yes, how surprising since it’s an unremarkable clan.” Someone from a great lineage said: “This might be the reason why they’re still around.”

The auctioneer had a serious expression as he nodded: “This secret law’s origin is frightening indeed. However, it alone is not enough.”

He paused for a bit then added: “If your clan adds another item, then it’ll be considered.”

“Wha is itt?” The cultivator became surprised.

The auctioneer revealed a smile akin to a greedy merchant staring at gold. He said: “I heard that your clan has a decree personally written by that existence. How about adding it?”

“No.” The cultivator refused right away.

“Then that’s the end of it.” The auctioneer waved his hand in regret.

“What decree are they talking about?” A crowd member became interested.

After all, this auctioneer was the best in Grotto Courtyard and had seen countless treasures before. He was clearly interested in this particular decree.

The value of the amber was obvious at this point yet the Dongfang still refused to bid their decree? This was a testament to the latter’s worth.

They thought that this might be related to the forbidden existence. Of course, the auctioneer and the Dongfang member stopped talking about it. The conversation stopped there.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Alright, any other bids?” The auctioneer changed the subject. His eyes shifted towards Li Qiye.

Alas, Li Qiye only focused on the girl within the amber and didn’t hear anyone else. She commanded his full attention for some unknown reason.

Jian Ming and the daoist knew that the girl was his reason for being here. The amber itself didn’t matter.

“True Immortal offers a secret art of Blessed Dao Lord, a dao lord weapon, and an immemorial heavenly portal.” Alchemy Child made an offer representing the entire sect this time, not just his master.

“Three Thousand Dao offers three dao lord merit laws, three bottles of divine ascension pills, six boxes of goldmend powder…” Cloudgrasp Elder also made a bid.

Three Thousand Dao was just as capable as True Immortal. After these two behemoths made their bid, the other big shots felt as if they were no longer in the running.

The bid from Alchemy Child was not bad at all because Blessed Dao Lord was special. These might not be the dao lord’s best merit law and weapon. Nonetheless, they should still be superior to most. It seemed that True Immortal also coveted this final auction.

“Our school offers an art for indestructibility and another for communicating with heaven and earth.” A member of a mysterious sect also made an interesting offer.

“We offer an ancient stone…”

Everyone bid differently, one by one. Quantitative appraisals were exceedingly difficult for these treasures.

A few of them were added to the list by the auctioneer. For example, the behemoths. The auction house was interested but not overly motivated to make a sale just yet.

“I want this.” Suddenly, Li Qiye stopped looking at the girl and interrupted the bids.

Everyone immediately stopped and he became the center of attention.
