Chapter 4214: So Strong

Sparks and flames continued to ravage the sky for a long while. Space itself was being melted.

Once they dispersed, clouds and winds returned but there was still an indelible scar. His attack managed to leave serious damages to the spatial fabrics.

Ancestors might not have been able to stop that attack, let alone younger cultivators.

“That’s why Peace Ocean Sword King is the number one genius.” A youth praised.

“Then what the hell do we call Li Qiye?” His friend retorted.

No one dared to question Peace Ocean’s prowess since he had a superb mastery of the sword dao. He didn’t need a sword and could use heaven and earth as a replacement instead.

This made it difficult to classify Li Qiye. The king’s hand wave resulted in a dao. What about Li Qiye’s actions?

The latter lacked a supreme style. To be perfectly frank, his movements looked basic and unrefined.

When judging purely on technique and merit law, Li Qiye would earn disdain and spurn from the spectators.

However, they managed to stop Peace Ocean and Void’s attack. This couldn’t be attributed to luck.

“Sorcerer?” One expert said.

Most found this word inadequate since Li Qiye’s results deserved higher praise.

“He’s definitely not just a young master with money.” Another commented.

“Heaven’s favorite?” One more added.

“I like the one used before, son of miracles, we can also use existence or king instead of son…” An expert chimed in.

All in all, everyone had a hard time coming up with a suitable description for Li Qiye. Most names revolved around the character “miracle” since it was the best match.

Meanwhile, Peace Ocean and Void had a serious expression. They were knowledgeable enough to at least know how terrible Li Qiye was.

This guy wasn’t only a new rich nor did he need to use money to kill. He was a hidden master.

“Sir, where are you from, who is your master?” Peace Ocean took a deep breath and solemnly asked.

Both decided to exercise more caution when dealing with this foe.

“From where I should, and I’m the master.” Li Qiye chuckled.

This non-answer only added to the confusion. This guy was shrouded in fog. The first answer was understandable; he had the right to hide his origin.

Alas, it was harder to evade the question about one’s sect. Cultivators revered their sect and origin, especially their master. Li Qiye’s answer seemed rather disrespectful and unacceptable. An exception would be if he was a vagabond and didn’t have a sect or a master.

The duo didn’t think that this was likely. After all, someone with his attainment should have a master. This applied to vagabonds as well; someone must have taught them.

The problem was that Li Qiye’s movements didn’t give any clue about his background. Both were knowledgeable enough. They wouldn’t dare to say that they knew every single art in the world.

However, they could definitely notice clues from most techniques. This wasn’t the case here.

In reality, they weren’t the only ones thinking about Li Qiye’s background.

“Hmm, a dao lord's lineage or is he the descendant of an ancient emperor?” One of them asked.

It was clear that he didn’t come from Sea Emperor or Nine-wheel. As for sects such as Sword Temple and Virtuous School? Their relationship wasn’t close enough.

“Maybe it’s Cloud Dream Lake?” Someone thought about the reception Li Qiye eventually got at the lake.

“I don’t think so, his methods have nothing to do with Cloud Dream Lake.” An erudite ancestor pondered for a bit before shaking his head.

Since the duo was lost in thoughts, Li Qiye broke the silence and said: “Alright, that’s enough warming up, it’s time to play for real now.”

The duo exchanged glances and took a deep breath.

“I don’t care what sect you’re from. What you’re doing is awfully unwise. Only death awaits you even if you get through us.” Void maintained a strong attitude.

The duo was fully aware of Li Qiye’s power but they couldn’t back down as rulers regardless of the circumstances.

“Even the arrival of another overlord can’t change the tides.” Peace Ocean added: “Leave and we’ll drop this issue. Refrain from being suicidal.”

Some listeners noticed something. Someone speculated: “Is Vastsea Paragon here too?”

“Sounds like it.” His friend became emotional.

This meant that both Vastsea Paragon and Earthraiser Vajra were present. Thus, Everlasting Sword God alone wouldn’t be able to change anything.

That’s why even if Li Qiye was strong enough to defeat the two prodigies, he would still be killed by the two overlords later. No one in the world could take them on.

Moreover, they also thought that Peace Ocean was being quite generous and polite to let Li Qiye go on top of erasing their previous feud. It showed a little weakness and fear on his part.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Too late to leave when I’m here already. Plus, Myriad Era already has a master. It does not belong to you.” Li Qiye said.

“So domineering.” People couldn’t believe how Li Qiye was keeping this up when Peace Ocean had just revealed their second ace card - Vastsea Paragon.
