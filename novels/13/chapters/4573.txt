Chapter 4574: The End Of The Grand Dao

These steps were the path toward reincarnation, severing all ties with the previous life. The moment these corpses touched the stair, they seemed to be returning to life.

Previously, they showed no sign of emotion when others tried to rob them of their treasures. After all, they were truly dead with no soul and true fate. Their divine intents have also dispersed long ago.

Now, they seemed to be awakening from a deep slumber. Everlasting Monarch, Pioneer Ancestor, Fromheaven Stone God… these beings turned their head back toward Eight Desolaces - the place where they grew up and made their marks.

“Farewell, Ancestor.” Outside of the bridge were disciples from the various sects. They prostrated respectfully.

Not all came to rob the corpses. Some simply came to see their ancestors for the last time.

Even experts of no relations bowed their head in reverence. These corpses were legendary figures who have done magnificent feats. They served as role models for future generations.

The corpses looked back and recalled their experiences. Glints flashed in their eyes along with various emotions.

Whether it be the heroic figures or heinous villains, they felt many things - sentimental, helplessness, unwillingness, determination, love…

They clearly made waves during their lifetime and left behind lasting tales. Now, all of this was going to disappear from their lives. After a successful reincarnation, they wouldn’t remember anything - not their descendants and their successes.

In the end, the gaze disappeared one by one. This was their last time looking back at their world. They turned around with determination and continued to walk forward.

Meanwhile, the maelstrom grew smaller until it was no longer there. The images within also disappeared.

“Boom!” An explosion wiped away everything, leaving behind a vast expanse with floating temporal foams.

Spectators also pondered the transpired event. The older cultivators were especially emotional.

“The end of that path is reincarnation?” A renowned big shot murmured in a daze.

No one had an answer. They chose cultivation in order to reach a greater realm for the sake of living longer. The ultimate goal was everlasting life.

However, even a mighty being such as Everlasting Monarch still failed in the end. This was already miraculous.

Was everlasting life impossible? This was the question in the ancestors’ mind. Some of them had enough power and ample resources. Of course, this didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

So was the end of the path reincarnation? Everlasting life was impossible, hence the need to travel to the Yin Wheel.

Maybe this would be another hopeful opportunity, another way to prolong their life or to enter a new path altogether.

“What is beyond that bridge?” An old yet powerful big shot wondered.

Nothing was better than being alive. This included living in terrible circumstances. There existed a yearning to the point of it being an obsession for the world.

On the other hand, the path toward reincarnation required severing all ties with the previous life. What would be the point? They would no longer be themselves.

“After enough years, all love and attachments will be gone.” One amazing ancestor sighed and said.

Sure, the crowd thought that reincarnation might not be different from death since one would lose all memories and ties. However, those who have lived long enough would eventually become distant anyway.

Their lovers and friends would have died long ago. Eventually, their descendants and bloodline would also disappear. All karmic ties connecting to the world would be gone. Therefore, there was nothing holding them back. Reincarnation was clearly the best route.

“Let’s go home.” A big shot sighed and told his juniors. This was too much to think about right now.

“We’re going back.” Others started leaving as well. This experience forced them to ponder their life.

“Reincarnation, hmm…” Wise Ancestor was the same way. He wondered about his future path when the time comes.

“Young Noble, are we heading back?” He regained his wits and asked.

“Yes.” Li Qiye smiled leisurely and said.

“Is it alright if I follow you, Young Noble? I will be at your beck and call.” Si Jingru asked.

Outsiders would be astounded if they were to hear this. Their lower jaw would drop to the ground.
