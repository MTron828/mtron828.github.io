Li Qiye was breaking down from Shihua’s inhale. His tiny, broken off fragments headed straight for the bloody jaw.

Everyone gasped after seeing this. Even Li Qiye couldn’t withstand this force, just how monstrous was it?

“Is this a defeat?” A spectator became startled.

“Hard to say, but this move is indeed insane. No name and no variation, but everyone has a temporal affinity belonging to themselves. People might think that Li Qiye’s physical body was being devoured, but no, just his time and lifespan. When Shihua takes all of them away, Li Qiye will truly die from old age.” An ancestor said.

Another one added with a grave tone: “It is unavoidable. Unless one could resist this force, their lifespan would be sucked in by Shihua, then they would rot into dust.”

It didn’t take long before Li Qiye’s body almost dispersed completely, inch by inch at a time, a return to being dust.

Shaochen and Shihua were ecstatic. Though Li Qiye’s merit laws and techniques were unmatched, how many people could actually avoid their time from passing by? Nothing could stop the flow of time.

“Li, you’re finished!” Shaochen laughed wildly.

“Pop!” Strands of light interrupted the deterioration with an explosion. Each fiber of light was dazzling and pure. Time seemed to be washing by like a flood; billions and billions of years.

This shocking scene astonished the crowd, akin to playing with a precious stone, cutting off one layer by one layer and thought that it was worthless. However, the final cut revealed a green light - the coming of a supreme gem. Or, digging down a mine to find nothing for so long, but at the final scoop, a treasure light shot into the sky. The real treasure was hidden all the way below. This was the type of joyous emotion everyone felt right now.

“Boom!” These temporal rays headed straight for Shihua and Shaochen due to the absorbing force.

These rays contained so many years. Their coming forced the radiance inside the bloody mouth explode. At the same time, Shihua was growing old at a rapid rate.

He couldn’t withstand the sheer quantity of years. If he could swallow a lake of time, then what Li Qiye gave him was an ocean of stars, able to instantly annihilate him.

Mu Shaochen fell prey as well. He screamed and lost more than one thousand years of life; his hair instantly turned gray. Shihua’s body started to have numerous cracks before turning into specks of dust altogether.

“Senior Martial God!” Shaochen had no choice but to shout for help.

“Boom!” A sparkling divine wall landed from above and stopped the temporal rays.

“Buzz.” This wall couldn’t handle it either and instantly collapsed just like the rest.

In this split second, a figure came to save both Shihua and Shaochen.

Everyone saw that it was Dracoform Martial God, taking the two back to a floating palace.

The two were thrown to the ground, rolling backward before standing back up. Shihua couldn’t be any older, seemingly breathing one last breath. Shaochen, the good-looking youth, was now a decrepit old man.

This all happened in the blink of an eye to the astonishment of the crowd. Li Qiye had washed away their remaining lifespan, something even worse than just directly killing them.

All eyes were on Li Qiye, seemingly the source of time. His body condensed together and the light disappeared. He appeared again, standing there as if he didn’t even lift a finger earlier.

This was indeed the case. He didn’t need to do much and could still easily defeat Wang Shihua.

“Toying with time against me? No different from an ant trying to go against a mountain.” Li Qiye chuckled.

Shihua didn’t dare to utter a single word; his face paled and stricken with terror. He has never seen someone who possessed such a long period of time. The guy seemed to have eternal life.

His proud temporal technique couldn’t stop Li Qiye at all. It was indeed the same as an ant trying to swallow a mountain - simply impossible.

This move had swallowed an Eternal on the same level as him before without any difficulty. But this devouring force was useless even when Li Qiye only stood there. Those temporal rays buried and made short work of him.

The crowd realized once more the disparity between Li Qiye and his opponents. They couldn’t help wondering about Dracoform Martial God. He was the only one with any chance of beating Li Qiye in Myriad Lineage.

Alas, they speculated that he couldn’t stop Li Qiye without external interference. They wondered about his mastery of the system’s dao source. If he didn’t have full control, then it would be helpless.

Strangely enough, everyone wanted him to be strong enough or the outcome of this fight would be too obvious. Li Qiye would prove his supremacy over the land.

“Looks like you are courting death too.” Li Qiye smiled at Dracoform.

Everyone watched quietly, not surprised by Li Qiye’s comment at all. Anyone else would sound ridiculous for speaking like this towards the number one expert of Myriad, but it felt just right coming from Fiercest.

Dracoform Martial God replied: “Sir, you are overly imperious, today is a joyous occasion for our Vermillion Martial Court...”

“No.” Li Qiye swiftly interrupted and shook his head: “Not a joyous occasion. Today was supposed to be just another day, but unfortunately, all of you have turned it into a funeral!”

Having said that, he glanced over at Shihua and Shaochen: “No one can stop me from killing, it’s just that I wasn’t in a rush before. Since you want to interfere, very well. Everyone calls you the number one of Myriad, well, I have time to exercise, it has been a while and my bones are about to rust.”

Everyone smiled wryly again at his aggressive and domineering style. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“You are so sure of victory?” Dracoform’s eyes narrowed as he stared at Li Qiye.

Li Qiye smiled: “No, it’s not even a contest, no need to think about the odds or victory. Killing all of you is dependent on a single whim of mine. Do you bother thinking whether you can win against an ant? No, only whether you want to stomp it or not!”
