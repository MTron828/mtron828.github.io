Chapter 5529: A Bit Worried

“Let’s talk.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Father said that there aren’t many auspicious days left, we need to pick one soon.” She leaned against his shoulder.

“Does he agree to the conditions?” He asked.

“Lil’ Bro, you’re making it difficult with those impossible demands. We can negotiate and you can choose something else or start discounting stuff. Keep in mind that what I bring as a dowry is not insignificant.” She said.

“He can only choose me.” He said.

“Because we’re a match made in heaven.” She said coyly while stealing glances at him.

“That’s up for debate, but I know exactly what I want from him.” He responded.

“But Lil’ Bro, you’re someone with land already.” She said.

“So what? Does he want to come plow it before it’s ready? I suppose I don’t mind even if he does. He set the rules and he can feel free to break them.” He said.

“I understand the reasoning but I know his personality. Don’t worry, he will not act irresponsibly before the crops are ready, don’t you agree?” She said.

“I actually wish for him to break some rules, things would be easier to handle then.” He smiled.

“Lil’ Bro, don’t judge a gentleman’s heart with a faulty scale. My father is not that kind of person.” She pulled his arm and pressed closer to him.

“Sure, but there’s no other choice given the chaotic situation when everyone is untethered and fearless. Rules don’t bind us any longer.” He responded.

“You’re different, your heart is still warm and beating, no one can compare to you. If we pick you, even the worst outcome can’t be that bad.” She said.

“I do agree with that.” He nodded: “There is a limit to the worst outcome, the same can’t be said about the others. At the very least, I won’t eat him.”

“Lil’ Bro, let’s not ruin the mood by being so vulgar.” She complained.

“Fine, let’s get to business if we are here with sincerity.” He said.

“I knew you would agree.” She said happily: “This must be due to love.”

He smiled and ignored her comment: “This land, let it grow, and when the time is right, it shall reach heaven.”

“Well…” She hesitated.

“Hesitating even about this?” He said.

“It’s not a problem if you want to grow, I sympathize with your concern, the same for Father. If you want to come up, there will be the most fertile land for you.” Her brows furrowed.

“And then what?” He said.

“The connection is more tricky.” She said softly: “We understand your current power but there will be other issues afterward.”

“That’s your problem. You want to negotiate, not me. Plus, I am not a greedy person and know when to stop.” He said.

“Hmm…” She frowned again.

“You don’t trust me?” He asked.

“Of course we do.” She held onto his arm tighter: “I wouldn’t be here right now if we didn’t trust you. And plus, once we get married, what mine is yours and what yours is mine.” She said.

“Let’s make it clear right now, nothing like that will be happening.” He said.

“You’re so harsh, you don’t think husband and wife should share prosperity together?” She complained.

“These conversations and bonds will be forgotten the moment I make my way there.” He said.

“No way, we will be family then.” She said.

“If that’s the case, I can ask for a few things, right?” He smiled.

“As long as it is within my power.” She said charmingly.

“Don’t worry, nothing precious, just a few words.” He smiled.

Her expression changed sharply as she fell into silence.

“Ah, so not everything is negotiable. This seems like a dead end.” He said.

“Lil’ Bro, you know that this is no joking matter.” She said: “If you want those words, you’ll have to do it yourself and there are problems with that. I’m sure you don’t want to deal with the fallouts.” She said.

“So in the end, I’ll still have to make a trip myself.” He said.

“We welcome your arrival, it’ll be the same as coming home.” She brushed her finger across his chest.

“I’m sure chances are I won’t be leaving afterward.” He said.

“Lil’ Bro, don’t be instigating, that’s not manly at all.” She pouted.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Not like it hasn’t happened before. I am merely stating the possibility.” He said.

“Are you worried about Father or me? Or maybe you think the village’s brute might kidnap me?” She said.

“I wouldn't mind seeing that at all, won’t be a big deal to me.” He smirked.

“How heartless!” She stomped the carriage and left considerable damage.

“The pits have been dug, who knows what will happen during the descent? A burial or a successful sweep?” He said.

“So you do worry about us.” She was more satisfied with this line.

“Putting semantics of the correct relationship aside, I do worry about your big sister.” He stroked his chin and said.

“Hmph, I knew it, men always seek something new, now you’re into my sister. Don’t you care about me at all?” She protested.

“What’s there for you to be concerned about? It’s not like you’re going into battle. I’ll be the one having problems if they succeed.” He said.

“Hehe, I bet you don’t actually think that way, just don’t want to admit that you worry about me.” She said: “Rest assured, we have our means during our descends, we’ll sweep all the troublemakers and pests, and none shall be spared.”

“I hope so, but there is no perfect plan. Some fish will manage to escape the net.” He said.

“You can take care of those who escape the net.” She said.

“If I have to do that, my demands are rather reasonable. Perhaps a change of terms is necessary.” He smiled.

“No need for that, family members need not be so stingy with each other.” She said coquettishly.

“I suppose negotiation is not necessary for this since it’ll happen anyway.” He said.
