Chapter 5114: Something’s Amiss

“Not like this…” The members of The People became speechless. All of their hope was placed on Li Qiye since without him, they had nothing to contend against The Race with.

They actually thought that he would be able to win against the four conquerors. Alas, Blazing Conqueror’s special ace card was too much to take.

Reincarnation had never used it before. Its Timewatcher Conqueror never resorted, perhaps out of inability. Today, Greenmountain utilized it to refine Li Qiye into a symbol, shocking all spectators in the process.

People realized that they had underestimated Blazing Conqueror. They only remembered his wealth, not his actual power.

With Li Qiye gone, who would be able to stop the conquerors now?

“We shall unite the world!” The big shots from The Race jubilated and saw their ambition coming to fruition.

“So this is the power from an immemorial epoch.” Six-pot Conqueror said with admiration: “Imagine wielding all the armaments in that divine treasury.”

Some crowd members believed that an ant with this treasury would have been unstoppable as well.

“Fellow Daoist Greenmountain, why didn’t you empower yourself?” Vessel Conqueror asked.

They were focused on taking down Li Qiye and didn’t notice anything at that moment. However, she thought that something was amiss.

On the other hand, the crowd members had no problem with it because they saw Greenmountain Conqueror channeling the symbol with all of his might. Activating that divine treasury allowed them to win. Thus, some thought that her question was unnecessary.

However, the other conquerors felt the same way.

“Fellow Daoist, what is going on?” Six-pot felt something ominous.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Greenmountain smiled and said: “It’s nothing, I’ve just been waiting so long for everyone to come, now I can finally pull the net back. It hasn’t been easy slumbering all these years.”

“What are you saying?!” Ascension shouted.

Meanwhile, the crowd became lost at this development.

“No! Greenmountain didn’t descend!” Thousand-faced Sovereign was the first to react and sent a message to top cultivators.

“What?!” They were startled after hearing this.

Everyone saw four conquerors descending - Greenmountain was the first to arrive.

“He’s been down here all this time.” Other ancient ancestors understood. Greenmountain only put up an act while waiting for the others to come.

The other three thought that Greenmountain had already gotten started with Li Qiye. Eventually, this led to the duel in the Mountain of the Ages.

Greenmountain managed to trick everyone since he hasn’t been around for a long time. They all thought that he had ascended. The newly-arrived conquerors assumed that Greenmountain was on their side against Li Qiye.

In reality, Greenmountain was the one who destroyed Swordgrasp and forced Conceal to light the communication beacons.

Now, they were smart enough to immediately understand the situation - that this was a trap. No wonder why Greenmountain was so eager to start a fight with Li Qiye instead of giving him a chance to explain himself.

“Go!” Vessel roared and activated her power.

“Crack!” Cracks showed up on the golden armors.

Six-pot and Ascension Conqueror did the same thing, wanting to break out of the plates.

“It’s too late, fish can’t escape the net once trapped.” Greenmountain laughed after seeing this.

“Boom!” Having said that, he took out a round treasure brimming with temporal rays, looking like the wheel of time.

He threw it up into the air, embedding it into the center of the golden maelstrom. This was a perfect fit.

This meant that the wheel was a part of the divine treasury, perhaps the very core. It’s just that he didn’t choose to reveal it earlier.
