Chapter 5552: Deities Of Cleansing

Baifeng and Guo Cheng couldn’t believe what they were hearing - how could he plan to burn down an entire city?

“All of West Bank, no big deal to exterminate them all.” Someone broke the silence. Who else could this be but Li Qiye?

The members of West Bank glared murderously at him upon hearing this.

“What did you say? I dare you to repeat.” Wang Chong said menacingly.

“Haha, dogs don’t know when to stop barking nowadays.” Niu Fen pulled up his sleeves and smiled: “Young Master, how do you want him done? Marinated or salted?”

Wang Chong was furious; his murderous intent billowed toward the duo. Unfortunately for him, he didn’t notice anything due to Niu Fen’s concealing technique.

“Ignorant fools, I will make examples out of you two today!” Wang Chong’s aura seemed like a million swords all pointing at Li Qiye and Niu Fen.

“Enough, Wang Chong.” Baifeng stood in his way.

“Miss Qin, the wise thing to do now is to take care of yourself first.” He glared at her and said, changing his address from “Fairy Qin” to “Miss Qin”.

The disparity between the two of them was insurmountable. Treasures and weapons weren’t enough to cover the gap.

Normally, a four-fruit dragon lord would address a six-fruit dragon lord as “Dao Brother”. Even “Fellow Daoist” could be viewed as an insult. In this case, calling her “Miss Qin” was indicative of his confidence. His clan was the strongest in Dao Domain so he feared her not. He reminded her of their background and for her to be smart.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Her expression darkened as two rays flew out from her eyes.

“Wang Chong, your clan has no power here. Watch your words or you won’t be leaving this place alive.” She channeled her energy and directly warned him.

This wasn’t an empty threat since her sword energies were ready to massacre everyone from West Bank.

“Miss Qin, you are the one who needs to mind your words.” Wang Chong didn’t expect such a strong reaction from her. He had a hard time withstanding her pressure, let alone his men.

“And?” She coldly uttered: “West Bank has no right to act wantonly in Momentous Frontier. If you insist on causing trouble, you should ask yourself first whether anyone from your clan can save you from my blade at this moment.”

Logic told him that she wouldn’t dare to do anything. Alas, it seemed that she was willing to go all out and kill him. The fame of his clan alone wouldn’t save him in this situation.

“Haha, I see…” He laughed from being too angry. The problem was that she had the upper hand in terms of cultivation.

“I will remember this, Miss Qin. We shall meet again.” He snorted before leaving with his men.

He endured this humiliation for now. His clan just needed to send more powerful dragon lords next time and with time, they would be able to capture all of Momentous Frontier.

Guo Cheng had a terrible feeling about this. A fight between dragon lords could accidentally wipe out weaker cultivators and mortals. Millions of mortals could die from a single uncontained explosion.

Once Wang Chong was gone, he heaved a sigh of relief and said: “Please take a look, Fairy and Immortals.”

Once they were inside Scholar Tree, they found that the streets were abandoned. It gave off the vibe of being a haunted city; no visitors would want to linger.

“Could you elaborate on the situation?” Baifeng noticed mortals secretly peeking out from the doors and windows.

Their complexion was terrible - as pale as can be with a black curse on their forehead.

“Only a few were infected at the start, now the entire city is like this. They are just sick with so many illnesses.” Guo Cheng said.

A sovereign could become the greatest doctor in history for mortals. Anything was healable even without needing alchemy. Just chaos true energy could remove any ailment.

“I tried using chaos true energy to heal them but it was completely useless.” Alas, it didn’t work for Guo Cheng.

“Did anything strange happen before this?” Baifeng asked.

“The Deities of Cleansing stopped protecting us, the medicine horse disappeared as well.” He said.

“The medicine horse went missing?” Baifeng’s expression darkened: “Young Noble, what now?”

“To the temple first.” Li Qiye glanced around before suggesting.

Guo Cheng led the way and brought them to the main temple of the city. Despite the current desolate state of the city, some mortals still dragged their afflicted selves out of bed and came to pray.

This temple belonged to the Deities of Cleansing. The two were responsible for warding off diseases and illnesses.

The mortals of the region enjoyed a wonderful life, virtually free from any serious complications outside of aging. Although the temple was still here along with the statues, the mysterious plague ravaged the city and its inhabitants, teaching them the meaning of despair.
