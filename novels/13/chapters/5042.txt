Chapter 5043: The Dao Of Assassination

“That was his dao avatar.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Really?” The youths stared at Nightwalker in disbelief.

Nightwalker was the king of assassins, rumored to be a human from an assassin organization. In reality, he was one of the six commanding gods of Demon.

“I knew it.” Goldcrest said. He had suspected this back at Golden Cicada Palace when the assassin was saved by the dark fog.

He didn’t say anything back then due to a lack of evidence. He would become the enemy of an entire branch for besmirching their leader. All of Phoenix might be destroyed as a result.

“I apologize for the lack of reception.” Nightwalker bowed slightly at the group.

“I wish to take a look.” Li Qiye said.

“Please follow me, Young Noble. But I have to tell you first that you might be disappointed. There is nothing left of our branch outside of some treasures that you probably don’t care for.”

“Keep your assassination tools, I want to see your founder god’s place.” Li Qiye said.

“Very well.” Nightwalker led the way.

They traveled through a path hidden by fog. As they looked down, it felt as if they were walking in space.

“Your founder god isn’t here.” Li Qiye sensed the area and said.

“Nothing can hide from your eyes, Young Noble.” Nightwalker sighed and said: “Everyone believes that only Demon Conqueror can leave the Ten Great Mountains but our founder god can leave as well. It makes Mist rather special since subsequent commanding gods inherit two different legacies, one in the open and one in secrecy. Normally, the next god is always chosen ahead of time.”

“Who is your founder god, why so mysterious?” Ming Shi was curious. It seemed that the creator of Mist was not inferior to the majestic Demon Conqueror at all.

“We don’t know either.” Nightwalker shook his head.

Their founder god didn’t leave anything behind so the subsequent commanding gods didn’t even know of their progenitor’s title or name.

“Really?” Yunyun was surprised.

“It’s the same for your Primal Lineage.” Li Qiye chuckled.

She had no response because this was indeed the case.

Eventually, they made it to their destination and saw numerous trees reaching the clouds. A wooden house could be seen on each of the trees. All the doors were shut tight.

Ever since the group got here, they felt that they were being observed by something. Occasionally, they sensed someone running in the back and turned around - only to see nothing.

Goldcrest was at the dragon lord level so he knew that this was real. They were just too slow to spot anything.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Your lineage is still going strong.” Li Qiye said while looking at the trees.

“It will keep on going as long as Mist is around.” Nightwalker said.

Li Qiye chuckled and shook his head: “Times are always changing. During special moments, a new lineage is created for a particular reason, perhaps a noble goal. Today, your lineage is only meant to train assassins for money, there is no goal or mission to speak of. It has lost its once majestic inspiration. There is no need to keep it going, it is fine to just be a regular sect of Demon.”

“Well…” Nightwalker was surprised to hear this: “Isn’t it still better to keep it going?”

“Hard to say. Living in the shadow is already a form of torture, not to mention that it is only for money, how meaningless. All the other sects and lineages are brilliant in some way on top of getting to enjoy the sun, the same can’t be said for yours. Your members are nothing but murderous tools trapped in the darkness, lacking a mission capable of illuminating your lives.” Li Qiye responded.

“I understand your point, Young Noble.” Nightwalker thought about it for a bit before bowing.
