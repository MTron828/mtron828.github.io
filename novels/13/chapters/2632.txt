“Boom!” Everything seemed insignificant compared to his vitality and power, akin to adding salt to the ocean.

“Boom!” This naturally frightened the spectators, rendering them helpless on the ground.

“Pop!” The four Eternals’ flames obviously couldn’t keep up with this rapid increase and became chaotic.

“Ah!” The flames engulfed their own masters, extracting their vitality and grand dao.

Their true blood, in particular, acted like the greatest feast for the flames so the heat became insane. The flames instantly incinerated the four Eternals into ashes scattering away to the wind.

Their eyes were wide open before death, full of unwillingness and despair. They have never thought about the potential of a backlash.

His monstrous vitality moved on to assault and extinguished the flames. He then recalled this power and the world assumed its initial appearance.

Everything became soundless like the calm after total destruction. All beings have been destroyed; only ruins were left - that kind of silence.

Even the strongest masters here were speechless including Puresword True Emperor and Venerable Deer Merchant. They finally felt fear.

“How boring.” Li Qiye broke the silence with another yawn: “What a waste of my vitality. Where is this daoist? Maybe he’ll be more entertaining.”

Lu Weijun himself no longer dared to retort just like the rest of the crowd.

“Alright, time to kill, let’s start with you.” Li Qiye’s eyes fixated on the youth.

He started walking closer, causing the shocked Weijun to hastily retreat.

Meanwhile, the final and strongest Eternal next to him had no choice but to face Li Qiye in order to buy time for the youth.

“Sir, please be benevolent.” The Eternal seriously said: “Opposing my master isn’t wise.”

“Trying to scare me with one Everlasting? Scram.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“My apology!” This Eternal roared, shackled by obligation and debts. He swung his heavy scepter straight for Li Qiye’s chest.

“Boom!” Li Qiye blocked with one hand, completely nonchalant. Though this scepter had immense weight, it couldn’t move Li Qiye’s hand at all.

He flipped his hand and pushed the scepter back towards the Eternal. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No!” The guy could only scream. His bones started breaking down from the force exerted by his own weapon.

“Pop!” Only a bloody mist was left.

“Clank.” Li Qiye threw the scepter away without bothering to look while heading straight for Weijun.

“Heavenly Monarch, save me!” Weijun ran to his closest ally, the Adamantine Tree.

“Sir, you’re truly going too far!” The monarch on top of the tree shouted.

He needed to answer the cry for help due to his ties with the Lu Clan.

“Too far?” Li Qiye smiled: “I’m going to kill all of you, wait till I’m almost done and you can say that again.”

He created a gigantic palm in the sky that reaches for the tree. It didn’t contain any divinity or invincible laws but that didn’t matter at all.

“Boom!” The tree turned into a mountain of blades. All of its branches and leaves turned into various weapons - swords, sabers, spears, arrows...

“Boom!” They became resplendent and shot straight for Li Qiye’s palm.

This was an impressive move but wasn’t enough. His palm became bright as well, turning into an all-destroying grinder.

“Crack! Crack!” All of the leaves and branches crumbled, leaving only behind the barren trunk.

Li Qiye then grabbed the trunk and uprooted the tree entirely.

“Die!” The heavenly monarch descended and roared, unleashing his full arsenal of weapons.

The sky turned dark from the incoming treasures - a suppressive pagoda, an all-penetrating immortal sword, a banner sealing all directions...

He wanted to use his strongest technique to catch Li Qiye off guard and deliver a fatal blow.

“Move.” Li Qiye’s great palm swung the tree into the treasures, crushing all of them.

The great trunk barely brushed against the monarch but it ended up with him screaming. Blood gushed out as he was blown away with numerous broken bones.

He instantly got up and didn’t care about his wounds; the only thing on his mind was running for the Mu’s camp.

“Don’t think about escaping.” Li Qiye smiled and smashed the tree towards the fleeing combatant.

The monarch had never thought that this treasure tree would come for his life one day.

“Go, Brother Sha!” Puresword True Emperor joined the fray. His great palm grabbed the monarch and pulled him towards safety.

“We’ll see about that.” Li Qiye sneered and turned the tree towards the emperor’s palm instead.

The emperor’s expression soured as he unleashed chaos from his palm. Imperial laws emerged and built a thick world around his palm. This allowed him to continue saving the monarch.

“Bam!” The chaos and imperial laws shattered. The tree smashed into the palm and left it bloodied. The emperor had no choice but to pull back.

The spectators knew that this was a serious injury. His hand was most likely mangled as a result.

The tree continued to break the wind and head for the monarch.

“Ah!” A long and sharp branch suddenly sprouted from the tree and penetrated the monarch’s chest in a brutal manner.
