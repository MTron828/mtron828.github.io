“Young Lord Bai! You’re so handsome!” The roars of his fan pushed the atmosphere to the next level. Saintesses and princesses screamed at the top of their lungs. Others waved at him or posed suggestively.

Bai Jianchan’s popularity reached its apex, adored by the entire crowd. Two emotions ran rampant - adoration and envy.

The latter was eventually won over after actually seeing Jianchan’s temperament and style. He was indeed superior and overshadowed the rest. He was clearly the undisputed king of the north, the lover in all the girls’ dreams.

Jianchan stood at the bottom of Sacred Spirit Hall and politely gestured for everyone to quiet down.

The screaming girls immediately stopped; their eyes completely fixated on him as if wanting to imprint his image into their mind. This might be their only chance to be this close to him.

Everyone watched with bated breath, waiting to see his next move. What visual phenomena would come during his ascend? Could he receive the blessings of the golem sages?

Jianchan bowed towards the platform to show the highest respect towards the sages. This naturally won him a favorable impression from the golems watching.

After the rite, he tidied his clothes and began the climb. Each step was exactly identical to the previous. It seemed as if he had meticulously measured each lift up and put down.

His footsteps weren’t loud but everyone clearly heard it in their heart instead of their ears, akin to him leaving behind two lines of perfect footprints in there.

This culminated in a unique and extraordinary rhythm. The grand dao seemed to be harmonizing with him.

“It’s so pleasant.” Those who didn’t know about the dao aspect still found it to be special.

The fangirls were absolutely fascinated by him to the point of being obsessed. They had no way of escaping his charisma.

“He’s checking the hall.” An ancestor could tell what was going on.

The crowd remained patient during the climb, feeling excited. Eventually, Bai Jianchan made it to the top.

“He did it!” Eyes were wide open in disbelief. All focused up in order to not miss a single detail.

“He’s amazing!” One princess shouted. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Some girls remained nervous because they were afraid that he might not get anything from there. That would be quite a blow to his fans. Some covered their mouth, as tense as can be.

“Buzz.” The unique sky above lit up and poured light down onto him. He became the main character on the stage - brilliant and watched by all.

“Success! Young Lord Bai is really a supreme man, even the golem sages are recognizing his peerless talents.” One saintess happily applauded.

“Yes, it doesn’t even matter that he’s an outsider.” Another noble daughter added.

This only confirmed his excellence and made the girls like him even more.

One influential beauty among them gestured for everyone to quiet down lest they disturb Jianchan and the sages. The girls hurriedly obeyed.

“His future potential has no limits.” Many were in awe to see him engulfed in the light. Those who were jealous of him recognized his greatness.

“Boom!” A blast quaked the area with enough force to frighten the crowd.

A door up in the sky seemed to be opening. Next came a torrent of divinity just like a waterfall, ready to drown the world. The light intensified; the sages seemed to be returning.

“The show is about to start.” An ancestor who had seen this process before knew that it wouldn’t be so simple.

“It’s not just a recognition, Jianchan might get more.” A high elder added.

Just being recognized by the sages was already amazing enough. Plus, he was an outsider. Now, he was about to earn a fortune, living up to his reputation as the number one genius of the north.

“I told you Young Lord Bai can do anything!” The girls fell more and more in love with him after seeing the proof of his talents.

“Boom!” The door began to open, affecting the grand dao in the process. A barrier on the other side seemed to be collapsing.

A massive figure emerged and loomed over the planes. A majestic divinity poured down like an unstoppable storm, demanding others to submit.

It turned out to be a stone dragon; its scales had a blue glow and were extremely sharp. It carried a primordial aura as well, clearly coming from the distant past.

The weaker cultivators couldn’t handle the pressure and dropped down on their knees.

“A sage of the golem, rumored to have a true dragon bloodline. He turned into a dragon for his atavism.” A knowledgeable golem ancestor revealed. The others in the audience had no idea, not even ancestor-level characters.

This sage was born during the chaotic era with a thin true dragon bloodline. He was unbeatable and led the golems during the exploration of Eight Desolaces.
