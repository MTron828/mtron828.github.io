Chapter 5913: Apologies Regarding My Ignorant Disciple

After the rain came a rainbow - a smooth path for Li Qiye with the tribulations gone.

Each step of his crossed through time and space. Immortal flowers blossomed beneath him and majestic hymns could be heard for eternity.

The end of the path also resembled the end of the dao - a place beyond the high heaven. Immortal energy could be felt throughout.

A towering cliff awaited Li Qiye, seemingly the last area to cross before reaching an immortal paradise.

Surprisingly enough, the pinnacle had a table made from the most precious heavenly jade. Rubbing the surface was akin to rubbing the sky. It contained the mysteries of the high heaven.

Just one glance of this material could benefit emperors for a lifetime. Learning the dao of the high heaven made one supreme.

A celestial furnace was prepared for warming wine, cast from feathered immortal metal. It possessed a unique anima flame that burned time itself.

The wine was just as exceptional - something unseen in the mortal world. It was brewed from the essence of time and stars with an infusion of dao essences, prepared for Li Qiye alone.

He smiled after seeing this and sat down in front of the table without being cautious. A letter was left behind which read - apologies regarding my ignorant disciple, Sir. [1]

The few words contained dao mysteries - a hint to an immortal dao. If anyone in the mortal world had the privilege of seeing these characters, they could become the strongest of their era.

This letter was of the highest grade and would be worshipped by a sect forever. It could be derived into numerous merit laws.

Its perfection invoked admiration. Others would think the limit of the dao was encompassed within the characters. It contained sincerity and could subdue the highest of animosity and grievances.

Li Qiye smiled and brushed it briefly; the letter dispersed into particles and was extinguished.

The cauldron automatically filled a cup for him to enjoy, which he did in one gulp. Temporal and celestial lights erupted the moment it entered his stomach. It made him feel as if he was floating in a paradise, fully satisfied.

Mortals and gods alike could forget their worries and enjoy the moment. One could pick this wine over becoming an immortal.

“The best. Another.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh, raising his cup.

The cauldron poured one more for him. The aroma of the wine permeated the area, turning pebbles into demons. As time passed, they could turn into stone ancestors. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

If one drop were to descend upon the mortal world, it could allow one lucky mortal to surpass the limits. Most importantly, it represented a sincere apology to Li Qiye.

He drank the whole cup and said: “This pot of wine, worthy of him being given one sword.” [2]

Time swirled around him, unable to capture the beauty of the wine whether it be within a split second or ages. It wrapped around him like the softest and warmest blanket.

He closed his eyes and fell asleep, seemingly entering a sweet dream. His mood would improve after sound sleep and everything could become less difficult.

He opened his eyes and accepted the apology. He yawned and stretched with a smile afterward.

“It seems like you have put a lot of thought into this for your disciple. I won’t drink your wine for nothing.” He spoke. [3]

“It’s truly wonderful.” He yawned again and said: “This wine has no equal, unavailable to both mortals and gods alike.”

He was no stranger to good wine but none was on this level. The brewing process took countless efforts even for that person - a true display of sincerity.

“Very well, I accept. I will spare him this time but as for the next, no mercy.” He stood upright and felt very comfortable, feeling benevolent and generous at this moment.

Perhaps no one could hear him but it was enough - Li Qiye accepted the apology after receiving the letter and wine, coming to an implicit understanding with the other party.

Only one person throughout the ages could have done this to win Li Qiye’s apology acceptance. Of course, this person was also the only one who read the situation perfectly.

This was a silent contest between two immortal-like beings stretching across time and space.

1. The noun is unclear so it could be the disciple apologizing or the master. If I have to pick, it would be the master apologizing ☜

2. The meaning is unclear again. It could mean several things - giving a sword literally or worthy of Li Qiye using one sword technique against the unknown him here. Since it’s an apology and he seems to like it, the actual meaning is hard to grasp, so I’m leaving it as literal as can be so that it can be construed in several ways. ☜

3. So it was the master apologizing with this context. I’ll leave the prior note up for a little insight into choices for ED. It can get tricky due to two things - call back to characters from thousands of chapters ago and the vague narrative the author uses to reveal the lore ☜
