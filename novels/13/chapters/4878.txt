Chapter 4879: Immortal Gate’s Riders

“Buzz.” The three colors of the monument started to flow toward the largest statue, eventually condensing at its feet.

This resulted in a pulsing trichromatic portal made from ancient dao laws. Each individual strand could seal heaven and earth or even an immortal. Their presence made it impossible for even the strongest cultivator to enter or leave.

Inside was an eternal prison with no possibility of escaping. Firerage shuddered and didn’t dare to approach. The laws frightened him to the core. This feeling must be what an insect felt while being trapped in a spiderweb.

“This is…” He remained cautious.

“A portal leading to the resources of Immortal Gate.” Li Qiye walked over and said: “Wait for me here.”

“Your Highness, how can I protect you if there’s anything dangerous?” Firerage hurriedly protested.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“If there’s danger, you can’t protect me anyway. Wait here while I go get something.” Li Qiye responded.

Firerage felt helpless because he was terrified by the portal and the unknown destination.

Li Qiye touched the portal. Initially, the dao laws acted like thorns to stop him but he had its dao essence and overridden its resistance.

He didn’t need to activate his divinity or aura, still looking as normal as before. Alas, the process nearly made Firerage drop to his knees.

This was an absolute suppression. He could tell that it came from Li Qiye but he didn’t even activate his power. 

As he was still in a daze, Li Qiye walked into the portal and through the laws. They could no longer stop his steps as he disappeared from sight.

Firerage stood there, overwhelmed. That intangible aura earlier was absolutely horrifying and made him wonder about Li Qiye’s true identity.

He naturally knew by this point that Li Qiye was not an ordinary cultivator. This was someone famous. In fact, he didn’t feel the same level of dread while being around Eight-stallion Dao Lord. It became apparent that passing the throne down to Li Qiye was the dao lord’s wisest decision.

***

A void with stars and lighting flashes awaited Li Qiye. Strangely enough, there was a floating arena as well. It had a circular shape and looked like the temple of the kings and gods.

Li Qiye stood at the fringe and observed the arena. If anyone else was here, they would be trembling with fear.

There were countless corpses in the arena. Their appearance was hidden by armor from top to bottom.

The plates were golden once but with that, they have rusted into a grayer shape, or perhaps they have been burned before. 

The helmets were decorated with two axe-shaped wings, looking rather imposing. Alas, something had pierced the chest plate in spite of its toughness. This was most likely the fatal blow delivered by an immensely sharp claw.

“Immortal Gate’s riders.” Li Qiye commented on this famous legion that had dominated the thirteen continents once.

Few in number but they made it up with personal prowess. They helped Immortal Gate rule the world; their contribution couldn’t be overstated.

They no longer appeared after the destruction of Immortal Gate. The world didn’t know that they have fallen inside their own sect, trying their best to protect something.

His attention turned toward the sky - one occupied by a floating cocoon covered in dust. It seemed to have noticed his arrival and gradually opened up.

It turned out to be a giant dragon with a gray shade; the cocoon shape was due to its closed wings. It had four heads but one had been decapitated.

Wounds and scars could be seen everywhere. The sky-blotting wings had numerous holes but in the end, it was the lucky survivor.

It embraced a huge brazier with immemorial runes. It once represented the pinnacle.
