Qing Shi had a calm expression despite being the center of attention.

“I thought Ancestral and Yin Yang have a marriage pact? Why would a disciple from Ancestral fight against Yin Yang right now?” Someone quietly said.

Most had this question in their mind. In theory, these disciples of these two sects shouldn’t have any conflict. Even by chance, it would only be a minor squabble.

In this case, they could see clear animosity from Qing Shi. He purposely wanted to antagonize Yin Yang.

Moreover, he was too powerful to be a regular disciple from Ancestral and should have high status there. This made people wonder.

The big shots, in particular, thought that this marriage didn’t seem to be going that well.

“Perhaps the problems are bigger than we thought.” A few knowledgeable ancestors talked among themselves.

“Who is he in Ancestral City?” People speculated regarding the top geniuses of Ancestral, wanting to pair Qing Shi with one.

The princess stared at Qing Shi and calmly said: “I know that there are only a few disciples in Ancestral that have trained Cosmic Shifter to this level. As for Butterfly Dance, even rarer, only the dragons and phoenixes. Now, to master them? Only one person as far as I know.”

Wu Zhongtian’s expression became serious as well; his eyes profound.

“If I’m not mistaken, you’re Pearlstone Saintess.” She finally concluded, seemingly not surprised.

“What?! Pearlstone Saintess?” Everyone stared at Qing Shi in disbelief.

“How, how can that guy be the saintess?” A youth blurted out.

The older big shots and ancestors took it more seriously. They were aware of the serious implication if the princess was proven correct. It might lead to a break between Yin Yang and Ancestral.

The first prince of Skylight and Firmaments Godchild became startled as well. This “Qing Shi” and the saintess were as different as can be.

However, they thought that this was plausible because who else among the young generation could take on the two of them together? Who else could have mastered these skills?

“I don’t believe it.” The answer seemed obvious yet doubters still remained because Pearlstone Saintess was one of the three beauties of the north. This Qing Shi in front of them looked as ordinary as can be.

“People always praise Skylight Princess’ vision and insight, looks like I have experienced that today.” Qing Shi smiled, unperturbed.

“You’re too kind, Sister Shi.” The princess slightly bowed like a noble daughter. People couldn’t help liking her.

“Buzz.” Qing Shi became resplendent and flowers rained down - a visual phenomenon akin to a fairy arriving. Lotus also bloomed beneath her feet, resulting in an ocean of flowers.

A sweet fragrance tantalized the mind as Qing Shi changed into a supreme beauty.

She was tall and thin, about a whole head taller than Skylight Princess. Her jet black hair looked like a waterfall. Her figure resembled the perfect jade sculpture. Her long legs accentuated her tall frame, causing people to look up. Nonetheless, this didn’t diminish her grace and charm.

Her oval face had perfect lines and natural curves. All in all, her features were beyond compare. There was no doubt that her beauty was superior to Skylight Princess.

“So beautiful.” People stared in bewilderment. They were in awe after seeing Skylight Princess but the saintess took it to the next level.

Her identity became clear at this point since people recognized her - Pearlstone Saintess. They didn’t dare to loudly state her title lest she would be bothered.

Qing Shi was indeed the saintess. She used a heaven-defying method to change into an ordinary man.

“She lives up to her fame.” One spectator said.

Some would actually be saying that the saintess was the number one of the three if Skylight Princess wasn’t present. Nonetheless, her presence made a comparison possible.

The godchild and the first prince exchanged glances after seeing this.

“Bai Jianchan has two of the three beauties, so lucky.” A spectator mumbled loud enough for only him to hear.

The engagements were well-known and caused plenty of envy and jealousy. Of course, they didn’t dare to express this.

“Young Lord Bai is a dragon among men.” One fan said with admiration.

Meanwhile, Shi Wawa was slack-jawed. The guy he has been staying with turned out to be a peerless beauty, a princess of Ancestral City.

“This shrouding technique is incredible.” A few ancestors focused on something else. Some of them used their heavenly gaze prior but still didn’t notice anything. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The only one not caring about this situation was Li Qiye. The commotion didn’t disturb him. Of course, he saw through it from the very beginning.

“You’ve seen through my disguise, Princess.” Pearlstone Saintess revealed an enchanting smile. Her full name was Shi Qingjian.

“I didn’t see through it, Sister Shi. It was only a guess that turned out to be right.” The princess shook her head. She was aware of the merit laws from the big sects in the north. This made it possible for her to guess saintess’ true identity.
