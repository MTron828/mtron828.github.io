Chapter 5682: Do It

The being didn’t respond.

“So you have no plan at all, just going to be trapped in this skeleton forever?” Li Qiye continued.

“You will get nothing from me, do what you want, start the refinement process already.” The being said.

“Interesting. A chance for rebirth is right before you but you prefer to let the soul be corrupted and trapped inside your own body. Even if I am merciful enough to spare you from the refinement, you’ll still be imprisoned here forever.” Li Qiye said.

“This is my choice, I’ve been Trinity Ancestor for too long so why not be a dark being for a while? This might be a more comfortable form of existence with more possibilities.” The being said.

Li Qiye chuckled and remarked while shaking his head: “Oh Trinity Ancestor, Trinity Ancestor. No, I should call you Trinity True-self now.”

“Trinity True-self, do you think I’m a gullible child who will believe that you’re content in staying here? You didn’t have an opportunity previously but I have brought your head and blood here. As if you would abandon this chance.” Li Qiye said.

“Feel free to take the head and blood away, I am willing to stay here until everything is destroyed. Perhaps the next time I come out, you, the Dark Crow, will have turned to ashes.” The being said. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Sigh, this lazy style doesn’t suit you.” Li Qiye seemed amused.

“I prefer to stay here forever rather than become Trinity Ancestor again, so give up.” The being said.

“I’m just curious about your actual plan, to give up such a great opportunity means that you have something better in mind.” Li Qiye said.

“Do tell me about this better opportunity.” The being uttered coldly.

“You can’t leave without reviving, so if I don’t refine you, what can you be waiting for? For your treasured disciple to come save you?” Li Qiye mused: “No, even if he can somehow make it here, he won’t be able to save you. You’re the only one who can do so given your current state, even I can’t save you.”

“Just wait until the end of the world.” The being said.

“Seems like we both don’t believe each other.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Feel free to guess my plan then, perhaps you will see the answer if you live long enough.” The being said.

“So ultimately, you just refuse to return to being Trinity Ancestor.” Li Qiye said.

“That rebirth spells the doom of me, so it’s entirely meaningless. Even if I were selfless enough to sacrifice myself, Trinity Ancestor won’t live long either.” The being stared at Li Qiye: “The Dark Crow would not let him live after he is no longer useful.”

“That’s something you would do, not I.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Dark Crow, we both know that you do not tolerate my existence. The only reason why I’m still alive is because I’m useful to your plan.” The being said: “All of my options and forms will lead to death, so why would I willingly become your pawn?”

“Sigh, it seems we can’t come to an understanding. I come with good intentions but your prejudice persists.” Li Qiye lamented.

“It’s fine, I have accepted my outcome, being refined into a weapon whether I am me or Trinity Ancestor.” The being seemed to have come to terms with his situation.

“What’s with the lack of confidence? Maybe you will be able to kill me after shifting back to the radiant Trinity Ancestor.” Li Qiye said.

“You can talk until you’re hoarse but I won’t comply with your wish. I will never resurrect so go ahead and refine me.” The being said.

“It looks like if I don’t refine you, I’ll be doing a disservice to your intelligence.” Li Qiye smiled.

The being closed his eyes, seemingly ready for the refinement process. However, time passed by and nothing happened.

He opened his eyes and saw Li Qiye standing there.

“I’m serious, I’m not here to take advantage of you or refine you. Trinity Ancestor was an epoch creator, an unparalleled figure worthy of admiration. There are countless reasons for him to walk in this world again.” Li Qiye said earnestly.

“Hmph.” The being didn’t buy it.

“I can see that you have made your choice. I’m leaving this here.” Li Qiye placed the skull on top of the skeleton.

“The blood is here too, you can take it whenever you want.” Li Qiye picked up the blood on the ground and placed it on the ribcage.

“There we go, it’s not difficult at all now, you can resurrect whenever you want and leave this place as Trinity Ancestor.” Li Qiye prepared everything.

“Still not giving up?” The being said.

“I don’t care anymore, I’ve done what I needed to do, now it’s your problem.” Li Qiye clapped to clean his hands and said.

He tapped on the skeleton and said: “Goodbye, old friend, if you ever come back to life, this gateway is right here.”

Having said that, he left without looking at the dark being again.

The latter stared at the drop of blood and skull in silence. Eventually, he seeped into the ground and returned to deep slumber, preferring imprisonment over rebirth.
