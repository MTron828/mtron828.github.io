Chapter 4612: Ancient Ruins

Once the overgrowths were cleaned up, an ancient dao platform appeared before everyone.

It was flat on the ground and expanded outward, looking like the base of a gigantic palace. It was initially made with pave stones but many have been lost or damaged at this point.

“Click! Click! Click!” Li Qiye sat down and gently tapped on one of the stones. The sounds seemed to be coming from the past.

The others also carefully observed the dao platform. They noticed that the stones varied in size. When they tried to pick one up, the stone was as heavy as a block of gold. Runes were noticeable; they weren’t carved but already existed at the very start.

They were surprised because they have never seen these runes before, let alone ones formed by nature. It had a terra affinity, one that should exist deep underground.

“How strange, I’ve never seen anything like it.” The daoist concluded.

“It came from the depth of the ocean and never saw the sun before. Extremely rare but unfortunately, not very useful for most.” Li Qiye said.

“So only useful for that special race.” Paramount Scion understood the implication.

Li Qiye didn’t answer and stared at the dao platform to say: “This is indeed a historical record of their race. Alas, there might be myriad of dao but none can last forever.”

The group has gotten a better perspective on the ephemerality of life after this encounter.

“It’s right here.” Xiao Xuan regained her wits and said.

“The thing is buried here? Are we digging it out now?” Jian Ming’s eyes instantly lit up.

Everyone became excited since it pertained an ancient race. Few had the privilege of experiencing a forgotten part of history. Moreover, something left behind by this ancient race should be unfathomable.

Jian Ming knew that due to the circumstances of Xiao Xuan’s return, any memory making it through the process must be extremely significant. The treasure should have a proportional value.

Xiao Xuan didn’t waste time and walked to the center of the dao platform. She tilted her head and rested her chin on her hand, seemingly a bit confused.

Her fingers and hands started moving instinctively - slowly and deliberately as well while forming mudras and controlling runes. She started chanting an ancient language not from the present time.

She herself didn’t know that she was doing this. It seemed to be automatic the moment she set foot on the dao platform. There was no need for her to think.

“Buzz.” A timeworn radiance pulsed around her. Its source seemed to be a forgotten part from the river of time.

Virtually imperceptible rays shined the ground and started taking up roots, starting a resonation. The ground lit up as well and released its own rays to illuminate the stones. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This made it possible for the runes to leave the surface of the stones. They floated up in the air and received Xiao Xuan’s light.

Her light and the runes combined together and became one. A seeding process started in the air. The group felt as if massive trees were about to manifest into reality.

“Pop!” A force suddenly overwhelmed them and created violent quakes. Something from the ground wanted to come out.

“It’s coming!” The daoist shouted.

The soil and dirt beneath the dao platform loosened while the group watched with bated breath.

“Boom!” Finally, the thing finally drilled upward and showed itself.

They saw that it was a large rectangular boulder almost resembling a house with a single room. The entire thing was black like onyx, clearly hard and unbreakable.

There were also strange runes but this time around, they were carved and not naturally formed. In the center was a particularly large rune in the form of a maelstrom. It seemed capable of sucking everything in the world inside.

Xiao Xuan waved her hand and her floating runes immediately flew toward the boulder. Instead of injuring the boulder, they were instantly absorbed.

A supreme chapter was opened as a result and those nearby heard the hymns. It wasn’t long but had a comforting effect, similar to listening to an old and happy fairytale.

The carved runes also resonated and lit up, especially the maelstrom-shaped one.

“Are we supposed to lift this boulder up and study it?” Jian Ming asked, unable to notice anything.

“This is it.” Xiao Xuan told Li Qiye.

“I don’t think we can carry it, it seems to have taken roots underground.” Jian Ming said.

“Of course we aren’t carrying it back. Go take a look.” Li Qiye smiled and nodded at Xiao Xuan.

She took a deep breath and felt rather tense. After all, she didn’t know what awaited her in this place.

“Buzz.” The moment she got closer, her body suddenly turned into countless particles.

While the group felt astounded by this development, the maelstrom came back to life and rotated with great speed. It sucked into the particles that used to be Xiao Xuan.

“Buzz.” Once all the particles were taken in, the boulder became less bright than before, albeit still glowing slightly.
