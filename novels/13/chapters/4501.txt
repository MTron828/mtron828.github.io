Chapter 4502: Qualification?

The guards’ expression soured after hearing the blatant contempt. This was more offensive than anything Alchemy Child had done thus far.

Though Grotto Courtyard wasn’t a traditional sect, its power was obvious since it has been around for eras now.

Moreover, Seal Ancestor was a renowned cultivator in all of Eight Desolaces who had all the advantages while being in the grotto. Seal didn’t need to personally greet someone like Skybreak Monarch, let alone anyone else.

Therefore, Jian Ming’s demand seemed outrageous, akin to kicking the grotto’s prestige in the face.

Though the grotto focused on business and didn’t care for trivial conflicts, this went beyond that. Some guards glared aggressively at him and would have attacked if it wasn’t for their creed.

“Brothers from the grotto, don’t let this ignorant fool run his mouth like he owns the place, make mincemeat out of them and feed them to the turtles!”

“Sounds like someone wants to be slapped again.” Jian Ming glanced at the youth, acting rampant as if he was not afraid of the grotto and True Immortal.

“...” The youth’s face became unsightly. He couldn’t respond because he didn’t have an ancestor protecting him. Otherwise, he would have cut off Jian Ming’s head.

“Sir, you are out of line!” An annoyed guard remained relatively calm.

“Out of line? The truth can often be harsh but it is your grotto’s honor to have our young noble here. If he didn’t remember your ancestors, he wouldn’t give a second look here. The reception should have been your sect kneeling for three hundred miles.” Jian Ming said flatly.

“Enough.” Wise Ancestor said because this brat was becoming crazier and crazier.

Li Qiye only smiled and the daoist refrained from speaking.

This eventually captured the attention of everyone in the hall. They seemed amused to watch because Jian Ming looked like a country bumpkin unaware of the actual world.

In reality, he was the only one acting correctly in this place given Li Qiye’s status. If the grotto were to know the truth about Li Qiye, they would indeed line up and kneel for three hundred miles. This would still be the case if their two saints were still around.

The two saints’ life goal was to met Li Qiye again. Furthermore, they knew that it would be an ultimate fortune.

Jian Ming was actually trying to remind the grotto of this, albeit in a blatant manner. It was up to the grotto whether they could take advantage of this or otherwise.

“Sir, please don’t break our rules.” The guards appeared to be losing their patience and readied themselves for a fight. They had dealt with top masters before and had never been afraid of anyone.

Suddenly, a sweaty old man ran into the hall and immediately bowed toward Li Qiye: “Esteemed guest, it is an honor to have you here at our humble abode. Our disciples were frogs under the well and didn’t recognize you, please, come inside.”

This old man had a high position in the grotto. The guards immediately bowed and let Li Qiye’s group through.

“Now that’s more like it.” Jian Ming commented: “Remember, it is the highest honor to be in the young noble’s presence. One word of his can topple your grotto and then he can take whatever treasure he wants.”

Both the guards and the guests found this comment to be outrageous. The grotto has lasted so long in history and wasn’t easily bullied. Jian Ming was clearly underestimating them.

Alas, Li Qiye could actually do whatever he wanted here. If he desired a treasure, he could just take it from them. However, since he had ties with their ancestors, he chose to follow the rules instead. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“It is our honor indeed.” The old man didn’t seem angry at all.

“Alright, we’ve wasted enough time.” Li Qiye nodded and entered the portal with the rest right after him.

Once all the guests have entered, the guards from the grotto were confused and agitated. One of them quietly asked the old man: “Ancestor, why were we so subservient? That brat basically rode on our head and then took a dump. Since when have we been such cowards?”

They had done countless transactions with the behemoths before. Why did they need to bow down to this average cultivator?

The old man shook his head and elaborated: “Untrue. That little fella’s words were harsh but he was actually trying to help us. It is a warning to not miss this godsend opportunity.”

“Trying to help us?” The guards remained confused.

They thought that they were utterly humiliated. They exercised ample restraint in order to not beat down Jian Ming.

“Who is the guest then? He must be a big shot to warrant your reverence, Ancestor. Which sect is he from?” One of them asked. All were curious about Li Qiye’s true identity.

“Do not inquire on this matter.” The old man solemnly said: “This is beyond your station right now. Just serve and satisfy all of the guest’s demands.”

“We understand.” The disciples obeyed despite lacking information about the mysterious guest.
