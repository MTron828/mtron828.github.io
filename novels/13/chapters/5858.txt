Chapter 5858: We Will Never Appear In Your Epoch Again

The enormous serpent felt insulted after having reigned and devoured an epoch. For example, the five overlords of Trinity trod carefully around him.

“There are no personal problems between us, forget today and we will never appear in your epoch again.” Epoch’s End suggested earnestly.

“Sure, no personal problems, not even when you wanted to eat me because I’m fat and fertile.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“That was our mistake, please do not hold it against us.” Epoch’s End spoke humbly unlike a supreme overlord.

Voracious snorted and was disdainful of his attitude. He had devoured six epochs yet didn’t have the same courage as Voracious when dealing with this junior.

“If I have to choose, I believe Voracious more than you.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s rather presumptuous of you since we have never met before. I am a man of my word.” Epoch’s End was taken aback.

“We have never met but I know you. Voracious is absolutely a monster, but you, you are the most despicable of them all.” Li Qiye said.

“You do not know who I am. Let’s not spew nonsense now.” Epoch’s End didn’t buy it.

Voracious couldn’t help but glance at Epoch’s End and then Li Qiye. This “friend” of his was mysterious. Not even the epochs devoured by him were known at this point but Li Qiye seemed to have more information.

“You have no problem claiming to be a devourer of six epochs but never talk about when you hid like a coward and trembled with fear.” Li Qiye said.

“Never happened before.” Epoch’s End said.

“Recall the distant time of Crimsonheaven, you snuck a few bites after they left but were afraid of retribution, always cowering in a remote corner. Am I wrong here?” Li Qiye said.

“Bullshit, I fear no one and would have devoured them if they had come back.” Epoch’s End couldn’t help but curse.

“Why didn’t you devour them when they were around? You either thought that they would never come back or they would be far weaker, that’s why you became bold with your words.” Li Qiye said.

“Where are you getting this information from?” Voracious asked.

“I just have a lot of friends, that’s all.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“You have friends? I’m sure they have been backstabbed and devoured by you.” Epoch’s End didn’t buy it.

“I admit that I am inferior to you in one aspect, being a despicable wretch. During your epoch when Tianshou was around, you didn’t dare to bark. Once he disappeared, you ambushed Tianji and devoured your epoch. Hahaha, I’m sure they viewed you as a brother. After all, the three of you walked together and watched your epoch grow. You were the only one who couldn’t resist the temptation and kept on playing the part to gain their trust. Once Tianshou was gone, you immediately revealed your fangs and plotted against Tianji.” Li Qiye said. [1]

“You... are you a survivor?” Epoch’s End became stunned upon hearing this. He took a second look and Li Qiye couldn’t be one of them.

He devoured everything after killing Tianji and became the sole survivor. No one else had a clue about this period in time until now.

“Don’t be surprised, I visited a few ruins you never got to, and after a little research, I got a general idea of what happened. If I’m not mistaken, you’re none other than the missing Tianzu.” Li Qiye smiled. [2]

“!!!” Epoch’s End took a deep breath for this was indeed his identity.

He buried his true name after devouring his epoch and became known as Epoch’s End.

“I take that as a yes.” Li Qiye waved his hand and continued: “I was a little confused at first. Your epoch was brilliant indeed but it wasn’t time for the villainous heaven to end the cycle, everything was peaceful as well so what happened?”

“I eventually came to find that there were three lords during this epoch, Tianshou, Tianji, and Tianzu. Tianshou went missing and Tianji started an expedition, that’s the timeline before destruction.” He stroked his chin and continued.

“Tianshou was magnificent while Tianji was weaker, why did Tianji want to start an expedition without the epoch’s strongest member? Someone must have whispered and schemed against him, but who could have influenced an overlord? There was only one answer, you, his sworn brother, Tianzu.” Li Qiye went on.

“You were the weakest among the three, hence the need to ambush him at the perfect opportunity, a dagger from the back to deal a fatal blow. Afterward, you were free to devour your epoch. Did I get everything right?” Li Qiye asked.

“You met Tianji?!” Epoch’s End thought about this possibility.

“Why Tianji and not Tianshou?” Li Qiye smirked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

1. Tianshou = Heavenly Head, Tianji = Heavenly Spine/back. It’s hard to say whether I should use the English or the pinyin for these titles ☜

2. Tianzu = Heavenly Feet ☜
