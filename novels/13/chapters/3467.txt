Bones and corpses piled up like hills above the streams of blood to the horror of the crowd.

These three sects were the strongest lineages in the north. How could an individual take them down so effortlessly and brutally?

The crowd’s stomach churned after hearing the stench; their palms became sweaty as they stared at Li Qiye.

He didn’t think twice before massacring them. Just think about it, it meant that all three sects would be pursuing him with everything they got. Heavenly Sovereigns themselves would join.

Yin Yang Gate was the worst to have as an enemy among the three. Nonetheless, Li Qiye simply didn’t think about the consequences.

“How domineering.” An expert from the previous generation took a deep breath.

“More like brutal, no one is more brutal than him in the north...” An ancestor smiled wryly, feeling chills coursing down his back.

“Too weak.” Li Qiye smiled as if he didn’t just kill 100,000 men.

No one but him would dare to say this given the tough future ahead with three behemoths after him.

“The princess left.” A meticulous spectator noticed this during the fight.

Of course, he didn’t dare to say that she had escaped in order to give her some face.

The moment she saw the true power of the lava, she immediately knew that the situation was grim and escaped without any hesitation.

Most thought that this was a wise decision. It didn’t affect her reputation and prestige in the slightest.

“That’s indicative of her vision and insight.” The older cultivators praised her.

Others wouldn’t have been able to escape in time or they would care about their sect’s reputation and their own to do so.

She was quick and decisive - good qualities to have for a general. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Li Qiye had no intention of pursuing her since she didn’t affect the grand scheme of things in the slightest.

“She won’t let this go.” One spectator quietly said.

“Even if she wants to, the others won’t. Yin Yang? No, the same with Firmaments and Skylight. They will want blood for blood.” An ancestor shook his head.

Plus, the three sects had no choice. Swallowing this anger would destroy their status in the north. How could they intimidate their rivals and tributaries from then on? How could they remain at the top?

Swift vengeance was essential in keeping their spot. This was especially true for Yin Yang. It has gradually grown to become the leader of the north, influential enough to give commands to the others.

As long as Li Qiye was alive, they wouldn’t be able to walk with their head held high. Others would laugh at them for being cowardly turtles.

“Okay, the show’s over, back to your own business, everyone.” Li Qiye shrugged and told the crowd.

Some were actually happy to see this. At the very least, they could return to the domain to find some more treasures.

He went back to the domain while Pearlstone Saintess and Shi Wawa stayed outside.

He had no fear of the domain in the slightest during this saunter.

“The phoenix bloodline is incredible.” The easy journey made others jealous.

People from Divine Stone Ridge, despite their success, needed to exercise prudence with every step. Their path was meticulously planned.

The ancestors from that sect were afraid of the heat because one wrong step meant becoming smoke.

This wasn’t the case for Li Qiye since the heat didn’t seem to affect him. Everyone believed that this was due to the phoenix blood flowing through him.

Pearlstone Saintess didn’t say anything because she knew that it had nothing to do with the phoenix bloodline. He could still do so without; this was just a repeat of what happened in the beetle valley.

Miracles were common when Li Qiye was around. The only real question she had were the mysteries regarding his identity.

“Is he not here for the treasury?” People became surprised because Li Qiye wasn’t heading for the dao portal.

He walked towards the depth of the domain where the terrible flames resided.

“What does he want to do?” The crowd started clamoring.

“Don’t forget about his bloodline.” An ancestor brought this up.

They had a moment of realization and thought that this made sense. The guy was tracing back to the source.

“So what’s actually there?” One person asked.

The ravaging flames in there frightened all of them. Nonetheless, they remained curious.

The flames have been there for who knows how many years? What else was there?

“Maybe an extraordinary treasure, that’s why Skylight Dao Lord tried to go there.” Someone said.
