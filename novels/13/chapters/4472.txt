Chapter 4473: Ancient Painting

The Lu Clan Master actually granted them an audience. He was up there in age and had a slight hunch.

He looked just like an old farmer and had a tobacco pipe, inhaling and letting out smoke.

In terms of seniority, Wise and Purpose Ancestor far exceeded him. They were the strongest of their respective clan while he was only a junior. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Alas, he only showed his head ever so little, not performing a proper salutation. Nonetheless, the two ancestors didn’t seem to mind.

They came with gifts this time. Wise Ancestor smiled and said: “A small token of our sincerity. Please accept them, Virtuous Nephew.”

These two ancestors didn’t have an overbearing attitude at all. The clan master nodded again and only quietly put away the gifts.

“This young noble is an ancient ancestor of our clan. He came today to see the descendant of the Lu.” Wise introduced.

The Lu Clan Master finally showed some emotions, becoming startled. He took another look at Li Qiye and his expression said it all - skepticism.

He then focused on the ancestors and Jian Ming’s expression. Alas, they didn’t seem to be bringing a youth here to trick him. Both the Jian and the Tie seemed to have accepted this ancient ancestor.

Thus, he had no choice but to lower his head and said: “Greetings, Young Noble.”

He then felt frustrated and sat back down. Since the other three clans have recognized him, the Lu had no choice but to do so as well.

Li Qiye didn’t mind the cold reception. His attention was stolen by an old painting placed in the hall.

This hall has withstood the test of time. Rumor has it that it was built by their forefather, hence the fading paint and spotty damage.

The star of the hall, the painting, had a canvas made of nebula paper. Unfortunately, the years have robbed the painting of its original colors and lines. The corners have turned yellow and some parts have curled up. It seemed that just a slight touch would break it down to pieces.

It portrayed a lady with short hair, looking valiant and heroic - clearly inferior to no men. She had a divine sword hanging on her waist, seemingly capable of soaring into the air and sealing the gods.

Alas, the most notable thing about her was her crown. It wasn’t made from a divine metal but rather, woven together from willow branches. It still had a golden hue but lacked the same weight. It felt soft and special, as eye-catching as can be.

It accentuated the lady’s already impressive appearance, making her look like an unbeatable godking on the verge of ascension.

Because the painting depicted such a wonderful being, the woman still seemed animated and vivid. Spectators focusing on her would get the illusion that she was about to walk out of the painting. All the blurred lines became as clear as ever.

Li Qiye became sentimental since another part of his past resurfaced. Of course, this was only in his memory since she was no longer around.

The only constant in this world was the grand dao. Everything else would gradually disappear on the river of time, the same for all traces of them. Li Qiye proved himself to be an exception thus far while others were mere passersby.

Who was more pitiful? Those who eventually obtain eternal rest or Li Qiye who would flow on the river of time forever like a mosquito larva?

Perhaps the length of the journey and the flow of the river of time were different for everyone. A long-enough river would be able to drown out the most supreme genius and unbeatable master. Even the lineage of someone with countless descendants would end one day.

Those who were capable of leaving indelible traces in history included the most terrifying existences. They were dark butchers who stained the river with a tsunami of blood.

Meanwhile, the ancestors were talking with the clan master of the Lu.

“Virtuous Nephew, the young noble has returned in order to perform the Primordial Union.” Wise Ancestor revealed.

“The union?” The clan master’s eyes flashed brightly for a split second before dimming back down.

“You are surely aware of the union’s significance for our four clan. It pertains to our glory. Outsiders do not know but we, the descendants, are aware of our ancestors’ feat and contribution with the supreme existence. The union was formed then and we shall have it again.” Wise Ancestor continued.

According to the legend, this phenomenon known as the Primordial Union was started after the duck egg buyer created Eight Desolaces.

“Get straight to the point.” The clan master pondered for a moment before asserting. He wasn’t an idiot; people wouldn’t come bearing gifts for no reason.

Wise Ancestor glanced at his group. Jian Ming understood and smiled: “Clan Master, our very foundation is the Tree of Contribution. The young noble shall activate it again with the union and we will have primordial energy again. Glory will then return to the four clans.”

“Hmph, so you want our dao stone.” The clan master scowled.

“Virtuous Nephew.” Wise Ancestor smiled wryly: “The four dao stones were left behind by our ancestors, not belonging to any single clan. They were simply divided for safekeeping reasons.”

“Then what about our clan Willow Crest?” The clan master retorted.

“...” The trio couldn’t come up with a response right away.

Purpose coughed and said: “Virtuous Nephew, you know about the history of this. The crest was given by an immortal in the distant years and represented ultimate authority. We all know that it belonged to the Lu, but our four clans came up with an agreement. The four clans would pick a leader to wear it. Plus, the three clans have compensated as well.”

“We never said that it would last forever, and we haven’t had a leader for the last few eras.” The clan master was unsatisfied.
