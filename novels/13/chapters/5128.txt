Chapter 5129: Slaughter Blade

The aftermath consisted of demons being crucified on the peaks.

“Break!” The conqueror sent his energy waves toward the ocean of swords.

“Clank!” The swords came together for another ultimate slash, capable of splitting an ocean into two.

“Boom!” This obliterated the maelstrom, revealing a bloody figure.

“True Bear Conqueror!” Both sides became emotional to see a conqueror.

Alas, the demons were alarmed due to the visible wounds.

On the other side, the swords disappeared and were replaced by an old man. He stroked his white beard while everyone avoided looking at his domineering eyes.

“Soaring Sword Monarch!” True Bear Conqueror’s expression changed after seeing the opponent.

He then reverted to his original form - a colossal black bear. His black fur draped down like waterfalls.

Alas, his aura was clearly weaker than the old man’s sword energy. The strands rampaged like true dragons as he stood there.

Soaring Sword Monarch was an ancient ancestor of Heavenly Sword with six sacred fruits.

“Why are you attacking our mountain?!” True Bear roared furiously, causing all listeners to tremble in fear.

Only the powerful sovereigns could withstand his aura, albeit barely.

“Isn’t it rather obvious?” The monarch responded: “You refused the recruitment call, so we shall not show mercy.”

“Members of True Bear will not be controlled by anyone.” The conqueror’s eyes exuded incredible flames.

“Hence our current situation.” The monarch was not affected by his aura.

“Die then!” The conqueror realized that there was nothing else to discuss and immediately swung his claw forward.

The sheer destruction obliterated the peaks nearby along with the weaker attackers.

“Hmph.” The monarch stopped the devastating claw with a slash and added more power to it.

“Clank!” It severed all affinities in its path, forcing True Bear to use his weapon - a staff as large as a mountain range.

“Rumble!” The latter parried the slash but staggered several steps backward.

“Skysmasher!” The conqueror spun his staff wildly and caused serious damage to the terrain, ready for another attack.

“Slaughter Blade!” The monarch utilized a rain of swords to combat the staff before delivering the main swing.

“Bam!” It cut the conqueror, forcing him down to the ground while vomiting blood.

“Clank!” The monarch pointed his blade at the fallen combatant.

“Conqueror, being smart is a virtue.” He declared his victory.

“You wish to recruit me?” The conqueror showed no sign of submission despite losing.

“Heaven Alliance is always recruiting capable cultivators. If you join us, your future will be limitless. You will gain more dao fruits in just a short time.” The monarch said.

Heaven was one of the four major alliances in the upper continents. It represented Celestial Court and had many conquerors and dao lords on its side.

“I’m not interested.” The conqueror proudly refused.

“I know you are close to Windchaser Conqueror and Divine Alliance but they will not be able to help you. Times are changing there.” The monarch snorted.

“What are you saying?” The conqueror’s eyes narrowed.

He was a bear demon who took several hundred thousand years of cultivation before becoming a conqueror. He only had one dao fruit at the start and has yet to gain another.

Some conquerors and dao lords could seize twelve dao fruits at the same while others were stuck with one for their whole life.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

As for True Bear, he was not from a powerful lineage and lacked resources. There was a long way to go for him before becoming competitive with the high number of conquerors found in the upper continents.

“Principle Conqueror has abdicated. The guardian of Divine Alliance is now Sword Sea Dao Lord.” The monarch revealed.

“Brother Principle abdicated?” The conqueror didn’t expect this.

Since he had cultivated for a long time, he had met many important figures - one of them being Principle Conqueror.

The guardian role was only second to the alliance leader, so Principle was rather famous and prestigious.

He was certainly one of the strongest conquerors right now, hence his position. The legend regarding him stated that he was only a regular disciple of Dao Alliance.

He trained and trained to only be at the elementary level at the age of eighty. Even his descendants surpassed him. Three thousand years later, his sons were dragon lords already. However, the slowest one in the family didn’t give up and eventually became a conqueror.

This achievement didn’t slow down his ambition and determination. Twelve fruits and prestige became his rewards.

In terms of time, True Bear actually spent more time cultivating than Principle. Of course, his circumstances were even tougher.

The two of them met by chance in the past. Since they shared similar struggles, they became close to one another.

This played a large part in why True Bear Mountain remained standing despite being located in a perilous situation. Moreover, he was also friends with Windchaser Conqueror.

Alas, they were finally under attack today by Heaven Alliance since their backer has abdicated.

Of course, True Bear was shaken not because of this. True conquerors didn’t rely on anyone; it’s just that this had serious implications.

Principle has been in charge for a long time now. This abdication signaled a storm rising on the horizon.

True Bear understood why Heavenly Sword picked this moment to attack them.
