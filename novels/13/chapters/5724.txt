Chapter 5725: I’ll Take You To A Fun Place

Visual phenomena scattered in a boundless void within Immortal Dao City.

An everlasting azure, a boundless ocean, an illusory immortal dao... These phenomena could be real or mere illusions. A peerless emperor would still have a hard time discerning the truth, needing to actually visit and experience them.

Thus, the journey could be endless within the heavenly treasure. The world here was larger than the six continents combined with Eight Desolaces.

Nonetheless, the branches were available. One could travel anywhere including the past or the future.

Despite the innumerable options, perhaps all of them shared the same destination. After reaching this point, one might find familiar faces such as Inconcealable Ancient God or Immortal Monarch Yi Ye waiting.

As for Li Qiye, he saw an endless grand dao instead of compartmentalized phenomena - one meant to be traversed alone.

The risk of being lost on this path before reaching the finish line was considerable. A firm dao heart was essential.

Numerous and unpredictable dangers awaited including qi deviation, the temptation of darkness, old age...

Li Qiye stopped looking at the bigger picture and its mysteries, focusing on the individual phenomena instead.

Finding someone hiding in these phenomena was virtually impossible without entering them. The dao here concealed everything.

Luminous and West Bank Prime Emperor had entered one of them. Finding the two would require an immense period of time.

“Will he be able to find them?” Ancestors and big shots stood outside the immortal city and observed the visual phenomena, becoming dizzy in the process.

They had no chance of entering, let alone attempting to comprehend them. Only imperial-level characters could endure long enough.

“This is trying to find a needle in a haystack.” An ancestor murmured.

Everyone wished for Li Qiye to avenge the fallen defenders. Alas, finding the two seemed to be a futile endeavor.

No wonder why they dared attempting the reckless move and risked provoking Li Qiye. As long as they could make it inside Immortal Dao City and embark on one of the paths, Li Qiye wouldn’t be able to find them.

Even if he could pick the right phenomenon to enter, they might have already made it to the other shore at that point. Perhaps they would have become immortal beings and no longer need to fear him.

In reality, they were rather optimistic with their planning and underestimated Li Qiye.

Alas, he had no intention of using his intent to right the right phenomenon. He patted the white cloud and smiled: “Go, help me find those two.”

It turned back and forth, seemingly shaking its head.

“Do it, find them and I’ll take you to a fun place afterward.” Li Qiye said.

It stared at him, seemingly not interested in the offer.

“It’s a different heavenly treasure, far more fun than Immortal Dao City.” Li Qiye smiled.

This piqued its interest but then again, it took a look at the countless phenomena and shook its head.

It could indeed find the two in just a short time. Nonetheless, it thought that this was too much of a hassle.

“Still don’t want to go?” Li Qiye continued: “I will find you a friend, someone who you can play with.”

The cloud stared at him skeptically.

“Doubting me?” Li Qiye said: “I’m sure you haven’t seen a friend before, it will be rather interesting.” Li Qiye said.

It shook its head, not believing that there was another in the mortal world.

“Yes or no?” Li Qiye smiled and patted it. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It thought carefully before refusing to be an errand boy. Going through all these phenomena required a lot of power.

Li Qiye lost patience and grabbed it with both hands, kneading it into a white and round cotton candy. Others couldn’t help wanting to take a bite.

He immediately tossed it forward before it could react.

“Boom!” It soared with lightning speed into a phenomenon before coming out, then the second and the third...

It could instantly pass through any phenomenon and leave after failing to discover the duo. All of this happened in the blink of an eye.

Cultivators outside only saw a series of afterimages piercing through one phenomenon after another, connecting them seamlessly.
