Chapter 5429: Original Aspiration Forgotten

“Sir!” All-things was ecstatic and no longer worried about the situation.

“You!” Illumination became alarmed.

By this point, everyone had witnessed Li Qiye’s frightening ability, especially his effortless victory over Immortal Pagoda Conqueror.

“You deserve death many times over.” Li Qiye uttered coldly.

Everyone shuddered after hearing this, feeling as if their heart had just been pierced by a thousand arrows.

“You said that you wouldn’t interfere in the conflict between The People and The Race!” Illumination shouted.

“The line has been crossed.” Li Qiye uttered coldly before releasing his murderous intent.

There was no suppression or destruction - only a pure affinity causing knees to buckle. Even the apex cultivators felt a chill coursing down their spine.

“Hahaha, all of you have forgotten your original aspiration.” Illumination laughed and said: “This includes you, Sir. Do you not remember your background now that you stand at the apex, that you are a human? Your race has been enslaved by the great races for eras, how can you stand to watch their imperious grin and Celestial Court’s tyranny? What I shall do today is deliver justice to both the enemies and those who have forgotten their roots.”

“You are not qualified to comment on my intent or the past. Early on in the history of this world, the hundred races had to face diversity because of madmen like you. You are no different from Celestial Court, only significantly weaker. In fact, I guarantee that if you were to possess their power, you would have been more dangerous, a scourge upon this world.” Li Qiye uttered coldly.

“I spent my life fighting Heaven Alliance and killing The Race, how can I be the scourge?” Illumination couldn’t be convinced otherwise.

“Are you forgetting that your casualties include members of The People and mortals?” Li Qiye asked.

“All grand designs require sacrifices and blood. That is what makes them great.” Illumination said.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Enough.” Li Qiye became impatient and reached for the black fog.

“Stop!” Illumination performed a cosmic smash to stop Li Qiye.

“Boom!” An entire galaxy struck Li Qiye’s hand but this didn’t stop him from removing the dao chain from the hook.

With that, the black fog fell back into the profound flow in Ultimate, disappearing from sight.

“What have you done?!” Illumination became livid.

“I should have killed you long ago.” Li Qiye said.

“We’ll see about that. You have considered yourself to be above all for too long, I will kick you off your throne today!” Illumination roared.

“The futile struggling of an ant who thinks it’s strong enough now after borrowing some meager power.” Li Qiye said.

“You shall see!” Illumination roared.

“Rumble!” The stars within his body became resplendent, turning the dark space into a well-lit battlefield.

“Timeless Illumination!” With the help of the stars, he channeled all the power of the illusory realm to attack Li Qiye.

It included his own dao power, the vitality from the galaxy, and the borrowed force of the illusory realm. Everything was obliterated along the way.

Dragon lords and conquerors bellowed in horror. Weaker cultivators instantly lost control of their body.

“Boom!” The explosion returned everything back to its origin; space and time could no longer be seen.

Alas, Li Qiye simply stood still while radiating a special aura. The ultimate blow didn’t leave any damage.

“I can’t believe it!” The apex cultivators shouted.

“This is the end for you.” Li Qiye took one step forward.

“Die!” Illumination unleashed another cosmic palm strike. Given his current state, this was enough to pulverize anyone beneath the “apex” realm.

Li Qiye retaliated by tearing off the cosmic hand without facing any resistance. Everyone felt as if he was pulling down the fabrics of reality as well. Keep in mind that Illumination had become a part of this region.

Thus, everything became chaotic and started spinning around. All the natural affinities ran amok.

As everyone was left in disbelief, Li Qiye only needed one kick to topple the cosmic being, sending him down to the ground.

This caused immense spatial instability; everyone saw the world spinning around them.
