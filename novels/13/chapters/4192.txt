Chapter 4193: Dreadful Creature

Nothing but darkness could be seen beneath the sinkhole. Li Qiye looked up and no longer saw the hole above or any light.

It appeared boundless just like the sky. Alas, Li Qiye was strong enough to analyze the entire area and see through the black veils.

He scanned around and understood everything, not being at risk of death like other visitors.

“Creak…” A heavy grinding noise sounded both far and near, akin to a heavy stone door being pushed open.

However, Li Qiye knew that it was a gigantic creature encompassing the entire domain. Its size was unfathomable. The uninvited intruder woke it up so it started moving.

He stood there with a smile, completely unaffected. Though the creature was barely moving, it felt as if mountain ranges were on the move.

Nonetheless, it didn’t result in a quaking effect - meaning that the creature had full mastery over its body’s movements, a testament to its power.

“Clank!” A sharp gale cut through the air. A saber landed on the ground, easily cutting through it like a piece of tofu.

Its glint illuminated the dark area, allowing Li Qiye to see how deadly it was. A regular cultivator wouldn’t be able to see the blade in its entirety due to its length.

The glint also had a nether presence as if it came from hell and belonged to a reaper. Just one swing would reap a million lives. Alas, this was still not enough to frighten Li Qiye.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The first blade was only the beginning. Countless ones began descending while intersecting and clanking with others; each taller than the heaven.

This was more than enough to scare someone to death. The blades could eviscerate and mince the earth into countless pieces. Cultivators were more fragile than insects before them.

Upon closer inspection, one would find that these reaper blades were actually legs belonging to the massive monster.

It simply moved and gave the impression of countless blades descending. Both heaven and earth along with Li Qiye were right beneath it.

The smile still didn’t disappear on his face during a moment when others might soil themselves.

“Another visitor at last.” Words of an ancient language came from above. The entire world was filled with these words. Weak cultivators would instantly explode from the sound waves alone.

He understood and chuckled.

“Tell me a reason not to eat you.” The creature seemed to be the ruler of the world, capable of determining the fate of others.

“I’ll spare you since I’m in a good mood. Leave.” To which Li Qiye responded.

“Spare me?!!!” These words echoed and smashed the spatial fabrics. The creature hasn’t heard anything this ridiculous and funny in a long time.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Your audacity knows no bounds, speaking like this when standing before me.” It wasn’t angry, just amused by this insignificant creature.

“Don’t waste my time, I’ll leave after I get what I want. Be smart and move or I’ll rip you apart.” Li Qiye patiently said.

“Arrogant brat, do you even know what this place is?” It laughed heartily.

“Don’t know, don’t need to know, don’t care either.” Li Qiye said: “Move.”

“I’m surprised that you know about the thing in this place. Unfortunately, whoever sent you here has sent you to your death. I’m afraid that I can’t spare you either since I can’t recall the last time I tasted meat. I need a good meal today.” The creature spoke.

“Are you sure?” Li Qiye smirked.

“No one can leave this place without my permission. Your fate is to become food in my stomach.” It said chillingly.

“Unfortunately, I’m always the exception.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Hahaha, we’ll see about that, junior!” The creature laughed thunderously.

“Creak! Creak! Creak!” Powerful gales and creaking noises ensued. It finally moved faster to circle Li Qiye.

This allowed light to come in for a moment. Anyone else would be paralyzed on the ground after seeing the creature - a colossal centipede. When it stood upright, the stars would circle around it.

“Let me take a look at you.” Its head could finally be seen - looking ferocious with a bloody mouth and two sharp teeth.

It opened its eyes and red rays illuminated Li Qiye. They looked like two suns made of blood.
