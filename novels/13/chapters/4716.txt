Chapter 4717: Infinite Banishment

The song and the rays aimed to change Li Qiye into another god under Juntian.

Both ancestors and supreme geniuses had a hard time dealing with this technique. They gradually turned into gods under Juntian and started chanting as well before emitting harmonizing rays. This all added to Shen Juntian’s dao power.

However, Li Qiye waved his hand to form a rune. Both time and space became subjected to his movement along with the myriad dao. The starry rays shooting at his body and the dao notes followed his trajectory as well.

They stopped affecting Li Qiye as if he had just added a thin layer of silk on top of his body. Though the strings were fine and delicate, they still easily stopped the attack.

This shocked True Immortal Emperor and the others. Ancient ancestors couldn’t believe it either.

Li Qiye once again did the impossible, creating a barrier with a single hand wave capable of nullifying the purification dao notes.

Five-sun King had experienced this technique before, having nearly fallen to it. If one managed to block the purification process, the resulting pressure was suffocating and prone to cause grievous injuries.

He also couldn’t understand how Li Qiye did it. The technique and merit law remained unknown. In fact, he couldn’t guess how much power Li Qiye mustered to do so. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Let my blood be the judge!” Shen Juntian roared and raised his voice. Even the deaf suddenly could hear again.

His engulfing energies became empowered. Every particle pulsed with its own light waves.

“Buzz.” Everyone felt as if a dao lord was here in person. Though this was obviously false, a dao lord aura manifested into reality, seemingly lasting for eras to come.

“The dao lord bloodline.” A reclusive ancient ancestor whispered.

Shen Juntian finally activated his bloodline. The aura twisted the air around Li Qiye and bypassed the mysterious barrier. Of course, this aura wasn’t meant to empower or bless him.

The area around Li Qiye started shrinking with all the other affinities at an increasing pace. Meanwhile, Shen Juntian and his converted followers chanted the same mantra to hasten this process.

Everyone witnessed a strange scene - Li Qiye himself was shrinking and eventually became the size of a dust speck.

This didn’t stop there. Both the area around him and his body became infinitely small until they were no longer visible.

“What is happening?” Five-sun King’s maids became startled.

They had never seen something like this before from Shen Juntian. He normally dominated his foe with sheer power, reducing to ashes or blood.

“Banishment.” Five-sun King said: “Once space is small enough, the object inside will be banished to a different dimension. Think about it like this, when a drop of water is added to an ocean, it will be lost there forever. Separation is impossible.”

“I see, he won’t be able to return.” His maids were also talented cultivators and understood right away.

Once Li Qiye was gone, those who have been converted by his Divine Song regained their wits. They still had memories from before when they helped him banish Li Qiye.

This made them break out in cold sweats despite not suffering any lingering side effects. Shen Juntian had full control over them with his grand dao. He could have killed them without facing any resistance.

“That’s quite something…” A supreme genius started moving far away from Shen Juntian, not wanting to be converted again.

“Divine Song.” An ancestor got chills coursing down his spine.

Some of the converted followers were Heavenly Sovereigns. Alas, they were powerless to stop him from controlling them.

They tried to quell this fear and thought about the situation - Li Qiye was no longer around.

“He’s still alive but can he ever come back?” Someone said.

Shen Juntian’s technique consisted of three parts - his dao power, his bloodline, and the followers’ added strength. This infinitely reduced the space around Li Qiye until banishment occurred. This didn’t kill Li Qiye, only serving to banish him to a lost realm. This was akin to erasing him from existence.

“So this is another method, killing isn’t the only way.” One crowd member became astounded at the ingenuity used to defeat an undefeatable foe.
