All eyes were on Lu Yiling after hearing the promise of three moves. He was a famous expert right now in the northern West King.

In fact, even in all of West King, finding someone capable of defeating him this quickly was as hard as finding an autumn leaf.

They exchanged glances, wondering if Li Qiye could actually do so. This would require a monstrous power.

“Is it possible? They have similar weapons.” A skeptic quietly said.

These weapons should be close in strength. That’s why Li Qiye shouldn’t be able to defeat Lu Yiling within three moves. It was illogical enough to not be part of a legendary tale.

“Only a Heavenly Sovereign can, anyone weaker would find it prohibitive.” An elder mused for a bit before concluding.

“Very well, three moves then.” Yiling agreed without any hesitation: “I have zero regrets if I were to die within three moves, that would show just how mighty my opponent is.”

“Go.” Li Qiye didn’t bother using a defensive stance with his sword. He stood there with a hundred openings visible to the experts here.

It looked as if he was underestimating his enemy - a potentially fatal mistake against a genius like Lu Yiling.

The crowd wondered if Li Qiye was simply too strong or if it was just his arrogant style.

“He’s too careless.” An experienced expert thought that Li Qiye was being too haughty.

They all knew that the right strike could take down Li Qiye due to all the openings.

Alas, Lu Yiling didn’t think so. His eyes became as bright as two suns. Rays shot straight towards Li Qiye. What he found was perfection. The openings and holes were anything but. Their abundance took it to the other extreme, resulting in a flawless defense.

“Boom!” Yiling released his vitality and chaos true energy. His grand dao power surged like an endless flood.

“Rumble!” This power swept through the area and froze the crowd. The weak dropped to the ground.

“Clank!” He didn’t hold anything back and put it all on the line. There was only one chance.

The three swords began to rotate and affected the temporal-spatial affinities. Space seemingly turned into a liquid and followed the rotation.

Some spectators became dizzy from this phenomenon and also fell to the ground. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Boom!” After the swords reached their rotational limit, they erupted with power and began pulling the power of the yin and yang. Spatial distance no longer mattered. The beams coming from the three swords could sever everything.

It was as if a dao lord was performing this move in person, enough to crush Eight Desolaces and the reincarnation cycle.

The move was actually aiming at the golden dragon above, not Li Qiye.

Yiling’s goal became clear. He wanted to destroy this dragon in order to save the sect master on top of buying time for the rest to escape.

As long as the golden dragon was around, his peers wouldn’t be able to run. His ultimate slash was for the others, not himself.

“Goo!” He shouted at the three daoists.

The latter wanted to help him, aware of his perilous situation. Alas, they had no other choice but to try and run with the army.

“Now!” They shouted in unison and were prepared a while ago.

“Boom!” Three grand formations emerged - an elephant, bird, and pagoda formation. They encompassed the daoists and the great army.

The bird flew to the sky; the elephant ran with full speed, the pagoda dashed towards the horizon...

They turned their group into three individual formations. This was the fastest and safest way to flee.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye made his move at the same second by casually waving his patrimony sword like a peacock spreading its tail.

The leisure swing created a majestic mountain range surrounding the sect. Nothing could ever climb above these peaks. It even severed the concept of time. The past and the future were no longer affecting the area.

It sealed everything. The gods and devils, the unbeatable dao lords - they still wouldn’t be able to beat this sealing technique. It successfully blocked Yiling’s ultimate slash and saved the dragon.

“Activate!” Yiling was caught off guard but still reacted right away. Beams as red as blood shot out from his three swords.

“Rumble!” They started attacking Li Qiye’s patrimony sword but couldn’t break its seal.

“Boom!” The golden dragon finally took action with a claw strike engulfing the world.

The area became infinitely smaller so the army who was far away by the horizon was caught by the dragon claw.

“No!” Yiling bellowed but he couldn’t help because all of his power was focused on attacking Li Qiye’s sword.

The claw came down and crushed everything.

“Ahhh!” The bird, elephant, and pagoda formations disintegrated.

“Pop!” Blood splashed everywhere.

The army became vulnerable after the destruction of the formations so they fell victim to the claw.

“Boom!” Not a single soul was lucky enough to survive. Rain of blood descended; the sanguine mist wouldn’t disperse.
