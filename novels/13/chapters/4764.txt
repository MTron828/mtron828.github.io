Chapter 4765: Wo Longxuan

True lords could leave behind indelible marks by just strolling. This applied to the current group of four, leaving behind footprints as they relaxed without hiding their divinity.

The daoist’s group tagged along but kept a distance. The emperor was a progenitor of a sect. His status and power were far beyond the two juniors. Alas, all three were ants compared to the four walking in front. He was no different than them at this point.

Meanwhile, Xiao Xuan maintained a fierce glare against the other two women.

Zhuo Jianshi didn’t mind it and kept a graceful appearance while Liu Ruyan kept on glancing and smirking at Xiao Xuan, seemingly provoking her.

“I thought you two had jumped into the abyss, why are you still here?” Xiao Xuan asked.

“Lil’ Sis, it sounds like you’re not happy to see us here.” Liu Ruyan chuckled: “Is it so that no one will compete with you for the young noble?” She winked after saying this.

“Ridiculous!” Xiao Xuan turned slightly red and glared at her.

“So I’m right.” Ruyan smirked charmingly as if she was just a blossoming teen.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Don’t think I won’t rip out your tongue.” Xiao Xuan didn’t back down.

“Please don’t, I’m so scared of your draconic power.” Ruyan patted her towering breasts; others wouldn’t be able to avert their gaze.

She seemed to be tempting others into committing a crime with every wink and smile.

“I’ll show you then.” Xiao Xuan looked like a cute lion cub ready to pounce.

Instead of being cute, the playful banter between the two scared the hell out of the trio in the back.

A battle between these two would shake the world. They would need to keep a safe distance.

Zhuo Jianshi glanced at Xiao Xuan and said: “Dragon King, you’re different from before. I still remember your impressive showing back in that ocean before.”

Xiao Xuan had another title unknown to present cultivators - Skycoiler Dragon King. Her real name was Wo Longxuan.

Of course, her name was mostly forgotten. People had a better shot of recognizing her by her title at this point. Only a few existences still had access to this information due to the destruction of the previous epoch.

Zhuo Jianshi and Liu Ruyan were two such people. They recognized her despite her youthful reversion.

“So?” The current Xiao Xuan longer resembled that of a fierce dragon but rather, more like an angry child.

Jianshi only smiled and didn’t say anything.

“Whatever you say, okay?” Ruyan winked at her and continued: “The real problem here is that you have turned into a bad-tempered girl, I don’t think our young noble is that much of a pervert to like a little fruit.”

Xiao Xuan’s anger only grew since both her personality and figure were criticized just now. Ruyan called her a little fruit while fully aware that others would describe the two of them as “mature fruits”, ripe for the taking.

“You asking for a fight?” Xiao Xuan turned red from anger.

“I’m ready whenever you want.” Ruyan didn’t back down.

Xiao Xuan pulled up her sleeves, seemingly ready to fight. She used to be a supreme beauty as well, not losing to Ruyan aesthetically. Alas, both her personality and figure took a shift with the reversion.

“Okay, stop quarreling so much.” Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted them.

Both immediately obeyed. Ruyan stopped being provocative and switched back to a regular tone: “Why did you turn into a little girl?”

“None of your business.” Xiao Xuan scowled.

“You’ve regained your memory.” Li Qiye smiled.

The fierce girl was rather obedient to Li Qiye. She nodded and sighed, clearly feeling sad about the event. The sigh didn’t look right coming from a girl like her.

She was once a dominating dragon king with numerous friends and fellow sect members. All were gone now.

Ruyan and Jianshi had experienced something similar. Nonetheless, their sect was still around and most importantly, they still had each other.

Xiao Xuan has been alone on her dao path for a long period now. Recently, she had entered a dimension prepared in the past and regained her memories and legacy.

“It seems like a perfect reversion with no backlash.” Jianshi commented.

“It’s a deep-sea bloodline.” Li Qiye said: “Her branch is extraordinarily ancient and its atavism gives back true blood for this reversion. She’ll be far stronger while growing up this time around.”

“Isn’t this essentially rebirth?” Ruyan became curious: “How did you regain your memory?”

“I’m not telling you.” Xiao Xuan snorted.

“Let me guess.” Ruyan smiled: “You used a special method to store your memories and another to seal your body, leaving enough clues to regain the memories later.”

“Hmph.” Xiao Xuan indirectly admitted that Ruyan was right.

“What a magical bloodline, two lives then.” Jianshi praised.

Top masters desired rebirth but this proved to be impossible. Alas, Xiao Xuan’s bloodline was special and moreover, this wasn’t a true rebirth. In a sense, her situation was superior because she was strong enough to make preparation for memory retrieval.
