Li Qiye turned a deaf ear to Ma Jinming’s rebuke and didn’t pay attention to Qin Jianyao either.

Jinming wanted to impress the fairy and earn her favor, not expecting this lack of response from Li Qiye. He felt a murderous urge after being left in this awkward situation.

Jianyao simply stared at him and didn’t mind. The two of them were from different worlds. After today, they might not be able to meet again

This so-called king would fall into obscurity and never appear on her path again since she would reach the peak and leave Imperial Lineage.

Thus, he could act all arrogant and nonchalant for he was nothing more than a ridiculous king. No, no longer a king, just another mortal. Why would a peak existence in the future care about the attitude of a mortal? She has already done her courteous part by greeting him.

“A mortal like me shouldn’t go to the immortal garret...” Suddenly, a resounding ode came about.

A wooden boat crossed through the lake like an arrow and instantly made it to the dock.

Everyone looked over and saw an old man sitting there rowing, allowing the boat to reach incredible speed.

“It’s him!” Some murmured in a daze after seeing the old man.

They recognized that this old woodcutter was the one who participated in the killing of Zeng Yibin.

Some glanced over at Li Qiye and wondered about the old man’s identity.

Even the calm-as-water Jianyao changed her expression. She quickly bowed and respectfully said: “Senior Southpeak.”

Her sudden action stunned everyone and made them think about the implication.

However, the old man didn’t look at her, seemingly not hearing her greeting. He stopped the boat nearby.

“Senior Southpeak, this little girl is Qin Jianyao of Calm Lotus. I’ve only got here and didn’t dare to disturb you...” She respectfully bowed again.

The crowd was speechless. This was the successor of a sect in possession of two secrets. Her status was incredible, not to mention that all the ancestors loved her.

She rarely performed such a respectful greeting to her ancestors, let alone an outsider like this. Could it be that this ordinary woodcutter was even more important than the five supreme ancestors?

He gently waved his sleeve in response: “Young miss, you are mistaken, I am only an ordinary working man.”

He then bowed towards Li Qiye and said: “Your Majesty, I heard you and the lady wishes to check out the lake. May I row your ship?” [1]

Chuqing lowered her head, embarrassed, after hearing the address. Of course, she felt quite good about it[2]

Li Qiye withdrew his gaze from the lake and glanced at the old man: “Go for it.”

The old man happily affirmed and acted as if this was a grand departure: “His Majesty and The Lady are setting out!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Though they didn’t have any servant or guards, he still performed the regular announcement.

This might be the shabbiest entourage of a king. Everyone wanted to laugh but they didn’t dare to utter a single sound.

After Li Qiye and Chuqing got on the wooden boat, the old man shouted again: “Proceed!”

He had a serious expression as if they were back in the imperial palace and he was the king’s eunuch.

“Splash!” The wooden boat began to move with his rowing, seemingly empowered by his ode as well: “A mortal like me shouldn’t go to the immortal garret...”

Everyone continued staring until the boat disappeared from sight. Even Jianyao herself remained in a bowing position and didn’t straighten up her back till the old man was gone.

She stood there and couldn’t regain her wits in full. She knew many stories and secrets about Nine-linked Mountains, especially about this woodcutter from the southern region. Her supreme ancestor also told her about him prior to the trip.

She was almost certain that this old man was the legendary woodcutter - the most unfathomable character in this sect, perhaps all of Nine Secrets. Few knew of his existence, but he was a frightening Eternal.

‘Why is someone like him valuing the king so much?’ She thought but couldn’t come up with an answer.

Keep in mind that even Lucidity King was rather respectful and humble in Nine-linked Mountains, and one of the reasons was because of Southpeak Woodcutter. Only the top talents could figure how strong he truly was. For example, Gu Yifei from the Li Clan.

A being of this level actually wanted to serve Li Qiye by rowing his boat? Jianyao was truly astounded.

In her eyes, the king was useless now; her sect agreed with this viewpoint too. This didn’t seem to be the case any longer after seeing the woodcutter’s attitude.

Everyone else gasped as well. Who was Qin Jianyao? There was no one else worthy of such respect from her outside the supreme ancestors.

Just who was this normal-looking woodcutter?

After calming down, Ma Jinming noticed her still standing there in a daze. He tried to curry favor: “Fairy Jin, don’t mind them. That Li guy is ignorant and arrogant, still shamelessly thinking that he’s the king...”

“Shut up!” Jianyao shouted, no longer wishing to speak. She felt a loss of control over the situation resulting in a looming danger and wasn’t in the mood to chat with this Jinming.

Jinming turned red. As the young noble of the Central Legion, no one has ever yelled at him like that besides his father.

However, he didn’t dare to act out towards Jianyao so he channeled his indignation and anger towards Li Qiye instead. That bastard was who caused this and he swore to have revenge, sooner or later!

***

The tiny boat undulated on the lake filled with blue water, looking just like a piece of jade. It had a diameter of a thousand miles, not much different from being in the ocean. The gentle breezes soothed the soul.

Li Qiye smiled while laying down on the boat and resting his legs on the hull: “How rare to have a big shot like you rowing for me, this might shock all of Nine Secrets. Lucidity King himself probably never got this treatment.”

“Your Majesty, please. My meager skills can’t get into your sight. Just a single thought of yours could decapitate me, and you would be using my blade to do that too.” He tapped the cutter tied to his waist.

He had his reasons for following Li Qiye. His cultivation was unfathomable to outsiders, which was why Lucidity had reservations about acting arrogant in this place.

However, his weapon was directly taken and controlled by Li Qiye. He as its master couldn’t regain control during the process at all. It meant that Li Qiye’s will had reached a frightening level. His own mental ability was that of a child compared to Li Qiye’s.

An ability of this level, at the very least, belonged to a progenitor of the immortal level. This might be the strongest master he has seen in his life.

“As the saying goes - fawning favors hides ulterior motives. What is yours?” Li Qiye leisurely said.

“Your Majesty, I am hiding nothing, just wanting to be a good host for you.” The old man said.

“I won’t be reserved if you have no requests then. Just don’t blame me for not being upfront with you later.” Li Qiye smiled.

1. The old man actually used the Chinese word for anyone married to the king to address Chuqing. It can be used for a queen, consort, concubine, etc., so there is no right translation for this since no context is established. I chose “lady” instead since it is ambiguous

2. Remember, he’s addressing her as a wife to Li Qiye; lady doesn’t fit perfectly here. I can’t pick any of the above because it will be an assumption on my part, and by calling her a “queen, consort, concubine”, we’re also adding information from the old man that isn’t there in the original text. He doesn’t know what she is exactly.
