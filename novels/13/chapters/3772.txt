Chapter 3773: Rivercross Lock

During their conversation, someone else climbed up Minor Sacred Mountain.

It was a girl in full chainmail. Not even a gust of wind could get through. Half of her face was covered as well. Nonetheless, the exposed section indicated that she was an exceptional beauty with starry eyes and an air of heroism. No man was her superior.

The rings had a silvery glow similar to fish scales. She resembled a divine commander descending from above. Nonetheless, the masculine nature of the armor wasn’t enough to hide her exceptional grace. Her body could be the perfect vessel for worldly energies.

A silver chain coiled around her arm and led all the way to her shoulder. The tip on the back looked like the end of a wing. She seemed ready to take flight at any second.

A girl like her always commanded attention wherever she went, enough to make eyes go bright. People would make way for her after sensing her commanding presence.

“This disciple greets you, Young Master.” She traveled up the steps and bowed her head respectfully.

Li Qiye glanced at her and shook his head: “Miss, I’m afraid you got the wrong person. I don’t know you and you’re not my disciple.”

“Fairy Dugu advised me to come and see you, Young Master.” The girl said.

“Alright, looks like someone is giving me more trouble. I’ll never have peace at this rate.” Li Qiye chuckled and nodded.

“One of the five heroes of Duality, Rivercross Lock, Wei Qianqing.” Xu Cuimei stared at the newcomer and said, seemingly amused.

The girl looked over at the unfamiliar face and was surprised: “And you are...?”

“I’m nobody important, just a disciple from Righteous Sect.” Xu Cuimei responded: “But I have heard of you before, Garrison Commander Wei of Black Wood Cliff. Everyone knows who you are.”

Wei Qianqing was one of the five heroes of Duality. However, she was older and not from the same class as the rest. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In the past, she was the First Sister of Duality, not Dugu Lan. She was nearing graduation when Dugu Lan’s group joined.

However, even though she had left, the academy didn’t have another to be the fifth member of the five heroes. That’s why she remained listed as one. After her departure, Dugu Lan became the First Sister since she was the strongest.

She came from a noble and distinguished clan in Metropolis, the Wei. They always had members working as notable officials in every generation.

Qianqing chose the military branch and joined the army to train. She was already strong and quickly soared through the rank, becoming a general first then the commander of Black Wood Cliff.

Keep in mind that Black Wood Cliff was pivotal to the holy ground. Not just anyone could be selected as its commander.

“Miss Xu.” She has heard the events so far and knew who Xu Cuimei was despite it being their first meeting.

“I’m only here to sightsee, don’t mind me.” Xu Cuimei said with a smile.

Qianqing heard that Li Qiye was the golden saber messenger of Vajra. Why was he talking to Xu Cuimei?

“You didn’t come here for nothing.” Li Qiye said.

“I am here to ask for your help, Young Master.” Qianqing stopped thinking about other issues.

“I’m afraid I won’t be of use.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“No, you can, Young Master. I heard that you can control chaos primal beasts, that’s why I need your help.” She said.

“Oh?” He smiled.

Qianqing hesitated to speak because Xu Cuimei was around.

“I guess it’s time for me to leave?” Cuimei touched her chin in a cute manner.

“Speak.” Li Qiye ordered.

Qianqing took a deep breath and revealed: “From my observation, the water in Black Tides will recede soon.”

“?!” Xu Cuimei who has been nonchalant all this time became startled.

“Highly likely.” Qianqing didn’t wish to divulge this to an outsider, especially not someone from Righteous Sect. Alas, she had to obey Li Qiye.

“The signs are pointing to sooner than later.” She elaborated.

“It’s a serious matter.” Cuimei had a solemn expression.

This was surprising to Qianqing. She didn’t expect to be taken seriously right away.

This wasn’t her first time delivering this message. She told numerous big shots before but they didn’t give a damn. They thought that it wouldn’t happen so soon. But now, this girl actually trusted her. The girl’s sincerity made a good impression.

Black Tides was one of the seven forbidden zones. Its water receding was a monumental event.

“It hasn’t been that long since the last generation.” Cuimei frowned: “It had done so once during the end of Eight Stallion Dao Lord. Why is it doing it again now? This is too early, it should be several generations each time.”

Every few generations, the water would recede and monstrous creatures would come onshore.

The most recent occurrence was during the end of the most recent dao lord’s generation - Eight Stallion.

“I told His Majesty and the grandmasters. All the influential characters disagreed.” Qianqing smiled wryly. Of course, she understood the reason why they thought that she was mistaken. It hasn’t been long enough yet.

“In that case, something odd is going on.” Cuimei commented.

Qianqing appreciated the trust shown so she smiled: “Looks like you have done your homework on Black Tides.”

“I’ve only heard about its legends.” Cuimei shrugged and answered: “When the monsters come, Black Wood Cliff will bear the brunt.”

“Yes, the monsters always start at the cliff.” Qianqing agreed. She turned towards Li Qiye and said: “Millions will die in this scenario and the cliff will fall. Without reinforcement from the dynasty, my troops alone can’t last. That’s why I need your help, Young Master. If you can control the chaos primal beasts, you’ll be able to assist us and save the citizens.”

“How many beasts do you think it’ll take to hold Black Wood Cliff?” Li Qiye chuckled.

Qianqing didn’t have a response for this.

“Even Buddha Supreme couldn’t protect the cliff.” Li Qiye added.

In the previous event, Buddha Supreme personally came to fight against the invading monsters to save Black Wood Cliff.

The battle lasted for a long while, eventually seeming futile. Fortunately, Righteous Supreme showed up in the nick of time. The two worked together and pushed the horde back for a period of time. Alas, they seemed to be endless.

Finally, Eight Stallion Dao Lord came and the trio successfully protected Black Wood Cliff.
