Chapter 5038: Missing OneFindd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Wait!” After a while, Yunyun realized something and started going through the corpses again.

“What’s happening?” Goldcrest thought that she was overwhelmed with emotion and became unstable.

“Sis, are you okay?” Ming Shi shuddered.

“She’s fine, she’s just looking for someone.” Li Qiye said.

“Who?” The two of them asked at the same time.

After getting confirmation, Yunyun sat down on the ground, looking a bit confused. She said: “One is missing.”

“Who is it?” Ming Shi didn’t bother analyzing the situation.

Goldcrest remained calm and thought about it before replying: “Yes, I think one is missing.”

“Let me know too!” Ming Shi raised her voice.

Yunyun and Goldcrest exchanged glances while hesitating due to a lack of proof. This was a rather serious matter.

“A conqueror, Phenomena.” Li Qiye answered instead.

“Phenomena Conqueror? He was missing too?” Ming Shi blurted out: “Wait a minute! Don’t tell me, he’s the culprit behind all of this! But no, that can’t be!”

The other two didn’t know what to say. Yunyun was the first to know about this because of Bloodsea Blade.

He talked about the missing conqueror on top of many dragon lords. These dragon lords have been found now but one corpse was still missing.

The other missing cultivators were all connected. One possibility was that he lured them here and devoured them of their power.

This was plausible because he was a four-fruit conqueror on top of possessing peerless talent. He did have the ability to ambush and kill them.

On the other hand, this pertained to the reputation of a great conqueror. They had no solid evidence to accuse him of this horrific crime.

They then recalled how his master came to find Bloodfly God. Did Thousand-faced Sovereign already suspect him? How did Bloodfly God fit into all of this?

“We have no proof.” Yunyun said: “We need to keep our mouth shut or it might be disastrous for our sect.”

“He might still be here in the lower continents.” Ming Shi nervously said.

If they were to spread this information, he might come and kill them.

“The culprit doesn’t matter.” Li Qiye got up and said: “Place them on their stomach.”

“Hmm, should we?” Ming Shi found this disrespectful.

The other two obeyed and lined the corpses up on their stomach. This revealed a faint mark on their back. It resembled a crescent moon - a sign of something missing.

They thought that the culprit had used a seal of sorts to imprint this mark on the victims. However, this seal was incomplete, hence the damaged markings.

‘So the geezer had this trick up his sleeve.’ Li Qiye thought to himself: ‘It’s not a legacy, he simply left it behind as a trump card.’

“What is it?” The youths didn’t know what the mark was.

“Something extraordinary. I have no idea how he got it or understood its mysteries. How interesting.” Li Qiye said.

“So it really is Phenomena Conqueror?” She asked.

“Ming Shi, remember to not speak of this, especially when we’re outside. Not to mention the conqueror, Lunar will come to your lineage and demand an answer.”

“I got it.” Ming Shi stuck her tongue out, aware that this might start a war between two lineages. Lunar would never allow anyone to besmirch its conqueror’s reputation.

“Should we go find Phenomena Conqueror?” Goldcrest asked.

“Where do we start? Plus, the culprit might not be him, we don’t have any absolute proof outside of him being missing.” Yunyun smiled wryly.

“True, maybe he went to the upper continents and didn’t do this. On the other hand, we don’t know where to look for him either.” Ming Shi thought that they were being too hasty with this conclusion.

“The actual culprit might be gone as well, it has been a while since someone has gone missing as far as we know.” Yunyun mused.

Lunar was a possible location to find the conqueror. However, his master came to Demon for more information so this couldn’t be right.

Most importantly, the three of them were helpless against such a powerful being. Thus, Ming Shi stared at Li Qiye.

“What are you looking at me for?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Are you really ignoring this despicable villain that is preying on the land?” She asked.

“Why should I interfere?” He shrugged.

“Because you are unbeatable. The greater the power, the greater the responsibility.” She responded.

“Silly girl, I am not a saint or a savior, this is not any of my business. Let me ask you a question, do you eat pills?”

“Of course.” She answered right away.

“Your precious pills were refined from precious grass or even the inner cores of ancient beasts. Should I interfere and stop this practice when so many cultivators are doing it?” Li Qiye asked.

“Please stop, I don’t want to eat alchemy pills anymore.” She strongly responded.

“Besides, even if I care enough, this is simply a trivial matter.” Li Qiye continued: “Dragon lords kill each other constantly in each generation, the same for conquerors and dao lords. Missing a few is inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, it’s not like the world is being destroyed.”

Ming Shi couldn’t retort this time because Li Qiye had killed several dragon lords not long ago. This culprit had a different process but the outcome was essentially the same.

“Remember, if someone claims to be a savior or acts as such, you need to be careful because one day, they might eat you like a pet rabbit.” Li Qiye stared at her and finished the lesson.
