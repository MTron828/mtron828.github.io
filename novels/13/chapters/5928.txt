Chapter 5928: Remnant Sinners

The sounds came from a flying legion shooting through the air like meteors.

“Rumble!” They landed on the oasis and entered the village. Their auras surged forth like tempestuous tidal waves.

This group was composed of formidable warriors whose armors gleamed with an otherworldly sheen. Their armor was crafted from precious metals, each piece meticulously forged and imbued with intricate patterns of runes. These enchanted armaments exuded an aura of invincibility, capable of deflecting the most potent blows without a scratch.

This group numbered close to a hundred. They gazed and assessed all the villagers.

The latter had never seen experts like this before - these men looked like immortals from the heaven. Thus, they trembled in horror and didn’t dare to say a word.

Mortals had no idea but cultivators could recognize their insignia instantly and become startled.

“Immortal Suppression Dynasty.” Chu Zhu frowned.

“We are the inspectors of Immortal Suppression!” The commander of the group roared and scared the wits out of the mortals.

He looked down on the cowering mortals before noticing Chu Zhu and Li Qiye.

Li Qiye was a mortal not worth mentioning, but Chu Zhu was a different story. Moreover, the statues appeared strange as well.

“Who cast the spell?” The commander demanded an answer.

Although the question was directed at everyone, he was asking Chu Zhu alone. The mortals weren’t worth mentioning, not the young swordsman either.

“So what if I did?” Chu Zhu smiled and flipped his ponytail. Her radiance and confidence were as bright as the sun.

“The inspection teams are tasked with patrolling the realm and observing strange phenomena.” The commander clung to his sense of self-importance, refraining from taking immediate action.

In Sin, cultivators feared the dynasty. Just the name alone struck them like lightning.

It was the strongest and oldest dynasty in Sin, rumored to have been formed by either Mo Shi or his disciple.

Mo Shi was unstoppable and started the war known as Immortals Slaughtered with his allies. Their enemy was a legendary immortal. This war lasted for eras and gave birth to the dynasty. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Its purposes were to wipe out opposing emperors and Ancestors and find the descendants of the immortal.

Immortals Slaughtered was the first of the three immortal wars and involved numerous top masters, culminating with Mo Shi and the immortal dying in the final battle.

After Mo Shi’s era, the dynasty remained in Sin and continued the sweeps, massacring kingdoms and sects once in a while.

They justified this by stating that the targets were descendants of sinners. Their execution brought light back to Sin. None dared to question since for a long period, they were indisputably the strongest sect.

During this golden age, they were in charge of all territories in Sin. Now, they have fallen from this peak due to the rise of other dynasties such as Phantom and Enigma. Nevertheless, they still had two-thirds of all territories, fully in control over the sects and kingdoms within.

Because of this, they still sent out patrolling inspectors to deal with sinners. Once branded, the targets would become subject to the forces of Immortal Suppression.

Li Qiye’s transformation of the outskirts caught their attention, hence the arrival of one team.

Chu Zhu smiled in response, not afraid of the group at all.

“Miss, please state your background.” The commander became serious while gazing at her. He was immensely polite because she didn’t react when he stated the name of his dynasty.

It was one thing for the mortal swordsman to not react. The guy probably had never heard of Immortal Suppression; they were in different worlds. He was not qualified to know about them.

Chu Zhu was a powerful cultivator so she should have reacted accordingly. Moreover, those coming in contact with the inspectors always tried to clarify their innocence. Being branded as sinners could result in sect destruction, not just death.

Her indifference made him feel uneasy. After all, this was such a rare sight.

“No need for that.” She calmly refused.

“Miss, please refrain from causing problems. Identify who you are so we know you’re not a descendant of sinners.” The commander scowled.

“Who gets to decide sinners from otherwise?” Li Qiye stared at him and interjected.

“That is our dynasty’s mission and reason for existence, wiping out remnant sinners to bring light to the world.” The commander sensed his antagonistic attitude.

“Nowadays, those who wish to get rid of sinners are heinous sinners themselves.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“What are you trying to say?” The commander raised his voice.

“Nothing, if you want to wash away others’ sin, others will want to wash away your sin too.” Li Qiye waved his hand.
