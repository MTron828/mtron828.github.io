Chapter 5677: You Understand Me?

“Please refrain from using the scale of a scoundrel to judge a gentleman. It took a lot of effort to gather this head and blood, I’m sure you’re aware.” Li Qiye leaned on the golden skeleton and smiled.

“Gentleman is not the word I would use to describe you.” The dark being said.

“Well, they’re here and as you have said, it is up to your whim.” Li Qiye shrugged.

The being fell into silence.

After a while, it finally spoke: “What treachery are you concocting?”

“Do you have something better for me to scheme? Your inborn body, soul, and blood are all right here.” Li Qiye said: “If I want them, I can just take out your soul and refine you, there is nothing else you can do. Well, maybe this is actually a good idea, I can refine your body into a nice weapon as well.”

Having said that, he patted the skeleton and said: “What kind of weapon should I make? I should imbue your trinity soul into it as well, that’s an easy epoch treasure. I have to be meticulous with the crafting though since you have lived too long and its divinity has diminished slightly.” Li Qiye said.

“Hmph.” The being scowled.

“What should I name it?” Li Qiye went on: “Trinity Artifact? Or Chaos Anima Artifact?”

“You wouldn’t go through all this trouble for a paragon artifact.” The being uttered coldly.

“Then you tell me, how else are you useful to me? What other values do you possess outside of your skeleton and true soul?” Li Qiye smiled: “That’s why I kept on telling people how good of a man I am. I’m not going to refine you since you are Trinity Ancestor, the progenitor and defender of an epoch. Although you have fallen to the darkness, you haven’t done anything that bad, no devouring yet. No one is perfect in this mortal world, recognizing mistakes and correcting them is the greatest virtue, so I am giving you a chance at resurrection.”

The dark being naturally didn’t buy it. The guy had sound logic because everything he had was up for the taking. Everyone coveted his inborn dao chaos physique and inborn trinity true soul. Nothing else came close to their value.

“The Dark Crow does no good deed without something in return.” He sneered.

“Sigh, I give up. Your head and blood are right here, it’s your problem now. The question is, do you want to be the magnificent protector known as Trinity Ancestor or the guest of Celestial Court who is suppressed by his own body? That’s entirely up to you.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“I will cease to exist after the rebirth.” The dark being said.

“Yes, a true rebirth will also cause your demise, you know yourself better than anyone, an epoch progenitor will not let corruption be in control.” Li Qiye nodded.

“You’re using me as a weapon.” The being tried to guess Li Qiye’s intention.

“Why would I? Even if you somehow return to your peak after rebirth, I can still kill you if I want to. Not useful in the slightest.” Li Qiye said.

The being didn’t like this response.

“Don’t be annoyed, I am just speaking the truth. You might feel superior to me since you’re older and I was born in your epoch. After all, how could anyone be your equal, the source of an epoch?” Li Qiye shrugged: “In reality, you’re not much compared to the current me. You’re not older than the imprisoned geezers, not stronger either. I still killed them all the same.”

He paused for a bit before continuing: “You at your prime in that prison would have been nothing more than a meal.”

“Your result would have been the same in the absence of that primordial light.” The being sneered.

“I can’t deny that but you, the source of an epoch, did you have the courage to enter the tigers’ den?” Li Qiye smiled.

“What do you want?” The being could tell that Li Qiye wanted his rebirth but for what reason? The guy didn’t go through all this trouble out of kindness.

“Just trying to do a good deed, that’s all. I guess people just don’t take me seriously, do I have such a disgusting face? Always being viewed as a scheming beast.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“A scheming beast is a generous description of you after what you did in Heavenrealm.” The being said.

“Well, I suppose you do have a point, now I’m beginning to question myself, what am I scheming?” Li Qiye nodded and stroked his chin.

“I see, you wish for me to pave the road.” The being speculated.

“What road?” Li Qiye shrugged.

“You wish to kill Derivation and Primal’s group but you don’t know where they are hiding. That is why you’re here.” The being concluded.

“That’s one possibility. Don’t you remember how they killed your son, devouring every piece of flesh of his dao chaos physique. I heard he screamed in misery, such a tragic end. Have you never thought about avenging him?” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Hah, I have attachments to nothing in this world.” The being said: “Who hasn’t killed before? You killed plenty of sons before, this is as normal as can be.”

“I almost forgot, you’re not Trinity Ancestor but just a fallen true soul. But when you get resurrected as Trinity Ancestor, I wonder if you will try to wipe out those bastards.” Li Qiye said.

This left the dark being in silence.

“I think you would.” Li Qiye said: “You all never liked each other anyway. Hah, Primal Ancestor thought that you were just lucky enough to be born early, to be blessed with those inborn gifts. Otherwise, he would have rubbed you against the ground, leaving you no chance to be imperious.”
