Chapter 4929: PawningDiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Children, the time to pawn is now.” The old man said: “Take out whatever you don’t need even if it’s a broken flower pot.”

He tapped on the red sack and added: “Inside this are celestial treasures and supreme dao arts, I would go even as far as using the word ‘immortal’ to describe some of them…”

This excited the crowd right away. Their eyes flashed brightly but they didn’t notice the old man’s expression.

A more neutral party would view him as a merchant trying to trick innocent children. Of course, he greatly exaggerated as well, wanting to advertise his items.

Alas, the students truly believed the historical precedent and ignored his shady demeanor and speech. After all, even conquerors were created by this event.

“Anything will do?” One student shouted.

“Of course, whatever you don’t need at home, even a soiled underwear when you were younger. On the other hand, a top treasure will do as well. Remember, there is only one chance.” The old man said.

Many students laughed after hearing the joke.

“So I can pick up a random stone and pawn it?” Another became curious.

“Indeed, but just one chance.” The old man laughed.

“Idiot, still want everything for nothing?” A knowledgeable student snorted: “No sincerity at all, you won’t get anything.”

The rules were rather clear - everyone had one chance. It didn’t matter what the chosen item was; it could be a rock or a piece of cloth.

Some believed that the exchange was not equivalent. However, most didn’t buy it. They believed that there must be some sincerity involved.

Those who wanted the best treasures while giving up nothing couldn’t possibly win. Therefore, most took the exchange rather seriously.

“Do you really have those great treasures?” One student asked.

“Of course, the best of the best.” The old man patted his sack and said: “This is your opportunity to get what you want. If you dare to imagine your wildest dream, it will be in here.”

“Then you have the best weapons as well. Are you not afraid of someone robbing you?” Another asked.

The old man only smiled without answering.

“That’s suicidal. An ancient god believed in his power before and was obliterated.” An older student responded instead.

“Moonbreaker Wolf.” A different student took a deep breath and remarked.

In reality, some had attempted this before. A particularly famous example was Moonbreaker Wolf - a monster with ten sacred fruits. He waited in Abroad until the event for an ambush, only to go down as a tragic reminder.

According to the legend, he was captured by the old man and thrown into the sack, never to appear again.

Thus, top masters themselves didn’t dare to try, let alone the students.

“Okay, children, let’s get started. We don’t have much time.” The old man smiled heartily, looking like a peddler selling subpar merchandise to ignorant children.

“I’ll try.” Someone became impatient but his friend pulled him back.

“Don’t be the first, I’ve heard that the first trader always had the worst luck.” The friend whispered.

It’s clear that those aware of this were hesitant and waited for someone else.

“Really?” The student asked.

“Yes, the probability of winning is already low. The odds are worst for the first and last.” The friend said confidently.

However, one youth wearing a tight robe defied this belief. He walked forward, accompanied by a pure aura. Though it wasn’t oppressive, it granted him an everlasting presence. Everything else including dao power was forced into the rotation.

Students trembled and didn’t dare to get close to him.

“The young noble of Reincarnation City, Qing Songke.” Everyone in Abroad knew who he was - a genius on the same level as Yunyun and the others. He came from one of the twelve lineages - Reincarnation.

He came closer and bowed toward the old man: “Sir, I heard that our Greenmountain Conqueror had obtained a fortune from you, an amazing scroll. May I ask if this is the truth?”

Everyone listened attentively because they were aware of the popular tale.

“Too many young friends have come and I don’t remember.” The old man was not interested and waved his hand: “If you want to pawn something, do it, there is a long line behind you.”

Songke took a deep breath. Though he wasn’t from Time Mountain as the conqueror, he had always viewed Greenmountain as an idol.

He wanted to participate in the pawning process and become a second Greenmountain Conqueror.

Thus, he gritted his teeth and made up his mind. He took out a box and opened it, revealing a gentle glow.

He handed it to the old man and said: “This is our city’s Heaventouched Water Jade. I am pawning it.”

“Damn!” Many students blurted out.

This was a special product from the city. Only one would appear every thousand years.

The old man didn’t bother looking at it. He put it away and untied the sack, demanding: “Go, one chance.”
