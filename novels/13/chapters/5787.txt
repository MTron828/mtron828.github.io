Chapter 5788: I’m Old Now

World Emperor staggered backward, needing to stabilize his energy after the below.

“Fellow Daoist, how impressive.” Jiao Heng said with a smile.

“Can’t compare to you.” World Emperor said seriously.

“We can try again, this is rather fun.” Jiao Heng hasn’t had enough.

“Feel free to keep going, I will not back down.” World Emperor looked ready to lift the high heaven itself; nothing could get through him.

“Fighting normally gets boring.” Jiao Heng said: “This mech is one of a kind even when considering the numerous epochs, I can’t miss the opportunity of being its pilot. It seems like I can’t fully draw out its true potential.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He was addicted to this game, hoping to find an opponent strong enough for him to test it out. Demon’s group crumbled too quickly and made him lose interest.

World Emperor, on the other hand, seemed more of a worthy adversary.

“Stories of your sweeping through the continent are still around, why not come out and fight, show me your invincible style?” World suggested.

“No need for that.” Jiao Heng refused: “I’m old now, can’t fight three thousand emperors or sweep through the thirteen continents like before. I'd rather use this mech than work my old bones.”

In theory, a great emperor such as Jiao Heng should be prideful. Moreover, he had the power to match anyone including World Emperor.

Anyone else in his position would accept the challenge, especially when it came from another legendary figure.

Unfortunately, Jiao Heng didn’t fall into this trap and preferred to pilot the mech. He followed his whim instead of convention.

“Fellow Daoist, I wonder how long your unbeatable armament can last, let’s try.” He seemed eager to resume the fun and raised the mech’s hands again.

“Activate!” World Emperor knew that he needed to go all out against a grand-completion paragon artifact.

“Boom!” He released all of his wills and vitality, riding the ocean of Moon Embrace. His anima power activated the true potential of the armament.

The water and the moon combined, turning into a heavenly shield.

“Infinite Waves!” His power pushed forward endlessly, propelling the shield forward.

“Shatter!” Another smash descended against the shield.

“Bam!” The impact caused spectators to split out blood in shock.

“One more time!” Jiao Heng finally met someone capable of withstanding his attacks and tried again.

If Elder Galaxy were not one of the nine heavenly treasures, its internal dimensions would have been obliterated.

As the barrage continued, World’s trusted armor finally showed signs of cracking.

“I’m coming!” Immortal Emperor Ren Xian and Immortal Emperor Fan Chen abandoned their battle and rushed toward the heavenly shield.

Ren Xian raised his Azure Omniplate as if grasping the high heaven as a defensive barrier. Fan Chen chose to go on the offensive instead, smashing the mech with his crystal bulwark.

“Boom!” Their interference sent weaker combatants flying and vomiting blood.

“Get lost!” At this time, Nightmoon shouted and fiercely infused power into her bottle, smashing Sword Emperor.

He couldn’t withstand the blow despite being protected by the ancestral talisman, leaving room for Nightmoon to join the others.

“Now it’s getting more interesting.” Jiao Heng’s excitement grew after seeing a total of four opponents.

“You all possess immortal armaments renowned for their defensive capabilities, are they enough to stop a grand-completion paragon artifact? If they can’t then Celestial Court will win today.” Jiao Heng said.

“Bring it.” World took the vanguard, focusing solely on defense and creating the outer layer with his Moon Embrace. He became clad in solid armor as if heaven and earth were molded onto his body.

“Let’s begin.” Ren Xian also created magnificent azure walls with his treasure, harmonizing with World Emperor’s heavenly shield.

“Got it!” Fan Chen raised his crystal bulwark. It became resplendent, releasing stars to form a cosmic crab constellation.

Its claws sealed all affinities and patched up all openings and vulnerabilities before stacking with the existing defensive lines.
