Chapter 4162: Sword Burial Zone

It didn’t take long before the great powers gathered their troops. The sword resonations also woke up slumbering ancestors.

“The zone is finally back.” One ancient ancestor from a mighty kingdom suddenly sat up and gazed forward.

“Incredible weapons will be appearing.” A timeworn existence inside a shrine from a dynasty also opened his eyes.

This also happened in Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom. In a remote ancestral ground were numerous pagodas. In one of them, a peerless being had lightning coursing through his eyes. He gazed at the sky and said: “A heavenly sword is within grasp?”

In Nine-wheel Citadel was a floating tower surrounded by chaos and dao laws. Amidst this constant rotation of affinities was a slumbering cultivator. The cultivator woke up and gave the order: “It’s time to visit Sword Burial.”

At a domain with billowing violet energy, another top master with omniscient eyes told someone nearby: “An all-out battle, how ominous.”

Inside a particular sword ground, a transcending beauty without any flashy aura said softly: “Time to embark.”

In just a short time, numerous ancient ancestors and top cultivators came out of their isolated cultivation. They sat at the apex and knew that a storm of carnage and death was about to sweep through the continent.

The news of the zone’s appearance traveled across the land.

“Let the eligible disciples go take a look, perhaps they’ll get lucky.” One ancestor ordered.

“Gather our disciples, we’ll enter the zone right away.” A royal lord told his sect members.

Many great powers prepared for mobilization, wanting to become the lucky ones just like the legends.

“I’m sure it will appear in the Barren Lands.” An old cultivator speculated.

“No, it should be at the Dragon War Plains, it appeared there three times already in the past but not recently.” His friend disagreed.

“Not necessarily, I’ve heard of changes happening at Southwater. It might be there.” A sect master joined in.

Speculations of the location arose. A few were based on reasons while others were ridiculous. The latter crowd wanted to spread misinformation.

Some were quite convincing and led others to run there. Alas, the ancestors thought that it was only a ruse to make others waste time.

Everyone wanted to be the first to enter the zone. That’s why lies were spread across the continent. Who wouldn’t want to become a being as great as the sword-using dao lords?

Eventually, all swords at the Dragon War Plains started resonating at the same time.

“The zone will appear at the Dragon War Plains!” A nearby cultivator shouted and celebrated.

“Clank!” A sword hymn echoed across the nine heavens and ten earths. Sword rays poured down like waterfalls and tore apart the sky vault. Even the sun paled in comparison.

“This is it! It’s really appearing in the plains!” Those closest to this region were ecstatic and rushed for the light source.

“Wait.” A few experienced ancestors stopped their disciples.

“Clank!” An ocean of swords finally manifested in the air. Their frightening energies engulfed the region.

“An immortal sword is descending!” An expert who has heard of a legend flew as fast as possible over.

It didn’t take long before thousands and thousands of cultivators arrived, not wanting to fall behind.

“Clank!” The swords in the oceans suddenly activated and started flying chaotically, piercing through everything.

“What the hell?!” The first wave of cultivators was mortified at this sight, unable to react in time.

The result was obvious - screams and blood filled the area. Thousands were pierced or pinned down on the ground by the swords.

“Activate!” The strongest cultivators used their mighty treasures and defensive merit laws to stop the incoming swords.

Unfortunately, the rain of swords still pierced through their defensive lines and killed them.

Only the strongest characters reacted in time and fled with great speed. They then observed from a distance.

Thus, the victims were primarily weaker and inexperienced cultivators. They were blinded with greed and died to the sword rain.

Once the swords touched the ground or stopped, rust spots appeared all over. They became worthless metal, not worth a single coin.

“What is happening?” A youth didn’t understand. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The torrent earlier was so powerful and killed everyone. The swords were divine but now, they became useless in the blink of an eye.

“They were scrap metals from the start, that power belonged to Sword Burial.” One ancestor said: “However, there are special swords in there. See that flashing light, that’s a divine sword.”

He and many others immediately rushed over in that direction but it was too late.

The so-called divine sword drilled into the ground and disappeared from sight.

“What a shame.” They lamented.

“Where did it go?” The youth asked his ancestor.
