“Sigh, such stupidity from top to bottom, attempting a coup with such meager force and a clear lack of prudence. Only a group of ants trying to shake a tree, or the foundation of an entire system.” Li Qiye watched and commented while the two giants were fighting.

He was now resting his head on Yalan’s lap while Miaozhen was peeling a type of grape resembling gems to feed him. Meanwhile. Shaoyao focused on brewing tea and making dessert.

A debaucherous ruler of the universe; what more could one ask for in life?

The spectators had no words to describe their emotions, especially the young ones who had a crush on the girls.

These were the Three Ladies of Longevity Valley; so many fell in love at first sight with them. But now, all three were waiting on Li Qiye - something that only existed in fantasies.

No one dared to retort. There was a prevalent belief that Longevity Valley had declined and became weaker than Everlasting. Now, this devilish First Disciple was doing whatever he wanted with Silver Dragon Legion.

“Rumble!” The two giants continued to punish the sky, causing the sun and moon to lose their radiance.

The wooden giant was broken in many places but its life force was still vigorous. The longer the fight, the fierce it became. On the other hand, the metal being with the upper hand was showing fatigue in true energy.

After all, the carapace was made up of the vitality of the soldiers. The true stones engraved on their armors were channeling their energy. After a while, they would become deplete unlike the wooden giant under the protection of the divine tree.

“Activate!” Silver Dragon Legion had to go all out. Their roar echoed across the mountains.

Back on a peak in a palace of Everlasting, a massive platform emerged. In the blink of an eye, boundless light accumulated, even brighter than the stars above. It resembled the most luminous diamond in the world, illuminating all of Longevity System.

It shot out a pulse crossing through the world, all the way from Everlasting to Alchemy Hut, and landed on the metal carapace.

A small portal appeared behind the carapace with a vortex within. It accepted the pulsing current.

The entire thing erupted with power that reverberated across the realms. Majestic halos started to pulse, initiating the changing of three thousand worlds. In short, this metal being had just become ten times stronger. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What is that?” The spectators turned toward Everlasting, the source of the pulse.

The bright platform on that peak was too far away to see. True Gods needed to use their heavenly gaze and saw an altar engraved with numerous true stones.

It was massive in size and looked like a pot with true stones at the True God level and up; some were even at the Ascender and Eternal level.

The energy from them gathered at a single point before the formation condensed it into a pulsing current. This pulse traveled through the world to reach the carapace, empowering it with a new source.

“Amazing.” One clan ancestor’s expression changed: “As long as Silver Dragon Legion is still in Longevity System, this pulse will be able to fuel it nonstop. No wonder why this legion is so strong.”

“Such wealth and resources, far richer than many other sects.” A True God blurted out after seeing the extravagant altar. Everlasting was indeed prosperous after many generations of selling alchemy goods.

“Take it down!” The carapace roared and went into a frenzy as it tore a hand off the wood giant.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” The increase of power in this berserk state overwhelmed the wood giant.

Despite its incredible regeneration, the rate of destruction was even greater. A few parts were being continuously destroyed before they could come back together.

Finally, the carapace had earned its victory and finished off the wooden giant - an incredible spectacle. The space behind the giant collapsed as well. The tree disappeared as if it was only an illusion.

“Damn, so ferocious!” The supporters of Everlasting shouted, finally feeling relief at this development.

“Strong indeed. That’s why they can defeat so many other sects.” Even the loyalist faction had to admit.

“Brat, crawl over here and accept your death!” The imperious carapace looked down at Li Qiye as if he was an ant.

All eyes were on Li Qiye to see how he would answer the taunt.

In fact, Everlasting felt so much better. They finally brought it back to even.

“Does he have anything else?” The loyalists became worried because this carapace was unreasonably strong in this berserk state.

“Hmph, Everlasting is unfathomable. This is only the warm-up, resistance is futile and suicidal.” An expert on Everlasting’s side sneered.

His comment was to encourage himself while cheering on Everlasting. After all, they have chosen Everlasting and there was no coming back. All they could do now was pray for its victory. Otherwise, their fate would be quite grim in the future.

In case of defeat, not only would Everlasting be destroyed, traitors like them wouldn’t fare much better either.

“Oh? So arrogant now.” Li Qiye didn’t care at all: “Like a wretched-looking tramp who finally came into some money, wanting to show off before everyone. Well, congratulation, I’m sure that round wasn’t easy for your kingdom. It’ll be a nice topic to brag about.”

The carapace slowly descended before finally landing on the altar. It stood there with a grim expression, or at least it gave off that air on its emotionless, metallic face.

“It’s not too late to surrender now or you will suffer a fate worse than death.” A Dragon Sovereign spoke from inside the carapace: “Today, Everlast will not only kill you but also trample Longevity Valley.”

They no longer tried to hide their intention. In the beginning, there were justifications about exterminating the heretical faction. This was no longer the case.

“So brave, finally revealing your true intentions.” Li Qiye clapped and said.

“Come out and die!” The carapace repeated.
