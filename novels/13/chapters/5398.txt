Chapter 5399: Anima WorldVisjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The moment the thrust gained emotions, it lost its initial edge.

Supreme decisively tossed his sword away and used the dao as a sword - another emotionless style straight for All-things’ forehead.

Its transcending nature could make targets scream in joy, seemingly happy to be put to rest by the technique. Of course, All-things didn’t succumb to its marvelous beauty.

Since his affinity was based on life, it also bred emotions to once again stop the sword dao. This was far from being their first fight.

The previous ones had no real conclusion since they both had advantages and disadvantages when facing each other.

A battle between emotions and the almighty void - truly an epic and poetic duel.

“Buzz.” A dao beam suddenly came from the flick of a finger, capable of controlling the cosmo.

“Boom!” All-things Dao Lord’s life expanse couldn’t stop the beam since it was actually superior to Supreme’s emotionless slashes.

He turned around and saw a cultivator capable of suppressing all existences. His expression darkened as he uttered the opponent’s title: “Eternal.”

The power of Eternal’s bloodline engulfed the battlefield. All-things didn’t have an immortal bloodline so he couldn’t contend in this aspect.

“A favor must be repaid.” Eternal said, blocking All-things from leaving by just standing there.

“You wish to help him?” All-things remained calm.

“Brother, we have no choice since it has escalated to this point.” Supreme answered instead.

There existed a stark contrast between Supreme and Illumination. Supreme’s actions have earned him infamy and curses.

However, when one stood before Supreme and fought him, they couldn’t help being affected by his charisma, thinking he was a respectable foe. The same couldn’t be said about Illumination Conqueror.

While not being in his presence, they would want to slap him once or twice. Once actually staring at him, it became tough to actually hate him.

At the very least, Supreme never tried to hide his ambition by spewing noble rhetoric as if he were a savior. Illumination, on the other hand, always shielded his actions as if he was killing only for the betterment of The People.

“Brother Supreme, you must have been waiting a long time for this day.” All-things said.

“Not quite, but this is a rather good opportunity. If I don’t kill you today, I’ll still gift you a serious injury.” Supreme admitted.

“You want to take care of me first and then Illumination.” All-things understood.

“Isn’t that exactly what you want? For me to kill Illumination?” Supreme said, possessing a unique elegance and charisma.

“I’m ashamed to say that you are correct.” All-things let out a sigh.

After all, the best outcome would be for Supreme to kill Illumination Conqueror and even destroy Azure School.

He had no reason to hide this because Illumination was a true threat to Dao Alliance and The People. Peace was not possible as long as he was still alive.

Alas, All-things couldn’t be the one to deal the finishing blow. In a sense, that would actually aid Illumination’s goal.

He would become a martyr while All-things would be viewed as a despicable backstabber. This would only increase the current tension in Dao Alliance. Conversely, his death at the hands of Supreme would improve The People’s solidarity.

“Your wish is definitely the best plan.” Supreme said.

“Your best plan includes my head as well.” All-things smiled in response.

“Will you grant me my wish then?” Supreme asked.

“Make your move then, it’ll be an honor if I can play a part in fulfilling your wish.” All-things summoned his world again.

“Born from all things, create all things, I can see it now, my eternal anima…” All-things chanted and revealed his immortal shell.

His anima tree appeared and released bright particles, granting him its power.

His entire world returned to its origin - every blade of grass and living creature saw their true selves and obtained anima.

“From life to anima, from anima to manifestation…” He continued chanting.

Meanwhile, Supreme and Eternal gave him time to channel his power.

“Incredible, a world created from anima.” Eternal said with respect.
