Chapter 4683: Untethered Vajra Again

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Those in the valley immediately unsheathed their sword and released their energy.

“True Immortal Sword Saint.” Jian Ming was surprised to see this group.

The sword saint was another title for True Immortal Saintess since she was the best sword user in their young generation.

She led a group of members here to slay the best and obtain the grass. It was currently growing on a lake, gaining nutrients from the pure water. Of course, the lake also benefited from its presence, making it symbiotic.

The grass itself had a color true to its name on top of looking like a soaring stallion. It looked animated and spiritual. Its violet aura permeated throughout the entire valley.

A deep breath was comfortable on top of loosening the pores - a sign of the grass’ value.

“Li Qiye.” The saintess furrowed her brows after seeing him.

She currently led a group of elite disciples from True Immortal for training. Any of them could dominate the outside world.

Moreover, they were capable of forming a mighty sword formation. Under her leadership, they had greatly contributed to the sect by taking down capable enemies. All of them looked austere after seeing Li Qiye.

By this point, he has been more than a thorn to their side, killing one of their geniuses after another.

“Nice grass.” Jian Ming salivated after seeing it, aware of its value.

“Looks like a celestial horse indeed.” The daoist said.

“We found this place first and killed the guardian beast, the grass belongs to us.” The saintess glared at Li Qiye.

“I never said I wanted to rob you, we’re just passing by.” Li Qiye glanced at the grass and said.

“But this is so precious…” Jian Ming complained. This grass might not be comparable to Three Thousand Dao’s version but it was still extremely valuable.

“It’s no big deal.” Li Qiye waved his hand and stuck to his words.

The saintess heaved a sigh of relief and cupped her fist: “I apologize for misunderstanding your intention, Fellow Daoist.”

Her attitude surprised the duo. They thought that she would try to avenge her fallen sect members. This didn’t seem to be the case.

“Phew, I’m here just in time.” An old man suddenly appeared in the valley, heaving for breath while wiping away the sweat on his forehead. He wore an embroidered robe while his skin had a bronze complexion.

“Him again? What is he doing here?” Jian Ming whispered after seeing Untethered Vajra.

Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile.

“Senior.” The saintess said: “You came too?”

“Yes, for this grass.” The vajra revealed.

She frowned and said: “Senior, we found it first and have killed the guardian beast.”

“Incorrect.” He responded: “I came way earlier than you but had to lead the real beast king out. What you killed is only a baby one. This grass is precious enough to warrant a true monster guarding it, not something so weak. Since I put in the effort of dealing with the real beast, this grass naturally belongs to me.”

“We got a show.” Jian Ming told the daoist.

The saintess grimaced, not expecting him to be so insistent. Whether he told the truth or not didn’t matter.

Normally, no one dared to compete with True Immortal. Moreover, the sect had good ties with Untethered Vajra as well.

She cupped her fist and said softly: “Senior, this grass is very important to us, please do us a favor, we’ll certainly repay you with other treasures.”

She made it clear that she wouldn’t yield.

“I shouldn’t refuse your kind intention, not to mention my relationship with True Immortal.” The vajra stroked his chin: “However, my little girl needs this grass to strengthen her grand dao. I’m afraid I can’t give it up, do you mind?”

It became abundantly clear that both sides didn’t want to give it up.

“I apologize, Senior, we must obtain this grass.” She said firmly. As a direct disciple of True Immortal Sect Master, she wasn’t one to acquiesce to others.

“Then you’ll have to excuse me.” The vajra walked toward the grass.

“Clank!” The elites from True Immortal instantly activated their sword formation. Runes appeared in the air along with rampaging sword energies. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Impressive.” The daoist praised.

“The Thirty-six Sword Formation of True Immortal, not bad at all.” The vajra praised.

The saintess unsheathed her sword as well and displayed her mighty aura.

“Senior, please do not take one more step or we’ll have to attack.” She powerfully declared.

“Get ready then. Soaring Dragon!” The vajra roared.

A heavenly dragon surged into the sky with a golden radiance. It rushed straight toward the sword formation.

“Start!” The saintess commanded and energy swords manifested into reality.
