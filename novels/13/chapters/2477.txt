Others only saw Li Qiye and Liu Chuqing playing around and enjoying the scenery. However, she had an amazing harvest during the trip.

Meanwhile, the reclusive Qin Jianyao suddenly held an event and invited many prodigies and talents. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It’s rare for everyone to gather at Nine-linked Mountains, so I invited everyone to the stone forest so that we can get to know each other.” Jianyao said.

The sudden event at the stone forest caught some people off guard because she has been staying behind closed doors after coming to Nine-linked Mountains, not meeting anyone outside of Yang Bofan and Tang Hexiang.

“It’s to be expected.” The experienced ancestors have predicted this.

“Calm Lotus Monastery is finally choosing to participate, wanting to divide the world after Lucidity King’s departure.” They could read her like a book.

During the reign of Lucidity, Calm Lotus couldn’t share the royal reign at all and had retreated from any power struggle.

With his end came their beginning. Because of this, their successor finally showed herself in these tumultuous times.

“Looks like they have made up their minds about their candidate.” Another ancestor realized something and shuddered.

This sect had two secrets so they were quite unfathomable. No one could take them on outside of War Saint Dynasty led by Lucidity. The other four great powers couldn’t begin to touch them.

In fact, in Nine Secrets right now, every single person and sect were paying attention to their choice. They had the whole world in their grasp.

“Is it Tang Hexiang or Eight Formation True Emperor?” This question lingered in everyone’s mind.

Both Tang Hexiang and Eight Formation True Emperor were quite evenly matched. If one of them could gain Jianyao’s support, they would definitely be able to seize the throne.

The older experts knew that this sudden event was premeditated and could very well determine the fate of this generation.

Thus, anxiety and excitement permeated the crowd.

Unlike the insightful masters, the younger cultivators cared more about the list of invitees. For these youths, especially the genius, being invited by her was an honor and a proof of their status. Plus, they would have a chance to get close to her. That’s why everyone was waiting for their invitation card.

Though she never really participated in political affairs, this event was swiftly carried out. Plenty of cards were sent right after the announcement. In fact, the requirement for entry this time was relatively lenient.

Of course, it was all relative. The invitees were still famous youths consisting of mainly geniuses and incredible talents.

Because of this, the lucky ones became quite excited after receiving their letter and earning her sect’s recognition - an honor indeed.

“I’m so proud of myself, being able to participate in Fairy Qin’s party.” One genius exclaimed.

Ma Jinming was among the first group to receive an invitation. He laughed heartily and said: “Fairy Qin is insanely insightful and visionary. I will do my best if she ever requires anything of me.”

He has been brooding about not getting an audience from her in the past. However, to be among the first wave of invitation wiped away any grievances.

Eventually, the prodigies in Nine-linked Mountains have received an invitation, same with some of the older experts.

Of course, the crowd still consisted primarily of younger people from Nine Secrets. The ancestors could tell that she was using this to establish her own position and gain some prestige.

After the last wave, some meticulous people noticed that she didn’t invite a particular person.

“Fairy Qin didn’t invite the king.” The person who noticed this became surprised.

After all, in terms of status among the young generation and even the previous, the king was on top. He had total authority before despite losing it now. This didn’t diminish the innate nobility within him but she still didn’t send an invitation.

“How strange that the fairy to not invite him.” The youths were surprised.

After all, the first thing she did after coming here was visiting him. It seemed that there was some consideration to be had at first, but the lack of an invitation now was truly puzzling.

A genius thought that he understood the matter and sneered: “Hmph, she acted based on his status but when she actually met him, she found that he was a piece of trash so she left.”

“Looks like he can’t enter her sight. This really shows that he isn’t worth a single coin.” Many geniuses agreed.

“Maybe Calm Lotus Monastery has abandoned the king since he has no value to be taken advantage of.” An older expert also felt this way.

“Well, perhaps that sect has a different candidate to be the next king.” An ancestor took it to the next step.

He thought that maybe Jianyao was going to reveal some news about the next king. Inviting the previous would only lead to unnecessary conflict.

Of course, many didn’t care at all and focused on taking advantage of this opportunity by putting on a commendable front. No one wanted to waste energy worrying about the trash king.

They didn’t care about Li Qiye, but Li Qiye surely didn’t care about them for the same perceived reason.

In the next few days, he spent his time leading Chuqing around the area - the main mountains and the nine lakes.

She had an incredible harvest thanks to his guidance. Her comprehension of the word Qian was improving at a rapid rate. She only needed time for training and polishment before obtaining a precious dao heart - Li Qiye was confident in this.

“What does one become after understanding all nine secrets?” The innocent girl had a strange thought and asked Li Qiye along the way.

“What do you mean? They’ll still be a human, not suddenly turn into a monster or anything. The progenitor finished all nine and he remained a progenitor, not an immortal.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“Oh, I see.” Chuqing was embarrassed by the question since it’s not like no one has done it before. It’s just that in the present, people only had access to one or two, so it was hard to imagine the result of cultivating all nine.

“Maybe only the progenitor can finish training in these precious words.” Her training under two words right now gave her a clearer understanding of their abilities. She thought that someone capable of finishing all nine must be extraordinary.

“The most precious thing in the system isn’t the nine secret words.” Li Qiye gently shook his head.

“No? What is it then?” Chuqing was frightened and remained a skeptic.

Everyone knew that the nine secrets were the very foundation and core of the system, precious beyond imagination. What could actually be more valuable in this land?

“Nine-linked Mountains.” Li Qiye casually said.

Liu Chuqing immediately looked around this beautiful place and scratched her head: “Are you saying that there are hidden treasure groves buried under this place?”

Li Qiye shook his head: “Those aren’t necessarily precious either. The nine secrets and treasures are not the most precious thing. Don’t judge using a layman’s vision. There’s a reason why your progenitor was able to pass down this system, and why Nine-linked Mountains has been standing strong for so long.”

“I see...” Chuqing didn’t quite understand.

The two of them finally made it through the eight lakes. Only one was left.

They appreciated its scenic beauty, a boundless expanse of blue water.

“That’s Xiang Island over there.” Over yonder across the mist and fog was an island - a scene as beautiful as a painting. She couldn’t help but remind Li Qiye.

“We’ll return after finishing this lake.” Li Qiye gave it a quick glance but didn’t care too much.

They were waiting at a relatively small dock. Many other cultivators were waiting as well and immediately noticed these two.
