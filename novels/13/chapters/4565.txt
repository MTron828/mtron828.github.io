Chapter 4566: Seven-seal True God

The monarchs in the present day didn’t dare to underestimate this historical figure. They swallowed their pride and accepted their inferiority.

Li Qiye also stared at Everlasting Monarch. To be exact, his focus was on the monarch’s waist.

There was something resembling a scented pouch. It seemed out of place for the monarch to have one since this was something slightly feminine. [1]

However, upon closer inspection, there were faint rays flashing within. Something seemed to be alive and wiggling in there. Its movement was the source of the rays.

Despite the lack of intensity, the profound rays could be the oldest and purest of their type. They could be the source of time itself.

“Using dao truths as threads, not bad at all.” Li Qiye commented.

Dao truths were inscrutable. They were meant to be comprehended and didn’t have a corporeal form. However, someone managed to make a bag out of them. This was heaven-defying, to say the least.

In other words, the rays inside weren’t weak. It’s just that the pouch itself was incredible, capable of storing all things and hiding them. On the other hand, the thing inside must be incredible to be exuding rays still visible to outsiders.

“Something left behind by the old immortal.” Lin Mo commented, not leaving with her group members.

By this point, everyone understood what True Immortal came from.

“So what’s inside?” Jian Ming stared curiously at the pouch.

The daoist started rubbing his fingers to calculate. However, he suddenly stopped out of fear.

“Everlasting Monarch is one of the few where the word invincible is not an exaggeration.” Wise Ancestor stared at him and said: “His sect is here not to show him respect and see him off to the next journey, only to take back that item. I can’t possibly fathom what is inside since they already have so many wondrous artifacts.”

True Immortal had a total of seven dao lords. Therefore, they have accumulated a frightening amount of artifacts and peerless treasures.

Treasures the world considered to be priceless were nothing more than common items in their eyes. Today, they specifically came for something, meaning that it might be the only one of its kind.

Figures began descending from the clouds. Terrible auras immediately engulfed the region like multiple tsunamis hitting at the same time just like an apocalypse. Numerous cultivators were forced to the ground again, unable to lift their head. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The figures were gigantic. One had wings and another had a divine halo behind his head. They looked like gods and devils…

“The first elder, Decapitation Godmonarch.” One of them had a saber on his shoulder. The presence of the saber dao was overwhelming; the individual ray could split people in half.

“Their last-gen sect master is here too, Seven-seal True God.” Someone noticed an old man with runic totems and mystical seals behind him.

“Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor, I believe the current sect master was from his branch, he was only a child who listened to lectures.” A spectator said.

His aura was of the sealing affinity. There seemed to be a colossal palm blocking out the sky. An ancient ancestor from True Immortal was rather elusive. Today, the crowd had the pleasure of seeing one.

True Immortal clearly mobilized numerous experts. Just the three of them were enough to wipe out many great powers.

“Your unfilial descendants greet you, Ancestor.” The sect master of True Immortal prostrated in the direction of Everlasting Monarch.

The other members of True Immortal did the same. Alas, the monarch didn’t bother looking at them.

“Ancestor, your descendants respectfully request a little bit of your time.” The members of True Immortal exchanged glances before bowing again.

This didn’t work either. All of their eyes focused on the scented pouch tied to the monarch’s waist ribbon.

“I don’t think a patrimony weapon would make True Immortal so restless.” One cultivator whispered.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that True Immortal had the most dao lord artifacts and merit laws.

One dao lord weapon would be priceless for regular cultivators. War could be started over one. However, this wasn’t the case for True Immortal.

Therefore, whatever was in that pouch must have been unique, far exceeding a dao lord weapon. It seemed that they truly coveted it.

“Who do you think Everlasting Monarch is? Would someone like him bring an average treasure to the reincarnation cycle?” An elder said softly.

Everlasting Monarch had dominated for so long, meaning that he had no lack of treasures. In the end, this pouch was the only thing he cared for enough to take to this bridge. He abandoned everything else, not the pouch.

All of these factors made the crowd uncontrollably curious about the content.
