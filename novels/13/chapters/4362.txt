Chapter 4363: Goldbird Monarch

There were four demon monarchs in Dragon, the most famous being Peacock Monarch. Some considered him the leader of the four. There was at least one monarch in each major branch with Dragon Platform having two.

Goldbird Monarch, the clan master of the Jian, was in control of Phoenix Ground.

Though he wasn’t as talented as the world-renowned Peacock Monarch, he was not one to be trifled with.

The serpent demon’s group became startled after seeing him. Though Peacock Monarch was in charge of Dragon currently, this didn’t mean that Dragon Platform had absolute authority in the sect.

The serpent demon was only a top demon from the platform while Goldbird was the lord. The latter’s status and influence were far superior.

In a sense, he was nothing more than an above-average disciple while standing before the monarch.

“Demon Monarch.” They cupped their fist after seeing him.

Hidden competitions and conflicts were inevitable among the three major branches. Nonetheless, they were from the same sect and there were rules. Thus, they didn’t dare to be disrespectful.

“Serpent King, why are you so enthusiastic with our clan’s guests?” Goldbird had a serious and dignified demeanor. His eyes shot out sharp rays and instill fear into the lesser demons.

The youths from Little Diamond shuddered as well. Though he harbored zero malice towards them, his gaze still deterred them from looking straight at him.

“There’s a misunderstanding, Demon Monarch.” The serpent demon cupped his fist and apologized: “I was only contributing to the sect by readying a reception early, I didn’t know that you would be here in person. Please forgive me.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Demons had a strong emphasis on bloodlines. Goldbird’s bloodline belonged to a divine creature. Of course, it was extremely thin by this point. Nonetheless, it was enough to make lesser demons feel an instinctive fear.

“Leave, I won’t argue with you.” Goldbird waved dismissively and uttered coldly: “The monarchs have their own plans, there will be punishments for those who act on their own accord.”

He made it clear that although there was a feud between Peacock Monarch and Li Qiye, this was their business. Any other disciple from Dragon interfering would face punishment.

“I understand, I understand.” The serpent was glad to get off so easily. He bowed and wiped off the sweat on his forehead before running. The other demons fled as well.

They were from Dragon Platform and believed that Li Qiye was the enemy. If they were to capture Li Qiye and hand him over Peacock Monarch first, it might be a notable contribution. Alas, they didn’t expect Goldbird Monarch to interfere.

Goldbird was a senior and although the serpent was unwilling to give up, he still didn’t dare to talk back.

After they were gone, Goldbird came over and bowed towards Li Qiye: “My name is Jian Mingyun. Please forgive me for my late reception, Young Noble.”

The young ones from Little Diamond hurriedly returned the gesture even though it wasn’t directed at them. After all, he was a behemoth in their eyes.

Even a regular cultivator in Dragon such as Deer King was a big shot to them, let alone Goldbird Monarch. Normally, they would never get the chance to meet this level of character. Moreover, they would need to be prostrating as well.

In this case, he was the first to show respect, hence the need to immediately bow back.

“It’s not a big deal, and you’ve just saved them all.” Li Qiye smiled.

The monarch’s heart skipped a beat as he carefully analyzed Li Qiye. Alas, the guy looked harmless.

This didn’t stop him from being careful. Though he was weaker than Peacock Monarch, he had ample knowledge and wisdom.

Unfortunately, this was not enough to see through Li Qiye. A while ago, his daughter sent him a letter before entering Dragon Citadel. She warned him that Li Qiye was unfathomable and he should exercise prudence.

As the saying goes - a father knows his daughter the best. He knew that her cultivation talents couldn’t compare to the top geniuses in Sky Border. However, her insight and wisdom were second to none. Thus, he took her words very seriously.

“My daughter has mentioned your arrival. I would like to invite you to our humble abode, would that be alright?” He bowed his head while cupping his fist.

A sect master from a small sect might be frightened and prostrate right away after seeing this. Li Qiye, on the other hand, nodded and said: “That’s fine, I do intend on visiting your three branches.”

The monarch had a bad feeling about this. What did he mean by “visiting”? It sounded rather provocative given the sensitive relationship between Li Qiye and their sect master.

The monarch wasn’t angry after hearing this. He just found Li Qiye’s casual and confident demeanor puzzling. The guy seemed to have no problem being in enemies’ territory, seemingly capable of taking down their great sect.

Elder Hu and the others were afraid. Their sect master spoke as if he wanted to cause trouble to the three branches. They were in the City of Demons. One wrong move might result in being surrounded by all three branches.

Fortunately, Goldbird Monarch and his men seemed friendly and didn’t express any dissatisfaction.

They led Li Qiye’s group into Phoenix Ground. The youths forgot about the perilous circumstances and became excited.

This was their first time visiting a great power, akin to country bumpkins visiting a major city.
