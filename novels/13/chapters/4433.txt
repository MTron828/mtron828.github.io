Chapter 4434: New Sect Master

The conclusion of the battle left many questions for the audience.

None sympathized with the ex-sect master due to his imperious and arrogant attitude, especially when he kept on bringing up his son. The big shots would snort at him if it wasn’t for Five-sun King.

After all, he wasn’t exceptional at all among his contemporaries. His great achievement was siring Five-sun King. This allowed him to walk proudly among the ancestors and rulers.

Due to the lack of respect, Featherhat Paragon and his peers didn’t want to risk trying to save him.

Furthermore, this battle also displayed Five-sun King’s power. Though he wasn’t here in person, that attack intimidated even high elders and ancestors. He showed that he was qualified to compete for the dao lord position.

Of course, the main topic was still how bizarre Li Qiye was.

Is he invincible? This thought briefly flashed in everyone’s mind but quickly dispersed.

His common appearance made it hard for people to consider him a true master and his ordinary slash confused them. In terms of aura and divinity, Five-sun King completely crushed Li Qiye. However, people would always remember Li Qiye’s triumph over the Bowl of the World.

“This ends here.” Nine-tailed God spoke and interrupted their rumination.

He stared at Featherhat Paragon and the others from the east and said: “Fellow Daoist from Eastern Desolace. We welcome your return on another day.”

This comment surprised all the eastern ancestors. This was the same as telling them to leave, no longer discussing the alliance and absolutely not the marriage alliance.

The group consisted of famous ancestors. Alas, there was a great gap between them and Nine-tailed God. After all, few in the world right now could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him.

“We shall obey.” Featherhat Paragon bowed and said: “Our Majesty also sincerely sends his regards.”

He hoped to give Nine-tailed God a good impression of Five-sun King. After all, no one would want an opponent like him in the future.

The other ancestors also bowed and said goodbye to the big shots of Dragon before leaving. They didn’t say anything to Li Qiye because escalation might end with their death.

“Let’s leave too.” The crowd members saw that it was over and also left.

Only the disciples of Dragon stood still respectfully, not daring to utter a single word. This was a glorious day for them since they got to see the elusive ancient demons and most importantly, Nine-tailed God.

The regular ancestors felt the same way - that they were extremely lucky to see their demon god.

The demon god’s eyes swept through the crowd. He then said with a dignified tone: “You all have let insignificant accomplishments go to your head, arrogant enough to compete with Lion’s Roar. Who gave you the confidence?”

The juniors trembled with fear after hearing his dissatisfied tone.

“Be smart demons, not idiots.” He added.

None dared to retort.

“From now on, the gates of Dragon shall be closed in order to cultivate the heart and nurture the character.” He went on.

This declaration was truly a big deal. Normally, sects wouldn’t close their gates unless there were massive issues, internally or otherwise.

Moreover, Dragon had great ambition as well. Such a sect wouldn’t close its gate. Now, his command made them feel as if someone had just poured cold water over them.

It meant that they would no longer compete with Lion’s Roar over the south’s dominion. They would just focus on self-improvement instead.

“Peacock has not fulfilled his obligation. Thus, the new sect master shall be Goldbird. Any objection?” His eyes narrowed as he spoke.

Many became emotional and exchanged glances. This position was usually decided by the ancestors. Nonetheless, Nine-tailed God could certainly change the direction of Dragon right away.

“We have no objection.” The three ancient demons spoke first.

“We have no objection.” The other ancestors followed suit.

In just a short time, Goldbird Monarch took over as the new sect master of Dragon. After all, no one would dare to oppose their strongest ancient ancestor. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Goldbird, you are the sect master starting today.” Nine-tailed God spoke.

“I…” Goldbird Monarch stood there in a daze.

“Do your best now, Goldbird.” Ancient Pheasant laughed and cheered him on.
