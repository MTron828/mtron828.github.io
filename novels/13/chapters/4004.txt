Chapter 4005: Celestial Grass Sword

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The tale told the story of this amazing cultivator. She was guided by a supreme existence during her youth - an immortal. He taught her the “Grass Sword Attacking Immortal Law.”

After finishing her dao, she stood at the apex with unfathomable cultivation.

Later on, she returned to her clan in the mortal world. She remembered their familial ties and decided to teach them how to cultivate.

She didn’t grant them the immortal law but instead, a derivative of it named Eight-strike Sword Law.

It was weaker than the original but could still dominate the cultivation world. With this, the Xu embarked on the path of cultivation. The sword technique also fortified their status in the region.

Later in the future, another top expert appeared in the clan. His title was Striker Heavenly Sovereign. He managed to reach the Immortal Sovereign realm on top of mastering the Eight-strike Sword Law, becoming infinitely close to the original version.

Remember, the realm of Immortal Sovereign was the highest of all sovereigns. They could take on dao lords without a problem.

This sovereign mastered the same sword dao as their matriarch. This was a shocking achievement.

During his era, the Xu could compete against any other sect in Sword Continent. Even Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel Citadel saw the clan in a new light.

This was their golden age - brimming with both power and resources.

Unfortunately, the descendants failed to maintain this and the clan gradually declined in the subsequent generations.

The Eight-strike Sword Law was still passed down. Alas, it was no longer on the same level as the sovereign’s version, let alone the original version of the matriarch.

The current law was excellent and usable. Alas, they couldn’t compare to the laws of the dao lords, let alone the nine heavenly sword dao.

As the most talented member of the Xu, Yiyun once had aspirations regarding revitalizing the clan. Unfortunately, her abilities couldn’t keep up with this ambition.

She spent a lot of time in Purification Street and knew the treasures in each shop. This was especially the case for Archaic Style. They had numerous branches all over Eight Desolaces.

The first time she came to this branch, she was instantly captivated by the grass sword. For some reason, she thought that it was connected to her and her clan.

Intuition told her that it might have something to do with their Eight-strike Sword Law. The problem here was its exorbitant price.

Chaos refined jades were the currency. In some places, they would take chaos stones but the refined version was one level higher.

Refining them required the same level of cultivation. Otherwise, the original stone would be damaged. Thus, the jades were more precious than the stones. For a large store like Archaic Style, they would only take jades.

It was actually Yiyun’s motivation for money. She wanted to make 210,000 Heavenly Sovereign Refined Jades in order to buy this sword. Thus, she was happy to see that no one had bought it yet.

Li Qiye could read her like a book. He smiled and said: “Let’s go take a look.”

She nodded and followed him inside.

The store didn’t have gaudy decorations nor a grand aura. It focused on maintaining an older architecture and style.

The area inside was unexpectedly large versus the entrance. It had an independent dimension with rolling hills and winding rivers. Some treasures floated in the air.

A long counter could be seen right away with an old shopkeeper hitting the abacus repeatedly.

A golden bell was tied to his belt. Whenever he moved, the bell would issue hushed ringings.

To the back was a shrine worshipping a golden bell covered in rust. Nonetheless, one wouldn’t need to push to realize how heavy it was. It gave off that impression at first glance.

Memories resurfaced in Li Qiye’s mind. When was the first time he saw this bell? How many ages ago was that? The bell was still here while everyone in that era was gone.

He sighed and continued onward to the center of the store.

Those who have visited the other branches of Archaic Style would find this one unique. The others were far inferior in comparison.

They saw a flood dragon splashing the water in the river. This mythical beast darted in and out of the water and occasionally turned into a draconic sword. Dragon roars could be heard coming from this expensive weapon.

On top of a mountain was a phoenix roost. “Poof!” Fire suddenly manifested and the phoenix turned into a blazing cauldron. This looked like an erupting volcano capable of incinerating the sky… Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Numerous magnificent scenes could be seen. They originated from the various treasures belonging to the store.

Of course, some were stored in a normal manner - on the shelves and display windows. The special ones had their own corner in order to show their true worth.

These ones were exorbitantly expensive. Even the ancestors couldn’t afford them.

One could find anything here in Archaic Style. If they couldn’t, they would just need to ask and the store would locate the treasure later on.

Thus, the problem became not having enough money. As long as one had enough, they could have whatever they wanted.

All in all, taking a look at this store would broaden one’s horizon.

A worker came over to greet Li Qiye’s group right away. Li Qiye led him to the window containing the grass sword.

“Sir, do you want this sword?” The worker quickly took it down for Li Qiye to take a closer look: “This is from an ancient sect. Rumor has it that the sky was torn asunder that day. Numerous visual phenomena appeared along with an immortal city. This sword fell down and an ancestor of the sect obtained it. He became invincible afterward. Later on, the clan declined and our branch in Sky Border bought it before shipping it to our branch. I’m sure it’s no coincidence that you’re interested in it right now. It has to be fate.”

“It fell from an immortal city?” Yiyun was surprised.

“Maybe, it’s just a rumor, I can’t guarantee anything.” The worker smiled.
