Chapter 5241: An Art

“I will definitely go back.” Li Qiye stared at him and said with a smirk.

“Big Brother, don’t give me that look, I’m scared.” Boss Tang got chills and said: “If you want anything, just say the word. What’s mine is yours.”

“I know, I’ll grab anything I want either way.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“True. I’m overthinking it then.” He let out an awkward smile.

“Have you thought about going back?” Li Qiye suddenly asked, stunning Boss Tang in the process.

Li Qiye saw his expression and nodded: “That’s a yes.”

“Right, but I won’t be returning. This world is great and I’m just like my old man, he’s running away and I am the same. Plus, even if I return, I won’t recognize anything while still being haunted by the past.” He sighed and said seriously: “I’m very content with my life experiences thus far. I have numerous descendants and am rather famous now.”

“I see.” Li Qiye patted his shoulder and said: “To each his own. It’s perfectly fine to pick a different path.”

“I do feel bad about not returning with you, Big Brother, I don’t have the courage to do so.” He said with a smile.

“Returning home is unnecessary for world travelers. Plus, there’s nothing there holding you back.” Li Qiye said.

“I hope everything will go well with your trip, Big Brother. I’m counting on you.” He said while performing a full kowtow.

Li Qiye accepted the gesture and let out a sigh while looking at the incomplete tree.

He returned to the courtyard. The old man who was sunbathing sniffed the air and said: “Looks like you got it.”

Li Qiye sat down and nodded.

“Interesting.” The old man smiled and said: “We tried so many times to break it down in order to devour them, but they persevered each time. Now, a junior managed to take them down instead of us.”

“Not necessarily.” Li Qiye closed his eyes and relaxed.

“Perhaps not, but it is still a testament to this junior’s frightening ability.” The old man said.

“What would you have done?” Li Qiye glanced at him.

“Keke, dealing with just one junior?” The old man mused: “Let me think, I would probably have been preoccupied with the best method to devour him the best. After all, consumption is an art.”

“What if this is not the case?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hmm, then I would need to control my greed or I’ll be the one eaten.” The old man said.

“It’s just that this doesn’t make sense.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The old man opened his eyes just a tiny bit to peer deep into space. He said: “Yes, I think only he can accomplish this. Do you remember that stone I told you about?”

“Looks like he found it.” Li Qiye nodded.

“In my opinion, there’s a high chance that he found all three. Now that’s interesting.” The old man said.

“All three.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

The old man pondered for a bit before asking: “If I had the determination to find all three, hehe, who do you think I would have raised my blade against first?”

“Not the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye smiled.

“True, still can’t find him with three stones. I have two options, using them as stepping stones or…” He paused and opened his eyes a bit wide to stare at Li Qiye: “... to actually use them.”

“That wouldn’t have ended well for you.” Li Qiye smirked.

“I didn’t mean aiming them against you alone, perhaps they would be better served as sharpening stones, the perfect setup.” The old man said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“It’s rather reckless, who knows who will be the sharpening stone in that scenario after one mistake?” Li Qiye said.

“See, if I were the villainous heaven, I would be delighted to see such a situation. A little patience before seizing the right moment for a decisive blow, resolving all loose ends in one go. Pests and shadows, gone once and for all.” The old man said.

“Depending on the alliances, the one with the upper hand in this scenario remains unknown.” Li Qiye said.

“I would have gambled it all.” The old man said.

“That’s why you’re not the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Yes, my biggest flaw is my insatiable appetite. If I could have controlled it, hehe, I would have been able to test my strength.”

“The chance is gone now.” Li Qiye said.

“Sigh, so harsh. Why can’t you let a dead man amuse himself for a few seconds?” The old man complained.

“It’s just not a realistic scenario for you. If you could have changed your way, then I might be the one laying here as a corpse right now.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Heh, hard to say, could be him too.” The old man said.

Li Qiye chuckled in response, not denying this possibility.

“If you want to find him, now might be the best chance. A clear path is laid out before you.” The old man said.

“That’s just as he wishes.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Of course, you can take a different path and catch him off guard. In fact, this might make it possible to catch the villainous heaven off guard too.” The old man said.

“Really now?” Li Qiye asked with a faint smile.

“I am sincerely discussing this matter with you.” The old man felt a bit uneasy.

“It feels like you’re trying to lead me astray.” Li Qiye said.

“Oh? Not confident in your dao heart this time? Afraid of succumbing to temptation? You know, that is not a sin. Falling into the darkness is wonderful, you can freely indulge in your desires and experience incredible pleasure. When I feasted back in the day, the joy…” He licked his lips and his eyes lit up brightly.

“No need to fantasize, you’re already dead.” Li Qiye interrupted.

“Damn it.” Being dragged out of his fantasy left him sad. He then said: “What’s the point of your approach, acting like an ascetic monk? On the surface, it seems like you are in control of everything but in reality, you’re shackling yourself and restraining your potential. You are your own slave.”

“My dao heart has no bounds and my freedom is limitless.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What have you gained with all of these restrictions? Nothing. At least the villainous heaven above is actually in charge. Even when you defeat him, there is nothing for you.” The old man remarked.

“Our difference is why I’m alive and you’re not.” Li Qiye said.

“Hahaha, say whatever you want.” The old man laughed: “I’m sure you will reconsider in the future. Remember my words then, the sweet temptation is irresistible.”

“It is useless trying to persuade me. I don’t need that type of joy to validate my existence.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“How would you know without having tried it?” The old man said.
