Moreover, the entire world was aware of this marriage. At that point, she has become the new king’s woman for that is her fate. She knew that she would have to marry him and didn’t think about changing it, preferring to accept it and adapt.

“And you?” He chuckled in response.

She has been maintaining her determined glare: “People must keep their promise. Since the marriage agreement exists, I, I shall fulfill my obligation.”

“Remember, you’re not the one who decided it.” Li Qiye rubbed his chin.

She gently nodded: “I’m aware, but the pavilion took care of me and the ancestors have spent great effort as well. I should be contributing whatever I can. If the great ancestor had agreed to it, I shall not make a deceiver out of him.”

“Good, not many people keep their words nowadays, especially towards someone they deem below them.” Li Qiye clapped and praised.

She loosened up and stopped speaking after getting her message across. The truth was that few members of Waterfront supported her since it was not a good match. Their sect’s talent would be wasted on this pile of manure.

Unfortunately, Chuqing still snuck out after making up her mind, not wanting the sect to stop her.

“What will you do now?” Li Qiye asked.

She gave him one quick glance before being embarrassed by her own response: “If you marry a chicken, follow the chicken; if you marry a dog, follow the dog.”

The common adage could barely be heard towards the end. She felt her entire face becoming hot.

“Well said, I like a good girl like you. Come on in.” He nodded approvingly.

The girl’s heart skipped a beat from being nervous. Nevertheless, she thought that this was only the beginning and cheered herself up.

Li Qiye had already entered. She hesitated for a moment before following him into the stone hall. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She suddenly realized something afterward. This mountain and stone hall were large, but there were only the two of them around.

She had heard of his infamous debauchery as well, like everyone else in the world. What was she going to do if he wanted to ... do something ungentlemanly in this abandoned place?

She had thoughts of retreating. An innocent girl of her has yet to experience certain things, and this frightened her. However, the two of them had a marriage agreement, so their status as husband and wife have been determined. Even if he were to do a certain something to her... at the very least, it’s natural and should happen anyway.

While feeling uneasy with fear, she still didn’t want to give up. She eventually took a deep breath and followed right behind him, wanting to get used to this on top of changing his nature.

Li Qiye sat down on the main chair and smiled: “If you wish to be my wife, you must learn how to serve me. I will give you an opportunity right now, wash my face.”

The girl was jolted for a moment before softly speaking: “I, I got it.”

With that, she busily prepared items to wash his face.

As the princess of Waterfront Pavilion, perhaps she wasn’t that pampered compared to other golden daughters, but she never had to do anything dirty or serve someone else before.

It was already amazing that she didn’t have servants despite her prestigious status, let alone serving someone else. Nevertheless, she willingly started today like an obedient wife.

Li Qiye sat there and watched her rush around like a spinning top, seemingly enjoying this rare, beautiful scene.

After a long time, she finally got all the items ready and brought a basin of warm water before him.

“Go ahead.” Li Qiye sat still and nonchalantly said.

She was surprised again, thinking that he would wash his own face after having the necessary items. Who would have thought that he wanted her to do it for him?

She took another breath to relax - this was her husband anyway, she’ll be following him for the rest of her life. Clumsiness was inevitable since it was her first time washing someone else’s face, but she was meticulous and careful.

After she finished, Li Qiye smiled and gently touched her exquisite chin.

“What, what do you want?” She jumped like a frightened deer, thinking about his perverted nature.

“A man and a woman all alone, what can we do, I wonder?” He blinked one eye and said.

This was the expression of a pervert, as wretched as can be.

She took one step back with a changed expression: “We, we shouldn’t do that.”

Being so nervous made her forget that she was a top prodigy of Waterfront while he was a weakling.

“What should we do then?” He smiled.

“I...” She had no response despite opening her mouth for half a day.

He leisurely continued: “You’re already my woman, so don’t you think we should do something romantic? It’s perfectly justified.”

She lowered her head, agreeing this with logic. It was only a matter of time for certain things to happen between a husband and wife.

After a brief lull, she eventually asked: “Can, can you not be like this?”

“Like what? Our matter right now or something else?” He smiled.

The girl hesitated for a moment before courageously stated her thoughts: “Just, those ridiculous and unreasonable things I’ve heard about. Can you change a little?”

“You wish to change me?” He grinned, amused.

The girl looked straight at his eyes and said: “I don’t want you to be someone like that. After all, we’re married now and there is a long future ahead for us. It, it’s fine that you’re weak, it doesn’t matter, not just anyone can become an expert... but I hope that others won’t mock my husband for being so ridiculous. I sincerely want you to become a good person instead of being an absurd king like in the past.”

It wasn’t easy for her to say this but they came from the heart - her most sincere and honest words. She didn’t mind that he was incapable and weak, only for him to stop being a perverted and irrational man.

There was no changing this marriage, so she wanted to change Li Qiye instead. She was an earnest person so she couldn’t help revealing everything to her husband. Her goal in coming here wasn’t only for the marriage but also to change him.

“Hmm, makes sense.” Li Qiye nodded.
