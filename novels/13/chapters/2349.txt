The star of the show didn’t know about the gathering of his enemies as he infiltrated the depth of the mountain range.

It seemed endless but he persevered long enough to reach his destination.

“Rumble!” Explosions made the area quake with cracks everywhere.

“Boom!” Thunderclaps could be heard. Ahead was a bright expanse with lightning bolts dancing like serpents, completely overwhelming in number.

At the same time, a tsunami rose to the sky, seemingly wanting to topple the stars.

An incredible battle was obviously going on. As Li Qiye drew closer, he saw three powerful coin beasts fighting till the death.

To be exact, it was one living beast versus two skeletons. The former was no stranger to Li Qiye - it was the Kui that took him here. The poor beast was covered in wounds and blood.

As for the other two, one was a gigantic scorpion with bones large enough to support the nearby peaks. Despite its decayed state, its stinger was well-preserved, still having a luster at the venomous tip.

The stinger pierced through a mountain with lightning speed. It seemed to be piercing through papers. After the penetration, white smoke billowed from the area. It didn’t take long before the rocky material turned into liquid.

The other skeleton resembled a turtle with a shell large enough to overshadow the mountains. It was relatively slow, but its teeth were sharp. Each bite punished the nearby terrains. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This was a fight to the death, and the Kui was at a disadvantage going one versus two.

It continued to summon lightning bolts from the sky as its main offensive move.

The turtle roared and raised its shell like a shield to stop the bolts. “Boom!” The bolts struck the shell, resulting in an eruption of sparks.

Meanwhile, the scorpion darted to the back of the Kui and used its stinger again.

The Kui summoned an earthen wall, but the stinger still managed to pierce through it and made contact with the Kui’s shoulder. Though the Kui could handle the venom, its blood still turned black.

It became furious and entered a berserk state. Thicker lightning bolts gathered in front of it and turned into a heavenly sword with a dazzling glow. The scariest part was the dao rune inside this sword. It contained both the power of lightning and the primordial dao.

This beast was actually so intelligent, capable of controlling the power of the dao just like a cultivator. This was learned, not an innate gift. Becoming a divine beast was inevitable in the future.

“Boom!” The sword split the sky vault open, managing to leave a deep cut on the turtle’s shell.

However, the scorpion assisted by aiming for the Kui’s throat. The Kui had no choice but to give up on attacking the turtle, turning around instead to slash at the scorpion.

Not far from this battle was a dark cave, akin to the jaw of an ancient beast.

Though the mountains nearby collapsed from the shockwaves, even the stars became victims, but strangely enough, this dark cave was perfectly untouched.

Li Qiye took a good look at the situation. The beasts noticed him too but they continued their heated battle. He only smiled and focused on the dark cave instead. This was his destination, so he started walking towards it.

“Ra!” The scorpion and turtle suddenly ignored the Kui and rushed towards him.

“Pluff!” The scorpion possessed the greatest speed with its stinger, also aiming for his throat.

His eyes became serious. At this instance, a very faint noise could be heard, almost like the blooming of a flower.

He was holding a sword now, nearly invisible since it was transparent. The actual blade seemed thinner than a piece of paper. He performed a cut flawlessly like an expert cook preparing meat.

Another faint noise occurred, ending with him still standing there in a neutral pose.

“Boom!” The turtle was here now, stomping down on him with its gigantic foot.

He didn’t bat an eye and used his sword again with a perfect motion. The air seemed to be frozen; both of the beasts stopped moving.

After a long time, their frame suddenly became separated into even pieces, almost like a display of art.

Their bones scattered on the ground and stopped moving. Li Qiye chuckled after seeing this and put away his sword.

Its name was Crystal, not quite a physical sword but a dao condensed into this form so that he could grasp it.
