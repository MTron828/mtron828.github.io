Chapter 4310: Ancestral Divine Temple

The title of this temple scared the hell out of Elder Hu. All of Eight Desolaces have heard of it before. A weak cultivator such as Elder Hu took it even harder.

The temple was normally not the subject of casual conversations. Cultivators usually only addressed it as the “divine temple”, not its actual name.

Thus, Elder Hu thought about it right away after listening to the aunt. He calmed down and repeatedly shushed her, not wanting to dwell on this topic.

“Why are you shushing me? It’s just a temple, the girl herself said that it wasn’t a big deal.” The aunt wasn’t happy.

“Please stop, you’re scaring all of us.” Elder Hu turned pale and kept on looking outside. Fortunately, no one paid attention to their conversation.

Anything pertaining to the temple must be uttered with respect. This aunt, on the other hand, spoke so casually.

In his opinion, she could speak this way because she was a mortal. Alas, cultivators couldn’t do so. This was especially true in Southern Desolace, the land of Lion’s Roar.

The temple wasn’t a sect or a temple, strictly speaking. It was rather mysterious and special.

Lion’s Roar had numerous kingdoms under its jurisdiction and thousands of sects. It didn’t participate in ruling them but they were still considered vassal states.

This was the case for Little Diamond as well. Lion’s Roar probably had never heard of such a sect before. Nonetheless, Little Diamond still needed to obey an official decree.

The ones with the most authority were none other than its royal clan - the Chi. The clan was also known as the Golden Lions because of their official emblem.

On a surface level, many would consider the Chi to be the highest authority of the land. However, those with more knowledge would disagree.

Their answer would be the temple due to its ultimate existence - the Supreme Monarch. According to the legends, the temple was her residence.

However, subsequent generations haven’t seen her in there, not even members of the temple. Nonetheless, her legacy was passed down through the temple. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The temple had an intimate relationship with Lion’s Roar. In a sense, it could actually decide the future direction of the kingdom. Even the members of the royal clan believed that the temple was their national spiritual totem.

The reason was simple - the Supreme Monarch came from the royal clan. Many historical accounts believed that the monarch had a blood relationship with Lion’s Roar’s best ruler - Golden Lion Emperor.

For eras now, the royal clan worshipped and asked for advice regarding important matters. This included the succession process.

This ultimate status was the reason why Elder Hu became so scared. However, the aunt ignored him and smiled at Li Qiye: “This girl is quite pretty and nice, I watched her grow up myself.”

“Aunt, please spare us.” Elder Hu started beginning.

Sure, this girl might have been her neighbor in the past but now, she had joined the temple. Her status has been elevated.

The mortal has turned into a disciple of the temple, meaning that she was part of the cultivation world. Mortal relationships no longer mattered.

Thus, the aunt was being suicidal for trying to be a matchmaker. The worst-case scenario might be death.

The temple was at the top of the cultivation world. Even a regular disciple there was a prestigious character in the grand scheme of things.

Little Diamond was only a speck of dust in comparison. Its members weren’t qualified to meet anyone from the temple, not even the sect master - let alone marriage.

Nonetheless, the elder fantasized for a split second. If the sect master could actually marry someone from there, Little Diamond’s status would soar overnight. Eight Demons and Deer King would be nothing compared to them then.

Alas, he knew that it was impossible. The thing worrying him was that the aunt’s careless comment could reach the ears of the girl. This would result in a total disaster.

“You're quite ambitious.” Li Qiye smiled and said, not paying attention to the sweating elder either.

“I’m only thinking about what’s best for you, Young Noble. I know you’re popular and other girls are always staring. I just think my girl is a great candidate.” The aunt’s cheeks were bouncing as she smiled.

“Your vision is commendable.” Li Qiye smiled: “Aren’t you a good candidate too?”

Elder Hu and Wang Weiqiao nearly spat out their tea after hearing this.

“Sect Master…” Elder Hu interjected right away.

Mingling with a disciple from the temple was dangerous. However, mingling with this old lady was potentially worse.

Flirting with a pretty girl meant that he was healthy, something rather normal. Alas, he wanted to flirt with the boss too?

“You’re funny, Young Noble. Look at me, no one wants me so that’s why I’m old and single.”

“I want you.” Li Qiye said.

“Puh!” The listeners spat out their tea.
