Chapter 5294: Moon Embrace

Immortal Emperor Guan Feng, the third emperor of Eternal River School, gained his title because of his love for phoenixes and anything related to the mythical beasts. [1]

The dao of the world changed entirely after the calamity. Thus, some ancient beings including the emperor rarely showed up again.

“Boom!” The power within Lesser Firmament continued to ravage the barrier, seemingly wanting to crush the entire region.

This sent the majestic figures flying. However, they stabilized and activated their suppressive power. This actually affected the rest of the upper continents, freezing everyone else while causing the world to quake violently.

“This is not good.” The strongest members of the upper continents all activated their heavenly gaze.

The eruption of power was frightening; everyone else wondered if these emperors and monarchs from Lesser Firmament would be able to stop it.

“I humbly offer my assistance, however weak I may be.” Xiao Qingtian bowed, still wanting to enter.

Alas, the portal remained closed.

“Boom!” A heavenly hammer descended and caused cracks in space. The fabrics of reality couldn’t withstand its weight.

It exuded laws from conquerors, pulsing with a suction force capable of pulling everyone in.

Next came numerous high-level conquerors, looking like gods. The leader was a conqueror adorned in silver armor with coursing lightning currents.

“Heaven-hammer Conqueror, and is that the famed group of dragon lords?” A big shot took a deep breath after seeing this group.

“One of the seven conquerors. They stopped appearing after Illumination Conqueror’s abdication.” A dragon lord murmured.

Heaven-hammer Conqueror was the oldest disciple of Illumination Conqueror, possessing eight dao fruits. He contributed meritoriously during the wars against The Race. Under him were capable dragon lords who had survived countless battles.

Despite abdicating and leaving the reins to Dao Alliance, Illumination Conqueror remained influential.

There were seven conquerors with absolute loyalty to him, Heaven-hammer was one of them. They all joined Azure School afterward, hence its current prestige.

“We stand together! Lesser Firmament, just say the words and we shall subdue the evil together!” Heaven-hammer and his follower stood before the portal.

Their appearance made everyone else think about the gravity of the situation.

“We are grateful for your support, Azure School, but there is no evil inside Lesser Firmament. Please return.” Immortal Emperor Guan Feng answered.

“Rumble!” A meteor from the horizon interrupted the conversation by smashing into the barrier.

Surprisingly enough, instead of breaking the crystal walls, it started fusing into them. Perhaps this was one way to enter Lesser Firmament without needing to break the unbreakable wall.

Since it paused for a moment, everyone finally got a good look at the meteor. It turned out to be a full set of armor not worn by anyone. Within the armor seemed to be an ocean large enough to accommodate the upper continents. A bright moon also played within the ocean, seemingly embraced by it.

Li Qiye had seen it back in Imperial Attendant City while chatting with the old man in the courtyard.

It was crossing through unknown dimensions during its travel and finally arrived at Lesser Firmament.

“What is this?” Everyone stared intensely at the armor set.

“Moon Embrace!” An ancient Grand Emperor hidden deep in space became emotional. [2]

“It’s Moon Embrace!” A knowledgeable dragon lord blurted in astonishment.

“What is that?” Younger cultivators have never heard this title before.

“One of the five legendary immortal armaments.” The dragon lord said.

Those who were still alive from that era couldn’t believe their own eyes. This title still held as much weight now as it did then.

Moon Embrace, in and of itself, was already incredible. However, it also represented an all-supreme emperor who ruled the world once.

During his reign, he was feared and revered by the upper echelons of both The Race and The People.
