Chapter 4160: An Old Friend

The gentle breezes seemed to be the only natural order at work in this dimension.

“You’re here.” A feeble voice greeted Li Qiye. The speaker must have one foot in the grave.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye continued to relax in his chair.

A decrepit old man rested on the other chair. One could mistake him for a corpse if he didn’t speak earlier. He didn’t open his mouth; the words seemed to be traveling with the winds like the whispers of a spirit.

“Death draws near for me.” His voice didn’t only permeate the ears but also the very soul of listeners.

“You’ll live for three to five more epochs.” Li Qiye replied softly. Nonetheless, he seemed to have made a decision for this old man.

“My strength is sapped, there is no difference between life and death now.” The old man smiled wryly.

“People say that living a borrowed life is still better than a good death.” Li Qiye responded.

“I’m not one of them, living a borrowed life is meaningless.” To which the old man responded.

“I can’t argue with that.” Li Qiye said: “A true dragon will have the pride of a true dragon, not sharing the weak characteristics of insects. However, a shallow pond cannot hold a true dragon nor is it the right place to rest.”

“Don’t be so sentimental now, it’s just death, and not my first time either.” The old man laughed heartily. His laughter was as bright and warm as the sunlight, completely untethered and all-reaching.

“You’re more open-minded than me in this regard.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s about time for me after the myriad ages.” He smiled:” I don’t need descendants to come see my old bones or remember me.”

“They have their own path.” Li Qiye smiled: “If they’re capable, they’ll prosper. If they’re worthless, then no need to worry about them.”

“I don’t worry because of that one place of yours. I already told them to leave. As for me, I don’t mind this broken place.” He said.

“That’s fine. Leave the long journey to me then, it’s still the same as before, only a different person is doing the walking.” Li Qiye said.

“It is time for you to embark.” The old man said.

Li Qiye didn’t answer and turned his sight towards the sky vault. There seemed to be a path leading deeper up above with no end in sight, not even after a journey lasting a billion years.

“Feeling old?” The old man smiled.

“So many geezers are still alive, it’s too early to call me old. I’m only eighteen compared to them.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Maybe I should die earlier then so you can stop refusing to recognize your age.” The old man didn’t seem to think much of death.

“It’s hard to say, maybe after enough years, geezers like you might regain your passion.” Li Qiye said.

“Hmm…” The old man became sentimental and recalled his past. It started with learning martial arts and repeating strikes, then came performing heroic deeds…

“It’s nice to be alive.” He added: “But death isn’t that bad either. My bones might be worth a few coins, just enough to nourish this land.”

“True. When I die, my corpse will probably poison everything instead.” Li Qiye added.

“That’s possible.” The old man laughed: “I’m sure you will go down in infamy. The death gods will stomp your face upon meeting you since you are the butcher, the crow that brings nothing but disasters.”

“That’s okay, the world can think as they please.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Don’t worry, it doesn’t matter how hated you are, you’ll stay alive, Dark Crow.” The old man said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Li Qiye paused for a bit before speaking hushedly: “Maybe you’re right, death is better than living sometimes.”

“That’s for others to say, not you. You cannot die since you’ll need to cause trouble for ages to come.” The old man said seriously.

“Yes, the world needs a scourge like me or it’ll be too boring and peaceful. Peace brings prosperity and fat sheep, some will salivate then.”

“They’ll reveal their fangs in due time.” The old man said.

“I’ve been waiting for a very long time now. It’s quite problematic that they’re so patient.” Li Qiye said.

“There might be someone else just like you, waiting for that exact moment.” The old man said.

The breeze suddenly stopped and the atmosphere became serious.

“Yes, beasts like to eat sheep but there are monsters that feast on beasts.” Li Qiye nodded.

“The monsters might not always be so lucky either.” The old man added.

Li Qiye rubbed his cheek and said: “Sounds like you’re jinxing me and carving the word “monster” on my face. I need to take a look in the mirror first.”

“Well, maybe you’ll be the lucky one.” The old man smiled.

“Hard to say, only the ultimate winner can smile in the end.” Li Qiye said.

“The villainous heaven.” The old man suddenly opened his eyes wide, becoming emotional. They were empty yet still contained a boundless universe. There was a barely discernible spark there that could illuminate the cosmos and give birth to countless lives.

“If that day ever comes, I suppose dying to the villainous heaven isn’t too bad. It’s a wish-comes-true for many, just making it that far.” Li Qiye reflected.

“Once again, you will have to be the exception.” The old man reminded.

“Yes, others can, not I… not I.” Li Qiye sighed and agreed: “It’s not easy to die nowadays, or at least a death that is a little acceptable. No one has it as rough as me.”

“You picked your path, now you have to walk or crawl until you reach the end.” The old man said.

“I’m visiting to get useful stuff, not for you to verbally stab me.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“It’s fine, I can’t stab for too long since I’m about to die soon.” The old man

“I still think it’s too early to say that. A turtle can live for a long time and your lifespan is even better than a turtle’s.” Li Qiye joked.

The old man chuckled before putting on a somber expression: “I lost.”

These two simple words weighed heavily like countless mountains.

“Not surprising, you’re old and not as strong as before.” Li Qiye responded.

“No, I have no excuse, it’s a loss. I probably would have lost during my prime too. He is strong, really strong.” The old man sighed.

“I know, the strongest.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I’m afraid you’ll have to fight him first before getting to the villainous heaven. How is your preparation?” The old man asked.

“Perhaps the villainous heaven won’t give us the chance.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s more likely that he won’t give you the chance. I still think it’s best for you to fight him or the consequences will be grave.” The old man suggested.

“What is your opinion on him?” Li Qiye asked.

The old man thought about it carefully before replying: “I don’t trust him.”
