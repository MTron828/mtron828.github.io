Chapter 4188: Second Grave

The water drowned the entire zone yet cultivators were completely unaffected. The entire phase felt like an illusion.

The aquatic creatures consisted of gigantic swordfish, ferocious flood dragons, and many others… Spectators were captivated by this magical scene.

“Look, it’s a divine sword!” Someone noticed a fish clenching a divine sword between its jaws. This had an auspicious affinity with pulsing rays. Other deepsea creatures gave way after seeing it.

Incredible phenomena occurred everywhere. Another saw a sword ray darting through with lightning speed. A different area had a school of thunderfish following a divine sword.

“Boom!” In a marine trench was an explosive radiance. The rays spread out like a fan opening, completely stopping any creature from getting close. Being struck by them meant certain death.

Above the surface, deafening blasts created tidal waves. Numerous suns could be seen rising above. Each gestated a solar sword. Having all nine meant possessing incredible power.

In short, spectators saw wondrous things everywhere in the ocean and started fantasizing about the possibilities.

Some reached out for the divine swords but failed to grab anything. Suddenly, the water receded just as fast as it came. The zone became dry and normal just like before.

“What the heck, it’s all gone.” People looked around and saw no signs of the water. It was as if nothing had happened.

“Can someone tell me what is going on?” One youth looked around in confusion.

“That was the second grave, Sword Ocean.” An expert explained.

“The mysterious second grave appeared this time, unlike the previous occurrences. How strange.” An ancestor responded.

“Is this a sign for something?” Another murmured.

“Boom!” Another phenomenon occurred right away. The sky started shaking as another ray tore apart the spatial fabrics and left behind an indelible scar.

Its speed was monstrous and its devastation made it look like there was a monster crossing through.

“A peerless divine sword?” A big shot noticed that it was heading for the deepest region.

The long scar resembled a river of time. However, its flow was a million times faster than the actual temporal flow. This was a truly magnificent spectacle.

“Do you know what it is?” A cultivator asked the group.

“Not quite sure, it should be a divine sword.” The ancestor among them couldn’t see clearly.

“Yes, it was a sword but it didn’t look like something from the cemetery. Where did it come from?” A mighty ancestor from an ancient dynasty had a solemn expression.

“Sword Burial Zone is the domain of swords yet one dares to be so haughty here? It must be terrifyingly strong.” The third ancestor added.

It didn’t take long before everyone talked about this issue.

“Got a fun show.” Li Qiye glanced at it and smiled.

“Boom!” A force suddenly swept through the area and suppressed all existence.

The weaker cultivators got down on their knees, unable to get up. It felt as if mountains were pushing down on their shoulders and breaking their spine.

“So strong!” Many were in awe and became frozen.

They saw a figure crossing through the region and making it to the depths of the zone right away.

“Who is it?!” Everything happened too quickly. The figure made it through the river and entered the cauldron in the blink of an eye. Others felt insignificant like insects before this incredible being.

“It has to be one of the Five Overlords.” An ancestor took a deep breath.

“Are you sure?!” Those nearby were astounded.

“Who is it?” This became the next question since no one got a good look at the new cultivator.

“Just what is going on this time? Why are they here too?” An ancient king wondered.

The five overlords rarely appeared in Sword Continent. The appearance of the Sword Burial Zone wasn’t necessarily enough to force them to come out.

After all, dao lord-level weapons couldn’t tempt them since their sect had several. They wouldn’t waste their lifespan for this goal.

Thus, this meant that something above this grade was happening here at the burial zone.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

News finally came and answered their question.

“The second grave made it to Sword Cauldron!” Everyone heard about this right away.

“The ocean? I thought it was limited to the outer regions.” A youth became puzzled.

“The second grave is the most mysterious and elusive of them all. Though it has a high chance of being in the cemetery, it can emerge deeper inside too.”

“At least it is only at the cauldron. We have a better chance of making it inside now. If it shows up in Sword World instead, then there’s no chance regardless of the water making it easier or not.” A big shot became happy.

“Indeed, this is a good thing. Sword World is just too prohibitive for anyone outside of dao lords or characters like the Five Overlords.” An ancient ancestor said.
