Facing the rest of the world was a serious matter even for the strongest ancestors. However, a junior like Shi Qingjian still made this decision in a domineering and fearless manner.

“Then wait for the destruction of your sect. The myriad heroes of the world will come and siege Ancestral City. Nothing will be left here but ashes...” One crowd member bellowed.

However, he couldn’t finish due to a massive detonation. The ground trembled violently in the north.

A majestic power rushed up from underground with a boundless life force towards all eight directions. Everyone could sense a colossal being awakening. The turning of this lord’s body could crush the realms.

A mountain not far from the city suddenly shifted. The trees and terrains nearby were destroyed in the process. Debris and dust covered the sky while boulders rolled chaotically.

After everything settled, they saw a golem with half of his body still buried underground.

“Rumble!” More earthquakes happened as he slowly climbed up. Once he got on his feet, he stood among the clouds.

“Boom!” His terrible power shocked the firmaments and the cosmo before smashing back down onto the north. All the clouds in the region were swept away.

Other slumbering existences woke up as a result - in the depths of Yin Yang Gate, in the ancestral hall of Skylight, and the mountain of Firmaments...

These big shots in the north had a serious expression, even the invincible Heavenly Sovereigns. Those actually aware of his identity exercised extreme prudence.

Back in Ancestral City in an old restaurant, an old man sitting by the counter also opened his eyes once before dozing off again.

“Hmph.” The golem’s scowl sent the world into a state of chaos. He opened his eyes and gazed at the crowd outside of the stone forest. They looked like two blinding suns sending rays down on the mass.

The majority couldn’t withstand the pressure from the great being. The weaker cultivators dropped to their knees or butt since they were scared out of their minds. The gaze, in particular, affected even the toughest ones.

“I’ve, I’ve never said anything about destroying Ancestral!” A few lost their courage and expressed their innocence.

Their fear was warranted since they felt like ants before this gigantic golem. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“A pseudo-atavistic forefather...” An ancestor murmured in fear. The ones near him became shaken after hearing this.

These forefathers were immensely mighty. The realm of Heavenly Sovereign was only the starting point for them.

Even a fool could tell how powerful he was judging by his aura and divinity.

The reason for his awakening was obvious - people were threatening Ancestral City.

“The Su Clan has no intention of disrespecting Ancestral City!” Very few people could stand straight right now, let alone looking straight at the forefather.

“Myriad Mountain Sect will leave right now.” Other sects started changing their stance.

“We’ll leave right now.”

“Us too...”

Just this forefather alone could annihilate the coalition army, no need for Ancestral City to actually do anything. Number no longer mattered here.

Sects started retreating without uttering any more nonsense. They fled and disappeared into the horizon.

The forefather only glared at them for a bit before closing his eyes, returning into hibernation.

The top-ranking members of Skylight, Firmaments, and Yin Yang weren’t fully intimidated. They only had a pale expression and relative dread.

They knew that the coalition army was only a useless mob against a golem forefather. It was impossible for them to take Li Qiye away now.

Just one palm strike from him could flatten their side. If they wanted to fight Ancestral, they needed their ancient ancestors to come as well. Any less would be suicidal.

Some of them thought about the takeover from Pearlstone Saintess. Perhaps she had garnered the support of a forefather. That’s the only possibility.

“Do we need a send-off party?” Shi Qingjian glared at the ancestor from Yin Yang Gate.

The coalition had no choice because they weren’t qualified to handle the situation any longer. Reinforcement was necessary, especially their ancient ancestors.

“Let’s go.” They left the city limits in dejection, no longer possessing the same morale as before.

The ones who shouted the loudest earlier about capturing Li Qiye for the sake of justice were the first to flee. The great coalition army scattered like birds and beasts in the blink of an eye.

This was a wake-up call to the city’s true power.

Some neutral spectators looked up at the forefather. He no longer had the same oppressive aura during his slumber state. However, they still felt a great sense of reverence, especially the golems.

The latter had an innate respect for these great beings. Thus, they started bowing and worshipping the forefather.

On the other hand, Li Qiye only gave him a glance.

“Young Master, I thought you were dead for sure, it’s good that the saintess brought reinforcement.” Shi Wawa ran over and excitedly told him.

Shi Qingjian jumped down from her war-horse and walked to Li Qiye’s front. She bowed her head and said: “Welcome back to the city, Young Master. We are ready for your orders.”
