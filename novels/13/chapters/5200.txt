Chapter 5201: Only Villains Live Forever

Li Qiye returned to the old man’s courtyard. True Bear lay down on the steps outside and the old servant stood by the corner.

Li Qiye opened the door and placed the exalted lotus into the pond. Tiny laws pulsed from the flowers and took root in the pond, forming rhythmic ripples as a result.

The ripples seemed to be forming the image of the corpse that had been buried. It started showing signs of life with the soul returning. Nonetheless, this wasn’t an instant process.

A seal in front of the chest gradually melted into every inch of the corpse, seemingly re-creating the physical essence. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Previously, the seal was the only thing holding a silver of life back. It could last for an eternity but now, it was returning life back to the corpse.

This was akin to a seed receiving enough water and sunlight. Although the original plant was dead, it could always grow again under the right circumstances. This was the reason why Li Qiye left the seal behind in the past.

Meanwhile, the exalted lotus instilled its own effect into the pond.

“Pop! Pop! Pop!” Only top cultivators could sense this delicate addition.

Three thousand worlds filled with life seemed to be opening with the lotus and changed the courtyard.

“Mmm, not a bad smell, ominous energy is being chased away.” The old man who was relaxing on his chair took a sniff.

“If you want, I can sprinkle this essence on your corpse and bury it deep down. In my opinion, it’ll be preserved and smell good for years to come.”

“No thanks, save it for yourself.” The old man became annoyed.

“I won’t have the opportunity because when I die, I don’t think there will be a speck of dust left.” Li Qiye said.

“Not dying from old age, only villains.” The old man opened his eyes and said.

“That’s the right description for you.” Li Qiye said.

“No, only three are suitable with this description. You, him, and the villainous heaven.” The old man said.

“I can’t say that you’re wrong. Seems like the three of us have been cursed quite a bit by others.” Li Qiye thought about it before nodding.

“You’re pitiful.” The old man smiled: “You know what you are doing but how many give a damn? Most are afraid of you, some revile and despise you, a savior who blew himself up. You get nothing for your sacrifice.”

“Don’t pity me, I’m only doing it for myself. Buddha and the dao, all I seek is the dao. If I become the Buddha, that’s merely ancillary. Plus, I’ve never claimed to be the savior. Those who do usually destroy their own world eventually.” Li Qiye stared at the old man.

“Believe what you want.” The old man responded: “Even if you were to eliminate the villainous heaven, the inhabitants of the world will fear you instead.”

“The same way everyone fears the villainous heaven now, that’s fine.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“In a way, the villainous heaven is pitiful as well. Standing at the apex for countless epochs now, understood by no one.” The old man nodded.

“Really now?” Li Qiye looked up at the endless azure, thinking about an eternal existence that has been watching the myriad worlds.

Suddenly, a ship appeared above Imperial Attendant City, looking like a colossal fortress.

“What is that?!” The inhabitants beneath became startled.

“Sea Conch!” An expert recognized it right away.

“No, it’s Tang’s Emporium now.” A big shot from the last generation said.

Back in the courtyard, Li Qiye also looked up at the ship.

“Sea Conch was its old, old title. Boss Tang bought it and changed its name.” An ancestor commented.

“Tang’s Emporium? What a strange name for a ship.” A youth said.

“Boss Tang has an eccentric personality.” A senior shook his head.

“Rumble!” Thirteen bejeweled thrones appeared and floated in an arc in front of the ship.

“The auction shall commence in three days.” A lazy-sounding voice came from the ship.

“Another auction?!” This started an uproar throughout the city.

“Boss Tang is starting an auction soon!” This news spread swiftly across all four alliances, Lesser Firmament, Azure Peak, and Pure Land…

“I’ve been waiting a long time for this, more than ten thousand years now.” One powerful cultivator said.

Meanwhile, great existences in these powers stood up and opened their eyes.

“The greatest merchant is on the move again. What will be the prize?” An apex existence woke up from her slumber and murmured.

“We must have one of the thrones.” Everyone focused on the thirteen thrones.
