Chapter 4453: Dark Crow

The majestic figures of the emperors slowly dispersed just like their memories slowly being buried again in Li Qiye’s mind.

These intents and blessings have been guarding this nest for eras now, rendering it impossible for anyone to get close.

Their teamwork was impeccable and frightening. Previous emperors and dao lords couldn’t get close despite coming here in person.

Of course, Li Qiye’s handwave dispelled the seals because they existed to protect Li Qiye. His true body was here now so there was no need to be activated.

With them gone, the nest became exposed and he could see the thing laying in there - the corpse of a bird. Of course, it was a crow.

If anyone else were to see this, they would find it unfathomable. The nest was made from insane materials. It would be virtually impossible to find a second one in the entire world.

Everyone would think that this place contained some peerless secret or artifact. After all, the materials alone were priceless treasures. Thus, whatever in there must be even more precious, ten or a hundred times greater.

The only plausible answer must have something to do with immortality. In reality, it only had the corpse of a crow.

It didn’t look special at all and seemed to be just sleeping in the nest. If one had to pick something, then the feathers were darker and older than most crows. In other words, if normal crows could live for twenty to thirty years, then this one had somehow lived for fifty to sixty years. It gave the impression that it was a spirit or phantom of the night.

It seemingly endured the test of time for millions of years, treating this lengthy period as a mere blink of an eye. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It didn’t belong to the nine worlds or the reincarnation cycle. It gave the impression of being separated from all else - an entity unaffected by the laws of the world.

In reality, the state of its existence remained unknown, whether it was sleeping or already dead. Nonetheless, it certainly had peace in this place.

Li Qiye’s chest was heaving after seeing the crow since the past rushed back like a storm.

Back in a forgotten era, a crow flew out of Immortal Demon Grotto. It traveled around the nine worlds and ten domains for eras, crossing from one dimension to the next, and creating one miracle after another…

Others knew this being as the Dark Crow. Alas, they didn’t know about the soul trapped inside - the true mastermind behind it all. The soul started golden eras, trained unbeatable beings, and created monstrous lineages.

Numerous enemies shuddered in fear after hearing this title. The crow acted as the dark hand behind the curtain, controlling everything in an unstoppable manner.

Dark Crow - a title hated and loved, remembered and feared…

Some cursed it as an ominous entity or a butcher. Its appearance always ended with destruction and massacre. It reigned over others’ fate without mercy…

Few viewed it as the protector of the nine worlds - a leader leading many wise sages to battle to stop the Ancient Ming.

If it wasn’t for the crow, the nine worlds would have been fully dominated by this race and been subjected to slavery.

This was all in the past now. No one in Eight Desolaces remembered the protector and the butcher. This was because the top masters still alive to this day were either hibernating or keeping their mouth shut about this taboo matter.

Li Qiye picked up the crow. This was once his medium and now, his corpse. Everything started with it.

Later on, he regained his body and the crow disappeared from the river of time. The name, Li Qiye, replaced it.

He gently rubbed the hard feathers. They were tougher than any metal in existence, capable of blocking all attacks. When its wings were fully spread, they would blot out the sky like an iron curtain. Furthermore, they could be used as the sharpest swords as well.

He was overwhelmed with emotions, feeling as if he had returned to the Nine Worlds Epoch. Everything seemed like it was just yesterday. Of course, the reality was that they have turned into smoke. He was but alone.
