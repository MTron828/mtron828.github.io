Chapter 5438: Raising A Frog Or A Dragon?

“I suppose you’re right, I’m no passerby if the world is empty.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s why in order for you to play your favorite role, the world needs to be rather vibrant with life.” The old man said.

“You speak as if you’re still alive.” Li Qiye gave him the side eye.

“I’m infected by the mortal coil now.” The old man smiled.

Li Qiye smiled and could see that even this apex being couldn’t handle eternal loneliness.

“Let’s talk about something else. My legacy doesn’t mean much to you but it is still somewhat interesting.” The old man said.

“I see, then I’ll introduce you to someone.” Li Qiye said before telling True Bear to come in: “What do you think of this seedling for your legacy?”

“So average, not worthy of my legacy.” The old man said.

Li Qiye nodded and said: “Who in this world is worthy of your legacy and can shoulder it? Nonetheless, if you wish to do so, he has followed me for some time and I have laid a foundation for him. His nature is back to its origin so he will have a heart of a child in the future, a blank slate filled with curiosity.”

The old man stared at the bear who lay down on the ground, looking rather obedient.

“Things don’t always go as planned. He had passed down his legacy as well to someone deemed supreme.” Li Qiye said: “Do you want your legacy to pass down or do you want to keep on waiting?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Keep on waiting.” The old man said.

“Even if you keep on waiting for the perfect inheritor, they will not be able to surpass you. Even if I were to inherit it, I can’t surpass you in this dao either. The transcendence has to be internal, not through external grooming.” Li Qiye said.

The old man didn’t respond but knew Li Qiye was right.

“Then what’s the point of waiting?” Li Qiye said: “If it is a matter of passing down your legacy, he is rather suitable. Polished where necessary, consolidated where needed, a bestial nature returned to its origin will blossom into a heart of purity. I believe you will have a hard time finding a better candidate, not to mention needing to personally nurture and build a foundation yourself.”

“You make it sound like I’m taking advantage of you.” The old man grumbled.

“It’s just how kind I am, always considerate and thinking about what I can do for others. That’s why I’m doing my best to assist you with your idea.” Li Qiye said.

“Beneath the nice words loom all your nefarious intentions.” The old man sneered.

“To mistake kindness for treachery.” Li Qiye said: “Well, I’m generous enough to not take this excellent seedling for myself, that’s the reality of it.”

“You want him to go up.” The old man said.

“Think what you may, I can’t convince you otherwise.” Li Qiye shrugged in response.

“That’s right, you’re not fooling anyone with your plan.” The old man sneered.

“You’re not raising a frog in the well but a true dragon. Would the dragon always want to be cooped up in a small well? No, it wants to soar up to the heavens.” Li Qiye said.

“I can’t argue with that.” The old man said.

“Who are you but an apex existence in your prime? Your legacy can’t just stay in this small well.” Li Qiye went on.

“No need to flatter me.” The old man said coldly.

“Not flattering at all since you’re already dead, unlike the other geezers. You died thoroughly and even took care of your corpse, not causing any trouble. This is not to say that you didn’t cause enough trouble during death, but in my opinion, you are deserving of leaving your legacy behind.” Li Qiye said.

“Bah, speaking as if you’re the boss already.” The old man said: “Dark crow, I’m not falling for this.”

“I’m speaking the truth but this is also a reminder to you, I don’t always play nice if people start causing trouble.” Li Qiye responded.

“You never played nice.” The old man sneered.

“Let’s go back to the topic of you being thoroughly dead. There’s no chance anymore, right? So did you leave anything up there? A man of your grand stature certainly must have. Otherwise, it would be a little embarrassing since even the juniors left their mark. How impudent of them in that case.” Li Qiye said.

“Hmph.” The old man snorted but this was indeed a chord struck in his heart: “I am satisfied with how I spent my life.”

“The problem is that you’re a hungry ghost now.” Li Qiye smiled.

“And it’s all your fault.” The old man scowled.

“You can’t starve in death after starving for the majority of your life, that would be awfully tragic. You can’t lose face like this.” Li Qiye continued.

“Hmph, the others are just clowns. After the next sweep, they’ll all be ashes.” The old man became irate.

“And that is where you will win, standing above them and grasping eternal glory for you are still here. Be happy with this and give someone else a chance to climb up in your stead.” Li Qiye said.

“Since when are you so noisy, sticking your nose in someone else’s business?” The old man asked.

“Sigh, I owe you so I must work hard.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You just want some cannon fodders to pave the way.” The old man said.

“The truth is that even if you don’t do anything, it doesn’t affect me at all. I’m only worrying about your legacy.” Li Qiye shrugged.

The man fell into silence.

Li Qiye gently patted the bear’s head and said: “This seed is really not bad at all.”

“It can barely inherit ten to twenty percent of my legacy.” The old man said bluntly.

“Right, but who can inherit all of your legacy?” Li Qiye nodded.

].

The old man agreed - this was indeed an impossibility.

“If it were so easy, he wouldn’t have waited until now. He didn’t find a single one throughout the epochs.” Li Qiye said.

“And you?” The old man asked.

“I haven’t found one either. It’s already a blessing to find good seeds.” Li Qiye answered.

The old man stared at the bear again. He truly didn’t think that the bear was worthy of his legacy.

In reality, Li Zhitian, Li Xian’er, and any other geniuses were no different in his eyes. It was a matter of picking one ant or a different one. They were all ants in the end.

However, the bear had been polished by Li Qiye - this was its unique part.

“So, what do you think? Just ten to twenty percent should be enough for him to establish a foothold for your legacy there.” Li Qiye asked again.
