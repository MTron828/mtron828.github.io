Chapter 5163: Karma Is Everywhere

“Ah!” Skyshroud Divine Emperor was dismembered as well; his two halves fell to the ground.

In spite of his speed and masterful maneuvers, he couldn’t escape the frightening slash.

Three powerful cultivators were slain just like that before the speechless crowd. They were invincible in the mind of regular cultivators but now, a mysterious being killed them all without needing to actually be present.

Conquerors and even ancient emperors were insects in comparison.

“Anyone else got a problem here?” The voice spoke again while the skeletal sword remained in an offensive pose.

No one answered - not even Supreme or All-things Dao Lord. Everyone held their breath because even breathing right now could be construed as dissent.

“Good.” Li Qiye said before raising the skeletal sword for a throw.

“Whoosh!” It smashed into Heavenly Sword School’s ancestral ground, blowing everything into smithereens.

“Ahh!” The ancient ancestors and the upper echelon became ashes in the blink of an eye. They had no chance of putting up a fight.

This was karma for starting this mess - destroyed by a weapon made of their strongest ancient ancestor.

From start to finish, no one had an idea of who this being was. It was as if the entire world was not qualified to know his existence.

A few seconds later, those nearby felt the invisible hand dispersing and everything became normal once more. Windchaser and Harkrain Conqueror were nowhere to be seen.

There was no trace of the attacker either, only the destruction of Heavenly Sword and the corpses of three masters to remind everyone of the battle.

“Who is it?” Someone whispered after a long while.

“Is there anyone like this in the upper continents?” A dragon lord said softly.

These big shots kept a hushed tone, seemingly not wanting to offend someone.

“I don’t think so.” A knowledgeable ancient ancestor mused this issue: “Because if such a person exists, no alliance would stand a chance.”

Everyone felt that a being of this level joining an alliance would completely shift the balance.

“You don’t think an entire alliance can win?” A dragon lord said.

“Hmm, what about conquerors and dao lords with anima? The same for the ancient emperors and monarchs.” Someone asked.

However, these apex beings were in the immortal continent, either Immortal Dao City or Celestial Court.

“I just know that changes are coming after this.” One big shot gazed at the sky and commented on the destruction of Heavenly Sword.

“Sigh, another loss.” Jun Landu smiled wryly and shook his head.

Meanwhile, Windchaser and Harkrain Conqueror kneeled before Li Qiye.

He accepted their gesture and smiled: “Wonderful things still exist in this world, let us cherish and invest in them.”

“We will remember your guidance, Young Noble.” The two conquerors bowed again.

“You two have finally become official after this tribulation, the future is rather promising.” Jun Landu smiled.

The two of them bowed toward him as well, aware that Jun Landu was the driving force behind Li Qiye’s involvement.

He smiled and waved his hand, telling them to leave.

They knew that he didn’t like having guests in his courtyard so they obeyed.

The middle-aged man got up and didn’t say anything, only bowing toward Li Qiye before leaving.

After his departure, Jun Landu said: “Sir, the last few leisurely days weren’t so bad, right?”

“I don’t know how leisure I was.” Li Qiye smiled.

“The food still left a lingering taste. It’s a shame that I can only taste these delicious flavors alone. How boring.” He shook his head.

“A carefree life is enviable, I’m afraid I can’t be idle though.” Li Qiye said.

“Right, the mortal world cannot hold your ambition back. On the other hand, I prefer to stay here since I truly love it.” Jun Landu said.

Li Qiye gazed at Peace Village and said: “This blessed land is lucky to have you.”

“Or perhaps it is because of this blessed land that my life has some value.” Jun Landu said.

“Karma in everything.” Li Qiye patted his shoulder: “This world deserves a happy ending.”

“It is all due to the wise sages before us.” Jun Landu said: “I am just tagging along, more than content to just stay here.”

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, seemingly becoming one with Peace Village for an eternity.

“Must be nice.” Li Qiye said sentimentally. After a brief pause, he said: “This short break is over, it is time for me to leave.”

Jun Landu’s expression became serious. He got on his knees and respectfully bowed: “Sir, I’m not sure if we will ever meet again since I might be a pile of dirt upon your return. Being able to spend the last few days with you was an honor of a lifetime.”

“Meeting you has left me with joy as well.” Li Qiye smiled and bid farewell.
