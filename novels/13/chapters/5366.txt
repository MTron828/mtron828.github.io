Chapter 5367: Scram Now

Get down here?- this was just an ordinary request when given to anyone else. Alas, this was an entirely different matter when directed at Eternal Conqueror - a deliberate expression of disdain.

Remember, Eternal Conqueror was an apex cultivator. His equals - Sword Queen, Supreme, or anyone else - wouldn’t speak to him this way.

“His arrogance puts Ferocity to shame.” A dragon lord commented.

Ferocity was crazy enough but he couldn’t even be Li Qiye’s little brother.

“Is he suicidal?” An ancestor wondered.

Everyone could tell that Eternal Conqueror had a great personality. However, conquerors weren’t merciful once provoked.

Meanwhile, Eternal has been gazing at Li Qiye, seemingly thinking about something. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Eventually, he said: “Sir, you should come up instead.”

This was showing plenty of patience and respect. Someone else with the same level of prestige would have slapped an offender to death.

This also sounded like a challenge. Thus, Li Qiye became the center of attention again as people wondered whether he could actually keep up with Eternal Conqueror.

“Come down here.” Li Qiye reached for the dream tree - something ridiculous due to its colossal size.

Remember, it had worlds growing on its illusory frame. However, he somehow managed to raise it up with his hand.

“Impossible!” Jaws dropped to the ground after seeing this.

No cultivator could perform this feat, not even Eternal Conqueror. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have needed to climb up the leaves.

Nonetheless, Li Qiye didn’t need to use any merit law or technique to push up the tree and started shaking it violently.

Eternal Conqueror had a deep understanding of the dao so he could remain stable in even the most chaotic realm.

Alas, the heavenly dao itself was swaying to Li Qiye’s movement. This was enough to cause the conqueror to fall off the tree. Though he managed to land on his feet, this still astounded everyone.

“How can this be?!” Some shouted before becoming frozen.

A while ago, they speculated about Li Qiye’s true power. In order for him to fight Eternal Conqueror, he must climb up the leaves and reach the tenth one.

Unfortunately, their imagination didn’t reach the possibility of him shaking the tree and forcing the conqueror to come back down.

Eternal Conqueror himself was gauging Li Qiye, intending to find out more about this unfathomable man. He didn’t expect to lose stability in this manner.

“We’re seeing the same thing, right?” Someone else commented.

“I told you politely to come down. It’s too late to be civil now, scram.” Li Qiye casually lifted the tree as if it were just a tiny branch.

He then swung it, leaving a long trail of illusory effects behind. Everyone became lost since they were affected by the swing as well - unable to tell dreams from realities.

This mirrored the effects of the illusory worlds, albeit amplified. They thought that they could live here forever.

There was no need to train or cultivate - everything was possible with a single thought. No one wanted to leave this state of endless possibilities.

Eternal Conqueror had to stabilize his dao heart in order to prevent himself from succumbing to desires.

“Boom!” He activated Eternity once more, breaking all the shackles of the dream world.

He displayed his supremacy, being the first to escape from this illusory trap.
