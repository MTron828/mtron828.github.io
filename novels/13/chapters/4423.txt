Chapter 4424: My Son

Blood once again wafted in the air and lingered at the tip of the nose. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Once the crowd could think again, they realized the implications of the situation.

“What the hell is this saber art?” Even an ancestor became startled.

In reality, calling it a saber art was an understatement. The ancestors of the east and the demon monarchs of Dragon had only one word to describe it - swift.

“Impeccable swiftness.” One of them commented.

“How did he do it?” This became the next question. Merit laws and the grand dao couldn’t explain it.

In terms of cultivation and power, Li Qiye couldn’t take on any of the three elders. Moreover, they all attacked at the same time without holding back.

Alas, he easily decapitated them. Whatever he did, it didn’t cause any power ripple. He didn’t channel his vitality and chaos energy either. The attack didn’t seem to be a part of cultivation or any other dao in existence.

“Incredible.” Ancient Treant sighed and said.

The members of the east couldn’t believe what they were seeing. On the other hand, a southern expert who has been paying attention to Li Qiye shrugged and said: “That’s Li Qiye for you, no one else can treat Dragon like crap and replicate the same feat here.”

Of course, he kept his volume awfully low. Li Qiye has been making a name for himself in the south. For example, numerous witnessed the spectacular fight between him and Celestial Tiger.

These men knew just how devilish and inscrutable he was, akin to an abyss always ready to devour people.

“Your turn.” Li Qiye smiled and swung the saber in order to clear off the blood. Only one drop slid off in a beautiful fashion.

“You!” The ex-sect master staggered backward. Alas, he realized that this was unbecoming of him and took one step forward, arching his chest forward.

He couldn’t show weakness due to his status but most importantly, his renowned son.

“Insane villain, you dare to kill our elders?!” He shouted, thinking that he must weather all storms.

His son would become the next dao lord, so as his father, he would need to experience enough tribulations and defeat them all. He must never relent not only for his own sake but for his son’s prestige.

“And?” Li Qiye didn’t think that it was a big deal. Others would have thought about it carefully because they would risk becoming enemies with Five-sun School and a potential dao lord.

“My son will exterminate your clans and enslave the survivors…” The ex-sect master uttered coldly.

“I know, I know, your son. We’ve been over this, I will kill you right now and wait for him to come. However, I’ll let you in on a cruel truth, if he dares to seek revenge, I’ll decapitate him too.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You!” The ex-sect master nearly vomited blood from anger. His face turned red as he bellowed: “You shameless fool! My son will be a dao lord, completely invincible and unbeatable. Once he does, he’ll use your bones as stepping stones…”

“Got it.” Li Qiye gestured: “Now that we got that out of the way, it’s time for you to go on your way.” Having said that, he walked towards the ex-sect master.

“Fellow Daoist, know when to stop. You are an incredible talent and so is Our Majesty. Would you be interested in…” Featherhat Paragon interjected, wanting to recruit Li Qiye instead.

“Not interested, keep on blabbering and I’ll decapitate you too.” Li Qiye interrupted.

“!!!” Featherhat turned red as well. He was a famous ancestor before joining Five-sun King as one of the eight paragons. He appreciated Five-sun King’s talent and potential for the future, hence his support. He had never experienced being treated with contempt before.

“I will give you the chance to go first.” Li Qiye raised his saber.

All eyes were on the ex-sect master of Five-sun. The atmosphere became heavy once more.

They saw Li Qiye’s swift slash earlier, or at least they knew that it was a slash. Even the ex-sect master didn’t see it clearly. None thought that they could stop the same quick draw.

The ex-sect master was no exception, hence his hesitation. Alas, he couldn’t jump off the tiger right now. Running before the fight would mean destroying his sect’s reputation and his son’s prestige.

As for the spectators, the powerful ones wanted to use him as an experiment. They hoped to see the attack again in order to gain a greater understanding.

“Can he stop it?” One expert asked a friend.

“Hard to say. The ex-sect master isn’t that exceptional but he’s still stronger than those elders. His treasures should be better too.” The friend shook his head and paused for a moment before continuing: “Well, the elders also didn’t take their foe seriously enough. He won’t repeat this mistake.”

Those nearby agreed with this assessment. Would a fast or inscrutable stepping technique be enough to dodge the slash? The ex-sect master at least knew what was coming.

“Let’s see how fast your blade is!” The ex-sect master bit his teeth and made up his mind. He would rather die than surrender and shame his son.

Moreover, he still believed that he could stop Li Qiye. Speed alone shouldn’t be enough.

“Well, it doesn’t matter how fast it is since it won’t save you, I’ll flay you alive!” He added, seemingly wanting to give himself more confidence.

“You won’t have the chance, I’m afraid. The same for your son if he isn’t smart enough to tuck his tail between his legs.” Li Qiye smiled.
