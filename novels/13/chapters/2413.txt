“Crown prince, huh? Should be amusing.” Li Qiye returned to the eastern palace and smiled, unaffected by his new role.

It was an unbelievable matter. Lucidity King appointed a stranger like him to be the crown prince. Meanwhile, this stranger didn’t give a damn at all as if it was no big deal.

This was bizarre and unexplainable. No one would believe this story.

Lucidity - a calculating and imperious person that leaves nothing to chance - acted like a senile old man.

Remember, not to mention the great powers and other sects in the system, War Saint Dynasty had plenty of geniuses. Many of them came from Lucidity’s main branch.

Though they weren’t related to him by blood, they were still considered his clan members and part of the royal institution. But now, he skipped all of them and the powerful ancestors just to choose a stranger.

This was excessively unreasonable, borderline insanity. He knew nothing about Li Qiye outside of his name.

If Lucidity were to pass it on to his most trusted confidant, Sun Lengying; most would be able to take it. After all, Lengying has always been in charge of killing. No one could rationalize the king’s choice.

Li Qiye’s nonchalant attitude was just as strange. Even if he didn’t care about a system, he should be thinking about Lucidity’s intent. Or, perhaps he has seen through everything and that this development was within expectations. All in all, no one knew what he was thinking since all he did was smile after being appointed.

Someone else came to visit Li Qiye on the same day.

“Your Highness.” This person bowed respectfully and said: “I am here to report for duty under the order of His Majesty.”

This middle-aged man had a proper and righteous appearance, both in stature and facial features. His features were stalwart, resembling an artistic statue.

His eyes were bright and serious like gems. He wore a green robe, looking quite experienced and fierce like a soldier. He looked indifferent yet respectful.

There was no powerful and domineering aura but as he was standing there, the orders nearby bent to his whims. Any insightful person could tell that he was an Eternal.

Ever since his ascension, Li Qiye has met one Eternal after another.

This wasn’t strange at all. In Myriad, an Eternal was considered a mighty and rare existence. They were also strong in Imperial but far from being uncommon.

Moreover, War Saint Dynasty was the strongest kingdom in Imperial, standing at the apex. It wouldn’t be strange for it to have plenty of Eternals.

How could they maintain their position without sufficient fighting forces?

“What is your name?” Li Qiye gave a quick glance.

“Your Highness, this servant’s name is Zhang Jiadi. My previous position was the captain of the imperial guards. Now, I am here to be your guard captain, ready for your orders.” The man solemnly said while standing straight.

If someone else in the system were to hear his name, their first reaction would be astonishment.

He was a powerful and famous Eternal. Of course, far inferior compared to Lucidity and not comparable to Lengying.

An ordinary True God wasn’t qualified to be the captain of the imperial guards for Lucidity. A strong Eternal was more suitable.

Plus, who could actually assassinate someone as strong as Lucidity? Being his guard captain was quite an easy job.

“So you will obey all of my orders?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Rest assured, Your Highness, His Majesty has given me an order to obey you, so your orders are his orders. I will not refuse.” Jiadi said seriously. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

An Eternal was a big shot anywhere, including Nine Secrets and War Saint Dynasty. However, surprisingly enough, Jiadi didn’t think highly of himself, preferring to assume the role of a disciplined soldier.

“Sounds like you are utterly devoted to the king.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Your Highness, His Majesty has given me a second life while my parents gave me the first. I am here today thanks to him.” Jiadi didn’t hide this.

Zhang Jiadi used to be an ordinary soldier, a nobody in the mortal world.

During a particular march, Lucidity actually noticed this mortal soldier. The next part was even more unbelievable - Lucidity handed him the Four Divine Transformations from the Lucidity Pill Scripture. [1]

This was a big deal. Keep in mind that this scripture came from Emperor Zheng, the most amazing True Emperor of the system. Nine Secrets was on a downward trend during his youth. After becoming emperor, he revitalized the system and made War Saint Dynasty the untouchable leader.

Later on, the future generations also added him into the Radiant Decemvirate.

Emperor Zheng’s Lucidity Pill Scripture was rumored to be on the same level as Nine Secrets, the laws left behind by their progenitor.

Nine Secrets belonged to the entire system, but Lucidity Pill Scripture was possessed only by War Saint Dynasty.

Thus, one could imagine how important it was to the dynasty. Normally, they would never give it out to an outsider, not even just one part.

However, no one could stop the imperious Lucidity King. Not a single soul said anything after this act, including the ancestors of War Saint Dynasty.

Zhang Jiadi didn’t let him down and proved that he was right. After receiving the four transformations, he embarked on the path of cultivation. The ordinary mortal displayed an amazing gift for cultivation to the point of being devilish.

He sped through the levels and eventually became an Eternal, not quite as strong as Lengying but more than enough to sweep through the realms. Moreover, his dedication and loyalty remained, always acting as just another soldier.

The unhappy ancestors no longer commented about this matter among themselves after seeing his success.

“Loyalty is a virtue indeed.” Li Qiye smiled.

“His Majesty will let Your Highness pick several treasures for protection, do you mind following me to the treasury?” Jiadi said respectfully.

Jiadi knew nothing about this fameless stranger who is clearly weak at cultivation. One could easily find so many youths like him in Nine Systems.

Someone like this shouldn’t be able to order an Eternal. However, Jiadi has always followed his orders and wouldn’t look down on Li Qiye just because the guy was weak. Doing it half-heartedly was out of the question as well.

The moment Lucidity sent him here, Li Qiye became his master. This was the reason why Jiadi was amazing and why Lucidity chose him for this task.
