Chapter 5103: Incoming Battle

Meanwhile, the ancient ancestors and dragon lords of The People worried after seeing Deity’s conquerors.

Whenever cultivators from above descended, this would change the landscape of the lower continents. This was because they would linger around for a while.

In this case, they rebuilt the broken sects and could go on to subdue the enemies. No other lineages could hope to stop four high-level conquerors.

In fact, being subdued was most likely the best fate. Destruction could happen as well after one wrong move.

This was a rather rare occurrence. Something big must have happened. Now, if Imperial and Dao Alliance were to not send anyone down, it would be over for those from The People in the lower continents.

Thus, the spines that have been broken by Li Qiye became straight again in no time at all.

“We are unbeatable as long as Celestial Court is around!” They proudly declared with pride.

During this pathetic crisis, conquerors were immediately sent down.

“Punish the perpetrators severely and rebuild order!” A stern voice echoed across the realms.

The speaker was none other than Greenmountain Conqueror. This scared the hell out of everyone from The People.

“Punish those who had offended Deity too!” Others from The Race demanded.

“Yes, make an example out of them, no one is allowed to trample on The Race’s dignity.” Some ancestors expressed their attitude.

Not long ago, they were afraid of Li Qiye and didn’t dare to say anything. Now, though they didn’t say his name outright, everyone knew the target.

“We demand an explanation for the destruction of Godchaser and Swordgrasp.” Six-pot Conqueror spoke.

“Where is Li Qiye?!” Ascension Conqueror shouted.

“I’m ready for your reason for destroying Swordgrasp.” Vessel Conqueror’s voice was pleasant but no one dared to underestimate her.

“Can Li Qiye stop them?” The ancestors of the People wondered.

One dragon lord said: “Li Qiye is unbeatable but there are too many conquerors on the other side.”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Hmph, this is the end of the roar for him, this is the result of antagonizing us.” A weak cultivator from The Race snorted.

“This is just what happens when Celestial Court decides to unleash its wrath. Only death awaits.” Another said.

“The bees are buzzing in full force today, so annoying.” A lazy voice answered the conquerors.

Everyone shut up right away, even those from The Race who were spewing threats earlier. The latter still didn’t dare to be so direct toward Li Qiye.

“Did you destroy Swordgrasp?!” Six-pot Conqueror directed her power toward Li Qiye.

“And what if I did?” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

“You deserve death for destroying my sect.” Six-pot Conqueror’s words resonated like a bell.

Terrifying shockwaves soared toward Eight-stallion Dynasty and suppressed everyone along the way.

“Give him a chance to defend himself.” Ascension Conqueror said.

“Li Qiye, come to Mountain of the Ages. We shall listen to reason.” Greenmountain Conqueror demanded, not leaving any room for negotiation.
