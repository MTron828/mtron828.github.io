Chapter 4844: Eight-stallion Dao Lord

He had connections with pretty women since his arrival. This included the saintesses and queens from Deity Lineage. All in all, there have been too many to count.

He didn’t discriminate against his lovers' backgrounds. It didn’t matter if they were from The Race or The People, a great power or a minor sect.

Thus, spectators weren’t surprised to see him with two women. In fact, it would be more shocking to see him alone.

Though he appeared to be walking to his death, he still had female companions who might actually be willing to die with him. This was his peerless charisma and charm.

The scene became silent again with his arrival.

As for The People, especially in Chaos, they had nothing but respect and fear for him. They would prostrate even though he didn’t activate his aura. After all, he had brought a thousand years of relative peace to the continent.

A six-dao fruit cultivator had no reason to linger in Chaos yet he chose to stay while dealing with villains and bandits.

As for The Race, many of them despised him. Leaving his aggression in battles aside, he had charmed countless beauties from their side including even empresses and queens.

They considered themselves superior and looked down on The People. Thus, they didn’t appreciate being cuckolded by him. Alas, there was nothing they could do considering his power.

The boyfriends and husbands wanted nothing more than to cut him to pieces. Unfortunately, They lacked the power to avenge their lost pride and honor.

Eventually, the carriage stopped right outside the battlefield. The dao lord stood up while embracing both women.

He was remarkably handsome. If anyone here were to see Shen Juntian, they would notice a striking similarity between the two. It’s just that the dao lord had more of a playful air to him.

He wore a tight upper robe with sleeves tied around his waist and a gilded collar. He left his chest exposed, revealing his impressive muscles. They brimmed with strength; each muscle looked like a dragon wanting to break out.

His skin was flawless as well and drove women mad with jealousy. His trousers were black - a style different than the monochromatic one seen in the lower three realms.

A perfect appearance with an unconventional bad boy attitude - a combination that could attract any woman. Shen Juntian lacked the same pull and sexiness when compared to his father.

“So this is Eight-stallion Dao Lord.” The crowd was in awe.

In fact, even his cuckolded victims had no choice but to accept inferiority. Hating him was one thing, accepting reality was another.

Cultivators had no problem changing their physical appearance. Alas, the aura and demeanor were difficult to duplicate.

Eight-stallion possessed unrestrained confidence and regality. Those as strong as him didn’t have the same qualities.

Women who saw him for the first time became stunned. Some princesses and saintess were caught in his web right away.

“I see why he has his reputation. It’s easy to become enamored with him.” One girl said.

“Your Majesty.” The powerful cultivators from The People came over to greet him.

There existed a stark contrast between the reception of two equally prestigious cultivators. Conceal Conqueror instilled fear into others, causing them to tremble.

On the other hand, Eight-stallion Dao Lord was personable despite wearing a metaphorical crown. People couldn’t get tired of staring at him while they avoided Conceal Conqueror.

“Alright, ladies, it is time for me to enter the stage.” Eight-stallion kissed both women passionately while rubbing certain places.

“Go, the world awaits you.” Having said that, he let go and laughed heartily, blessing them with a radiant grand dao.

“We are willing to die with you.” They didn’t want to leave.

“Don’t be silly, the world is so beautiful and its many wondrous things await you two.” He shook his head in response.

They were top cultivators and knew that this fight didn’t bode well for him. This might be his last day in this world and they wanted to die with him.

“Don’t jinx me now, the battle has yet to start yet you two are acting like it’s my funeral.” He laughed and said.

Everyone watched quietly and gave him time to say goodbye.

The women’s eyes became slightly moist as they hugged and kissed him again before whispering: “You will always be my king, Your Majesty.”

Having said that, the two of them flew into the horizon and disappeared. They didn’t cry and scream because they didn’t want to hurt his prestige. Weeping was unsightly.

Others were envious and jealous of him - to have two beauties willing to die with him - how lucky.

Eight-stallion stretched once before releasing his power. “Boom!” 

The crowd became tense right away. Earlier, he was a slumbering dragon but now, it has woken up and entered a state of battle. Its breaths alone could topple mountains and empty the oceans.

He took one step forward and entered the battlefield. Unfortunately, the peak that he stepped on couldn’t handle his power and crumbled.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“My beautiful Conceal, we meet again. It’s been a while since our last battle, I still can’t forget about it.” Eight-stallion smiled and said.
