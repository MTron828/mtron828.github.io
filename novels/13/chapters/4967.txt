Chapter 4968: Supreme Woman In Space

Dao laws constantly evolved in this place in an eternal cycle. This seemed to be the center of heaven and earth - the origin of the grand dao.

The pavilions here had an ancient architectural style. No one could pinpoint it to a particular epoch. The walls were engraved with strange beasts with no resemblance to known species.

Each building emitted a timeworn aura, perhaps representing a unique golden age. They have witnessed the passage of time. An era in the outside world was but the blink of an eye here.

Such was the resplendence of this place that no amount of embellishment would do it justice. Calling it a home of immortals was not unreasonable.

Living beings felt the urge to prostrate regardless of how powerful they were. This included conquerors and dragon lords.

“Whoosh!” The divine mountain entered the ethereal region and slowed down, akin to a ship slowly making its way to the port, finally back home after a long journey.

“Commendable exploration ability, to actually find this again after so many epochs.” Li Qiye stared at the palace nearby and smiled.

“Young man, state your purpose and affiliation.” Once the mountain stopped, a voice came from above.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It seemed to be the core of the entire dimension. All the powers and affinities in this place originated from it.

Anyone who heard this voice would immediately kneel and assume the role of a junior. It was both dignified and commanding.

Its profound nature made it impossible to determine the speaker’s sex. It also didn’t seem to be coming from the present but rather, an extinguished epoch or the unknown future.

“Little girl, don’t you recognize me? Come out already.” Li Qiye smiled and said. His hushed words could be heard clearly.

“Who are you?!” The voice was startled.

A heavenly eye seemed to be manifesting into reality from above. Nothing changed visibly; only powerful cultivators could see a gaze descending upon Li Qiye.

“It’s you!” The voice suddenly changed into that of a pleasant girl, no longer as intimidating as before.

Her words had a dao harmonization that brightened heaven and earth.

“Buzz.” Particles poured down and coalesced into a woman. Using words to describe her beauty was offensive since she was blessed by all that the heaven could offer.

She resembled an immortal from an upper realm. All women would feel ashamed in her presence. Even the proudest would need to lower their head.

There was something transcending and peerless about her presence. Only surviving numerous epochs could culminate in this unique aura.

“I’m happy for you, you’ve not only escaped but re-created yourself. Not only that, you even comprehended your own epoch. You are fully healed now.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I owe it to you.” Her smile came from the heart; her mood affected the world itself.

“It’s been a while.” He said.

“We’ve met before but that was only a remnant avatar, not the current me.” She said.

“I know.” He nodded.

She sat down next to Li Qiye and observed the stars with him.

“I thought that we wouldn’t meet again.” She said softly.

“You probably didn’t even want to see me in the past, why the excitement today?” He joked.

“It’s because you were a bastard.” She pouted at him and said.

“That’s not new at all, if I were nicer, I wouldn’t have survived long enough to meet you right now.” He said.

“Only you can justify your shamelessness.” She nodded in agreement.

Li Qiye had helped her re-create herself in the past. Not only was she successful, she even managed to trace back time and create her own era again.

In the past, she was a supreme existence but was crucified in an ambush, nearly turning to ashes. Now, she became the ultimate existence at the academy.

“I thought that you were dead but then again, bastards have no problem surviving this long.” She said.

“You don’t even know, I nearly died a few times but fortune has my back.” He shook his head.

“A lucky crow? Is that even possible?” She laughed. It has been a long time since she had met an old friend so she was in a great mood.

“I can’t deny that.” He waved his hand and said.

“Are you here only to visit me?” She stared at him. Her eyes seemed to contain all the spiritual energy in the world.

“You speak as if I’m here to seek a favor. No, I only want to meet a close friend and I’ve traveled so far too.” He responded.

“As if. You’re the type to never get out of bed to visit anyone unless there is something in it for you.” She smiled: “The dao is emotionless, and so are you.”

“That’s hurtful.” Li Qiye rubbed his chest and said: “I always thought of myself as a caring person who loves this world and its inhabitants.”

“A butcher talking about loving his victims?” She said.
