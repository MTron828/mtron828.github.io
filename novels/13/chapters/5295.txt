Chapter 5296: Most Pitiful Conqueror

This famous conqueror hailed from Heaven Alliance, capable of controlling elemental forces to destroy his enemies.

However, the crowd members didn’t remember his past exploits or his impressive presence.

“Godcloud Conqueror, his wife cheated on him, right? Even birthed a daughter with someone else.” An expert whispered to his group.

“Smack!” A senior immediately smacked the back of his head and glared at him.

His wife, an imperial queen, cheated on him with Three Truth Dao Lord from Eight Desolaces. The world didn’t know the reason why for this occurrence.

First, Three Truth Dao Lord was known to be a particularly upright cultivator. Why did he have an affair with a married woman?

Sure, there were emperors in history who had a wife-stealing fetish or had a fancy for imperial daughters. This did not apply to Three Truth Dao Lord who displayed unparalleled integrity, never participating in any questionable activities.

It was one thing for the famous duck egg buyer to do this due to his reputation. It just didn’t make sense for Three Truth.

Nonetheless, this escalated to the point where Celestial Court became involved. Godcloud Conqueror led powerful allies for a hunt.

This put Dao and Imperial Alliance in a tough position. After all, Three Truth was in the wrong here and Godcloud had the right to obtain revenge. 

Though he was powerful, he couldn’t handle fighting several emperors and conquerors at the same time. Just moments before his death, Darkfrost Dao Lord appeared and prevented the enemies from desecrating his corpse, also saving his daughter.

Three Truth entrusted his daughter to Darkfrost with his remaining breaths. Given her own circumstances, she couldn’t take care of the infant and had to leave it to Dao Alliance.

The alliance sent her down to the lower continents and asked the prominent figures there to take care of her. This finally brought an end to the turmoil triggered by the affair between The Race and The People.

The baby sent down to the lower continents was none other than Truth Conqueror. Of course, another victim was Godcloud Conqueror whose reputation was ruined by the ordeal.

People stopped talking about his feats in battle, only how he was cheated on. Although he had killed Three Truth Dao Lord, the humiliation persisted.

Nonetheless, no one dared to be too blatant in front of him. After all, he could easily obliterate most cultivators.

“Buzz.” A phoenix rider with a five-colored radiance appeared behind the barrier.

The bird had wonderful runes, especially the ones on its back. They exuded a sense of virtue, impressing everyone with their appearance.

“Immortal Emperor Guan Feng!” The crowd shouted.

The ancient emperor wore a feathered robe and seemed untouchable just like an immortal. He loved the mythical beast and anything related. After spending his whole life with this obsession, he finally obtained a phoenix mount.

“Godcloud, Heaven Alliance has no influence here.” The noble emperor said.

“Lesser Firmament is suspected of hiding sinners, hand them over immediately.” Godcloud took out a badge belonging to Supreme.

Listeners became emotional because the word “sinner” was rarely used in the present day due to its historical significance. Why did Heaven Alliance bring it up? Who was Lesser Firmament hiding?

The emperor shot out a divine beam with ancient mysteries, easily destroying the badge.

“Return from whence you came, Supreme and Heaven Alliance cannot order us.” Guan Feng said.

“Poof!” A lantern suddenly manifested into reality. Its light pulsed outward in waves and illuminated the region.

Within the light was a fiery conqueror. Instead of sizzling, his flames released the wails of the burned victims.

“Lantern Conqueror!” The big shots recognized him as well.

Originally a lantern, he managed to reach the dao and was acknowledged by Heaven Alliance, eventually joining it.

He displayed his formidable power during Emperor War, burning numerous gods and dragon lords to death. Their screams still echoed even now.

“We demand an answer.” He said while the flame flickered, seemingly eager to burn Lesser Firmament.

“Lesser Firmament answers to no one.” A scholarly swordsman glided through the air and interjected: “Dao Alliance is here to assist Lesser Firmament.”

“Skysword Dao Lord!” The crowd naturally recognized this famous cultivator.

“Heaven Alliance shall be no more.” An ancient and dreadful voice echoed across the upper continents.

Just the voice alone could crush the myriad realms. Everyone had to look up at him.

“Illumination!” Skysword Conqueror’s expression changed after hearing the voice.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Illumination Conqueror!” Everyone became startled.

Although Illumination Conqueror was not actually present, his words alone struck everyone like lightning.
