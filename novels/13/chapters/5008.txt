Chapter 5009: Skystomper God

The three were top experts currently in the lower continents. This went double for Tendril King and Jun Cuican due to their immense future potential.

Few had enough clout to invite them to a banquet in the outside world, let alone Demon. Thus, their presence showed just how much respect they had for Golden Cicada King.

 Meanwhile, guests kept pouring into the palace.

“Boom!” Three large figures with immense auras landed. People had to look up to see them since they were as large as mountains.

“Guardian giants of the pagoda.” The guests clamored.

All three had five sacred fruits - this was a force to be reckoned with regardless of the time and place.

An old man stood in the center of the three. His expression was chilling and intimidating enough to make everyone's knees buckle. He had six fruits, clearly the strongest in the crowd right now.

“Brother Guardian, it is an honor to have you here.” Golden Cicada King rushed over and enthusiastically greeted him.

The other guests were received by his disciples but he took care of the important guests.

“You’re too kind, Brother Golden Cicada.” The guardian said politely. The group gave Golden Cicada plenty of face by participating in person.

“Everyone’s here, I see.” Guardian Pagoda didn’t appear arrogant or impolite, only indifferent.

Swordgrasp Venerable came from Deity so they had a good relationship. He came over to chat as well.

Tendril King and Jun Cuican were juniors so they stood up to greet the guardian. Nonetheless, despite being a stronger senior, he didn’t show any disrespect.

After all, it was only a matter of time before they surpass him. It might not be a long period either so it would be pointless to act like an imperious ancestor.

“Buzz.” Space rippled and two old men appeared above the palace. One wore a plain robe with white flowers embroidered on it - a sign of mourning. The other old man wore a blue robe and hovered proudly in the air.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

They had the presence of gods without needing to show off.

“Dual-wheel Gods of Heaven Burial!” Many big shots were startled, not expecting to see these ancient ancestors here today.

“Two ancient ancestors from Heaven Burial, Skystomper God’s junior brothers.” One guest said.

The two of them raised their hands and created a rippling portal. Another cultivator of a similar age walked out from within.

“Boom!” As he took one step forward, it sounded as if the sky was being trampled upon along with everyone else. This immobilized both humans and demons.

He held a heavenly wheel - an ultimate treasure exuding immense divinity. Even dragon lords trembled at its sight.

“Skystomper God…” Tendril King murmured.

This was the strongest ancient ancestor of Heaven Burial. Putting his six sacred fruits aside, he was feared due to his treasure - Skystomper Wheel, a weapon rumored to be left behind by Heaven Burial Conqueror.

Heaven Burial Lineage had produced numerous top masters and he was one of them. However, none of them could break the mold established by the conqueror and still chose to wield his weapon.

Tendril King wondered about the situation - why did Golden Cicada King invite so many top ancient ancestors here today?

“Long time no see, Brother Skystomper.” Golden Cicada greeted the three masters from Heaven Burial.

“Indeed, Brother Golden Cicada.” Skystomper smiled as if he was speaking to an old friend.

After walking into the palace, he greeted Pagoda Guardian since they were on the same level.

“Long time no see, I didn’t expect you to get an invitation from Brother Golden Cicada.” Pagoda Guardian said.

“I’m not only here for the banquet, there is a brat I must kill.” Skystomper glanced at the crowd and caused them to shudder. No one dared to meet his gaze.

“Who?” Pagoda Guardian asked.

“His name is Li Qiye.” Skystomper’s bloodthirst surged, causing the temperature to drop.

Many exchanged glances; they had heard about Li Qiye killing Halo Monarch already.

Skystomper God was clearly here for revenge because the monarch was both his descendant and direct disciple. They came prepared this time - three ancient ancestors and an ultimate artifact.

“I’ve heard of him before.” Divine Guardian said.

“Sorcery is one way to describe him.” Jun Cuican said, not daring to underestimate Li Qiye.

“So what, he will die for opposing Deity.” Divine Guardian said, releasing his domineering divinity.

“I absolutely agree, no one can oppose our lineage.” Another fierce voice echoed across the region.

A radiance added a layer to everything like flowing mercury. A world of light emerged above the palace and illuminated those beneath.
