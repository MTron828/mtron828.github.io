Chapter 5889: Let Me Go

Twilight neither confirmed nor denied Li Qiye’s claims.

“Looks like I got most of it right.” Li Qiye stretched and said: “Now, to find out.”

“Let some riddles be left unanswered.” Twilight said.

“I’m afraid you can’t stop me from solving them, nor can anyone else. You have nothing to put on the table for negotiation.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I do have something to say.” Twilight retreated a few steps backward.

Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind because the guy had exposed himself. Any attempt to escape was futile since he was trapped inside the cage.

Stonesplitter who had lost to Li Qiye understood the difference in power. Twilight shouldn’t even try to bring down Li Qiye with him; he would just look like a fool.

“About what?” Li Qiye asked.

By this point, nothing could tempt Li Qiye enough to spare him. Paragon artifacts weren’t worthy of his time, so making a deal appeared impossible.

“Release me in exchange for Eight Desolaces.” Twilight said softly.

It didn’t sound like a threat but still shocked everyone, especially the dao lords from Eight Desolaces - nearly exclaiming in astonishment.

“Eight Desolaces as a trade?!” Some of them turned pale.

Was their home under his control now? An overlord wouldn’t sprout random lies.

However, this couldn’t be the case because new dao lords were still ascending to the six continents. They felt rather confused because his base was in the immortal continent. How was Eight Desolaces his bargaining chip?

As for Stonesplitter, he was born at the beginning of Trinity Epoch and possessed more knowledge. His expression changed as he murmured: “He’s not without help. There is someone else in Eight Desolaces. No wonder why there was something off about the ambush back then.”

“Wanted to see me shocked and nervous?” Li Qiye was not surprised to hear this, still wearing a smile on his face.

Twilight’s eyes narrowed upon seeing Li Qiye’s lack of reaction.

“You do not care, Sacred Teacher?” He asked; his expression changed beneath the veil.

This was another of his ace cards to use against Li Qiye. If this didn’t work, that would be the end of him.

“What do you want me to say? We all know that I am not a saint who pities all living beings. Calling me a villain isn’t wrong either because of my previous massacres. Of course, I draw the line way before devouring fleshes for subsistence. The question is, do I care about Eight Desolaces?” Li Qiye responded.

Listeners didn’t comment on this since they have done their fair share of slaughtering. In fact, they appreciated and respected him for never falling into the darkness like the other overlords. Protecting the world against his own interest would be too much to ask for.

“It’s a reasonable response. What will you do, let me go for Eight Desolaces’ safety?” Twilight understood this didn’t look good for him.

“This world doesn’t need my protection.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “The moment you showed up today, you were destined for death. The only agency you have left in this short time is either committing suicide or dying to me.”

“The destruction of Eight Desolaces and the refinement of its inhabitants mean nothing to you, Sacred Teacher?” Twilight couldn’t stay calm.

The crowd was split into two sides - those from the six continents felt nothing because they had no attachment to Eight Desolaces.

However, the Immortal Emperors and dao lords stared intensely at Li Qiye since this was their old home at risk.

If Li Qiye chose to focus on killing Twilight Hunter, Eight Desolaces would be destroyed.

“How delusional that I would concede in this case, do you think too highly of yourself or too lowly of me.” Li Qiye said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Twilight was taken aback and felt himself being at a complete disadvantage since his threat did not affect Li Qiye.

“Sacred Teacher, if you watch your epoch devoured without a care, how is that different from falling into the darkness?” He took a deep breath and said.

“Are you sure you understand the definition of falling? You might be influenced by the old man and think that if it’s not light, it’s darkness.” Li Qiye retorted.
