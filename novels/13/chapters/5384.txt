Chapter 5385: Mantis, Cicada, And Oriole

The laws of the prison were infused with primordial chaos - meaning that the power of life was constantly being derived.

Within the strands was the initial formation of life, making it feel as if one were lying in a field of grass. The blades of grass exuded lifeforce and a comforting scent - nearly enough to make Ye Fantian forget about her current dilemma.

“All-things!” The prison constantly exuding life derivation made its owner rather obvious.

“All-things Dao Lord!” Everyone understood that the guardian of Dao Alliance had arrived as well.

Before possessing an immortal shell and anima, she still couldn’t stop these apex dao lords and conquerors. Therefore, her movement techniques and various methods were useless.

“Boom!” A hand accompanied by gentle spring breezes descended, seemingly blowing life into all creation while pulling up the prison.

“Stop!” Swordsea Dao Lord immediately delivered a devastating slash at the prison.

The resulting sparks alone could destroy stars. Alas, this was not enough to stop All-things from leaving the scene.

Illumination didn’t linger around either and left as well. Ye Fantian had been captured by All-things so there was no point in fighting the enraged Swordsea. Swordsea didn’t give up and followed in the same direction as All-things.

Once they were gone, the spectators could finally breathe again. The auras of the three apex cultivators suffocated them the entire time.

Ancestors and lords got up from the ground and took a deep breath, feeling lucky for surviving this potential disaster. This battle could have obliterated the entire region and taken them down as well.

“The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.” A dragon lord calmed down and said softly.

“Illumination Conqueror and Azure School are definitely the biggest losers this time.” A big shot commented.

This ambush was a way for Illumination Conqueror to re-establish his reputation and dominance. Heavenslay Formation was meant to kill Ye Fantian and anyone who came to interfere.

They didn’t expect the heavenly tribulation to disturb their plan. In the end, Illumination tried and still couldn’t capture Ye Fantian. Thus, nothing was gained from this ill-fated endeavor. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Dao Alliance also suffered considerable losses. Nonetheless, they managed to capture Ye Fantian - fulfilling the main goal.

As for Divine Alliance, it was hard to know whether this was worth it. They managed to kill many top cultivators but their jewel was captured.

“This is a new era now, Illumination Conqueror is no longer the same as in the past.” An aged cultivator sighed and said, recalling Illumination’s previous dominance.

The People had an unprecedented solidarity under his leadership, allowing Dao Alliance to overwhelm the other alliances.

Now, it became apparent how difficult it would be for him to rise again. Azure School had suffered serious setbacks and Illumination was obviously impatient - a stark contrast to All-things who managed to stay calm during crises.

“What a time we live in, the pact is repeatedly weakened because of Supreme.” A conqueror lamented: “Now, we have Illumination trying to cause trouble again. The longlasting peace will be shattered soon enough and war will break out between the two sides. Who among us will survive?”

Supreme’s ambition was to dominate The People. Alas, most were happy with the Pact of Blessed including Principle Conqueror and All-things Dao Lord. Instigating the issue meant risking derision from both sides.

However, Principle’s abdication broke the balance. Although Swordsea didn’t actually care about the conflict, he didn’t actively try to stop it like his predecessor. Now, the return of Illumination Conqueror only served to hasten Supreme’s goal.

Illumination was belligerent and didn’t hide his hatred for The Race. This meant that Heaven and Divine Alliance had to react properly and band together. This was a solid reason to abandon the Pact of Blessed.
