Chapter 5771: Azure Omniplate

The two sides collided and released destructive shockwaves. The apex cultivators held back no longer.

Light-dragon’s radiance engulfed the battlefield, taking the form of heavenly dragons. Heaven Burial’s divine rings crushed everything in the vicinity. Demon’s aura of nature empowered her spear, pushing both Light-dragon and Heaven Burial back.

Battle cries echoed as heavenly swords, imperial flames, and divine pagodas ravaged the air... Massive figures could be seen on the battlefield, capable of devouring the stars.

“Empowerment!” Light-dragon’s group felt immense pressure from the opponents’ high morale, rendering holding the lines rather difficult. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The Celestial Palace answered the call and improved the blessings, causing them to grow one step stronger. The armies turned into a celestial flood or a raging dragon, successfully pushing back the enemies.

“Sing our ode!” Immortal Emperor Chi Ye shouted before channeling his vitality to spread primordial rays.

“At the world’s dawn, heaven and earth unfurled, five elements in a cosmic twirl...” Demon and the others also released primordial rays.

Soldiers chanted the same thing and these dao words empowered them, granting them enough strength to stop the celestial flood.

“Rumble!” Fortunately, this didn’t occur in the six continents, or the destruction would have been incalculable.

Celestial Court initially had the upper hand due to a boost in offense and defense from the core palace. However, the ode of war created a supreme chapter, infusing The People with primordial power.

The apex cultivators from The People gained this ability during their trip on the celestial river. They harmonized their grand dao with the primordial ship and researched the mysteries that Li Qiye had left behind.

Thus, after leaving the ship, they could harness this power and create a dao chapter to contest the heavenly treasure.

“At the world’s dawn, immortals sing songs...” The ode continued and The People regained the upper hand.

Celestial Court’s members didn’t expect such a strong display of might from the invaders. This unprecedented method caught them off guard.

“Clank!” A sword ocean wielding the power of a primal beast world descended, temporarily stopping the advance of the momentous ode. This allowed Celestial Court’s emperors to relax and breathe for a second.

A swordsman stood in front of Light-dragon, facing the brunt of the ode. The sword on his back released the roars of true dragons and other bestial creatures.

He was none other than Immortal Emperor Hao Hai - a wielder of a paragon artifact.

“Amazing.” He couldn’t help but praise the dao ode.

“Again!” Demon ordered and the song echoed again, surging alongside their battle spirit.

“It is an honor to face a primordial chapter.” Hao Hai had a serious expression.

“Brother Hao Hai, I’ve been waiting. Your opponent is me today.” Immortal Emperor Ren Xian who had been waiting on the sideline entered the battlefield.

“Brother Ren Xian.” Hao Hai greeted.

“Shall we?” Ren Xian initiated a sword domain to trap Hao Hai inside, creating a battlefield for just the two of them.

“I have nothing but admiration for your sword dao.” Hao Hai said while witnessing the hallowed domain: “Unfortunately, you cannot stop me, Brother.”

He untied the sword on his back and held it. Roars became louder as if divine beasts wanted to be set free.

“Celestial Court’s resources are impressive.” Ren Xian said.

“Divine Beast. Although it is not at grand completion, its epoch power can crush you.” Hao Hai said.

“I’ve heard of it from Sacred Teacher before.” Ren Xian said solemnly: “Created during Divine Beast Epoch and went missing after Voracious Leviathan devoured everything.”

“The teacher’s knowledge is second to none.” Hao Hai said: “I was fortunate enough to be entrusted with it by a senior.”

“Your ability to wield it shows just how far your dao has come. My power alone cannot stop it but fortunately, a senior also entrusted me with a treasure.”

“What treasure?” Hao Hai became curious - what could be competitive against his paragon artifact?

“Boom!” A blue chaotic expanse appeared, seemingly opening a new world. Blue light engulfed Ren Xian, granting him protection.

“Purewood Divine Emperor’s Azure Omniplate! One of the five immortal armaments!” Hao Hai was surprised to see this. [1]
