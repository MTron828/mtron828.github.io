“Welcome to Ancestral City, Young Master.” The great army of the city bowed towards him, resulting in a magnificent scene akin to the coming of a king.

Anyone would feel as if they were basking in a historical event as their ambition for power increased. Who wouldn’t want to have an army kneel before them? They would feel invincible during this event.

The spectators couldn’t believe this either. It was a rare scene to see an army of a million kneeling down to one man.

“What is Ancestral doing?” Some didn’t understand.

No one in the north could enjoy this welcoming ceremony, not even the forefathers of the important sects.

This grand ceremony exceeded all others, perhaps the highest showing of respect possible.

“This Li Qiye deserves this treatment?” People became jealous, especially the younger cultivators.

“How can he be so lucky? Loved by women everywhere he goes, the heaven is really blind.” One of them indignantly complained. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

First was the maiden, now the saintess. The latter was a more serious case since she tore apart her marriage agreement with Bai Jianchan and made an army bow to him. This whole thing felt surreal and unimaginable.

“Why does the saintess want to plead her loyalty? He can’t be that strong.” Another said bitterly.

“Can’t be stronger than Young Lord Bai for sure, hmph.” Another peer snorted.

They attributed his success to luck while glaring at him with eyes brimming with jealousy.

“Gotta do as the golems do, I suppose.” Li Qiye casually shrugged and accepted the ceremony. [1]

Shi Qingjian helped him up a carriage while the army roared loud enough to cause an echo across the land.

Thus, Li Qiye was escorted into the city by the saintess and the great golem army.

Many spectators saw this along the way and smacked their lips. One said: “I don’t think even a golem forefather enjoys this level of treatment.”

Those who wanted to capture Li Qiye gave up right away because he was as safe as can be. They didn’t want to die so early.

Li Qiye didn’t go around the city for sightseeing, choosing a place to stay right away instead.

The city prepared the best possible room and accommodations for him. Of course, he didn’t really care either way.

He told everyone to leave and sealed the area. His time was better spent focusing on figuring the background of this item.

Shi Qingjian’s group didn’t know why he wanted to go into isolation first thing. Nonetheless, they didn’t let anyone bother him. They also commanded their best disciples to guard his location.

Meanwhile, the city was busy talking about this matter with a focus on Shi Qingjian’s decision.

“Did you hear? A Silver Caparace cultivator won the favor of both Dragon-phoenix Maiden and Pearlstone Saintess. How?” A jealous youth said.

“Leaving his cultivation aside, he still has his incredible phoenix bloodline so he’ll definitely be desirable.” An older cultivator knew how precious this bloodline was.

“He is indeed special because of this bloodline.” An ancestor who didn’t like Li Qiye still admitted: “Why did Ancestral City agree to the marriage pact? It’s for the sake of a better bloodline. Two excellent bloodlines together will give birth to amazing offsprings. Among these bloodlines, draconic and phoenix bloodlines are definitely priceless.”

“Well, isn’t his bloodline extremely thin?” A few youths still wanted to put down Li Qiye.

“A thin bloodline can still pass down to his descendant. If it’s pure enough, the chance is quite high.” A logical ancestor explained: “However, judging by his fire control back in the domain, his bloodline can’t be that thin. It should be thick and pure since he was able to reach the last area of Fire Domain. How can it be impure in the slightest?”

“A pure phoenix bloodline... insanity.” A high elder added: “It should be more valuable than Young Lord Bai’s dual inborn talents then. It’s way rarer, maybe once in a million years if we’re lucky.”

“Don’t compare that Li guy to Young Lord Bai who will become a dao lord eventually.” A supporter of Bai Jianchan retorted. This group thought that it was ridiculous bringing the two up in the same sentence.

“It makes sense for the saintess to nullify the pact.” A clan elder had great insight unlike the young ones blinded by jealousy: “She didn’t agree to it in the first place so her action is understandable after taking over. Plus, what was the point of the engagement? Wasn’t it for a greater bloodline? So now, if they can recruit Li Qiye, the supporters of the previous engagement will more than welcome it.”

“It’s not just the bloodline.” A big shot smiled and shook his head: “Don’t forget, Li Qiye obtained the imperial treasury and the legacies of the phoenix as well. He’s a walking treasury right now, as rich as can be. No other sect or power in the north can match him.”

“That’s true.” The old foxes agreed. One of them said: “She’ll get more in the future by marrying Li Qiye, this is a win-win scenario. Li Qiye requires Ancestral’s protection while they require his wealth. Seems like Ancestral will take charge in the north in the next generation, maybe all of West King.”

Many big shots nodded in agreement. What Li Qiye had would truly boost Ancestral to an unprecedented height. If they were to choose, they would choose Li Qiye as well. The engagement with Yin Yang Gate was no longer necessary.

In reality, these speculators lacked information from the start. Ancestral did break up with Yin Yang because of Li Qiye. However, it had nothing to do with the non-existent bloodline or his treasures.

Ancestral’s choice was far more serious - an existential one. They needed to make it clear that they had nothing to do with Yin Yang. Otherwise, they might get dragged down into the mud.

This could lead to the destruction of their city or worse, the extinction of their race. That’s why some forefathers woke up and gave authority to Shi Qingjian.

“Are you saying that the saintess will marry Li Qiye? He doesn’t deserve her!” The geniuses became furious upon hearing this.
