Chapter 5738: Lightblade

Demon took a step back; her expression changed upon seeing the sacred armor of light.

“Fellow Daoist, your martial arts are truly extraordinary, one punch creating myriad beasts. This is the dao of the divine beasts.” Light-dragon expressed his admiration.

However, he shook his head and said: “But if this is all you have, Fellow Daoist, you cannot break my armor and are at a disadvantage.”

“A formidable armor set indeed.” Demon admitted.

“Yes, it was refined from a light star found in the farthest reach in Celestial Court by the Ancestors themselves. I wonder how many weapons can actually break it.” Light-dragon revealed the origin of the armor.

Only a few beings were called “Ancestors” in Celestial Court. They crafted this armor with the standards of a paragon artifact. This was a testament to Light-dragon’s status in Celestial Court.

The late Supreme had an actual paragon artifact - True Bones. Being sent down to the upper continents didn’t accurately reflect his noble status as a direct disciple of Celestial Court but rather, the importance of the mission.

Of course, this didn’t mean Light-dragon was valued less highly compared to Supreme.

“Formidable, not unbreakable.” Demon added and slowly drew out a spear.

It had a green glow with all-piercing rays. Her entire being suddenly changed upon wielding this weapon.

Her nature aura was gentle but now, it became chilling and murderous after the fusion. Putting its imposing presence aside, the laws and orders of the world somehow changed afterward. It could pierce through the world and replace it with an entirely new one.

Light-dragon stood up and gazed at the weapon with a serious expression.

“Fellow Daoist, does it have a name?” He asked.

“Demon Nightspear.” When she uttered its name, everyone could hear a whoosh and saw it piercing Light-dragon’s throat.

“I see.” Light-dragon took a deep breath, capable of recognizing its power.

“Can this break your armor?” The spear in her hand exuded an unbearable chill.

“Perhaps.” Light-dragon admitted.

“Let us test it then.” Demon pointed the spear at him, causing him to feel a sharp sting on his throat despite his mighty cultivation.

“Clank!” He summoned a saber that seemed to be made from light itself.

“My Lightblade has not been unsheathed for a long time, you leave me no choice today, Fellow Daoist.” He gently caressed the blade.

This was his true fate weapon, created from his supreme dao fruit and gestated by his anima power. The rest of the blade’s material was immensely precious - a lightstone gathered by the Ancestors of Celestial Court and divine metals imbued with light.

The formation of the blade required many eras of effort from Light-dragon. However, he didn’t have much use for it since he spent the majority of his time in Celestial Court after finishing his dao.

He rarely needed it to defeat powerful foes, especially not after possessing the light armor. Nonetheless, he knew that he had to be prudent against this spear.

Other weapons in his arsenal were useless, only his Lightblade stood a chance.

“Fellow Daoist, please give me pointers.” He gestured with his blade.

He didn’t enter a defensive stance or activate barriers, believing that offense was the best defense.

“Let’s do this.” Demon’s eyes lit up and her chilling aura intensified with rays capable of piercing the heart.

“Perpetual Night!” She performed a spear thrust and summoned a domain of darkness. One couldn’t see their hand in front of them.

“Illumination!” Light-dragon and the dragon behind him cautiously channeled more power.

“Rumble!” Loud detonations occurred as his light tried to overwhelm the dark domain, inch by inch.

He didn’t have time to spread his light before having to deal with an incoming thrust. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

All he saw was a gleam amidst the night and he became paralyzed, unable to move for a split second. Dodging was not an option so he swung his blade instead, cutting through the night domain and allowing light to penetrate.

As long as there was a single strand left, the light was eternal and could always spread even in this darkest domain.
