Solar Daoist has returned and became the only Everlasting in Imperial Lineage, successfully taking back the title of number one without any trouble.

“An Everlasting...” People understandably shivered at his sight while looking up at him. A character of his level was worthy of this.

“A being capable of hurting a progenitor.” The crowd’s expression changed.

This was the ultimate realm of all True Gods, their lifelong pursuit. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Plenty of Eternals could rival True Emperors but once the latter becomes a progenitor, this was no longer the case. No True Gods could ever dream about fighting evenly against a progenitor. The gap was immense.

Only an Everlasting would be able to match a progenitor, at least enough to be qualified for a dao discussion with one. All in all, before becoming an Everlasting, even the most amazing Eternal would always be under the shadow of a progenitor.

They needed to reach the next level before being able to get out of this shadow and catch up. A whole new world would open up as a result.

Solar Daoist didn’t have a terrible and destructive aura. However, his transcending style still surprised the crowd.

He seemed to be the center of the world despite just casually standing there. People had no choice but to look at him with respect.

This was the effect of becoming an Everlasting. One didn’t need to show off their divinity or say imperious statements. They commanded respect and even worship just by simply existing.

“This is the number one expert right now.” The experts around were respectful just short of kneeling down.

“Unbeatable in our world?” One person murmured.

“That’s still up to debate.” An Eternal said.

A while ago, everyone would agree that Solar Daoist would be the strongest in Imperial Lineage. However, Fiercest was looming above everyone right now. He was a demon in their mind, leaving them breathless. All Eternals present have been won over by his abilities!

Thus, they remained skeptical about the notion of the daoist being the strongest.

“Yes, Fiercest is unfathomable. It’s still too early to say.” An ancestor nodded in agreement while giving a fair evaluation.

“But he just got blown away in one move. The daoist is clearly superior.” A spectator voiced his opinion.

The older masters glanced at each other. In their mind, that ambush from the daoist was rather despicable.

He had the upper hand right now and all the momentum, but these big shots didn’t consider it to be honorable. An Everlasting ambushing a junior? It would be a shameful victory if he were to win.

Of course, no one dared to say anything because he was too strong and could destroy their sect.

“So Solar Daoist is really working together with the Mu.” Someone else said.

People weren’t that surprised to see him here at the Mu. Some even expected this.

“The daoist can’t rest easily with Fiercest around, knowing that this guy will be a problem.” One Eternal quietly added.

The crowd agreed with him. The powerful and imperious Fiercest was infringing on the daoist’s claim of being number one in Imperial.

A mountain can’t have two tigers. Even if these two didn’t care about the meaningless status, they would eventually have conflicting interests later down the road. Moreover, Fiercest has killed Lu Weijun a while ago, so a fight between the two of them was inevitable.

At the same time, the Mu and Fiercest needed to finish their business. The daoist became the most suitable and necessary ally for the Mu.

On the other hand, the daoist also required the resources and ace cards of the Mu. This alliance made perfect sense.

Of course, people didn’t know that this alliance happened mainly because of Lucidity King’s scheming. The exact details remained unknown.

“That move just now...” An ancient Eternal focused on the suns rotating around the daoist.

Solar Daoist got his title from this particular move. These suns were his supreme treasures. This was the result of a combination between a secret art and various treasures. They have become a part of his grand dao.

The move has taken down numerous powerful enemies in the past, including many brilliant Eternals.

“The temporal lines...” Those who understand the essence of the technique became afraid.

The actual suns didn’t matter that much compared to the temporal lines. The actual offense coming from the suns didn’t have anything to do with speed and distance. It has exceeded these physical boundaries and used the temporal lines to directly attack the enemies in the blink of an eye.

In other words, everyone had their own timeline that always flow. The daoist was able to infiltrate people’s timeline and kill them.

So, his prey could run to the ends of the world and hide but they couldn’t get away from their own timeline in the form of these temporal lines. That’s why this severing move was so frightening and effective.

“There is always a higher peak, so don’t be arrogant.” Solar Daoist spoke while standing on the highest peak at the Mu.

He showed no emotion while speaking, seemingly freed from the impurities of the mortal coil. Nevertheless, each word of his struck everyone’s heart like a hammer, making it hard for them to breathe. It sounded quite convincing since he has just sent Li Qiye flying.

“You are unbeatable, Senior Daoist!” The disciples from the Mu became jubilated and cheered loudly. Their shouts could be heard anywhere.

“We’re saved.” Some started to hug each other and cry, viewing Solar Daoist as their savior.

Puresword True Emperor finally got the chance to breathe. He would have turned into a meat paste right now if the daoist had hesitated.

“The fun is beginning.” Lucidity King revealed a sinister grin.

Sun Lengying standing next to him didn’t say anything, aware of the Mu’s fate.
