Chapter 4476: The Dao Stone’s Whereabout

“Yes, it should be in their possession right now.” The clan master admitted.

The group didn’t know what to do. Purpose murmured: “Such an important item is in their hand…”

“The ancestral aunt brought it with her back then.” The clan master smoked his pipe again out of embarrassment.

His embarrassment stemmed from his animosity towards the three clans for keeping their crest. The latter feared the Lu losing the crest due to their decline.

Sure enough, they had lost another important item, the dao stone. Moreover, this thing didn’t belong to them either.

Unfortunately, descendants of the Lu couldn’t quite ask for the dao stone back since it was their ancestral aunt who brought it to the Yu. They lacked the power to do so as well.

Thus, if this became known, the three clans would have a reason to never give back the crest, hence the need for secrecy.

Ultimately, he still told the truth because the Lu alone wasn’t strong enough. However, the four clans working together might have a chance of demanding the stone back from the Yu.

If they couldn’t get it back, then the Lu would become sinners and the rift would be permanent.

“What should we do? Taking the stone back from those thieves will be difficult.” Wise thought that this was quite a predicament.

“I know quite a few of them.” Jian Ming shrugged and said: “The problem is that we have no proof, why would they admit that they even have it in the first place? We can’t do anything if they remain stubborn.”

“Evidence? I actually have some.” The Lu Clan Master said: “During the ancestral aunt’s marriage, they left behind a note about giving it back eventually.” He then left to fetch it.

“It’s too long ago, I’m afraid her generation is all dead. The descendants of the Yu won’t admit to it.” Purpose smiled wryly.

“It’s still better to give it a shot.” Wise wanted to keep trying.

The clan master returned with an old box. He presented it to them and said: “Here is the proof from back then. We didn’t lose it.”

No one wanted to accept the box and take responsibility for this. The box seemed like a hot potato right now. Thus, they stared at Li Qiye.

“Brat, you take it.” Li Qiye ordered and Jian Ming obeyed instantly.

“Now, we have to find them.” Purpose said: “Those thieves are always on the move like drifting clouds, it’s not easy to find them when Inner Ruins is so large.”

The Yu was a strange clan. Rumor has it that their forefather was a member of a secret realm. The descendants of this person eventually stuck around in Inner Ruins, notorious for being bandits and thieves.

According to another legend, their original clan was ancient and powerful with ample resources. It was under the protection of a supreme existence. Moreover, the clan wasn’t located in Eight Desolaces either.

A few rotten eggs stole things from the clan and were eventually banished by their forefather. Thus, they had no choice but to stay in Eight Desolaces and form a new clan. Of course, their bad habits remained, inciting the hatred of other sects.

Nonetheless, their crimes weren’t overly wicked and brutal. After years of accumulation, they became rather powerful despite their nomadic nature.

“I actually know a few of their members. I think we should start with Golden City, we can find their clan there.” Jian Ming said.

“So be it.” Wise didn’t have a better plan.

The marriage of the Lu’s ancestral aunt was a hundred thousand years ago. The Yu’s descendants might deny it and not give back the dao stone.

Moreover, given their unsavory nature, they might even take advantage of this and bully the four clans.

“I’ll go with you.” Wise decided to tag along with Jian Ming since he worried that the youth alone didn’t have enough influence.

“Young Noble, please wait. We will find the dao stone and bring it back.” He requested.

“It’s boring to stay here, you two might not be able to get it back so I’ll go as well.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We will follow your lead then, Young Noble.” Wise agreed.

They had a quick discussion about the trip. Wise would get to go while Purpose would have to stay behind. The four clans required a powerful ancestor to stick around in case of unexpected enemies.

“Which way?” Wise asked Jian Ming.

The latter rubbed his nose and said: “The Yu might be somewhere in Golden City. I heard that they got a big catch not long ago and will want to unload the stolen goods there. I know enough people there to get more information.”

“So you hang around with these bandits?” Wise aid. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Ancestor, of course not. I always abide by the law, I’m a good kid.” Jian Ming smiled awkwardly.

Wise gave him the side-eye. If he was considered a good kid, then all the youths of the four clans would be considered angels.

The kid was famous for his trouble-making. He disappeared for a long time and everyone thought he was killed after antagonizing others. They searched extensively and eventually gave up. In the end, he came back without a scratch.

“Head for Golden City.” Li Qiye ordered.

Wise immediately prepared for the journey.

Inner Ruins was large with many inhabitants. Many cities were built along the outskirts. They served as entry points for adventurers wanting to enter Inner Ruins. Of course, they were few in numbers due to the potential danger.

The most prosperous location was none other than Golden City. One would think that the walls were made from gold. However, the name was metaphorical - implying that this was a city of opportunities.

Like many famous places in Inner Ruins, it also had an ancient history, rumored to be as old as Inner Ruins. There were indeed records of it being around during the Chaotic Era.

The architecture was indeed impressive and diverse, originating from Sword Continent, Sky Border, West King… A few weren’t traceable at all.

Among the halls, pagodas, and busy streets were different races from all over the world. This might be the most diverse area in all of Eight Desolaces. Moreover, they have been living in peace for so long - something rather miraculous.

In Golden City, one’s background and race didn’t matter. They were allowed to stay in Golden City as long as their pockets were full enough.
