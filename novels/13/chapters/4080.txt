Chapter 4081: The Price

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

A hundred thousand men or so were being tied up on the towers. This was an unforgettable spectacle for the crowd.

“This is really happening.” Someone commented.

Everyone observed from a distance instead of setting one foot in the plain. They didn’t want to share the same fate.

Hundred-blade Noble and the others gradually awakened. Confusion struck first then rage once they realized their current predicament.

They all came from famous clans yet they were being tied up naked right now before everyone. This was an unprecedented level of humiliation.

They struggled in order to break free. Alas, a seal restricted their vitality and energy so it was futile.

“Li, death before dishonor! Just kill me!” Hundred-blade roared furiously.

“No rush, no rush, you might want to die but I still need to make some money first.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Li Qiye, how dare you abduct and humiliate us! This is a crime deserving of nine-clan extermination!” Eight-armed Prince was livid and red.

This was his territory - the place where he enjoyed love and respect. Today, he no longer wanted to show his face to anyone.

“Armament Mountain will cut you to pieces and spare no one from your clan!” A few members of Armament roared as well.

“Keep going, I have plenty of time to stick around.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

They continued to yell while he relaxed on his chair, letting them go hoarse from screaming.

“Li, I dare you to fight me one-on-one!” Starshooter Prince eventually shouted.

Li Qiye shook his head: “A loser shouldn’t run his mouth pompously. Was the previous beating not enough? Must I break your arms and legs too?”

“You!!” Starshooter trembled with rage.

“What about me, Li Qiye? If I lose, you can do whatever, if I win, you must release them…” Hundred-blade interjected.

“Fish on the chopping board don’t get to negotiate.” Li Qiye interrupted: “Your sects can’t negotiate with me either. I will get what I want.”

“…” Hundred-blade was furious as well but the guy was indeed telling the truth.

“I will have my revenge one day…” He gritted his teeth.

Meanwhile, the mass continued to curse and scream at Li Qiye. Some started losing their voice.

Li Qiye didn’t pay it any mind and continued to relax. Eventually, the screaming stopped as they lost their strength and motivation.

Their energy and vitality have been sealed so they were no different than mortals. The sun was high and if this continued, they would be dead soon enough.

“What is he doing?” A spectator asked.

“Just humiliating them, maybe?” Someone responded.

“No, he wants to extort Sea Emperor and Armament.” An expert familiar with Li Qiye answered.

“What? Is he tired of living?” Another blurted out.

These two were behemoths, especially Sea Emperor - the number one sect in Sword Continent. Extorting them was awfully unwise.

“It’s true, he did something similar to Soaring Hawk Monarch back in Hallowed.” The expert was confident.

“The feud is already there, this doesn’t really matter.” An ancestor added.

Those who heard the story regarding Ning Zhu knew that there was no going back between Li Qiye and Sea Emperor.

“How long has it been since someone dared to challenge Sea Emperor?” An old cultivator said softly.

The big shots exchanged glances, thinking that the odds were against Li Qiye.

“Wealth and schemes don’t matter against Sea Emperor. Its resources and foundation are unfathomable, a new-rich like him has no chance.” One youth snorted.

The older experts refrained from commenting. If someone were to take down Sea Emperor, a fat piece of meat would suddenly become available for the taking. They actually wanted this to happen.

“Wow, so obedient now.” Li Qiye smiled after seeing the silence from the prisoners.

He then raised his finger and released two disciples, one from each sect.

“Bam! Bam!” They fell to the ground, confused.

He released their seal and said: “Go back and give them this message. If they want the hostages back, I’m not asking for much, only two-third of their treasury. They have five days before these guys are roasted.”

The two released disciples regained their wits and immediately ran away. It was impossible for them to save their allies. It was better to stay alive and just report to their seniors.

“Li, our Armament Mountain will never concede to your demand.” Eight-armed Prince coldly uttered.

“No big deal, I’ll just roast all of you then.” Li Qiye shrugged.

The prisoners trembled with rage but realized their helpless situation at this point.

“Two-third of their treasury? That’s pretty much two-third of their wealth.” A listener took a deep breath. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Maybe not that much but it’s still a ridiculous demand.” A big shot smiled wryly.
