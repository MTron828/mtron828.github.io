Chapter 5066: Brutal War Of Past

Its horn was also gorgeous with a purifying light. It came closer and nibbled Ming Shi’s sleeve.

“So cute.” She happily petted it.

“Is this a…” Tendril King recalled stories about this creature.

“Yes, a unicorn, albeit not the purest of this bloodline.” Li Qiye said.

Meanwhile, the unicorn nudged Ming Shi, seemingly wanting to take her somewhere.

“Her heart is pure.” Tendril King murmured - there was a reason why the unicorn was so close to Ming Shi. It didn’t approach Li Qiye or her, only the girl.

It led them deeper into the beautiful region with mesmerizing mountains and rivers. This tranquil paradise brimmed with the holy affinity. It could turn villains into upstanding cultivators.

The thing surprising them the most was the relatively high population of unicorns. Though they weren’t pureblooded, they could still be considered divine beasts in the outside world.

“How rare, esteemed visitors from afar.” A charismatic voice sounded, indicating that the speaker was a man of unparalleled grace.

Ming Shi and Tendril King looked over and saw a man sitting on top of a boulder. Due to his simple style, he resembled a shepherd for the unicorns.

He possessed a holy glow as well, purer than any light in existence. Despite his unadorned appearance, his smile was unforgettable and infectious.

He saw Li Qiye and rushed over to bow respectfully: “It’s you, Sir, I didn’t expect you to come so soon.”

The others exchanged glances - he seemed to know Li Qiye.

“Little serpent, you’re in charge of this place?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Haha, Sir, this is just a little accomplishment, not worth mentioning in your presence.” The youth hurriedly asked Li Qiye to sit down.

“Do you two know each other?” Ming Shi asked and couldn’t believe how a man’s smile could glitter so magnificently.

“When I first heard of you, Sir, I was but a tiny serpent. Now, I’m still just a tiny serpent in your eyes.” The youth said.

“The great Immortal Emperor Jin She, no need to be so humble.” Li Qiye smiled. [1]

“Immortal Emperor Jin She?” Ming Shi wasn’t familiar with this title.

“An ancient emperor.” Tendril King knew about this system from the past. This youth must be extremely old because this title was no longer used, replaced by dao lords and conquerors.

“You are Golden Serpent Emperor?” Ming Shi recalled a grand figure appearing when Wild Dragon was running away. Now that she looked at him carefully, the two were rather familiar.

“It’s all in the past.” The youth smiled and shook his head.

“The deity of Serpent!” Ming Shi became startled because he was the first founder god of Demon.

“That branch is nothing compared to his previous achievements as an Immortal Emperor.” Li Qiye commented.

“I don’t deserve such kind praises from you, Sir.” The youth bowed again.

He came from Heavenhoof Ravine and possessed a divine bloodline. Alas, this sect was no longer around at this point.

Li Qiye relaxed on another boulder and observed the roaming unicorns.

“I remember when you were a little snake that wanted to become a true dragon.” He said.

“Time waits for no one, seems like wasted effort.” The youth sighed.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Can the power here cleanse the traces of blood from you?” Li Qiye asked.

“I am at peace here and probably will not leave. Tending the nerd and enjoying the winds, this might be my permanent home. After all, this is the ancestral nest.” He said.

“The ancestral nest was not your pursuit yet you still returned.” Li Qiye commented.

During their conversation, Ming Shi had run off with some of the unicorns, being close enough to ride one of them.

“I have let you down, Sir. Weariness got the best of me so I ran here to live with these holy creatures. The mortal world no longer matters to me.”

“It is not your fault since the dao is full of obstacles and everyone has the right to pick. This is a great ending anyway.” Li Qiye nodded.

He sighed despite his current joyous situation: “I couldn’t be indomitable like you in any situation and regardless of the time.”

“I can only move forward.” Li Qiye said.

“I am no stranger to blood and death my whole life, it’s just that the last war made me want to quit and go far away.”

“It was brutal.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes.” The youth nodded: “Can Long and Ba Zhen fell, that was only the first battle too.”

“The immemorial epoch war.” Tendril King had heard of it before.

“Indeed, The People was utterly defeated and without the protection of the supreme power, they were doomed to be slaves forever or wiped out.”

Tendril King read about how the emperors and sages joined that war. She didn’t expect to meet a survivor today.

“I don’t need to return anyway.” The youth revealed a bitter smile.

Li Qiye patted his shoulder and said: “It’s amazing that you have tried your best. Look, you’re still alive, and isn’t this place great?” 

“Right, I just don’t understand why all living beings will devour each other eventually.” The youth sentimentally said.

“There will be an end.” Li Qiye responded.

“You’re talking about the final battle?” He asked.

Li Qiye smiled and stared at the horizon. After a brief silence, he said: “The final battle.”
