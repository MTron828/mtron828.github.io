Chapter 4442: As Long As Heaven Itself

Juniors weren’t in a rush to obtain immortality and lacked the same desire. Furthermore, they weren’t at the level of reaching it either.

But as for someone like Nine-tailed God or even stronger beings, their desire for immortality burned intensely. Top masters only cared about immortality.

At the apex, everything else was either within their grasp or no longer mattered to them. Alas, none has been able to reach immortality, not the dao lords or other brilliant cultivators.

If others were to know about Ravaged Land’s secret, they would definitely go crazy. The reclusive beings would come out of their slumber and lair.

There must have been a reason why the dao lords were so interested in this place despite not necessarily knowing the truth. They must have noticed some clues.

The demon believed Li Qiye without a doubt. He didn’t know why, only that this man in front of him far exceeded his current attainment.

“Is immortality possible?” He asked.

“Have you heard of anyone like that?” Li Qiye answered with a question instead.

Given his knowledge and experience, he has never thought of anyone before. The most legendary beings were the duck egg buyer, Puresun Dao Lord, and Blessed Dao Lord later on…

They were unparalleled but none had reached immortality. This question might not have an answer.

“Well..” He replied: “I don’t believe so.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s not that no one has done it, just not the true meaning of immortality.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So it’s impossible?” The demon didn’t want to give up.

Masters like him hoped that it would be possible to reach immortality via cultivation. They prayed that a path was possible, just not figured out yet.

“There are levels to this.” Li Qiye elaborated: “If living for longer than an epoch is the first, then there are several.”

His eyes then gazed towards the sky, piercing through the myriad dimensions into a deep region filled with darkness.

“What about the next level? True immortality?” The demon inquired.

“One will live as long as heaven itself.” Li Qiye casually revealed.

“As long as heaven itself? Just how many years…” The demon murmured.

“Impossible to calculate.” Li Qiye smiled and turned his sight upward in another direction. The end of the sky seemed to have the answer.

“I see. So is it reachable for regular people?” The demon asked about this eternal question for cultivators.

“From a cursory glance, there are two nearly at the final level.” Li Qiye looked back down at the demon.

“Two?” The demon became frozen. Being as old as heaven itself?

“How, how powerful are they?” He asked.

“If you want to measure their cultivation, then let’s just say that they can rush you like an ant. You will be as helpless as a speck of dust before their destructive power.” Li Qiye smiled.

“An ant or a speck of dust.” He felt his hands becoming sweaty.

If there were other listeners, they would immediately jump in to defend him. After all, the great demon was an invincible existence in the eyes of regular cultivators. There was no way someone else could take him down with such ease.

Alas, the demon knew that if Li Qiye was telling the truth, people who had lived that long would have reached an unimaginable level. They should have enough force to obliterate Eight Desolaces in one blow.

“It’s time to go.” Li Qiye changed the topic and gazed at Ravaged Land.

“I’ll be right behind you, Sir. Please lead the way.” He calmed down and bowed.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye stopped wasting time and jumped down.

He also did the same and jumped into the clouds.

The two of them didn’t perform merit laws to stop the free fall. They could hear winds howling in their ears due to the speed of the drop.

Alas, as they moved through the gales and layers of clouds, they found Ravaged Land to be a bottomless abyss. This freefall could last forever.

In the demon’s previous experiences, he knew that freefalling like this would not be enough to reach the bottom.

Some had experimented with this before to find the safest route. Just letting oneself go might be the answer.

Once landed, they would often find themselves not far from their original position. Doing this prevented death or disappearance.

The reason for this was due to Feng Qi and Jiu Bian’s destructive battle. Their attacks severed space and time, turning Ravaged Land into a bizarre and isolated dimension. Outsiders would be automatically pushed out by the land.

Therefore, simply jumping like the duo shouldn’t work. They would just be pushed back onto the cliff.

Many did this before and after landing, they thought that they had entered Ravaged Land. However, a while later, after a turn or another step, they would be teleported to the City of Demons.

“Walk forward!” After a while, Li Qiye suddenly shouted.

He took one step forward and his foot landed on a particular coordinate. This made him disappear from sight.

The demon didn’t think much and stepped in that exact spot, disappearing just like Li Qiye. This was possible due to his great speed so he hit the same coordinate.

“Boom!” Once he did it, he was greeted by a scorching heatwave.
