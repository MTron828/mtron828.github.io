Chapter 4231: Tenth’s Battle

The ninth slash was known as Skyless, what about the tenth? Many wanted to see it in person today.

After all, this slash rarely showed up in history. This was absolutely worth waiting for.

“Very well, Tenth. Take this!” Triune didn’t waste time and immediately swung his blade.

Murderous energy engulfed the air like a tsunami. The crowd felt their skin being pierced by thousands of needles and cried out in pain.

A red hue took over the sky since the sword god became radiant. People could smell a thick stench of blood and the laments of millions of beings. Perhaps this was the number of victims to the same attack in the past. They were trapped in his blade and could never reincarnate.

This first attack showed that Triune’s notoriety was well-deserved.

“How many people have been killed by him?” An expert said with fear.

People thought that he was indeed frightening just like the legends. No wonder why others would prefer to offend the other ancient ancestors instead of him.

“Perish!” Tenth calmly unleashed a horizontal slash, decapitating everything in its path.

“The seventh slash, godless!” Spectators roared after seeing this.

Tenth started with the seventh slash, a testament to how serious he was taking this fight.

Both of them were merciless killers and didn’t hold back in the slightest. Murderous energies engulfed the sky.

The world shook violently as waterfalls of energy shot everywhere. It was as if they were trying to destroy the realm.

“Again!” Triune slashed again, wanting to drown Tenth with overwhelming power. Space was being crushed into smithereens.

“Earthless!” Tenth roared; he seemed to be in high morale as he directly stopped the slash.

It became obvious that Tenth has grown strong enough to contend against the ancient ancestors.

Meanwhile, the other fights were reaching the climax as well.

“Boom!” Earthslope Ancestor and Poplar Paragon fought at the bottom of the sea. The water around them had evaporated.

On the other side, Lu Qi fought evenly against Sword God Jialun. A curtain of sword rays surrounded them and stopped anyone else from coming closer.

Terra Sword Saint and Steelfeather Sword God took it upward. They looked like immortals soaring in the air and unleashing their sword techniques - truly a beautiful scene.

As for Nine-sun Sword Saint and Golden Cymbals Ancestor, this was a contest of pure strength. The sword saint’s nine suns pushed upward against the suppressive cymbals.

Spectators had a hard time keeping up with the multiple battlegrounds and became dizzy.

It seemed that these fights wouldn’t end in a short time since the combatants were evenly matched.

In this crucial moment, Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra suddenly stood up.

“Boom!” Their auras swept through the nine firmaments and could crush everything like dried branches.

Numerous spectators fell to the ground, unable to get up. “The overlords are joining!” They shouted in horror.

In reality, they had only activated their auras and didn’t attack. Even the ancient ancestors and their opponents were affected, slowing down as a result. They leaped backward and quit fighting. The area quieted down right away.

“Fellow Daoist Li, there is no point in them fighting, you’re the one who wants the sword.” Vastsea Venerable said.

Sword God Jialun and his allies returned to their position. Terra Sword Saint and the others couldn’t give chase and stopped as well.

Most had a hard time breathing normally due to the pressure emanating from the two overlords. Some kept their head lowered, not daring to look straight at them.

“Seeing so many old friends should be a joyous moment. Unfortunately, it seems like we have to fight.” Earthraiser Vajra said.

“Seems so.” Li Qiye chuckled.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The crowd listened with full attention, thinking that Li Qiye was ready to challenge the two overlords alone.

“Our old bones can’t handle another fight, it would be best if we stop here.” Vastsea Venerable said.

“That’s fine, you all just need to leave.” Li Qiye replied.

The members of the two behemoths glared at Li Qiye. Backing down was too humiliating, akin to a stray dog without a master.

“You insist on being imperious, Fellow Daoist. I don’t think it’ll go as you wish.” Earthraiser Vajra replied.

“Some refuse to give up before seeing the coffin, this makes fighting inevitable.” Li Qiye retorted.

“You’re leaving us no choice.” Vastsea Venerable’s tone became serious.

Listeners thought that the fight was finally about to begin. Even the venerable was dropping his polite tone.

“Brother Vastsea, I’ll be your sparring partner instead.” A different person interjected.

An old man in gray appeared behind Li Qiye. He wore a round hat with a veil in front on top of using a stealth technique to hide his appearance, rendering heavenly gazes useless.
