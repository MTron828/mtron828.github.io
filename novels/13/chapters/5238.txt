“Seems like you got out just in time.” Li Qiye smiled.

Boss Tang paused for a moment before answering earnestly: “I often think about how I should have stayed, maybe I would have been able to do something. For example, pick up some corpses.”

“You have done well enough.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t know, maybe it’s just wishful thinking. Immortals don’t need me to collect their corpses.” He responded.

“You know they’re not immortals.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, because immortals cannot die. I recall during my childhood, they held me in their arms and lifted me up in the air in that wondrous realm.” His expression became dejected as he continued: “I didn’t understand why I was taken away then, never to see them again. This applies to my old man as well.”

He let out a sigh and continued: “Once I was older, I realized that we were abandoned.”

“Not quite.” Li Qiye said: “The chosen paths were different, thus the outcomes.”

“Perhaps. It just felt like I was living in an immortal realm then all of a sudden, I fell down to the mortal world and became an unwanted brat.” He said.

“Few knew about it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I did, I still recall how nobody wanted to even look at me when I was sent away, all averting their gazes.” His hands trembled as he said.

“One wrong step can lead to a lifetime of mistakes and unimaginable consequences.” Li Qiye said slowly.

“I don’t blame them, I just want to ask the old man why did he pick this path.” He said.

“When your dao heart isn’t strong enough, there will be a time when you are tempted into the darkness. It only takes one thought.” Li Qiye said.

“I have memories of him being unbeatable, preparing for expeditions and such. I still don’t understand why.” He smiled bitterly.

“You won’t be able to get an answer. You know when he was trapped there, he could have changed his mind. He didn’t.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I know.” He took a second before nodding: “I also knew that the old geezers were merciful. I did want to meet them, it’s just that I felt too ashamed.”

“The sins had nothing to do with you, you’re just a child who was born into this world.” Li Qiye consoled.

“The geezers said the same when I was taken away.” He sighed: “They gave many a lot too, that’s how I became wealthy enough to be a prodigal son.”

“You’re not though.” Li Qiye smiled: “You want to become strong in order to prove that you’re more than just his son.”

“I have thought about this before. It’s just that what am I going to prove? My talent and ability are far inferior. Plus, I fled at the first sight of danger, I am fully aware of my cowardice. Maybe he was afraid too, preferring to escape instead of facing our demons. That’s why he ended up succumbing.”

“I understand.” Li Qiye said.

“In the end, his bloodline courses through my veins, one branded as being tainted and traitorous. I don’t have the face to see anyone.” He lamented.

“Let’s get back to the issue, did you take the tree out of greed or did you want to preserve it to maintain a glimmer of hope?” Li Qiye stared at the tree and asked.

He cleared his throat before responding: “Well, what can I say, I’m a businessman who appreciates valuable merchandise. Plus, I needed something to ensure my survival while running here.”

“Is that so?” Li Qiye smirked.

“Fine, I might be an unambitious coward but I still have my moments.” He couldn’t handle the smirk from Li Qiye.

“And now, here you are looking for someone to repair it because you can’t.” Li Qiye said.

“No, I’m just a bit tight on funds recently so I’m trying to sell it, nothing more.” He denied.

Li Qiye chuckled and said: “You may not realize it but occasionally, you shine just as bright as your father. Do you know why?”

“Why?” He stopped messing around.

“Kindness.” Li Qiye said: “Knowing that you can’t yet you still try.”

He fell into silence.

“Your father was unbeatable so he feared nothing. He never stopped due to believing in his own strength, that’s why he chose the wrong path.” Li Qiye paused for a moment before asking: “Are you strong?”

“I am just an insect who shouldn’t be muttered in the same breath as him.” He accepted this reality.

“Yet here you are, standing before me with it. You knew that you could have died, that the chance of success was virtually nil.” Li Qiye raised the tree and said: “You still recklessly uprooted it and brought it here, fully aware of the unfavorable odds. Now that’s courage and kindness. Your father had a completely different mindset when he started his expedition.”

“Yes, emperors as followers, divine beasts leading the way.” He recalled an unforgettable scene from the distant past, once filling him with pride. Alas, the result afterward was nothing short of disastrous and horrifying.

“He never thought he would lose so once he did, his dao heart wavered completely. A case of a self-proclaimed savior turning into a devil. As for you during your lowest point, you only thought about doing what you can to contribute.” Li Qiye finished.

“Maybe.” He smiled wryly: “I never faulted the old geezers for abandoning me. It was what should have been done.”
