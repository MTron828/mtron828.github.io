Chapter 5176: Passerby

From what she heard so far of Li Qiye’s impeccable view of alchemy, she felt as if he was a better alchemist than her master.

Such thought seemed improper but she truly had this impression. His alchemy method was more refined and exquisite.

“I’m not.” He shook his head.

“Where are you from, Young Noble?” She couldn’t help but ask, thinking that he must be someone famous.

“Just a passerby.” He gave her the same answer as he would to anyone else.

The two traveled upstream until they saw a pond with green water.

“It should be here.” Shao Yao was still a direct disciple of an Alchemy Emperor and sensed the plant.

“Should we start sealing it now, Young Noble?” She asked.

“No need.” He smiled and waved his hand.

“Splash!” A whirlpool formed in the small pond and a lotus plant floated upward.

It was as white as snow. The petals looked illusory with emanating strands of light, resembling something from a dream. Green leaves were arranged neatly and brimmed with spirit energy.

It didn’t want to come out but alas, Li Qiye forced it to do so. He waved again and the flower left the plant to flow in his direction.

This was a sentient king medicine - a being created under perfect circumstances after countless years. It simply didn’t understand why its precious flower was being taken away. This helpless feeling was a new sensation.

The flower looked like a floating fairy; its movement resembled immaculate dancing. It landed on Li Qiye’s hand to Shao Yao’s astonishment.

That king medicine was immensely strong and would defend its flower at all costs. Capturing it required using clever methods such as bait medicines to catch it off guard.

All Li Qiye did was wave his hand and the flower automatically landed in his hand. Not even her master could replicate this feat.

“I-it’s this simple?” She murmured. That was no different from plucking a regular flower.

Li Qiye then handed her the flower.

Meanwhile, the lotus plant itself became frozen. It didn’t feel or sense anything before losing its precious essence accumulation in the form of the flower.

“A floating immortal lotus!” Suddenly, a youth accompanied by a group of cultivators appeared.

He wore an alchemist robe while engulfed in a fiery aura with a hint of medicinal fragrance. His body served as a cauldron, always ready to produce pills.

“Boom!” He formed a mudra and summoned fiery chains to wrap around the king medicine.

The latter was looking at Li Qiye in a daze and didn’t expect a third party to appear.

As it tried to flee, the youth roared: “Don’t even think about it!”

He tossed out a small banner and was able to seal the entire pond, the lotus plant included.

“Such superb skills, Pill Monarch!” The experts standing behind him cheered loudly.

He naturally enjoyed the praises and gloated: “That was my master’s secret art, second to none in this world.”

“Of course, Cauldron Emperor’s alchemy is peerless indeed.” The others were more than happy to play along.

The complacent youth then noticed the flower in the saintess’ hand. He bowed and said: “Saintess Shao Yao, long time no see.”

He ignored Li Qiye and assumed that the guy was just an ordinary disciple.

“Long time no see, Oddflame Pill Monarch.” She didn’t seem particularly pleased to see him.

The youth was a supreme genius in terms of alchemy. His master was Darkflame Cauldron Emperor - the most capable rival of Jadecure Conqueror.

The youth had done a commendable job in learning from his master.

“You’re here for the floating immortal lotus as well? Haha, I do want to see your incredible alchemy skills.” He laughed.

“No need for that.” She refused right away.

“Looks like we’re both lucky today, you got the essence flower while I get the plant.” He prepared to close the seal in order to take the plant.

“Release it.” Li Qiye ordered.

“What did you just say? Why should I?” The youth glared at Li Qiye.

“Because I say so.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hahaha, how bold.” The monarch laughed and asked the saintess: “Is he a member of Alchemy Dao?”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“No.” She responded flatly.

“Good, then brat, do you know who I am?” The monarch said imperiously.

“No, release it now.” Li Qiye said.

“You must be tired of living, to actually be making demands before me.” The monarch said. He was confident due to his influence as a top pill master.

“It’s best that you listen.” The saintess told him.

This surprised the monarch but he ended up laughing boisterously before declaring: “I am taking all the king medicines from Immortal’s Peak today. Those who stand in my way shall be eradicated.”
