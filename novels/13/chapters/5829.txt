Chapter 5829: I Summon Thee!

“The overlords seem rather unreliable, no?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile while despair struck his enemies.

Why would they bother protecting Celestial Court when its real masters turned a blind eye? Their strong ace cards were no more than plain paper; all of their efforts became nothing more than a joke.

Outsiders such as Immortal Emperor Fu Mo and Zhuo Huo weren’t heavily impacted. After all, they joined for certain benefits and privileges.

The same couldn’t be said for Light-dragon, Heaven Burial, and War Ancient God’s group. They viewed Celestial Court as their home and the overlords as their ancestors. Some were willing to die regardless of whether their ancestors showed up or otherwise.

Alas, they had the misfortune of surviving for too long to experience the harsh reality of being abandoned. Their sacrifice and courage were meaningless after the summoning refusal; their last spark of hope was extinguished.

“We can’t summon.” Profound’s group gave up.

“What now?” One of the three immortals’ conviction wavered.

The founder gritted his teeth and tossed a badge onto the dao platform ravaged by the maelstrom. It melted into a talisman and entered the maelstrom.

“Lord of Derivation, you owe me! This badge is your promise, and I summon thee with it!” The founder shouted.

“Boom!” The talisman then turned into an unbreakable mantra.

A beam shot upward and pierced the portal. Everyone shuddered, realizing that it was working.

In their cultivation realm, few things could hold them back. Alas, a spoken promise was a different story.

The overlords refused to be summoned and preferred to watch the downfall of Celestial Court, indifferent to anyone’s life or death. However, Lord of Derivation must fulfill his promise.

This phenomenon applied to those who have fallen into darkness as well. The consequence meant suffering a fatal dao backlash.

“Rumble!” Cracks appeared above them; the sky was being ripped apart by gigantic hands. It took a massive rift before the colossal figure could descend.

“Finally!” The crowd shouted.

As Lord of Derivation’s body attempted to squeeze through the crack, an ancient force surged outward and toppled three thousand worlds.

Emperors became suppressed and understood that this overlord was coming.

“We did it!” Profound’s group celebrated.

“Here at last.” The three immortals’ hope was rekindled.

“Time to end this.” Li Qiye had a wide smile as he added more force to his palm strike.

“Boom!” The figure of Trinity Ancestor fell to his primordial force and crumbled into pieces.

The founder and the immortals were sent flying, suffering grievous injuries. Their defeat was expected since Li Qiye was on a different level.

“Boom!” The descending overlord crushed the palaces of Celestial Court. The world had a hard time withstanding his presence.

“Lord of Derivation!” Members of Celestial Court kneeled.

“So this is Lord of Derivation?!” Demon’s group became alarmed.

Those who have heard of his tales would tremble after learning about his descent into their world. They finally got a good look at him, prompting them to gasp.

They once imagined the overlords to be incredible and majestic beings, the same way as mortals viewed emperors and conquerors.

The greatest in history should have a matching appearance. Although some had heard legends about this overlord, laying eyes on him finally made them understand the terror.

The sight was disgusting and nauseating - no better way to describe him. It sent shivers down their spines and made them want to vomit.

He resembled a continent of putrified flesh. Some parts were dried and tough, looking like tree roots with countless pores and cavities. The more grotesque parts looked to be corroded by unknown substances. Veins and muscles squirmed with blood oozing out.

How could this rotting mountain of flesh be their supreme overlord?Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
