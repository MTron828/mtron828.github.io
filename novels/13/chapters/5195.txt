Chapter 5196: Just A Little Bit

Meanwhile, the six grand elders tried to come up with a countermeasure. Alas, they had no good plan and didn’t dare to recklessly interfere.

Just one wrong move would kill their ancient ancestors and destroy Alchemy Dao. They felt like ants walking on a hot pan. Though some came up with a few methods, they weren’t viable.

“That’s a great cauldron.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but praise.

The saint child snorted and said proudly: “Of course, Purification Cauldron is our ancestral legacy, there is nothing else like it.”

Li Qiye chuckled and continued to watch the scene. He shook his head and said: “There’s not much time left.”

“The earth veins are adding more and more power.” One elder said: “If we can’t control the flames, they will explode.”

“We need to help our ancient ancestors right now and seal the flames before it’s too late.” The first elder suggested.

“That’s courting death.” Li Qiye shook his head: “No different from fanning the flames, the cauldron will explode for sure and take Alchemy Dao with it.”

“Hmph, spouting big words again.” The saint child uttered coldly: “Our elders are all experts and know the limit. You, an outsider, cannot understand the intricacies of our alchemy skill.”

“Empty buckets, that’s all.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“!” The saint child turned red while the six elders stared at Li Qiye with a frown.

“Who may you be? Your lack of civility is not appreciated.” The first elder said.

“Elder, the young noble surely has a method.” The saintess interjected.

Due to Li Qiye’s ordinary appearance, the elders didn’t trust him.

“Only a supreme alchemist with a concentration on pill-making can salvage this situation by controlling the flames.” The second elder said.

“The cauldron is finished if we don’t seal the flames. Only Her Majesty can do so.” The first elder had no confidence.

Unfortunately, Jadecure Conqueror was not in the sect currently and they couldn’t communicate with her.

“What are we waiting for? Let’s seal them.” The sixth elder became impatient.

“But the pills are about to take form.” The saint child said.

“Sealing the flames is all we can ask for, forget about the pills.” The first elder said.

“Lacking both refinement and understanding of alchemy.” Li Qiye said disapprovingly: “What have you learned from your predecessors? You cannot seal these flames of one hundred dao even if you try.”

“Do you understand the dao of fire control?” The first elder asked.

“A little bit.” Li Qiye responded.

“The young noble knows how to seal them, he’ll be able to save Junior and Senior Uncle.” Shao Yao immediately said.

“Sealing the cauldron is the worst method.” Li Qiye said: “The flames can still be controlled to finish the refinement process.”

“Impossible, the cauldron is lost, how can we even finish the refinement process?” The third elder disagreed.

“The fire sources are out of control, how long can you seal them? Moreover, given your power, do you believe that you can stop the earth veins formed by your progenitor?” Li Qiye said.

“He’s not wrong about that.” The group exchanged glances.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They might not be able to seal the veins despite working together. After all, they were created by Heavenly Sage Yuan.

“Ridiculous, the cauldron will explode soon if we don’t do something. What is your nefarious scheme in delaying us?!” The saint child shouted.

He then told the elders: “Elders, do not trust this outsider. If we don’t do something now, Master and Junior Uncle will perish!”

“Sir, these flames can still be controlled?” The first elder held on to a sliver of hope.

After all, they didn’t want to waste incredibly precious materials. The entire sect had worked to gather them for this cauldron.

Moreover, he also knew that they wouldn’t be able to seal the flames for long. This would only delay the inevitable.

“Not difficult. There are nine levels to the cauldron, situate them so that the flames would intertwine back to the cauldron for the refinement process.” Li Qiye said.

“Just like that? No way.” The elders stood there in a daze.

“It should be possible, the young noble certainly has a plan.” The saintess said.

“It is just too simple.” The sixth elder said.

“Hmm, using the natural flow from the earth veins through situating the layers perfectly, the one hundred dao flames will neutralize each other and will weaken as a result. This is gentle enough to refine the pills.” The first elder mused.

“If that’s the case, I’ll give it a shot.” The saint child heard this and was eager to contribute.

“Activate!” He roared and made a mudra, performing a fire-control art.

“Buzz.” Dao lights enveloped his hands as he began changing the rotating layers.

“Creak.” The layers changed the direction of the violent flames and sure enough, they started mixing with each other.

“It’s working!” The saint child was ecstatic and thought that he could control the flames.

“Poof!” Suddenly, the harmonizing flames roared like a true dragon and rushed outward.

“This is bad!” One elder shouted.

“Be careful!” The saintess bellowed but it was too late.

“Ahh!” The saint child didn’t have time to show off his flame-warding ability since he was instantly incinerated.

Li Qiye stared at the pile of ashes and shook his head: “Regular fire-control art doesn’t work here.”

The first elder didn’t have time to mourn. He watched the two trapped ancient ancestors and asked Li Qiye: “What is the method then?”

“Heavenly Flame Dao Controller.” Li Qiye said.

The six gasped and the first elder said: “This technique has been lost, it is only a legend now.”

“Foolish. Your progenitor clearly embedded this technique into your fire-control art. This is due to a lack of basic, wanting to excel quickly without truly understanding the mysteries of fire control. You have let her down.” Li Qiye glanced at them.

“How can this be?” The elders couldn’t believe it.

“Watch.” Li Qiye stepped forward and touched the great cauldron.

He formed a mudra to move the nine layers to just the right position for the fire eyes to align together.

The six elders could see that he was using the same fire-control art from their sect.

“Isn’t that our method?” The elders were astounded to see his accuracy.

“Yes.” One elder responded.

They also noted that although he was using a simple variation, the flames were completely under his control. Not even a single strand of flames was being misused.
