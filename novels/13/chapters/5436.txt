Chapter 5437: Beware Of Cornered Dogs

War had begun in the upper continents starting with the strongest cultivators.

Others outside of the battlefield trembled in fear. Sects and kingdoms recalled their disciples and tried to evacuate. There were no winners for regular cultivators.

They were as feeble as ants compared to the conquerors and dao lords. This was a matter of survival, not glory.

Alas, how many could stay safe under the wrath of the battles? Some thought about running back down to the lower continents or hiding in the illusory realms…

As for Li Qiye, he returned to the courtyard in Imperial Attendant City to take a look at the pond. It now radiated brightly but this didn’t disturb the old man from sleeping on his rocking chair, swaying back and forth.

The war between apex cultivators and even the destruction of the world didn’t matter or affect him in the slightest. The flow of time became restricted by the sway of his chair.

Li Qiye glanced at the flashing pond before sitting down next to the old man.

“Awakening soon, your plan is working.” The old man said without opening his eyes.

“And it is due to your good fortune, this saves me a lot of effort.” Li Qiye smiled.

“If you know this, scram and don’t let me see you again.” The old man responded.

“You don’t have to remind me, I’ll be leaving and you won’t be able to see me even if you want to.” Li Qiye nodded.

This earnest answer left the old man in silence.

“It’s goodbye then.” He remarked.

Their relationship was rather peculiar. Li Qiye had killed him and wouldn’t leave him to rest in peace. The hatred should be immense but this wasn’t the case.

He was dead and Li Qiye’s presence actually brought a little color to his dull death. Moreover, Li Qiye was the only person qualified to speak with him in this world. Silence would be his only friend after Li Qiye’s departure.

“Yes, you can finally rest in peace here now.” Li Qiye said.

“I will do whatever I want.” The old man protested.

“Death is a process as well, I wonder if you will be able to endure the incoming years.” Li Qiye smiled.

].

“What’s there to endure? I’m already dead.” The old man said.

“Not having someone to talk to.” Li Qiye said.

The old man paused for a moment before admitting: “True, it’s a shame I can’t kill you right now.”

“Yes, no chance.” Li Qiye said.

“Well, although I can’t do it, someone else might finish the job in the future.” The old man said.

“Perhaps.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and pondered his potential doom.

“Go and find out, it is indeed time to set off, others might be waiting for you.” The old man said.

“They’re getting impatient but I’m not in a hurry.” Li Qiye said.

“Cornered dogs are capable of jumping the wall on top of biting someone. I’m afraid this wall might not be high and sturdy enough.” The old man said.

“The matter of the wall is none of my concern. Someone else will take care of it.” Li Qiye glanced at the sky.

The old man stared at the sky as well before responding: “I’m afraid the wall can’t be fixed this time, war is coming.”

“A descent isn’t strange, not like it hasn’t happened before.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s different this time, the villainous heaven knows this too.” The old man disagreed.

“Mmm…” Li Qiye nodded and said: “All of this might be a pit waiting for someone to jump in. One misstep means being buried.”

“The one being buried is up to debate. We’ve all experienced this before.” The old man sneered.

“In my opinion, the villainous heaven is too merciful in this case.” Li Qiye said.

“Not merciful but apprehensive of certain things.” The old man said.

“This will be a large-scale one, a complete annihilation.” Li Qiye mused.

“Not easy to annihilate such a large pit that was deliberately excavated.” The old man said.

“Yes, so much sneaking around in the past, digging while avoiding the villainous heaven. But now, they’re doing it so openly.” Li Qiye said.

“A pit to bury the heaven, what a clever idea. It’s a pity that in the end, they’ll be buried themselves.” The old man laughed.

“Is that what happened to your group back then?” Li Qiye had a sly smile.

“Hah, your defeat up there was probably worse than ours.” The old man responded.

“True with regards to the circumstances.” Li Qiye nodded: “But I am different, still able to restrain my desires and maintain my dao heart.”

“Easier said than done, come back and say this again once you’re presented with an opportunity to devour the villainous heaven.” The old man said.

“I don’t have this intention nor do I need to.” Li Qiye stared at him and said earnestly: “This is why I’m different from you and him.”

“Hmm…” The old man pondered briefly before replying: “He would probably choose to devour.”

“Well, the inevitable is coming.” Li Qiye looked at the sky again and said softly.

“Have to seize the opportunity to strike when the foes are sickly.” The old man urged: “This is a good chance.”

“Haste makes waste.” Li Qiye smiled: “Plus, who will be sick then?”

“You’re just unsure whether you’ll be stabbed in the back or not.” The old man said.

“That’s one of my flaws, too trusting and sincere.” Li Qiye responded. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“If what you say is true, you would have responded. I see that you have no intention of doing so.” The old man asserted.

“Like I said, no rush.” Li Qiye repeated.

“It seems like I’m the one impatient when I’m not even in the match anymore. We’ll see who will be the first to lose their composure.” The old man said.

“That doesn’t matter too much, a full sweep is necessary.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

“It’ll come at a cost, it depends on how much you’re willing to let go.” The old man said.

“I’m just a passerby.” Li Qiye said sentimentally.

“A world without people means there are no passersby. You will be the master, not a visitor.” The man joked.
