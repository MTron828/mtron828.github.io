The spectators couldn’t help feeling respect for Heavenrend Viper since he could leave whenever he wanted but he chose to stay.

This was admirable, proving that he was a real man regardless of his morality.

Nothing was more precious than life for many people. They would be willing to abandon all else jut to survive. However, Heavenrend Viper was going to throw his life away just to keep a promise despite knowing the futility of it all.

Anyone who wanted to touch Mu Shaochen must walk over his corpse first. It seemed that keeping his promise was more important to him than his own life.

“Very well, I shall fulfill your wish and even give you a chance to attack first.” Li Qiye smiled.

Heavenrend Viper took a deep breath. He summoned his strongest weapon and looked back at Mu Shaochen: “Young Lord, I’ll be going first. Take care.”

“Elder Wang!” Shaochen was shocked but there was nothing he could do now.

“Let’s go!” Heavenrend Viper roared and his weapon exuded a golden light in the shape of a serpent with the intensity of a sun. At the same time, his vitality erupted with fire, serving as the fuel.

When this weapon attacked, space melted itself. The world was turning into a golden liquid.

Heavenrend Viper knew that this strongest attack in his entire life wouldn’t accomplish anything yet he still did it to struggle for just a little bit. At the very least, he tried his best to keep his promise.

This attack required burning his vitality and lifespan, doubling its power and more - truly a shocking blow.

In the past, when an Eternal released such a mighty move, people would audibly gasp and become lost in awe. They would feel that it was unstoppable.

This was no longer the case. Everyone stayed calm because they knew that regardless of its ferocious potential, it wouldn’t change the outcome. He was facing Fiercest who could decide everything with his own move.

In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye had a golden sword in his hand. It flashed at an unbelievable speed. No one could even see the sword at first, let alone the slash. They only saw a flashing golden brilliance, not where it came from.

Heavenrend Viper stood still as if nothing has happened. The world became silent just like the beginning of time as if the viper didn’t attack at all.

“Pluff!” His head rolled off his body and fell thumpingly to the ground. His eyes were still open to see his body falling to the ground.

Li Qiye’s speed was virtually imperceptible. Even the ancestors couldn’t truly see the move. His golden sword disappeared after the viper’s body fell to the ground.

Golden of the Finality Sword series; it represented the limits of speed. Just one slash was enough to deliver the fatal blow.

His opponents wouldn’t have the chance to attack at all when he chose this move since they would already be dead. Even an Eternal like the viper who was certainly strong became so helpless. Most wouldn’t even realize how they have died.

Of course, dying to this slash could also be considered lucky. At the very least, death came and left in the blink of an eye, painlessly and without any fear.

“Elder Wang!” Shaochen shouted again. Naturally, he wasn’t sad about the death of the old man, only that his only backing was gone. He was truly alone now.

“Your turn.” Li Qiye smiled while staring at the youth.

“Don’t, don’t come over here!” Shaochen was scared out of his mind and continued walking backward. He wanted nothing more than to get out of here but that wasn’t possible.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you right now. Your death will be at the Mu.” Li Qiye said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What, what are you trying to do?!” Shaochen wasn’t an idiot and knew that something bad was about to come so his legs grew weak.

“Don’t worry, I’m just merciful enough to let you die at your own home. It’ll be more comforting and gentle that way.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“That’s impossible since I can’t return to Imperial. There’s no way.” The youth replied.

If he could return to the Mu right now, he would have already done so. However, he alone couldn’t ascend to Imperial. He had other methods but his clan wouldn’t accept him back under ordinary circumstances.

“It’s not impossible.” Li Qiye smiled: “Your clan won’t just sit back and watch you die in Myriad so when you are on the verge of death, for example, when your true fate is burning, your ancestors will let you die here? I’m sure they have done something to your body in preparation for this.”

Shaochen finally knew what Li Qiye wanted to do so he screamed: “Don’t be crazy! Killing me will make your incoming days terrible! In Imperial, my elder brother is an invincible True Emperor, we’re the strongest clan as well, everyone obeys us! Kill me and you, you will have nowhere to go once you ascend...”

Shaochen was scared out of his wits because the most horrifying thing was about to happen to him.

“That’s just fine, a good chance for me to destroy your Mu Clan. Since you are returning, give them a message for me, will you? I will be ascending soon. If your clan is smart, then start being obedient. Otherwise, I shall destroy them.”

“You, you are declaring war against the Mu!” Shaochen trembled with fear as he shouted.

“Correct, this is a declaration of war. Don’t forget now, give them my message. I, Fiercest, am declaring war on the Mu.” Li Qiye revealed a gentle smile.

Everyone was shocked. In Myriad, the Mu was an impressive name, the strongest clan in Imperial and one of the three behemoths there. Not many other systems in Imperial could afford to mess with them.

But now, Fiercest had just declared war against them. Such a domineering showing.

Shaochen couldn’t say anything now since he was overwhelmed with fear. He knew death was very close.

“Time to go now.” Li Qiye chuckled and raised his finger.

“Pop!” A fiery spark fell on Mu Shaochen - tiny and weak, seemingly on the verge of extinguishing.
