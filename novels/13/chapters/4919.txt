Chapter 4920: Bai Shaojin’s Origin

“Your ancestor was talented when he shouldered four Heaven’s Wills. However, doubts over his dao hindered his potential.” Li Qiye suddenly remarked and stunned Bai Shaojin.

This shocked him even more than Li Qiye’s knowledge of the vessel. His legs became weak and he nearly dropped to the ground.

After a long while, he calmed down and stammered: “H-how do you know this?”

“I read.” Li Qiye smiled.

Of course, this wasn’t true. Such a thing didn’t exist in any historical record. Even members of their clan didn’t know about it.

He was an exception because the ancestors adored him. Whenever they had time, they would talk about their past during their time training.

Recently, the oldest ancestor stopped caring about mundane matters and didn’t meet outsiders. Therefore, others had no chance of knowing this.

“Benevolence is not for a heavener to hold, death is the punishment.” Li Qiye said: “However, out of consideration for your ancestor, I have spared you.”

Shaojin shuddered and felt like an ant in this split second. It seemed like Li Qiye was not lying with the “one finger” comment.

He was a knowledgeable person who had met big shots before. His oldest ancestor was one of them - a participant and survivor of the immemorial war. Emperors and monarchs faltered yet he was still alive.

He didn’t feel the same fear when seeing the ancestor. This was most likely due to the lack of animosity. However, could there be a gap between the ancestor and Li Qiye?

“T-thank you, Young Noble.” He became drenched in a cold sweat.

“Good.” Li Qiye smiled: “How is your ancestor doing?”

“The ancestor has not left the clan after his wife’s passing.” Shaojin respectfully said.

“Once gone, there can be no another.” Li Qiye sighed and said: “The calamity didn’t kill him but this delivers an everlasting injury.”

“Right, Young Noble.” Shaojin thought that Li Qiye had a good grasp on the ancestor’s current condition.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The ancestor was someone who didn’t fear heavenly tribulations or wars. Nothing hindered his step until the death of his wife. From then on, he no longer wanted to see visitors and chose to live reclusively.

The world no longer had anyone who truly understood him. The pain of the heart shut him off from the rest.

“When you see your ancestor later, tell him that Li Qiye gives his regard.” Li Qiye said.

“I will pass it on, Young Noble.” Shaojin bowed.

Yunyun could tell that Shaojin came from an ancient and famous clan. However, it also became clear that Li Qiye’s true identity was frightening.

“The vessel shouldn’t be in your possession but I shall make an exception. You may keep it.” Li Qiye said.

“Thank you, Young Noble.” Shaojin bowed again.

He spent immense efforts to obtain the vessel but the whole conversation made it sound as if Li Qiye was gifting it to him. Nonetheless, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to stop Li Qiye from taking it back.

“Where did you get it?” Li Qiye asked.

“A favorite pastime of mine during childhood was listening to the ancestor’s story about the immemorial war.” He responded.

“Your ancestor participated in the war?!” Yunyun was shocked because the war included legendary figures.

Shaojin nodded to her before continuing: “He mentioned something about Feather Immortal Monarch sealing Immemorial Palace’s resources into Benevolence. Alas, the monarch fell in battle and the vessel was lost on the battlefield. Its whereabouts became a mystery.”

“He sighed repeatedly whenever he talked about this war.” He went on: “Thus, the conversations always left a deep impression on me. Recently, I came to the place of this particular battle and I found something.”

“You excavated Benevolence.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Right, it took me a year of research before pinpointing the area of the battlefield which happened to be Immortal Pagoda’s territory. I snuck in and found the vessel.”

“So Deity’s missing treasure is this vessel.” Yunyun connected the dots.

Immortal Pagoda and Swordgrasp pursued the thief but didn’t know further details.

“In my opinion, Deity knew about it but couldn’t find it. When I excavated it, a phenomenon occurred and I ran right away.” He said.

“Why didn’t you run home right away?” Yunyun said.

“My clan is on the border, not as close as the academy.” Shaojin had an awkward smile.

“He doesn’t want to drag his clan into this matter.” Li Qiye answered: “You certainly heard of the academy’s might and stories from your ancestor, that’s why you’re here, wanting to rely on the academy to stop Deity.”

“... That is indeed my intention.” Shaojin admitted.

Given Deity’s capabilities, they would have traced and found him eventually. Bringing it back to the clan would result in a slaughter.

On the other hand, the academy had hidden dragons and crouching tigers.

“Every bite and every sip is preordained. Know where you stand and do not forget favors, this will help you succeed later on.” Li Qiye said.

“I truly appreciate your advice, Young Noble.” Shaojin bowed.

“You couldn’t open the vessel, thus you hoped to gather information from me.” Li Qiye accepted the gesture.

“Yes.” Shaojin responded.

Back at the gate, he came across Li Qiye who was able to tell that he had a treasure on him. That night, he tried everything but couldn’t open the vessel. He became curious about Li Qiye instead and wanted to test it out.

“Opening the vessel, not quite hard but not easy either. Merit laws and techniques are not of use here.” Li Qiye said.

“Then what is the actual method?” Shaojin became anxious.
