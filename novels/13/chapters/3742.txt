Chapter 3743: Xu Cuimei

“I have heard of you long ago, Fairy Dugu. You do live up to your reputation." Xu Cuimei went back then cupped her fist and told Dugu Lan.

“You’re too kind, Miss Xu.” Dugu Lan replied: “My knowledge regarding Righteous Sect is limited. I’m sorry but I’m not familiar with you.”

“Righteous has plenty of talents and disciples, I am only an ordinary disciple. It’s understandable.” Cuimei smiled back.

Cuimei remained calm despite facing thousands of top talents from the holy ground, including a genius like Dugu Lan. Her courage and composure were admirable. No wonder why she was chosen as the courier.

“On the other hand, I’ve heard of a few rumors about Righteous Scion.” Dugu Lan seemed amused while looking at Cuimei.

“Is that so? I’m sure there are plenty of rumors since the tallest tree has to block the strong winds. There has been no lack of positive and negative comments.”

“Right.” Dugu Lan nodded: “Trusting the nonsensical rumors will drag us down to their level, only adding unnecessary problems.”

“I’m glad we agree. It’s a shame that we couldn’t have met sooner, it is my pleasure.” Cuimei said.

“The pleasure’s mine.” Dugu Lan smiled.

The crowd listened attentively. These two seemed to be enjoying their conversation, virtually lacking any hostility.

One would mistake them for two friends or admirers of each other. It wouldn’t be surprising if this led to friendship, at least according to the current mood.

“Fairy Dugu is special.” A listener said: “Still elegant and friendly while facing this challenge. How many can do it like her?”

No one has mistreated or disrespected Xu Cuimei so far. Nonetheless, due to the nature of the challenge, they still had some prejudice or distaste towards her.

On the other hand, Dugu Lan didn’t express any of this.

“That’s why we call her fairy, flawless and freed from mortal imperfection.” One admirer couldn’t help praising.

“I am here to give you the letter in the scion’s stead.” Cuimei held a box with rays emanating from it.

People became serious right away and watched with bated breath. This was definitely a big event for both the holy ground and Righteous.

“The scion isn’t aiming at you specifically, he wishes to test himself against all the heroes in the holy ground.” Cuimei said.

“I understand.” Dugu Lan nodded: “We shall accept his challenge and face him when he comes.”

Cuimei finally opened the box. A letter slowly floated upward and pulsed radiantly just like a supreme treasure. The material was obviously precious.

From this, one could see that despite his arrogant tone, the scion didn’t actually look down on the holy ground. The effort spent on this letter alone was indicative of how much he cared.

The crowd started thinking as the letter was floating towards Dugu Lan. If it wasn’t for her, who here would dare to accept it? The one to do so would have to fight no matter what for the sake of their reputation.

Dugu Lan raised her hand, caught the letter then opened it.

The light became as bright as a rising sun. “Boom!” A power exploded and spread across the region. The waves were unbearable for some cultivators.

Many were caught off guard and got sent flying, unable to withstand the tsunami currents. They had to spin repeatedly in the air in order to regain stability. Some smashed onto the ground or got blown off the mountain. Chaos and disorder took over right away.

A haughty figure emerged in the light. Though it was faint, just one hand wave could suffocate others or render it impossible to stand straight.

“As I head eastward, I hope that the path won’t be empty. Who in the holy ground will be able to stop me?” The figure spoke sonorously.

Just one brief sentence struck the crowd hard. Some couldn’t handle the words echoing in their eras and succumbed to the overbearing pressure.

The figure then disappeared. The letter turned into golden particles that scatter away. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The scion’s words infuriated some of the young geniuses here. It felt as if he was looking down on the geniuses from the holy ground, already assuming superiority.

They regained their wits and stared at Dugu Lan. She remained cool and told Cuimei: “Miss, please tell the scion that I’ll be waiting to fight him right here.”

“It is expected for Fairy Dugu to guard Minor Sacred Mountain.” Cuimei smiled: “I hope that others will fight him along the way or it’ll be a boring journey. You surely can’t be the only combatant in the massive holy ground.”

The listeners found this frustrating. Cuimei made it sound that only Dugu Lan was worth the scion’s time. Some were young and easily offended.

One genius stepped up and said: “Righteous Scion’s strength is unquestionable but the holy ground has plenty of talents. If he dares to come, we’ll show him what we can do.”

Earlier, the two escorts behind Cuimei have remained silent. Thunderblade smiled and responded: “You sound quite confident.”

The members in Righteous adored the scion. Thunderblade was no exception.

“He’ll find out once he’s here.” Another genius from the holy ground added.

The young talents from both sides were arrogant and prideful. They certainly didn’t like each other.

“Well, I don’t see it. I hope that there won’t be too many turtles hiding in their shell on that day.” Thunderblade smirked.

“Watch your words!” A genius barked back.
