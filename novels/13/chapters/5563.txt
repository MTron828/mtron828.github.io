Chapter 5564: Tears

“Boom!” The supreme grand dao erupted and swept through the region. Dao laws and runes permeated the cities and villages once more.

Momentous Frontier’s inhabitants witnessed a tsunami of dao light. The waves started with the tablet and continued to resonate with every inch of the land, resulting in endless expansion.

All living beings and the most remote of regions were washed by the dao light. This was especially true for the truly devoted; the light on them was highly concentrated.

The statues within the shrines and temples resonated with the waves. Their light became brighter before becoming vertical beams illuminating a radius of ten thousand miles. Divinity returned and made them even more majestic and dignified.

The gray strands had nowhere to hide, being purified everywhere by the boundless dao light. This included the areas with a high concentration of the gray aura. The latter was still purified and reduced to nothingness.

The blessings of the deities returned to Momentous Frontier subsequently.

“The deities are back to protect their descendants! We are blessed once more!” Many were moved to tears.

The victims of the gray aura felt as if they were given a second chance at life and couldn’t help but prostrate and weep. Their faith grew after experiencing hardship and being saved.

Celebrations could be seen everywhere. Mortals gathered by the temples and shrines. Every location was packed to the brim. They brought offerings such as pig and ox before kneeling for an entire day.

The ones who came in and saw the divinity within the statue became speechless and overwhelmed. Some smashed their head onto the concrete a hundred times during the kowtow and still didn’t want to leave.

Due to the resurgence of faith and prayers, Momentous Dao grew stronger and brighter - further blessing the land.

The bright commotion alerted the rest of Dao Domain. Powerful cultivators became startled and contemplated the issue.

“Is this a new golden age for Momentous Frontier?” A dragon lord sensed divinity erupting from every inch of land. This was unprecedented.

“A different path of cultivation, how far is this path and how strong will they be?” An ancient emperor said sentimentally.

Many were aware of this path but didn’t wish to embark on it. They preferred freedom instead of being shackled to a particular location.

“A new path, one tied together with the mortals. Look at how successful they are now, their selflessness and benevolence are now rewarded, we can’t compare to them.” A dao lord commented.

Most had no strong feelings toward mortals, going as far as viewing them as ants. The condition of the mortal world meant nothing to them. Would a dragon soaring in the sky care about the ants crawling on the ground? No, because they lived in two different worlds.

Although outsiders would never wish to join this path, they still admired Immortal Emperor Di Yu and his group.

Li Qiye activated Momentous Dao to the limit, focusing its potential on all of Momentous Frontier. The deities were left speechless while gazing at the runes on the tablet.

They once believed that they had derived this dao to the limit. Now, they understood that their dao comprehension was rather lacking.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Of course, this was understandable since Li Qiye had personally refined and embedded his grand dao into this tablet previously. Momentous Dao was his original creation.

By this point, Momentous Dao had been spared from the gray aura. The remnant was back at the tablet and its only target was Li Qiye. The strands lunged for him like sharks smelling blood, still trapping him in a cocoon that was as tall as a peak.

They wanted to pierce through his primordial light and infect him. The countless strands writhed in a frenzy, making spectators shudder due to the creepy sight.
