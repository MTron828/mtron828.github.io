Chapter 4917: Luminous Conqueror

Li Qiye enjoyed the youth’s sense of propriety and didn’t push the issue.

“Where did you come back from, Miss Jian?” Goldcrest asked Yunyun with a hushed tone.

“Is there a problem?” She responded.

“Yes, a few people are trying to learn more about returning students, albeit in secrecy.” Goldcrest answered honestly.

“Did you get this information from Youngbright and the others?” Ming Shi asked.

“Sure, we’re keeping each other informed. This is why Deity is on the move.” Goldcrest responded.

“Hmph, Deity is too arrogant right now, don’t they know what place this is?” She complained: “Isn’t Celestial Court the best example?”

“It’s not their fault this time.” Goldcrest whispered: “From what I heard, they lost something extremely important, that’s why all of them are working together. It’s the reason why Swordgrasp and Immortal Pagoda are here.”

“I see.” Yunyun understood the situation.

It has been relatively peaceful between the two main factions, not to mention the academy’s prestige. Only something dire warranted this response from these two great powers.

“What does it have to do with the academy? Do they think the academy stole the item or whatever?” Ming Shi complained again.

Her disdain for Deity was due to her background - Untethered. It was the faction for The People and most importantly, it belonged to Dao Alliance in the upper continents.

If one were to talk about true animosity between two sects in the region, Untethered and Deity would be prime examples.

“I’m sure they are suspecting the students.” Goldcrest said: “Youngbright told me to don’t be emotional and rash this time, it seems like Deity is not messing around.”

“The students?” Ming Shi found this plausible since there were too many students here in the academy, especially Abroad.

On the other hand, how could Deity ever find the right person here?

“What item was it to warrant this response?” Yunyun became curious.

For a lineage like Deity, losing an imperial weapon was not enough for them to unite together and provoke the academy.

After all, Celestial Court had suffered grievous losses to the academy previously. It was widely believed that supreme masters were still here to protect it. Deity must be panicking due to the item’s value.

“I don’t know.” Goldcrest shook his head: “Youngbright and the others from Deity didn’t say anything. They did hint that it had something to do with the epoch war, so it’s rather ancient.”

“From the immemorial epoch war between the factions.” Yunyun became emotional.

“Hmph, do they think that academy will do nothing about this?” Ming Shi coldly said.

“It’s best to be careful. Students from Deity have been ordered by their seniors to spy on friends who have just gotten back.” Goldcrest said before glancing at Li Qiye: “And those with an unknown background.”

Ming Shi stared at him too and laughed: “Your background is unknown and you’re not a student. You’re definitely a prime suspect.”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She paused for a bit before whispering: “Did you steal the treasure? Let me know, I won’t tell anyone else.”

“Why would I need to steal any treasure? The best ones are already mine.” Li Qiye smiled.

Goldcrest stared at him again after hearing this domineering declaration. Such words should only come from peerless emperors or dao lords… Li Qiye didn’t look like one at all.

“Serious?” Ming Shi said: “You know Deity is untouchable in the lower continents, only someone like Luminous Conqueror can crush them.”

“Shh, careful now.” Goldcrest became startled and told her: “Friends from Deity would be annoyed to hear this.”

“So what, it’s no secret how Luminous Conqueror crushed all of Deity back then. We, The People, should take pride in it.” Ming Shi didn’t think that it was a big deal.

This caused Goldcrest to smile wryly. Nonetheless, it was indeed the truth. Luminous Conqueror reduced Deity to ashes. The current one was rebuilt by Divine and Heaven Alliance.

Luminous was incredibly gifted during his youth. Some even considered him the perfect being for cultivation.

At sixteen, he obtained his first fruit to become a dao lord. Alas, Deity feared his talent and potential. They worked together to obliterate him.

Since his grand dao had just finished, he couldn’t stop them from destroying his dao fruit and killing him.

Alas, the dao fruit was magical. As long as there was still one strand left, there was still a chance for rebirth.

After a thousand years, the fruit birthed him once more. Of course, he was only a mortal. Nonetheless, fate and heaven seemed to be on his side.

Since he had it at the start of his existence, this fruit became classified as an innate primordial one. When he reached maturity again, he became unstoppable and annihilated Deity Dao. It wasn’t until he was long gone that the two alliances would dare to rebuild Deity.

Meanwhile, Goldcrest suspected Li Qiye as well since he came out of nowhere.

“It has nothing to do with the young noble, I can guarantee this.” Yunyun immediately backed him up, not wanting him to be dragged into this mess. Due to her status, her words were taken seriously.
