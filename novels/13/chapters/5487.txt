Chapter 5488: It’s Nice Being A Mortal

“Young Master, that’s not fair since it’s not just me. Aside from those with unparalleled physiques or some perverts with strange habits, who would want to go to such a nauseating place?” Niu Fen protested.

“Will it kill you?” He smiled.

“No, it won’t cost me my life but that’s not the point, everyone else avoided him. It’s still too much after all these years after the fatal palm strike.” Niu Fen dropped his head and said.

“Fine, just wait for me outside.” Li Qiye patted again.

“Young Master, you do understand me, you’re the best.” Niu Fen said happily.

“Right, and you repay me by not even following a simple command.” Li Qiye complained.

“Young Master, I will not hesitate to run into a mountain of blades or an ocean of fire for you, I’ll be the first to kill anyone who dares to oppose you but to go to the place where Mu Zhuo died? That’s too difficult. Back then, everyone was fighting their heart out, enraged with bloodthirst but the moment he got there, they all ran out of the battlefield.” Niu Fen elaborated.

“Sounds about right.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s why it isn’t my fault.” Niu Fen said: “You don’t know how terrifying Mu Zhuo was back then. He stopped Celestial Court’s advances just by being present… well, I suppose he did contribute meritoriously and bought a lot of time for us to breathe. We might have been finished otherwise.”

“I hope he was happy, to do something for others and give meaning to his existence.” Li Qiye became sentimental.

“Haha, I wouldn’t wish for his existence. Hell, I preferred death in battle over being near him.” Niu Fen shook his head: “And I’m not the only one, that aura is unbearable.”

“Loathed by both life and death, he reached a limit of the dao with it.” Li Qiye said.

“No one dared to attack him either. One smash could have ended him but then, it was like slapping a pile of manure, except the stench would linger for eras.” Niu Fen shuddered.

“It’s a testament to his greatness. He didn’t care about the world and hated himself yet his dao heart was strong enough to stir him into action.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

“I would rather be beaten to death than to cultivate his dao. A fate of being repulsed by all with no escape in sight.” Niu Fen said.

“You wouldn’t be able to do it anyway.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Normally, cultivators cultivate the dao first and then their mind and heart. His dao required a particular mindset and mood as prerequisites.”

Mortals started this road by wanting to learn techniques and merit laws. Once they reached a certain level, they understood the importance of the dao heart. Powerful abilities alone didn’t take them far enough.

Only those with the right dao heart could reach greater heights, eventually striving for potential immortality.

“Seems like he was one step ahead of everyone then.” Niu Fen commented.

“Yes, so close to everlasting life since death didn’t want him.” Li Qiye said.

Lifespan was not infinite for cultivators. They used various methods of life prolongment - the most popular being sealing themselves to pause the flow of time.

Others utilized natural treasures and alchemy materials. Some cultivated secret techniques, hoping to improve their cultivation drastically for a longer lifespan. Another method included utilizing the momentum of special locations…

All in all, these methods were temporary measures and death remained inevitable.

Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo was special in that he didn’t utilize any of these methods. In fact, he didn’t even want to live, hoping for the sweet release of death. Unfortunately, this didn’t work.

He could have lived longer if it wasn’t for the palm strike ending him. He would have most likely outlasted anyone at the emperor level.

“Sigh, forget it, no point in living forever while being reviled by everything. Such a dao shouldn’t be cultivated.” Niu Fen commented.

“This dao is inevitable once the mind reaches that point. Of course, it’s rare for this to happen.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I suppose he is indeed worthy of admiration, to be able to do something so unique.” Niu Fen said.

“The hardships experienced in order to develop this mindset and the dao.” Li Qiye sighed and commented.

“It’s definitely better to stay as a mortal in this scenario.” Niu Fen said softly.

“Being a mortal was a far-fetched dream to him.” Li Qiye gazed into the horizon and said.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Niu Fen had no comment - a once-dominant Immortal Emperor ended up being hated by everyone.

Eras have passed and his repulsive aura still infected this land. Grass and flowers didn’t dare to grow here. If a rock could run, it would not be anywhere near this place.

Thus, a basin could be seen and nothing else within the battlefield. People had joked about the basin being the land running away from his corpse. In reality, it was most likely the aftermath of the palm strike.

His killer was not freed from consequences, being subjected to being repulsive for who knows how long?

The repulsion didn’t stem from a smell or any other senses. This was an invisible force keeping everyone away and instilling disgust in a mystical manner. This feeling came deep from the mind and couldn’t be controlled.
