Chapter 4580: Who Am I?

Who am I? These characters circled in her mind. A sense of familiarity yet confusion engulfed her memories.

She seemed to be recalling herself in the past along with familiar scenes. Unfortunate, this was a case of trying to catch the starry light. One could be fast and precise but they wouldn’t be able to catch the rays. They would always flow through the gaps and pass by.

Images appeared and popped like water bubbles, truly indecipherable. Someone called for her but she couldn’t answer. The name was at the tip of her tongue but there was a silver veil separating the two. Breaking through this veil and learning the name proved to be impossible.

Therefore, she actually thought that this was the separation between the previous life and the current - the memories of the past have been forgotten.

This left her mind in an empty state. She didn’t know who she was or where she came from.

“What is my name?” She blurted but then, she thought that this was ridiculous. If she didn’t know her own name, why would anyone here be privy to this information?

“Let’s call you Xiao Xuan.” Li Qiye answered right away.

“Xiao Xuan? Why Xiao Xuan?” She asked while furrowing her brows. [1]

In spite of her age, she always had an air of dignified divinity. When her expression changed, the resulting pressure was unbearable.

“Xiao Xuan is correct.” Li Qiye smiled, undeterred by her innate and crushing pressure.

For some reason, she instinctively took several steps backward even though he was only sitting there with a nonchalant expression.

He seemed to be a friendly person and no one should be on guard. However, she felt that when her aura touched his, it made her feel fear.

She was no different from a true god. At the very least, there existed an unimaginable power slumbering inside her.

Back in the primordial age, she would be a monstrous creature capable of devouring heaven and earth, capable of defeating the other primal beasts. Alas, there seemed to be something even more frightening hiding inside Li Qiye’s harmless appearance.

If she were a primal beast, then he would be the terror of the night. The beast could look around and see no end in sight. He was unfathomable and boundless, engulfing the entire world.

Therefore, the great beast was nothing more than a mayfly in comparison, not worth mentioning in the slightest.

“Who are you?” This prompted her next question.

“Li Qiye.” He repeated with a smile.

Each time he said these characters, she felt as if she had met him before in the “previous life”. The same feeling of dread might have been around as well.

As time passed, she regained her wits and let go of unnecessary thoughts.

“Xiao Xuan.” She said. Though this seemed to be a name he made up on the spot, it also gave her a familiar feeling. The moment he gave her this name, it became absolute regardless of her feeling. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“So be it.” She unconsciously believed that her name was Xiao Xuan.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t find this surprising.

“So many things familiar yet so far away, right in front of me yet I can’t grasp.” She then added.

“If you believe in reincarnation, you may consider it as memories of the previous life.” He added.

“Reincarnation?” The trio became surprised.

They thought about Yin Yang Crossing and the corpses that have entered the Yin Wheel. Was this an actual case of reincarnation right before them?

“So the reincarnation cycle is real?” Jian Ming murmured in disbelief.
