Chapter 4967: To Outer Space

Its destination was none other than the boundless radiance deeper into the academy.

“Wait, is the ceremony over?” One student watched the mountain fly away, confused.

“Obviously, the mountain isn’t even here anymore. Sigh, I didn’t get a damn thing.” Another lamented.

“No, at least we got to watch a nice show.” A third disagreed, thinking that witnessing the power of the dao controller was beneficial enough.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“But where is the mountain going? We couldn’t have tagged along?” Someone else asked.

“The end of the ceremony is the end, it’ll leave.” An experienced senior said.

“But Li Qiye just left with it.” His friend said.

“That just shows he’s lucky or the chosen one. It’s the reason why he got the dao controller and didn’t get kicked off.” A student from The People said.

No one disagreed with this after seeing the previous battle.

“Schoolmaster, where is it flying off to?” One student asked respectfully.

The old man followed the direction of the mountain, looking rather profound. He eventually looked back down and said: “Where it should be going.”

“What is up there?” Another asked. The light hanging above the sky of the academy seemed to be a strange phenomenon.

Everyone wanted to know more but no student in history has been able to travel there.

“It is for the fateful ones, they will get to see the truth.” The schoolmaster answered vaguely.

Listeners exchanged glances after hearing this and didn’t know what to say.

In reality, he didn’t know the answer either. His knowledge of the academy was second to none but some secrets still eluded him.

For example, the radiance deep in the academy was beyond his limit. He has never been there before and didn’t know what loomed within.

According to the historical scrolls, only Harmony Immortal Monarchs have been there. However, he knew that there was a supreme existence there - the one who sent the great palm down to kill the emperors of Celestial Court.

Nothing was known about this cultivator, not even the gender. He naturally wanted to meet this existence. Alas, he was unqualified despite having four sacred fruits.

“Such an amazing opportunity.” He murmured enviously.

Li Qiye had gotten the recognition of the dao controller and a chance to meet the supreme existence. This was unprecedented.

“Schoolmaster, may I repeat a year? I don’t want to graduate yet.” A student asked.

“It’s fine, the academy doesn’t force students to graduate. You can keep staying in Abroad.” The schoolmaster said.

“Me too!” Many others shouted.

Virtually everyone wanted to delay their graduation, whether it be students from Abroad or Hundred Halls.

“They just want to test their luck again for the dao controller.” Princess Ming Shi said after seeing this.

She was perfectly right. The majority of them wanted to wait for another ceremony with the divine mountain.

The power of the dao controller changed their perspective in life. They knew that this artifact alone was enough to make them famous, not needing to pursue anything else.

Moreover, Abroad had no restrictions either. As long as their skin was thick enough to linger around, they could stay here for a thousand years without being kicked out.

Some had done this before, treating Abroad as their home. They became the oldest students with no intention of graduating.

This homely atmosphere in Abroad helped solidify a strong foundation for the academy.

The divine mountain soared through the radiance like a shooting star, akin to a massive battleship splitting the ocean.

It entered a new world with countless planets and stars. Li Qiye lazily sat down and enjoyed the peace.

After a while, he glanced at Heaven Suppression Shawl and sighed: “Silly girl, it must have been tough. You even changed your title.”

This cloth was left behind by Nightmoon Conqueror - a being who had fought Celestial Court before.

Everyone knew about her tales but Li Qiye noticed something else the moment he touched the shawl.

She was already unbeatable a long time ago. Alas, she chose to change her dao and became Nightmoon Conqueror later.

“What the hell happened, old man? How did such a great clan go down?” Li Qiye asked the stars.

Certain events occurred outside of his expectation in the six continents.

“A debt must be repaid, and by me.” Li Qiye said softly: “I must depart soon, there’s not much time left.”

After a brief silence, he locked eyes with the sky and declared: "Villainous heaven, heed my words - my time is coming.”

The hidden currents never stopped following. Unknown changes occurred, unbeknown to even the dark overlords. Alas, there was no reversing this for even the strongest beings were as feeble as ants.

In spite of this, this was his epoch and his opportunity to embark on the journey for a proper answer.

“Boom!” The divine mountain leaped into another dimension again.

An ethereal world materialized with pavilions enshrouded in starlight, resembling the dwellings of immortals.
