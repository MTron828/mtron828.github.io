Chapter 3834: Black Tides’ Changes

The bright city’s excitement continued until midnight when silence began to rear its head. Darkness and dew took over the bustling streets.

The ocean outside was even calmer; only the crashing of the waves could be heard. Alas, something had changed in secrecy.

The sleeping Li Qiye suddenly sat up and moved over to the window, looking out at the ocean. His omniscient eyes saw things others couldn’t; his lips curled into a smile.

In reality, no one understood Black Tides more than him even though this was his first visit.

“Heightened vigilance, I see. Too bad it won’t change anything.” He murmured to himself.

No one paid attention to the ocean at night since it has always been the same for eras. This wasn’t the case tonight.

The problem was - even invincible characters had a hard time seeing the end of this ocean due to the black water.

The dao lords would see nothing but a dark expanse at the end of this ocean, unable to see five fingers in front of them.

That place seemed to be the source of darkness. All lights were absorbed there, unable to escape. Outside of the dao lords who made it to this place, no one else had a clue regarding the truth of this place.

Under the shroud of darkness tonight, a blood-red ray shot out from the depth of the ocean.

Of course, this area was extremely far from Black Wood Cliff. Mortals and cultivators didn’t notice at all.

The only exception was Li Qiye. After the first, more red rays came subsequently, slowly illuminating the ocean. They eventually spread to the surface and became visible to regular cultivators.

Some chose to stroll the coastline during the night and noticed this phenomenon. They paid it no mind at first until it became increasingly conspicuous, shining through the fog.

“Do you see that?” One spectator pointed at the ocean. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Others looked over and their astonishment grew proportionally with the red hue.

“Hmm, I’ve never heard of something like this happening before.” A local cultivator became startled.

Ever since they gained cognition, they found this ocean to always be black. This sudden change naturally surprised them.

As the red became thicker, a quiet buzz was heard clearly by everyone. The first wave of rays finally pierced through the clouds and painted the sky red.

There seemed to be a red sun rising from the ocean. Half of it could be seen now above the water.

“Do you see that?!” The spectators were horrified.

“Something’s off about Black Tides! We need to take a look now!” One expert shouted.

The juniors immediately left to wake their seniors up. The latter also did the same for their juniors. All in all, no one wanted to miss this spectacle.

A few big shots from the Biandu woke up as well.

Upon closer inspection, the sphere resembled a bloody round moon more than a sun, at least in terms of appearance. It’s because a moon wouldn’t have the scorching red rays. Thus, it should be considered a blood sun.

Eventually, the water looked like blood from the red illumination. This made it creepier than before.

The black back then was astonishing but not too frightening. This sanguine presence took it to the next level. People felt as if they could smell the stench of blood while looking at the thick liquid.

By this point, the entire group has woken up. Yang Ling and Fan Bai were afraid while the old man had a solemn expression.

“An ocean of blood?” Yang Ling gasped.

All three thought about Li Qiye’s comment before. People thought that there was a dark stone in this ocean, turning the water black. But, Li Qiye talked about the water being blood instead. His claim seemed rather accurate at this point.

“What the hell is happening?” The locals have never seen anything like this before.

“Yes, I never saw this during my 6,000 years.” An old cultivator murmured.

“Is this a sign of the water receding?” The big shots in the Biandu Clan became anxious.

Their clan has been next to Black Tides for eras and knew more about this place than most. Alas, this phenomenon still scared them.

“No, this isn’t a sign.” One old ancestor revealed: “I remember the previous tide recession, I was only ten then but it’s as clear as if it was just yesterday. This didn’t happen.”

“Yes, this isn’t in the records either.” A different ancestor agreed.

The other experts exchanged glances after hearing this.

“Then what is happening with Black Tides?” One of them took a deep breath. Even their clan couldn’t come up with an explanation.

As everyone was confused about the development, a loud blast came from the depth of the ocean. The floating sun instantly released a terrible power with a corrosive nature. Nothing could resist its might.

Fortunately, Black Wood was far enough from the end of the ocean to not be affected. Nonetheless, a tsunami took form, revealing the ocean’s seafloor. Numerous shadows started moving in the next second.

Due to the great distance, the powerful ancestors at the cliff couldn’t see them very well.

Alas, these shadows released frightening auras, akin to imprisoned devil kings in hell being released, ready to enter the mortal world.

“Rumble!” Their powers resulted in continuous detonations.
