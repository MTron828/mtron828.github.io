Chapter 4346: Peacock Monarch’s Power

The appearance of a top master shocked the lucky survivors.

His aura was too much for the smaller sects to take. In their eyes, the young lord was already untouchable enough. They resembled insects in his presence.

Now, the monarch was countless times stronger in comparison. This made the pressure intolerable and discomforting. His title was known across the land since he has been leading Dragon towards greatness.

“Is he coming?” A member of a small sect didn’t dare to look straight at him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Most of his peers lowered their head and couldn’t move at all.

An expert remained relatively composed and answered: “It is just an intent embedded in the young lord’s true fate. Whenever there’s a fatal danger, the intent would release a force strong enough to protect him.”

“Just one intent is already this strong? What about the monarch himself?” An elder from a small sect couldn’t believe it.

This avatar alone could sweep through all of their sects without an issue. This was as plain as day. Thus, the actual power of the monarch was immeasurable.

“Raa!” The monstrosity didn’t appreciate the resistance and started running forward.

“Rumble!” The world spun with each step and the land, ravaged.

It gathered enough momentum to leap up in the air, crushing the sky vault in the process and preparing for a downward smash with its claws clasped together.

“Bam!” The blow could pierce through the earth. Space shattered as a result.

Spectators gasped and shouted after seeing the sheer destruction.

“Buzz.” The five-colored light spewed out endless flames in retaliation. The flames traveled in harmony with all the lights in the world.

The image of the monarch then recalled this power into his palm and created a seal, slamming it onto the dark monstrosity without any mercy.

The five-colored seal contained numerous phoenixes. They had a unique color and seemed to be alive, possessing a matchless bloodline. Others wouldn’t dare to look straight at them since they resembled the mythical divine birds.

“Boom!” The seal pulverized everything as if it wanted to return the world to its original state, obliterating the monstrosity.

Alas, this dark creature didn’t have blood and flesh. Its body was made from black fog so though it was momentarily dispersed, it gathered once more.

“Good!” Nonetheless, the crowd still cheered.

“The monarch is truly unbeatable.” One elder from a small sect became emotional while kneeling.

“He lives up to his reputation.” The members of the great powers thought that the move earlier was unblockable.

Someone from the last generation who had met plenty of masters before added: “He’s the best in his generation. Just his intent alone is already so mighty.”

“Buzz.” More dark rays came out from the bottom of the lake. However, they immediately fused with the monstrosity instead of becoming their own entity.

Space had a difficult time accommodating the creature, on the verge of crumbling. This time, it didn’t grow larger but its form became increasingly physical. It looked like a black giant now instead of an amalgamation of fog. Power erupted with each breath.

“Perish!” The intent of the monarch unleashed the same fiery seal again.

Spectators were sent flying despite being far away. Some were suppressed and vomited blood from the pressure.

This time around, when they could see again, they noticed the monstrosity able to stop the five-colored seal with its muscular hand.

“!!!” They took a deep breath to calm down.

“Raa!” It retaliated by punching the seal and sending it back to the monarch.

“Boom!” The seal exploded and the young lord became a victim. He shot through the air like a rainbow while vomiting blood.

Keep in mind that this intent was special. The monarch only had one son so he pampered the child. It possessed his strongest blow whenever his son was in real danger.

The foe was just unreasonable this time. The punch damaged the intent and grievously injured the young lord.

“How is it growing stronger still?” The crowd didn’t like this development.

If the monarch were to fail, no one here would be able to stop the dark creature.
