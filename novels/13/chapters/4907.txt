Chapter 4908: Sent Flying

It was one thing to refuse a beggar but to go as far as taking money from his bowl? This was outrageously shameless.

However, the old beggar didn’t react to Li Qiye taking the coin as if he didn’t know.

“Lord Li, come on now.” He kept on presenting the bowl, raising it up and down.

Yunyun realized that the old man knew Li Qiye after hearing this. She thought about many things but didn’t understand what was going on.

“No.” Li Qiye refused coldly.

“It’s not easy to survive…” The old beggar insisted.

“There’s food and water in your bowl now.” Yunyun reminded.

“Just a little something.” The old beggar ignored her and came even closer to Li Qiye.

She fully understood at this point that the old man wasn’t here to beg. Or, his only focus was Li Qiye.

“Scram.” Li Qiye demanded.

If anyone else were here to see this, they would want to slap Li Qiye for being so cruel to this blind grandpa.

The old man complained to himself: “Lord Zhao gave me a full bowl, how generous of him. Lord Li, just give me a little bit.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Now, the bowl was in front of Li Qiye’s face.

“Go find your Lord Zhao then.” Li Qiye laughed and kicked the old beggar.

“Bam!” He was sent flying like a shooting star, eventually disappearing from sight.

“Ah!” Yunyun cried out, not expecting this development in the slightest.

“You… you kicked him…” She stammered while staring in that direction.

Li Qiye shrugged in response, not giving a damn. This left her speechless because everything was so bizarre.

First, why did a blind beggar appear in this remote wilderness? Moreover, he insisted on getting some food from Li Qiye.

“But why?” She asked again, criticizing him for being so brutal. No one knows if the old man was still alive or otherwise.

Li Qiye smiled and continued onward in the direction of the academy. She had no choice but to follow him.

As they were walking together, he tossed the coin at her and said: “Take it, a reward.”

“Huh…” She took a look and saw that it was an ordinary coin, not enough to buy a bun in the mortal world.

“You keep it.” She didn’t want it because it was taken from the bowl of a beggar. There was something sinful about this, taking something from the unfortunate souls.

“It’s good that you feel bad, it means that you are worthy. Keep it to your best ability, it might even change your life for the better, to say the least.” He said.

She became frozen again since the comment sounded serious. Was this coin that rare and valuable? She looked down again but didn’t notice anything special about it.

“Isn’t this just a bronze coin?” She asked.

He didn’t answer so she put it away and said: “Thank you, Young Noble.”

Intuition told her that Li Qiye wasn’t lying to her. There must be something special about the coin.

They only took a few steps before hearing the clatter of a horse’s hooves.

She turned back and saw a carriage pulled by a dark horse. The carriage was ordinary with a straw housing.

It came out of nowhere and stopped before Li Qiye, once again frustrating Yunyun. She became cautious right away.

“Little Bro, we meet again.” The driver spoke with a regional accent.

After seeing this woman, Yunyun didn’t know how to describe her. She appeared to be overweight but the fat was somehow solid and didn’t ripple with movement.

They seemed to be made from iron. Given her dark complexion, most would assume that she was a farmer exposed to the sun year-round.

In reality, she was only eighteen or nineteen years of age. Alas, her below-average appearance made her appear older.

Her hair was long and silky, styled in a simple bun that gave her a strong and assertive appearance. However, the heavy and overpowering makeup she wore in combination with her brightly embroidered dress came across as visually unappealing and likely caused others to disapprove.

Everyone would think that she was a small-town girl wanting to live a city life, hence the fashion choices.

When she stood near Yunyun, it made Yunyun look like a fairy.

“You want a ride?” She asked Li Qiye while putting on a coquettish pose and winking at him. This made Yunyun have goosebumps all over.

Yunyun glanced at Li Qiye, thinking about these two’s relationship. Were they friends or lovers?
