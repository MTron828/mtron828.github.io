“The princess always impresses with her moves. She’s really highly-valued by both Skylight and Yin Yang.” One spectator quietly said.

Just think about it, the first prince couldn’t bring a dao lord treasure here unlike her. He was the successor of the country yet it seemed that his status was actually inferior.

Firmaments Godchild became surprised as well. This didn’t bode well for his sect because it showed her determination.

The treasury could be considered in her pocket right now with the dao lord treasure. Plus, she was from Skylight and would be marrying into Yin Yang. Wu Zhongtian would fully support her.

It became an alliance between Skylight and Yin Yang. The one knocked out would be Firmaments along with the rest.

They didn’t need Firmaments at this point; that would just be one more mouth to share the pie with.

“I alone can’t accomplish much, I hope everyone will help so that we can cross the domain and share the treasure.” The princess stared at the crowd and said slowly. Her eyes especially focused on Wu Zhongtian and the godchild.

The big shots from the previous generation approved of her method. She had the best chance out of anyone because of her dao lord treasure.

However, she had no intent on monopolizing the treasury. Instead, she chose to win the support of Wu Zhongtian and the godchild. The moment they agreed, her status would be established to a certain extent.

“Looks like she’ll be queen in the future.” One ancestor commented with his peers: “That is if Young Lord Bai can become a dao lord.”

“Yes, Pearlstone Saintess probably can’t compete against her, at least not in terms of popularity.” A golem became worried.

Yin Yang was already the strongest sect in the north. Now, with these marriage alliances, it would become more monstrous. The other powers actually hoped for the failure of these engagements.

The two women, on paper, would have the same status. However, this would no longer be the case if Bai Jianchan were to become a dao lord. There would be a competition for the official queen status.

Everyone knew that Wu Zhongtian was Bai Jianchan’s right-hand man. He could become the first general in the future.

Thus, the princess was clearly currying favor with him. Zhongtian was here for the treasury and any success would increase his status in Yin Yang. Thus, he would keep her kindness in mind.

In the case of competition for the queen spot in the future, he would definitely pick the princess over the saintess.

That’s why the golem ancestors from various sects became worried after seeing this.

“Thank you, Your Highness. We will do all we can.” Wu Zhongtian smiled and bowed towards her. His attitude was different from the courtesy shown before, almost like a follower.

“I’ll keep your kindness to heart, Princess.” The godchild also bowed towards her.

“You’re too polite, gentlemen. Jianchan will be coming out soon, let us do our best to pave his path.” The princess spoke freely and impressively - the style of a future queen.

People thought that this was because she was groomed from an imperial household in the first place. Her style and method far exceeded regular cultivators.

Even the godchild wanted to be on her good side. He might be a good candidate for a general later on.

“Young Lord Bai is coming out soon?” The godchild, Zhou Tianhao, became surprised.

“Yes.” The princess nodded and said: “Baichan has reached the sacred level so he’s consolidating his cultivation at the moment. He’ll definitely come here afterward to meet the heroes of the world.”

The listeners took a deep breath. One of them said: “That’s so heaven-defying, to be at the sacred level at such a young age. Is he the youngest one currently?”

“He had entered the level long ago but just didn’t announce it.” An older expert said: “The future generation will surpass us. So many try for a lifetime and still wouldn’t be able to do it. This shows how promising his future is.”

The crowd started whispering about this matter. Some were shaken by this fact. The majority of ancestors here couldn’t get to this level. The ones that did obtain it during old age. Thus, this was indicative of Bai Jianchan’s brilliant future.

“Young Lord Bai has a chance to become a dao lord in this generation.” One golem expert said with admiration.

“Not just a chance, it won’t be none other than him.” An old expert disagreed: “He’ll definitely reign over the world then.”

People finally understood why both Ancestral City and Skylight chose to betroth their golden daughter to him.

“I’ll personally visit the young lord after he comes out.” The godchild happily said.

“He’ll definitely love a visit from a prodigy such as yourself. He had praised your dao avatar numerous times before.” She smiled and nodded, trying to recruit another talent.

The godchild naturally enjoyed the praise, especially when it came from Bai Jianchan. This was still an honor for a famous genius like him.

The princess then turned her eyes towards the domain and told the rest: “It’s not easy crossing through this place. I need to prepare a formation with the help of everyone by clearing a space. I apologize for the incoming hardship.”

“It’s no big deal, leave it to us. I can’t wait to see your supreme formation.” The godchild was in a great mood.

She was renowned for being an expert at formation. Thus, most wanted to see what she got.

The trio of geniuses followed her instructions and readied a large field for the formations. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Alright, please back off.” They chased away those nearby and the treasure-seekers.

These cultivators didn’t appreciate this since some were still busy hunting for treasures in Fire Domain.

“Fire Domain doesn’t belong to you! On what ground is this demand!?” One expert voiced their indignation.

“Based on this.” An expert from Firmaments snorted and tapped his sword.

The furious crowd didn’t dare to say anything. It was unwise to antagonize these behemoths especially when an alliance has been formed. They wouldn’t be able to handle this big problem then.
