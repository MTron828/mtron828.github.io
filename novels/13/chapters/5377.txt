Chapter 5378: The Troublemakers Are Here

The devastating battle forced ancestors to retreat, unable to withstand the terrible shock waves.

This was a fight between the best of the best and they did not hold back. One side unleashed everything in their offensive arsenal while their opponents just needed to buy enough time for Ye Fantian to finish her dao search.

“They came prepared, let’s see who’ll be the last ones smiling.” Ferocity observed.

“Will All-things Dao Lord come?” Xiao Hu hid behind Li Qiye since he couldn’t withstand the power of the battle.

“Who knows? Depends on if he’s willing to swallow his pride. He rarely intervenes but if he does, it’ll decide the outcome.” Ferocity said.

“If All-things come, so will Swordsea.” Li Xian’er responded.

“This might escalate to an apex-level fight then.” Xiao Hu became emotional.

This could end up in an all-out war between Dao and Divine Alliance. Dao Alliance already had a powerful enemy in Heaven Alliance so this was a risky move.

A third group appeared outside the battlefield in a triangular formation, also consisting of conquerors and dragon lords. The leaders were two men and one woman.

The woman wore a fox-fur coat, looking rather lovely. Her skin exuded dignified rays that overshadowed her charming appearance.

One of the men was as tall as a peak while adorning a full set of armor. His defense appeared impeccable while his aura took the form of rolling boulders, capable of crushing any enemy.

The second man had a wolf head and a human body. His fur was silver; his eyes were as large as gemstones. His aura resembled a tornado of blades - it was best to not get close.

“Autumn, Arsenal, and Wild Conqueror.” Spectators’ expressions changed after seeing them.

“Azure School is joining too.” Someone commented.

“These shitty troublemakers again.” Ferocity murmured: “Always behind recent problems, seems like they’re just a bunch of madmen now, no longer the same as before.”

Although these three conquerors were weaker than Myriad Eye and Five-sun, they had more men in comparison. They certainly came more prepared than Dao and Divine Alliance.

Autumn, the female cultivator, had ten dao fruits. She was an orphan taken in by Illumination Conqueror.

Arsenal, the armored giant, had ten dao fruits. Rumor has it that before joining Azure, he had his own sect. He lost a fight with a conqueror from The Race, resulting in his family and sect being exterminated. From then on, he swore to eradicate The Race.

Wild was a demon wolf known for his cruelty and murderous nature. Since he only had nine dao fruits, he wasn’t the strongest conqueror. Nonetheless, his kill count was among the top. Because of this, he had enemies on both sides. Joining Azure School was one way to stay alive.

“Is this Azure School’s full power?” A spectator saw how the three conquerors were surrounding the battlefield.

“In order to regain their prestige and support from The People, they must do something noteworthy again, similar to how Illumination stopped Heaven Alliance back then. That’s the only way to garner more followers.” A dragon lord had a good grasp on the situation.

“Illumination’s reputation wavered recently. If he wants to rule Dao Alliance, he needs flawless victories henceforth.” An ancient ancestor agreed.

Illumination’s past effort to stop Heaven Alliance earned him the respect of his fellow men. The creation of Dao Alliance united The People as well.

Alas, Emperors War ended with heavy casualties and his defeat. He had no choice but to leave Dao Alliance with the few remaining survivors.

His unbeatable legend shattered afterward, not to mention people started reflecting on the devastating nature of war.

Now, he no longer had the same authority and charisma as before. Therefore, in order to return to Dao Alliance, he must rebuild his unbeatable reputation. This was a prime opportunity for him.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Autumn, Arsenal, and Wild each summoned a gigantic sword.

A chilling sword dao immediately froze the area. Even conquerors shuddered after sensing this murderous aura.

“Heavenslay Sword Formation!” Someone recognized the three swords.

They flew into the sky and activated a sword formation over the battlefield.

“What are you doing?!” Myriad Eye became alarmed and stopped fighting Five-sun.

“Are they crazy, conquerors from Dao Alliance are still in there.” Spectators couldn’t believe what they were seeing.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
