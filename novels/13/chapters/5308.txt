Chapter 5309: Blood-sucking Entity

Silence ensued since no one dared to provoke Li Qiye. Neutral spectators and hidden masters only observed in silence.

“Pop!” In a distant space, a barely audible noise sounded. This was akin to something opening their eyes or shifting their body ever so slightly.

The negligible change in sound and space couldn’t be heard by anyone except Li Qiye. He turned in that direction and focused his gaze, piercing through the dimensions.

The unknown entity became afraid and immediately stopped moving, seemingly evaporating from thin air.

Li Qiye continued to scan for a bit before speaking: “We’re leaving.”

“I’m not going.” The middle-aged man said.

“Where do you want to go then?” Li Qiye didn’t expect this.

“I’m going home.” The man happily patted Moon Embrace and his shrunken tavern before heading into Lesser Firmament.

“How come?” Li Qiye asked because the guy didn’t wish to go to Lesser Firmament before.

“I’m in a great mood since First Brother is gone.” The man responded, looking like an excited young master during the new year celebration.

Of course, everyone stared at him enviously. Who wouldn’t want to be wearing Moon Embrace? There was nothing bad about being an idiot young master if it meant having one of the five immortal armaments.

“I’m not following you anymore.” The man added without bothering to look at Li Qiye, acting as if he was no longer in need of money.

“Idiot, you fell into his trap again. You’re screwed now.” Firmament Godchild still sensed the man’s movement despite being extremely far away. He decided to keep on traveling far away from Lesser Firmament.

“Enjoy your stay then.” Li Qiye didn’t stop him.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The man happily entered the portal with his Moon Embrace, seemingly tired of working so hard outside. It was time for the young master to inherit his wealth.

Everyone was curious about him - why did he get to return to Lesser Firmament? What was his actual identity?

As for the immortal emperors, they wanted to keep Li Qiye and came over to bow. Alas, he had no intention of lingering here.

Li Zhitian and the others immediately caught up to him.

“Where are we going now, Young Noble?” Li Zhitian asked, thinking that Li Qiye was searching for something.

“Just taking a look at something.” Li Qiye leaped up into the air and opened a portal.

“Buzz.” The group entered and found themselves in a rather bizarre world.

Blood seemed to be pouring down from the red sky along with a foul evil energy. Even the vegetation appeared strange and had twisted grimaces.

Every inch of the land had been cursed and inflicted with malice, destined to be abandoned. The inhabitants of the land have been rejected by the high heaven itself. Thus, they could only stay here.

“Evil Reborn!” The old servant had a serious expression.

“That’s where we are?” Li Zhitian shuddered.

Evil Reborn, another of the four broken realms, was the home to many evil creatures.

According to the legends, existences who had fallen into the darkness would reincarnate here.

“Is this really a land of reincarnations?” Li Zhitian found this place to be different from the other three.

“Of course not, the so-called broken realms are just abandoned lands with a tragic story.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Tragic story? I haven’t heard of this before.” Li Zhitian said.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t elaborate. He moved on and took a look around.

The group could tell that he was searching for something.

“My Lord, what are you searching for?” The old servant asked.

“Just checking on a particular creature.” Li Qiye said.

“What’s so special about it?” Zhitian was curious.

“It belongs to a race that shouldn’t exist.” Li Qiye said.

“A race that shouldn’t exist?” Zhitian murmured.

Li Qiye gazed into the horizon before answering: “A madman was cursed, taking everything else down with him.”

“The race that was created.” The old servant had more information regarding the elusive tales.

“Creation is not the right word here.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Only a derivation at best.”

“What’s the difference?” Zhitian asked.

“Combining certain things.” Li Qiye said.

“Like the blood race?” The old servant had fear deep in his eyes.

“Now this I have heard of, an ancient race from the nine worlds. Their ancestors were evil creatures.” Zhitian said.

“Half of their bloodline is evil. The pure-blooded ones are extinct now.” Li Qiye said.

“From what I know, their progenitor and a blood-sucking entity gave birth to descendants. Strangely enough, the latter branch was wiped out while the blood race continues.” The old servant said.

“I don’t think this type of origin story is limited to the blood race. The ghost race has something similar too, their progenitor sleeping with a ghost or a dead corpse, eventually giving birth to the ghost race. It’s a bit ridiculous.” Li Zhitian thought that this fetish was too much.

Even True Bear let out a roar after hearing the necrophilia story.
