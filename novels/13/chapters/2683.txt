The Mu System has turned to ashes, not only the clan but also the entire system.

Not a single living soul could be found in the vast land of the Mu, only fragmented bits of flesh and limbs - truly a horrific scene from hell.

The spectators were naturally scared out of their mind.

“Ugh...” People started vomiting. This wasn’t limited to the young disciples either. Even the experts from the previous generations or ancestors vomited too. This development was just too cruel. Just hearing about it was frightening enough, let alone witnessing with their own eyes.

Wars have never stopped between cultivators in history. Numerous sects were destroyed in each generation and even systems.

However, those systems had their leading power defeated or their dao source destroyed. These events would lead to the system itself declining.

This wasn’t the case here. Billions of disciples instantly lost their lives and everything from the system was stolen. Corpses piled up like mountains and oceans of blood filled the sky.

This type of destruction was quite rare and has enough shock value to earn a special spot in the historical annals.

Many thought that if Fiercest were to destroy the Mu, he would only take down the leading clan or cripple the dao source. The remaining sects and kingdoms in the system would be spared. Their future survival would be up to them.

But now, Solar Daoist has taken down the Mu System as a whole after devouring the life forces of its inhabitants.

No one among the spectators expected this development, same with the Mu Clan. People continued to puke out the content of their stomach. Some even dropped to the ground in a fetal position, completely pale, drenched with cold sweats, and with hair standing on end.

“Ah...” The emperor let out his final scream with his eyes wide open. It contained deep hatred and unwillingness.

He and the rest didn’t expect to be betrayed like this by the daoist. One wrong step and the entire system was lost. Their decision brought doom to everyone.

He trusted the daoist because the daoist saved his life during the previous battle. Moreover, Li Qiye had killed Lu Weijun, so the clan thought that they shared a common enemy in Li Qiye and that they would work together to take him down.

They didn’t know that he had schemed against them from the very beginning. Saving his life and the fusion method were part of the bait. Plus, he needed the emperor alive so that the guy could fuse with the Mu’s dao source. The emperor was taken advantage of from start to finish.

“Rumble!” The emperor’s despair, hatred, and regrets couldn’t change anything. His great form eventually crumbled and scattered with the wind.

Solar Daoist has successfully absorbed the dao source of the Mu. The spectators became frozen and got chills as if they were trapped in the crevice of a glacier. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“One might be able to survive an act of god, but no one can survive a self-brought calamity...” An old Eternal murmured.

This wouldn’t have happened if the Mu didn’t rely on the daoist to kill Fiercest. They schemed against someone else only to be a victim as well.

“Buzz.” The power of the entire system has been refined by the daoist.

“Crack!” The vast land of the system cracked everywhere. The beautiful mountains and rivers along with the trees lost their vigor. The peaks collapsed and the great lakes dried up...

A system without a dao source would decline at a rapid rate leading to total destruction.

“The entire system is done for, not just the Mu Clan. Only two behemoths exist from now on.” One ancestor sighed with disappointment.

“That was delicious.” The daoist recalled his spear and smacked his lips, savoring the taste.

His appearance changed, no longer looking like a transcending immortal. His hair turned bright red almost like strands of blood fluttering to the wind.

Dao laws spanned behind him almost like a massive tail. This was the result of absorbing the dao source from the Mu. He still hasn’t fully refined its power just yet so the progenitorial laws still rejected him to a certain extent.

A murderous aura engulfed him. It was thick enough to materialize into a bloody halo. People could still smell the sanguine stench despite being far away.

His current appearance and what he had done destroyed his image and reputation. The crowd thought of him as a monstrous devil with bloodstained hands.

That’s why they shuddered while staring at him. Respect was no longer fear, only fear.

They found Fiercest to be far cuter in comparison. Though he was overbearing and ruthless, he did everything openly and had an awe-inspiring presence.

This daoist who they respected before has proven himself to be a merciless devil from the darkness with no compassion for human lives.

“Bringing a wolf home. There’s no free lunch in this world, feeding a devil without being aware of the fact. How foolish.” Li Qiye watched the whole thing and commented insipidly.

Prior to this, everyone assumed that he would be the destroyer of the Mu, not their “ally” and “benefactor”.

These victims probably died with indignation, especially Puresword Emperor. They brought this upon themselves for trusting the wrong person.

But all in all, even without Fiercest around, the daoist probably would have come up with another way to devour the Mu. He needed resources to grow stronger and a sect like the Mu was the perfect dish.
