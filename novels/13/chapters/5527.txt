Chapter 5528: That’s A Luxurious Ride

Niu Fen sprinted at full speed, crossing through dimensions and ten million miles in the blink of an eye.

“Am I a badass or what?” He asked the cloud.

It tilted its body, clearly not impressed.

Niu Fen was annoyed at the lack of reaction and continued: “Your boss is the greatest of them all, the first… no, third… wait, fifth dao lord. I can travel trillions of miles with each leap, is that not badass enough for you?”

The cloud contemplated for a bit before shaking its body.

Li Qiye who moved over to sit on its shell said: “Can’t you tell that the little guy is not being serious and can still keep up with you? Doesn’t sound cool to me.”

“Fuck, watch me!” Niu Fen roared and increased his speed enough that his path could revert the flow of time and space.

He mustered all of his strength and utilized a supreme movement technique, just crossing through one dimension after another.

Alas, despite his storm-like speed, the cloud was still next to him - just drifting normally without doing anything special.

“I’m starting to think you missed the destination, where is this battlefield?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Uh… sorry, Young Master, I’ll take you back now, watch me!” Niu Fen stopped and changed the direction to the right place.

The cloud had no problem keeping up regardless of his speed and direction.

“What is your movement technique?” Niu Fen couldn’t help but ask.

As an apex dao lord on the path of anima, he understood just how fast he was. However, how did this cloud keep up without putting in any effort?

The cloud tilted its head, seeming to ruminate the question. However, it didn’t know any technique - floating was a natural ability.

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t stop Niu Fen from competing with the cloud.

During their competition, a carriage actually appeared and kept up with them as well. This only motivated Niu Fen to go even faster.

He activated his vitality and twelve dao fruits. His anima tree became resplendent and released its power in a torrential manner.

“Go!” It was one thing for the cloud to keep up with him. However, he didn’t want to lose to this carriage.

Alas, he still heard the creaking of the wheels next to him - a sign that this wasn’t working. Eventually, his vitality and energy were depleted enough to force him to slow down.

“Hey there, handsome, want to join me for a ride?” A coquettish voice came from the carriage and sent shivers down Niu Fen’s spine.

He glanced over and saw a woman dressed unfashionably with thick makeup - looking like a bride on her marriage day.

Her plump body in motion was unsettling and made his hair stand on end. The worst part was her flirty demeanor despite her appearance. A wink from her would make men turn and run.

Fortunately, his strong mindset thanks to eras of cultivation prevented him from cursing at her.

Li Qiye patted his back and he stopped running. The carriage stopped as well.

“Ooh, you got a new ride, it’s so luxurious.” A’jiao waved her delicate finger in a flirty manner while looking at Niu Fen.

“Miss, your smile is giving me goosebumps all over.” He couldn’t help but say.

“What the hell did you say, little snail? You dare criticize a supreme beauty such as myself?” She winked seductively at Li Qiye before delivering a swift kick at the snail, sending him flying to the horizon.

“Youn-nnng Massss-ter, I’ll pick you up later tonight!” His voice trailed from afar.

“This cloud is so cute and soft, let me touch you.” She then turned her attention toward the cloud.

It immediately ran and disappeared from sight.

“Okay, Lil’ Bro, just you and me now, let’s continue with our romance.” She held his arm and whispered.

Li Qiye smiled and followed her up the carriage.

“Go!” She shouted and the carriage soared above the firmaments.

Li Qiye sat leisurely while she leaned on his shoulder. Her sizable frame looked as if it could crush his bones.

“It’s been a while, did you miss me?” She asked bashfully but this came out as creepy.

“Not at all.” He smiled.

“Sigh, so heartless, did you find a new love?” She stomped the carriage, causing it to shake violently.

“I knew it, you must have seduced our big sister.” She angrily said: “That’s why she came.

“Are you sure that it’s your sister and not someone else?” He asked.

“Whatever, all from the same place, she only came out a bit earlier, nothing else is remarkable about her at all.” She said resentfully.

“Why are you so sure?” He entertained the conversation.

“Who else could seduce my handsome lover?” She complained.

“What now, going to fight to the death over me?” He smiled.

“You’re such a naughty boy, trying to get us all jealous.” She poked his forehead gently, evoking nausea.

“I think you’ll be reduced to dust after one blow.” He said.

“No way, it’s not like I’ve been doing nothing.” She said: “Lil’ Bro, are you getting tired of me, gonna abandon your poor wife?”

She struck his shoulder playfully and started crying: “You bastard, leaving me like this…”

“Our astrology matching has yet to be checked, you’re getting ahead of yourself. Plus, nothing happened.” He said. [1]

“Really?” A’jiao stopped crying and stared straight at him.

Despite her overall appearance, her eyes shined brightly like the stars.

“Seems like we have something to discuss since you’re here.” He said.

“I knew it, you’re not the heartless type.” She grabbed his arm again and said happily: “I know you’ll be a good husband and plus, my father only wants to betroth me to you.”

1. 八字 is a check based on a person’s birth date and time to see if they will be a good match. I actually had this done as well but it’s more of a formality in my case, and to figure out a good wedding date. A bad match wouldn’t have stopped my marriage since we’re superstitious but not to that level. ☜UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
