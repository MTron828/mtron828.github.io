Chapter 5288: Grand Saber

“I never had big dreams and I still enjoyed my life.” The man said.

“Don’t you want to make money and just hang around the tavern? That’s a dream too. Small dreams are still dreams.” Li Qiye said.

“You’re right, so I guess that’s my dream.” The man said.

“People build one small dream on top of another. When they pile up, they become a big dream.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s a good point.” The man said before becoming cautious: “You know, I feel that there’s something off about you ever since you got here.”

“What do you mean?” Li Qiye asked while chewing some edamame.

“Well, if I have to put it into words, you are an instigator who will push me into doing something bad.” The man stroked his chin and said.

“No way that a good person such as myself would do that.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Who knows? People who talk about dreams are always trying to sell something bad, definitely not to be trusted.” The man remained skeptical.

“Sigh, that hurts. Here I am bringing money to your doorstep yet you call me an instigator.” Li Qiye lamented before taking out another silver ingot and pushing it across the table.

The man’s eyes gleamed after seeing the ingot. He grabbed it for a testing bite before putting it into his pocket and releasing a sigh of satisfaction.

“The customer is always right.” He nodded and said.

“You really have no principles.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Principles? Can that be sold for money?” The man said with a serious expression.

“To be honest, I don’t hate the way you are now, it’s pretty endearing.” Li Qiye said seriously back.

“I’ve always been like this.” The man said with a puzzled expression.

“Not necessarily. Let’s just say that another version of you would be carrying a long saber to chase me from east to west, wanting to cut off my head.” Li Qiye said.

“Nonsense, that’s not something I would do. My elder brother might do that though, he’s a dry person who rarely smiles. Of course, if that situation actually occurs, it means that you must have done something egregiously wrong.” The man shook his head.

“My only fault is wanting to spread warmth and love everywhere.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“It’s hard to say, what if you kidnap someone’s daughter?” The man slapped his thigh and said: “He would really chase you around with a saber then.”

“Does he have a daughter?” Li Qiye entertained the thought.

“Well, I’m not sure, maybe he does, but then again, maybe not.” The man scratched his chin; his memories seemed a bit muddled.

“Bam!” He suddenly slammed the table, stood up, and pointed at Li Qiye: “But you do look like the type to be kidnapping nice girls! A regular saber wouldn’t be enough, a grand saber would be more appropriate to chop your head off and hang it on the city wall!”

“Calm down, calm down, no one is kidnapping your daughter or any other daughter for that matter.” Li Qiye said.

“Uh… you’re right.” The man snapped out of it and sat down, looking a bit dazed. He glanced at Li Qiye and asked: “You really didn’t kidnap anyone’s daughter?”

“Absolutely not. Just think about it, she’s a grown-up who is rather clever. How can she be kidnapped or tricked so easily? If she had gone with someone, it must be out of her own volition, don’t you think?” Li Qiye said.

“The way you put it does make sense.” The man stroked his chin: “She’s not a child and definitely not an idiot.”

At this point, he shook his head: “Maybe I’ve drunk too much, getting all worked up over nothing since I don’t even have a daughter.”

“What about your elder brother?” Li Qiye asked with a faint smile.

“I don’t know, we haven’t seen each other since we were born, I don’t know if he has a daughter.” The man scratched his head and said something nonsensical.

“That’s strange.” Li Qiye responded.

“It’s for the best, I got annoyed just looking at him. Do you know when you brought up someone capable of shouldering the heaven? That’s him, just a fool who doesn’t know how to enjoy life.” The man said.

“Everyone carries something on their shoulder.” Li Qiye said.

“Not me, I don’t care if the sky falls down since taller people will be the ones shouldering.” The man shrugged.

“What if it falls on your tavern?” Li Qiye joked.

“We’ll talk about this when it is actually happening.” The man glanced outside and said.

Li Qiye stared at the man and couldn’t help but sigh softly. He went on to peel an edamame pod, not continuing the conversation.

After a brief silence, he said: “You know, you don’t need to be stuck in this tavern forever.”

“Like I said, I’m content here just living a simple life.” The man responded.

“What comes after?” Li Qiye said before eating the edamame beans.

“Nothing.” The man was becoming agitated.

“You know there is something that comes after.” Li Qiye said.

“I just need to make money now, why bother worrying about the future?” The man said.

“I suppose, everyone makes their own choice.” Li Qiye nodded and said.

“You, as well.” The man said.

“I want to, but there is no other choice.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You got a working head and a working body, so why do you think you have no choice?” The man said.

“Because if I choose, I will cease to be myself.” Li Qiye said seriously.

“What? Why wouldn’t you be yourself?” The man didn’t understand.

“Just like how you are not yourself in the dream, rowing the enormous boat in order to reach the other shore despite being exhausted.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“I see.” The man fell into contemplation, seemingly struggling with his thoughts.

After a while, he shook his head and said: “That was just a dream. There is no problem staying in this tavern and living a simple life.”

“Everyone can choose another version of themselves, it’s just that it’ll be an incomplete version.” Li Qiye sighed.

“Are you complete now?” He stared at Li Qiye.

“Yes, this is me, the only version of myself.” Li Qiye nodded.

“That sounds like a tiring and pitiful way to live.” The man commented.

“And that’s why many people prefer to be incomplete versions instead.” Li Qiye agreed.
