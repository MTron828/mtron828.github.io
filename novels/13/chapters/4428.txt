Chapter 4429: Nine-tailed God

All members of Dragon have prostrated. Meanwhile, outsiders exchanged glances, wondering about the youth’s identity. Of course, the disciples of Dragon had the same question.

Alas, they had to follow their ancient ancestors’ lead and kneel.

“Only an apex existence can make the three ancient demons kneel.” An ancestor became emotional.

“Who? So young too.” A big shot asked.

“There is one person in Dragon worthy of this treatment. He has to be their strongest ancient ancestor, Nine-tailed God!” An old ancestor speculated.

“You’re right. That’s who he is.” Another knowledgeable ancestor observed for a while before reaching this conclusion.

“That’s Nine-tailed God?!” Those nearby became startled.

Both regular disciples and ancestors took a deep breath after hearing this title. If the three ancient demons were renowned, then Nine-tailed God was the sound of unexpected thunder striking everyone’s eardrums.

Nine-tailed God was the strongest ancient ancestor of Dragon. In fact, he was one of the strongest demons altogether.

He had competed against Three-truth Dao Lord, entered Evil Flame Ridge, and obtained a special flame from there.

“Ancient Ancestor…” The young ones from Demon looked up with nothing but reverence in their eyes. They never expected to be able to see this legend one day. It was truly an honor.

“Why is Nine-tailed God so young?” One expert wondered.

“Yes, isn’t his age up there?” Another responded.

Many believed that this ancient ancestor should have white hair and wrinkles. Of course, an aged appearance wouldn’t deter his awe-inspiring aura in the slightest.

However, he looked so young and didn’t have any intimidating presence. If he were to claim to be Nine-tailed God in a different circumstance, some might start laughing and tell him that he was tired of living, pretending to be Nine-tailed God.

“Wait, I recognize him…” On the other hand, the members of Little Diamond became astounded because they had seen him before.

He was none other than the youth who sold them the old box back in the wonton restaurant - Wang Zining!

They couldn’t believe that they had an interaction with this legendary character. Moreover, some of them were disrespectful as well. Thinking about this made them break out in cold sweat.

One ancient ancestor from the same generation became sentimental. Time spared no one but this man was still as vigorous and youthful as before.

“I can’t believe he’s still alive, and look at how young he is too.” A younger ancestor commented.

This being has been gone for so long now. The members of Dragon had no idea about his current condition and location. Because of this, there were rumors of his demise.

In fact, even the three ancient demons had no knowledge of this. Nonetheless, all of them heaved a sigh of relief. Their guardian was still around - this was the best of news possible.

“Boom!” Peacock Monarch eventually gave up on struggling. He knew just how strong Nine-tailed God was so struggling was futile.

Due to the suppression, he was reverted back to his true form - a magnificent peacock.

“Impetuous and impulsive, careless and unobservant, I sentence you to five thousand years of reflection.” Nine-tailed God waved his hand and banished Peacock Monarch to isolated confinement.

The scene fell into a hush; the crowd didn’t dare to breathe loudly in the presence of a supreme being.

Though he spoke in a calm fashion, each word carried immense weight and affected the mind.

“Demon God!” The ex-sect master of Five-sun was ecstatic and asked him for help: “This heinous villain is out of control, please destroy him…”

Eyes darted between Li Qiye and the demon god right away. They thought that no one would be able to stop the latter since he was on a different level.

“Does Li Qiye have a chance?” A youth asked.

“Impossible. Nine-tailed God is one of the strongest demons in the world, an apex existence. Li Qiye might be unfathomable but still can’t stop him.” An expert shook his head.

“I agree completely.” Another said.

Most watched with bated breath; some eagerly awaited a battle since they wanted to see the demon god in action. They would then get a taste of “invincibility”. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, the demon god stared at the ex-sect master and said: “Dragon will not interfere with this feud.”

This answer caught everyone off guard since this place was a ceremonial square of Dragon - absolutely their territory and jurisdiction.

The ex-sect master turned pale and staggered backward. He thought that the demon god would be able to destroy Li Qiye. Alas, the demon god refused to help him.

Featherhat Paragon joined in: “Demon God, please uphold justice and destroy this evil man!”

The demon god didn’t bother answering. Featherhat might be influential in this generation but was still only a junior.
