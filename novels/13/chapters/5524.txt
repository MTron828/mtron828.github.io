Chapter 5525: Nine Words

“How many are under you right now?” Li Qiye asked.

The voice took a while to answer, seemingly attempting to remember or calculate an answer: “Unsure, at least half are unknown.”

“Half.” He mused: “Some will be transformation and derivation while others are aggregations.”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“It’s all in the mortal world.” The voice drifted far away, seemingly merging into the lower realms.

“I don’t think so.” He shook his head.

The voice was omnipresent and could derive everything. It performed a full cycle of prosperity and decline. This went on infinitely before it responded: “The flows of the world are connected and ever integrated. All of these connections are why the egg is awakened.”

“An epoch and its momentum?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, during its golden age.” The voice continued the calculating process.

“What are the results of missing words or all nine being there? The former might result in ignorance and perpetual slumber but if all nine are there, does that increase the reception?” He asked.

“Hmm…” The voice’s derivation continued but suddenly, lightning bolts could be heard. A figure could be seen within the expanse of lightning - was this the high heaven?

“You’re unsure.” Li Qiye smiled.

“An egg such as yourself knows already.” The voice didn’t come up with an answer.

“Alas, I am not.” He shook his head.

“If you change to an egg, perhaps you will see all nine.” The voice said.

“You’re only saying this because I’m not one. If I make that change, you’ll be running for your life.” He chuckled.

After a brief silence, the voice suggested: “Maybe topple one of the avatars as a catalyst.”

“It might not be around or they have fused.” He said.

“I see…” The voice said: “What would you do in this position? Perform simulations.”

“Simulations are not possible because I do not and never have thought about becoming an egg.” He shook his head.

“And why is that?” The voice became closer, seemingly existing right in front of him to take a closer look.

“I am not an egg and never was, my true self is me alone. He is an egg because that is his anima.” He smiled.

“His anima.” The voice contemplated: “What if it isn’t?”

“What do you think the egg’s anima and the true self are then?” He asked a crucial question.

Something flashed for a split second in front of Li Qiye.

“Nothing.” The voice said with uncertainty.

“Then isn’t that a perfect match with what an egg is?” He pressed on.

“Try to turn it around?” The voice eventually suggested.

“What’s the point? Nothing will just be nothing.” He shook his head.

“What about those words?” The voice asked with a hint of optimism.

“I’ve thought about this occasionally but it won’t work because they might be involved, serving as a connection.” He responded.

“Of course.” The void said with confidence: “Emotions and desires exist in the mortal world and leave their marks, connections are always possible.”

“Right, it wouldn’t be the mortal world without emotions and desires, only a realm of stillness and no living beings, no different from death. At that point, destruction or otherwise, no longer relevant.” He said.

“Just words.” The voice took a while before concluding.

“Yes, words capable of derivation. Without that, there is no meaning to your existence. The eternal dao and its mysteries won’t be there, only a single word.” He said: “Derivation and development are the values of your existence, necessary not only for living beings but also yourself.”

“What about you?” The voice asked.

“I have my own aspiration and you have yours.” He smiled.

“Words can have aspirations?” The voice asked.

“Of course, but it has to be alive first with emotions.” He said.

“...” The voice couldn’t feel because it wasn’t a living being.

“Since you don’t have them, answer this, for what reason do you exist?” He asked.

The voice contemplated but had no answer.

“I, a living being, yearn for the ultimate answer.” He said: “What about you?”

After a complicated calculation, it answered: “No beginning and no end.”

“I see, everything being the same at a singular point, already like that at the start and will be like that at the end. I suppose that is a purpose but for whom does it serve?” He nodded before asking.

“Unsure.” The voice said: “For the sake of the nine words turning into nine treasures and from that, nine scriptures.”

“For what? Nothing is next, only an abrupt and inevitable return to the starting point, there is no other shore.” He said.

The voice fell into silence, perhaps attempting to derive an answer again.

“How matter how hard you try, the calculation is limited internally to your being. Sure, the results can be profound but supreme but ultimately, they are nothing more than futile effort.” He said.
