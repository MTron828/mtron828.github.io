Chapter 4235: Battle Between Overlords

No one had a good idea whether Everlasting was actually comparable to Myriad Era or otherwise. However, it was clear that when used in conjunction, Everlasting had produced incredible results and meritorious battle feats.

The translucent rays emanating from Everlasting seemed to be in tune with the grand dao. The aura of its user instantly changed as well, becoming a sword god instead of an ordinary woman.

As she stood there, she seemingly fused into the world. As long as the universe existed, so would she. The five elements and mortal coil no longer restrained her.

Her aura was one of elegance, not the oppressive type of immortal energies. Everlasting was indeed the right character to describe her - a being capable of standing on the river of time, unsurpassable by anyone.

She became an observer of history; always present in all events. The crowd understood her title at last.

“Everlasting, a legendary blade.” Vastsea Venerable praised.

“Clank!” He unsheathed his sword, causing clouds and mist to surround him.

“Torrential Rain Blade, personally crafted by him.” An expert said while looking at the divine sword.

It accompanied the venerable across numerous battlefields and made a name for itself. He also created a matching sword law to boost its power.

“Boom!” His twelve fate palaces emerged and released his vitality outward.

Dark clouds took over the sky vault; thunder crackles came next. The entire ocean was being affected by this looming storm.

Spectators were horrified to see such a powerful phenomenon. Everything else seemed as feeble as paper in comparison.

“Rumble!” Fiery shockwaves swept through the air and forced the spectators to run even farther away.

“Why isn’t he using the heavenly swords or their dao?” One youth asked.

“They are undoubtedly strong but for apex existences, they would prefer to use suitable weapons and merit laws. He doesn’t have as much mastery with the heavenly dao as he does his own. There would be too many flaws and openings.” An ancestor explained.

“Yes, using one’s own dao and merit law will be better in the end.” A king nodded in agreement.

“Either way, we will finally get to see the overlords in battle.” Many watched with bated breath.

“Just stay far away, it’s fine if we can’t see. Better that than being killed by stray slashes.” Someone advised because being careless could mean turning into ashes.

Meanwhile, Hallowed City Lord and Tie Jian glanced at each other since Vastsea Venerable was supposed to be their opponent.

“Fellow Daoists, it seems like I have to get through you two first.” Earthraiser Vajra smiled.

In order to get to Li Qiye, he must get through the obstacles first. These two were clearly on Li Qiye’s side.

“Li Qiye is something else, he’s all alone yet he managed to muster a force capable of fighting Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel.” An expert said.

Li Qiye had done the impossible without looking too suicidal. Many powerful existences have joined his side.

“Please give us pointers, Dao Brother.” The two agreed to fight the vajra.

“Good, I haven’t exercised in a long time, let’s have a friendly duel then.” The vajra smiled.

His words were cordial but the glint in his eyes was anything but. He clearly wouldn’t show mercy during the battle.

“Clank!” Hallowed raised his sword and dao runes appeared around it with loud detonations.

Tie Jian was already eager to fight; he looked like a new war god with the blade in his hand - eager for conquest.

“The Boundless Dao.” The vajra roared and became resplendent with massive golden rays. He resembled a scorching sun illuminating the world.

He released his fate palaces as well and let their power roam free. The pressure of thousands of mountains descended on the spectators. Each inch of space was being victimized by an intolerable weight.

“Damn!” Weak cultivators turned pale and were paralyzed on the ground.

“So this is the power of an overlord.” Many were horrified after the vajra revealed his true power. They felt like insects that could be killed with one stomp.

Of course, Hallowed and Tie Jian were far stronger. They had an easy time withstanding this level of pressure.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
