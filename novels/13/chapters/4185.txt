Chapter 4186: Just Like That?

Cultivators exchanged looks of surprise after hearing Li Qiye’s answer. They were waiting for him to do something miraculous about this palace.

However, he only wanted to bring Chen Cangsheng in and not himself?

“Does he think the dragon palace is his house? That he can bring people in and out whenever?” A youth remained skeptical.

“I actually believe that he can enter but to let someone else in? The difficulty is far higher.” An expert replied.

“I believe him and his otherworldly sorcery.” Another was absolutely confident in Li Qiye.

“How is he going to do it? The money fall method?” One ancestor commented.

“That is possible, he has absolute mastery over that technique, as long as he has enough, he’ll be able to smash his way in.” An ancient king said: “After all, it is said that the power of this technique is only limited by money.”

“How much will he need? 30,000 dao lord jades? In my opinion, the lowest is 3,000,000. The highest should be 30,000,000. Honestly, who the hell knows? Maybe 300,000,000.” One speculator said.

“300,000,000 dao lord jades? Only the behemoths can afford this sum after using up their treasury.” A sacred lord took a deep breath.

“The question is, is it worth it to enter the palace? In this case, he’s letting someone else in. There are better uses for this amount such as establishing a large sect.” One more quietly said.

No one could argue with this. Though they knew that Li Qiye was immensely rich and could afford this sum, they thought that it wasn’t worth it to bring someone else into the palace. Moreover, he could just buy a dao lord weapon outright with it.

In fact, not to mention an outsider, a sect still wouldn’t spend this amount just to gain entry to the palace for its own disciple.

Nine-sun Sword Saint was curious as well, wanting to see how Li Qiye would take the youth inside. He knew that given his power, it would be impossible to rely on brute force.

The only way was to wait for more powerful allies and work together. In his opinion, Li Qiye’s success, in this case, would be nothing short of a miracle.

He had heard of Li Qiye’s exploits before so he actually took this seriously. After thinking it through, he couldn’t come up with anything outside of a direct confrontation.

Alas, Li Qiye didn’t seem to be preparing for an attack. The guy looked as if this was no big deal to him - as simple as opening a door. The mystique only added to his anticipation.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye didn’t care for their comments. He smiled and asked Chen Cangsheng: “Are you ready?”

“I am, Young Noble.” Cangsheng took a deep breath and nodded solemnly.

Li Qiye then sauntered towards the palace with Cangsheng right behind him.

All eyes were on the duo, wanting to see what Li Qiye would do to solve this difficult problem. Shi Yingxue and Snowcloud Princess felt the same way.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

They have witnessed Li Qiye’s devilish style before and had considerable confidence in him. Nonetheless, they couldn’t imagine how he would bypass the great dragon.

“Creak…” The coiling dragon stopped and stared at Li Qiye, letting out a soft cry instead of a roar.

“Okay, I’m starting.” Li Qiye smirked and told Cangsheng.

“Yes, Young Noble, I…” Cangsheng was nervous at first but decided to go through with it.

He couldn’t finish before finding himself spinning in the air. Li Qiye had grabbed his ankle and lifted him up.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” Li Qiye spun him repeatedly as if he was a windmill. The rotation speed continuously increased until people couldn’t see him anymore, only a whirlwind.

“I’m, I’m gonna puke!” Cangsheng’s voice was barely audible due to the rotational speed.

People exchanged glances - how was this going to help him get into the dragon palace?

“Whoosh!” Li Qiye finally let go and Cangsheng shot forward like a meteor.

“Bam!” He perfectly flew by the dragon and slammed onto the gate of the palace, pushing the doors open and making it through.

“Ugh…” Listeners could hear him puking inside and imagine his pale state.

“Creak…” The gate closed again.

Everyone became frozen, including Nine-sun Sword Saint. They had thought of various methods but this was not one of them.

They believed that money fall was the most likely candidate. Li Qiye could have also come up with other plans. Alas, throwing Cangsheng straight in there was not on their mind.

“How the hell did he do that?” Cultivators accepted this impossible reality since they witnessed it in person.

“Sorcery is not enough to describe this brat’s ability.” One expert shook his head.

“I’ve seen plenty of strange things in my life, but this is a first. My horizon has broadened.” Nine-sun Sword Saint couldn’t help but praise.
