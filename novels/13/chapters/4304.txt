Chapter 4305: Wonton

The disciples from Little Diamond didn’t know what to do. Though they were just a tiny sect, if their sect master wanted a dao companion, she still had to be a cultivator.

Even the weakest cultivators rarely married mortals. After all, they were from two separate worlds.

“What type of girl do you have in mind?” He smiled while staring at the aunt.

“...” His fellow members exchanged glances, speechless.

An older disciple secretly pulled Li Qiye’s sleeve in order to remind him about his status.

“There are many.” The aunt’s eyes flashed brightly as she responded: “I”m not exaggerating but I have quite a reputation in Bodhisattva. I know everyone and can help you find the right bride, do you have anyone in mind?”

“That sounds pretty great, I guess good things just happen to me because I’m handsome?” He phrased it like a question.

Some disciples nearly spat out their food. Their sect master was such a narcissist?

Even a blind guy could see that the word “handsome” and he had nothing to do with each other. He looked as common as can be. Nonetheless, he still spoke with confidence and didn’t feel any shame.

“That’s obvious, your handsome appearance can shake the heaven and earth.” The aunt laughed: “Given your appearance, just say the word and hmm, Butcher Zhang’s daughter, Tailor Liu’s little girl, oh, Lad Bai from the eastern noble clan… you can pick any of them.”

“Our sect master isn’t interested.” Finally, a disciple got up and protested.

None of those mortal girls are worthy of becoming their sect mistress.

“Who says I’m not interested?” Li Qiye waved his hand, gesturing for the disciple to sit back down: “I’m definitely interested, it’s just that given my dashing looks, it would be awfully unfair for me to marry just one, no? I would be doing myself a disservice.”

“...” His disciples became speechless because of their sect master’s rampant ego.

“Sect Master, this, this isn’t quite right.” Elder Hu quietly whispered since this was heading down an unsavory path.

“No, it’s perfect. Aunt, what do you think?” Li Qiye smiled. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Perfect indeed.” The aunt seemed to understand Li Qiye and said: “You might just be the most handsome man in history. Yes, yes, just marrying one wife is letting down the heaven and earth for sculpting you. Three wives and four concubines? Not enough either. Hmm, three palaces and six chambers should be a good starting point.” [1]

“Well said, you took the words right out of my mouth!” Li Qiye clapped and laughed.

This ridiculous conversation made the disciples think that Li Qiye had given the boss a big tip, hence the enthusiastic flattery and reception.

“Sigh, it must be nice being young, capable of doing whatever and enjoying the happiness of this world.” She suddenly became sentimental and let out a sigh.

“From the start of time, the things that cause the most pain to humans are emotions and ties, don’t you think?” Li Qiye said.

This sudden shift in this conversation caught the students off guard. He went from bragging shamelessly to becoming philosophical.

“Sigh, let’s not talk about this depressing subject.” The aunt regained her good spirit and said: “Pick the day, young brother, and I will introduce you to all the girls.”

“It’s alright, no need for such meticulous planning. Leave it to fate. Once fate comes, it’ll happen naturally.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It’ll happen naturally when fate comes.” The aunt nodded in agreement and appreciated the comment: “How open-minded. Very well, once you find a girl you like, let me know. Even if she doesn’t like you, I’ll tie her up and bring her to you.”

“...” This rendered the students speechless again. The woman turned from a matchmaker to a potential kidnapper.

Moreover, they felt quite strange about this meeting. The aunt clearly knew that they were cultivators yet still acted familiar with them, especially their sect master. The way they interacted resembled a mother meeting her future son-in-law.

The closeness between these two was akin to two friends, not strangers meeting for the first time. They didn’t know why their sect master was acting so nice towards a mortal either. The two weren’t on the same level at all.

Cultivators didn’t want to speak casually to a mortal aunt. On the other hand, mortals didn’t dare to speak to cultivators in this manner either.

Mortals looked up to cultivators and acted in a subservient manner. Alas, this aunt felt no pressure while being in their presence.

“Accept my early gratitude then.” Li Qiye smiled.

Despite this weird development, the members of Little Diamond continued eating without commenting.

Wang Weiqiao didn’t ask anything since he remembered Li Qiye’s advice early on - just observe and speak less.

“Sigh, this is a great place.” Li Qiye spoke while eating another bowl, once again confusing the listeners.

The shop only had their group right now because no one else wanted wontons at this hour.

However, a customer finally came in - a youth wearing a regal robe that was meticulously embroidered. Each line was crafted perfectly - a testament to its exquisite and expensive nature.

Earlier, Li Qiye and the aunt were talking about him being handsome. This youth matched that description far more than Li Qiye.

His facial features were immaculate - bright eyes and long brows. Staring at him made others feel quite good.

He was clearly born of nobility and has been pampered since birth. He carried a long box on his arm. It appeared to be quite old, most likely containing a precious treasure.

“Boss, one wonton bowl please.” He asked the woman.

“It’s getting late, there isn't any left.” The aunt said without bothering to look at him.

“Aren’t they eating?” The youth asked.

“I said there is none left.” She repeated.

The members of Little Diamond wondered about her cold attitude. Logically, the youth was more handsome than Li Qiye so she should be more enthusiastic.

“That’s okay then, how about just a bowl of soup?” The youth still had a smile on his face.
