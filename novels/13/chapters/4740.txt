Chapter 4741: Deathvenom Spider

“He’s still alive!” Many cultivators shouted.

An ancestor smiled and said: “Li Qiye can’t die that easily. After all, he has the style of a dao lord already.”

“Right, the spider god won’t have an easy time here.” A demon king didn’t find this surprising either.

“You!” The massive spider became alarmed because he had killed numerous combatants with this combo.

Mighty cultivators could have stopped the leg spears but once infected by the venom, death was only a matter of time. In this case, Li Qiye remained untouched by both.

“Pathetic creature, your arrogance ends here.” Li Qiye said.

The spider god became livid. Though his reputation was rather unsavory, his power couldn’t be denied. Even the monarchs from the behemoths were wary of him. This was his first time being called “pathetic” by anyone.

Alas, time wasn’t on his side because Li Qiye suddenly grabbed his monstrous body, fully immobilizing him.

“Rumble!” Debris scattered everywhere as Li Qiye smashed him repeatedly.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” The spider was the size of a mountain thus the smashes caused considerable damage to the ground, leaving chasms and pits behind. This caused the spider god to bellow in agony while venomous liquid splashed everywhere and corroded the ground.

He struggled and struggled, only to fail to escape from Li Qiye’s grasp. The dominating demon god became a rag doll in no time at all to the spectators’ astonishment.

“Boom!” He was left inside a pit, covered in wounds from top to bottom. Venom spilled out of his mouth as he looked to be on his last breath.

“Crack!” His exoskeleton started breaking.

Li Qiye continued by breaking the spider’s long legs, one by one. Eventually, only the main body was left on the ground, unable to move.

“Damn, brutal.” Jaws dropped to the ground and cold chills took over.

The pale spectators couldn’t believe how weak the spider god was compared to Li Qiye.

The conquerors gasped as well. Though the spider wasn’t at the invincible level, he did sweep through the world before, victoriously.

They could accept Li Qiye winning after three or five moves of serious fighting. But now, the spider was thrown around like a rag doll, as feeble as can be.

“He’s about to die…” Someone commented.

“This is how a great demon is to die? Utter humiliation.” A different demon god became afraid. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Still alive, but it can’t get worse than this. Not even a chance to fight back before being ripped apart.” An ancient ancestor commented.

By this point, the big shots of the alliance had a serious expression. They were aware of the spider god’s power and found his loss shocking.

“Crack!” Just when everyone thought that the spider was finished, the large body cracked open and released a large amount of venom and blinding green lights.

Everyone then saw a spider climbing out of the shell, only the size of a fist and jade-green from top to bottom.

The radiant spider looked angry. Nonetheless, its glow wasn’t one of the evil affinity.

“What is that thing?” This naturally surprised the crowd.

Once the tiny spider got out, the original body fully collapsed. The area around it became a forbidden lake that would consume any trespasser.

The spider flew up into the air and kept a safe distance from Li Qiye. It looked afraid while staring at him.

“A deathvenom spider, that’s his true form.” An ancient demon revealed.

“I see.” Many were surprised to see that the giant spider wasn’t his true form.

They could also see the fear in the deathvenom spider. He would have died if he didn’t have this secret.

Nonetheless, it made it clear to him that he was no match for Li Qiye alone.

The atmosphere became tense once more. The young geniuses have lost despite being empowered by last-gen cultivators. The notorious spider god’s ambush also failed spectacularly.

The alliance started planning its next move. The first to speak was none other than the River Demon of Death: “Fellow Daoists, it is time.”
