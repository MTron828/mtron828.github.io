Chapter 4809: Triune Alligator Lord

This being had a wonderful understanding of the supreme truths. Its thought gained a creation and derivation potential.

The world was in the presence of a supreme overlord - one at full power.

“Triune Alligator Lord.” The overlord of a burial ground whispered: “Never punished by a tribulation before, returning in its peak state.”

“One of the three supreme overlords from Triune Cycle Epoch, he’s the only one who is still alive.” Another overlord sighed: “How fortunate.”

Supreme overlords were frightening characters; some have lived for epochs.

One epoch consisted of ten million years; a few lasted for much longer. From the start to finish was a maturity process ending with untold resources and power. Alas, all the previous couldn’t escape destruction. Only a selected few living beings were lucky enough to survive.

The destruction happened for various reasons. Ultimately, the strongest lord of that epoch or even the creator of the epoch would have a chance to fight at the end of the world.

Some chose to fight, others chose to hide. Only one thing was virtually certain - being unable to escape unscathed from the punishment and suppression of the high heaven.

This happened to the overlords inside the burial grounds and old earths. They were still suffering from these old injuries.

Of course, there were exceptions to everything. Back during the Triune Cycle, something different occurred. The epoch didn’t reach full maturity before a war between their three supreme overlords started.

One of the three overlords, the Alligator Lord, had its soul severed from the body and was banished. Because of this, it managed to escape the true destruction subsequently. 

The same couldn’t be said for the other overlords who paid a heavy toll just to survive. Today, Dao Sanqian performed a ritual to awaken it on top of bringing its soul back to the body.

The great lord roared again and its aura swept through ten million miles. Every lifeform in that region turned to dust.

It opened its mouth and started sucking in another continent. The great powers and even dao lord lineages activated their barriers and shot out offensive beams. This was proven futile and all were devoured by the overlord.

“The Land of Stars is gone…” Others trembled after seeing this.

That place had thousands of lineages but it was gone now in a matter of seconds.

“Destruction is coming…” Another overlord murmured.

“Run!” Top cultivators only had a single thought on their mind - run away.

However, there was no safe place to hide. The alligator overlord was massive and could swallow the world whole.

“He did this to his own epoch, just a continuous rampage of feeding.” A burial ground lord deep in space murmured.

“Who will save us?!” Regular cultivators and even ancestors in the path of the beast lamented.

Alas, no one answered their call for help.

“They brought this upon themselves. No one stepped up to prevent this.” A supreme overlord in an old earth commented.

When Dao Sanqian offered his sect as a sacrifice for an unknown ceremony, the rest of the world simply watched outside of Enveloping Monarch. Now, this was their just deserts for standing idle.

“Raa!” The alligator lord’s appetite was far from being satiated so it stretched its claw for another region.

“It’s coming for He!” Top existences shouted, seeing that one of the Eight Desolaces was the next target.

“Rumble!” The inhabitants of this continent prepared for battle.

The son of a dao lord led the charge while brimming with golden radiance. His dao turned into laws encompassing ten million miles.

A lord of the gods also led his subjects to battle. Their divine powers tried to stop the incoming claw.

“Clank!” One heavenly sword illuminated three thousand words. Each slash displayed utmost invincibility. The user was a legendary sword god.

Countless cultivators soared into the sky, wanting to stop this supreme overlord. Unfortunately, they were no match for this ultimate being.

“Crunch!” The claw grabbed a hundred great powers or so and pulled them back into the beast’s jaw.

Though they were caught, powerful cultivators inside its mouth still attacked repeatedly, wanting to escape.

How could they ever succeed? Even a mythical kun peng had fallen to this supreme overlord.

“Boom!” Meanwhile, the various forbidden zones continued to gather power. The other overlords finally became worried enough to prepare for an actual fight.

“This summoning was a failure, this overlord is not destroying the enemy, only causing a disaster for everyone else.” A burial ground lord whispered.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
