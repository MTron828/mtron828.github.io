Chapter 5072: A Snake In The Legends

Of course, the two have pondered this issue extensively. Alas, they lacked information and access to certain secrets.

“Let’s assume that you will have enough time and chances to let your Cosmic Ancestral Dragon reach full maturity and enter its prime state, how strong will it be?”

The tiger confidently declared: “The lord of an epoch, strong enough to be everlasting.”

“Quite strong, huh?” Li Qiye smiled.

The two beings nodded. They agreed that this prime state was virtually matchless. No Immortal Emperors or anyone else could reach this level.

This dragon would definitely become a supreme overlord and not just an average one. It might be among the strongest of overlords.

“Well, tell me how strong this remnant epoch used to be then during its peak.” Li Qiye said.

The two didn’t answer right away. Judging from the remnant battlefields, they could tell that despite their current cultivation, they were still only minor characters at best if they were living in that epoch.

“Since you called it Divine Beast, there were mature true dragons and phoenixes… they were certainly the lords of that epoch.” Li Qiye continued.

This epoch didn’t have humans and other races, only primarily demons and beasts.

“Alas, this mighty epoch still suffered the same fate as many others, becoming a hunting ground.” Li Qiye said after a brief pause.

The two took a deep breath after receiving confirmation from Li Qiye.

“Long, long ago, it hunted true dragons and ate phoenixes…” Li Qiye’s voice echoed across the temporal sphere and went back in time.

Sentient spirits seemed to be waking up in the maelstrom and were brought back to a dark period.

“In the end, only ruins remained of your beloved epoch.” Li Qiye concluded.

“Young Noble, how do you know all of this?” The dragon said solemnly after hearing the terrible stories.

“I didn’t see it with my own eyes but I’ve excavated a few things and know more than you two.” Li Qiye said.

“So which existence did all of this?” The tiger asked.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Li Qiye had a serious expression for once as he uttered the culprit’s name: “Voracious Leviathan.”

“Voracious Leviathan!” The two shouted after hearing this title.

“Pop!” A bubble came out of the maelstrom. Just this tiny thing alone could destroy the six continents.

The two saw the reaction from the maelstrom and knew that Li Qiye was telling the truth. They became overwhelmed with emotion.

“So you have heard of it.” Li Qiye said: “Do you find it hard to believe? It actually happened all the time, just a normal state of affairs.”

“It can’t be…” They murmured despite knowing the answer deep down.

“Who else then?” Li Qiye asked.

The two harbored such thoughts before due to the circumstantial evidence. Alas, they didn’t want to speculate wildly. Now, it turned out that they were right.

“Saviors don’t exist. Do the two of you consider yourselves saviors too? When you wield the strength to do so for this epoch, will you continue to save it or pick an entirely different path?” Li Qiye said.

“Moreover, Voracious Leviathan is frightening indeed but comparatively, it is rather amateurish. Every hunt there are some mistakes left over, hence these fragmentations. Otherwise, you would have nothing here to be waiting for your ancestral dragon.” Li Qiye said: Samsara, that geezer during his prime, what a work of art, a true master. If you two ever have the chance, go take a look, it is perfect.”

“Didn’t you kill him?” The tiger said.

“I do have to thank the villainous heaven for that. If it wasn’t for the existing wound, the guy wouldn’t have fallen to such a miserable state.” Li Qiye smiled.

The two didn’t say anything for a bit while contemplating the new information.

After a while, the dragon asked: “Is Voracious Leviathan there?”

While asking this question, they felt as if there was something watching them from the shadows.

“Yes, and I have been searching.” Li Qiye smiled: “It lacks finesse but makes up for it with a natural instinct, not to mention its hibernation capability. Otherwise, it would have become hunted as well.”

The two thought that this matter was more complicated than their previous assessment.

“It’ll keep an eye out for you.” The tiger said.

“That’s a good thing, it would be more problematic if I wasn’t a potential target.” Li Qiye shrugged.

The two took a deep breath after realizing Li Qiye’s goal.
