Liu Fuyou prepared a place for the children and was eventually summoned by none other than his master - the peak lord of Eight Zhang, Mountainbearer King.

He was from the same generation as Ping Suoweng but still looked quite young. In fact, others would think that he was younger than Fuyou. Appearance alone can be deceiving.

He didn’t have a tall and sturdy build contrary to his title. He looked rather elegant and scholarly. Only his impressive and awe-inspiring aura indicated his power.

He looked like a strategist that could eventually become a lord. After Fuyou arrived, the king paced steadily around the chamber.

Eight Zhang Peak was surrounded by clouds. As he was walking around, it felt as if he was pressing down and torturing this great mountain because of his mighty presence.

“Fuyou, the children are excellent. Your village might become the sect’s branch one day.” He said.

In Divine Black, most people called Fuyou by his nickname, Thunder Dragon or Leilong. Most have forgotten his real name by this point. Only his master would call him by his actual name since they were close.

“I hope they’ll be able to fly later on and contribute to their home.” Fuyou had high hopes for the children.

The children were very fortunate. They had a good dao foundation already on top of being established at the sect because of Fuyou’s and the mountain king’s support. Ordinary recruits didn’t have these advantages.

“Don’t tell me you alone taught them how to build their dao foundation.” The king had a strange smile on his face.

“Yes, Master, it’s not my doing alone. Young Master was the one who taught them this.” Fuyou replied.

He couldn’t hide anything from his master because the latter watched him grow up.

“Young Master?” The king had a strange expression.

“Yes, Young Master Li Qiye. I have taught them for several years but the good result was due to his little guidance.”

“I know you well.” The king walked slowly while speaking: “Everyone considers you as all brawl and no brain. I know this is not the case, and that you actually have an air of arrogance in your personality. Very few can truly win you over.”

“Yes, Young Master saved me and granted me another opportunity. He had fixed my problem.” Fuyou nodded and respectfully said.

“Did you just say that your dao problem is fixed by him?” The mountain king stopped pacing and stared at his disciple.

His astonishment was justified since he spent ample effort to try and fix it. The guy was his proudest disciple but his methods were useless. He had no choice but to give up.

Now, a junior like Li Qiye managed to do so? This was a shock tantamount to the lighting of the thirteen sections.

“Yes, it is thanks to the young master.” Fuyou truthfully answered. He wouldn’t have divulged this secret if his master wasn’t the person he trusted the most.

“I see.” The king didn’t know what to think.

It was one thing if a hidden master was the one behind this but Li Qiye was a Mortal Shell cultivator on top of using ordinary spirit grass.

To have such effectiveness with common materials - that made the whole thing even more unbelievable.

“I didn’t report this to you because of how sensitive it is.” Fuyou said.

“You’re not a child so you can have your secrets and privacy. Plus, I’ve taught you to be loyal.” The king waved his hand.

“Thank you, Master.” Fuyou bowed slightly, always having respected his master’s tolerance.

“This Li Qiye...” The mountain king mused before continuing: “How strange, it doesn’t make any sense. What do you know about him? Where is he from?”

“I don’t know.” Fuyou retold the story of their meeting.

The mountain found the whole thing weirder. This hidden master was actually a mortal?

“Strange indeed.” He couldn’t come up with an explanation.

“Are you worrying about something else? Like he is a spy from Three Truths?” Fuyou didn’t suspect Li Qiye but he thought that his master could.

“No.” The king shook his head: “Any sect would highly value and groom such an amazing seed, no way they would send him away as a spy. That’s the same as throwing a meat bun to hurt a dog. It’s just that we can’t make head or tail out of it right now.”

Fuyou smiled wryly. He had tried to think about the potential scenarios but couldn’t come up with a good answer so he eventually stopped.

“If you’re right, then he’s unfathomable. I don’t think he wishes to enter our sect as an ordinary disciple in that case.” The king said.

“What do you mean?” Fuyou became worried.

“It’s nothing, just keep watching. It’s fine for our sect to have a supreme genius, no? We’ll get our answer one day.” The king smiled and shook his head.

Fuyou was worried that the sect might conspire against Li Qiye out of suspicion.

“I will keep this a secret for you.” The king said: “I won’t report this to the sect master or the other peak lords. Hmm, all in all, just be careful. Don’t let anyone take advantage of this and use it against you because I might not be able to protect you if something big happens.”

“I understand and will exercise prudence.” Fuyou nodded. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s different now.” The king sighed: “Demons are in charge of three peaks out of the five. Our Eight Zhang can’t clap as loudly as before. If only Su Xu is still around...”

Fuyou became sentimental. He was closest to Su Xu among his own generation.

“What about the sect master?” He asked softly.

The leaders in charge of the humans were the mountain king and the sect master, Ping Suoweng of South Conch Peak.

“The sect master needs to be impartial.” The king shook his head: “In recent years, he rarely came down from South Conch nor participated in mundane affairs.”

“What is his intention?” Fuyou didn’t get it. He remembered that the sect master has always been diligent with his work.

“We can’t guess what he’s thinking. Or maybe he has higher aspirations since he has become a saint for many years now.” The king said.

“A Heavenly Sovereign?” Fuyou was shaken.

Suoweng was the only person at the Grand Dao Sacred Physique realm in their sect. This made him the strongest here.

The next step would be the legendary Heavenly Sovereign level. However, it has been a long time since their sect had one.

A successful breakthrough would have immense significance for the sect. His status as the sect master would be untouchable then.

“Maybe.” The king wasn’t sure: “But if your problem is cured, you will have to shoulder heavy responsibilities later. I can rest easy now that Eight Zhang has a successor.”

This branch has been lacking a potential new leader ever since Fuyou left.
