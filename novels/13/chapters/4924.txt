Chapter 4925: Expulsion

In the last thousand years, top masters have traveled to Abroad for dao study. They were stronger than Yue Shanjian but still called him “First Brother”.

This wasn’t due to his age but rather, his responsibility and duty in Abroad. 

“Clank!” The young monarch’s aura couldn’t get through the unbreakable sword dao.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Sword hymns could be heard and it actually pushed back the light.

“First Brother.” The young monarch’s expression soured.

Yue Shanjian waved his hand and said: “This ends here. Everyone, leave.”

“First Brother, letting thieves run rampant will diminish Abroad Hall’s prestige.” The young monarch didn’t want to give up.

He wisely ignored Deity’s action and focused on the “thieves” instead.

“Abroad is an educational institution for all, whether they be a saint or a villain. The everlasting prestige of Abroad won’t be ruined over this little matter.” Shanjian responded.

He spoke calmly but with confidence and stirred the crowd. This was indeed the truth since countless top masters had learned at Abroad before. 

The lengthy history naturally included heinous villains as well. However, did this ruin Abroad’s reputation and prestige? No, cultivators in the lower continents continued to join it.

This was the all-welcoming Abroad - something different from any sect or kingdom. No single cultivator would ever make it more famous or lessen its popularity.

Even if there were thieves and villains here in Abroad today, it simply made no difference.

“But First Brother, villains and thieves should be persecuted.” The young monarch still tried to take the moral high ground.

“Radiant Young Monarch.” Shanjian stared at him and said: “Deity must stop its operation right now in Abroad. This is my will and the academy’s. Pass this message to the ancestors.”

He got straight to the point instead of running around in a circle with the young genius. Plus, the academy didn’t give anyone face regardless of their background and backing.

“First Brother, do you wish to protect the thieves?” The young monarch asked.

“If you are unsatisfied with anything, you may leave Abroad. The academy does not restrict students from doing what they want but also does not welcome troublemakers.” Shanjian responded, implying that expulsion might be the consequence.

This flustered the young monarch. Everyone immediately quieted down.

Entering Abroad was rather easy. Just a quick registration was all it took. The reason didn’t matter either; even beggars could come here to search for food.

Expulsion simply wasn’t a thing in history. After all, if people hated it here, they could just leave. In a sense, being expelled would be extraordinarily rare - potentially unprecedented - and humiliating. Everyone in the lower continents would hear of this and laugh at them.

Rumors might be spread as well regarding the circumstances, true or not. Since heinous villains had gone here without being kicked out, what would one have to do to suffer this punishment? 

Therefore, the young monarch didn’t want the infamy. This humiliation would follow him for a lifetime.

His friends, Swordgrasp and Halo, didn’t interfere either. Their background didn’t matter since even Conceal Conqueror obeyed the rules here.

In the end, the young monarch scowled once before leaving. Throwing out fierce words was useless because the academy has shown its stance, not allowing Deity to continue its search.

“This matter is over, disperse.” Shanjian told the crowd and then left.

Both factions bowed in his direction since they knew that he was only carrying out his duty. He had never shown favoritism to either side before.

The crowd dispersed, leaving Li Qiye and the others behind.

“Young Noble, we protected you just now, isn’t this a big contribution? If you have anything nice, you should share it with us.” Ming Shi winked at him.

“Big contribution? No, this is how it should be. If The People do not show solidarity, they deserve to be bullied by The Race.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“You’re right, Young Noble.” Yunyun responded.

At the start, if students from The People had shown enough courage and solidarity to stop Deity’s search, this wouldn’t have happened in the first place.

“How stingy.” Ming Shi murmured in a cute manner.

As the conversation continued, a girl with a scattering of freckles on her face approached. Though her attire was unassuming and her features were unremarkable, her eyes were striking as she fixed her gaze on Li Qiye.
