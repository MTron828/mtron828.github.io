Chapter 5333: The Three Illusory Realms

Boundless was the largest ocean in Duality World. Rumor has it that it was created by several conquerors and dao lords working together.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Another account stated that only Apricot Dao Lord alone was the creator since the dao lord’s grotto was also there. However, this was highly contested by another side stating that this was only the entrance to the grotto. Thus, the dao lord wasn’t the one who created it.

Once the group entered the ocean, they also saw Apricot Grotto from afar - a crescent gulf with white sand. It was as if a moon had fallen into this ocean.

There existed an apricot tree in the center with flowers in full bloom. It had grown for so many years so its barks resembled dragon scales.

As the sea breezes blew by, petals scattered to the white sand and the blue water - a truly magnificent scene straight out of an eternal painting.

“Apricot Grotto is absolutely one of the most beautiful places in the world. The flowers here never wither.” Li Zhitian commented.

“If they wither, it would mean that she has passed away.” The old servant said.

“I’ve heard that Apricot Dao Lord is seriously injured, is it true?” Zhitian asked.

“Yes.” The old servant responded.

“The dao lord tried to infiltrate the depth of Dream Paradise and was repelled, right?” Zhitian asked again but garnered no response this time.

Apricot Dao Lord was an apex cultivator. Some even said that she was stronger than All-things and Swordsea Dao Lord.

She has been absent for a long time because back during her prime, she tried to invade the deepest region of Dream Paradise. This resulted in her being grievously wounded, or so people said.

Despite these rumors, no one dared to disrespect Apricot Grotto, not even other apex cultivators.

“If she is still alive, Dream Paradise exercised mercy.” Li Qiye commented.

“It’s that strong?” Zhitian became startled.

The world didn’t know much about the three illusory realms. Only those living back during the great calamity saw their emergence.

“It can contain worlds, killing a conqueror or dao lord is too easy.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

He pondered for a moment before asking again, this time in a hushed voice: “I heard they came from above. Is it the same place as the guest in Celestial Court?”

Few talked about the “guest” in Celestial Court because this was a taboo matter. However, Zhitian couldn’t help but ask Li Qiye due to his curiosity. Li Qiye might actually know the answer.

“Not from the same place.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Above, yes, but here with different goals.”

“What kind of existence is this guest?” Zhitian was far more curious about this being than the illusory realms.

After all, his clan was a pillar of Celestial Court and knew more about it than most powers and big shots. Alas, this issue was a forbidden topic.

“From a place that shouldn’t exist.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “The very frontier.”

“The very frontier?” Zhitian hasn’t heard anything like this before.

“Came with a goal indeed.” The old servant remarked.

“What kind of goal?” Zhitian asked again only to smile wryly at a lack of answer.

“Of course there was a goal, hence the reckless journey to this place.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Do you know why?” Zhitian asked.

Li Qiye shook his head and gazed into the distance. The mysterious guest didn’t belong to this world or this epoch. What was worth taking the potentially fatal journey?

“Already killed by the empress and the alliance, no one will know the answer now.” The old servant said.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t discuss this matter.

They walked on top of the waves and eventually found Goldsheep Conqueror sitting on top of a large reef.

The current here was violent, on the verge of forming a whirlpool. The conqueror was with three peers; the group was drinking and chatting. They saw and welcomed Li Qiye’s group.

These four conquerors had unique characteristics. One had a pair of golden curved horns, needing no introduction - Goldsheep Conqueror.

Another had sounds of waves emanating from him as if there was an ocean within.

“This is Waterwalk Conqueror from Hundred Dao.” Goldsheep introduced.

The third had a verdant energy, looking young and brimming with energy.

“Greenvine Conqueror, from Deity Dao.”

The fourth had an ethereal presence, seemingly made from mist and clouds.

“Godmist Conqueror of Heaven Burial Dao.”

Godmist laughed and said: “I don’t think Heaven Burial Dao exists anymore, I am alone now.”

“Are you not going to Celestial Court to find your progenitor, Heaven Burial Conqueror?” Waterwalk Conqueror asked.

“No, I might be a heavener but I don’t care about these bothersome matters.” Godmist shook his head.

“We came from the lower continents and have problems with each other. But, this has nothing to do with our races.” Greenvine said.

“Problems? We were just young and hated each other, that’s all.” Goldsheep laughed.

“Well, we’re done drinking, let’s get the life betting going. Fellow Daoists, it’s nice that you all are here to witness it, unlike the last time.” Waterwalk smiled.
