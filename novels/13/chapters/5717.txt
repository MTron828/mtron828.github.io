Chapter 5718: There Is More Than Just One Overlord

Spectators didn’t think the flesh could stand up to the chilling metal and might of the giant. Emperors would have been reduced to a bloody mist.

However, Li Qiye merely raised his hand and stopped the smash without activating his power or relying on a mighty merit law. The simple act could seal all powers and affinities in this world.

After witnessing this, everyone felt something absurd - that this block was expected and how it should have gone. What was illogical in any other circumstances became perfectly normal when Li Qiye was involved.

The absurd situation overwhelmed spectators at first but eventually, calmness returned. This was how it should be, perfectly reasonable.

“Boom!” Li Qiye strengthened his grip on the machine’s hands.

His body was but a speck of dust compared to the giant. Thus, this resembled a mosquito trying to push a mountain range. How could this ever be done?

Alas, the machine somehow was raised into the air. The apex cultivators lost control of their formation and stability.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” Li Qiye smashed it repeatedly against the seabed. The cascading water was propelled into the air again and engulfed the stars.

The mountains on the seabed were flattened by his relentless smashing. The existing cracks became larger, turning into craters.

This scene was shocking yet absurdly humorous due to the disproportionate size of Li Qiye and the machine.

It looked as if the machine had gone mad and was smashing itself against the ground with Li Qiye as the pivot point. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Bam!” With one final bang, the machine lay there on the seabed. The returning water didn’t come close to submerging it.

Spectators observed the machine in a daze, paying particular attention to the countless cracks with short-circuiting electrical sparks emanating from them. This looked like a wounded combatant on the verge of death.

Jaws dropped to the ground and eyes widened after the fact. Just a while ago, the machine was unstoppable to the point of enduring the arrows from Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation.

It seized the upper hand even after Demon Conqueror and the others combined the primordial trees. How could it be so helpless against Li Qiye, looking like a fish on the chopping board?

“Is this beyond the limit?” Emperors and monarchs shuddered in horror.

“A legendary overlord?” Conquerors and dao lords turned pale.

For regular cultivators, the imperial level represented the apex of the world. However, actual top cultivators understood that this wasn’t the case after getting far enough.

This was especially true for apex cultivators who knew that this was only the beginning. Above them were Ancestors and Overlords. They had to break the dao limit to reach the next level.

The machine created by a supreme art of a lost epoch certainly reached the ancestral level, power-wise.

Since Li Qiye defeated it so easily - this gave everyone a good gauge of his current cultivation. He had surpassed the dao limit and all of them.

“The end of the grand dao, an overlord, isn’t he unbeatable now?” A new conqueror murmured.

“There is more than just one overlord.” An ancient emperor responded with a serious expression.

All in all, they were in awe after realizing Li Qiye’s true power. They wanted to do the same - break the limit and turn into an overlord.
