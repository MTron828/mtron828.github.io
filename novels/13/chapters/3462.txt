“Boom!” Many shook back and forth from the impact of Li Qiye hitting the sword and draconic punch.

“Thump! Thump! Thump!” The godchild and the first prince were pushed backward; their vitality churning from the force.

Both of them became startled, having far underestimated their opponent.

“So strong, isn’t he just a Silver Carapace?” Most were in disbelief.

“It must be the power of the phoenix trueflame.” Another murmured.

“That has to be it.” They saw his hand covered in lava. It seemed to be encompassing a limitless weight, hence his ability to repel his foes.

“Just a useless bunch.” Li Qiye stood there, staring at them and chuckling: “All of you, come.”

He clearly wanted everyone on the other side to come together, not just these two.

“We’ll see about that!” The easily-agitated godchild roared.

“Boom!” A majestic brilliance and strands of dao light emanated from him.

He looked like a supreme dao blooming outward, capable of controlling all things under heaven. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Inborn Dao Physique!” Many shouted in response.

“Indeed, an incredible gift.” An older expert confirmed in astonishment.

The activation of this physique made his vitality several times greater.

“Clank!” He summoned a thick and large sword, black from top to bottom. It looked like a bone with a golden streak. This streak was there with the sword material from the very beginning, not added later.

“Buzz.” The sword glowed black and released a visual phenomenon - a massive beast with four legs and a horn. It had black scales all over but the horn was golden, seemingly made from an ancient immortal metal.

“Raa!” The beast heralded a bestial aura. Its ferocity made others shudder.

“Primal Onyx Lynx!” The older experts recognized the beast.

“That sword is a high-level heaven sword.” Someone knew enough about Firmaments to recognize the sword.

“The previous sect master of Firmaments used it.” Another person said with envy.

“It’s made from the dao bone of a Primal Onyx Lynx.” People felt both its bestial aura and grand dao power.

This was one of the strongest swords in Firmaments. Their Heavenly Sovereign was fortunate enough to obtain an expensive dao bone from an ancient lynx. The outcome was a sword possessing this beast’s power and dao.

The previous sect master gave it to the godchild not long after he joined the sect because he had an inborn dao physique. He became its successor later.

This dao physique allowed him to control weapons without any limitation even at the Mortal Shell realm, perhaps the best advantage to having it.

“Boom!” Visual phenomena manifested behind him - a rotating sun, moon, and the stars. He seemed to be the ruler of an entire realm.

“Firmaments Art.” An expert became startled: “He really managed to finish it. That’s the future sect master for you.”

Using Firmaments Art boosted the godchild’s power several magnitudes higher.

Inborn Dao Physique, Primal Onyx Lynx Sword, and Firmaments Art - these three things took the godchild to the next level.

He clearly used everything he got to kill Li Qiye in order to wash away the humiliation earlier.

“Count me in!” The first prince didn’t want to miss out and shouted.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Individual plates attached themselves to him, forming a full golden armor. He looked like a king ready to speak to his subjects. Their lives were up to a single whim of his.

“Skylight Draconic Bulwark!” A spectator recognized the armor and said: “The king gave it to the first prince.”

According to the legends, this armor was made from the scale of a mature flood-dragon, allowing its user to be impervious to weapons and elemental attacks. It belonged to the king. It seemed that it was passed down to the first prince, meaning that he would be the next in line.

“Boom!” He then channeled his merit law. A royal energy rushed up to the sky. Numerous regal signs gathered around him, culminating in the image of a great kingdom.

Within it, his followers and citizens prostrated and offered him all of their power and vitality. This naturally took him to the next level. He turned into a peerless king, capable of sealing gods and slaying devils.

People couldn’t help but stare in admiration.

“Regal Draconic Secret.” The crowd knew that this was the secret technique of Skylight. Only the royal family was allowed to learn it.

The two surrounded Li Qiye, intending to kill him with their best techniques.

“They’re not messing around anymore, it’ll be to the death.” One spectator murmured.

Everyone watched with bated breath, wanting to see the duo take down Li Qiye.

“I can’t be missing this.” Wu Zhongtian suddenly joined the fray with a serious tone.

He didn’t care about his status and reputation, joining the other two. This showed that he viewed Li Qiye as a mighty foe.

By this point, most realized that Li Qiye was far more powerful than he let on. Otherwise, Wu Zhongtian would never join others to take him on.

“It’s starting.” The atmosphere became excited.

Wu Zhongtian was an incredible genius. If it wasn’t for the brilliant Bai Jianchan, he might have been the next successor of Yin Yang Gate.

To be able to see him in action was a blessing for the spectators.

“Buzz.” The yin and yang emerged behind him. His shadow became long and stretched across the realm, the same with his actual figure. Just one stomp could crush the land.

“An avatar, he’s in the Myriad-form Sanctity realm.” His current cultivation realm became obvious.
