Chapter 5513: Bare Surface

This left Shaoyun in an awkward predicament. A four-fruit dragon lord like himself should have enough influence in the valley. Moreover, shouldn’t his junior sisters give him some face?

“Junior Sister, we can’t possibly let this happen, an outsider researching the sect’s secret.” Mu Shaoyun said.

“Senior Brother, Sunset Peak is in need of a powerful guard, you should go right now.” The goddess lost her patience.

Shaoyun scowled but preferred this development. At the very least, she gave him a chance to back off while saving face. However, he didn’t want to leave because that would be admitting defeat to this outsider.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, didn’t care about the mess. He closed his eyes and basked in the aura of this place - it truly reminded him of the nine worlds.

He took another sip of tea while enjoying the breeze. This caused the goddess to say: “Young Noble, we’ll get you some more barley tea.”

She ordered someone to bring more of this type and personally prepared a pot for him.

“Young Noble, you seem to enjoy the manor.” Qin Baifeng said.

“It’s a good place.” Li Qiye responded.

“Could you be more exact?” The goddess asked while feeding him more peanuts.

“It evokes memories and warms the heart.” He said.

“You have other memories regarding our sect?” The goddess asked.

Li Qiye didn’t respond.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“The warming effect comes from Sunset Glow Scripture. Our ancestor built a dao foundation here with a warmth capable of reaching the heart.” Qin Baifeng said.

“Seems like you have a decent understanding of the scripture.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re too kind, I know nothing compared to our ancestor.” Qin Baifeng said.

As a dragon lord, she had her own dao. However, Sunset Glow had gestated their dao heart since youth. Thus, they continued to use Sunset Glow to nurture their mind and any dao within.

All members of Sunset Glow naturally attempted to learn the scripture, albeit with varying success.

“Yes, you have a long way to go. Not to mention your ancestor, you have a considerable gap compared to your senior sister.” Li Qiye nodded.

This surprised Qin Baifeng since their cultivation was equal. Of course, she was curious, not jealous.

“Junior Sister’s sword dao is impressive, I have only revised Sunset Glow Scripture, nothing more.” The goddess said humbly.

“You are the only one who has inherited your ancestor’s legacy with a focus on the dao heart. The others only saw the bare surface, nothing profound.” Li Qiye commented.

Listeners outside exchanged glances. Sunset Glow Scripture was a required mental mantra upon joining. They had access to imperial merit laws as well but nothing was as familiar to them as the mantra. Thus, they didn’t take his criticism kindly.

“Sure, we’re not as good as the senior sisters but we’ve definitely finished the mantra.” One female disciple complained.

Some of them had spent decades learning this, so for an outsider to criticize them was unacceptable. How could he possibly know more about it than they do?

“Ridiculous and nonsensical.” Mu Shaoyun finally spoke again: “We have become dragon lords after learning it, you do not understand the profundity within the scripture, watch your mouth now.”

Li Qiye finally paid attention to him and said: “I would argue that you have yet to learn it at all given your personality and morality. You should be ashamed for claiming otherwise.”

Shaoyun couldn’t take this criticism in stride, especially when it was in a public setting.

“Ignorant junior!” The dragon lord lost his cool and activated his aura: “How dare you criticize the members of Sunset Glow and incite confusion? What is your intention here?!”

“Does he really understand our scripture?” The others were skeptical since they believed in their accomplishments with the scripture.

“Senior Brother, choose your words wisely. The young noble is an esteemed guest.” The goddess said calmly.

This only infuriated Shaoyun and made him more jealous.

“Junior Sister, I am not being disrespectful. It is ludicrous for an outsider to be arrogant enough to comment on our legacy. He’s the one disrespecting the sect and all of us.” Shaoyun stood proudly and said.

“We all started learning the scripture after joining the sect, some for decades now. Sisters and brothers, how can an outsider understand the scripture more than we do?” He riled up the crowd.
