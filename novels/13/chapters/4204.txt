Chapter 4205: Pick A Side

The saint child has become the sacred lord of Nine-wheel Citadel recently. Thus, people haven’t gotten accustomed to switching his title.

He was actually younger than Peace Ocean Sword King as well. Some believed that his talent was either on par or only slightly inferior to the king. Once he reached the king’s age, his power and cultivation should be equal.

He was closer in age to the Ten Sword Prodigies yet his status and cultivation exceeded theirs considerably. This showed how dominating he has been in the cultivation world.

He looked like a deity due to his golden radiance. He possessed a more spirited temperament and wasn’t as low-key as Peace Ocean Sword King. Of course, he was qualified to be as haughty and pompous as he wanted.

“If you wish to fight, Valley Lord, I will overestimate myself and spar with you for three hundred moves.” He spoke as if he was untouchable and viewed others with disdain.

Others preferred Peace Ocean Sword King’s more mature and refined demeanor. The king spoke with civility and wasn’t as aggressive as the saint child.

Nonetheless, they did understand why the latter was acting in this manner. He had everything that a man could want. Thus, arrogance and pride couldn’t be avoided for someone so young.

“So be it, Saint Child.” The valley lord smiled.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Spectators still thought that Nine-wheel and Sea Emperor had the upper hand. Daoist Sword Ground and Flame Valley weren’t enough to touch this alliance yet.

“I like how straightforward you are, Valley Lord.” The saint child laughed then gazed at the crowd: “Anyone else wants to challenge us? Step forward then, we welcome all challengers.”

Everyone took a deep breath and exchanged glances. It was clear at the start that in order to get to the divine sword, one must get through the two behemoths.

The appearance of Peace Ocean Sword King emphasized this even though he purposely avoided stating this outright. This wasn’t the case for Void Saint Child. He had no qualm revealing their objective.

Unfortunately, his honesty wasn’t well-received by the crowd. His ally, Peace Ocean, slightly frowned after hearing this but didn’t correct his ally.

“What can we do?” One expert quietly said.

The chance of victory was zero, at least given the current situation. Thus, they wisely held their words back despite feeling frustrated.

“Saint Child, if you want everyone to pick a side, then we, Armament Mountain, will stand with Daoist Sword Ground and Flame Valley.” A pleasant voice came before an elegant figure appeared in the sky. Her presence was accompanied by a sweet fragrance.

“Sect Master Shi!” Others recognized her right away - Shi Yingxue, one of the Six Kings.

“You’re the same as always, Sect Master Shi, not backing down to anyone.” Void didn’t mind this development and said: “But even if your three sects work together, what do you think is your chance of victory?”

“Leave it up for heaven to decide.” She answered. Listening to her was a pleasurable experience.

“It’s not like we wish to go against the world. There’s a reason behind all of this. Will you yield just once, Fellow Daoists?” Peace Ocean coughed and interjected, choosing to go the tactful route instead.

“Then why don’t you yield? Put down the wall and sword formation!” A crowd member shouted.

“That’s right, there is no reason capable of justifying this. It’s mere greed!” Others started joining in, willing to run their mouth instead of swinging their swords.

“Hmph, we’re already showing comity by not expelling all of you from this region!” Void didn’t appreciate the accusative barrages.

Peace Ocean felt the same way but wasn’t as direct.

“Fellow Daoist, you’re awfully overbearing.” A newcomer came; his radiance was blinding.

“Nine-sun Sword Saint!” Applauses and cheers erupted.

“He’s here!” His appearance excited the crowd and gave them hope.

His influence was far above Ling Jian, Flame Valley Lord, and Shi Yingxue. Since he was the leader of the Six Kings, he should be stronger than the rest.

“Support the sword saint! We can’t let them do as they please!” The crowd was rowdier than before.

Peace Ocean Sword King’s expression soured after seeing this. He wasn’t afraid of anyone or any sect since Sea Emperor was the strongest. However, he didn’t wish for the situation to escalate - it would be quite bothersome.

“It is an honor to be in your presence, Sword Saint. It would also be this junior’s pleasure to have the chance to fight you.” Void said proudly. Putting his arrogance aside, some did appreciate his straightforward nature.

“The young generation will surpass us in time, I am already inferior.” The saint shook his head then said: “This is still salvageable as long as your sects are willing to remove the blockade. No one will start a fight then.”
