Chapter 5364: Please Return Home

It would be a mistake to attribute Eternal Conqueror’s greatness to his bloodline alone. After all, there were other cultivators with noble bloodlines in the past but not all made it to his level.

Gauging his power in the upper continents was a challenge since he could actually fight the top masters in the immortal continent.

His appearance captivated everyone, leaving them breathless. The other famous conquerors and dao lords had a long way to go before catching up to him.

Lightgrasp, Myriad Eye, Five-sun, Jue Xian’er, and Ferocity stared intensely at the man standing nonchalantly above without exerting any pressure.

They wondered if they could actually take the dreamwater from this mighty being. A sense of curiosity about his actual power overwhelmed them. The crowd felt the same way.

He was the perfect model for how a conqueror should be - calm and dignified, respected without needing to be pretentious and arrogant.

Regular cultivators had no choice but to respect masters capable of destroying mountains and oceans. Their very pressure forced others down to the ground.

Eternal Conqueror didn’t need to do so. His aura, or lack thereof, was comforting. It wasn’t a torturous event to be in his presence.

“He’s special.” Myriad Eye sighed and said with admiration.

“Only All-things have a similar aura.” Five-sun commented.

“Friends, please return home.” Eternal could take the dreamwater away but still politely told everyone. Every word carried a dao rhythm, creating a soothing and pleasant tone.

Spectators started wondering if the other combatants would actually listen or try to fight him.

With the exception of Jue Xian’er, the other four exchanged glances once before shifting their focus back on Eternal. They didn’t bother looking at the dreamwater this time.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Eternal was an apex conqueror on a similar level to Immortal Pagoda Conqueror. They wanted to know how strong he was and this intent could be seen by all.

“Do you wish to fight?” Eternal asked.

“Your illustrious reputation precedes you. Though we’ll be overestimating ourselves, we still desire to witness your eternal dao.” Five-sun Dao Lord laughed and declared.

This challenge had nothing to do with factions and alliances, not racial prejudices either. Five-sun himself was a member of Divine Alliance yet he wanted to team up with the others. Through Eternal Conqueror, they would be able to get a closer look at the immensity of the dao.

Not only was he an apex conqueror, but he also possessed one of the four ancient bloodlines - Divine Eternal.

The Race had three main branches - heaveners, diviners, and devils. Those hailing from these races were proud of their history and legacy, especially the so-called immortal bloodlines. They believed they were the chosen ones and should rule.

The People disagreed and claimed that a fourth bloodline existed for the humans.

Therefore, there were four immortal bloodlines in total - Heaven Authority, Divine Eternal, Devil Bestowment, and Human Monarch.

Now, the crowd was fortunate enough to be in the presence of a bloodline bearer - Eternal Conqueror with the Divine Eternal branch.

His challengers understood that this bloodline would grant Eternal a ridiculous advantage on the battlefield, not counting his impressive cultivation. This only made them want to try even more.

“We have no grievances with each other but if everyone is interested in doing so, I will entertain you.” Eternal’s words were as pleasant as the gentle spring breezes.

As the saying goes - the classics are never outdated. Eternal was a prime example - a legendary work of literature that one could read a thousand times, only finding more to appreciate each subsequent attempt.

“Very well, let us settle this with one move.” Myriad Eye Dao Lord suggested.

“Witnessing your ability will make this trip worthwhile.” Ferocity was actually polite to Eternal Conqueror.

“So be it, please proceed, I am ready for your one attack.” Eternal accepted.

The agreement stirred the crowd; their eyes widened with excitement.
