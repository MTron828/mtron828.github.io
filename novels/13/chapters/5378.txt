The sword formation was empowered by the three leaders and their fellow alliance members. An ocean of swords manifested into reality and pulled everyone within. The machine became a battlefield of death, capable of grinding the victims to death countless times.

The most crucial part was that it embedded itself into time and space, preventing anyone from escaping. Large figures appeared in the sky - the original blessers and creators of the formation. Thus, anyone trapped within had to face their combined assault.

“Why Heavenslay? It won’t discriminate between friends and foes.” Someone commented.

This formation was created a long time ago in order to combat The Race. Heaven here implied Heaven Alliance, not the villainous heaven.

Its creation was Illumination Conqueror’s idea during his golden age. Top cultivators including Swordsea and All-things Dao Lord participated.

Whenever it was used, blood would flow like the river. Killing dao lords and conquerors was not difficult in the slightest.

Its goal was to destroy Heaven Alliance and suppress The Race, allowing The People to have a strong foothold over the upper continents.

Unfortunately, it was used only a few times before Emperors War started, resulting in Dao Alliance crumbling down. It seemed that Illumination had taken it with him and now, it was the perfect time to use it.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Swords descended from above, aiming for Ye Fantian and the others.

Weaker combatants didn’t last a single second. They started screaming while being dismembered.

“Fuck you all! Son of bitches!” Myriad Eye was furious while blocking the swords.

Meanwhile, spectators had a hard time watching, especially those from The People. The sword formation was meant to be used against Heaven Alliance. Now, it was killing high-ranking members of The People.

“Azure School has crossed the line.” A big shot said indignantly.

“Illumination must be insane now.” One conqueror uttered coldly.

“This is not a recent thing, he went insane long ago.” A dragon lord said, believing that if Illumination had a sliver of love for The People, he wouldn’t have persecuted allies and started Emperors War.

His imperious nature was no different from Celestial Court and alienated All-things and Swordsea Dao Lord. After all, these prestigious men weren’t used to being ordered around, and absolutely not by a murderous madman.

Azure School intended to kill Ye Fantian and the enemies on top of Myriad Eye Conqueror’s group. The latter were allies of All-things Dao Lord so this was killing two birds with one stone.

“Ahh!” One dragon lord and conqueror went down after another. Their flesh and bones rained downward.

At this crucial moment, Ye Fantian suddenly shouted: “We’re retreating!”

Her twelve runes turned into twelve dao fruits and a blinding radiance erupted.

“She did it!” Spectators outside the formation shouted in astonishment.

“No one can compare to her in this generation.” Someone else murmured.

She had been underestimated due to her stagnation compared to the other Tians. Some speculated that she might never become a conqueror.

Today, she proved her talent to everyone and surpassed Li Zhitian and Xiao Qingtian.
