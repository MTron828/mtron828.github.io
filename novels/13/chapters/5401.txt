Chapter 5402: Illumination Is Dead For Sure

He asked for Li Qiye to stick around but the latter moved onward with his group.

“All-things Dao Lord will finally mobilize against Illumination Conqueror?” Xiao Hu asked curiously along the way.

His master had aimed to gather other dao lords and conquerors to kill Illumination Conqueror. However, it appeared that All-things Dao Lord has a good opportunity to do so right now.

“It has already begun.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Really?” Xiao Hu was surprised to hear this since Dao Alliance didn’t mobilize when he was still there.

“All-things Dao Lord is using a borrowed knife.” Ferocity said: “That’s the only reason for gathering at that palace, baiting out Illumination and Azure School. He then planned for Ye Fantian to be taken by Illumination, what do you think Heaven and Divine Alliance will do now when they know about the living sacrifice ceremony? Nonetheless, Illumination cannot stop himself.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“He cannot handle their offense, right?” Xiao Hu said.

“He has gone insane and stubborn, willing to pay any price for his goal. Sacrificing Ye Fantian is his way to bolster his reputation and rise again.” Ferocity said.

“He’s crazy.” Xiao Hu murmured. He hated Supreme before but now, he thought that Supreme was still more tolerable in comparison.

“Of course, have you seen a well-adjusted mass murderer before? This goes beyond vengeance since he wants a full extermination of The Race including the mortals.” Ferocity sneered.

Xiao Hu agreed because although top cultivators had massacred mortals before, it was often an unwanted result of wars and battles.

Purposely wanting to exterminate mortals was virtually unheard of. Of course, cultivators viewed mortals as inferior and insignificant. They just didn’t have a reason to kill.

“He was relatively normal before, this might be the last stage of his illness.” Li Xian’er added.

“He desperately wants to be a savior.” Ferocity said: “First, he claimed to be the guardian of The People, now, he’s taking it to the next step, killing anyone who opposes The People.”

“To be more exact, anyone who opposes him.” Li Qiye smiled.

“No different from Celestial Court at all.” Xiao Hu commented.

Ferocity laughed and patted the youth’s shoulder: “There’s a difference. The bastards in Celestial Court wouldn’t give a second glance to a passing mortal. They want to kill the emperors and dao lords of The People, not the mortals. It would be a bloodbath otherwise.”

Xiao Hu thought about it and agreed again. Celestial Court had started several wars but only maneuvered against the opposition - not mortals from the other races.

At first glance, Illumination would appear to be the hero of The People. Alas, he ended up ruining his reputation to those privy to more information.

“His path only leads to death, the question is, who will be delivering the finishing blow?” Ferocity sneered: “All-things doesn’t want the infamy so he’s letting others do it instead.”

“Right, Heaven and Divine Alliance want to save Ye Fantian.” Xiao Hu said.

“They’ll want to do more than that since they’re not as nice as you. And now, All-things is injured so he can’t help at all. It won’t be his responsibility for just watching on the sideline. This was his plan with Ye Fantian from the very start.” Ferocity elaborated.

“But will Supreme and the others bite?” Xiao Hu asked.

“They also want to kill Illumination. After all, if you have two choices for your enemies, would you prefer All-things or Illumination?” Ferocity asked.

“All-things Dao Lord.” Xiao Hu answered.

“See, at least All-things isn’t a madman wanting to massacre everyone. Illumination is already insane at this point, imagine how he’ll be once pushed to the brink. They can’t afford to let him be in charge of Dao Alliance.” Ferocity said.

“Right.” Xiao Hu agreed.

“They all know that All-things is using them to kill Illumination. Nonetheless, they are happy to do so.” Ferocity said.

“Seems a little sad for Illumination Conqueror, he’s being abandoned by everyone.” Xiao Hu said.

“You’re only saying this because you didn’t experience Emperors War.” Ferocity laughed: “If it wasn’t for Puresun Dao Lord presiding over the matter, who knows what Illumination would have done? I’m sure he wouldn’t have accepted his defeat so easily. He had no choice when Puresun Dao Lord’s blade was inches away from his throat. It wouldn’t just be him either, all of Azure School too.”

“Puresun Dao Lord wanted to kill everyone?” Xiao Hu only heard bits and pieces from his master.

“In my opinion, Puresun Dao Lord is superior to All-things Dao Lord in this regard, he would have killed all of them if they chose to resist. All-things Dao Lord cares too much about his reputation and does nothing.” Ferocity shrugged.

“I understand now.” Xiao Hu responded.

“Yes, Illumination had no choice when Puresun Dao Lord was so much stronger than him. It’s a shame that he wasn’t more stubborn so the whole thing could end back then. With his death, they could have dealt with Heaven and Divine Alliance afterward instead of having this big mess now. Well, at least Illumination will die soon.” Ferocity said, eager to see more exciting battles.

“He has an ace card.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Do you know what it is?” Xiao Hu asked curiously.

“Well, it won’t change anything. He is doomed because of his madness.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, he would have been fine by just living reclusively. It’s a shame that he couldn’t give up.” Li Xian’er nodded.
