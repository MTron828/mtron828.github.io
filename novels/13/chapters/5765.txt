“Starting.” Li Qiye sighed while staring at Ling’er.

The star and the cloud circled her, wanting to see her condition as Li Qiye touched the rune.

“Zzz...” The star on her dimmed down.

“Boom!” An inferno resembling blood erupted from Ling’er, flowing toward the past, present, and future.

It aimed to engulf and overfill the world and its timelines, spreading from this expanse to the six continents and three thousand worlds.

The circle on her activated with a golden eruption, causing the coffin to shake violently. It rotated at an increasing pace, releasing more light in the process with the ability to dispel the blood flame.

Its power proliferated endlessly, surging like a tsunami and smashing against Ling’er. The circle was a unique seal created by a supreme existence for a single purpose.

“It’s starting.” Li Qiye smiled and walked toward the first Ling’er.

All of them sensed his presence and gazed in his direction. The gazes came from every inch of space, different dimensions, and timelines. Rays gushed forth and engulfed him instantly like countless red tsunamis.
