Chapter 4247: Boundless Vajra Palm

The loss of the first exchange was shameful for Sea Emperor. However, Vastsea and Earthraiser remained focused on the battle instead of pride.

As overlords, they naturally understood the power of that abyssal strike earlier. Thus, Li Qiye’s retaliation was even more impressive.

“Take this then!” Vastsea roared: “Abyss Heart Strike!”

This time around, his slash didn’t create a monstrous abyss. It was as gentle as the rain during spring, virtually imperceptible. His sword moved like a willow branch swaying to the wind.

It encompassed zero power and murderous intent.

“Buzz.” However, a smaller abyss appeared in front of Li Qiye’s chest - a truly fatal move that couldn’t be guarded.

Cultivators didn’t sense the attack’s power at first but now, they had the illusion of an abyss appearing in front of their chest as well. Life became feeble and insignificant. Both unknown juniors and mighty ancestors became helpless.

Countless bellowed in pain and became grievously wounded. The weaker ones spat out blood while the ancestors staggered several steps backward. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Though Li Qiye was the sole target, the dao and profundity of the technique still affected those nearby. They knew that if they were in Li Qiye’s shoes, they would instantly drop over and die.

On the other hand, Li Qiye didn’t think much of it and simply stabbed his sword forward, easily breaking the tiny abyss.

This time around, Vastsea was forced back after losing the second exchange.

“He nullified it again!” A composed spectator unharmed by the venerable’s attack shouted.

The first nullification could be chalked up to luck. But to do so again? This meant that Li Qiye knew just how to defeat the Abyss Sword Dao. He most likely saw numerous flaws and exploited them.

Everyone became shaken because these heavenly dao have dominated for eras. Only a selected few were capable enough to defeat them.

“Don’t forget, he has the actual scripture.” A king quietly said.

Many exchanged glances and thought that this was the only explanation.

“Don’t tell me he learned all nine already.” One youth said in disbelief.

“Maybe he doesn’t know how to use them, only how to defeat them after reading the scripture. He can see all the flaws and openings.” An expert mused.

“Does that mean heavenly sword dao from all the sects are useless against him? He just needs one swing to beat them?” Another cultivator asked.

While many were surprised, an old big shot realized something else and shook his head: “Knowing alone isn’t enough to do this…”

All in all, people stared at him with various emotions - envy, jealousy, fear, anxiety…

None knew that Li Qiye was the one who opened the new page. Who else could have a better grasp on their weakness than him?

“Displaying your slight skill before an expert.” He smiled.

Everyone thought that the venerable had never heard this insult before. Alas, how could anyone try to refute? Li Qiye easily stopped his attacks twice. He couldn’t be any more convincing.

The venerable grimaced. He had great confidence in the Abyss Sword Dao. Unfortunately, it simply didn’t work against Li Qiye.

Nonetheless, he didn’t become pessimistic just yet. He exchanged glances with his ally and instantly came up with a new plan.

“Amazing, the master of a heavenly scripture indeed.” The vajra said: “Looks like you have grasped its essences but I refuse to give up.”

He stepped forward and wanted to try after the failed scouting by the venerable. Though Li Qiye had Finality, the vajra’s techniques were from the six wheels and had nothing to do with it.

“Fellow Daoist, please give me pointers.” He spoke politely but would absolutely not show mercy.

“Go.” Li Qiye didn’t seem to worry.

“Excuse me then!” The vajra’s gaze suddenly became piercing to all the spectators. He delivered a palm strike powerful enough to crush space and time.

This instability surrounded Li Qiye and aimed to immobilize him. In the next second, his hand became resplendent as if it was made from gold.

Everyone felt that it wasn’t just his hand soaring alone. All the myriad dao and spatial fabrics were pushing forward as well.

“Boundless Vajra Palm!” An ancestor recognized the move and became emotional.
