Chapter 4242: Nobodies

When judging strictly by the number of sects, the alliance had the advantage since they were still viewed as the favorite.

Though Li Qiye had many powerful sects with him as well, they couldn’t quite compete with the two behemoths yet. Similarly enough, it was two overlords against one.

Of course, some remained to observe on the sideline. They believed that a neutral policy was the best route for survival. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“So everyone has made their choice.” Li Qiye smiled as his eyes swept through the crowd: “Finality is right here, come and get it.”

Li Qiye simplified the scenario - no need for further justifications. If they wanted the scripture, they just needed to wrest it from his hand.

Alas, no one wanted to be the first to attack. Li Qiye had numerous masters behind him so it had to be the two overlords first.

“Ahem.” Earthraiser coughed and said: “Fellow Daoist, we have no choice but to act on the side of justice since you insist on…”

“Enough of this unveracious crap.” Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted the guy: “Don’t you feel nauseous spewing these lies? I’m getting goosebumps.”

The members of Nine-wheel glared angrily after hearing the disdainful response.

“I suppose the time for civility is over.” The vajra was slightly annoyed despite his impressive mental control. Li Qiye had repeatedly offended him so even a statue would become angry at this point.

“Don’t blame us for not showing mercy since you won’t hand Finality over.” He continued.

“That depends on if you’re capable enough. Come, I need to exercise anyway.” Li Qiye stretched and smiled.

“Hmph! The arrogance! If it wasn’t for Everlasting Sword God and the others, he wouldn’t dare to oppose Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra!” A youth snorted.

“We’ll see soon enough.” An expert said gravely.

All eyes were on Li Qiye and the vajra. Everyone thought that though Li Qiye was mighty, there should be a limit due to his age. He had already proven his worth after killing Peace Ocean and Void. Alas, there should still be a way to go before reaching the overlord level.

Nonetheless, because of Li Qiye’s devilish abilities, some still believed that he had a chance.

“Why are you so sure of winning, Fellow Daoist?” The vajra’s eyes narrowed.

“Because killing you two will be as easy as pie.” Li Qiye said flatly.

The duo’s expression darkened after seeing this. They believed that they were the top dogs even when taking all of Eight Desolaces into account. Li Qiye might be the only one who would dare to make this claim.

It was humiliating to be spoken to with such disdain. The duo had a hard time restraining their anger at this point.

Their eyes turned cold and their murderous intent roamed free - chilling enough to freeze everything.

“You don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth, stop running your mouth!” One cultivator shouted.

“Ignorant fool, you’ll need a funeral soon enough.” A disciple from Nine-wheel shouted.

“We’ll never stop until we kill him.” An expert from Sea Emperor gritted his teeth.

On the other hand, the frustrated overlords maintained their composure.

“Very well, I will test your confidence with my old bones.” Earthraiser said.

The situation has escalated enough for them to drop the righteous angle. His arrogance justified their aggression.

Li Qiye smiled and said: “One by one is too boring, I prefer a lively crowd. Come together.”

“What?!” Everyone stared dumbfoundedly at him, speechless.

“H-he wants to fight both the venerable and the vajra at the same time? Ridiculous!” An expert blurted. Not even Everlasting Sword God would dare to do so.

“This is madness.” An ancestor on Li Qiye’s side took a deep breath.

His allies became alarmed, wondering if they should let Li Qiye do as he pleases.
