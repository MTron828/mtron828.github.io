Chapter 5598: Run

Dao City had fallen. Its defenders abandoned the battlefields and ran for Momentous Frontier.

Emperors and dragon lords didn’t find losing and running shameful, let alone regular cultivators. Dying was meaningless in this case. The honorable thing to do was to live and fight another day - a lesson from Immemorial Epoch War.

In the past, they had two options after losing. The first was Imperial West Bank due to its incredible defensive line.

It had enough resources and empowerment from its cultivators to withstand armies. Alas, this was not an option right now. If Imperial West Bank had defected to Celestial Court, they would be running into a trap.

The second option was Immortal Dao City but its closing was the source of the current predicament.

As for Imperial Field, it was too far to be an option for mass-scale withdrawal. They would be caught and killed by Celestial Court before finishing the journey.

Thus, City Lord Luminous Conqueror gave the order to retreat to Momentous Frontier - the world of the mortals despite historical precedents.

It had remained neutral in the wars between Immortal Dao City and Celestial Court. It didn’t allow any emperor to come with instigation and aggression in mind.

There existed a tacit understanding between the two sides - leave Momentous Frontier out of this. The mortal world had no value in the grand scheme of things. Why bother involving or killing ants during their conflict?

The powerful founders could certainly change the tides of the war. However, they have become deities and wouldn’t leave the frontier.

As Dao City’s inhabitants retreated to the Momentous Frontier, powerful cultivators tried to slow the invading armies down.

“Boom!” War God Dao Lord started losing as well. Just-once Dao Lord alone was a tough opponent, let alone other emperors and monarchs entering the battle.

Their joint attacks left bloody injuries and gashes on War God. He gathered his battle spirit once more before releasing for a full eruption.

“Boom!” He opened a path and immediately soared away.

“Until next time!” He shouted and disappeared into the horizon.

He had no shackles unlike Luminous and the others. As long as there was a chance to escape, he would certainly do so. This was an advantage in being all alone and untethered.

Capturing or killing an apex cultivator was easier said than done. It would take several of them to stop War God from running.

Meanwhile, the first waves of cultivators and ancestors have made it inside Momentous Frontier. The deities didn’t react as long as they knew how to behave properly.

Luminous and the others finally made it to the outskirts but didn’t enter, at least not without explicit permission from the deities. They were the main reasons for the war - the true targets of Celestial Court.

Celestial Court could spare weaker cultivators but not emperors and conquerors. If they were to go inside, Celestial Court might actually attack Momentous Frontier.

“Rumble!” The armies of Celestial Court gathered after taking over the majority of Dao City. The light of Celestial Court illuminated these territories.

Luminous and the others sighed after seeing this and could only watch.

“Rumble!” Eventually, the armies marched in the direction of Momentous Frontier. The auras of the commanders could crush three thousand worlds, enough to frighten the mortals inside Momentous Frontier.

The mortals didn’t know what to do after seeing so many cultivators in one day. Remember, cultivators were no different than immortals in their eyes.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
