Chapter 5194: Peerless Monarch

Resplendent Monarch found himself to be at a loss for words again.

Prior to this, he would be furious after hearing such an insulting comment regarding their sect’s defining treasure that has been able to trap conquerors.

This was the same as insulting their progenitor, Peerless Monarch, because she was the one who created it.

Alas, he couldn’t retort due to Li Qiye’s mastery and couldn’t agree because that would be diminishing his progenitor’s accomplishment.

In the end, he smiled wryly and handed the tree over: “We’re counting on you Young Noble. Qilin Manor will honor you for generations to…”

“Buzz.” He couldn’t finish before the momentum of the nine worlds lit up and became filled with dao runes.

The array was being used to its limit and created a maelstrom. It sucked Li Qiye inside, making it look like he was one with the array.

“This is a thing?” Resplendent once thought that no one alive was better at using the array than him.

Alas, seeing the maelstrom made him realize that he knew very little about the array’s potential.

“You didn’t know about this?” Gourdkeeper asked.

The two were close friends and he had seen Resplendent use the array numerous times. This was a new phenomenon.

“I didn’t know about it.” Resplendent said, wondering if he had failed to understand the array.

After thinking for a few minutes, he dispelled this lack of confidence. He had total control over the array and could use it at a whim. There was no profundity within that he wasn’t privy to.

“Peerless Monarch left this behind.” The quiet old servant finally spoke for the first time.

The two became emotional after hearing this. Resplendent became frightened.

They have been using the array for eras now but none figured it out. Today, Li Qiye activated it after seeing it for the first time. Moreover, why didn’t Peerless Monarch avail this to her own sect members?

He couldn’t come up with an answer despite trying his best.

***

Who knew more about the nine worlds than Li Qiye? Peerless Monarch was still inferior in this regard.

Because of this, he was able to reach the very source of the array - a bright expanse made up of supreme laws varying in origin - Immortal Emperors, supreme cultivators…

Each was unique yet when fused together in harmony to make up the array and grant it incredible power.

He sighed after sensing the laws since he knew who they represented. Peerless Monarch was not alone in the creation of Resplendent Array.

He sat down and eventually, the area in front of him fluctuated and flowed like a spring before turning into a woman.

Her regal aura could force others to kneel down. Nonetheless, she also possessed a look of elegance and wisdom.

“It is an honor to see you again, Young Noble. The throne awaits you.” Miao Chan kneeled and said.

“You chose to pass away here in order to imprint your mark.” He said sentimentally.

She was once known as Miao Chan in the nine worlds. In the current epoch, she was Peerless Monarch of Qilin Manor.

Her descendants did not know that she had imprinted her mark into the array itself, becoming its most crucial part.

“We have been waiting for you, Young Noble.” She said. Now she was the soul of Resplendent Array - a different method of survival.

“Imperial Attendant City?” He smiled wryly.

“You are the only one worthy of ruling the land. City Lord Zi Yan and many others built the city to welcome you back. Alas, war and time have gotten the best of us. I also tried my best but couldn’t be here in person for this moment.” She said softly.

“You shouldn’t have tried so hard, your suffering was not worth it.” He sighed.

“We were waiting to wait for you, Young Noble, the nine worlds require your protection.” She said.

“That’s why you crafted the momentum of the nine worlds.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, the nine worlds remain in my heart. Due to my shallow cultivation, I can only copy an incomplete version.” She said.

“It was a difficult task indeed. Since I am here today, I will do my best to remove the flaws, a small consolation for your sacrifice.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I only regret not being able to follow you again, Young Noble.” She bowed.

“I’ll return this to the source, go rest now.” Li Qiye sighed and took out the tree.

“I understand.” She bowed again and said: “When you have time, please visit Imperial Border. The empresses and fairies have left behind messages.”

“I will.” He nodded.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She bowed one last time before returning to the source. As for Li Qiye, he began deriving the profundities of the dao in order to create a new momentum with the Tree of Tranquility added.t
