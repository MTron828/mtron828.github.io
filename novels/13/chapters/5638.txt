Chapter 5639: I’ll Help You Out

The pause only lasted for a split second. Next, one ring started rotating until reaching a certain angle before stopping.

“Creak.” The second initiated until the right angle as well.

And so did the third... Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The sound they made resembled a heavy iron gate being pushed open.

... ...

Previously, the light rings rotated in silence, a stark contrast to the current commotion.

Thousand-hand, Bai Lian, and Sindragon watched with bated breath. They knew that Li Qiye was activating the mystery of reincarnation within this peerless treasure.

Eventually, once the formation was finished, ancient dao runes appeared in each one. The trio had never seen anything like them before.

“Boom!” The scene of their linking up resembled the opening of a divine treasury. They formed a divine ring coiling around the flower. It poured down chaos energy belonging to the start of time.

The stars in the stamen flew out and embedded themselves into the ring, resulting in deafening blasts. Something incredibly heavy seemed to be floating upward - an old tablet.

It had a rectangular form but an unknown force severed the top corners, giving it a somewhat triangular shape. Despite looking like a rock tablet, it was made from countless dao runes stacked together. Their age was similar to those found on the divine ring.

“This has to be the Heaven Cutting Tablet.” Bai Lian recognized this treasure.

“Indeed, the defining treasure of Ice Feather Palace.” Li Qiye said.

With that, he sent a light out of his fingertip. This caused the runes in the tablet to move and transform, releasing rays of anima.

“Buzz.” Space became frozen as the runes gathered into the shape of a beauty - flawless feminine features with a radiant spirit, yet she was dressed in men’s clothing. This exuded a unique charm.

Most importantly, she emitted a force capable of freezing the myriad realms despite being just a silhouette. The ocean of blood became frozen as a result. If she wanted so, she could freeze the entire world with a single thought.

It appeared that she was sealed in the tablet but in reality, being embedded in the tablet was the reason for her survival.

She was ecstatic to see Li Qiye and started speaking. Alas, no one could hear her. This was akin to a human-shaped drawing trying to talk. They could scream as loud as possible but none could hear her.

“Ice Empress!” Thousand-hand Dao Lord became startled.

Bai Lian was older and unfamiliar with Ice Empress. However, the younger Thousand-hand and Sindragon have heard of her legends.

Her battle with Immortal Emperor San Shi froze an entire region, now known as Ice Plateau. This shocked the whole nine worlds; inhabitants trembled in horror from the shock waves.

The result included the death of the emperor while Ice Empress was no longer seen again.

“She took over Reincarnation Loop.” Bai Lian understood what Li Qiye meant earlier.

“Yes, she utilized the tablet to expel Immortal Emperor Yi Shi. This is how she survived.” Li Qiye nodded.

Immortal Emperor San Shi couldn’t rely on Reincarnation Loop to snatch another body because Ice Empress used her tablet to sever his true fate and soul from the treasure.

She, being on the brink of death, had to seal herself into the treasure. Her last move included breaking through space with an ultimate move from the tablet and entering the thirteen continents.

“That’s it for him.” Bai Lian understood why a fourth emperor didn’t show up later on.

Immortal Emperor Yi Shi planned his life around being able to reincarnate. Alas, losing the loop spelled the end for him. All the seeds he prepared no longer mattered.

As for Li Qiye, he was happy to see the familiar face again. Memories of the assertive cross-dressing girl put a smile on his face.

“I’ll help you out, let’s see where your fortune takes you now.” Li Qiye looked at Ice Empress who was desperately trying to speak to him.

He raised another finger. This movement alone froze the trio, making them feel helpless like insects. Despite their cultivation achievements, they wouldn’t be able to block a single finger strike from him.

Fortunately for them, Li Qiye touched the loop instead.

“Buzz.” The light rings expanded and became resplendent, seemingly resisting his attempt. This didn’t change the outcome at all.

His pressure caused the loop to crumble down into little pieces. He further reduced them down into particles.
