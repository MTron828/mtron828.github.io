Chapter 4330: Deer Crushed

Gao Qixin didn’t think that Li Qiye would dare to kill him in public, especially not in the young lord’s presence. That would be suicidal.

“I see.” Li Qiye teleported in front of him and raised him up in the air by his throat. The crowd had no idea how he did it; they only saw Gao Qixin’s face turning red.

He kicked his legs and struggled but it was useless.

“Ss-save me!” He finally uttered two words and asked for help, feeling the presence of death looming.

“Stop!” Deer King unleashed a palm strike of the lightning affinity. He was indeed an expert from Dragon.

The powerful strike caused dust and stones to fly everywhere. He was clearly far stronger than masters of minor sects.

“Is he suicidal?” One of them shouted.

The conference was presided by the young lord of Dragon on top of numerous experts. However, Li Qiye still dared to attack Gao Qixin - a new member of Dragon. Deer King alone should be able to kill him.

“Boom!” Li Qiye simply used his other hand to stop the incoming palm strike.

“Crack!” At the same time, he strengthened his grip and wrung Gao Qixin’s neck.

The victim’s eyes were wide open with unwillingness and disbelief. He has just become a member of Dragon; his future was so bright. Alas, death stopped him from enjoying his potential.

The scene became silent right away. Some spectators’ jaw nearly dropped to the ground, especially the smaller sects and members of Little Diamond.

This was nothing short of a challenge of war against Dragon. Mediation became impossible.

The consequence of opposing Dragon was obvious for the smaller sects - destruction. They thought that Li Qiye had sealed both his fate and his sect’s.

“I wonder why so many have this blind confidence when going against me?” Li Qiye chuckled, tossed Gao Qixin’s corpse to the side, then wiped his hands.

This left the audience speechless. He was still feeling so nonchalant in spite of what he had done before the young lord.

“Xin’er!” The master of Maple Ravine screamed. It wasn’t easy for his sect to groom such a capable genius.

Gao Qixin was going to be an inner disciple of Dragon. This made their sect’s future awfully bright. Alas, all of their efforts were in vain because of Li Qiye.

“Deer King, please, uphold justice and avenge Xin’er!” He begged Deer King for help.

All eyes were on Deer King now, waiting for his next move.

Of course, Gao Qixin was introduced to the sect by Deer King. There was no way Deer King would take this sitting down.

“Enough of this!” He was furious and channeled his vitality. The initially small antlers on his head grew larger and became awfully sharp.

“Crackle!” Lightning crackles could be heard as black clouds appeared above the pair of antlers. Lightning bolts could be seen by the spectators.

“He has one foot in the myriad-form realm now.” Weaker sect masters became startled.

As for members of the large sect, they weren’t affected in the slightest. Myriad-form wasn’t considered a top cultivation realm in their sect. Many top youths were already in this realm.

However, it should be said that Deer King didn’t have as high of a starting point. This was impressive in that sense.

“Villain, today is your last!” He lowered his head and aimed his antlers forward, thrusting energy blades of the lightning affinity at his foe.

Alas, when they got close enough, Li Qiye easily clasped them.

“What?!” The spectators, both weak and strong, couldn’t believe it. They thought that this was an unfair fight due to the gap in cultivation.

However, Li Qiye easily stopped the attack with his bare hands.

“Goo-!” Deer King crazily roared and released his fate palaces. They poured out dao power and vitality into the antlers.

Lightning bolts coursed through the pair and assaulted Li Qiye. This was an attempt to break free from his grip. Unfortunately, the shaking antlers couldn’t break loose. The lightning bolts were useless as well.

“You brought this on yourself.” Li Qiye smiled and added a bit of force.

“Crack!” He easily broke the antlers.

“Nooo!” Deer King let out his last word because Li Qiye went on to split his head into two halves. His brains splattered everywhere as a result. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Some of the youths in the crowd had never seen such violence before and became nauseous. Female disciples of the small sects closed their eyes, no longer wanting to see the corpse.

Silence and astonishment took over the stage. Various emotions could be seen on faces. For example, the young lord’s expression became quite ugly.

“It’s over, a storm is coming.” The leader of a small sect nearly pissed in his pants.

He and his peers thought that Li Qiye had done messed with the beehive. Their sects might be in trouble as well.
