Chapter 3785: Shocking Development

Righteous Scion’s trip across Metropolis was rather peaceful. Both the young and old didn’t say a word. No one dared to challenge him.

The fight with Golden Cicada Buddhist Child solidified his unbeatable status. Challenging him now required immense courage and power.

Metropolis was extremely close to the capital and Minor Sacred Mountain. However, he wasn’t in a rush to see Dugu Lan that early.

He took his time and leisurely visited the famous sceneries again. It didn’t look like he was in enemy territory at all. Though he was constantly under watch, this didn’t deter his saunter in the slightest.

The spectators were annoyed once more but once again, they had to endure this displeasure. They hoped for this challenge to end already so that he would leave. Otherwise, his presence at the holy ground would continue to torment them.

Today, something changed starting with a deafening boom. The entire holy ground suddenly quaked.

“What was that?” Numerous experts became frightened.

The quaking didn’t last long but still made everyone nervous due to the current sensitive circumstances. They immediately thought about the scion, thinking that he was sabotaging something.

However, those closest stared at him and he certainly didn’t do anything. He himself was surprised during the quakes. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Buzz.” During their astonishment, Buddhist rays all over the holy ground shot to the sky. However, they suddenly fell back down a while later.

Everyone felt that the power of the holy ground was shrinking. Their own power was leaving too along with the land’s power.

This sensation scared the hell out of cultivators. As members of the holy ground, their merit laws and dao foundation were built upon the land.

Thus, if the land’s foundation suddenly collapsed, their cultivation would suffer immense setbacks. The worst-case scenario would be dropping in realms.

“Wha-what? Is the dao source weakening?” Even the slumbering top masters woke up in horror.

If the holy ground’s dao source was indeed deteriorating, it would affect numerous kingdoms and cultivators. Even the mortals would have a tough time.

The frightened cultivators felt as if they had been disconnected from the holy ground. Of course, they weren’t mighty enough to control the power of the land but since they were born here, they could feel the grand dao power in the soil.

This power stemmed from the source of the holy ground. Alas, this aura and presence were no longer felt. The connection has been severed.

“Impossible!” A top master who had just woken up from his slumber became startled: “Buddha Holy Ground has been prosperous all this time, the foundation is still strong, what is going on?”

The present days couldn’t compare to the golden age but after millions and millions of years of accumulation, the holy ground still had plenty of resources. There was no sign of decline, hence everyone’s astonishment and fear.

“Boom!” Another loud bang suddenly detonated and Buddhist rays soared to the sky once more in an endless manner. People immediately felt the dao power of the land again stemming from underground.

“The Buddhist affinity is back!” Cultivators became joyous right away. The fear earlier was just too much.

“How fortunate.” Even the awakened big shots heaved a sigh of relief.

They have experienced plenty of things and traveled across Eight Desolaces. Nonetheless, the disappearance of the holy ground’s dao power still frightened them.

Normally, a phenomenon like this would only occur during the destruction of the source and foundation. In this case, there were no external enemies invading, hence the confusion. Nonetheless, it was finally over.

“Did something happen to Sacred Mountain?” This became the next question.

Sacred Mountain served as the core of the holy ground. Thus, in order to destroy the holy ground, one must take down Sacred Mountain first. That’s why everyone thought about Sacred Mountain right away. Maybe something big happened there.

Alas, most had no idea where it was. Only a chosen few could climb up the mountain to verify. The former had no choice but to wait for an official announcement.

In spite of the confusion, at least everything was fine now - or so they thought. Another loud boom occurred. This time, on top of Minor Sacred Mountain.

This caught everyone off guard. When they looked up the peak, they saw one of the statues protecting the holy palace suddenly collapsed.

“What the hell?!” Those at the capital city who could witness it in person were bewildered.

“That’s Dhyana Dao Lord’s statue, why did it fall down?” The big shots in Vajra were stricken with fear.

These four statues had a special significance in the holy ground, representing authority. Now, one had fallen without warning.

Most who heard this information couldn’t believe it.

“No way, the four statues have been around for so long, it can’t just fall down for no reason.” Denial was the main theme even for those who saw it.

Nonetheless, this was reality. The news of this event spread across the holy ground and caused a furor.

“We need to take a look now!” Cultivators ran for Minor Sacred Mountains, even the big shots.

Minor Sacred Mountain has always been protected by the power of the dao lords. The pinnacle was extremely difficult to reach so no one could have taken down the statue.

Once they made it to the base, they saw something unbelievable.
