Chapter 4980: Goldcrest Young Noble’s Identity

How could an ant ever stop a dragon? The result should have been obliteration.

Alas, Li Qiye easily stopped the claw with his bare hand. The tiger monarch tried to break free but this was proven to be impossible.

"How dare you! Activate!" The tiger monarch's voice thundered across the land. With a mighty roar, he sent out shockwaves that devastated forests and crumbled mountains.

This was a power comparable to a dragon lord, enough to reduce a sovereign such as Yunyun to blood.

However, he still couldn’t break free from Li Qiye.

“Who’s the worm here?” Li Qiye smiled and smashed the tiger monarch repeatedly. The mountains nearby were replaced by large pits as a result.

"Boom!" At last, he released the tiger monarch, who was now only a shadow of his former self. The once mighty beast was on the brink of death, gasping for his last breaths.

Goldcrest didn’t know what to say along with members from both armies. He had seen what Li Qiye could do with the dao controller before. However, he didn’t have the invincible artifact and used his bare hand this time.

The demon soldiers wondered how this puny human managed to reduce their demon monarch to this state?

“See ya.” Li Qiye smirked and raised his foot.

“Bam!” The tiger’s scream echoed across the region.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Crack!” Li Qiye somehow managed to crush the tiger’s gigantic head with just one stomp.

Suddenly, a totem appeared on the corpse. A primordial aura engulfed the battlefield and made everything tremble. It protected the tiger’s true fate, allowing it to escape.

“Tiger Deity!” The crowd bellowed.

This was one of the six prime powers of Demon. Alas, it was still not enough because Li Qiye managed to seize the tiger’s true fate.

“There’s no escaping.” Li Qiye said.

“Nooo!” The tiger bellowed but it was too late.

The power of worship coming from the tiger totem couldn’t stop Li Qiye.

“Pop!” He crushed the true fate along with the totem.

This power dispersed back to the source while the true fate fell to the ground. Its remnant forces melted into the ground and returned to Demon.

This shocked the crowd more than when he crushed the tiger monarch’s head. Remember, they were protected by the six deities in Demon. This granted them protection, making them rather difficult to slay.

In fact, given a similar cultivation level, they might be harder to kill than dragon lords or conquerors.

Goldcrest shuddered because he didn’t know anyone else in the lower continents capable of this.

Crushing the power of a deity in Demon? Right now, perhaps only Conceal Conqueror could do this.

“Kill them!” Goldcrest’s commanders shouted and rushed toward the land walkers.

After losing their leader, the tigers and leopards lost their morale and were in total collapse. Their defeat became inevitable.

Meanwhile, Goldcrest returned to his prior form - a large rooster as Ming Shi put it.

“Thank you for saving me, Young Noble.” He tidied his robe before bowing.

“You wouldn’t have died anyway with the deity totem saving you.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It would have been the same miserable end, my Phoenix City would have been destroyed as well.” He said.

“I didn’t know you were a demon monarch, looks like I have underestimated you.” Yunyun smiled, not realizing that he was from Demon.

“You’re too kind, it’s just a blessing from the ancestors, not my own merit.” He said.

“I thought worshippers couldn’t leave the Ten Great Mountains.” She continued.

Of course, there were exceptions such as Demon Conqueror. However, he was too strong and couldn’t be considered part of the norm.

Wild Dragon was also able to leave. However, this was due to obtaining a peerless fortune.
