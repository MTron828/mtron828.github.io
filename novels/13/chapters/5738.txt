Chapter 5739: You’re Finally Here

Blood stained the expanse as the emperors fought to the death without holding back. This was just a continuation of a bloody saga that had started with Immemorial Epoch War.

The People were particularly motivated during this assault. Nonetheless, they knew that their chance was slim without Li Qiye’s involvement.

“Rumble!” Stars and space collapsed, oozing out fiery sparks as the final cry. Dao blasts and bright explosions blinded the combatants.

An emperor unleashed an imperial flame, burning stars into ashes. Another monarch channeled anima power into his cauldron for a massive smash. One conqueror summoned a rain of heavenly swords, cutting through everything along the way...

Screams could be heard during the merciless exchanges due to pulverization and dismemberment. Blood and flesh scattered in space, painting a horrific scene.

Some of them were in their avatar form so their huge corpses floated in space, not rotting for eras to come.

One brought a mighty warship of unimaginable size only to have it destroyed by a single strike. The remnant pieces filled up a large area.

Those of a demonic origin also returned to their original form - colossal beasts. When they fell in battle, their corpses were truly a sight to behold.

In the distant future, cultivators would be able to imagine this battle after seeing the colossal corpses and broken treasures.

Meanwhile, Sword Emperor merely observed the fight, assuming a nearly illusory state that made people forget about his existence.

“Clank!” A heavenly sword descended and reaped lives, taking down several ancient gods, dragon lords, and even emperors.

“Immortal Emperor Ren Xian!” Celestial Court’s members became startled and retreated after seeing the new arrival.

“Gentlemen, I apologize for what I shall do.” A middle-aged man entered the battlefield and decapitated another ancient god.

He resembled a fair-skinned scholar instead of a bloodthirsty combatant despite wielding a blade. Alas, he never hesitated with each swing, either delivering grievous injuries or death.

He was another apex cultivator from The People, being one of its main pillars during Immemorial Epoch War. He fought bravely and bought time for his allies to evacuate during Celestial Court’s initial push.

Subsequently, he protected a vast region from the legions of Celestial Court.

Today, his magnificent and bloody display proved that his reputation was well-earned.

“Clank!” Another sword in tune with the heavenly dao descended and sealed the area, preventing Immortal Emperor Ren Xian from continuing his rampage.

“You’re finally here, Fellow Daoist.” It was none other than Sword Emperor with his sword intent activated.

Just one wave of his hand could split the heaven - the reward of being obsessed with and dedicated to the sword dao during his youth.

“Sword Emperor.” Immortal Ren Xian had a serious expression at last.

“Fellow Daoist, haven’t seen you since our fight during Immemorial Epoch. It is a pleasure to meet again.” Sword Emperor slowly lifted his blade.

“Buzz.” It seemed overly excited as if it hadn’t tasted blood in a long time. Immortal Emperor Ren Xian was a sight for sore eyes.

“I’m ready.” The emperor raised his sword as well, releasing his twelve Heaven’s Wills and anima power. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

His virtuous sword pulsed brightly and released a majestic aura. There seemed to be countless sages from an ancient scroll appearing. They have listened to generations of teachings and now, this was the time for them to empower the blade.

“Boom!” As they were gesturing with their blades, a billowing wave engulfed the expanse and affected emperors despite having their domain activated.

The origin of this wave was a woman who was as radiant as the moon itself. She dressed in all white and moonlight emanated from her.

Calling her a moon goddess was no exaggeration. Her breath seemed to be controlling the cycles of heaven and earth.

She exuded an imperial might second to none. Moreover, she possessed an inherent nobility different from everyone else. She was born with it, destined to be the noblest in existence.

Dignified and beautiful with flawless complexion and features like a work of art, she mesmerized others with her appearance without trying.
