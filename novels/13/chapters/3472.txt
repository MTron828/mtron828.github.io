Time came to a halt; words weren’t necessary because one glance was enough for them to understand each other.

“It’s not over between us!” Her pleasant voice echoed, seemingly becoming a part of space.

Once it dispersed, the light and her figure also disappeared from sight. The runes became lifeless once more.

“Indeed.” He sighed and smiled wryly.

He focused his attention on the stone pillar and the item again. It wasn’t moving and didn’t emit any special aura.

The world has always talked about the emperor’s treasury and legacy. They thought it would contain countless treasures, peerless merit laws, and invincible weapons...

None of that was here. She only left one thing - an item that she couldn’t understand. Plus, it was meant for only one person - Li Qiye.

She knew that if she couldn’t come up with an answer, the dark crow was the only one left who could do so.

Now, in the case of Li Qiye failing as well, only the villainous heaven would be left. However, it wasn’t part of this world.

“Hmm...” Li Qiye murmured while looking at the item.

It wasn’t a treasure at all. Nothing good would come of it, only a terrible nightmare to all of Eight Desolaces. That’s why the emperor took a painstaking effort to suppress it here.

He then thought about the weakened dao runes all over the ground. They weren’t exactly useless just yet. Even a dao lord couldn’t do anything in this place without thinking twice.

He took out a stone egg obtained from the park. It became magnificent after his carving and had an unfathomable mystery within.

He let it roll towards the dao runes. Something magical happened during the roll; it actually absorbed all the dao runes on its path.

Nothing was damaged; all the runes were absorbed in their complete version. It was as if this wasn’t an absorption but a mere relocation.

The egg circled around the lake numerous times in order to grab all the dao runes. The ground became glossy and smooth just like a mirror with the runes gone.

This was the reason why he obtained the stone egg then took the time to carve it. He needed it to move everything here.

The egg eventually finished its task and Li Qiye put it away. He then walked to the front of the stone pillar.

The invincible runes on it were embedded by Immortal Assailant Emperor. The pillar pierced into the ground and was connected to the ancestral vein.

A dao lord had no chance of moving the pillar. It has become one with heaven and earth. This power allowed it to suppress the item left here.

He took a deep breath and tossed the egg at the stone. It latched onto the surface and started rolling up. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The same thing happened - the egg absorbing all the runes during the roll. Only Li Qiye could come up with this ingenious method of moving the runes without damaging them. The pillar eventually had the same smooth surface just like the ground.

With the runes gone, the suppression disappeared as well. The item on top of the pillar finally showed its true form.

It was around the size of a thumb, perhaps a bit bigger. There was a layer of ash. In terms of appearance, it resembled a tree root that has been burnt before. As for texture, it was soft like a severed part of a tentacle.

No one would take a second look at this thing if it was randomly left on the ground. It didn’t look valuable nor harmful, only a burnt tree root. However, Li Qiye knew how special it was.

“Cut down...” Li Qiye understood which power did this.

Trying to sense it was useless. It had no aura. Derivation didn’t work either to analyze its materials. This was something unprecedented in this world.

Nonetheless, he knew that it was dangerous because there seemed to be a bit of life in it. Perhaps this wasn’t the right classification either. This wasn’t the same “life” found in this world.

He knew that it was growing at a slow pace, virtually indiscernible. An expert could keep an eye out the entire time without noticing the minute change.

He waited until it grew another inch. “Boom!” Everything quaked during this moment.

That’s right, all of Eight Desolaces quaked once including the isolated and hidden realms.

The world felt so feeble. All inhabitants noticed this quake.

“What’s going on?!” Even the ancient existences woke up in fear.

Something seemingly pierced Eight Desolaces and left a huge wound. However, all eight regions felt perfectly fine. No damage actually occurred.

Only the top masters sensed this horrifying power and no longer thought that they were invincible in this era. This made them turn pale.

“Hmph.” Li Qiye scowled and made his move with the egg - a direct suppression.

“Boom!” The thing couldn’t react in time before getting smashed by the egg.

Instead of crushing it, the egg immediately sucked it inside just like the dao runes earlier.
