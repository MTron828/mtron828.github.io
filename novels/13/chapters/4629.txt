Chapter 4630: I’ll Marry You

He wouldn’t be able to defeat everyone regardless of his effort. This was just reality, not a lack of confidence.

The great powers had virtually unlimited challengers, especially the behemoths. Just the young generation of True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, and Divine Dragon Valley could sweep through the crowd. Most importantly, even the conquerors might show up.

Therefore, Jian Ming couldn’t keep his spot on the battle stage forever. He knew the gap between him and Shen Juntian or True Immortal Young Emperor.

His heart wanted to fight for Ye Tingrong but the lack of ability meant that failure was imminent.

“Young Noble, would you be able to protect my sect?” Ye Tingrong made up her mind and asked with a serious tone.

Doubts overwhelmed her because they were up against the behemoths. Li Qiye was certainly not the favorite but her perspective had changed. She thought that he could be reliable in this scenario.

“It’s a simple request.” Li Qiye said nonchalantly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“In that case, please grant us your protection, Young Noble.” She bowed her head deeply and beseeched. She chose a third path, not the marriage alliance or the battle competition.

“Young Noble.” Jian Ming stared at Li Qiye, hoping for him to accept.

He knew more than anyone that with Li Qiye’s involvement, Golden Gate would be saved. The behemoths and the other great powers coveting the treasure would be repelled.

“There is no free lunch for exchanges always exist. Of course, some couldn’t be seen by others.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“As long as you are willing to repel the enemies and protect Golden Gate, I will offer you my service.” She bowed again, not wanting to miss this chance.

“The priestess had said the same thing but I have no lack of followers.” Li Qiye said.

This shook the listeners to the core, especially Ye Tingrong. Currently, the title “priestess” usually referred to one being - the successor of Ancestral Divine Temple and the brightest jewel of the world.

This priestess had as much prestige as the five conquerors yet she still wanted to follow Li Qiye? Ye Tingrong thought that she was nothing in comparison.

In terms of background, Golden Gate was not a match for Ancestral Divine Temple. In fact, she couldn’t compare to a regular disciple from the temple, let alone its priestess.

If Li Qiye refused the priestess, why would he accept her? This left her in a difficult position.

“You don’t necessarily need to follow me, there is another compromise.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What I ask what it is?” She calmed down and asked.

The daoist and Paramount Scion naturally understood the implication.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye glanced over at Jian Ming who was standing there in a daze. Ye Tingrong was quick enough to catch on.

“Brother Jian, would you be willing to marry me?” She said with determination in her eyes.

Marriage was often a sensitive topic for ladies yet she didn't mind. This was her way of deciding her own fate.

She understood that Li Qiye didn’t want her but Jian Ming did. Since Jian Ming was Li Qiye’s follower, this became the compromise.

“I…” This caught Jian Ming off guard. He liked her enough to put her wish above his own. However, he hasn’t had time to tell her his feelings or propose to Golden Gate yet. Now, she became the one to take the initiative and rendered him speechless.

“Why are you so slow? Say yes already.” The daoist elbowed him.

He regained his wits and stammered: “No, it shouldn’t be like this…”

“I see, you don’t want to.” She sighed in response.

“Wha-what I meant is…” Jian Ming had a hard time expressing himself.

“Go on, Brother Jian.” She asked for elaboration.

The quick-witted Jian Ming seemed clumsy right now as he spoke: “Miss Ye, it’s because you don’t love me, this isn’t fair for you.”

“I understand and appreciate you being so considerate of my feelings, this is why a marriage between us will be fine. It is better than the alternative, being forced to marry the winner of the battle stage, whether it be True Immortal Spirit or someone else. That is not what I want.” She said.

Ultimately, marrying Jian Ming was the best choice for her given the tough circumstances.

“Th-this matter affects the rest of your life, Miss Ye.” He still hesitated.

“Indeed, but I have lost control over my own life. Marrying you is the only decision I can call my own.” She stared intensely at him.
