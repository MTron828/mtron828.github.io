Chapter 5412: Blessed By An Immortal

“You’re a roadblock, aren’t you?” The voice said slowly.

“That’s an interesting way to put it, but I think of myself as something grander.” Li Qiye chuckled and took a bite of phoenix wings.

“Putting that aside, it’s your turn to respond to the move.” The voice said.

“And if I don’t?” Li Qiye asked.

“You know the answer, the tree will burn to leave room for a new dao. Of course, this is a calamity to the world, and not just one world.” The voice said.

“I don’t think any of that will be happening as long as I’m alive. It’ll be in vain.” Li Qiye said confidently.

“Nonetheless, we must still act because it’s spanning across all three timelines.” The voice said. [1]

“Three timelines?” Li Qiye’s expression became serious.

“That’s why we are in this miserable position, just one timeline is not enough to force us to take action or jump into another pit. The world has gone down in one timeline already.” The voice said: “Three immortals have paid the price and we had to make a choice as well.” [2]

“Looks like not everyone persevered.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I don’t blame them, and we know that it is more than just one junior or a person behind this. If he is behind this, that changes everything, and I do think this is the most likely scenario.” The voice said.

“Well, he and your group share the same origin. In terms of heritage and mutual understanding, if I were in their shoes, I would have chosen that side as well. It’s a reasonable decision.” Li Qiye said.

“I agree regarding our origin, but as for mutual understanding? I’m not so sure. He has walked for too long, it’s impossible to trace now.” The voice said.

“Walked for too long.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I haven’t seen him this time but from an objective standpoint, he might no longer be who we know.” The voice said.

“Sure, time can change everything.” Li Qiye nodded.

“That’s why when comparing the two of you, I feel like I understand you more than him.” The voice said.

“It is an honor.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Indeed, we chose you and have struggled because of it. Otherwise, we could have just acquiesced, no need to be jumping into another pit like this.” The voice said.

“I understand and appreciate your decision.” Li Qiye said: “But do you think that it would have been better if there was no opposition at all?”

“It’s hard to say, it depended on the individual’s desire. If it’s a matter of dominance, then the outcome would have been easy to predict. But if it’s something similar to you or him, determined to see things through to the end, that’s a different story.” The voice said.

“If my disciples are the ones standing before me, I won’t be acting as the roadblock anymore.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“That’s wishful thinking, for that to happen will require an immense length of time. Neither you nor him need to wait that long.” The voice said.

“So you think the time is now?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Am I wrong? So much time has passed yet he has not shown any sign of movement until now, and you will have to react accordingly. This will be the catalyst.” The voice said.

“True.” Li Qiye admitted.

“You’ve pushed first and he’s pushing back now.” The voice said.

“So much trouble, I only did what I should have done.” Li Qiye smiled.

“He’s doing the same thing.” The voice said: “If you wish to be the replacement and succeed, then he’ll just try to replace you. But if this isn’t the case, all predictions and calculations go out the window.”

“Not if, it’s a certainty.” Li Qiye said before enjoying a delicious soup.

“That’s why it doesn’t matter if you’re in a hurry or not, he’ll have to respond in this epoch.” The voice said.

“Just have to be ready for it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Although we haven’t seen him, judging by the stone, we’re certain that he is well-prepared. This was an important factor in our decisions.” The voice said.

“It’s just a stepping stone, nothing more.” Li Qiye said.

“For whom, that’s the key question.” The voice said.

“It doesn’t matter too much.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “The legend of the mortal world finally appeared, being blessed by an immortal.”

“The brat isn’t only seeking everlasting life.” The voice said: “If that is all he wants, he wouldn’t go as far as wanting to burn down the entire forest.”

“Rather ambitious.” Li Qiye said.

“Although you have replaced Trinity with your new epoch, that’s only this world and not part of Three Immortals. However, your primordial tree extends to all crevices, everything beneath the heaven is within your grasp now. So, burning this tree might be a shortcut to reap the benefits of your accomplishments.” The voice said.

“It’s possible, but I don’t think the timing is right.” Li Qiye said.

“For him, it might be right since he can use it as a stepping stone, he needs it.” The voice said.

“How funny, the stepping stone doesn’t know that it is a stepping stone. Perhaps that’s the problem.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, he doesn’t know, hence his bold advances. You are the roadblock before him so he wants to burn your tree down first.” The voice said.

“It’s one way to stop being a stepping stone, have to seize fortunes instead of waiting for it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Everything beneath the heaven is under your domination now, perhaps this state is enough? How many had reached this height in history?” The voice said.

“Well, there is one place beyond my reach.” Li Qiye said.

“That one? It’s very, very close to the high heaven.”

“Yes, ample preparation is essential.” Li Qiye said.

“You should still sweep through everything first.” The voice said.

“Feeling a bit worried?” Li Qiye asked.

“We’ve come so far and there is only one path to take now, I’m sure that applies to all the pieces in this game, not just me. We’ll definitely see through it to the end.” The voice concluded.

1. This is vague and can be interpreted differently. Three timelines, or “三世”, can mean too many things. Three worlds, three lifetimes, three generations, three eras, or past/present/future. I’m interpreting it as the past/present/future. 👈

2. Unsure if three immortals here is referring to the world or the actual three immortals, the people 👈
