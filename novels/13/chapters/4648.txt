Chapter 4649: Certain Death

True Immortal Young Emperor immediately shocked the crowd with his first move, completely changing the landscape of realities in order to save his fellow sect member.

Some spectators got the illusion of being trapped in his technique. They felt their cultivation and fortunes being robbed, leaving them empty-handed.

“He’s unbeatable!” A big shot shouted. The move lacked destructiveness yet made the potential targets feel helpless. This was something rather unique.

“Does he want to fight?” Someone else wondered.

In this split second, Tian Feng laughed and made his move. His battle spirit rampaged and stole everyone’s attention. Their soul trembled as a result.

“Wild Roar!” Tian Feng spewed out mantras in the form of true dragons. The roars crushed unprotected buildings and mountains instantly. This was the opposite of True Immortal Young Emperor’s attack.

The former resembled a blade silently cutting the throat. The latter was a large hammer smashing the victim repeatedly until only bits were left.

Both ended with death but the latter was clearly the worse outcome.

“Bam!” They struck each other and their shoulders trembled. The shockwaves crushed space and left behind chaotic fragments.

“No!!!” On the other side, True Immortal Spirit screamed. He summoned his defensive treasures in order to stop the incoming punch but it was futile.

It struck him in the chest and issued cracking noises before piercing through altogether. Blood gushed out of the hole and his true fate was destroyed. His corpse fell to the ground and issued a loud thump. This wasn’t the end he wanted - dying to someone he deemed inferior instead of a true master.

The scene became silent due to the death of a supreme genius. Moreover, he was from True Immortal on top of being a descendant of Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor.

This was a heavy loss for True Immortal, meaning that the resulting hatred was just as considerable. Imagine the resources and effort wasted.

Spectators shuddered because they knew that the response from True Immortal could have grave consequences for everyone. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The young emperor’s expression turned cold as he stared at the corpse. The two martial brothers had a good relationship. Alas, his junior brother died in front of him since Tian Feng interfered.

“Six-winged Emissary and now, True Immortal Spirit.” Someone stared at Li Qiye and said: “This is an irreconcilable feud with True Immortal.”

If True Immortal was benevolent to let go of the first murder, would they be able to do it again for the second? The answer was obviously not.

Six-winged Emissary wasn’t that important to them. The same couldn’t be said about True Immortal Spirit. The latter was superior in all aspects.

“Li Qiye will die for sure.” A powerful character concluded: “There is no way he can crush True Immortal.”

“This sect has been around for so long. Not even invincible masters and monstrous existences in history managed to fully destroy it. Li Qiye alone has no chance.” An ancestor said.

For example, the renowned “arrogant woman” and Emperor Ye were untouchable. They only managed to cripple True Immortal, not fully end it.

The sect managed to rise again eventually and dominate Sky Border once more. Li Qiye’s chance of victory seemed unlikely.

“Nonetheless, this brat is still unreal.” One expert said while shuddering.

This ordinary youth had just managed to borrow the fist intent of Worldbreaker - one of the seven forbidden zones. Even fist slaves didn’t have the freedom to use the fist intents unless they were characters such as God Fist or Golden Divine Fist.

“Did he come out of Worldbreaker?” A lord speculated.

“You’re implying that he’s a fist slave?” One big shot responded.

“Doesn’t seem that way, they can’t leave Worldbreaker and he’s not God Fist.” An ancestor shook her head.

Others agreed with this because God Fist was the only exception in history. Li Qiye certainly couldn’t compare to this mythical being.

“Who the hell is he? So unpredictable.” Another murmured.
