Chapter 5346: Destroying Heaven Alliance And Eradicating The Race

Illumination Conqueror started Azure School after losing Emperor War. He lived reclusively for a long period before starting to appear again in recent times. This worried many top cultivators since history could repeat itself.

Opinions toward him were divisive with one exception - none doubted his strength.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“We meet again, gentlemen.” Illumination said with a smile.

“Illumination, you are as stubborn as a haunting specter.” Swordsea glared coldly at him.

“Untrue since I always operate in broad daylight.” Illumination responded.

“True, hence your unsavory reputation.” Swordsea sneered.

“I can’t compete with you when it comes to having a bad reputation.” Illumination retorted.

It was obvious that these two did not like each other.

The gleam in Swordsea’s eyes told everyone that he wanted to fight. One slash from him could tear the world asunder.

“Illumination, feel free to call me a traitor directly.” Swordsea said: “I don’t care about races, only my own dao. I cut whoever blocks my path, which was why I raised my sword against you.”

Meanwhile, more and more spectators in Duality came to observe this potential skirmish between apex cultivators.

It was no secret that Swordsea Dao Lord joined Dao Alliance after ascending from Eight Desolaces. However, he joined Divine Alliance during Emperor War.

Many from The People considered this a traitorous move. They didn’t understand the reason for his betrayal but certainly didn’t forgive him for it.

On the other hand, Swordsea didn’t care for public opinion and only focused on his own dao. In his eyes, both The Race and The People were the same. He only chose the side that was more suitable for him. If this were to change with Divine Alliance, he would have no qualms about leaving.

“I’m afraid you have forgotten your initial purpose, this will cause stagnation in your dao.” Illumination said.

“My purpose is the dao itself. I came from Eight Desolaces and had no problem with The Race. Nonetheless, I pity you for being devoured by your own vengeance and becoming its puppet.” Swordsea retorted.

Listeners took a deep breath because few in this world would dare to talk to Illumination Conqueror like this.

Some thought that Swordsea was completely right. This included some big shots from The People since they still remembered how tyrannical Illumination Conqueror became during Emperor War.

“Well said!” Timewatcher laughed and said: “The two people I despise the most are here right now, Illumination and Supreme. One is blinded by hatred while the other doesn’t know when to stop. I’m sure the world will be a better place without you two.”

“I do what I must to strengthen my race.” Supreme smiled, unoffended by the comment.

“My pursuit is to destroy Heaven Alliance and eradicate The Race.” Illumination declared.

“Bah! Don’t try to sound grandiose now. Illumination, your life has been controlled by hatred and a fear of not knowing what to do outside of vying for vengeance. As for you, Supreme, you only want to establish an eternal mark on history. Your talk of noble aspirations and righteousness is just a way to hide your ugly vanity.” Timewatcher sneered: “How pitiful, so strong yet can’t even face the truth of who you are.”

“I do agree with one line, that this world will be a better place without you two.” Hallowed remarked.

“Since you’re both here right now, why not kill each other, the biggest obstacle to your goal?” Timewatcher laughed.

“That’s not a bad idea at all. Strengthening The Race and destroying Heaven Alliance, now is the best chance.” Li Qiye took a sip of tea and added.

All eyes were on Illumination and Supreme now. Since these two were here, why not settle it once and for all?

“I will entertain you, Illumination, if you wish to fight.” Supreme appeared elegant and dignified while standing alone in space. Using the word “elegance” to describe a man seemed unfitting. However, it was just right for Supreme.

He might be the only dragon lord who would dare to challenge Illumination - a conqueror who had killed countless top cultivators from The Race.

In fact, this surprised everyone including Timewatcher who tried to egg them on. None expected Supreme to actually challenge Illumination right now.

The spotlight fell upon Illumination - would he accept the direct challenge?

“I see that you wish to fight me, Supreme. However, my plan does not stop at you alone.” Illumination said with a smile.

“What is your plan then? Do tell since everyone is here.” Timewatcher was interested to hear the answer.
