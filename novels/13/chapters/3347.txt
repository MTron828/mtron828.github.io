“Apologize? You two pieces of trash dare to make a decision for me?” A voice came from afar.

Everyone looked outside and saw two people walking in - Li Qiye and Gong Qianyue.

The children from Liu were ecstatic to see Li Qiye.

The protectors and elders exchanged glances. They expected nothing less out of his first statement upon arrival. Iron Whip Demon King scowled in response.

Li Qiye leisurely walked in with Qianyue walking behind him like a maid.

Zhan Hu and Huang Ning detested the disdain in front of the seniors.

Huang Ning, in particular, had an ugly expression. Gong Qianyue and Li Qiye looked quite close now. He tried so hard previously to earn her favor but this toad got it without putting in any effort. He gritted his teeth; his hatred rose even more.

“Junior Brother, I’m only wanting what’s best for you and the sect. Honorable seniors, do you wish to see a war between us and Three Truths? We traded blood and lives for the peace treaty. Breaking it means that all of that effort and sacrifice were futile, we would become sinners in that case...” Zhan Hu appealed to emotions and logic, speaking with powerful rhetorics.

Many elders and protectors nodded in agreement. They certainly didn’t like Three Truths’ attitude but war should be avoided. The generation war of the past took a lot of effort to end.

Zhan Hu liked the acknowledgment and continued: “Junior Brother, this whole mess started because of us. If we come to their sect with sincerity, I’m sure the feud can be forgotten. It’ll be a great contribution too...”

He tried to dig a pit for Li Qiye to jump in. Everything would be easy as long as Li Qiye leaves Divine Black.

He had countless methods to kill Li Qiye outside, enough to completely obliterate the guy.

“Enough talk.” Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted the long spiel: “Just two divisional leaders alone completely crushed your group, you two are going to piss your pants after arriving at Three Truths. What’s this about escorting me? Worry about yourselves first.”

“Who’re you talking about?!” Huang Ning shouted.

A genius like him always had a hard time dealing with criticism and taunts in public, especially in Qianyue’s presence.

“Just two samadhi cultivators make you shrink back into your shell like a turtle. How are you going to protect me at Three Truths? Know your own limits.” Li Qiye sneered.

“Hmph, mind your words. Huang Ning and Zhan Hu are only thinking about the sect and your safety, they’re willing to risk their lives, that’s very commendable already.” Iron Whip Demon King uttered coldly.

“Stop praising your son and stop thinking that you’re somebody. I hope everyone here isn’t stupid enough to think that these two can actually protect me. That’s as idiotic as can be. Plus, they can’t compare to Qianyue.” Li Qiye dismissed the demon king’s comment.

Li Qiye was too direct so the demon king’s expression became ugly. He glared at Li Qiye and coldly uttered: “You’re too impudent...”

“His words are unpleasant but it is indeed the truth.” Ping Suoweng jumped in.

The demon king had to swallow his words, unable to vent after this. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Sure, Li Qiye was right. Zhan Hu and Huang Ning were far weaker than Gong Qianyue. Right now, she followed Li Qiye everywhere. Why would he need their protection?

The two wanted to retort but held it in after seeing Qianyue. They didn’t do anything before the Shu Brothers, unlike Qianyue.

“And, don’t be so naive and stupid now. There’s no way the peace will continue between Divine Black and Three Truths.” Li Qiye then glanced at the elder sand protectors.

“What do you mean?” The chief elder’s expression changed.

“Must I elaborate on something so simple?” Li Qiye said: “There hasn’t been any conflict for decades, correct? So why would two division leaders from Three Truth show up in our territory and acted with wanton regard over a blood ginseng? As division leaders, they surely know where the line is drawn as well as the content of the peace pact.”

“It’s obviously not a coincidence.” He lazily stretched and continued: “Three Truths is clearly aiming for Divine Black, they’re seeking a reason to break the pact in order to declare war.”

A few protectors and elders actually shared this thought. They just haven’t said it yet.

“Ridiculous.” Huang Ning snorted: “How could two division leaders decide to start a war? Only their sect master can do something like this.”

“Just two division leaders were enough to deal with the two of you, I didn’t hear you say anything aggressive towards them then. Now, you want to look down on them?” Li Qiye stated.

“Stop causing trouble here!” The livid Huang Ning trembled and bellowed.

“Huang Ning can be right as well. This independent event might not mean that they want to declare war.” Iron Whip Demon King said.

“I’m afraid that’s not the case. They’re definitely aiming for us and will declare war soon enough.” Ping Suoweng spoke again.

“Why?” The crowd clamored. Their sect master always chose his words carefully so people trusted him.

“The ancestral peak, the portal there is open now. You might not know that it leads to an ancestral vein, a true treasure.” Suoweng’s eyes became serious.

The audience gasped and started quietly discussing this matter. Very few knew about this secret until now.

“So the legend is real.” The chief elder was the oldest among them and nodded: “I’ve heard of this before.”

He then stared at Li Qiye and asked: “Young Master, did you see it at the top?”

“It’s true, because I was the one who activated it.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“What?!” Everyone instantly knew the implication.

“So reckless.” They didn’t hear the mantra of the emperor at all but still understood the potential danger.

“Others will certainly covet the path to a treasury.” One elder murmured.

“Opening the portal will cause a lot of trouble for us, very unwise.” A protector added.

They knew that all the experts and sects in the world would start scheming against them after finding this out.
