Chapter 5154: Don’t Need To Wait Long For Vengeance

Everyone became interested in this battle between a four-fruit conqueror and a saven-fruit dragon lord.

Their feud has been established the moment Heavenly Sword Godmonarch proposed to Harkrain Conqueror. Only one would walk out of this place alive.

“It’s a shame you weren’t around two days ago so I could kill you.” Windchaser Conqueror’s tornados were apocalyptic.

“Windchaser, I just need to kill you and then I can marry Harkrain.” The godmonarch laughed.

“Die!” The furious conqueror waved his hand and sent his tornados forward.

His opponents let out a battle cry and repaired their sword formations. Gigantic swords descended and destroyed numerous palaces.

“Go!” Thunderspear and Windchaser Lord regrouped their men and activated their barriers.

“Rumble!” Corpses rained down from the sky during the conflict. Both sides suffered grievous injuries.

“Looks pretty even.” One big shot took a deep breath: “There will be nothing left of Windchaser in that case.”

“It’s fine for the land to be finished because as long as their conqueror survives, everything can be rebuilt.” An ancestor sighed while looking at the destruction.

Alas, there was no other choice for Windchaser Hall since this was an existential crisis.

“No, Windchaser Hall won’t be able to last for long, Heavenly Sword is still holding back.” A dragon lord commented.

“Right, Heavenly Sword’s conqueror has yet to join the battle.” An expert from The Race said.

“Raa!” Suddenly, a bestial aura took over the battlefield.

“Boom!” A colossal creature aimed its foot at Soaring Sword Monarch.

The latter’s expression soured and pulled his sword back to block the stomp. It created an impressive barrier yet he still staggered several steps backward.

Spectators finally got a good look at the attacker - a gigantic bear.

“True Bear Conqueror.” The crowd became startled.

“True Bear Mountain was destroyed, right? I thought he died in battle too.” An ancestor took a deep breath.

Everyone thought that he was killed by Soaring Sword Monarch, hence their surprise to see him again today.

Furthermore, he had three dao fruits pulsing above his head right now. Albeit, two of them were relatively faint.

“Three dao fruits.” Someone murmured in astonishment because he was known to have just one.

Numerous underlings were massacred and a lair that he had lived in for one hundred thousand years was destroyed. The rage brought him out of the brink of death; vengeance stimulated his dao potential so he gained two fruits at the same time.

“Still not stable.” A dragon lord said while looking at the dimming fruits. The boost in power came at a cost. It left him with an unstable foundation and a serious injury.

“Raa!” True Bear’s only target was Soaring Sword Monarch. He entered a frenzied state and unleashed devastating swipes.

“So what if you have three fruits? I’m not afraid of you!” Soaring Sword Monarch entered a state of focus and delivered a phenomena slash.

“Break!” Windchaser Lord took advantage of this and thrust through everything, wanting to pierce Soaring Sword Monarch’s belly.

He alone couldn’t win but with the help of True Bear, they had the upper hand.

“Rumble!” Unfortunately, the longer the battle went, the more devastated the land became.

“Time waits for no one.” Jun Landu made his move and shook his head.

“Not only that, it is a pivotal race against time now.” Li Qiye made his move without wasting a second, putting Jun Landu in a tough position.

“Should I help?” The middle-aged man asked.

“Are you ready to declare war against Heaven Alliance?” Jun Landu was drenched with sweat but still focused on the board: “The battle at Windchaser is coming to an end but another will start soon at a different place.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This caused the middle-aged man to stare in a different direction.
