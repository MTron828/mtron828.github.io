Chapter 3824: Conclusion

Sword Hero has yet to come out of the rubble while the crowd remained frozen and shocked.

Some didn’t feel like thinking at all. Anyone else would be thinking about the merit law and power utilized by Li Qiye earlier. Which treasure or borrowing method was it?

However, what was the point because all of this felt so right when it was Li Qiye doing it. Shock shouldn’t be the reaction at this point, no need to call it a miracle either.

On the other hand, a top genius with talent greater than the four grandmasters had just lost to one smash. It became nearly unanimous that he was comparable to these four now.

That nemesis sword art had an unparalleled might yet it couldn’t resist the hammer slash in the slightest.

“One move, just one move...” An ancestor found this astonishing.

Everyone else thought that they were dreaming. Of course, this was obviously happening.

“Li Qiye didn’t lie about needing just one move.” An expert who has been paying attention to Li Qiye murmured.

As people regained their wits, they thought that even dreams wouldn’t have such a shocking development.

Righteous Scion and Xu Cuimei had a wry smile, unable to express their current emotion. The two of them were extremely powerful, enough to dominate any region.

Alas, their achievements were nothing compared to Li Qiye, akin to two fireflies competing with the luminous moon.

“Everything is possible in this vast world.” The scion commented after being enlightened today.

“How is Sword Hero?” One spectator asked.

Sword Hero was buried beneath debris so far away. If he were to survive, he would still be with grievous injuries.

“Members of Vajra went to help already.” A cultivator said.

Those who loudly supported him earlier kept their mouth shut. None bothered to go there and assist him. In the end, people from the dynasty had to go themselves.

At the very least, they needed to bring back his corpse in the worst-case scenario. A royal member of the clan couldn’t be left in the wilderness.

“Are we done here, gentlemen?” Li Qiye then glanced at the crowd.

They exchanged glances and no one dared to answer out of fear. Nothing made sense when it came to Li Qiye. It was best to not provoke this devilish existence in the future.

“We’re leaving.” An ancestor told his juniors and left.

Others didn’t dare to linger around either, not wanting to annoy Li Qiye. Only a minority stuck around. Most kept a safe distance from the peak in order to watch.

“You want me to carry you down the peak too?” Li Qiye looked at Xu Cuimei and Righteous Scion. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The scion had an awkward expression with his mouth slightly open. He was at a loss for words, looking more like an obedient child than an unstoppable genius.

“Of course not, Young Master.” Xu Cuimei felt more at ease since she was more familiar with Li Qiye. She smiled and continued: “We do want to invite you to Righteous Sect though.”

“Leave it up to fate.” Li Qiye nonchalantly replied.

“We’ll await your arrival, Young Master.” She smiled charmingly.

He then stared at the two with a focus on the scion: “Though I haven’t seen Righteous Sect Master, it shouldn’t be that easy for you to defeat him.”

“The senior was just being kind.” The scion no longer had an air of arrogance when speaking to Li Qiye.

“You do know everything, Young Master.” Xu Cuimei interjected.

“No need to flatter me, I know what you’re doing but out of appreciation for your intelligence, I won’t make it hard for you two.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve.

“Thank you, Young Master.” Xu Cuimei bowed. It was hard being mad at someone cute and smart like her.

“There’s nothing else to do at the holy ground, return from whence you came.” Li Qiye ordered.

The duo understood that he wanted them to leave. The scion stepped forward and bowed: “It is the fortune of a lifetime to meet you on this trip, Young Master. This is the greatest reward.”

Xu Cuimei wasn’t as serious as the scion but still put on a solemn expression: “Though our time together was brief, I’ve truly benefited from your guidance, Young Master. If you ever need me in the future, just say the words and I’ll do my best regardless of the danger.”

She rarely acted this serious before since it wasn’t a part of her carefree personality. This new aura of her looked rather imperious - akin to a god ready to ascend at any moment.

Of course, this aura only lasted long enough for her to finish speaking. She returned to being the spirited and cute lady once more.

Li Qiye didn’t find this surprising and accepted their showing of respect. “Go now.”

The two bowed once more before leaving the area quietly.
