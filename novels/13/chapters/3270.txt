The spectators didn’t need to watch to know the outcome of this fight. Li Qiye had no chance at all. They were only watching to see how he would die.

“It’s gonna be bad, extremely brutal.” One disciple snorted.

“Clank.” Yang Si pointed his sword at Li Qiye and taunted: “Brat, which arm should I cut off first?”

“Time is running out if you don’t make a move soon.” Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye.

“Haha, let’s see what you can do then. Hmm, cutting off your limbs might be too merciful, I’ll take my time ripping them off.” Yang Si actually put his sword away.

Li Qiye still didn’t give him the time of day despite the threats. This only served to infuriate him further.

“You’re mine!” Yang Si lunged forward, wanting to grab Li Qiye’s right hand with a tiger claw technique.

“He’s done!” The spectators thought that Li Qiye wouldn’t be able to dodge due to the power gap. Even if he managed to evade the first blow, it would only be a matter of time.

“Is he scared silly?” A few saw that Li Qiye wasn’t reacting and thought that he was paralyzed with fear.

Li Qiye retaliated by simply raising his finger and focused energy, resulting in a quiet noise. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ordinary disciples didn’t think much of it but those who could understand this sound would become shocked.

It contained the orders of the world and could be heard everywhere to the keen listeners. Ripples formed in the air and an invisible force of an unparalleled magnitude erupted.

Unfortunately, no one here realized what he had done and its profundity. They did notice something - the statue in front of the library suddenly fell down on Yang Si.

“Crack!” His silver armor broke off.

“What?!” He bellowed in fear while trying to lift the statue off him. Alas, its weight was incalculable as it pushed him down on the ground.

“Ahhh!” His scream echoed across Jade Bird before he turned into meat paste inside the newly-created pit.

Some blood flowed out and stained the statue and mud. Its stench permeated at the tip of everyone’s nose.

They became slack-jawed by this sudden development. This simply didn’t make any sense.

Yang Si could have lifted something weighing ten thousand pounds or more. This statue was only several thousand pounds at best. Not to mention killing him, it shouldn’t have been able to crush his silver armor.

Everyone would think that this was a bad joke. How could a Silver Carapace cultivator be crushed by a statue? Alas, this was indeed the case. What’s left of him was below the fallen statue.

Strangely enough, the statue has always been here without a problem. Why did it fall down today without any warning?

Moreover, Li Qiye did something with his finger right before. Yang Si’s death was too much to be a coincidence.

This was the first time seeing someone dying for some disciples, especially when it was their senior brother who was perfectly fine earlier. They started vomiting, overwhelmed.

“He’s dead, he’s actually dead...” One pale disciple murmured.

Lu Daowei’s complexion turned pasty, thinking that he was just dreaming. Li Qiye, on the other hand, didn’t show any emotion unlike the rest of the crowd.

It was as if in his eyes, only an ant had just died, not a person. Daowei noticed this and trembled.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!” Gongs could be heard around the peak as a group rushed over.

It consisted of elites wearing a stern expression, enough to intimidate the spectators.

The death of a disciple was a big deal so the disciplinary members were very serious.

“The disciplinary enforcers.” Many retreated to the side to make way for them.

“What happened here?” A youth asked with a deep voice. He had a human body and a tiger head. His eyes had a frightening glint that could deter anyone. His regal aura left others breathless.

“Senior Brother Zhan Hu...” Someone recognized him.

He was one of the strongest disciples among the new generation of Divine Black, also the First Brother of Jade Bird.

Some spectators stared at him with admiration.

He had another prestigious status outside of being the First Brother here - the son of Furious Tiger Peak Lord.

Iron Tiger Demon King didn’t have a child until he was older so he placed all of his hope and love onto Zhan Hu.

He spent a lot of effort on improving the boy and decided to let him train in Jade Bird. Zhan Hu didn’t let his father down, already being at the Conqueror Vessel realm - worthy of being called a genius. He was more brilliant compared to Liu Fuyou back then.

He was strong enough to shoulder responsibilities so the Flame Wolf King had high regard for him.

The wolf king rarely showed up due to being busy with cultivation. Thus, Zhan Hu took care of Jade Bird’s administrative duties.

People even said that if the wolf king were to become an elder, Zhan Hu might take over as the peak lord of Jade Bird.

That’s why he had a special authority and status here, the most influential figure in Jade Bird in the absence of the wolf king and the elders.

“What the hell happened here?!” Zhan Hu finally saw the statue and the blood.

“He, he did it!” One disciple pointed at Li Qiye while shaking.

So many were afraid of his wrath.

“Senior Brother Yang wanted to fight with Li Qiye but, but for some reason, the statue fell on Senior Brother Yang...” A different disciple stammered while recalling the event.

Zhan Hu’s expression changed, thinking that this statue had never fallen down in the past.
