Chapter 4878: Madman

Firerage didn’t get a good look but time seemed to be flowing backward as Li Qiye put his hand down, no longer snatching from another dimension.

He had obtained a dao essence completely different from the current grand dao and chaos true energy. It seemed to be from an older epoch. He then embedded it into the monument.

“Buzz.” The monument suddenly gained three new colors - light, golden, and violet. Their emergence exuded a supreme and holy power.

Light oozed out of the cracks and started healing them at an astonishing pace. This recovery seemed to be from an internal source.

It didn’t take long before the monument became perfect again, not even a shallow mark could be spotted. Now, it was whole once more and became one with the world.

Now, despite its dormant nature, it still made people feel insignificant and subservient, akin to mortals worshipping a god.

“Primal Trinity Against The Heaven of Primal Ancestor.” Li Qiye smiled after fixing the formation. Stealing dao essences was extremely taboo and would start an irreconcilable conflict.

However, this was Li Qiye’s epoch. As its lord, he could do whatever he wanted. Ordinary means couldn’t fix this grievously damaged formation but dao essences were special.

Its inactivity was the reason why Immortal Gate fell back then - a malicious act from a mighty being.

Of course, Li Qiye didn’t need the formation anyway. He simply activated it again in order to grant Eight-stallion Dynasty perpetual prosperity and peace.

Firerage has yet to see the formation in action but he could sense wonderful profundities contained within. He regained his composure and asked: “Your Highness, so the primal ancestor of Immortal Gate created this formation?”

He hasn’t heard of this so-called primal ancestor before. It seemed that this monument contained many earth-shattering secrets.

“The primal ancestor does not belong to Immortal Gate.” Li Qiye smiled: “It is a being from the three races and even the hundred races.”

“I see…” Firerage murmured: “Are you implying that they were all from the same race once?”

Li Qiye chuckled and stared at him: “Who else can create life but the high heaven? These races didn’t come out of thin air.”

Firerage contemplated in silence. In the six continents, there was a divide between The Race and The People.

In general, The Race included heaveners, diviners, and devils. However, it also had tribes from the hundred races. Thus, one could say that those on the side of Celestial Court were part of this faction. Everything else was known as The People or sinners.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This started during the First Heaven War in a distant epoch. Celestial Court condemned many races as sinners. The lucky survivors on the other side called themselves The People instead.

Nonetheless, other races outside of the three ancient ones still sided with The Race. The three considered themselves superior to the rest. In terms of bloodline, they believed that they were the children of the high heaven.

“Your Highness, do you mean that all races from our world were born at the same time?” Firerage asked.

“There are a few exceptions.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Which ones?” He asked.

Li Qiye stared at the horizon for a bit before answering: “Blood, Ghost, and Forsaken Blood.”

Firerage murmured these names. Forsaken Blood was a foreign one to him.

“Ancient Ming as well.” Li Qiye added.

“Why are they exceptions?” Firerage asked.

He knew about the Blood and Ghost, not Forsaken Blood and Ancient Ming.

“They weren’t created by the high heaven.” Li Qiye said.

Firerage became startled after learning this. It was just one sentence yet contained numerous possibilities.

“Lunatics always exist.” Li Qiye said.

“Are they not allowed to exist in this world?” Firerage asked, also not knowing who Li Qiye was referring to. He had heard legends about the Blood and Ghost before.

By this point, he had nothing but admiration for Li Qiye’s erudite knowledge.

“Not quite, the villainous heaven is rather merciful in this regard, or just plain emotionless about other beings.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Then is this legend true?” Firerage became curious. Intuition told him that Li Qiye knew the answer: “That the ancestors of the Blood were blood-sucking monsters and Ghosts are a hybrid between evil fiends and humans.”

“Who knows?” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “They all started from a single madman.”

“A madman?” This was also new information to Firerage. He had learned about the various theories regarding their origin. This was a new one.

“The world doesn’t know of this madman.” Li Qiye said, peering deeper into the hidden horizon: “Remember, the three ancient races aren’t superior to the rest. This notion only started due to the severing of the world.”

“They will keep on believing it.” Firerage said.

“Mere pride and arrogance.” Li Qiye said: “The four immortal bloodlines in this world came from the high heaven, not anyone else.”

“I see…” Firerage murmured. The dao lord had researched bloodlines extensively and told him about these bloodlines before.

They included Human-monarch, Heaven-authority, Divine-eternal, and Devil-bestowment. These were foreign concepts at this point since they rarely showed up.

They have been around during a timeworn epoch, not a result of regular reproduction and evolution. Just by their names alone, one could see a connection between them and the four races’ origins.

“Well, this is all in the past, no need to dwell on it.” Li Qiye said as he gazed at the monument: “It is time to activate this.”

“How?” Firerage didn’t understand the monument at all.

“We’re missing one thing.” Li Qiye said.

“Your Highness, we have excavated all the pieces and brought them here.” Firerage said.
