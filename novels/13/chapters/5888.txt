Chapter 5888: Not One Person

Overlords, regardless of their power, couldn’t escape his judgment. He allowed two choices - committing suicide in an honorable manner and sparing himself from more pain versus the alternative.

Li Qiye showed no mercy when refining Primal’s group, extracting as much pain as possible before reducing them to essences.

Twilight took a deep breath and suggested: “Dark Crow, we can talk first. Release me and I will never appear again.”

“What makes you think you can negotiate with me?” Li Qiye smirked.

“I’ve always had a sophisticated palate.” Twilight said.

“True, definitely more so than Epoch’s End and the others. Without this, you wouldn’t have succeeded back in Dingtian’s epoch, such a brilliant and wise cultivator.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and agreed.

With that, he glanced at the suppressed Trinity Ancestor and said: “You’ve wasted your talent. If you had reached the mental state of Dingtian, your dao heart wouldn’t have been broken in Heavenrealm.”

“That is my only regret, arriving there too early.” Trinity snorted.

“There’s no medicine for that.” Li Qiye playfully remarked before speaking to Twilight again: “I’m curious, how did you evade Dingtian? It was impossible even with the best stealth ability or completely changing yourself.”

Twilight didn’t wish to reveal his secret.

“This question bothered me for a long time and prompted a deep search. I’ve read accounts and perused the ruins. It’s conceivable that you can deceive the girl but to trick Dingtian for a fatal blow? It doesn’t make sense.” Li Qiye continued but still didn’t get an answer.

“Unfortunately, she died too early and didn’t see the final destruction. She did describe you to me though.” Li Qiye said.

Twilight’s eyes gleamed, realizing that he had left some clues behind.

“Yes, that’s the look of someone who had made a mistake.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Didn’t kill thoroughly enough.” Twilight said softly. He had never shown mercy but had lost his focus in that moment.

“That’s not the only slip-up. There were more clues so when I chose the location, I made a prediction as well.” Li Qiye said.

“What location?” Twilight felt something was off.

“It’s a long story, but after thinking carefully and considering the various factors, the key breakthrough was with the debate between light and darkness in Three Immortals. That’s when it became clear.” Li Qiye said.

“And what’s that?” Twilight asked.

“I figured out your origin and why you were able to deceive Dingtian.” Li Qiye revealed.

“How did I do it?” Twilight felt as if he had no secrets to speak of.

“Because you had help. Twilight Hunter, in a sense, is not a single person.” Li Qiye said.

“Not a single person?” Stonesplitter interjected in astonishment: “That doesn’t make sense.”

“Yes, he is not the sole survivor of his epoch and not the only heinous hunter either.” Li Qiye elaborated: “I suspected this previously but with Saint’s help, I made the first move.”

He glanced at Stonesplitter and continued: “Do you know why only one was present during the ambush of Divine Ancestor?”

“Why?” Stonesplitter was still taken aback.

“Because Divine Ancestor was still too weak. His flesh isn’t enough to share either.” Li Qiye smiled: “A peak Trinity Ancestor might be a different story. Unfortunately, they never got the chance.”

“Why is that?” World Emperor joined the conversation.

“Because of Saint.” Stonesplitter murmured.

“This underlying matter caused some confusion between the old geezers too.” Li Qiye said: “They saw the clues and knew that you weren’t alone. Well, you became alone after we killed him.”

“Perhaps I am not the only one still.” Twilight said softly.

“Another, sure, but not worth mentioning.” Li Qiye responded.

“Hmph.” The mild-tempered Twilight became frustrated.

“It is the truth.” Li Qiye smiled: “When light and darkness are twins, the question is who is older? How can there be a balance between the two sides? Thus, one is always deformed and weaker.”

Everyone could sense Twilight’s emotions fluctuating despite his veiled appearance.

“I’ll go on, light and darkness are incompatible. If the light is too strong, it will eliminate the darkness. But, what if they co-exist in a strange state with deliberate balancing? The light feeding the darkness and vice versa.” Li Qiye said.

He paused for a moment before staring at Twilight and asking: “Are you the light or darkness?”

Everyone stared at Twilight, awaiting an answer despite their confusion.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
