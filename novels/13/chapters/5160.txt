Chapter 5161: You Are Not Qualified

Spectators on both sides saw the beauty of life in the duo’s love. Thus, they excitedly cheered for the interference.

After calming down, they saw a black piece rotating in the air and realized that this was the culprit.

How could this be?! The thing that broke the barrier was a mere go piece?! [1]

Everyone thought that it would be a conqueror with at least ten dao fruits or a similar master.

“Thank you, Sir.” Windchaser and Harkrain regained their wits and understood who it was right away - Li Qiye.

Heavenly Sword Conqueror and Sacred Sword Monarch became alarmed. The ancient emperor shrouded by the black clouds also stood up.

“Who are you?!” Heavenly Sword roared.

“You are not qualified to speak with me.” Li Qiye continued playing his match with Jun Landu.

The trio and the crowd were shaken by this domineering declaration.

This was a common phrase by top cultivators against an opposing junior. The problem was that Heavenly Sword had six dao fruits, not an unknown junior.

Nonetheless, this person took down two mighty barriers with a single go piece - a testament to his strength.

“Who is it?” This was the question in everyone’s mind.

“All-things Dao Lord? Or Azure Ancestor?” Someone speculated.

“No, they would show themselves or be here already.” A powerful dragon lord who had met these two beings before shook his head.

“Then who is it?” Many tried to come up with a name among the top emperors and conquerors.

“Another ancient emperor, maybe?” Another wondered.

In theory, someone this strong should be renowned since he might have a golden avatar already.

“Who might you be, Sir? There is no need to hide like this.” An ancient voice came from the black clouds.

“Sunshroud, know your place.” Li Qiye’s supreme voice descended from the sky.

“Boom!” He made his move by reaching for the black clouds while still in the courtyard.

“Activate!” The ancient emperor activated all eight Heaven’s Wills for protection. It felt as if the sky itself was a barrier.

Alas, this was not enough to stop Li Qiye’s attack. An explosion dispersed the clouds and the conqueror was revealed while spitting out blood.

He wore a black robe and had a muscular frame. There seemed to be a sun within him, causing his eyes to pulse brightly.

Others couldn’t help but want to prostrate due to the power of the Heaven’s Wills.

“Sunshroud Divine Emperor!” An old dragon lord recognized him. [2]

Rumor has it that this emperor was alive even before Immemorial War and had created a sect.

“Looks like you haven’t wasted your life, to gain another five wills.” Li Qiye’s voice loomed above.

According to the legend, the emperor only had three Heaven’s Wills but later on, fortune blessed him with another five.

“Who are you?” Sunshroud became confused because the assailant clearly knew him. This meant that this was another being from time immemorial.

He feared anyone who had lived this long because there were some horrifying characters - Purewood Divine Emperor, Immortal Emperor Fei Yang, Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan…

These characters were all above his level. There were even more frightening masters that have started the journey and were no longer around - Immortal Emperor Min Ren, Origin Heaven Emperor…

There were too many possibilities for him to pinpoint.

“Who I am does not matter. The important thing is that my mood is soured by the three of you. Now, be smart and cripple one grand dao. I shall forgive you then.” Li Qiye said, causing everyone to gasp.

Even Supreme, All-things, Sword Queen, and Azure wouldn’t make this statement. After all, they were in the same cultivation realm; it’s just that some were stronger than others. No conqueror or emperor would accept such humiliation.

“This is my first time hearing this since my debut.” Sacred Sword Monarch was furious.

Was this a joke?! Even Supreme couldn’t command him to do so!

“Come out and fight, we are waiting!” He shouted.

They then looked around, wanting to see the identity of this terrifying opponent. As accomplished cultivators, there was no way they would submit before seeing the opponent.

“I shall not show mercy then.” Li Qiye stated and reached for the monarch.

“Die!” The latter roared and summoned an ocean of swords around him for a flawless defense.

Unfortunately, the massive walls crumbled before Li Qiye’s invisible hand and he was caught.

“Heavenly Sword Annihilation!” The conqueror became startled and joined the battle.

A heavenly sword capable of untold destruction manifested into reality and swung forward.

“Boundless Darkness!” Sunshroud Divine Emperor released black clouds toward the invisible hand.

“Boom!” Alas, their impressive techniques were useless, unable to save the monarch from the tight grip.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
