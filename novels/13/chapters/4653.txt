Chapter 4654: Immortal Gemstone

The sounds from the gemstone had a soul-purifying property. One could never get tired of listening. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Its radiance exceeded anything else the world had to offer. It robbed all the other lights and became the only brightness around. Its rays could pierce through time itself.

If all the stars in the sky were to explode at once, the resulting explosions would also be blinding. However, they wouldn’t penetrate as far as the rays from the gemstone.

Spectators felt an agonizing pain in their eyes, on the verge of becoming blind.

“My eyes, my eyes!” Powerful cultivators screamed in pain and couldn’t see anything while blood streamed down the sockets.

Worst of all, the rays didn’t target anyone yet they already had this level of effect from long range.

“Boom!” The emperor embedded the gemstone onto his gauntlet and punched the sky.

This time around, his attack carried an apocalyptic force. All living beings within a radius of ten million miles became suppressed. This included all the beasts and birds as well. Everything dropped to the ground, paralyzed.

Even ancient ancestors couldn’t move an inch. An instinctive fear robbed their freedom; only subservience remained.

“What the hell is this…” A pale ancestor murmured while his face was touching the ground.

“I don’t recognize this power.” The remote regions of Sky Border also felt this force and stared in the direction of Worldbreaker.

Ancient existences underground woke up right away, wondering about the source of the power.

“A dao lord in this generation already?” An ancient ancestor became startled.

“What is this treasure?” Another climbed out of her grave and observed the fluctuation.

In a starry area situated in Inner Ruins, a monster looked over and murmured: “This thing… unique and unbeatable.”

“Imagine the gains…” A pair of eyes in a dark void opened.

“The world is changing.” A peerless existence buried among the stars murmured.

Normally, top beings were lords of their regions. Those living nearby had no choice but to obey their orders. Fear was not an emotion known to them until now. This power assaulted their dao heart and made them waver.

The conquerors felt the same way. Due to their status, they had seen or even wielded patrimony weapons before. Alas, they never felt something like this before.

This power gradually dispersed after the punch. After a long while, cultivators regained their wits.

They stared at Worldbreaker and saw nothing different about it. Both the gigantic hand and the emperor have disappeared without a trace.

“Does anyone know what’s going on?” Regular cultivators were completely lost since they were suppressed from the very beginning.

“The power of the gemstone.” A high ancestor managed to see the punch: “Golden Fist Emperor used one and pierced the hand. He made it out.”

“That gemstone must have fallen down from an immortal world.” Another ancestor said: “Otherwise, how could it have pierced that hand?”

“So this is what he got from Worldbreaker! An ultimate stone!” Someone from a sacred ground shouted.

Prior to this, they knew that he had gotten something amazing but that’s it. There was a clear lack of information. Now, witnessing its power incited their greed again.

“Imagining embedding that stone into a weapon, wouldn’t that make the user comparable to a dao lord? No, even greater…” A big shot murmured.

The emperor couldn’t stop a single move from the gigantic hand. However, embedding the gemstone into his gauntlet allowed him to pierce through it. This spoke plenty about the potential of the gemstone.
