Chapter 4863: The Traitorous Qian

Purewood Divine Emperor’s era was so long ago. Few remembered his tales and legends. 

All in all, anything before Immortal City was unknown to current inhabitants. However, this title was brought up more often thanks to the existence of Immortal City.

Some believed that he was the reason why The People and The Race could co-exist peacefully, to an extent.

Firerage learned a few things from Eight-stallion Dao Lord. Rumor has it that Purewood was around during the previous epoch - the first of the mighty Grand Emperors.

“Someone before Purewood Divine Emperor?” Firerage quietly asked.

“The start of the imperial line didn’t come from him.” Li Qiye looked back down at Firerage and answered.

“Then who is it?” Firerage became emotional since this was an entirely new perspective.

“Authority Heavenly Emperor.” Li Qiye revealed.

“Authority?” Firerage murmured. This was different than what the dao lord had told him.

Between an unknown cultivator versus a knowledgeable dao lord, for some strange reason, he actually believed Li Qiye instead of His Majesty. 

He himself didn’t understand why but this was his intuition. It certainly confused him.

“It’s understandable that you haven’t heard of him. He was the creator of an amazing sect that dominated the races.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What is its name?” Firerage calmed down and asked.

“Immortal Gate.” Li Qiye said. [1]

“Immortal Gate?” Firerage thought that this was a simple yet domineering name.

Sects didn’t dare to use the word “immortal” most of the time. Only ignorant fools or true monsters would include this in their title.

The latter meant that the sect must have been frightening.

“It’s a sect with nine emperors, completely unbeatable before the Qian clan.” Li Qiye elaborated.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Qian? The traitors?” Firerage blurted out.

“That Qian.” Something flashed deep in Li Qiye’s eyes after mentioning this last name. He then asked: “Who condemned them as traitors?”

Firerage took a deep breath and shook his head: “Your Highness, I don’t know much about this part of history. The Race considers it taboo, and the People knows even less about it. It was just too long ago to do any effective research.”

“Celestial Court.” Li Qiye murmured before pondering in silence.

After a while, he touched the cliff again and the embedded runes on the surface floated around his palm.

“Your Highness, am I correct in assuming that Immortal Gate used to be here?” Firerage asked.

“Yes, this was where it gave orders to all races. Some say that it is older than Celestial Court.” Li Qiye nodded.

Firerage imagined a magnificent scene of a great lineage looming above all. Even the current Celestial Court couldn’t give orders to everyone.

“So how did it fall?” He asked even though rise-and-fall was only a matter of time for lineages. It’s just that this particular lineage had nine emperors. This made him rather curious.

“The emergence of another race.” Li Qiye said.

“Which one?” Firerage asked.

“Ancient Ming.” Li Qiye said.

“I’ve never heard of them before.” This was another unfamiliar name to Firerage. It didn’t seem to be a part of The People or The Race. How could a single race take down the most powerful force in the six continents?

“Also understandable. They are now, extinct.” Li Qiye smiled.

“How?” He asked - the same perplexing concept arose again.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t answer.

During this conversation, Firerage felt so inadequate before Li Qiye as if he was a young child asking his teacher questions.

It seemed silly but Firerage had no other way to describe this. His Majesty only knew that this place once belonged to a great sect. However, Li Qiye knew far more about it. For example, His Majesty had no idea about the Ancient Ming or Authority Heavenly Emperor. 

Firerage didn’t think Li Qiye was making this up either. The question became - how did a junior know all of these ancient secrets?

“Your Highness, how do you know all of this?” Firerage had to ask.

“The more you read, the more you know.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Uh…” Firerage felt as if he had never read a book before.

Plus, he didn’t think that these secrets came from books either. No ancient scrolls available now depicted these matters. He gradually felt that His Majesty picked Li Qiye for a particular reason.

Li Qiye didn’t pay attention to the puzzled guard. He closed his eyes and continued feeling the cliff.

Firerage suddenly had an illusion of Li Qiye disappearing from sight. However, his eyes told him otherwise - that Li Qiye was still standing there. It’s just that he seemed to be fusing with the mountain itself.
