Chapter 3528: Myriad Dao Heavenly Physique

The heavenly physique stood at the top of the dao. Star Ancient Ancestor has reached an unimaginable size.

Celestial lights exuded from him as if he was made from stars. Sure enough, people looked up and saw stars moving continuously within him. His body turned into a galaxy large enough to encompass three thousand worlds.

This form boosted one’s power to the limit by fusing it with the various grand dao. From this, the user would be able to cause untold destruction with one hand wave.

At this point, Star could stomp once and annihilate an entire country along with its inhabitants.

Though people have seen large transformations before such as avatars, there was a clear disparity.

The other ones were large in form but this physique twisted the sky into one’s body and morphed the myriad dao into the veins and meridians.

The myriad dao served as fuels for his gigantic form. Each dao released loud explosions and powers. People couldn’t help wanting to prostrate before this powerful being. Some were paralyzed on the ground.

“Myriad Dao Heavenly Physique...” The spectators murmured the name.

This was the other path at the top of the dao. When top geniuses couldn’t become a dao lord, they would embark on a journey towards this form, one started by Space Dragon Emperor.

Unfortunately, very few actually made it here. Thus, seeing it in person was a glorious event for those in the audience.

“Clank.” Only one sword hymn could be heard. All the other swords regardless of their quality and type became silent, a sign of submission towards the skeletal sword.

As he raised the sword, it emitted a frightening murderous intent, thick enough to become visible strands. Anything that got in contact with these strands would be reduced to dust in the blink of an eye.

Not to mention ordinary cultivators, even ancestors wouldn’t dare to touch them. Other Heavenly Sovereigns also became intimidated.

The massive ancestor looked godly enough but with this sword, his terror reached the next height. Just one slash would be enough to prove his supremacy.

The spectators hurriedly fled from the battlefield. Even those paralyzed on the ground started crawling or rolling away.

They all knew how terrible this next attack would be. Just the remnant energy alone would reduce them to ashes regardless of their cultivation.

“Buzz.” The ancestor opened his eyes and beams shot out like heavenly waterfalls.

The dao heart of the spectators became defenseless right away; their soul left their body in fear so they bellowed.

“Perish!” He finally made his move with a vertical slash.

It split the sky vault open and revealed a white shade. Most importantly, anything touched by the murderous strands immediately turned into smoke - time and space, the myriad dao, or the cycles of nature.

“Shit!” Some people screamed.

“Rumble!” Li Qiye retaliated by raising his hand. Three thousand worlds soared forward to stop the incoming slash. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Boom!” They were far from enough and immediately turned to smoke. Not even dust or ashes were left behind.

The sword itself finally made contact with the ground, splitting the earth into two. The territory affected immediately dissipated.

It was as if the whole region simply dispersed from existence - the mountains and rivers. Only emptiness was left behind.

The spectators became frozen, thinking about their fate if they were caught in that area. Words couldn’t describe its power. The most applicable example would be that if its target were Ancestral City, the entire sect would disappear from this world.

Thus, this meant that one slash alone was enough to erase a top sect in the north. Its power was terrifying.

“I think he’s dead this time.” Many gazed at the empty expanse and didn’t see Li Qiye.

They saw his three thousand worlds evaporating and the slash made direct contact with the ground. It would be strange if he were to survive that dreadful attack.

“I would have nothing to say if he were to survive, he would be the most devilish man in the world.” An expert murmured.

Others agreed with this statement. One ancestor nodded: “If he survives this slash, everyone should just go to sleep, no need to compete or try to become a dao lord or anything, it’ll be none other than him.”

Most spectators thought that Li Qiye had no chance of surviving due to the might of the slash. However, they held onto a sliver of hope for a miracle despite the low possibility.

“Buzz.” Chaos suddenly emanated from the damaged void.

This heralded the reconstruction of the world. Everything returned to the origin; the myriad living beings returned along with the dao orders...

This chaos light illuminated the void and chased away any broken affinity. The mountains and rivers appeared once more as if time was being reversed.

The crowd couldn’t help being stunned. Eventually, a figure emerged.

“Li Qiye, it’s Li Qiye!” They were mentally prepared for this possibility yet they still screamed all the same with their eyes wide open in astonishment.
