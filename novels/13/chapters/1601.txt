Yu Qingfeng was the ancestral grandmother of the Yu Clan, the first general of the Black Dragon Legion during Immortal Emperor Yin Tian’s generation. She was prominent as an Emperor Assailant, a truly dreadful existence.

“Qingfeng greets you, Your Excellency.” After calming down, the old woman quickly prostrated on the ground and exclaimed.

Li Qiye quickly helped her up and said: “You are no longer part of the legion so this ceremony is unnecessary.”

After being propped up, she looked at the youth while gripping his hands. After a long time, she finally touched his face.

“Your Excellency, you have truly gotten your real body.” She said emotionally.

“It is to the Black Dragon King’s credit.” He gently sighed: “He went all out and sacrifice the Heaven’s Will in order to get out with my body, then my soul and spirits returned.”

“Your subordinate is ashamed, not being able to aid the dragon king and you.” She sighed.

When the Black Dragon King attacked the Immortal Demon Grotto, she was still undergoing her death cultivation and couldn’t lend him a hand. Otherwise, she would have participated.

“It’s not your fault.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Your lifespan was over back then so it’s already amazing for you to last till now. Hmm, looks like you won’t be able to live for another life, but this death cultivation will at least replenish your lost longevity.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She became dejected and answered: “The reason I can do this is all because of the old man. He used his own life to replenish mine but he...” She sighed again and stopped.

“He has always loved you and it was his choice.” Li Qiye said.

“We promised to live till the end together regardless of mundane matters but in the end, our descendants are incompetent so the old man changed his mind. He hoped that I could live longer to protect them. It’s just that the fools don’t know our trouble and sacrifices!” She became gloomier.

Her husband was also a general under the Black Dragon Legion though he wasn’t as strong as her. The lovers decided against sealing themselves and chose to live an ordinary life until death together.

Alas, their descendants deteriorated one generation after another. Only Ancestor Yu in this generation was capable of doing anything. After him, the Yu Clan had no talents to speak of.

This made her husband change his mind. He decided to let her live longer to protect their clan for a few more generations. Thus, during the end of her lifespan, he helped with the life replenishment.

Despite the successful attempt, her husband couldn’t surpass this ultimate trial so he sacrificed himself for her sake.

“How many people in this world can see through death so easily and let go?” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

She invited her into the old shrine. It was also very simple inside with a few carved diagrams to the left and right. They were the historical records of the Yu Clan’s ancestors.

She sat down and spoke: “I’m sure you will be able to do a lot with your real body in this generation, Your Excellency. If you need my assistance, just stay the word. I shall exert all my power for you once more.”

Li Qiye refused: “No, the two of you have gained freedom and left the legion so I won’t break your tranquility. It’s time for you to enjoy old age instead of being a part of my war chariot.”

“I owe you that much, Your Excellency. Without you, I wouldn’t be who I am today, no, I wouldn’t be alive either. The Yu Clan wouldn’t be so prosperous as well.” She solemnly said.

“You don’t owe me anything.” Li Qiye smiled: “I merely guided you and gave you a chance. What you have achieved is due to your own efforts and furthermore, you have paid everything by working in the legion for so long already. And remember, I only did a little bit to help. Your big brother is who actually saved you.”

Yu Zhengfeng sealed his sister back then and spent an entire generation to accumulate enough materials before asking Li Qiye to save her. Because of this fateful encounter, they joined the Black Dragon Legion. After many victories and meritorious contributions, Matriarch Yu became the first general of the legion.

“It’s all because you showed love for me and our clan.” She gently sighed.

At this moment, she was willing to come out again to work for Li Qiye and same with her clan. However, he wouldn’t agree to this.

“This is what you and your clan deserve.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“It’s a pity that the juniors are so incompetent. Otherwise, this wouldn’t be happening to me. Big brother doesn’t want to look at these unworthy children so my old bones have no choice but to live on in this sad manner.”

“Zhengfeng can still live for a very long time.” Li Qiye nodded: “Alas, he has the World-weary Dao. It’s understandable that he doesn’t care for the descendants. In his eyes, the Yu Clan doesn’t need his attention.”

“Big brother...” She became sad when talking about her brother.

No one might remember a famous character like Yu Zhengfeng in the current generation, an Emperor Contender hiding in Discover.

But Matriarch Yu will always remember. Zhengfeng started on this invincible path just to save his beloved sister back then.

“Big brother didn’t use to be like this back then. He was a bright and energetic person on top of being very magnanimous but the trial of love overwhelmed him. He grew tired and no longer care for mundane matters.” She stated.

“No.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Your big brother has made peace with his failed love for Immortal Emperor Qian Li. His inner demon isn’t about love but himself. After choosing this dao, it is exceedingly difficult to turn back. The farther he went, the stronger he became and the more he grew tired of mortal issues. In the end, he became cursed, not even the heavens want to take him.”

“He’ll have to stay this way?” She had to ask. She didn’t wish for him to suffer such a dark fate in the upcoming years.

“No one can help him if he doesn’t want to leave.” Li Qiye shook his head: “He knew what he was getting himself into and what he would have to face. Because of this, he fought against Immortal Emperor Qian Li back then one last time but she didn’t want to kill him.”

“He probably made up his mind to walk on that imperial dao just to save me back then.” She smiled bitterly, realizing the price her brother paid just to save her.

“He created his own grand dao back then. In fact, it was a very amazing one so he had escaped the World-weary Dao yet he returned again. His choice was the same as Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo.” Li Qiye commented.

“Mu Zhuo was an emperor then so his fortune and cultivation were greater than your big brother but he still went back to this terrible dao to be forever cursed. It was their choice, no one can do anything about it.” Li Qiye smiled wryly as well.

“Why did the emperor choose this path? He already had an imperial way.” Matriarch Yu didn’t quite understand.

The emperor’s grand dao was enough to shoulder the Heaven’s Will. It was a mighty and unstoppable path. But in the end, he gave up this dao and chose his previous World-weary Dao. No one could imagine such a choice.

“I don’t know. I’m afraid no one knows the reason either, just some guesses.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Some believe that he did it to live even longer. Or maybe this is a type of running away. However, I don’t think so.”

“Then what’s the reason?” She asked.

Li Qiye pondered for a bit before answering: “I don’t know either. We’ll have to ask the emperor himself in order to find the answer but if he won’t tell anyone else, there’s no way to know then.”
