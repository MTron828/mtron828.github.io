Chapter 5060: What Is This Thing?

What was the difference between then and now? Or did the agreement come afterward the massacre?

Everyone was curious but didn’t dare to ask lest they provoke her. Ten lives wouldn’t be enough then.

“I am not here to kill.” She said calmly before staring at Li Qiye.

Everyone watched with bated breath, only Li Qiye had an unaffected demeanor.

“You have something.” She said. Her aura was chilling to others but Li Qiye found it pleasant like a gust of wind on a sunny day.

“I have many things, you need to be specific.” Li Qiye smiled.

The crowd thought that he was the only one who would dare to talk to her like this with the exception of the late Eight-stallion Dao Lord.

“Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s.” Her tone remained neutral but this caused a ripple in everyone’s mind.

She had asked the dao lord for an item but he chose death instead. Was this the reason for their perpetual conflict?

Conceal Conqueror still didn’t give up and traveled to Demon for its sake. Many speculated about the nature and grade of the item.

“I know what you’re referring to now.” Li Qiye stretched and said: “And?”

His relaxed and casual style was acceptable to everyone now because he had the power to back it up.

“I will take it.” She left no room for negotiation.

“I’m afraid you don’t have the ability since I want it.” Li Qiye said.

Listeners recalled how he easily killed Golden Mosquito. What would be the result of a fight between Li Qiye and Conceal Conqueror?

“I am not the only one.” Conceal stared at him for a bit before adding: “Even if I don’t try, others will come for it and you won’t be able to stop them.”

This revealed ample information to the top experts. They knew that she had been blessed by Celestial Court before - something exceedingly rare in history.

Perhaps this blessing came with a cost - a mission of sorts. Did Celestial Court covet this item as well?

“Talking about Celestial Court?” Li Qiye chuckled and shared the same thought as everyone else.

“Not only.” She coldly uttered.

The meticulous listeners couldn’t believe it. This meant that there were other factions comparable to Celestial Court at play here.

Everyone immediately thought of Immortal Dao City and Imperial Field. All of them had incredible resources - the best of the best treasures and weapons. Items at the imperial level were common there, they even had access to “immortal” treasures.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The crowd thought of one possibility - an item pertaining to immortality.

“A few more enemies don’t matter to me.” Li Qiye shrugged: “Are you going to try or not?”

“I must.” She said: “On the night of the full moon, Heaven Summit, until death, yes?”

The details of the challenge have been suggested. Now, would Li Qiye accept it? This would be a fight of an unprecedented level in the lower continents.

“Very well, I do want to see how much you have learned.” Li Qiye smiled.

The crowd thought that he had the right to say this to Conceal Conqueror given his recent battle achievements.

“Next full moon, Heaven Summit, until death.” She said before disappearing from sight.

In the next second, the chilling aura disappeared as well, meaning that she was no longer inside Demon.

“Incredible speed.” The ancient ancestors couldn’t follow her movements at all despite activating their heavenly gaze.

“Next full moon, Heaven Summit.” The crowd murmured and became excited.

This news would spread across the lower continents in no time at all - a battle between Li Qiye and Conceal Conqueror.

This was just as exciting as her fight with Eight-stallion Dao Lord. This time, her opponent was a newcomer but this didn’t mean that he was any less impressive than the dao lord.
