Chapter 3821: Idiot

By this point, certain justifications existed for killing Li Qiye. It was tough to defend him when he worked with Xu Cuimei in taking down the statue.

Normally, he was untouchable by virtue of being the saber messenger of Vajra. Nonetheless, Sword Hero had both status and power.

If he actually wanted to kill Li Qiye, the latter being the saber messenger didn’t matter as much.

“None of your goddamn business.” Li Qiye glanced at him and said dismissively.

The vulgarity surprised the crowd. No one would speak in this manner when talking to such an important character like Sword Hero.

Sword Hero naturally didn’t accept the disrespect from Li Qiye. His murderous intent was as thick as can be, not bothering to hide it in the slightest.

“Brat, do you think your status can save you? You can’t do as you please just because you have him as a backer.” The rays in Sword Hero’s eyes could pierce the heart.

People were curious to know who “him” was. As an outsider, Li Qiye clearly had a backer in order to become the saber messenger. It had to be an ancestor from the temple, at the very least.

This was rather important since it could decide how other powers would treat Li Qiye in the future.

“Idiot, you’re blinder than a junior. I don’t need any backer to do as I please.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“How audacious, well, let’s see if you can back up your confidence. I will teach you a lesson and let you know that a member of Vajra can’t...”

“I’m not a member of Vajra, don’t flatter yourselves.” Li Qiye interrupted him and said: “Plus, how are you going to teach anyone a lesson when you have no skill to speak of? Where is your confidence coming from?”

The crowd took a deep breath after hearing this. Some smiled wryly in response. Li Qiye was this arrogant when dealing with Phantom and Hu Ben. Now, he was even more aggressive when speaking to Sword Hero, someone far above those two juniors.

Some who have been watching him got so used to it that they didn’t think twice.

“Ignorant brat, this isn’t the same as before. Sword Hero is a grandmaster!” One youth scowled.

“He’ll regret it soon enough.” Another added.

“He can’t take on His Highness even if he’s on the same level as Righteous Scion. His tongue will be the death of him.” One more assessed.

The more Sword Hero listened, the stronger his murderous intent became - virtually enough to freeze the area around him. The crowd’s experience worsened by the second due to the unbearable nature of his aura.

“This murderous intent is unreal.” One ancestor commented, thinking about backing off.

It became apparent that Sword Hero would kill Li Qiye at all costs today.

“No one will be able to save him.” Someone from the same generation as Sword Hero commented. He knew Sword Hero too well - this was a guy who would keep his words.

Sword Hero has been holding back before Archaic Sun King. Now, he had a venting target who kept on fanning the fire.

He stared at Li Qiye as if the guy was a dead man and uttered coldly: “Brat, give it everything you got. Let’s see how many moves you can survive. This date next year will be your death anniversary.”

“You’re taking the words out of my mouth.” Li Qiye wiped both of his hands clean and said: “I think you’ll last one or two moves at best.”

“What?!” Some audience members blurted.

“Is, is he serious?” One guy thought that this was unreasonable even for Li Qiye.

“This is Sword Hero he’s facing here.” One youth added.

“How is he so confident?” An ancestor shook his head.

Sword Hero wasn’t Phantom or Hu Ben. Li Qiye’s devilishness shouldn’t be enough to make this claim.

“Can anyone in the world defeat Sword Hero that quickly?” An older expert asked.

Most thought that only an invincible dao lord would be able to do so.

“A supreme might not be able to do that either.” A clan ancestor replied.

The crowd thought of two candidates right away - Buddha Supreme and Righteous Supreme.

However, even powerful cultivators like them might not be able to defeat Sword Hero so quickly.

“Hmph, anyone can boast.” A youth sneered. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Your Highness, show him the immensity of heaven and earth, teach him a lesson!” A genius shouted.

“That’s not enough, just kill him!” Someone else had a bone-deep hatred towards Li Qiye for some unknown reason.

At this point, Sword Hero’s eyes exuded a terrible beam, capable of piercing through the earth.
