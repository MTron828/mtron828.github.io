Chapter 4988: Wheel Of Time

“Plus, it’s rather dangerous here, I don’t think you should linger around.” Goldcrest eventually concluded.

Greenmountain Conqueror was somehow even more talented than Conceal Conqueror. Moreover, he came after becoming a dao lord already. Therefore, Songke’s chances weren’t favorable in the slightest.

He was definitely a genius of this generation, being an Immortal Sovereign and all. Alas, this was Demon - the home of countless demons and ferocious beasts.

Goldcrest himself didn’t dare to travel to all the dangerous locations despite growing up here and being blessed by Tiger Deity. 

Plenty of demon monarchs could kill him. In fact, even an unknown colossal demon could come out of nowhere and devour intruders.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

An outsider like Qing Songke searching for something in Demon? This was akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack while being hunted by numerous lions.

“I know you mean well.” Songke understood this as well, especially after having been captured by the python demon earlier.

“I will pay you back for saving me in the next life because I must avenge my father.” Qing Songke bowed to Li Qiye and cupped his fist at the others before leaving.

“Go.” Li Qiye waved his hand and said, not really interested in the repayment or the vengeance. The youth had a long way to go before being qualified for either.

“Sigh, he is still not giving up.” Goldcrest shrugged after seeing this, thinking that the youth was suicidal to stay in Demon.

“Well, his father was despicable with all the ambushes.” Ming Shi snorted since she despised Reincarnation City Lord.

“A son must avenge his father, this is a part of life. Cultivators are not different from mortals, we follow the same convention. If he were to give up, others would chastise him for it forever.” Yunyun shook her head.

No one could disagree with this logic because it was the truth. Songke had to do something or people would call him a coward for not daring to face Li Qiye for such a noble goal.

Therefore, he needed to at least give it a shot despite how futile it was. Otherwise, he would have a demon in his heart for the rest of his life.

“What’s in the treasury?” Li Qiye was interested in Blazing Conqueror.

“It had everything.” Yunyn answered: “Historical scrolls state that this treasury is larger than anyone can imagine. Those close to Blazing Conqueror got lucky as well even before he rose to prominence. He gave everyone treasures and merit laws.”

“Yes, as long as you can think of it, it will be in that treasury.” Goldcrest joined in: “Demons have tried only to fail, the lucky conqueror became the winner in the end.”

“So who left such a great treasury behind?” Ming Shi asked.

Yunyun and Goldcrest couldn’t answer because they haven’t thought of this before.

Not long ago, Jin Shaobai had obtained Benevolence containing the resources of Immemorial Palace. This was a supreme treasury even in the eyes of Deity.

However, Blazing Conqueror’s treasury might be ten times larger in comparison. Thus, who left it behind? Even a dao lord or conqueror couldn’t do so.

“Are you interested in the treasury, Young Noble?” Ming Shi smiled cheerfully while asking Li Qiye.

“Anything worthwhile must have been taken already.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “Hmm, was there any notable artifact?”

“Well…” The young ones pondered.

The knowledgeable Yunyun clapped her hands and said: “I’ve heard that there is an artifact known as Wheel of Time. This allowed the young conqueror to fight against emperors even before obtaining a single dao fruit.” 

“Isn’t there a mountain with a similar name in Reincarnation?” Ming Shi asked.

“Mountain of the Ages is actually a great sect. Greenmountain Conqueror came from there.” Goldcrest elaborated.

“Ah, that’s right. Wow, Rooster, you know so much despite being in this remote region.” Ming Shi praised.

“What else can I do here but read?” Goldcrest smiled wryly.

“Wheel of Time?” Li Qiye murmured quietly and said: “Not bad, old geezer.” 

“Did you say something, Young Noble?” Yunyun asked.

“It’s nothing, let’s go.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

The group went on, traversing a mountain range.

After a while, Li Qiye frowned and stopped.

“What’s the matter, Young Noble?” Yunyun asked.

Li Qiye chuckled and said: “Shadowrider was born here in Demon.”

“How so?” Goldcrest asked.

“Our presence is known.” Li Qiye said.

“Where?!” Ming Shi became afraid and looked around.

The other two did the same because they were still frightened of the notorious assassin, not wanting to be killed from the shadows.

“Not here but the methods of concealment and paths have been changing continuously.” Li Qiye said: “We aren’t being watched right now, this is definitely a special awareness only available to those from Demon.”

“I see…” Goldcrest found this hard to believe.
