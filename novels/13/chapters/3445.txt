Ancestor Lu’s confusion grew. He didn’t know how Li Qiye controlled the stone regardless of how much thought he put into it.

Moreover, he knew that Li Qiye also opened Foolish Stone and obtained a stone egg.

Just one of these events could be considered a coincidence or that the guy was extremely lucky. However, both of them happened with the same man. This was no coincidence nor a stroke of fortune.

Say, the guy wasn’t a dao lord or a heaven-defying existence. This meant that he had an unbelievable method or ability. This was the thing eluding Ancestor Lu. He couldn’t come up with an ability capable of controlling the stone tablet.

On the other hand, the whole blood-ceremony thing with Foolish was at least plausible.

In reality, many tried the same thing after Li Qiye had left - dropping their blood on the stones at the park. None found success.

The ancestor stared at Li Qiye, even going as far as using his heavenly gaze. Alas, the guy was truly at the Silver Carapace realm.

“Young Noble, please forgive me for overstepping my bounds but given your power, I can’t fathom how you lifted that tablet.”

He spoke earnestly and didn’t go around in circles with Li Qiye.

“It’s because you don’t know enough about your patriarch.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We don’t?” The ancestor didn’t expect this response. Anyone else saying this would prompt the ancestor to laugh, warranting a prompt rebuttal.

He has been in charge of the canonical texts in the city, granting him vast knowledge and insight. Moreover, he naturally knew his own race better than outsiders.

On the contrary, he didn’t know how to respond when Li Qiye made this claim.

“Do you know the origin of Golem Ancestor?” Li Qiye asked casually.

“Hmm...” The ancestor couldn’t answer. The same for Qing Shi standing nearby.

The texts didn’t contain information about their patriarch’s origin and roots. They only knew that he was a golem and had magnificent achievements.

“You, you know about this, Young Noble?” Ancestor Lu spoke with uncertainty in his tone.

“Yes.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Impossible!” The ancestor blurted out since this was his first reaction. He then calmed down and realized that he was being rude.

This reaction was rather understandable. No one in history had a clue about Golem Ancestor’s origin. How could this young outsider have the answer?

Qing Shi felt the same way at first. However, he thought about recent events and all the clues. Perhaps Li Qiye actually knew.

“I apologize. Can you tell me more about this, Young Noble?” The ancestor took a deep breath and sincerely asked.

“No.” Li Qiye refused right away.

“Young Noble, Ancestral City will show you the most generous appreciation.” The ancestor became disappointed and tried to convince him. Knowing the origin of their patriarch would be immensely beneficial.

“Really now? What can you give me to show your appreciation?” Li Qiye had a half-smile while staring at the ancestor.

“Just name the price. We’ll satisfy your demand as long as it is within our ability.” The ancestor saw hope and jumped on it. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’m afraid you won’t be able to satisfy my wish.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Go ahead and let me know, Young Noble. You won’t lose anything from it.” The ancestor pressed on.

“Well, it’s not that difficult to get. Just the underground area of your sect.” Li Qiye revealed.

“No!” It was the ancestor’s turn to refuse.

Li Qiye didn’t directly state the item but he knew what Li Qiye wanted.

Qing Shi had no idea what was going on. However, judging by Ancestor Lu’s firm attitude, it must be extremely important to Ancestral City.

“See? Plus, if I actually wanted to seize it, I wouldn’t tell you right now.” Li Qiye leisurely said.

The ancestor had a wry smile and gave up. This demand was impossible because they would become the sinners of the sect.

“How do you know about it, Young Noble?” The ancestor was surprised.

“Nothing can hide from my eyes, just like the origin of your forefather.” Li Qiye replied.

The ancestor only sighed in response.

“Will you need anything from us during this trip, Young Noble?” The ancestor said with a sincere expression.

“Why don’t you just ask me why I’m here?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“That’s not my intention.” The ancestor coughed awkwardly. He naturally wanted to know this but couldn’t be so blatant. He was afraid that Li Qiye might be scheming against his sect.

“Don’t worry, I’m not here for Ancestral. There’s just something that flew into the stone forest.” Li Qiye revealed.

“The treasury of Immortal Assailant Emperor!” Ancestor Lu realized Li Qiye’s goal. [1]

“That’s right.” Li Qiye smiled.

Qing Shi became shaken too. He has heard of legends about this treasury. The majority of the visitors here came for it.

“Let me give you a piece of advice. Forget about the treasury.” Li Qiye added.

The ancestor was shaken since this was definitely a warning.

Someone else trying this versus him would definitely be considered insulting and a challenge towards Ancestral City. This wasn’t the case here.

“Well, I can’t guarantee anything, Young Noble, but I will do my best.” The ancestor mused for a bit before answering.

“Sure, I know that you have an awakened pseudo-atavistic golem. That should be a little interesting, good enough for exercising.” Li Qiye chuckled. [2]

Both listeners were astounded. Qing Shi didn’t know at all but this was definitely a big deal. Ancestor Lu felt the same way. Only a few people in his sect knew about this.

Outsiders would be scared stiff to hear about it. However, they kept it a secret since they had their own plans.

“How do you know, Young Noble?” The ancestor took a deep breath.

“As I said, nothing can hide from my eyes.” Li Qiye said.

The ancestor had no response.

“Okay, if there’s nothing else, stop bothering me.” Li Qiye waved his hand and chased his guests out.

The ancestor bowed his head before bidding goodbye.

1. Changing Immortal Emperor Zhan to Immortal Assailant Emperor after new context. I thought his name scheme is the same as the Immortal Emperors, but Immortal here isn’t an adjective for emperor. Note #2, it turns out that he was an Immortal Emperor but this still makes more sense.

2. I don’t know if it’s single or plural here
