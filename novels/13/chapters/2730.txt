Zhiting and Jiahui appreciated the scrolls given to them by Li Qiye so they put in even more effort.

Ordinary disciples like them didn’t have the chance to obtain this level of merit laws, let alone training with them.

They were passed down by the progenitor so only elders and up were eligible to use them. This was all thanks to Li Qiye so they didn’t take the opportunity for granted.

Li Qiye guided them occasionally so this made the process even smoother. Willing students and a good teacher - a recipe for success.

They absorbed his teaching like sponges and fully exerted their hidden potential.

Zhiting was the more talented between the two. Moreover, she joined the sect earlier so her cultivation was considerably stronger as well.

However, after the polishment on the divine mountain, Jiahui obtained a higher limit on top of a firmer dao heart. Thus, she had more potential than the former.

All in all, the two sisters trained their heart out during this period. They competed while still offering each other full support so they improved like the wind. A friendship like this was rare and this experience only served to strengthen it.

The truth was that Mountguard had nothing worthy of entering Li Qiye’s sight. However, he was willing to stay for one simple reason - Longevity Forefather.

The guy no longer had a lineage in the nine worlds so this was Li Qiye’s way of remembrance on top of ending this karmic string.

Another person came to the courtyard to learn along with the two girls - Li Jiankun.

He knew that they were improving so quickly because of Li Qiye. This naturally tempted him because he wanted to have some achievements as well as the First Brother of Mountguard.

Alas, his current strength and situation right now made it hard to accomplish anything. Thus, he asked the two for a favor. They had a good impression of him so they let him come to ask Li Qiye for help.

Jiankun woke up very early this morning to take a clean shower and came in an official and respectful manner to see Li Qiye.

“This junior was blind to not see Mount Tai, please forgive me, Senior.” Jiankun got on his knees and apologized with sincerity: “My cultivation has stagnated and is full of flaws. Please give me a pointer or two.”

He kowtowed fully but Li Qiye remained asleep.

Nevertheless, the youth continued to kneel there. He knew that earning the guidance of a master wasn’t easy. One must have a sincere heart.

Alas, Li Qiye still didn’t respond. The two girls were used to this so they asked Jiankun to leave.

This failure didn’t deter him. He returned each day to greet Li Qiye with a kowtow while reporting his current cultivation status in full details.

Of course, this was unnecessary because Li Qiye could see everything about him.

Jiankun persevered for many days and Li Qiye still didn’t wake up. This process went on for a while until it became a habit.

Each day before training, Jiankun would come to see Li Qiye first for a report.

“Idiot.” He finally got a long-awaited response one morning.

“Senior!” Jiankun reacted as if this was the pleasant voice of a beautiful fairy. He showed full reverence and asked: “Please excuse my impudence. I am confused with my dao, please show me the way, Senior.”

“Your Soaring Immortal Sword Art is trained horribly, the fault of both your master’s teaching and your shitty comprehension.” Li Qiye spoke without opening his eyes: “Leave, don’t bother me anymore.”

Having said that, he flicked his finger and drilled a dao law into the youth’s brain.

“Boom!” Waves erupted in Jiankun’s mind, nearly flipping his ocean of knowledge over. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Clank! Clank!” He could hear the sounds of the swords echoing. The laws turned into divine swords that started dancing in accordance with the variations of the Soaring Immortal Sword Art.

These images truly embarrassed the youth. He realized that what he had learned in the past was a spectacle too horrible to endure. It had countless flaws from being incorrectly trained.

As the saying goes - a tiny discrepancy can lead to a huge mistake.

He found himself enlightened while slowly digesting this sword art and became a fan of one more saying - a single conversation across the table with a wise man is worth more than ten years of reading.

“I’m truly grateful for your guidance, Senior.” He performed nine full kowtows afterward.

Li Qiye, of course, didn’t react to this gesture.

Jiankun didn’t dare to be greedy. Just this one sword art alone was enough for a lifetime, so he left.

It didn’t take long before a group of people started kneeling in the courtyard - all of the elders led by the school master himself.

It turned out that after being taught by Li Qiye, Li Jiankun’s Soaring Immortal Sword Art became more profound than his master’s version.

After his master found out the details and carefully mused the new variations, the guy became red with embarrassment. He thought that he was hampering his own student’s progress by teaching such a crappy version of this sword law!

Thus, he also benefited from the new version and quickly reported this to the school master.

It was Chen Weizheng’s turn to be shocked and he summoned the elders again for this once-in-a-million-year opportunity.

A wise master was staying in their sect so it was time to seek help. That’s why all of them were kneeling in Li Qiye’s place, wanting his guidance.

When Jiahui and Zhiting opened the gate early in the morning and saw the group kneeling there, they naturally became startled.

Of course, they didn’t dare to say anything either and only stood quietly to the side.

Li Qiye wasn’t moved by this sight at all.

Chen Weizheng held his breath and kneeled soundlessly with the rest, awaiting for Li Qiye’s approval.

Days passed by without any result. They showed their sincerity by continuing to kneel in the same spot.

The sun changed to the moon and vice versa numerous times. One day, Li Qiye finally opened his eyes.

“Ancestor, please help us.” Chen Weizheng beseeched along with the elders.
