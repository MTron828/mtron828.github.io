Chapter 5173: Blood For Blood

“Young Noble, you have saved me twice now. I don’t have much so the only thing I can do is offer my wholehearted service…” Shao Yao calmed down and bowed toward Li Qiye.

“It’s okay, I don’t need a servant. Return from whence you came.” Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted her.

She became embarrassed right away. Who wouldn’t want the service of Alchemy Dao’s future successor? Alas, he didn’t seem slightly interested.

“As you wish, Young Noble.” She didn’t know what to do outside of whispering with her head lowered.

The crown prince had just gotten up and saw this. He risked his life only to see her plead allegiance to this ordinary brat? Even a fool could tell that she had special feelings for him.

“Is this your beast?!” He shouted with jealousy.

Li Qiye ignored him and continued to stare at True Bear who was regaining his wits.

This could have been the worst possible end for him - becoming to a frenzy beast with no sentience. It would have been better if he had died earlier during the near-collapse of his two new dao fruits.

Now, Li Qiye managed to subdue the rage and even protected his grand dao and the fruits. He maintained the conqueror at his best state. Unfortunately, he was now sealed in his true form.

“Keep on training and you will obtain your desired state eventually.” Li Qiye smiled and tapped on the bear’s head.

“Ooo, ooo…” The bear nodded at Li Qiye.

Despite losing his human form, this type of atavism was immensely beneficial. He could train and become stronger at a faster rate henceforth.

“Hey, did you hear me?!” The crown prince shouted since Li Qiye ignored him.

“Scram if you want to live.” Li Qiye finally answered, still not bothering to look straight at him.

The crown prince turned red; his youthful vigor and jealousy got the best of him.

“Do you know who I am?! I am the crown prince of Iron Tree, we have countless masters that…” He furiously shouted.

“Whatever.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively and interrupted him.

The crown prince trembled with rage. His kingdom was influential in Imperial Attendant City and famous throughout the continent.

“Bam!” Majestic cultivators landed around them.

The leader wore an iron crown with thorny decorations, a golden robe and other expensive trinkets. A draconic aura could be sensed as well.

The experts accompanying him were mighty sovereigns.

“Father!” The crown prince became ecstatic and joined the group. It turned out that during the crisis, he had called for help.

“Iron Throne Monarch.” Shao Yao’s brows furrowed after seeing him.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was the current ruler of Iron Tree and had three sacred fruits. According to the legend, this kingdom was founded by Adamantine Godmonarch - a being from the same generation as the sages of Imperial Attendant. She had fought alongside them before and contributed commendably. Because of this, they allowed her to establish a kingdom right outside of Imperial Attendant.

During her reign, Iron Tree was the strongest kingdom in this jurisdiction. Now, it no longer possessed the same strength and glory of past, becoming just an above-average power.

He looked around and saw the corpses; his expression soured. Once he saw Saintess Shao Yao, he bowed and said: “So you’re here too, Saintess. May I ask if you saw the culprit behind this?”

She was a junior in terms of cultivation but because of her special status, the monarch asked respectfully. Moreover, Iron Tree was a tributary of Imperial Attendant.

Although their founder was immensely strong, she still couldn’t compare to the unbeatable sages of Imperial Attendant. Nonetheless, she still wanted to protect Imperial Attendant, hence the creation of Iron Tree right by the outskirt.

Many things have changed with time but this relationship remained, hence the monarch’s attitude toward her.

She didn’t have time to respond before the crown prince jumped in: “Father, this person’s tamed beast did it, the thing massacred our riders!”

“I’m afraid there’s a misunderstanding.” She hurriedly said.

The monarch gazed at Li Qiye and released his oppressive aura. As a three-fruit dragon lord, this affected everyone with the exception of Li Qiye.

“Sir, may I ask for your name?” He said with a serious tone.

“None of your business.” Li Qiye wanted to leave.

“You want to leave after killing them?!” The king shouted and his men surrounded Li Qiye.

“So what? If you don’t want to die, scram.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

This infuriated the monarch. It was one thing for him to be respectful to the saintess but this junior dared to treat him with disdain after killing his men?

The saintess saw that the situation was escalating. Alas, she panicked and couldn’t find the right words.

“Hahaha, although Iron Tree is not a top sect, we still won’t be bullied so easily. We demand justice for our fallen brothers, that’s not out of line, is it?” The monarch had a reasonable demand.

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye said.

“Blood for blood!” The crown prince shouted.

“How will you pay back this debt?” The monarch glared at Li Qiye.
