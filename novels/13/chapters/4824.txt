Chapter 4825: Eternal Death

The pair of weapons had names - Undying Shield and Eternal Death Lance. This overlord represented death despite wanting to be everlasting.

The spectating overlords looked rather serious. Some of them have experienced the might of these weapons previously.

Undying could block all offenses, even curses. Eternal Death, on the other hand, delivered death. Even non-living things would be subjected to death.

“That lance can kill epoch weapons.” One of them whispered.

This combo was extraordinary. The shield prevented all damage and death; the lance instilled curses into the opponents.

The former was made with the toughest metal known to the respective epoch, empowering the lance by refining and channeling the received damage into an offensive form. With this, the lance could actually take down enemies not through sheer force but only the power of death via a curse.

“Bam!” He raised his shield forward. As long as it remained intact, no attack - not even the curse of death - would be able to hurt him. This was a prime example of being unkillable.

“Whoosh!” He thrust his lance toward Li Qiye’s throat.

A thrust from someone of this level should obliterate everything in between. However, external explosions didn’t occur despite its fatal potential. Only the death affinity corroded everything, leaving behind scars in both time and space. 

Li Qiye didn’t get up and raised one hand to create a heavenly seal, blocking the thrust.

“Zzz…” It couldn’t pierce Li Qiye’s palm, only leaving a small cut on the skin.

This damage was nothing for a cultivator, let alone someone like Li Qiye. However, the problem was that this lance was different.

If it was another epoch weapon dealing this damage, it wouldn’t change anything. The lance, on the other hand, infected him with death. Miasma started oozing from the small wound.

His primordial energy immediately suppressed the power of death. Nonetheless, it didn’t completely halt the growth.

Undying Lord was pleased to see the attack being effective. The judgment of death has been delivered.

He immediately thrust another ten thousand times in the blink of an eye - swift yet precise. He didn’t aim for penetration and physical damage, only to accelerate the corrosive infection. Once enough death energy accumulated, Li Qiye would surely die. 

Overlords took note of how terrifying Li Qiye was, having to deal with the heavenly injuries yet still being capable of stopping Undying Lord. They could only imagine his full power.

Nonetheless, Undying Lord still impressed them with this particular plan. It actually had a chance of success.

This enemy was an unchewable bone in their eyes - impossible to kill with the shield while being rather dangerous with Eternal Death. 

“Li Qiye will die for sure at this rate.” An overlord said what was on everyone’s mind.

“Rumble!” Meanwhile, lightning kept on flashing inside Li Qiye. He had to spend all of his primordial energy to stop the spread, leaving him exposed to the accumulation of death energy.

He knew that he didn’t have time to mess around with Undying Lord. He waved the other hand and summoned Corporeal Zone.

“Boom!” It turned into the strongest wall the world has ever seen and protected him. This was the reason why the Ancient Ming survived for eras after their defeat. Primordial runes pulsed on the wall, showing just how unbreakable Corporeal Zone was.

Undying Lord sent another barrage of thrust against the wall. Alas, it left zero damage this time. The judgment of death simply didn’t work against Corporeal Zone.

This was a phenomenon that could eventually break an epoch weapon after enough accumulation. 

Alas, countless thrusts have occurred and Corporeal Zone remained untouched.

“Given Li Qiye’s power, this is impossible.” One overlord commented.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The stronger the user, the mightier Corporeal Zone was. This left Undying Lord in quite a predicament.

Suddenly, Silly Da started moving again. It ran for Li Qiye, seemingly wanting to finally devour him. It crushed one peak after another. Those who ran away fast enough survived; the slower ones became mincemeat.
