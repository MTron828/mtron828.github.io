Chapter 5767: Capture

The omnipresent blood rays aimed to suppress Li Qiye, wielding a force that rendered emperors and gods helpless.

Power and speed were useless against the endless number of rays. Their combined power was incalculable.

However, Li Qiye only needed one step to jump out of everything, breaking all chains and shackles in this world.

He leaped out of the time-space continuum, the reincarnation cycle, and karma itself...

Loud explosions ensued but not a single ray touched Li Qiye - an existence surpassing the horde of Ling’er.

“Ahh!” All of them looked up, wanting to drag Li Qiye down from his transcendent state. Trillions of her attacked simultaneously, each as strong as an emperor or monarch.

“Enough.” Li Qiye activated his true power and revealed his supremacy - easily suppressing all affinities and cultivators.

“Bam!” The current ones became frozen.

“Clank!” A primordial law flew out of his palm, unrestrained by any existing limit. It pierced through all three paths of time, making its clanking noises heard.

Time and space currently nourished the countless copies, akin to amniotic fluid. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Come!” Li Qiye roared and sent the law to pierce through all of their chests, stopping the duplication process of the women and the fission of time and space.

He forcefully dragged his law back along with all the possible timelines and dimensions, aiming to refine it into one group again. Such power was inconceivable in the mortal realm.

“Rumble!” The trillions and trillions of copies started stacking on the original Ling’er like shadows.

“Ahh!” This caused her to roar. Space shook violently as the copies tried to break out again.

“Enough.” Li Qiye shouted and maintained the constriction with his primordial law.

Although she attempted to break free, a primordial light emanated from her and harmonized with his chain-like law.

“Buzz.” She became transparent as a result, resembling a boundless expanse with infinite time flow. Within this expanse were the same blood flames, always erupting and expanding.

A radiant primordial tree manifested into reality from the harmonization of Li Qiye’s dao and her body. The former released countless chains to seal the expanse.
