Chapter 5833: Just Living Pathetically

The murky ocean devoured time, space, and dao laws, leaving behind black holes in its wake. Nothing living could survive. If this were to flow to the six continents, it would instantly corrode everything. Emperors and monarchs’ bones with strong divinity would turn into nothingness with time.

“Scram.” Li Qiye punched the incoming ocean and tentacles without a second thought. An Ancestor with the primal affinity was no different than an insect before him.

“Bam!” The colossal flesh creature was sent flying through space like a ball, exploding into countless parts again.

Nevertheless, they returned to the main body creepily.

“Is this how an overlord fights?” Li Qiye glanced at Lord of Derivation and sneered: “How embarrassing and foolish if this is all you can do, insulting to all overlords.”

“Dark Crow, you’re not leaving this place alive today.” Derivation’s fury remained.

He pulled the other flesh continent closer before opening an abyss filled with teeth. This mouth of his could move anywhere on his body to the spectators’ dismay. This overlord was grotesque - a true abomination.

He started devouring his creation. Crunching and chewing could be heard as if it was a delicious meal.

Spectators became nauseous while feeling sentimental regarding the fallen emperors and conquerors. These godlike cultivators in the eyes of mortals have met such a tragic fate.

“Boom!” After devouring the monster, Derivation’s vitality seemed to be replenished. His lump of flesh shook once and released earth-shattering shockwaves.

Scabs appeared on the surface. The rotten parts and open wounds seemed to be healing. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This made spectators from The People wonder if he would devour all of the six continents for the sake of healing his body.

They got chills and thought that the overlords were merely waiting for this world to mature. After reaching its golden stage, the harvest would begin and no one would be able to escape.

There was no doubt that they were living under the shadow of death after all these years. It’s just that most had no idea about the grim future.

“Pop!” The scabs suddenly shattered and blood began to flow again.

“You wish to heal injuries caused by the villainous heaven with your meager power? Stop dreaming.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Hmph, I shall regain my true form after devouring three thousand worlds.” Derivation disagreed.

Listeners had no idea what he once looked like. Perhaps he was a dignified overlord once but they hoped that this goal would never be realized.

“I’m afraid that won’t happen since you’ll be dead.” Li Qiye said.

“The villainous heaven couldn’t kill me, let alone you, snot-nosed brat.” Derivation laughed.

“You’re just living pathetically, don’t brag about it.” Li Qiye said.

“Death blood!” Derivation had enough of Li Qiye’s vile tongue and opened up all of his pores, releasing a tsunami of rotten blood.

Its presence melted everything else until it was the only thing left. This looked more devastating than the ocean created by the previous tentacle creatures.
