Chapter 5411: Whose Pit?

Meanwhile, something else occurred in the deepest area of Dream Paradise. Immortal light and dao seemed to be harmonizing with?one visitor - Li Qiye.

He sat inside a pavilion with a table full of the best meals for him. This seemed to be the end of the world - there was no other path forward.

He?took his time pouring his own drinks and eating.

“My body… can’t handle this anymore.” A feeble voice came from the distance.

“You have indeed weakened but is there really a need to hide among the infinite dimensions? That’s overly prudent.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s just how it is when you grow old. Can’t even get up anymore but I’ll still offer you a toast.” The voice within the void responded.

The wine pot automatically floated in the air and poured a full cup. The cup then also floated up as if there was an invisible man holding it.

Li Qiye took it and drank it all in one gulp before responding: “I’m sure the cost to hide like this must have been considerable, I don’t mind.”

Having said that, he prepared another cup.

“Good, I appreciate it.” The voice said.

“I haven’t forgotten the favor I owe when you all released the power of the wise sages to protect the emperors. There is no need to be afraid of me.” Li Qiye said while drinking alone.

“We can rest assured then.” The voice became more pleasant after hearing this.

“I honestly don’t blame you, it’s normal to be cautious given your current state. Eyes are always gazing in the shadows, ready to devour a weakened prey.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s good that you understand.” The voice said, still choosing to hide in space.

“I see, it must have been difficult during my absence. Being viewed as a potential meal can’t be a good feeling.” Li Qiye chuckled and began eating the delicacies.

“It’s a different era now, we have to be careful with visitors.” The voice said.

“Who else came to visit?” Li Qiye asked casually as if his meal was more important than the matter at hand.

“That unfamiliar guest, shouldn’t be here yet was here.” The voice responded.

“It’s an interesting topic.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We aren’t his goal, you are.” The voice said.

“Probably thought about having a meal here but you all managed to hide. I don’t know if this guest is visiting because of me, could be a different plan. It would be nice if I’m the main target, makes things easier.” Li Qiye said.

“In my opinion, your first goal isn’t the outer heaven. Three Immortals need you.” The voice said.

Li Qiye stopped eating and glanced outside for a second. He then picked up a piece of fin from an unknown fish and continued eating.

“Looks like a total defeat.” He commented.

“Yes, conflicting ideologies.” The voice said.

“So many ideologies, not united at all.” Li Qiye said.

“There is only one thing that can make us united.” The voice paused for a moment before responding.

“I know, meals.” Li Qiye nodded: “At the very least, you all have exercised incredible restraint, not feasting everywhere like the old geezers, eventually going mad and devouring their own world.”

“If we can somehow jump out of this cycle, we can start anew.” The voice said softly.

“Whose cycle do you trust then?” Li Qiye smiled.

“We’ve discussed this matter extensively in the past but in the end, they were just ideas.” The voice said.

“Now, some of these ideas are being carried out because a side has been chosen.” Li Qiye took another sip.

“Yes, and the change of allegiance marked a turning point.” The voice admitted.

“They might be seeing hope or a different outcome, the best outcome potentially.” Li Qiye said.

“Perhaps.” The voice responded.

“Everyone believes that their choice will yield the best outcome, can’t always be correct.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“You do know that the biggest variable here is none other than yourself.” The voice said.

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded: “Well, picking a side isn’t bad at all. At the very least, some of you will be able to make it through instead of all being buried together.”

“Well…” After a brief pause, the voice sounded once more: “If we consider this from the perspective of our origin, it’s not a bad outcome. At the very least, we’ve escaped from one pit. Of course, there’s a chance that we’ve fallen into two different pits instead.”

“Those from the first pit are nearly all dead.” Li Qiye smiled.,

“Thanks to you with your explosion.” A rare laughter could be heard.

“The truth is that the second pit has been there for a long time now.” Li Qiye said.

“Indeed, it was ready when he left back in the olden ages.” The voice agreed.

“That’s why choosing to jump into this pit isn’t that surprising.” Li Qiye said.

“The third pit is you.” The voice said.

“I am very excited if you all jump into my pit.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “Nonetheless, nothing is free. I’m sure you’re aware of the price I’ll be paying to make it available.”

“You were going to do so either way since it benefits you.” The voice said.

“I suppose.” Li Qiye paused for a bit and nodded: “And fortunately, it is something I can afford so I’ll deal with it.”

“It’s rare to see you being sincere and generous.” The voice seemed happy about this development.

“Since I’ve benefited, I should be giving something in return.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Don’t you find it strange?” The voice said.

“What?” Li Qiye asked.

“He’s here but is just watching. If he had made a move, we wouldn’t have this opportunity at all.” The voice said.

“I do hope that he will be there so I can deal with it altogether, no more complications in the future.” Li Qiye gazed at the sky and said.

“Perhaps you should make the journey then.” The voice said.

“I will, but he might not be waiting for me.” Li Qiye drank.

“A meeting is inevitable. The question is, which of you will be the sharpening stone and which will be the blade?” The voice said.

“Could go either way.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Where do you think he’ll actually be to wait for you?” The voice asked.

“Before the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye speculated.

“I’m sure he wishes to watch on the sideline first, to see both sides weakened.” The voice said.

“If that is his dao, he is not qualified to stop my dao.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“...” The voice paused for a bit before responding: “True.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You must do something about Three Immortals, we have done our best.” The voice reminded.

“It’s amusing how they raised their blade to challenge me.” Li Qiye said.

“What would you have done?” The voice asked.

“The only time anyone in our world should raise our blade is when we face the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye responded.
