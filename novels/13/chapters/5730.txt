Chapter 5731: March Against Celestial Court

Some said Celestial Court had existed since the start of time. It served as the symbol of power and the holy land for the three great races.

However, the present Celestial Court had changed drastically. Rumor has it that in the distant past, it used to be a lineage with scattering branches. Many cultivators were eager to join.

This wasn’t limited to just the three races either. Humans, demons, golems, and other branches were eligible to join as well. This was an age where all races lived together as equals.

Later on, Celestial Court gradually focused on the three races alone. Racial prejudice began somehow, elevating the three races into nobility.

Since the hundred races were viewed as inferior, it took generations of emperors and monarchs to seize enough territories for them to live.

After the great calamity, Celestial Court changed again - becoming the authoritative figure for the three races. They branded other branches as sinners and initiated a conquest of banishment and ethnic cleansing.

Eras passed by in the blink of an eye and the conflict persisted to the present. Once a lineage in search of the dao, Celestial Court pursued power and conquest instead. It possessed boundless territories and dominion, becoming stronger than ever.

Today, Demon Conqueror led The People on a punitive expedition. Imperial auras surged in full force, seemingly unstoppable like a primordial flood. Images of dragons and phoenixes could be seen. Countless swords floated in the air along with pagodas...

They stood before the magnificent gate standing equal to the sky vault. Endless possibilities awaited beyond - a heavenly land of The Race.

Outside this entrance were numerous cities with high populations. The inhabitants relied on Celestial Court and lived prosperously but weren’t considered part of Celestial Court, unblessed by its light.

However, mortals and cultivators could no longer be seen; they had fully evacuated since they knew about the upcoming assault.

The commanders of the coalition didn’t try to hide their auras and powers. Thus, deafening blasts and dao resonations could be heard everywhere. Those who didn’t evacuate trembled in fear.

The last assault on Celestial Court took place during Skysplitter War. This time, they saw no defenders by the deserted gate.

“Today, The People march against Celestial Court. Emperors, come and face us.” Demon Conqueror shouted. As the supreme commander of the alliance, she looked imposing and magnificent.

“At the celestial river.” A domineering voice from beyond the gate answered her. It was suppressive, akin to a heavenly palm descending and eradicating everything.

Commanders and soldiers took a deep breath, unable to stay calm. They exchanged glances and waited for the next command.

It seemed that Celestial Court had abandoned the entrance and wanted to fight by the celestial river instead. This gave them a bad feeling.

“Can this be a trap?” An emperor stated her concern.

“Trap or not, we are still marching. The gongs of retreat will find themselves useless today.” An Immortal Monarch answered in a resolute tone.

They came with the determination to take Celestial Court down today. Whether there was deceit or otherwise, a decisive battle shall take place at the celestial river.

“We shall enter Celestial Court, be on guard.” Demon was the first to enter the gate.

Her commanders were no cowards and activated their powers. Imperial laws descended to protect their legions. Some already had their weapons and treasures at the ready, preparing for an ambush.

They viewed this as an existential crisis for The People. To not bite back after repeated transgressions meant being bullied for the foreseeable future.

“Rumble!” They crossed the gate while maintaining formation, entering a vast expanse with no end in sight. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

This world seemed to be larger than the immortal continent. Radiant palaces could be seen among the stars. Their light seemed eternal.

They were the size of massive cities in the outside world and exuded imperial auras belonging to the mightiest inhabitants.
