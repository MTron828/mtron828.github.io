Chapter 4506: Infinite

Void coins were rare enough for the members of the behemoth to bid extremely conservatively, only going up 100 at a time.

5,800 was enough for others to back down. This exceeded their current sum and they would need to redeem more from the grotto. Alas, the exchange rate would certainly be unreasonable. At that point, the void jade would no longer be worth it.

Therefore, Li Qiye’s bid made the crowd clamor.

“Is he crazy?” One big shot murmured.

“Does he have too many coins to spend?” One youth stared at him and said: “10,00 coins in one go, is this jade worth it?”

“He’s antagonizing Three Thousand Dao.” An older cultivator said, thinking that it wasn’t about the jade at all.

“You!” Cloudgrasp Elder’s expression became unsightly.

Putting the rarity of the coins aside, the bidders previously tried to remain cordial in order to avoid escalation.

They had an implicit agreement of outbidding by small increments to avoid prideful competition. Now, Li Qiye certainly didn’t follow this at all, vexing both Cloudgrasp and other participants. This was a terrible precedence for the rest of the auction.

Cloudgrasp was so certain of victory since the others have backed off. He was quite pleased with himself as well for winning and keeping the price low. Perfect was one way to describe it. Alas, this was all ruined because of Li Qiye.

“Check to see if it’s a valid bid.” A different big shot demanded.

Some purposely wanted to cause trouble due to Li Qiye’s unwanted action. They wanted to win with the lowest bid possible. Therefore, expelling this black sheep was necessary.

“Yes, or anyone can just bid whatever.” Another supported.

Furthermore, they didn’t trust Li Qiye’s reputation and resources. A test was warranted.

“Since you’re bidding 10,000, at least take out 5,000 as a deposit.” Cloudgrasp suggested.

It wouldn’t be easy for anyone to muster five thousand coins in a short time. This was one way to chase Li Qiye away.

“This is pocket change for our young noble. His treasury includes all the wonders of the world, 10,000 void coins mean nothing to him. This is ridiculous, the result of being poor and thinking that everyone else is poor as well.” Jian Ming interjected.

Wise Ancestor felt helpless since he couldn’t stop Jian Ming due to Li Qiye’s implicit permission.

“Stop wasting time, if he’s going to double the bid, then just prepare a deposit instead of uttering rubbish to disturb the auction.” A youth shouted.

“I agree that a deposit is necessary. We do not want any malicious bid.” A big shot from an ancient clan said.

“Void coins are rare enough to warrant this.” A hidden master said.

Li Qiye only smiled while being the target of the crowd.

“Ahem.” The old man from the grotto who had appeared at the entrance showed up once more.

He looked at everyone and cupped his fist: “Young Noble Li’s credit limit will be guaranteed by us, and it is unlimited. Gentlemen, no need to worry, we will make a deposit of 5,000 void coins for him to start.”

With that, fellow members brought out a trunk. They opened it and revealed void rays coming from neatly stacked coins.

Silence took over the auction since they were left speechless. Unlimited credit? How many others in Eight Desolaces could enjoy this treatment?

Credits were a thing in Grotto Courtyard. After all, not everyone brought their entire treasury with them. Some might go overboard and overbid, resulting in needing temporary assistance from the auction house. This was a service available to reputable and wealthy cultivators.

In other words, Li Qiye could bid whatever he wanted and no one should question the bid. The grotto served as the guarantor. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Sigh, so much trouble over this small sum.” Li Qiye glanced at the trunk and shook his head, causing everyone else to feel awkward.
