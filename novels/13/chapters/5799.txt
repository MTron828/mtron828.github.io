Chapter 5799: Celestial Court Will Stand As Long As We Are Around

Li Qiye landed in front of Celestial Court, glancing back at Demon and the others.

“Leave, the real battle starts now.” He waved his hand and said.

Demon, World, Ren Xian, and many others exchanged glances. They then bowed and obeyed, realizing that he wanted to fight Celestial Court alone.

It seemed that his wanting them to fight without him was a test of their determination and a dao lesson. Now, it has become a matter of safety. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The alliance retreated, leaving Li Qiye alone against Celestial Court - a lineage that had lasted for eras.

Although it had been attacked numerous times in the past, its members felt suffocated before the lone attacker who looked just like an ordinary mortal devoid of special auras.

As he strolled forward, they couldn’t help staggering backward, unable to stand in his way. This included Light-dragon, Heaven Burial, and other apex cultivators.

He made it to the gate guarded by Titanic Conqueror. She hesitated for a moment and still moved to the side, making room for him.

He stopped and smiled at her: “Celestial Court will be destroyed, it is not too late for you to leave.”

Titanic took a second before gritting her teeth and making a decision.

“Buzz.” Her forehead lit up with an ancient rune, seemingly fused with the bone on her forehead. Since they were one, she had more control over the heavenly treasure’s power.

She undoubtedly was tied up with Celestial Court and Elder Galaxy.

“Crack!” She drilled two fingers into her forehead.

“Ahh!” She bellowed in pain as blood splurted out. Nevertheless, she removed the bone and threw it on the ground.

Spectators took a deep breath after seeing the open wound and blood streaming down her face.

Removing this wasn’t as simple as removing a bone. This required severing the connection with the treasure. Thus, they knew just how agonizing it was.

She didn’t wipe the blood off her face, only bowing at Li Qiye and leaving.

Two groups existed in Celestial Court - those receiving blessings and otherwise. The latter group was free to leave at any time, not bound by anything.

Being tied up with the heavenly treasure was different. Celestial Court didn’t necessarily allow them to leave and could pursue deserters.

However, none tried to stop her. She was mighty with an immortal armament and an immortal bone.

Li Qiye entered Celestial Court and the group couldn’t back off any longer since Celestial Palace was right behind them. His gaze alone made them shudder as if he could decide their fate.

“Who else wants to leave? Now is the time.” He said with a smile.

The frozen members didn’t dare to fight him. They exchanged glances, clearly tempted by his offer. Perhaps they could take out the bone in their forehead and leave Celestial Court. The problem was they didn’t know if others would kill them for doing so.

“I am a child of Celestial Court, I will fight to the end! As long as I am around, Celestial Court will never fall!” Light-dragon roared.

Light-dragon was an influential figure in Celestial Court. His courageous declaration stabilized the group’s wavering morale.

He and some others were loyal to Celestial Court; some were born here after all so this was their home.

The same couldn’t be said for characters such as Immortal Emperor Fu Mo and Zhuo Huo. They were guest officials, albeit highly valued and respected.
