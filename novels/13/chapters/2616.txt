Finally, he became the size of an ant to the astonishment of the crowd.

In the beginning, they thought this mirror would release a destructive strike or a brutal method, perhaps even a curse.

Who would have thought that this ray would shrink him down to the size of an ant?

People glanced at each other, thinking that this mirror was too bizarre.

“This bloody mirror is frightening indeed. It looks like a curse, a sure-kill move.” One expert commented with trepidation.

“It’s not just a curse but more like a seal. It wants to lock Li Qiye’s dao. Only by doing so would it be able to turn him into an ant.” One ancestor slowly said.

“Not just that.” A gray-hair ancestor added with a serious stare: “It looks like Lu Keweng’s experiment is a success. They will want to create an even more powerful forbidden weapon in the future. Don’t forget, they have plenty of systems to work with, an endless supply of materials.”

The crowd was horrified since he was obviously referring to people when he said “supply”. The higher the number, the more powerful the weapon would become.

The five merchants rejoiced at the successful attack. Golden-horn Heavenly Merchant laughed happily and praised: “Brother Lu sure is amazing, he’s the only one who can come up with this idea.”

“Yes, his vision is peerless.” Whitebeard Heavenly Merchant added.

“We have nothing to fear now with this weapon!” A different one laughed arrogantly.

They glanced at each other and started celebrating. An even bolder thought appeared in their mind.

Li Qiye was very strong and could easily take down the five of them together. However, he was still sealed by this forbidden weapon.

However, they could even create a stronger one. People were right - they used several million lives to refine this particular one.

Many members among them protested this idea because it was a big deal. Plus, the product might not be that powerful. People at their level already had plenty of weapons.

Now, this success fueled their ambition even more. Not to mention the other systems, even the three behemoths would fear them if they could create something greater.

At that point, it was fine to use a hundred million people or so. After all, they were mere ants.

“Hahaha! All ants!” The group viewed the world with disdain after realizing the future potential.

Green-robed Heavenly Merchant sneered while looking at the miniature Li Qiye: “Who’s the ant now? You are! That’s what you get for opposing us.”

“Kill him now, just an ant, can’t reach the apex.” Golden-horn chuckled.

The five of them became relaxed and no longer cared for public opinion.

This made it clear to the crowd that they were planning for something more sinister.

“It’s over for Fiercest. He made fun of them earlier but now, he actually shrank down to the size of an ant.” One spectator said.

Some people didn’t like him at all. One sneered: “That’s what he gets for being so arrogant, not understanding the unfathomable power of the federation. He can’t oppose such a monster alone, so suicidal.”

“Boom!” A giant foot came down for Li Qiye inside the separate dimension. It heavily slammed on the ground.

“No!” Lin Yixue screamed. There was no need to look - one could imagine his fate right now, just a lump of flesh.

Tears flowed out but there was nothing she could do. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“That’s the end of a great genius.” Some felt sorry for him while looking at the foot.

“He was too stubborn and aggressive.” One expert shook his head.

“He was being unreasonable, the five merchants yielded already yet he kept on pushing them towards the edge. He deserved being crushed like an ant.” One fella scoffed.

“Rumble!” A series of explosions interrupted the crowd. The kingdom was quaking, subjected to great pressure.

“What’s going on?” The five merchants were startled since this power didn’t come from them.

“Oh? Another development.” The spectators were surprised.

“Boom!” The giant foot was lifted to the air, revealing Li Qiye beneath.

He grew back to his original size in the blink of an eye, but it didn’t stop there.

“Rumble!” He quickly turned into a giant.

In the beginning, he was the size of a hill. Next, the size of a mountain range, then his head was right below the firmament; his feet ravaged the earth...

A bloody light appeared around him - the one from the mirror earlier. They served as dao laws pulling on his body, causing it to grow larger. He eventually reached the size where one strand of his hair could fall down and crush a mountain range.

The dimensional kingdom couldn’t contain him any longer and started cracking.

Remember, this huge space was virtually an independent world. Alas, Li Qiye still overfilled it.

Everything inside was being crushed, including the bloody mirror.

“Run!” The five merchants ran with all of their might.

“A reversal is always entertaining.” Li Qiye spoke. His voice was ten thousand times more sonorous than thunder, causing the world to tremble.

He reached forward, aiming for the fleeing merchants. Empowered by fear and desperation, the group was quite fast and made it many million miles away.
