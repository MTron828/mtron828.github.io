Chapter 5180: A Flower For You

The sunlight made paradise out of nothingness. Even the broken walls were comforting as the group relaxed.

“If you make it there, will you take the villainous heaven down?” The old man murmured, seemingly imagining that scene.

“All I seek is an answer. If I have to kill, so be it.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m sure you’ve thought of this before.” The old man said: “It will be the same, more or less.”

“That may not be the case.” Li Qiye smiled: “There is no absolute in this vast world and its countless inhabitants.”

“History disagrees with you, little has changed throughout the eternal cycles.” The old man said.

“Speak for yourself, that would only be the case if you all were successful in overthrowing the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye said.

“Now I’m offended, you are looking down on us.” The old man had a look of indignation.

“Then tell me, what were you trying to accomplish? Make it sound grandiose.” Li Qiye said.

“If I were still alive and somehow manage to overthrow the villainous heaven, I’ll start by devouring everything. What’s more important than filling one’s stomach?” The old man smiled.

“At best, I’ll just be thinking about replacing him.” The old man added: “I wonder what goes on in your head.”

“I was born a mortal and do not think about becoming a god, I know my limitation. You, born a god, cannot understand the thoughts of a mortal.” Li Qiye said.

“Interesting perspective.” The old man said: “Three thousand worlds and their inhabitants are nothing more than food and ants.”

“That’s why I do not wish to think like a god.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Is that so? During the eternal cycles, many mortals have ascended to the apex and entertained the thoughts of becoming a god.” The old man responded.

“A mortal shell yet the ambition of a god?” Li Qiye smiled and said: “That’s only an excuse for fear, they fear death yet do not want to admit the flaws in their dao heart.”

After a brief pause, the old man said: “You can become a god.”

“What do you think will happen then?” Li Qiye asked.

The old man opened his eyes and said seriously: “I’m afraid you would consume us, one by one.”

“Then I’ll be the same as everyone else, a mortal with a grand ambition.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It’s not a defect.” The old man said.

“I disagree entirely. A god with defects shouldn’t exist, and the same for immortals. It is a mental disorder that can cause great harm.”

“Haha.” The old man couldn’t help but laugh: “I can only imagine his face after hearing this. He is proud of being an immortal and now, you’re saying that it’s a mental disorder.”

“Pretty much.” Li Qiye said: “Recently, the stronger the cultivators, the sicker they are.”

“Then you’re not far from being mentally ill.” The old man clicked his tongue.

“This is the time to stand firm and why I keep a close watch on my dao heart. Just a little slacking off will be enough to go crazy.” Li Qiye squinted while looking at the setting sun.

“Going crazy isn’t too bad during starvation. It makes you rather clear-headed and aware.” The old man said.

“All madmen say that about themselves.” Li Qiye chuckled and shifted a bit, continuing to enjoy the sun.

“I suppose.” The old man nodded: “Alright, why are you here? I’m sure it isn’t to visit me.”

“Is there a problem with visiting an old friend?” Li Qiye smirked.

“You wouldn’t visit for no reason.” The old man said.

“You’re right, it seems offensive like I’m gloating if I’m only here to visit, like I’m looking down on you.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t care what you think.” The old man said.

“Here’s the deal, I have a half-dead person with me. I’ve searched around and there is no spot as good as your place.” Li Qiye said.

“Damn you!” The old man wanted to smack Li Qiye.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Calm down, calm down.” Li Qiye responded: “I’m here to negotiate and plus, you’re already dead. Others would have no complaints while you’re taking up such a good spot with a dao source. It shouldn’t be wasted because saving one life is more valuable than building a seven-floored pagoda.”

“Don’t even think about it!” The old man refused.

“Sigh, don’t be like this.” Li Qiye said: “I’ll give you an auspicious flower, okay? Someone who pays attention to details like you is probably feeling uneasy since there is still stagnant death energy left. You won’t be able to rest in peace so I’ll help out. The flower will let you rest in a dignified manner, a complete and beautiful death, unlike your brothers whose graves are disgusting with miasma and death energy.”

Having said that, he patted the old man’s chest and said: “You are a great man and I am more than happy to embellish your resting place. You can enjoy death with honor while I’ll live comfortably knowing that I have done a good deed. This is a win-win situation.”

“Poof.” The old man turned into smoke and disappeared from sight without responding.

Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Sigh, so stingy. You’re already dead, at least be a little useful and kind to each other.”

Who knows if the old man heard his comment after leaving?

With that, he stood up and walked deeper into Imperial Attendant. As he was leaving, the old man in blue also got up and raised his paper sign in Li Qiye’s direction.

The latter only smiled and shook his head, not interested in a purchase. However, the old man didn’t give up.

He hung the sign on his neck and followed Li Qiye. This became quite a sight for passersby.

The city was massive enough to accommodate an entire kingdom. The high population consisted primarily of The People.

This was because the founding sages of the city were part of The People as well. It became an asylum during the various wars, always standing strong.

In fact, it was older than Imperial Alliance or perhaps even Imperial Field from the ancient continent. The first lord was known as City Lord Zi Yan; many other powerful cultivators joined afterward including Heavenly Sage Yuan, Ox-dragon Ancestor, and many emperors.

Many generations later, Space Dragon Emperor, Immortal Emperor Qilin, and Calamity Dao Lord joined as well.

Unity was a key characteristic of the city under City Lord Zi Yan’s leadership. It only started changing after the rumors of her death during Grand Dao War.

The city split into various sects - Alchemy Dao, Imperial Gate, Qilin Manor…
