Chapter 3592: Jumping Into The Net

“Let’s help the sect master too!” Another disciple shouted and rushed forward.

His fellow members also did the same and channeled their energy and vitality into their sect master. This was a great display of solidarity and teamwork.

“The clan master needs our help!” Others also did the same without holding back.

It didn’t take long before the various factions aided the seniors in the competition.

“Boom!” Mighty shockwaves emanated across the valley, on the verge of sinking it.

During this devastating process, a divine light flashed from the platform only for a split second.

Strangely enough, though all experts were channeling their energy into the platform, it remained untouched outside of just shaking a bit.

It seemed as if even the strongest infusion of power wouldn’t affect the platform at all. It resembled an ocean capable of accepting the currents of all rivers.

The juniors turned red as well as if they were receiving the backlashes from the other competitors. This was actually not the case.

“Something strange is happening.” The teachers from Duality noticed a weird phenomenon.

The scene in the valley seemed to be a still image. Everyone was red but couldn’t let out any sound.

“No, stop this!” One ancestor finally took a deep breath. He mustered everything he got and shouted: “It’s sucking our-”

He couldn’t finish because the devouring force continued to absorb his strength and vitality, even the soul.

“What’s going on?” The spectators outside were confused.

Earlier, they thought that this was only a normal contest of power without needing to fight. The contestants couldn’t speak because they were fully focused.

“Buzz.” The platform gently vibrated. Next came numerous bright dao lunes intertwining together. The platform became mysterious and profound; it seemed to be performing a secret ceremony.

“So is this an altar?” The oldest teacher in Duality narrowed his eyes.

“Buzz...” More buzzes could be heard. Certain sections of the platform sank down and formed tiny grooves in a complicated and deliberate manner. They resembled a peerless chapter being carved into the rock.

Blood flowed through the grooves and emitted a bright luster. The entire platform changed to a crimson color as a result.

The blood was naturally from the competitors and even their juniors. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Their vitality and energy are being sucked away!” One expert outside the valley shouted.

“Yes, no exception.” The teachers became alarmed as well.

It was already too late when people figured it out because the platform had them fully trapped. The sucking power rendered them helpless regardless of their immense energy and vitality.

It acted as a bottomless abyss and sucked in everything. They couldn’t even open their mouth to speak as if they were completely under the platform’s control. It seemed that this wouldn’t stop until only dried corpses were left of them.

They became horrified as various power sources left their body but there was nothing they could do. Moving an inch was impossible, let alone escape.

“Why is this happening?” The spectators outside didn’t understand.

“Nothing happened when Li Qiye got over there.” An expert from the last generation murmured.

They saw Li Qiye walking and touching the platform earlier but it didn’t do anything to him. Now, these experts were completely stuck.

“Are they all going to die?” This became the next question.

“Click, click, click...” The golden egg in the middle of the platform actually moved a bit. People had the feeling that the thing inside was about to break out of the shell.

“No, it’s not the platform.” One teacher took a deep breath and said: “The egg is the thing sucking their energy and vitality. Li Qiye was right, this egg is ominous and evil. It wants the blood of these experts, all of it!”

Those waiting outside shuddered after hearing this. One pale spectator wondered: “It’s really the egg?”

Li Qiye had repeated this several times but no one heeded his warning. They thought that he was only trying to scare them and were annoyed with him.

“Boom!” The oldest ancestor from a big sect managed to move just a little bit. After a loud blast, he released twelve fate palaces and illuminated the area.

Supreme totems appeared along with the palaces, seemingly trying to summon something.

In a distant region, a bloody and massive figure emerged in a particular sect. This figure traveled through space and took over the ancestor.

“Elder Qiao is already a Heavenly Sovereign.” One expert became surprised.

“Just one step into the realm.” A teacher said: “But this sacred ancestor from Blood is powerful indeed.”

The ancestor became gigantic after fusing with the bloody figure. His body trembled as he was about to unleash some power. His first action was severing both of his hands.
