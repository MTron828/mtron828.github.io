Chapter 4943: Outnumbered

“Reincarnation City is here too?” Bloodsea looked around and said.

Reincarnation Dao answered directly to Divine Alliance. However, it didn’t have much to do with Deity, unlike Heaven Burial.

The latter two were awfully close. Moreover, Heaven Burial Conqueror was currently a prestigious member of Celestial Court. On the other hand, Blazing Conqueror was not that close to Celestial Court.

Thus, it was surprising to see Reincarnation being involved in this mess. It seemed that Deity had negotiated with other powers for the sake of obtaining Bevevolence.

“Fellow Daoist, this isn’t any of your business.” Reincarnation City Lord smiled: “No one will stop you from leaving, not even Deity.”

Normally, a great power would do everything possible to avenge the death of its ancestors. However, it looked like Deity was willing to overlook this.

“No need.” Bloodsea showed no sign of yielding. He was all alone so he didn’t need to be afraid of Deity.

“Why bother yourself with this mess?” Arrow Saint uttered coldly. His aura still reached the academy despite his actual location being far away.

His dao was of the bow and arrow, hence his preferring to keep a distance from the enemies.

“Just make your move.” Bloodsea raised his saber with both hands for another slash before telling Yue Shanjian: “Leave!”

Shanjian didn’t linger around and grabbed Bai Shaojin. The two of them soared toward Hundred Hall.

“Clank!” Bloodsea fully activated his saber dao, releasing countless sharp arcs intertwining together. Space crumbled into little pieces.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” Both Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord shouted.

“Bloodsea Dual Slash!” Bloodsea utilized his sacred fruits as well for two consecutive slashes accompanied by titanic bloodlust.

It became a net of slashes capable of massacring everyone caught inside. Spectators shouted in horror after seeing this.

Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord became alarmed since Bloodsea was not messing around. They might die if they were to hold back or chase after the two youths.

“Myriad Arrows!” Arrow Saint’s location was no longer safe since the ocean of blades was coming for him as well.

His three sacred fruits became resplendent and created countless celestial arrows behind him. All of them were miles long and connected to a string made of the dao. They then combined together for the ultimate shot. He could kill a god standing on a different continent with this technique.

“Endless Cycle!” Reincarnation City Lord’s wheel behind him also soared into the air. Fighting Bloodsea required him to go all out.

As the wheel was spinning, everything became affected by its rotation - whether it be worldly laws or other living beings.

Students felt small in comparison. Even the greatest era would eventually turn into smoke; nothing could outlast the endless cycle.

“Boom!” The battle between three dragon lords started. They didn’t hold back so students had a hard time enduring. Weaker ones vomited blood despite not being the targets. Just the mere shockwaves alone were nearly fatal. A direct hit would result in them being reduced to blood.

Alas, Bloodsea alone couldn’t stop the two opponents. Their combined effort sent him smashing into the peaks behind him, piercing through one after another.

Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord tumbled backward; blood dripping down the corner of their lips.

The dual slashes just now did injure them. Nonetheless, they were in a much better position than Bloodsea.

They exchanged glances of astonishment - Bloodsea was far stronger than expected. The guy managed to injure them despite being outnumbered? He might be reaching the limit of a three-fruit dragon lord and could kill them in a one-on-one scenario.

“Bam!” Bloodsea leaped out of the rocks and headed for Hundred Hall.

“He’s so strong.” Students calmed down and were amazed at Bloodsea’s agility despite the injuries.

His reputation, notorious or otherwise, was certainly well-earned.

“Fellow Daoist, it’s not too late to leave.” Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord gave chase while trying to convince him to give up.

They have gone too far now and couldn’t pull back. Plus, they could justify it by saying that they were merely trying to get back a stolen treasure. Therefore, the academy shouldn’t feel overly slighted.

Bloodsea stopped and blocked the two, still gripping his saber with both hands.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The two of you should heed your own warning.” An old man appeared above the sky of Hundred Hall.

He wore a gray robe and had the bearing of a noble scholar from a prestigious lineage. People couldn’t help but respect him at first glance.

“Schoolmaster!” Students shouted and were ecstatic to see him.
