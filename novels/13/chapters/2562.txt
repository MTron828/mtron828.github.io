This ancestor of the Mu has had enough of this conversation.

The relationship between the three great behemoths was very delicate. One always wanted to rise above the others but afraid that the third would take advantage of the situation.

Because of this, they were both friends and enemies while maintaining this stalemate. No large-scale conflicts have started just yet, only minor skirmishes.

The Mu naturally thought about taking actions against Nine Secrets after receiving news of Lucidity King’s death. However, the new king had full control over that system now and they didn’t want to get involved.

Mobilizing against Nine Secrets might be doing exactly what the Li Clan wanted. The Li would benefit the most from a fight between the Mu and Nine Secrets.

Lengying didn’t leave even after being asked to leave. He sipped his tea and said: “Don’t chase me away so fast, Brother Mu, let me finish.”

“Brother Sun, no need if you wish to continue on persuading me.” The ancestor said: “We will not participate in this mess, so please drop this idea. Of course, if you are just here to drink and chat with me, then you’re welcome to stay.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I’m thankful for your hospitality, Brother Mu.” Lengying drank his tea again before speaking: “I’ve heard that your clan has been searching for someone recently.”

“You’re asking the wrong person, Brother Sun. I haven’t paid attention to mundane matters for a long time, I don’t know if the juniors are looking for people.”

“Is that so?” Lengying was relaxed. After a while, he added: “If my ears are still working, I heard that the Mu is searching for a youth with the title of Fiercest. Am I wrong?”

“Who did you heard it from?” The Mu Ancestor’s eyes turned cold.

Keep in mind that when such a powerful Eternal showed this expression, so many people would tremble in fear.

Lengying took his time: “Paper can’t wrap fire and no walls can block all winds. I just want to remind you about a particular promise your clan has made with Jade-break True Emperor. It wouldn’t be good if the emperor were to find out about your violation. Given the emperor’s temperament, he might start a war between the Mu and the Li.”

Lengying cleared his throat and continued: “If I’m not mistaken, Jade-break True Emperor broke into your clan with the protection of Gu Yifei, no one could stop them back then...”

“Are you threatening us, Brother Sun?” The ancestor uttered coldly.

“Brother Mu, you misunderstood. I am only reminding you so that history doesn’t repeat itself.” Lengying remained calm, still enjoying his tea.

“Thank you then, Brother Sun.” The ancestor snorted.

“No need to thank me so quickly, I still have a gift for you. I’m sure you will like it.” Lengying said.

“I’m listening.” The ancestor scowled, clearly dissatisfied with Lengying.

“Brother Mu, the truth is that our new king is Fiercest, the person you are looking for!” Lengying revealed.

“Brother Sun, that’s not funny.” The ancestor was stunned for a moment before turning cold again.

“Brother Mu, you think I am messing with you?” Lengying stayed calm.

The ancestor stared at him to read his expression for a while before replying: “Even if you wish to use a borrowed knife, don’t make it too obvious.”

“Amazing coincidences can happen in this world. Haven’t you heard of the proverb, there is no story without coincidences?” Lengying took another sip of tea. [1]

“Still hard to believe.” The ancestor coldly said.

“But am I not here before you in person, you think I would employ such a naive trick for a borrowed knife? Your clan will help me after hearing a lie? That’s impossible.” Lengying said.

The ancestor agreed. Lengying was no idiot that would use something so childish.

“I am not a good person and have done many bad things in life; my hands are stained with blood.” Lengying continued: “But Brother Mu, am I not a trustworthy person? My promise is definitely worth something, right?”

“You are a man of your word!” The ancestor had to admit.

Sun Lengying was always stingy with his words, treating them as precious as gold. That’s why he always stayed true to his statements and keep his promise.

“That’s why I don’t need to trick your clan about this. I would only be humiliating myself and acting like a clown by doing so.” Lengying said.

“I’m still in disbelief.” The ancestor said.

“Go ahead and confirm it, I’m sure your clan can dig up information about someone.” Lengying said.

“We will.” The ancestor accepted.

“It won’t be a problem. And, I know your clan wants revenge for Mu Shaochen, so can we talk now?” Lengying said.

“What do you want?” The ancestor replied.

“Nothing, just what belongs to me. With your clan’s help, of course.” Lengying responded.

“I’m sure Lucidity King had his reasons for passing the throne down to that youth.” The ancestor chuckled.

“That’s all in the past, I only want to take back Nine Secrets, not dwell on bygones.” Lengying said.

“He’s clearly an extremely powerful Eternal to be able to seize the throne like that.” The ancestor said: “Brother Sun, you need to know that you’re facing the master of Nine Secrets. You will become the enemy of an entire system, quite unwise.”

“I also have the help of your clan. I’m sure you want nothing more than to kill him.” Lengying coldly said.

“I won’t deny that, but we don’t need to help you either, Brother Sun.” The ancestor slowly said.

“I’m confident that people won’t say no as long as the conditions are right. Our system is large and can satisfy any of your demands. Just say the word.” Lengying offered.

The ancestor’s eyes narrowed while staring at Lengying. The guy was right, no one would say no as long as their demands were met.

Nine Secrets System had plenty of daoist scriptures and riches. If their clan had access to take whatever they wanted... Yes, this tempting condition was too much to say no. The ancestor’s heart naturally started beating faster.

“That’s very generous indeed, Brother Sun.” The ancestor said.

“It’s justified when asking someone for help. I’m sure you will want to be friends and cooperate with me.” Lengying said.

“You are willing to open up your system? Don’t change your mind at that point.” The ancestor said.

“Don’t worry, Brother Mu. I, Sun Lengying, am a man of my word. Plus, I only want what belongs to me and don’t care about the rest, so your clan can ask for anything.” Lengying said.

The ancestor started contemplating. This was killing two birds with one stone - revenge on top of Nine Secrets being open to them.

“You don’t need to answer now.” Lengying added: “Wait until your clan knows what it wants before making your request. I’m easy to work with.”

“Very well, I won’t be reserved then.” The ancestor said.

“That’s how it should be.” Lengying said.

“However, Brother Sun, this Fiercest guy could come up from below on top of dominating your system, I guess I don’t need to say more about his abilities.” The tone from the ancestor became serious.

Lengying looked him in the eyes in response: “Yes, he is immensely powerful, but that’s also with the help of our system. Once he leaves, he’ll weaken by a bit. Of course, if we can lead him to your clan, I’m sure our side will have the absolute advantage. He’ll be a moth drawn to the flame.”

1. The proverb here requires knowing the background and meaning to work. The literal translation would have been - can’t write without this coincidence. So the background is that the author was trying to describe a fight between a folklore hero and a tiger. Unfortunately, he wasn’t happy with what he got - not animated enough, lacking soul... During his struggle, a loud commotion came outside of his study room. He got up and looked out the door to see a drunkard fighting against a dog. They were exchanging punches and bites evenly until the drunkard eventually did a sidestep and got on top of the dog’s back, rendering it helpless. He had an epiphany as if he was seeing the hero fighting against the tiger. He ran back inside and started writing. He then told his wife who responded with the proverb
