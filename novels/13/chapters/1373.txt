“Rumble!” It was the Furious Devil’s huge body versus Cao Guojian with his unhindered sword. Despite being a Grand Godking, Guojian didn’t have the upper hand against the raging devil.

“The Furious Immortal Physique!” The observant Puresun once again spotted the physique.

Li Qiye stopped watching this bout as well. His eyes fell upon the Terra King as he uttered: “Last warning, scram or I’ll make a urine pot out of your skull!”

The king was blocking the entrance at this moment. He wanted to keep a low profile in order to avoid getting involved in this conflict, but how could Li Qiye let him go given where he was standing?

The king couldn’t endure the anger from the public humiliation and shouted: “Li Qiye! You think you can be domineering? My Ancestral Terra isn’t even afraid of an Immortal Emperor, let alone a junior like you!”

He spoke resoundingly without any apprehension for his foe. He couldn’t be blamed for acting like this since his sect was still under the protection of three ancestral trees. Not even an Immortal Emperor could take down their powerful lineage, so how could he not be bold?

“It’s just the Ancestral Terra, it wouldn’t be hard for me to destroy it at all.” Li Qiye leisurely smiled and said: “If you can’t act sensibly, then I’ll start by killing a puppet like you so that the old geezer will crawl out. It won’t be late to destroy your sect then!”

This nonchalant statement made everyone gasp. Li Qiye’s declaration was too exaggerated. Not even a resurrected emperor would dare to say something like this.

“Bang!” Another figure came out of his kingdom of blood. The entire world felt a heatwave that slammed into their faces.

Of course, it was identical to Li Qiye and spewed out a terrifying refined sunfire. This terrifying flame from the sun could incinerate all things. The high temperature made many people retreat in fear; they no longer dared to stay near it.

Li Qiye smilingly said: “Let the Yang God annihilate you and turn you into ashes so that I can see if the geezer will crawl out from its remains.”

This was the Extreme Yang God, another of the twelve deities. Ruyan smiled and leaped back to the boneship to stand by Li Qiye after seeing the appearance of this god.

This Yang God with a floating sun stood at the edge of the altar and instantly took action. It loomed over the Terra King and poured down its sunfire.

“Go!” The king’s expression shifted after seeing the endless fire coming down. He summoned a yellow shield that wasn’t made from gold or wood to stop this incoming attack.

“Buzz!” The Yang God reached out with one finger. Another sun appeared and the same fire descended. With a sizzling sound, Terra’s huge shield was burnt to a crisp.

Terra was horrified and immediately used a secret technique. With some strange noises, everything around him froze. This powerful glacier stopped the refined sunfire.

Everyone was both curious and scared of the Yang God with the suns in his control. They stared at Li Qiye’s kingdom of blood and noticed that there were eight more figures inside. This made them tremble even more.

At this moment, he had only sent out four deities, yet he could fight against powerful characters like Resplendent, Guojian, and Terra. If he sent all eight out, just how mighty would this force be?

“What is that thing?” No one knew what this kingdom of blood and the deities presiding within were.

They weren’t exactly avatars nor were they devils and gods. In fact, Li Qiye might have called them gods and devils, but the reality was that they were twelve weapons. Back at the Buddhist Funeral Plateau, Li Qiye made a deal. He would stop using its power while they would have to give him materials that they had been storing for a long time. These materials consisted of broken metals that were floating in the void space.

And yes, they were not simple pieces of broken metal, they were scraps from the Myriad Thoughts Pot! Back in a distant era when the world was still in its early stages, the pot took form and became one of the nine heavenly treasures. Of course, there were pieces left behind from this transformation that were taken by the plateau.

After the transaction, he used the flame from the green lantern to refine this scrap iron into twelve metallic men. Afterward, he placed them into the kingdom of blood and cultivated them using the blood energy and worldly essence within. At the same time, he added the twelve Immortal Physiques to them. Each figure corresponded to one of the twelve physiques.

During the sacrificial ceremony, he used his own vitality to empower the iron men. From a certain perspective, they were his weapons based on his physiques. Thus, whatever level his physique was at, the twelve iron men would be at the same level, so they were also at half completion like him.

For these avatar-esque creations, Li Qiye named them the twelve gods and devils. Six were made from imperial intents while the other from devil intents.

They had the following names: Diamond God, Sacred Spring God, Eternal God, Extreme Yang God, Soaring God, Void Imperfection God, Furious Devil, Solar Devil, Heaven Devourer Devil, Void Devil, Hell Suppression Devil, and Sky Destroyer Devil.

These physique weapons were made from the scraps of the Myriad Thoughts Pot as well as the blood energy of Immortal Emperors and the Blood Progenitor. They were already incredible even before taking the Immortal Physiques into account. Therefore, at half completion, their might was incredible.

“Buzz!” A third sun rose from the Yang God’s palm and immediately melted the ice world.

With metallic clanks, the refined sunfire turned into laws that nailed themselves into Terra to trap him.

Terra was much weaker compared to the Yang God, so he had no way of resisting this imprisonment. This made the crowd think hard. Terra was a paragon at best, so they found it strange that he would act so arrogant with so little power. He even dared to challenge Ruyan and the others. Where was his courage coming from?

“Whoosh!” The sunfire had engulfed Terra’s entire body. He was screaming and burning as he was unable to withstand this pain.

Suddenly, a miracle happened. His body turned to wood after a green brilliance engulfed him. He had become a man made out of wood. This green light was stopping the flame as if it had a majestic vitality.

“Atavism!” The treants here knew what was going on right away.

“Buzz!” Two more suns emerged from the Yang God’s finger. There was a total of five suns pouring down their endless flames in order to refine Terra in a crazed manner.

With more sizzles, the green light was destroyed. The overbearing sunfire began to work on Terra’s body once more. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

No one knew what tribe Terra was from to allow him to withstand fire this well. Despite the intensity of the flames, it took some time before it completely charred him.

Alas, green leaves grew from his body and the blackened body was full of life again. It was as if he had just been reborn.

“Li, you can’t burn me to death!” Terra complacently shouted while being shrouded in the sunfire.

Li Qiye didn’t seem to care. He smiled and said: “Don’t worry, I’m very patient. Killing a puppet like you couldn’t be simpler, I just want to force out your old geezer.”

“Buzz!” Five more suns emerged from the Yang God’s other hand. At this moment, a total of ten suns were assaulting Terra.

“Ah!” His pitiful cries echoed across the region, making others shudder in fear.

In a short period of time, he was burned to charcoal while writhing in agony. He struggled but couldn’t escape due to being trapped by the laws made out of fire. Alas, the endless life force came again alongside the green brilliance. His body was revived by the great vitality.

This time, he could withstand the burning flames and became even more proud. He blurted with a hysterical laughter: “Haha! Li, you can’t burn me to death even with ten thousand suns. You better start praying, when I escape, I will crush you like an ant with a single finger!”

Everyone was creeped out while watching this bizarre spectacle. Some even felt that Terra was being killed and resurrected multiple times. No one understood where this boundless vitality was coming from to bring him back to life whenever he was on the verge of death.
