Chapter 5001: Devouring Maddened Flames

“Poof!” Elemental King unleashed two fiery beams - one pure and the other had an ice infusion.

This combination managed to morph time and space while maintaining a unique domain. The madness of the flames was somehow soothed by the chilling affinity, resulting in a stable attack.

Ming Shi and the others couldn’t help but gasp in awe. They had seen the frenzied flames several times in the past from Fire Ape and Maddened God. Elemental King’s attack seemed to be a different world in comparison.

This might be the reason why Ice-fire Palace was considered the orthodox branch of Maddened Lineage.

Ice and fire twisted together to form a prison around Flame-eater Child. Just a single ember contained enough power to reduce a peak into lava.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, the boy slammed against the prison without getting hurt in the slightest. Nonetheless, he couldn’t get out of the domain.

“Follow me back!” Elemental King ordered.

“What is he trying to do?” Ming Shi could see that the king didn’t wish to harm his opponent: “Flame-eater Child isn’t from Ice-fire Palace.”

The king was an ancient ancestor with five fruits while his opponent only had three. It wasn’t difficult for him to slay the boy at all but this didn’t seem to be his intention.

“The boy might be worth his time.” Yunyun whispered: “After all, he’s a miracle.”

The others agreed with this assessment. Flame-eater wasn’t taught by an ancient ancestor but still managed to reach such a high level. Therefore, the palace was most likely interested in learning the process.

Alas, only their king was strong enough to suppress the boy without killing him.

After several slams to no avail, the slow-witted Flame-eater Child tried something else. He opened his mouth and sucked the fiery walls of the prison as if he was a whale.

“What…?” Elemental King became startled since he understood the force contained within his flames.

Other dragon lords didn’t dare to face them directly. Even blocking with treasures didn’t always work.

“This doesn’t make any sense.” Ming Shi said: “Wait, his title…”

The domain weakened as a result. The king didn’t give up and shouted: “Fine, let’s see your limit!”

He activated the five fruits and fused them into a maddened source. They rotated continuously and turned the domain into something monstrous. Air and the fabrics of reality were melted into liquid form.

The high temperature reduced the ground into scorched earth. Nothing could survive even though the sole target was Flame-eater Child.

The boy continued devouring the flames. Alas, the sheer volume immobilized him while he became engulfed in lava.

Elemental King didn’t quite understand. His world of flames was endless yet the boy was somehow unfazed. He had never experienced something like this previously.

“Whoosh!” The sky suddenly turned dark due to a massive figure approaching. The eyes were so big that they resembled two suns.

“Elemental King, this is my territory!” A dignified voice thundered.

“Wild Dragon!” Goldcrest became emotional.

“Boom!” A large claw smashed downward, scaring everything within a ten-million-mile radius.

“Go!” Elemental King sent his maddened domain upward to stop the dark claw.

The shockwaves from the impact vaporized the peaks nearby and frightened the spectating youths.
