Chapter 5282: Wife Killer, Dao Seeker

“It’s running away!” Li Zhitian shouted.

“No need to hesitate, follow it and we can get out of here.” Li Qiye smiled.

The group immediately gave chase and kept a close distance. However, Zhitian had several questions: “What is this thing? Why does it appear in both reality and dreams?”

He was sure that the tavern was the reason for the trunk’s appearance in the dream.

“A few things might not exist in reality but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Once you find the connection between reality and non-reality, you’ll be able to travel between them.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“So this tavern is the connection.” Li Zhitian understood and reflected on the experience.

After a while, he asked: “Who is the person dreaming?”

“The question should be, which one.” Li Qiye said.

“So there’s more than one.” He understood the implication.

“The minds and thoughts of an entire group.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“Existences that have once ruled the world.” The old servant added.

As for the tavern, it escaped into the fog and evaded the group.

“It’s gone.” Li Zhitian said.

Li Qiye smiled and entered the screen of fog with everyone else. They didn’t see the vast expanse this time - only a grand mountain.

“Hmm…” The old servant became serious and observed the scenery, eventually recognizing the location.

At the very top of the peak, there was a gigantic statue being crucified and immobilized. However, it seemed so vivid - depicting the victim laying on his back with his front exposed. His eyes were pecked out by eagles and his heart was devoured by wild bears, prompting him to howl in agony.

This process would repeat every day. His eyes and heart would grow again only to be eaten once more. After the long years, he turned into a statue that only knew two things - pain and scream.

“Eagle Peck Peak.” The old man murmured its title.

“This is the legendary place, virtually sure-death for intruders?” Li Zhitian became startled.

The old servant nodded.

“So he’s the supreme sword emperor, right? To be chained and tortured here for eternity.” The youth stared at the pinnacle.

This was a legendary peak in the six continents. In reality, it had existed long before the formation of the continents. However, few in history could enter and leave this place alive.

According to the tales from a distant epoch, a swordsman roamed the land and earned the title of emperor with his dao.

During his unbeatable prime, he fell in love with the daughter of an older emperor - a supreme beauty of that era.

They enjoyed happiness together but this didn’t last. The emperor was not pleased with stagnation; his heart devil convinced him to kill his beloved wife in order to reach the next level.

This naturally invoked the wrath of his father-in-law who gathered an alliance of other emperors and monarchs, ending up with his capture.

The ancient emperors sealed him into this peak with the ultimate curse - never being able to reincarnate until the end of time.

His imprisonment and cries lasted for numerous eras until the great calamity. With the destruction of the thirteen and the formation of the six continents, the curse was lifted and he became a statue.

Rumor has it that even during the worst period, he still didn’t give up on the sword dao. He endured the pain while continuing to sharpen his mind.

Thus, in spite of his current state, his sword dao had accumulated enough to turn the peak into its embodiment.

Only the strongest could survive the rampant sword energies. They tried to learn his sword dao but most found that this was impossible. The geniuses capable of this returned and lamented the waste of time: “Its murderous intent is uncontrollable, falling into an evil path is inevitable.”

“We should walk around it, right?” Li Zhitian asked.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Let’s go take a look.” Li Qiye smiled and climbed the peak.

Li Zhitian and the others took a deep breath. They channeled their merit laws and grand dao, resulting in a protection barrier.

They had heard of stories about conquerors and dao lords failing before, not daring to underestimate it.

They saw bones starting at the base. These victims stood no chance and were instantly cut down by sword energies.

The higher up they got, they saw fewer bones. These ones brimmed with divinity - clearly mighty cultivators who eventually faltered.

The climb continued and all three sensed terrifying slashes, wanting to eviscerate everything under the heaven. Each strand of energy could pierce an unprotected dao fruit.

Both the old servant and Li Zhitian started feeling sharp pain everywhere; their barriers were not fully working.

Once they made it to the ridge, True Bear couldn’t withstand it any longer. The sword energies here could instantly kill a regular ancestor.
