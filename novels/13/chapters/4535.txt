Chapter 4536: What Is Home?

“There were ties indeed, and?” Li Qiye said flatly.

“Young Noble, may I ask whether our branch has a chance of returning to our home or the primary branch?” Yu Zu was happy to hear this.

“You tell me.” Li Qiye said: “If this was the goal, your clan wouldn’t have waited until now to do something. You all have been robbing and stealing for eras now, completely free and unrestrained. Can you change your way after returning to that place?”

“Well…” Yu Zun couldn’t answer right away.

“Do wild monkeys like being stuck in cages?” Li Qiye went on: “Of course, I’m not praising your lifestyle at all, it isn’t admirable.”

He paused for a bit and continued: “Say, your clan is willing to change your way but the real question is, would the main branch accept you? Remember, the original clan is a righteous faction. Their ancestors were prestigious characters walking on the path of justice. As descendants, albeit a side branch, what did you choose to do? Though nothing heinous such as murdering the innocent, you all have been reduced to bandits.”

“We…” Yu Zun was tongue-tied again.

Jian Ming who was nearby came over and whispered: “Fatty, what’s wrong with you today? Why so sentimental? This isn’t your style, you damned bandit.”

“When it’s all said and done, we still need a home.” Yu Zun sighed and bitterly said: “Our members have been rootless for generations now, born in the sky and buried in the ground without memorial tablets and offerings. In other words, no more than stray spirits in the wilderness.”

He became emotional after saying this. For their branch, God Vessel was their home. Alas, it wasn’t a suitable site for a cemetery. This meant that their end was rather sad and lonely.

Living on the ship was fine. Alas, this was only temporary and nothing else was there after death.

This rootless type of existence left them sad for some reason. Of course, some of them have attempted to live permanently in other places. This just didn’t work out - perhaps it was due to their bloodline demanding freedom.

The current clan wasn’t doing badly. It wasn’t prosperous but could still be considered a great power, albeit in the absence of an ancestral ground or vast territory.

“Your ancestor was a sinner, now, his descendants are the same way.” Li Qiye shook his head: “This makes it difficult for them to accept you.”

Yu Zun didn’t say anything because this was a sore spot for the clan. Sure, they haven’t done anything heinous and only picked targets who were deserving of being robbed. Alas, this didn’t abdicate them from all responsibilities.

Ultimately, their branch was banished from the main clan. How could they ever return without this being resolved somehow?

“Seems like we are destined to drift forever.” Yu Zun smiled bitterly.

“How do I put this, there are two sides to everything. Your nomadic lifestyle has advantages and disadvantages. The former is simple, always being able to run during moments of danger. On the other hand, other great powers can’t uproot their home.”

“That is an advantage indeed.” Yu Zun admitted.

If they were to meet a powerful enemy or any danger, their vessel could instantly flee to an unknown location. This could potentially save their entire clan from any casualty.

“That’s why settling down isn’t necessary but of course, it’s not impossible if that is your wish.” Li Qiye said.

“Please guide me, Young Noble.” Yu Zun bowed.

“Pick a spot and destroy God Vessel. How can your clan drift anymore without it?” Li Qiye said.

“But, but God Vessel is our very foundation.” Yu Zun blurted.

“Having a ship as a foundation meant floating forever. You might probably think that you just need to stop flying it and pick a place. However, when danger comes one day, will your clan fight to the bitter end or just fly away once more? Which has a high probability?”

“We wouldn’t stay and die.” Yu Zun answered.

Their clan has grown used to running at the first sight of danger, even losing their shoes in the process. This generational way of life has been embedded deep in their bones.

“Other clans and sects can try to defend their territory for the sake and prosperity of their descendants. This land was built with generations of blood.” Li Qiye said: “There is no perfect outcome, a price is necessary. If you want a home, use your life to build one. Of course, there is nothing wrong with prioritizing survival and avoiding danger either. It’s about choices and from these choices come karma and consequences. These things don’t just fall down from the sky. Make your decision for the sake of your descendants.”

“Choices…” Yu Zun murmured.

“If you wish to have a permanent home, ask yourself and the clan whether you have enough determination to do it. If not, then keep on drifting and attribute this to not being the right time.” Li Qiye finished. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Having said that, he started walking out. The group hurriedly caught up.

“Hmm…” Yu Zun stood there in a daze.

Once the group left, Jian Ming looked back at the barely-visible ship amidst the clouds. This looked like a scene from the legend.

“This ship is amazing, nearly impossible to make a breakthrough for attackers.” Jian Ming salivated.

This ship protected the Yu for many eras now - a testament to its value.

“Its origin is rumored to be frightening.” The daoist said: “A supreme artifact during the ancient era. The ancestor of the Yu got lucky and found it during the great calamity or he would have died.”
