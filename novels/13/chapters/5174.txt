Chapter 5175: Time Erases All

The item was a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant - something normally worn by women.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It was intricately crafted from an unknown gemstone with a radiant glow, possessing a profound sophistication. Opening the pendant revealed a portrait that looked rather animated due to the special method.

Li Qiye was surprised for a second since this was his portrait.

“Where did you get this?” He asked Hallowedsteel.

“This was passed down to me during my youth by our founder before her passing.” Hallowedsteel said softly.

Adamantine Godmonarch didn't have children so as a member of a side branch, he was chosen to carry the heirloom.

During his youth, she had told him many wondrous tales including the great wars. However, she also told him about the times before that.

He recalled a legend regarding one man. Whenever she told stories about him, she would open the pendant to gaze at the portrait, lost in a deep trance.

As he grew older, his knowledge also expanded and he understood the significance behind this.

“I see.” Li Qiye understood.

“Her last message was if I ever come across the man in the pendant, give it to him.” Hallowedsteel looked up to stare at Li Qiye and understood that it was really happening.

This has been on his mind since his childhood but he never expected to meet Li Qiye before. He managed to survive for so long and as he was facing the end of his lifespan, he finally met the man himself.

He understood the gravity of the situation. The founder was an amazing existence with a glorious past, meaning that this man was on another level.

“Very well, I shall take it.” He accepted the pendant and wiped the portrait.

“The ancestor said that those days were her happiest memories and how she yearned for the past.” Hallowedsteel spoke with fear in his voice.

Li Qiye sighed and memories resurfaced - a girl who was stubborn and hotheaded before becoming as gentle as water.

Alas, death was inevitable even for an exceptional cultivator. Those in his past started leaving, one by one.

“I understand.” He stared at them and said: “Out of consideration for your progenitor, I will not pursue this matter.”

“Thank you, Young Noble.” Hallowedsteel glared at his men before kowtowing one more time.

All of them left afterward, leaving Li Qiye behind with Saintess Shao Yao who was staring curiously at him.

As for Li Qiye, he remained immersed in old memories - a time when he traveled with a diverse group and the young miss.

However, he was only a passerby who left rather quickly without leaving many traces. Despite his short stay, he still left a deep impression and changed someone’s fate.

If it wasn’t for him, she would only be a minor cultivator at best - perhaps the sect master of a weak sect. She would be buried in the river of time and the same for her sect.

In actuality, she ended up becoming a divine monarch and tried to catch up in order to see him one more time.

Unfortunately, due to her limited talent, she passed away without being able to see him. The only remaining trace of their relationship was her memento.

“The supreme is emotionless because time does not permit otherwise.” Li Qiye said softly, understanding that no one could overcome the restriction of time.

He then glanced back at the girl and said: “Why are you still here? This place is dangerous and you’re not strong enough.”

“I’m looking for a particular medicine.” She was scared to look at him in the eyes.

“What?” He frowned.

“A floating immortal lotus.” She felt tense when talking to him.

“There’s one here indeed.” He said.

“Right, you saw it too. I couldn’t catch it fast enough and it ran away.” She lifted her head and saw his eyes. This caused her to blush and lowered her head again: “My cultivation isn’t strong enough to capture it.” Her voice was as quiet as a mosquito buzzing toward the end.

“Only an alchemy emperor can catch one effortlessly.” He shook his head: “As for you, you need an enticing mist to lure it first.”

“Young Noble, so you do know the alchemy dao.” She became excited.

“To be exact, I am indeed related to your sect.” He smiled.

“How so?” She felt her heart beating faster when talking to him.

“It’s long ago, no need to dwell on it.” He responded: “Fine, I’ll lend you a hand. Catch it and leave quickly before this place becomes your grave.”

“I understand.” She became excited.

He didn’t say anything else and started walking. The girl filled with different emotions followed right behind him.

“To find this lotus, one must walk upstream. It is usually hiding at the source.” Li Qiye taught her along the way.

She listened attentively in order to learn. After a long lecture, she couldn’t help but ask: “Young Noble, are you an Alchemy Emperor?”

Her master was also an Alchemy Emperor whose knowledge in this field was second to none.
