Chapter 5479: Absolute Dominance

The woman took her time sensing the unique auras of the world. After a while, she opened her eyes and said: “How wonderful, really a cause for hesitation.”

“Hesitation doesn’t save it from being reduced to ashes.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re ruining the mood.” She said angrily.

“We both know what will happen.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“I am not the one responsible.” She tilted her head and said.

“Then who is responsible? My epoch is nearly at its prime, the inevitable is coming.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes.” She pondered for a moment and admitted: “The path that you’re on will actually hasten it.”

“That’s not surprising.” Li Qiye said: “So it won’t be you.”

“Everyone has their own karma and body, the same for me.” She shook her head.

“Then perhaps it is time for a change, a new body.” Li Qiye said. [1]

“True, that body has been gone for a long time.” She said.

“It’s rather commendable. Entering and learning the world, growing to love it, enduring hardships without any regret.” Li Qiye said.

“Trying to persuade me?” She uttered coldly.

“That’s useless. You are not stronger than the other body, there is nothing you can do for me even if you stay here.” He said.

“Looking down on me?” She glared at him: “Perhaps the beating last time was insufficient, not taking me seriously anymore after barely surviving.”

“Of course not.” He shrugged: “You are perfection across the ages, transcending and ever transforming, neither male nor female nor anything else…”

“Is that an insult?” She seemed eager to beat Li Qiye down; her eyes flashed menacingly.

“I’m merely speaking the truth, you didn’t look like this the last time we met. Plus, male or female, there’s no difference at all to you since you are beyond such definition.” He said.

“Whatever.” The woman scoffed: “He is him and I am me, he has his own karma and so do I.”

“A single wish can change all of this. The karmic ties of the world do not bind you, you have a separate karmic system altogether just like him. Everything can be resolved.” He said.

“Your attempt at creating a rift between us is useless.” The woman said: “We have the same source so it’s idiotic that you’re even trying.”

“Is that so? Under the previous circumstances, sure, but what about now? If I remember correctly, a different body does not think so.” He said.

“So what? Born from a hundred deaths but it’s all fleeting, just merely surviving in this world.” She said.

“Isn’t that enough? Having fought countless emperors alone and sweeping through the continents.” He said.

“That’s just strutting around in an anthill, not worth mentioning. The past body could have destroyed numerous epochs with a single wave.” She said with disdain.

“You’re not wrong, it’s definitely not on the same scale.” He paused for a bit and said: “However, that ant certainly enjoyed their time and life. Only by actually experiencing life would one be able to learn of its joys.”

“Am I not a living being right now?” She said.

“You are alive, not a rock, but you have too much awareness of your own. You’re not settling in, choosing to observe the world instead of actually experiencing the joy of life.” He said.

“Don’t forget about the suffering.” She snorted.

“As long as there are living beings, there will be joy and suffering.” He nodded.

“No need to persuade me.” She shook her head: “He is deeply infected by the mortal coil, not I. I do not have such karma and need not such karma.”

“Yes, your karma originated from a single thought and source.” He said.

“If I were you, I would think more about how to escape or your preference of how to die.” She suggested.

“I’m afraid I haven’t thought of either.” He smiled.

“I suppose your confidence is still intact despite running with your tail between your legs back then.” She snorted.

“Let’s not dwell on the past and plus, I consider it a victory since you couldn’t kill me.” He smiled.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Hmph, we’ll get another opportunity soon enough.” She sneered.

“That day will come, but you probably won’t remember what you have said today.” He said flatly.

“This world is ephemeral, nothing more than a passing cloud. Dissipating is inevitable, no need to leave traces.” She said.

“This is your karma and your meaning of existence?” He asked.

“Skip this nonsense. Everything is possible, my body can be his or that body, and the three can be united as one again.”

“I think it’s impossible to have three bodies now.” He smiled.

“Not right now but in the future, the near future.” She pondered for a moment before responding seriously.

Li Qiye’s expression changed as well. He nodded in agreement: “Yes, that body will definitely appear.”

“And that is when your epoch shall be destroyed.” She tapped his shoulder and said: “See, I’m nice enough to give you a heads up so you can prepare in advance lest be caught off guard.”

“How can I ever repay you?” He joked.

“Do you actually want to repay me?” She asked.

“No, only if you stay. How can I repay someone who won’t be here?” He waved his hand.

“Hmph, always scheming.” She sneered.

“How am I scheming when it is entirely up to your desire?” He disagreed.

“It’s not possible. My body is incomparable to his, you have an immovable dao heart, I have an immovable body. You have no control over it.” She said.

“Yes, I am powerless here indeed.” He nodded.

“Just accept reality, death will come knocking.” She said.

“Death, to me, is also joy, a sweet release.” He earnestly said.

“What if death avoids you?” She stared straight at him.

He understood the implication and let a sigh before replying: “It’s inevitable, each has their own destiny.”

1. I could use the word avatar here but it’s not quite that word. That would be an interpretation so once there is more context, I might start using avatar instead. Right now, it’s a simple word for body but I’m sure the author is talking about avatars ☜
