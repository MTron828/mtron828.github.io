The contest between the defending disciples and the drill intensified. The former roared and channeled their vitality and chaos true energy into the grand formation.

The barriers could stop the drill but not the attacks from Three Truths Sect Master.

“Break!” This sect master mercilessly sent down mountains, successfully cracking the barriers.

“Don’t let up!” The elders in charge roared, no longer holding back their affinities in order to fix the barriers.

The repair was swift but the sect master was even faster. He performed several more attacks and destroyed another section of the barriers.

“This looks grim.” The spectators shook their head, aware of the incoming doom.

When this barrier broke down, the army would be able to invade Divine Black, leaving nothing in their path.

Ping Suoweng himself became alarmed and glanced back.

“Fellow Daoist, I’m your opponent. Don’t be distracted now or you’ll die to my sword.” Lu Yiling smiled.

This wasn’t self-serving praise, only the truth. He was considerably stronger than Suoweng. Suoweng understood this as well. He took a deep breath and calmed his dao heart, throwing away all external matters. He needed to face this foe first.

“Let’s begin, let me see your supreme sword art.” Suoweng released his sword dao, resulting in a clank. This dao encompassed the entire sect.

“Good!” Yiling’s eyes lit up while watching this sword dao. He couldn’t wait any longer to test his might against a worthy foe: “Everyone says that your South Conch Sword Art is the greatest of this generation, it is my pleasure to test it today!”

He unsheathed a long sword but not any of the three on his back. This one was hanging by the waist.

It looked quite clear as if it was made from part of the sky. Nonetheless, it still had a murderous intent, especially against demons and evil creatures. Its aura seemed to be built on the souls of its victims. This was another dao lord weapon.

“Show me your Three Truths Sword Art!” Suoweng spoke and immediately made his move that encompass both offense and defense, simple yet complex.

“It’s starting.” The spectators became excited.

“South Conch versus Three Truths Sword Art, this is as good as it gets, the apex of the sword dao. We only see a battle like this once every ten thousand years if we’re lucky.” An elder became emotional.

“Now!” Yiling didn’t waste time and roared. His sword also roared with him and released a true dragon slash with three different colors.

“Boom!” This sword energy immediately crushed the airspace above in a dominating manner as it soared towards Suoweng.

“Die!” Suoweng didn’t relent and dragged his sword from the bottom up, creating a mountain of swords in order to seal the area, stopping all onslaught.

“Rumble!” This still wasn’t enough to stop Yiling. The three-colored dragon destroyed the sword mountain.

In this split second, the energy channeled back into Yilin’s sword as he struck Suoweng’s blade, sending the guy flying through the air.

Suoweng’s internal energy churned, causing him to spit out several mouthfuls of blood. Once he stabilized, he still trembled with a pale complexion.

Yilin was clearly stronger. The two of them performed their strongest technique but Suoweng became seriously injured right away.

“It’s done, Suoweng can’t do this.” The spectators found this astonishing.

“Yes, Divine Black can’t get out of this disaster.” A high elder murmured while looking at the pale Suoweng.

“Lu Yiling is so strong, worthy of being a renowned genius.” Another praised.

Yilin was far younger than Suoweng and Three Truths Sect Master. Alas, he had more than caught up to the two of them. This was worthy of admiration and awe.

“Activate the formation!” Suoweng shouted, not bothering to look at his wounds.

“Boom!” Sword energies from South Conch Peak engulfed the area in the form of a beam. A majestic sword image emerged. Its energy swept through the nine heavens and ten earths.

“South Conch Sword Formation!” The disciples of South Conch empowered this mighty formation. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The sword image immediately fused with Suoweng. He became resplendent with sharp rays. His energy erupted along with his sword intent. All the swords in the world seemed to be heeding his summon.

“Clank!” He disappeared from sight, replaced by a gigantic divine sword with an ancient aura.

“Now!” He commanded. The sword unleashed a slash straight for Yilin.

It crossed through ten thousand miles and severed the karmic ties, space, and time. The spectators couldn’t believe its power.

“What a move!” One astonished crowd member shouted.

“Come!” Yiling was happy to see a powerful sword technique. His three-colored energy erupted as well.

“Three Truths Sword Dao!” He actually had three separate sword dao, situated to his left, center, and right. They fused together and also formed a great sword.

“Clank!” It immediately retaliated against the incoming slash. This one focused on weight, seemingly possessing the immensity of three thousand worlds. This granted the slash an all-crushing force.

“Bam!” The gigantic sword dao struck the heavy sword dao; the victor wasn’t clear.

Terrible sword energies swept outward, destroying the fabrics of reality.

“Brother Suoweng, your sect is doomed if this is all you got.” Yiling laughed as he began using the power of the three swords behind him.

They were still in their sheath but their energy exuded regality and supremacy. It was as if a dao lord was here in person - a true master of the sword.
