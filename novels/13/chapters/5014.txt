Chapter 5015: What Happened?

“Commanding God!” The demons and beasts prostrated after seeing him.

This was different from the other dragon lords. The latter’s auras forced them to submit. In this case, he was a commanding lord - a god of sorts in their heart.

As long as he remained in this position, they would always worship him. Only powerful existences such as Wild Dragon and Golden Cicada didn’t need to kneel.

“It is an honor to be in your presence, Commanding God.” Golden Cicada said.

The other dragon lords also bowed slightly, not daring to slight him.

“Hahaha, finally!” Wild Dragon laughed.

“Sovereign, why do you insist on meeting me?” Bloodfly God’s words seemed to be coming from the nine layers of hell.

A god exuding malice and evil affinity - a truly dreadful being.

He didn’t underestimate Thousand-faced Sovereign and focused his blood-colored eyes on this potential adversary.

His power was one thing but this wicked aura made him look more like a devil than a god.

“You rarely show up so I am specifically here to ask a few questions.” Thousand-eyed Sovereign said. His echoing words chased away the commanding god’s evil aura.

“You have a thousand faces indeed, capable of spotting all my movements.” Bloodfly responded.

The other dragon lords thought the sovereign lived up to his reputation. They couldn’t spot Bloodfly because this was Demon. The commanding gods were omnipresent and elusive here.

Nonetheless, the sovereign still managed to force him out.

“This minor art is not worth mentioning.” The sovereign said. His very presence instilled peace and courage into listeners.

“My question is, did Phenomena visit this place?” He got to the point.

No one expected this question because they thought that Phenomena had already left for the upper continents.

Plus, as his master, shouldn’t the sovereign know the most about him?

“Why are you asking me about your disciple? I do not know.” Bloodfly shook his head.

No one had a problem with this answer. Plus, did it really matter? The conqueror was no longer in the lower continents.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The dragon gods exchanged glances and knew that there was more to this story.

“Do not deny this matter, Commanding God. I am sure of this and only want you to elaborate.” The sovereign said with a serious tone, ready to get to the bottom of this.

“Very well.” Bloodfly God said: “Phenomena Conqueror did come to ask me a question.”

“Regarding the ancestral bone?” The sovereign asked.

“The ancestral bone?!” Everyone became emotional after hearing about this.

“The legendary bone?” Radiant Monarch lost his cool.

All eyes were on the sovereign, waiting for confirmation. This bone had caused a war between the two great factions before. It affected all six continents and top masters such as Heaven Burial and Demon Conqueror.

Bloodfly God himself was surprised. It took him a second to calm down and shake his head: “I’m afraid there is a misunderstanding. It was not pertaining to the ancestral bone.”

The crowd became disappointed after hearing this.

“Sovereign, the conqueror has information on the bone?” Skystomper couldn’t help but ask.

The sovereign didn’t answer him and continued to ask Bloodfly: “Why did Phenomena look for you then?”

The crowd only wanted to learn more about the ancestral bone but the sovereign had something else in mind.

Nonetheless, the dragon lords were still interested in this conversation. Why did Phenomena Conqueror look for Bloodfly God since Lunar Lineage had nothing to do with Demon.

“I don’t need to answer this. If you truly want to know, just ask the conqueror.” Bloodfly shook his head. Moreover, he was the stronger of the two since this was Demon. He was already being polite enough by entertaining these inquiries.

Curiosity grew among the listeners. It seemed unreasonable for the sovereign to come here with this level of aggression over some questions.

“Sounds like you are hiding something.” The sovereign didn’t hold back, ignoring that this was Bloodfly’s domain and preparing for a fight.

Radiant Monarch and the others understood that this must be justified in some way.
