Fortunately enough, one quick-witted youth interjected: “Speaking of Miracle Young Noble, I heard he came to the land of the fire source and met Vermillion Martial Goddess.”

“Yes, so I’ve heard too.” A different one replied: “But there was a man hanging around the goddess, seemingly very close. I think his last name was Li, but his background sect is unknown.”

“Last name Li?” Mu Yalan who was looking into the distance turned around and asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Right.” The youth noticed that the doctor had taken interest in the conversation and quickly said: “The goddess is incredible, the only youth to attack Insane Court in the alliance on top of coming back unscathed. However, no one knows anything about her companion, just that they are very close.”

“I believe there are rumors that their relationship is special, that’s why Miracle Young Noble is antagonistic towards him, resulting in a clash.” One more jumped in.

“What does he look like?” The two of sisters glanced at each other while having a pretty good idea about this man.

“Well, I’m told that this guy very ordinary look. No one understands why someone like the goddess would be with him. That’s why Miracle Young Noble was annoyed and even wanted to do something about it.” The youth responded.

“What happened next?” Shaoyao became interested because this was her first time hearing this story.

“I heard this Li guy burned Young Noble Wu Lian from Everlasting to ashes then declared his intention of destroying it, quite a fierce style.” The first guy who started this topic didn’t want to lose and added.

The two girls glanced at each other, knowing exactly who this Li guy was now.

“There are too many insane men in the world, ignorantly fearless. Just an ant wanting to talk about destroying Everlasting? He overestimates himself.” Hu Qingniu coldly uttered.

Qingniu wanted to show off his speaking skill but the atmosphere became quiet again. Outside of the two sisters, he and Zhang Yan had the highest status here. His frank statement left no room for others to retort without offending him.

Zhang Yan went crazy again since they just got the beauties’ attention. Now, Qingniu killed the conversation again.

“The world is full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons.” Yalan flatly responded, clearly on the side of this Li fella.

“Right, right, Miss Mu is completely right. Maybe that guy has an amazing background.” Zhang Yan quickly flattered: “That’s why he dares to say whatever he wants.”

“That’s useless.” Qingniu replied right away: “Everlasting is the strongest kingdom in the system with countless ancestors. Miracle Young Noble is an amazing genius himself. A nobody talking about destroying this lineage? That’s just the daydream of someone who’s tired of living.”

Zhang Yan almost vomited blood, not understanding why a medical genius was so socially inept, unable to read the situation.

He wanted to break the guy’s head and take a good look at his brains. Even a fool knew about the delicate situation between Longevity and Everlasting. Now, this Qingniu was praising Everlasting so the two sisters naturally wouldn’t like it. Alas, he couldn’t come up with a new topic.

“Miss Qin, what do you think about it?” Qingniu continued on and revealed a rare smile: “The world is full of ignorant fools. This guy boasting about destroying a kingdom is ridiculous. He might just be a youth that hasn’t experienced enough tribulations.”

Shaoyao didn’t say anything and continued to stare at the lake.

Everyone else was speechless. This guy didn’t realize he had said the wrong thing and was feeling quite pleased with himself. It looked like no one could talk when this conversation-killer king was around.

Mu Yalan who has been searching the area suddenly noticed something. She softly elbowed Shaoyao to get her attention. Shaoyao saw a remote island with someone digging then.

It was a man who couldn’t be more ordinary-looking. He was quite busy with pits and piles of mud around him. He was completely focused on the task as if he was trying to become a digging virtuoso.

The two girls heaved a sigh of relief then smiled after seeing who they were searching for - the First Brother.

Despite his dirty and muddy appearance, he was especially beautiful right now. As long as he was around, everything would be just fine and dandy.

Yalan was a proud apricot in the snow while Shaoyao was an orchid hidden deep in the valley. When they smiled, the youths lost their mind, instantly charmed by this gorgeous scene.

The girls didn’t know what Li Qiye was doing but they couldn’t come over either. They told their fellow disciples to stop the boat in order to watch him. In their eyes, the mud pits resembled windows that would need to another vast world. They didn’t know what his goal was but it certainly wasn’t just playing in the mud out of boredom.

The rest of the group looked over too. This was just another man that could be found anywhere on the street, nothing peculiar about him except his common and boring appearance. Qingniu and Zhang Yan believed that if they were standing side by side, no one would notice this guy over them.

In fact, another random guy from the street could overshadow this guy, let alone geniuses like them.

Alas, the two girls were completely fixated on each of his actions, as if nothing else in the world could be more interesting.

They became sour - what was the point of watching this guy? The guy looked wretched when covered in mud just like a beggar, certainly not a sight for sore eyes.

“Hey, what are you doing?!” Zhang Yan shouted at Li Qiye, full of annoyance.

“Treasure hunting.” Li Qiye answered casually without bothering to look at them.

“Oh? For what?” Shaoyao couldn’t help but ask.

“A really good one.” He replied without pausing.

“Miss Qin, that’s just a muddy beach but for some idiots, even a scrap metal found here could be considered a treasure. This penurious man at the bottom of society has never seen anything good. Give him a phoenix wood or raw alchemy branch, that might scare the crap out of him.” Qingniu was one to never give face and had zero sympathies for anyone.

He arched his chest proudly because he actually had these rare alchemy materials, more than a million year old. He wanted to show off to Qin Shaoyao.

However, she wasn’t interested in them at all. She stared at the pits and said: “What do you mean by a good treasure? Mind elaborating?”

“Are you digging for Alchemy Wood?” Zhang Yan could observe the situation far better than Qingniu. He could see that the two girls were interested in what he was doing so he wanted to keep this mood up.

As for whether this man could actually find something, he didn’t actually give a damn and only wanted to use him for conversational reasons.
