Chapter 5760: How Magnificent

He sighed while staring at the grave and asked her directly: “I want to excavate, is that alright with you?”

“...” She had no response.

“This is your beginning and everything else’s, it is also a place I must search.” He revealed.

“What are you searching for, Young Noble?” This distracted her from her circumstances.

“Something significant and unknown to the rest of the world, but it does exist.” He said.

“Is it a very expensive treasure?” She asked.

“If only, that would be so easy to find. It is something never seen before and pertains to a heavenly treasure.” He shook his head.

“A heavenly treasure.” She had no understanding of its significance: “Will you leave after getting it?”

Her eyes said that she didn’t want him to leave.

“I’m just a passerby and was not going to stay in the first place.” He stroked her soft hair.

“I see.” She lowered her head, looking disappointed.

“We may still meet again, it’s just that you won’t be yourself anymore.” He said.

“I won’t be myself.” She glanced at the grave and asked: “I, I will die now?”

He paused briefly before answering: “You are extraordinary, death has a different concept for you, you can become everlasting. Ultimately, it will be your decision on which form you take and what kind of person you will become.”

“I’m not sure I know what to do.” She asked for guidance.

“That is a question only you can answer.” He shook his head.

“I see...” She had too many questions regarding the future.

“I’m about to start, are you ready to face it?” He asked with a serious tone. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Young Noble, I am prepared.” She glanced at the grave and took a deep breath, nodding.

He raised his hand and caused loud explosions. The entire grave started floating upward.

“Crack!” Large cracks emanated from the center as the soil broke apart.

Eventually, a towering tomb emerged from below, leaving Ling’er with her mouth wide open.

She had never seen such a colossal structure before - this was beyond the scale of anything in this mortal world. The combined efforts of the realm couldn’t construct something this vast.

They looked like insects in comparison while staring at the pitch-black tomb. The entire thing seemed to be one piece, not made from separate blocks.

A slight tap on the surface made a sound different from if it was made from metal or stone. The crisp noise had an echo as if the material had countless holes within. Nonetheless, it felt immensely heavy. Just a small piece was too much for anyone to lift.

“How magnificent, a star refined and forged into this Nightstar Iron.” Li Qiye said.

This wasn’t any random star but one with a special affinity with the night stars. This was the work of an incredible cultivator.

“Where is the entrance?” She asked since there was no clear entrance to the tomb.

Nevertheless, she felt something calling her. A familiar sensation arose as if she had been here before.

When she got to the right spot, she touched the wall, revealing a bright gate.

Alas, they could not enter because it was sealed with endless transforming laws. Worlds were being created and embedded into the gate, preventing any offense or force from breaking through.

Li Qiye took a look and saw the endless mysteries and living beings in each world.

“Boom!” A mental detonation occurred next.

The complicated derivations and transformations could confuse any cultivator.

“Multiply.” Li Qiye, on the other hand, understood and placed his palm on the gate.

“Rumble!” The laws became chaotic, refusing to grant him entrance.

He activated his primordial light, commanding the rays to infiltrate the countless worlds. This immediately froze the laws from transforming. Everything came to a halt.
