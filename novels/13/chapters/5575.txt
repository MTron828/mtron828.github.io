Chapter 5576: Not Enough To Scratch An Itch

“Dao Brother, you are out of line.” A stirring voice had a profound impact on people’s mind. It entered and injected adrenaline, making them want to charge toward Niu Fen.

“Six-finger Conqueror.” Everyone looked over and saw a figure shrouded in light.

His voice was resonant and striking; one couldn’t help wanting to hear more from him. When he raised his hand, others noticed an extra finger. The sixth had a special ability and paved his way toward domination.

“Yes, watch what you say!” Others wanted to yell at Niu Fen after being affected by the voice.

Some voiced their support because Six-finger Conqueror had twelve dao fruits.

“And?” Niu Fen laughed arrogantly and annoyed others.

They thought that he displayed contempt despite being in the presence of so many top cultivators. Most importantly, they have become impatient after looking at the immortal weapon.

They didn’t have a reason to be aggressive but Niu Fen’s attitude could be used as justification against the group.

Niu Fen coldly looked around and sneered: “Do any of you actually think you are deserving of this weapon with your meager skills? Seems like I have many lessons to teach today in the young master’s stead, suicidal fools.”

“Dao Brother, your arrogance piques my curiosity.” One of the Five Elders said.

“Come, come.” Niu Fen waved provocatively while smirking: “Your grandpa is ready to give lessons.”

“Very well, allow me to see what you can do despite my meager skills.” Six-finger Conqueror was the first to step forward.

“I hope you have some special techniques and can last more than five moves, twelve-fruit conqueror.” Niu Fen laughed.

Six-finger Conqueror looked livid despite having a broad-minded attitude due to his cultivation and life experiences.

He once dominated his era and was now viewed as a clown by Niu Fen - a blatant showing of disrespect. Anger was unavoidable.

“Excuse me then, Dao Brother.” He roared and activated his majestic divinity and vitality. All twelve dao fruits erupted at the same time.

“Clank! Clank!” Sounds resembling clattering jade tiles and grand bells could be heard, resulting in an enchanting melody that infiltrated everyone’s consciousness.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Focus, protect your mind.” An emperor shouted after realizing something.

The others noticed too late because sealing the six senses was useless. A mental guard didn’t stop the invading melody either.

One big shot after another fell to the ground and instantly lost consciousness, becoming helpless prey.

“A dreadful song.” A dragon lord who resisted the sounds took a deep breath.

Just the melody of his aura alone left weaker cultivators defenseless on the ground.

“Try to block my finger strike, Dao Brother.” He raised his hand.

“Boom!” The sixth finger became resplendent, immobilizing dragon lords with three fruits and below.

“Come.” Niu Fen laughed and wanted to play a bit. He raised his shell and created the strongest defense possible.

“Bam!” The impact sent cultivators flying. Those who were unconscious, unfortunately, were reduced to blood by the shockwaves.

“Did you not eat lunch? So weak.” Niu Fen said with a smile, not forgetting to insult his opponent.

Six-finger Conqueror’s expression soured after hearing this.

“Let’s go together, he can’t block all of us!” Turmoil Conqueror stirred the crowd.

He summoned his talisman and poured down countless runes. Each was the size of a mountain, all descending with Niu Fen as the sole target.

“Puny insect, not even enough to scratch an itch.” Niu Fen did nothing but use his shell again.

Explosions detonated repeatedly but he remained untouched by the falling runes.
