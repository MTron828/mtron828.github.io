The crowd held their breath while staring at Li Qiye, eagerly anticipating his next move. They wanted to know his real strength. Perhaps Blade-reaper under this state would be able to show them some clues.

Ever since his appearance, Li Qiye’s power has remained a mystery. Even his merit laws were unknown.

Though he had participated in several battles, people still didn’t know of his cultivation method. They knew that he was the leader of Insane Court and the First Disciple of Longevity Valley, but he never used the merit laws from these two systems.

After all, a cultivator would have a main merit law, eventually derived into a grand dao. Despite his incredible sword dao so far, intuition told people that this still wasn’t his grand dao.

The gathering of power by Blade-reaper didn’t affect Li Qiye in the slightest, only earning him a brief glance of attention.

“Go first so that your effort won’t be wasted and you can show off your heaven-shattering move. I’m not a bully.” Li Qiye chuckled.

Everyone took a deep breath. Blade-reaper was very powerful right now, definitely stronger than Solitary Sword God earlier. Perhaps he was at the Eternal level.

Nevertheless, Li Qiye didn’t care at all and implied that the guy wouldn’t be able to block a single move from him.

Blade-reaper became annoyed. It took a lot of effort to reach this domineering level and confidence yet Li Qiye acted so aloof.

“Little animal, I’m going to cut you to pieces!” His shout broke the stars.

“Boom!” He raised both hands and two massive stars before throwing them straight at Li Qiye.

“Oh god!” Many were scared out of their mind since the sky suddenly turned dark and began to flee.

The world seemed to be on the verge of exploding with pockets of dust and ashes everywhere. A terrible flame engulfed the sky, a scene of the apocalypse.

The two stars became ashes after slamming on each other right by Li Qiye. Shockwaves reached the sky, destroying numerous stars. This was enough power to kill a thousand High Gods.

“Is it over?” The crowd felt their hair standing on end. This force was enough to turn an Ascender into a meat paste. They wondered what had happened to Li Qiye.

The dust eventually settled and the bright sky returned.

“Over there!” A sharp spectator saw and pointed at Li Qiye.

He was still floating there, not relenting an inch with an indifferent expression.

“So weak.” He wiped away the dust on his shoulder and shook his head: “You’re not a real Eternal, and your progenitor’s true blood has been sealed for too long, so the divinity is weak. Plus, it is only at the Myriad level.”

“Insane...” An ancestor smiled wryly. The Ascenders nearby all felt weak right now.

That powerful attack didn’t harm Li Qiye at all. This person was too heaven-defying. The crowd realized that only a real Eternal would be able to challenge him.

“Is he still human?” Another genius became silly: “The young generation no longer needs to compete with someone like him around, this will be his world.”

Just think about it, Saber Devil, Coiling Dragon, and Sword Sovereign - they had great individual achievements yet amounted to nothing before Li Qiye.

The youths here felt despair. Li Qiye could challenge Eternals right now. Even if one of them could become a True Emperor in the future, they might not necessarily be stronger than him.

“True blood of the Myriad level is more than enough to take your life!” The gigantic Blade-reaper furiously roared, unwilling to accept this reality.

Meanwhile, certain ancestors agreed with Li Qiye. The drop of true blood has been sealed for a long period so its divinity had weakened. Moreover, it was left behind when Heavenstart Ancestor was still only at the Myriad level, not when he reached the Imperial level. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Stop daydreaming. My turn to harvest.” Li Qiye chuckled before narrowing his eyes.

“Boom!” The area around him erupted and the world fell into endless darkness. The world was freed from sunlight.

“What’s going on?” The darkness confused the crowd because it wasn’t an illusion.

“Poof!” The stench of blood permeated the air as if death itself was descending.

A figure appeared, replacing Li Qiye. He was still Li Qiye but different - the embodiment of death.

The previous Li Qiye was still frightening but he was still a living being. This was no longer the case. This was a god of death, the origin of this affinity.

“What the hell is going on?” Experts were no stranger to death yet they still shuddered, not daring to look at his eyes. Gazing at this pair of eyes would be akin to looking at one’s final moment.

“He’s, he’s a monster! We all must kill him!” One True God shouted.

Li Qiye looked over at him and the force of death enveloped this True God.

“Buzz...” The god dried up, drained of life.

“No...” He could sense his life force being taken away, unable to do anything about it.

The guy turned into a dried corpse that eventually crumbled into dust, scattering into the wind.

Everyone watched this whole thing in astonishment.
