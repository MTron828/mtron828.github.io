Chapter 5844: I Didn’t Participate

They were far from being innocent after reaching the top. Their path included the destruction of sects and kingdoms.

Their battles and wars caused disasters to weaker cultivators and living beings, not to mention the land. The conflict between The People and The Race ravaged the continents for eras now.

Nevertheless, it was just war and the path toward becoming stronger through cultivation. Most emperors had no intention of turning living beings into alchemy medicines and pills.

The same couldn’t be said for these five overlords, splitting the world to prevent anyone from usurping them.

The major divide was established between the nine worlds and the thirteen continents, but they also created barriers between the continents just in case.

Worst of all, they went further with the blood sacrifice, killing the hundred races from the thirteen continents and the three races from the nine worlds. Of course, it wasn’t a perfect job and survivors hid from them successfully. Ultimately, around fifty percent of the population was wiped out.

Listeners shuddered because the list included powerful emperors and monarchs as well, not just mortals and weaker cultivators.

“How many of us were killed and refined?” An emperor behind the mirror murmured. After all, they had no chance of winning against these five overlords. Did the number of emperors go down drastically afterward? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Such a dreadful past.” The founder of Celestial Court let out a sigh after remembering the past and how powerless he was.

The three immortals, on the other hand, didn’t care. They were the chosen ones, spared from the horrendous fate. Others fought back, some begged, only to die in the end.

The overlords listened with a cold expression and didn’t comment.

“There’s no denying the past, so why the soured faces, just admit it. But, Old Primal, I’m not going to take the blame for you, I don’t mind being reviled by others but the blood sacrifice was your idea, you’re the real culprit but future generations keep on blaming me. That’s why I’m telling everyone today, stop blaming me.” Derivation continued.

“It’s because you’re hideous.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Fuck you!” Derivation barked back.

“I didn’t participate in the blood refinement.” Stonesplitter peeked out behind the shield and raised his hand: “I only agreed with splitting the two worlds, I didn’t carry out the refinement nor ate any blood pill.”

“Hahaha, you’re definitely the most cowardly among us, always looking up at the sky in fear, no different from a timid mouse.” Derivation burst out in laughter while pointing at Stonesplitter.

“I merely disagreed with such actions.” Stonesplitter’s expression soured.

“Oh? Feeling all righteous and want to clean your reputation. You speak as if you have done nothing wrong when you have done plenty of shady things for the sake of crafting an epoch artifact. Deep down, you wanted to refine Divine Ancestor into a weapon, no? I’ve seen through you, you wanted to refine Trinity Ancestor and his flawless fortunes. Unfortunately, you didn’t have the ability and neither did Primal, well, that’s true for all of us. That’s why we settled for the boy instead.” Derivation laughed and continued: “Haha, but you got nothing out of it.”

“Ambushing Divine Ancestor was not my idea.” Stonesplitter uttered coldly.

“True, it was Old Primal. I was there when he made the suggestion and sure, I wanted to eat the brat and his surely delicious inborn dao chaos physique, maybe create a new one afterward. Of course, as we all know, I’ve failed in this research but at least I got a good meal out of it. As for our dear friend Primal, he didn’t care about the physique. Remember how he devoured the brat, savoring each bite.” Derivation said.

“Jealousy against Trinity and Divine Ancestor.” Dao Ancestor added: “This is the dirty business of your blood branch.”

“Heh.” Derivation sneered: “Another righteous soul from the dao branch, if you all weren’t busy figuring out how to avoid the villainous heaven, you would have gotten your feet wet as well.”

“Hmph, we weren’t interested.” Imperial Progenitor scowled.

“Not interested? I recall someone indulging in the blood refinement. You and Dao Ancestor were in charge of refining the nine worlds, we know that you snuck a few bites, perhaps adding some members of the hundred races to sweeten the pot. Don’t pretend like you only refined the three races.” Derivation said.

“Nonsense.” Imperial Progenitor denied.

“I created the blood refinement method so I knew how much vitality and energy went into it.” Derivation said: “No one’s mocking you for enjoying a delicious feast, who doesn’t enjoy a good meal? Hmph, and don’t give me that excuse, you all were afraid of Trinity Ancestor’s retaliation so you didn’t participate.”

The others didn’t answer after hearing this.

Meanwhile, newer emperors could only imagine those dark days. Emperors such as themselves were the fattest fish in the pond. Moreover, even an overlord in Divine Ancestor was hunted and devoured.
