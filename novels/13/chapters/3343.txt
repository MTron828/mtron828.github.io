She looked like a dao lord standing there, causing people to tremble uncontrollably. They also felt the urge to prostrate.

The ones from Divine Black were astounded while her foes became scared out of their mind.

“Clank!” Feather let out a hymn of its own volition, seemingly awakening after sensing her aura. This was a harmonization between the seal and the sword.

Only a dao lord could do something like this. South Conch Dao Lord created this seal to be used with the patrimony sword. Thus, it had no problem controlling other dao lord weapons, especially when Feather once belonged to South Conch Dao Lord anyway.

Because of this, some elders and protectors believed that this was how Li Qiye summoned all the weapons in the grave - by using the sword seal.

The imprinted seal gave Qianyue ample power to control Feather.

“Clank!” One could hear a phoenix screech now. The sheathed Feather seemed eager to leave its sheath and started releasing terrible sword intents.

“Shit!” The two brothers became frightened after sensing this sword’s power. They knew that it wasn’t looking good for them.

“Decapitate.” Qianyue’s eyes turned cold as she commanded. “Clank!” Feather left its sheath.

In the next second, it exuded a sword light bright enough to illuminate the entire world. All living beings seemed insignificant compared to the sword intent of a dao lord. No one could keep their eyes open.

The disciples present were horrified and dropped to the ground. They couldn’t resist the pressure coming from the sword.

“Die!” The two brothers roared and released all of their vitality and power. These affinities rushed out like a flood.

They knew that this was a last-ditch effort and that escaping was futile. Turning to run would only hasten their demise. Thus, there was no need to hold back before the sword intent of a dao lord. Perhaps they would have a sliver of a chance by resisting.

The truncheon and moon fork released all of their potentials. Their power descended and nearly split the ground into two halves.

This was their strongest technique. “Rumble!” The world shook and spun with debris flying everywhere. Trees crumbled nearby while the spectators watched in awe.

Unfortunately, this move didn’t really stop Qianyue. Feather finally joined the fray.

“Whoosh!” Just a simple flash, nothing more.

The resulting slash looked like a meteor soaring through the horizon, leaving behind an eternal scar.

The flash this time wasn’t blinding like before. However, it commanded attention as if it was the only source of light in the world. Time came to a still.

The spectators became slack-jawed. They saw the slash easily cutting down the truncheon and moon fork. Next, the heads of the brothers flew into the air. Blood gushed out like two rainbows.

The severed heads were still lucid. They could see their body and felt the clear separation.

“Clank!” Time flowed again and one could finally hear the sound of Feather severing the two weapons.

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!” The two bodies and heads fell to the ground. Their mouth was open but no words came out.

They eventually closed their eyes - a relatively-acceptable death. Dying to a dao lord weapon wasn’t shameful at all. They could only blame themselves for being weak.

The crowd was emotional due to the invincibility of that slash. They finally realized just how strong a dao lord weapon was.

Everything was decided when Qianyue gained control of Feather. Earth-level weapons had no chance of contesting - the difference between eggs and rocks.

“Yes!” The disciples from Divine Black regained their wits and started cheering.

“First Sister is unbeatable! Our invincible genius!” They shouted.

On the contrary, Qianyue’s expression remained cold with no sign of celebration.

As for the ones from Three Truths, their legs were trembling. Some sat on their butt, no longer having the courage to try and run. When she glanced at them, they shuddered with fear and their teeth chattered.

Losing their two leaders was too much to take. They had no chance of winning now.

Qianyue’s sword had scared the wits out of them. But in reality, it didn’t even matter. She alone was strong enough to easily kill them given her cultivation.

The disciples from Divine Black slowly surrounded their foes. The latter tried to retreat but they were completely outnumbered. There was nowhere to run.

“What, what do you want?!” One of them said with fear. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They have lost both the Shu Brothers and their First Brother, Chen Chen. They had no one to lead them right now.

“What should we do with them, First Sister?” A disciple from Divine Black asked, ready to return the favor.

They felt so much better after reversing the tides. One guy from Three Truth actually pissed in his pants.

Of course, they didn’t dare to make a move without Qianyue’s permission. She stared at Li Qiye, waiting for a command.

The rest also followed her gaze. They no longer dared to disobey him.

“Scram, don’t let me see any of you again. Go back and tell your sect that if they come, I’ll kill them all.” Li Qiye didn’t bother to look at his opponents.

“Did you hear that?” Qianyue glared at them.

“Yes, yes, we will send the message.” They were ecstatic to be spared.

Since no one from Divine Black dared to oppose Li Qiye, they made way for the guys to leave.

The ones from Three Truths immediately ran as fast as possible to get out of this place.

“Yeah!!!” A celebration started among the young ones, elated after obtaining victory.

“We’re leaving.” Li Qiye said flatly before turning around.
