“Buzz.” Bingning instantly attacked as lightning bolts soared from her spear like a flood.

Of course, their speed was much faster than a flood. Just imagine the massive power of this attack, completely unblockable.

Before the physical spear started to move, the power crushed space itself as if it was a dried branch. All defenses, merit laws, and powers would be destroyed by this attack. There seemed to be a beast roar within the lightning. A leo could be spotted in this ocean of currents.

This was a divine beast. Its claws could tear everything in its path to pieces, only adding to the might of the lightning flood.

“Ra!” Its roar shattered the myriad laws. Everything returned to the origin because of this destruction.

This variation was too fast. People couldn’t even see how she unleashed it before sensing a prick on their forehead as if the thrust had pierced them. They instinctively took several steps back.

It aimed straight for Cloudcrossing Princess with unbelievable speed. People wondered if the princess could even dodge.

However, she didn’t try to do so and began to float using an unknown movement technique. She looked like a dandelion seed floating inside the flood of lightning. Her weapon of choice wasn’t a sword or an amazing treasure but just a long and thin wire, extremely agile. It moved around like a spirit snake and wove together a group of lightning bolts.

Keep in mind that these bolts were created by Bingning’s true energy. When the bolts were tied together, her energy became chaotic and uncontrollable.

This Lightning Leo move was domineering and required a gathering of all true energy before an explosion, leaving her in a vulnerable state.

Thus, the sudden churning of her own energy was dangerous.

“Boom!” The flood of lightning exploded and began to scatter. She suffered a backlash from her energy and spat out a mouthful of blood.

The princess didn’t waste any time and flicked her golden wire straight for Bingning’s throat, wanting to end this in one move. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Bingning flashed into disappearance after she activated her grass. The princess knew that her move wouldn’t connect and instantly retreated closer to Mu Shaochen.

“Boom!” Bingning showed up again, not on purpose. She suffered an implosion and spat out more blood.

Her energy flow remained chaotic. Although her grass allowed her to dodge the fatal move, it couldn’t calm her energy so this remnant force still blew her flying.

She couldn’t disperse the energy from her Lightning Leo that quickly. It failed to hurt Cloudcrossing Princess and only backfired on her, resulting in serious injuries.

She stabilized her stance and managed to subdue this chaos. This ended up depleting her reserve, no longer having enough to fight again.

“A martial goddess? Still a loser.” The princess looked down on her.

Despite her arrogant words, she didn’t dare to push her advantage, aware of the disparity between her and Bingning. She only won due to picking the right technique and was far inferior in terms of actual firepower.

The crowd was startled since the leo technique was defeated.

“You haven’t truly mastered this technique to the point of using and recalling it at will, that’s why chaotic energy will result in backlash.” Shaochen was very pleased with his method.

Bingning was pale from the wounds. Due to the incomplete nature of the twelve variations, she required powerful true energy in order to use her three variations. There was no going back once releasing this energy.

He noticed this flaw and chose to disrupt her true energy and creating a backlash.

The crowd shuddered. There were rumors of his great talents and comprehension already. It looked like they were true. No wonder why so many systems treated him so well. Just this ability alone could greatly benefit a system.

“Hmph, I’ll take you back first before dealing with you.” The ancestor from the martial court scowled and reached for her.

She readied her spear against the large palm energy, but even if she could fight, there was no chance of winning against an ancestor.

“Boom!” But the palm was instantly forced back by Yang Radiance Buddha.

He laughed and said: “Let’s not bully a junior now. Fight me instead.”

His interference didn’t come as a surprise. The ancestor from the martial court became serious: “You will continue to stick your nose in our business?”

“That’s right, at least this one.” The Buddha smiled.

“Very well, I’ve heard about your skills long ago, how about I join in?” The strongest ancestor from Jewelbanner stood up.

“He Jiang...” Other ancestors shuddered after seeing this new challenger.

He was a ninth-level Ascender, the strongest of the Jewelbanner. The guy could challenge Yang Radiance since he was on Shaochen’s side now.

Normally, a sect like Jewelbanner would never dare to do so. But this was no longer the case, Shaochen seemed unstoppable so Yang Radiance and Longevity Valley would eventually become their targets.

“Let us see what he can do.” The ancestor from Vermillion said and formed a pincer move against Yang Radiance Buddha.

The Buddhist cultivator became serious and slowly took down the shield on his back.

“Traitor, it is time for you to surrender or we will not show mercy.” At the same time, one ancestor from Sword Grave stared at Ling Ximo and said.

She naturally became horrified after hearing this.
