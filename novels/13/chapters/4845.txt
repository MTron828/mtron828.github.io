Chapter 4846: Dao Lord Versus Conqueror

These big shots started thinking about the possibilities, certain that this item was something extraordinary.

They also believed that he had it but didn’t want to hand it over. Did he not care about his dynasty in the case of death?

In reality, everyone had a good guess regarding Eight-stallion Dynasty’s future. If their founder were to die here today, the villains of Chaos would immediately divide it like a fat pig among themselves. Wild Dynasty might be the first to act. Therefore, Conceal’s threat seemed rather unnecessary.

“Make your move.” Conceal didn’t waste time and became ready for battle. The sky suddenly turned dark; the world became hell on earth from her power channeling.

The big shots were intimidated. This included conquerors watching in secret as well. Given her current cultivation, only Eight-stallion had a chance in the lower continents. Alas, he no longer had his shield.

“Very well, let us get started then. Our thousand-year feud will end today.” Eight-stallion laughed heartily: “I hope to see your seventh dao fruit. Excuse me.”

He gestured politely before attacking. He stomped the ground and lunged forward. The power of the dao lord immediately ravaged the battlefield. The floating broken peaks turned into dust due to the emergence of a terrible storm. If it were to leave this ancient battlefield, it could crush Chaos to pieces.

“Eight-stallion Force!” He roared and the tornado changed into the form of eight wind stallions.

This was the dao he used to prove his worth. The sheer physical power could annihilate anyone. A single one could destroy ten kingdoms. All eight would end a continent.

They all soared toward Conceal Conqueror with unstoppable momentum. However, she didn’t bother to hide.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Buzz.” She became radiant and peerless halos manifested into reality. They had the sharpest edge and could take down any incoming weapon.

Absolute Concealment - this was her supreme dao - a perfect combination of offense and defense. Just this single dao was all she needed.

The halos cut through the eight wind stallions without any problem. Of course, the dao lord’s dao was more than that. The next wave included sixteen stallions, and the next had thirty-two… The winds were endless as long as the dao lord was around.

“Rumble!” Chaos Continent shook violently from their battle; its inhabitants quivered in fear.

Conceal Conqueror had enough of this and suddenly disappeared. All the stallions converged on her initial position and exploded, leaving behind a fragmented void and spatial scars.

In spite of its destructive prowess and total suppression, it couldn’t do anything to Conceal Conqueror.

Keep in mind that dao lords and conquerors had the ability to lock onto their foes. Due to their divine intents, hiding became impossible yet Conceal managed to do so.

In the next moment, the dao lord felt a sharp pain on his neck. Conceal appeared next to him and nearly pierced his throat in an undetectable manner.

She was able to hide her presence from all opponents to deliver a fatal blow.

“Boom!” He gathered his dao again with a speed faster than her thrust.

The stallions returned and focused their energy in front of his neck, turning into an inch-thick barrier.

“Clank!” Fiery sparks splashed everywhere and destroyed the area nearby.

“Boom!” The shockwaves managed to make it out of the battlefield and turned weaker cultivators into blood.

Conceal Conqueror disappeared from sight again after the successful block.

“They’re strong.” An ancestor started sweating after seeing their power.

That indetectable thrust earlier could have killed any of them. Even Eight-stallion didn’t spot it until it was nearly too late.

Some big shots began to understand how she managed to kill Heavenpeak Conqueror back then.

“Impressive stealth dao.” Eight-stallion roared. He knew about her techniques more than anyone due to their rivalry.

“Tsunami of War!” He roared and transformed into an unstoppable current.
