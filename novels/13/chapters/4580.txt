Chapter 4581: Who Is The King?

“What reincarnation? I’ve never died so there is no such thing.” She protested this claim.

“If you don’t buy it, then what do you think is going on?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I said that I’m not a reincarnation!” She became serious and her aura erupted to the horror of the trio.

“Looks like you wish to challenge me.” Li QIye smiled. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Why not?!” She displayed overbearing confidence not seen in someone her age.

She channeled her energy and vitality, resulting in a hurricane of power capable of grinding everything into nothingness.

“Fuck!” Jian Ming bellowed while the other two were horrified. They got sent flying and smashed through several buildings.

“I challenge you!” Xiao Xuan transformed into a raging god standing above all. Her movement had the same force as a giant dragon swinging its tail.

She raised her finger and gathered all the momentum and affinities in the world at the tip. It became apparent that all techniques and treasures were as feeble as a piece of paper before her.

The trio saw the finger strike from a distance and felt a sharp pain on their forehead. They even heard an illusory sound of bone breaking - the strike piercing through their skull and brains.

This technique was decisive - one strike to kill devils and gods, finishing the match with a single thought.

Li Qiye’s disrespect wasn’t well-received. She was a god and her whims were absolute and inviolable. Therefore, she must destroy Li Qiye for his sacrilegious comment, not just because of a violent tendency.

As mentioned previously, she was a slumbering beast looming above all else in the primordial world - a supreme ruler. Alas, When she gauged at Li Qiye earlier, he seemed like a terror engulfing the entire world. His existence exceeded the bounds of heaven and earth and she couldn’t stand it. Her pride demanded a challenge against Li Qiye’s authority.

“Rumble!” As she gathered energy for the attack, the buildings nearby started crumbling.

Members of the four clans panicked and fled for their lives. They didn’t have the qualification to be close enough to watch this battle due to the pressure.

Li Qiye smiled at the challenger. In the next second, he instantly appeared in front of her and caught her entirely off guard. She had no idea what he did before her finger was caught by him.

He pushed it down and smiled: “Little girl, you need to watch your temper. You might be at the apex of life but know your place before me.”

Willing or not, she couldn’t stop him from preventing the attack. The terrifying aura also dispersed along with the pressure.

The trio heaved a sigh of relief. As for the rest of the clans, they slowly stood up, still confused after being dragged into this mess and suppressed.

They then came closer and saw that she was only a ten-year-old girl. Astonishment struck next.

“Arrange a nice place for her, we’ll stay here for now.” Li Qiye told Jian Ming and then left.

They started sweating with him gone. Though Li Qiye was the more powerful existence, they could at least reason with him. On the other hand, this girl appeared temperamental and violent.

“Ahem, Lady, please follow me. We have many excellent guest rooms, feel free to pick whichever you like. Also, if you need anything, we will do everything we can to accommodate you.” Jian Ming came over and said politely. No one else wanted to do this so it had to be him.

Fortunately, she complied with him and stay with the four clans for now.

She lay on a bed and looked out the window to watch the misty rain over the mountains. A hint of sadness could be seen on her face.

“What, not comfortable here?” Li Qiye suddenly appeared next to her.

She slightly moved and left room for him to sit down.

He sat down and stared smilingly at her: “Your dao heart has become firm enough after the eras, the sadness of the world shouldn’t appear on your face.”

Having said that, he rubbed the lines on her forehead.

“How long have you been alive?” She asked.

“Long enough to forget my age, just know that I’m older than you.” He smiled and stared out the window.

“Then you must know about my past.” She became interested.

He shook his head and said: “Just a little bit. Though you were famous back then, it wasn’t enough for me to keep you around. Therefore, I was only a passerby to you and you were only an insignificant person to me.”

“I see, how emotionless of you.” She stared at him and said.

“That’s just the grand dao.” Li Qiye said: “It won’t change because you have emotions or otherwise. As long as your dao heart is firm enough, all of these things won’t affect you.”

“I don’t know.” She responded: “I’m just a girl right now. I feel like I don’t know many things yet I have this incredible knowledge as if I have lived for eras.”
