Chapter 5480: The Flames Will Spread To You

“You do not wish to save?” The woman asked.

“I can save one but not all living beings. They have their own destiny.” He said.

“Looks like you’re just as heartless as us.” Her eyes narrowed.

“It’s fine to call me heartless, but I’m different from you all who were born without emotions.” He disagreed.

“True, we never had emotions.” She clapped in agreement.

“But, you’re infected by the mortal coil now.” He had a glimpse of amusement in his eyes while glancing at her.

“Don’t give me that look, so what if I’m infected? I can sever it easily.” She smiled.

“I don’t think severing this karma is that simple.” He responded.

“Do you know who you’re talking to? My body can sever the mortal coil, I’m not him.” She said with determination.

“Perhaps.” He didn’t wish to contest this issue.

“I must make my move.” She warned: “It’ll be a full sweep when I arrive, you best be prepared.”

“For what? You do your thing, I’ll do mine, that’s all.” He shook his head.

“That’s not your style, they are the closest to you.” She said.

“Yes.” He said sentimentally before sighing: “Closest to me indeed.”

“But you will just watch them die?” She sneered: “For the sake of watching the tigers fight and take advantage of the aftermath?”

“To be carefree without looking back is a great fortune. They know what they will face before embarking on this path. Death is an acceptable ending; they must face this tribulation with courage.”

“As you wish, I will not be holding back for any reason.” She shrugged.

“Are you sure you can carry it out?” He asked.

“Don’t think I can? I will fight you right now in your own epoch.” She aggressively declared.

“No, you have seen everything before and killed wondrous cultivators. It’s just that no one will sit idly awaiting death, even rabbits will start biting when pushed to the brink.” He shook his head.

“I want to see how they will bite.” She said.

“Biting is one thing, they’re most likely digging pits and waiting for you to jump in so they can bury you.” He smiled.

“The pits need to be rather large. This has been their plan for a long time now.” She chuckled.

“Patience has run out. Even your other body can wait no longer.” He said.

“Just part of the cycle, a full sweep will right everything.” She uttered coldly.

After a brief pause, he changed the topic: “Don’t you ever thought about being yourself?”

“Have you lost your mind? I am myself.” She glared at him.

“I have a me as well. He asked me if I was being too cruel to myself. I didn’t think so but that was his perspective, an unmatched hardship and cruelty.” He glanced at the sky and said.

She didn’t respond quickly this time. After a few seconds, she asked: “So you feel that you’re a bastard because of this?”

“A bit.” He shrugged: “But if I’m a bastard, who else isn’t? Putting that aside, do you think I’m suffering?”

“Your words are useless, I am immovable.” She gazed at the distance for a bit before lowering her head.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I’m not persuading you to do anything.” He shrugged: “Well, I’m sure the trip must have been hard so you shouldn’t return empty-handed, and what’s more significant than changes for us?”

Having said that, he pointed at his head and said: “For us, changes can happen with a single thought.”

“That’s your perspective.” She smiled: “This doesn’t happen with a single thought, it happened epochs ago for the other body.”

“Sure, but a single thought sparked the change.” He responded: “A seed was planted and it would blossom in the future. It has taken root in our epoch.”

“Heh.” She chuckled and said: “A single thought or not, it’s meaningless because you cannot wait to see that day. Your epoch and your world, even you will have been reduced to ashes.”

“Don’t be so sure. Perhaps all of you won’t be there in that distant future but I will be.” He said calmly.

“Replacing us?” She glared at him.

“You already know that I do not wish to walk on a path that has been paved, nothing changes in that case. I only want an answer.” He shrugged.

“It won’t be as you wish.” She shook her head, having absolute confidence in her assertion.

“Either way, it must be done, just like how you will descend regardless of your wish for this is your karma and duty.” He said.

“I can sever it if I wish to.” She responded.

“Exactly, and when that happens, your body shall be no more.” He laughed: “You do harbor this thought so I don’t need to say more.”

“Worry about yourself first, the flames will eventually reach you.” She said.

“They will reach you first. I’m not the one who can’t sit still right now, you know this.” He smiled.

“I can’t wait until I beat this smug grin off your face.” She snorted.

Today, no one in this world would dare to speak to Li Qiye like this. Alas, she seemed confident in carrying out this threat.

“How pitiful. The next time we meet, you can’t even keep your words since you won’t recognize and remember me, not even remembering your own threat.” He shook his head.

She froze for a moment because this was indeed the case.

“Who knows? I remember you now and still find you as annoying as ever.” She said.

“Since you’ve descended into my world, we have connected. Once you’re gone, so will the bridge.” He said.

She didn’t respond this time.

“Sometimes I wonder about this feeling. Is it my own desire or something else?” He asked.

“Did you ask your other self this?” She stared at him.

“No, and it’s too late now. Plus, it’s probably not that important.” He said.

She ruminated the last line before glaring at him: “You better give up on this idea. After I finish my sweep, we will have our life-and-death battle.”

“Very well, I’ll be waiting to see if you still remember these words when the time comes.” He smiled.

“I will remember.” She stood up and nodded at him. With that, she departed from the tree.
