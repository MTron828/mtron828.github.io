Chapter 5821: Regarding Death Coffin

Celestial Court had several lords in its long history. However, Human Ancestor was always leading in the background with a unique stance.

Spectators observed him with bated breath. Some had seen the three immortals before but this meeting was the first for them.

He was the disciple of Trinity Ancestor, making him special and respected by the strongest cultivators.

“And here I thought you wouldn’t show up.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sacred Teacher, you stand before our gate, leaving me no choice but to test my luck instead of being a turtle.” The founder answered.

“Good, I’m glad to hear this.” Li Qiye said.

“Of course, we can still talk if you are willing, Sacred Teacher.” The founder showed no sign of anger despite Li Qiye’s aggressive intention.

“Talk about what?” Li Qiye smirked.

“Feel free to state your demands, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said.

“The most basic of my goals is to cut the head of your five overlords. Do you think we can still negotiate?” Li Qiye waved his hand.

The three immortals scowled, clearly unhappy with his arrogance. Anyone else would have suffered the wrath of Celestial Court but with Li Qiye, not even the supreme overlords dared to show up.

“Sacred Teacher, you aim to antagonize, not negotiate.” The founder shook his head.

“There is nothing to discuss or negotiate, I shall destroy what should be, it is only a matter of time.” Li Qiye said: “As for you, you’ve been trying to walk the path of balance between them, have you achieved your goal? The current Celestial Court is completely unrecognizable from what it used to be.”

The founder paused for a moment before letting out a sigh: “My inability is shameful, and I’m not as decisive as you either, Sacred Teacher.”

“It’s fine, just call them out and leave the rest to me.” Li Qiye said.

“You think too highly of me, I do not know where the ancestors are.” The founder said.

“Perhaps you can trick a child with this. I believe them if they say they only know the coordinates of Primal and Derivation, not Dao Ancestor’s group. But I don’t think even the so-called three immortals believe you.” Li Qiye laughed.

“You are too assuming, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said.

“Is that so? Primal’s group was afraid of being spotted by the high heaven, so they didn’t dare to keep Death Coffin. Why did they give it to you instead of the three immortals?”

The three immortals’ expressions changed upon hearing this. The rest also recalled the previous war when Li Qiye took the coffin.

They didn’t know who its owner was but now, it seemed like it belonged to Primal and Derivation.

The three immortals stood with them in the blood branch while Sword, Profound, and Hao Hai were part of the dao branch. The founder had a unique position, seemingly neutral.

Did Primal and Derivation not trust the three immortals who were essentially their disciples?

“Starting this again, Dark Crow? Your instigation is useless.” Heaven Authority snorted.

In reality, they were frustrated by this decision as well. If they had the coffin, the founder wouldn’t be able to keep his prestigious role.

“He is right, Sacred Teacher. Death Coffin is under the watch of Celestial Court, all of us are the guards.” The founder said.

“Is that so? Were you a guard when Divine Ancestor was hunted or just an outsider? These three were certainly not part of this mess since they weren’t qualified.” Li Qiye changed the topic.

The founder had a sad expression as he said: “It was a tragedy.”

“Was it for you? That I do not know, I just wonder about your stance, perhaps you are closer to these martial uncles than your actual master.” Li Qiye said.

“Your accusation is unwarranted, Sacred Teacher.” The founder’s expression soured. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Don’t get worked up, I’m just speaking casually.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “I know that you were young when Trinity Ancestor left. Did Divine Ancestor take good care of you? From what I’ve found, you became closer to Lord of Derivation. The madman has no respect for anyone outside of Trinity Ancestor yet he has a relationship with you, going as far as passing down his art of derivation.”

“That’s all in the past, it is irrelevant.” The founder responded.

“Don’t be so sure, cause and effect are determined, the fact that you can control Celestial Court without siding with anyone speaks volumes.” Li Qiye said: “So now, do you wish to preserve Celestial Court or side with the old geezers? Your choice.”
