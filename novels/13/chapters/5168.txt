Chapter 5169: The Two Saints Together Make The Heavenly Dao A No Bother

His goal was to find a particular medicine in order to revive the corpse. This was the second step after obtaining the coffin of the Qian from Jun Landu.

Although the garden hasn’t been maintained by anyone, it still matured perfectly fine. The plants had their own autonomy and fortune to reach the dao. They kept the garden proper themselves.

It was protected by supreme formations and the veins of heaven and earth. Thus, even apex emperors didn’t dare to take the risk of coming here.

The king medicines kept an eye on this uninvited guest to see if he bore malice. After all, just obtaining a single king medicine meant a lifetime of benefits.

Of course, this wasn’t Li Qiye’s goal. He focused on his search while crossing the garden.

He reached a mound with an arched gate supported by two large pillars made from an unknown type of rock. They appeared capable of upholding the heaven itself.

There were two stone chairs on the platform. Sitting on them made one feel as if they were in charge of the cosmo while looking down on the rest of the world.

Li Qiye then stared at the rhyming couplet written on the two pillars - the two saints together make the heavenly dao a no bother.

He smiled after reading this popular couplet originating from Eight Desolaces. It described two saintesses - Saint Miao and Saint Wu. [1]Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They were no longer seen in Eight Desolaces, resulting in rumors regarding their death or seclusion.

Some peerless cultivators researched this matter and understood that the two saints were looking for something their entire life. Most believed that their pursuit was the immortal dao.

It seemed that the true answer was that they had left Eight Desolaces and ascended to the six continents.

Li Qiye didn’t need to think since the answer was obvious

“Waiting for the immortal.” He sighed and shook his head: “Time waits for no one, why did you two waste time here?”

He also understood why this place had the medicine he was searching for.

“Buzz.” The dao platform recognized his aura and activated on its own volition. Runic arcs and dao power appeared, gathering the essences of the world.

“Rumble!” A bright beam shot up into the air after a full activation.

This was seen by everyone in the region including Saintess Shao Yao. She was shocked because it was different from anything seen previously.

For some reason, Li Qiye’s face popped up in her mind. She thought that he might have something to do with it.

“Look at this phenomenon, is it an immortal medicine?” The crown prince of Iron Tree became excited. [2]

“Saintess, should we go take a look?” He asked.

If he could somehow climb the peak and obtain the medicine, it wouldn’t be difficult to marry her in the future.

“No need.” She shook her head in response: “An apex conqueror would have taken it long ago, we lack the fortune and ability to do so.”

In history, ancient ancestors from Alchemy Dao have attempted to climb the peak. Alas, none of them have been successful. Her master had failed as well.

Nonetheless, she believed that the founder was able to reach the top and that there was a connection between the two. Of course, this was only her personal speculation.

“Rumble!” The entire platform started rising and changing the flow of all affinities. Once it got high enough, it teleported to a different location.

Li Qiye saw steps made of stars before him. Each celestial step was immensely heavy and beautiful.

Whenever he stepped on one, they would light up and illuminate him with a gentle glow. This was nothing short of a sincere welcome. They appeared to be happy in his presence - no different from a girl in love who has been waiting for too long. Upon the sight of her lover, all of her emotions erupted with excitement. Being the receiver of this was akin to returning to home and paradise.

One couldn’t help thinking about staying in this vast expanse forever. This applied to Li Qiye as well, albeit in a bittersweet manner.

At the end of the passage was the same platform with the two stone chairs. To the middle of the platform was a single stem and two branches; each branch had two leaves and a flower.

The two flowers’ pistil exuded eternal rays of time. The leaves themselves were complex like worlds, seemingly enjoying the rays.

1. Saint Wu was the martial saint but I think Saint Wu might be the correct translation so I’ve changed it. It’s hard to say, both could be adjective or just their last name. ☜
