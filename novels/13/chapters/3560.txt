Chapter 3561: Just A Casual Meal

Dreamsoul sage was extremely precious. One might have the money yet still wouldn’t be able to buy them at the capital. However, Li Qiye planted so many for regular consumption.

The student from the alchemy clan licked his lips: “Last year when my clan master was refining a special pill, he was missing something like this dreamsoul sage. He ran around the auctions and stores to no avail. This guy is actually just eating them...”

Any student with a little knowledge and common sense understood the value of dreamsoul sage. If they were to have one root, they would be able to fetch it for a high price if not kept for their own.

Now, Li Qiye was treating it as a vegetable for eating. Moreover, he had an entire garden filled with them too.

The disparity drove the students crazy. He wasn’t far from being a mortal yet he had such good circumstances as if blessed by heaven. Worst of all, he didn’t appreciate this at all. The students found this unbearably frustrating.

Meanwhile, the old man brought up a covered bowl of fish soup. He opened it and rainbows emerged in a beautiful manner.

The bowl looked as if someone had broken down rainbows and used them as an ingredient. Though it lacked the same aroma as the roasted meat earlier, it had a faint fragrance of the fish.

It went beyond stimulating the appetite; people felt comfortable as if their pores were open. This pleasant sensation was hard to describe.

Just the smell alone gave this wondrous sensation. What about actually eating and drinking it?

“Seven-colored draconic loach together with dreamsoul sage.” The young alchemist murmured: “This is beyond nutrition, it can change someone’s fundamental cores, washing the meridians and enriching the essences. It’ll greatly boost cultivation speed for fifty years.”

The other students heard this and wanted a taste so badly. Even a fool understood the value of that soup bowl.

“Amitabha.” Golden Cicada has finished eating the two legs; only the bones were left. He showed no shame or bashfully and came closer to Li Qiye.

He reached out with his bowl and asked: “Benefactor, a karmic deed, perhaps? That fish soup is perfect for the stomach after the roasted meat.”

The students smiled wryly. They have offended Li Qiye but even in the case of otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to throw away their face for the sake of eating.

Alas, a gluttonous monk like Golden Cicada had no qualms in doing so. His eyes were fixated on the bowl of soup.

“Forget about it.” Li Qiye waved his hand as if he was swatting a fly.

“Just one small bowl to save a life, Benefactor, a greater deed than building a seven-story pagoda.” The monk didn’t relent.

“Gao! Raa!” Lil’ Black and Lil’ Yellow returned to show their fangs at this unwelcome guest.

The monk immediately leaped backward and placed his palms together: “Amitabha, Buddha values mercy, it’s fine to not give anything, no need to try and hurt me.”

Li Qiye ignored the monk while the two aggressive animals kept the monk away. The latter could only stare enviously at the bowl from a distance.

Li Qiye called for Bai Fan and poured some soup into another bowl for her: “You have trained hard, drink this.”

The girl knew nothing about the value of the bowl. Nonetheless, she would always listen to Li Qiye so she drank it down in one gulp.

Her vitality suddenly billowed with tigers and dragons roaring. An army seemed to be marching inside her, instilling endless power.

“Control your mind and channel the mantra.” She was afraid until she heard Li Qiye’s voice in her mind.

She immediately sat down in the meditative pose and channeled her mantra. This circulated the churning vitality into the rest of her body in a smooth manner...

“Buzz.” She became shrouded by a seven-colored radiance. Rainbows emanated from her as if she was the original source.

The students from Duality became envious. Drinking this soup was a great fortune akin to tiger growing wings.

“Amitabha.” The monk stared at Li Qiye’s bowl while saliva oozed out of his mouth. However, he didn’t dare to get close because the two animals were still watching him.

He drank a little bit and chose to eat the eyes. They looked like pearls and immediately illuminated the area. He didn’t think much of them and swallowed right away.

This naturally made the students jealous. They would have taken their time to enjoy the bowl, unlike this distasteful man.

“Okay, I’ve had enough, you two can drink now.” He stretched his body before giving the rest to Lil’ Black and Lil’ Yellow.

In fact, he had very little compared to Bai Fan. He virtually only ate the eyes of the large fish.

The two excitedly growled before rushing forward.

“Such a waste...” The students couldn’t believe it and gritted their teeth.

They felt inferior to a wild boar and dog. They lived so long yet didn’t get the chance to taste seven-colored draconic loach. On the other hand, this guy wasted it in such a ridiculous manner.

Some had the urge to come over and rob those two animals. However, they still cared too much about their status.

Only the monk didn’t give a damn. He has been coveting the bowl the entire time. He used the sleeve of his kasaya to wipe away some saliva on his mouth before walking over.

“Amitabha, Benefactor... no, Big Brother Black, Big Brother Yellow, do a good deed and quench my thirst by giving me some soup?” He said without any shame.

Lil’ Yellow gave him no respect and barked at him. Lil’ Black played nicer and shook its head. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“...” The students were speechless. The great genius of Heavenly Dragon Temple went as far as calling two animals “big brother”.

“I wonder what the sacred monk would do to him after hearing about this.” One student wondered.

The monk of wisdom was one of the four grandmasters of Buddha Holy Ground. Now, his disciple threw away his dignity for a bowl of soup along with the reputation of his master and his sect.

“No, the Buddhist child’s gluttony is famous. The temple and the sacred monk have turned a blind eye to this.” A different student responded.

His sect couldn’t do anything about it so they let him do as he pleases.

“This is so sad, just give him a little bit.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Amitabha, Benefactor, you have the heart of a bodhisattva.” Golden Cicada celebrated after hearing this.
