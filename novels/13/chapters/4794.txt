Chapter 4795: Gu Yin

Considering Blessed Dao Lord’s prominence in history, his martial brothers and sisters should have been documented somehow.

Alas, not to mention outsiders, even True Immortal had virtually nothing written down about her.

If it wasn’t for Specter Monarch’s confirmation, Cosmic Lord wouldn’t have accepted this as fact.

No one recognized the girl or knew her name and power. However, Li Qiye had seen her before back in Yin Yang Crossing. She was none other than Lin Mo.

Meanwhile, an ancient ancestor that had survived since Blessed Dao Lord’s era finally remembered something. He murmured: “Back in Ascension Crossing, Blessed Dao Lord was there, Everlasting Monarch and her too.”

That event had countless geniuses and most importantly, Blessed Dao Lord and Everlasting Monarch. They were too bright and overshadowed everyone else. She looked more like a servant than anything while standing next to those two.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“So she was special too.” He took a deep breath.

Blessed Dao Lord and Everlasting Monarch wowed the crowd with their greatness. However, he recalled that she didn’t have any reaction. Perhaps she was just as strong as them back then.

“Let’s go.” Lin Mo didn’t explain anything and told the juniors.

However, Cosmic Lord didn’t move an inch.

“What is it?” Six-dao Monarch noticed this and asked.

Cosmic Lord took a deep breath and bowed deeply at the three: “Ancestors, I wish to stay.”

This development naturally surprised the crowd.

“What are you doing?” Six-dao frowned after hearing this.

Cosmic Lord had revitalized True Immortal and established it as the number one sect again in recent eras. His might was one thing but he had the backing of Six-dao Monarch and the other ancient ancestors. He could act without worrying so in a sense, Six-dao was also his master.

“I wish to stay.” Cosmic Lord didn’t explain himself.

Both Six-dao and Specter were displeased with his attitude. Putting their seniority aside, the ancestral aunt was also present. Her status might only be second to their progenitor, Blessed Dao Lord.

In a prestigious sect such as True Immortal, seniority was taken seriously. The words of the ancestors were to be obeyed, not questioned. Infractions weren’t taken lightly.

Depending on the circumstances, this could be considered sacrilegious and traitorous. No one wanted any part of this because the punishment could be banishment or death. In the former case, no other sect would want to accept the offender afterward.

Cosmic Lord would be throwing his lifelong prestige away by committing this offense. His whole life would have been wasted.

“Control your greed!” Specter Monarch reprimanded.

“I have to do what should be done in order to not be average for the rest of my life, please forgive me, ancestors.” Cosmic Lord responded.

“This is outrageous!” Six-dao yelled as well: “Return to the sect with us, do not make this mistake.”

Regardless of his contributions and position in True Immortal, the senior ancient ancestors would not show him mercy for violating the rules.

“Monarch, why are you coercing your fellow sect member?” A distant voice interjected. It seemed to be coming from the depth of hell and creeped everyone out.

Everyone looked over and saw a black coffin carried by four existences with their appearance hidden. The voice came from there.

“...” They felt something ominous with the coffin’s appearance.

“It’s from Desolate Wild.” Many big shots had a good guess of its origin.

“Gu Yin!” Six-dao Monarch glared at the coffin and said: “Gu Yin, your Immortal Lake needs not worry about our matters.”

“Immortal Lake!” This shocked listeners who knew about this area.

Desolate Wild was a mysterious area. Only top masters such as dao lords could handle the risk.

Rumor has it that it contained numerous ancient behemoths. For one reason or another, these sects had no choice but to stay there.

Nonetheless, they still had influence in Eight Desolaces due to their terrifying strength.

In fact, some believed that True Immortal might be the number one sect right now but this title couldn’t be kept if any ancient behemoth from Desolate Wild were to come out.
