Chapter 4638: Speargrasp

As he floated in the air, he became an unsurpassable mountain dividing the world into two halves.

His actual stature was just average but he gave off the presence of a giant. When he spread his hands, he could blot out the sun.

Most youths didn’t know who he was but they could tell that he was incredibly strong.

“Speargrasp!” An older expert shouted his title.

“He’s Speargrasp?” Most had heard of him before.

“Yes, the current leader of Three Thousand Dao, he’s not their successor though.” A knowledgeable big shot said.

“The first brother of Three Thousand Dao…”

Most would think about Dao Sanqian and the Six Heavenly Monarchs when talking about Three Thousand Dao. The next would be Shen Juntian who was rumored to be Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s son.

Speargrasp was another notable figure from Three Thousand Dao. He was the senior brother of their young generation and the oldest disciple of Enveloping Monarch.

Three Thousand Dao was a sect with many tributaries. The highest being was obviously Dao Sanqian.

However, Dao Sanqian didn’t care for mundane, administrative matters. Therefore, the normal leader was addressed as Dao Master or sect master.

Though Speargrasp wasn’t the current sect master, he became the de-facto leader after he made a name for himself. He took care of matters ranging from insignificant to important.

He didn’t only become famous due to being the first disciple of Enveloping Monarch. During the start of his domination, the five conquerors have yet to be born.

He became undefeated in Thre Thousand Dao and some thought that he would become the next dao lord. However, he chose the Heavenly Sovereign path instead. No one understood the reason for this.

Rumor has it that he was born too early. When his dao became proven, the prestige of Eight-stallion Dao Lord still remained. This made it difficult for him to become a dao lord.

Another stated that he wanted to go easy on Shen Juntian and become a dao protector instead. From this came another rumor - that Dao Sanquan had prepared for the son of Eight-stallion to become a dao lord as well. Because of this, Speargrasp had to relent regardless of his own talents.

Either way, Speargrasp didn’t show any grievance on this. He served as a pillar of Three Thousand Dao and contributed greatly. The sect prospered in peace and he was respected by all the ancestors. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Both the young and old members of Three Thousand Dao obeyed his commands. This included the prideful Godwhip Princess since her sect was a tributary.

“First Brother.” She bowed after seeing him.

“Brother Speargrasp.” The young emperor greeted him respectfully as well.

The duo became the center of attention. The two of them were supreme geniuses but had an entirely different aura.

True Immortal Young Emperor had a natural air of nobility. He was destined to become a lord. This wasn’t the case for Speargrasp. The latter resembled a commander wielding a weapon and a horsewhip, ready to ride on the battlefield and slaughter his enemies.

“It is not proper for you to be on stage, Godwhip. Leave it to Paramount.” Speargrasp told the princess.

“I understand.” Though she was unwilling, she still obeyed his command since he had unquestionable authority in Three Thousand Dao.

“Paramount.” He shouted.

Paramount Scion, who was hiding among the crowd, wanted to flee after seeing this development. Alas, it was too late.

“First Brother.” He answered the call.

“Since you’re here, get on stage and show everyone the fruit of your labor during the last ten years. Spar with True Immortal Spirit.” He ordered.

Paramount Scion was just as famous as Godwhip Princess and True Immortal Spirit. However, he kept a low profile compared to his peers.

The crowd became excited right away since this would be a great match.

“I am too weak to be True Immortal Spirit’s opponent.” Paramount Scion wasn’t in the mood to fight since he knew the actual outcome already.

Speargrasp said: “This is the time to test your effort. The grand dao requires polishing and testing instead of just walking blindly ahead. True Immortal Spirit is a genius and has a similar cultivation level to yours, this is perfect.”

Others nodded in agreement, thinking that this senior brother from Three Thousand Dao was a good leader. This battle stage wasn’t only for a potential marriage with the golden daughter of Golden Gate. This was a rare opportunity to test themselves as well.

It was difficult for geniuses to find capable rivals. There was one right now waiting for Paramount Scion. Only through fighting and going all out would they know where they currently stand.

“Paramount Scion, your reputation precedes you.” True Immortal Spirit was more eager to fight Paramount Scion instead of Godwhip Princess.
