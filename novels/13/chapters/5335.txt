Chapter 5336: High-level Taste

“Brother Greenvine, help Sir find Timewatcher.” Godmist said: “I will let the old geezers’ descendants know about their fate.”

He disappeared from sight after saying this.

“The idiot is still obsessed with Heaven’s Allure.” Greenvine told Li Qiye: “He won’t want to meet anyone, I will just take you to his home and you can take it from there, Sir.”

“Perfect.” Li Qiye smiled.

Coincidentally enough, Timewatcher also had his own grotto in Duality World.

Greenvine led the group to a place with a broken tree on the ground, looking rather inconspicuous.

“Open!” He shouted and a green wheel of the temporal affinity appeared.

“Buzz.” He continued to rotate it until its gears latched at the right place.

“Creak…” It then opened and formed a door.

“This is Timewatcher’s grotto, I will be taking my leave now.” Greenvine had no intention of entering and bowed deeply toward Li Qiye before disappearing from sight.

Li Qiye smiled and entered; the group followed right behind him.

They found themselves standing in the blue sky engraved with white clouds. Inside one of them was a magnificent and dazzling palace.

They came closer and saw a familiar statue - Heaven’s Allure.

“This looks to be the right place.” Zhitian commented.

The hall and rooms were filled with resplendent gold and jade. Treasures piled up casually, exuding an incomparable grandeur.

In one of the rooms was a tassel-adorned bed with a naked man. He was as handsome as can be and exuded charisma - especially his arrogant and confident smirk.

Countless women would fall for him at first sight, loving him with utmost devotion. He had a robust physique with bulging muscles. There seemed to be a dragon within, always ready to rush out.

Each inch of his skin had a radiant glow and brimmed with divinity. He was certainly a god among men.

The half-naked woman laying beside him was just as exceptional. Words wouldn’t do her beauty justice.

He held her by the waist and was clearly infatuated by her appearance.

“Just like this!” He shouted.

She touched his muscular chest and could see that he was lost in the moment. Her immaculate hands suddenly turned into numerous thorns, wanting to pierce him.

Temporal lightning waves coursed around him automatically and retaliated.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Crackle!” They invaded the woman and caused her to bellow in pain.

The overwhelming lightning surge changed her into something else - a mass of black liquid with sharp teeth and a pair of eyes with numerous pupils.

This dreadful form stood in stark contrast to the previous beauty. Seeing it might cause one to scream.

“You have to break my dao first before devouring me.” The man smiled charmingly and recalled his lightning current.

The creature immediately turned back into the beauty and spoke seductively: “You’re too much for me, Master.” [1]

“Good!” The man shouted and became more energetic, causing her to scream in pleasure.

The two of them fell into a passionate affair. She took advantage of this and tried to pierce him with countless thorns again.

Alas, it seemed impossible for her to break through his automatic barrier infused with time and lightning.

“I told you, you have to break my dao first.” He didn’t seem to mind.

“Wow, this is some high-level taste, to actually incorporate lightning so masterfully. I have nothing but admiration for you too.” Someone suddenly interrupted their session.

They looked over and saw that it was none other than Li Qiye and his group.

Li Qiye had a smirk on his face while the old servant had a cold expression, seemingly expecting this scene.

Li Zhitian, on the other hand, became startled after seeing the black liquid’s transformation. Moreover, a majestic conqueror was actually doing something so unsavory with the creature. No one would believe this story since they held conquerors in such high esteem.

“Who are you?” The man sighed and said.

On the other hand, the creature had a fierce reaction and gazed intensely at Li Qiye.

“You’re the primal darkness.” Li Qiye said.

“Raa!” It roared and lunged for him.

“Stop!” Timewatcher shouted but it was too late.

The thing turned back to its liquid form and wrapped around Li Qiye, wanting to devour him.

“Boom!” Li Qiye became resplendent and erupted with power.

The liquid exploded and splashed everywhere - the wall and the ground.

Each of them squirmed and wiggled in the form of tentacles before gathering into one being again.

“Run!” Timewatcher shouted.

Alas, the primal darkness didn’t listen and furiously initiated another attack against Li Qiye.
