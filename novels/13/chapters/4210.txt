Chapter 4211: A Broken Sword Is Enough

Everyone stared at each other after listening to Li Qiye.

“A broken sword is enough?” Even those with great confidence in him wavered.

No one was a stranger to his devilish abilities and heaven-defying methods. Alas, this was a ridiculous claim.

His foes possessed wondrous power and treasures. Yes, Li Qiye also had many dao lord weapons.

If he were to use them all, then his supporters would find victory possible. As for a broken sword? No chance.

“Are you sure?” Peace Ocean glared at Li Qiye in a menacing manner.

“No need to think twice to beat you lot.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

The crowd smiled wryly, believing that he was the only one who can display such haughtiness before Peace Ocean and Void.

“So arrogant, he should be preparing for a tough fight instead of this. He might die without a corpse leftover.” One youth said.

“I can’t wait for a chance to witness a miracle today.” Void said sarcastically.

This was a first-time experience for Void and Peace Ocean. Previously, even the sect masters and kings didn’t dare to be disrespectful towards them. Thus, Li Qiye’s contempt left them furious, not to mention their existing feud with him.

“I and Dao Brother Void will have a taste of your heaven-defying method.” Peace Ocean uttered slowly yet sharply. Each word contained a metallic ring, akin to a sword piercing the heart. This made it awfully uncomfortable for listeners.

They felt his terrible power, and that he could kill them at a whim.

“Such an overestimation of your ability.” Li Qiye’s lips curled into an infuriating smirk. He waved at a random crowd member and said: “Come, let me borrow your sword.”

“M-my sword?” The cultivator was surprised, hesitated, then still decided to lend Li Qiye his sword.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Normally, he would never let anyone else do this since it would antagonize Void and Peace Ocean.

Li Qiye was a different story due to his previous exploits. He wondered if Li Qiye could defeat the duo using his sword. Though the probability was virtually zero, he would go down in history thanks to his sword.

He was only an ordinary cultivator, not a big shot at all. His sword was indeed “broken” compared to anything capable.

“He’s actually doing it.” Others couldn’t believe it. They thought that Li Qiye was only messing around in the beginning since he had one of the greatest treasuries in the world.

When he talked about not using moneyfall, they assumed that he would use his weapons to win.

“He has to be messing around, right?” A fan of Li Qiye said. How could this sword block a move from a dao lord weapon?

“It’s suicidal but if he can win, I’ll believe in him from now on. It will be nothing short of a miracle.” Another lad added.

“I would say it’s rather likely because Li Qiye is involved.” A big shot joined in.

“No way, a crappy sword against those two? It’s suicidal.” Another member was unhappy with the blockade but still had to pick Peace Ocean’s side. It was simply the logical choice.

“You won’t change your mind?” Peace Ocean glared at Li Qiye, sharing the same sentiment as the crowd.

In fact, they viewed Li Qiye as a greater genius than either of them. However, they felt that it was impossible for them to lose to him given his choice of weapon.

“There’s nothing to think about. Do you need to warm up first before fighting? So much time wasted already just talking.” Li Qiye casually waved his new sword around.

“Fine, I want to see what you can do!” Void lost patience and shouted: “Excuse me then, take this!”

He raised his hand and manipulated space. “Buzz.”

After loud explosions, a spatial wheel with sharp teeth all around it manifested into reality. This was far from an easy task yet he only needed a split second to do so. It was as if space was within his grasp.

“Such impeccable spatial manipulation!” Older experts took a deep breath.

The area around Li Qiye was being crushed by the wheel. He became fully exposed to any attack.

“So this is an art from a heavenly scripture.” Another spectator commented.

Nine-wheel Citadel possessed three sections from the scripture known as Six Wheels of the Myriad Realms. The saint child was using the Void Wheel.

“Rumble!” The wheel began flying towards Li Qiye and crushed everything in its path.
