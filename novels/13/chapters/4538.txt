Chapter 4539: Yin Yang Crossing

When the group made it to the edge, they saw many cultivators there including big shots from the great powers - ancestors and monarchs. Some young geniuses were present as well.

They stood on top of a peak and had a good view of Yin Yang Crossing - Yang Cemetery to the left and Yin Wheel to the right.

In the middle was a plain brimming with life and water, definitely suitable for long-term inhabitance.

Everyone knew that during the opening, a bridge would connect the cemetery with the wheel.

The group looked over the grave and saw how magnificent it was. Some peaks pierced through the clouds and were covered in snow. Rampaging rivers could be seen roaring like dragons along with bottomless valleys…

One thing was for certain - all of them contained the graves of top masters. These graves also varied in appearance.

A few had a tablet as large as a hill with clear engravings detailing the exploits of the owners. Some were nothing more than a puddle of dirt sticking out of the ground. A few had even less than that - just a flat surface, nothing else. One wouldn’t be able to find them without digging randomly. Therefore, there were more graves than visible.

A faint aura could be felt everywhere. Despite its virtually indiscernible nature, anyone would know that this was an ominous sign.

As one looked farther into the region, there was no end in sight. No one knew the exact vastness of the cemetery and the number of graves erected there.

Of course, none attempted to measure this place due to its perilous nature. Perhaps there were some bold enough. Alas, they most likely didn't make it out alive.

“If we actually have to find Pioneer Ancestor’s grave, it’ll be like trying to find a needle in a haystack, there are countless graves here.” Jian Ming became pessimistic.

“Right, there might not be a memorial tablet at all.” The daoist shook his head.

“We didn’t ask the fatty about any markings or runes on his ancestor’s grave.” Jian Ming said.

“Yu Zun might not know since he said that they only took him to the entrance, not the cemetery itself. The ancestor was the one who came in and buried himself. They don’t know the exact location and even if they did, their clan wouldn’t keep records of it.” Wise said.

“So our trip will be a waste of time if he doesn’t come out for the crossing.” Jian Ming said.

Suddenly, he thought about something and told the daoist: “Haha, I’m wrong. We have a peerless diviner right here. You should perform a reading on Pioneer Ancestor, maybe you can figure out the location of the grave.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“No way in hell.” The daoist refused: “Calculating the dead is awfully unlucky, terrible karma.”

“What do we do then? We can’t dig up the grave one by one.” Jian Ming said.

“Obviously unless you want everyone to die.” The daoist replied.

Li Qiye only smiled at the conversation and focused on the Yin Wheel instead of the cemetery. It stretched deep into an area known as Highest Wild. It seemed to be the void yet not due to the existence of floating unknowns. Light didn’t seem capable of reaching it - a stark contrast to the cemetery bathed in the sun.

This was especially true due to the snowy peaks reflecting bright rays. Alas, they couldn’t pierce through what seemed to be an invisible curtain separating Yin Wheel from the cemetery. Strange gray suds floated in this void, seemingly the aftermath of spatial fabrics being crushed.

“That’s the Yin Wheel? Doesn’t look too strange, just another space. How does it become the place for reincarnation?” Jian Ming looked over and said.

“This is its normal appearance, the real thing only appears during the opening.” Wise Ancestor explained: “A large maelstrom would appear then, it looks like death or the eye of the yellow river and will open the reincarnation path.”

“So there’s a chance of entering the vortex and reaching the reincarnation cycle?” Jian Ming smiled, seemingly excited.

“No, when that maelstrom appears, it will be extremely dangerous and capable of tearing anyone to pieces. Only the dead from the Yang Cemetery can get close. In fact, there are speculations that by burying themselves long enough, they would be able to enter the Yin Wheel.” The daoist glanced with disdain, seemingly laughing at Jian Ming’s lack of knowledge.

“Hmph, it’s just that I didn’t give a damn about this god-forsaken place.” Jian Ming retorted: “I don’t buy it either, there’s no way that vortex is so devilish.”

“The living entering the Yin Wheel will die, this has been established for eras now. Of course, there is one exception.” The daoist elaborated.

“Really, who is it?” Jian Ming asked. He actually believed the daoist’s claim about the Yin Wheel but only wanted to argue for the sake of it.

“Calamity Dao Lord.” Wise Ancestor answered instead.

“Calamity Dao Lord? That one snail?” Jian Ming was surprised.

“Pop!” Wise Ancestor smacked his head and said: “Your mouth will be the end of you one day. Think before you speak next time.”

“Hehe, this lowly one was wrong, please forgive me, Great One.” Jian Ming smiled wryly and cupped his fist towards the sky.

The daoist enjoyed watching him being slapped and said: “Calamity Dao Lord’s background is unreal. Heh, a calamity might actually descend and it’ll be too late to apologize then.”

“I’ve already apologized, he won’t care about the nonsense of a junior.” Jian Ming was a little bit afraid and said: “Please don’t send anything down, my feeble self can’t handle it.”

He had heard about the legends of Calamity Dao Lord. Rumor has it that this dao lord had something known as Heaven’s Will Elucidation.

During the dao lord’s era, he could summon calamities from above and destroy his foes without lifting a finger. This extended to clans and kingdoms as well, hence his title as Calamity Dao Lord.
