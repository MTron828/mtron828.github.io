Chapter 4571: Invincible Slash

The crowd was left speechless after seeing True Immortal’s defeat.

Six-dao Immortal Monarch was praised for being talented enough to become the first disciple of All-things Dao Lord, someone rumored to only be second to Blessed Dao Lord.

All-things could be considered one of the top ten dao lords or at least had a battle record matching any of them.

Therefore Skybreak Monarch was considerably inferior when compared to Six-dao. He was a being among the apex of this generation. Just one breath of his could freeze the entire region; a hand wave could take down a kingdom.

People trembled after hearing his name. Alas, he could only stop the first slash. Remember, that slash was already weakened too. The second slash completely overwhelmed him.

If Everlasting Monarch had left the bridge to pursue, both monarchs from True Immortal would have fallen to his blade. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This is the power of a dao lord.” The crowd gained an insight into true invincibility, not just how the word was used colloquially.

For example, if an existence were to survive after one or two moves against a dao lord, they would be praised as being “invincible”. This was naturally incorrect; the dao lord merely showed mercy.

Both Six-dao Immortal Monarch and Skybreak Monarch have been praised as being invincible before. This was clearly an incorrect way to use the word yet it has been repeated time and time again in history.

The survivors were praised too highly, making regular cultivators think that a dao lord’s power was actually reachable. In reality, they were merely trying to console themselves.

Today, Everlasting Monarch made the spectators realize the actual gap between “invincible” cultivators and the actual pinnacle.

“Six-dao Immortal Monarch is just as strong as Dao Sanqian, right?” An expert quietly asked after regaining his wits.

When talking about the current strongest cultivator, everyone would think about Dao Sanqian, a man with three thousand dao.

He was nothing short of an immortal in regular cultivators' eyes. His words were the heavenly decrees. Thus, how did Six-dao Monarch compare to him? If they were closely matched, then Dao Sanqian wouldn’t be able to beat Everlasting Monarch either.

“Did Everlasting Monarch fight during the worst days of True Immortal?” An old ancestor asked.

The big shots exchanged glances after hearing this. After the generation of All-things Dao Lord, an arrogant woman appeared with the intention of beating down the Li. She was unbeatable and ended True Immortal’s supremacy.

Next came Emperor Ye who dominated True Immortal as well, beating them in countless battles. In the end, they were sealed and another lengthy period of declination ensued.

An ancestor versed in history shook his head and elaborated: “There are no records of Everlasting Monarch fighting either lady. Maybe the world wasn’t qualified to witness a battle of that level. There could be other reasons why they didn’t fight too, I do not know.”

Whether he fought them or not, he was clearly a true contender, not just a “survivor” against a dao lord.

“If Everlasting Monarch is already this strong, can you imagine Blessed Dao Lord?” A different ancestor had a rich imagination.

The monarch could be used as a reference point for gauging Blessed Dao Lord’s power. Unfortunately, they couldn’t fathom a greater height.

“Wait, look over there!” As people were busy talking about the possibilities, someone noticed a person standing in front of Everlasting Monarch.

“Who is that?!” This shocked the listeners.

They looked up and saw a man standing there with a leisure expression. It was as if he was standing in the shade and enjoying the breeze - just another passerby with no worries on his mind.

“It’s Li Qiye!” A big shot recognized him and shouted.

“Is he crazy, does he want that scented pouch too?” No one expected this development.

Everlasting Monarch has shown his mastery of the sword earlier. It became apparent that no one would be able to survive. This included ancient ancestors and famous monarchs.

The decapitated corpses from True Immortal were still there to remind them of this.

“He has a death wish.” A spectator shouted.

Alas, as they were still thinking about his death, he already got the scented pouch in his hand.

Those who paid enough attention felt as if a gap in time was formed for a split second. Something happened fast enough for them to forget about the past despite technically seeing it.

“What…” They became slack-jawed and couldn’t believe their own eyes.

True Immortal mobilized a mighty force for the pouch only to fail. Two ancient ancestors ran for their lives.

On the other hand, Li Qiye already found success and Everlasting Monarch didn’t slash him.
