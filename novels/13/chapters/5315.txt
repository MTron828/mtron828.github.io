Chapter 5316: Best Not To Look

“You’ve been to Celestial Court, Senior?” Li Zhitian became startled.

The old servant didn’t respond.

“Heaven’s Allure.” Li Qiye touched his chin while looking at the statue.

“Rumor has it that no man can resist falling in love with her. They will throw away their lives willingly if she wishes so.” Zhitian said.

According to the legends, she could make men drop to their knees including emperors and dao lords.

“Why would anyone build a statue of her here?” Zhitian asked curiously.

The beautiful cultivator had joined Celestial Court and few could see her now. However, someone made a statue of her in this forsaken land.

“Must be someone who’s infatuated with her.” The old servant said.

“But why here out of all places?” Zhitian didn’t understand. Building a statue or having something to remember her by wasn’t strange; the issue here was the location.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Activate!” Li Qiye raised his hand and channeled the dao in order to understand the statue.

Something incredible happened next - dao sounds in the form of a lover’s whispers could be heard. The moans could pull the soul out of the body and rob others of their sanity. Meanwhile, black ink started oozing out of the statue.

“What is going on?” Zhitian was at a loss.

Li Qiye took a closer look at the thick liquid. It seemed to be alive and moving like an evil entity.

“Was here before.” He murmured.

“Do you know who built it?” Zhitian asked.

“At least a conqueror or dao lord in order to build something like this.” Li Qiye said.

“Its location still doesn’t make any sense.” Zhitian said since her fans should be building her statue somewhere accessible for remembrance's sake.

“It’s a bait.” Li Qiye said.

“Who or what is it trying to bait?” Zhitian asked.

“Why? That’s the most important question.” Li Qiye responded.

“Must be a pervert. Some type of fetish.” The old servant concluded.

“It’s probable.” Li Qiye said after fully analyzing the statue. There was nothing more he could get out of it.

“Could it be the Lord of Derivation?” Zhitian couldn’t help but ask.

“This is too insignificant, not worth the time nor effort.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Senior, you never got to see Heaven’s Allure?” Zhitian asked.

“No, and it’s better to not see her.” The old servant shook his head, clearly warning Li Zhitian to not have any idea.

Seeing the beauty was far from a good thing. Any moment of carelessness would result in becoming her slave.

“We’re leaving.” Li Qiye left the underground labyrinth with the rest of the group.

“There should be more.” Li Qiye surveyed the region again before resuming his search.

They traveled far and came to a desolate plain with a large group of tigers and leopards roaming energetically.

Upon closer inspection, Zhitian found that they followed fixed paths as if they were being herded like grazing sheep. After following them for a while longer, they entered a deep valley with an underground passage to a river of magma.

The creatures roamed the magma river like a bridge that had been specifically constructed for them.

This finally took the group to the lair of the creatures. The lair appeared to be artificially built and have been blessed for toughness.

The heat inside seemed special. The creatures gathered and started trembling at a determined interval. They became transparent and lay down on the ground in a circle - seemingly a way to stabilize their body.

“What are they doing?” Zhitian could tell that they required this ceremonial process in order to stay alive.

“Essentially, they were made from infusing snow essences into earth tigers.” Li Qiye said: “Failed experiments but someone created this lair in order to stabilize their unique characteristics.”

“An act of kindness to prevent extinction?” Zhitian said.

“Hard to say.” Li Qiye smiled.

The group delved deeper into the ground and saw an ocean of magma. At the center was a rocky reef reaching the surface, having endured countless years of erosion by the magma. Nonetheless, it remained standing with a statue on top.

“Heaven’s Allure again.” Li Zhitian and the old servant were surprised to see a second statue. They wouldn’t have found this elusive place without Li Qiye’s guidance.
