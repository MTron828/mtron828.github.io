Chapter 3545: Another Strange Person

The abandoned land separated West King. In reality, the south was far larger than the north, far stronger as well.

For millions of years, the south gave birth to plenty of talents. Its power and resources exceeded its northern counterpart.

One must bring up Buddha Holy Ground first when talking about the south. It was the strongest lineage there with the vastest territory. Some research said that they owned one-third of the south, perhaps even more.

During its golden age, it most likely possessed two-third of the south. From this, one could easily gauge its might.

According to some count, it had four dao lords, three thousand kingdoms, and eight thousand sects.

There was a popular phrase in the south regarding the sect’s size - just one wrong step and one can find themselves in Buddha Holy Ground.

Li Qiye strolled forward without ever looking back. The dry and hot climate had no effect on him. He eventually made it out of the abandoned land and found a scene of green.

Rolling hills and a billowing presence of life. People couldn’t help but take a deep breath after being in the desert for so long. The air filled with moisture made them greedily breathe in several more times. It became a contrast between a verdant land and a hellish inferno.

The mountains and forests ahead belonged to Buddha Holy Ground. From now on, the land was under their jurisdiction stretching from north to south.

Li Qiye looked ahead and decided his path. He didn’t care about the three thousand kingdoms and eight thousand sects of this behemoth. It was nothing more than a path to him.

After making it out of the lush forest, he found a straight road leading to a city.

A carriage was waiting, made from regular timber instead of any extravagant material. It looked sturdy and practical.

It was pulled by just one horse. It was relaxed, eating grass to the side of the street right now, seemingly waiting for something.

An old man sat on the front. His clothes weren’t expensive but carefully chosen and meticulously threaded - clearly done by a master.

He closed his eyes to rest while still holding the reins. He also seemed to be waiting for someone.

The place was rather quiet outside of chewing noises from the horse. Occasionally, one could hear the roars of beasts and birds chirping from the distance. This painted a tranquil scene.

However, it was strange to see a carriage waiting in this remote region. There was no other road through the forest.

After Li Qiye got close, the old man immediately opened his eyes and stared at Li Qiye.

His appearance was actually quite impressive, clearly not one used to manual labor. Just his natural expression alone exuded a dignified authority. He seemed to have enjoyed a high status for a long period. This eventually accumulated in a special aura.

Nonetheless, for some reason, the outfit and position of a carriage driver also fitted him perfectly. It was as if he was born for this position.

He didn’t pay much attention to Li Qiye but upon noticing the bronze ring, his brows furrowed.

“Customer, do you need a carriage?” He straightened his back and asked Li Qiye. His voice was slightly excited.

“Sure.” Li Qiye answered with a half-smile.

The old man immediately prepared by pulling back the horse. His actions were skilled, clearly experienced as if he had done so a million times. This was surprising due to his dignified appearance.

“Where are you going, Customer?” The old man put on the reins and asked Li Qiye.

“No rush, take your time.” Li Qiye posed with his hands behind his back, gazing towards the south in a calm manner.

The old man slowed down with preparing the horse. Time suddenly came to a still.

Li Qiye didn’t move an inch while the old man worked without making a single sound, seemingly afraid of disturbing Li Qiye.

This strange moment lasted for a while before the old man patted the horse. He smiled and told Li Qiye: “Customer, the horses are ready, we may go whenever.”

Li Qiye turned around and climbed up the carriage, not feeling awkward in the lightest. He sat down without looking at the old man once.

Meanwhile, the old man also sat in the driver’s position. He tidied his hat and held a horsewhip, looking just like a veteran.

“Where to, Customer?” The old man spoke.

“Go south, to the end of the path.” Li Qiye said.

This destination was vague, causing people to feel like a monk trying to find his hair.

The old man didn’t ask twice and agreed: “So be it, southward. Please sit tight, Customer.”

“Boom!” He smacked the whip on the horse without wasting any movement. It neighed and started pulling the carriage.

The carriage traveled at a fair speed without any jolting or bumping. This was comfortable akin to riding on a cloud.

Li Qiye slept inside the carriage without worrying in the slightest. On the other hand, the old man couldn’t help stealing glances at Li Qiye.

The guy was really sleeping without being on guard as if there was no point in doing so. This surprised the old man.

There were two possibilities - either a brat that was leaving home the first time or a true master not needing to exercise prudence.

He didn’t say anything and glanced at the bronze ring on Li Qiye’s finger. His eyes moved slightly afterward.

Anyone else would not care about this ring due to its conspicuous nature. However, he really wanted to take it off for a careful look. He simply refrained due to certain qualms.

Reason eventually won and stopped him from doing so. Though he was curious, he didn’t ask Li Qiye anything.

He looked forward and focused his mind on controlling the carriage. This was his responsibility and duty.

After a long time, Li Qiye woke up and asked: “Are we there?”

“Customer, not yet but almost.” The old man smiled.

Li Qiye rubbed his eyes and said: “Someone told me before we started that the road is full of jackals and wolves. Be careful now.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The old man responded: “This place is Buddha Holy Ground and it’s bright out. If there happen to be jackals and wolves, they’ll be chanting Buddhist scriptures.”
