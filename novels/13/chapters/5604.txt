Chapter 5605: Just A Cloud?

Luminous and the others recalled the pivotal battles during the great wars. None shocked them as much as the event today.0

Immemorial Epoch had a high casualty rate for imperial-level characters. However, this lasted years and years. Not all of them died in a single battle so this was unprecedented.0

Cultivators’ lives felt so cheap and insignificant afterward. Spectators became traumatized afterward - what was the point of cultivation if emperors could still be wiped out?1

“This is more frightening than the immortal weapon, right?” Luminous murmured, unable to regain his wits for a long time.3

“Buzz.” The loops returned to Li Qiye’s hand and fused into one.0

He swung and it reverted to its rope form with a pulsing immortal light, heading straight for Dao City.0DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It immediately crushed all the seals from Celestial Court, freeing the land and its inhabitants from being paralyzed.0

Billions and billions of mortals and cultivators were utterly confused after being imprisoned and then released.0

Silence ensued as Luminous and the others stared at Li Qiye’s rope. When he loosened his grip, the light dispersed and the rope became the white cloud again.0

It was still as white as snow, albeit a bit fatter now. It seemed angry at Li Qiye like a child puffing his cheeks.1

“Still hungry?” Li Qiye patted its head and smiled.0

The cloud remained unhappy. This wasn’t a matter of being hungry or otherwise but rather, Li Qiye kneading it to a different form and using it as a weapon. 0

It took pride in being a cute cloud, soft and fluffy. Li Qiye’s gentle rubbing couldn’t calm it down.5

Others couldn’t comprehend or fathom the existence of the cloud. This might be something beyond their current knowledge.0

The cloud was certainly the killing weapon, but how? It absorbed the light of Celestial Court and the dao of Immortal Dao City.0

This combination was the key to the death of the armies. They stood no chance when facing the might of Celestial Court and Immortal Dao City.0

“Just what is this thing…” Luminous said quietly.0

Putting aside his impressive cultivation, he was also the lord of Dao City and had a high position in Immortal Dao City.0

After eras of research, Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan and the others, more or less, learned how to control and wield the dao of the treasure.0

However, what the cloud did was unheard of. It coiled around the city and grasped the supreme grand dao, activating an ultimate power.2

Not even Purewood Divine Emperor or Immortal Monarch Yi Ye could have done something like this despite having delved the deepest into the city. How could the cloud do this effortlessly when some of the greatest emperors couldn’t?0

The word “immortal” popped into everyone’s mind as they stared at the cloud. Countless possibilities popped up in their mind.0

At the same time, there was a single survivor on the other side - War Ancient God.0

Of course, some were saved by Celestial Court’s blessing but he was not targeted. He turned around and stood there, waiting with a pale complexion.0

Despite being an apex god, he understood that he couldn’t have stopped those loops. The only reason why his head was still intact was due to Li Qiye purposely sparing him.0

If that’s the case, there was no point in running. He took a deep breath and calmed the raging fear and unease in his heart. His face regained color as he stared at Li Qiye. 0

He stood proudly, no longer showing fear despite experiencing the dreadful display of Li Qiye’s might. He proved himself as one of the few who could stand before Li Qiye without their knees buckling or dropping to the ground.
