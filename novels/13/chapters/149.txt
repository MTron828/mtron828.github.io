Chapter 150 : Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique (2)

Li Qiye smiled and said:

“I am not. This matter isn’t important. After you practice your Physique Law, practice a merit law next. Cultivate the Jade Spiral Merit Law of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.”

“The Jade Spiral Merit Law?”

Chen Baojiao was in a daze, and she couldn’t help but ask:

“The beginner’s merit law of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?”

“Don’t look down upon this merit law. If you could grasp the profoundness of this merit law, it would be enough for you to prosper for a lifetime.”

Li Qiye continued:

“Your Physique is different from ordinary people. You will dual cultivate the Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique as the foundation. The Jade Spiral Merit Law is a correct path of the grand dao. In the future, it will be compatible with all of your arts. As long as you have the Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique to rely on, the Jade Spiral Merit Law is the most compatible merit law, understand?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing the seriousness of Li Qiye, Chen Baojiao did not question his authority! At this moment when Li Qiye was passing on the Physique Law to her, she was completely focused. She was afraid of missing even a single word.

After learning the Physique Law from Li Qiye, she emotionally understood why Li Qiye was so confident. Coming from the Jewel Pillar Sacred School, she had seen many Physique Laws, but after being taught by Li Qiye, she finally understood that this was the real Supreme Immortal Physique Law.

The Physique Scripture could be said to be the source of all Physique Laws! It didn’t just have the twelve Immortal Physique Laws, it was the root of all Physique Laws. Of course, this was only after Li Qiye spent countless moons and millions of years before understanding all of the mysteries of the Physique Scripture!

The twelve Immortal Physique Laws were only a part of the Physique Scripture, and they were only six extremely simple words.

For Chen Baojiao, who practiced the Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique, this was another profound aspect of the Physique Scripture. On top of this, her Physique was not part of the twelve Immortal Physiques.

If one divided the Physiques into ten parts, then the twelve Immortal Physiques were at the limit! For example, the Extreme Yang Immortal Physique was the strongest of Yang. It was a Yang Physique in all ten parts.

Chen Baojiao’s Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique was extremely rare. In the ten parts, Yin and Yang each had one part; Pure and Taint also had one each; Hardness took four parts while Softness had two parts!

One Physique containing all six profound words was an extremely rare Physique!

After being taught the Physique Law by Li Qiye, Chen Baojiao was very emotional! She felt like a fish in the water that had an indescribable sense of ease. Her blood energy rapidly flowed for the first time. Her entire body was floating about like a satisfied immortal, creating thunderous noises as she was being baptized under this Supreme Immortal Physique.

At this moment, Chen Baojiao understood that she did not wrongly choose regarding the most important choice of her life!

Prior to this, the Tyrannical Valley Immortal Spring Physique had always plagued her with difficulties. The truth was that Chen Baojiao’s talent was not bad in itself. Although it was not as great Li Shuangyan, she was still amongst the best. Due to the trap of her Physique, she had to put in countless amounts of effort just to have the same results as others! Nonetheless, Chen Baojiao kept on cultivating, and she was even more diligent than anyone else! With blood and sweat, she finally reached the Named Hero realm.

Now, starting from the beginning once again with an appropriate Physique Law, Chen Baojiao was still a hard worker and her cultivation speed improved by leaps and bounds.

Her hard work and effort amazed others. Li Shuangyan movingly said:

“It seems like I have to double my effort. Otherwise, I will feel the pressure.”

A genius like Li Shuangyan was always hard working, but she felt inferior to Chen Baojiao’s resolution.

After Chen Baojiao achieved a few things with her Physique, Li Qiye finally taught her the Jade Spiral Merit Law. She was shocked about the fact that, in the teachings of Li Qiye, even an ordinary merit law became extraordinary. She finally understood why Li Qiye chose the Jade Spiral Merit Law for her.

After the process, Chen Baojiao’s young heart couldn’t remain calm. She astonishingly stared at Li Qiye, this sixteen year old boy, and exclaimed:

“Are you really just a normal disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?”

“Wrong, I am the prime disciple.”

Li Qiye said.

Chen Baojiao gave him a stern look and added:

“How is a prime disciple any different from an ordinary disciple! If it was an Ancient Kingdom, then a prime disciple would be worth something. The prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect does not have many advantages compared to ordinary disciples.”

“This Little Girl doesn’t know anything!”

Li Qiye knocked her head and said:

“Also, do not belittle your own master. Watch out or I will punish you, you know?”

This flushed Chen Baojiao’s face completely red. She couldn’t help but angrily stare at Li Qiye. She was clearly older than him, yet he kept calling her “little girl” — this truly exasperated her.

She was such an alluring beauty. With her charming presence that swayed others, it would cause their hearts to beat faster, but Li Qiye only smiled and left.

After his departure, Chen Baojiao rubbed the area Li Qiye knocked on and was in a daze. She could be considered a golden jade with peerless beauty. No matter where she was, she would be the moon surrounded by countless geniuses. She was high up above, but today, she was only Li Qiye’s maid.

However, she did not completely hate this feeling nor this status. It was as if by being next to Li Qiye as his maid, she was able to be free and be without worries. At this moment, she understood why a heaven’s proud daughter like Li Shuangyan was also willing to be a sword maid.

After Li Qiye’s cultivation at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the end of the Evil Infested Ridge, more than one year had passed. Suddenly, there was a monumental event happening in the Grand Middle Territory.

Within the Grand Middle Territory, there was suddenly an evil energy that pierced the sky with bright lights. Inside the lights were countless ancient coffins that sung sad, sorrowful tunes! In the far horizon, many coffins were flying by as immortal citizens were worshipping, and there were mourning wise sages amongst this extremely majestic scene. It was as if an Immortal Monarch had just passed away, or a Godly King had his final burial...

Anyone that saw this scene for the first time would be stunned, but for people who had seen this before, they were not too surprised.

This sudden change garnered the attention from many, and many old monsters even came into being.

At this moment, in the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, an archaic character opened his eyes. He was extremely excited.

Inside the War God Temple, an old man that was buried in dust finally moved and emotionally opened his eyes. He couldn’t help but to stand up and alert numerous disciples along with Royal Nobles and Heavenly Kings.

Even as far as the Desolate Wasteland, in the Divine Sword Sacred Ground, a man with boundless killing intent, who was sleeping inside the coffin, suddenly sat up. His eyes pierced the sky and emotionally whispered:

“In this life, someone is reincarnating?”

At this very second, in the Eastern Hundred Cities at the Heavenly Dao Academy and the Southern Barren Earth’s Strange Bamboo Mountain, many old monsters that stood up from their coffins. Some were sighing, some were excited, and some were indifferent and cold... These were the old monsters in the legends, and they were immortals that were buried underground for countless years. Unless it was a sect-destroying matter, these immortal monsters would not appear. However, because of the sudden change today, they were all alerted!

An old, undying man looked at the strange variation in the sky, and he couldn’t help but murmur:

“In this life, could there be a miracle? Someone will actually be able to be reborn?”

Another old immortal with covetousness in their eyes muttered:

“Or, this could be immortality!”

“The Underworld Boat will soon appear!”

The next day, a message swept across the entire Grand Middle Territory like a storm. Then, it spread across the entire northern Grand Sea, southern Barren Earth, eastern Hundred Cities, and western Desolate Wasteland!

After a long time, the entire world knew of this news.

Inside the grand sects and powerful nations of the Grand Middle Territory, even the sect masters and lords of the Immortal Emperor lineages were all stimulated.

The old monsters near death especially couldn’t sit still. They suddenly stood up and rousingly said:

“The Underworld Boat is coming, we need to hurry and leave!”

The Underworld Boat was coming into being — this news exploded in the Grand Middle Territory to all the corners. In a short month, every cultivators were talking about the Underworld Boat.

There was a saying in the Mortal Emperor World: The coming of the Underworld Boat signals a rebirth. The path to the heavenly road will appear, and the godly stones will open!

The Underworld Boat was an extremely mysterious existence. In the Mortal Emperor World, all of the cultivators were curious about it and had no choice but to talk about the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground as well.

As a cultivator in the Mortal Emperor World, some of them will never get to see the Underworld Boat, but they only had one opportunity to enter the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground.

The Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground, in the old legends, was one of the twelve burial grounds in this world! In the Mortal Emperor World, the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground had a different meaning.

The twelve burial grounds buried only the intents of death! Countless people and cultivators in this world hoped to be buried inside the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground when they died. Dying cultivators who had exhausted their lifespans all wished to be taken under this ideal burial ground!
