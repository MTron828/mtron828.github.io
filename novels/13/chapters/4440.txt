Chapter 4441: Hidden Secret

“Cursed by fate and tormented by fiends forever.” Li Qiye said.

The demon trembled and took a deep breath since he had higher access than most to this type of information.

Immortality and revival were coveted by top masters. Immortal was for the self; revival was for others.

After all, a being living for eras would certainly come across people that are worthy of remembrance and love.

Once reaching the shore of immortality, perhaps they would think about reviving their lover and family members…

Of course, Nine-tailed God knew the astronomical price required to revive someone. Perhaps even a legendary immortal would need to pay the piper. Moreover, it seemed that the revived wouldn’t be put in a favorable situation either. They might not be the same as before and could even become an abomination.

“Sir, which are you doing?” Nine-tailed God calmed down and asked about Li Qiye’s intention. It seemed like a revival wouldn’t be possible due to the accursed nature of the feat.

“What is rebirth? It requires a true death first.” Li Qiye didn’t answer directly.

“So that’s not the case here?” Nine-tailed God’s mood became better.

“Indeed, this is withered trees meeting spring again.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“I see…” The demon god murmured and became startled: “Sir, are you saying that Jiu Bian and Feng Qi aren’t completely dead? They’re still around in this world, but how can this be?”

As the strongest ancestor of Demon, he had observed the battlefield and thought about this legend before. His conclusion was that both combatants have been reduced to ashes in the present day. In other words, both were as dead as can be. Many other sages before him came to this conclusion as well.

“Why not?” Li Qiye stared at him and said: “It’s just that their existence is different from everyone else. Their race is special and has unique advantages, far superior to anything else. That’s why their secret domains are around so long in your sect.”

“I see.” Nine-tailed God understood.

“It’s more than that too. This place is very special, a big reason why they fought to the death.” Li Qiye revealed a mysterious smile.

Nine-tailed God knew that this battlefield was special, albeit nothing exact. Now, he became excited right away after hearing the topic.

“So they really gave it everything just to take this land? Is there a peerless treasure hidden here?” He became emotional.

The legend did say that they fought over something peerless, necessitating an ultimate battle.

Numerous thoughts coursed through the demon’s head. Feng Qi was considered the youngest dao lord, completely matchless. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that there was no one like her in the past and no one like her in the future.

Jiu Bian was another invincible character, as mysterious as can be. Either of them was definitely on the apex of Eight Desolaces.

They had seen all types of treasures before. In fact, most treasures in the world were nothing more than trash to them. However, their death was due to a potential item.

The thought of such an item made the demon god shudder because even a paragon treasure might not be worth risking their lives over.

“It might not be here, just an opportunity.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Please elaborate, Sir.” The demon bowed and sincerely asked but then thought about something: “Wait, is, is it about immortality?”

Whatever was here tempted top masters including dao lords. Immortality would be one answer.

“If you become unbeatable, what will be the next pursuit?” Li Qiye asked.

“Immortality.” The demon said right away.

Currently, there were still those stronger than him. However, the biggest pursuit for him would still be immortality. Reputation and honor for the lineage didn’t matter. Those things were external and couldn’t tie him down.

The only thing worth spending the rest of his life for was immortality. This was a common path for many masters later on.

“What do you think Feng Qi and Jiu Bian pursued?” Li Qiye asked again. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The demon became emotional after hearing this information. These two beings were certainly unbeatable. Thus, his guess was right. The only answer seemed to be immortality!

“A secret to immortality is hidden here, or at least an opportunity for it.” The demon said. This conclusion easily explained why Feng Qi and Jiu Bian fought bitterly, and why dao lords had never given up learning about Ravaged Land.
