Chapter 4936: The Bringer of Bad Luck

The audience watched with bated breath as one second turned into another, it felt like an eternity for them. The young monarch was indeed formidable.

His movements caused drastic shifts in the atmosphere. Visual phenomena, accompanied by the dazzling radiance from treasures, could be seen by the spectators.

He attempted to grasp some of them, but the phenomena only lasted for a brief moment, disappearing before he could touch them.

Each image clearly represented an amazing treasure, available for the “fortunate” ones.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Since the monarch was stronger than the rest, he was able to perform an actual search. He relied on the power of his sacred fruit to expand his reach inside the sack.

The difference between a dragon lord and regular sovereigns was clear to everyone. Unfortunately, he couldn’t actually capture anything despite sensing their existence.

“Time’s up.” The old man said.

He was not only unable to pick up treasures but also failed to retrieve even a single pebble from the sack. He stood there, frozen and red with embarrassment.

"Remove your hand." The old man spoke again.

Reluctantly, he pulled back his hand, revealing that he had obtained nothing - true to Li Qiye's claim.

The scene became silent as everyone stared at him in disbelief. This was the third “coincidence” thus far.

Most importantly, he exchanged a precious treasure on top of being stronger than the rest. It would be unwise to dismiss this as mere chance.

Students began to calm down and glance over at Li Qiye. For some inexplicable reason, they began to feel a sense of fear and unease toward him. This had nothing to do with his power, only his ominous ability.

Some had previously mentioned the possibility of him being a jinx. Most had not believed it, but now, what other explanation could there be?

No one wanted to be near someone with this curse, for fear that it might infect them as well.

"You have lost, Young Monarch," Ming Shi said with a triumphant laugh: “Isn't it time for you to face the consequences? I think I'll have to find a suitable punishment, maybe a stick." Her boldness was unmatched, as she was the only person who dared to speak to him in such a way.

The monarch's face turned red with anger and embarrassment. He had accepted the bet, believing that sorcery wasn’t real. Now, as a powerful dragon lord, he was forced to apologize and take responsibility to a junior, causing him to lose all face and respect.

The onlookers watched in silence, unsure of how to react. Those from The Race naturally sided with him, but the others were hesitant to mock or provoke him. His powerful aura alone was intimidating, and angering a dragon lord could be a death wish.

Suddenly, a loud boom echoed through the air as a palace in the distant land erupted with a massive light wave. The crowd turned their attention to the explosion, wondering what could have caused it.

As they watched, phenomena began to appear in the sky - floating mountains and rivers materialized before their eyes. These peaks were incredibly majestic and awe-inspiring. Everyone couldn't help but stare in amazement at this unexpected and extraordinary event.

As the light faded, the crowd could see that the Dao was being harmonized within the palace and divine beasts were visible. Various law cycles were taking place, creating an otherworldly scene.

It was as if an ancient treasury had just been opened, revealing treasures that surpassed all else.

"Is this a treasury?" The students exclaimed in awe.

"It appears so." Someone replied. Most have never heard of such an event occurring in this land before.

"Benevolence! It's been activated!" The Young Monarch exclaimed, his expression changing as he realized the significance of what was happening.

He then no longer gave a damn about anything else and soared toward the source of the light.

“That’s our missing item!” Swordgrasp and Halo also rushed back.

“The treasure!” The remaining students finally understood the situation.

Deity has been pursuing the thief all the way back to the academy. Now, it seemed that this person has successfully activated the item.

A flood of students returned to Abroad, completely forgetting about the pawnshop. They didn’t want to miss it.

“We should go too!” The princess also left.

“Miss Jian, shall we?” Goldcrest felt the same way and flew back to Abroad.

Yunyun, on the other hand, stuck with Li Qiye. She asked: “Brother Bai has been caught.”

Only the two of them knew about Bai Shaojin and Benevolence.

“He comprehended the secret to success and opened Benevolence.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So the treasury is available now?” She became startled.

According to the legend, Feather Immortal Monarch took all the resources of Immemorial Palace to the vessel. It must be more insane than any current lineage in the lower continents. No wonder why Deity couldn’t let go.

Li Qiye chuckled and walked to the carriage instead.

“Do we know each other?” The old man stared at Li Qiye with confusion in his eyes.

“You’re just a block of wood, that’s why you can’t recognize me.” Li Qiye smiled and knocked on his forehead repeatedly.
