“They all used the stones from the corpses before!” People caught on.

“Damn, the black stones were bait!” One ancestor regained his wits and said: “It’s that black octopus doing this! It released the corpses so people would consume the stones!”

He then took out his black stone and threw it away.

It didn’t take long before people realized that the monster was using cultivators to gestate the black stones. Those with the black stones on them felt worse and started throwing them away, no longer caring about the previous exorbitant purchase price.

Fishing required bait. In order to increase their power and life, numerous experts chose to eat these stones. They were dead now from the lightning bolts breaking out of their chest.

“Buzz.” The maelstrom absorbed these black bolts and became resplendent - same with the black gem.

“Boom!” Something seemed to have exploded in this instant. The entire world shook as a result.

The black stone spewed out endless black lightning bolts towards Li Qiye in an unstoppable manner. It looked majestic and never-ending like an apocalyptic flood - capable of destroying everything in this world. Time and space, the grand dao, and the myriad laws would become poor victims.

There was no escaping or avoiding its onslaught so it instantly struck Li Qiye.

“Boom!” It smashed into his sacred light, resulting in a deafening blast.

“Rumble!” The light transformed into a boundless flame to stop the incoming waves of lightning.

This became a contest between fire and lightning. The dark light didn’t relent and continued to send more bolts to extinguish Li Qiye’s flame.

Moreover, the tiny particles from the bolts seemed to have a magnetic force. They attached themselves to the flame whenever possible and began drilling their way through his defense.

On one side was an ultimate beam of lightning and on the other, Li Qiye had a massive flame barrier. The latter wouldn’t fall despite the continuous barrages.

This stalemate continued since the bolts had no way of breaking down this line of defense in a short time.

Puresword True Emperor, Venerable Deer Merchant, Four Esteemed King, and the Tree Observer exchanged glances.

They have been tempted by this wonderful opportunity - Li Qiye being occupied with the lightning waves.

He was certainly at a disadvantage against any attack, utterly vulnerable. A third party could grievously injure or even kill him.

That’s why the group didn’t want to let this chance go by or the future would be quite grim for them later.

Li Qiye has shown his might so they have lost their confidence in beating him together.

“Clank!” The emperor’s sword hymned. Its ray shot to the sky and unleashed magnificent energy.

This naturally attracted everyone’s attention.

“Over there!” Some cultivators gasped after seeing the massive energy building up and the surging imperial aura.

Even a fool knew what the group wanted to do and could see why this was a necessary move.

“Forgive me, Fellow Daoist!” The emperor roared and unleashed a slash. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Clank!” A million swords appeared in the air and issued their hymns. They rotated continuously to form a supreme world of swords.

“A sword domain!” A spectator shouted. This domain with unlimited blades could annihilate all existences.

“Die!” Strangely enough, the Four Esteemed King attacked even faster than the emperor.

“Bump! Bump! Boom!” He crazily smashed his drum and unleashed enough sound waves to drown the world. They headed straight for Li Qiye like a tsunami.

One star broke after another by the impressive attack.

“Boom!” The area around Li Qiye crumbled by the force before a direct hit.

“Clank!” At the same time, the sword domain instantly appeared above him. All the swords stopped rotating and pointed straight at him, ready to end this powerful foe.

“It’s time!” The Tree Observer and the deer merchant worked together.

The majestic force from the observer instantly channeled into the merchant’s antlers.

The latter then pierced through the sword domain and the sound waves to penetrate Li Qiye’s chest with his sharp antlers.

“How shameless.” Jade-break True Emperor’s expression soured as she took a step forward.

However, an invisible hand held her by the shoulder. An ancient voice sounded behind her: “Don’t worry, his power far exceeded your imagination so he doesn’t require your assistance. Just watch the show.”

There was no one behind her. It seemed that the speaker wasn’t actually here.

She hesitated for a moment before taking a deep breath and deciding to believe this person.
