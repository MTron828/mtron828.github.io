Chapter 5594: Celestial Court’s Blessing

Not long ago, most thought that Imperial West Bank was already the ruler of Dao Domain given its mighty cultivators and nine legions.

The western line was going to be the toughest to break. Why was it not erected during this crucial moment? Where were the emperors and dragon lords of West Bank?

The big shots’ morale plummeted after seeing this. What was West Bank trying to do?

Their inactivity left the west of Dao City fully exposed. The nearest army of Celestial Court could push through at any moment.

“Are they remaining neutral?” A few cultivators felt hopeless after seeing this.

“Perhaps they have joined Celestial Court already.” Some were furious to see this.

As everyone worked together to fight to the death, the strongest clan of Dao Domain remained reclusive. Others had no choice but to think of the worst scenario.

After all, this wouldn’t be an unprecedented matter. People have switched sides ever since the start of Immemorial Epoch War.

“They could just be trying to maintain their forces, only focusing on future survival.” A few didn’t wish to think badly of West Bank - a clan that had lost numerous members while fighting Celestial Court in the past. There was no way they would plead loyalty to their mortal enemy.

“Activate!” Luminous roared again and released a shining radiance.

With West Bank not answering the call, he had no choice but to use his power to activate Dao Domain’s defense.

His supreme power caused constant detonations and buzzes. Energy streams coursed throughout Dao Domain and created dao runes.

“Boom!” Barriers and walls appeared on the western line.

As the strongest conqueror of Dao Domain and one of the greatest in history, Luminous had control over the city’s defenses.

They were built in the past, one layer upon another, for the sake of stopping Celestial Court. Luminous alone couldn’t fully utilize these defenses compared to the alliance inside Immortal Dao City. Nonetheless, it was still better than nothing.

“Boom!” War Ancient God immediately attacked with a suppressive palm slash. This move alone could kill several emperors and monarchs.

The hatchet-like palm split everything apart. Luminous roared and became resplendent, summoning his primordial dao fruit.

It soared into the air and released a frightening amount of primordial energy, gestating an anima tree within. This allowed him to stop the palm slash from War.

“Not bad at all, this fruit.” War didn’t dare to underestimate the enemy - an apex conqueror with a primordial fruit.

“Boom!” War’s battle spirit surged and he turned into a mad god. His muscles bulged outward and lightning currents flowed around him. His totems appeared and turned into a great kingdom. Its godlike inhabitants fueled him with endless power.

Moreover, the heavenly radiance from above blessed him and gave him an unbreakable armor of light.

“This heavenly treasure…” Luminous remarked with envy. He could have enjoyed a similar blessing as well from Immortal Dao City.

“Break!” War chopped again in his empowered state. Endless dao power rushed toward Luminous.

“Go!” Luminous’ radiance became blinding. The world trembled as he gathered countless rays to forge a radiant spear with crackling energy.

With this spear bridging across the nine firmaments, he could withstand the onslaught of a thousand emperors and gods.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Rumble!” He blocked the earth-shattering blow from War.

Deafening blasts detonated under the impact of the strikes. Countless peaks shattered and many living beings dissipated from the world without realizing what was going on.
