Chapter 4407: Future Potential

“I can certainly give you more time. Just be aware that my patience is limited. Once it runs out, don’t complain that I didn’t give you a chance.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Perfect, perfect.” Ancient Pheasant heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the situation taking a turn for the better.

“Keep in mind that things might happen with the palace, this is an early warning.” Li Qiye added.

“Sir, please don’t take our palace away…” Ancient Pheasant’s heart skipped a beat.

Demon Realm Palace, in a sense, served as a spiritual totem for Dragon. If it were taken away one day, it could signal the decline of the sect.

Its value was impossible to gauge. Numerous top existences had tried before but for a myriad of reasons, Dragon was able to keep it in the sect.

Now, he wasn’t sure whether Li Qiye was strong enough to take the entire palace away. However, this was terrible news for the sect. If possible, he would try his best to prevent Li Qiye from doing so.

“The palace has an incredible background. Your progenitor was very lucky to obtain it. However, I don’t need to take it with me, I’ll just be taking a look.” Li Qiye elaborated.

Ancient Pheasant felt much better. Curiosity also took over.

“Sir, you actually know its origin? What is it?” He asked.

There were ample explanations and records regarding the palace. Alas, not a single one was considered to be the truth.

The palace was mentioned repeatedly as the cause of the fight between Feng Qi and Jiu Bian, resulting in mutual destruction.

The ancestors of Dragon only knew that their progenitor had sealed it in the sect. No knowledge was left behind on its actual origin, only that the progenitor had dragged it back from a different dimension.

“It does not belong to this world.” Li Qiye kept it vague then added: “This girl, let her enter.”

Jian Qingzhu heard this and immediately responded: “Young Noble, I’ve received the love of the sect and had entered before already.”

She had obtained a dao bone during the previous entry and crafted a saber with it. She was very satisfied with this result.

“You can’t compare the present with the past, try again.” Li Qiye said.

“I see.” She agreed because she felt a great change after receiving his gift.

“That’s fine. We can absolutely arrange this.” Ancient Pheasant agreed right away.

In his opinion, Jian Qingzhu was already a top talent. Moreover, her recent transformation would make her a future pillar. They needed to put more effort into grooming her so it was fine to let her enter the palace again.

In fact, Li Qiye didn’t even need to ask. The ancestors would have deliberated this issue and let her come in again.

“Ah, Sir, didn’t you bring disciples from Little Diamond with you?” Ancient Pheasant laughed and suggested: “If you don’t mind, they can also enter the palace and give it a shot.”

He wanted to please Li Qiye and make the guy owe them a favor. It would make it awkward for Li Qiye to do anything overly drastic later on.

Furthermore, the members of Little Diamond were just common cultivators. They might not get anything from the palace so, in reality, Dragon would lose nothing while Li Qiye would owe them one.

Thus, Ancient Pheasant made this decision himself without informing the other ancestors.

“One becomes quite crafty after living long enough.” Li Qiye commented.

“You’re too kind, Young Noble.” Ancient Pheasant naturally knew that Li Qiye could see through his plan. There was no point in denying it.

“Your disciple must be unique as well, he should also enter.” Jian Qingzhu suggested.

“It doesn’t matter that much.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Mmm?” Qingzhu found this strange. Li Qiye was acting rather nonchalant about his own disciple and didn’t give him anything special. On the other hand, he gave a stranger like her an incredible fortune.

“He’s different from you.” Li Qiye explained: “An unsculpted grand dao embarking on an endless journey, all he needs to do is maintain his conviction and dao heart, his future achievement will be far greater than yours.”

“A disciple of yours must certainly be a true dragon.” Qingzhu had no problem with this assessment.

However, she was still confused because she had seen Wang Weiqiao before. He was only a regular cultivator at best. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

She didn’t understand why he recruited him as a disciple. Other top masters only picked the best possible geniuses, not Li Qiye.

Others might criticize him for mistreating his own disciple while favoring outsiders more, that he wasn’t performing his duty as a master.

Furthermore, she wondered about Li Qiye’s assessment. How successful would Wang Weiqiao be in the future?

She believed that she had a chance of surpassing her ancestor - Sacred Luan. No one else would think that Wang Weiqiao could outdo Jian Qingzhu.

“I hope to see your disciple soon.” Ancient Pheasant became interested as well.

Li Qiye only smiled in response.

“Sir, do you wish to go to Tiger Pond to see the old geezer now?” Ancient Pheasant ordered Jian Qingzhu to return to the sect and wanted to travel to Tiger Pond with Li Qiye alone.

The older geezer was known as Ancient Lion. With his permission, Li Qiye would have no trouble entering the secret area of Tiger Pond.

Li Qiye agreed since he had no problem with this arrangement.

Meanwhile, the grand ceremony was still commencing back in the city.

Clouds appeared in the sky along with fluttering banners. They came together to form a path spanning a thousand miles above and stretching towards the horizon.

Disciples of Dragon stood to the side while holding their sect’s banner.

Spectators became emotional after seeing this. Dragon was truly going all out with this reception.

“The esteemed guest is coming.” Someone murmured.

“That’s putting it lightly, I’ve been here for a century and never saw anything like this before.” An expert said.

“Must be a prestigious big shot.” A high elder commented.

“I think less than ten people deserve this type of treatment in all of Sky Border.” Another counted with his fingers.

“I know who it is!” A cultivator with a good information network found the answer.
