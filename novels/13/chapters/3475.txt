The colossal sword seemed capable of splitting the world into two. This momentum was enough to frighten the spectators.

“Clank! Clank! ClLank!” The spectating disciples from Firmaments unsheathed their sword and let their aura roam free. The area became engulfed by terrible sword energies.

Both Skylight and Firmaments have brought their top leaders to deal with Li Qiye.

“Is it happening? What should we do?” Those harboring nefarious intents wondered about the correct course of action.

These two sects have made it clear that they wouldn’t let this go. The others naturally wouldn’t either.

“Keep watching, maybe?” An ancestor pondered.

Most still didn’t know how much force the two sects have brought, especially the number of ancestors. Thus, hesitation arose since they didn’t wish to provoke nor oppose these behemoths.

Alas, the temptation of the treasury was just too much. Some considered the risk to be acceptable. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Li Qiye, you have shown your cruelty by murdering 100,000 good men, nothing less of death should be the punishment. Blood for blood is the norm but we’re nothing less than reasonable. Surrender and a fair trial shall be granted.” The national teacher spoke as if he was on the side of righteousness.

Only new, naive cultivators would take him seriously, thinking that he was being merciful despite having an army killed by Li Qiye. This was the style of a big country?

“It’s a cat crying over a dead mouse.” The older cultivators were too experienced for this. One snorted and said: “They just want to capture and bring him back to keep the treasury and legacy. He made it sound so flowery.”

The naive ones immediately reacted and understood the situation. “Older ginger is hotter indeed.” This comment was aimed towards the older cultivators and the national teacher.

This high-ranking official didn’t bring up the treasury at all, only that Li Qiye was a heinous villain while still wanting to give him a fair trial.

This was killing two birds with one stone - earning admiration and the treasures.

“All feel nothing but rage and indignation for what you have done, murderer. Nonetheless, righteous sects like ours won’t execute you right away. We’ll give you a chance to defend yourself and state your case. Surrender and you might survive.” Firmaments Sect Master said seriously.

He had the same tone as the national teacher. The two were clearly working together for three things - the imperial treasury, the legacy of the phoenix, and even the phoenix bloodline.

Their justification trumped the ones earlier who talked about their right to the treasury. It was harder to refute since they took the moral high ground.

“I see.” Li Qiye chuckled and casually responded: “I’m a heinous villain so I don’t need to defend myself or a trial, definitely not repenting either. Don’t spew bullshit about justice, just say that you want the treasury and the phoenix’s legacy, it’s right here. Come, they’ll be yours if you’re capable enough.”

His words were even more moving than his opponents’.

“So there are treasures!” Some members of the crowd shouted excitedly.

“That’s right, phoenix true feathers, phoenix grand dao, phoenix eggs, which ones do you want?” Li Qiye leisurely said.

“See, I knew it! That area was really the nest of a phoenix containing its legacies.” A furor broke out among the crowd.

Eyes turned red once more. Any of the aforementioned treasures was priceless.

The national teacher and Firmaments Sect Master’s eyes flashed with a terrible glint as well.

Though they were powerful and held important positions, they had never seen these phoenix treasures, let alone possessing some. That’s why they were about to go crazy.

“Rumble!” They raised their hands and the two armies immediately rushed towards Li Qiye and surrounded him.

“A trial requires the presence of everyone else, Skylight and Firmaments alone can’t give a fair trial!” Someone immediately protested.

“He’s right, your two sects alone can’t be in charge of this. Other powers should have a say.” One ancestor stepped up.

Some of them got in the way of the two armies, whether on purpose or not. They weren’t on Li Qiye’s side, it’s just that once he was captured, trying to seize the treasures then would be next to impossible.

Li Qiye watched with a smile on his face, ready to see a fight between these sects.

“Move aside or face the consequences.” Firmaments Sect Master’s eyes turned cold.

“Logic and reason trump all.” One disciple from a big sect shouted: “Since you have been talking about a fair trial, you should follow your words. Let everyone have a say on Li Qiye.”

“I agree, that’s the only way for the trial to be just.” Others chimed in, wanting to stop the two behemoths.

In their opinion, Li Qiye was completely helpless against these two armies and the rest of them. He had no chance of escaping the blockade.

“Kill them!” The national master of Skylight was fierce and decided to attack without wasting words.

“Kill!” Both Skylight and Firmaments began attacking the crowd.

“Ahhh!” Laments of battle echoed across the field. The two armies were elite and quickly caught the crowd off guard. Numerous cultivators were massacred.

“Enough!” A few ancestors became enraged and channeled their energy. Explosions detonated as the earth trembled.

These ancestors were capable enough to resist the two armies. Thus, the fights became contested and bloodied even though they still didn’t have the treasury yet.

“Greedy trash.” Li Qiye shook his head and smiled.

No one paid attention to him right now due to the raging battle.
