Chapter 5304: Who May You Be?

“Boom!” Meanwhile, a devastating battle raged on outside of Lesser Firmament.

Xiao Qingtian, Heaven Hammer Conqueror, and their legion wanted to seize Moon Embrace from the man. They were promptly stopped by the old servant who resembled an unbreakable fortress.

Everyone gasped after seeing this, wondering about his actual identity. He was fighting against some impressive foes yet he had no problem stopping them.

The list included a twelve-fruit dragon lord and an eight-fruit conqueror. This was utterly inconceivable.

As for the middle-aged man, he happily rubbed the armor just like a young master receiving a new robe for the New Year celebration - one beautiful and made from the softest silk.

He laughed heartily like a child without knowing why he was so excited. All in all, it felt that the armor was just right when attached to his body. 

Of course, others expected this out of him. After all, they would be acting the same way after wearing an immortal armament. In fact, some might be even crazier.

“Who may you be?” Heaven Hammer, on the other hand, focused on the old servant - the person preventing everyone from getting close to Moon Embrace.

“I am my lord’s servant.” The old servant didn’t state his name.

Everyone thought that he must be someone with twelve dao fruits, either a conqueror or dao lord. Of course, he could be an emperor or monarch with twelve wills as well.

Why would such an invincible master subject himself to being someone else’s servant?

“Boom!” On the other side, Immortal Emperor Yang Sheng utilized the power of his Heaven’s Wills to fight against Godcloud and Lantern’s group.

“That’s all you can do?” He said domineeringly.

Members of the crowd admired him, not only for his power but also for his hotheaded youthfulness. It was nice to “be” young” despite being from the previous epoch.

In reality, he should have one foot in the grave while Lantern and Godcloud were the young ones.

The young geniuses observed him and hoped that they could be the same way during their last years.

“Rumble!” The fog suddenly returned and invaded Lesser Firmament again, wanting to break down the crystal walls.

“Seal!” The masters inside initiated their sealing formation once more.

However, the fog surged upward and broke through the containment.

“Shit!” Yang Sheng and Guan Feng retreated and joined the fray, channeling the power of their Heaven’s Wills.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Unfortunately, this proved to be insufficient. The emperors were sent flying as something seemed to be awakening - an unstoppable giant capable of toppling the world.

It destroyed the wall before its path and finally escaped. The sky turned dark afterward; no power under heaven could stop it now.

“What the hell is it?!” Everyone became frightened after seeing this seemingly-alive fog. It finally escaped its prison in Lesser Firmament.

“Boom!” It opened a majestic portal with pulsing waves capable of destroying the upper continents.

Dragon lords and conquerors became frozen after sensing its might. They saw an ashen world beyond with nothing but the grand dao in their initial forms.

Dao rivers flowed toward the unknown. There were no concepts of time and space here, no distance and coordinates either. Common sense and worldly rules didn’t apply here.

“Ultimate!” Spectators recognized it - one of the four broken realms.

This fog was something else - capable of opening a portal to this forbidden zone.

Back in Imperial Attendant City, Suppression Conqueror had opened a portal to Redflood World. However, it required a specific method, unlike the fog. The disparity in power was rather obvious.

Lightning bolts from illusory stars descended from space, traveling through time itself. They bombarded the fog and caused it to bellow in pain.

However, despite being pinned by the lightning bolts, it still leaped up and entered the portal.
