The Kui also stopped after reaching a stream inside the mountain range. In the center was a pool filled with rocks, dried up, perhaps from over-consumption by the coinbeasts since the start of time.

The Kui stood in front of the pool, seemingly waiting for something. Upon closer inspection, if the mountain range was a massive beast, then its mouth would be here, drinking to its content in the past.

“What is it doing?” Bingning asked about the Kui.

“Waiting.” Li Qiye closed his eyes, not in a hurry at all.

The two girls had to do the same, ignorant of his goal in Coinbeast City.

Some time had passed and came a splashing sound. A spring gushed from the bottom of the pool with a milky color and smell.

More liquid oozed out in other parts. If one were to compare the liquid here to the other locations, they would find that it was thicker and milkier, and that the smell was purer and more refreshing.

This seemed to be the origin of the beast springs. The other places were diluted and inferior.

The Kui began to drink without holding back since there was no other competition here.

“Beast springs...” Bingning didn’t think she would be able to see this legendary liquid.

“What are the benefits?” Ximo curiously asked.

“Life prolongment, but for the beast, it can grant them youth again.” Li Qiye plainly said.

Ximo became tempted after hearing this. Of course, she was too young for this but the old men in her clan did. Given their power, they weren’t qualified to reach this place.

Nevertheless, she didn’t dare to do anything when the Kui was around. Someone as weak as her competing with it for the liquid? Just one exhale could turn her to dust.

“You can go, it’s good to bring some back.” Li Qiye chuckled: “It won’t be a waste of this trip. Moreover, the spring here is far more precious compared to any other places. You wouldn’t have the chance to get it without riding a beast of this level.”

Ximo became happy and got down from the beast to get some liquid.

“I’ll do it too.” Bingning also jumped down and took out a treasure vase. This would be a great gift for her seniors.

Who knows if the beast heard Li Qiye or if there was no other competition. It continued to drink after briefly glancing at the two girls.

Li Qiye also got a bottle before looking at the sky: “It’s about time to move on.”

Sure enough, the pool that was filled with spring suddenly became empty once more. Not even a single drop was left, same with the other puddles and streams in this area.

At the same time, this happened to the other places in Coinbeast City as well. It seemed that when the time was right, the liquid would return to the land.

“Fuck, I didn’t get any!” One cultivator cursed.

“It’s too late...” The latecomers shouted with regrets.

Some beasts were furiously shouting at the sky too. They didn’t have the chance to drink just yet. Roars of anger and lament echoed, instilling fear into the listeners.

On the other side, the Kui seemed very calm as if this wasn’t anything new.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye ordered.

The girls jumped back on the beast, prepping for the next part of the journey.

The Kui moved deeper into the mountain range. Its familiarity perhaps indicated that this wasn’t its first visit.

The mountains spanned endlessly, decorated with lush trees and snowy peaks, almost as if jade dragons were coiling around them. The sceneries were beautiful beyond words. Heavenly waterfalls, lakes with jewel-like water...

Anyone would be lost in admiration. Of course, treasures were unbelievable here too.

As the Kui passed by, there was a nest along the cliff of a mountain.

This nest was built with divine feathers shimmering with a golden glow, soft, perhaps the softest of them all.

Only a single egg was present, around the size of a bowl. It looked much more humble compared to eggs in the other areas since they were as big as water basins. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It emitted a gentle green light, looking just like a jade work of art. One wouldn’t expect it to be an egg.

True fire would occasionally flicker. This was a monstrous type; even a True God would be turned to ashes upon touching it.

“Wow...” Bingning’s expression changed.

“It’s a good one.” Li Qiye glanced at it and a smile curled his lips: “It won’t be a Vermillion Bird, but its blood is very close to being one. Perhaps it will become something similar to this one right here.” Having said that, he gently patted the Kui’s head.

“The egg is that strong?” Both the girls were moved.

Though she hasn’t seen the Kui in action just yet, the prostration from all the other beasts indicated its might.

“Yes.” Li Qiye agreed with a nod but was not tempted.

“Why aren’t you taking it?” Bingning became curious since this egg was a coveted jewel.

“Only close to being a Vermillion Bird, not one yet.” Li Qiye chuckled: “The latter case is a bit interesting, but this one is still not enough. This isn’t an issue of whether it is strong or not. A divine beast has intrinsic value far above its battle potential.”

“Instead of grooming that egg, I rather train a progenitor. For example, this fella right here wouldn’t have any advantage against one, and against an immortal lineage one? No chance.” He continued rubbing its head.

The Kiu seemed unhappy with that statement and let out a quiet roar. Nevertheless, it didn’t become angry. It possessed true intelligence, far above ordinary coinbeasts.

Bingning was naturally astonished. Grooming a powerful coinbeast was quite desirable. For example, Elucidation True Emperor got a Bi’an back then for his system.

Ximo took one last look at that egg. She didn’t think about it because first of all, she didn’t have the power to obtain it. Even if she did, she wouldn’t be able to help it hatch or feed it in the first place.

A beast at this level couldn’t be kept by just anyone. Only the truly strong had this privilege.
