Chapter 4165: Sword River

The expansive river resembled a dragon coiling around the inner domains. It acted as the outermost region, the first stop for all visitors.

“Rumble!” The current of broken metals surged violently. The sheer length of the river left spectators in awe while imagining the number of swords in there. There were waterfalls along the way as well, only making the event more magnificent.

Some whirlpools also formed naturally; the clankings were loud and unbearable. Waves of swords also struck the shores repeatedly.

To the sides were mountains engulfed in poisonous miasma and mist. Dangerous creatures loomed among the strange boulders and cliffs. Sword deposits piled up on the shores, looking like metallic marshes. It wouldn’t be wise to walk in there… Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Thus, this outermost region was rather diverse in physical features. There was only one constant - the ever-present danger.

Of course, the miasma and unknown creatures were frightening. However, the most dangerous thing was the river itself.

Any attempt to cross would be met with sword energies from the current. A monstrous beam was flowing in there alongside the scrap metals.

“I’ve never seen so many broken swords before. Where did they come from?” A first-timer was astounded to see the river.

While standing at the upper reaches, one couldn’t see the end of the river despite using their heavenly gaze.

“Is there an end to the river?” Another wondered.

“Who knows?” An ancestor shook his head: “Rumor has it that no one has made it to the source. Some believe that it might be in the same location as the burial ground’s origin domain.”

“Why not? The river is right here, we just need to keep on walking.” One youth said, thinking that it was only a matter of distance.

“It’s because you haven’t experienced the flowing sword energies embedded in the current. It is all-permeating and dense, nearly materializing into physical form. You can’t withstand this energy in this location, let alone anywhere near the source.” Another explained.

“This is true, a great master from Flame Valley Dao Institution took pride in his power and tried to figure out this river. He never returned.” A big shot said.

“Where is it flowing to?” A youth looked downstream.

“No one knows.” An ancestor said: “The river is long with numerous twists and turns. The shores are dangerous too. There’s not enough information on it because previous adventurers are all dead.”

“So both ends of the river are unknown?” The youth murmured.

“Yes, the interesting part is the rumor of there being invincible swords hidden at both ends. Of course, this is unsubstantiated.” One clan master interjected.

“Really?” The youth looked down at the broken pieces, looking skeptical.

There were only scraps, no sign of something noteworthy.

“They’re there, but it depends on your own fortune whether you’ll see them or not.” A senior elaborated: “Innumerable pieces are always flowing so there are divine swords mixed in there too. Some might be at the bottom, the shore, or stuck at the turns.” He then stared at the youth.

“How do I find them?” The youth became increasingly interested.

“Just keep watching or look around more.” A senior suggested.

The youth decided to wait near a safe area by the shore, patiently waiting for a divine sword.

Others had prior knowledge of the river and decided to walk along the shore. They paid particular attention to pits and anywhere that could have a stuck sword.

“Activate!” One expert didn’t like to wait and wanted to search the bottom of the river itself.

Cultivators, after all, had gained the power to change the terrains. Removing the water of an entire river wasn’t a problem for them.

His grand dao resonated and reached the river, dragging up millions of scrap pieces.

“Clank!” The sword energy immediately erupted and sent out countless rays.

The expert reacted perfectly and summoned a defensive treasure to stop the rays. Unfortunately, it was an issue of power, not speed. The rays still pierced through the treasure and his body, instantly killing him.

His screams shocked the audience. Some of them had shared the same thought, wanting to check the bottom of the river for divine swords.

“Don’t mess with the current, the sword energy there will immediately retaliate.” A senior warned the young ones.

Of course, not all were unlucky. One cultivator accidentally stepped on a pile of mud and noticed a bright flash. He immediately checked and found a radiant sword.

He was smart enough to immediately put it away and leave without taking a look. After all, he was alone and didn’t want to become a victim due to greed.

Alas, someone still noticed him.

“Hey! That guy from Chali Monastery found a nice sword!” The person shouted right away. Nonetheless, he was already long gone.

“What type of sword?” Others became excited.

The shouter shook his head: “I didn’t get a clear view, it’s a sword pulsing with a crimson light, the grade should be high.”

“Keep looking, maybe there are other swords stuck here.” The crowd immediately tried to dig up the mud.

In another location, there were hymns coming from a basin. The noises were louder and clearer than those coming from the current.

Because of this, some people took note right away and came over.

“There’s a divine sword right there!” The flow at the basin was weaker so they could see the sword floating up and down. The rays coming from it crush the scrap metals nearby.

“I got it!” An expert leaped over and reached for it.
