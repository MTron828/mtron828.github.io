In fact, Shen Xiaoshan and the others were curious, just like the manager, about the magical content. There were so many treasures in the store yet Li Qiye was fixated on the box alone.

They gave it a careful look but couldn’t see what was special about it.

“I don’t know either.” Li Qiye shook his head: “But that’s why I must find out. Very few things could elude my gaze but here we are now. Isn’t this worth finding out?”

The manager was taken aback since he thought Li Qiye knew something and that’s why he wanted the box so bad. He didn’t wonder whether Li Qiye was telling the truth or not since the box was his now. No point in thinking about it.

“You are so wise already yet you still seek further knowledge, we are ashamed.” The manager cupped his fist and said: “I’m sure your future will be boundlessly brilliant once you cultivate.”

This was not an empty praise. He was an amazing expert but his knowledge was far inferior compared to a mortal like Li Qiye. That’s why he had a very high evaluation of Li Qiye.

“The grand dao is long and arduous, no need to rush.” Li Qiye said: “Cultivation is easy but maintaining one’s mind isn’t. Each step must be careful and polished along the way.”

The manager felt a sense of respect after hearing this: “Your words can grant others a flash of insight. If you are willing, sir, I will recommend you to the Jilin Clan. It is not a bad option.”

Shi Sou’s group was shocked after hearing this. So many people in this region wanted to join the Jilin Clan. For example, if they could join, it would be like a phoenix soaring to the sky or a carp crossing the dragon gate. It was a glorious thing for both their ancestors and Sago Palm.

If Li Qiye could join the Jilin Clan without an examination, the result would be exactly what their master wanted. They could follow him and get connections there as well. Thus, the group jubilated and stared at Li Qiye, waiting for his response.

They all wanted him to say yes to this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, coveted by so many.

“Join the Jilin?” Li Qiye chuckled and shook his head: “Sorry, I’m not planning on having a teacher. The grand dao might be hard but I believe I can find my own path.”

His refusal stunned the group to the point where they almost jumped off the ground. It was too unbelievable since joining the clan was so prestigious but Li Qiye had just refused it.

They wanted to persuade him into thinking it over but this was not the time and place for them to interject.

“Sir, your ambition is too great for ordinary people like us to understand.” The manager was disappointed but didn’t force the issue.

Li Qiye smiled and gently waved his sleeve at the other three. They didn’t know what he wanted to talk with the manager about but they still quietly left.

He then looked at the manager and said: “I’m not interested in joining the Jilin Clan. however, I am about the thing that flew into the clan after the sixth expedition.”

“You!” The manager’s expression changed. He instantly took one step back with a terrible flash in his eyes. It was full of murderous intention now.

However, Li Qiye still sat there calmly and said: “Manager, no need for this. The fact that I am here to talk to you means that I can annihilate you, if it wasn’t for your respectful attitude.”

The manager glared at Li Qiye for a long time before taking a deep breath and sitting down again.

He bowed and slowly said: “Sir, this is a top secret. How did you find out about it?”

Even though he wasn’t a direct disciple of the Jilin Clan, he was still an ancestor-level character with a great position. He only knew very little about this matter. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Looks like it’s the truth then, it really happened.” Li Qiye gently sighed with a tinge of sadness after confirming.

“You tricked me just now?” The manager shuddered and said.

Li Qiye shook his head: “No need for that, this is just to confirm my speculation. The clan is trying to recruit people skilled in runes reading, this shows that there is a demand for it. However, these particular runes aren’t of this world, only up above.” He pointed at the sky.

He didn’t say anything else. Nightfall Immortal Monarch had participated in the sixth expedition started by Immortal Emperor Qi Zhen. The result was obvious.

The appearance of these runes wasn’t a good news so Li Qiye lamented in his mind.

“Sir, you are like an immortal in this world in terms of knowledge.” The manager was shocked at this erudite mortal. People would never be able to catch up and sects would love to have him despite his cultivation.

“The clan has it but can’t understand. Nevertheless, they didn’t dare to be too blatant either, so they started this kind of examination.” Li Qiye said.

“We shouldn’t talk about this too much.” The manager hesitated: “This is a top secret of the clan and I know very little about it anyway. If you are interested, why not join the clan? Once you are at a higher position, you will surely be able to see it.”

“I don’t want something that requires waiting.” Li Qiye chuckled and said.

He didn’t have time to wait. The only reason why he agreed with Tieshou Weng was that he needed to go to the clan anyway on top of the guy’s respectful attitude. This was to give a fortune to Sago Palm.

The manager sighed in disappointment. He truly wanted for the clan to recruit this great talent but didn’t dare to force the issue.

Even though Li Qiye was a mortal, he couldn’t see through him so a certain sense of caution was necessary. Plus, as Li Qiye had said, if the guy dared to act so arrogant in this place, it showed that he wasn’t afraid of anyone. Provoking such a person was quite unwise.

The manager personally sent Li Qiye off when he left the shop in a sincere manner. At the same time, he also generously gave three VIP cards to Shen Xiaoshan’s group.

The group was speechless as they were holding the cards and felt that this was a dream. It was a different story whether they could afford to buy the treasures here or not. However, little characters like them weren’t qualified to possess the cards. Only kings and sect masters had this privilege. For example, even the Heavenly Phoenix Crown Prince couldn’t obtain one so he resorted to using his father’s.

Of course, they were aware that the manager did it because of Li Qiye.

“Come, we’ll go Stone Workshop now.” Li Qiye interrupted their stupor.

They regained their mind and quickly followed right behind him. Despite not being able to see through Li Qiye, they were certain that if they could rely on him, this great mountain, it would be truly beneficial.

Stone was the biggest shop for dao materials at the Western Market. There were too many types of materials in great abundance in this place, a favorite location for cultivations.

Everyone wanted to find treasures such as the right type of dao material which could result in a supreme dao fetus.
