Chapter 4353: Heaven Sealing Pentagate

“If you ever see any around, you better run as far away as possible. Of course, it’s futile anyway.” Li Qiye smiled at him.

“Run?” Jinlin didn’t expect this answer: “Shouldn’t I be asking for the immortal to teach me the way?”

Jian Qingzhu, on the other hand, has been contemplating the entire time and didn’t find this as surprising.

True immortals were unreachable existence. Even dao lords had to look up to them.

The truth was that the appearance of one would lead to widespread astonishment and chaos. Every cultivator in the world would run towards this being, hoping to change their fate.

The legend of Blessed Dao Lord was too well known, meeting an immortal and being taught the way. He eventually became the most brilliant dao lord in history.

Who knows if the being he met was an immortal or not? The accuracy wasn’t important, only the fundamental of the story.

Meeting such a being would allow one to ascend like a true dragon, becoming a great historical figure. The temptation of such a meeting was irresistible.

In this case, Li Qiye fully disagreed and told them to run as far away as possible, hence Jinlin’s confusion.

“Say there is an ant trying to climb up your foot, what will you do?” Li Qiye stared at him and asked.

“Stomp it.” He blurted out right away and something flashed in his head. He immediately understood but didn’t like the result.

“We’re the ants.” Qingzhu murmured.

In the eyes of regular cultivators, they had impeccable talents and power. Alas, not to mention the true immortals, even top masters right now viewed them like ants.

Thus, if ants wanted to bother them, they wouldn’t hesitate on stomping down. Therefore, why would a true immortal try to bless those so far beneath them?

The answer was rather obvious - this was just the fantasy of fools.

“That isn’t the worst outcome.” Li Qiye said: “After all, not all wish to stomp down on ants because there might be a colony waiting nearby. They might not wish to kill or burn all the ants since they aren’t that bored.”

“So that’s the case for immortals too?” Weiqiao, who has been silent, asked.

“The answer is that there are no immortals in the mortal world, akin to a fish pond not having a shark.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see.” Weiqiao understood. Sharks were the kings of the sea. Many aquatic creatures eventually became their food. He equated sharks to immortals and realized the implications.

As the three were lost in thoughts, Li Qiye recalled the gates and lamp. He gave the gates to Elder Hu and said: “This treasure can seal heaven for eternity. I shall bestow it to Little Diamond since fate has brought us together.”

“!” Elder Hu couldn’t accept the gates even though it was for the entire sect, not just him.

He clearly saw how powerful the gates were earlier when Li Qiye took down the dark existence.

Not to mention their peers, even the great powers might not have something so wondrous. Li Qiye’s generosity left him stunned.

“Take it, consider it a gift from fate.” Li Qiye casually said.

It took a while for Elder Hu to calm down. He commanded the disciples to kneel. He did the same and prostrated: “We will never forget the kindness and generosity shown today, Sect Master.”

They felt the utmost gratitude for his gift. They knew that it was a supreme treasure but ultimately, they still underestimated its true value.

Chi Jinlin and Jian Qianzhu exchanged glances. Both could see that Li Qiye didn’t have deep ties with Little Diamond. Nonetheless, he still gave them such a precious gift. The two thought that this defensive treasure might be comparable to a dao lord weapon.

Despite their noble status, they couldn’t afford to give such a precious gift to just anyone. Li Qiye seemed to be the sole exception.

“Sir, does it have a name?” Jinlin asked.

“Heaven Sealing Pentagate.” Li Qiye casually responded.

“Heaven Sealing Pentagate.” The two repeated. Just the name alone was a sign of how amazing it was. “Heaven sealing” were not characters to be used frivolously.

“Take this.” Li Qiye then handed the lamp to Wang Weiqiao.

“I…” Wang Weiqiao didn’t dare to accept this offensive treasure despite being Li Qiye’s disciple.

“Master, this is too precious.” He said.

“It’s just a weapon.” Li Qiye responded: “If you ever become accomplished in the future, you will have heavy responsibilities then. Do not let it down since it is special.”

“What responsibilities do you speak of, Master?” He asked, perplexed.

“It’s too early to speak of it right now, once you’re capable enough, you’ll understand even without being told. With great power comes great responsibility.” Li Qiye smiled. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He regained his wits, solemnly accepted the lamp, and bowed deeply: “I won’t forget your words, Master.”

Chi Jinlin and Jian Qingzhu were moved as they watched the bestowal process. Even the blind could tell that these two treasures were exceptional.

As the heir of Lion’s Roar and the saintess of Dragon, they had seen countless treasures before and had some top ones in their possession.

They asked themselves whether they could show the same generosity to their loved ones and closest friends? They would have needed to think carefully due to the level of the treasures.

Alas, Li Qiye showed zero hesitation in doing so as if the two treasures were as common as can be.

There were two potential explanations - Li Qiye either having too many treasures or that he didn’t think much of these two.

Either way, they were shocked because it showed just how extraordinary he was, far above their ancestors.
