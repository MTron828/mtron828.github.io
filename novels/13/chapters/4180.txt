Chapter 4181: Void Dragon

“Boom!” The crystal layers crumbled and a large gap could be seen.

“Clank!” Chen Cangsheng didn’t hold back as his sword energy became magnificent and unstoppable, inches away from piercing through her.

“Void Step!” Her master shouted during this crucial moment.

The princess regained her composure and followed his order. Spatial ripples appeared around her as she performed a movement technique, shifting with extreme speed to the side and gaining the positional advantage.

“Boom!” Cangsheng’s attack pierced through the ground and left behind a large crater. Dust and debris flew everywhere.

“Void Dragon!” The ancestor immediately gave her another pointer.

The princes formed a draconic mudra, gaining control over space and the grand dao. Her wheel artifact spun and gathered space into her palms.

“Die!” She then unleashed the mudra. Dragon roars could be heard as the space around her turned into massive dragons lunging towards her opponent.

“Bring it!” Cangsheng was not afraid in the slightest. He leaped forward with rampaging sword rays and continuous hymns. The technique pulled the momentum of various affinities and combined them together.

“Rumble!” The area shook violently from the exchange.

“Floating Terra!” Void Ancestor commanded as Cangsheng was busy dealing with the draconic attack.

The princess chanted a mantra and created dragons out of the ground beneath Cangsheng, ordering them to attack.

He became pincered by these dragons and reacted by swinging downward, increasing the radius of his sword energies.

“Boom!” He was half a beat late. One earth dragon struck him and sent him flying while vomiting blood.

Void Ancestor was clearly experienced in battle. His guidance allowed the princess to turn the tides.

Cangsheng was seriously wounded after the blow and required a few seconds to regain his balance.

“Void Containment!” The ancestor didn’t want to give him time to rest.

The princess seemed to have a pair of wings with the help of her master. Her eyes flashed brightly like two light wheels. She formed mudras while chanting.

The Void Child Wheel forced the air above Cangsheng to turn into colossal mountains. They dropped straight for him.

He became aghast and raised his sword to block.

“Idiot, stop swinging your sword wildly!” A cold voice echoed: “One Against All!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Chen Cangsheng, who was lost in the heat of battle, immediately changed his style. His rampaging battle intent gathered together onto the sword. He became less crazy and focused on this single attack. It successfully pierced through the princess’ containment and soared for her throat.

“Nothing But Void!” The ancestor was surprised at this development.

She split into a thousand images hiding in the void. It became difficult to find the real her.

“Heaven and Earth Battlefield!” The cold voice guided Cangsheng again.

A middle-aged man appeared on the scene; he was none other than Tie Jian.

“Clank!” Cangsheng couldn’t see Tie Jian since he was preoccupied with fighting. However, he couldn’t help but listen.

This technique turned everything into swords and battle intents. Swords started raining down and destroyed the princess’ images.

“Void Cauldron!” Void Ancestor roared.

The frightened princess became ablaze. The wheel returned to her side and refined space, fusing it with her flames into the shape of a defensive cauldron.

“Heavenbreak!” Tie Jian shouted again.

“You’re going down!” Cangsheng’s morale was at an all-time high. He leaped upward and entered a state of battle zen. The resulting slash was massive, capable of separating everything into two halves.

“Boom!” It struck the cauldron and robbed the world of its light for a split second. The resulting sparks and embers illuminated the area again.

The cauldron was cut down and the princess fell from the sky, smashing into the ground and creating a deep pit. The battle was over with her defeat.

Cangsheng floated in the air and was ecstatic. He wasn’t happy about defeating the princess but rather, the sensation of using the sword dao effectively.

He had studied his sect’s sword dao for a long time but was never able to be so comfortable with the techniques and variations. The same dao today were more effective. The sequences and flow between his attacks were immaculate; his power and vitality also harmonized.

This was his first time performing them in this order but he had no problem at all. His master never taught him this.

He gained a new perspective and a deeper understanding of sword fundamentals in just a few moves.

He calmed down and dispersed his battle state then bowed towards Tie Jian: “I have learned a lot from your guidance, Senior.”

Tie Jian accepted the bow and didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, Cangsheng was perplexed, wondering who Tie Jian was. The guy was too familiar with their sect’s merit laws and techniques. No, “familiar” wasn’t enough to describe his mastery; “perfection” would be more apt.

His master couldn’t have done a better job at teaching him during that battle. Alas, he should be able to recognize the guy as a member of the sect.

He had a good knowledge of all the ancestors, even the reclusive ones. This wasn’t the case right now.

“Who may you be?” Void Ancestor gazed at Tie Jian. [1]

The battle just now was a contest between Void Ancestor and Tie Jian. The former clearly lost.

Void Ancestor knew most of the current masters but drew a blank on Tie Jian.

“My name is not worth mentioning.” Tie Jian said.

Void Ancestor snorted and said: “Daoist Sword Ground is world-renowned, I didn’t know it has hidden rats for members.”

Tie Jian narrowed his eyes after hearing the insult. The sword energy within made everyone shudder.
