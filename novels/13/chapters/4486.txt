Chapter 4487: Grotto Courtyard

“Then what do we do?” The daoist stared at Jian Ming.

“It’s simple, we do something even better, dealing with the dead.” Jian Ming looked around to see if anyone was listening and then whispered.

“Dealing with the dead?” The daoist furrowed his brows.

Jian Ming smiled and continued: “Brother, think about it, you use fortune telling to find treasures. Then what we do is team up, you calculate and find the right tomb, I’m the expert at architecture, keke, tell me how this isn’t profitable.”

The daoist’s eyes lit up. He was aware of Jian Ming’s implication - grave robbing.

What if he were to team up with Jian Ming to focus on the tombs instead of treasures? They could also focus on the tombs of abandoned or destroyed sects.

Countless sects have been destroyed in history. Thus, numerous invincible masters were buried underground. Grabbing the content of these tombs could be quite lucrative.

Alas, there was one problem which he indicated: “Well, it’s a dangerous thing to do, terrible karma.”

“Haha, seeing fortune amidst danger is the way to go. Plus, your divination will help us change our fate.” Jian Ming was relentless.

As the group headed for Grotto Courtyard, these two spoke as if they were brothers despite prior animosity.

People would immediately think of one phrase after seeing this - birds of a feather flock together.

The courtyard was located in a corner of Dark Street. The place was bustling since it might be the largest auction house in Golden City. It received tens of thousands of wealthy customers each day.

Looking at the entrance would surprise first-time visitors. The largest auction didn’t have golden gates and a magnificent appearance.

It had a simple arched door with no decoration, only an old plaque with the characters, Grotto Courtyard.

No one would take another look at a store like this at night. Its appearance stood in stark contrast to its actual reputation and countless customers.

“We’re here.” Jian Ming commented: “Sigh, it’s always so busy.”

Li Qiye looked up and found the characters’ calligraphy to be awfully familiar. There was no signature anywhere on the plaque, only the symbol of a crimson fox. However, due to its age, the red paint has faded to the point of being barely discernible - truly a sad look. Few would even notice the symbol or care.

Li Qiye was an exception since it prompted him to sigh softly. “Grotto Courtyard.”

There was a line for entry. Once it was their turn, Jian Ming greeted the workers and then jumped through the door.

It was dark looking in from the outside. However, everything became bright after entry since it was a gateway to another dimension.

Gentle breezes carried moistness and spirit energy embraced them with haste. They saw a lake with waves and fog with no end in sight.

It turned out that the auction house was built on top of a great lake. There were water pavilions and islands amidst the fogs. Treasures were also displayed on the water, ready for auction.

“Grotto Courtyard has been around so long for a reason, they have their own independent realm. Few great powers have this level of resource.” Jian Ming commented.

This was not his first time visiting the auction house but he was still impressed by their resources each time. Of course, he knew that money alone wasn’t enough.

After all, the world knew of their exceptional treasure and unmatched reputation of being able to satisfy their customers. The merchandise included unique artifacts, merit laws from dao lords, ancient weapons…

Therefore, wealth alone wasn’t enough to protect their business. If this was all they had, they would have been robbed or destroyed long ago.

Upon entering, Li Qiye closed his eyes and enjoyed the moist breeze. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Your four clans and Grotto Courtyard has a strong relationship..” The daoist told Jian Ming.

“What do you mean by that? Our ancestors used to be brothers? Or is there an ongoing alliance? Do we get like twenty, no, forty percent off?” Jian Ming started salivating.

“Nonsense.” Wise elaborated with a smile: “During our prime, we did have an alliance with Grotto Courtyard, no discount though. We helped each other during the Chaotic Era, but the alliance eventually died after our decline.”

“Hmph, so they dropped us once we are no longer useful.” Jian Ming complained: “Just wait, we will rise again and they will want to latch themselves onto our thighs.”

“Pop!” The ancestor slapped his head again and said: “Watch your mouth, Seal Ancestor can hear you here.”

“So what, who doesn’t know that the big octopus’ tentacles are everywhere.” Jian Ming acted as if he wasn’t afraid.

“Your relationship predates the Chaotic Era.” The daoist said: “Long ago, your four clans and the courtyard are under the protection of the same being. Of course, they enjoy a greater level of love. In fact, in terms of seniority, your four clans are little brothers in comparison.” [1]

“Don’t be so vague.” Jian Ming said: “I know that the courtyard isn’t the same as the one in the past, they’re also a bunch of brats that snuck out just like the Yu, not accepted by their own ancestors. Hehe, their ancestors were great cultivators while they seem like money-grubbing merchants.”

“Your four clans aren’t any better, you’re not the main branch either.” The daoist didn’t hold back.

“Haha, not at all, our forefathers are all renowned.” Jian Ming proudly said.
