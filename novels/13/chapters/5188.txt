Chapter 5189: The Young Noble Can Do ItGeett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Gourdkeeper Monarch led the group to a mansion - his personal residence.

The group entered deeper into Alchemy Dao without facing any obstacles because of the monarch. After all, he was the third-ranked member of the sect, only beneath Jadecure Conqueror and Panacea Monarch.

“Geezer, come out, I brought a big shot here for you.” He was particularly excited as he entered the backyard filled with precious medicines and springs.

There was a fire vein for pill refinement as well. An old man sat there, wearing a robe made of coarse cloth.

There were two horn-like protrusions on his head, a bit similar to deer antlers but they were smaller and forked.

When he opened his eyes, darkness enveloped and only allowed room for starlight. It became difficult to discern the directions afterward.

He had the aura of a dragon lord accentuated with a bestial presence. Just one roar from him could break the earth.

“Which big shot?” He stood up and asked.

The monarch introduced Li Qiye and said: “This young brother right here, he has a unique view on alchemy so I took him here to solve your problem.”

“And here I thought you had invited Jadecure Conqueror.” The old man stared at the duo.

“Our sect master is not here right now.” The monarch shook his head and confidently said: “Trust me, he can solve it.”

The old man remained skeptical and stared at Li Qiye, only to not notice anything peculiar. However, his eyes changed the moment he saw the bear.

“...” He was a brilliant cultivator and could see that this bear was immensely strong.

His astonishment grew when he saw the old servant standing behind Li Qiye. This old man was clearly even more special than the bear. Alas, he failed to pinpoint their origin.

“Come, let me introduce you. He is Resplendent Monarch from Qilin Manor.” Gourdkeeper said.

This was the strongest ancient ancestor from Qilin Manor - a major lineage in the upper continents founded by two beings - Peerless Monarch and Immortal Emperor Qilin.

After Grand Dao War, City Lord Zi Yan and Heavenly Sage Yuan disappeared from the world. Peerless Monarch became the next lord of the city before giving the position to Imperial Gate and passing away from old age.

It was a major contributor to the city’s success, not inferior to Dao Alchemy, Imperial Gate, and Iron Tree.

Resplendent Monarch possessed an amazing formation that had trapped top cultivators such as conquerors before.

He glanced at Li Qiye and then at the old man in blue before asking the latter: “May I ask where you are from?”

The old man didn’t answer and simply posed there like a loyal servant. Resplendent found this rather strange - the old man seemed to be stronger than the ordinary youth. Why was he subservient to him?

Li Qiye took a seat first without waiting for an invitation.

“Geezer, take out your thing, let Young Noble Li take a look.” Gourdkeeper didn’t care for trivial matters and said enthusiastically.

“I came to Alchemy Dao seeking your help, now you want to throw it to someone else.” Resplendent seemed annoyed.

“No, I couldn’t solve it so I found young Noble Li for you, I’m trying my best here.” Gourdkeeper said.

“You should have at least invited Brother Panacea or Jadecure Conqueror.” Resplendent complained.

“I never said I would help.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Young Noble, please don’t be offended.” Gourdkeeper said: “You might actually find this interesting.”

Having said that, he winked at Resplendent and said: “What are you waiting for? Take it out.”

“It’s not that I don’t want to, you know how serious this matter is.” Resplendent apologized and bowed to Li Qiye.

“Suppression won’t know, I trust Young Noble Li.” Gourdkeeper said.

“We cannot be so careless when this pertains to the future of Imperial Attendant.” Resplendent became serious.

Gourdkeeper’s expression changed as well.

“I trust in the young noble, and so does Hallowedsteel Ancestor.” Shao Yao finally spoke.

“What about that old man?” Resplendent stared at Shao Yao.

Shao Yao hesitated and didn’t reveal the event she saw. She responded: “I’m aware of what’s going on right now in Imperial Attendant, and I respectfully think that the young noble can be in charge later.”

“Girl, watch your words.” Gourdkeeper said.

“I am not shooting without aim.” She said firmly.

“He’s not from one of our lineages, it’s not possible.” Resplendent said.

“If he agrees, this will end Hundred Dao’s attempt at taking over. Imperial Attendant will return to the orthodox path.” Shao Yao felt as if she could see the future.

“Though we don’t like Suppression, Hundred Dao had done plenty to protect the city during Imperial War.” Resplendent shook his head.

“Excuse my lack of knowledge, but may I ask how the ancestors are planning to end Suppression Conqueror’s authority?” Shao Yao believed that Li Qiye was the chosen one, not only for her own life but also the city. She had absolute confidence in this belief.

“Old geezer, it’s not easy. Nothing has changed with you so you’ll lose for sure. No one from Imperial Gate or Iron Tree can stop Suppression.” Gourdkeeper said.

“Jadecure has a chance to win with alchemy if we follow the ancestral guidance.” Resplendent said.

“Still missing a little something.” Gourdkeeper disagreed: “Time is running out, we can afford to take risks.”
