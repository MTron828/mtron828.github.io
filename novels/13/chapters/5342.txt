Chapter 5343: No Weaklings Among Reincarnation Dao

“We’ve touched on how difficult it is to kill Illumination Conqueror.” Zhitian interjected.

“I am willing to shoulder the infamy for killing Illumination. The problem is that even if the two of us join forces, we might still lose to him, and remember, he’s not alone.” Timewatcher told Hallowed: “It has to be All-things or Sword Queen.”

“Sword Queen won’t get involved in Dao Alliance’s mess.” Hallowed shook his head: “All-things can’t do it either because if he kills Illumiation, he won’t be able to stay as the leader of Dao Alliance. The dragon lords and conquerors native to the six continents will not trust him anymore.”

“You’re right.” Timewatcher admitted.

All-things came from Eight Desolaces while Dao Alliance was started by Illumination Conqueror. Thus, it wasn’t easy for All-things to become the guardian of Dao Alliance. He certainly didn’t have all of the upper echelon’s support.

A small number of those native to the six continents still viewed him as an outsider and certainly wouldn’t support an expedition against Illumination Conqueror.

Therefore, his supporters would primarily consist of those from Eight Desolaces - Skysword Dao Lord, Myriad Eye Dao Lord, Rumination Dao Lord…

Breaking the uncomfortable balance could be detrimental to All-things. He might actually end up losing his position because Illumination was viewed as a hero by many.

If All-things were to kill Illumination, he would become vilified and face enemies from all directions. In fact, some might wonder if he was a hound of Celestial Court.

Therefore, despite knowing that he must get rid of Illumination first before dealing with Supreme, he was still shackled by the circumstances.

“Let’s go get Darkfrost to fight Illumination alone while we take care of the others. Once we’re done, we’ll take Illumination down.” Timewatcher enthusiastically suggested.

“Darkfrost might not want to join this mess.” Hallowed shook his head.

Top cultivators certainly cared about their reputation and legacy. Killing Illumination might negatively impact both.

“There is another way. Remove the shackles of your bloodline and replenish your vitality. As long as you do so, you will be able to obtain anima and kill Illumination.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“That might take way too long.” Hallowed smiled wryly.

Hallowed was extraordinarily gifted during his youth but was limited by his cursed bloodline. Although he overcame this to an extent, it still affected him.

Moreover, his valiant effort at suppressing a forbidden zone left him near death. The injuries and negative side effects still remained.

“Big Bro, it is not too late for you to reach the apex. I don’t have a chance at all, given my crappy cultivation, so I need you to pick up my slack and give me orders.” Timewatcher said.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye smiled at him.

“I’m afraid my talent and dao are just mediocre. I cannot reach the apex.” Timewatcher humbly smiled.

Zhitian wanted to laugh because this wasn’t true at all. Timewatcher was a renowned conqueror - a far cry from having “mediocre talent and dao”.

“Your Reincarnation branch isn’t weak at all. Your problem is a lack of determination and an inability to endure boredom. Otherwise, you have a chance of obtaining anima.” Li Qiye said.

“Sigh, I’ve cultivated enough my entire life. If I have to keep on training, a million years will pass by in a meaningless manner, no different from being tortured eternally.” Timewatcher said.

“True, it is not for everyone.” Li Qiye had no problem with this response.

“When alive, what we should do is to actually live. That’s what I am doing right now, enjoying every day while trying to ignore everything else.” Timewatcher responded.

Zhitian was very interested in this perspective. Timewatcher might be the least ambitious conqueror he had met before.

Becoming an apex cultivator required determination and ambition. After reaching this realm, they would try to obtain anima. This didn’t seem to be the case for Timewatcher.

“All I need you to do is watch Xiao Hu.” Hallowed asked again.

“Big Bro, how about this, I go kill Supreme and you take care of Xiao Hu?” Timewatcher really didn’t want to be a babysitter.

“Unacceptable.” Hallowed insisted.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a tsunami of power erupted, seemingly wanting to destroy the entire grotto.

“Which asshole is this? Show yourself!” Timewatcher stabilized the grotto, causing it to be radiant.

“Clank!” A gigantic sword manifested into reality and pinned itself on the grotto.

An impressive figure appeared while sword hymns resonated loudly. Behind him was an ocean of swords.

“Immortal Emperor Xu Kong!” Zhitian shouted.

“Bastard.” Timewatcher gazed intensely at the unwelcomed visitor who released all twelve heaven’s wills and their suffocating pressure.

In theory, his title should include the word “Heaven Emperor” and not Immortal Emperor. However, he respected his master and the nine worlds, resulting in a different title classification despite being a heavener from the thirteen continents.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had nine wills in the previous epoch but eventually obtained three more. His master was none other than Immortal Emperor Hao Hai - an influential leader of Celestial Court.

In theory, he could have ascended to the immortal continent but he chose to stay to help govern Heaven Alliance instead.

“Rumble!” Eight or so conquerors appeared behind him, ready to capture Timewatcher’s grotto.

“Bringing out the big boys, I see.” Timewatcher’s eyes flashed brightly.
