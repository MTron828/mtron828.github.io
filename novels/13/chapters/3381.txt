“Clank!” Suoweng raised his sword and the entire world seemed to be contained in its tip. Everyone felt their own lives being decided by the incoming slash.

It wasn’t a pretty technique but this didn’t diminish its effectiveness and potential for destruction.

One slash - total destruction. This was the feeling everyone got from Suoweng’s hand movement.

“South Conch Sword Art!” They thought that this was a master performing a work of art. The profundity of the sword dao was in full display here from his meticulous touch.

His sword art was known to be the best in the northern West King but few had the privilege to see it in person until now. It didn’t let them down in the slightest.

On the other hand, Three Truths Sect Master wasn’t surprised to see this impeccable swordplay. He leaped to the sky while letting out a roar. The three lotuses followed right behind him.

“Boom!” They rotated positions and created chaos in the grand dao along with the yin and yang. This created a pair of yin yang fish, looking magnificent and profound.

As people stared at the fish, they suddenly became dizzy as if the world around them was spinning uncontrollably.

“Boom!” The fish swept through an area of three thousand miles and created a frightening black hole.

This made the spectator take a deep breath. Yin and yang were usually in harmony but these fish created a frightening power as they struck the sword technique. The fiery sparks were immensely destructive.

This wasn’t the end of this chain. Three Truths Sect Master crossed through the realms and instantly appeared before Suoweng, swinging his scepter downward.

This particular weapon would be ineffective when used by someone else. However, this wasn’t the case here.

“Crack!” Space cracked like an egg. The cracks emanated towards Suoweng. He would fall victim to the spatial cracks and shatter into pieces.

Suoweng pulled his sword back for defensive purposes with a speed surpassing the temporal limit, successfully stopping the fatal blow.

“Boom!” The grand dao seemed to be crumbling. Everyone felt a painful blow on their chest as if it had just been penetrated. Some couldn’t help but scream.

The two exchanged another blow, just as devastating as the previous. Both of them staggered several steps backward, feeling their energy churning inside their chest.

Everyone could see that they were evenly matched. No one had the upper hand.

They have fought numerous times in the past so they knew each other quite well. It would take a while for the outcome to be clear.

“Return.” The sect master leaped backward after the failed attack, the lotus flowers with him.

Suoweng immediately went on the offensive with a vertical slash, unleashing a sky-incinerating flame. His targets were the three lotus flowers.

“Rumble!” The battle between the two escalated. The sun and moon became dimmed as a result; everything else was overshadowed.

They virtually stole everyone’s attention. Of course, this was also the most dangerous one. Just one remnant shockwave had plenty of destructive potentials. Moreover, it might determine the fate of their sect.

“Similar dao lord weapons, high heaven merit laws, equal cultivation. So evenly matched. It’s hard to find an opponent like this.” A neutral elder commented.

Because of this, they got to go all out and showed everything they have learned through the dao.

“Seems like it’s my turn.” Xu Nan who has been observing smiled and walked towards the ancestral peak, aware of the other side.

“Hmm, who will be able to stop him?” One spectator wondered.

“Who can stop him when he’s at the sacred level?” Another elder added.

The crowd thought that this person should definitely be able to break the barriers of Divine Black.

With that, Divine Black would lose its advantage. Zhang Yue’s group would lose without the help of their grand formation.

“Stop, Fellow Daoist.” One person blocked his path. He had countless hands just like Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“The bodhi king!” Many experts recognized him.

He was one of the oldest members in Divine Black and has been in charge of Thousand Demons Peak for a long time.

“Thousand Hands Bodhi King, I’m afraid you can’t stop me.” The saber master’s eyes narrowed.

“Have to try and see.” The bodhi king’s majestic life force bloomed. The area around him became an endless forest. A green radiance soared to the sky and exuded bright particles around the sect.

“Buzz.” A chaos expanse came next with a grand dao slowly flying outward. It gave birth to a divine tree.

Dao laws poured down from this creation and the bodhi king exuded the aura of a sacred cultivator.

“Grand Dao Sacred Physique!” Not to mention the outsiders, even the members of Divine Black found this astonishing.

“The bodhi king has reached the sacred level!” One member cried out.

“Since when? He should be in the myriad-form realm.” An expert who knew the king murmured.

“He hid it too well.” Others praised him after realizing his true power.

“Yes! We can do this!” The disciples of Divine Black cheered.

This revelation greatly boosted the sect’s morale. All along, they thought that they only had one person at the sacred level - Ping Suoweng. The bodhi king managed to surprise them.

“Seems like I was careless. This is surprising indeed.” Xu Nan regained his wits and nodded while looking at the king.
