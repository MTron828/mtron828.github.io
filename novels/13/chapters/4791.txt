Chapter 4792: Heavenly Injuries

The crowd took longer to calm down compared to the epoch lords. Some of them only woke up just now.

They saw a bloodied Li Qiye before looking for Tian Tu. The latter was on one knee down in a caved depression.

No wounds were visible but he was still covered in blood.

“A complete defeat.” One ancestor said softly.

Experts and ancestors saw the event clearly. Although Li Qiye was also bloodied, his wounds were caused by the tribulation, not Tian Tu’s My Dao. On the other hand, Tian Tu was struck by Li Qiye’s punch.

Li Qiye sat down on the ground and closed his eyes, focusing on healing his wounds.

“I am enlightened after seeing your punch, Sir. Thank you for showing mercy.” Tian Tu’s mind returned as he spoke.

“It was far more challenging sparing you than killing you.” Li Qiye answered.

“Yes, recalling that ultimate strike must have been difficult. I can’t even come close.” Tian Tu said.

Listeners exchanged glances. More often than not, killing an opponent was easier than the alternative.

To kill someone like Tian Tu required an attack of utmost power. Nonetheless, Li Qiye decided to pull back instead of reducing him to dust.

That was only one part of the event. Kept in mind that he was under assault from the tribulation as well, adding to the complication.

Thus, negating a punch capable of destroying the world was far harder than dishing one out.

“Tian Tu lost.” The look in Dao Sanqian’s eyes changed.

He saw the lightning bolts earlier and thought that he would die in that tribulation. However, Li Qiye used his body to withstand it while still controlling his technique.

He shuddered and thought that this man was infinitely close to becoming a true immortal.

“Return from whence you came, you are spared.” Li Qiye said without opening his eyes.

“Sir, thank you for fulfilling my wish, I truly appreciate it.” Tian Tu bowed deeply before disappearing into the horizon.

He arrived fast and left just as quickly without saying goodbye to his fellow sect members.

Of course, Specter Monarch was used to his lone-wolf style. This has been the case even back when their teacher was around.

“What now?” All eyes were back on Li Qiye who stopped moving.

The hidden overlords paid careful attention to the details.

“Are the wounds grievous?” One of them communicated.

“He took the full brunt of a grand tribulation. If he’s actually uninjured, then I think he can kill that damned heaven. It doesn’t matter how strong he is, he’s clearly wounded. Even a true immortal couldn’t have come out unscathed.” An abyssal lord speculated.

These beings were all too familiar with the devastating tribulations from the high heaven. A heavy price must be paid for surviving one. 

None of them would have taken one directly and preferred to use other evasive methods.

“The injuries are real.” An ancient existence in Desolate Wild speculated.

In a boundless void, a monstrous creature stared at him and said: “There have to be injuries to his dao, no way of recovering in a short time.”

A particular idea flashed in their mind after seeing Li Qiye’s injuries. Keep in mind that they held nothing but the highest evaluation for Li Qiye. However, this was still a grand tribulation.

The question was - how serious were the wounds?

For some of them, the recovery time took epochs. In fact, they still haven’t fully recovered and were barely holding on.

These injuries absolutely affected his fighting potential - they thought.

Back to the scene, top ancestors also pondered this issue since Li Qiye didn’t seem capable of moving.

Even a fool could tell that he might be immobilized by the damages.

“From what I know, wounds caused by the heaven are permanent and will be fatal in time.” Specter Monarch whispered.

He had heard of legends regarding top existences dying to tribulations before. Moreover, since Li Qiye took lightning bolts directly, his injuries should be worse than others.

Nonetheless, confirming this was rather difficult.

“Mmm…” Dao Sanqian scanned Li Qiye.

“What do you think?” Cosmic Lord asked Six-dao Monarch.

Six-dao shook his head and said: “I can’t be certain but they look serious. In history, few manage to survive these heavenly injuries. They might not die on the spot but these injuries will be the cause of death. Maybe not today, not in one thousand years, but it is inevitable.”

“I see.” Cosmic Lord’s expression changed.

The best time to kick a horse was when it’s down - everyone understood this logic.

Under normal circumstances, they knew that Li Qiye could kill all of them with a single hand wave. It was impossible to ever beat him, let alone kill him.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

But now, he seemed stricken with heavenly injuries. Wouldn’t this be the best chance to kill him and make a name for themselves?

The overlords from various locations thought about the possibilities. They didn’t care about defeating Li Qiye in terms of fame. This was rather meaningless.

However, he was an eternal existence just like them with a wondrous amount of vitality on top of being the current epoch lord.

He was in his prime state, meaning that his flesh and blood contained countless dao essence and power.

If they could somehow feast on him, they would regain their vitality and energy again. In fact, it might even heal their heavenly injuries.
