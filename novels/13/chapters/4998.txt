Chapter 4999: A Boy

Goldcrest, Yunyun, and Ming Shi stared at this scene in a daze.

They were worrying about Lil’ Freckle’s safety when she was surrounded by three demon monarchs. [1]

Because of her quiet demeanor back in the academy, everyone thought that she was from a small sect or that she had been traumatized in the past.

They didn’t expect to see her sitting on top of an imperious demon monarch. Chillglare Hawk was one tier below the commanding gods in Demon. No one here was qualified to sit on its back yet it gave her permission to do so.

She waved at Li Qiye’s group to bid goodbye. The hawk also bowed and spoke: “May we meet again.”

The hawk screeched and flapped its wings, releasing strong gales. It leaped into the air and disappeared into the horizon.

The group calmed down and Yunyun said: “I didn’t expect Lil’ Freckle to be from the mountains too.”

“It’s more than that, I think her background should be something special.” Ming Shi said.

It became clear that Chillglare Hawk came specifically to find her, not for the god source.

“Rooster, isn’t this your territory? How did you not know? Or did you already know and just didn’t tell us.” She asked Goldcrest and pulled up her sleeves menacingly.

“Come on, I’m innocent.” He protested: “I’ve never seen her here before, I don’t think anyone else knew this either.”

Having said that, he recalled something with Li Qiye. Lil’ Freckle had greeted Li Qiye before - something she had never done, at least to their knowledge.

“Don’t look at me, I didn’t know either.” Li Qiye shrugged with a smile.

“If Lil’ Freckle is from here, she probably is worshipping a deity, right? How did she leave?” Yunyun became curious and waited for an answer from Goldcrest.

“As far as I know, there is only one badge like mine. I would have known if she has one too.” He shook his head.

“It’s because of her unique divinity, it’s rather pure.” Li Qiye revealed.

“Her divinity?” Goldcrest started pondering.

“Which demon is she? A sparrow?” Ming Shi’s eyes lit up as she said.

“A sparrow riding Chillglare Hawk, I don’t think so. It would eat her right away.” Goldcrest responded.

This was indeed the truth. That notorious hawk had eaten three dragon lords before, let alone a little sparrow.

“Let’s go, we’ll know when it’s time to know.” Li Qiye smiled and started walking. The group followed him right away.

Along the way, Goldcrest couldn’t help but ask: “Young Noble, what was your marvelous technique during that battle?”

Having said that, he imitated Li Qiye’s hand movement during the crushing of the heavenly wheel.

That event shocked them to the core. Halo Monarch’s Heaven Wheel was one of the hardest things to break at that level. Therefore, they assumed that Li Qiye was using an equally incredible technique - one for the ages.

“Marvelous technique? I only grabbed it.” Li Qiye said nonchalantly.

“...” The youth didn’t know how to answer.

If this answer came from anyone else, they wouldn’t have believed it. Alas, they trusted Li Qiye and this surprised them even more.

He paid no mind to their astounded and confused expression, still marching onward.

They didn’t get far because suddenly, someone jumped down from a vine hanging on a tree branch and startled the young ones.

“Watch out!” Ming Shi immediately hid behind Li Qiye after seeing the person.

It turned out to be a familiar child. He wore a golden robe, looking overly pale as if he rarely came outside. His expression looked a bit slow and clumsy like a lord's idiotic son, just missing the snot. [2]

“Flame-eater Child!” Yunyun shouted.

This innocent-looking child was actually a dragon lord with three fruits - something that had driven cultivators crazy with jealousy before. They trained hard for a lifetime and never got anywhere near his level.

Nonetheless, it wasn’t surprising to see him here since he was Wild Dragon’s follower.

“What do you want?” Ming Shi asked.

He ignored Ming Shi and walked to Li Qiye’s front, taking out a resplendent item.

“A god source!” Goldcrest shouted.

“You want to give it to the young noble?” Yunyun was astonished.

After all, Li Qiye was once the king of Eight-stallion Dynasty - clearly an enemy of Wild Dynasty. Flame-eater Child had come looking for trouble during his coronation.
