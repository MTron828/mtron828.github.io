Chapter 4159: Dark Gale Camp

Few had the privilege of visiting Dark Gale Camp. Its true main branch wasn’t on an island but took up an entire region.

Visitors would see a massive mountain blocking everyone’s path and resembling a barrier. It was located right in the middle of Dark Gale Camp and Cloud Dream Lake.

In a sense, the lake served as a moat. This along with the mountain made it difficult for others to attack the camp.

Waterfalls could be seen; their currents flowed down like rivers of stars. This magnificent scene exuded a transcending feeling. Verdant trees and lush vegetation made the air refreshing and comforting. This didn’t look like a lair of bandits in the slightest.

Most assumed that there would be camps and outposts everywhere. Black banners should be seen up high with sentries on patrol - a place of fierce and rowdy characters.

This wasn’t the case at all. People would mistake this place for the ancestral ground of an important sect. Its majestic aura and scenic beauty were enviable.

Li Qiye got down the chariot and found himself standing on a high peak. He took a deep breath of the refreshing air.

“This is all the reception I get?” Li Qiye stood at the edge and looked down at the world with a smile. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Anyone else in this situation would be trembling with fear. After all, this was a place filled with hidden masters including a mighty ancestor like Nightloom.

None of this mattered to Li Qiye; he was still as nonchalant and relaxed as ever.

“This junior is under the order of the Forefather.” Nightloom prostrated and spoke humbly. [1]

Cloud Dream King and the others also prostrated, not daring to breathe loudly.

“Forefather?” Li Qiye said.

“The Forefather is a supreme being capable of reaching the high heaven.” Nightloom responded with haste.

“You’re not a descendant of the dragons. No bloodline.” Li Qiye shook his head.

Nightloom looked a bit awkward as he coughed and said: “We are not descendants of the Forefather. I simply got lucky and was taught briefly by the Forefather, hence my current abilities.”

“Mmm, true. Looks like the old man put some effort into you, it’s a shame that this is all you have learned.” Li Qiye nodded.

Anyone else would think that this was an insult. Nightloom was only second to the Five Overlords right now yet Li Qiye found him inadequate.

Nonetheless, Nightloom didn’t become angry. Embarrassment struck instead as he answered: “The Forefather said that I lack comprehension and can only learn to a superficial level. Please guide me, Young Noble.”

“There’s nothing I can teach you.” Li Qiye shook his head: “The old man has reached an incredible stage. Only a selected few in all of history had surpassed him. He taught you well yet you stopped here, this is your limit.”

“I am ashamed of failing to live up to expectations.” Nightloom said.

In the eyes of regular cultivators, he stood at the apex. However, since he had contact with his master, he realized how insignificant he was.

His master was a true supreme existence that could take on anyone. Unfortunately, he had limited talent and comprehension.

If he had understood his master’s teachings, the Five Overlords wouldn’t be worth mentioning in his presence.

“It’s alright. I do feel at ease knowing that he is still alive. Let me meet him.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“This way, Young Noble.” Nightloom immediately led the way.

They walked to a courtyard in a remote region. Only Nightloom and Cloud Dream King had access. Inside was a sealed well.

The well was ancient with inscrutable runes. One shouldn’t even try deciphering them since it would only be a waste of time. There was still water inside.

Normally, even the top cultivators would find opening this seal difficult. Nightloom knew the secret so he didn’t have a problem.

After he fully pushed the cover open, a cold air shot upward. An eternity seemed to have been sealed inside this well.

“Come out to see an old friend.” Li Qiye glanced down and said.

“Splash!” A rainbow fish flew out of the well, looking rather gorgeous due to all of its colors. It let out a bubble reflecting similar colors from the sunlight.

Li Qiye smiled and got on top of the fish. It continued releasing more bubbles and the two disappeared from sight in an illusory manner.

“Ancestor, when can I meet the Forefather?” Cloud Dream King asked after Li Qiye was gone.

His knowledge of the Forefather was strictly limited to what Nightloom told him, that the Forefather was the reason why Cloud Dream Lake was untouchable across the years. Even the dao lords didn’t wish to challenge him.

“When you are summoned.” Nightloom said. He was the only one lucky enough to receive guidance from the Forefather.

He had no idea what was going on, not daring to speculate the Forefather’s intent nor could he see the world beyond.

Clouds and mists filled this separate domain. It looked surreal just like an illusion or a dream. Unfortunately, it seemed abandoned and devoid of life.

However, if they could get past all of this and see the core of this world, they would find a vein serving as the heart, empowering everything here.

An old pavilion existed somewhere in this area. Alas, it was in terrible shape. Just a minor storm should be able to take it down.

Appearance was deceiving in this case. The pavilion had withstood numerous years and tribulations.

There were two aged deck chairs; one was prepared for Li Qiye. It creaked when he sat down, looking awfully unstable.

He relaxed and enjoyed the breeze. Millions of years seemed to pass in the blink of an eye.

. This is the character usually used for Ancestor. Progenitor/ancestor/forefather/primogenitor, anything like that works here. Forefather is the least assuming and probably fits the best without further context ?
