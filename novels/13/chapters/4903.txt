Chapter 4904: Solitary Journey

Li Qiye found a wild animal and roasted it with the bonfire until it was golden and salivatingly fragrant.

Bloodsea Blade didn’t hold back and sat down. He tore some meat off and started eating as if it was his meal.

Li Qiye cut a piece and gave it to Yunyun. He picked half a thigh for himself.

Bloodsea finished his large piece and still wasn’t satisfied. He grabbed another piece from Li Qiye and continued.

Yunyun ate and stared at the flames, occasionally stealing glances at Bloodsea.

He ranked fifth among the Ten Monsters and was feared by all. Thus, she didn’t know how to feel being in his presence.

He didn’t have a murderous aura right now, unlike when he held his saber. He looked no different from an old man appreciating a well-cooked meal.

This was the time to show appreciation so she bowed and said: “Thank you for saving us, Senior.”

He ignored her and continued eating. The three of them feasted and only bones were left in no time at all.

“Why are you here?” He then asked Li Qiye because he saw Li Qiye with the imperial seal back in Eight-stallion.

He didn’t know about subsequent events since he couldn’t care less about the dynasty.

“Why not?” Li Qiye smiled.

Yunyun became nervous because she didn’t know their relationship, wondering if Bloodsea might kill her after finding out about the kidnapping.

Bloodsea couldn’t believe a junior was talking to him like this. Youths were usually pale after hearing his title, let alone sitting so close to him.

“Don’t you want to be a king?” Bloodsea asked.

“What’s the point of ruling a declining dynasty? I’ve quitted.” Li Qiye waved his hand, once again surprising the old man.

Bloodsea noticed that the imperial seal was no longer there, meaning that there was someone else in charge now.

Sure, Eight-stallion no longer had the dao lord but Venerable Dragon God was still around. They couldn’t be underestimated.

Not to mention this youth, even big shots and famous cultivators would die over the throne of Eight-stallion. No one could resist this temptation.

Jian Yunyun smiled wryly after hearing this. Eight-stallion was on the rise again yet Li Qiye called it a “declining dynasty”. Venerable Dragon God and the others might go crazy after hearing this.

“Why did Eight-stallion Dao Lord pass the throne down to you?” Bloodsea seemed curious and didn’t mind speaking more than usual.

Back during the escort mission, he focused on the coffin alone, nothing else. Now, the whole ordeal was indeed strange.

Of course, he didn’t think that Li Qiye was an illegitimate son. He could see that there was no blood relation here.

“It’s because I’m handsome, I’m sure.” Li Qiye smiled.

Bloodsea’s eyes full of contempt said it all. How shameless for this man to be boasting about his appearance.

Yunyun, on the other hand, didn’t want to laugh and hurt Li Qiye’s feelings.

“Senior, I have seen your saber marks back at the academy. I didn’t understand much though.” She changed the topic.

“You’re a student?” Bloodsea’s cold expression loosened a bit. Perhaps bringing the academy up reminded him of some memories, pleasant or otherwise.

“I’m still studying. I was fortunate enough to be given permission to study your marks.” She said.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Though he was one of the Ten Monsters, Bloodsea had studied at the academy before. He was brutal against others but the academy held a special spot in his heart. Therefore, he also took it easy on Yunyun after finding out.

“You’re not a saber user, it’s understandable.” Bloodsea said, not wanting to teach.

“Senior, why do you prefer to travel alone?” She asked.

He didn’t join any great power or mingled with anyone in the past. This wouldn’t be surprising for a weak cultivator. However, someone as strong as him was welcomed everywhere. Alas, the only friend he wanted was his saber.

“This is part of the grand dao, a solitary journey.” Li Qiye smiled: “The longer the journey, the more ruthless the dao is. There is nothing but loneliness at the end of the path.”

Bloodsea was impressed that a junior was able to discern this sad truth.

“A solitary journey.” Yunyun repeated and thought about this issue. In her case, no one was able to help her after Grandma’s passing; she was also alone.

“What are you seeking with the dao?” Li Qiye asked.

“No returning after seeing my blade.” He answered after becoming slightly interested in Li Qiye.

He resembled an ordinary mortal right now yet the comment painted a carnage for Yunyun. She envisioned a slash capable of massacring an army in the blink of an eye.
