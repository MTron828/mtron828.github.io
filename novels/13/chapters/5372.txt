Chapter 5373: From The Same Branch

Li Qiye stepped into the battlefield; Li Xian’er also wanted to follow but thought against it.

First, the lightning bolts were dangerous and she would only be holding him back.

Sure enough, he was immediately greeted by frenzied bolts but a silvery glow around him stopped them.

He looked up and saw a crack in the sky vault - the source of the lightning bolts. It was as if this crack was a way to reach the end of the world. Alas, it was too insignificant; one couldn’t see the high heaven or actually journey through it.

As he delved deeper into the battlefield, he saw that its general shape was akin to a massive basin.

Everything was crushed down into suds including time and space. The yin and yang and the other cycles ceased to exist, only chaos was left behind.

One could still sense remnants of the various affinities within the suds. The chaos that loomed within them was frightening beyond words.

He could sense evil and curses along with despair. Someone powerful had swept through this entire battlefield and eradicated the evil entities here.

It seemed that in their last moment, they decided to fuse together and activate the vilest curse - a last-ditch explosion to destroy the enemy.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Li Qiye went to the center of the basin and sat down to take a careful look. This was the only place that was relatively flattened and intact compared to the nearby destruction.

It seemed that in the throes of ultimate destruction, this place withstood the bombardments. The chaos affinities were blocked and did not drag it into the abyss as well.

The impressions and marks left behind became solid, potentially the hardest substance in this world.

Li Qiye took his time tracing over them and noticed the numerous marks. He closed his eyes and saw a large figure resembling an egg or a rock. Although everything around it was blown to smithereens, it remained intact.

“The old geezer was right.” Li Qiye murmured: “He found it, one out of three.”

He pulled his hand and lost connection with the image of the egg. Something else drew his attention - a pair of shallow footprints that was nearly imperceptible.

Someone had stood here and performed the same analysis as him.

He released light onto the footprints and time started reversing. Particles manifested and a figure appeared.

However, since time had been destroyed in this place, the figure pulsed feebly like a candle in the wind. Nonetheless, it looked like an immortal with an aura surpassing three thousand worlds. It only persisted for a second before disappearing.

Li Qiye knew who it was just from the blurry silhouette and said: “From the same branch yet entirely different.”

He looked up to gaze at the distant horizon, attempting to go back to the moment when everything started. He saw everything before his eyes - a battle resulting in total annihilation.

The combatant wished to change the world entirely, not leaving a single vestige of the past. The new world would be formed under his mold. Alas, this was easier said than done.  Breaking the world and toppling the great tree was part of the process. He could then remove the past and pass on his own grand dao. Unfortunately, he couldn’t break the tree in this epoch. The marks of the predecessor were present in every inch of the land. In order to actually accomplish his goal, he would need to obliterate all physical planes and living beings.

“So I’m the predecessor.” Li Qiye smiled while watching the reconstruction of the past.

A long time ago in a wondrous land where creatures below the heaven could live in peace and prosperity, one person rose out of nowhere and aimed to establish a new set of rules, erasing the previous worldly regulations.

His revolution was earth-shattering but the predecessor had taken roots deep in space and time. As long as this predecessor was still alive, this world would never be his. To force the issue meant wreaking unnecessary destruction.
