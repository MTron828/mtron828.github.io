Chapter 4871: Great Idea

“So who is this treacherous mastermind wanting to kill me?” Li Qiye was furious.

“Your Highness, Civic Deputy will never let anything happen to you even if it costs him everything.” One of the two beauties said.

“Your Highness, who do you think it is?” Monochromatic whispered in Li Qiye’s ear.

“We will kill whoever it is!” Li Qiye bellowed.

“Who has the most to gain with your death, Your Highness?” Monochromatic whispered.

“That geezer Venerable Dragon God!” Li Qiye said hatefully.

“That’s right, Your Highness. Everyone in the dynasty cares about him alone.” Monochromatic said.

“We must kill him then.” Li Qiye gritted his teeth.

“I’m afraid it won’t be easy.” Monochromatic said quietly: “He has five dao fruits so even if I risk my life, I still can’t touch him. In fact, I cannot protect you from him right now.”

“So there is nothing we can do?” Li Qiye became pessimistic.

“Your Highness, don’t be discouraged. I’m sure Civic Deputy will have a wise plan.” One beauty said while bringing a cup to his mouth.

“Civic Deputy, is there a way?” Li Qiye asked.

“There is…” He said before falling into silence.

“Speak!” Li Qiye seemed impatient.

“We stand no chance given our power since he alone can obliterate us, not to mention his legion. In reality, the dynasty is also under his control.” Monochromatic elaborated.

“I see…” Li Qiye didn’t want to resign to losing.

“But, we can obtain external help.” Monochromatic stroked his chin.

“External help?” Li Qiye asked.

“We can enlist the help of experts to kill the traitors.” Monochromatic lowered his voice.

“Who?” Li Qiye asked again.

“I know several of the Ten Monsters. I’m close with Corpsepoison Toad King and Fire Ape so I can invite them. The problem is the payment afterward.”

“That’s fine, when we get this done, you will have full authority to grant them titles and rewards.” Li Qiye laughed and generously said.

“They’re still not enough to take him down, I have another plan.” Monochromatic said.

“Go on.” Li Qiye became spirited.

“Your Highness, you should start a grand banquet for the coronation and invite powers from everywhere including Wild Dynasty.”

“Wild? Isn’t that our enemy?” Li Qiye seemed intrigued.

“Enemies can become friends depending on the circumstances, Your Highness.” Monochromatic said: “If they come, Venerable Dragon God must deal with them. We’ll use that opportunity to surprise and kill him along with Northern Monarch, another traitor.”

“What about Wild Dragon?” Li Qiye worried.

“We can negotiate with them, giving them land and resources in order to guarantee your throne. If this doesn’t work, we still have one more ace card.” Monochromatic said.

“What is it?” Li Qiye asked curiously.

“We can hire Shadowrider to assassinate those from Wild in order to deter them from pushing us to the brink.” Monochromatic said.

Shadowrider was ranked second among the ten, only behind Wild Dragon. Most importantly, this cultivator was enigmatic and elusive.

Rumor has it that no one had ever survived a meeting with this assassin.

“I see, I see… I like it! I leave it to you then.” Li Qiye clapped, seemingly in a good mood.

“Your Highness, all I need is for you to prepare a grand coronation.” Monochromatic said.

“Don’t worry, how can it not be grand when it is one of the most important events of my life?” Li Qiye nodded.

“Wise you are, Your Highness.” Monochromatic praised.

The two of them talked for a bit before Li Qiye left the palace.

“Your Highness, what did he say?” Firerage saw Li Qiye’s smirk and intuition told him that Monochromatic was up to no good.

“Prepare a great banquet for my coronation, the grander the better, invite everyone.” Li Qiye said.

“... Your Highness, this is a perilous period.” Firerage hesitated. All eyes were on them right now after the king’s death. Wouldn’t a banquet be the same as inviting wolves into the home?

“Perfect.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Well…” Firerage thought that there was something off about this whole thing. He said: “Let’s leave this to Northern Monarch, she can arrange it.”

“That’s fine.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and nodded.

Once they returned to the main palace, Venerable Dragon God was already there.

“Let me talk to His Highness.” The dragon god said.

Li Qiye waved his hand and Firerage left, albeit unwillingly.

The dragon god stared at Li Qiye. The truth was that he couldn’t see anything special about Li Qiye. However, he knew that there was something going on because Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s wisdom was second to none.

“Your Highness, you are the rightful successor of the dynasty.” The dragon god said: “I will contribute to your cause.”

He finally revealed his stance despite not seeing Li Qiye’s greatness. This was to repay the dao lord despite how grim the situation was currently.

“A loyal subject indeed.” Li Qiye nodded.

“However, I do have one request.” The dragon god got to the point.

“What is it?” Li Qiye asked.

“Please leave Eight-stallion Dynasty.” He said.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Oh?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“This is not an attempt to get rid of you, Your Highness. I only need you to lay low for a while until stability comes, both internally and externally. Then I will invite you back for your throne.” He revealed.

“No need for that.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Your Highness, your presence invites attention. People want the imperial seal and it’s hard to avoid schemers from all sides. How can I answer to His Majesty if anything were to happen to you?” The dragon god worried.

“Why do you think I need someone to protect me?” Li Qiye smiled.

“...” The dragon god couldn’t say what was on his mind, that Li Qiye was too weak and anyone could crush him with one hand.

“Blades do not have eyes, it’s dangerous.” He put it delicately.

“Descendant of Divine Dragon Mountain, you have honor and morality. Your ancestors are proud of you.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What?!” The dragon god became astounded.

He came from something great but others had no idea. They thought that he was from a small sect and was picked up by Eight-stallion Dao Lord.

“You have its bloodline, albeit faint.” Li Qiye said.

“Divine Dragon Mountain has been destroyed, the legendary ancestral ground is no more. We have no one left after the six ancestors.” The dragon god calmed down and responded.

This was a mighty lineage that had been destroyed during the transition between epochs.
