Chapter 5579: Show Mercy!

“How pitiful, a conqueror yet lacking the courage to be honest with your intent. You are a disgrace to the title and your dao fruits, you deserve neither.” Li Qiye said.

This surprised the crowd because who was qualified to make comments about the conquerors and dao lords?

They have gained their dao fruits after proving their dao. This alone was their qualification.

Turmoil Conqueror’s expression became ugly. He was humiliated repeatedly by Niu Fen and now, this mysterious youth.

Although he was far from being an apex conqueror, he still had five dao fruits - one of the strongest beings in this world.

“I obtained my dao fruits rightfully, you have no right to be running your mouth.” He gradually lost his cool.

“If I say you do not deserve them, it is the truth and I shall take them.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see, I see. Hahaha, I want to see how you’re going to take my dao fruits!” His rage turned into laughter.

“Boom!” His five fruits became resplendent as he released all of his power.

His aura swept through the crowd and sent weaker cultivators flying. Mountains and rivers nearby were obliterated.

A purple flame appeared and started burning his true blood. This fueled the dao fruits and caused them to be blindingly bright.

Not to mention regular cultivators, even dao lords and conquerors had a hard time keeping their eyes open.

“How reckless, burning his true blood.” Everyone was astounded to see this.

True blood was immensely precious to cultivators since it determined lifespan. Burning it meant throwing away years and years of life. Moreover, regaining lost true blood was virtually impossible.

“He’s livid.” The crowd took a deep breath after seeing rage turning into action. Turmoil couldn’t handle the repeated humiliation.

“Try to take my dao fruits.” Turmoil roared and released massive imperial laws, creating a mighty barrier with endless power.

“Know your place.” Li Qiye smiled and reached for the conqueror with one hand.

“Turmoil Sword Art!” Turmoil went as far as letting his true blood gush out of his chest to form a colossal sword with a red hue.

“Zzz…” Space twisted and melted from its scorching heat.

“Clank!” This infernal slash melted both the sky and the ground, inflicting widespread devastation.

“Bam!” Li Qiye blocked it first with his hand before breaking the sword. Since it was made from blood, the impact caused Turmoil to vomit more blood.

His imperial aura made from the grand dao tried to stop the incoming hand. Countless laws descended like waterfalls. Alas, both crumbled into particles before the unstoppable palm.

Turmoil was horrified and retreated with haste, only to find that he couldn’t outrun Li Qiye’s palm.

Once he was grabbed by the palm, he couldn’t withstand the pressure. Numerous bones were broken and this was still before Li Qiye added strength. This was just a casual grab, akin to someone playing with an insect.

Emperors and conquerors let out gasps instead of words. They naturally had a good understanding of their strength. Everything beneath their realm was trivial but one of them was being treated in this manner.

Weaker cultivators turned pale and felt their legs shaking. Some even wetted themselves in fear.

“I shall take your dao fruits and destroy your dao.” Li Qiye nonchalantly declared.

“Yo-you dare?!” Turmoil finally had a taste of true fear.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He had never felt anything like this before. Although he was utterly beaten by Niu Fen, he still managed to struggle and didn’t feel like an insect.

“Of course.” Li Qiye smiled and strengthened his grip, causing the conqueror to be drenched in blood.

“Show mercy!” A voice resonated like a bell and suppressed the area.
