Chapter 3822: Sinister Sword Art

The rays from Sword Hero’s eyes served as divine swords and ravaged the ten directions, seemingly turning the world into a sieve.

“I want to see how you’ll defeat me with just one or two moves!” Sword Hero laughed. His expression seemed neutral but rage was swelling inside.

This was his first time being treated in this manner. Moreover, it was a junior doing it.

During his youth, his talents were incredible. Even Ye Mingshi and Five-colored Sacred Sovereign were inferior in this regard.

Later on, he lost the competition for the throne. Nonetheless, he was still one of the most pivotal characters in the dynasty. No one would dare to question his current cultivation.

That’s why he simply couldn’t fathom someone being able to defeat him in one move, especially Li Qiye. He truly believed that no one could do so in all of the southern West King, not even someone like Buddha Supreme.

Furthermore, he was an experienced ancestor, no longer a naive genius. Thus, his battle experience and circumstantial adaptability were excellent.

He tried his best to stay calm despite being furious at Li Qiye. Anyone else would grit their teeth and bellow about wanting to tear Li Qiye to pieces.

“Get ready then. Don’t hold back.” Li Qiye wiped his hands clean and smiled.

The ancestors exchanged glances. None of them thought that a quick victory was possible.

“Can he do it? I’m sure he has some insane ace cards up his sleeve.” One murmured.

“None of them should be enough.” A sacred ancestor from the dynasty disagreed.

They racked their brains and couldn’t come up with any method capable of defeating a top master in just one move.

As for the youths, they cheered for Sword Hero, wanting Li Qiye to be punished for his arrogance.

Sword Hero didn’t relent to Li Qiye’s domineering comment. He laughed while his aura surged: “Do whatever you want, I can handle anything.”

By this point, killing Li Qiye alone wasn’t enough to quell his anger. He needed to make it a horrific death.

Li Qiye casually picked up the blacksmith hammer again and waved it around for a bit before pointing it at Sword Hero: “I’ll let you go first or you won’t have a chance to do anything.”

Sword Hero was going crazy because of Li Qiye’s attitude. He took a deep breath to calm his mental state; his eyes pulsed with a terrible light.

“Very well, let’s have it your way.” He agreed. This was an exception indeed - going first against a junior.

“Clank!” Sword rays emanated from his body, tearing apart the nine firmaments and ten earths. They could definitely cut down the stars above.

He raised his hand and caused continuous explosions. The world seemed to be toppling over. Cracks appeared on the ground and murderous intent oozed out.

The strands stuck below seemed to have been accumulated for a long time. They were eager to come out and devastate the world.

“What are these things?” The sharp intents terrified the crowd, prompting them to run to a safe distance before being split into two halves.

“Sinister Hero Sword Art, the technique that made him famous. He created this dao himself, merciless and destructive.” One ancestor from the same generation explained.

A sacred ancestor who used to be his friend had a serious expression: “Back at the academy, this technique allowed him to tie against Five-colored Sacred Sovereign.”

“Tie?” The crowd took a deep breath.

“So if they tied in the past and Sword Hero is more gifted, doesn’t that mean he’s stronger than the four grandmasters now?” One genius deduced.

“Not necessarily. Cultivation doesn’t rely on talents alone.” A high elder shook his head.

“How is Li Qiye going to survive now, haha?” Some youths started laughing, ready to gloat.

“Clank!” The individual sword rays gathered into a massive sword - the embodiment of violence and murder. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It had devoured all the devils and ghosts underground. Now, three thousand worlds and their inhabitants became the next targets.

One could hear the wails of tormented spirits within the murderous energy.

“Junior, ready to die?” Sword Hero grabbed the sword; his eyes gleamed brightly.

He became the reaper from the depth of hell itself, on the verge of reaping billions of lives.
