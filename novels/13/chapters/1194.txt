Chapter 1195: Teeming Sea Tribe

In recent days, Shallow Beach had become quite lively. Many lineages and cultivators from the Jade Sea came here. Even those from the Profound and Dragon Demon Seas came as well.

They came for the precious needlefish. In the Heaven Spirit World, these fish were used for both food and medicines due to its nutritious properties. They lived in the Bottomless Trench, so it was difficult to find them normally. Even those who entered the trench might not see them.

Only in the season of coral blossoming would these fish come out of the trench to eat the pollen.

The best time to catch them was when the flocks came. Because of this, many people ran to Shallow Beach and waited for this season to come.

Despite the number of people, there weren’t any powerful cultivators here. The majority of them were only disciples of the third generation. [1. Ancestor -> Master -> Disciple (Third Gen).]

Needlefish weren’t precious to the point that they would make people go crazy, so experts wouldn’t come in person.

Because of this, no extremely famous people could be found here, only a few people with some influence that could garner some attention.

For example, Gongsun Qianer. During her stay at Shallow Beach, many young disciples came to greet and befriend her like little bees swarming to flowers.

Qianer was the favorite maid of Gongsun Meiyu while Meiyu was a concubine of the Profound God-Monarch. He liked her to the point that rumors spread about how she might become the first wife. Because of this, her servants caught her momentum as well, thus making Gongsun Qianer a character that could call for the wind and clouds at the Profound Sea Dynasty.

Naturally, ordinary disciples would want to acquaint themselves with such a person.

Besides her, there were a few others such as Dao Attendant Lin and Yan Yanglong.

Dao Attendant Lin came by himself. He descended from the sky directly into the sea where the water split to make way for him.

This dao attendant was around sixteen or seventeen years old with a slight immortal and ethereal aura. His face was jade-like. If it wasn’t for his daoist robe, others would actually think that he wasn’t part of the mundane world.

Many young cultivators came to greet him the moment he arrived. It was a warm welcome. Even the youths with some status came to greet him as well: “Please send my regards to the Daoist.”

Many were envious of him being able to cultivate the Stainless Void Imperfection Physique Law, so they continuously sung his praise.

One of the youths spoke: “Dao Brother, your Immortal Physique is out of this world. It won’t be long until you find some success with it, such as half completion at the age of thirty.”

“No way, no way...” Dao Attendant Lin smiled humbly in response: “I am only a firefly compared to my master, I can’t reach the apex.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Despite the humble response, he seemed quite pleased with himself.

The “master” he was referring to was Daoist Lin of the Immaculate Expanse, a famous contemporary talent.

The Immaculate Expanse was a lineage created by a grand completion Immortal Physique user. It had the Stainless Physique Law that could be trained into the Void Imperfection Physique.

Daoist Lin was the current master of the Immaculate Expanse. It was rumored that his Void Imperfection Physique was at half completion and on the way towards grand completion!

Meanwhile, Dao Attendant Lin was only a servant of Daoist Lin. Nevertheless, he began to follow the daoist at a young age and was held in high regard, so he became an influential figure as well.

The other big shot who was present was Yan Yanglong, a disciple of the Extreme Yang Monarch. [1. Yang represents sun/hot/male, yin represents moon/cold/female.]

A red shuttle was docked at Shallow Beach. It was quite huge and cast a shadow down below. Many shuddered in awe after seeing the crimson emblem on the shuttle due to its master — the Extreme Yang Monarch.

It didn’t stop there. After letting a youth down, it quickly disappeared. This youth that came down from the shuttle was very handsome and dazzling. It seemed that he would illuminate whatever place he went.

This was Yan Yanglong, a brilliant disciple of the Extreme Yang Monarch. Those who were familiar with the Extreme Yang School came to greet him.

Both the Extreme Yang School and the Immaculate Expanse were famous lineages in the Jade Sea. The Extreme Yang School was also created by a grand completion Immortal Physique user and had the Limitless Divine Yang Immortal Physique Law.

Of course, both of these sects had quite a sizable gap compared to the Void Imperfection Three Schools. Nevertheless, as lineages of the Charming Spirit Race, they still had a very powerful influence in this region of the sea.

Li Qiye returned to the festive Shallow Beach with people coming and going by the minute. This initially quiet place had now become quite rowdy.

He bought some materials necessary for refinement then returned to his inn to process them.

“Step aside, out of the way!” At this time, a commotion could be heard on the streets, creating a chaotic mess.

There had been many cultivators walking through these streets, but now, they had to make way.

A large group of fish at least one thousand strong aggressively swam through these alleys. Each was about three feet long and looked quite similar in appearance with silver bodies and red fins. A sharp spur jutted out of their foreheads, resulting in a ferocious appearance that only became more vicious when they revealed their glistening razor-sharp teeth.

This group of fish could speak. A few of their fins had turned into hands, but they still couldn’t evolve from their original form.

“Teeming Sea Tribe...” Expressions changed with the appearance of these ferocious fish. No one wanted to antagonize them.

“Pop!” One cultivator was slow and couldn’t get out of the way in time, so the biggest fish in the front mercilessly unleashed his whip.

The cultivator immediately evaded it and was astounded. To be publicly humiliated like this was something that he couldn’t bear. This anger gleaned from his eyes as he declared: “You think you’re all that just because you’re part of the Teeming Tribe? You think you can do as you please?!”

“Hehehe...” The big fish sneered and arrogantly replied: “That’s right, our Teeming Tribe is indeed amazing. My children, go, show him our tribe’s overbearing domination!”

“Crackle!” The spurs on their heads suddenly flashed with lightning. With a thunderous crackle, the cultivator was struck by it and fell straight down to the ground before he could react.

An even more terrifying event occurred right afterward. The more than one thousand vicious fish suddenly rushed forward and tore him into pieces. They ate him completely without leaving a trace of blood behind. Even his bones were completely and thoroughly chewed up.

The crowd was creeped out even more. In just a moment, everyone quickly retreated with not one daring to block these fish any longer.

“Hehehe, this is our Teeming Tribe’s domination, got it?” The leading fish looked around with an imposing momentum.

The crowd was moved by the bullish behavior from this tribe, but they didn’t dare to say anything. No one really wanted to provoke the Teeming Sea Tribe!

This was a great tribe among the sea demons, especially in the Jade Sea. Some even said that the Teeming Sea Tribe was the most populous demon race in the Heaven Spirit World.

Even though they were sea demons, they weren’t welcomed by the other sea demons. On the contrary, they were considered a low-level race or even a wretched race.

The truth was not far from this. Despite their vast population, the Teeming Sea Tribe consisted of low-level demons that couldn’t get rid of their true appearance. They needed a very long time to cultivate into a human form. Their humanoid members were all powerful existences and part of the royal clans.

They might be weaker than the other sea demons, but in their own way, they were also the most fearsome because of their unimaginable numbers. It could be said that their numbers rivaled the rest of the fish in the Heaven Spirit World.

There was a phrase in this world: any place with water would have the Teeming Sea Tribe. Just this belief alone was indicative of their massive hordes.

Their reproductive capabilities could only be described with the word madness. There was no way to kill all of them. In the long years, their lairs had been attacked several times. However, they rose time after time by reproducing. Ultimately, the sects and tribes that had destroyed the Teeming Sea Tribe were wiped out by them.

This was the scariest aspect of this weak tribe; it was impossible to kill them all!
