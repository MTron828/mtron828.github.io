Chapter 5365: Eternity

Eternal versus Lightgrasp, Myriad Eye, Five-sun, and Ferocity - a fight not to be missed by anyone.

Ancestors and dragon lords understood its significance and potential dao boost. This went double for all the dao lords and conquerors among the crowd. Although this was just one move, it was more than enough to satisfy them.

“Excuse us then.” Lightgrasp laughed heartily before starting.

His chest became resplendent as he unexpectedly took something out from within - a rotating sun. It pulsed brightly and turned out to be a solar seal.

The world trembled as he held it in his hands due to its tremendous power.

“Lightgrasp Seal.” Someone who understood him commented. This was the reason for his title and the paved road for his success.

Lightgrasp channeled his power and nearly reached his peak state.

“Rumble!” Explosions detonated above, destroying countless stars. This was due to Five-sun Dao Lord combining his suns. Solar flames went into a frenzy and burned the remnants of the stars.

“Solar Reversion.” Everyone sensed the heat from the single sun. However, its heat felt rather comforting instead of being unbearable.

“Looks like it’s my turn.” Myriad Eye smiled and said.

“Zzz…” Strange spatial fluctuations occurred and his eyes separated from the body. A larger one appeared on his chest - one that was hidden by the countless eyes previously.

“The Heaven’s Eye.” Only a few conquerors and dao lords who were friends with him knew the name of the eye.

“I can’t be holding back then.” Ferocity laughed and his sacred anima tree illuminated him, seemingly purifying and allowing him to find his true self. With this, he gained a unique dao source that was powering him alone.

Everyone sensed his strength rising rapidly. His dao itself gained the profundities of ages past.

“The power of anima.” Other dragon lords and conquerors became emotional after seeing Ferocity’s empowered state. He was the only one among the four to have access to anima and a sacred tree.

“I’m starting!” Ferocity attacked first with his sacred tree, trapping Eternal with its mightiest light and pressure.

“Go!” The other three attacked at the same time without holding back. Others might mistake them for having an irreconcilable feud with Eternal. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, they were simply sticking to the agreement - one single move. If they were to hold back, the entire thing would be meaningless. Eternal would find it insulting as well.

A full-powered attack was a way to show sincerity and create meaning in this duel.

“Boom!” The single sun from Five-sun descended on Eternal, leaving no room to flee. It possessed an ethereal property, rendering a physical block ineffective.

Lightgrasp Dao Lord unleashed a palm strike while holding his titular seal. Its sheer destruction left the crowd breathless.

As for Myriad Eye - his largest eye flew out of his chest and assumed a liquid form, trapping Eternal inside. Escaping via the temporal or spatial affinity became impossible.

Their attacks destroyed everything around Eternal. Not a single affinity was left intact, whether it be a grand dao or the yin and yang.

In this crucial moment, his voice echoed across the battlefield: “Eternity!”

A blinding light surged to the sky, capable of granting living beings the years that have passed since their birth - an eternity within the ephemeral flash.

Neutral spectators suddenly felt a majestic force boosting their vitality and bloodline. They thought that they could live forever within this light.
