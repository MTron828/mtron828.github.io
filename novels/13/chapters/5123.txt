Chapter 5124: How Laughable

Many big shots came to see Li Qiye’s departure since the news have spread across the lower continents.

“It is time to leave.” Li Qiye glanced at this world and there was nothing else keeping him here.

The members of Eight-stallion Dynasty were on their knees including A’zhui and the leaders.

Truth Conqueror, Thousand-faced Sovereign, Phenomena Conqueror, and many others were present.

“Young Noble, please visit the Ten Great Mountains when you return later.” Goldcrest Young Noble lowered his head.

He was rather emotional to see Li Qiye leave because his current achievements today were given to him by Li Qiye.

“I won’t be returning once gone.” Li Qiye smiled. [1]T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Farewell, Young Noble.” Goldcrest understood and bowed, aware that he won’t be seeing Li Qiye again.

“Young Noble.” Jian Yunyun was sentimental as well. So much had changed after their first meeting. Now, she was the ruler of all of Primal.

“This world is worthy of your watch.” He tapped her shoulder and said: “You will be capable enough to do so one day.”

“I understand.” She nodded.

“We really won’t meet again?” The one who didn’t want to say goodbye the most was Princess Ming Shi.

He wiped her tears and said: “Well, as long as you continue forward bravely, maybe that day will come.”

Li Qiye clearly had a higher evaluation of Ming Shi’s future. Her fate and Yunyun’s were different.

A’zhui and Yunyun had a mission for their world, a responsibility. Princess Ming Shi was meant for something different.

“I will take this to heart.” She clenched her fist and nodded solemnly.

Conceal Conqueror whom everyone thought was dead also showed up.

“I’ll see you again later, Young Noble.” She bowed.

She was different from everyone else because she was already qualified to enter the upper continents. It was just a matter of choice to her.

“Keep up with learning.” He said.

She nodded and didn’t say anything else - true to her cold style.

“Alright, I’m going.” He smiled and took one step forward.

“Boom!” Thousands of dimensions suddenly opened up in front of him. It just took one step for him to leave the cycles of the lower continents and disappeared from sight.

This shocked all the spectators. When conquerors and dragon lords ascended, they either had a special pathway or were supported by the upper alliances.

As for Li Qiye, he directly broke through all the barriers including the world boundary. This seemed rather unprecedented.

“He’s the strongest…” A crowd member murmured.

Li Qiye left a deep impression on everyone since he was a level above the strongest cultivators.

“Goodbye.” Some of the crowd said quietly.

Although they didn’t know him or Li Qiye didn’t know them, they still felt relatively sad about him leaving.

They understood that the only reason they were still alive was due to him. Otherwise, Greenmountain Conqueror would have made meals out of them. Thus, the warm sun reminded them to remember his name - Li Qiye.

***

Li Qiye crossed through the dimensions and boundaries to reach a realm of chaos. There were numerous strange phenomena and windows here.

The windows displayed strange images - some reaching back to the past and broken places. He also saw battles between emperors and monarchs…

These were the visions from the previous wars. They were devastating enough to leave permanent memories in this place.

Li Qiye crossed through them and entered a particular dimension. This one caught his attention.

He walked up a winding path, seemingly reaching the heaven. The paved stones seemed to be from Time Immemorial - each served as an entire era.

Stepping on them meant shouldering the innate temporal immensity and memories. They were all worth watching and pondering.

The magnificent scenes inspired admiration, sorrow, and many more emotions…

Of course, not just anyone could withstand it. This power could instantly crush someone or make them lost in time forever.

Li Qiye was able to escape from the cycles, hence his ability to travel untethered. He himself wasn’t interested in these remnant memories - only the wooden gate above.

The construction was simple - being made from three pieces of timber tied together. In fact, even the timber used could be found in any forest. How did they withstand the test of time?

This was due to the person who assembled them into this shape, allowing them to be eternal by infusing them with incredible divinity.

Li Qiye focused on a couplet with ten characters written on a side piece. It was unclear whether the asymmetry was due to a lack of time or intentional.

The calligraphy style was free and unrestrained, flowing like clouds and waters while giving off a domineering feeling.

‘Only three gates for me? Laughable indeed.’

Li Qiyue's smile was distinctive. Even those who knew him best had never seen him wear this expression before - one tinged with a sense of fondness and adoration.
