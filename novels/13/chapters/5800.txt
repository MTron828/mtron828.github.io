Chapter 5800: You Must Kill Us First

“Never fall? It’s good to have confidence, but will you follow Celestial Court in its demise?” Li Qiye chuckled.

The group felt hesitant again. Would they die fighting when it seemed hopeless? What ace cards did they still have against Li Qiye?

Their apex cultivators stood no chance. What about the founder and the three immortals? Would the overlords take action?

“We will still fight to the death even in its demise!” Heaven Burial answered since this was his home.

He, Light-dragon, War Ancient God, and some others wanted to be buried with Celestial Court in the worst-case scenario.

“Sure, that’s your intent, but what about the others?” Li Qiye’s eyes fell upon the group: “Don’t linger around until the massacre starts.”

They could smell the stench of blood and see heads rolling on the ground upon hearing this. A sword drew near to their neck, ready for decapitation.

“Sacred Teacher, I will stay. You must walk over my corpse first if you want to destroy Celestial Court.” Sword Emperor stepped forward.

“Such commendable courage, I feel inclined to spare your life after hearing this.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh.

“Thank you, Sacred Teacher, I have no reason to live without Celestial Court. You must kill me first.” Sword said resoundingly.

His words calmed many of them down since he represented the three great races. If he had backed down, others would undoubtedly follow suit. If the current leader didn’t wish to protect Celestial Court, why would they?

“Good, do others share the same thought? If it’s just you, it would be rather pitiful.” Li Qiye clapped and said.

“Sacred Teacher, you might be unbeatable but I have been here for too long and won’t back off. You must kill me first as well.” Immortal Emperor Hao Hai declared powerfully. Nothing could change his mind.

Emperors and dao lords from the nine worlds and Eight Desolaces exchanged glances. Although they were prideful, Hao Hai had somewhat become their leader. They didn’t follow all of his commands but his attitude and stance were influential.

They believed that he still had confidence in Celestial Court’s chances due to the overlords.

“Who will be able to guarantee Celestial Court’s survival today?” Li Qiye stared at Hao Hai and smiled.

“A real man stands firm with his words. Since I have joined Celestial Court, I am bound to live and die with it.” Hao Hai spoke with conviction: “The depths of Celestial Court are boundless, Sacred Teacher, you do not know its true extent and certainly won’t be the cause of its downfall today.”

Blood started boiling and wavering members thought about how long Celestial Court had lasted. It had faced numerous tribulations and assaults before, only to surpass them all. Destroying Celestial Court required killing the overlords as well. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

These cultivators were unfathomable. Some were rumored to have lived since the start of the world. Li Qiye might be strong but how could he defeat several of them?

“Beautiful rhetoric, I am indeed curious to witness the so-called depths, whether it is enough to justify your confidence.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sacred Teacher, your insistence on destroying Celestial Court will end with the Ancestors killing you.” The silent Profound Emperor finally spoke.

A divine light seemingly descended as if he were representing those unfathomable entities.

Although he had no official position and rarely appeared, everyone believed that he was a representative of the overlords.

“Which Ancestors? The three immortals or the founder, or the ones you believe to be unbeatable such as Lord of Derivation and Primal Ancestor?” Li Qiye laughed.

He confirmed everyone’s speculations since no one dared to address this matter. Most have never heard of these overlords, let alone meet them. It seemed that they truly existed.
