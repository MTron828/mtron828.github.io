Li Qiye also planned to leave right after the altar. He didn’t bother anyone else so only Gong Qianyue and Ping Suoweng knew about it.

Suoweng initially wanted to commence a grand farewell ceremony but Li Qiye didn’t give permission.

Gong Qianyue didn’t cry at all but her eyes were red. Perhaps she cried during the previous night.

“Silly girl, keep trying. There will be a spot for you up there.” Li Qiye smiled and gave her a hug after seeing her sad appearance.

She hugged tightly and didn’t want to let go. Eventually, she let go and nodded: “I won’t let you down, Young Master.” Tears finally wetted the corner of her eyes.

Ping Suoweng also got on his knees and bowed, representing Divine Black to show its gratitude and to bid him goodbye.

Li Qiye nodded and left without looking back at the two. This wasn’t because he was emotionless or had a heart of stone but rather, he has experienced these departures too many times before. Thus, he no longer wanted to think about them or look back after each one.

Suoweng stopped following his figure once he disappeared into the horizon. However, Gong Qianyue kept on looking.

Suoweng sighed after seeing this. His disciple was excellent and no geniuses could get into her sight in the past.

“We’re not in the same world as the young master.” He quietly told her.

Though he was at the Grand Dao Sacred Physique realm and a big shot in northern West King, he knew of the gap between them.

They were nothing more than ants crawling on the ground versus a true immortal above the nine firmaments. The ants couldn’t get through the distance and could only look up at him. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I know. Young Master stands at the apex so I need to try harder. Maybe I’ll be able to get there and see its scenery.” Gong Qianyue took a deep breath while clenching her fists.

“You’ll definitely be able to do it.” Suoweng was happy to see her spirit increasing. He had a high evaluation of her since her dao heart and talents both exceeded his.

Maybe she couldn’t become a dao lord later but would still definitely be a top character such as a mighty Heavenly Sovereign. Thus, the future of Divine Black relied on her.

“Young Master, who is he, really?” She eventually murmured.

Li Qiye seemed like a puzzle that couldn’t be solved by anyone, always hidden behind secrecies.

“The immortal, the one in the legend.” Suoweng pondered for a bit and decided to tell her with a cautious expression.

“The immortal written in our records?” She became shocked despite being mentally prepared for any answer.

“It’s a possibility.” Suoweng remained prudent: “This might be the touch of fate he brought up before. Unfortunately, we’re inferior to our patriarch...” He sighed with disappointment.

Their sect had ancient records depicting their patriarch being taught by an immortal. From then on, it obtained a great fortune and followed the immortal to great paradises...

Everyone in Divine Black memorized these tales. Thus, Suoweng had thought about it very carefully. There was a chance of Li Qiye being the immortal in the tales.

He naturally didn’t dare to ask Li Qiye or tell others about it with the exception of Qianyue. Perhaps this connection was the reason why Li Qiye showed up and decided to save Divine Black.

“We’ve let our ancestors down.” He eventually concluded.

There was such an amazing opportunity before them yet they couldn’t grasp it - truly shameful. It showed that they didn’t have what it takes to earn the immortal’s grace, unlike their patriarch. This was extremely important for Divine Black’s prosperity, a chance to let them reach their golden age for the second time.

“An immortal? Either way, he’s still our Young Master.” Qianyue said. He would always be the young master in her mind - a man who had everything in his grasp and acted with complete confidence and leisureliness.

“Don’t tell anyone about this. No one.” Suoweng said with a solemn expression.

This matter would stir the entire world and it might have negative effects for Li Qiye.

“I understand.” Qianyue would never tell this secret to anyone.

“You will shoulder Divine Black in the future.” He stared at her and said.

Though they lost this opportunity, Qianyue did the best out of anyone and clearly got on Li Qiye’s good side. He taught her quite a bit so given her innate talents and this fateful connection, she would definitely reach the top and bring prosperity to Divine Black.

She didn’t say anything and stared in his direction.

“Let’s go back.” Suoweng sighed and went back first.

She remained there for a long time. “Young Master.” She eventually whispered before leaving.

After returning, she immediately underwent isolated cultivation without caring about anyone else.

The others in Divine Black didn’t know that Li Qiye was gone until a long time later.

Li Qiye’s destination was Stone Plateau. He took his time like always during these journeys.

Despite being a Bronze Tendon cultivator, his speed far exceeded the rest. It was easy for him to cross through space.

Nonetheless, he wanted to feel the world. There had been monumental changes in the Nine Worlds, now the Eight Desolaces.

If it weren’t for the indelible marks from the Nine Worlds, no one would recognize it. The outlines and geography have all changed.

Li Qiye began deriving the profundities of this land along the way, becoming one with the dao. In this process, he broke through to the next realm - Silver Carapace.

This allowed him to start a new merit law and a mantra. He casually picked one mantra up from Divine Black before leaving - Divinization.

This was naturally one of the seven original mantras. Of course, this version no longer had its original form. This wasn’t hard for Li Qiye to change since he could derive a perfect version from it.

What was special about the Divinization Mantra? With a single thought, one could become a god. This was its highest profundity.

Unfortunately, very few have been able to reach this step. That’s why most didn’t give a damn about it and labeled it as being ordinary and worthless.
