Chapter 5755: There’s A Problem

“Let’s look around.” Li Qiye told the star and the cloud who were curious about this new world.

They took their time walking around this world but no mortal could see him without his permission. They found that this place was small to the point of being pitiful.

Eight Desolaces and the six continents were massive. One region had thousands and thousands of sects and kingdoms. Top masters had a hard time traversing the world without the help of portals and gateways.

This world was only as big as a small kingdom from Eight Desolaces. Its population was proportional.

Nonetheless, mortals didn’t have a problem living here and did not know cultivation. Everything related to the dao path seemed absent.

No cultivators wanted to live here since it resembled a hellish prison. On the other hand, it had enough nourishment for mortals.

There was no competition and disaster - people lived with unlocked doors and didn’t pick up money on the ground.

Such a strange world - a paradise for mortals - was reclusive and hidden. Top masters could fly by these coordinates without noticing its existence.

This place was simple due to having a population of only one million or so. Each mortal could trace their ancestry back to a point where they were all related.

Neighbors knew each other and traditions were passed down from generation to generation. The land was fertile enough to make food scarcity a non-issue. Peace and prosperity made this place a utopia.

“Hmm...” As Li Qiye observed this simple world, he found that there was something off about it.

He had visited numerous realms before and never met a place devoid of dao power and worldly essences. There was one exception above but that was due to the old geezers devouring everything. It didn’t mean that the place never had dao and energy.

This would remind everyone of Momentous Frontier - another paradise for motals. However, it was protected by deities and things meant for the cultivation world were available.

If a cultivator were thrown here, they would be driven insane from cultivation deprivation.

“Do you two sense how strange this place is? Who did it?” Li Qiye smiled.

They were sensitive to dao and mysteries, capable of also sensing dao sources. However, they felt nothing just like Li Qiye.

“Momentous Frontier is protected by the deities, who is protecting this place?” He stroked his chin.

The two fell into silence.

“Do you know?” Li Qiye asked the star.

It looked around and shook its head - this world was completely different than expected.

“There’s a problem, a plan of sorts.” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed.

Someone came before, resulting in the mortal population. What was the goal though?

He gazed at this place and could tell that the visitor didn’t excavate the world.

Why were mortals left here? For what purpose? Li Qiye had no answer.

The cloud and the star stared at him as if saying - you don’t know?

“The nine worlds have a similar place but that was meant for hiding. This is both meant for hiding yet not.” He said: “Hiding these mortals?”

This didn’t seem to be worth it because the process must have been difficult. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

There existed two separate issues for him - where was the secret hiding and why were mortals left here?

Did this person go to great trouble to hide their descendants? No, he looked around and saw a lack of a unified bloodline.

If such a bloodline existed, he would have easily noticed it. They were mortals, not descendants of a powerful cultivator.

“I’m going to calculate.” He slowly floated upward and raised one hand, sending primordial energy around this world.

He could see the entire thing within his grasp, capable of delivering death to any mortal with his whim.

This became an ant hill; the ants had no idea that there was a supreme existence floating above with absolute control over their fate.

He could destroy everything with a single thought - a reality that could cause them to bellow in horror.
