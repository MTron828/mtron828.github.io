“Oh my, I haven’t introduced the two of you but the flirting has already begun.” A voice suddenly interrupted the two.

Fan Miaozhen came out of nowhere and teased the two, acting as if they were hiding something from the rest.

Qin Shaoyao wasn’t as bold as the crafty Miaozhen so her face blushed like the red river and pouted: “Senior Sister, you’re picking on me again.”

Miaozhen laughed and told Li Qiye: “Shaoyao is our Hundred-flowers’ youngest sister, loved by people and flowers alike. Don’t bully her, First Brother, we simply won’t allow it.”

Li Qiye couldn’t do much against this eccentric girl and only shook his head.

“But Shaoyao’s alchemy skill is peerless in Longevity Valley, you need to spend more time with her, First Brother.” Miaozhen looked at the two of them with a strange expression.

Shaoyao was the youngest in Hundred-flowers, but she displayed amazing talents for alchemy. She was in charge of plant cultivation and medicinal formulas at the valley right now.

“You’re doing it again, Senior Sister. Who doesn’t know that you’re actually the most talented here with your pill-making skills.” The young girl turned red and quietly said.

This was the truth as well. Because of her strange act, some forgot about her incredible talents.

“I’m feeling quite good to hear such praises. We, the Three Ladies, are incredible geniuses in Myriad Lineage, maybe our master really knows how to teach.” Miaozhen cheerfully joked and was received quite well by the other two.

“I’m talking about me and Little Sister Shaoyao, so you have met two of the Three Ladies. I can introduce you to the last one if you are interested.” She continued on.

So it turned out that Longevity Sage had three direct disciples. Miaozhen was the oldest and Shaoyao was the youngest. The second one was named Mu Yalan.

“Why not?” He smiled.

“Then let’s go.” Miaozhen smiled: “I want your opinion on which of us three is the prettiest.”

“I need to take care of the plant, the two of you can go ahead, Senior Brother and Senior Sister.” Shaoyao said, a bit afraid of her First Sister’s constant teasing. This was the case for everyone in Hundred-flowers.

“Alright, I’ll let you off this time.” Miaozhen smiled and started pulling Li Qiye away.

She had no qualm about touching a male before marriage, just like a little girl. The two of them ran out of Hundred-flowers. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

When serious, she was a graceful lady. When acting crazy, she could cause a lot of headaches.

There were plenty of buildings and houses outside of the valley, some temporary tents as well.

This was a branch of the sect - Medicinal Hall. It took in all patients from around the world.

The moment they got here, the scent of medicine was quite strong. This place was lively with cultivators and mortals needing help. Longevity Valley was unique in this sense. Normally, mortals were no different from ants. Cultivators wouldn’t give a damn about them.

Medicinal Hall didn’t see it that way. They welcomed both cultivators and mortals. Plus, the price was very fair or even free for mortals. This added to the sect’s good reputation.

Moreover, some mortals chose to stay here to learn medicine as well. Doctors from this branch eventually spread out all over the places.

Plenty of patients were waiting - wounded cultivators and mortals on the verge of death.

Luckily, the place had enough doctors from both the valley itself and the students.

She pulled him into a courtyard all the way inside to find a woman sitting down and reading a patient’s case history.

The woman wore a plain dress with her hair tied up high. Her brows were lightly drawn like the smoke over yonder the mountain. Her eyes were bright and animated. When she focused, they emitted a frightening glow and an imposing aura.

She wasn’t old but her demeanor was the opposite of this. She was a lotus at first sight - noble and unreachable. However, upon closer inspection, a winter apricot flower was the more apt description, cold and keeping everyone away.

This was one of the Three Ladies of Longevity Valley - the Second Sister, Mu Yalan.

All three were experts at different things. The oldest was good at pill making; the youngest good at alchemy; the one in the middle was good at medicine, capable of bringing people back from the brink of death.

“Yalan, Yalan, let me introduce you to a handsome fella.” Miaozhen dragged Li Qiye inside while shouting, not giving a damn about her image.

Yalan helplessly looked up and frowned: “Is there something, Senior Sister?”

She resembled the First Sister more than Miaozhen. Miaozhen tapped Li Qiye’s shoulder and said: “What do you think about him, Yalan? A good match for you?”

With that, she elbowed Li Qiye as if she just did him a favor, that they were the closest friends. Li Qiye didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry after seeing this.

Yalan gave him a quick glance and said: “Sister, I have many patients waiting.”

She then went back to reading her chart.

“Just messing with you.” Miaozhen coughed and said seriously: “This is our First Brother, a direct disciple under Master. I’m taking him here for an introduction, don’t be arrogant now.”

When she wanted to be serious, she was imposing enough, worthy of her seniority.

Yalan looked at him again and nodded for a greeting: “First Brother, your fame precedes you.”

Of course, this was only a polite speech. She had no idea who the hell he was beforehand. After the greeting, she went back to reading. She remained cold and distant to him as well.

“First Brother is good at alchemy and pill-making, oh, medicine too, a master at everything and had inherited Master’s legacies.” Miaozhen began boasting: “You should be asking him to learn more about the mysteries of medicines.”

“I will surely ask First Brother for help when I have time.” Yalan casually answered without looking up.

Her response was actually out of respect for Miaozhen. A First Brother appearing out of nowhere wasn’t worthy of respect.

“Well, why not today?” Miaozhen elbowed him again and blinked, seemingly wanting to play the role of a matchmaker.

Li Qiye smiled and felt that the cold girl wasn’t as interesting to him as Miaozhen.

“Sister, I actually have a lot of patients recently. Would another day be alright?” There was no doubt that Yalan wanted the guests to leave and had no intention of talking to Li Qiye.

At this time, a disciple came in and reported: “Hall Master, the Poison King is here.”

Having heard that, Yalan stood up right away: “Invite him in right away, I’ll be right out.”

She then told Miaozhen: “Sister, I have a patient requiring the help of Poison King. I need to go see him, please excuse me.”

She also nodded at Li Qiye, a polite goodbye of sorts, before leaving.
