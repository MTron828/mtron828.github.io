Chapter 5341: The Dragonslayer Becomes The Evil Dragon

Timewatcher laughed and said: “Big Bro, fine, I’ll go with you to deal with Supreme, let’s see who is fiercer.”

“No, you need to take care of Xiao Hu.” Hallowed refused.

“You know taking care of a child is not my expertise, I will only steer your disciple in the wrong direction. That’s too big of a sin for me to handle, let me go with you.” Timewatcher said.

“Then I won’t ask you for help.” Hallowed refused right away.

“Big Bro, am I not a capable conqueror? I can take care of at least three to five enemies.” Timewatcher complained, wanting to join the battlefield instead.

“You wish to die.” The old servant spoke to Hallowed.

“Killing Supreme is easier said than done, it is a suicidal endeavor.” Hallowed admitted.

“As I’ve said, kill Illumination first. Find All-things and Sword Queen, that should be enough. Otherwise, the heart of The People is forever separated.” Li Qiye casually said.

“I agree wholeheartedly. Sure, many praised Illumination for protecting The People but that’s all in the past. Now, he is misguided and wants to kill all of The Race, that’s just nonsense.” Timewatcher responded, not having the same reservation on the topic as Hallowed or the old servant.

“Let me be frank, all the disasters in this world are caused by powerful cultivators such as us. Let’s not talk about the previous epochs or anything but after the calamity was relative peace. Celestial Court had to ruin that with devastating wars. How many mortals lost their lives because of us?” He said with a bitter smile: “It’s so meaningless. Must one side be eradicated at all costs? If this is Illumination’s intention, he is no different from a devil and The People doesn’t need him.”

Hallowed and the others understood this but hesitated on being so vocal.

“Illumination is certainly the culprit. The same tragedies will start because of him.” The old servant said.

“You are absolutely correct, Dao Brother. He is hellbent on revenge while trying to justify it with numerous excuses. Perhaps he is actually considering himself as a noble protector of The People.” Timewatcher clapped in response.

Many praised Illumination for standing up against Heaven Alliance and The Race alone. This stemmed from back when he was a young mortal - his whole family and lover were killed by a member of The Race.

The exact details eluded future generations. However, a trustworthy account consisted of them being mere casualties from a battle between powerful cultivators.

The shockwaves alone must have killed everyone with the exception of the lucky conqueror. During the aftermath, he swore to avenge his loved ones by eradicating The Race.

He was indeed brilliant, able to reach the top despite his humble background. Nonetheless, his reign caused some of the fiercest battles between the two sides. This only ended with Puresun Dao Lord’s involvement, his banishment, and the Pact of Blessed.

Prosperity came during his absence. This only shifted recently with Supreme’s rise and the abdication of Principle Conqueror.

“The dragonslayer will become the evil dragon.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s the perfect way to describe this.” Timewatcher agreed: “He hasn’t thought about how the true culprits are powerful cultivators, not The Race. Every one of us here had killed too many innocent mortals, we are heinous villains.”

Cultivators didn’t like to hear this grim truth. Illumination became a cultivator for the sake of vengeance, ignoring all the new victims he created along the path.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Yes.” The old servant sighed.

“But have any of us repented? No, I haven’t either.” Timewatcher smiled.

“Our hands might be stained with blood and we have failed to protect the mortals. However, we can stop fighting, I am trying hard to do so.” The old servant said.

“We know of your recent efforts and respect you for it. I can’t say the same about my idle and useless self.” Timewatcher said.

“Just protecting your dao heart is already benefiting the world.” Li Qiye said: “As for becoming protectors and saviors, that’s just the process of becoming evil dragons.”

Everyone thought about Illumination Conqueror after hearing this. He claimed to be the protector of The People and started many wars.

Top cultivators suffered grievous losses, let alone mortals. So was he protecting The People or pushing them down the cliff?

On the other hand, a playboy such as Timewatcher was far from being a protector. Although he had also killed many during his cultivation quest, he didn’t start wars.

“You are right, Sir.” Hallowed and the old servant bowed.

“I suppose we should shift our focus to Illumination first before dealing with Supreme. Otherwise, when Supreme marches an army to Dao Alliance, he would find that it is already broken.” Timewatcher concluded.

“We have to help All-things then.” Hallowed said.
