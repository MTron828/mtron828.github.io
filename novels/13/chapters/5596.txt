Chapter 5597: Hopeless

Despair was an interesting battle aura. Just-once Dao Lord was someone who only needed one victory after a hundred defeats, honing his sword skills continuously. He loved battles, no different from his patriarch.

He was far from a star during his dao debut. His shallow cultivation meant that he was always on the losing side. Nevertheless, he never became discouraged and always fought until victory became possible.

This type of dao search became the best tradition of Daoist Sword Ground. The love for battle was carved into its members’ bones.

Just-once traveled far on this path, eventually becoming a dao lord. Nonetheless, he didn’t stop and still traveled to the immortal continent.

Outsiders didn’t know the story of how he joined Celestial Court. A relatively reliable explanation suggested that a fight with Celestial Court ended with a promise to join.

His aura had two effects - boosting his determination while lowering the enemies’ morale. This differed from War God Dao Lord’s whose aura invoked heroism and courage into his allies.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

One lowered battle spirit while the other did the opposite. It was interesting that these two cultivators came from the same branch.

“The dao of war emphasizes the courage to advance.” War God’s aura beat like a drum.

“Victory is when the enemy is defeated.” Just-once attempted to suppress War God’s aura.

“It is not a righteous dao.” War God roared and unleashed his sword intent, aiming to do the same.

“Patriarch, you have gone as far as possible with this dao. I must seek another way.” Just-once said; his eyes flashed with determination.

Others watched attentively as they battled with their dao. Just-once’s assertion certainly made sense. Becoming a dao lord while using someone else’s dao was difficult enough, let alone surpassing the original creator.

This was a path already traveled. Just-once wanted to surpass his patriarch, hence the need to try something different - forging a new sword technique through defeats.

Which of their dao was the proper path? The answer changed depending on the perspective.

“Rumble!” Meanwhile, the blood of fallen ancestors and dragon lords covered the ground.

The outcome of the battle was all but determined. Immortal Emperor Yao Guang and his allies couldn’t stop Celestial Court despite numerous valiant attempts.

They lacked the blessing of Immortal Dao City - a true disadvantage. Layers of barriers fell before the formations of the mighty armies. Alas, Imperial West Bank still didn’t react.

By this point, the remaining big shots of Dao City had lost hope completely in the imperial clan. Regardless of whether this was a neutral stance or if they had already joined Celestial Court, help was not coming.

“Bam!” Six-finger Conqueror was sent flying through one mountain after another. He struggled to climb out of the crater and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Withdraw!” He had no choice but to order the retreat of Six-finger Peak.

“Clank!” The emperors of Celestial Court penetrated Jadesword Dao Lord’s ocean of blades. He was pierced in several places, being pushed back continuously.

“Boom!” Skysplitter Conqueror’s lightning waves were oppressive and destructive. Unfortunately, they were eventually extinguished.

“Back to Momentous Frontier!” He knew that there was no point in fighting a losing battle.

“To Momentous Frontier!” Dao portals appeared around kingdoms and sects in Dao City. Their cultivators began retreating toward Dao Frontier while the emperors fought to buy time.

Meanwhile, the armies marched forward through the collapsed barriers.

Light descended and imprinted Celestial Court’s special markings on the land, seizing the territories.

Emperors and dao lords could only watch their sects and kingdoms being taken away. Unfortunately, they were powerless to stop the process without the help of Immortal Dao City. The battle was already grim enough and Celestial Court still had other apex cultivators.

“Boom!” Luminous gathered all the lights nearby to stop War and a suppressive beam originating from Celestial Court. He illuminated the entire world - a testament to his title.

“Withdraw to Momentous Frontier!” He withstood the attack while continuing to move backward before shouting.

The remaining combatants heard his command. Anyone with enough power to run immediately headed in that direction.
