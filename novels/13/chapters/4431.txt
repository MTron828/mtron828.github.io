Chapter 4432: Bowl Of The World

“Boom!” The crimson light encompassed everything nearby.

“Shit! It’s a self-detonation!” Many experts shouted.

“Run! He’s exploding!” Everyone immediately ran to a safe distance.

Meanwhile, the ex-sect master was burning his vitality. His power increased dramatically along with the temperature. The world was being boiled into a red hue.

“He’s ready to die in order to take down Li Qiye.” The crowd understood his intent.

Burning one’s vitality and true fate was a last-ditch effort. He saw how ineffective his dao obliteration was and decided to drag Li Qiye down with him.

At this crucial moment, a loud explosion could be heard from an unbelievable distance. A beam shot to the sky and illuminated the world.

An aura of a great genius swept through the regions and made everyone shudder. The target of this aura was none other than Dragon’s territory.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the source came from someone capable of becoming a dao lord in the future.

Both the young and old felt suffocated. Weaker cultivators dropped to the ground.

“Eastern Desolace.” Ancient Lion took note of the direction.

“It’s Five-sun School!” An ancestor from the east had a better grasp of the location. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“It’s His Majesty’s aura!” Featherhat Paragon shouted.

Everyone knew that Five-sun King was not here since he had undergone isolated cultivation. However, his aura was still so suppressive despite the distance.

They had felt his power during the dao lecture. Of course, this took it to the next level and frightened them all.

Something crushed space itself and crossed through the dimensions. Its speed couldn’t be described by words.

This treasure arrived and poured down torrents of dao laws. It was a divine bowl with an oceanic level of radiance.

“Bowl of the Worldl! His Majesty’s treasure!” Featherhat shouted again.

The crowd felt time stopping or at least becoming a million times slower. Every action stagnated in slow-mo.

A supreme power fixated on the ex-sect master of Five-sun. It suppressed him and stopped him from burning his vitality.

At the same time, a heavenly hand manifested from the bowl’s rays, reaching for Li Qiye. Everything beneath this hand withered instantly. This divinity was strong enough to intimidate some of the ancestors present.

The suppression of this treasure assaulted the soul, not the physical body. The heavenly hand could bypass physical defenses and crush the soul and true fate.

This feeling alone horrified everyone. They felt inferior like specks of dust while being subjugated by this treasure known as Bowl of the World.

Five-sun King was still in training but he couldn’t watch his father commit suicide. He sent his treasure and performed a two-pronged technique to save his father and attack Li Qiye.

The crowd was certainly impressed by the effectiveness of the bowl even though Five-sun King wasn’t here in person. They gained a good sense of how frightening and mighty he was.

His potential of becoming a dao lord was known to all. He had proved himself in Dragon as well. Nonetheless, witnessing him in action was still enlightening. The power of an heir couldn’t be underestimated.

Moreover, an heir was already this strong. What about an actual dao lord?

“Clank!” Their rumination was interrupted by a saber hymn. They felt their heart being sliced by this sound.

As the power of the bowl descended, Li Qiye simply changed his swing to a reverse vertical slash.

Time started flowing right away. The suppression and offense of the bowl were instantly severed.

“Splash!” Blood gushed out of the ex-sect master and caught everyone off guard. Next, his body split into two halves and the internal organs poured out.

His eyes were wide open as he fell down to the ground. He didn’t expect his son to stop his detonation nor Li Qiye’s slash being able to bypass the bowl’s suppression. He didn’t even have the chance to stop the slash.
