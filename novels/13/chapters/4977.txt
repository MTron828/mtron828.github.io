Chapter 4978: Majestic Wilderness

Despite not entering the region yet, the duo felt the auras of beasts as if millions of them were howling.

Wonderful sceneries could be found everywhere, whether it be towering trees or unbroken valleys extending forever into the distance…

The creatures here benefited from favorable circumstances and as time passed, some turned into demons. Over the eras, numerous demons occupied this land and made it rather dangerous.

Some were old enough to gain the ability to devour the sun and moon. Others considered themselves kings of beasts and reigned over their brethren.

A few took on human form, a gift from the dao. They left their home in order to pursue a greater height…

Yunyun shuddered with instinctive fear, aware that this journey would be rather dangerous.

“The Ten Grand Mountains.” She said: “Young Noble, we are about to enter Demon.”

This was the largest region in the lower continents, known for its treacherous nature. Many have entered; only a few were lucky enough to leave.

Chaos might be the most chaotic continent but the Ten Mountains were certainly the most dangerous.

Cultivators commented that a five-fruit dragon lord could travel untethered anywhere but here - a place where they could turn into prey.

Colossal beasts and demons lived here; their intelligence wasn’t unlocked. After growing old enough, they possessed enough power to rival the demon deities.

These deities were in charge of the region. Any intruder would instantly be noticed by these great beings.

Thus, top cultivators always acted with caution here. Big shots have also fallen in this place.

“Demon.” Li Qiye closed his eyes and took a deep breath to sense the primeval aura.

“We will be entering the six deities’ domains soon.” Yunyun said solemnly.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She was strong enough to fight cultivators from the last generation. Alas, this place far exceeded her current abilities.

“The six deities?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Wild Dragon is from one of the six, Serpent.” Yunyun said.

These special entities have taken root in the Ten Grand Mountains, gathering the power of all the living beings here. The birds and beasts worshipped the deities and offered them the power of faith.

Serpent was the oldest among them, rumored to have been around since the very formation of the mountains.

However, the most famous one was Wood due to its founder - Demon Conqueror. After earning the respect of the demon kings, he managed to unify Demon. The other deities also supported Wood to be their leader.

In this lineage, any demon was free to worship a chosen branch. However, a relationship was formed at this moment, combining their power with the deity. They gained power but lost the freedom to leave the mountains.

Of course, if a beast didn’t choose any of this, they could still cultivate the dao and become a demon normally, free to leave whenever. Alas, these were rare circumstances since this world belonged to the six deities. Creatures would find it virtually impossible to become demons without the deities’ involvement. Being weak here often meant death.

“We’re entering.” Li Qiye walked forward with a smile.

Yunyun took a deep breath and followed right behind him. She would have hesitated to do so if it wasn’t for his presence. She believed that he could deal with any demon or colossal creature.

Once they were inside, the sky was blocked by the towering trees. They saw large peaks ahead, some with celestials floating around them.

They saw many powerful beasts and birds as well, most had an unreasonable size. The atmosphere here was perfect for their growth.

A gigantic serpent - the king of this area - immediately greeted them. It spewed out miasma and corroded the trees nearby. Other creatures fled right away. It lunged for the two, excited to enjoy a feast.

However, Yunyun was a Supreme Sovereign and easily killed the serpent in just two moves. She led the way, saving Li Qiye the trouble.

She eventually killed too many to count - a tiger as large as a peak, a serpent as long as a river, an eagle with sky-blotting wings…

They were ferocious but still didn’t become demons yet. She had no problem taking them down.

“Is Shadowrider staying here? Is he from Demon?” She asked.

From what she saw that night, Shadowrider resembled a human more than a demon.

“I’m sure there’s a reason for this.” Li Qiye smiled.
