Chapter 4278: Always The Same

He was a dragon among men, possessing both authority and an impressive harem. He enjoyed the best life possible, becoming the target of envy and jealousy.

However, he wasn’t satisfied with just being a matchless God Monarch and chose an entirely new path.

Sure enough, he gained immense power - an ability insane enough to frighten gods and devils. Unfortunately, this stopped mattering to him once he embarked on this path.

The dao resulted in him despising everything, even the goal that made him abandon everything. Power became meaningless.

In the past, he couldn’t help desiring ultimate power and a higher path. His new path indeed granted him more power but now, it escalated to the point where he didn’t even wish to fight, let alone dominate the world.

He wouldn’t have the urge to fight a mortal enemy right now. There was nothing but indifference and distaste.

“No one has been able to change this path.” Li Qiye commented. This happened to Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo then Yu Zhengfeng.

“Mu Zhuo did it due to external circumstances and Yu Zhengfeng’s heart desired this. What about you?” Li Qiye asked.

“It doesn’t matter anymore.” The old man said.

This path was one of hatred. The user would hate and be hated by everything else. They would lose their emotions and desires.

Alas, they also gained immense longevity. Thus, death would be salvation but it wasn’t that easy to die. Only time could kill them, but how long?

“How pitiful.” Li Qiye smiled and closed his eyes again, assuming his astral state. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The old man sighed and didn’t continue the conversation. His former self would have been overwhelmed with curiosity after meeting Li Qiye. He would have asked numerous questions, especially the reason for Li Qiye’s return.

After all, no Immortal Emperors and dao lords came back to their world, not even the most capable ones. Li Qiye was an exception with access to numerous secrets.

The geniuses in the past craved to know what’s above the nine heavens - the secrets of the myriad dao.

But now, the old man was no longer interested. He didn’t have the desire to live, let alone external matters.

He went back to the corner and curled up again. What happened just now was an ephemeral spark, completely trivial.

Time passed and Li Qiye’s body started moving again. He left the shop and the old man didn’t stop him.

His shoes became filled with sand. He eventually disappeared into the desert.

On the other side, the shop remained; the only constant being the cloth sign fluttering to the wind. The old man slumbered once more, awaiting death. The scorching heat during the day and the chilling breezes at night couldn’t wake him up.

He was once a dashing cultivator who stood at the apex and had many companions. Now, only time was his companion and eventually, his killer.

On the other hand, Li Qiye’s footprints gradually disappeared from the surface.

The two of them had a deep understanding and experience with time. However, their dao path was completely opposite.

One day, this vast desert could disappear or turn into a great ocean. These two would certainly outlast it.

This was more so the case for Li Qiye. The old man would die eventually so in a sense, Li Qiye’s torture was worse.

Li Qiye’s body continued its long journey, truly acting as a passerby without any senses. However, once he made it to an old city, his soul returned again since memories of old friends beckoned him.

This happened again in another ruin. The tiles and broken walls made him think twice. He sat here and gave out orders in the past. Those he loved and those who loved him have disappeared on the river of time.

Once enough time had passed, he would truly be alone. This had happened several times in his long history.

In reality, the monstrous existences and overlords have suffered this fate as well. Only they were strong enough to survive while their friends and loved ones couldn’t overcome death.

This was the reason why they became unshackled. Joining the darkness was far easier, a simple choice that has nothing to do with morality.

Only those with an indomitable dao heart could move forward without being tempted by the darkness.

There has been no lack of supreme existences in history. Alas, only a few shared the same characteristic as Li Qiye.

He continued to observe the world and the myriad dao during this journey. The whole thing seemed like a dream.
