The shocking fight left everyone in Nine-linked Mountains frightened.

The useless king was actually a hidden master, easily killing an Eternal like Ma Mingchun along with an entire legion. Those who have laughed at him before or the sects that have participated in the coup were nervous, thinking that payback was due.

If the king cared for the past, so many heads would start rolling on the ground, numerous sects would face their doom.

Just think about it, one kick from him was enough to turn Ma Mingchun into two halves. This terrifying existence could easily take down anyone. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Because of this, people were scared out of their mind. Those who have offended him wanted nothing more than to prostrate and beg for mercy and forgiveness.

Most remained quiet after the battle, not daring to comment on the king.

“Will Eight Formation True Emperor accept the challenge?” Nevertheless, people still discussed in private quarters with their friends and seniors.

This issue took contemplation. In the past, a unanimous answer would be given - that someone like Eight Formation wouldn’t give a damn about the king. Accepting it was no problem.

This was no longer the case. In fact, people didn’t have much confidence in the emperor any longer.

“Well, he’s still a True Emperor, so he should come.” A senior quietly said, albeit with uncertainty.

“But the king is too strong.” The junior was afraid because the king’s deeds have left behind a terrible shadow in his mind, perhaps for a lifetime.

In the past, these youths worshipped Eight Formation True Emperor. They considered him to be a peerless genius, a great role model.

That’s why they also thought that the emperor made a perfect match with Bingchi Hanyu - a talented broom and a beautiful bride.

Strangely enough, they didn’t worship the king the same way. Instead of admiration, they felt nothing but fear for him, similar to Lucidity King. He had surpassed the level of admiration. Someone this terrifying only instilled trepidation into the crowd.

“He has to.” An ancestor looked over at Myriad Kingdom Formation and said: “If he doesn’t, he’ll stagnate forever and won’t become a majestic emperor.”

“Why is that?” A junior asked curiously.

“A heart devil.” The ancestor explained: “He’ll forever be in the shadows of the king if he doesn’t come.”

“Yes.” Another senior nodded: “Princess Hanyu has been captured by the king so the emperor has no excuses to not fight since they are married on paper. His dao heart will be forever haunted by this mental devil, he won’t be able to get past it if he doesn’t come.”

“I don’t think the emperor can handle that horrifying king.” The junior lowered his volume.

Everyone stopped talking so the atmosphere became heavy.

Ultimately, the king wasn’t as strong as Ma Mingchun. Even if his supreme ancestor came along, it wouldn’t amount to anything.

“Well, we will just have to see how much of that formation the emperor has grasped.” The ancestor pondered for a bit before replying: “If he can exert its full power with the protection of his supreme ancestor, then there might be a chance. Otherwise, the probability of winning is negligible. Unfortunately, he has no choice but to come and fight.”

The youths who once admired the emperor shuddered after hearing this and didn’t know how to feel.

“What if the emperor just surrenders to the king?” Another youth had a bold thought.

The seniors glanced at each other. One of them smiled wryly and shook his head: “I’m afraid that’s impossible.”

“The emperor and the king are fire and water right now since the coup. Will the king forgive the emperor? No. Plus, a True Emperor will not submit to an enemy.” The ancestor explained.

The junior sighed disappointed upon hearing this.

Li Qiye has brought Bingchi Hanyu back to his stone hall in Great Desolate Mountain. He threw her on the bed before sealing space.

“What, what do you want?!” The pale girl quickly retreated but the area has been sealed so she was stopped by the edge.

Her black hair was a mess, same with her disorderly dress. A touch of white skin could be seen, only making the beauty even sexier and more seductive.

Li Qiye took a good look before smiling: “You tell me, what is the fate of a lamb after being cornered by a wolf?”

She trembled with horror but there was nowhere to run.

“I’ve lost, just kill me.” Her voice was shaking.

As the princess of the Bingchi, she has always been pampered as a golden daughter, getting whatever she wanted. Fear wasn’t a familiar emotion until this very moment. She found herself to be completely insignificant.

“You said I could do whatever I wanted and I certainly don’t want to kill you.” He smirked: “Don’t worry, I’m quite good at teaching women, you won’t want to leave afterward.”

The girl’s legs grew weak as she wished to be as far away from this place as possible. He looked like a devil in her eyes now, one that would bring her down the pits of darkness with no chance at redemption.

“No!” The girl still wanted to run but Li Qiye immediately grabbed her, pushing her against the wall.

“It’s impossible to run from me.” He chuckled: “Remember, a gambler needs to be prepared to pay the price. When you bet everything on the line, you should have been ready to become someone else’s toy.”

“What do you want?!” She felt danger for they were next to each other though he hasn’t done anything yet.

And he didn’t need to do anything. Just his aura alone made her feel helpless, unable to move. She could feel his invasive breath now, losing her courage to resist this dangerous man.

“You tell me.” His eyes fell on her plump breasts.

She felt as if she was standing naked before him with no place to hide. His gaze seemed to be caressing her all over, carefully enjoying her snow-white flesh, even the forbidden locations.

She thought about covering herself but a sense of futility overwhelmed her. She lost the courage to resist. The only thing she could do was cry out: “Don’t, don’t do this!”

She knew what he wanted to do. An abyss of damnation awaited her. There was no coming back.
