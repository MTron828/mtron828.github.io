Chapter 4714: The Peerless Shen Juntian

One strike ended four paragons and sixteen sovereigns. Of course, calling it one strike was rather generous since no one saw what Li Qiye did outside of diverting the flames back to the enemies.

They didn’t know whether the flames simply came from the cauldron or Li Qiye had boosted its power. Nonetheless, the state of the battlefield made it clear that this destruction was beyond their limit.

They shuddered after feeling inadequate about their own ability to protect themselves. Just a single ember from that inferno would have reduced them to ashes. Moreover, there was not one thing they could do outside of screaming in agony.

Eventually, they calmed down and focused on Li Qiye instead. They finally noticed how untouched he was.

There was not a single burn on him or his robe, let alone any sign of being suppressed. A while ago, they thought that the flames of the cauldron were superior. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This no longer seemed to be the case. It wasn’t a fair battle in the slightest since he could easily absorb them.

“How did he do it?” A big shot asked her ancestor.

The knowledgeable ancestor had an awkward smile as she answered: “I don’t know who can answer this question. To be unharmed after being swallowed by the solar cauldron… no other conquerors can do this.”

“The conquerors clearly have no chance against them, they have to work together to make it competitive.” The big shot responded.

“Everyone underestimated Li Qiye. It seems that the five conquerors are nothing, perhaps all five on the same team will still be courting death.” An ancient ancestor interjected.

“Impossible.” The big shot didn’t buy this since the conquerors were the finest seeds of this generation.

“Once again, do not underestimate Li Qiye. We might have to start comparing him to Dao Sanqian and similar beings.” The ancient ancestor sighed and said.

“Does anyone else want the immortal gemstone?” Li Qiye interrupted numerous conversations and gazed at the crowd.

Experts lowered their head, not daring to look him straight even though he didn’t have a sliver of aura.

For some unknown reasons, his very presence made them feel that he was unsurpassable just like a legendary evil mountain.

“What a monster.” An old cultivator whispered.

The highly coveted gemstone became out of reach. Everyone knew that it would be suicidal to try and rob Li Qiye.

He was simply too strong. Some had tried to discredit him before by saying that he only relied on external forces. Now, they had no choice but to admit this reality.

As they feel admiration and fear, someone descended from above. This time around, the newcomer didn’t create a pit or perform a flashy entrance.

He floated downward like an “immortal”, not the ones usually found in mortal folklore that eventually turn out to be regular cultivators. He was perfect and transcendent, unaffected by the flaws of life.

Starry lights accompanied his slow descent, making him appear to be a lotus flower. Though it grew on a dirty lake, it was still as pure as ever.

His power didn’t matter because his handsome appearance captured everyone’s attention.

“Shen Juntian!” Female cultivators shouted his name.

“I love you, I love you!” Some couldn’t help shouting at the top of their lungs. This included noble princesses and prestigious saintesses…

“It’s not an exaggeration to call him the fairest in the world.” A male cultivator said.

“Men and women with his level of aesthetic can cause wars.” One genius became sentimental.

Those who normally were proud of their appearance didn’t know what to say. Cultivators after reaching a certain level could change their appearance. However, aura and charisma couldn’t be faked.

Shen Juntian simply had an immortal presence - something impossible to duplicate. This was there since birth and strengthened with life experiences.

“Does he want to fight?” All eyes focused on Li Qiye.

Shen Juntian’s arrival was obviously not a coincidence. Not long ago, Li Qiye was only a firefly compared to him - the son of a dao lord and the disciple of Dao Sanqian.

Shen Juntian was still the same as before but now, the firefly became an entirely different creature - one capable of defeating the sun. He had zero advantages to speak of while standing before Li Qiye.

“Why would he? He has zero chance of winning.” A youth responded.

A female disciple remained optimistic and stared at Shen Juntian’s face without blinking: “Maybe he still has an ultimate technique, maybe a blessing from his father or Dao Sanqian to reverse the tides.”

Previously, the crowd would have snorted if Li Qiye dared to challenge Shen Juntian. Now, they thought that the latter would need a miracle to win.
