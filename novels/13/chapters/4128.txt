Chapter 4129: I Have Dao Lord Weapons Too

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Enough of your arrogance, Li Qiye. Money does not justify your conduct…” Illusory Princess glowered at Li Qiye and uttered coldly.

“I can be arrogant even without money but you’re right in this case, my money allows me to do whatever I want.” Li Qiye waved his hand, interrupting him.

The crowd clamored, thinking that this situation was going to escalate again.

“Seems like he’s intending on opposing Nine-wheel Citadel.” One youth said.

“This is Li Qiye’s style. The question is whether his opponent will be able to swallow their anger.” An older expert commented.

“No way they’ll be able to, would you be able to endure such insults towards your sect?” An elder asked.

Li Qiye had talked about destroying Nine-wheel Citadel before. Members of weaker sects wouldn’t stand for something like this, let alone a behemoth.

Moreover, he showed no intention of backing down after the initial offense, seemingly wanting to insult Nine-wheel Citadel whenever possible. No one from the citadel could handle this, let alone a top disciple like the princess.

She was trembling with rage, never having experienced something like this before. After all, few dared to oppose their sect in the entire continent.

If she didn’t do anything now, her sect’s prestige and reputation would be sullied.

“Li, it’s time to fight instead of just talking. If you win, I’ll drop the issue today. If you lose, I will decapitate you and take your head back to Nine-wheel Citadel as a symbol of apology.” She stepped forward and shouted. Killing Li Qiye was necessary to make an example of him.

“Here we go again, people thinking they can kill me.” Li Qiye chuckled and lazily said.

“Don’t rely on anyone else, use your own abilities against the princess! Show some courage for once!” One youth chimed in.

The majority thought that Li Qiye stood no chance when it came to cultivation and power against the princess.

In reality, few youths in Sword Continent could actually defeat the princess in an actual battle.

“Do you dare to fight me to the death?” The princess went outside and challenged.

She purposely taunted him in order to stop him from letting someone else fight in his stead. For example, Xu Yiyun or another master.

She wasn’t that confident due to him being so rich. On the other hand, she had no problem fighting him alone.

“You insist on fighting me?” Li Qiye’s smirk became wider.

Xu Yiyun knew that the princess was about to become very unlucky.

“It’s not too late to give up if you’re afraid. Apologize to Nine-wheel Citadel and slap yourself, I will show benevolence and forgive you.” The princess uttered coldly.

“Her Highness is merciful for allowing you to yield.” Another youth interjected.

Her fans were all on her side and voiced their support.

“Just give up and stay alive. There’s no point in being the richest man in the grave. Plus, it’s not embarrassing yielding to Nine-wheel Citadel.” One expert commented.

“You’ll die if you fight the princess.” Another persuaded: “Change your mind now, don’t let it all go to waste.”

A fair number of youths were vocal in their support. There was another group - people who wanted to watch a fight so they fanned the fire. It would be good for them if either side suffered serious losses. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Since everyone thinks I should yield, I have to prove myself then.” Li Qiye lazily stretched and then walked out.

Xu Yiyun and Lu Qi followed behind him. Yiyun was excited to see Li Qiye in action but Lu Qi was disinterested. The outcome was obvious.

Goldflow and Snowcloud tagged along as well. The former was neutral and only wanted to watch. As for Snowcloud, she had a serious expression, aware that Li Qiye wasn’t so simple.

Thus, she finally had the chance to watch and gauge his actual power, to understand the type of existence he truly was.

Meanwhile, Illusory Princess stood outside and glared at Li Qiye. The normally empty street was filled with spectators.

“You will be shown no mercy for your transgression against Nine-wheel Citadel. It’s your last day.” The princess threatened after seeing Li Qiye make his choice.

She served as the sect’s representative right now and must uphold its reputation. The crowd remained relatively silent, aware of the consequences of opposing a sect with four dao lords.

“Stole the words right out of my mouth. Very well, I’m bored anyway, let’s kill some time.” He smiled and said.

“Buzz. Buzz. Buzz…” He summoned several weapons and caused space to tremble.

“Rumble!” Terrifying auras of dao lord manifested into reality.

Though Li Qiye didn’t activate them with his own power, the auras still swept through the area and sent the spectators flying. The stronger experts became frozen.

“Dao lord weapons!” Some shouted in horror.

The weapons seemed to be resonating and woke each other up. Li Qiye didn’t need to do anything himself. The waves of energy eventually turned into tsunamis, making it unbearable for the crowd.

“I don’t think Nine-wheel Citadel can muster this many dao lord weapons at one time.” One jealous soul said.

“I hate rich people so much right now. I worked so hard for my sect and never got to touch one, look at him, showing them off.” Another whispered.

Behemoths such as Nine-wheel Citadel and Sea Emperor probably had just as many dao lord weapons. However, they were scattered and divided among their ancestors and regions. In this case, Li Qiye had all of them in one place.

“Are they resonating with each other?” One spectator asked because there was nothing empowering the dao lord weapons right now.

“I think so.” His friend answered.
