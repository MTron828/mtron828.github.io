Chapter 3831: The Black Water

As the two girls chatted with the old servant, Li Qiye had his eyes closed, seemingly asleep. The girls didn’t dare to bother Li Qiye despite being overwhelmed with curiosity.

He eventually opened his eyes after a while.

“What were you doing, Young Master?” Yang Ling asked. She naturally didn’t think that he was sleeping while standing.

“I was listening.” He smiled.

“Listen to what? The tides?” Yang Ling stared at the black ocean.

“No, to the screams.” He replied.

She was creeped out by this response and took one step backward while staring at the ocean: “Don’t scare me, Young Master, I don’t hear any screaming.”

Nonetheless, she started focusing but still didn’t hear anything outside of the winds and waves.

“You’re being serious?” She regained her wits and asked. There was no reason for Li Qiye to lie to her.

“You can’t hear them.” The old man said and stopped her from trying again: “Your cultivation isn’t enough so don’t bother.”

She took a deep breath after the confirmation.

The old man gazed deeper into the ocean and elaborated: “Don’t be surprised. Numerous experts have died there including supremes and dao lords. The powerful souls are still lingering, whispering and wailing...”

Both Fan Bai and Yang Ling became afraid.

“Well, what are you hearing right now, Senior?” Yang Ling inquired.

“My mind is calm so I don’t hear anything currently. But when I was in there, I heard something I shouldn’t have.” The old man revealed with a solemn expression. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“What do you mean?” Fan Bai asked.

The old man fell into rumination. He was a survivor of this ocean and never told people about his unforgettable experience.

“The voice of a dao lord.” He sighed and spoke after a while.

“A dao lord? Which one?” Yang Ling was surprised.

“Scarlet Moon Dao Lord.” Li Qiye answered instead.

Yang Ling took a deep breath. This title had a special significance in the present day.

“Senior Sister Xiaoyue’s ancestor with a tragic end.” Yang Ling murmured. There were rumors regarding the fate of this dao lord but she didn’t know about the little details.

“Right here in Black Tides. Losing and dying as a result.” Li Qiye said flatly.

The nonchalant comment still took her like a storm. Just think about it, an invincible dao lord actually losing and dying? Those who witnessed it in person would certainly be traumatized for life.

“How did it go down?” Yang Ling calmed down and asked.

The old man shook his head and refrained from speaking. The future descendants didn’t have a clear idea of this dao lord’s untimely demise.

“Fortunes and creations were stolen.” Li Qiye said vaguely.

Yang Ling was trembling as she stared at the ocean - the grave of a dao lord.

“Young Master, you can hear the last words of the doa lord?” She eventually asked.

“No, and I’m not trying to either.” He shook his head.

“Then what are you listening to?” She inquired.

“The sounds of Black Tides.” He revealed.

“What do you mean?” She only heard the winds and waves splashing onto the shore.

“The moanings of something on its last legs.” He smirked.

She had spent enough time with him to, more or less, understand what each smile implied. However, this one was indecipherable. Was he making fun of it? Or something else entirely? Nonetheless, she could feel a murderous intent from him.

“Black Tides will die? I thought that it is very scary.” Yang Ling found this hard to believe.

The seven forbidden zones were the most terrifying areas in Eight Desolaces. One of them was about to go down?

“There are various reasons but death is inevitable.” He said.

“I can’t believe this thing is alive.” She said.

“What do you think this is?” He nodded his head towards the waves below.

“Just ocean water.” She responded: “What else can it be?”

“Blood.” He answered succinctly.

This time, even the old man became startled, let alone the two girls.

“This is blood?” The old man took a deep breath.

“No-no way...” Yang Ling stared at the massive tides in disbelief. Alas, she believed him, unlike her words.

The old man didn’t dare to think about this because the hidden answer behind this would be horrifying. What happened here? Whose blood was it?

This exceeded the two girls’ imagination. Something’s blood made up this boundless ocean?

“It’ll end soon.” Li Qiye smiled coldly.

This expression of his signaled to the rest that something serious was about to happen.

They stared quietly while standing on this floating platform meant for observation. It was large enough to accommodate a thousand people or so.

There were other cultivators watching as well. The first-timers felt the same astonishment.

However, a group of soldiers came and drove them away. They had the same uniform made of expensive material. It was obvious that they were from a great clan.

“Gentlemen, sorry for the inconvenience but this place is closing soon.” The leader told the spectators.

His polite words didn’t mean that he was weak. The members of his troops all had a fierce aura.

That’s why the listeners knew that there was no room for negotiation. They needed to listen in spite of his polite tone.
