Firmaments Sword Formation, Regal Dragon Formation, and Yin Yang Gate still waiting - all of this created an unbearably tense atmosphere.

“Who’s gonna win?” This became the key question.

Even the experienced ancestors didn’t have a good answer. They stared at Li Qiye then at the armies on the other side.

In terms of troops, the princess naturally had an overwhelming advantage. They had around 100,000 capable cultivators or so with high morale.

On any other day, the ancestors would bet on this side. The formations from these three sects have been famous for their prowess, not to mention the waiting Yin Yang Gate.

However, it was difficult because Li Qiye possessed the mythical phoenix bloodline with a home-court advantage.

“He might be strong but not that strong.” Someone’s first intuition was to pick the princess’ side.

Those three sects together would be unstoppable. No sect could oppose them, let alone an individual.

“I don’t agree.” An expert was still afraid of the eruption earlier. The trueflame of a phoenix was mysterious and left a deep impression on them.

He went on with a hushed voice: “This place is filled with phoenix trueflame and he has that bloodline. No one should be able to contest this.”

According to the legends, even Skylight Dao Lord couldn’t reach the deepest part of Fire Domain. This showed the might of the flames found here.

“Hmph, maybe his bloodline is extremely thin.” A fan of the maiden and the saintess scowled, showing off his jealousy. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“He might only be able to borrow a small amount of the domain’s power, we’ll see if he can stop the three behemoths.” Another sneered.

The young ones nodded in agreement. Firmaments Sword Formation was this sect’s strongest; the regal formation has been unstoppable for Skylight as well.

Few ancestors from the big sects could hang on, let alone defeat them.

On the contrary, the princess took this very seriously. She calmly said: “We’ll have to try our best and use everything we have as a showing of respect. I also apologize for the lack of respect shown prior in our words.”

She made it clear that her allies would swarm him and use all means necessary.

“That’s fine. Use everything you have since this will be your last opportunity.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m glad to hear that.” The princess took out a treasure. It issued a buzzing noise.

“Poof!” Li Qiye’s armor immediately reacted by sending out flames towards her.

However, her treasure wasn’t for defensive purposes. It flew above Li Qiye and started rotating. It opened a portal releasing extreme coldness, enough to freeze the radius of ten thousand miles.

“Zzz-” It tried to turn Li Qiye into a statue but his lava armor had reacted earlier with the flames to stop this process.

It became a battle between fire and ice. The portal didn’t relent and continued sending the chilling affinity towards him. This was enough to freeze an entire ocean and the fabrics of reality.

Li Qiye’s flames weakened despite several attempts of surging back. The cold seemed to be having the upper hand, successfully chaining the armor.

People saw a mirror made of ice above him. On the other side of the mirror was a world of extreme yin - the origin of the cold affinity. Everything there including dao laws were frozen and Li Qiye became its prime target.

“Heavenseal Frost Mirror! A supreme weapon left behind by Skylight Dao Lord.” A golem expert became startled.

Most didn’t expect the princess to use a dao lord weapon at the start to suppress Li Qiye.

“The dao lord used this mirror to enter the domain back then.” An ancestor shuddered and felt the bone-biting chill despite the far distance.

“Impressive start, aiming for the weak spot.” A spectator saw that she didn’t waste time in using a fatal move right away. The phoenix trueflame seemed to have met its nemesis.

This mirror was one of the ace cards in treading this domain. However, she used it now to kill Li Qiye.

She spoke politely and elegantly with Li Qiye as if they weren’t enemies, completely different from the first prince. However, she wanted to kill him from the very start and hid it quite well.

It had nothing to do with her brother, only for Bai Jianchan. Intuition told her that Li Qiye would be a great threat.

“Attack!” She ordered.

The members of Yin Yang Gate obeyed. A fog of chaos emanated as they moved with lightning speed, too fast for the naked eyes.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Chains coiled around Li Qiye in the next second. They were made from five-colored divine metals, extremely resilient and impossible to be cut even by the sharpest swords.

The chains came from all directions and were too fast to dodge, completely locking Li Qiye in place. Chains from underground wrapped tightly around his legs as well.

The chains also had blade-like barbs so all of his weak spots were struck. Thus, the goal was to stop his veins and energy channeling.
