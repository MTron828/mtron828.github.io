Chapter 5595: Never Giving Up

After a dreadful explosion, War and Luminous took their battle to space. Each move crushed one star after another in an apocalyptic fashion.

Luminous couldn’t worry about anything else including maintaining the barriers back in the city. After all, his opponent was a feared ancient god whose cultivation alone was monstrous, not to mention the blessing from Celestial Court. He was the only one who currently stood a chance.

“Hahaha, dogs from Celestial Court are barking again.” A laughter came from Dao City and could be heard clearly from anywhere.

The voice was domineering and clearly displayed the speaker’s contempt toward Celestial Court.

“Boom!” The person descended, not possessing a frame as impressive as War Ancient God.

Nonetheless, he still resembled an immovable mountain. Instead of exuding an aura of cultivation or divinity, he had a boundless battle spirit.

Everyone could tell that he was ready to fight to the very end. Nothing could truly defeat him for he would rise again each time. His spirit was inextinguishable; not even death could stop him.

“War God Dao Lord!” Members of Dao City rejoiced after seeing this apex dao lord.

He was unique in that instead of just defending The People, he actively challenged Celestial Court by randomly attacking.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Of course, he would be stopped each time due to the court’s number advantage. Just one apex cultivator was far from enough to destroy Celestial Court.

He knew exactly when to retreat each time instead of lingering unnecessarily. Whenever the injuries reached a certain level, he would back off and bide his time for the next attack. This incessant aggression naturally infuriated Celestial Court.

His goal was not to reach the depths of this area or to assassinate a certain emperor but rather - personal polishment. He always came through the front entrance instead of sneaking around.

This had been his style since Eight Desolaces, hence his reputation for loving battles. His targets back then were the forbidden grounds instead of Celestial Court. This seemed to be effective because his strength continually grew.

This dao of his put an end to many top cultivators while he continued to excel.

“Clank!” He swung his blade, creating a silvery trail imbued with his battle spirit.

“Ahh!” The nearest army couldn’t stop the galaxy slash, resulting in serious casualties.

The slash continued to leave a river of blood and a mountain of bones. The average dragon lords and ancient gods were decapitated as well.

Quantity meant nothing to an apex cultivator in the absence of quality.

“Kill him!” Emperors, monarchs, dao lords, and conquerors rushed for him.

Their imperial auras erupted as they summoned powerful weapons to kill him.

“Boom!” War God remained unstoppable and pierced through a conqueror’s chest, destroying his dao fruits.

Anyone with destroyed dao fruits would be dead. However, the blessing force around the conqueror dragged his true fate back to Celestial Court in the blink of an eye.

This phenomenon showed just how magical this faction was. Regular cultivators could be obliterated in the blink of an eye. Nothing could save them then. This applied to some dragon lords and ancient gods as well.

Emperors and the like were more resilient. As long as there was a sliver of life left, they would be saved by the blessing.

“Celestial Court, what a treasure, it shall be mine one day!” War God laughed while fighting five more top cultivators at the same time; his attacks became fiercer and fiercer.

His battle spirit infected his allies who were being pressed back by the great armies due to the collapsing barriers around Dao City.

They roared courageously and pushed forward, wanting to defend their position.

“West Bank!” Some shouted, wanting to summon the imperial clan.

Unfortunately, this fell upon deaf ears.
