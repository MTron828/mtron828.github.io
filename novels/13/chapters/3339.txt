“Shu! Enough of your bullshit! You’re here to antagonize and break the pact while trying to play coy!” Fuyou was furious at the two brothers.

Many in Divine Black shared the same sentiment. This was not just a coincidence. The experts from Three Truths appeared in their territory and still had the audacity to be so aggressive?

“Fellow Daoist Liu, that is not our intention. Our sect has always obeyed the pact, can’t you see that we’ve stopped fighting? If we didn’t care about it, would you all be alive right now?” Shu Youyou smiled and shook his head.

The other side became exasperated. It was hard to argue against a stronger party. Just these brothers could suppress all of them. Thus, reasons and logic didn’t matter as much.

“However, your sect might not be sincerely upholding the pact.” Jinqiao put on a fake smile and said: “We have stopped attacking and showed our goodwill, what about you? Gathering so many people here on top of not wanting to give us the ginseng, that which belongs to us. This can only be construed as aggression.”

“This ginseng was found by us, how does it belong to you?!” Fuyou had a hot temper so he exploded while pointing at Jinqiao.

“It’s inside our territory, so it’s ours.” Jinqiao retorted, still with a smile, albeit colder. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You!” Fuyou’s expression became unsightly.

“It’s not too late to hand it over.” Youyou sneered with a murderous flash in his eyes.

“Did you hear that?” Chen Chen raised his hand and surrounded the children from Liu again. They were the weakest and would make good hostages.

“If you don’t hand it over, don’t blame us for using force since peaceful measures have failed. You pick a bloody battle, not us.” Chen Chen added.

“The audacity!” Huang Jie was furious as well since this was clearly their territory.

“Fellow Daoist Huang Jie, let the young ones deal with their problem. If you want to warm up, the two of us will be more than happy to entertain you.” The two brothers snorted.

The four seniors on Divine Black’s side frowned. They definitely couldn’t beat these two brothers due to the cultivation gap.

To be perfectly blunt, Shu Youyou alone could beat the four of them. This put the four in a terrible position, completely helpless against the two “bullies”.

“Let’s hand over the blood ginseng, there’s no lack of firewood as long as the verdant mountain is still around.” Zhan Hu told the other three.

“We’ll withdraw for now and get payback later.” Huang Ning mused for a moment and agreed.

Huang Jie and Liu Fuyou exchanged glances. They understood why this was the prudent choice but being robbed like this was so frustrating.

Of course, Huang Ning and Zhan Hu didn’t lose anything by handing the ginseng over right now. It didn’t belong to them anyway.

“I’m losing my patience. Give it here or we won’t show any mercy. Your sect will have to be picking up your corpses then.” Shu Jinqiao didn’t hold back.

“It’ll be your corpses.” A cold voice came from above.

Everyone looked up and saw a flying ship with three people standing on deck - Li Qiye, Gong Qianyue, and Lu Daowei.

“It’s Senior Sister Qianyue!” The disciples of Divine Black cheered. Some turned red from excitement while clenching their fist. Their sect had plenty of experts; Three Truths couldn’t bully them.

They have been holding back for too long because they were weaker than their opponents. Now, Gong Qianyue has arrived to be their backer.

The ones from Three Truths stared at Qianyue. The two brothers put on a serious expression.

Her fame wasn’t limited to Divine Black. She was well-known as a genius in all of northern West King. Not to mention, she was the youngest genius in the samadhi realm.

Even the aggressive Chen Chen earlier staggered backward after seeing her.

“You think you can do as you please here?” She glared at them and spoke strongly.

“Miss Gong, we have no ill-wills but your sect stole our medicine, that’s why we must retrieve it. We’ll drop the other matters.” Shu Jinqiao eventually spoke up.

“Since when does Falcon Stream belong to Three Truths?” Her eyes gleamed coldly.

“If you don’t believe me, feel free to take it up to our sect, we’ll definitely give you a proper...” Shu Youyou calmly joined in.

“Enough blabbering. Kill them and go home, I need my daily nap.” Li Qiye lazily interrupted him.

Everyone from Three Truths was paying attention to Gong Qianyue. No one noticed Li Qiye until his comment just now.

The ones from Divine Black had nothing to say since they were familiar with Li Qiye’s style. Zhan Hu and Huang Ning sneered, wanting to see the Shu Brothers teach Li Qiye a lesson.

“Impudent fool! Shut your mouth when the seniors are talking!” Chen Chen immediately shouted. In his eyes, Li Qiye was only an ordinary disciple of Divine Black. At best, the guy was Qianyue’s servant. Why would he give a damn about such a minor character?

“Kill him.” Li Qiye casually commanded.

“Don’t do it!” Both Zhan Hu and Huang Ning became startled.

“Why not?” Qianyue glared at the two.

“We need to take into consideration the peace treaty between our sects, don’t kill or it’ll lead to war.” The two looked at each other and Zhan Hu spoke up.

“War it is then, go.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve.

“This pertains to the survival of the sect, it is not up to you. Stop being so reckless!” Huang Ning shouted.

“Back off.” Qianyue told the two.

Huang Ning and Zhan Hu had no choice but to back off. They stood to the side while glaring at Li Qiye.

The Shu Brothers smiled, enjoying this internal conflict in Divine Black.

“I have a bad habit of being very partial to my own people. You dare to try and take their item? That’s courting death. Kill all of these eyesores.” Li Qiye turned his sight towards the opponents.

They naturally became livid after being shown such disdain.
