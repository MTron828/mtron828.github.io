Chapter 4651: Love For Battle

Tian Feng’s battle intent remained unbearable for those nearby. The young emperor from True Immortal had an innate charisma and regal quality to him. As for Tian Feng, his overbearing presence forced others to the ground and crushed them in a direct and brutal manner. It removed the processes in the middle and went straight to instilling fear and pain.

Fighting was the essence of Tian Feng, always unavoidable regardless of how powerful his enemies were. He focused his battle intent solely on Li Qiye, wanting to destroy him.

This didn’t affect Li Qiye who smiled and said: “Are you up for the challenge?”

“I’m not interested in this marriage competition, I only want the peerless treasure, no need for this sham.” Tian Feng laughed.

This was akin to slapping everyone in the face since this was obviously their plan. Of course, they didn’t deny or admit this matter.

It would be foolish to antagonize Tian Feng since this could end with countless battles. The sect might become involved as well. The only way to end this was to kill him.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t that easy to kill one of the five conquerors. It would be easier dealing with True Immortal Young Emperor since he could be reasoned with after surrendering and admitting faults.

“I want to fight you to the death right now.” Tian Feng didn’t hide his intention and laughed heartily: “Not doing so would be a true shame.”

“He’s a target now, nothing good will come out of it.” One cultivator said.

“It was only a matter of time since Li Qiye is insane too. Tian Feng always likes to test himself.” A big shot quietly said.

“To the death? You will be the loser for certain.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hahaha, we’ll see about that, I’ve always taken on stronger opponents.” Tian Feng said: “You are worth the risk but that depends on your true ability. If you’re not capable enough, your end shall be horrific.”

He wasn’t trying to threaten or diminish Li Qiye’s morale. The words came from the heart.

Nonetheless, people became afraid because the way Tian Feng fought was rather barbaric. His victims didn’t die right away; some dismemberments were usually involved.

“You’re quite confident.” Li Qiye said.

“Not at all, I don’t think I am winning because this is so close to Worldbreaker and you can borrow its power. Nonetheless, I will never miss the chance to fight such an opponent.” Tian Feng gazed at Li Qiye like a wolf fixated on a prey.

Others pondered and agreed with him. Li Qiye’s own power didn’t matter. Everything changed the moment he revealed his card - being able to borrow the power of Worldbreaker. It made him unimaginably powerful because the fist intents there were endless. No one knew the exact extent of its true power nor Li Qiye’s borrowing limit.

In spite of this, Tian Feng still wanted to fight.

“It has been a long time since my blood is boiling like this.” He said while seemingly wanting to tear Li Qiye apart and then devour him. His bloodthirst made others tremble in fear.

“You are far more interesting than the other so-called conquerors.” Tian Feng said: “For the sake of the final battle to prove their dao, they play it so safe and do not risk anything, going as far as always hiding their strength and ace cards. Calculating, scheming, living while holding back, what a terrible way to live.”

He didn’t seem to care about offending all of his peers. This prompted many to stare at the young emperor. However, he also didn’t mind the comments.

Of course, they didn’t take it to heart because the young emperor was clearly strong, not someone with empty fame. Some also agreed with his way of life.

In fact, only one fight truly mattered for the heirs - the one right before becoming a dao lord. The opponents were everyone else in the world. Winning meant obtaining the ultimate glory.

Geniuses and their sects planned for years. Some hid their true power or avoided any potential complications such as lasting injuries and damages to their dao.

Therefore, the conquerors avoided fighting with powerful cultivators. This wasn’t out of the question at all. Tian Feng was a rare case who didn’t mind injuries or even dying in battle.

“Do you not want to become a dao lord? You have to stay alive first.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Of course I wish to become the dao lord. That is the reason why I fight and fight. However, I believe that those who tread carefully won’t become one. If they don’t even have the courage to fight or the determination to prove their dao, how can they become one? There is no way a coward will find success, only warriors.” Tian Feng responded and his battle intent surged to the sky.

The crowd exchanged glances again and found his belief to be logical as well. Other conquerors chose to avoid unwinnable fights and trained to become stronger first. Acting recklessly was not acceptable. On the other hand, could a coward become the dao lord? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Not entirely correct but close enough.” Li Qiye smiled and praised.
