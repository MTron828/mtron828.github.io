Chapter 5118: Dark Hand

“Activate!” Greenmountain didn’t give up and used his wheel again.

The cracks became more apparent as time oozed out. The seal of the divine treasury and the remnant epoch could be seen above. It contained stars, mechanical giants, and wondrous cultivators…

“Rumble!” Everything then turned into a temporal maelstrom. A hand reached out from the center - one that has been corroded by darkness for years and years.

The dao of the lower continents shuddered at its appearance. It could easily crush everyone to death along with the world.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

People wanted to scream but the sheer pressure from the hand left them speechless and immobile.

“Bam!” However, Li Qiye easily stopped it with one hand.

Greenmountain couldn’t believe it because this was a power capable of contending against a twelve-fruit conqueror.

“Little cockroach, you think that you are unbeatable just because you have a taste of the darkness.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Even if the old geezer comes back to life during his prime, I can still slay him, let alone you.”

“Crack!” With that, he forcefully pulled the hand down.

“Ahh!” Greenmountain bellowed in agony because he was one with Chrono Disk. This was akin to his own hand being pulled down.

Fear stopped him from worrying about the pain. He immediately turned to run only to see Li Qiye standing in front of him.

He got the illusion that the entire world was blocked. His speed and direction no longer mattered. Crossing through the dimensions wouldn’t let him get away either. The only way was to kill Li Qiye.

“Fine!” He roared and decided to go all out.

“Crack!” The cracks on the wheel became wider, releasing boundless temporal and life energies. These affinities were turned into darkness to empower Greenmountain.

Time made his body wither while life revitalized him. The darkness began devouring his body - the start of an endless cycle.

However, his body started cracking because he was not strong enough to withstand the true power of Chrono Disk.

Because of this, the wheel itself broke into little pieces and latched onto his broken body, keeping it together.

“Ahh!” This process was agonizing but he started growing exponentially.

Despite being large enough to trample the land, he still couldn’t withstand the dark power. His face twisted in pain but at the very least, he could control it now.

“Fool, this is suicidal.” Li Qiye sneered after seeing this.

“I will obliterate you and this world!” Greenmountain shouted thunderously.

“Samsara Fist!” He punched downward. Just the sheer shockwaves alone could turn all living beings into dust.

Therefore, Li Qiye had to take action. He leaped into the air and punched the gigantic fist. The technique represented his supreme will, capable of piercing the high heaven itself.

“Boom!” The colossal punch was nothing before Li Qiye.

Not only did he manage to stop the devastating attack, but he also disassembled the armor plates around the giant.

The pieces gathered together and soared into the air while Greenmountain lost everything. An eight-fruit conqueror such as himself stood no chance against the punch.

It pierced his chest and slammed him down to the ground. The fruits became resplendent and activated their dao in an attempt to stop Li Qiye.

They could block a barrage from numerous imperial-level weapons. Alas, Li Qiye easily crushed it as well and impaled Greenmountain through the chest.

Meanwhile, the fragmented wheel became whole again and tried to escape. Unfortunately, Li Qiye caught it in no time at all.

It trembled in his hand, seemingly possessing sentience and intelligence.

He stared at it and smiled: “I spared you once before but this is a rather foolish mistake.”

With that, he pushed his hands together.

“Ahh!” The wheel bellowed before wanting to implode with the power of an epoch. However, Li Qiye easily contained this inside his palms, not allowing absolute destruction to spread.

“Crack!” Eventually, he reduced the artifact to dust. He let go and the specks scattered to the wind.
