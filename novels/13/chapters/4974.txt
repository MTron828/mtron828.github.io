Chapter 4975: Shadowrider

Eating a top cultivator was definitely a problem with a dao aspect. Firstly, the premise was virtually impossible to carry out in terms of capabilities. Secondly, this was absolutely evil. Anyone doing this would face persecution from the rest of the world.

Devouring others to increase strength was unforgivable. No one wanted to see a proliferation of such an art.

Thus, if this hunter actually had this ability, how did they learn it? This was the reason why Li Qiye was interested - wanting to find the source.

“Schoolmaster, hire Shadowrider.” Li Qiye said lazily.

“Well…” The schoolmaster found himself in quite a predicament. If something were to actually happen, he wouldn’t be able to solve the situation.

“It’s too dangerous.” Jian Yunyun and Ming Shi strongly opposed hiring Shadowrider - an assassin capable of killing even stronger cultivators.

“Not at all, an ant with sharp teeth is still only an ant.” Li Qiye smiled.

The schoolmaster stared at him before nodding: “If this is your wish, Young Noble, I will hire Shadowrider. However, I am not responsible for whatever happens next.”

He agreed because Li Qiye had killed five dragon lords recently. Although this was due to the dao controller, Li Qiye was obviously not a normal person.

Most importantly, he had the fortune of meeting their supreme existence. This alone proved his worth and made the risk acceptable.

“I’m counting on you.” Li Qiye smiled and stared at the horizon: “Let’s see if a blind cat will come across a dead mouse this time.”

His goal was to find Twilight Hunter - one of the most elusive beings in history. He thought that this was somehow related.

The two girls remained worried. What if Li Qiye couldn’t react in time during an ambush? Alas, they couldn’t change his mind.

“Please be careful.” The schoolmaster said despite trusting Li Qiye due to his fear of Shadowrider. With that, he left to carry out his mission.

As the night settled in at the academy, a sense of calm enveloped the surroundings, lending a peaceful and serene quality to the atmosphere. Above, the stars twinkled brilliantly, casting a mesmerizing spell on all gazers.

Li Qiye sat atop a peak, admiring the stars while swaying his feet. Yunyun came and sat down next to him.

“She left?” Li Qiye glanced at her and smiled.

It turned out that although Ming Shi worried about Li Qiye, Untethered has been calling for her return. She had no choice but to leave, not wanting to disobey her master.

“She told me to take good care of you, Young Noble.” Yunyun nodded.

“She’s exceptionally very kind, this grants her ample fortune so her future will be brighter than yours.” Li Qiye smiled.

Yunyun didn’t expect Li Qiye to be so blunt. Nonetheless, she wasn’t jealous of Ming Shi because her friend was indeed innocent and kind.

“She has always been like that.” Yunyun said.

“It’s not easy to stand straight all the time, it has a lot to do with one’s background and upbringing. Those who live under the sunlight are filled with sunshine. Alas, few can keep this brightness forever.”

“I see.” Yunyun murmured.

“The academy is a great place. It might not be perfect but in terms of cultivation alone, it is far purer than many sects and kingdoms.” Li Qiye commented.

“Right.” Yunyun nodded in agreement.

This was the reason why students and alumni loved the academy. This included the geniuses from the great powers.

This was one of the last bastions of cultivation. Students from both The People and The Race appreciated this purity and usually gave back.

“You should know that even if you can obtain that thing again, it might not revitalize Primal.” Li Qiye told her.

“I know, the reason why I want to get it back is so that you can take a look.” Yunyun said.

“Why?” He asked.

“I don’t know. When I saw that throne back in Eight-stallion and how you controlled the flames, I suddenly felt that I was there to meet you.” She responded.

“This is fate.” He smiled and gazed at the sky.

“Could be, who knows?” She smiled wryly. Though this item was pivotal to Primal, she somehow wanted to show it to an outsider.

“I know, because I am connected to your progenitor.”

“To our progenitor?” Yunyun was surprised because they themselves had no idea who their progenitor was.

“A great and insightful figure, no one was wiser than your progenitor among the diviners.” Li Qiye said.

“So you do know our progenitor, Young Noble.” She became curious.

“Your progenitor-” Li Qiye noticed something and smirked.

“Bam!” A dark spear penetrated his chest and sent him off the cliff before she could react.

It pinned him into the base and caused her to stand up and scream in horror: “Young Noble!” 

She saw a figure - a person riding a night beast.

The creature was mighty and large, yet it blended in with the darkness of the night, emitting no discernible aura. Its existence seemed to rhyme with invisibility.

Mounted on its back was a rider, shrouded in a black cloak that concealed even their gender. The rider's weapon of choice was a black spear, devoid of any glimmer or shine, making it the perfect instrument for carrying out assassinations.

“Shadowrider!” Yunyun instantly knew who this person was.

The assassin was efficient indeed, already carrying out the task after being hired by the schoolmaster.

She looked down at Li Qiye who was on the ground and shouted: “Young Noble, are you okay?!”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Shadowrider was surprised to see his victim sitting back up.

“Sigh, already stabbing before an introduction, how uncouth. An assassin should act properly and cool.” Li Qiye patted his clothes and complained.
