Chapter 5087: I Need No Reason

“Who dares intrude on our holy mountain?!” A deafening shout resounded.

A large figure appeared with a dao waterfall behind him. Lightning halos pulsed around him, making him look like a lightning god.

“The Gate Guardian, Lightning Burial!” The members of the sect shouted after seeing him, a dragon lord with five sacred fruits.

“State your name!” He shouted at Li Qiye.

However, Li Qiye ignored him and continued forward.

“Die then!” Lightning Burial unleashed a torrent of lightning at Li Qiye, wanting to incinerate him.

“Scram!” Li Qiye raised his foot and stomped down, releasing a monstrous force.

“Boom!” The lightning torrent was instantly crushed.

The dragon lord roared and gathered the strength to stop the stomp. Alas, this was completely useless regardless of his merit laws.

“Ahh!” He screamed before being reduced to a mist of blood.

Members of Heaven Burial couldn’t believe their eyes. A dragon lord with five fruits was killed with one stomp?

“How dare you?!” Three figures appeared above the mountain and shouted furiously. Their halos could uphold numerous worlds.

“Heaven Burial Trinity!” An ancestor from the sect shouted.

The three were pillars of the lineage. Normally, they focused on their cultivation but this intrusion forced them out.

“You have committed an unforgivable crime! Only death…” One of them roared while sending down the halos.

“Scram.” Li Qiye responded in the same way and waved his hand.

“Boom!” The halos instantly exploded into particles.

“Ahh!” They couldn’t finish their threat before the slap came and turned them into blood.

They were killed as if they were mosquitoes. Countless disciples were scared out of their mind and fell to the ground.

“Who is he?!” They shouted, wanting to flee.

“That’s… that’s Li Qiye!” A top dragon lord said with fear.

Li Qiye had just defeated Conceal Conqueror. Why was he here now?

Fear overwhelmed the sect. How did they offend Li Qiye?

“Just run!” Most didn’t have the courage to fight him since he could kill them with a single gaze.

“Formation!” The ancient ancestors weren’t willing to see their sacred ground tainted. Thus, they started the strongest formations.

Pillars of light soared into the air along with halos stacking on each other, resulting in an impressive display of might.

Alas, Li Qiye pulled the halos out of the formation and tossed them away, causing the ancient ancestors in charge to roll on the ground.

“Sir, why must you attack us?” A different ancient ancestor appeared. The others got up and gathered behind him.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He had a total of three halos behind him. Their combination could create the yin and yang for a reincarnation cycle.

“Three-ring Blade!” A crowd has arrived at this point to watch the show.

Peerless big shots took a deep breath after seeing him.

“This old geezer is still here, neither dead nor ascended.” One of them became startled.

“Another with seven sacred fruits. We got two.” Someone else commented.

Everyone knew about Stone Ox but now, here was another one.

“I don’t need a reason.” Li Qiye answered nonchalantly.

“Then you need to ask my sword first!” The ancient ancestor fused his halos together to form a heavenly sword. Sword energies rampaged the continents and intimidated everyone.

“Die!” The ancient ancestors behind him released their vitality and energy, summoning all of their weapons.

Li Qiye responded by smashing the formational halos at them. This had enough weight and power to crush devils and gods.

Three-ring Blade panicked and raised his sword to block it. The other ancient ancestors followed his lead.

“Crack!” Alas, their best weapons and merit laws amounted to nothing before Li Qiye.

“Ahh!” All of them screamed and became meat pastes, no exception.

Disciples from Heaven Burial became aghast after seeing the destruction of their mightiest ancient ancestors.
