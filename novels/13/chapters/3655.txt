Chapter 3656: Untethered Monk

This time, the golden spring appeared in a public square. People were packed with sardines.

They had different goals in coming here, either to test their luck or just to watch the fun. Only a little room was left by the entrance for more to enter.

Of course, workers from Wish Ward were present in mass in order to maintain order.

A while ago, the square was completely empty. Now, a spring could be seen. The spouting water wasn’t too high.

Nonetheless, people were interested right away due to the colors of the spring - golden, cornelian, halcyon...

People couldn’t avert their gaze from the colorful spectacle. It was as if numerous treasures were hidden beneath, too many pearls and jewels to count.

That’s why the water was dyed with various colors. The individual beads of water resembled rolling pearls.

Deeper inside was an old room from an archaic era. The wooden door shut tightly, seemingly from inside. Nonetheless, it looked feeble enough to be broken with a little force.

Who knows what was behind the door? Alas, it was definitely something incredible to be paired alongside the golden spring.

“So the spring does exist.” One cultivator watched in awe.

“Just one touch might give us all the wealth in the world.” The experts were salivating, wanting to give it a shot.

Unfortunately, the workers of Wish Ward stopped them.

“What’s the meaning of this? Does Wish Ward want to monopolize the spring? It doesn’t belong to them!” Someone became furious.

“This might be your territory but it doesn’t mean the spring belongs to you? Why are you stopping people from trying?!” Another shouted.

A crowd clamored, unhappy with this treatment.

“Amitabha, Merciful Buddha.” A dignified chant suddenly echoed. Everyone clearly heard it in their ears.

This lasted for a long time and gave the impression of a thousand Buddhas present in the crowd.

A monk emerged and astonished the crowd. First, the holy chants alone made people know that a great monk was coming.

Unfortunately, this person had nothing to do with the word “great”. He was overweight and with each step, his fat would shake. He wasn’t wearing a regular kasaya either but a robe with all colors - red, yellow, violet, green...

Though he looked anything but a monk, his bright smile immediately made everyone like him. In fact, he could slap someone on one side then again on the other side; their anger would still subside after seeing his smile.

“That’s Untethered Monk, the Chief Manager of Wish Ward.” Those who knew him shouted.

In fact, many big shots from the previous generations came forward to greet him.

The monk smiled and greeted everyone. The atmosphere became jubilant right away. The unhappy crowd was infected with a joyous mood.

“He’s a legend.” One big shot said.

“Is he famous?” A youth asked curiously.

The big shot nodded: “Extremely, most likely peerless in his generation.”

“Really? How does he compare to the four grandmasters?” The youth was skeptical.

“He is the senior brother of Wisdom Sacred Monk, the favorite disciple of Samantabhadra Elder.” The big shot gave him the side-eye.

“What?!” The juniors nearby couldn’t believe it. One stammered: “He, he’s the monk of wisdom’s senior brother?”

“Yes.” The big shot nodded to everyone’s astonishment.

The monk of wisdom was one of the four grandmasters. His cultivation was one thing but most importantly, his Buddhist attainment has reached an incredible level. Even Buddha Supreme praised him for his achievements.

Many thought that the student has surpassed the teacher - an indication of his wisdom. On the other hand, his senior brother looked so different.

“I thought Samantabhadra Elder’s favorite disciple is the monk of wisdom?” One youth asked directly.

“No, it’s actually Untethered Monk. No one could beat him when it came to dao arguments, not even the monk of wisdom.” The big shot shook his head.

“What?” The youths couldn’t believe it. This fat monk actually bested the monk of wisdom regarding Buddhism?

“The monk of wisdom’s talent was top-notch too. Not to mention ordinary people like us, the four grandmasters can’t match Untethered Monk.” Another older cultivator smiled and revealed.

So this fat monk turned out to be superior to the four grandmasters in terms of Buddhism and cultivation talent? The young ones were stunned.

“How did he turn out like this?” One youth asked.

“He has always been like this.” The old cultivator smiled: “This genius went out dining, wining, whoring, and gambling.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This line shook the youths even more. A monk from Heavenly Dragon Temple with boundless potential chose to be a young master?

Just think about it, top geniuses were usually transcending and flawless. Now, this monk seemed more vulgar than regular mortals. The flaws most mortals didn’t have; he possessed them all. The old monks at Heavenly Dragon Temple must be exasperated with this genius.

Rumor has it that his Buddhist title was given to him by his master. The latter hoped that he would eventually surpass Buddha Supreme, also known as Ruleless Monk.

Others refuted this speculation. They thought that he himself chose his title because he wanted to follow the footsteps of Ruleless Monk.

No one knew the actual answer. However, later on, he decided to leave Heavenly Dragon Temple and became a waiter in Wish Ward.

Now, his role was the Chief Manager of Wish Ward in charge of its resources and finance. This was another interesting development.

Moreover, Heavenly Dragon Temple didn’t consider him a traitor either. They didn’t banish him from their doctrine, seemingly giving him permission to do what he pleases.

All of this culminated in a peculiar legend - Untethered Monk.
