Chapter 5068: Found A Gigantic Tree

Li Qiye chatted with Immortal Emperor Jin She for a long while regarding certain crucial topics. Eventually, Li Qiye stood up and waved at Ming Shi who was still having fun.

She hasn’t had enough but still jumped down from the unicorn and returned: “These unicorns are too cute.”

“They are born with the holy affinity and regular people can’t get close, let alone play with them. Miss, perhaps you are connected with this place by fate and can obtain a fortune here.” The young emperor said.

“Doesn’t seem too bad.” She stroked her chin and thought about how she truly liked this place.

“Should I stay here?” She couldn’t help asking Li Qiye.

“All the fortunes here are up for grabs.” Li Qiye said: “If you want to, you can pick this one.”

“Mmm, forget it, I want to look at the other places too.” She tilted her head for a bit before responding: “Young Noble, what’s your destination? I want to see it too.”

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer.

“You should take a look, Sir.” The youth told him: “The ancestral dragon is still young so you should make the decision for the future’s sake.”

He seemed to actually be interested in this matter.

“Everyone has been working hard, it seems.” Li Qiye smiled.

The youth nodded in response: “They’re trying to look for a new path, giving birth to a new world from the remnant of an old one.”

“I understand.” Li Qiye responded.

The youth’s last worries disappeared after seeing Li Qiye. After all, no one was more suitable to deal with these issues than him.

“Miss, if you are also looking for a fortune, there is a dried root over yonder that is worth your time.” The youth told Tendril King before they left.

Li Qiye nodded: “Might as well take a look, you deserve something to make this worth your time.”

“I wonder if I will get to see you again, Sir, or I’ll be dead from old age next time you’re back. Nonetheless, to have met you in this life was an honor.” The youth bowed to bid farewell.

“Take care.” Li Qiye said before leaving with the two women.

The emperor watched until they disappeared from sight before returning to his region. He - an unbeatable Immortal Emperor and a legendary founder god - chose to live reclusively away from the outside world.

This wasn’t a bad ending for a cultivator who has grown tired of needless bloodshed and death. Though he was stained with blood and flames, now he was able to live innocently like a child.

The trio followed the emperor’s direction and crossed through wondrous landscapes - stars and various affinities shaping up physical realms…

They saw both destruction and rebirth along the way - from nothingness came something.

This rebuilding process was easier said than done. After all, there were fragments and damages everywhere after the calamity.

Eventually, they made it to a continent with broken stars and large chasms on the ground. It was actually larger than the lower continents.

Their destination was a basin, looking like the aftermath of a volcano from afar. Once they got closer, they could tell that it might have been the result of a crashing meteor.

“This is it?” Ming Shi looked around and only saw scorched earth - the opposite of her expectation.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

This was drastically different from God Ape Dao Lord and Immortal Emperor Jin She’s place. Anyone would pick the previous locations instead of this one.

“It’s peculiar.” Tendril King noticed something due to her impressive cultivation.

“Buzz.” After a green glow, she summoned a vine and drilled it into the ground. She then closed her eyes to feel the land.

Something flashed back from underground. This faint glow alone made her sense an unimaginable level of life force.

“Boom!” She wanted to drill deeper but was instantly pushed into the air.

Li Qiye caught her and said: “It’s not easy obtaining the fortune here, it will take a long, long time.”

“This is exactly what I’m looking for!” She became excited.

“Senior Aunt, what looms beneath?” Ming Shi asked.

“The source of all trees, how incredible, it felt withered though.” Tendril King explained.

“It is a divine tree that has withered, so you’re right. We’re standing on one of its roots right now.” Li Qiye smiled.

“One root?” Ming Shi took a deep breath and gazed at the massive continent: “It is massive, just how large was this tree then? It probably took up the whole sky.”

They saw gigantic trees back in Demon since that region had the largest forest in the lower continents. Of course, none could compare to this tree if she was imagining it correctly.

“It might just take up all of our three continents, maybe more.” Tendril King said.

“Yes, this once shouldered an entire world. Now, there are only fragments left.” Li Qiye said.

“So this was a world tree?” Tendril King realized that she was still underestimating it.

“What destroyed this divine tree then?” Ming Shi gasped. This must be a power far beyond her comprehension.

“Certain existences stretching their greedy hands.” Li Qiye looked up at the sky and said, causing the two women to shudder.

“This fortune is suitable for you. It doesn’t matter which path you pick, reversing to the source or utilizing the grand dao. This tree can allow you to reach the truth.” Li Qiye added.

“I understand.” Tendril King said: “I will stay here for a long period and will do my best to not let you down, Young Noble.”

This place was everything she hoped for with regard to improving her cultivation.
