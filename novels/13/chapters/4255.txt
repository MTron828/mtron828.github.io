Chapter 4256: One Slash Nine Dao

“H-he’s still alive!” Eyes widened in disbelief.

“He survived two comprehension strikes!” A high elder gasped.

“Not just that, he’s completely untouched.” An ancestor nearby added.

Words couldn’t describe the emotion of the crowd right now. The devastation from two comprehension strikes should have been unstoppable.

The overlords themselves would either be crippled or dead after facing this. Thus, using the word “monster” wasn’t enough to describe Li Qiye.

The duo’s expression darkened, realizing the grim situation. They felt that something terrible was about to happen.

During their defeat earlier, they didn’t feel any despair. After all, there were still other methods from their sects. It wasn’t the end of the road just yet. Now, the situation was far more serious than they expected.

They exchanged glances, looking pale and lacking confidence.

“How did he do it? Don’t tell me Myriad Era and its dao are that strong?” One ancestor commented.

“So it’s just far superior to the other eight?” An ancient king replied.

“Perhaps, but then again, it might be due to Finality Scripture.” A big shot joined in.

All in all, no one had a good answer. Alas, Li Qiye did something that no one else could do - withstand two comprehension strikes without an injury.

“Comprehension strikes are not bad. Unfortunately, you’re no dao lords. Power and foundation aren’t sufficient to make up for the lack of dao fruit empowerment.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Wait, is he saying that a real comprehension strike is stronger?” Others thought about it.

Everyone assumed that those two strikes were as strong as can be, similar to a version dished out by a dao lord. Li Qiye seemed to disagree.

The big shots smiled wryly and shook their head. One of them said: “How many actually saw the real thing? Dao lords probably didn’t need to use Comprehension.”

Others agreed with him. Dao lords were unstoppable already and didn’t need to use ultimate attacks.

“My turn.” Li Qiye smirked and raised Myriad Era to the horror of his enemies.

Even a slight movement from him at this point was awfully intimidating. A random swing could decapitate the gods and was far more threatening than supreme sword arts.

“Go!” The duo roared crazily and activated the sword formation and halos again.

A storm of vitality and energy took over, causing the region to shake violently. The world had a hard time containing the two sects’ activated foundation.

“Boom!” The auras of the dao lord took over again, suppressing the firmaments and infiltrating every inch of the land.

“Saber to Swords!” The venerable roared.

“Nine-wheel Cycle!” The vajra followed right after without holding back.

Two comprehension strikes appeared again, just as daunting and terrifying as before. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Again?!” Many screamed in astonishment.

Though the strikes were useless against Li Qiye earlier, the duo had no choice but to try again. They relied on pure force in order to stop Li Qiye.

“One slash, nine dao.” Li Qiye chuckled and swung vertically.

Nine dao manifested into reality. They didn’t create flashy explosions and unending gales. Just their presence alone made everything else insignificant.

They appeared to be eternal, surpassing both time and space. Eventually, they would become the only things left in existence. Comprehension strikes and dao lord auras were nothing in comparison, as ephemeral as a single breeze.

The pressure from the two strikes disappeared and the spectators were at ease again, no longer suppressed and immobilized.

“One slash, nine dao?” They repeated the title of this sorcerous technique - a king while all other swords arts and merit laws were mere peasants.
