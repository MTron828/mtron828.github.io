Chapter 4326: Plan

Though the heir of Lion’s Roar traveled without fanfare, his reputation still eclipsed the young lord of Dragon.

Though Lion’s Roar was on a path of decline, its status in the south was still unshakable. Dragon couldn’t replace its position in everyone’s heard just yet.

Therefore, the heir’s arrival became the main conversation topic in all the camps. No one from the small sects had seen him before. Alas, the majority spoke of him with reverence.

Meanwhile, the young lord of Dragon initiated a meeting regarding the black fog.

“The darkness is emerging to destroy the world. It is our responsibility to stop it.” His voice echoed across the ward: “Deliberation is necessary in order to activate the divine altar and seal it once more into the depth of the mountain range.”

Everyone heard him clearly.

“This is correct.” A young sect master felt optimistic about this command.

After all, the activated barrier could destroy the fog, saving all the sects in the southern region.

“The altar is created by the Supreme Monarch herself, I don’t think the young lord alone has enough power to activate it.” An expert from a great power quietly said.

A peer from a different sect replied: “That’s why he sent out the message earlier, he wants everyone to lend their power for the activation.”

“He’ll use this to build his reputation too.” A disciple from a prestigious clan commented.

“Shh, stop talking.” A senior shushed him right away.

The disciple couldn’t help but speak: “I’m just stating facts. Dragon has been challenging Lion’s Roar for a while now, especially after Peacock Monarch’s rise and matchless nature…”

The disciple was correct. Under his leadership, Dragon became a force to be reckoned with while coming straight for Dragon’s Roar.

Now, the young lord of Dragon wanted to lead the crowd. This seemed rather understandable.

“He has to beat the heir if he wants to lead Southern Desolace.” A fellow clan member responded: “This is the perfect opportunity since both of them are here. A mountain can’t have two tigers. The young lord took the initiative to start, wanting to prove that he’s superior…”

“Enough!” The senior scolded: “It’ll be problematic if others hear this conversation.”

Ultimately, the young lord’s decision was analyzed in secrecy by virtually every sect present.

“So the young lord and saintess of Dragon came first, then the heir of Lion’s Roar came too, I think this won’t be so simple.” An elder from a small sect speculated.

“Right, they never sent any big shot here before. So is the conference viewed as a contest for the two behemoths?” The sect master replied.

The smaller sects’ information network was far lacking compared to the upper echelon. Nonetheless, they still caught wind of the current contest between the two behemoths. This could decide their fate so they tried their best to ask for more information.

“It’s best not to comment. All I know is, when immortal fights, mortal suffer.” An old elder whispered: “Just watch quietly and don’t pick a side, otherwise, we’ll be dead without a burial. We’re nothing more than air in this contest.”

Older cultivators usually exercised prudence and didn’t dare to be reckless. After all, the countless smaller sects in the south were mere insects compared to the behemoths.

All in all, the sudden meeting stirred plenty of speculation and gossip. Nonetheless, all sects still participated on time.

Both the small sects and the great powers needed to give Dragon face. As for the former, this wasn’t an actual choice. They had to participate lest risking an early death.

At the major field in the ward, the representatives of the great powers sat on top. The ones from the small sects have arrived long ago but waited below.

Of course, they had no say in this matter and were only present to add to the atmosphere.

The saintess of Dragon was here early as well, standing next to the main seat. She had ordered disciples to arrange the various logistics of the meeting.

Though she wasn’t as famous as the young lord, she was still highly praised. This was especially true among the young generation where she had many male fans.

Most importantly, she was polite and attentive to all sects. Her non-discriminating conduct was well-received. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Crystal Dragon Young Lord has arrived!” A powerful cultivator roared.

A battalion from Dragon entered the field. A fierce aura made everyone gasp but then, they remembered to start cheering and clapping.

The young lord walked powerfully onto the stage and only stared at the crowd with disdain.

“His aura is insane.” Putting his attitude aside, both his fans and haters had to admit that he was mighty.

He climbed up the platform and sat down on the main seat. He then waved his hand and said: “Gentlemen, no need for formalities.”

Everyone else sat down and stared at him. He didn’t speak right away.

“The heir of Lion’s Roar isn’t here yet.” Someone in the audience noticed something and whispered.

All the sects have gathered for this meeting initiated by the young lord of Dragon yet the heir wasn’t here. This made people more sure about the unspoken contest between Dragon and Lion’s Roar.

“Gentlemen, I summon everyone here for an important matter.” The young lord didn’t wait for the heir and continued: “Darkness has emerged from the deeper in the mountain range. We must work together to suppress it.”

Others exchanged glances. They already knew that he wanted to use the altar. However, activating it seemed improper when the representative of Lion’s Roar wasn’t here. After all, it was built by the Supreme Monarch of Lion’s Roar.

“Your plan is correct, young lord.” Deer King was the first to speak up for his master: “The darkness knows nothing of mercy. We are willing to follow you as you take the vanguard against the storm.”

If his master could become the next ruler of Dragon, his status would soar as well.

Gao Qixin didn’t miss this chance either. He stood up and said: “Young Lord, you are insightful and benevolent, only thinking about the wellbeing of the world. Maple Ravine wishes to represent the smaller sects of Southern Desolace in support of you.”

It wasn’t easy for him to enter Dragon so he wanted to flatter the young lord for a brighter future. Some of the smaller sects voiced their support.

Alas, a few thought differently and became worried. They didn’t want to get involved in this political struggle between Lion’s Roar and Dragon.

In the case of war, those who picked a side would be the first to suffer. Thus, they refrained from saying anything.

Gao Qixin at least had a backer right now in Dragon. They, on the other hand, had no roots and joining this mess was too risky.
