Chapter 4271: Mighty Swords But I'm Still Stronger

There was a dao portal floating at the center of the cauldron. It seemed to be made from the oldest stones, already existing at the start of the world. The structure itself looked regular and untouched by time. Only the spatial passage was radiant with five different colors.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye appeared at the entrance and walked through. There was no danger going through the passage but the moment he got out, he was met with numerous destructive slashes.

“Not bad.” Li Qiye said and activated his supreme laws again, becoming the ultimate ruler of Eight Desolaces and looming above all else.

“Boom!” He easily stopped the closest slash with his bare hand.

More swords came with incredible might; each capable of slaying the likes of Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra.

These slashes were the definition of invincibility and the apex of the sword dao. Cultivators in the outside world stood zero chance, whether it be the greatest geniuses or the experienced ancestors.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Alas, Li Qiye was a cosmic-level entity. Each wave of the hand repelled the incoming slashes.

Yes, he has arrived in the last domain - Sword World. This place rejected invaders and immediately attacked.

The fabrics of reality shattered before the slashes, leaving behind spatio-temporal maelstroms and black holes. Just one misstep would result in a terrible death.

Meanwhile, it seemed that the onslaught of blades was endless and could last for an eternity. They also became increasingly stronger and stacked on top of each other. The power was unlimited. Eventually, even the mightiest master would falter before the barrages.

This was the reason why Supreme Sovereigns didn’t last long in Sword World. The first four domains weren’t worth mentioning compared to the danger here.

There were deep abysses on the ground and unstable continents. On a particular one was the corpse of a relatively young man. It exuded the radiance of a dao lord bloodline.

The cause of death was a direct thrust piercing his heart. There was a badge hanging on the waist with the characters, “bestowed by Blessed.” That’s right, even the dao child of Blessed Dao Lord fell in this place.

Another notable corpse floating in the air belonged to a draconic tiger. Its colossal body was split into two halves. Nonetheless, one could still recognize an ancient character written on its forehead - Profound. This meant that it was a king of the Profound True Tiger species.

In a remnant space was a heavenly woman with a hole on her forehead. She wore an old-style regal dress. She came from a hidden realm of the past, once adored and worshiped by all. Unfortunately, she died a lonely death here. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

There were many others… They were all top characters of an era. Some were on the same level as dao lords. A few dao lords’ mounts and followers met their end here too.

“Clank!” Li Qiye continued parrying the various sword dao. All of the affinities and laws of the world obeyed his command.

Thus, he was able to reverse the fundamental essences of the sword dao back to the source and effectively nullified them. This was a magnificent scene that the world didn’t have the pleasure of witnessing. Even gods and devils would be in awe, unable to forget for the rest of their lives.

He eventually made it to the last part of Sword World and saw numerous stars. In reality, they were divine swords, each infinitely close to being at the immortal level and far more valuable than a dao lord sword.

One sword had a majestic aura, clearly of the defensive affinity. Another was the sword only to be wielded by a true king, granting its user the ability to govern. One more was a sword focusing solely on the dao, brimming with inscrutable mysteries…

These swords have turned into stars that would last for an eternity.

“Incredible.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but praise: “Immaculate craftsmanship, perfect beyond perfection.”

Just one alone would drive Eight Desolaces crazy but there were a dozen here. However, Li Qiye only observed them and didn’t grab any.

They were unique and each served as an individual sword dao. After meticulous observation, he was able to understand the mysteries within.

He found that the master had arranged them in chronological order of their journey - a maturity process. This person had reached an unbeatable state but was still searching for something greater.

While at the apex, taking each step meant breaking through the next limit to create an entirely new concept of power. Thus, each sword represented one step and limit.

This being could obliterate sovereigns and dao lords in the blink of an eye. This was not someone who could exist in Eight Desolaces.

Of course, Li Qiye knew of the master’s identity, hence his visit to this place.

“Great swords, but unfortunately, they don’t belong to me.” The swords told a story of their master’s dao improvement process.

Li Qiye figured it out and decided to leave, heading for an old ruin that has been around since antiquity.

It contained incredible ore mines gestated by chaos energy. This was a peerless treasure ground capable of producing top heavenly treasures. Even the richest sect in Eight Desolaces right now paled versus this land’s natural resources.

Of course, Li Qiye didn’t particularly care for the land or its riches. His focus fell on the inhabitants instead.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Metallic beatings continued in a rhythmic fashion. This seemed to have been going on for millions of years now.
