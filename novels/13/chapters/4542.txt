Chapter 4543: Lin Mo

The atmosphere between Li Qiye and Lin Mo felt natural despite this being their first meeting. She stood close enough for her head to be nearly touching his shoulder.

Li Qiye’s group exchanged glances since the two appeared to be close friends, or something even more intimate than that.

They found it strange because they had been following Li Qiye for a while but haven’t seen or heard of him having a friend. From their perspective, no one could get close to him; earning his favor was harder than reaching the sky.

As for Lin Mo, she only needed to say a few words before becoming close with Li Qiye. Moreover, they even looked like lovers.

Their eyes shifted between the pair. Though this was their first meeting, how did they get so close? Also, there wasn’t a hint of awkwardness between them. This natural scene was unique; the two were meant to be this close.

Jian Ming and the daoist weren’t idiots. They immediately knew that she was extraordinary somehow. Alas, they couldn’t pinpoint her to a particular figure despite their vast knowledge.

Her appearance wasn’t supreme but when she was standing next to Li Qiye, this was meant to be almost like destiny.

“Mis-, Fairy, may I read your fortune?” The daoist got an itch and wanted to read Lin Mo’s fortune.

Jian Ming nodded repeatedly like a chicken eating grains and said: “Yes, let the swindler do it, he’s actually surprisingly accurate.”

“Very well.” Lin Mo said calmly with no sign of embarrassment.

The happy daoist took out his trigram shell and held it with both hands. He took a deep breath and said respectfully: “Let me prepare the shell.”

Having said that, he started shaking the shell with both hands and chanted a mantra. He then tossed out the shell to initiate the starting process.

“Bam!” The shell spun around several times before falling to the ground. An image finally appeared on the surface. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“This image foretells the two worlds being connected, a great expedition together…” The daoist took a look and mumbled. Suddenly, his expression changed and he put away the shell. He smiled awkwardly and said: “It seems like my cultivation has been unstable recently and I can’t divine anything, my apology.” He then bowed toward Lin Mo.

Jian Ming could tell that something was amiss. He pulled the daoist to the side and whispered: “Swindler, what did the initial test say? Tell me already.”

“I can’t, I can’t.” The daoist shook his head.

“What do you mean you can’t?” Jian Ming became angry: “Don’t try this on me, I know your cheap tricks. Tell me or I’ll castrate you.”

“You can’t be reasoned with.” The daoist felt like kicking the guy flying.

“Why are you messing around? Don’t you want to know?” Jian Ming insisted.

The daoist naturally wanted to find out more information. He hesitated before replying: “I really can’t, it is forbidden.”

“Are you sure? This is your reputation as a diviner on the line. Not being able to do it shows that your abilities are nothing more than cheap tricks.” Jian Ming continued.

“Your very existence is a cheap trick.” The daoist couldn’t help but retort despite being aware of Jian Ming trying to egg him on.

“Whatever, tell me the details then.” Jian Ming didn’t mind the insult.

The daoist pondered for a bit and chose his words carefully: “That was only the preliminary process, not a true fortune-telling. Nonetheless, because of my clan’s amazing skill, this is still sixty to seventy percent accurate.”

“So was it a good or a bad reading?” Jian Ming asked curiously.

“Hard to say.” The daoist replied: “My intuition is telling me that her fate was either changed or concealed.”

Jian Ming took a deep breath and said: “This is serious business, trying to hide things from the heaven’s eyes. Ordinary cultivators can’t do this.”

“That’s putting it lightly.” The daoist shook his head: “Even dao lords might not be able to do it. It is a grievous offense. Therefore, I feel that there is a large shadow behind her but I don’t know what it is.”

“A shadow? Is it auspicious or ominous?” Jian Ming murmured.

“Not sure since it’s hidden. Peering through it requires an absurd level of power. I can’t do it but maybe an ancestor from our clan can.” The daoist said.

“How does she compare to the young noble?” Wise Ancestor came over and gossiped as well.

“Incomparable.” The daoist smiled: “The young noble’s fate is incalculable. Let’s say that if his fate is as vast as heaven and earth, then our fate is as tiny as an insect.”

He paused for a bit before continuing: “As for this Miss Lin, her fate is a star or a bright moon. In other words, our fate is also insignificant compared to hers.”

“Just answer the question next time, her fate isn’t on the same level as our young noble’s.” Jian Ming said.

“Yes, but that’s a needless statement since she’s above all of us.” The daoist smiled wryly.

The three stole glances at Lin Mo, certain that she came from somewhere frightening. Alas, they couldn’t come up with a famous cultivator or a place.

An explosion interrupted their discussion. They looked over and saw a great path of energy stretching from the horizon to a peak nearby.

Once the light dispersed, they saw a towering pavilion with halos appearing on top of the peak.

“Three Thousand Dao’s people are here.” A crowd member said.

“I wonder how many are here.” Another said.

They then heard a cough and saw an old man standing at the bottom of the pavilion, looking like a guard.
