Chapter 5234: Celestial Court’s Corelight

According to the rumors, this order granted entry to Dream Paradise - a place that can grant wishes within limitations.

Thus, all in the six continents coveted these orders. This included apex conquerors and dao lords who had pursuits above their ability.

“So this is one of the five orders?” A participant asked.

“If there are five, then this is one of them.” Boss Tang said.

“There are only five.” Omniscient Dao Lord said with certainty and paused for a second to look at the group: “Moreover, some had found the others before.”

No one doubted this because Immortal Emperor Yao Zu’s ancient scroll was a gift from Dream Paradise.

“Okay, let's get started. Take out your items.” Boss Tang clapped and said.

No one was in a hurry this time, waiting for others to make a move first. They were still patient enough to wait for the final item, unlike Immensity Conqueror and Immortal Emperor Yao Zu.

“I have a bottle of the finest-grade Nine-form Imperial Remedy, thirty pills.” Resplendent Monarch finally made his move since he desired the immortal order, unable to wait for anyone else.

“Finest grade?” Top cultivators were startled after hearing this.

Although conquerors and dao lords were difficult to injure, this also meant that curing serious wounds was a difficult task. Regular medicine was not enough.

However, Nine-form Imperial Rememy had proven its effectiveness since the grand wars. Heavenly Sage Yuan managed to save numerous emperors and dao lords with these pills.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Thus, some of them actually wanted to buy a few pills before any potential exchange with Boss Tang.

“The finest grade? I did not know your sect was capable of this since the passing of Heavenly Sage Yuan.” Boss Tang said.

Since he didn’t immediately refuse, Resplendent Monarch saw a sliver of hope.

“What treasure do you want?” Jue Xian’er got straight to the point.

“If you are willing to trade your Immortal Piercer, the order is yours.” Boss Tang stared at her and stroked his chin.

Others started sweating for him after hearing this suicidal comment. Sure enough, her eyes flashed with murderous intent.

Neutral spectators standing at the bottom couldn’t handle the intense aura and dropped to the ground.

Even Suppression, Skysword, and Omniscient became serious. They weren’t sure of besting her in battle at all.

Boss Tang, on the other hand, didn’t mind. He acted as if he didn’t do anything wrong and continued: “I’m serious, your Immortal Piercer has a history with me.”

His earnest expression interested the crowd. Everyone knew about Jue Xian’er - her father was Righteous Dao Lord and her mother shared the same name as hers.

However, none knew where her weapon came from. At the very least, she couldn’t be its creator.

“What history?” She was surprised to hear this.

“It’s personal.” Boss Tang shook his head: “Of course, if you ever want to trade, just let me know in the future and we can negotiate.”

Others naturally became curious. As the greatest merchant in the world, Boss Tang never expressed this level of interest in a particular treasure before.

“Brother All-things asked me to come here.” Skysword Dao Lord took out a box as well: “Inside is an item from Brother Blessed, found in outer space.”

“From Blessed Dao Lord?” Others wanted to take a look but Skysword Dao Lord didn’t open the box.

Blessed Dao Lord had a transcendent position in the six continents. He stood apart from the other emperors and dao lords due to his unique stance regarding certain matters.

“The blessing? All-things had shown it before.” Boss Tang asked, seemingly aware of the thing inside.

“What do you think about this deal?” Skysword asked.

“Haha, seems like All-things really wants this order.” Boss Tang laughed, having no qualms about making fun of All-things Dao Lord.

Ye Fantian joined the competition, taking out a divine box just like the others. However, the seal was not enough to contain whatever was within. With each pulsing flash, people felt as if the world was on the verge of exploding as well.

“What is that?” A mighty dragon lord trembled with fear.

“A corelight from Celestial Court.” Boss Tang’s eyes narrowed.

Ye Fantian nodded and said: “Yes, taken from the sky of Celestial Court and refined since the ancient age by the wise sages.”

“I believe Celestial Court should only have one or two. Your Divine Alliance actually has one?” Boss Tang revealed his deep knowledge.

“Left behind by Profound Emperor.” Omniscient Dao Lord interjected.

“That is indeed the case.” Ye Fantian nodded again.

This nearly-forgotten title still stirred the crowd. Profound Emperor was far older than the other alliance starters such as Genesis Conqueror and Light-dragon Conqueror.
