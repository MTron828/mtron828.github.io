Chapter 5397: Supreme’s Heartless Sword

“Rumble!” Rumination, Heavenwheel, and the others released their power.

The fortified palace finally crumbled, unable to handle so many cultivators activating their dao at once.

“Clang!” A shining slash of exquisite mastery radiated throughout eternity, penetrating the dao heart and eliciting gasps.

The technique was heartless but not in the sense of being brutal and merciless, forsaking all emotions.

It simply existed above the realms of reality - a supreme force not attached to any other existence. This special affinity wasn’t forced but had existed with Supreme.

Many cultivators became emotionless due to the path of the dao, viewing others as inferior in due time.

Supreme’s slash was one level above that, possessing an innate sense of superiority and detachment. This nature made it flawless and gasp-worthy. ?Despite its fatal potential, it also had an artistic value.

Li Xian’er was known for her ruthlessness but she couldn’t help but be in awe of the slash. Her attacks filled others with fear while Supreme’s slash overwhelmed them with marvel.

Even a victim would comment on how wondrous it was while being cut down by it - making them understand the possibilities of the dao.

“Boom!” Supreme didn’t bother looking back after delivering the slash, focusing on unsealing the cage.

He wounded several conquerors and dao lords. Alas, despite his prowess, he couldn’t stop all the attacks and suffered several bleeding wounds.

“Brother, stop right there.” All-things left his world to deal with Illumination while creating a containment made of life around Supreme. His life-controlling ability allowed him to create boundless containment in the blink of an eye.

“Let’s go!” Supreme unleashed another transcending slash. Three thousand worlds and their reincarnation cycles couldn’t block it.

Meanwhile, Illumination also broke out of the world and unleashed his temporal river of life on the others.

They had to stop and work together to form a dao barrier in order to stop him.

“Break!” Illumination’s twelve dao fruits became blindingly bright. Inside the radiance was his anima tree unleashing an attack on a whole new level.

It crushed the dao barrier, allowing him to get past them. Nonetheless, he still vomited a mouthful of blood after being struck by their combined effort.

He grabbed the cage, opened a spatial rift, and jumped through.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” The dao lords and conquerors shouted in unison and sealed off all the available dimensions.

Supreme pulled back his sword and disappeared from sight. All-things didn’t have time to worry about him and had to run after Illumination Conqueror.

“Rumble!” Suddenly, mighty figures landed on what was left of the palace and broke through all the seals, allowing Illumination to escape.

Two figures stood out in particular due to their dazzling auras - clearly having possessed an immortal shell and potentially anima.

One had shadowy devils posing behind him as if he were the lord of an ancient world. All of them obeyed and channeled their power into him.

“Devil Conqueror!” The members of Dao Alliance became serious.

“Still alive?” Ferocity was surprised to see him.

This was a legendary conqueror who was as prestigious as Illumination during his prime. His sect was wiped out by heaveners, leaving him as one of the few survivors.

While struggling to stay alive, he fell into a dangerous marsh and coincidentally obtained a fortune, allowing him to dominate with just one fruit.

Although Genesis Dao Lord had started this path, future conquerors found it to be virtually impossible - perhaps no less than obtaining twelve dao fruits in one shot.

Nonetheless, whatever Devil Conqueror found in the marsh made it possible. He became friends with Illumination Conqueror and chose to follow him later on despite being older and just as strong. He stood with Illumination even during Emperors War despite the criticism.

The other radiant conqueror wore a raincoat made of straw, looking like a poor villager living near a river. Alas, everyone felt as if they were fish in the river, just waiting to be caught by him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Riverwalker Conqueror!” The crowd wasn’t surprised to see him as well.
