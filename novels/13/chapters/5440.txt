Chapter 5441: How Is Everyone?

The tree possessed an automatic barrier that could stop apex cultivators from entering. Of course, this couldn’t prevent Li Qiye from coming into its world with the woman.

Next were barriers erected around the tree by Azure Ancestor. It would notice and potentially attack unwelcome visitors. Alas, it didn’t spot Li Qiye and the woman.

While standing inside the tree, they looked around and saw floating stars, feeling as if they were in space itself. The stars glowed with a green shade, seemingly made from countless particles of life. An old mortal on the verge of death could live for several centuries more just by breathing in this affinity.

“This place is good enough to help with your recovery, it will take some time though.” Li Qiye sat down and said.

She sat down next to him and gazed at the stars: “Young Master, this is just like that place, albeit not as grand.”

“Yes, it makes everyone salivate with greed.” Li Qiye nodded.

“And they have made their move.” The woman said softly.

“Greed is just unstoppable, a hurdle that cannot be crossed.” Li Qiye was not at all surprised.

“Everyone has persevered and built a strong foundation, there is still a long way to go though.” She said.

“This is how it should be. If it were so easy, there would be a need for all of you or me, someone else would have done this long ago. Don’t underestimate the strength and wisdom of those before us.” Li Qiye stared at her and said.

“Right, they were so powerful.” She said, aware of the challenges ahead after having faced them herself.

“Someone had already paved the way. Just imagine the difficulty of starting from nothing. We have it easy in comparison.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, the predecessors aided us, allowing us to reach greater heights. Alas, there are greater challenges as well.” She said softly.

“It can’t be helped, they have been waiting long before this epoch, we can’t imagine their history.” He said.

“They are no longer waiting now.” She said.

“The time has come and I wonder if everyone can hold on long enough. But I believe the preparation is ample.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t know, the situation looked dire when I left and morale wavered. There’s a fear of overthrow, that’s why I came to inform you, Young Master.” She said.

“It’s alright, you shouldn't have feared the inevitable.” He consoled her.

“I’m sure you will be able to handle it, I worried about this world more in your absence.” She elaborated.

“Is that why you recklessly descended? To deliver the news and to take a look?” He nodded.

“I made it through but in the last second, someone else ambushed me. It’s fortunate that you were prepared for it as well.” She said.

“What if I were actually absent, you would not be standing here right now.” He sighed.

“I trusted that you would be able to understand and find me eventually.” She said.

“Seems like I can’t afford to lack confidence when you have so much in me. Otherwise, it won’t end well for you, given your cavalier nature.” He chuckled.

“Am I not doing well right now?” She blinked playfully.

He smiled after uniting with a good friend from the past. Everything felt as if it was just yesterday.

“How is everyone?” He asked.

“Min Ren was in charge when I left, he is certainly not letting you down.” She said.

“Yes, he’s the responsible one, unlike a certain mischievous soul.” He said.

“I wanted to see you, Young Master, it has been too long.” She smiled.

“You probably thought that I was dead since so much time had passed and hope started to dwindle.” Li Qiye said.

/p>

“No, I always believe in you, Young Master.” She said: “You were able to leave that place alive so nothing in this world can kill you.”

“It’s not like you think, just got lucky with the right circumstances since I was far weaker then.” Li Qiye smiled wryly.

“Regardless, you still made it out. We know that you can make the impossible happen.” She said.

“Right, but the price…” Li Qiye stared at the sky and didn’t finish.

“Everything started with you, Young Master. We are willing to pay any price.” She said.

“Well, no need for needless sacrifice. This is still just the beginning, the future is for us to carve.” Li Qiye said.

“We’re waiting for your return.” Her eyes brimmed with confidence.

“I will, it is my journey, after all.” He looked back at her.

“When will you set off, Young Master?” She asked.

“I’m afraid I need more time. Although some are growing impatient, there are still loose knots to tie. I can’t afford to be backstabbed at the wrong time.” He said.

“I will go back first and spread the news.” She said.

“Not now, wait for the right opportunity because the calamity is starting.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, it won’t be too long. We have discussed this issue thoroughly in the past.” She said.

“All the pieces are ready to move, even the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Seems a bit early.” She pondered.

“Someone had gone too far and disturbed the villainous heaven. Waiting is increasingly no longer the option.” Li Qiye said.

“Another great calamity.” She murmured.

“One like no other before. Who knows if anyone can hold on and leave behind seeds of hope?” Li Qiye nodded.
