Chapter 4243: Foundation

The majority didn’t think highly of Li Qiye’s chances. Fighting two overlords alone was something unprecedented and suicidal, especially for a junior.

Nonetheless, some were smart enough to never count out Li Qiye. There was still a chance, albeit rather minuscule.

In spite of the ridiculousness and humiliating nature of the circumstances, the two overlords maintained an air of civility, one befitting their status.

“Words spoken cannot be taken back.” Vastsea Venerable said coldly, wanting to prevent Li Qiye from reneging since the duo had absolute confidence in winning a two-on-one battle.

“I never regret my words.” Li Qiye smiled: “Don’t worry, you can bring as many as you want.”

“Fellow Daoist, will you fight alone?” The vajra asked Li Qiye but his sight was set on Everlasting Sword God and the other masters.

It would be awfully problematic if they were to join mid-fight to save Li Qiye.

“Rest assured, we will not interfere if the young noble wishes to fight alone.” Everlasting Sword God confirmed. That finalized the scenario because a person of her status wouldn’t lie.

“This is actually happening.” An expert couldn’t believe it.

“He’s not just fighting the two overlords but their sect too.” An ancestor corrected.

“Don’t gauge the heart of a gentleman with the ruler of a despicable wretch.” Li Qiye smiled: “I will fight alone as I have previously stated regardless of how many of you there are.”

The two overlords exchanged glances and pondered about the situation. There was no way back for them right now since it was an official battle.

To negotiate or to surrender meant throwing away their sect’s prestige and authority. No one would take them seriously in the future. Thus, fighting was absolutely required or they would become sinners.

This was before taking Finality into account as well. There were several reasons to fight. Moreover, they didn’t think that they would lose to Li Qiye regardless of his heaven-defying means.

They made up their mind and both of them commanded their men: “Prepare, no holding back.”

Despite their confidence, they were still preparing for the worst scenario and decided to go all out.

Sword God Jialun obeyed the command and summoned an ancient drum. The top was made from the skin of a lightning dragon while the bones of an aqua kui made up the base.

Earthslope Ancestor from Nine-wheel took out an old shell of a rare jade-gold conch.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The sounds of the drum and conch echoed towards the horizon and into the rest of Sword Continent.

Each beat slammed the listeners’ heart and froze them while the conch created a tsunami of sound waves.

“What are they doing?” Many saw this for the first time and became confused. Of course, they were aware that the two behemoths weren’t messing around.

“Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra are activating the peerless foundation of their sect.” An ancestor elaborated.

This caused the crowd to shudder due to the significance of this action. When a dao lord lineage chose to activate their foundation, it meant that they were ready to fight to the death.

In this case, a sect with five dao lords and one with four dao lords were doing so - a truly frightening event. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Do they actually need to do this?” Someone found this surprising because it shouldn’t be difficult for them to deal with Li Qiye.

“It’s to be perfectly safe, or maybe to catch everything with one net.” A big shot mused before glancing over at Everlasting Sword God’s group.

Those nearby became emotional. What if the two overlords’ real plan was to catch everyone else? This could potentially destroy their competitors and give them true hegemony.

“Boom!” Once the drum and the conch’s sounds made it far enough, deafening blasts quaked the entire continent.

“Look in the direction of Sea Emperor.” Many calmed down and turned their head.

The kingdom resided in a vast oceanic region. Blinding beams shot to the sky and illuminated the realm with terrifying sword energies.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Images of gigantic swords manifested in the air.
