The terror of Imperial Demise knows no bounds, akin to a dead world or hell itself.

Danger loomed before every step in this scorched earth ravaged by flame and lava... Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As one infiltrated deeper, the danger only increased. There seemed to be terrible monsters hiding underground.

Li Qiye took his time strolling, unaffected by the surrounding perils. The lava and flame couldn’t hurt him at all. After all, this was someone who successfully traveled from the tenth world to this place through the tribulation ocean.

This place was not worth mentioning in comparison. When he released his grand dao, his body became the embodiment of a diamond - virtually impervious.

The dead True Gods and even Eternals’ corpses were destroyed with nothing left behind. After all, such a “nice” end wasn’t possible in this type of place since the destructive affinities would corrode their remains.

In the darkness deep beneath the crevices, some monsters would occasionally show themselves - long tentacles and red eyes. They stared intensely at Li Qiye, salivating as if he was a fat piece of meat.

Just the area itself was terrifying enough, but the presence of these on-the-prowl monsters lurking in the shadows amplified the dread. People would feel as if they were trapped in an ocean of beasts.

He didn’t bother himself with them. With a buzzing noise, his primordial tree appeared, seemingly creating a new world with its eternal power.

Three maelstroms continued to spin above his primordial will. Twelve laws poured down around him.

Under this state, he didn’t need to exert his aura. Just a wave was enough to crush the momentum of the world. Gods and immortals were no different than ants.

“Rustle...” These monsters quickly retreated back to the darkness, no longer daring to scheme against him.

Li Qiye gave them an instinctive fear. Though they were strong, intuition told them that this man was no prey; they were his meals instead. A fight would only end in their defeat.

He chuckled after seeing their retreat and trekked forward until he reached the deepest area of Imperial Demise.

The area was devastated. Ten million miles have turned into a crater. Each star in the sky crumbled and fell to the ground. Flames were still ravaging the bottom of these pits, continuing to burn deeper into the ground.

It looked as if the sun had been knocked down and drained completely by someone, leaving only a little spark behind.

Furthermore, numerous weapons were left behind. A massive spear was pinned on top of a star, broken. One corner of a shield insisted on floating in the sky. One more heavenly sword was at the bottom of an abyss. It emitted stormy runes and laws, capable of crushing the firmaments.

If outsiders were to see this, they would be scared out of their mind. They were famous weapons belonging to at least Eternals.

In the end, these existences still lost; their weapons destroyed. One could only imagine the great battles that have waged here.

One thing stood out among the destruction - a towering mountain, completely unaffected across the ages. A palace presided at the top, seemingly made from bronze with an ancient style. It was covered in a thick layer of rust by this point.

Li Qiye revealed a smile upon seeing the palace and walked on the air to reach the top.

The first sensation was a chill, not from cold air but rather an emotional one. People would instinctively shudder despite not seeing anything horrifying.

This painted a clear picture - something was extremely dangerous ahead. Of course, this meant nothing to Li Qiye.

It didn’t look that big from the outside, but upon entering, it resembled an entire world with a dark sky above.

Li Qiye didn’t need to go far before seeing a faint, holy light wanting to expel the darkness of this world.

He got close enough to see that it was a gray robe. Judging by its size, the wearer must have had a large stature.

Instead of laying on the ground, it looked as if there was someone still wearing it while sitting down even though there was no one there. The robe remained there with an eternal will.

Its light might be faint but its holiness left no room for doubt. No evil creature could ever come close.

“Regalia.” It was obvious whom the robe belonged to.

Back then, Regalia Ancestor called out this terrible area. This resulted in a progenitor-level fight. No one saw him coming back out. Just what kind of creature did he face in here?

Li Qiye shook his head at this sight and was interrupted by loud footsteps.

These steps made people narrow their eyes, feeling as if the hair all over their body was about to explode.

He turned back and saw a shadow appearing in this empty palace.

“Boom!” The broken stars in the sky detonated.

Not to mention regular True Gods, even Eternals would be suppressed before this terrifying aura. The shadow wasn’t big but it made everything else seems small in comparison. It could easily destroy a True Emperor.

All of Moneyfall quaked after it’s appearance.
