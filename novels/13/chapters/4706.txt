Chapter 4707: Azure Bulwark Of The Fist Dao

The emperor thought that he was in a dream. How could someone possess such mastery over the Primordial Union?

Rumor has it that this place existed at the formation of the primordial chaos, above the control of any single man.

“Now, will you hand the gemstone over?” Li Qiye smiled.

The emperor became serious again due to the predicament. He had remained stubborn for so long. Just handing it over now seemed off somehow. Yielding without a fight wasn’t part of his personality.

“If you still haven’t given up, then make your move.” Li Qiye said: “Though I’ve agreed with the little girl to spare your life, I’ll have to teach you a lesson.”

The emperor took a deep breath and said: “I’ve never given up before a fight. If you wish for me to hand it over, you need to show me your unstoppable power.”

“I’m afraid you aren’t qualified to witness my power since you would be reduced to ashes at the start. But it is fine to let you see a bit of the union’s power.” Li Qiye smiled.

This statement was infuriating, especially for accomplished cultivators. They rarely experienced disdain after making a name of themselves.

The emperor naturally became annoyed. Nonetheless, he took a deep breath and maintained his cool: “Very well, I’ll be convinced if you can defeat me and will hand the gemstone over without saying a word.”

“Buzz.” He gathered his energy and fist intents.

Jian Ming and the daoist thought that his first move would result in a chaotic expanse of fist energy and dao. However, the opposite actually occurred - all the auras disappeared.

He clenched his right hand into a fist while the left remained a palm. He then cupped his fist and the ground suddenly shook violently.

All of his powers and vitality gathered on his right fist while the dao gathered on his left. His body became a vessel for the various empowerment affinities and internal energy sources.

He used the world and the myriad dao to create the strongest and most unbreakable defense. He became one with the heaven and earth, lasting as long as they would. This was the culmination of his fist dao.

“What is this technique?” Jian Ming commented. He understood that this was rather hard to break since it encompassed the myriad dao and the physical fabrics of reality.

In order to hit the emperor, Li Qiye must first break the myriad dao and the region around the emperor.

“This is why he’s on the same level as the monarchs.” The daoist praised: “This defensive technique alone is enough for him to hold the world in disdain.”

The emperor only focused on defense instead of offense - a sign of him viewing Li Qiye as a dangerous foe. He only wanted to survive and never thought about defeating Li Qiye. As long as he lasted long enough, victory would be his.

“Azure Bulwark of the Fist Dao.” The emperor uttered the name of the technique. His words were in tune with the grand dao.

The two spectators exchanged glances, agreeing with the naming scheme since it was so apt. They then stared at Li Qiye, wondering what he would do. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Despite the difficulty in defeating the emperor’s bulwark, they still had complete confidence in Li Qiye.

“Make your move, feel free to use all your weapons.” The emperor shouted confidently. He employed this technique against the monarchs from the alliance and survived their onslaught, albeit with injuries.

“This place is my weapon, no need for anything else. Its power alone is enough to crush you.” Li Qiye smiled.

The emperor snorted and didn’t buy it. No one in this world could defeat him with ease.

Li Qiye reached forward and then slowly closed his fingers while aiming at the emperor. In this split second, the others felt a spatial fluctuation.

Li Qiye became the high heaven with the cosmo in his grasp. This included the myriad dao and all living beings.

Worlds created and worlds destroyed; dao coming into fruition and extinguishing - all happened within a single thought of his.

The largest worlds and strongest beings were nothing more than specks of dust compared to him.

When these insignificant beings looked up at the sky, they couldn’t see the boundless cosmo, let alone the hand grasping everything. Nonetheless, the trio certainly felt that he could crush them or reduce the entire world into nothingness in an instant.

“Boom!” Li Qiye clenched his fist tightly and the emperor’s impressive technique collapsed with haste.

The power of the various affinities, the myriad dao, and the emperor’s own cultivation disintegrated.

“Ahh!” The emperor screamed and fell to the ground, bloodied.

This left the duo in shambles. The emperor himself had no words to describe how helpless he felt just now. All the previous opponents he had faced weren’t worthy of holding Li Qiye’s shoes. This included Dao Sanqian whom he had met before.
