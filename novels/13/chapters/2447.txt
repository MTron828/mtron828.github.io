The crowd held their breath while staring at Li Qiye, overwhelmed with excitement about what’s to come. Some had a grin on their face from schadenfreude. This group wanted to see Li Qiye humiliated and shamed.

Li Qiye didn’t seem to notice these disciples and even the saintess. He continued to drink his tea and enjoyed the floating clouds ahead.

Splendorous Saintess entered the pavilion and headed straight for him with coldness in both her glare and expression.

Jianchuan could tell what she wanted to do judging by her demeanor and said: “Junior Sister, you’re here.”

He gently shook his head while speaking, gesturing her to not do anything rash, especially without permission.

“Greetings, Brother Zhang.” She slightly bowed towards Jianchuan but ignored his signals.

It didn’t take long before she stood in front of Li Qiye, accompanied by a gentle fragrance.

“Take it out.” She stretched her jade hand towards him and demanded.

Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye, not bothering to glance at her: “You are blocking my view.”

She turned red, embarrassed, after receiving this arrogant treatment and angrily glared at him.

As the princess and jewel of Godstep, she has always been the centerpiece wherever she went, the moon surrounded by the stars. She was used to flattery and reverence, causing her to have some pride and arrogance herself.

However, Li Qiye didn’t bother to look at her before everyone and treated her like air, truly infuriating her as a result.

“This is Godstep, not your War Sainty Dynasty! It is over for your kingdom!” Splendorous coldly said.

She reminded him that he was only freeloading off their sect right now, no longer an imperious king like before.

He nonchalantly responded: “Scram before I become angry, do not block my view.”

“Who do you think you are?!” Many disciples furiously roared. This comment has incited the anger of the crowd.

How could they let anyone insult their princess, especially a fallen king that is freeloading at their sect?

Splendorous was furious, already annoyed at this marriage in the first place. Moreover, the king had a terrible reputation and this only exacerbated her distaste and disdain towards him. Plus, he was a nobody now, just a parasite at their sect.

How could such a person look down on her in this manner? It was the heaviest insult in her eyes.

She glared at him and said: “War Saint Dynasty is no longer in charge, hand over the marriage pact, don’t humiliate yourself any further.”

The crowd ate it up. One of them loudly shouted: “That’s right, we’re a great power of Nine Secrets, how dare this landless king act like this on our territory?!”

“Hmph, someone useless like him isn’t worthy of our Senior Sister. He needs to get the hell out right now. We’ve shown enough kindness harboring him for this long.” Another one yelled.

“You wish to break off this marriage?” Li Qiye finally put down the teacup and glanced at her, still with a smile on his face.

“Indeed!” She responded: “This marriage agreement is no longer valid. Hand over the pact since keeping it around is only harmful to you.”

“And if I refuse?” Li Qiye smirked.

“It’s not up to you!” Another disciple cried out: “Your kingdom is done for already!”

The saintess threatened: “You are a frog trying to eat swan’s meat, just bringing humiliation to yourself! If you are smart enough to read the situation, you should know what to do!”

“So a fallen king like me is not worthy of the princess of Godstep.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Exactly.” She said: “I will reach the apex in the future and become an invincible Eternal, you are only a ridiculous and incapable king. You should be thinking about how to stay alive right...”

Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted her: “You really think of yourself as a swan? Only a saintess of Godstep, nothing more. And an Eternal is no different than an ant, a servant, to me. Back at the imperial city, dozens of Eternals kneeled before me, so stop thinking so highly of yourself.”

“You!” She turned redder from anger.

The disciples’ eyes burned with fury. He was insulting both their saintess and sect.

“In fact, you should be thanking Lucidity King.” Li Qiye lazily said without looking at her: “You think you’re pretty enough to be my wife? Being a concubine is already pushing it, no, you’re not even qualified to be a personal maid. Your looks and shallow cultivation are only suitable to be a feet-washing servant. If it wasn’t for Lucidity King granting you this marriage, you would have nothing.”

“Bullshit! Who do you think you are?!” The disciples clamored, unable to hold back.

The saintess’ eyes could kill right now. She felt a murderous urge: “You! You deserve death! You are bringing this upon yourself!”

“Junior Sister!” The situation has escalated out of control so Jianchuan pulled the saintess away: “Please calm down.”

“Hmph, Senior Brother, are you forgetting that you’re a disciple of Godstep?” A few disciples were unhappy and told Jianchuan since he was helping Li Qiye.

The saintess also spoke coldly towards him: “What are you doing, Senior Brother?”

He shook his head in response: “Junior Sister, I’ve received orders from the great ancestor to take care of His Majesty’s daily life and safety, so please let this go.”

“Senior Brother, back off and ignore this. I’ll answer to the great ancestor later.” Her tone became serious.

“No.” Jianchuan maintained his position: “I am under orders, please excuse me.”

“At least one person in Godstep isn’t an idiot. The same can’t be said about the rest, so foolish and blind.” Li Qiye added to the fire.

“Ignorant fool, daring to boast on our territory, who do you think you are?” An arrogant voice came about.

A youth walked over, looking quite gallant and oppressive. White from top to bottom, he walked with both hands behind his back like a proud crane with an entourage of his own.

“First Brother! First Brother is here!” The disciples here excitedly shouted. Some stared at him with nothing but admiration. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

First Disciple of Godstep - White Crane Young Noble, Zhang Hao!

His talents weren’t inferior to Splendorous Saintess. Moreover, he made his dao debut much earlier so his cultivation was considerably higher. He was well-received among the third generation of disciples in Godstep and enjoyed some fame in Nine Secrets.

His eyes flashed like lightning and swept through the crowd before stopping on Li Qiye.

“Hmph, you’re not qualified to comment on Godsect, trash.” He was even more aggressive than Splendorous Saintess, not holding anything back.
