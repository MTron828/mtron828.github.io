Chapter 4912: South Emperor

The third main division was Abroad Hall. Among the three, Study Hall was the smallest with the fewest students.

These youths would later on become disciples of the academy, hoping to become important figures down the road.

Hundred Halls accepted everyone. It didn’t matter whether they were from The People or The Race. A mortal beggar or a successor of a dao lineage were the same. The most important thing was their talent and comprehension.

Students were free to live after graduation. There was no need to stay or repay the academy. Of course, the requirements were still stringent. Because of this, dragon lords and conquerors were alumni once.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

For example, Lunar's progenitor, Nightmoon Conqueror, came from Hundred Halls. The latter stood out even among her peers, capable of challenging Celestial Court and its leaders.

The conquerors and emperors of Celestial Court couldn’t stop her. It took Heaven Burial Conqueror to stop her before she could make it to Sword Emperor.

This was the reason why Celestial Court wanted to take over. The academy simply had a way of producing top cultivators.

Abroad Hall was the most complex and diverse. It had the highest student population. Whenever it was time for recruitment, Abroad Hall would be open to everyone in the lower three continents.

They just needed to come and report before getting to stay. Therefore, it had more members than most sects in the lower continents. The number could reach up to several hundred thousand students during the peak.

This was one way for cultivators to join first and eventually hope for a chance to enter Hundred Halls or Study Hall.

Of course, this was a complicated place. There were conquerors and dao lords, weak mortals, or heinous villains. The capabilities of its members varied greatly.

Because of its number advantage, it did produce some brilliant cultivators. In the distant past, there were Luminous, Nightmoon, and Black Demon Conqueror…

More recently, Eight-stallion and Phenomena came from here. Conceal Conqueror had studied in Abroad as well. This also applied to many of the current leaders in Lower Three Continents during their youth.

In fact, some kings and sect leaders could be seen here right now. There was just something irresistible about the academy.

Bloodsea Blade was another famous alumnus. However, the academy didn’t recognize him as one of its own.

Because of this, some believed that he originated from Study Hall, not Hundred Halls. He was meant to become a core member of the academy yet he chose to leave. This resulted in animosity. Of course, there were just rumors.

Though the academy expected nothing in return, some top masters had shown their gratitude in various ways. Most chose to donate precious treasures or their merit laws. Many conquerors have done so and this made the academy even stronger.

“What about that place?” Li Qiye looked up at a bright radiance above the academy.

It seemed to be a supreme kingdom hidden in the crevices of the sky. Occasionally, amazing visual phenomena could be seen. Some might say that this was the very origin of the academy.

“I don’t know, but this whole region is an independent world. Look over there, we just need to cross that mountain range and it’ll be Hundred Halls and Study Hall. A bit further will be the place for ancestors.”

She paused for a bit and looked up: “But what you’re asking about is a mystery. I haven’t been there before but I heard that it was the very end of the academy. Do you know about the invasion of Celestial Court? The mythical palm came from that light and killed emperors.”

“Mythical palm.” Li Qiye repeated before closing his eyes to feel the light.

“That’s Abroad Hall over there, it’s the entrance to the academy as well.” She pointed at the buildings next to the mountain range, forming a great city.

The academy itself was massive. Traveling from Abroad to Hundred and Study Hall required traversing a considerable distance. All of this made up the independent world of the academy.

The entrance had two statues. No, it was actually three. One was situated to the left while the other had two separate figures - one male and one female.

The man was gallant and powerful; the woman looked exquisite and wise. All in all, the extraordinary auras depicted left spectators in awe.

The statue to the left was a young man with a carefree and confident expression. His weapon of choice was a sky halberd.

“Wonderfully built, these auras have lasted for a long time.” Li Qiye praised.

“The statues celebrate great contributors to the academy.” Yunyun explained: “She pointed at the statue to the left and said: “He is South Emperor, the protector who stopped an army of one hundred thousand cultivators from Celestial Court.”

“South Emperor.” Li Qiye said quietly.

That battle had earned a spot in the history scrolls. Even members of The Ancient Race couldn’t help but praise him while standing before his statue.
