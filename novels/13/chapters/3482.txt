The emergence of Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign caused a stir. Most thought that he was aiming his sword at Ancestral City.

However, no reaction nor message came from the latter’s side.

A powerful aura came next, this time emanating from a grand temple in Skylight. The royal energy also tore apart the sky just like the sword energy of the sovereign.

It spread across the realm in a rather-soundless fashion. Normal people didn’t notice this at first. Once it became obvious, the aura was already thick and ever-present, engulfing all inhabitants in the north.

It wasn’t oppressive or frightening, only containing a strange sense of authority and prestige. This feeling permeated bone-deep as if an emperor stood before them - one capable enough to convince the rest of the world.

The big shots stared towards that direction. Those in the know shuddered since it came from that one temple.

According to the rumors, this temple was off-limit to most. Only the king of Skylight and a few ancestors had permission to enter. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Inside were numerous sleeping ancestors at the Heavenly Sovereign realm. This was the reason why Skylight was such a big threat. No one really knew how many ancestors they had slumbering inside.

“An ancestor in that temple just woke up.” This became obvious to most people. It must have been an important one too in order to have a visual phenomenon like that.

“Raa!” The majority was still thinking about which ancestor it was. Suddenly, a dragon roar assaulted the sky and wouldn’t dissipate for a long time.

“Boom!” A draconic aura could sweep the mountains and flip the oceans over. It came from the temple as well.

The current of the rivers in the region started reversing; the trees in the forest collapsed.

“So strong too!” The weaker cultivators couldn’t stand because of this draconic soundwave.

“Save me!” Some of them were swept off their feet and got blown up into the air.

“Boom!” The royal energy earlier was blown away next. Sunlight returned to the north, only there was an azure dragon with shining scales up above. The shimmers from the scale had a cold touch.

It was a five-clawed dragon, capable of untold destruction. Everyone else felt insignificant compared to this creature.

“Skylight True Dragon Art.” An ancestor gasped at this sight.

Another powerful cultivator murmured afterward: “From what I know, there is only one person in Skylight who had mastered this art.”

“Azure Dragon King!” A big shot finished the line.

“He should be called Azure Dragon Ancient Ancestor or ancient king now. He has abdicated many eras ago, now he’s the strongest ancestor there.” An old ancestor said.

“Another influential ancient ancestor is out now. That’s the ace card of Skylight.” Another commenter said.

He was the most excellent king in Skylight outside of their dao lord. The country prospered under his leadership with more territories acquired.

He ruled for three generations before passing it down to a new successor. He then spent his days in the grand temple.

Nonetheless, whenever something important or contested happened, the current king would enter the grand temple and ask him for guidance. Thus, though he was retired, he was still controlling the direction of Skylight.

He hasn’t shown up for a long time until now to everyone’s astonishment.

“The ancient king is a great genius who managed to cultivate their special art, not inferior to Bai Jianchan by much.” One expert said.

“Is that dragon art that amazing?” A junior asked.

Very few people have heard of the Skylight True Dragon Art. This included the disciples from Skylight.

Any ancestor would have a serious expression after hearing the name of this art. One of them said: “It’s extremely strong, not just a simple heaven-level one. Some believed that it’s the strongest art left behind by Skylight Dao Lord. According to the legends, he watched a true dragon and became enlightened enough to create it.”

“A true dragon?” The group became startled.

This art was the strongest and hardest to cultivate in Skylight. Few managed to do so after their dao lord.

There were variations of this legend. Some said that the dao lord saw a true dragon. However, some researchers, later on, stated that it was only the remains of one.

He learned and understood the innate talents of a true dragon by studying its bones before creating the art.

He left it behind in Skylight but his future descendants couldn’t understand it. The talent requirement was absurdly high. Many people took a look and didn’t comprehend anything, even those labeled as “geniuses”.

Thus, the ancient king’s success in this endeavor was indicative of his talents. That’s why the ancestor earlier said that he wasn’t far off from Bai Jianchan.

“Firmaments’ Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign and Skylight’s Azure Dragon Ancient King. It’s a war.” People shuddered after seeing the dragon and sword in the sky.

“They’re not messing around. The saintess caused a lot of trouble this time.” One observer said.

These beings normally never showed up unless something pivotal was happening to their sect. A war against Ancestral City could be a reason.

It seemed like peace was unlikely between the parties.

“The coalition armies of Yin Yang, Skylight, and Firmaments aren’t enough to take down the city even if they muster every man from their territories. In order to win, they need powerful ancient ancestors there. Regular troops can’t do anything.” An ancestor glanced at the massive golem and said.

Millions and millions of troops still couldn’t kill that golem forefather. They needed equivalent cultivators. For example, Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign and Azure Dragon Ancient King.
