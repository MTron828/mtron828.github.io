Chapter 5150: I Make Others Tremble

The mortar originated from Thunderous Temple and was blessed by the heavenly dragons of Buddhism. It had a depiction of a golden dragon opening its mouth, seemingly swallowing the entire bowl.

The pestle was crafted from skyburn sacred wood, containing the titular affinity.

She held the pestle in one hand and tossed up a handful of azure orchid beans with the other. She then swung the pestle like a dragon stirring the ocean to hit all of the beans.

The broken pieces fell down the mortal and she smashed the pestle right at the center.

“Clank!” A dragon seemed to be awakening and was under her control, moving in unison with her command. It soared inside the mortal and summoned rains and winds. Next came thunderous explosions.

The beans gradually turned into powders and were swept by the winds, resulting in a golden dao harmonization.

Harkrain then scattered a handful of priceless lingzhi. Each fell down and issued a metallic noise in a very particular order. The dragon under her command also reduced the lingzhi down to powder using its various elemental powers.

It scales suddenly spread upward and released bright rays, intensifying the various phenomena occurring in the mortar. Such mastery and finesse could only be seen in a conqueror.

“Raa!” Finally, the dragon soared upward and released the finished tea from its mouth. She caught the rain with two dao cups and sprinkled ninth-revolution leaves on the cup. An exquisite fragrance of nature immediately pierced the nostrils.

“Please try, Young Noble and Lord Landu.” She bowed: “It seems like I am not as good as before.”

“It was superbly done, the grand dao of tea manifested in your hands.” Landu wasn’t stingy with his praise.

Li Qiye lifted the cup and slowly savored the first sip. As the tea entered his mouth, a Buddhist aroma filled the senses - the scent manifesting from the good deeds done by countless Buddhists.

“Impressive, using tea to enter the dao, this is rather profound.” Li Qiye concluded.

“It is an honor to hear such praises.” She bowed.

The two went on to enjoy the tea and the scenery outside the window. After a while, a disciple entered and whispered something to the conqueror.

She slightly frowned but waved her hand, still deciding to serve the two.

Exquisite tea and flawless scenery - one couldn’t ask for more.

More time passed and the disciple entered again. The whisper caused her expression to change.

“Go ahead if you have something to attend to.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand: “We are just going with the flow, it’s time for us to leave soon anyway.”

“My apology for the inadequate hospitality, please forgive me, Young Noble and Lord Landu.” She bowed and said.

After she left, Landu stared outside and said: “The winds are picking up, they want to make people shudder.”

“I’m the one who makes others shudder.” Li Qiye ate some snacks and responded.

“True.” Landu chuckled and said: “I don’t think there’s anyone in this world who can make you shudder.”

“If such a person exists, I’m afraid this world will be no more.” Li Qiye commented.

“...” Landu stared at the teacup and said: “I think I’ve lost my appetite.”

“We need to fix that then, if you’re going to die, I want you to be a ghost with a full stomach.” Li Qiye joked.

“I can’t say I disagree. Very well, let’s keep going.” Landu laughed before eating again.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a conqueror aura erupted and sent shockwaves in all directions.

Cultivators waiting outside the pavilion were instantly suppressed and became afraid.

“What’s going on?!” Someone shouted.

“The conqueror is furious.” A dragon lord recognized the aura.

“But why?” None knew what was going on.

Cultivators at that level had strong control over their emotions. Few things could drive them angry.

However, this was Heaven Alliance’s territory. It didn’t take long before some ancient ancestors received further information.

“Heavenly Sword School came seeking a marriage alliance.” One of them revealed.

“Which genius do they want from the pavilion?” Another asked.

Heavenly Sword was bestowed with a derogatory moniker by its detractors - the hound of Heaven Alliance. They had done certain unsavory things under orders so most did not respect it despite its power. In fact, a few conquerors and dragon lords from there did not like being controlled by Heaven Alliance.

“Harkrain Conqueror.” The ancient ancestor responded.

“?! Are they crazy?” This astounded listeners.

Proposing a marriage with a genius disciple was understandable and common. On the other hand, Harkrain Conqueror was a top existence in charge of billions of lives.

Moreover, most have heard of her romance with Windchaser Conqueror. Though it wasn’t officially declared, this was far from a secret.

The conquerors were in charge of their own marriage with no need for political proposals. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Seems like a vulgar move.” One ancient ancestor commented.

“Who is the other party?” Another wanted to know more.

“Heavenly Sword Godmonarch, a supreme genius.” The ancient ancestor who revealed the information elaborated.

“Hmm, the current schoolmaster? He has seven sacred fruits.” Everyone knew of him and re-evaluated their stance since he was an actual good match for the conqueror.
