Chapter 5116: Despair

No one thought that there was a devil looming in their land. Though conquerors have massacred sects before, the acts were either due to vengeance or part of a conflict.

Absorbing other cultivators was something unforgivable and forbidden. Now, two conquerors whom everyone thought had ascended were actually hiding here all this time.

Due to a lack of communication between the continents, only assumptions could be made. In reality, Greenmountain hid to devour others while Phenomena waited to see the culprit.

Today, Greenmountain finally revealed his true face and trapped three conquerors from the upper continents.

“Activate!” Phenomena roared and myriad images appeared in the air - the rotating celestials, ancient trees, wondrous godkings, meteors…

He brimmed with vitality and imperial power after releasing all of his might. He turned back into a conqueror instead of being an old cemetery keeper.

“Rumble!” In the distant Lunar, waves of moonlight pulsed outward. They came together to form a lunar seal to empower Phenomena.

The conqueror became shrouded in flames. He raised his hand and summoned a gigantic hammer spanning ten thousand miles.

“Break!” He swung the lunar hammer down, nearly crushing all of Reincarnation.

“What a shame, weaker than before!” Greenmountain shouted.

Cracks appeared on Chrono Disk. They were already from the start, not due to the current battle. Temporal laws oozed out of it and connected with the divine treasury.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Boom!” A massive hand rushed into the air and stopped the hammer.

“I have you know that this treasury once belonged to the legendary Samsara Ancestor, the devourer of an epoch. It took a lot of effort for me to seek out this dark path and inherit his dark dao. No one is getting away today!” Greenmountain shouted. [1]

After stopping the hammer, the hand smashed Phenomena Conqueror despite his attempt to block it with his countless laws and treasures.

“Bam!” He vomited a mouthful of blood; his bones shattered.

Greenmountain had eight dao fruits now and was stronger than before. Most importantly, he had inherited the dark power of an ancient epoch - far stronger than conquerors at a similar level.

Phenomena was sent flying for miles and miles. Greenmountain tried to catch him but Thousand-faced Sovereign entered the battlefield, grabbing the wounded Phenomena and flying away.

His goal was to run for their lives since the two of them still couldn’t beat Greenmountain.

“Run all you want, this entire world will be mine anyway.” Greenmountain laughed and didn’t pursue.

Listens shuddered as if they had fallen into an ice pit. Alas, there was nothing they could do to stop the feast.

“Implode!” While Greenmountain was momentarily distracted by Phenomena, the other conquerors made a difficult choice.

“Boom!” They chose to die while erupting all of their powers.

The golden armor plates trapping them exploded. Metal bits along with blood and flesh gushed out. The resulting force instantly flattered Reincarnation.

Alas, the might of Chrono Disk came crashing down. The conquerors had no other choice but to be even more drastic - imploding their dao fruits as well.

With this final act, they reduced Reincarnation into dust. Its inhabitants didn’t even have the chance to scream before disappearing from the world. Only a bottomless abyss was left of this region.

The three conquerors hoped that there would be fragmentations of their dao fruit left after the implosion. As long as there were slivers left, they could come back to life again just like Luminous Conqueror back then.

“Too late for that.” The empowered Greenmountain shouted. A dark hand swept over and grasped all of the remnant affinities.

“Ahh!” In the end, the conquerors couldn’t escape this predicament. Their vitality and dao fruits were taken by the hand and pulled back into Chrono Disk

With that, the wheel became even more resplendent and looked like an eternal moon. Some of its cracks disappeared as a result.

Greenmountain Conqueror was the final victor to the horror of all inhabitants. Li Qiye was dead and three conquerors were refined.

From now on, the lower continents belonged to him alone. He could eat anyone he wanted now including the remaining conquerors and dragon lords.

“What a shame.” He sighed while looking at the abyss: “It was a wonderful continent but it’s fine, the power of darkness is mine now.”

Everything from Reincarnation including its divine treasury and foundation was already taken by Chrono Disk beforehand.

Heaven Burial was destroyed by Li Qiye before but he was more merciful in comparison. There was nothing left of Reincarnation now. Not a single survivor was left within the affected radius with the exception of Greenmountain.

1. This should be Samsara Wild Ancestor and Desolate Saint. There is one minor difference in the characters used but it’s close enough and the contexts match. ☜
