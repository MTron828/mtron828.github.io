Chapter 4855: Bloodsea Blade

Both Firerage and Rat God became astounded. They didn’t see how the teeth were removed at all.

It was one thing for Firerage to not see due to the distance and being distracted by the sword wound. However, Rat God was the victim who was right there.

It assumed that the nameless junior was an easy meal but only pain came afterward.

“Your Highness, are you alright?” Firerage stared at Li Qiye in disbelief.

Li Qiye tossed the teeth away and smiled: “I’m perfectly fine.”

This confused Firerage even more. Putting that break just now, the guy appeared so composed as well.

Meanwhile, an inferno suddenly surrounded the battlefield. The rats around the mountains were roasted. The smell permeated the region.

“Pyromancer, how dare you?!” Rat God leaped out of the flames and roared.

Top masters such as Nether Messenger and Fallen King escaped in time so they didn’t suffer any injury.

“You killed my descendants!” Rat God was furious. It relied on these demon rats to kill kingdoms in just a short time. They were no different from a precious artifact in its eyes.

“Kekeke…” Pyromancer had a burst of strange hen-like laughter: “Doesn’t it smell good though?”

“My Demon Lineage has no feud with you!” Rat God was both angry and afraid.

“I do whatever the hell I want, the smell of roasted meat pleases me.” Pyromancer snorted and stared at the rat: “It’s a shame that I don’t eat rat or I would roast you too.”

Rat God nearly vomited from anger. Alas, Pyromancer was stronger than all of them.

“This is karma.” One villain murmured because the rats enjoyed eating cultivators. This was well deserved.

The atmosphere became heated, both literally and figuratively. Pyromancer’s appearance changed the situation completely.

Pyromancer had two dao fruits, far stronger than anyone present. If he were to team up with Rat God’s group, then the imperial guard would have no chance of escaping.

However, if he were to feud with the other side, then there was still hope for Firerage and his men.

“You three, take that corpse out and I’ll roast it. Have you ever had dao lord meat before?” Pyromancer commanded Rat God’s team.

“!!!” The guards were furious after hearing this.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Hurry up.” Pyromancer urged.

“Why should we listen to you?” Nether Messenger scowled. Villains like them never obeyed others, not even a stronger cultivator.

“Then should I make appetizers out of you three first?” Pyromancer glared at them.

The three of them were stuck in a tough situation. Even if they were to team up, they might not be able to beat Pyromancer.

“So be it.” Rat God ignored the contempt and focused on something else: “I’ve eaten plenty of people in my life but never a dao lord. It’s time to have a taste.”

“Very well.” Nether Messenger and Fallen King exchanged glances and nodded.

“Kill them!” The two immediately attacked Firerage and the guards.

Fallen King unleashed an ocean of swords with loud clankings toward Firerage. Nether Messenger let out a strange shriek and summoned a banner. He swung it and released ferocious specters at the guards. It was as if thousands of specters were finally being freed from their imprisonment.

They wanted to buy enough time for Rat God to steal the corpse. Plus, they didn’t want to be the ones committing the heinous act.

“Eating a dao lord would be a life worth living.” Rat God had no problem with the bad reputation.

“Stop!” Firerage and the others bellowed. Alas, they were occupied with blocking the incoming attacks.

“Clank!” A saber hymn could be heard - one piercing the very heart of all listeners.

A blood light flashed for a split second - virtually indiscernible.

“Pluff!” Blood gushed upward and rained down like a blooming flower. It came from the head of Rat God as its body also fell to the ground. Its eyes were still open to see its killer.

“Blood…” It tried to say a title before death but it was too late.

A figure hovered above the dao lord’s coffin. He wore a daoist robe and an iron hat. Though the hat had a veil to hide his face, his saber intent alone frightened everyone. Firerage’s own paled in comparison.

The scabbard had a dark crimson hue, seemingly the result of being stained by dried blood. People could smell the stench of blood even though he has yet to unsheath it.

They didn’t feel safe in his presence. The threat of the cold blade was ever-present, intending on decapitating them. Villains in the shadow stopped moving, not wanting to provoke the sharp saber intents.

Rat God was a ferocious demon, only second to the Ten Monsters of Chaos. Alas, it died to a single swing.

“Bloodsea Blade!” Everyone including Mad Pyromancer became alarmed after seeing him.

“Fifth-ranked…” Some villains staggered backward in fear.

This was another fierce character, ranking fifth out of the Ten Monsters. He always traveled alone and never showed mercy. His tongue was just as sharp as his blade.

Rumor has it that he came from an academy - the most prestigious yet reclusive sect of Hundred Races.

However, he never talked about his own background and the academy didn’t confirm this rumor either.

One thing was for certain - his appearance usually ended with carnage.
