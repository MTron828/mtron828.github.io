Chapter 5616: One Step


“Boom!” The enormous tsunami showed no sign of slowing down.

The middle-aged man’s expression soured and disappeared from his home. He swept all the mortals and other living beings on the island, shifting them into a beautiful forest to their confusion.

Li Qiye remained, looking at the tsunami with a semblance of a palm strike. The coconut trees were uprooted but he still relaxed on his bed as if this had nothing to do with him. Of course, he could withstand a cataclysmic assault without needing to move.

The waves suddenly split in the center, affecting the entire ocean. A woman walked out of the water and approached Li Qiye.

She wore all white. The rays from the dress resembled the light of the moon.

Sure enough, a round moon appeared in the sky and summoned other stars, changing the blue sky drastically.

The stars circled the moon and undulated like the ocean. The sky turned into an endless ocean and its sole ruler was the woman.

The stars ebbed and flowed with her emotions. With a mere blink of her eyes came daylight and with another, darkness.

The goddess of the moon’s imperial aura was suppressive. She had absolute dominion over her lunar domain.

Her aura was innate, something that couldn’t be duplicated through cultivation alone. She possessed the noblest bloodline and her appearance mirrored such.

Flawless in both appearance and divinity - a true work of art that one could never get tired of looking at.

“Bam!” Each step of her possessed immense destruction. The island couldn’t handle her presence.

Her target was Li Qiye’s chest, wanting to stomp him down to the ground.

Li Qiye wasn’t affected by the pressure and let out a sigh after staring at her immaculate face and figure.

“The flowers and trees didn’t do anything to you, why mistreat them?” He shook his head.

“I’ll mistreat you then.” Her eyes were the brightest stars. Their rays were chilling, capable of freezing cultivators.

“Boom!” A supreme dao fruit surged into the air, releasing a primal energy.

“Buzz.” It combined with the moon above and started rotating. The stars nearby awakened and formed runic lines, eventually creating a planetary maelstrom.

The souls and true fates would be sucked in by the rotation and crushed immediately.

“Boom!” She struck his chest with her palm, showing no sign of holding back.

Her hand gleamed with a lunar affinity during the attack. The light of the moon focused on a single point, freezing time and space. The dao power and laws of a lunar world struck Li Qiye in unison.

“Rumble!” This wielded enough force to end emperors and gods. Only a few selected apex cultivators could stop her.

Li Qiye reacted by raising his jellyfish, no, the great Crystalline Crab Bulwark of Indestructibility.

She entertained him by striking it directly with a planetary force, capable of ending a world.

The shield was flattened for a moment as energy coursed through its exterior. Logically, a jellyfish would be instantly pierced by this devastating attack.

However, it shrank for a bit and became unreasonably tough, seemingly possessing countless layers of stars and three thousand worlds.

Under the immense destruction of the strike, lightning crackles could be heard from the shield. Bolts surged chaotically but didn’t break through the jellyfish.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
