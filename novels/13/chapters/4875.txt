Chapter 4876: Primal Trinity Against The Heaven

After removing the palace, the top of the mountain looked rather strange. The guards noticed a square base at the bottom that wasn’t part of the palace’s foundation. However, the surface wasn’t flat and had uneven spots everywhere.

Li Qiye stood on top of it and began touching the ground. Firerage watched him and thought that the cracks were strange as well.

The breaks were clean too. Whatever caused this did it in the blink of an eye. This should be a sword slash or something similar but in that case, it shouldn’t have left these uneven spots.

He touched it himself and felt something weird. Something had seeped into the base and suddenly disappeared in the blink of an eye. It wasn’t a force he was familiar with.

“What is this place…?” He wondered.

“It’s rather extraordinary.” Li Qiye answered and then looked up in the sky: “Seems like the rumors are true, this thing didn’t die to the heavenly tribulation.”

“Your Highness, I don’t understand.” Firerage also looked up.

Li Qiye only smiled and looked down at the base of the mountain: “Bring all of them up.”

The guards brought them up and Firerage realized that the color and texture of these pieces were identical to the exposed base.

“Assemble them in the right spot.” Li Qiye led the guards in embedding the smaller stones into the uneven cracks.

During this process, Firerage understood why removing the palace was necessary. It turned out that the mountain had lost many of its pieces.

With the help of the particles found by Li Qiye, the guards were able to excavate these scattered parts and brought them back here.

Eventually, a large monument gradually appeared before them. The artistic style focused on simplicity, whether it be the faces or the attires.

It had a main giant looking up at the sky. Though its eyes were just two stones, spectators were still in awe of the vivid feeling they got from looking at it. It seemed eager to break the sky and possessed immense power.

There were three other statues next to it, far smaller in comparison. They looked like children compared to the larger piece, standing to the left, center, and right.

The one in the center had both hands raised, seemingly holding something in front of the giant’s chest. However, this piece was missing.

This could be construed as the smaller one merely carrying it or wanting to offer it to the giant.

Firerage and the guards couldn’t avert their gaze. They felt intimidated and wanted to prostrate before these statues.

Those who had grievances with the destruction of the palace no longer felt the same way. In fact, they felt that the palace was grossly misplaced in the past.

“Wow, what are they?” Firerage murmured.

“Primal Trinity Against The Heaven.” Li Qiye said.

“Primal Trinity?” Firerage stared at them and asked: “That’s referring to the smaller statues?”

“Take a closer look.” Li Qiye smiled.

Firerage listened and observed them. Although the statues were coarse and lacked details, there were still identifying characteristics.

“They represent the heaveners, diviners, and devils?” He realized.

“That’s right.” Li Qiye nodded.

“So the three races attacked the heaven?” Firerage asked.

“No, only the trinity.” Li Qiye smiled.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“So who are they?” Firerage asked during the confusing conversation.

“Wait…” He then suddenly remembered something and blurted: “Is trinity here referring to actual bloodlines?”

“Oh? You know quite a bit.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Thank you, Your Highness. His Majesty told me about it before while he researched legends about ancient bloodlines. It is said that the three races had something incredible, potentially a type of immortal blood or bloodline. They were known as Peacebringer Trinity.”

“Your Majesty has learned a lot, although this is just the tip of the iceberg.” Li Qiye said.

“So The Race possesses three wondrous bloodlines?” Firerage asked again.

“Not quite. Peacebringer Trinity is actually just one bloodline.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Mmm…” Firerage digested this information and its implications.

“Later on, it was divided into three bloodlines and the connection with those three races started.” Li Qiye stared at the statue and said: “In a distant epoch, it had a particular name.”

“Which epoch are you referring to?” Firerage became curious.

“An epoch, once whole, became divided into two halves.” Li Qiye said.

Firerage mused for a bit before responding: “Ah, the upper and lower world, right? His Majesty said that he came from the lower world known as Eight Desolaces.”

“It was known as Nine Worlds then, not Eight Desolaces.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Nine Worlds.” Firerage repeated but had no impression of this title. His knowledge came from the dao lord. For example, that Eight Desolaces was also a vast world.

“Nine worlds thirteen continents. Why don’t they ever give up?” Li Qiye murmured, the last half was only heard by him.

“Was the epoch called Nine Worlds Thirteen Continents?” Firerage asked.

“The inhabitants preferred this name but that’s not its true title. The epoch’s official name was Trinity.” [1]

“Was this epoch started by the heaveners, diviners, and devils?” Firerage inquired.

“They do not have the power to start an epoch and are merely inhabitants created by the high heaven.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Of course, there were ancient beings around when the world was divided.”

“What were they like?” Firerage couldn’t imagine those ancient beings since they were most likely more powerful than even the emperors.

“The source of the dao.” Li Qiye said: “What a shame.” [2]

The non-answer prompted Firerage to ask about something else: “Did Peacebringer Trinity start here at this point?”

“No, the primordial chaos and the start of everything are far beyond this bloodline.” Li Qiye explained.

“And these statues?” Firerage pressed on.

“Protectors of this world. They erected an eternal monument for this goal.” Li Qiye said.

“World protectors?” Firerage, for some reason, felt something ominous after hearing this.

1. There is another word for either peace or supreme with this title, but it wouldn’t flow as well for now and require more context. It is not pertinent to the current text but once it becomes relevant, I will change it. Note for search later - Trinity Epoch ☜

2. These answers are really that vague and non-direct. The translation has to be vague and confusing as well ☜
