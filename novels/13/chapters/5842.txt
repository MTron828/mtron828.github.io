Chapter 5842: Peace?

Although this wasn’t the real tree, it seemed enough for Li Qiye to dominate any individual overlord.

The presence of the five made emperors tremble. They were beings at a whole other level even for the strongest emperors, capable of deciding everyone’s fate except Li Qiye. Because of this, they had reigned in the shadows. None could truly escape their will.

“Dark Crow.” Primal Ancestor glared at Li Qiye.

The others looked as serious as could be due to the gravity of the situation. If they could kill Li Qiye, they would enjoy a delicious feast in both him and the current living beings. Losing meant potentially being devoured by Li Qiye and all of their past patience and efforts would be in vain.

Of course, they have yet to display their true strength. The thing on their mind right now was calculating and deducing Li Qiye’s true strength.

“Wasn’t easy getting all of you to show up.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We must show up for the peace of the world.” Dao Ancestor had a transcending appearance. Those who didn’t know his past would think that he was a visiting immortal from another realm.

“Oh, is that why you’re here?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Of course.” Dao Ancestor always spoke calmly regardless of the situation.

“Hahaha, I can’t hold it.” Lord of Derivation, unlike the others, pointed at Dao Ancestor and laughed: “You hairy old fool, I’m impressed that you can say this crap with a straight face.”

Dao Ancestor glared at him in response.

“I’m impressed as well, for the peace of the world? The troubles in this world are mere waves on the river of time. Emperors can cause a few bigger ones, but true discord comes from supreme overlords and epoch lords.” Li Qiye nodded. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Dark Crow, you’re one of us.” Imperial Progenitor uttered coldly.

“Yes, so I’m fully aware of how destructive we can be, a battle can bury countless beings, a single thought can reduce them to ashes.” Li Qiye said.

“Then what makes you special? To be the defender of your epoch?” Primal said.

“It’s funny for any overlord or epoch lord to make this claim.” Li Qiye smirked at him.

“How so? Plenty of overlords and epoch lords have protected epochs, fighting until death.” Stonesplitter joined the conversation.

“Yes, and they are deserving of being called wise sages. However, their greatest contribution to their epoch is death.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That I agree with, no good cultivator stands at the top. Who hasn’t devoured and destroyed? Whether it be for their own dao or to protect, their hands are stained with blood.” Derivation said.

“Yes, no one is innocent.” Li Qiye smiled.

“If this is how we want to classify cultivation, then the high heaven is the most vile devil in the world.” Imperial Progenitor said.

“That’s not wrong, the villainous heaven had destroyed more epochs than anyone, too many lives to count.” Li Qiye said.

“What’s the solution then?” Stonesplitter asked.

“What do you think? In the end, everyone fights for themselves, there are no saviors, only future destroyers.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Incorrect.” Dao Ancestor said: “Battling the heaven is a way to protect.”

“Think of those who sacrificed their epochs to forge a weapon against the heaven only to fail. And let’s pretend there’s someone with a dao heart strong enough to defeat the high heaven, what’s next?” Li Qiye asked.

The group exchanged glances.

“Go on.” Stonesplitter said.

“What would you do if you could replace the high heaven?” Li Qiye asked.

The group hasn’t quite thought about this because they merely focused on surviving, never taking a single risk.

“Hahaha, I will do what the villainous heaven hasn’t done, create the most evil and monstrous creature. Perhaps it will kill and replace me one day, wouldn’t that be fun, hahaha...” Derivation laughed.

Listeners using the mirror were at a loss for words.

“I will surpass and do better.” Dao Ancestor said.

Li Qiye shook his head and said: “In this hypothetical scenario, you cannot do better. Your dao heart and pursuit have determined your limit. A so-called high heaven made out of you is only a second-rate one. The current one is eternal and indestructible due to its indomitable dao heart, always the same after each reset.”

“Dust to dust, everything is returned to the world.” Li Qiye said: “It is greedless, something truly unique in history, and certainly worthy of its position. However, this doesn’t change the fact that it has destroyed countless epochs and lives. Your group and mine are certainly sources of disasters, but we are just drops in the ocean, nothing compared to the villainous heaven.”

They didn’t expect the conversation to flow like this.

“Then what we’ve done isn’t quite wrong.” Primal said coldly with a faint smile.

“Haha, right or wrong, who gives a damn? We are the lords of everything, let the ants live or kill them, what’s not permissible?” Derivation laughed heartily.
