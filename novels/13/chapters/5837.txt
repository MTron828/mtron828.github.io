Chapter 5837: Silencing

Countless hell gates to allow an easier flow of the curses around Li Qiye. Their hatred and wrath were the vilest things in the world - indiscernible yet destructive. They aimed to invade his head, wanting to overwhelm his mind and take over.

“Boom!” Li Qiye created a primordial world to stop the incoming hellish curses, seemingly amused by the fight.

“Go!” The four possessed emperors attacked in unison.

“Divine Beast Annihilation!” Hao Hai swung his blade with all of his might to sever everything in existence.

“Dao Slash!” Sword utilized the pinnacle of the sword dao, proving its supremacy by extinguishing all other dao. This could leave an emperor as helpless as a mortal since they no longer had access to their cultivation.

“I Reign Trinity!” Nether’s disk transformed into a primal anima. Its descent would cause everything to explode.

“Scriptures Dao Morph.” Profound tapped into the potential of the heavenly scriptures and created a realm of refinement beneath his shroud. The start of the new dao and the birth of all living beings were under the scriptures’ adjudication.

The four overlords’ attack frightened and astounded spectators. However, what astounded them was the target - Lord of Derivation instead of Li Qiye.

“What?!” They weren’t seeing things - the four decisively attacked Lord of Derivation.

“!!!” The three immortals didn’t expect this either.

Everyone believed they were here to do everything they could to eliminate Li Qiye. This betrayed their expectations.

“You?!” Derivation became enraged. He was endowed with unparalleled intelligence, albeit lacking an understanding of the ways of the world, especially the treacherous heart of his allies.

“Myriad Race Extinguishment!” He roared and channeled all of his power into the drum.

“Boom!” All the figures on the surface seemingly sacrificed themselves. Their blood and life force focused on stopping the backstabbers.

Derivation found himself in a precarious situation. Earlier, he had aimed his attack at Li Qiye and now, needing to hastily diverge it in another direction. This greatly limited its potency.

“They want to silence him.” After a moment of reflection, spectators realized the four’s goal.

Derivation had threatened to reveal their secrets to Li Qiye. Therefore, they made a quick decision and chose to silence him forever.

“Boom!” His weakened curses couldn’t protect him from the combined onslaught.

“Damn you, Prima...” His body was pierced and devastated by numerous explosions.

Alas, he couldn’t finish speaking before exploding into countless pieces. Black blood and rotten flesh splattered everywhere in space.

Meanwhile, everyone thought Li Qiye would attack Derivation as well. In reality, he took one step backward to dodge the remnant curses.

“Boom!” The image of his primordial tree released rays in the direction of the four possessed emperors. They coiled around the targets instead of piercing them. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Buzz.” Sword, Profound, and Hao Hai’s forehead flashed brightly in harmonization with the rays, granting them lucidity once more.

“Clank!” They immediately released dao chains to trap Nether and dragged him to the primordial tree.

“What are you doing?!” Nether woke up as well but it was already too late.
