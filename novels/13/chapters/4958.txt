Chapter 4959: Useless

With a resounding boom, the youthful monarch unveiled a treasure that glimmered like the sun. But instead of radiating light, it pulsed with a sacred aura, exuding otherworldly holiness.

This affinity enveloped the mountain and made students weak in the knees. They couldn’t handle the purification and felt the urge to worship the light, wanting to become a part of it.

“Solar Illumination.” They were startled at the loss of control due to the treasure hovering above him.

He personally crafted this true fate weapon and could use it better than anyone else.

“Attack!” He ordered Swordgrasp and Halo.

“Very well. Brat, prepare to die, King’s Ascension!” The hot-headed Halo was the first to make a move.

Thousands and thousands of halos appeared above him; each represented the power of a unique celestial dao. He became a cosmic king with the myriad dao in his grasp, smashing Halo Disk downward mercilessly.

“So strong!” Students bellowed in horror and turned pale.

“As strong as an insect.” Li Qiye smiled and simply raised the dao controller.

“Boom!” There seemed to be an endless expanse above Li Qiye, capable of absorbing all offenses. Thus, Halo Disk became useless.

This was akin to a hammer smashing a mountain of cotton. The entire force was absorbed effortlessly.

The crowd didn’t expect this result - this was akin to an unceasing thunderstorm only to end with a pitiful amount of rain.

“How can this be?!” Students shouted.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Sword, obey my command!” Swordgrasp immediately made his move: “Overturn the heaven, break all hells!”

A beam pulsed upward from his heavenly sword. All of his dao comprehension gathered into this single slash.

Students felt as if they were witnessing the pinnacle of the sword dao. Very few of them could actually stop it.

“Pop!” Alas, it couldn’t pierce Li Qiye’s neck. He merely raised the dao controller forward and easily stopped it.

The illusory expanse around Li Qiye prevented anything from getting close. In fact, both attacks were useless and only caused minor ripples - the same effect as children throwing rocks into a river.

“This doesn’t make any sense… is Skyquake Dao Controller this incredible?” One student commented.

The young monarch's countenance darkened as he gazed upon the struggling efforts of his allies, unable to penetrate the enemy's defense. His jealousy intensified; he already knew that it was wondrous but not to this level.

“Primal Light!” He roared and activated his sacred fruit, resulting in a blinding eruption.

The artifact known as Solar Illumination harnessed its full might and unleashed a barrage of energy toward Li Qiye.

Students couldn’t open their eyes to watch the blast. Some were sent flying from the remnant energy waves and rolled down the mountain.

“Boom!” Li Qiye did the same thing again, just raising the dao controller forward. He didn’t become obliterated by the light but easily stopped it.

This attack was a hundred times stronger since it came from a dragon lord. Moreover, the young monarch exercised caution by letting his allies go first.

He thought that he had picked the perfect spot to strike given Li Qiye’s reactions to the previous two attacks. It ended with him throwing a slightly-larger rock into the river, nothing more.

“So this is the dao controller.” Jian Yunyun, Goldcrest, and Ming Shi became slack-jawed.

“Is this the best artifact here?” One student believed that it might be the best one in the academy.

“Jun Landu must have been unstoppable.” His friend said, unable to accept the fact that someone had given this artifact up and faded into obscurity.
