Chapter 5580: My son Possesses The Same Disposition As Supreme

The words engulfed the world like a tsunami. Celestial lights manifested into reality as if numerous North Stars were descending.

People looked up and saw too many to count. Although the descending lights were mere particles, they felt as heavy as the planets themselves in people’s heart.

This resulted in a suffocating feeling. Big shots dropped down on their knees; emperors and monarchs shuddered from the weight of the galaxy.

On the other hand, as the particles bore down on his body, Li Qiye merely shrugged to repel this oppressive force.

“Boom!” This divinity immediately disappeared.

The newcomer had no choice but to activate his power to stop himself from being blown away. Sacred fruits appeared around an immortal shell, eventually creating a sacred tree.

The power of anima was incredible - capable of creating three thousand worlds and reversing time. Everything started with anima, or the true self.

“A sacred tree!” Spectators became emotional.

This tree was the perfect place for dao search since it seemed to be the origin of all the laws and mysteries of the world.

They looked up and saw a youth wearing an imperial robe. His presence and aura were second to none. His black hair draped downward like a heavenly waterfall; his eyes contained a chilling light and a boundless ocean of lightning.

This youth had the potential to surpass anyone in the crowd - a dragon lord capable of commanding dao lords and conquerors. The size of his sacred tree left everyone in astonishment - a sign of his powerful cultivation.

Even Six-finger Conqueror and his allies couldn’t defeat the youth. After all, they only had twelve dao fruits with no access to anima.

“North Star Grand Saint!” Some shouted his title - one that was known across the immortal continent.

He was virtually unbeatable among the young generation and was competitive with the older seniors as well.

His given name was Wang Teng - the son of Turmoil Conqueror. He was the reason for his father’s pride and arrogance.

My son possesses the same disposition as Supreme - this comment had spread across the continent.

Some might chuckle after hearing this careless comment but they would sing a different tune after seeing Wang Teng in person.

Supreme could be considered the greatest within the recent eras - the strongest dragon lord when not counting Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He was a pioneer capable of finding a new path for the dragon lord. His status in Celestial Court was rumored to be the same as Heaven Burial and Light-dragon Conqueror.

Thus, how could Wang Teng be compared to Supreme? That’s utterly ridiculous, or so people thought.

Seeing him and his gigantic sacred tree changed everyone’s opinion. The words of Turmoil Conqueror echoed in their mind.

They started believing him. Although Wang Teng was weaker, perhaps he would be able to catch up to Supreme after another century of cultivation.

“Please show mercy, Sir. I apologize if we have done anything to offend you.” North Star Grand Saint said seriously.

“Unfortunately, your apology isn’t worth much.” Li Qiye smiled and still reached for the dao fruits.

“Save me, my son!” Turmoil’s face changed drastically for he knew that he was at the gates of death. His survival instinct caused him to scream for help.

A conqueror normally didn’t fear death. However, he wasn’t mentally prepared to die today. This ending would be too shocking and full of indignation.

It was different to die after a hard-fought battle instead of being crushed like an ant. It would trivialize all of his lifelong accomplishments.

“Stop!” Wang Teng shouted in astonishment, wanting to save his father despite knowing that he wasn’t Li Qiye’s match.

Nonetheless, he knew that his clan still had his back.

“Boom!” He summoned his North Star Truncheon - a weapon spewing out a considerable torrent of chaos true energy. Runes of immense weight appeared around it as well.

“Die!” He recklessly attacked, having no other choice.

The truncheon crushed the stars and all dao laws, reducing space into the void.

Unfortunately, he didn’t hold back and obliterated many big shots in the process. Emperors and monarchs were startled after seeing this.
