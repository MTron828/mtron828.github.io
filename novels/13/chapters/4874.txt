Chapter 4875: Lesson

“Boom!” The entire region shook violently after Li Qiye was pushed into the ground.

A’zhui appeared above him and sent another wave of attack in the blink of an eye, creating a deep pit beneath and burying him.

She then landed and heaved a sigh of relief while the others exchanged glances.

She thought that this was the end of the battle but they disagreed. As for Firerage, he didn’t want anything to happen to Li Qiye or it would be his fault for letting this continue.

“Remove one brick from the palace and I will have your dog life.” She declared.

“Bam!” Dirt and debris scattered as Li Qiye leaped out of the pit without a single speck of first on him.

“That’s it? Can’t even injure a mortal shell.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“!” Her eyes were wide open with astonishment since she had gone full strength in that attack. Alas, she didn’t even remove a single hair, let alone hurting him.

“My turn, be ready.” He said.

“Boom!” She gathered energy and a tornado formed around her.

However, he teleported in front of her and forced the tornado back inside her body.

“Eight-stallion Force!” She roared and the bracelet vibrated continuously. A tsunami of energy descended against Li Qiye.

“Boom!” He merely punched the air and the tsunami was sent back straight at her.

“Ugh…” She vomited blood as a result.

“Die!” Nonetheless, she still let out a battle roar in spite of the worsening outlook. The bracelet became resplendent as dao spears manifested into reality, ready to pierce Li Qiye.

The same thing repeated. The all-piercing spears seemed as fragile as paper before his fist. All of them were sent back into her body as well.

“Damn it!” Northern Monarch lost her cool and took one step forward.

However, the dragon god blocked her with one hand and shook his head.

Since he was stronger, he could see that Li Qiye had no intention of harming the little girl.

“Rumble!” Every time she attacked, he would send back an equivalent level of power at her.

She became as red as a heated soldering iron. Her struggle was useless because he seemed to be an iron statue sending back attacks straight at her.

“Boom!” Who knows how many times she had gotten punched by this point?

Finally, she fell hard to the ground and spat out blood.

Li Qiye landed on the ground and patted the dust off his shoulder: “Train harder, you have zero chance of killing me with your shoddy cultivation.”

He then turned around and walked away while ordering Firerage: “Destroy it.”

“I’m going to kill you!” A’zhui got up and rushed at him again, furious.

However, Northern Monarch immediately grabbed her.

“Do it.” Firerage gave the order to his men.

“Noo-” She cried out before fainting from being overwhelmed emotionally.

Northern Monarch checked her wrist to read the pulses and energy flow. The girl was perfectly fine.

The dragon god came over and did the same. He felt the majestic power of a dao lord surging inside her. There was no doubt that the six dao fruits have fused perfectly with her.

“His Majesty’s six supreme dao fruits are in there without any repercussion.” The dragon god became speechless.

Northern Monarch gasped after hearing this.

“Im-impossible. Even His Majesty can’t do something like this.” Northern Monarch checked again and sure enough, his dao lord power was forming in there like a hurricane.

The dao lord had thought about imprinting his grand dao into his beloved daughter in order to give her an incredible foundation.

Alas, she was too young and couldn’t withstand its presence. The best he could do was just give her various blessings.

These blessings were limited and couldn’t compare to the seal of the six dao fruits at all, hence the need for the bracelet.

When she used the bracelet against him earlier, he managed to send the perfect amount back at her each time through his apogee in cultivation.

He treated her as a block of metal, hammering repeatedly until the supreme grand dao completely fused with her.

The dao lord couldn’t do so due to her limited constitution. Just one mistake could reduce her to ashes. He wasn’t at the level where he could perfectly embed power at just the right amount while Li Qiye could do so effortlessly.

The group was completely stunned to see Li Qiye - a seemingly average cultivator - doing something the dao lord couldn’t.

They thought about it and no one in the three lower continents could do so either, not Conceal Conqueror either.

“Prepare the coronation.” The dragon gold told her: “The dynasty needs to be at ease soon.”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Northern Monarch agreed and carried A’zhui away.

Meanwhile, members of the imperial guard were busy removing the palace. It didn’t take long before only the mountain base was left.

Of course, they couldn’t damage the mountain base at all. The material seemed to be made from something incredible.

As for the rest of the dynasty, they were furious to see this. The palace was a symbol of greatness in their eyes. Now, this nobody wanted to erase their dao lord’s vestige?

Alas, there was nothing they could do since the dragon god and Northern Monarch supported this.
