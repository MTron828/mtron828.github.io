Chapter 5276: Fortune-telling

“Fortune-telling, fortune-telling, fortune telling…” An old man on the street repeated this phrase like an emotionless machine only capable of one thing. The tone and pace remained exactly the same.

His robe had patches on them but was as clean as can be - an indicator of his meticulous personality. He seemed to be visually impaired, unable to see anyone passing by. His only companion was the sun and the repeated chant with no end in sight.

He had a bamboo stick that was most likely used for walking. It also resembled a staff meant for striking snakes. It had eight colors, seemingly polished to have a glazed texture. Its shine tempted others to touch and feel its surface.

Thus, more people actually paid attention to his stick rather than him despite his bizarre nature.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Li Qiye was one of them. He stopped and took a look at the old fortune-teller.

Li Zhitan and the others paused as well. The old servant noticed the stick: “This bamboo stick…”

“Fortune-telling?” The old man’s tone finally changed after noticing someone standing in front of him.

“Accurate?” Li Qiye sighed and asked.

“Absolutely accurate, and it is also free.” The old man said.

“Free?” Li Zhitian became curious.

“Fortune-telling is peering into the wills of the heaven. There cannot be a payment or a tribulation is inevitable.” The old man said seriously.

“That’s a thing?” Zhitian was surprised once more.

“Allow me to read your fortune to dispel any skepticism.” The old man reached for Zhitian’s hand.

He couldn’t dodge the old man’s advance despite being a twelve-fruit dragon lord.

“Very well, Sir. Please read my fortune.” Since he was caught already, he decided to go with the flow.

The old man held Zhitian’s palm and started gently tracing the lines, needing to rely on the touch instead of his eyes.

“Your fate is vast.” After a while, the old man concluded.

“What do you mean by that?” Zhitian asked.

“A fate encompassing vast possibilities and branches but most importantly, avoiding the great calamities.” The old man continued: “As long as your heart is kind and compassionate, your remaining years will be filled with glory and success. I offer you two words, benevolent heart.”

“Benevolent heart.” Zhitian murmured.

“Please read my fortune.” The old servant became interested and offered his hand.

The fortune-teller held his hand and gently traced the palm: “Your fate is very thick.”

“How so?” The old servant asked for elaboration.

“A profound and far-reaching destiny, albeit progressing at a snail’s pace. Small steps are needed before covering great distances.” The old man said: “You do have a lucky star. With their help, you will attain indescribable prosperity and fulfillment.”

“Thank you, Sir.” The old servant bowed and didn’t ask for much more. Knowing too much about the future might not be a good thing.

“Raa!” True Bear became interested as well and touched the old fortune-teller’s hand.

Li Zhitian chuckled after seeing the excited bear. Of course, he didn’t think the old fortune-teller would have a problem with this because the bear was sentient.

The old man didn’t refuse and started tracing the paw earnestly, seemingly checking the shape of the bones.

“Your fate is filled with adversity and fatal perils. They are unavoidable and you will have a hard time escaping from their clutches. However, if you encounter noble individuals, prosperity and opportunities will replace disasters.” The old man concluded.

“Raa.” The bear let out a quiet cry and seemingly bowed to show his gratitude.

“Fortune-telling, fortune-telling, fortune-telling…” The old man went back to chanting as if it was as crucial as breathing.

He paused for a moment and stared at Li Qiye: “Do you want your fortune told?”

“My fate isn’t an easy one to be read.” Li Qiye smiled.

“All fates can be examined. Good or bad, that is up to the heaven.” The old man said.

“True.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement.

“So how about it?” The old man insisted.

Li Qiye stared at the old man before letting out a soft sigh. He raised his hand and said: “Can’t refuse a free reading, I suppose. Go for it.”

The old man’s expression became solemn the moment he touched Li Qiye’s hand. As the assessment continued, it became increasingly grave. He then let go of the hand.

“How is it?” Li Qiye asked.

“Your fate is as noble as the heaven, I can’t and shouldn’t read it.” The old man shook his head.

“Yes, I myself can’t delve too deeply into it, let alone others.” Li Qiye agreed.

“As noble as the heaven.” The old man remained tight-lipped as if these secrets shouldn’t be revealed.

“Have you read your own fortune?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes, a destined death.” The old man said.

“If you have foreseen it, why not walk a different path?” Li Qiye asked.

“I do not fear what is written in my destiny. In fact, using my life to prove my fate is the truth.” The old man said.

“Death is the end, only bones remain.” Li Qiye said.

“Everlasting life means countless bones.” The old man responded.

“Can’t argue with that.” Li Qiye nodded and stared into the distance: “Where should I go from here?”

“Not to be foretold, and it shouldn’t be either.” The old man had an answer.

“How so?” Li Qiye pressed on.

“Everything about you is already predetermined whether I calculate or otherwise.” The old man said.

“If that’s the case, maybe I should just go be a shepherd.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“But that is not your fate, so you won’t.” The man said.

“I determine my fate, not the heaven.” Li Qiye said.

“And if you’re you?” The old man answered with a question.

“Huh…” Li Qiye smiled wryly and stroked his chin: “I see, that is a compelling argument. If I’m the heaven and my fate is determined by me, then it is still the heaven’s decision. Seems like I’m digging my own grave.”

“This is your destiny.” The old man couldn’t help but say.

“Unfortunately, I’m not a believer. My fate is stronger and so is my determination and dao heart. Fate cannot dictate my path.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You are one of the few who speaks such words, perhaps the only one who is carrying it out.” The old man said.

“I am alone on this path toward the dao, so I won’t allow the heaven to outmatch my fate.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see…” The old man contemplated in silence.

“We are all insignificant ants.” he commented after a while.

“Yes, but it is worthwhile to become an ant capable of baring its fangs.” Li Qiye said.

“Toward whom?” The old man asked.

“That depends on the toughness of the ant’s dao heart.” Li Qiye smiled.
