Chapter 5310: A Madman

The ghost and blood race remained to the present. However, their origin consisted of numerous tales and speculations.

No one could verify the truth at this point so they were used for the sake of gossiping and storytelling in tea houses.

As a member of Imperial, Li Zhitian enjoyed a rich education. He had read many stories regarding these two races.

“Is there any truth to these stories?” Li Zhitian took advantage of this opportunity and asked Li Qiye.

“Have you ever thought that they might share the same progenitor?” Li Qiye said casually.

“The same progenitor?” Zhitian was surprised: “Young Noble, are you saying that someone… someone chose to copulate with blood-sucking creatures and corpses…?”

He thought that this person’s perversion was out of control, going as far as sleeping with nasty creatures and potentially corpses.

Although cultivators at the apex were unbound by trivial matters and conventional perspectives, this was still a bit too much to accept. After thinking about it for a bit, Zhitian felt slightly nauseous.

“Mad is the right adjective here.” Li Qiyhe said.

“Is it all true, not fabricated at all?” Zhitian remained skeptical.

“How did those two races come into being then? No one else can create races outside of the high heaven.” Li Qiye said.

“How long did it take for a new race to populate?” Li Zhitian thought about it and the reproduction process must have been lengthy.

“Think about why the purest ones and the evil creatures no longer exist.” Li Qiye responded.

Zhitian shuddered, thinking that something terrible must have happened.

“The population kept on expanding until they became a new race.” The old servant murmured and grossed Zhitian out.

“The person who started this is something else. Seems like there’s nothing they won’t do.” Zhitian smiled wryly.

“Do you think this is limited to just the ghost and blood race?” Li Qiye said.

“There are more?” Zhitian stared at Li Qiye in disbelief.

“There were previous experiments, albeit failed experiments. Some can be considered predecessors to the aforementioned races. For example, the forsaken blood or in short, the forsaken.” Li Qiye said.

“The forsaken.” Zhitian said: “This mythical race existed too?”

He had heard stories about them as well - physically repulsive creatures that should only belong in nightmares.

“Yes, another derivation. Have a look at this world.” Li Qiye said.

“It has something to do with the derivation process?” He asked.

“Yes, an utterly evil and foul process happened here.” Li Qiye said.

“Young Noble, are you saying that these races were all derived here?” He speculated.

“Think about the four broken realms. Redflood is broken due to a refinement attempt, it is worse for Reborn.” Li Qiye said.

“What did they try to refine?” He asked.

“A supreme weapon.” Li Qiye revealed.

“A supreme weapon?” He thought about it and everything made sense.

Redflood contained countless broken weapons and blacksmithing materials, not to mention the most obvious hint - the molten liquid.

“The five immortal armaments, right?” The old servant said softly.

“You know a lot.” Li Qiye smiled at him.

“Just a little bit.” He bowed humbly.

“The five armor sets came from Redflood? Who created them then?” Zhitian took a deep breath after learning a new secret regarding the distant past.

“The pioneer of a new treasure system.” Li Qiye paused and stared at them for emphasis: “The majority of treasures you see now were refined with this system.”

“That’s incredible.” He murmured, aware of the significance.

Such a pioneer of the current treasure system must have been a peerless paragon - a being to be respected by even apex emperors and dao lords. After all, everyone was walking on the path built by this pioneer.

“How should we properly address this pioneer?” The old servant bowed and asked.

“Stonesplitter Patriarch.” Li Qiye said slowly. [1]

“Stonesplitter Patriarch.” The old servant and Li Zhitian exchanged glances, having heard this title for the first time.

“What a cultivator, blessing the world and future descendants with a new prosperous path.” Zhitian murmured.

“I wouldn’t be so sure about that. Have you heard of epoch paragon artifacts?” Li Qiye seemed amused by this praise.

“Yes, the strongest artifact of an epoch. As far as I know, Celestial Court has one.” The old servant became emotional.

“Do you know how to craft one?” Li Qiye asked Zhitian.

“How? With the pioneer’s system?” Zhitian didn’t feel like this was a positive matter.
