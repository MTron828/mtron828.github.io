Chapter 5273: Find That Sheep

“You’re being too much, don’t call me a little goblin! You can’t call me that!” The little guy started yelling.

Unfortunately, his wrathful declaration fell upon deaf ears. Thus, he gave up and ran into the crowd, also disappearing.

Li Zhitian found the whole incident absurd. However, similar events happened several times during their stay.

“Raa!” A white tiger twice the size of a regular one appeared before them. Its aura had the immensity of a great mountain; it seemed capable of taking down any foe with a single pounce. Irs roar alone instilled fear into the heart of all listeners.

“Do you need a mount? There is a fee.” It spoke to the group.

“My feet are a little tired.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Climb up, pay whatever tip you want.” The tiger crouched down before Li Qiye who casually tossed a few things.

The tiger ate them and accepted the payment. With that, Li Qiye rode the beast through the city with the group walking behind.

The old servant had rich experiences in life. Nonetheless, he still found this place particularly strange.

Li Zhitian stopped again to assess the crowd. They all had normal expressions and went on with their lives, whether it be the servants or the merchants. They looked rather satisfied with their current life.

“Buzz.” Now, a radiant winged figure appeared above, looking like a god. Feathers made out of light scattered downward and touched the ground, causing it to light up.

“Ladies and gentlemen, Celestial Court orders deployment for another expedition!” The figure shouted.

The old servant and Li Zhitian shuddered after hearing this.

“Scram!” Those on the streets shouted back.

“Don’t be unreasonable now!” The figure shouted.

“Scram!” The inhabitants of the city including Li Qiye’s tiger took out a slingshot and started shooting at the figure.

“Pluff! Pluff!” Countless marbles struck the figures and tore the feathers off. Now, the figure looked like a plucked chicken, no longer as imperious as before.

His appearance prompted the group to break out in laughter.

The figure got up after the barrage and instantly ran away. Everyone returned to their previous task; life in the city resumed.

“I don’t get this place.” Li Zhitian was startled again. The inhabitants here couldn’t be bothered with anything.

“Everyone has an inner self that can only be unleashed at certain moments.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Unfortunately, few have the privilege of living the way they want.”

“What does inner self mean in this case?” Li Zhitian asked. He knew about anima, or the true self, in terms of cultivation.

“You are from Imperial Clan, born with matchless nobility. But if you actually want to be a humble potato seller and find great joy in this life, this would be your inner self.” Li Qiye said while glancing at the youth: “Apart from aspiring to reach the apex, have you ever thought about what else you would want to do in life?”

“Hmm…” He hasn’t thought of this question before because his fate was determined since birth.

Their clan had an exalted history. The Qian was arguably superior but they were gone now. Their progenitor, Crimson Emperor, was unbeatable. In the present, Immensity Conqueror also dominated.

He, Li Zhitian, was born with an exceptional gift. Thus, cultivation was his path. His future was rather obvious - a supreme genius looming above all.

Therefore, he had never thought about any other path. He only wanted to follow in the footsteps of the progenitor and Immensity Conqueror.

“It seems sad when you put it this way, Young Noble. I haven’t really thought about what I truly want to do.” Li Zhitian smiled wryly.

“It’s alright. I myself had the desire of opening a small shop decorated with bright lanterns at night, living my remaining years selling random things.” The old servant interjected.

Li Zhitian knew that the old man was stronger than him. This lifestyle didn’t fit such a powerful cultivator.

“Raa!” True Bear joined the conversation.

Li Qiye smiled and said: “I know, you want to find a cute female bear and have a nice family of cubs.”

“I know what I want to do too.” The tiger said: “Entering the mortal world and enjoying good food and drink.”

“Master, what is your strongest desire?” The old servant boldly asked.

Li Qiye chuckled and stared at the horizon: “If my current self were to not exist, then the thing I want to do the most is to find that sheep.”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“What sheep?” Li Zhitian didn’t understand.

The old servant pondered in silence while True Bear let out another cry.

“The inner self.” Li Zhitian looked around and thought about his own situation.

What would he truly want to do if he wasn’t affected by external circumstances? He never thought about it before but now, he was rather curious about the answer.
