The piercing gaze could kill the gods without difficulty. Bai Jinning became frozen even though it wasn’t pointed at her. She felt completely insignificant and trivial as a result.

“Alright, just remember that once you take the next step, they will try to annihilate you for peace of mind.” The old man contemplated before telling Li Qiye.

“As if we can escape by not moving forward. No one is that lucky. Three Immortals is blessed not like other places but how much longer do you think this will last? Perhaps it is targeted now.” Li Qiye smiled. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You’re right. It was our fault anyway for inviting this greed.” The old man nodded.

“It’s really only a matter of time. The starving existences have an incredible sense of smell so they’ll find this place one day or another. It is enough to fill their belly.” Li Qiye said.

“True, that’s why no one can escape, neither you nor me.” The old man accepted the grim reality.

“The only way is to fight until death, otherwise, this state will always be the same. Escaping won’t solve anything.” Li Qiye said seriously.

“What happens when one obtains victory? They’ll just replace it, this is an endless cycle.” The old man smiled.

“I’ve told people this old story before. A warrior slaying a dragon only to find that the dragon used to be a great warrior. However, my dao heart is unbreakable. I am a dragonslayer, not someone who will turn into a dragon!” Li Qiye said.

The old man’s eyes became profound, vast enough to encompass Three Immortals. Everything was as tiny as a speck of dust in his eyes. This seemed to be an attempt at reading Li Qiye’s future.

“I should have faith in you. Perhaps one day you will be able to do it.” He eventually said.

“No, don’t believe in me.” Li Qiye shook his head: “You should believe in yourself. Are you a dragonslayer or a dragon? Or another existence, such as the villager or a saint?”

“Nothing good comes from being a saint.” The old man said.

“Who actually has a good ending on this path? No one. Even the villagers have to offer sacrifices.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Maybe just being a mortal is best. The insects of summer do not worry about the coldness of winter.” The old man became slightly emotional.

“Can you handle being an insect? If not, then at least try. Who cares what the world thinks?” Li Qiye said.

“Mmm...” The old man chuckled: “Well, in terms of history, you and I are just specks of dust. We’ll disappear in the rain.”

“No, the world shall exist with me.” Li Qiye revealed a transcending smile.

“We’re inferior to you in this regard.” The old man shook his head.

“Because you are saints. There are things you couldn’t let go of and they hold you back.” Li Qiye said.

“Perhaps, no need to think about these matters that are still so far away. Just fixing the wall is good enough, and maybe having peace during our old age. That’s perfect.” The old man replied.

“That’s easier said than done. If you can actually uphold this mentality and let go, then it’s possible. I don’t think you can do it though.” Li Qiye smiled.

“There will be people after us that will take over our burden.” The old man had an insightful gaze into the future.

“I hope you will have great successors. Unfortunately, I probably won’t see that day, it’s too far away.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sounds pessimistic.” The old man shook his head.

“Is it? Your group hasn’t been able to let go after so many years. One day, maybe some will reach your height but what will they become? Dragonslayers, dragons, or saints?” Li Qiye chuckled.

His eyes became serious as he stared straight at the old man and warned: “Cultivation isn’t important at our level, dao heart is where the emphasis should be. Worry about who they will become instead.”

“Let’s drop this issue.” The old man smiled and shook his head.

“Fine with me, it’s not my Three Immortals World. No need for me to worry about it.” Li Qiye responded.

“Let’s move soon, we need the goods right awa-...” The old man said.

“Don’t be so hasty. You’ve waited so long already, what’s a bit more waiting?” Li Qiye interrupted him.

“Alright, we’ll wait for you in the ocean. You’ll know how to find us then.” The old man smiled and became increasingly ethereal before disappearing altogether.

“Where, where did he go?” Jinning was shocked to see the old man seemingly melding and becoming one with space.

“He left.” Li Qiye got up and stretched, ready to leave.

“Why are you following me?” He didn’t get far before stopping to smile at her.

“Who, who says I’m following you?” She dodged his gaze before responding: “We just happen to be walking in the same direction. Sky Pass doesn’t belong to you either so I have the right to walk on these streets.”

For some strange reasons, her voice was filled with timidity. She was a little afraid of him right now after seeing his gaze prior.

He was still the same as always - just another regular man. But now, she felt as if she was being stared at by a primordial beast. There was a sense of looming danger.

“Makes sense.” Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t mind being followed.

She mustered courage out of nowhere, perhaps fueled by curiosity about Li Qiye.

“Who was that earlier?” She said softly.

“The strongest existence of your world.” Li Qiye glanced back at the girl and said.

“Nonsense.” She scoffed. Albeit, the volume this time was far quieter than her previous display of contempt and disbelief.

“I always speak the truth.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Everyone knows that in the present days, Luminous Master is the strongest. That person wasn’t him.” She tilted her head in contemplation.

“Luminous Master is only an ant or a speck of dust.” Li Qiye commented.

“Shhh!” She was scared out of her mind after hearing this and gestured with her finger on her lips: “You’ll lose your head if anyone else hears this comment.”

“Is it that serious?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“I’m not messing around. Luminous Master is admired by everyone. Your insult earlier would make you the number one public enemy.” Bai Jinning leaned in closer and whispered.

This was indeed the truth. Luminous Master had plenty of followers and admirers in Immortal Lineage. They wouldn’t forgive Li Qiye for insulting him.

“Bunch of idiots.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Are you tired of living? Plus, Luminous Master and you probably don’t have any feud, why do you need to insult him?”

“Once again, I’m just staying the truth. Must I praise him as the strongest like the rest?” Li Qiye said.

“He is the strongest.” Jinning said.
