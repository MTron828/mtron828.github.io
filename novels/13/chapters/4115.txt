Chapter 4116: Tortoise Monarch Island

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Rumble!” Explosions and grinding accompanied the legion’s marching.

“Seven Nights Immortal, utterly” The chant became louder and louder.

New spectators found the entire thing bizarre. Today, Li Qiye assaulted the bandits’ lair in such a pompous and arrogant manner.

“I can’t remember the last time anyone did this to Cloud Dream Lake.” An expert said.

“It’s a blatant provocation. What is he trying to do?” An older expert wondered.

Li Qiye had a penchant for offending great powers, from Sea Emperor to Armament. People had thought that he was dead for sure. Alas, he was still perfectly well right now, seemingly ready to humiliate and stomp on the bandits’ faces.

“Seems like he wants to go big, his forces are growing stronger too, not that this matters. When he was all alone, he still dared to provoke Sea Emperor. Now, he certainly isn’t afraid of Cloud Dream Lake. I wonder if these bandits will have the power and decisiveness necessary to stop him, the insane monster.” One elder commented.

By this point, they would find it weirder if Li Qiye wasn’t being arrogant and overbearing.

“Maybe, he already has enough money. If he can take over Cloud Dream, he’ll eventually have a stable income source as well.” A big shot guessed Li Qiye’s goal.

After all, he destroyed one island already. They thought that taking over was the plan; that’s the reasoning behind recruiting an entire legion. Momentum was on his side - it was time for him to expand his reach and start his own sect. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Cloud Dream was a famous destination for trading. If he were to take over, he would have a stable source of income by creating a trade alliance.

Moreover, he would be praised for attacking the bandits in Cloud Dream as well. No one would criticize him for getting rid of villains.

All of these reasons contributed to their speculation of him wanting to seize Cloud Dream.

Meanwhile, the other seventeen islands felt nervous as well and paid close attention to the situation. They even mobilized and were ready for a potential battle. Dark Gale Camp has been informed as well.

The destruction of Dark Dragon Island took them by surprise due to its unprecedented nature. Dark Dragon Island went down too quickly so they didn’t have time to take advantage of the situation.

“He’s heading for Tortoise Monarch Island.” Someone noticed the direction of Li Qiye’s legion: “Is that his next target?”

“If that’s the case, then he’ll be officially declaring war on all the bandits.” An older expert became startled.

“At least we’ll have a fun show, maybe a big battle.” Other cultivators caught news of this and started flying over.

“This might be a good development in the grand scheme of things.” Someone who had suffered at the hand of Cloud Dream became happy.

“Hmm, Tortoise Monarch Island is probably the strongest when not counting Dark Gale Camp.” Another stated.

An elder nodded in agreement: “Yes, and the turtle monarch is older than Cloud Dream King. He was already the island lord before Cloud Dream King took over Dark Gale Camp. His island is also the most peaceful and prosperous. They might be bandits but still uphold some rules and creeds, that’s why traders go there the most.”

What was the main attraction of Cloud Dream Lake? Clearly its black market and freedom in selling goods of questionable origin. A relatively lawful place like Tortoise Monarch Island was perfect.

The place was large and consisted of several islands connected together. From a distance, it looked like a black turtle relaxing on top of the lake. The “head” of the turtle had a massive peak reaching the clouds.

It had numerous cities and towns with no lack of shops. To a certain extent, the island has become something more than a lair for bandits. Some even came here to live and do business.

Today, alarm gongs were struck throughout the island.

“Back to your spot!” The bandits of the island became anxious. Of course, in Tortoise Monarch, they resembled guards and soldiers more.

“War?” Its inhabitants were tense and nervous since they considered the island their home. It was far better than the other seventeen islands.

Beams of light surrounded the island. A massive turtle seemingly came back to life. Barriers manifested into reality.

“That’s a strong defense.” One observer praised.

“Yes, it’s comparable to many great powers. The tortoise monarch’s status is comparable to Cloud Dream King.” One high elder remarked.

“Young Noble, that island is Tortoise Monarch.” Xu Yiyun told Li Qiye.

“Looks like we aren’t welcomed here.” Li Qiye lazily glanced at it.

She smiled wryly in response. It’s because they just took down Dark Dragon Island. Regardless of its relationship with Dark Dragon, of course this island wouldn’t welcome them.

“What is your intention, Fellow Daoist?” An ancient voice came from the island.

“That’s the tortoise monarch.” Someone immediately recognized him.

“Just a little business, that’s all.” Li Qiye smiled after hearing the voice.

“Tortoise Monarch Island welcomes all around the world.” The monarch replied: “It is an honor to have you here, Fellow Daoist. However, the island is too small and has no room for your legion…”

He paused for a second before continuing: “if you wish to do business here, please have your men camp outside and come in alone.”

The listeners thought that the monarch was being rather polite to Li Qiye.
