Chapter 5231: Tetra-War Bronze Chariot

The others patiently planned their next move, whether to bid for Heaven Reckon.

Suppression Conqueror was the first to become impatient and ordered his followers to present a particular chariot.

It was pulled by four horses made out of bronze. They were animated and seemed to be alive. The carriage was pitted from blades and arrows - clearly the result of having participated in numerous battles.

On the right side was the carving of a dragon, and to the left was a phoenix. The front had a qilin and the back was a white tiger. The original color had faded with time.

“I wish to exchange this bronze chariot.” Suppression Conqueror presented the treasure.

“This belongs to Imperial Attendant!” Resplendent Monarch’s expression soured.

“And now it is mine.” Suppression Conqueror asserted.

Resplendent scowled and didn’t wish to continue this argument in public or it would harm Imperial Attendant’s reputation.

“This chariot…” A few participants recognized its history.

“Tetra-war.” Omniscient Dao Lord’s expression changed for a moment.

“You cannot sit on it.” Jue Xian’er did not hold back.

Suppression looked visibly annoyed but didn’t engage Jue Xian’er.

“The legendary chariot.” Ye Fantian talked to her peers.

Although they were juniors, they have heard stories about it from their emperors. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Sentinel Treant scowled after seeing this, clearly unhappy to see it being used as a bid.

“Is this a famous artifact?” One crowd member didn’t recognize the chariot.

A big shot responded: “As far as I know, it was used by City Lord Zi Yan during Grand Dao War. It ended up saving many wounded emperors and monarchs.”

“This is out of line.” Immortal Emperor Yao Zu shook his head disapprovingly.

The negative reception left Suppression in a tough spot. Nonetheless, he still thought that this was the right choice.

“How is it?” He asked Boss Tang.

“It’s a wonderful carriage and I am indeed missing a ride.” Boss Tang took a good look at the chariot before responding.

This gave Suppression Conqueror hope. After all, it was one of a kind and was blessed by a supreme being before.

Unfortunately, he didn’t know how to control the carriage. The main issue was his not being part of the main branch from Imperial Attendant.

“Although I desire this carriage, I do not dare to take it. Otherwise, I might lose my head one day. In my opinion, you should return to where it should be. Certain things aren’t meant to be used for transactions.” Boss Tang said before rubbing his neck implicatively.

Suppression’s expression soured since he thought that he would be able to obtain Heaven Reckon with it. Alas, Boss Tang didn’t want it.

“Why is Boss Tang refusing the chariot? What is he afraid of?” A crowd member whispered, finding this whole matter rather strange.

They saw how arrogant he was, not to mention his clear interest in the chariot. He didn’t mind offending the alliances or any other cultivator. What was the reason behind this refusal?

“I heard that it represents Imperial Attendant City’s prestige, it is a spiritual totem of sorts for them.” A big shot said: “According to the legends, even emperors come out to greet the master of this chariot, so this is rather blasphemous.”

“It’s more than just that, Imperial Attendant is related to Cleansing Incense Dynasty. If this falls out of their possession, Imperial Alliance will pursue this, maybe even Imperial Field.” Someone else with more information said.

“I have a lamp.” Immensity Conqueror was next, presenting a treasure with a feeble flame on the verge of extinguishing.

However, it seemed capable of guiding anyone out of the darkness, always warming the heart during times of desperation and despair. This was a defensive treasure against the dark affinity.

“I found it in Nightmare Realm.” He revealed its origin with a single sentence.

Despite the lack of details, both participants and spectators thought that the lamp was a great artifact to keep around.

“Heartguide.” Boss Tang said: “In some aspects, it is more valuable than Heaven Reckon.”

“Yes, you sure know your stuff.” Immensity nodded: “It is special but only Heaven Reckon can measure certain matters and fortunes.”

“What does the conqueror want?” A listener whispered.

Immensity maintained a neutral stance, not joining The People or The Race. No one knew his pursuit.

“Mmm, this is tempting.” Boss Tang stroked his chin.

Xiao Qingtian became anxious because his faction came for Heaven Reckon.

“Amitabha.” The sacred monk of Pure Land placed his palms together first before taking out a bowl in a reluctant manner: “I have nothing, no treasure to speak of, only this bowl.”

Everyone saw a clear liquid inside the bowl. Ripples appeared occasionally due to the wind; within them were images of three thousand worlds.

“The hope of all living beings.” Boss Tang narrowed his eyes after seeing the bowl.

“A testament to your contribution, Sacred Monk.” Omniscient Dao Lord said sentimentally: “You have granted salvation and peace to countless mortals, the proof is in this bowl. It is a matchless feat.”

“What is he talking about?” A crowd member asked, unaware of the implications. Only top cultivators such as the older auction participants were privy to this information.

“I’ll take it.” Boss Tang made up his mind and tossed Heaven Reckon over.

“Amitabha, thank you for fulfilling my wish.” The sacred monk caught the ruler and placed his palms together to say goodbye to everyone.

With that, he made his departure.
