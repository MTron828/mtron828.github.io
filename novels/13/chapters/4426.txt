Chapter 4427: Peacock Monarch’s Power

Peacock Monarch had a pulsing glint in his eyes, looking like two divine swords slashing. He activated his sword energy and released an ocean of swords.

Those who felt this mighty energy became startled. There was no doubt that he was the strongest combatant so far since his aura made them feel the fear of decapitation.

“Show mercy.” He took one step forward and said: “The ex-sect master is our esteemed guest. Drop the issue here.”

He must interfere since this ex-sect master was an important member of the convoy. It would reflect terribly on him as Dragon’s sect master to let a guest die in his sect.

“What does that have to do with me?” Li Qiye nonchalantly said, prompting the crowd to smile wryly.

They no longer chastised him for his arrogance since they have grown tired of doing so. Moreover, his two slashes have shut down all haters.

“Li, Dragon isn’t the place for you to do as you please!” The glint in Peacock Monarch’s eyes intensified and caused the temperature to drop. Many couldn’t help but shudder as a result since he was far stronger than the ex-sect master of Five-sun.

“Indeed, Dragon is too small, my playgrounds are all nine heavens and ten earths.” Li Qiye chuckled and responded.

“You!” Peacock Monarch’s bloodlust only grew with time.

The audience exchanged glances and thought that Li Qiye’s contempt towards Dragon hasn’t waned in the slightest.

“Since you’re courting death, don’t blame us for bullying you via number and abandoning seniority.” He was ready to take down Li Qiye.

He had already sworn to avenge his son eventually. Now, Li Qiye was ruining his sect’s matter too - that’s two reasons for him to kill Li Qiye.

“Here is your opportunity to avenge your son.” Li Qiye smiled and didn’t mind another enemy.

This reminder of his dead son only added salt to the wound. The livid monarch said: “Let’s see what you can do then. If your ability is insufficient, I will offer your head to my son as a tribute.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Just start.” Li Qiye responded.

It seemed that the conversation forced the monarch to fight Li Qiye no matter what.

“How will the monarch fight?” Experts began discussing the battle.

“Peacock Monarch was a brilliant genius during his youth.” A big shot said: “His mid-life isn’t as brilliant but he is still exceptional among his peers.”

Everyone understood that Peacock Monarch was the real deal, unlike the ex-sect master of Five-sun who was famous because of his son.

Peacock Monarch stepped forward and released his vitality. It took the form of a tornado and ravaged the area around him.

The gales emanating from it seemingly toppled the buildings in the city and made them shake violently. The sky turned dark as a result.

“So strong!” Most couldn’t believe the sheer force of his vitality. Weaker cultivators either became paralyzed or were blown flying.

He was holding back no longer and showed the crowd his true power.

“Boom!” Fate palaces emerged and circled in the air. Resplendent dao halos came next along with billowing chaos energy.

“Myriad-dao Sovereign!” Audience members shouted.

“36, 72, 108, 363…” Someone hurriedly counted the individual dao.

“He certainly didn’t waste his talent.” One expert saw a world being created by the rotation of the halos.

When compared with the ex-sect master of Five-sun, there was an entire realm - Golden Sovereign - separating them. This was the difference between the sun and a firefly.

Though Peacock Monarch didn’t have 10,000 dao just yet, he shouldn’t be mentioned in the same breath as the ex-sect master.

The crowd became emotional and thought that he has truly earned his fame. They never got the chance to witness him in action because ever since he became successful, he stopped fighting as much.

“That’s why he has the ambition to replace Lion’s Roar.” Someone whispered.

Though he wasn’t an apex existence, he could still live for several tens of thousand more years without needing to hibernate. This would allow him to surpass many ancestors.
