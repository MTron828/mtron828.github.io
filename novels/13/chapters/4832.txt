Chapter 4833: Tribulation Slash

High Heaven’s Maelstrom was the name of Dead Immortal’s epoch paragon weapon. Alas, it had a hole other than the center and was incomplete just like the ones before.

Nonetheless, the tribulation lightning bolts within still frightened even overlords. It felt as if the high heaven was looking down on them.

“Just lacking a tiny bit more.” A hidden overlord commented.

Temporal Dagger, Epoch Cube, and High Heaven’s Maelstrom were immensely difficult to craft. One of the key requirements was being the current epoch lord. At grand completion, its power could mean the difference between victory and defeat among overlords.

They were in an inactive state yet energy strands coming from them still made everyone tremble. Eight Desolaces felt so feeble in their presence. Any of them could remove it from existence without any problem.

One overlord took a deep breath and wondered if he could stop them. Despite being incomplete, there were still three of them on the same side.

Their masters rarely used them before in previous epochs. They wanted to use the vestige of their own epoch over a long period to repair the deficiencies. Alas, Li Qiye left them no choice.

“Sword, come.” Li Qiye arranged his nine sword dao. Unmatched sword intents engulfed the myriad realms.

They manifested into a domain made out of countless swords, trapping all four combatants inside. This sword domain was the ultimate seal, separating the yin and yang along with the reincarnation cycle.

“Die!” Undying Lord made the first move and threw the Temporal Dagger forward. Instead of traveling from point A to point B, it traveled through time instead, aiming at the Li Qiye from yesterday and the day before that…

This should be impossible but the dagger made it possible. As the dagger traveled further and further back in time, more and more living beings started disappearing as if they had never existed in the first place.

None could resist regardless of their power. Thus, Li Qiye had to retaliate with a temporal slash as well using Tribulation.

His own slash traveled with peerless speed backward in the river of time. Therefore, whenever the dagger reached a particular timeline, the slash was already there in waiting.

Due to its speed, it became unbearably sharp and forced the dagger out of the river of time. With that, living beings who have been erased returned back to the timeline.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Crack!” Moreover, it had tiny cracks after being struck by Tribulation. Undying Lord groaned after seeing his beloved treasure damaged.

Tribulation didn’t stop there and flew out of the river of time, aiming for Undying Lord. Only the overlords could keep up with its trajectory.

It appeared right in front of his throat and startled him. However, the abyssal lord saved him by using the Epoch Cube.

It became radiant and illuminated Eight Desolaces with star rays. Time started slowing down and everyone could see the individual strings of time.

“Bam!” The abyssal lord managed to travel fast enough to block Tribulation with his cube.

Alas, he staggered ten steps backward and vomited blood.

“Crack!” Cracks also appeared on his treasure.

Both of them felt fear and pain. Their unbeatable artifacts were nearly broken just now.

Their power was unquestionable but keep in mind that they were facing one of the nine Heavenly Treasures that has been imbued with the proper scripture.

A hush fell over the world; not even the overlords dared to breathe loudly. The disparity in power was rather apparent.

“We can’t fight solo.” The calm Dead Immortal said.

They exchanged glances and assumed a triangular formation with Li Qiye in the center.

Cultivators in Eight Desolaces watched attentively since they knew that this was an existential crisis. The hidden overlords gazed without blinking once.

“Make your move.” Li Qiye posed with both hands behind his back; the nine swords hovered behind him.

“Go!” The three immediately attacked together within 1/1000th of a second and had impeccable teamwork.

“Boom!” High Heaven’s Maelstrom sent out a godly palm coursing with lightning bolts, wanting to drown him.

“The high heaven…” This seemed to be the palm of the entity feared the most by the overlords.
