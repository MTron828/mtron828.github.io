Chapter 4602: Looming Crisis

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Jian Ming said: “Are you saying that you’re not interested in Miss Ye, that she isn’t worthy of being your companion?”

He then gazed implicatively at the scion and continued: “At, I guess I understand, you are the future lord of Paramount and think there is a disparity between the social status of the involved parties.”

He couldn’t fight back when Li Qiye’s group teased him. It was a different story now and the scion turned red as a result.

“That’s not what I meant at all.” The latter waved his hands repeatedly and denied it.

He hurriedly explained himself: “Miss Ye, you are a beautiful noble but this marriage was decided by the seniors, not myself. It is not my wish but that doesn’t mean that I think lowly of you.”

“I understand and do not mind the comment, Scion.” Ye Tingrong responded.

First, it was true that there was a disparity in status. Golden Gate wasn’t comparable to Paramount Gate. Her sect has only been created recently, relatively. It lacked foundation and resources while solely relying on the founder. On the other hand, Paramount Gate had a deep history with numerous top masters.

She was also introspective and knew that she wasn’t the reason for the marriage requests. This was only because of her ancestor.

The scion heaved a sigh of relief after seeing her being so understanding. However, Jian Ming didn’t let up and smirked at the scion: “Miss Ye is both beautiful and gentle, have you never thought of actually marrying her? Maybe a little anticipation and excitement?”

“It wasn’t my wish.” The honest scion shook his head.

“So you’re saying you just don’t want to marry her?” Jian Ming rubbed his chin while smirking at him.

“No.” The scion hurriedly explained: “The grand dao is long and I’ve only entered the door. I have not prepared sufficiently to have a companion and do not dare to let someone else down. Therefore, I wish to walk alone right now.”

“Not a bad idea.” Li Qiye interjected: “One less shackle will allow you to go farther.”

“I understand.” The scion cupped his fist toward Li Qiye.

“What if you are chosen? What will you do?” Jian Ming asked a hard question.

“Well…” The scion hasn’t thought about it and stole glances at Ye Tingrong.

She became interested in the answer and smiled at him: “Right, if our two sects agree, what will you do, Scion?”

“I…” The scion scratched his head and smiled awkwardly. Nonetheless, he told the truth: “I haven’t thought of this before because I’m only here as another number. Though our sect is here to propose a marriage alliance, it’s mainly because of Three Thousand Dao. We are the wingmen in this case.”

He actually revealed his sect’s goal and Three Thousand Dao’s plan to her. He shook his head and continued: “Logically, the only two real competitors are Three Thousand Dao and True Immortal. The only other candidates are Lion’s Roar or Divine Dragon Valley but I’m not sure whether they want to join.”

Tingrong let out a sigh, once again lamenting her lack of autonomy. After all, her sect might not be able to withstand the pressure from the two behemoths.

Eventually, they must make a choice, whether it be True Immortal or Three Thousand Dao. Both the groom and bride were nothing more than political tools. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I’ve heard that Lion’s Roar Royal Lord still doesn’t have an engagement.” Jian Ming pondered.

The scion smiled and said: “It’s embarrassing, Miss Ye, but the truth is that I’m just another pawn here. I apologize if I have offended you somehow.”

“I can sympathize.” She responded.

“You might not be interested but I’m sure your sect is interested in the emperor’s recently-obtained item.” Jian Ming only wanted to cause trouble at this point, piercing through the thin veil of pretense.

The scion couldn’t answer and Tingrong’s expression became serious.

Finally, the scion broke the silence and said: “The truth is I don’t know anything, not even the item obtained by the emperor. I didn’t see him when I visited Golden Gate either.”

Having said that, he stared at Tingrong.

She chuckled and shook her head: “I’m afraid that I will disappoint everyone because I don’t know either. I haven’t seen the ancestor.”

“You haven’t seen the ancestor yet?” Jian Ming was surprised to hear this: “Didn’t he come out of Worldbreaker already?”

Everyone saw him escaping from the dynasty that day. He should have returned to the sect already but this didn’t seem to be the case.

She remained straightforward with the group: “He has yet to return, that’s why I have no idea what he obtained from Worldbreaker.”

The others exchanged glances. Jian Ming and the daoist knew that what he got was a peerless gemstone, something far more precious than any dao lord weapon. Where did he go then?

“He’s on the run, not wanting to bring the peerless item back and dragging his sect down.” Xiao Xuan didn’t hold back.

“That’s plausible.” The daoist nodded in agreement: “All the other experts and sects desire this item and will come to Golden Gate for it.”

“That’s why he ran away in order to protect the sect.” Jian Ming agreed.

“I see.” The scion felt the same way.

“Wealth will arouse the greed of others.” Tingrong sighed after hearing this. Although Golden Gate was strong due to their emperor, he alone couldn’t fight against the entire world. He had no choice but to run given the circumstances.

“It’s useless.” Li Qiye shook his head: “A monk can run but the temple can’t, unless he doesn’t give a damn about his descendants’ lives.”
