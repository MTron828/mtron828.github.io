Chapter 4953: Giving Back

The students watched warily as Bloodsea approached. They would run instantly if his hands got anywhere close to the hilt. After all, who would want to be brave against a three-fruit dragon lord?

Ignoring their fear, Bloodsea strode to the front of a pit. He summoned a divine sword with rampant energy crackling with a thirst for blood.

The scabbard could barely contain the sword's deadly power, a clear warning to the students that this weapon was capable of slaying even the mightiest gods.

The geniuses from Deity were astounded after seeing it.

“Heaven Burial Sword!” Halo was the first to shout.

“!!!” Others had a good idea of its origin after hearing its name.

“A sword left behind by Heaven Burial Conqueror?” Another said.

“That’s right.” A student from Deity answered: “This was left for Heaven Burial Lineage by the conqueror. It was then given to Deity as a token of friendship. However, it disappeared after Deity was destroyed by Luminous Conqueror.”

Halo, Swordgrasp, and Radiant Young Monarch gazed intensely at the sword, actually thinking about seizing it by force.

Heaven Burial Conqueror was exceptional, holding a prestigious position even in Celestial Court. One could easily imagine his power from this alone.

This sword was meant to protect his lineage and descendant but eventually went missing from the chaos.

Later on, Heaven and Divine Alliance combined their effort to rebuild Deity. The latter’s descendants and Heaven Burial Lineage tried to search for the sword to no avail.

Today, it finally showed up again in Bloodsea’s possession. Unlike Benevolence, Deity actually had a claim for Heaven Burial. This was the reason why its top geniuses got agitated, wanting nothing more than to get it back.

Alas, wanting was one thing, carrying it out was a different story. They didn’t want their heads to roll on the ground.

“Buzz.” He pinned the sword into the pit, causing the mountain to release pulsing runes. The pit closed around the sword and it became one with the mountain. Only the fateful ones could take it away in the future.

There was nothing the geniuses could do after the completion of this ritual. Heaven Burial Sword no longer belonged to them from now on.

“It’s a gift for the academy.” A student said while watching Bloodsea leave without saying anything.

Some became sentimental because Bloodsea was a ruthless killer. However, he still decided to pay the academy back instead of keeping the divine sword for himself.

Students thought that if this villain could do it, then why couldn’t they? They enjoyed immense privileges during their stay and were asked for nothing in return.

“The harbinger of bad luck is here.” A sharp-eyed student noticed another group walking up the mountain.

It was none other than Li Qiye, Jian Yunyun, Princess Ming Shi, and Goldcrest Young Noble.

The princess has been waiting for Li Qiye and the moment she saw him, she grabbed his arm and pulled him up to participate in the ceremony.

Halo and the others scowled after seeing Li Qiye, still remembering how he humiliated them during the deer pawnshop event.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Right here then.” Ming Shi found a great spot and excitedly said. She then summoned the lantern known as Immortal’s Demise.

This stimulated the crowd and caused them to clamor. This was the greatest fortune in this generation of the deer pawnshop. The old man himself said that he couldn’t fetch it - a testament to its value.

“Are you gifting the lantern to the academy?” One student shouted at her.

Some turned their sight toward the dao controller, thinking that the princess might become a second Jun Landu.

Though supreme geniuses such as herself or the ones from Deity didn’t lack treasures, they would keep something of this level around. Repaying the academy could wait after their success.

“Princess, you should wait until you make a name for yourself in the future, pay the academy back then.” One student reminded her with kind intentions.

Jun Landu gave his treasure away and now, the only thing he was known for was this story, nothing more. He lost his life’s greatest fortune.

“It’s alright.” The princess didn’t listen to warnings.

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t try to persuade her either.

“Your generosity has no bounds.” Goldcrest couldn’t help but praise.

Yunyun felt the same way since she would be keeping the lantern.

“Boom!” A strong reaction came from the mountain the moment she placed the lantern into a pit. Runes surged out and became laws.

All the other treasures resonated in unison, whether it be Skyquake Dao Controller, Immortal Beasts, or Heaven Suppression Shawl…

“This lantern is more valuable than our imagination, I think it might be top three…” One student gasped and said.

All the other gifts prior didn’t cause the same reaction, not even the sword named Heaven Burial. This meant that the lantern was comparable to the current top dogs of the mountain.

“The academy gains two supreme treasures today.” Students realized the significance of this event.
