Chapter 4549: Voidburn Godchild

“Oh crap, my mistake. I’ve overestimated your sect master. He isn’t qualified to kneel before our young noble since that would be the highest honor possible, a great fortune requiring our young noble’s permission. Sigh, my damn mouth.” Having said that, he actually slapped himself twice.

This ridiculous one-man show was unbearably insulting. Not to mention True Immortal, no other cultivator would be able to tolerate this. They might actually have attacked already.

His words were akin to him spitting on the sect master’s face, saying that he wasn’t even qualified to kneel before Li Qiye.

Little did everyone know that he was merely telling the truth. They certainly only heard a prestigious cultivator being utterly disrespected. This was a crime worthy of extermination.

The moment he finished, Six-winged Emissary’s eyes were seething with anger and murderous intent.

“This disrespect warrants death!” A listener shouted and stood up for True Immortal.

“Yes, no one can insult the sect master.” Another expert wanted to please True Immortal.

“A clan extermination isn’t out of line here.”A few started shouting.

This was their chance to please True Immortal Sect Master. It would rather be beneficial and nothing of value would be lost - just one unknown junior with a foul mouth.

Therefore, they acted furious and indignant, wanting Jian Ming to pay.

Jian Ming stared at them with disdain and said: “idiots, you all got whipped and kicked out like slaves earlier and now, you’re shouting on your master’s behalf? No, you’re not even slaves since they wouldn’t want such incapable slaves, haha.”

The shouters became embarrassed. This embarrassment then turned into anger.

They didn’t dare oppose Six-winged Emissary earlier and only mumbled grievances. Now, they wanted to please True Immortal Sect Master.

Worst of all, this Jian Ming actually uncovered their shame.

“Well said.” Li Qiye laughed and added: “Idiots indeed.”

“Brazen fools, how dare you spit insults at the heroes of the world?!” A youth stepped forward and uttered coldly: “Death is what you deserve.”

Fiery circles danced and pulsed around him. Just his appearance alone made everyone aware of his extraordinary background. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Oh, Voidburn Godchild, I’ve been a fan for a long time.” Jian Ming cupped his fist and smiled, pretending to be a fan.

“That’s Voidburn Godchild?” A listener noticed that the guy was quite strong and whispered: “Hmm, impressive enough, worthy of being Voidburn Saintess’ older brother.”

“Although both are sovereigns, the saintess is far stronger.” An older cultivator commented.

“Her talent is indeed something else. That’s why she’s chosen by Divine Dragon Valley to be Tian Feng’s fiancee.” An elder agreed.

“Ah, so he’s Tian Feng’s older brother-in-law.” Another said.

Tian Feng was a notorious cultivator. He was one of the five conquerors with an uncontrollable love for fighting.

“It’s too late to flatter me now, I might spare your life but punishments are necessary.” Voidburn Godchild enjoyed being recognized.

“Thank god I’ll be able to stay alive.” Jian Ming smiled and said: “There is one thing though, you are the godchild of Voidburn and the brother-in-law of Tian Feng, don’t you feel ashamed licking True Immortal’s boots? Isn’t this a blow to your sect’s reputation? If Tian Feng catches wind of this, he might crush your head.”

“You!” Voidburn Godchild’s expression became unsightly.

“I think he’s right.” Crowd members started discussing this issue.

Voidburn Temple and Divine Dragon Valley had more than just a marriage alliance. The progenitor of the temple used to be Eight-step Dragon Dao Lord’s first disciple. In other words, Voidburn Temple could be considered a branch of Divine Dragon Valley.

The valley was one of the strongest lineages currently, not that far off from True Immortal. Therefore, given his status and identity, Voidburn Godchild’s conduct was improper for many reasons.

The cold expression of Tian Feng popped up in his head and made him shudder. His brother-in-law was crazy and might actually kill him.

“How dare you try to create a rift between us? I’ll smash your mouth!” He became murderous.

“Godchild, no need to be angry.” A gentle voice interrupted him.

Everyone looked over and saw a gentlemanly youth in a white robe. He was handsome and had a seal in the form of a flower on his forehead. It made him seem knowledgeable and noble.

“Jadedragon.” Voidturn scowled after seeing him.

“Jadedragon Monarch is here too.” Many recognized the youth.

“Greetings.” The youth cupped his fist and greeted the crowd.

“Just like the rumors, he’s extraordinary.” A young cultivator praised.

“He and Tian Feng are both demons. He is a jade pig while Tian Feng has an even more prestigious bloodline, a lunatic clam. Heaven Devourer Mad God was one too.”

“I see, no wonder why Tian Feng loves fighting.” Another became emotional.

The current Tian Feng wasn’t frightening enough. However, one could think about his future potential since he was of the same race as the mad god.
