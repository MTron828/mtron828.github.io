Chapter 4824: Immortal Emperor Tian Tu

“Boom!” The devastating reach was easily blocked by Li Qiye who didn’t even open his eyes.

Though it resembled a palm block, the overlords could see the profundity within and became startled.

Prior to this, some assumed that Li Qiye wouldn’t be able to move. Now, it seemed that he could still defend himself. This made the overlords more cautious than before.

Undying Lord’s expression soured. As an actual combatant, he gained insight into Li Qiye’s current condition. This naturally left him in an undesirable situation.

“Brother Da!” The palms remained locked while Undying Lord shouted at the creature again.

Unfortunately, there was still no reaction from those white eyes.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Undying Lord thought that Lord Da would be a capable ally. Alas, this plan was rather ineffective.

“Rebirth.” He chanted softly.

“Rumble!” His death aura intensified and gained ground again.

“Boom!” A seal of death appeared above and suddenly drilled into the ground. A pure and boundless death energy gushed out like the spring, bringing with it an amazing life force.

The essences of this affinity erupted with loud explosions. Suddenly, an all-but-gone presence returned to the world.

Auras of emperors of the Ancient Ming Dynasty resurfaced. These emperors climbed out of the ground, led by a peerless leader - Immortal Emperor Tian Tu.

Their imperial auras twisted together and became unstoppable storms.

“What the hell?!” Cultivators who were still conscious at this point were at a loss.

“Another test.” An overlord commented.

Undying Lord used his death seal to summon the souls of these Immortal Emperors. First, they could be useful soldiers but most importantly, this was another way to test Li Qiye. The appearance of his old enemies might enrage him, prompting him to stand up and fight.

However, the intensified death aura also woke up Silly Da. The moment it opened its eyes, it started pecking and crushed one mountain after another.

It moved forward and started eating both kingdoms and citizens. It only took a few seconds before it devoured millions.

“Boom!” Dao lord lineages and ancient imperial clans immediately retaliated with barriers and destructive beams. Patriarchs and monarchs rushed to the sky, swinging with swords and sabers.

Unfortunately, it seemed to be impervious to any attack.

It didn’t take long before the sects nearby became mere food. Monarchs and ancient cultivators were as feeble as worms before the creature’s beak.

Meanwhile, the Ancient Ming emperors gathered power and traveled through the realms to reach Li Qiye.

“Bam!” However, they didn’t even make it to Li Qiye before they saw a beak coming from above, crushing them down to the ground.

The heroic Tian Tu and the other ferocious emperors fought back but they didn’t last long before being crushed and then swallowed by Silly Da.

“Brother Da!” Undying Lord didn’t know what to do and could only blame himself for bringing a terrible ally.

“No one can predict this stupid duck.” Another overlord found this hilarious.

The overlords told themselves to never invite this guy in the future for anything. Maybe it would go stupid like this time and start attacking them. They didn’t want to lose an eye from being pecked.

This time around, the creature reacted to the call. It stopped pecking the ground and stared at Undying Lord without blinking.

“Boom!” Undying Lord chose to give up the exchange and retreated. The full brunt of the energy from the exchange hit him, causing him to vomit a mouthful of blood.

He gasped for breath while staring at Li Qiye. Due to the instability stemming from the distraction, lightning flashed inside Li Qiye. It felt as if he could explode at any moment.

“Grievous injuries but still quite strong.” An overlord in space concluded.

Undying Lord didn’t expect his plan to go sour like this. His eyes shifted back and forth between Li Qiye and Lord Da. It became abundantly clear that his ally was unreliable.

“Very well, let’s try this.” Undying Lord summoned his weapons - a shield in his left hand and a lance in his right.

The sky turned dark right away as he gathered all the energy of death to his weapons.

Whether it be the recently deceased or those who have passed away eras ago, they always exuded death energy. Now, this affinity in all of Eight Desolaces was being summoned. The exposed auras creeped everyone out.

Currently, the life affinity couldn’t compare to the death affinity. After all, the latter had accumulated while the former had a limit from just the living beings.

Instead of reviving the dead, Undying Lord harvested this energy for himself. He recovered from the previous exchange and was eager to deliver judgment.

The shield was the final destination while the lance was the origination of death. The lance killed while the shield collected - an endless cycle.
