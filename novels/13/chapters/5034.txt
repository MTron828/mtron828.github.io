Chapter 5035: Entrance

Ming Shi glanced at Goldcrest before winking at the assassin: “If I pay you, will you cut off his rooster head?”

“Miss, please don’t joke around like that.” Goldcrest became startled.

Shadowrider stared at Goldcrest, causing him to shiver with fear. He felt as if the gaze was piercing his heart.

“Okay, okay, stop please.” Goldcrest was actually afraid. Although he was considered a powerful cultivator, he was not a challenge at all.

“Yes, I will give you eight percent off.” Shadowrider responded.

“Hehehe, did you hear that, Rooster? Eight percent off. Keep this in mind the next time I visit Demon, you better be a better host or I will hire him.” Ming Shi said.

“Yes, yes, of course.” Goldcrest nodded his head repeatedly like a chicken eating grain: “It’s no big deal at all as long as it pleases you, Miss. Just don’t joke like this again.”

Ming Shi raised her head arrogantly and spared Goldcrest this time around.

The latter was afraid of Shadowrider and decided to keep a distance, not wanting to accidentally offend the assassin.

“Coward.” On the other hand, Ming Shi thought that everything was fine as long as she was near Li Qiye.

“We’re leaving.” Li Qiye said before glancing at Jian Yunyun: “Just know to keep your expectation low.”

“What do you mean, Young Noble?” She had a sense of foreboding after hearing this.

“If I am not mistaken, we might find the missing cultivators including your ancestor. Unfortunately, if we’re lucky, their corpses will be around.”

Yunyun’s heart trembled after hearing this despite having thought of this possibility before. It was still difficult to listen to the truth.

“I understand.” She took a deep breath.

The atmosphere became solemn. Ming Shi and Goldcrest didn’t know how to console Yunyun because they knew very little about the empress dowager and the situation.

With Shadowrider leading the way, they crossed through the perilous terrains of Demon and arrived at a valley.

It was surrounded by towering trees. One wouldn’t be able to see it while flying over.

There was nothing here except for a rough and weedy rocky cliff, not looking out of place at all.

“It’s here.” Li Qiye gazed at the cliff and felt the rhythm of the grand dao.

He was the only one capable of doing this among the group. Shadowrider didn’t feel anything at all but he already knew this location.

“There was once a great fortune here.” Li Qiye was slightly surprised.

“A great fortune? What kind?” Ming Shi asked.

To which he responded: “Enough to become untouchable for a lifetime.”

“Really?” Her eyes turned bright as a result: “Hehehe, then let’s take a look, maybe there’s something else here too.”

“Forget about it, everything worth taking has been taken.” Li Qiye shook his head and focused on the cliff again.

“This was where I stood in ambush, I only had to take action twice.” Shadowrider said.

“Did you kill Divine Empress Dowager?” Yunyun suddenly asked.

Shadowrider stared at her, causing her to shudder in fear. This was an understandable reaction. Nonetheless, she tried her best and met his gaze.

“I was hired as the guard, not to kill. I had nothing to do with your empress dowager’s death.” Shadowrider didn’t release any killing intent to intimidate her.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“He’s not lying.” Li Qiye nodded.

Ming Shi touched the cliff and then knocked on it once before commenting: “There’s nothing here.”

“I’m sure there is more to this.” Goldcrest took his time and didn’t notice anything either.

“It is a seal.” Shadowrider said.

Ming Shi wasn’t afraid of him and smiled: “You never got curious enough to enter?”

“Curiosity killed the cat.” He coldly uttered, causing her to stick out her tongue due to his scary tone.

“So this hasn’t been open since your last transaction, around ten thousand years or so.” Li Qiye assessed the situation.

“Right, which is why I believed the person is no longer in the lower continents.” Shadowrider said.

“And if that’s not true?” Li Qiye said.

Shadowrider furrowed his brows after hearing this. If this mysterious conqueror was still here, why did the hunt stop? There must be a reason behind this but he didn’t notice any clues.

“Who are you talking about?” Ming Shi asked.

Li Qiye and Shadowrider didn’t answer.

The former placed his hand on the cliff and activated his dao power.

“Buzz.” Numerous runes appeared on the surface.

“So it is a seal.” Goldcrest said.

He and the others didn’t notice anything before, let alone activate these runes.

“This is…” Li Qiye was astonished again.

Keep in mind that he was the creator of this epoch. No dao laws and merit laws could elude him; everything was derivable.

However, there were transformations not belonging to this epoch yet could still blend in perfectly. Most importantly, he was familiar with them too.

“So it is true.” He murmured.

With his interference, the runes and dao laws on the cliffs intertwined together and broke away from the usual positions. A circle was formed and rotated continuously until the seal was broken.

“Buzz.” A door made out of light manifested into reality.

“It was like this before.” Shadowrider said.

“We’re going in.” Li Qiye told the group.

“I’ll keep an eye out.” Shadowrider said.

This scared the youths again because he was performing his old job. Were they the targets this time? Even if this wasn’t true, he could also run away.

“Isn’t this bad?” Yunyun whispered to Li Qiye. Goldcrest nodded in agreement as well.

“It’s fine, monks can run but not their temple. He knows what he’s doing.” Li Qiye smiled and glanced at the assassin.
