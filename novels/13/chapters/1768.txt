When one stepped inside the workshop, they would be dazzled by the mountains of materials. Even the treasuries of many great powers couldn’t compare to this.

Shen Xiaoshan’s group was shaken beyond words by the plethora of materials here. Their sect also saved up some dao materials but it was no match for even a tiny corner of this place.

Shi Sou became emotional after seeing this and thought that the imperial lineages were too lucky. If they had access to these resources, they would have soared towards greatness already.

Dao materials were very important in the thirteen continents. All cultivators needed them since they were required for weapons and treasures.

The artifacts in the tenth world were different from those in the nine. The majority of the ones here were crafted by combining dao fetus and precious metals. Meanwhile, the dao fetus were born in dao materials.

These fetuses were created by nature, normally gestating in a mysterious pebble or the remains of a beast. They had both chaos and primordial energies on top of laws of the grand dao.

Real weapons required these dao fetuses. Only then would they be able to use the power of the grand dao and primordial chaos. Otherwise, they would only be cold steel like mortal weapons. These fetuses actually gave the weapons life, in a sense.

The most common cause of birth for these fetuses was when the heaven and earth flowed together. This was when laws of the grand dao would appear. It could be inside an ore or tree; that’s when a fetus would be created. Normally, the origin of the fetus would play a large part in determining the outcome of the weapons.

Because one couldn’t see inside a dao material regardless of their strength and heavenly gaze, no one would know what kind of fetus would be inside.

That’s why opening these materials became a form of entertainment or gambling in the thirteen continents.

The Stone Workshop didn’t only sell materials and fetuses. Their main source of income was gambling. Visitors could bet among themselves or against the workshop.

The group saw cultivators from all over the world picking dao materials. Some were shouting like addicted gamblers, no longer caring about their own images as nobles and masters.

A worker immediately went up to greet the group and enthusiastically said: “Sir, are you here to pick some materials or to gamble?”

Li Qiye smiled in response: “Your store isn’t enough to pay if I were to gamble.”

The worker was understandably surprised by the reply. Keep in mind that their shop had the most brilliant appraisers in Jilin or even all of Pure. No one would dare to brag about beating them.

Nevertheless, the worker still said respectfully: “Then please have a look at the dao materials, let me know when you find something you like.”

The group strolled around the store with the worker guiding them. Of course, Li Qiye was the only one really looking. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

There were too many items here. Some stones were as small as a fist while others were as big as mountains. Moreover, the form varied too; metals were common while a rare one was made up from the spine of a flood-dragon...

Of course, they were separated into different levels with a varying price range. The cheapest was very affordable even for the young cultivators. As for the most expensive, well, even a sect master would be left speechless.

Outside of just materials, there were all types of dao fetuses that have been taken out such as sword fetus, saber fetus, spear fetus...

The group of three was dazed while walking behind Li Qiye. They had never seen so many dao materials before in their life.

After taking a stroll of the store, he stared at the skeleton of a dragon in the central floor and said: “There is indeed a lot of varieties here.”

“Sir, please don’t laugh but I do think that in terms of the number of dao materials, we’re definitely in the top three in Pure, if not first place.” The worker proudly said while pointing at the dragon bones in the middle: “Take that Frost Golden Dragon, for example, it might not be a true dragon but it does have a strand of that bloodline. It’s an old dragon at grand completion; we found it very deep in the northern frigid sea. The heaven and earth harmonization has occurred on its spine to create a priceless dao fetus. Of course, the bones themselves are precious as well. Usually, money isn’t the issue when trying to find one of this level but our shop specializes in collecting dao materials. It doesn’t matter what the guests want, we can satisfy their wishes. This is our store’s unquestionable ability.”

This worker went on and on about his shop. Of course, it wasn’t all bragging since the shop was indeed capable of doing so, just that his diction was slightly exaggerated.

Li Qiye only smiled and continued to stare at the spine of the dragon.

One needed to cut the material out first in order to see if it was good or bad. Even one from a true dragon was not necessarily precious, just that the chance for a good one was greater.

“Let us go look at the White Adornments.” Li Qiye withdrew his gaze and told the worker.

“Please, this way.” The worker instantly showed Li Qiye the way and didn’t look down on Li Qiye just because the guy wanted to see White Adornments.

There were levels to dao fetuses. The higher level would create stronger weapons. Thus, those who could afford it would all pick the higher level ones.

Dao fetuses are distinguished in the following order: White Adornment, Violet Force, Golden Inlaid, Orange Martial, and Heaven Bestowment. [1]

Experienced stone appraisers could look at a material’s composition, form, place of origin, and background to determine the dao fetus inside to a certain degree of accuracy. That’s why each sect would have specialized appraisers to pick out the materials. They enjoyed a relatively high position with their ability.

White Adornment was the lowest level and the most common. It came in all shapes and forms so this was the easiest choice for many cultivators.

It was also the cheapest so cultivators from the weaker sects picked it. Of course, certain masters and big shots would do so too.

They were located in an inconspicuous corner and piled up randomly like a mound.

These dao materials were priced according to their size. The larger, the more expensive. Nevertheless, this didn’t mean that the dao fetus inside would be proportional to its material’s side.

They were listed as White Adornment by the shop’s appraisers who were very experienced and discerning. These appraisers rarely made mistake so the materials here were certainly at the White Adornment level.

Alas, even the heaven falls asleep sometimes. These experienced appraisers could also make mistake. Because of this, materials that were determined as White Adornment could reveal fetuses at the Orange Martial or even Heaven Bestowment level!

This was the reason why some keen cultivators would come to this section to pick the White Adornments. If they were fortunate enough, some treasures could be found here.

When Li Qiye got here, many cultivators were already picking their stuff, with the majority being weaker cultivators since this was all they could afford.

Though the shop was usually full of customers, a mortal accompanied by three cultivators was still a rare sight. A few cultivators’ eyes darted at them.

The worker quietly stood to the side and waited for Li Qiye to make a choice. Normally, workers wouldn’t come to this section to help so Li Qiye’s situation was very special.

He stood before the pile and began his observation.

“Pick a small one; they’re all White Adornments anyway. A smaller one will be cheaper.” A cultivator kindly advised.
