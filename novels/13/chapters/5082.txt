Chapter 5083: A Move That Should Not Exist

“Bring it.” Conceal Conqueror showed no sign of yielding despite knowing that she was outmatched.

On the other hand, she seemed eager to see his next technique. Her love for the dao made others feel nothing but admiration.

This was no longer about Li Qiye’s item or victory, only his dao heart attack. It has been her highest pursuit but most importantly, she had never seen it before until now. This particular level only existed in her imagination and derivation.

Today, Li Qiye had used it twice so far. This confirmed the existence of this technique and she became a moth, unable to help flying into the flames.

“Let’s begin then.” Li Qiye said.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She closed her eyes and quietly chanted an ancient, inscrutable mantra.

“Oh?” Li Qiye’s eyes became serious after hearing this.

Spectators thought that she would use her Wisdom Slash again. They didn’t understand the special mantra.

“Celestial Court.” On the other hand, Truth Conqueror had a complicated expression.

She was unique in that when others became stronger, they would ascend to the upper continents. As for her, she was sent down at a young age.

Most importantly, due to her noble background, she had access to information unbeknown to others. She could tell that this mantra originated from Celestial Court.

Conceal Conqueror’s hair fluttered to the wind as if she was blessed by a mysterious power.

“Buzz.” Strands of light that weren’t her own manifested into reality.

Prior to this, her aura had a chilling murderous affinity. Though her seven fruits were at the limit and she could control her aura, everyone could still sense it.

Now, this empowerment converted her affinity to a transcending one. As she floated upward, she resembled a fairy from the heavens - a stark contrast to her prior appearance.

“Is this still her dao?” The top cultivators speculated. Normally, they wouldn’t question a conqueror but her immortal aura was completely different now.

“This is Celestial Court’s Immortal Slaughter.” Thousand-faced Sovereign spoke with a stoic tone.

However, the crowd had no idea what it was, one exception being an ancient ancestor from Swordgrasp who became alarmed.

Only the ancient ancestors from Deity knew about this legend. According to the tales, Luminous Conqueror was unbeatable and destroyed Deity in the past.

Eventually, Divine and Heaven Alliance from the upper continents created a new Deity in the lower continents. This time around, they left something special enough to kill conquerors with the code name - Immortal Slaughter.

It was understandable that Conceal would have access to this, being the strongest of Deity and all. Moreover, she had been blessed by Celestial Court as well.

“Boom!” A beam descended and illuminated the three continents, capable of tearing any dao apart.

Everyone felt as if this beam could sink their region in the blink of an eye - a move capable of starting an apocalypse.

Instead of hitting Li Qiye, it struck Conceal Conqueror. She channeled this energy and formed an immortal sword.

It was of unimaginable size. With it under her control, the crowd felt that she was a fairy capable of massacring countless cultivators.

They were scared out of their mind and dropped to the ground, quivering with fear.

“This is it! It takes a long time to charge after each use, this is its full power!” Thousand-faced Sovereign turned pale.

“Die!” Conceal Conqueror slashed the immortal sword forward.

The three continents were as tiny as three eggs in comparison, the same for dragon lords and conquerors. It had enough power to split anything into two halves.

“So this is Immortal Slaughter.” This was Li Qiye’s first time hearing this name. Celestial Court didn’t have this even back during its golden age.
