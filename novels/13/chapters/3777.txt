Chapter 3778: Flowergrasp Smile

The monk has broken everyone’s perception of him with the battle today. His image always centered around his gluttony. Though he was strong, he wasn’t considered to be on the same level as the other three geniuses.

Thus, the success thus far surprised all spectators.

Righteous Scion laughed happily and said: “How interesting, a worthy foe. Looks like this trip to the holy ground will be worth it.”

The crowd exchanged glances - the scion clearly thought more of Golden Cicada than Hu Ben.

The fight back at the fortress was magnificent from a visual perspective and Hu Ben did as well as he could - definitely better than most.

However, the scion never treated him like a real opponent from start to finish. This wasn’t the case right now.

“Boundless potential, he might become the best monk in the holy ground, enough to inherit Sacred Mountain’s legacy.”A high elder became emotional.

This comment made the crowd shudder.

“Inherit the great legacy? Im-impossible.” One youth disagreed.

“It’s actually quite likely.” An ancestor stared at Golden Cicada and said seriously: “He might have the most potential among the four geniuses of Vajra. He’s already from a Buddhist Sect and had access to top merit laws. It’s plausible that he might be able to inherit the Supreme’s legacy.”

No one doubted the fact that he might become a sacred sovereign in the future due to all of his innate advantages, whether it be his background or talents. Thus, no one else had a better chance of becoming the successor of Sacred Mountain.

Therefore, some started thinking meticulously about their next course of action. It would be best to befriend him as soon as possible to benefit themselves and their sects.

Meanwhile, Golden Cicada placed his palms together, not feeling complacent from the praise: “You’re too kind, Scion. In terms of power, I am far inferior, merely being protected by the wise sages. Truly embarrassing.”

“That’s no big deal.” The scion was in a great mood and said: “Let’s see how many moves it’ll take for you to force me to go all-out.”

“Clank.” Having said that, he summoned White Tiger.

This wasn’t the first time the crowd saw this lance of his. Its aura rampaged as if a dao lord was here in person.

“Let’s go!” He leaped into the air and thrust his lance straight at his opponent.

“Boom!” Ten suns instantly appeared and accompanied the thrust.

“This move again!” A few spectators shouted since they had seen this tyrannical attack back at the fortress.

“Oh Merciful Buddha!” Golden Cicada chanted and channeled Buddhist laws to quell all unrest. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Buddhist lotuses appeared beneath him and instantly blossomed, changing the landscape in a magnificent manner.

The flower directly beneath his feet was the largest. He looked transcending and immaculate while standing on top of it, resembling the leader of Buddhism.

He spread his palm the same way as a lotus would blossom, releasing boundless Buddhist light. Within the light were scripture runes that could create three thousand worlds. He had all of this within his grasp.

“Another of the six paths, Flowergrasp Smile!” An ancestor took a deep breath after seeing this.

Most were astonished because there was a good possibility of the monk knowing all six paths. This incited envy and jealousy among the crowd. Just knowing one path would be a lifetime of benefits.

On the other hand, Golden Cicada seemed to have the best of luck and had access to all.

“Clank!” After the lotus flowers disappeared, people saw him closing his palm and gripping the lance with the stability of a mountain.

In this split second, he smiled like a merciful Buddha. With that, grand dao power of the Buddhist affinity emerged in everyone’s heart like a budding seed.

“Holy Buddha!” The weaker cultivators were converted by the smile. Many got the urge to give in.

This moment was fleeting. They eventually regained their wits and understood the horrifying event.

At the same time, Golden Cicada attacked once more. His grip on the lance loosened and his hand slid across the lance, aiming straight at the scion’s chest. All of this happened in a smooth and fluid motion.

Buddhism preached mercy and compassion. However, this palm strike was anything but, carrying enough power to crush heaven and hell.

“Grand Palm, a sure-kill move!” The spectating ancestor blurted out.

This title was rather common. Many other moves shared these characters. However, it had a special significance in the holy ground and was usually accompanied by death.

Some said that this merciless attack was improper for a Buddhist to use. Nonetheless, it was acceptable to use for the sake of subduing evil.

Back then, Buddha Dao Lord used it to take down evil and bring light back to the realm.

The scion reacted quickly and brought his lance back in front of his chest.

“Boom!” This didn’t do anything and he was sent to the ground like a falling meteor, creating a second pit with cracks emanating everywhere.

The crowd stared at the pit, astounded. The scion lost the second exchange as well.

“So strong!” One youth said with admiration.

“Grand Palm is insane!” A big shot murdered.

The power of this attack exceeded expectations. Many ancestors thought that they would either die or be left crippled if struck.

“The six paths are truly strong.” This sentiment could be heard everywhere since Golden Cicada had used three paths thus far.

“He has to be the number one among the four geniuses, right?” An emotional spectator murmured.
