Chapter 4260: Old Enemy

The suppressive power engulfed the world to the horror of the crowd.

“Who dares disturb my slumber?” An ancient being spoke an unfamiliar language not belonging to the current epoch.

However, listeners still somehow understood the words when they echoed in their mind.

In the next second, they felt the existence of a supreme looming in the darkness. This existence could see through everyone’s heart and see their evil nature. They had the urge to submit and follow this being right away.

“I apologize for the disturbance, Great Emperor.” Vastsea Venerable bowed, as did the vajra.

Spectators were astounded to see this. It looked like the two overlords had a relationship with this dark existence.

“This is really an ancient emperor?” The big shots in the crowd were shaken. It seemed that the rumors about this city were true.

“How can this be?” One of them gasped because emperors didn’t belong to their epoch.

Similar to dao lords, they couldn’t linger in Eight Desolaces forever. However, one stood before them right now and this emperor seemed to be of the dark affinity.

Why did this being want to stay in Eight Desolaces? There must be some larger plans or schemes.

“For what reason?” The ancient characters erupted like thunder.

Immobilized cultivators found themselves helpless like fish ready to be cut.

“Great Emperor, please kill someone for us.” The venerable respectfully said.

Others finally understood - so the emperor turned out to be the venerable’s ace card. They wondered if Li Qiye could win once more. They sensed just how much stronger the emperor was compared to the two overlords.

“My involvement has a price.” The being’s pressure intensified.

The duo exchanged glances and gritted their teeth. The venerable made up his mind and replied: “We are aware, please help us, Great Emperor.”

This made listeners curious. What did the emperor want? Treasures and merit laws shouldn’t be enough.

“Who is it?” The being asked.

“Him!” The duo pointed at Li Qiye in unison.

Many worried for Li Qiye right away since this was a mighty existence from the legends. Even Nine-wheel Dao Lord couldn’t purify this dark emperor. Li Qiye’s chance of victory seemed slim to none.

Alas, they saw that he remained relaxed as if he wasn’t about to face a monstrous existence. The pressure didn’t affect him either.

“Let me see.” The being accepted the duo’s request.

Everyone felt two eyes opening in the darkness. Li Qiye’s position suddenly became brighter but he was not afraid of the eyes, unlike the rest of the spectators. The latter didn’t want to be devoured by the darkness.

On the other hand, he smiled and said: “So much time has passed, I wonder if you have improved.”

The crowd gasped after hearing this. No one expected Li Qiye to answer in such a tone towards a great emperor.

“You… It’s really you!” The being hesitated for a moment before blurting.

This wasn’t the expected development. Everyone thought that the emperor would attack right away with a shocking technique. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The two overlords on the ground thought so as well. They didn’t mind the price as long as they could avenge their fallen disciples.

However, they had a terrible feeling after seeing the emperor’s reaction despite not knowing what was going on exactly. It was too late to change their mind anyway.

“Must have not been easy surviving underground all this time.” Li Qiye spoke.

The existence hiding in the shadows became startled, not expecting to see an old enemy after an epoch has passed.
