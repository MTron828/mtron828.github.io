Li Qiye walked back and forth in his search to no avail at the pile of White Adornments.

“Oh, isn’t that the famous mortal?” A mocking voice resounded.

Heavenly Phoenix Crown Prince and his beauty came by; they sneered after seeing Li Qiye finding items in this section before everyone: “Not enough money? Have to resort to White Adornment materials? If you really don’t have money, just tell me. I’m a charitable person and will give some to a daydreaming mortal like you.”

As an imperious character from an imperial lineage, he normally wouldn’t care for a mortal but he still had grudges from back at the Ji Store. A prince like him was robbed of a treasure by a mortal? How could he endure this anger?

Moreover, the guy also humiliated him in front of everyone. He swore to never let this go but still maintained a sliver of rationality because this was the Jilin’s territory.

“Heavenly Phoenix Crown Prince!” The shoppers quickly made way while staring in awe at him.

Cultivators and even experts coming from tiny sects respected him a lot. His background was already prestigious enough but his brother-in-law was even more frightening, a member of the War-Monarch Clan.

This clan had five emperors! Moreover, Jin Ge himself almost became a Grand Monarch.

That’s why even the other imperial successors had to give the prince some face. The alliance between his country and the War-Monarch Clan was a dreadful matter to others.

The cultivators here found it very strange; what was the feud behind this mortal and the prince? Some felt that this mortal was fearless like a tiger, daring to antagonize the prince.

Li Qiye gave the prince the cold-shoulder and continued looking before finally finding one that he liked.

“This one.” Li Qiye weighed the White Adornment in his hand before smiling.

It was as long and thick as an adult’s arm and looked like a branch taken off a withered tree.

The worker smiled and said: “You are quite discerning, sir. This material was given a white grade by our appraisers but its origin is quite rare, coming from a Yulan Magnolia Stone Tree. After the tree died, it was buried deep under the earth before the harmonization of the heaven and earth to create the dao fetus. Maybe you’ll find something nice here, there’s a chance that it might have a Violet Force fetus.”

This worker was very enthusiastic towards Li Qiye and knew all the merchandises in the store like the back of his hand.

“I hope so.” Li Qiye chuckled. Finding treasures in this place was only a whimsical choice. If he really wanted a supreme treasure, he had many other methods.

“Hah, stop daydreaming. The appraisers here are all elites; a white grade will only be a white grade! There’s no way a mortal like you can find any treasure!” The prince laughed.

He would sooner or later kill this mortal but he also wanted to humiliate the guy beforehand so that others would learn the consequence of provoking him.

Li Qiye ignored the guy while the worker didn’t want to antagonize him. He said: “Sir, do you want to take it with you or cut it here?”

“Cut it here.” Li Qiye smiled freely.

Being treated like air by Li Qiye further infuriated the prince. His face became hot and his expression cold. He swore to personally make mincemeat out of this mortal after they leave Western Market.

The worker led Li Qiye to the cutting stage, or a casino in the eyes of many cultivators. No place was more moving in the eyes of adventurous gamblers. The slow cutting process was very entertaining and exciting.

Because of this, many would choose to cut their materials here or make bets with other cultivators and even the shop. The amount would naturally depend on their own abilities.

Prior to using the machine, one would need to pay for the dao material first. That’s why the worker asked: “Sir, would you like to pay now or later?”

The latter was reserved for esteemed guests. The Stone Workshop has received news from the Ji Store. That’s why they treated Li Qiye so well.

“I don’t have any chaos stone on me.” Li Qiye said.

The crowd was astonished to hear this. A mortal daring to come to the workshop to buy materials without any money? What a strange fella.

“Young Master, I, I have some chaos stones here.” Shen Xiaoshan took out a spatial pouch and handed it to Li Qiye in order to save some face for him.

She still had some savings and she didn’t hesitate on using all of them for him at all.

The crowd found it puzzling again. Both her beauty and constitution weren’t bad. Why was she a servant to this mortal? No one could come up with a reasonable answer.

“Maybe he’s a bastard child of a big shot?” This speculation came up a lot in their mind.

“How much?” Li Qiye opened the pouch. There was a decent amount inside, especially for someone like Shen Xiaoshan. She has been saving it for several years in order to buy a decent dao weapon.

“Sir, we priced this dao material at 15 Dao Emissary.” The worker replied right away.

He Chen was startled and blurted out: “Even a White Adornment is that expensive?”

Normally, a white-grade material would only sell for ten to several hundred Daoist Chaos Stones.

But now, the price for this particular one was a hundred times higher than places outside.

“Hah, you shouldn’t have come here then. Wretched-looking thieves like you don’t belong here.” The prince sneered.

He Chen lowered his red face after hearing this. He didn’t dare to retort because the prince was above his level.

Li Qiye didn’t care for the prince but if the guy chose to pick on his people, he couldn’t just sit idly by. Even though He Chen wasn’t a follower, he was following him right now. Li Qiye wouldn’t show mercy to anyone who dares to bully his entourage.

“Who the hell do you think you are? Only an idiot.” Li Qiye said lazily without even looking at the prince.

The crowd was stunned to see this since they were aware of the prince’s arrogance. It became worse after his country managed to suck up to the War-Monarch Clan. He became even more haughty and untethered.

Many were unhappy with him but they couldn’t afford to offend him.

But now, a mortal called him an idiot right to his face? It was essentially a ruthless slap. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Little animal, I’ll end you!” The prince’s expression turned ugly as he wanted to rush over and kill Li Qiye.

“Your Highness, please calm down. This isn’t the place for blood.” The workers nearby immediately stopped him from killing inside their business.

The beauty next to him pulled him back as well and said: “Only a mortal, no need for you to be angry, Crown Prince.”

Ruining the laws of the Jilin in their territory because of a mortal wasn’t worth it.

The prince was fierce enough but he didn’t dare to directly oppose the Jilin Clan. After hearing the exhortations, he glared at Li Qiye and aggressively said: “Mortal, if you want to oppose me, we’ll have a bet then! I’ll have your hands today!”

In a short time, the crowd quickly stared at Li Qiye. Killing was forbidden in this place but there was another simple method for settling disputes, gambling. The two sides could bet anything, even their lives!
