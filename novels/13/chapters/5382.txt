Chapter 5383: Bait

“Boom!” Finally, the tribulation ended and the crack disappeared in the sky. Dark clouds dispersed and everything returned to normal.

Of course, the actual aftermath included several hundred dead dragon lords and conquerors. Their ashes have scattered to the wind.

Ye Fantian successfully survived the tribulation while being grievously wounded. Nonetheless, she earned everyone’s respect as she stood proudly.

Among the audience were venerable conquerors and dao lords. It has been a while since they last saw a heavenly tribulation of this scale, let alone someone managing to survive it.

In fact, her achievements today surpassed those of apex conquerors. Although she only had twelve fruits and was not guaranteed to obtain an immortal shell and anima, the future looked exceedingly bright for her.

Everyone had complicated emotions while staring at this wondrous cultivator. Dao Alliance and Azure School tried to ambush her only to be obliterated. The only potential survivor was Myriad Eye Dao Lord.

“It was a trap from the start.” A dragon lord said with certainty.

“She used herself as the bait.” A big shot shuddered: “But how did she summon the tribulation?”

“She probably wanted to bait out All-things Dao Lord and Illumination Conqueror too.” An ancient ancestor said.

Listeners thought that her success was near perfect, just missing the opposing leaders. Nonetheless, this historical feat put her on the same level as Light-dragon and Demon Conqueror.

The next question became - would All-things and Illumination be able to survive the tribulations?

Their hypothetical death would have changed the political landscape of the upper continents. It meant that The People’s fighting force would become drastically inferior.

“The courage and determination.” Li Xian’er praised since there was no guarantee of Ye Fantian surviving the tribulation. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It became apparent that she would be able to travel far on the dao path since she possessed all the necessary attributes - talent and dao heart. In fact, she might even be able to surpass Light-dragon and Demon Conqueror.

Other supreme geniuses wouldn’t have taken the same risk. After all, they had a bright future and other options.

Now, she glanced at the crowd and saw Li Qiye, prompting her to bow. Although this was her own plan, Li Qiye was her inspiration and guide despite not being overly blatant.

She considered him as a role model in this regard - the reason why she knew that this was possible.

“Bam!” Suddenly, someone landed in front of her.

He possessed a mighty aura that could make the entire world and its inhabitants quake.

“Illumination Conqueror!” Many shouted in astonishment after seeing the once-pillar of The People.

His influence couldn’t be overstated during his golden age. As a mortal, he struggled and made it to the top of the cultivation world. With that, he mobilized The People and made them competitive.

.

Not to mention regular cultivators, even dao lords and conquerors were willing to follow him. This resulted in the foundation of Dao Alliance.

During its prime, it was certainly the strongest out of the four alliances. Perhaps this played a part in Illumination Conqueror’s confidence and ego. He believed that he had enough forces now to wipe The Race off the upper continents.

His tyrannical and overbearing reign alienated his closest supporters, ending with an unmendable chasm in Dao Alliance.

A prime example of this was none other than Swordsea Dao Lord. He was a part of Dao Alliance until he had enough of Illumination and left to join Divine Alliance.

After seeing his appearance, everyone understood that he had been here the entire time. Otherwise, Autumn Conqueror wouldn’t have been crying for help repeatedly.

“See, I told you he was a bastard.” Ferocity told the group.
