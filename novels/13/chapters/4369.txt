Chapter 4370: Tough Position

The monarch was stuck in quite a predicament. This was beyond his station as well.

All disciples in Dragon would risk their lives defending the sacred heirloom of their progenitor. Thus, if he were to ask the ancestors about handing the item over, what would be the result?

The ancestors would kill him before Li Qiye. This was no different from being traitorous and disrespectful to the progenitor. These serious offenses were punishable by death. Even his clan members could be implicated.

Thus, there was no way the monarch would ever agree. Nonetheless, he still had a strange feeling of being convinced by Li Qiye’s words. He felt that Li Qiye could grab the ancestral heirloom without being stopped while killing everyone in his way.

This included all of Dragon. They could fight to the very last man and fail to stop Li Qiye. He didn’t understand why he had this silly feeling and thought that he had gone crazy. Others would certainly think so.

This was a battle between an ant and an elephant. A nobody like Li Qiye stood no chance. However, the more the conversation went on, he understood why his daughter paid such close attention to Li Qiye. There was something inscrutable about him.

“This is beyond me, Young Noble.” He then earnestly answered: “I hope that the feud between you and my sect will resolve.”

“This isn’t a feud. A feud requires the two sides to be relatively even in strength. In this case, I can erase the other party with a hand wave akin to removing some cobwebs.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“...” The monarch couldn’t believe that Li Qiye had just compared Dragon to cobwebs. Nonetheless, the essence was true. A one-sided contest couldn’t be considered a feud.

“Putting your ancestors aside, I will give you more time since I like you and your daughter. Otherwise, they might call me a bully.” Li Qiye smiled.

The monarch felt his insanity grew proportionally to Li Qiye’s displayed arrogance.

“Young Noble, please stay put first.” He suggested: “Do give us time so I can go talk to the elders regarding the roost. The outcome aside, I will try my very best.”

He indeed took Li Qiye very seriously and decided to work hard. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’ve become quite soft in the face of sincerity.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I will give you time but remember, my patience has a limit.”

“I understand, I will hurry.” The monarch said while feeling relieved within for some reason.

Though Li Qiye’s reason was both rude and outrageous, he still treated Li Qiye as an esteemed guest. The group enjoyed the treatment usually seen for sect masters of great powers.

Of course, some members of Dragon were unhappy with this. After all, the Jian wasn’t the only one in charge. They criticized the monarch for treating a bunch of nobodies so well but he simply ignored them.

Elder Hu and the young ones thought that they were dreaming after seeing their accommodations.

Previously, they weren’t qualified to even enter Phoenix Ground. Even the relatively-unknown expert cultivators would need to sleep at the base. It was an honor to be enjoying this privilege, enough for them to brag before the smaller sects for a lifetime.

Only Li Qiye didn’t care and only chuckled after seeing the impressed youths.

In fact, the monarch purposely did this in order to see Li Qiye’s reaction. The guy’s nonchalant attitude towards wealth and luxury made him even more careful.

However, he himself couldn’t decide everything in Phoenix Ground. On the second day, some came asking for trouble.

Loud commotion and fighting noises happened outside the door, prompting Li Qiye to frown.

“Boom!” He went outside and saw his allies being pushed back by a single punch.

They had formed a formation to fight, back to back. Elder Hu and Wang Weiqiao were included as well.

Their opponent was an exceptional disciple from Phoenix Ground. Others called him “Senior Brother Sky Eagle”.

He was strong indeed. He spread his wings and just one punch was enough to break the formation. Rays came from the wings and stung the group.

“Retreat!” Weiqiao ordered, aware that they were outmatched.

Their defeat was expected. Sky Eagle was a genius from a behemoth. He alone could destroy a small sect since he was far stronger than Deer King.

“Why are you leaving? The senior brother only wants to spar.” A few disciples from Phoenix Ground blocked their path and forced them back into the range of the senior brother’s sword rays.

They didn’t want to kill the group, only humiliate them. After all, these guys didn’t deserve the highest treatment. They had to teach them how to tuck their tail between their legs and know their place.

Sky Eagle, on the other hand, had just returned from the capital and knew the sect master’s intent. This was his reason for being here.

In the case of success, he would be noted by the elders, perhaps even becoming a prime target for grooming.
