Chapter 3760: I’m Fishing

It didn’t take long before only Dugu Lan was left on Minor Sacred Mountain. She came over to the creek and bowed deeply towards Li Qiye: “This disciple from Duality Academy greets you, Young Master.”

“What is it?” Li Qiye slowly opened his eyes to look at her and nodded. He went back to focusing on fishing as if nothing was more interesting to him. He only gave a top beauty like her a single glance.

She became quite curious - was he really just fishing? She stopped thinking about it and got to the point: “I believe I might not be the scion’s match.”

Li Qiye shook his head: “Absolutely. Your defeat is certain.”

Dugu Lan wasn’t offended by this statement. Anyone else would have been a bit peeved because it was too early to say. This was definitely an insult towards her ability.

She bowed again and asked: “That’s why I am seeking your guidance, Young Master.”

She spoke with sincerity and humility. These traits always earned some points, not to mention that she was beautiful and talented.

“I have nothing to teach.” Li Qiye smiled: “Your comprehension of the grand dao is exceptional among your age group. You already know what to do.”

“I saw that Young Master could break Force Devourer. I’m sure that you can...” She paused for a bit before adding.

“Yes, I can break Righteous Sect’s seven chapters.” Li Qiye chuckled.

Others might be surprised but this was within her expectation. The seven chapters were profound and wide-ranging. Just solving one was amazing, let alone all seven.

“Do you think you can win even if I teach you this method?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hmm...” She took her time before answering: “I haven’t fought him so I can’t say, I will just try my best.”

“Good mindset.” Li Qiye smiled: “The truth is that victory isn’t certain even in that case.”

“I’m sure Young Master has a way to defeat him.” Dugu Lan said softly.

Li Qiye didn’t answer right away. He stared at his fishing pole for a bit before replying: “Yes, there are millions of methods to defeat him. I can pick any random one.”

His nonchalant comment would incite skepticism. Who was Righteous Scion? The current number one genius in the southern West King. His grand dao was at a peerless level.

“It’s to be expected. If you join the fray, you’ll shock all of Eight Desolaces...” She responded.

“Okay, don’t flatter me now.” Li Qiye interrupted her with a hand wave. He then asked: “Do you want to win or something else?”

She met his gaze straight on and answered: “For me, nothing is better than actually winning but losing is understandable as well. My cultivation is inferior and there’s a large gap in our actual battle prowess. It’s not shameful to lose to a better combatant.”

She paused for a bit before moving on: “The only problem is that I’ll be letting down my sect and the holy ground. Of course, the holy ground has been standing strong for eras, this defeat doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. It’s more of a personal shortcoming, that I am not excellent enough to do everything perfectly.”

She had a natural expression as she admitted this.

“Well said, well said.” Li Qiye laughed and approved of her.

She smiled gorgeously in response. “Young Master, will you join?” She asked afterward.

“Did you say that the holy ground will be just fine after this defeat? It still has all of its foundations and plenty of hidden experts. This contest is trivial and doesn’t affect me in the slightest.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, but given your status, you can represent the holy ground, you’re its...” Dugu Lan couldn’t help but say.

“You’re mistaken, I don’t represent the holy ground nor Vajra. It’s all a misconception, I only represent myself and have no other identity.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Nothing he had said surprised her until now. She stared at him with uncertainty: “Young Master, what do you mean...”

Li Qiye stared implicatively at her and said: “Don’t count on me for this battle, I’m not interested at all. You will bear the banner for this tough competition between the holy ground and Righteous.”

“Young Master, I suddenly feel an overwhelming weight on my shoulders. It’s suffocating.” She took a deep breath and smiled wryly.

“Isn’t that a good thing? It’s time for you to rise up and reach the next height.” Li Qiye said.

“But shouldering the reputation of the holy ground is such a serious responsibility.” She responded.

“The heaven tests the capable, that’s all.” Li Qiye flatly responded.

“Will you come to watch the battle?” She stopped convincing him to help. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t worry, I’ll come to show my support if I’m not occupied with important business.” Li Qiye paused for a moment before answering.

She felt better even though he didn’t promise anything. Just his presence would take the weight off her shoulders.

With that, Li Qiye closed his eyes again, seemingly falling asleep.

She stopped bothering him and stared at the fishing rod. After a while, nothing was happening; no fish was biting at all.

Some time passed and he stared at her, shaking his head: “Holding the rod doesn’t mean that one is fishing.”

She didn’t expect him to speak to her again but agreed with the logic.

He then began to pull back the string. Who knows how long it was but this took forever and the hook was still nowhere to be found.

The problem was, once it left the water, she noticed that it wasn’t a fishhook at the end of the string.
