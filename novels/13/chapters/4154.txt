Chapter 4155: Divine Dragon Tail Whip

“Boom!” When the scion’s attack failed, the region suddenly trembled intensely. The draconic beam that protected Li Qiye also pierced through the suppression of the formation.

This dragon roared and exuded its torrential aura just like a primordial flood. It manifested into an actual true dragon with a pulsing radiance. It seemed to be made of bright stars, looking magnificent and beautiful.

The fact that it didn’t have a physical body didn’t deter its awe-inspiring presence. It loomed above all existences and served as the ruler of all beasts.

Spectators were in disbelief. They had never seen a true dragon before and some didn’t believe in the existence of one.

However, this celestial dragon might not have a physical body yet its draconic aura felt so real and oppressive.

They were as frightened as can be, thinking that no other dragons could be more intimidating than this one.

“Is this a true dragon?” One spectator asked.

“It can’t be. There are differences compared to the mythical creature in the text.” An ancestor pondered for a moment before answering.

“Raa!” The dragon roared again and its aura intensified, instantly crushing the area around it. As it lunged downward, space and time broke right away. Its claws could tear the myriad dao apart. Defenses and merit laws were as feeble as pieces of paper.

Everyone lost their courage due to the sheer devastation of the attack.

“Immortal-sealing Swords!” Wandao Jian was aghast and decided to switch it up.

After hearing this command, the group sent out numerous divine swords. They kept on changing and rotating, capable of stopping all offense or crushing the enemies.

“Rumble!” The swords flew towards the celestial dragon but were instantly destroyed by its claws.

“We’re leaving!” Wandao Jian read the situation perfectly and knew that their formation wouldn’t hold up against this celestial dragon.

“Clank!” Abyss Scion was extremely decisive and pulled back his heavenly sword. Both ran for the horizon. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Raa!” The celestial dragon then whipped its tail. The stars and galaxies above were swept away as if they were mere spiderwebs - a testament to the power of this attack.

Everyone bellowed in horror as a result. In the mortal realm, there was a martial art technique with the name, “Divine Dragon Tail Whip”. This name was also popular in the cultivation world.

Many sects and countries had a technique with this name. However, they certainly didn’t deserve the name and paled before this celestial dragon’s strike.

“Boom!” The supreme formation from Sea Emperor instantly exploded, resulting in the gruesome death of many elders and protectors.

They were either reduced to bloody mists or some pieces would be left behind, falling down into the lake.

This shocked the spectators. The elders and protectors from Sea Emperor were extremely powerful and prestigious. Alas, all of them were dead now, Wandao Jian included.

This seemed to be a fight between a dragon and insects. One tail whip alone ended the contest. Thus, everyone became afraid of the celestial dragon since they wouldn’t have fared any better.

“That’s terrifying.” An old existence turned pale since only the scion managed to escape in time. Therefore, this was an absolute failure for Sea Emperor.

“Raa!” The astonished spectators then saw the celestial dragon roaring at Li Qiye once before crashing back into the lake and disappearing without a trace.

“What the hell was that?” Someone regained his wits and wondered if that was a true dragon.

The knowledgeable ancestors disagreed with this because the celestial dragon didn’t fit the descriptions in the ancient texts. Alas, what else could be as strong?

“Was that still the money fall method?” An expert remembered the refined jades tossed out by Li Qiye.

“I don’t think it has anything to do with that method. It might be the lake itself.” An ancestor from a dao lord lineage shook his head.

No one had a definite answer but all in all, Li Qiye was able to summon such a monstrous creature to eliminate his enemies.

“So there are things at the bottom of the lake.” A big shot focused his sight on the bottom of the lake but didn’t notice anything peculiar.

“This might be the reason why Cloud Dream Lake has been around for so long. The bandits are lucky to be here.” A high elder said.

Others agreed with this because numerous eras have passed yet this lair of evil still continued to exist. Many dao lords have appeared and it wouldn’t have been hard for them to eliminate this place.
