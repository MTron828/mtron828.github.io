Chapter 3816: Result

The result was obvious. Though they had expected this from the very beginning, they still had a hard time accepting it.

“I’ve lost. Your cultivation is above my reach, I wholeheartedly recognize this defeat.” Dugu Lan sighed but maintained a calm expression.

The members of the holy ground felt awful, especially the young ones. Some of them lowered their head.

Her defeat was akin to the entire young generation of the holy ground conceding to Righteous Scion.

The holy ground was vast with plenty of cultivators and talents. In the south, only Righteous Sect could compete with it.

Today, the scion came with a challenge but no one could defeat him. This was a tough pill for the youths to swallow.

If they were allies, then this would have been more bearable. The battles would be considered exhibition matches to build comradery. Unfortunately, this wasn’t the case.

Righteous Sect and Buddha Holy Ground always had animosity towards each other even during periods of peace.

Most recently, Buddha Supreme and Righteous Supreme started an alliance between the two powers. Nonetheless, the rivalry was bone-deep for the members.

The young generation represented the future. Thus, it meant that the holy ground would be inferior for years to come.

Alas, what else could they do? Their great geniuses have lost, including Dugu Lan. The latter has proven herself to be the number one genius of the holy ground. Alas, she still couldn’t take on the scion.

His supremacy over the young generation was now confirmed to the chagrin of the holy ground.

Nonetheless, no one could criticize Dugu Lan for losing. They thought that she had done a great job and gained glory in the process.

Her power was obviously above anyone else in the holy ground, especially the famous sword art. Even those from the last generation were frightened.

Righteous Scion himself didn’t gloat. He smiled and said: “You’re too kind, Fairy Dugu. The Trinity Sword Art alone is beyond my reach. The only issue is your cultivation or I would have lost.”

“I owe it all to the distinguished predecessors. Though I’ve lost, I have no grievances or regrets.” She replied.

“Your peerless sword dao makes my trip to the holy ground worth it, seeing Trinity in person is also a dream come true.” The scion said.

That was something everyone agreed upon - the might of the marvelous Trinity Sword Art.

“How does Trinity compare to the nine paths of Finality?” Someone boldly asked.

The crowd started speculating right away. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Finality Sword Art was the pinnacle of this dao. How far off was Trinity in comparison?

Of course, no one could answer this. In the present south, only a selected few were lucky enough to witness Finality on top of surviving to the present.

“I hope the rest of your trip will be delightful.” Dugu Lan cupped her fist towards the scion.

He returned the gesture and said: “Thank you, Fairy. I think it’ll end soon.”

Dugu Lan didn’t say anything else and left while embracing her sword, leaving the scion behind.

“Anyone else wishes to fight?” The scion turned his attention towards the crowd.

Though his tone wasn’t provocative and arrogant, everyone became frozen. Some looked down in order to avoid his gaze.

The majority of the geniuses in the holy ground were present but it would be foolish to try and fight him. In fact, just having the courage to give it a shot would be quite commendable.

His power level became abundantly clear at this point. Most ancestors would lose to him since he was quite close to being at the grandmaster level.

“There’s only one person left.” Someone said what was on everyone’s mind.

“Li Qiye.” All the ancestors thought so too: “He’s the only one who can defeat Righteous Scion.”

Despite Li Qiye’s meager cultivation, he has never tasted defeat since his dao debut. Unfortunately, he wasn’t interested in this matter.

“Hmph, all of his abilities are for nothing.” One youth snorted: “He won’t contribute to the holy ground and even murdered capable geniuses. He’s nothing more than the black horse of the herd.”

The young members naturally disliked Li Qiye for killing Phantom and Hu Ben then refusing to fight the scion.

“I see, I won’t force the issue. What a shame, the holy ground has plenty of dragons and tigers. Unfortunately, so few actually want to fight...” The scion looked around and didn’t see anyone. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The crowd grew increasingly annoyed even though he wasn’t mocking the holy ground.

“Junior, that’s enough out of you!” A thunderous roar detonated in the air.

“Clank!” Grand dao of the sword type emerged in the form of a rainbow, allowing one person to walk across the sky.

“Sword Hero again.” Everyone knew who he was since he was sent away earlier.

It looked like the meeting with the king was finally concluded. He seemed to be in a bad mood.

“Sword Hero of Vajra. I have heard of your sword dao before. Though I wish to contend against the young generation of the holy ground, I don’t mind if you wish to teach me a lesson.” The scion wasn’t afraid in the slightest.
