A while ago, Huang Quanwei didn’t pay any attention to Li Qiye because no matter how one looked at it, he was too ordinary, just a regular disciple at best.

“This is the First Disciple of our sect, also our First Brother.” Fan Miaozhen introduced Li Qiye.

“First Brother?” Quanwei was surprised because he has never heard about this person before. He was under the impression that Miaozhen was in charge of the young generation.

“Oh, I see, your fame precedes you, First Brother.” Quanwei didn’t dispute this and cupped his fist.

Longevity Valley was the orthodox branch so in theory, the First Disciple of this sect was going to inherit Longevity Sage’s role, a very prestigious position.

However, Quanwei didn’t care too much. Li Qiye wasn’t famous at all, let alone compared to the Three Ladies.

Inferior to his own Junior Sisters, one could see that this First Brother was in name only, most likely average in skills at best just like his appearance.

He probably got lucky from joining the sect early for that generation and becoming the First Disciple before everyone else. Thus, Quanwei felt superior to him still.

Li Qiye only smiled back at the greeting.

This annoyed Quanwei, feeling that Li Qiye was putting up an act. He asked: “So you also understand poison, First Brother?”

He was one of the three most talented in Everlasting, well-respected by many others. So now, this “First Disciple” dared to treat him like this?

“Our First Brother knows everything - pills, medicines, alchemy, poison, you name it.” Miaozhen jumped in.

“Ah, I see, excuse me then. I would definitely like to learn from you, First Brother.” Quanwei didn’t believe this at all.

In his mind, Miaozhen was only defending the valley’s honor. If Li Qiye was actually this gifted, he wouldn’t be an unknown character and would have been much more famous than their group of three in Everlasting. After all, she couldn’t let others make fun of their First Disciple.

“We can’t wait any longer since the elder’s wound is quite serious. Brother Huang, please show us your skill.” Yalan slightly frowned before suggesting.

She could tell that her Senior Sister was trying to use Li Qiye to take Quanwei down. Of course, she wasn’t protecting Quanwei either and only interrupted out of worries for the elder’s wound. The poison needed to be cure with haste.

She also didn’t know anything about this First Disciple. Her nature was much simpler than Miaozhen, only focusing on medicine and not about the changes in the world or other struggles. Thus, she didn’t think about this person as much as Miaozhen as well as the implications.

It wasn’t that she didn’t believe Miaozhen’s claim about Li Qiye, she just didn’t wish to risk the life of a patient. Picking the renowned Poison King for this task was certainly the right choice over a guy she had only met for the first time just now.

“Sure thing.” Quanwei smiled: “Let me see the elder’s poisonous wound, then I’ll ask First Disciple for help if I don’t understand something.”

Another humble yet empty comment from Quanwei; he didn’t even bother looking at Li Qiye as he spoke. As long as the wound was actually a poisonous one, he wouldn’t need any help, not from a nobody.

This was his chance to perform in front of the beauty. Perhaps his supreme poison mastery could win her favor.

“Then what are we waiting for, let’s go see the elder.” Miaozhen pulled Li Qiye inside.

The other scene was a striking contrast. Quanwei bowed towards Yalan and gestured: “Junior Sister, you first.”

This was no contest. In his eyes, a dashing genius like him was a thousand times better than someone like Li Qiye.

“Brother Huang, please.” She politely nodded and entered with him.

On the wooden bed was an old man of a stout stature and a fierce pair of eyes, almost eagle-like. His appearance was certainly imposing unlike his current state. He seemed to be in pain, tortured by the poison resulting in considerable weight loss.

After seeing Li Qiye and Miaozhen, he barely sat up and said: “Miss Fan, please forgive me for not being able to stand up to greet you.”

His last name was Yang, an elder from a side branch of Longevity. Even Yalan failed to cure the poison, only able to stop it from spreading.

“No need for such formality, Elder Yang, we’re family.” She spoke with the bearing of a First Sister.

Yalan and Quanwei came as well. The elder quickly asked: “Miss Mu, is there a way?”

This has been a test of his sanity, writhing in pain the entire time. He would have died if it wasn’t for her so now, he placed all of his hope on her since she still hasn’t given up.

“Don’t worry, Elder, we will find a cure for your poison.” She said before introducing: “I have invited a famous doctor for you, this is Poison King Huang, I’m confident he can do it.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Ah, Virtuous Nephew Huang, my pleasure.” The elder became excited and quickly cupped his fist: “Your mastery of poison is matchless, looks like this old man is lucky enough to meet a true master.”

“You’re too kind, Elder.” Quanwei remained humble but was feeling pretty good inside. He was winning a lot of face in front of his goddess, and soon, he’ll be able to show off his skills.

“I’ll leave it to you then.” The elder heaved a sigh of relief.

The title of Poison King was quite famous and his skills left no room for doubt. He would certainly have a way to cure this poison.

Meanwhile, Miaozhen had been watching Li Qiye only. She smiled and said: “Elder Yang, our First Brother is also a poison master.”

Li Qiye smiled after seeing the sudden recommendation.

“First Brother?” The elder didn’t know who she was talking about.

“This is the First Disciple of Longevity Valley, also our master’s highest seniority disciple.” Miaozhen pushed Li Qiye forward.

“Since when did the sage appoint one?” The elder was surprised because this position has been left unfilled. He has never heard about this matter before.

“You will need to ask my master.” Miaozhen smiled: “Our First Brother is good at everything, alchemy, medicine, poison, whatever. He’s the pride of our Longevity Valley.”

She sounded like an aunt at a market praising her own merchandises. Li Qiye couldn’t help but become amused.

“Good at everything?” The elder became surprised again and was still skeptical.

He was still an elder, albeit from a side branch, and should have heard of such a gifted disciple.

“If you don’t mind, our First Brother can give it a shot too.” Miaozhen suggested.

Yalan was feeling a bit helpless at her Senior Sister. Their relationship was quite good, but Miaozhen was frankly an eccentric little devil, a source of headache for everyone.

“Longevity System has many poison research, but how many are actually masters at this art?” Quanwei stepped up while proudly arching his chest.
