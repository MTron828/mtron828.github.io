Ten tornadoes resembling ten black chains pulled the entire Soaring Immortal Sect into the Grand Sea.

The scene was magnificent as if there were two worlds in this location - one in the ocean and one in the sky.

After its entrance, the tornadoes created thick laws. At the same time, multiple old battlefields fell down from the sky. They were full of primordial chaos and power.

They combined with the thick laws and came together to form a gigantic field as large as a continent. This particular battle stage was large enough to mobilize billions of troops to any place in the nine worlds!

One imperial lineage would find it difficult to possess even one of these ancient and powerful battlefields. Now, Soaring Immortal actually had so many. Its abundant resources were no joke.

“What does Soaring Immortal want to do?” Many became curious.

“They are copying the Immortal Emperors who used to build these stages in order to inspect the troops before mobilization.” A big shot speculated.

“It’s not just an inspection or a war rally.” A Godking from the last generation noticed something: “Looks like they want to build a supreme formation. Such a formation could attack any place in the nine worlds and could also act as a barrier. If anyone wants to attack the sect, they have to break through this defensive line first. But what legion is powerful enough to break through this formation?”

In a short time, the Grand Sea fell into a widespread panic. They understood that after this battle platform was formed, Soaring Immortal could attack any sect regardless of the location. However, others would need to break this formation first.

The old Godking was correct. This battle platform was erected on a great formation called Omnidirectional Immortal Annihilation by Li Qiye.

Meanwhile, another news came out. Hai Lin once again gathered a legion for a counterattack, consisting of more than thirty great powers joining this time.

Furthermore, additional people joined his ranks after the news, even several imperial lineages. His recruitment wasn’t limited to the Grand Sea either. Experts and even sects from the other regions joined him as well.

This was because Soaring Immortal’s presence pressured everyone. Even those not from the Grand Sea felt that after Soaring Immortal ruled this region, they would send expeditions to other places as well.

Because of these worries, some sects secretly sent experts as well. These ancestors all hid their identity so no one knew where they were from.

This army was quite mighty and became the strongest alliance to oppose Soaring Immortal. Because Hai Lin was always at the forefront in fighting against Soaring Immortal, he was nominated as the commander of the legion.

Despite the great number of experts and sects in this legion, many people weren’t optimistic about it.

“This alliance might be powerful but it is still a ragtag group. How can it match the well-organized legion from Soaring Immortal?” People doubted even before the battle. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A sharp Godking commented: “Fiercest is the only one who can handle Soaring Immortal at this moment. For example, his Azure Dragon Legion is so ferocious. Only such a force could compete against Soaring Immortal.”

After Fiercest was brought up, everyone turned over to Pearl. However, this legion and Fiercest were inactive. No one knew of their plan just yet.

“Hai Lin’s legion should work together with Fiercest. That’s the only chance for victory.” Many shared this belief. In fact, some in his legion proposed this to Hai Lin.

They were aware that very few characters could talk to Fiercest. Thus, they proposed for Hai Lin to go in person in order to talk about a new alliance.

This was a reasonable proposal since Hai Lin and Fiercest have met in the past. Moreover, Fiercest had even helped him before. Thus, there was no better candidate than Hai Lin to go and talk with Li Qiye.

In the end, under the recommendation of his legion, Hai Lin went to see Fiercest at Pearl.

Li Qiye gave him enough face and granted an audience. He sat high in the hall and smiled at Hai Lin.

“Please excuse my sudden visit, Brother Li.” Hai Lin didn’t dare to show any slight and bowed towards Li Qiye with great humility.

He was famous right now and praised as the leader in fighting against Soaring Immortal. He was very influential and loved by many great powers at the Grand Sea.

Moreover, he was the commander of the alliance at this moment so his fame and authority were only below Fiercest and Long Aotian.

Anyone else would become complacent and smug. However, Hai Lin had near-death experiences before and he knew that there was a big gap between him and someone like Fiercest. Plus, Fiercest had saved his life before so he owed him a debt!

“Have a seat.” Li Qiye gently nodded and said carefreely.

Hai Lin sat down and cupped his fist: “Brother Li, Soaring Immortal is a great threat to the entire Mortal Emperor World. As a member of the Grand Sea, I have the responsibility to resist. I lack experience but was fortunate enough to be supported by everyone. I come here, representing the Mortal Emperor Alliance, to ask you for help.”

Li Qiye smiled at the youth’s humble attitude and said: “Looks like you know how to act, knowing when to push and when to pull.”

“Thank you.” Hai Lin said: “This has nothing to do with personal glory. It is relating to the survival of the Grand Sea. I am here to humbly ask for your help, Brother Li.”

Hai Lin was not a soft person. On the contrary, he was a very arrogant and confident man. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have clashed with Long Aotian so many times. However, this matter was an existential crisis so he let go of his own pride in order to ask for assistance.

“The survival of the Grand Sea has nothing to do with me.” Li Qiye gently shook his head.

“You might not be from the Grand Sea but you were still born in the Mortal Emperor World.” Hai Lin hastily added: “If the Grand Sea were to fall, Soaring Immortal would point its sword at Mortal Emperor next. In the end, you will still have to fight them. It is better to fight them now before they grow stronger.”

“It’s only Soaring Immortal. Destroying them, to me, is a piece of cake, not worth talking about.” Li Qiye said without thinking.

“Well...” Hai Lin had no response.

Li Qiye smiled after seeing this: “You are the commander of the alliance so you can wait until Soaring Immortal and I kill each other, then take advantage of the remaining mess, capturing both sides at the same time. Perhaps you will be the final victor in the competition for the Heaven’s Will. Your prestige will make the world listen to you so you can become the next emperor.”

“No, I’m afraid you misunderstood me, Brother Li.” Hai Lin said: “I definitely do not have this idea nor dare try to carry it out. No one will be emperor but you in this generation.”

Li Qiye gently shook his head: “It doesn’t matter what you think. Action speaks louder than words.”

“...” Hai Lin became quiet after hearing this. Meanwhile, Li Qiye simply stared at him and waited.

After a long time, Hai Lin took a deep breath and said seriously: “I know that you do not trust me. After all, wars are no joke. This battle will involve the fate of the entire Mortal Emperor World and the competition for the throne. I can see why Brother Li is choosing to not mobilize your troops.”

Hai Lin felt that Li Qiye’s caution was warranted. If Li Qiye and Soaring Immortal were to be caught up in a costly battle, then he would lose everything that he had been working for.
