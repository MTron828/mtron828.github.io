Chapter 4832: Epoch Paragon Artifacts

Running was no longer possible for them at this point. Since this was Li Qiye’s epoch, there was no hiding from him.

The only exception was leaping out of time and this epoch. However, if they could do something like that, they would have done so long ago instead of being trapped here.

In order to avoid a direct confrontation with current epoch lords, they usually hid in the borders of space. Their peers had done the same.

“Can’t pig out forever without vomiting.” Li Qiye smiled: “I will bury you three to nourish this world.”

Both three and the hidden overlords shuddered after hearing this. They coveted Li Qiye’s flesh but the opposite was true.

Though their epoch was long gone, they themselves contained its essences and treasures. Some of them had swallowed their epoch to stay alive for this long.

Even if Li Qiye didn’t wish to devour them, they could still serve to nourish Eight Desolaces. Triune Alligator Lord was a prime example.

He had devoured one continent but after being killed, he would return this energy back to Eight Desolaces along with everything else he had. This would benefit the living beings of this world for eras to come.

“Damn it all.” The three exchanged glances and gritted their teeth. They had no choice but to fight.

“Fellow Daoists, this world has changed, and so did the rules.” Undying Lord’s chilling voice echoed to the far reaches of Inner Wild and space: “We might die today and nourish this world, you all shall be next.”

He tried to involve the other overlords so that they would join the fight to kill Li Qiye.

“Vast the world is, there is still no place to hide.” Dead Immortal continued: “He will not stop with just us, this is inevitable.”

“Fight alongside us and we shall divide this epoch to continue our glorious days.” Lord of the Deeps went on.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t stop them from finding allies.

Alas, no one answered them. The overlords who were whispering to each other have stopped all streams of communication.

Their coordinates have been exposed. Now, the only thought on their mind was finding a new place to hide. No one was stupid enough to show up.

“Brother Da!” Undying Lord called for Silly Da again but the creature still didn’t respond.

“Seems like no one cares enough to help you three.” Li Qiye smirked.

The three knew that the lack of response was due to their high probability of dying in battle. If there was even a decent chance of winning, the others would have run out by now since they desired Li Qiye’s flesh along with the epoch.

“Shall we start?” Undying Lord decided to fight to the very end.

“Come, my weapon!” He roared.

“Boom!” An old citadel appeared from the abyss. It shared the same name as its master - Undying Citadel.

The celestials and death energy floated around the city. This place has been accumulating the death affinity for ages. If it were to descend to the mortal world, it would refine all living beings and turn them into death energy.

“Whoosh!” An immortal ray flew out of the citadel.

All living beings felt the temporal flow reversing and the laws receded like the tides. Once they calmed down, this ray has been caught by Undying Lord.

It turned out that this was a flying dagger made from an unknown material. Its main affinity was time.

Alas, upon closer inspection, this particular weapon didn’t seem to be complete. The immortal ray within the dagger was still chaotic.

“Temporal Dagger.” Undying Lord stared at his epoch paragon weapon.

“It’s incomplete.” A different overlord murmured while observing it.

Undying Lord crafted this weapon during his prime. Alas, he couldn’t finish it before the end of his epoch. Therefore, he left it in his citadel in order to gestate it with the remaining essences of the epoch, hoping for grand completion.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Boom!” A maelstrom in the abyss emerged with a rotation capable of sucking in the heaven. All the oceans in Eight Desolaces couldn’t fill it up.

“Rumble!” Starry lights surged from the bottom of the maelstrom as if it had devoured galaxies before. A certain thing flew out and landed in the abyssal lord’s hand.

It was a square crystal with countless galaxies inside, resulting in beautiful glimmers. Unfortunately, there were cracks in this cosmic crystal. There seemed to be too many stars and it couldn’t fully contain the power within.

“Epoch Cube.” The abyssal lord revealed the name of his paragon artifact. The looks in his eyes became colder and more determined.

“Buzz.” In Desolate Wild by the border, a lake had shimmering waters with the consistency of mercury.

A silvery light came from the elusive bottom. It had an inscrutable mystique, seemingly capable of taking this lake to any epoch.

“Boom!” A silver maelstrom flew out of the lake and appeared above Dead Immortal.

The moment it appeared, tribulation bolts detonated in the center to everyone’s horror.
