Chapter 4237: Sword, Come

Everlasting Sword God was trapped in the ocean of lightning. The crowd thought this move could easily destroy a kingdom.

How many cultivators or even sects in Sword Continent could actually withstand it? Most youths didn’t understand the profundities behind the attack but could still sense its power.

Everyone had heard about the five overlords before and how strong they were. Nonetheless, this used to be limited in their imagination until today.

In the past, they respected and feared these cultivators. Now, fear has become the overwhelming emotion.

“Clank!” Everlasting held her sword vertically in front of her chest and activated its power.

Rays of light twisted together and made its user ethereal. Time and space became disorderly; the past and the present suddenly became unclear.

If the past and the present couldn’t be distinguished, the sword god was no longer here. This made it impossible to injure her.

Thus, the lightning bolts and swords from the venerable failed to pierce her since they couldn’t travel back to the past.

“Nice move!” The venerable shouted after seeing this and decided to switch it up.

The ocean of lightning disappeared and was replaced by a tsunami of swords instead. It covered everyone and the crowd became horrified.

However, it just somehow passed through without hurting them, heading for Everlasting Sword God. It had the same illusory nature as the sword god’s current state.

As it came closer to the target, spectators then realized that it wasn’t moving spatially but rather, temporally. They traveled to the past; that’s the only way to take down the sword god.

“Tidal Death!” Vastsea Venerable roared.

“Everlasting Leap!” The sword god raised her sword and cut time itself.

Everything became frozen, including the river of time. Spectators felt that time had come to a stop and they couldn’t move.

The severing location was enough to cease the incoming tsunami as well.

In the next second, they regained their freedom and heard loud clanks. They looked over and saw the sword god unleashing a barrage of thrust at the venerable, aiming at his weak spots. The latter retaliated, resulting in a fierce fight.

Both proved their worth as they unleashed the mysteries of the sword dao. Though few spectators could truly understand, everyone still became immersed in their battle and learned from it. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

On the other hand, this region was victimized by the two concurrent battles. Waves shot up and blotted out the sky.

The only one who found this boring was Li Qiye. After a brief moment, he yawned and said: “Have fun, I’ll be grabbing the sword.”

The others were too preoccupied with their fight to pay attention to him. He walked in the air, completely unaffected by the rampant sword energies.

“What is he doing?” Nonetheless, some spectators still noticed him and became startled.

“Sword, come.” He reached one hand in the direction of Myriad Era.

“Clank!” The unbelievable happened - Myriad Era let out a long hum and pierce through the air.

It fell into his grasp before anyone could react. Once they saw this, they instantly became statues.

Even the venerable and the others stopped, unable to accept this reality. Ever since they got here, they have used everything to try to obtain the sword.

They utilized powerful treasures and peerless merit laws along with unbelievable means. Alas, those flames were hellish. Thus, Vastsea and Earthraiser gave the order to stop.

But now, Li Qiye simply called for it and it actually flew away from the boulder. The guy didn’t use any treasure or merit law, hence the shock from members of the two behemoths. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Myriad Era!” Alas, Vastsea and Earthraiser woke up from their stupor and instantly flew towards Li Qiye.

There was no way they would give up on this sword.

“Don’t think about it.” Everlasting Sword God and her allies stopped them from reaching Li Qiye.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The ancestors from the behemoths immediately unsheathed their sword while gazing intensely at Li Qiye.
