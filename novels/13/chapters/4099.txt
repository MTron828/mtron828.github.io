Chapter 4100: Sudden Phenomenon

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Everyone started fearing Li Qiye despite being aware of the formation doing the bulk of the work. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Nonetheless, no one could touch him while he resided in the plain with control over the ancient formation.

The top dogs knew that as long as Li Qiye was here, no one had a chance of hurting him. Otherwise, they might suffer a worse outcome than Ninth’s, not being lucky and strong enough to get away. Not even a smidgen would be left of them.

“The whole thing doesn’t make any sense, I feel like Li Qiye just bumps into all the best stuff around, finding such a great treasure in this dead land.” A jealous spectator glared at Li Qiye.

Who would have thought that the plain would thrive right after his purchase? Its ancient formation could take down any foe. He got such a great deal so everyone was jealous of him.

“Once is luck, maybe twice, but for a third time? I’m afraid not. There’s something else going on.” A big shot disagreed.

His peers found this logical, recalling the Preeminent Legacy and the purchase of the plain. Was it all coincidental? Why did this billionaire run to the plain instead of just enjoying his money?

“What is Li Qiye’s goal?” This became the question because they were curious about his presence in Armament Mountain.

This was a long way from Omniscient Home yet Li Qiye still came running.

“I think he’s scheming against Armament Mountain.” Someone boldly speculated.

In this remote region, Li Qiye offended several behemoths. Another full-scale conflict seemed inevitable.

“Does anyone still want to find the treasury?” Li Qiye interrupted their conversations and stared at them.

Many felt their scalp tingling and staggered backward while avoiding his gaze.

Though he spoke normally without any hint of arrogance and imperiousness, they still didn’t dare to face him.

“Is there really a treasury?” One youth whispered.

The majority believed in the existence of a treasury left behind by the Tang’s progenitor. However, his incapable descendants eventually lost it.

This ancient formation should be one part of it. The Tang never used it in the last millions of years. They probably had no idea about its existence and decided to sell the plain to Li Qiye.

Unfortunately, none dared to invade the plain right now after seeing the previous results.

Ninth himself nearly died in the formation. Others would need to re-evaluate their strength first before trying.

“Of, of course not.” Some stammered in response, feeling fully intimidated.

“If that’s the case, why are you still here?” Li Qiye yawned and waved as if he was trying to chase some annoying flies.

Those who wanted to stick around to watch the fun show changed their mind. Some cupped their fist towards Li Qiye and turned to leave.

Everyone else started leaving in order to keep Li Qiye happy. Meanwhile, he yawned repeatedly, seemingly bored and sleepy by this point.

“Boom!” A loud explosion erupted out of nowhere and caused the ground to shake.

Dong Ling who was hanging around became frightened: “Young Noble, what are you doing? Did someone offend you?”

He assumed that it was Li Qiye causing the detonation. However, Li Qiye opened his eyes and finally got up out of the chair, looking more spirited than before.

“It’s Armament Mountain.” Ning Zhu gazed towards the distance.

Sure enough, the source of the explosions was Armament Mountain, not the Tang’s plain.

They looked over and saw layers of thick black clouds looming over Armament. They appeared rather heavy, on the verge of falling down.

The sect’s ancestral peak became bright and sent out rays to tear apart the clouds. Alas, the layers only increased in number, rendering the rays ineffective.

Eventually, the clouds started spinning and a maelstrom was formed.

“What the hell?” The members of Armament became startled.

“This isn’t good, an ominous visual phenomenon.” An expert immediately reported this to the elders.

This was the ancestral ground of a two-dao-lord sect. It was protected and blessed by these dao lords before. Normally, such an ominous phenomenon could never happen because the dao lords’ powers would suppress them.

“Clank!” Warning gongs sounded throughout the entire sect.

“Disciples, return to your post!” The elders commanded despite being unaware of the event.

The atmosphere inside the sect became extremely tense as disciples manned their posts. This seemed like the winds before the storm.

“We need to run now, this is looking bad!” Dong Ling became afraid after seeing this and immediately ran away.
