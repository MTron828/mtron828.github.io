Chapter 5095: A Sword

“Then why are you here? What is it that you want?” She was no fool and could tell there was something else going on.

Of course, she was prepared to face it because she had no other options. If it was anyone else, she could at least struggle for a bit and perhaps reverse the tides. This was not the case with Li Qiye.

“I just want to ask about the fortune that you obtained from Mist in the Ten Mountains.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“You know about it?” She was surprised at first but then again, Nightwalker had mentioned their agreement during her last visit.

She paused for a bit before continuing: “I obtained a sword there. It does have ties with Mist, hence my agreement with Nightwalker.”

Back when she was sixteen, she had fought numerous demons in order to destroy a dragon's lair. She came out triumphantly after slaying six dragon monarchs.

Alas, she nearly died after barely managing to escape. She then came across a divine sword that would later serve as the foundation for her dao and success.

“I want to see it.” Li Qiye reached forward with a casual tone. Nonetheless, this wasn’t a request. She must hand it over to him.

She sighed and summoned it. When it touched Li Qiye’s hand, bright rays shot out everywhere in a devastating manner.

She heard the cries of dragons - a manifestation of its murderous intents. Everyone would sense death approaching closer instantly.

Alas, escaping and resisting were futile. The moment any disobedience was shown, it would pierce the throat of even gods and emperors.

“I see.” He gently patted the blade and it hummed happily in response.

She was startled to see this because this was its reaction after killing a powerful opponent. For example - Heavenpeak Conqueror.

It enjoyed tasting the blood of worthy foes but seemed to like Li Qiye’s touch just as much.

“You wielded it before.” She said. This was akin to an aggressive dog acting docile with its master.

“More than that.” Li Qiye smiled and became slightly emotional.

This made it clear to her that he pursued her merely for the sword.

After a short moment, he caught her off guard by giving it back to her. Moreover, the essences of the dao appeared in his hand along with true chaos energy.

He channeled them into her body and she could feel her wounds closing. In just a short time, her external wounds were fully healed to her amazement. This healing art was something beyond her imagination since she knew how serious the injuries were.

“The dao injuries will require more rest.” He smiled and said.

“Why?” She eventually asked.

“Why what?”

“Why save me?”

In fact, not killing her was merciful. Putting feud aside, most would want to take her head so that they could add another line to their battle record.

“Because I felt like it.” He said and turned to leave.

She took a second to calm down before catching up to him: “So are we related somehow?”

“Not quite.” Li Qiye said: “You just have a special quality, that’s all, a rather rare one.”

“My assassination abilities?” She asked.

“To be specific, dao heart kill.” He casually said.

“You’re willing to teach me?” She asked again.

“I’ve taught you already.” To which he responded.

She hesitated for a second before replying: “I haven’t learned it.”

“As long as you stay alive, you will be able to use it since you have the right qualities.” He said.

She contemplated and thought that he must be right. He must have seen something in her and understood that she would be able to progress her assassination dao to the desired level - attacking with the dao heart.

Though she wasn’t an assassin, she couldn’t resist the temptation of this path, especially its apex.

“So that’s why you’re sparing me.” She understood why he fought the way he did as well - using dao heart kill three times against her.

Unfortunately, she didn’t understand it at all, let alone try to use it. Nonetheless, she was now an inheritor of this dao.

“The dao of murder and assassination, no need to worry about passing them down.” He glanced at the sky first before telling her: “This was a path necessary in the past. Now, it doesn’t have to be around anymore.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“But you still choose to pass it down.” She said.
