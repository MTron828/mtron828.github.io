Chapter 5459: Emotions Make Me Not

An eternity passed by in the blink of an eye. Nothing was worth remembering due to their ephemeral nature, whether it be invincible emperors, beautiful fairies, and unbeatable legends…

Even an apex cultivator was as insignificant as a speck of dust compared to the timeline in Li Qiye’s eyes, not worth a single coin.

Li Qiye’s existence robbed everyone of their confidence despite their indomitable dao heart. They finally had a taste of a long-forgotten sensation - fear.

Nonetheless, Supreme didn’t falter despite having a taste of fear. He made his move and summoned his sacred tree for a void thrust.

When people saw his colossal tree and special attack, they could see why he was unique and comparable to apex dao lords and conquerors.

He relied on his dao alone for his current achievements instead of despicable means.

“Clank!” His slash encompassed only the immaculate void, not any murderous affinity and the stench of blood.

However, he reserved something special for Li Qiye - adding emotions to his attack. It morphed from the void to having other affinities - the apex of his attack.

This was the first time spectators saw him using a more traditional sword technique. Of course, it differed from everything else since it had a void state prior to the transformation.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

His void was superior to all things, making it deadly. However, his manifested compassion could pierce the heart instantly.

After all, everyone had emotions since they were living beings, not rocks. Having emotions rendered one vulnerable to his thrust.

The mysterious scope of this dao exceeded the fundamentals of the sword. It entangled itself with earthly matters and took advantage of their weaknesses. Everyone saw the transformed thrust piercing Li Qiye’s heart.

“Emotions make me not.” They heard his voice and he no longer seemed to be there.

The blade pierced emotions, not Li Qiye since he had assumed a mysterious form. Perhaps this was the right way of using anima. Emotions and everything else weren’t the true self.

Everyone else became startled, his opponents and the prisoners from The People included. In this split second, they sensed something new with anima.

The apex cultivators have seen anima and embarked on the path toward everlasting life. However, how did Li Qiye assume a state of anime without activating his dao fruits or revealing his tree?

Each of them felt something different but one thing was for certain - they became slightly closer to anima. Was this the next level and true meaning of anima?

Due to their immense talent and comprehension, they instantly became enlightened just by watching him.

Alas, there was no time for some of them. Immortal Pagoda Conqueror thought that this was the right opportunity to attack.

Since Li Qiye changed his state to something strange in order to avoid Supreme’s incorporeal slash, perhaps he was weakened defensively.

“My turn!” Immortal Pagoda revealed his anima tree with only a single dao fruit. The latter was different from everyone else, looking larger and containing more dao profundities.

If a single dao fruit could contain a single supreme grand dao, this one could definitely contain many more.

“The primordial fruit.” Spectators were in awe to see it for the first time.

After all, few in history were fortunate enough to possess them. Moreover, they had entered the immortal continent long ago. Immortal Pagoda was the only one with this fruit in the upper continents.

One primordial fruit alone was enough for anyone, no need to obtain twelve.
