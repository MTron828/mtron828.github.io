Chapter 4589: Ask A True Immortal

The words erupted in their mind like thunder. True immortals were two characters that have been repeated many times.

Mortals used these characters to describe cultivators. As for regular cultivators themselves, they didn’t think much of it rather than it being a noun for someone mighty.

However, only those on the path of pursuing everlasting life understood its significance. “True immortal” represented the ultimate profundity and the end of the grand dao. In other words, all answers and goals desired by the world could be obtained here.

“True immortal.” The scion murmured quietly. He was very sensitive about these characters due to the old ancestors in his sect. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

His perspective and understanding of a true immortal far exceeded other cultivators.

“Then what do true immortals wish for?” This question flashed in the mortal king’s mind.

“Another unanswerable question because there are no true immortals in this world to answer you. They have to become true immortals first before thinking about their future goals.” Li Qiye shook his head.

He then stared at her and said: “It’s fine to think ahead while cultivating, even to the point of fantasizing. However, keep in mind that the grand dao starts beneath your feet, not in a sky castle.”

“I heed your warning.” The king took a deep breath and said.

“The dao, obtainable, derivable, and graspable…” Li Qiye was in a good mood today and decided to preach about the dao.

The group knew that this was a rare opportunity, perhaps once in a million years. This was the fortune of a lifetime. They erased all unnecessary thoughts and focused on the dao preach, nothing else.

During the learning process, the mortal king and the scion entered a state of zen and became radiant - a sign of comprehension. They clearly benefited more than the daoist or Jian Ming.

Li Qiye’s lecture was simple yet deep. Each word resonated like a dao bell in the listeners’ mind, waking them up from confusion. Each section was more beneficial than cultivating for ten thousand years.

Once he made it to the crucial parts, even the stars above started rotating in a beautiful manner. The youths became immersed in the mysteries of the grand dao and forgot their way home.

After a long while, Li Qiye closed his eyes and sat there, seemingly asleep. At the same time, the youths were still in a state of meditation. His lecture echoed in their mind.

The first to break out of this state was Firmament Mortal King. She prostrated on the ground and said: “I will never forget your guidance today. Each word is engraved in my heart.”

“Go, great things await you on the arduous dao path.” Li Qiye opened his eyes and smiled. He gently waved his hand.

“I understand.” The mortal king bowed sincerely one more time before disappearing into the horizon.

Another long period of time passed. Paramount Scion woke up and was ecstatic. He bowed deeply and said: “Thank you, Young Noble. I truly appreciate today. If you ever need me in the future, just say the word.”

“It is fate that brought us together today and for you to gain a fortune, go.” Li Qiye accepted the grand gesture and said.

The scion didn’t dare to linger around. He learned many things from the lecture and didn’t want to be greedy and overstay his welcome. He bowed once more before leaving.

After a long while, Jian Ming and the daoist finally woke up. Their talent was clearly inferior to the other two. This was especially true for the mortal king. Her comprehension was virtually matchless among the young generation.

“Gone already?” Jian Ming looked around and said: “They ran so fast. Sigh, I should have asked her more questions about her background. Maybe she’s really just a member of a mortal clan and a vagabond.”

“Ever seen a vagabond like her?” The daoist still didn’t buy it.

Jian Ming thought about it again and agreed with this assessment. The mortal king was excellent, whether it be her temperament, power, or dao comprehension.

She resembled a noble more than a vagabond who came from nothing. The latter couldn’t possibly have the same regal aura.

“Don’t put it that way, at least give people some hope.” Jian Ming said: “If she’s from a behemoth too like the other conquerors, then it would be quite a blow for the common men at the bottom of society. In the case of her being a vagabond and winning, it’ll be a far better outcome.”

He spoke as if his personality had changed completely and that he cared about regular cultivators.

“It’s not like there haven’t been dao lords who came from nothing before. I’m not sure if this motivation matters either, people won’t hear it and immediately put in the effort. They will only find success when already possessing a firm dao heart.” The daoist responded.

“Well said.” Li Qiye interjected.

“Thank you, it just came to me.” The daoist gloated.

“Please, you’re just a blind cat coming across a dead mouse. I, on the other hand, love stories like this and hope that it is true.” Jian Ming said.

“That might not be a good thing for her.” The daoist responded: “If she’s really a vagabond, the ancestors from the behemoths will put her at a disadvantage.”

“Can’t argue with that.” Jian Ming stroked his chin: “They won’t hold back or care about face, they’ll reveal their fox tail then.”

This has always been the case in history. The young competitors weren’t the only participants. Even their sects and races got involved, resulting in chaotic battles.

At that point, their individual skill was one thing but having the right dao protectors might be more important.

“If one must rely on dao protectors, they won’t become the dao lord regardless of their skills and talent.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “This path requires extensive training and comprehension. Next are life-or-death battles. Otherwise, the whole thing is meaningless.”
