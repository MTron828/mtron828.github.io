Chapter 3533: Apologies

The crowd remained silent, standing with both hands straight down and their head lowered.

The only one eligible to speak was Dragon King Commander. Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang could only wait aside just a junior waiting to be reprimanded. The others had to watch from a distance.

Meanwhile, those from the coalition trembled with fear. Anxiety struck them deep since they could only wait for a sentence from Li Qiye. They have offended Li Qiye so the result seemed rather obvious.

“Your Excellency.” The sovereign saw that Li Qiye and the commander had finished speaking and politely jumped in.

In the past, others tried their best just to have an opportunity to bow and greet him. Now, he had to stand waiting; this wasn’t easy in the slightest.

“You’re putting me in a difficult position by bowing.” Li Qiye chuckled at him.

“The young ones were foolish enough to offend you, Your Excellency, please do as you please.” The sovereign said with sincerity in a calm manner. He didn’t go around in circles nor beg for mercy.

He had lived long enough to know about Li Qiye. If this existence wanted to kill someone, asking for mercy was useless.

“We had no grievance between us, just the wrong time and place.” Li Qiye said.

The sovereign smiled wryly. He indeed had bad luck because he didn’t do anything to Li Qiye. His only fault was being Ancestral Realm’s successor. Alas, he had to watch his sect, Ancestral Realm, be destroyed by Li Qiye.

Now, he was a supreme ancestor but his descendants decided to provoke Li Qiye. He had no choice but to come out. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Seems like I’m very unlucky.” The sovereign said. He didn’t expect to face something so problematic after reaching this old age.

“As I’ve said, there is nothing between us. Since you have acted with respect, I won’t make it difficult for you. Tell me, what do you want?” Li Qiye said.

“Your Excellency, it is entirely up to you. It’s my fault for not educating them well.” The sovereign said.

He was prepared for the worst because nothing good would come from provoking Li Qiye. Even the strongest sects all ended with destruction.

Remember how powerful Soaring Immortal used to be? It still became dust. The Ancient Ming also dominated for eras. Where were they now?

His Yin Yang Gate had dominion over the north and could be considered a first-rate sect. However, they were still nothing compared to Soaring Immortal and the Ancient Ming.

The truth was that Li Qiye himself didn’t need to do anything. Just one message from him would summon numerous top existences to come and destroy Yin Yang Gate.

The disciples from Yin Yang heard their ancestor and lowered their head, not daring to utter a single word.

Resistance was futile because their strongest ancestor was accepting his fate, let alone juniors like them. They were nothing more than ants compared to Li Qiye.

“I suppose you’re stuck in the middle even though it is no fault of your own.” Li Qiye shook his head: “It would be unreasonable for me to kill you. As for the other juniors, I’ll spare them and leave it to you.”

Li Qiye was in a good mood after meeting an old friend and decided against a massacre.

“Bastard, hurry up and punish those fools as an apology to His Excellency. Don’t wait for someone else!” The commander shouted at the sovereign, seemingly using his connection to intimidate others.

However, he was actually doing the sovereign a favor. After all, they were from the same era; not many of them were left. The sovereign himself actually didn’t do anything wrong. His unfilial descendants simply poked the beehive so the commander helped him out by ending the issue here.

“Thank you, Your Excellency.” The sovereign lived long enough to recognize the situation and bowed towards Li Qiye.

“We’ll end it with this.” Li Qiye nodded and agreed with the commander’s suggestion.

The sovereign took a deep breath and turned around, staring straight at the five ancient ancestors.

“Ignorant fools, you have done something unforgivable and become the sinners of your sect. Apologize to His Excellency via suicide.” He coldly uttered.

The five exchanged glances. They have already prepared for death but were still shaken when truly facing it.

This was already a great result. They would be able to protect their sect by dying - the most merciful outcome for Yin Yang, Skylight, and Firmaments.

“Everyone has to die. Your Excellency, my mistake. I’ll be going now.” Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign bowed his head towards Li Qiye and laughed loudly.

“Clank!” He raised his sword and decapitated himself. Blood gushed out as his body fell to the ground.

“Your descendant has failed you, Ancestor. Farewell, may Yin Yang Gate prosper.” The Celestial Trinity bowed towards the sovereign first then Li Qiye: “Your Excellency, we humbly apologize.”

“Boom!” They destroyed their meridians and true fate, causing their body to tremble and blood to drip out of the corner of their mouth. They then fell to the ground, lifeless.

“This is it, I hope future descendants won’t make the same mistake. My fault, Your Excellency.” Azure Dragon King got on his knees before also destroying his true fate.

The five ancient ancestors committed suicide in order to protect their sect.

Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang didn’t say anything and watched with a cold expression. In his opinion, this was already the slightest punishment. He knew that it would take zero effort from Li Qiye to destroy the three sects. Li Qiye was being immensely merciful already.

“Your Excellency.” The sovereign then turned back to Li Qiye.

“Go, cherish the time that you have left.” Li Qiye waved his hand and said while dropping the issue with his opponents.

“Thank you, Your Excellency. May you live forever.” The sovereign bowed.

“Scram already!” He then turned towards the armies and shouted before leaving.

The members of the armies left quietly with great dejection. They didn’t dare to turn around once.

When they got here, they were domineering and in high spirits, confident in destroying Ancestral City. Who would have thought that they end up running like dogs without their master?

They would all be dead now if it wasn’t for their forefather coming out to ask for forgiveness. No one expected this outcome at the start.
