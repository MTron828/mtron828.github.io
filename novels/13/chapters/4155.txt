Chapter 4156: Dark Gale Camp’s Arrival

“Buzz.” Another violent shaking and bright flashes stole everyone’s attention on the other side.

The battle at Black Dragon Island was coming to an end as well. Jian Sanqiang hovered up high in the air while pulling back the bowstring to its limit. Thousands of divine arrows appeared behind him and looked like a pair of angel wings on fire.

This suffocated the crowd because they knew that it could pierce through heaven and earth.

“Whoosh!” Sure enough, the main arrow traveled with incredible speed. Even the mind couldn’t follow the arrow, let alone the eyes.

Spectators felt as if they had been separated from time and space, going half a beat slower.

This successfully destroyed Eight-hundred Commander’s shield, prompting its master to scream.

“Ah!!!” Blood gushed across the night sky and the commander’s huge frame flew for a bit before crashing on the ground.

His eyes were wide open, not ready for death. He thought that he would be the victor but Jian Sanqiang’s power exceeded his expectations. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I won the gamble, mission accomplished.” Sanqiang wiped off the blood on his lips and laughed. He looked to be in a sorry state with gnarly wounds.

He risked his life this time in order to kill the commander and rid his clan of an evil member.

“Formation shift!” Tie Jian ordered.

“Clank!” The layers and curtains of swords around the island opened and went on the offensive instead.

This shift inflicted serious damage to the attacking bandits. Thousands of them died in just a short time with numerous holes on their body.

The experts near there took a deep breath after seeing the sudden boost in killing potential.

“This formation definitely came from a dao lord.” One of them said, noting that despite the slaughtering nature of the deed, there was still a noble and majestic divinity fully displayed in the formation.

Nonetheless, the formation was purposely changed by someone. Its true mysteries were hidden so it became difficult to pinpoint the source.

“I think the bandits are going to have a rough future ahead of them.” One ancestor said: “They lost many men already, even Eight-hundred Commander died in battle. Their plan is finished and they’re at a grave disadvantage now.”

A while ago, the bandits had the upper hand due to their number advantage. Moreover, this was their home court as well. Alas, losing this battle in such a drastic manner changed everything. Their morale must be at an all-time low.

“Li Qiye’s followers are unreal, they’re all hidden masters. There aren’t many sects in our continent capable of preparing this sword formation.” A last-gen master was jealous.

“One can hire gods and devils with enough money, let alone experts.” A youth said.

“Boom!” Suddenly, loud explosions came from the distance. Violent gales caused high waves to form.

The waves then became high enough to be classified as a tsunami affecting the entire lake.

“What’s going on?!” The crowd shouted in astonishment. They then noticed banners on top of the waves. A cavalry was coming.

A murderous aura akin to millions of blades made them shudder. This cavalry wore black armor with a shiny luster. They seemed to be coming from hell itself. Their fluttering banners were entirely black as well.

As they rode the waves, they looked like a gigantic tornado sweeping through the world.

“Dark Gale!” An older expert recognized them right away.

“The troops of Dark Gale are here!” Others joined in.

Dark Gale Camp was the true leader and owner of Cloud Dream Lake. Though the lake had eighteen islands run by lawless bandits, in reality, the place had a special order and a set of rules. These rules were written by Dark Gale Camp.

The bandits’ morale rose again after seeing this cavalry. They became confident in defeating the enemy.

“This cavalry can match any other legion.” Cultivators took a deep breath after seeing their awe-inspiring arrival.

Their strength and bloodthirst weren’t an act. This cavalry was clearly battle-hardened.
