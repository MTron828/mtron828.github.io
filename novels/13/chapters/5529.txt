Chapter 5530: Stupid Enough

“So it’s a deal?” She winked at him.

“I suppose time is running out and it’s time to make preparations. Why not?” He said.

“I knew that you would agree.” She didn’t let go of his arm while acting shy.

“Shall we get started?” His eyes became profound as he stared at the sky, capable of seeing the deepest reaches. Something seemed to be waiting there.

“Hmm, we need a bit more time, don’t you as well?” Her voice was grating despite her best attempt to be alluring.

“I’m not in a hurry, I can wait until spring to plant a few more seeds.” He looked around and said.

“Lil’ Bro, let me remind you again. Good or bad, all will be swept away without discrimination.” She said with a rare serious tone.

“That’s why I need the connection, hence our negotiation.” He nodded in response.

“You don’t know the word ‘compromise’ at all.” She complained.

“Because I’m not the one asking. I’m only doing this out of kindness.” He said.

“Not necessarily if something unexpected happens, you might be very busy then.” She replied.

“Something unexpected? Perhaps I’ll stab someone in the back, that’ll change the winner entirely while still getting rid of the pests.” He smiled.

“But you’re not that type of person.” She reverted back to her flirty demeanor.

“I might not be a person then.” He responded.

“You’re such a naughty boy.” She pouted again.

“Because of this, things will change and become unpredictable. Hard choices will be made.” He said.

“I trust you, you’re not a backstabber.” Her eyes brimmed with resolution.

“Why the vote of confidence?” He asked.

“If you wanted to do backstab, you wouldn’t be talking to me right now. Your path would have been different, similar to the others.” She said.

“That is true.” He nodded: “Backstabbing doesn’t mean anything, it’s only a matter of winning or losing, that is not my pursuit.”

“Hence my trust in you.” She said.

“And because of this, I’m the only choice. You only have one opportunity as well.” He said.

“I don’t know if I would make such an absolute statement. My father has many methods, you know this.” She responded.

“Indeed, when there is enough time. But now, time is not on his side. This vast world has yet to be thoroughly examined. How much time would that take?” Li Qiye said.

He paused for a moment before continuing: “If I guess correctly, the entry to the world is yet to be finished.”

“How should I respond? I am not sure either.” She said.

“You know the answer. A reckless endavor is fast but forging an avatar for this goal doesn’t happen so quickly.” He smiled.

“Isn’t this better for you? You have more time.” She said.

“Unfortunately, I have no plan of replacing anyone or it would be a decent opportunity. Of course, the reason for your sweep is because this is an opportunity for others as well.” He said.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“When will you be ready?” She asked curiously.

“The time will come, your father is preparing as well.” He said.

“My father is always prepared.” She said.

“Is that so? If he were prepared, why are you here to discuss this matter with me?” He smirked.

“Lil’ Bro, there’s no need to expose everything.” She pouted.

He smiled and gazed into the horizon. After a while, he asked: “Haven’t you thought about that when I agree, your mission will be over?”

The smile on her face disappeared and time came to a stop.

“You’ll be returning afterward, who will you be then?” He stared at her and asked.

She took a deep breath and assumed a dignified demeanor. Beneath her unattractive shell was a peerless fairy.

“I will be who I am, when the time comes, it will naturally come to an end.” She said earnestly.

“How does it feel to know this?” He asked.

“You’ve done it before, you tell me.” She responded.

“Pain, but I would do it again.” He said.

“It’s good that you feel that way, you’re still yourself.” She said.

“And you?” He asked.

“The same for me, I will still be me.” She stared upward and said.

“I see.” He gently nodded and said: “This world is worth taking a look at despite its many flaws.”

She gently touched his face and said: “You’re an idiot, stupid enough to invoke sympathy.”

“That’s a good thing. Don’t sympathize with me though, it’s a mission.” He said.

“And my mission shall be over soon.” She said.

The carriage slowly came to a halt. She didn’t say anything and only gazed outside.

“I’m getting off now.” He said.

She shifted her focus back to him and nodded: “Yes.”

He stood up and she grabbed his arm with sincerity this time.

“This is our mission.” He smiled.

“Yes.” She nodded.

He jumped down the carriage and said: “The mortal world, no matter how ugly it is, still has many good aspects.”

“And you’re part of it.” She smiled.

“Is that a praise or an insult?” He asked.

“I’m praising you.” Her smile looked gorgeous at this moment despite her current shell.

“You are beautiful.” He said.

She jumped down to embrace him; her plumb body felt as light as a swallow.

“Goodbye, handsome.” She said softly.

“Goodbye forever.” He hugged her back and nodded.

“Right, goodbye forever.” She kissed him on the forehead before jumping back into the carriage.

The carriage started flying into the horizon.

“Don’t forget that you have a wife named A’jiao.” Her voice came from above as the carriage leaped into the high heaven.

“Boom!” It surged upward into a place unreachable by any existence. Golden particles scattered downward and people could see a supreme world for a split second.

Li Qiye sighed sentimentally after her departure.
