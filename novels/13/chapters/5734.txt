Chapter 5735: Ultimate Blood

Demon’s comment left everyone frozen since it was far from an attempt at blustering. The mighty members of Celestial Court felt suffocated after hearing this legendary title.

Anyone else claiming to destroy Celestial Court would be chastised and suppressed by them. Alas, Sacred Teacher was a different story.

He also gave them a reminder by destroying the supreme machine created by Resolute and the others.

“It’s been a while since I had the pleasure of meeting Sacred Teacher.” Sword Emperor said.

“Since we’re all here, let’s fight first and talk later.” Calamity Dao Lord stepped forward, having lost patience.

No one had an issue with this since it was far from being their first fight.

“Come, who dares fight me?” Calamity challenged, thinking that civility was unnecessary at this point.

“I will, Fellow Daoist.” Resolute Conqueror seemed to have recovered after the near-death experience several days ago.

“Good, have a taste of my shell!” Calamity shouted and threw his shell at Resolute, crushing space along the way while wielding the force of a colossal planet.

“Not bad!” Resolute raised both hands to stop the shell directly.

“Bam!” It felt as if two planets had just collided. Fiery sparks splashed everywhere.

“Who shall be my opponent?” Immortal Emperor Fu Mo also sought a challenger.

“Bam!” He landed on a floating continent nearby and pinned his staff to the ground, creating a huge crater. There seemed to be countless devils imprisoned within his body.

“Your title once resounded across the nine worlds.” An Immortal Emperor with a unique earth-blood affinity appeared to be his opponent.

“Let’s see what your blood can do!” Fu Mo immediately activated his devil-subduing staff and extended it to the size of a mountain range.

“What’s the rush, Dao Brother?” Chen Xue’s weapon of choice was a daoist horsetail whisk. As he waved it back and forth, he could affect the direction of three thousand worlds. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The staff unleashed devastating destruction while the whisk appeared silent. Nonetheless, the strands sealed the area and formed a silvery net. They coiled around the staff and stopped the attack without making a single noise.

Chen Xue then went on the offensive, commanding the strands to pierce Fu Mo’s chest with the speed of lightning bolts.

“Armor!” Fu Mo roared and adorned a devil-subduing carapace.

Meanwhile, Immortal Emperor Zhuo Huo stepped forward with flames radiating from him.

“Long time no see, Dao Brother.” He challenged Immortal Emperor Chi Ye on the other side.

The two were rivals during Grand Dao War and had fought several times. Today was another opportunity to settle the score.

“As you wish.” Chi Ye obliged and left the formation.

Darkness took over as his power infiltrated the expanse. He was the sole light among the darkness.

He was the founder of Crimson Night Kingdom in the nine worlds and the ancestor of Immortal Emperor Chen Xue. The two of them were fortunate enough to be on the same side after ascending.

A flame blossomed in his hand amidst the darkness before being commanded to float toward the enemy.

It wasn’t an imperial or dao flame, just a crimson light causing sizzles in the air. Space was being melted like snow coming into contact with a hot branding iron. It didn’t have a scorching heat either yet possessed the same effect as a flame.

“Come!” Zhuo Huo propelled his imperial flame to meet the incoming crimson light.

Space melted again, this time due to the unbearable temperature. It could instantly melt dao laws and imperial weapons.

“Boom!” They collided like two planets and heat waves pulsed outward.

“To battle!” Meanwhile, Demon gave the order.

“March!” Sword Emperor commanded.

The gongs of war echoed thunderously as the commanders and soldiers roared for battle.

“Let’s do this!” Imperial-level characters activated their arts and aimed for foes whom they couldn’t kill in the previous war.
