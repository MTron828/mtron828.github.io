Chapter 5705: Orders Must Be Carried Out

“Boom!” A heavenly expanse appeared above the vast Thousand Emperor Island, allowing majestic figures and armies to warp into the region.

“Celestial Court’s armies!” The island inhabitants became alarmed.

The horns of war echoed across the countless islands of Imperial Field next.

“We’re being invaded! It’s Celestial Court!” Warnings could be heard everywhere.

Massive barriers and imperial auras appeared around the islands, culminating in a grand momentum.

During Grand Dao War, South Emperor and the others created this momentum in preparation for war.

Cultivators refrained from panicking and entered the grand momentum. They already knew this would happen after Immortal Emperor Hao Hai’s warning.

“Boom!” A celestial beam transported the commander of the armies - Resolute Conqueror. He resembled an unsurpassable mountain - someone who would never lose in battle.

He had returned to Imperial Field once more to wage another war.

“Resolute Conqueror!” The important figure of Imperial Field became alarmed to see him first.

“Fellow Daoist Resolute.” Demon Conqueror appeared again in the sky, serving as a role model for other combatants. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Fellow Daoist, another return?” Demon said: “Was the previous defeat insufficient?”

Resolute’s eyes narrowed, the same for his commanders and soldiers. Survivors did not forget the casualties suffered.

Alas, the full force of Celestial Court couldn’t take down Imperial Field, let alone make it to High Heaven Aegis. In the end, they returned empty-handed - an obvious defeat.

Resolute was one of the generals then so he was no stranger to the result.

“Orders must be carried out. Today, we demand the release of our esteemed guest. Do so and we shall leave.” Resolute said.

Eyes turned toward Demon after hearing this. Everyone was aware of how the empress and her allies took down Celestial Court’s mysterious guest. However, no retribution came afterward.

Thus, was the guest still alive and only imprisoned? This revelation surprised everyone on the islands.

“Unfortunately, that’s up to us, not you.” Demon retorted.

“Looks like we will have to fight to the death then.” Resolute said with a smile.

“Celestial Court’s destruction is inevitable.” Demon said.

“Don’t be so sure.” An ancient voice answered her instead.

A flame started flickering and caused a rapid rise in temperature throughout Imperial Field. This intense heat could cause the ocean to evaporate. If it touched any emperor or monarch, it could potentially reduce them to ashes in an instant.

“Pop!” An old man appeared and floated in the air in a meditating position. Upon closer inspection, he and the flame seemed to be one since he didn’t possess a physical body.

This was an imperial flame from a distant world, gestated by all of its powers.

“Immortal Emperor Zhuo Huo!” Many were surprised to see him: “Just as old as Immortal Emperor Hao Hai.”

He came from the nine worlds and made his mark with an incredible imperial flame. He maintained this ethereal form all of this time - seemingly inextinguishable.

He wasn’t the strongest or the most brilliant emperor during the previous epoch. However, his fiery form seemed to be eternal.

He lived long enough to surpass many others, eventually reaching the apex level. Those more gifted than him failed to reach this point.

His appearance was a signal of Celestial Court’s willingness to win.

“A supreme treasure such as Celestial Court will never be destroyed.” He remarked.

“Does your arrogance come from the belief that you’re unkillable? Today, feel free to march with your emperors and soldiers. Imperial Field is ready.” Demon answered.

In reality, Imperial Field was just as monstrous and had been preparing for an all-out war. Did Celestial Court have a special strategy in mind for this second attempt?

“Imperial Field is no longer the same. Where is South Emperor? And Chi Ye?” Resolute said.
