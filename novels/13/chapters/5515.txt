Chapter 5516: Still Underestimated

“Have you ever thought that there might not be a hidden secret at all in this manor?” Li Qiye asked.

“No secret?” The goddess and Qin Baifeng didn’t expect this answer, the same for the rest of the disciples.

This has been passed down for eras now but none had been able to find it.

“What kind of secret do you think it is?” Li Qiye smiled.

The group started ruminating. One legend mentioned an invincible weapon from the previous epoch that had been in the hands of an immortal.

Another brought up a potential connection with the immortal artifact. Figuring out this secret meant gaining control over it just like Cloudsweep Fairy back then.

The third account stated that it was a personal matter relating to the fairy’s background and origin. Although she was the spiritual totem of the sect, everyone knew that she came from Eight Desolaces and chose to save them, nothing more. Of course, this wasn’t particularly important either.

“Whatever it may be, I know that only you can figure it out, Young Noble.” The goddess smiled.

Li Qiye sighed and nodded before speaking: “Fate indeed, perhaps it is time to end this thread.”

Having said that, he whistled and produced a unique melody with a special rhythm.

“Buzz.” A white cloud flew out of the painting and landed before him to everyone’s astonishment.

In history, members of Sunset Glow have researched the manor extensively. They paid special attention to every inch of land, this painting included. No matter how many times they tried, they didn’t notice anything peculiar about this ordinary painting.

Nonetheless, it became obvious to everyone that the long-awaited secret was hidden in this painting. Activation required knowledge of how to whistle properly to summon this cloud, not a technique or dao.

Moreover, how did this cloud fly out? Was everything in the painting “alive”?

“I’ve still underestimated his connection.” The goddess murmured.

Li Qiye sat on the cloud and it took him into the painting before anyone could react. They rushed over and could see him in the painting as well.

“This is a thing?” Qin Baifeng thought that this was magical.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“He’s the one our ancestor has been waiting for, that’s why he can open this secret.” The goddess sighed.

The painting captivated the crowd. How could a living person enter the painting? This idea had never crossed their mind before but alas, it was actually happening.

A single white cloud drifted amidst the azure sky. The gentle breeze carried a faint scent of grass - the first sign of spring.

The sunlight soothed the soul on this plain. One could lie on the grass and take perhaps the best nap in their life.

Alas, this seemed to have been unchanging for eras now, resulting in a feeling of loneliness. Although this place was full of life, only one person was here to enjoy it.

Fortunately, she wasn’t entirely alone due to the presence of a cloud. Today, it had brought back a friend for her.

She stood there patiently while wearing a plain dress, looking like a villager. Her hair was tied up by a single wooden hairpin and she had no makeup on. Nonetheless, her simplicity only accentuated her charm.

She sensed Li Qiye’s arrival and slowly turned around. Her face invoked a feeling of awe since she contained a special spirituality and purity that could seep into the heart. It also displayed her unswerving determination regardless of any potential challenges.
