The girl had conflicted feelings about hearing this - a natural response for most women regarding their appearance. She gave him the side-eye before looking down again.

Li Qiye withdrew his hand and gave an order: “Jiadi, I like this girl. Leave her one million to buy some clothes.”

Jiadi immediately threw a spatial pouch on the table before leaving with Li Qiye.

Yingjian and Untie Tie were slack-jawed - spending one million just like that? In their clan, even the direct successors there couldn’t be so wasteful. This guy was a god-tier wastrel.

He was already long gone after she calmed down. She didn’t have the courage to give chase, still afraid of him. She stood there, confused, not knowing what to do.

After leaving the force, Jiadi smiled and asked Li Qiye: “Your Highness, she’s not a bad girl, how come you didn’t take her in?”

“Why should I?” Li Qiye smiled: “I have no lack of women. A good girl is very rare, and only thinking about sleeping with one is the act of a vulgar man.”

Jiadi replied: “So you like her that much, Your Highness?” He had grown used to Li Qiye’s amiability when they were alone.

It was completely different than being around Lucidity. Though people called him the Chaos Hellion and considered him to be the worst scum, Jiadi didn’t think he was that bad. At the very worst, the guy was just a whimsical spender.

As for Lucidity, being around him meant being nervous all the time. His fury could end in decapitation for anyone. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“There are many types of like, not necessarily romantic. Some are just a type of appreciation.” Li Qiye said.

Jiadi nodded and didn’t pursue the topic.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a divine light soared to the sky from the imperial palace. It separated the clouds and illuminated the entire area.

A majestic divinity engulfed the world, seemingly wanting to drown the entire system. The experts all over Imperial were alarmed.

“Buzz.” The pillar of light suddenly lost all power, akin to a spring gushing out water before running dry. The leftover water sprinkled down, or in this case, just tiny strands of light that scatter with the wind.

It seemed like a rain of light all over Nine Secrets, resulting in a surreal scene.

“Buzz.” Next, a fiery spark came from the palace. If the palace itself was a candle, then this light was it being lit up.

Unfortunately, this was a candle in the wind, feeble and flickering - on the verge of extinguishing. It pulsed continuously from dark to bright in an uncertain manner.

“Not good.” Jiadi was shocked: “His Majesty is deteriorating, we must return now, Your Highness.” Having said that, he grabbed Li Qiye and rushed for the palace.

At this moment, all eyes in Imperial were focused on the flickering light. They knew that Lucidity couldn’t last any longer. This was his final moment.

“Whoosh!” When Jiadi and Li Qiye finally made it back, the light suddenly shattered and disappeared.

The palace fell into darkness; Nine Secrets have lost its light.

“His Majesty has passed away!” Jiadi shouted: “Your Majesty...”

He continued carrying Li Qiye towards Lucidity’s resting chambers.

Once they made it in, they saw Lucidity on his bed, no longer breathing. The servants were on their knees.

Only Sun Lengying sat by the bed while holding the slumbering king’s hand, tears running down his cheeks.

“Your Majesty!” Jiadi instantly prostrated on the ground.

This sad emotion came from the heart. Lucidity was a second father to him so he became broken-hearted.

The palace grieved, seemingly engulfed in a terrible mood.

“His Majesty has passed away!” After a long while, an official order finally came.

The palaces and buildings in the imperial palace had a white cloth hanging on the front entrance. It didn’t take long before the entire place was filled with white, similar to the snowflakes in winter - a world of white.

People were still shaken despite knowing the inevitability of his death. The moment still caught them off guard. Anxiety and grief permeated the situation, especially for the servants. They didn’t know what to do, akin to rootless duckweeds.

The extinguishing of his light made many pairs of eyes light up all over Nine Secrets, similar to divine lamps being lit in the dark.

The seniors from the various powers and the five supreme ancestors became stirred.

“Lucidity King is finally dead.” One Eternal from a powerful lineage said.

“A storm is coming.” A supreme ancestor had a happy expression and excitement in his eyes.

“This day is finally here!” Another peer of his smiled.

One more had his eyes flashing with a cold glint: “A new era should come to Nine Secrets now.”

This was a godsend opportunity just like a pie falling from the sky.

War Saint Dynasty has lost its leader and the entire system was a headless snake. It meant turmoil and changes, or opportunities for others.

These supreme ancestors knew that it was over for War Saint Dynasty. It didn’t matter that he had appointed a crown prince because this person couldn’t suppress all of Nine Secrets.

Moreover, Lucidity had also defeated the Sacred Cabinet. Without this council, War Saint was without its skeletal structure and needed to rely on Lucidity as the single pillar. Now, without him, demise was coming for this dynasty.

“Lucidity King has passed away.” Many ancient clans and sects have received this news.

These masters became emotional just like the rest. They have gotten used to his tyranny in the last three generations.

This authority was no longer present. A new leader was about to emerge for Nine Secrets.

The news of his death quickly spread to the other systems in Imperial as well.

The two other behemoths, the Mu and Li, were the happiest to hear about it. Lucidity played a pivotal role in Nine Secrets’ success.

With his death, this behemoth has fallen. Many other ferocious beasts and birds would want to come and share this fat piece of meat.

“It’s about time.” Two True Emperors took note of this. Their gazes searched around Nine Secrets.

Even beings of their level didn’t dare to do anything when Lucidity was around. This was no longer the case - Nine Secrets was now up for grabs.

“Crown Prince Li Qiye shall assume the title of King!” An order left behind by Lucidity emanated from the palace.

His awe-inspiring and mighty voice along with his majestic aura of an Eternal filled the world.

The system still trembled in fear after hearing the order. He might be dead but his notoriety remained. People were still afraid all the same.

“Crown Prince Li Qiye?” Confusion naturally sparked.

“Who is Li Qiye?” The leaders of various powers found this surprising. They have never heard of this name before. In fact, they didn’t even know that Lucidity had appointed a crown prince.
