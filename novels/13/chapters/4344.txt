The majority of disciples from Dragon were either killed or grievously injured. The fallen combatants were devoured by the dark creature.

Jian Qingzhu could stand idle no longer and wanted to join the battle. Alas, Chi Jinlin stopped her and shook his head: “Miss Jian, you will only be throwing your life away needlessly, unable to change anything.”

She stopped and contemplated before asking: “Your Highness, what do you think this is?”

“I do not dare to speculate due to my shallow knowledge.” Jinlin gazed at the monstrosity and said: “Perhaps it is related to the legend back then, a remnant of the fallen darkness.”

Jinlin’s guess was correct. This was indeed a remnant of a darkness entity that had descended during the calamity. Though Heavenguard managed to kill the original entity, it was too powerful with tenacious lifeforce. It certainly died but certain things still remained.

They were pushed below ground from the explosions but the strands still remained. This was a reason why the spirit soldiers couldn’t move on. They stayed here with mighty treasures in order to suppress the darkness.

As the years went by, they were gradually corroded by the darkness. It wasn’t until Li Qiye’s purification process that they were freed. Nonetheless, this also freed the darkness from suppression as well.

Now that they were out, they just needed to devour life and vitality. Once they had enough, they could even return to their initial state of invincibility.

“Ahhh!” Members of Dragon and the greedy bunch were massacred by the darkness.

“Run!” The lucky survivors were scared out of their mind and fled with all of their might. Some pissed their pants and felt their legs trembling, unable to flee.

“Die!” The young lord of Dragon kept on fighting. Dragons coiled around him while he glowed brilliantly with his sovereign aura.

He managed to repel the dark creatures nearby and forced them to the ground. He displayed combat prowess worthy of his status.

The spectators in the distance were impressed by his power.

“Not bad at all.” Chi Jinlin saw his abilities and nodded approvingly.

“Raa!” The largest creature roared and became engulfed in a dark radiance.

The creatures hunting everyone were suddenly summoned and flew back towards their largest brethren.

The monstrosity became colossal; its claws could even reach the celestials above. The surface of the lake only reached where the ankles would be if it had them.

Everyone gasped after seeing its size and billowing aura.

“Raa!” It raised one claw and released dark laws. Buzzing runes appeared around the young lord and immediately sealed him.

Next, darkness rushed towards it, ready for the devouring.

“Activate!” The young lord looked up at the sky and roared. He sent draconic energies outward; dragons danced and roared against the incoming darkness.

This was proven to be futile. Even his strongest arts and heirlooms were eaten by the darkness.

The dragons protecting him were immobilized at first then turned into dark dragons. They began attacking him instead.

“Nooo!” In this crucial moment, he felt the darkness latching onto him and sucking his lifeforce and vitality at a rapid rate.

“He’s finished…” A spectator couldn’t believe it.

“Open!” The young lord crazily shouted, prompting a crack to appear on his forehead.

A blinding light rushed out, capable of splitting heaven and earth. Spectators couldn’t keep their eyes open.

“What is that?!” They closed their eyes and were astounded.

“Boom!” His power erupted by tenfold. A tsunami of energy rushed out and destroyed the darkness corroding him.

The seal was destroyed as well while the dark monstrosity staggered several steps backward from the blow.

Once people could see again, they saw a majestic figure made out of light standing behind the young lord. The latter was bathed and protected by the light, making him look like a child of god. His eyes brimmed with fiery divinity.

This light had five colors, looking as holy and sacred as can be. It resembled a peacock spreading its tail, treating the sky as its canvas.

The aura of this being crushed the area. Not to mention those from the small sects, even disciples from the great powers were forced down on their knees.

“Sect Master!” Jian Qingzhu cried out.

“Dragon Sect Master, Peacock Monarch!” Some survivors prostrated before this being.

Even Chi Jinlin let out a sentimental sigh after seeing this. Peacock Monarch’s prestige was at an all-time high right now.

Though Sky Border had countless hidden masters, Peacock Monarch still stood out in the current generation.

Some even believed that he was stronger than the ancestors of Dragon.

Normally, the sect masters and kings of the behemoths weren’t their strongest characters. Their real ace cards were the slumbering ancestors.

Dragon, being one of the strongest sects in the south, naturally had powerful ancestors as well. Nonetheless, Peacock Monarch was not inferior to them.
