Chapter 5442: Cornered Dogs

“How can we survive?” She said with a worrying tone.

“So, so difficult.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Nonetheless, the villainous heaven has its own concerns because it’s already very close.”

“Can we force the issue?” She asked.

“No, that’s rather suicidal. If that was an option, it would have been done long ago.” Li Qiye said.

“I suppose we must prepare fortresses then. The rest are doing so as well.” She said.

“It’s necessary, they believe that as long as they can last enough, everything will ebb away eventually. It’s a matter of endurance.” He said.

“And if we seize the initiative and attack first?” She asked.

“The question is who should we strike first and when? If we eliminate some, maybe the calamity will be delayed.”

“Hmm…” She pondered in silence.

“This is easier said than done, not to mention both choices being deviations from the original plan.” Li Qiye said.

“Is there still time to change course?” She asked.

“All of this need time for planning but time isn’t waiting for us. Moreover, they won’t be sitting still and might go all out.” Li Qiye said.

“Right, and they hide so well. We can’t catch them unless they make the first move.” She said.

“That’s why the villainous heaven has to intervene.” Li Qiye said.

“Do you think there is a chance of them descending and making the first move?” She asked.

“Some certainly harbor this idea. Someone was here before you came.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s true. Are they changing their plan? Starting from the bottom instead.” Her expression became serious.

“Hard to say, it might just be a scouting mission or to look for an answer as well in this world.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Is it an attempt to retreat? I don’t think that’s viable.” She said.

“Definitely not viable in the past, but he came up with a method. It’s just that the world isn’t aware of it yet but this is not important right now. Time is running out for them.” Li Qiye nodded.

“They’re cornered dogs.” She commented.

“Yes, they’ll be jumping the wall and will start biting.” He said.

“Who first?” She asked.

“The first is definitely me since I’m the roadblock. But if they can’t make it past, it’ll be the villainous heaven. If they will die either way, might as well go all out once.” He smiled.

“I don’t think they’re that desperate yet according to our research. Some of them have walls tall enough to potentially outlast it.” She said.

“Not everyone and most importantly, since the villainous heaven will be personally taking part, no one truly knows the extent of this challenge. Only the actual survivors will be able to make this claim about their walls.” Li Qiye shook his head: “This applies to your wall as well.”

“Mmm…” She smiled wryly and said: “I’m losing my confidence now after listening to you, Young Master.”

“This is why spreading out is a good strategy. Delay with enough walls and there will be an opportunity. If everyone is gathered in one place, the firepower will be concentrated in a single spot. Failure means death to all but with our plan, some will manage to slip past the net since the villainous heaven has specific targets in mind this time.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“I’m afraid of the eventual casualties.” She said.

“Don’t be afraid of death after getting this far. It is inevitable.” Li Qiye said.

“You’re right, no one can escape death.” She paused for a moment before adding: “I can’t wait to see you up above the heaven.”

“That day will come.” He sighed and said: “Opportunities will present themselves, I have to grasp the correct one.”

“What is your strategy for this, Young Master?” She couldn’t help but ask.

Li Qiye gazed at the deepest crevices of the sky and said: “My dao will be spreading in there, culminating in a direct break.”

“But that’s impossible.” She became emotional.

“Yes, but that’s in the past. A transaction has been requested.” He said.

“They came to you already?” She didn’t expect this.

“Yes, still within expectations.” He nodded.

“This isn’t your pursuit.” She said: “It’ll be a compromise.”

“I’ve thought about this very carefully even before you got here.” He nodded: “How long do you think you’ll be able to last during the calamity?”

“Hmm…” She took her time because this calamity would exceed everyone’s imagination.

“Remember, the villainous heaven will personally carry this out.” He said: “The goals are a few tigers, not your group, but the shockwaves alone will obliterate the strongest fortresses.”

“We have not forgotten your warnings back then.” She said.

“Yet here we are, all of you are having issues already.” He said.

“I apologize for our lack of abilities.” She smiled wryly.

“I wouldn’t put it that way. How long have you been cultivating versus them? They all want that piece of pie, definitely not wanting to share with some newcomers. Not making a move is already showing restraint.” He said.

“I suppose we should thank the villainous heaven for not allowing it.” She said.

“That’s the past. If it really comes to that point, permission no longer matters and they won’t hold back.” He said.

“Enemies on all fronts then.” She said.

“That’s why it’s time to offer them some benefits or it’ll all be in vain.” He nodded.

“Young Master, are you acquiescing because of us?” She asked softly.

“It’s not that.” He smiled: “You all have done enough and plus, if I don’t do it, someone else might. I might as well be the one.”

“I wish we could be stronger.” She held his hand and said.

“Don’t dwell on these minor details. Just be prepared to face what lies ahead, I have done what I can.” He said.

“Yes, we have to walk our own path eventually.” She said.

“That is the reason for our quest, so that everyone can walk their own path.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I will return and strengthen our wall.” She said earnestly.

“I believe in you, just be wary of all the pits.” He nodded confidently.
