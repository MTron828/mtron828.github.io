Chapter 5187: Letting The Founder Down

“Really?” The monarch remained skeptical since this was his first time hearing about this phenomenon. Nonetheless, he agreed with the rationale.

“Hmph, he has no evidence, it’s a ridiculous claim.” The saint child scowled.

“We’ll find out by digging it up.” Li Qiye yawned.

The others didn’t dare to speak due to the gravity of the situation. There was a high chance of the plant withering after removal.

Their sect master sorely needed it for her next batch of medicines. Losing it now meant delaying the cauldron refinement indefinitely.

“That’s fine, don’t dig it up. Just wait for the flame-worms to mature completely, the plant will be burned anyway for their rite of passage.” Li Qiye added with a smile.

“I believe you, Young Noble.” The saintess stood by his side and said: “Junior Uncle, I agree with digging up the phoenix’s crest. This gives us a chance to save it, not to mention protect the entire garden from further losses.”

“This is a one-sided speculation. If he is wrong, who will take responsibility for the uprooted phoenix’s crest?” The saint child said.

“I will.” The saintess had complete confidence in Li Qiye: “I trust the young noble so if it turns out to be false, I will take responsibility and tell my master.”

The saint child had no response since he actually preferred this development. If Li Qiye were wrong, then his rival would definitely lose the competition for committing this careless mistake.

“Junior Uncle, I will take responsibility.” She repeated firmly.

“Very well, dig it up then.” The monarch took a deep breath and agreed. Digging it up might kill the plant but if the guy were right, the entire garden was in danger.

Nearby disciples heard this and followed their command. They carefully dug up the plant with the monarch standing nearby. The saintess also gave them meticulous pointers on how to do it correctly.

“Zzz.” The moment the roots were finally taken out of the ground, fiery strands could be seen.

“It’s true!” The saintess exclaimed.

“Seems so.” The monarch couldn’t believe that Li Qiye was right.

“Watch out now.” Li Qiye warned.

“Seal!” The monarch was already prepared to deal with the flames and summoned a cauldron. It expanded and resembled an ocean ready to devour the flames.

“Boom!” A strange worm rushed to the sky and sent it flying. It didn’t bother attacking the group since escaping was its main intent.

It was the size of a bowl but when it spread its wings, true flames poured down in a devastating manner.

“Raa!” The bear laying next to Li Qiye’s feet leaped into the air and smashed the fleeing worm down to the ground.

“Crack!” The bear started chomping on the worm. It didn’t take long before it ate all the flames and the worm itself.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It seemed satisfied and smacked its lips, still savoring the delicious meal while laying down next to Li Qiye again.

The monarch became startled. He had underestimated the worm, leading to its potential escape. However, this bear easily took it down, meaning that it was most likely stronger than him.

His eyes shifted between the bear and Li Qiye while wondering about Li Qiye’s identity. Since even a pet was this strong, he should at least be a powerful and famous cultivator.

“Okay, now we can plant it again. So much problem over something so minor, you all should focus on agricultural alchemy more lest you want to let your founder down.” Li Qiye looked bored as he said.

The young disciples didn’t say anything while the saint child had an ugly expression. He hoped for a mistake not only to punish Li Qiye but to also weaken the saintess’ claim to the successor position. Alas, this ended up with her making a notable contribution by being so decisive.

Under her guidance, other disciples were able to plant the phoenix’s crest again without any lasting damage.

She then bowed toward Li Qiye and said: “Thank you for your guidance, Young Noble. I will try my best to amend my lack of skills.”

Li Qiye nodded and had a high evaluation of her. He added with a smile: “As long as you put in the effort, you will be able to inherit your founder’s legacy one day.”

“I will work hard.” She stared at him for a second before lowering her head, blushing.

“Hahaha, amazing.” The monarch calmed down and joined the conversation: “Looks like we are indeed lacking in many aspects, I appreciate your guidance today, Young Noble.”

He was proud of their alchemy skill including agriculture and cultivating the plants. Alas, this was a clear mistake.

“May I inquire where you are from, Young Noble? How did you learn your alchemy dao?” He then asked.

“I studied it myself.” He smiled.

“Oh?” The monarch didn’t quite believe him.

If someone could be so knowledgeable alone, then what was the point of their sect? Its elites had worse skills than a self-taught alchemist? That would be rather embarrassing. Little did he know that he was talking to the very progenitor of the modern alchemy dao.

“Either way, you definitely have a unique perspective on plant cultivation.” The monarch praised.

“I just know a little bit.” Li Qiye said humbly, prompting the monarch to smile wryly.

If the guy only knew a little bit, what about them?

“Hmm, are you good at solving alchemy issues?” The monarch thought about something.

“Depends on the question.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.
