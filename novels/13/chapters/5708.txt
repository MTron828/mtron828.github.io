Chapter 5709: Giant Machine

This giant looked larger than the one seen back in Imperial Attendant City. Its sheer existence tore the fabrics of reality.

The difference was that it relied on Celestial Court’s power as the foundation and Immortal Emperor Zhuo Huo’s flame as the ignition.

This did not belong to the current epoch or Trinity. Speculators believed that it was passed down after Grand Dao War. Otherwise, Celestial Court would have employed it instead of suffering a crushing defeat.

This was indeed the truth. They had relatively weak control over the titular heavenly treasure until recently.

“Eat this!” It roared and smashed down with both hands.

“Boom!” The stars shattered from its violent swing. Explosions illuminated the sky and the myriad realms.

Not to mention regular living beings, even imperial-level characters found its power astounding. Before the two arms fully made contact, the force had already cleaved the vast ocean into three parts, revealing the seabed.

“Activate!” Niu Fen roared and summoned his anima tree pulsing with a primordial light. The elucidation power of his solutions within his bloodline activated, summoning an ancient image.

“Raa!” A massive snail appeared - one capable of devouring the galaxy and three thousand worlds with one breath.

Its size was comparable to the colossal machine. The spirals on his shell rotated continuously, looking like an independent cosmo ready to protect the islands below.

This was his ultimate form after deriving his solutions to the limit. The situation warranted this extreme measure.

Alas, the great snail still couldn’t stop the frightening smash.

“Bam!” The spirals collapsed and Niu Fen was sent flying while vomiting blood.

“Start the momentum!” Sindragon and the others retreated, no longer dealing with the individual legions of Celestial Court.

Runes intertwined and engulfed Imperial Field, spanning from the bottom of the ocean to all the islands. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

They initiated their grand momentum to seal everything outside. No power or existence would be able to enter Imperial Field without permission.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” The gigantic hands smashed the momentum, changing the very landscape of the region.

Living beings beneath screamed in horror while observing the cataclysmic scene above.

“Boom!” Finally, the grand momentum’s weakest corner crumbled.

The overall potency of the barrier weakened drastically, unable to endure the smashes. A dozen islands or so were obliterated next.

“Go!” The armies of Celestial Court finally poured in through the opening.

“Kill them!” Imperial Field had no choice but to meet them in direct battle. They were weakened with the grand momentum gone, unable to keep up with the blessed soldiers.

“Second formation!” Demon Conqueror ordered.

“Buzz.” Runic arrays as sharp and tough as blades appeared, culminating in a silvery imperial formation.

Everyone shuddered after sensing its merciless killing potential, top cultivators included. This stench of blood seemed to have been formed from the corpses of emperors and monarchs.

“Rumble!” The islands resonated with the imperial formation. Leaders at the imperial level channeled everything into the same point, harnessing a unique power.

Next, a primordial tree grew from each of the islands. Though not overly large and brimming with affinity, the sheer quantity alone was shocking.

Instead of fruits, the branches had silver arrows with a golden layer made from chaos energy. The aura stemming from them was one of death and murder.
