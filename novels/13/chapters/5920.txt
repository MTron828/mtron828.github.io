Chapter 5920: Sky Pass Stone Buddha

“Though I haven’t seen it myself, there are accounts of this area having a majestic fortress. It collapsed after a war known as Immortals Slaughtered and was flooded.” Chu Zhu said.

“Must have been a terrifying tsunami.” Li Qiye entertained her and didn’t question why there was only a desert around with no sign of water.

“From the records, over yonder is an ocean, a part of Uncrossable Expanse.” She continued.

“I see, Uncrossable Expanse.” Li Qiye smiled and stared in that direction.

“You’ve heard of it?” She noticed his expression.

“A long time ago, you reminded me just now.” Li Qiye nodded.

“It’s a part of history now.” She had a smile resembling a blooming plum blossom in a valley: “From what I’ve read, it is gone due to the great calamity and subsequent wars. It fragmented twice into several sections, one of them being here.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She had a commendable knowledge of lost history and provided him with information.

“I see.” Li Qiye responded.

“It wasn’t a desert here before but a boundless ocean with surging waves after the war.” She explained: “However, the legendary pass was tall enough to deal with the waves. The issue was the numerous powerful monsters from the ocean. They rampaged and devoured the inhabitants.”

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded.

This casual response surprised her - why was a mortal not surprised to hear these frightening tales?

“Fortunately, the wise sages came to help and protected this area from the monsters. They saved everyone.” Chu Zhu looked around in a daze, imagining the great pass attempting to fend off the waves of colossal monsters.

The carriage appeared to be moving slowly but its actual speed was impressive. It gradually left the desert and reached a mountain range. This hid the desert from the outside world.

Once they reached the top, Li Qiye stepped out and gazed at the landscape beneath him.

He crouched down and scooped up a handful of sand. As the sand trickled through his fingers, he gazed at the sprawling landscape once more and let out a sigh.

“Sky Pass.” He murmured.

“You know the name of the fortress?” Chu Zhu was taken aback again.

“It’s an old one.” Li Qiye gazed sentimentally at the coiling mountain range.

“Indeed.” Chu Zhu didn’t know how this mortal managed to recognize this place. Nevertheless, she moved forward while putting her skepticism aside: “It didn’t use to be down here, I believe it was a floating fortress. It’s a shame we won’t be able to see its glorious days.”

“Right, it was a miraculous existence and looked like a coiling dragon.” Li Qiye smiled.

This recalled his memories of the wonderful pass and walls stretching across Immortal Lineage World.

“Sky Pass was only one part of the moat too, a stronghold guaranteeing everyone’s safety.” Chu Zhu said softly: “It fell due to Uncrossable Expanse shattering after Immortals Slaughtered War.”

“One can defend against ten thousand here.” Li Qiye commented.

“That’s exactly what happened in the legends. Stone Buddha, the commander of the pass, guarded this place with her legion.” Chu Zhu responded.

“Unfortunately, it’s all in the past now.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Sky Pass was the first to withstand the onslaught of the sea monsters. The battle lasted three days and three nights but the legion couldn’t stop the unending waves. The commander’s closest friend, Godhand, came to help to no avail. The pass couldn’t withstand the assault so it became a battle to the death. It was already too late once Supreme Black Ancestor’s group arrived...” She sighed before continuing: “Stone Buddha and Godhand fought valiantly to the end. When reinforcement came, they only saw ruins.”

“Loyal and selfless, they did not fail their mission.” Li Qiye commented.

“Right, one defeat couldn’t overshadow their proud achievements as protectors over the years.” Chu Zhu said: “Furthermore, they slaughtered enough beasts and bought enough time for the emperors to sweep through the rest. They used a special flame to incinerate the rest of the ocean and here we are, left with this desert.”

“Truly a costly disaster.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, it is now remembered as Sky Guard War.” Chu Zhu said softly.
