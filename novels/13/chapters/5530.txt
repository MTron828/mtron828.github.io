Chapter 5531: Preparation For Winter

The winds blew gently along a cliff where only three of five patches of grass could be seen. Leaves scattered downward around an old beggar.

He sat on the edge and seemed to be blind - a risky choice of a place to rest. His robe was worn out with numerous patches sewn unevenly. Whoever did it was far from being skilled.

He wrapped his arms around his shoulders, looking unable to handle the chilling winds.

Li Qiye appeared and sat down next to him.

“Where is your beggar bowl?” He asked with a smile.

“Sigh, I lost it. I can’t believe that someone would be so cruel as to steal it from me.” The old beggar shook his head.

“Evil people exist everywhere, but their evil doesn’t compare to your kind.” Li Qiye said.

“One shouldn’t commit a sin just because the crime is petty nor should one ignore an act of kindness due to its triviality.” The old beggar said.

“Did pearls just come out of a dog’s mouth?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh.

“You disagree, Mister Li?” The old beggar squinted hard enough to see Li Qiye.

“I am neither good nor evil, just myself. Morality is nothing more than perspectives.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“There’s certainly a right answer.” The old beggar said.

“Then it’s relative. If I compare myself to a mortal, I’m a heinous villain, but if I were to compare myself to you all, then I’m as virtuous as can be.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I don’t feel like that’s a fair and accurate assessment regarding your deeds, Mister Li.” The old beggar said.

“If I am as evil as you claim, then why are you here begging? Shouldn’t you be afraid of my chopping off your head after plowing your land?” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t have a good response.” The old beggar admitted.

“Mister Zhao is such a nice guy and has good food, why don’t you go beg at his place instead?” Li Qiye continued.

“His food is delicious indeed, but eating it means having to cultivate more fields as repayment.” The old beggar replied.

“So here you are, running to my place.” Li Qiye said.

“At the very least, you’re open about the price.” The old beggar nodded.

“My benevolence is priceless.” Li Qiye said: “And my prices are reasonable so I don’t think my comment regarding my morality was an exaggeration.”

The old beggar shuddered again due to the wind. After a while, he said: “Mister Li, you stay true to your words and reputation but our paths are different, we cannot walk together.”

“Then let those on the same path walk together. I wonder how similar your path is to Mister Zhao’s.” Li Qiye said.

“Our goal is consistent, I suppose.” The old beggar looked up, seemingly capable of seeing everything despite being blind.

“Even if you achieve your goal, what do you think will be the next outcome?” Li Qiye asked.

The old beggar fell into a brief silence before asking: “What happens if we go with you, Mister Li?”

“Now you have an inaccurate assessment of your worth.” Li Qiye smiled: “First, I might not need your group and when I actually do, you no longer have the freedom to make choices. After all, what can you do beneath the might of the villainous heaven?”

“You are confident in winning, Mister Li.” The old beggar chuckled.

“More or less, it’s a matter of how flawless I want the victory to be now.” Li Qiye said leisurely: “Perfection might require a helping hand but that’s just when it’s beneath the heaven. I can handle everything above so realize how insignificant you are to me.”

“You are willing to let go of this world?” The old beggar asked.

“It has its own karma, completely separated from me.” Li Qiye said: “What about your group’s karma?”

“Our karma.” The old beggar murmured.

“Your karma is gone, everything is already predetermined. If you want to have a new cycle of karma, you must have permission from either me or the high heaven.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Mister Li, you are conspiring with the villainous heaven right now.” The old beggar remarked.

“You all would conspire if you are eligible. Unfortunately, this was thrown away when you abandoned your dao heart.” Li Qiye responded.

“Are you sure that everything will be just like the beginning, Mister Li?” The old beggar asked.

“For me yes, I don’t know about you all.” Li Qiye said.

“It sounds like you are forcing us.” The old beggar said.

“Uttering these words is ridiculous and pompous in the present day. I won’t force you or anyone else, the path is right beneath your feet, feel free to walk however you like.” Li Qiye cradled the back of his head and said calmly: “If anything, you won’t be able to last that long. It’s approaching and will reduce everything to ashes. Are you confident in enduring the inevitable?”

“It’s approaching…” The old beggar expected this but still glanced up at the sky with a solemn expression.

“You’re running out of time, all of you.” Li Qiye remarked.

“Perhaps this is a chance. As the saying goes, there’s always a way out even during the most perilous situation.” The old beggar said seriously.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“That’s a nice phrase and I do not deny the possibility. However, who will be the ones finding the way out? You? Mister Zhao, or someone else? I’m sure the chance has to be seized, would Mister Zhao let you seize it first?” Li Qiye said.

“Hmm, who knows?” The old beggar shook his head.

“You’ll be eaten for sure.” Li Qiye said: “Why not gain a bit of fat before winter? That’s the only way to survive. Plus, all of you know this better than anyone.”

“Are you truly this carefree? We’re not the only ones.” The old beggar paused for a bit before asking.

“No need to worry, I have chosen my path and I shall walk it regardless of the storm. If one expects others to provide shelter, maybe they should have chosen a different path.” Li Qiye said.

“Will you just be a spectator, I don’t think so.” The old beggar said.

“Hence the conspiracy that you accused me of.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t quite understand.” The old beggar said.

“If I were to advance alone, I wouldn’t need to go through all this trouble. Decapitating all of you would be much simpler.”
