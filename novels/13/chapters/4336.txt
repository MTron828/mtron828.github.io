Chapter 4337: Roaring Darkness

The fog immediately swallowed Li Qiye since he was outside the barrier.

“Sect Master!” The members of Little Diamond bellowed in horror, thinking that he was being eaten in there. They feared that the worst had happened.

“He’s dead for sure.” An aghast elder from a different sect commented.

Li Qiye was certainly strong but he couldn’t fight back at all. They thought that if this fog were to roam free, it would annihilate the entire region. The smaller sects would be swallowed just like Li Qiye; not even a speck would be left behind.

They started sweating and thought about running as far away from this place and the south as possible.

“He deserved it.” The great powers remained calm. Some even gloated after seeing this.

Most didn’t care about Li Qiye because he chose to be suicidal.

“What a fool.” The young lord snorted. He hated Li Qiye since the guy tried to ruin his plan. Now, he didn’t need to do anything and the problem was already solved.

This was a great development since he needed to get through Jinlin to get to Li Qiye a while ago.

“Hmm…” Jinlin was worried as well and slightly frowned.

As for Jian Qingzhu, she remained seated and slightly tilted her head in contemplation.

“Raa!” Crazy noises could be heard - shoutings, wailings, screamings…

There seemed to be a great battle raging in the fog. This was a battlefield with numerous combatants - a fight of the lost souls. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The fog intensified and became larger while smashing the barrier relentlessly.

“What is in there?” Cultivators felt as if there was a monster in the darkness, ready to jump out and devour them.

Those from the great powers were far more composed than the ones from the smaller sects.

“Can the barrier keep it at bay?” This became the main question as the ground shook violently.

“Be on guard.” The experts from the great powers started worrying. There was a real chance of the barrier failing and they would be the first to face the waves.

“Master…” Wang Weiqiao was nervous because there hasn’t been any sign of Li Qiye for a while now.

“Your master is dead.” A disciple from a stronger sect sneered.

“What did you expect? He just waltzed into that frightening darkness. I’m pretty sure it ate him down to the last bone.” Another clan member uttered coldly.

“It would be a miracle if he’s still alive.” One expert murmured.

No one here was confident in surviving the fog after being caught.

“Good.” The young lord heaved a sigh of relief since Li Qiye’s death was all but confirmed.

The disciples of Little Diamond felt terrible but there was nothing they could do. If they were to jump into the fog and Li Qiye was alive in there, they would only get in his way and hinder him.

“Pop!” A mysterious power suddenly manifested inside the fog and started a purification process.

It didn’t matter how strong the darkness was. This purification force was unstoppable and washed away the impurities.

In the next second, the fog dissipated from both the ward and the mountain range. The sky and sunlight returned afterward.

They then saw a massive human skull stained by the darkness. This looked like a devil. Its eyes shot out dark rays capable of piercing through everything.

“What the hell is that?!” The top cultivators here finally became afraid after seeing the skull.

Chi Jinlin and the other geniuses were horrified as well. They readied their weapons and prepared for a fight.

“Wait, there’s someone in front of it!” A keen-eyed spectator noticed something.

“It’s Li Qiye!” This became clear after they calmed down from the initial shock of seeing the skull.

It was massive so he looked like a fly in comparison.

“He’s still alive?” No one expected this.

“Sect Master!” The ones from Little Diamond became ecstatic.

“Good.” Chi Jinlin heaved a sigh of relief.

“He’s really a hidden master then.” The reticent Jian Qingzhu murmured.

“Hmph!” The young lord of Dragon was disappointed to see Li Qiye surviving the fog.
