Chapter 4931: Kindhearted Princess

“The audacity, no one can influence the pawnshop.” One student stared at Li Qiye.

He ignored them and told Ming Shi: “Go, little girl, you’ll get something great.”

His confident insistence surprised the crowd.

“Who does he think he is?” Someone murmured.

The others felt the same way. Plus, calling the princess “little girl” was out of line as well. Putting the disrespect aside, no one has been able to control the auction.

In the past, top masters have tried including sovereigns and dragon lords. Some still returned empty-handed, let alone this nameless junior.

“Very well, I’m going.” The princess thought that this was going to go well.

All eyes were on her as she got closer to the carriage. This wasn’t only due to Li Qiye’s comment. She was a famous genius from Untethered so she had always enjoyed the spotlight.

“I’m starting!” She looked back at Li Qiye and shouted.

“Don’t worry, the great fortune is yours.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmph.” Many snorted after hearing this.

Swordgrasp, Halo, and Radiant Young Monarch also didn’t believe Li Qiye.

“Watch, this will be hilarious.” A student sneered.

Ming Shi ignored them and took a deep breath. She then took out a treasure that pulsed brightly.

Whoever was touched by its light felt themselves being purified by this holy power. It washed away unnecessary thoughts and impurities in their grand dao. Their auras became closer to that of chaos true energy.

“The Jewel of Purification!” A student from Untethered shouted.

“Really?!” Others clamored after hearing this. Even the geniuses became alarmed.

This was unique to Untethered, appearing once every ten thousand years. It had a soothing effect to prevent qi deviation and improved meditation.

Many sects desired this treasure but Untethered didn’t have enough for its own disciples, let alone sell it to outsiders.

“Isn’t this too wasteful?” A student calmed down and said.

After all, the probability of success was low - only one or two winners each time. It also seemed that the thing being pawned didn’t affect this rate. Thus, they deemed her choice inefficient.

She held the jewel with both hands and prayed quietly: “Please let me obtain something great so I can give it back to the academy.”

With that, she handed the jewel to the old man. He opened the sack and let her reach inside.

“This little girl.” Li Qiye heard her prayer and chuckled.

“It’s a big gamble.” Goldcrest said: “What kind of exchange will make it worth it?”

He and his peers knew the value of the jewel. Few were willing to be this cavalier.

“Ming Shi wants to give something amazing to the academy, that’s why she wants to test her luck.” Yunyun said.

A hush took over the scene; everyone watched attentively since Ming Shi’s exchanged treasure was the best so far.

“I got something!” Ming Shi felt something and pulled her hand back, feeling excited.

Everyone saw her holding an ancient lantern, its age and grime obscuring the composition of the material. The lantern was caked in filth and no one dared to touch it. The flame inside flickered, on the verge of extinguishing.

“What a loss.” One student murmured.

“See, didn’t I tell you that trading in a precious treasure doesn’t guarantee anything?” Another said.

“Didn’t someone say that she was going to obtain a great fortune? You screwed her over. This is a lesson to everyone, better find the right friends instead of hanging around fools.” One student sneered at Li Qiye.

Ming Shi didn’t know what she was holding and asked the old man: “What is this?”

He rubbed his eyes in disbelief and said: “Child, you are something else. This is Immortal’s Demise, even I can’t catch it. Simply incredible.”

“It sounds amazing.” She happily said.

“Amazing? This is a grand fortune, a great creation.” He was happy for her as well.

His response shocked everyone, leaving them slack-jawed.

“So she was really lucky?” One student said.

Earlier when the guy got a peerless pagoda, the old man didn’t react at all. Now, he was startled to see the lantern.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He naturally understood the treasures that were inside his sack and should be able to grab any of them. However, this lantern was somehow hard to grab? It meant that it was beyond his control.

“This is a great fortune then, completely peerless.” Halo Scion and his friends became emotional.

This sounded as if the princess had obtained something that could propel her to the apex. Could she become a conqueror with it?

“This lantern will be the start of a legend.” Someone said enviously.
