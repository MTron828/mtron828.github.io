Chapter 5312: Celestial Court’s Secret

“Crazy indeed, no, it’s utter madness.” Zhitian concluded.

“There’s a thin line between genius and madness.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It’s best not to be a genius then.” He let out a dry smile.

“Well, don’t worry, you’re not a genius compared to the mad ones, just a regular person at best.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t mind that at all.” Zhitian wasn’t offended by the remark.

“Still alive.” The old servant, on the other hand, focused on another aspect.

“Madmen normally live longer than anyone else.” Li Qiye said while sensing the land.

“Not here though.” The old servant understood Reborn, to an extent.

“Yes, not here. It would be too easy otherwise.” Li Qiye smiled.

The old servant has been feeling uneasy since the moment they entered this land, especially after these conversations.

“I still can’t imagine the events that have unfolded in these four broken realms.” Zhitian talked about the mysteries.

“You should be thanking the villainous heaven because without tribulations…” Li Qiye paused.

“Go on…” He urged.

“The four broken realms are only tiny experiments. They would target the entire world if they could.” The old servant answered instead.

“That is correct. It depends on the strength of the world as well.” Li Qiye said.

“They would try to refine the entire world into something like Redflood?” Zhitian asked.

“Even worse, more like Perish and Ultimate.” The old servant said. 

He had visited and researched the broken realms in the past. Now, with Li Qiye’s input, he gained a good idea of the past.

“If it weren’t for the heavenly tribulations, this world would be no more.” Li Qiye added.

The two exchanged glances after hearing this. The old servant took a deep breath and asked: “Are they still around now?”

Li Qiye glanced at the sky and said: “Yes, and they’re living well, still keeping an eye on everything as well, hence Celestial Court’s existence.”

“Impossible!” Zhitian shouted because Celestial Court was the supreme pillar of The Race. It had protected them throughout the eras.

In fact, some believed that they would have been extinct without the protection of Celestial Court.

“Celestial Court is the guardian light of The Race.” Zhitian said. 

Though he had issues with its recent direction, he was still a member of The Race and had respect for Celestial Court.

“Would a farmer let wolves eat their pigs?” Li Qiye asked.

Zhitian trembled because this idea would subvert everything that he had believed in regarding Celestial Court.

“The wise sages were noble protectors.” He said softly. His clan had produced numerous apex cultivators who sacrificed their lives for the greater good.

“Do you think they were the masters of Celestial Court?” Li Qiye smirked.

“Then who? The current lords right now are Nether Emperor and Sword Emperor.” Zhitian answered.

Nether was an ancient emperor and had ruled Celestial Court for many years in the past. Sword Emperor, surprisingly enough, came from the Qian. When the Qian were branded as sinners, he was the first to mobilize against his own father - World Emperor.

In history, the ancient emperors served as the leaders of Celestial Court and maintained The Race’s prosperity.

“Who do you think branded the Qian and The People as sinners?” Li Qiye casually asked.

Zhitian fell into rumination. Immemorial Epoch War happened a long time ago so only legends remained.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Who branded them as sinners…” He said with uncertainty: “Nether Emperor?”

“Could be your ancestor, Crimson Emperor.” Li Qiye smiled amusingly.

“No way, our ancestor obtained twelve wills after World Emperor.” Zhitian disagreed.

“That’s right, your ancestor lost one will later. Although he gained Flame Emperor’s immortal armament, he is only a little brother before World Emperor. Your clan right is arguably number one or two among The Race, but in the past, it couldn’t compare to the Qian.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, one clan with nine emperors, that’s untouchable.” Zhitian said.

“Untouchable is still not enough to describe their influence. No one among the three major races dared to say no to World Emperor. Nether Emperor might be old, but that’s it. He wouldn’t have dared to brand the Qian as sinners unless he had a death wish.” Li Qiye said.

“No clan in the present reached the same height as the Qian, not my clan or the Lu.” Zhitian agreed.

“Let’s get back to the question then, who branded them as sinners?” Li Qiye asked.

Despite the seemingly impossible scenario, history proved otherwise - the Qian was eventually destroyed by a coalition force under Celestial Court.

It couldn’t have been Crimson Emperor or Nether Emperor. They were not qualified to do so and the other emperors wouldn’t have listened.

“There is a higher existence in Celestial Court.” Zhitian finally understood.

“The current apex cultivator is far from the apex. It is only the first step.” The old servant explained: “Only those that have gained anima and embarked on the path toward everlasting life are qualified to learn these secrets.”

“Mostly true.” Li Qiye said: “There are unspoken rules regarding these taboo topics.”

“Who is this mysterious existence?” Zhitian asked, unable to think of someone capable of ordering the ancient emperors.
