Chapter 5145: Grilled Fish

Divine Alliance had many members from The Race; some of whom sore allegiance to Celestial Court.

During Profound Emperor’s era, it maintained neutrality because the emperor was strong enough to command his followers.

After he left, Divine Alliance immediately took the side of Celestial Court and changed its stance. This was understandable since most of the high-ranking members came from The Race.

Principle Conqueror changed this during his reign. Although he wasn’t the most brilliant, he was charismatic and maintained a fine balance, reviving Profound Emperor’s neutrality.

Now, everyone could see that the two alliances were going to be close again. They were definitely the stronger side with a high number of conquerors.

On the other hand, Dao and Imperial Alliance didn’t share as strong of a bond. Nonetheless, they would certainly feel enough pressure to band together once more.

This was the time for conquerors in the upper continents to make a choice for a storm was approaching.

Windchaser and Harkrain were aware of this development. A war between The People and The Race seemed inevitable; all would be dragged into this storm.

“We stand with no one, but anyone who dares to block our path will be our enemies.” Windchaser said decisively.

“As I’ve said, you only need to worry about one side. Leave Dao and Imperial Alliance to us. If they dare to interfere, we’ll topple them.” Jun Landu said.

“Don’t bring me into this.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Unfortunately, they won’t give me the time of day due to my lack of ability but if you let them know, it’s a different story. You can’t eat his fish for free.” Landu smiled.

“Looks like you managed to fish a favor from me.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“No, it’s because you already wanted to help them.” Landu said.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything back since he didn’t mind at all.

“We’re still dao gazing?” Li Qiye drank the special dew and asked.

“Of course.” Landu gathered his stuff and told Windchaser: “We’re heading to the Lu to look at the dao light. Don’t bother us with unnecessary matters.”

“Please enjoy yourselves, Lord Landu and Young Noble.” Windchaser appreciated Landu’s intent in bringing Li Qiye here.

After they left Windchaser Hall, Li Qiye told Landu: “A master fisherman, aren’t you?”

“I didn’t need to fish, you only came because you wanted to see something beautiful.” Landu said.

“Indeed, the world needs beautiful things.” Li Qiye said.

“Leave it to me to find them, you just need to observe.” Landu said.

“Looks like you’re actually rather busy.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Humans aren’t plants. Who can be without feelings? If I were to be heartless, it wouldn’t be good for this world.” Landu said.

“Yes, you wouldn’t be you then.” Li Qiye said: “Idle people are never heartless since they can appreciate the beauty of life.”

“I am unworthy of such praise, Sir.” Landu responded: “You know, I watched him grow up running naked all over the mountains, it’s hard not to be attached.”

“You just don’t want the burden of being a master.” Li Qiye smiled.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Although Landu had never taught Windchaser merit laws or techniques, he allowed the youth to stay outside the courtyard and purposely read loud enough for the youth to hear. This built a foundation for Windchaser’s cultivation since the books were extraordinary. Thus, Landu had truly taught him the dao, an unofficial master.

“Sigh, I can’t be so soft-hearted.” Landu emotionally said: “I will reap what I sow.”

“There’s nothing wrong with appreciating talent.” Li Qiye said: “Smart people will always seek the dao.”

“Well, I suppose I have at least done something decent in life.” Landu laughed.

The Lu was a behemoth with several conquerors. The Domain of Stars was a part of the clan’s ancestral ground with numerous dao fortunes. Only important big shots from the clan had entry rights.

Today, there were two people sitting on a cliff early morning. They also had a table and a grill.

Landu poured Li Qiye wine and smiled: “I got this from the last time I visited a temple in the Pure Land. It’s aged well, please have a taste.”

The moment the liquid touched the cup, it released the hymns and halos of Buddhism. Moreover, he was using treasured cups from Buddhism as well so amazing phenomena appeared above them.

“Old indeed, numerous epochs.” Li Qiye took a sip and said. The wine filled the drinker’s stomach with wondrous Buddhist affinity.

His stomach suddenly bloated, making him look like a round-stomach Buddha.

“That’s why I couldn’t help myself from borrowing one bottle.” Landu said.

“I’m sure the monks were after you for it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“No way, they’re so benevolent and kind so they forgave me.” Landu laughed.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t pursue the issue.

“Can’t just be having good wine alone, right? Grilled fish is coming up.” Landu worked hard and prepared the charcoal to grill the divine fish on a rack.
