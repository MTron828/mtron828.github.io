Chapter 5254: Unqualified To Be Called Emperor Suppression

Suppression lived up to his fame, far superior to the average conqueror. Each of his steps caused a loud detonation as the grand dao appeared beneath his feet.

Runes emerged and twisted together, creating wondrous phenomena. Space and time worked together to form a domain large enough to reach the sky. The runes became as large as mountains, capable of suppressing all living beings.

Everyone within his domain became frozen including Xiao Qingtian’s group who had twelve sacred fruits.

“Emperor Suppression Art!” A crowd member shouted while feeling an immense weight pushing down on them.

“Are you ready?” Suppression was the lord of his domain. He looked down at Li Qiye with absolute confidence.

Li Qiye smiled and entered the domain without any hesitation.

“Boom!” The pressure immediately came down on him with the force of an entire galaxy.

“Buzz.” The gauntlet released its flames again to create a barrier, flawlessly preventing Li Qiye from feeling any negative effect.

“Words are used so carelessly nowadays, this is Emperor Suppression?” Li Qiye smiled after a full scan, disparaging the domain feared by so many cultivators.

Suppression didn’t become angry and only focused on the gauntlet.

“Want to understand it?” Li Qiye smiled and raised his hand, letting the guy take a better look.

Meanwhile, spectators wondered if the treasure is enough to contend against Suppression Conqueror.

“Strong it may be, it will not let you leave this place unscathed.” Suppression’s voice became dignified and intimidating.

“Go ahead and try. Just know that this is a suicidal endeavor.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“My fate is up to me alone, I am not afraid. Get ready.” Suppression laughed in the face of death.

“Make your move.” Li Qiye agreed.

“Boom!” Suppression’s imperial flames shook the two continents. His dao began refining everything in his domain as he raised his hands.

It was as if he had a thousand hands behind him, capable of controlling all affinities and powers.

“Rumble!” Time flowed at his fingertips along with spatial fabrics. He had no problem controlling these different forces at the same time.

“Emperor Suppression!” He swung both hands downward and the pressure multiplied by a hundred thousand times over.

All of the grand dao shot out like pulses against Li Qiye, destroying everything along the way. The battlefield reverted back to the start of time - nothing was left but an empty expanse.

If he hadn’t contained this inside his domain, ten million miles of land would be flattened in the blink of an eye.

He had used this to great effect against top cultivators previously, hence the name of the technique. They could only lament while being stuck on the ground, unable to resist the pressure.

“Boom!” However, he didn’t find the same success here since the gauntlet easily stopped the technique.

“This insignificant technique is undeserving of its name, know your limit.” Li Qiye said while raising his hand up in the air.

Flames rushed out of the gauntlet and formed a larger palm, seemingly capable of flipping three thousand worlds over.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Suppression’s technique was nullified while he got sent flying as well.

“Boom!” The palm changed into a fist and punched the flying conqueror.

“Ugh…” The latter smashed into the boundary of his own domain and vomited blood.

When he stood up, cracking noises could be heard as if several bones have been broken. The front of his robe was stained with blood.

Nonetheless, he channeled chaos true energy and successfully healed his wounds in no time at all.
