Chapter 3534: Chan Yang’s Decision

Translator Note: I’ll be mass changing Yin Yang Gate into Yin Yang Zen Gate when an admin is available.

It didn’t take long before no one from the coalition was left. The sovereign has successfully saved them all.

The atmosphere became eerily silent afterward. The spectators still didn’t dare to stare at Li Qiye whom they deemed to be the apex existence of this world on the same level as heaven. Looking up at him still required immense courage.

He lacked the same ferocious aura and bite as other masters due to his ordinary appearance. However, in their eyes, he was as extraordinary and unreachable as can be.

“Welcome back to the city, Your Excellency.” Pearlstone Saintess led thousands of disciples outside the gate and prostrated on the ground to welcome him back.

The disciples and ancestors - even the reclusive ones - all came out for this ceremony.

“Good.” Li Qiye nodded and stepped up the palanquin.

“The descendants of Ancestral City didn’t throw away their ancestors’ face.” Dragon King Commander praised after seeing this.

Meanwhile, the neutral spectators outside the gate lowered their head with their hands hanging downward in order to bid him goodbye.

“I took pride in my intelligence and being able to read people. Seems like I’m clearly inferior to a junior today, how embarrassing.” One wise master commented.

Those nearby didn’t say anything. The knowledgeable ancestors felt the same way.

Not long ago, many found it astounding that Pearlstone Saintess supported Li Qiye and annulled the marriage agreement with Yin Yang Zen Gate. They considered her choice to be unwise and irrational.

Moreover, the youths thought that a junior like Li Qiye wasn’t worth her antagonizing Yin Yang Zen Gate.

Nonetheless, the saintess still made such an unbelievable decision. Most thought that she would herald a calamity to Ancestral City.

In hindsight, she had the best insight and chose the right person. In fact, her decision saved Ancestral City.

Just think about it, if she had acted like everyone else and valued Bai Jianchan highly, the result would have been obvious. She would have died just like Bai Jianchan and Skylight Princess. Even her sect might have been destroyed.

Now, she had the chance to invite Li Qiye inside the city and could serve him. This was a godsend opportunity. Even Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang wasn’t so lucky.

Realizing this made the wisdom masters among the crowd think that they were nothing more than frogs under the well, truly shameful. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“It’ll be hard for Ancestral City not to rise with her leading the way.” One ancestor commented.

She earned the favor of a supreme existence like Li Qiye. This was a true fortune and opportunity unavailable to others who failed to see it.

So many youths and geniuses felt embarrassed as a result. They were the loudest bunch in questioning Pearlstone Saintess and Dragon-phoenix Maiden. By this point, it became apparent that Li Qiye wasn’t the lucky one but rather, the two girls.

“Go back and stay in the sect, stop causing trouble.” An ancestor eventually yelled at his juniors.

This was duplicated in multiple groups. They eventually left Ancestral City and returned to their sect.

The powers in the north closed their door and stopped their disciples from traveling after this event. They were afraid of the young ones causing unnecessary trouble, especially something foolish like provoking Li Qiye.

Yin Yang Zen Gate and its allies were the best examples. They nearly got destroyed from the debacle.

The ancestors also ordered their disciples to not talk about Li Qiye. This was another potential source of trouble.

***

Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang didn’t immediately return to the void after bringing back his sect members. He stood at the highest peak there and gazed at the world in silence for a long period.

Yin Yang Zen Gate has been around for a long time. It had a similar name in the past - Yin Yang Gate. It was created by the invincible Immortal Emperor Yin Yang, becoming one of the strongest imperial lineages. [1]

Later on, the sovereign during his youth was chosen by Ancestral Realm as its successor. Unfortunately, he didn’t finish learning his arts before the realm was destroyed by Li Qiye.

This power was extremely strong and has lasted for millions of years, capable of commanding the world. Unfortunately, it stood no chance against Li Qiye.

This experience left a deep impression on Chan Yang. Thus, he later changed the name of Yin Yang Gate to Yin Yang Zen Gate.

Unfortunately, the sect was nearly destroyed again under his leadership. He nearly became an eternal sinner as well.

He watched the land in silence. He has always been here and guaranteed its prosperity and survival. Though it grew stronger with him around, it eventually became his shackles; the descendants became a source of worries.

Most importantly, it seemed that his protection caused future generations to become inferior, filled with pride and a sense of indestructibility.

He eventually made up his mind - it was time for him to leave. After all, he had protected Yin Yang Zen Gate long enough.

The descendants had their own path and fate. He chose to follow the path of the Immortal Emperors and the dao lords. It was time for him to leave and be free to his own desires.

He couldn’t keep on being the sect’s guardian. Otherwise, declination would be inevitable.

“Ancestor, that, that Li Qiye...” The ancestor in charge of guarding the coffin quietly said.

“Silence!” The sovereign shouted with unquestionable authority: “Never bring this up again. It is a forbidden matter that might result in total destruction.”

“My mistake.” The ancestor’s legs became weak as he dropped to the ground and apologized.

“It is time for me to go. I leave Yin Yang Zen Gate to you all.” The sovereign added.

“?!” The ancestor became startled and said: “Ancestor, where, where are you going?”

“The ends of the world or wherever I want to.” The sovereign had an unprecedented sense of freedom after making this choice.

“Ancestor, if, if you leave, what is the sect going to do?” The ancestor was scared out of his mind.

The sect has always been under his protection. This allowed them to be confident, rising above all obstacles and defeating their foes.

“They have their own fate, no need for me to worry.” The sovereign casually responded, no longer caring about the sect and future generations.

1. Normally, the adjective before the noun (gate) doesn’t matter. This time around, since the author specifically made this distinction, I’ll be changing the new Yin Yang Gate to Yin Yang Zen Gate. Two reasons behind omitting Zen. First, brevity and an assumption of triviality. Second, it was hard to translate correctly without context at first. The character has the following meanings: meditation (Buddh.); Zen; dhyana. Meditation can’t be used since it would be a guess without context and it’s too long. Dhyana is better but would also be a guess. Zen is neutral enough so this should have been the pick. I just thought that it wouldn’t matter in the grand scheme of things like the majority of names
