Huang Jie and Liu Fuyou were still contemplating about this issue because it wasn’t debated in the past at all.

The seven laws have been around since the Ancient Era. Everyone was used to their existence. It was so common across the land. Now, many sects have abandoned them.

No one really ever took the time to wonder why there were seven but not a different number. Was it just a coincidence?

They came from Blessed Dao Lord who spread it across Eight Desolaces. If there were potential changes or necessary adjustments, someone as brilliant as Blessed would have changed them long ago.

“What is it?” Li Qiye asked the two lost in contemplation.

They regained their wits and exchanged glances while rubbing their palms awkwardly.

“Young Master, there is a big examination each year in our sect to pick excellent disciples. The brats have a good foundation but their merit laws are lacking, please teach them.” Fuyou spoke up about the children from Liu Village.

Their foundation and mantra cultivation were excellent but they lacked merit laws compared to their peers.

After all, the village didn’t have many to offer them. On the other hand, their peers were already adept at this front. Some came from the five main branches of Divine Peak and had access to superior merit laws. That’s why Fuyou came seeking Li Qiye’s help.

Huang Jie had an earnest expression while listening. He heard about Li Qiye’s exceptional comprehension of the dao from Fuyou before. That’s why he also had questions regarding cultivation for him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Li Qiye didn’t answer Fuyou. He gazed forward and eventually stood up to say: “Let’s take a walk.”

He was already out the door while the two were still surprised. They hurriedly caught up, not knowing his intention.

Divine Black was massive with numerous mountainous paths. One could go from any mountain to another via these paths.

Li Qiye continued heading deeper into the sect. The two had no choice but to follow him.

They met many disciples along the way who were also confused by this scene. Li Qiye was as common as can be. The only thing rare yet not rare about him were his three mortal aptitudes.

Rare because he was most likely the only one here with them; not rare because most mortals suffered this lack of innate talents.

Strangely enough, two seniors in Fuyou and Huang Jie were walking behind him. That made people wonder why these two would be showing so much respect to this regular disciple.

Of course, they didn’t dare to gossip in the two’s presence and waited until the group got farther away.

Some believed that Li Qiye might be an illegitimate child of a big shot. Another said that he was under the protection of the sect after obtaining the Nine Primeval Laws.

After all, the sect should be afraid of potentially leaking their strongest merit laws. Having this plan in place made sense.

“Call it supervision instead of protection. He’s dead if he dares to leak it.” One disciple assumed that this was Fuyou and Huang Jie’s job.

In Divine Black, disciples were allowed to roam freely with the exception of certain important locations along with the five actual main peaks.

The trio made it to the ancestral peak before they knew it. This was the main peak in Divine Black, looking like the head of the greatest tortoise. It seemed to be roaring at the heaven.

A great river surged around the lake just like a spirit snake. One could hear the currents from a distance.

Li Qiye was by the river right now and went up a high platform to take a look at the peak engulfed in clouds and fog.

To the back were the five other peaks with several hundred more. They made up the “shell” of the turtle, capable of shouldering anything.

The ancestral peak, unlike the other five, had no disciples or lineage. Just climbing up there was a challenge.

For some unknown reason, this peak has been sealed all this time. The elders themselves couldn’t go there.

Only the official ceremonies were carried out beneath the ancestral peak. It was normally deserted.

Li Qiye stared at the peak with a smile on his face, seemingly able to see something wondrous there. The two found this strange.

“What are you looking at, Young Master?” Fuyou eventually asked.

“Do you know what is up there?” Li Qiye was still looking at the pinnacle.

“Well, I don’t know since no one has gotten up there.” Fuyou scratched his head.

“No, one forefather has gotten up there before - South Conch Dao Lord.” Huang Jie added.

This dao lord was the one who revitalized their sect and the only person who obtained a golden avatar.

“The second will be me.” Li Qiye said, leaving the two shocked.

Huang Jie took a deep breath. He certainly thought that Li Qiye was amazing and unfathomable, he still found this claim to be exaggerated.

No one has been up there outside of their patriarch and South Conch Dao Lord.

“Our sect master still can’t get up there.” He eventually said.

“He’s him, I’m me, can’t compare the two of us.” Li Qiye didn’t mind.

Huang Jie needed to take another deep breath after this. Their sect master was the strongest cultivator in their sect. In fact, he was a big shot across the northern West King yet Li Qiye spoke as if he was no big deal.

Huang Jie looked around and fortunately, there was no one else near. The comment could have been persecuted for being disrespectful.

“Young Master, you truly want to climb up there?” Fuyou himself found this hard to believe. Remember, the previous person to do this was a Dao Lord.

“Stop being so surprised, it’s just climbing.” Li Qiye said.

The two were at a loss for words. Fuyou’s admiration for Li Qiye couldn’t be any higher but he still hesitated regarding this matter.

“Didn’t you ask me about teaching the kids some merit laws?” Li Qiye looked back at Fuyou and asked.
