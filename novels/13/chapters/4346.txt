Chapter 4347: Dark Existence

“Boom!” The monstrosity leaped in the air and smashed with both hands again. It didn’t rely on the grand dao or flashy techniques. Space became as feeble as porcelain before its attack.

The majority of the crowd had never witnessed a power of this level before. Some younger disciples fainted from the pressure.

Even the elders and sect masters were utterly intimidated and dropped down on their butt. That smash earlier could destroy any smaller sect in Southern Desolace, replacing them with a bottomless crater.

They were afraid that the avatar wouldn’t be able to stop the smash and bellowed in horror.

They calmed down and focused on the battle - a five-colored radiance propped up numerous worlds behind the avatar.

They were worlds ruled by the sword dao. Swords flew out from the worlds and formed massive walls as a defensive measure.

Alas, the smash made it through all of them except the very last one. Nonetheless, it was still a successful block.

“Yes!” The crowd cheered again.

“He’s even stronger than expected.” One disciple from a great power praised the monarch while those from small sects were left speechless.

The avatar shifted towards the offensive. The worlds sent out a tsunami of swords to cut the dark creature. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It raised its hands to block the incoming swords. Fiery sparks splashed everywhere. The body resembled the toughest rock in existence, capable of handling the barrage.

Just when everyone thought that the swords were useless, a gigantic sword manifested into reality behind the creature. It exuded five colors as it pointed upward at the sky. Dao laws and chaos energy were in rotation, making it look like the source of the world.

“Clank!” Everything seemed dimmed compared to its radiance.

The slash came faster than the clank of the sword. It severed the yin and yang before the spectators could scream. They felt as if their body was being dismembered into two halves just from watching.

In the front was a relentless tsunami of blades. To the back was a five-colored divine sword with unstoppable power.

It finally cut the creature and made it bellow in pain. The hardened body was split vertically from the head down.

“Rumble!” The two halves fell down on the ground and caused an earthquake.

Next came silence as everyone stared at the bright avatar. They then looked down at the corpse, thinking that it was dead.

“No one can beat him!” The members of the small sects were still paralyzed on the ground.

For most of them, they could train their entire life and only get to the level of Deer King at best. The young lord and Chi Jinlin were certainly above their reach.

As for someone like Peacock Monarch? It was an honor just to see his avatar in person, let alone ever catch up. This could become the most memorable story in their life.

For the great powers, they realized that the monarch was stronger than their sect masters and kings. He should almost be comparable to their ancient ancestors.

“What an amazing cultivator.” Chi Jinlin couldn’t help but praise.

He had met plenty of masters before. His father was the current king of Lion’s Roar and a capable cultivator. Alas, there was a considerable gap between those two. The monarch had firmly established himself as a frontrunner of this generation.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!” The lake water was repeating the cracking phenomenon again, akin to glaciers breaking apart.

“What’s going on now?” An ominous feeling took over.

More darkness oozed from the cracks but this time, they didn’t soar to the sky and remained one meter above the lake. Nonetheless, the sky suddenly turned dark.

This prompted everyone to look up. It was still blue but something was covering the area above them. No, this was a psychological phenomenon - an unknown entity was drilling into their mind and soul.

They found themselves to be standing before an abyss. Falling down would mean eternal damnation. Eventually, they lost their sight altogether and only saw darkness. This naturally horrified them.

“Something is coming out.” Chi Jinlin was startled as well.
