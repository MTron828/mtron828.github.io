Chapter 4207: Ancient Ancestor Jialun

Experts in the know shuddered upon hearing about these beings. Only the youths didn’t have an idea.

“Are they that strong?” One of them had zero impression regarding them.

“I’m sure you have heard of Vastsea Paragon and Earthraiser Vajra. They’re right below them.” His senior explained with a stern look on his face.

This prompted the youth to gasp in awe. Every cultivator in Sword Continent has heard of Vastsea Paragon and Earthraiser Vajra before.

They were members of the Five Overlords - the strongest masters. These swords gods and ancient ancestors were the next tier?

“Are all of them here?” Someone quietly asked.

“Who knows, but given the circumstances, at least a few.” An ancestor responded.

Just a moment ago, the crowd was loud and boisterous while making demands. Now, only hushed words came out since they were intimidated by the great beings.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

They thought that this was obvious from the start. After all, Peace Ocean and Void weren’t enough to take care of this serious business.

This didn’t mean that they were incapable. Unfortunately, they were still too young and couldn’t match the two saints. Therefore, multiple mighty ancestors had to be here.

“If all of them come, there’s no chance of winning.” An expert murmured: “Wait, unless Hallowed City Lord and Nightloom come too.”

“Just wait, I’m sure more than the sect masters from our side are here. Maybe the ancient ancestors will come or are on the way.” An old ancestor speculated.

The big sects needed more than just the two saints to maintain their prestige. Thus, ancient ancestors must have come out for this grand event.

Meanwhile, Nine-sun Sword Saint’s eyes became bright, piercing through the sword formation and the diamond wall.

“Elders, please show yourselves.” He asked.

Though he didn’t raise his voice, each word still pierced through the world and lingered for a long time. Everyone in this region heard him clearly and knew that he chose to escalate the situation.

He was no longer a hotheaded youth. Thus, he must have carefully thought about this conflict and didn’t mind going against Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel.

“Sword Saint, you think the youths aren’t worthy of being your opponents and want to fight my old bones instead?” A thunderous answer came from deeper in the barricaded zone.

Though it was still extremely far away, the sound waves came over like a storm and nearly sent people flying.

“So strong!” The listeners staggered backward and became aghast. Just the person’s voice from a distance alone possessed incredible power.

“So this is a top master from those two sects?” A youth turned pale.

This shattered their confidence in the coalition just now; their fiery spirit extinguished. They felt like insects before this being that has yet to show up.

“So you’re here, Senior Jialun.” The sword saint wasn’t surprised to hear this voice.

“Ancient Ancestor Jialun! The leader of the Six Sword Gods!” A big shot shouted.

“Sword God Jialun…” The neutral ancient ancestors in hiding took a deep breath after hearing this.

“It seems like they are going all out. Ancient Ancestor Jialun finally woke up after a hundred thousand years of slumbering.” A high elder trembled.

“Do you think we’ll see Vastsea Paragon too?” A last-gen elder wondered.

“This divine sword has to be extraordinary for him to come out.” One sect master solemnly added.

Sword God Jialun was the master of Wan Daojian - a victim of Li Qiye back in Cloud Dream Marsh.

“I have no choice but to drag myself out of the grave since there’s no one else in our kingdom. At least I get to see the young generation now.” The thunderous voice responded.

He spoke humbly but no one dared to underestimate him. The atmosphere became suffocating and oppressive.

“Senior Jialun, your eight slashes are unstoppable. I wish to broaden my horizon by seeing them in action. Please give me pointers.” Others were too afraid to speak but not Terra Sword Saint.

He expressed his will to stand together with Nine-sun Sword Saint regardless of the opponents’ capabilities.

The crowd heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that the two saints had some confidence in dealing with the old beings.

“How commendable. How is Everlasting Sword God doing?” Jialun asked.

Everlasting Sword God was none other than the strongest member of Sword Temple and a member of the Five Overlords.

Amusingly enough, this group actually had six members. This was because of a husband-and-wife pair being listed as a single entity - Sun and Moon Lords. This was necessary because they were always together. The other four were Vastsea Paragon, Earthraiser Vajra, War God, and Everlasting Sword God.

“Thank you for asking, Senior. The sword god is doing well.” Sword Saint cupped his fist.

“Good, I will be visiting him later.” Jialun responded.
