Chapter 5430: I Offer The Last Of My Blood For The People

Illumination Conqueror’s cosmic form made everyone else seem like ants in comparison, the few exceptions being Supreme and his allies who were also in their grand avatar form.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, didn’t activate a grand avatar form and resembled a speck of dust versus the cosmic being.

Nonetheless, he easily took down the conqueror and crushed the galaxy above. When Illumination fell down, weaker cultivators were suddenly thrown into the air. The sky became the ground and the ground became the sky.

“Boom!” Illumination smashed into the ground. This felt as if an ant had managed to flip a colossal elephant over.

Li Qiye jumped on top and unleashed a flurry of regular punches. As for Illumination, his cosmic form seemed rather immobile. Its sheer weight made it difficult for him to get back up.

As Li Qiye rained punches on him, stars that were part of his overarching frames shattered. Pieces fell off like cogs on a machine. Eventually, he reverted to his original size - bloodied and beaten.

He looked pathetic like a plucked and bedraggled chicken, shaking from being cold in the wind - the opposite of his majestic cosmic form.

Not long ago, he was confident in going against four apex conquerors and dao lords. The cosmic form might have been the pinnacle of his life. His appearance and aura left everyone breathless.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye only needed a few seconds and some punches to reduce him to a pathetic state.

From start to finish, Li Qiye appeared to be nonchalant, not relying on any supreme art or treasure. He looked like a child punching randomly but this was enough to render Illumination helpless.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Words couldn’t describe the spectators’ current feelings. The power disparity broke their perception of cultivation realms. They didn’t know whether to hate or pity Illumination after his utter defeat.

They took a deep breath to regain their composure, unable to laugh despite the meteoric drop in Illumination’s circumstances.

“You think you are qualified to save The People?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hahaha…” Illumination still laughed, not letting others know his current emotional state. He could be overwhelmed with fear and rage but he still responded: “No matter how powerful you are, you cannot take away my ambition.”

“You think too highly of yourself, I’m fine with just crushing you.” Li Qiye coldly uttered.

Everyone else watched in silence. Although the victor resembled a mortal, he still managed to defeat Illumination Conqueror.

This was akin to an ant trying to fight against an elephant or a true dragon - an exercise of frustration and futility.

“I will never give up! I will shed the last of my blood and breathe my last breath for The People!” Illumination suddenly roared.

His twelve dao fruits exuded boundless light. Twelve grand dao appeared in a magnificent manner, releasing strands of immortal light.

He fully activated his immortal shell and all of his power and vitality. The world became stabilized again as primordial energy oozed out.

His anima tree appeared as well but he didn’t stop just yet.

“Rumble!” The devil dreamwater containing the strength and vitality of the sacrificed cultivators was still with him. He decided to activate their power as well.
