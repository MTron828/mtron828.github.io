Chapter 5663: Always A Turning Point

The faint outlines of the thirteen palaces pulsed in the darkness. The latter had infected them but couldn’t erase their primal divinity and power.

“Should have been a supreme existence instead of becoming a dark overlord.” South Emperor murmured.

“Yes, a benevolent lord who was the source of an epoch, capable of protecting the realms and their inhabitants.” Li Qiye said.

“Only to fall to the darkness.” South Emperor said with fear, something he would have experienced if it wasn’t for Li Qiye’s interruption.

“This is the consequence of taking shortcuts.” Li Qiye said: “If one has the confidence of resisting the darkness, they don’t need to take shortcuts.”

“I understand.” South Emperor said.

Li Qiye then gazed at the fate palaces and sighed: “Once ferocious and noble, revered by all existences and looked down on conspiring with the other overlords. To be brave enough to fight against the heaven, what a shame.”

“He went on an expedition?” South Emperor said softly.

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded and continued: “The overlords who were dominant once preferred to live a borrowed life in this epoch, devouring other living beings and stealing natural essences. They lurked in the shadows, bidding for the right moment. He, on the other hand, soared up to the firmaments and made them look like fools.”

The image of a wondrous being appeared in South Emperor’s head - a cultivator ready to fight to the very end.

In his ascension, he had only disdain for the overlords, mere insects compared to his nobility.

“Seems like he became the thing he hated the most then.” South Emperor regained his sanity.

“You are at risk as well.” Li Qiye said.

“I am aware, Sacred Teacher.” South Emperor lowered his head. He could have lost his noble appearance and turned into a dark monster as well: “I'd rather die than become darkness.”

“That is true, hence so many heroes along the way, preferring to fight to the end and die instead of turning. They made their choice and maintained their dao heart.” Li Qiye said.

“So what happened to him? Why did he willingly choose the darkness?” South Emperor couldn’t help but ask.

A being who stood above the passage of time and possessed unparalleled strength, pride, nobility, and sanctity - going as far as challenging the high heaven.

As the source of an epoch, what could have convinced him to change? Or was it due to fear?

“There is always a turning point.” Li Qiye shook his head: “He couldn’t suppress his desire and fell into damnation.”

“It only takes a little to ignite desires.” South Emperor knew this too well after his recent experience.

“Becoming an emperor and ancestor is just the beginning. If you can’t hold your ground now, don’t think about becoming an overlord. Of course, overlords falter as well.” Li Qiye said.

Someone who fell during the early stages had no chance of ever reaching the overlord realm.

“Truly a tough road.” South Emperor smiled wryly: “How many emperors and monarchs managed to endure until now?”

“Putting aside older cultivators, Min Ren and Hong Tian are still moving forward.” Li Qiye responded.

South Emperor became emotional and murmured: “Right, Hong Tian had reached it, how shameful of me.”

Putting Min Ren aside, Hong Tian was from the same generation as him and couldn’t compare to his talent.

“Incredible, I hope they will be able to guard long enough for me to catch up and bask in their greatness.” South Emperor said sentimentally.

“You will be able to see Min Ren as long as you improve.” Li Qiye said.

“What realm is Min Ren right now?” South Emperor became excited.

This name was long forgotten by the current world but South Emperor was aware of how great he was.

“You will learn later. Remember, he’s not the most gifted.” Li Qiye said.

“Neither is Hong Tian.” South Emperor responded.

These two were just average in terms of cultivation aptitude compared to the other emperors. This was especially true for Empress Hong Tian.

Nonetheless, they made it so far while one of the ten greatest geniuses such as himself nearly fell into the darkness.

“I have let you down, Sacred Teacher, I’m not deserving of being one of the ten geniuses.” South Emperor lamented.

Li Qiye had taught him in the past but it seemed that he had forgotten previous teachings. He had nothing to be proud of relative to Min Ren or Hong Tian.

“Put in more effort then.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“I understand.” South Emperor saw things more clearly than ever before: “Talent is just superficial, not to be relied on.”

“Good, this means that your hardship was not in vain.” Li Qiye said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Thank you again, Sacred Teacher, for the grace of rebirth.” South Emperor prostrated, feeling enlightened.

Li Qiye smiled and accepted his gesture. Then, he gazed at the thirteen shining palaces and took a step forward.

The darkness seemingly noticed his imposing presence and surged forward, regarding him as a formidable enemy.
