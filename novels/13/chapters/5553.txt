Chapter 5554: Blessed Once More

Li Qiye sighed and said again: “Fate again.”

Having said that, the yin and yang rotated between his palms, forming pulsing dao runes that wouldn’t stop changing.

“Pop!” He took one step forward and caused dao runes to light up beneath his foot. It expanded to the rest of the city and could be seen by all inhabitants.

Ancient runes multiplied and spread beneath their feet, eventually becoming a supreme chapter. Its page supported the city, and the light flowed upward from the ground.

“Zzz…” Once the dao light permeated every inch of ground and space, they began entering the body of the mortals.

“What’s going on?!” They became confused after sensing something flowing within their flesh and bones.

“Ahh!” A wave of pain caused them to bellow in agony and roll on their bed or ground. Mortals had a hard time enduring since this was akin to having hooks latching onto their internal organs and pulling them out.

Eventually, the light exited their body, bringing gray strands with them. The pain immediately dissipated and their diseases disappeared. They found themselves in great health again.

As for the countless strands of gray, they had nowhere to hide. Those acting as parasites in mortals or other creatures or even just the land were dragged out by the supreme chapter.

“Boom!” The gray strands came together as if fully cognizant of the danger. The amalgamation leaped into the air, wanting to flee.

Unfortunately, the entire city was covered by a barrier formed by the supreme chapter. It smashed into the runic barrier and couldn’t break through.

“Clank!” It exploded into sharp rays, wanting to cut an opening.

Li Qiye snorted and raised his hand, forming an overwhelming palm of power. It successfully contained the blast without any difficulty.

He then used his dao flame to burn the gray amalgamation before dispelling the barrier. Bright particles scattered downward.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“The deities, they didn’t abandon us!” Mortals became emotional after seeing this.

They only had one explanation for this - the deities have returned to protect them.

“The Deities of Cleansing are still here to protect us!” They had no idea that someone else had destroyed the gray monster and removed their ailments.

Nonetheless, this supernatural phenomenon wasn’t strange to the inhabitants of Momentous Frontier for they were devout believers.

This was considered a divine miracle from the Deities of Cleansing.

“We are blessed once more, there is nothing to fear.” They prostrated in the direction of the temples, offering prayers and worship to the deities.

“Neigh!” A black horse could be seen back in the main temple. The statues glowed once more with divinity.

The prayers of the mortals only increased their divinity, eventually channeling into the horse.

“We meet again.” Li Qiye smiled, having seen the real horse back in the nine worlds.

“This is Immortal Emperor Bu Si’s mount.” Niu Fen stared at the horse statue and said.

“Thank you for your help, Young Noble. You are our savior.” Qin Baifeng regained her wits and prostrated, displaying gratitude in everyone’s stead.

“I am just a passerby who is here at the right time. The real savior is Momentous Dao created by the deities, all I did was activate it.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

Guo Cheng was overwhelmed emotionally, thinking that Li Qiye’s method just now was immortal-like.

“Protector! The general from West Bank wants to kill the divine ox!” A cultivator from Momentous Dao ran in and shouted anxiously.
