Chapter 5209: Same Name

The four grand alliances, Pure Land, Azure Peak, Cleansing Incense Dynasty, Azure School, Suppression Conqueror, Immensity Conqueror, Imperial Attendant represented by Alchemy Dao and the others, and Immortal Emperor Yao Zu took up twelve spots, leaving one behind.

All eyes were on the remaining throne. Although many big shots and ancestors wanted to participate, they knew that they didn’t have the power to take the seat. Plus, would they even have the resources to actually be competitive during the auction?

In fact, the dominating Suppression Conqueror was a clear underdog compared to the other bidders.

“Clank!” A sword as black as ink suddenly landed on the remaining throne, releasing evil energy.

It started melting the space nearby and created an evil maelstrom.

“Malice!” Experts recognized this sword and shouted.

“Yes, it is I.” A figure dressed in black appeared in the sky. His robe was tattered and worn out due to an unknown power. He looked like a god of death ready to reap on all inhabitants in Imperial Attendant.

“Don’t look straight at him or you’ll be infected.” The big shots warned their juniors.

Unfortunately, not all were so lucky. Weaker cultivators who stared at him for too long were drawn toward his eyes.

“Ahh!” They fell straight to the ground after being swallowed by his evil aura.

“Why does it feel like I’m not welcomed here?” Malice sneered at sat down on a throne, the first to actually do so.

“What does he want?” The crowd despised the evil swordsman. He was a reaper of souls, subjecting his victims to a fate worse than death. Alas, he had eleven sacred fruits so most couldn’t deal with him.

“Scram!” Another cultivator demanded Malice to leave - a girl in a white dress; her face covered by a veil.

It had an illusory factor to hide her appearance, causing her to look like a blurry shadow.

Dragon lords and conquerors took a deep breath after sensing her murderous intent. Weaker cultivators instantly dropped to the ground. No one could ever get close to her since that would be suicidal.

“Jue Xian’er…” A big shot murmured after seeing the white phantom. [1]

“Conqueror Jue Xian’er!” A youth shouted. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Don’t ever address her as a conqueror or she’ll kill you.” A senior immediately warned.

This name evoked fear and dread; the four alliances were no exception. Rumor has it that she didn’t appreciate being addressed as a “conqueror” and might even kill violators.

“There are two Jue Xian’er, right?” The youth whispered.

His senior turned pale and covered his mouth before answering: “Do not speak of this again or she’ll really kill you.”

In reality, this was indeed the case. There were two famous cultivators sharing this name in the upper continents, Conqueror Jue Xian’er and her mother. She chose to inherit her mother’s name.

Her father was Righteous Dao Lord from Eight Desolaces - a rather brilliant dao lord. Her mother stood out even more - a genius dragon lord with twelve sacred fruits capable of fighting against any emperor and conqueror.

During her era, she actually outshined Supreme. Today, Supreme was considered the strongest dragon lord but if she were alive, that position would be hers.

The love between Righteous and Jue Xian’er should have been celebrated for generations. Unfortunately, the two became enemies during Imperial War. They both fell in battle, leaving their daughter behind.

Who knows what the orphan experienced while being all alone? When she made her dao debut, she eventually became a conqueror with the help of a weapon known as Immortal Piercer. [2]

No one could survive the moment she summoned it in battle. Thus, most avoided fighting her since they didn’t want to be trapped by this special chain.

Her most illustrious battle took place in Heaven Alliance. She came alone, demanding her mother’s remains. Even Supreme couldn’t stop her.
