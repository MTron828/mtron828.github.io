Chapter 5217: Never Leaving

Li Qiye moved up the steps and checked the murals instead of answering right away. After a short while, he answered: “There’s nothing special.”

He then touched the mural in front of him and traced the lines before letting out a sigh. This mural depicted the calamity of when gigantic corpses fell from the sky. The warriors in the mural fought valiantly just to stay alive.

“Do not touch it!” Divine Hawk Monarch bellowed, not allowing the blatant violation of the rules.

Li Qiye turned back and coldly uttered: “Fools, you have already been given ample warning yet you choose otherwise. So be it, all members of Hundred Dao in Imperial Gate shall die today.”

The crowd clamored after hearing this. The monarch’s expression became unsightly due to the public declaration. They needed to make an example out of him to maintain order.

“Let’s go then!” The monarch shouted.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The guards nearby rushed over and form a grand formation.

“A fight!” Everyone understood that Li Qiye was here to cause trouble. They saw Saintess Shao Yao next to him and could see that this was a political move.

“Screech!” The formation finished and turned into a divine bird with sky-blotting wings.

“Die!” The monarch took charge of the formation and sent the bird against Li Qiye.

Li Qiye simply traced the mural in front of him again. Suddenly, all the murals on the cliffs lit up and opened a portal in the air.

“Ahh!” A beam descended and obliterated the grand formation. Members of Divine Hawk started falling to the ground.

The beam split into rays that shoot outward like energy arrows, piercing the head of the targets. Blood started splashing all over the murals and the steps.

The monarch himself didn’t have a chance to retaliate since he was killed just like the rest. His body fell backward and smashed into the ground.

Their mission was to subdue Imperial Gate. After all, they couldn’t actually do anything to Imperial Gate or it would start a political upheaval.

Alas, not a single survivor could be found after just a few seconds.

“What the hell was that?” Spectators didn’t see Li Qiye do anything outside of just touching one mural.

“Yes!” Those from Imperial Gate cheered because they were practically prisoners in their own sect.

“You figured something out, Young Noble.” Ye Fantian’s eyes became as bright as the stars: “I’ve been looking at the war-focused murals and knew that there were heavenly dao in them, is that what you borrowed?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Your talent is impressive.” Li Qiye said.

“Could you teach me how to do that as well?” She asked.

Everyone’s jaw dropped to the ground.

“Did I hear that right, Ye Fantian needing someone to teach her?” One expert whispered.

Currently, Ye Fantian was considered to be the most gifted in the upper continents. Only an apex conqueror such as Sword Sea Dao Lord was qualified to teach her.

Amusingly enough, those who had spent time teaching her lamented the fact that they would run out of things after a year or so - a testament to her immaculate talent.

Therefore, it seemed ridiculous that she would ask a random cultivator for guidance. Moreover, her expression was one of admiration and respect.

“No.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“What a shame.” She became disappointed but still bowed: “Nonetheless, that heavenly dao did spark something within me. You have my gratitude.”

Li Qiye sighed, appreciating the talent before him before suggesting: “Leave Divine Alliance and you may follow me to learn the dao.”

“Preposterous.” Xiao Qingtian couldn’t help but blurt out. He then took another look at Li Qiye.

As a dragon lord with twelve fruits, he still thought that Ye Fantian was still superior at dao comprehension despite her current cultivation. He was also aware of what the apex conquerors thought of her.

“Does he really think he can be Ye Fantian’s master?” The crowd members talked among themselves.

“Maybe he can teach her a thing or two, but he’s trying to poach the jewel of Divine Alliance.” A big shot said.

Divine Alliance’s emperors and conquerors had tried their best to train her. Thus, Li Qiye’s attempt was nothing short of a declaration of war.

Ye Fantian herself was surprised for a second. She then regained her wits and bowed deeply: “I appreciate your kind intent but I was born in Divine Alliance and will not leave.”

“What a shame, but I suppose if I destroy Divine Alliance, you will have to follow me then.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“!!!” This shocked the crowd even more.

“Watch your mouth!” A member of Divine Alliance shouted.

Some of them prepared for battle and approached Li Qiye. However, Ye Fantian told them to back off. They had no choice but to oblige.

“Young Noble, please refrain from making these remarks. I wish to stay with Divine Alliance.” She said.

“I suppose that’s the end of this.” Li Qiye smiled and moved onward.

The imperial bridge awaited after crossing through the steps surrounded by the murals. Next were the eighteen images of the dragon lord's realm.

This bridge was created by Suppression Conqueror. He said that it was a test of dao comprehension but in reality, it was to prevent Imperial Gate’s disciples from looking at their legacies.

“Young Noble, are you planning on crossing the imperial bridge?” Xiao Qingtian was drawn to Li Qiye so he asked: “The eighteen images are definitely worth taking a look at.”

“The young noble is interested for sure.” Ye Fantian said: “But the problem is that Suppression Conqueror’s seal is incredible. I cannot cross the bridge given my current cultivation.”

“The seal is impressive but it does not pose a challenge to me.” Xiao Qingtian laughed and said: “I will attempt it so that you can watch, Miss Ye.”
