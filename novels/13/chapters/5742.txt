Chapter 5743: The Choice Is Yours

“You’re finally here!” Everyone became excited after his arrival since he could solve the issue with the celestial river.

Moreover, he made them more confident about their chances of beating Celestial Court.

“Sacred Teacher, please lead the campaign, we will follow your orders.” Sindragon said loudly.

“What I plan to do, I can do alone. The question is, do you all wish to fight?” Li Qiye shook his head.

“We do.” Everyone said with certainty since they came for the destruction of Celestial Court.

The conflict had lasted for too long. Now, they finally gathered here and were given a rare opportunity with Li Qiye around.

“This ends with us, we shall not leave it to the future generation.” Chi Ye said: “Difficult it may be, it is our responsibility to overcome it.”

“Let our generation end this!” Others agreed with his comment.

Letting go of this chance meant more wars in the future. Who knows how long this would last? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Well said.” Li Qiye nodded: “Difficulties started here and they shall be resolved here, leaving no burden for future generations and relying on no one else, especially not a savior. When one depends on others, they are entrusting their fate to others, that is contrary to our dao.”

“Amitabha, thank you for the lesson, Sacred Teacher. Enlighten the self first before enlighten others, looks like I have strayed from the proper path.” Meru placed his palms together and said.

Everyone understood and gazed at the celestial river again; their eyes became more determined.

“If you wish to continue, I will help you cross the river. Otherwise, go back.” Li Qiye said.

“Buzz.” Primordial strands appeared and seemingly opened another world. Laws twisted together while everyone watched with bated breath.

They have obtained anima and its power but the primordial affinity still broadened their horizon. They saw a door leading to a new realm.

Emperors, especially those at the apex classification, felt that they had reached the end of the grand dao. Of course, they knew that this was far from the truth.

Unfortunately, they couldn’t see what was after the dao limit, unable to come up with a way to break through.

Witnessing Li Qiye’s primordial laws was a dao lesson of sorts. Although Li Qiye didn’t actively play the part of a teacher, everyone sat down on the ground and meditated. Anima and true fate appeared as they attempted to learn.

The primordial was distant and unreachable but observing this gave them a connection to the next step - building a foundation for their dao limit break.

Some of them had the potential to break through on their own, becoming Ancestors and overlords in due time. Now, Li Qiye showed them the mystical possibilities, planting primordial rays within their mind.

“Rumble!” The laws pulsed brightly and formed an expanse of light.

Particles descended on the emperors as they closed their eyes and shut down their defenses. The most talented ones could resonate with this affinity and felt the dao limit holding them down loosening.

A primordial ship emerged from the expanse and fell onto the river without sinking.

Li Qiye patted it and smiled: “I have created a ship capable of traversing the celestial river for you all.”

He then stared at them and said: “This is only the start of the grand dao. This one decision will determine the rest of your life.”

“What about you, Sacred Teacher? Will you attack Celestial Court with us?” Immortal Emperor Chen Xue asked.

“That’s a personal issue for me, a path that I walk regardless of your decision. The same applies to you as well, pick your path now just like how you had chosen to side with The People back then instead.” Li Qiye answered.

Everyone exchanged glances after hearing this.

“I have some business with the celestial river, we will meet later.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, Sacred Teacher.” Everyone bowed.

“I will take you, Sacred Teacher.” Meru Buddhist Emperor brought his boat over.

Li Qiye accepted and boarded the tiny boat.

“I’ll be going ahead.” Meru bid goodbye to the emperors and began the journey.

Everyone watched their departure. They were here to attack Celestial Court, the same for Li Qiye. However, he didn’t come with them.

Their attention shifted to the primordial ship - this could take them to the other side. Alas, the full force of Celestial Court awaited them - one far stronger than the previous army.

The apex cultivators who had fought Celestial Court for eras understood its true power and resources.
