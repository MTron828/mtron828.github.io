Chapter 4389: Choice

Though the duo left Phoenix Ground without facing any resistance, this didn’t mean Dragon Platform and Tiger Pond would let this go. Thus, their location was always known.

However, she had no intention of leaving the city or betraying Dragon. Therefore, she didn’t try to hide her location along the way.

A few disciples wanted to be risky for contribution points. After all, capturing either would be a noteworthy achievement. The sect and Peacock Monarch would recognize them for sure.

“Li Qiye is over there!” Many of them immediately shouted the moment they saw the duo.

A dozen or so disciples surrounded the two. They had qualms going against Jian Qingzhu so they only called out Li Qiye’s name.

Li Qiye only smiled while she glared at them.

“What do you think you’re doing?” She coldly uttered.

They exchanged glances; none dared to step forward. She was still the current saintess of Dragon, still as prestigious as ever.

Moreover, who among them could actually beat her? All of them here might not be able to win.

“Senior Sister, we-we’re not here to trouble you. We only wish to capture him because that’s the sect master’s order.” One of them said without confidence.

“Do you know what you’re saying? This is ridiculous, are you stronger than Bear King?” She chastised.

“I…” The first disciple had no response.

One female disciple wasn’t convinced and fought back: “Junior Sister, you speak as if you’re not a disciple of Dragon. You are siding with an outsider against your fellow sect members, are you trying to rebel…”

“Know your place.” She unleashed a fiery palm strike with haste.

The female disciple became startled and hurriedly blocked the strike. Alas, she wasn’t fast enough and a print could be seen on her cheek.

“You!” She was furious after being humiliated by the slap.

Qingzhu glared at her and said: “If I wasn’t holding back, all of you would be corpses on the ground right now.”

In reality, she was saving them by acting harshly. If she didn’t take the initiative, Li Qiye would be forced to act.

What would be the result? All of them would be laying in a puddle of their own blood. Li Qiye wasn’t one to show mercy and certainly didn’t mind killing more disciples from Dragon. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Forget about capturing anyone with your skills, get out of my way right now.” She continued.

The group exchanged glances. They came in a hurry and didn’t have a plan in the slightest. Qingzhu’s words made them calm down quite a bit.

As for Li Qiye, he watched with a smile and had no intention of interfering.

Eventually, the group slowly stepped aside and made way for the duo. Qingzhu didn’t say anything else and moved on with Li Qiye.

“What should we do now?” One disciple asked while watching the departing duo. They had no plan because Jian Qingzhu alone was far stronger.

“Should we report this to the elders?” One of them suggested.

“They already know, it’s a matter of taking action or not.” Another responded.

“We should go find First Brother, he can do it.” Someone from Tiger Pond said.

Many eyes lit up after hearing this.

“You’re right, let’s find Senior Brother Celestial Tiger.” The others nodded in agreement: “Since the elders do not wish to interfere, he’s the only one who can fight Senior Sister Jian.”

Jian Qingzhu headed for a mountain range inside the city, clearly aware of where to find Ancient Pheasant.

“Are you sure that this Ancient Pheasant can take care of this mess?” Li Qiye seemed amused.

She halted her step and nodded: “Yes, he is one of the three ancient demons and has considerable influence in our sect. Peacock Monarch and the other ancestors wouldn’t be able to push the issue.”

“He’s only one of the three. How do you know the other two ancient demons are on your side?” He asked.

“Well…” Qingzhu had no response. Ancient Pheasant was from Phoenix Ground but the other two came from Tiger Pond and Dragon Platform.

She understood this and responded: “The three ancient ancestors have experienced the ups and downs of life. They are more insightful than us.”

She hoped that they would have a different opinion of Li Qiye and wouldn’t be swayed by the current political struggle. This was the reason why she wanted Li Qiye to meet one of them.

“I’m afraid age isn’t a good indicator of wisdom. This applies to power as well.” He said: “The existences from the darkness are strong and old, not necessarily wise though. Therefore, making the right choice can be the deciding factor rather than wisdom.”

“Hmm?” She didn’t get the point right away.

“It is a contest between your intuition and their own branch. I hope they’re as wise as you think they are.” He smiled.

She didn’t respond this time because she knew very little about the three ancient ancestors.

“What do you think we should do then, Young Noble?” She asked after a moment of silence.

“My method is naturally different from yours. I’ll have to make a trip to Dragon Platform and Tiger Pond eventually since I need some things there. If they hand them over, I’ll leave. Otherwise, I’ll take them myself.”

Though Li Qiye was being vague, she could still envision the carnage already.

“However, keep on trying. I don’t mind accompanying you since I’m bored anyway.” He added.
