Chapter 5736: Break Your Armor Again

“Rumble!” Stars in the expanse shook violently from the unceasing barrages. Top cultivators held back no longer, unleashing their destructive potential.

If this battle were to take place in the immortal continent, the realm would shatter cataclysmically. Fortunately, the expanse of Celestial Court could accommodate their battle without involving mortals and the external world.

A particular monarch dominated the battlefield. She possessed a bestial aura just like that of a primal beast. It intimidated and swept weaker cultivators flying.

“Raa!” A true dragon surged forward, breaking through ten million miles and slamming into stars. Its sharp claws could separate heaven and earth, making it easier for devourment.

Its target was none other than Heaven Burial Conqueror.

“Clank!” The dragon opened its bloody jaws and aimed straight for his throat. A sharp gleam could be seen from a spear tip within the beast’s mouth. Its sharpness and power couldn’t be stopped.

“Whoosh!” Heaven Burial scowled and sent a divine ring to coil around the dragon. It tightened and trapped the beast, revealing its true form as a draconic spear.

The spear appeared delicate and seemed to be crafted from polished white jade, the spearhead included. It flickered with a snow-white glow, capable of slicing throats. Its sharpness intimidated other combatants, rendering them helpless.

Its master was a female monarch with a fiery aura. She wore a phoenix armor decorated with scales and shoulder wings. It looked like a phoenix was spreading its wings to protect her.

Its light granted her both heightened strength and defensive potential on top of making her look superior to all living beings.

It couldn’t conceal her pride-worthy curves either - elegant and dazzling to all spectators. Her physique elicited gasps of admiration but none dared to stare for too long due to her imposing aura.

Her bright and sharp eyes shined like divine blades, sending shivers down one’s spine with a single glance.

“Immortal Monarch Fengying, long time no see.” Heaven Burial chuckled and said. [1] 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Having said that, Heaven Burial’s hand seemingly disappeared before showing up again behind Fengying.

“Boom!” A total of nine rings coiled around his arms, wielding the power of the nine firmaments. The devastating attack was not dodgeable.

“Screech!” Her phoenix armor released the phoenix affinity. The primal mysteries of this bird appeared and created an ancient symbol, “Virtue”.

The blast from the impact forced many emperors to retreat from the area. Nonetheless, the primal symbol successfully stopped the strike from an apex cultivator.

There was no sign of damage on the phoenix armor.

“I broke your dragon armor back then, now it’s time to break this phoenix armor as well.” Heaven Burial laughed and declared tyrannically.

“Feel free to try.” Fengying wrestled her spear out of the seal to perform a fatal thrust.

A beam shot out of the speartip straight at Heaven Burial’s head but the massive divine ring behind him immediately re-positioned to block it.

“Bam!” Stars nearby exploded from the fiery sparks.

He retaliated by sending a smaller divine ring at her with the force of a tsunami, wielding both incalculable weight and might.

1. This monarch has the same title as her actual name, meaning Phoenix Shadow/image/form. I updated a few instances of her title in the older chapters, but I might have missed one or two. Will be using Fengying for her title ?
