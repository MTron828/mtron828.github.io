Chapter 4754: Fighting Alone

A stark contrast appeared as the small figure stood in front of two majestic beings.

People finally saw that the newcomer was a girl only around ten years of age.

These two monarchs together could massacre a whole region. Both gods and devils trembled before them. Thus, this sight didn’t make any sense to the crowd.

The two of them didn’t expect this development either as they stared intensely at her.

“Who is she?” Confusion struck spectators.

None of them had the courage and determination to face the monarchs. However, she herself seemed ready to fight the two of them. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This was a hilarious sight - a little girl wanting to fight two apex beings? For some strange reason, people felt as if this wasn’t a problem. Something about her told them that she could actually take them on.

“I have no idea who she is.” Someone murmured.

On the other side, Jian Ming and the daoist immediately recognized her. Jian Ming said: “The lady is different somehow.”

She was none other than Xiao Xuan who left several days ago, showing zero sign of fear while facing Enveloping and Six-dao.

“Who is his?” Golden Fist Emperor wondered.

“State your name!” Six-dao’s voice brimming with divinity came from above.

“Scram!” Xiao Xuan loudly shouted.

Listeners became dizzy instantly; some felt their soul leaving their body. They couldn’t believe that this little girl dared to raise her voice at the monarchs.

“Boom!” That wasn’t the only thing since she started gathering power.

Her radiance illuminated the nine firmaments and instantly forced everyone to close their eyes. A power crossed through the river of time and seemingly lifted everyone off the ground.

The crowd was horrified after losing control but in the next second, her light and power suddenly disappeared.

They opened their eyes and didn’t see the girl or the two monarchs.

“What?” This left them confused.

If only the girl was gone, they would have assumed that the two monarchs have reduced her to dust. However, they were gone too. There was no chance of both sides dying after the first exchange.

“Look!” An ancestor with his gaze activated noticed something up in the air.

Deep in the stars in the infinite expanse were three tiny figures pulsing. Occasionally, bright flashes emanated near them. Due to the incalculable distance, it could have been planets and suns exploding.

“What the hell is going on?” The crowd realized that there was an intense fight happening far away.

Even ancient ancestors couldn’t witness the epic battle due to the distance.

“That must be another dimension, perhaps the coordinates of an ancient battlefield.” A great demon king said with uncertainty.

“Yes, virtually unreachable. I don’t know about the exact distance though. It could be quite near us but separated by numerous space-time dimensions.” A different lord added.

“Regardless of the location, are you seeing this? That little girl is fighting Six-dao and Enveloping Monarch alone.” One clan ancestor couldn’t believe it. This defied logic and reason.

Meanwhile, the contest didn’t stop on the ground.

“Ah!” One sovereign couldn’t handle the pressure and screamed before being reduced to blood.

“It’s breaking.” Spectators focused on the heavenly bulwark again and saw numerous cracks. Li Qiye still had absolute control over the fight.

“The conquerors will die if there is no more reinforcement.” A big shot murmured.

“Buzz.” Some guessed correctly since they saw the sky turning dark.

The night curtain replaced everything and had an ocean of stars. Their light added a sacred and interesting glow to all living beings beneath.

They then immediately came together to form a divine throne surrounded by galaxies. The flow of the stars brought the throne to the battlefield.

Upon closer inspection, spectators saw a wizened old man sitting on it, clearly the master of this invasive cosmo. Every breath seemed to be his last.

He wore a magnificent robe - each thread seemed to be made from the light of planets. Ordinary ancestors certainly didn’t have access to something so luxurious. When he opened his eyes, an unbearable radiance gushed out.
