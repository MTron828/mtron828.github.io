“Rumble!” Continuous explosions resounded. Both the three ancestors and the cabinet were far-removed from Nine-linked Mountains, but this distance was nothing to characters of their level.

All eyes were on Li Qiye since he was their target.

Would he fight or not? This became the question on everyone’s mind.

“There’s no way he’ll do it, right?” One person tried his best to lower his voice, afraid that Li Qiye would hear him.

Li Qiye’s might was unquestionable after taking down one big shot after another. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, the supreme ancestors have terrorized the system for several generations, not to mention the unfathomable Sacred Cabinet.

This alliance was impossible to gauge; few in the world could actually oppose them. Their abilities were the reason why Lucidity King didn’t destroy the five ancestors in the past.

“No, I still think the king is untouchable.” One expert mused and said slowly: “He’s unfathomable and probably hasn’t shown us his real strength. An all-out move from him will be unimaginable.”

“But you can say the same about the three supreme ancestors and Sacred Cabinet. Their move is going to be earth-shattering too.” Someone else quietly said.

“Just wait and see.” Another ancestor said: “The outcome will be clear soon. This battle will determine the directions and fate of Nine Secrets.”

The crowd slightly jolted, realizing the significance of this upcoming fight.

If the king were to lose, there would be a contest for supremacy between three sects, perhaps a stalemate. The opposite scenario would be a tyrant even more imperious than Lucidity King.

Li Qiye still had a smile on his face, seemingly unperturbed.

As the storm approaches, the cave entrance beneath Great Desolate Mountain suddenly trembled ever so slightly. It became dimmed, on the verge of disappearing.

Everyone was focused on the three ancestors and Sacred Cabinet right now so no one cared about the prison. In fact, the change was too minuscule to be spotted in the first place.

“Nevermind, I’m busy now, no time to play with you all.” Li Qiye’s eyes turned towards the prison before he laughed and leaped into the sky.

“What is he doing?” This stunned the crowd.

“Boom!” A deafening blast quaked the entire mountain range as if a world barrier has just been broken.

They saw Li Qiye landing down and jumping into the Great Desolate Heavenly Prison.

The entrance looked like the bloody jaw of a primal beast. He jumped into the darkness and was swallowed up.

“Careful-” Liu Chuqing felt her heart hanging on a string because of this sudden development.

Bingchi Hanyu hurriedly supported her while feeling the same astonishment.

Everyone became stunned. Who could have expected this move from Li Qiye?

They all knew that there was no leaving this prison, regardless of how strong and mighty one was. It was eternal damnation - no coming back out, death without a grave.

Lucidity King has thrown numerous powerful foes into this prison and they were never seen again. Remember, his foes were mighty, starting at least from the Eternal level.

Alas, these Eternals still disappeared into this prison. These tales built up a grim scene for the prison.

The issue here was that no one forced Li Qiye to do so. This seemingly suicidal act made jaws drop to the ground. People stared towards the prison with their mouth wide open.

“Is, is he insane and suicidal? Why did he jump into Great Desolate Heavenly Prison?” Someone stammered.

Some didn’t believe their own eyes. Everything was arguably fine yet the king chose to enter the prison.

“Maybe, maybe he’s afraid of the alliance?” Another speculated.

“No way.” An old expert shook his head: “The guy kills without batting an eye, he’s afraid of no one. Plus, if it stemmed from fear, why the hell would he jump into the prison?”

Everyone agreed with this logic. Even if he couldn’t take on the three ancestors, he still probably could go all out and escape from them. However, jumping into the prison would end with nothing but his death.

The crowd continued speculating but no one could come up with an answer.

At least dying in a battle or in another place would leave him with his corpse and potentially a grave, unlike suffering an unknown fate in the prison.

“I’m sure he has his reasons.” A wise ancestor said.

“Reasons my ass.” One shook his head: “There is no way to justify suiciding like that. All of his plans and reasons are useless because he is going to die in there.”

The ancestor had no response since the guy made sense too. No one in history has managed to leave the prison.

“This is an impulsive choice indeed. He should have waited to see the development.” He relented.

“Rumble!” The three ancestors and the cabinet made it to Nine-linked Mountains a while after Li Qiye’s jump.

They stared at the pitch-black entrance of the prison and became confused. They came prepared to fight to the death with Li Qiye, but now, it looked as if their effort has gone to waste.

They were sufficiently prepared, both mentally and strategically yet the moment they got to the battlefield, their opponent instantly committed suicide. Losing this goal caught them off guard, not knowing how to proceed.

The supreme ancestors looked at each other. Should they jump into the prison to follow him?

Of course, they weren’t that crazy. Unlike the rest of the crowd, they have personally seen the mighty existences who were thrown into the prison by Lucidity King. This prison left a deep impression on them.

“Wait for a bit.” An ancient voice came from the cabinet.

The three ancestors had no other option and decided to land on the ground, waiting.

There was another pair of eyes observing the whole thing - Southpeak Woodcutter.

The smoke from his tobacco pipe shrouded his aged face. Nevertheless, his eyes were still as bright as ever.

“Maybe a miracle will happen. Does that prison really contain the secrets to immortality?” He murmured as he puffed out rings of smoke.

He watched without blinking once, really hoping for Li Qiye to come back alive since he was curious about the prison’s secrets as well.
