Chapter 4489: Two Saints

“The two saints together make the heavenly dao a no bother.” Jian Ming praised while looking at the statues.

“You’re aware of this old children's rhyme?” The worker found this surprising.

“Yes, it is not from our epoch.” Jian Ming nodded: “Nonetheless, Saint Miao and the martial saint’s prestige remain. The two ladies and their legion swept through the realms and changed the landscape of the world.”

The worker looked as if he had just found his best friend. He enthusiastically said: “Perfectly said, Sir. Our two saints are indeed from an immemorial period but their influence can still be felt. Saint Miao’s strategy is unmatched. Her grand dao helped billions and billions. The martial saint was unstoppable, capable of crushing the stars with a single stomp. According to the legends, their legion represented justice.”

“I can’t disagree. Peerless dao and boundless power.” Jian Ming continued: “Although your two saints weren’t around after the calamity, their legion still dominated for a long period before eventually disappearing.”

Having said that, he paused a bit before continuing: “Otherwise, your Grotto Courtyard would be doing more than just doing business to make money.”

In the present day, only their members knew about the two saints, the majority of whom couldn’t say much about the actual tales and achievements since so much time had passed.

Nonetheless, the two saints’ influence helped their grotto have a strong foundation. Unfortunately, their wealth and power weren’t enough to represent their actual clan. After all, their real branch might no longer be here in Eight Desolaces. Alas, they have toiled for generations now and still took pride in their history.

“Among the duo, Saint Miao is one step greater.” The daoist suddenly said.

“What makes you say that, Sir?” The worker asked. In the grotto, they viewed both ancestors equally.

Jian Ming glanced at the daoist and argued again: “What the hell do you know? The martial saint led their legion, one that still dominated after the great calamity.”

“That’s a shallow perspective. Who was the strategist with perfect calculations? Who trained each general and soldier? This is why Saint Miao is spectacular. She had a sacred bloodline and most importantly, her wisdom and cultivation are superior to the martial saint.” The daoist retorted.

The friendship between these two didn’t last long. Nonetheless, Jian Ming couldn’t come up with a response.

“Seems logical.” The worker interjected.

“That’s a one-sided statement, mere speculations.” Jian Ming questioned.

“When Saint Miao was still in our world, she came to ask our forefather for a fortune.” The daoist coldly uttered.

“Really?” Jian Ming didn’t dare to underestimate the daoist’s heaven-defying forefather.

“What question did she have?” He calmed down and asked.

The daoist was pleased to see the guy’s curiosity. He said: “Regarding a person first and then the immortal dao.”

“A person and the immortal dao?” Listeners took a deep breath.

How many in history dared to ask about the immortal dao? Just the heavenly dao was tough enough, let alone the next. The world simply didn’t know if a dao to reach immortality was possible or not.

“Who is the person?” Jian Ming noticed the peculiarity: “If she asked about the person first… does that mean that this person is on the immortal path?”

“Does such a person exist?” The worker became startled.

Because of Saint Miao’s wisdom, the need to ask another person for help showed that her question was above her own ability. Given her cultivation, asking about the immortal dao was understandable. This might just be the next step for her to reach the apex. However, she asked about a person first, meaning that this person was even more important to her.

“Sounds like she was asking about an immortal.” Jian Ming became emotional.

Everyone’s ears became bigger since they wanted to hear more about this topic.

“That I am not sure about since this was something from the previous epoch. There are no writings and the forefather didn’t leave an explanation behind.” The daoist shook his head.

“There’s nothing about the fortune-telling session too?” Wise asked.

They couldn’t help but be interested in this top-secret conversation regarding the immortal dao. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Nothing.” The daoist said: “Plus, there was no way anything from the session would be written down about this taboo matter.”

“How frightening…” Jian Ming murmured and started fantasizing. Due to his previous experience with a certain place, he had seen many things unknown to the rest of the world. Alas, he knew to keep his mouth shut this time around.

“We might be talking about an immortal here.” Wise blurted.

At this time, Li Qiye finally stopped looking at the statues and joined in: “No, the world can’t withstand the weight of an immortal.”

The group agreed with him. It’s just that they were too curious about the person in this case. Alas, these secrets have been buried in the river of time. It was impossible to find the answer.

“Is your trident still around?” Li Qiye asked.

“Well…” The worker couldn’t answer: “I’m afraid a regular disciple such as myself doesn’t know the answer to your question.”

“Haha, you would have to ask Seal Ancestor.” Jian Ming laughed: “The old man knows everything here, he might be spying on us right now from the bottom of the lake.”

“Know when not to talk.” Wise scolded.

Jian Ming ignored him and continued: “It’s no secret that he has eyes everywhere in Grotto Courtyard. It wouldn’t be surprising in the slightest.”
