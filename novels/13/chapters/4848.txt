Chapter 4849: Eight-stallion Knights

“Go.” He activated its laws and commanded the seal to wrap around Li Qiye’s neck instead.

The chain was made from laws. No one could take it off without his permission. He seemed rather happy while staring at Li Qiye: “Hahaha, this will be interesting.”

“Ugh!” Having said that, he spat out a mouthful of blood and fell backward.

“I have… no regrets.” He looked at the sky with a smile before slowly closing his eyes.

This was the death of a dao lord. He had dominated and engraved himself into history. Alas, everything had an end.

“Quite an interesting fella.” Li Qiye sighed while staring at the group before sitting back down.

The dao lord left in peace, no longer holding grudges or hatred. He came to this world with nothing and left with nothing.

Unfortunately, no friends or family were with him during his last moment, only a stranger.

“Rumble!” Loud explosions and dust could be seen on the horizon due to an incoming cavalry.

Their armor was made from expensive metal. These elites traveled fast and still maintained a uniform pace. Their banners belonged to Eight-stallion Dynasty.

This was the dao lord’s guardsmen cavalry. He recruited them after starting the dynasty. They followed him as he attempted to bring peace to Chaos. Their contributions were rather significant.

This flood of steel was led by a white-haired old man with a tough-looking beard. Saber intents pulsed in his eyes.

Sure enough, his weapon of choice was the saber. He appeared always ready to fight even with the saber still sheathed.

Firerage Saber - the commander of the imperial guard and cavalry. He was one of the dao lord’s earliest followers - a trusted confidante.

Their relationship was highly praised and celebrated - that the saber was ready to die for his lord.

“Your Majesty!” He saw the corpse and dropped to his knees, sobbing.

“Your Majesty!” Other guards cried out in sorrow.

Their lord was special, always treating them like friends and brothers. They have fought together on numerous battlefields, trusting each other with their lives.

Today, they felt powerless since they couldn’t help him or avenge him. Moreover, he forbade them from doing so.

After all, fighting Conceal Conqueror was akin to moths heading for the fire - a meaningless action.

“Your Majesty, we will bring you back home.” Firerage embraced the corpse and wept.

The guards prostrated and ceremonially kowtowed. They prepared the corpse in a respectful manner for the journey.

Amusingly enough, they had a coffin ready. They placed the corpse inside and closed the lid tightly.

This coffin was purchased by Eight-stallion Dao Lord before the battle and handed over to Firerage. He knew that his death was inevitable.

Thus, he prepared his funeral arrangements and told Firerage to come afterward. He could have ran away and Conceal would never be able to do anything to him. Alas, he chose to face death fearlessly.

“You are…?” Firerage turned his attention to Li Qiye after taking care of the corpse. He didn’t understand why this youth found His Majesty’s resting place.

However, the moment he noticed the hanging seal, his expression shifted completely. “Let me take a look”.

When he touched it, a buzz sounded and out came the power of a dao lord.

“His Majesty bestowed it to you?” Firerage couldn’t believe it.

“Indeed, he told me to go play in Eight-stallion Dynasty.” Li Qiye nodded, not thinking that this was a big deal.

The others stared at the two in confusion. Firerage pondered this matter. As Eight-stallion’s personal guard, few understood the dao lord better than him.

He didn’t pass the seal down to Northern Monarch or Venerable Dragon God, not his daughter either. He picked a stranger instead of his family - something rather illogical.

He knew all of the dao lord’s acquaintances. This person was not one of them. Of course, His Majesty was never one to adhere to conventional wisdom.

Most importantly, this stranger couldn’t have gotten the seal off the corpse due to the chain laws. Ultimately, it meant that the dao lord has passed on his system to this stranger. Was this just a coincidence or planned?

“Commander.” One member quietly woke Firerage from his contemplation.

Firerage sighed and didn’t come up with an answer. The most reasonable outcome should have been His Majesty passing the dynasty down to his daughter or high-ranking nobles.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Your Highness.” Firerage got on one knee and bowed before Li Qiye; his men also did the same after seeing this.

This was them recognizing Li Qiye’s new status. Though none of them understood, they had absolute loyalty toward Eight-stallion Dao Lord. If this was his wish, may it be done even if it meant them working for this stranger.
