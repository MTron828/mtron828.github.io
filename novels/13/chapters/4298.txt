Chapter 4299: Crush Them With Rocks

“Crush them to death.” Li Qiye ordered.

“Sect Master, you want to personally kill that Eight Tiger?” Elder Hu inquired again.

“No, that little demon isn’t worth my time. Just throw rocks at them.” Li Qiye smiled. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Uh… throw rocks at them?” Elder Hu thought that he misheard.

“Yes.” Li Qiye confirmed.

Elder Hu stared at him in confusion. Was this a joke? Eight Tiger Demon was a yin yang cultivator.

“Sect Master, I’m not sure this is the time to play around…” He responded. If cultivators could be killed by rocks, then no one would bother to cultivate.

“Any rock will do, large or small, just throw it really far and high in their direction.” Li Qiye ignored the skepticism.

By this point, Elder Hu began to question Li Qiye’s sanity. If it wasn’t for his otherworldly dao instruction and impeccable knowledge, the elder would think that he has a mental illness.

However, Li Qiye had won over the sect by this point. They trusted him despite hearing how ridiculous it was.

“Is this actually possible?” The elder asked again.

“Why not?” Li Qiye remained patient.

“With all due respect, Sect Master, I don’t think any cultivator will die to a rock.” The elder responded.

“If you throw a rock with full strength at a mortal, will he die?” Li Qiye asked.

“Mmm… absolutely.” The elder admitted.

He was powerful compared to mortals. If he were to toss one with all of his might, the mortal’s head would explode regardless of the rock’s size.

However, these demons weren’t mortals. Eight Tiger, in particular, was stronger than any of them.

How could their sect kill these demons via rocks and stones? Logic was not on their side.

“Just listen to me, miracles can and will happen.” Li Qiye stared coolly at the sky and said.

“I…” The elder eventually gritted his teeth and said: “Sect Master, I shall obey.”

He needed to try everything in this desperate situation because Li Qiye was their sliver of hope. Others might consider this ludicrous but he still wanted to bet on Li Qiye.

“Time is over, Little Diamond! Will you surrender or fight?!” Eight Tiger roared from the base of the mountain.

“Either way, that Li guy will not be allowed to live. I will drink his blood and taste his flesh!” Du Weiwu shouted while gritting his teeth.

Meanwhile, Elder Hu passed on Li Qiye’s command: “The sect master has spoken, we shall throw rocks at them. Any size is fine.”

“Come again?” Not to mention regular disciples, even the elders became slack-jawed.

“Is there a mistake?” The first elder asked Elder Hu.

“No, that’s a direct order from the sect master.” Elder Hu smiled wryly and confirmed.

“Like regular rocks? We just throw them?” The first elder started questioning Li Qiye’s sanity as well.

“Yes, just throw them. He said to go as high and as far as possible.” Elder Hu said with doubt.

He thought that he was crazy too after giving this command, especially during this existential crisis.

The disciples nearby became confused and exchanged glances. However, their respect for Li Qiye kept them calm so they didn’t protest.

“Eight Tiger, our sect master has decided. We shall fight against unwelcomed enemies!” The fifth elder who was on the front line answered.

“Hahaha, very well, so you want it the hard way instead. So be it, don’t blame us for being merciless as we break down your gate and crush your sect.”

“Get ready for battle!” Elder Hu joined the frontline as well and ordered: “Pick up rocks!”

The disciples either sheathed their weapon or tossed them to the side. They looked around to find random rocks or dug them up from the ground.

“What are they doing?” The demons were at a loss while watching this.

“You want to kill us with rocks?” Eight Tiger burst out in laughter.

“Hahaha!” His men felt the same way.

“Oh god, these idiots want to play with rocks? If rocks can kill us, we all might as well commit suicide.” One of them joked.

“There’s something wrong with your new sect master’s brain….”

“I know, they’re trying to make us laugh to death, hahaha!”

“I didn’t expect him to be this stupid, looks like even the heaven wishes for your sect’s demise…” Du Weiwu laughed heartily.

As he was laughing, Li Qiye who was standing on the peak casually picked up a stone and threw it down.

“Boom!” The stone struck and smashed the youth’s head. Fleshy bits and blood splattered everywhere. He didn’t even have the chance to scream before falling backward on the ground.

The waves of laughter in the demon horde subsided instantly.

“Throw!” The first elder shouted and led by example, being the second to throw.

“Throw!” Fellow sect members did the same.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” Though they mustered all of their might, the offensive power was still limited.

“Hmph, no way these rocks can kill us.” Eight Tiger sneered and was prepared, unlike Du Weiwu.

However, once the rocks got high enough, the air suddenly changed. There seemed to be a power manifesting out of nowhere and blessing all the rocks. Or, it might be that they have reached an elevation high enough to touch a mysterious force and gain its blessing.
