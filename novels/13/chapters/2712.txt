Meanwhile, the actual Li Qiye fell into a deep mountain and left behind a pit. After a single night, vines and trees started growing around it, culminating in a forest.

He landed on a system named Immortal Devil with quite an origin.

Its progenitor had the title of Everlasting Forefather. The guy was very magical and could certainly back up this bold title choice.

Rumor has it that he was the only person in history with a masterly understanding of the samsara and the only one who will experience it. That’s why he would return after each era with a different identity.

Numerous emperors and progenitors became interested in him, also wanting to learn the mysteries of the samsara. However, this person resembled an unreachable dragon. Though people knew that he has reincarnated, few could actually find him.

He continued to shroud himself in fog, not letting others know his identity and background. Who knows how strong this progenitor was?

That’s why he was considered the most mysterious progenitor.

He eventually stopped appearing a very long time later. Some guessed that he had finally failed on the cycle and became ashes.

Future generations slowly forgot about this magical progenitor. However, the system he created continued to exist despite numerous ups and downs after many generations.

However, the world didn’t know that Everlasting Forefather also has another identity - Everlasting Xiao of Immortal Demon Grotto in the nine worlds. [1]

Old man, why does fate bring us together again? That’s why Li Qiye said this after the landing.

After being sent flying by the explosion of his own holy light, a powerful force from this system pulled him here.

The relationship between him and Everlasting Xiao was too deep, spanning for eras. In fact, one could say that Li Qiye came from the Immortal Demon Grotto.

Thus, the techniques and resources left behind by Everlasting Xiao in this system drew Li Qiye here during his freefall.

Li Qiye was actually going home, in a sense. His divine intents were in his dao heart, completely focused on taking down the terrifying existence.

Thus, he looked to be unconscious, almost like being in a vegetative state.

Of course, it was easy for him to wake up. He just needed to remove one strand of intent from his dao heart then he would be back and not much different from now.

Alas, his biggest goal was refining the dark existence right now so he didn’t care about his actual body.

The weather and bugs didn’t bother him at all. His constitution has reached an insane level. An ant couldn’t dig its teeth in his skin.

After a few days, the forest around him continuously expanded. The area directly below him fared even better. Some spirit grasses and alchemy materials flourished around him.

This was to be expected. His blood stained the area from the previous wound. Even if it wasn’t his true blood or imperial blood, just his regular blood was extremely precious - capable of making the soil fertile.

Days passed by then years in this wilderness rarely visited by others so no one found him.

Eventually, a group of young disciples from Mountguard School came here to pick herbs.

“Hey, there’s a cluster of spirit materials over here.” They spent half a day for little gains until they found his location and saw a plethora of herbs and grasses. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The various types were precious on top of growing very well, resulting in an alchemy garden of sorts.

The youths became excited and hurriedly gathered the items.

“We finally found a good area.” They happily filled their baskets.

“Thank god First Brother noticed this or most of us would have returned empty-handed.”

“We’re rich now... well, I guess this will be considered a meritorious contribution for the sect. The elders will be very pleased.” Some of them started celebrating and continued the harvest.

“First Brother, there’s a corpse here!” One of them finally saw Li Qiye.

“A corpse?!” Some were startled and stumbled backward.

They exchanged glances of astonishment. The more timid members became frightened.

“Dig it out so we can have a better look.” Their first brother named Li Jiankun remained cool and ordered.

The group worked together to clear the vegetation and finally exposed the corpse.

“It hasn’t decomposed.” Their first brother pulled up the muddy corpse and took a look.

“Not someone from our school.” They heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the corpse’s face.

“Well, this person technically shouldn’t have died that long ago judging from the state of his corpse, but why was it buried so deep? A murder, maybe?” Speculation arose.

This naturally scared some members. Did someone kill then bury him in this remote region? Maybe a robbery escalating into a murder, or just something else altogether.

“Does anyone recognize him?” Their first brother asked.

This was the territory of their school so it could be someone from there. The group took a look before shaking their head.

“I think he’s a mortal, not a cultivator and definitely not an expert.” One said quietly.

The majority agreed and nodded, thinking that this guy looks way too ordinary to be an expert or a cultivator.

“Hmm, no wound on him, maybe he got sick while plucking herb and died.” Another disciple said.

“Wait, wait, he’s, he’s still alive!” One disciple turned pale and shouted.

Li Qiye opened his eyes for a split second before closing them again, returning his one intent back to his dao heart.

The refinement was still happening in his dao heart but this group disturbed him so he took a quick look. He lost interest after seeing them.

A “corpse” suddenly opening its eyes naturally scared the youths. Many have just joined the sect and have yet to see the world.

“He’s alive.” They carefully observed him again after the momentary shock and calmed down. This wasn’t a reanimated corpse.

“Yes, I think he fell down hard and became crippled from top to bottom. It’s a miracle that he’s still alive.” Their first brother squatted down and confirmed.

1. I’m still not sure if it is Xiao Shi or just Xiao and the character Shi here tells us that it is his surname. I need to see his clan’s last name before knowing.
