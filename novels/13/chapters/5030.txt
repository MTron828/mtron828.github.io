Chapter 5031: Golden Serpent Emperor

Shadowrider was actually the fastest to react, even disappearing faster than Radiant Monarch. The escaping technique was peerless in the lower continents but unfortunately, the opponent was Li Qiye.

He pulled the sword out and crucified Shadowrider into the fabric of space.

The only person who didn’t try to escape was Wild Dragon. He came even closer to summon a treasure: “Golden Serpent Emperor!”

He underwent a transformation and became larger. He was initially a fire dragon; his scales became tough and golden, causing him to look rather regal.

“Raa!” The golden dragon possessed a majestic divinity with an ethereal throne behind him.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The figure sitting on the throne shocked and suppressed everyone, making them feel like insignificant dust specks.

In fact, even the dragon lords couldn’t endure the pressure and nearly dropped to the ground.

“Serpent God!” Goldcrest Young Noble shouted while being paralyzed.

Wild Dragon was being possessed by this founder god - the oldest and most mysterious.

It turned out that this was his fortune. When he was younger, he just happened to come across a small snake nearly being pecked by a great eagle.

He had a rare moment of kindness and saved the small snake. It turned out that this snake was a transformation of the founder god. Because of this, he was bestowed freedom and protection.

The dragon lunged downward with its mouth open, ready to devour Li Qiye who still had a smile on his face.

He raised his hands and summoned a crow with sky-blotting wings.

“Screech!” It leaped into the air and caught the golden dragon instantly. It flapped its wings and sent the throne flying.

When the figure on the throne saw that crow, it immediately disappeared from sight and didn’t return.

“Ahhh!” The golden dragon was torn apart by the crow. Blood splashed everywhere as it reverted to its original form - a big-belly earth dragon.

The crow didn’t relent and tore the dragon apart; large pieces of flesh fell to the ground.

Spectators couldn’t believe it - the mighty golden dragon couldn’t stop a single move. Most importantly, the serpent emperor ran away to the demons’ astonishment.

Li Qiye’s next focus became Shadowrider. As he walked closer, fog engulfed the region and day turned into night.

One couldn’t see their fingers in front of them. Chilling gusts started to form as well; it looked like the coming of ghosts.

“What’s going on?” This scared the hell out of cultivators.

“Whoosh!” Thousands of swords suddenly manifested in the fog and attacked Li Qiye. Every single sword was more frightening and powerful than Shadowrider’s ambush earlier.

“Hmph.” Li Qiye scowled and ignored the swords pinned to his body.

He raised his foot and stomped down, causing an unknown being to scream and run. However, this gave enough time for Shadowrider to run away. Li Qiye decided to pursue this time, leaving the crowd behind.

The fog eventually dispersed in the palace. Nonetheless, the stench of blood still remained.

“W-was that Nightwalker?” Goldcrest whispered. He got the feeling that this was the commanding god of Mist. Why did this being suddenly arrive to help Shadowrider?

Of course, this was a serious matter and he didn’t dare to comment on it without sufficient evidence.

The other dragon gods glanced at the messy battlefield, shocked. Jun Cuican, Swordgrasp Venerable, and Wild Dragon have been slain. Only Radiant Monarch was fortunate enough to escape but who knows if he could survive the injuries?

The reversal happened so suddenly. Everyone thought that Li Qiye was finished yet he turned it around in just a few seconds.

Moreover, they saw Shadowrider’s sword piercing his head as well. How did he come out unscathed in the end?

Skystomper trembled uncontrollably. That could have been his fate had he joined the battle.

“Still running?” Li Qiye had no problem keeping up with Shadowrider and stomped down, sending him to the ground.

He stopped running and showed his hands above the pit: “I give up, I give up, what as you please.”

He then pulled out the sword from his chest and tossed it at Li Qiye, aware that escaping was impossible.

“You wouldn’t be alive right now if I want to actually kill you.” Li Qiye said.

“My life is yours now, you can do whatever.” He had an awkward smile.

“I don’t want your dog life, relax.” Li Qiye sat down and said.

He then carefully healed his wounds, no longer thinking about running. Having one hundred heads still wouldn’t be enough to survive an encounter with Li Qiye.

“What do you want of me then?” He finished bandaging with ointment and asked.

“Talk about that Nightwalker earlier.” Li Qiye said.

He chose to be silent since this was a big secret.

“I can force him out and the process will be very painful.” Li Qiye smiled.

He knew that this was indeed the truth - Li Qiye was a man of his word.

“We are one, except I’m the dao avatar.” He admitted.
