“This Li Qiye...” The bodhi king’s eyes focused on the direction of Jade Bird.

First came Gong Qianyue, now Li Qiye.

The former had an inborn true fate allowing her to be exceptional. All the seniors expected greatness out of her.

However, Li Qiye’s case was different and bizarre. What happened around him could only be explained as coincidences, but were they?

The bodhi king thought that someone was secretly scheming in the background.

Thunder Dragon Liu? No, he didn’t have this ability and wiliness.

Only one person in Divine Black could do so - Ping Suoweng.

“But why? Is this his will?” The king wondered after this disciple coming out of nowhere. However, patience won out and there was no need to pursue this issue.

“What should we do about Zhan Hu’s complaint?” The disciple nearby asked.

“Reject it.” The king answered right away.

The disciple didn’t expect this response because Furious Tiger and Thousand Demons were allies in the sect.

Zhan Hu clearly wanted the bodhi king to support him. This was a way for him to gain both experience and future popularity.

“What if Zhan Hu wishes for an audience?” The disciple asked.

“Refuse him.” The king directly answered. His eyes became profound, seemingly in rumination.

The disciple found this even weirder. Zhan Hu was the son of another peak lord but the bodhi king didn’t seem to be too receptive of him.

Zhan Hu himself couldn’t believe it. Though he had the support of Zhang Yue, the chance of maneuvering against Li Qiye became slim without the bodhi king’s approval.

Sure enough, Zhan Hu’s official complaint didn’t even get the attention of Mountainbearer.

“No need for a meeting regarding something so trivial. It’s blown out of proportion.” The mountain king said without holding back.

In reality, Furious Tiger and Eight Zhang never liked each other. Their competition was fiercer than the other peaks.

“It’s getting more and more interesting. Just who the hell is this brat?” The mountain king wondered while rubbing his chin.

He stared at the main peak, South Conch. He wanted to know what Ping Suoweng was thinking. Others felt the same way.

“Hmph! Protecting a murder? Such lawlessness, humans aren’t the only race in Divine Black!” Iron Rod Demon King scowled.

He obviously chose his son’s side. Moreover, Huang Jie and Fuyou’s reaction made him cautious.

It was no longer a matter of a death resulting from a fight between two disciples.

Fuyou and Huang Jie seemed to be challenging their peak so the demon king wouldn’t just sit idly by and watch.

“Want to take over?” His eyes gleamed chillingly.

He had no worries about his own position but this wasn’t the case for Zhang Yue. The latter was the youngest and didn’t have that strong of a foundation.

The demon king would never let this happen because Zhang Yue used to be a member of Furious Tiger. Thus, these two were of one mind on all issues.

He then stared at the main peak, also curious about the sect master’s stance.

In fact, he thought that only the sect master would be able to replace Zhang Yue. Moreover, this position should have belonged to Su Xu if it wasn’t for his untimely death.

The humans also thought about pushing Fuyou for this spot but because of the guy’s cultivation problem, he failed to compete against Zhang Yue.

“Overruled, don’t bring up this trivial matter again.” Ping Suoweng didn’t bother looking at the official complaint; his eyes remained on the floating sword.

The messenger followed the order without any hesitation.

“This Li Qiye...” A follower of his quietly murmured.

“If it’s a problem, it’ll come anyway. There’s no avoiding it.” Suoweng looked up and said.

The follower didn’t quite understand.

“Our sect is too weak. Something will happen eventually.” Suoweng looked at him and said.

“Sect Master, are you saying that this Li Qiye is a spy from Three Truths?” The follower speculated.

“Not necessarily, but our sect is under prying eyes.” Suoweng shook his head.

“They won’t break the armistice, will they?” The follower became worried.

“Hard to say, we do need an ally.” Suoweng gazed towards the horizon. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Are you talking about Dragon Phoenix Valley?” This was the only sect the follower could think of.

The valley and Divine Black were the two strongest demon lineages in northern West King.

“I heard the valley has a new disciple.” Suoweng remained silent for a bit before speaking.

His follower became confused. Why would their sect master care about a random disciple?

“This disciple is rumored to be from that clan, an amazing bloodline.” Suoweng said.

“The legendary one?” The follower shuddered before asking.

Suoweng nodded in response.

“It’s so ancient. I thought that they stopped coming out?” The follower had heard stories before.

“That clan has deep ties with our sect.” Suoweng didn’t answer the question.

“Hmm?” The follower didn’t know about this.

“It is said that our patriarch and their primogenitor are good friends.”

“Is, is that mythical primogenitor still alive?” The follower took a deep breath.

“I don’t know, but we need an ally not just because of Three Truths.” Suoweng said.

“Sorry?” The follower didn’t understand.

Their sect was definitely first-rate in their region. Very few would actually dare to oppose them. Why was the sect master worrying so much?

“I hope for a miracle.” Suoweng eventually concluded.

“Well, that Li Qiye is as strange as can be. Maybe he’s a miracle.” The follower said.

Some at the sect have started calling him the “son of miracles”.

Just think about it, how could someone of his talents be able to activate thirteen sections? That was definitely a miracle.

“I hope so.” Suoweng turned towards Jade Bird Peak: “The examination is coming soon, we’ll see some clues then, perhaps.”

He then focused back on the sword, not caring about the peak lords observing him or Zhan Hu’s complaint.

The follower sighed. For some reason, his sect master has changed recently and rarely went outside.

In the beginning, he thought it was because of Su Xu’s death. However, it has been more than a year.
