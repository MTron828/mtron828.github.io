Every golem had a chance to reach atavism. It was a matter of life choice.

This wasn’t the case for pseudo-atavism. This required immense power and a high cultivation realm.

This could be compared to the sealing method of the other race in order for their powerful ancestors to stay around longer. Of course, this was even more magical and effective.

Nonetheless, an awakening wasn’t easy. The majority of pseudo-atavism experts wouldn’t wake up for no reason. It would become harder to go back to their dormant state. Some would have to pay a heavy price.

Wawa showed his respect to his seniors then took Li Qiye to his house.

He was the only one who has yet to reach atavism in the entire village. Thus, from a human perspective, he was the only one still alive.

His room was very simple with only the essentials. He kept it spotless. After letting Li Qiye settle in, he prepared food for his guest - a hot meal consisting of rice and salted pork.

“I rarely eat rice so I don’t have anything good.” He awkwardly scratched his head, feeling bad since Li Qiye picked out so many stones for him.

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye smiled. He could still enjoy a simple meal without any problem.

Wawa wasn’t interested in this meal and sat nearby, staring at Li Qiye with his chin resting on his hands.

“Young Master, why don’t you become a mason since you can spot the stones so well? I think the mason masters from the big sects can’t compare to you.” Wawa became curious.

“Not interested, my heart isn’t in it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I see.” Wawa found this regrettable and continued: “Being a mason master is very prestigious. One came to our canyon before, looking very awe-inspiring and respected.”

Li Qiye chuckled and kept on eating. He eventually asked Wawa: “And you, what’s your plan? You want to reach atavism like the rest of your family?”

“I, I don’t know yet.” Wawa scratched his head again: “There are two choices in our canyon, either to turn into stone or to find someone they like for marriage and reproduction. I haven’t made up my mind.”

The majority of golems have chosen atavism. However, they didn’t stop future descendants from reproduction and would often encourage it.

For example, if Wawa chose against marriage, then this village would go to waste after him unless another group moved here. His offsprings would keep the village going.

“Well, what do you want?” Li Qiye pressed on.

“Mmm...” Wawa carefully thought about it. He rarely talked to outsiders before; Li Qiye might be the only person he spoke at length with.

“The truth is that I want to go to Ancestral City. I haven’t been there before and I heard that it was the root of our race. That’s why I want to take a look.” Wawa replied after careful rumination.

“That’s not a bad idea. Go take a look at the world to know how vast it is.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement.

“Right? People say that it is very beautiful and cool. Our Golem Ancestor’s foundation is there, the place where he gave orders to the world.” Wawa’s eyes lit up.

Li Qiye had a faint smile after hearing this.

“Our village doesn’t have any rule about when to reach atavism either, so I’m thinking that I should go take a look before I do it, to the outside world. It wouldn’t be late to come back for my atavism later anyway.” Wawa became excited.

Li Qiye could understand. This was the pure mindset of a child.

“What about a companion?” Li Qiye decided to tease him.

“Well...” Wawa was still too young to think about this.

“Don’t want to look for one?” Li Qiye actually cared about the youth’s choice while teasing him.

“I don’t really like anyone in the nearby villages.” Wawa eventually spilled in spite of the sensitive and embarrassing topic.

“Maybe you’ll find someone outside, like in Ancestral City. That’s the place where the myriad races gather. There should be a miss there for you.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“You might be right.” Wawa wanted to go to this city more and more.

“What if you like someone from a different race?” Li Qiye continued.

“I...” Wawa had no response.

Golems didn’t forbid marriage with another race. This was common at the plateau and especially at their Ancestral City.

However, this placed certain restrictions on the golem. Only golems could reach atavism, not their half-blood offsprings with another race.

“If, if that’s the case, then we’ll see, I guess. I probably shouldn’t rush my atavism too quickly.” Wawa said with hesitation.

“You have to try first to know whether it’s good or bad, experience will show you the colors of this world. As you are now, still a kid, having to reach atavism and becoming a sinking rock...” Li Qiye paused for a bit before continuing: “Then what’s the point of being born? So what if you can obtain immortality? The lack of experiences means wasting your life. There are millions and millions of existences but not all of them have sentience and intelligence. The fact that you’re here is a rare miracle, don’t waste it now. Follow your heart and experience more, whether they be good or bad, fruitful or otherwise. One day, you’ll be able to look back at those memories with fondness, perhaps even the bad ones.”

Wawa listened attentively the entire time.

“Most importantly, without experiences, you would be nothing more than a blank piece of paper.” Li Qiye concluded. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This last phrase kept on playing in Wawa’s head.

Li Qiye finished his spiel and resumed eating. Meanwhile, Wawa sat there in a daze. Li Qiye’s words have struck a chord, opening a door for the youth’s heart.

Atavism was possible for all golems at birth. It was a matter of decision.

As for Wawa, he grew up in Stonewind Canyon. His family all chose this path and sank to the ground.

This type of life naturally affected Wawa too. He didn’t have many thoughts about the outside world. Only Ancestral City interested him.

Li Qiye’s words lit up something in the boy - a portal. It was as if by crossing through this portal, he would be able to see the outside world.

Wawa’s desire to visit Ancestral City was nothing more than a desire. Now, he wanted to make it happen.

“I understand, Young Master.” Wawa regained his wits and became excited: “I’ll definitely go outside, a trip to Ancestral City!”

Li Qiye smiled approvingly.

By this point, the sounds of wind blowing could be heard outside the door, gradually intensifying.
