Chapter 5879: Limit Breakers

His epoch continued to enjoy a golden age after his departure. Cultivation became easy due to the essences extracted from the overlords and spread evenly across the two main realms.

These overlords had accumulated an incredible amount of power and energy, especially Voracious Leviathan and Epoch’s End.

For regular cultivators, emperors already had a monstrous amount. Their vitality could engulf a region. The overlords naturally took this to the next level. Therefore, their essences gestated everyone for eras to come.

In the mortal world, mortals lived without worrying about food and resource scarcity. Paradises could be found everywhere.

As for cultivators, training and enlightenment came easier. The power of the dao had reached an unprecedented level.

A genius’ cultivation speed in the previous era was commonplace now. Currently, modern geniuses enjoyed miraculous cultivation speed.

Older emperors and dragon lords also benefitted, able to break through bottlenecks. They became spirited and young again, no longer saddened by the burden of the previous epoch. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Apex cultivators’ chance of breaking through was virtually zero in the past. In reality, twelve-will and twelve-fruit cultivators were rare enough, let alone those with anima.

Anima was the main stopping point for them. Truth to Origination felt unreachable - a barrier that prevented them from improving.

In history, only World and Profound were known to have reached this state when not counting the dead overlords. There might be stronger cultivators now but they weren’t verified.

This was all due to Li Qiye and the death of the overlords. The dao in this world no longer had shackles and limits.

On the six continents, one conqueror appeared after another, even those with twelve fruits. In the two upper continents, rumors of a dao lord breaking the limit surprised the world.

This caused those in the immortal continent to work even harder, not wanting to fall behind. Thus, in the next one hundred thousand years, visual phenomena could be seen sporadically in the immortal continent.

“Sword Emperor made it!” Everyone found out after seeing a monstrous imperial aura in the immortal continent.

Sword was the first to break the limit but this wasn’t too surprising since he used to be one of the most promising Grand Emperors.

Those who had witnessed the battle also saw Li Qiye blessed him with a special dao and expected this to happen.

“Immortal Emperor Hao Hai did it!” A different phenomenon came at a later date and the immortal continent celebrated once more.

This wasn’t surprising either given the emperor’s talent. His true potential was unlocked after the battle and he became second.

“Immortal Emperor Ren Xian broke through!” After another ten thousand years or so, the third broke the limit.

One more visual phenomenon appeared a bit later but the cultivator remained unknown.
