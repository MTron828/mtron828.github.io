Chapter 5476: My Mission Is Over

“Boom!” World Emperor activated his immortal armament for a direct attack on Profound Emperor.

The immense distance between them meant nothing as a torrent of power soared forward. Profound no longer had time to help Immortal Pagoda, needing to use his dao to stop World Emperor. They turned all of Ultimate into a battlefield.

“Time to end this.” Li Qiye leaped into the air, still accompanied by the myriad dao since he was the paragon of this world.

“Whoosh!” He swung his hand like an axe, no longer holding back.

Supreme’s True Bones and Immortal Pagoda’s empowered state were certainly strong. Alas, they couldn’t stop an attack from the high heaven.

He destroyed Supreme’s momentum and crushed the power channels from the four broken realms.

His aura affected Ultimate, dispelling all the dao there. This caused Profound Emperor to spit out a mouthful of blood.

He understood the gravity of the situation and immediately fled for his life, running through a portal prepared deeper inside Ultimate. World immediately gave chase and disappeared as well.

“Ahh!” Supreme couldn’t withstand the blow without the supreme momentum. His sacred fruits and tree disintegrated instantly.

Immortal Pagoda didn’t fare any better. His supreme dao and everything else were destroyed with the exception of his primordial fruit, purposely left intact by Li Qiye.

Silence returned to the scene after Li Qiye obliterated his opponents. The phenomenon of Celestial Court and the pulsing power of the unknown heavenly treasure were eradicated as well.

The chop earlier by Li Qiye seemed akin to a blow from the high heaven, fully suppressing powerful cultivators and mortals.

“You are unbeatable, Sir. My mission… is over…” Supreme uttered his last words before turning stiff and dead.

“Hahaha, I… I witnessed invincibility, no regrets…” Immortal Pagoda laughed as well before coughing out blood; his legs kicked out one last time before following Supreme to the grave.

The crowd needed a moment to digest the death of these two apex cultivators. Both were destined for greatness and sure enough, they lived up to everyone’s expectations. They still deserved respect despite dying to Li Qiye today.

The two carried out their duty and died valiantly in battle. Their era was now over, ended by Li Qiye who didn’t need to resort to using a weapon. Everyone trembled after recalling how easy it was for Li Qiye.

“What a shame, they were brilliant.” Someone commented while watching Li Qiye taking away True Bones and the primordial dao fruit.

“Emperor, you are invincible.” A monarch bowed in Li Qiye’s direction.

Others regained their wits and also bowed, realizing that this was a being far beyond their reach.

Supreme and Immortal Pagoda could have massacred all of them earlier, yet they couldn’t last a single move against Li Qiye.

This battle ended in no time at all. Since Li Qiye showed no intention of pursuing the issue, members of Heaven Alliance quietly retreated after Supreme’s death.

To try rising up against Li Qiye was a suicidal endeavor. Having the number advantage didn’t matter in the slightest. From now on, Heaven Alliance will only exist on paper.

All-things and his allies heaved a sigh of relief. Heaven Alliance had all but disbanded. Divine Alliance wasn’t in a better state either.

Their mission of protecting The People was finished and they could focus on cultivation again. There was no need to act as protectors any longer.

“Peace at last?” Mortals back in the upper continents couldn’t witness the fight and the splendor of the emperors.

Nonetheless, the pressure was now gone and they could finally stand up again. Warm sunlight returned and made them feel lucky to be alive.

Some thought that perhaps it would be better for the world if there were no emperors and gods for they were potential sources of calamity.

They have heard legends about Emperor Wars before. Nearly experiencing a second one made them pray for a swift end to any conflict.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
