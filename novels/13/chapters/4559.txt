Chapter 4560: Incineration Treant

Everyone noticed the leaf right away.

“Incineration Treant.” An ancestor from an ancient clan said: “A mighty treant from the old era, infinitely close to being indestructible and unkillable.”

“But isn’t he dead already?” A youth said.

“That’s why I said infinitely close.” The ancestor went on: “Look at that leaf. It is not his but rather, a legacy passed down from their ancestors, an immortal leaf that will last for an eternity. Their descendants are eligible to fuse the leaf into their own body. That’s why Incineration Treant had an immense life force, giving him an indestructible nature and an endless lifespan. The leaf allowed him to live for eras while he served as the protector of their race…”

Crowd members listened attentively. The youths didn’t think much about the leaf but on the other hand, the nearly-dead ancestors desired life more than anything.

Of course, immortality and everlasting life were mere dreams. No one could obtain this but who would say no to living longer?

Everyone could sense the life force oozing from the leaf. It could help someone live for countless years.

Powerful, yes, but the treant was far from being strong enough to live forever. It was the leaf that supported him for eras until one day, he decided to bury himself in the cemetery.

“What if we use it to make medicine?” An old cultivator softly asked.

Though the cultivators here weren’t treants to imbue their leaf into their body, they might be able to refine the leaf into medicine via alchemy and considerably increase their lifespan. The temptation was irresistible.

“Go!” The four exchanged glances and leaped into the bridge, standing in front of the treant.

“See, they came prepared.” Jian Ming murmured after seeing this.

“Venerable Ancestor.” The four bowed respectfully but the treant didn’t react.

Nonetheless, they took out a censer and lit up some incense - simple yet solemn.

“Must be his descendants.” A spectator murmured. Of course, the only treant among them was “Woodman”.

Woodman took out an old badge with both hands and raised it above his head. He prostrated and said: “Ancestor, your descendant is here bearing the divine wood badge. I respectfully beseech you to return the Myriad Age Leaf.”

The badge was made from an unknown type of wood. It still shined brightly despite being ancient and seemed to be heavier and tougher than metal.

Though spectators didn’t know what it was, it clearly carried immense significance to the treants, capable of commanding them.

However, the treant didn’t bother glancing at the badge as if it was nothing.

“Incineration Treant is dead and has forgotten everything. This ancestral badge is useless.” The daoist commented.

The solemn ceremony didn’t work and prompted the four to ponder for a second. They then nodded in unison.

Woodman took out a scroll and opened it. This was a painting of an elegant woman.

“Poof!” The scroll was lit ablaze. As it turned to ashes, the woman inside manifested into reality. Her bearing and manner were full of grace; she must have been someone important when she was alive.

She looked rather animated just like a living person. This time around, the treant suddenly stopped and stared at her.

“Incineration.” Her clear voice could reach the soul. [1]

The dead treant seemingly returned to life. His eyes filled with death became bright once more.

“This woman must have been very important to Incineration Treant, even more so than his own life. It’s effective.” The daoist said.

The woman was pulling him back from the dead. In this split second, she moved with lightning speed and plucked the leaf from his body.

“Go!” The Improper Four got their target and immediately fled toward the horizon.

“I knew it, buncha thieves.” Jian Ming murmured.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” A thunderous voice resounded as a gigantic palm descended on Xiao Yan.

“Boom!” Xiao Yan performed a special step technique and instantly evaded the attack.

They then looked forward and saw a horned ancestor standing in front of them.

“Goldhorn Monarch!” Someone recognized him.

“Go!” Puresword attacked with haste: “Evil-subduing Ring!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A golden halo descended with enough power to contain the entire world. Immemorial gods started chanting supreme runes.

“Hmph!” The horned monarch resisted its suppressive power.

“Leave the leaf if you want to leave!” Another big shot took action, smashing her iron walking stick. It was as if a mountain was falling down.

“Cane Tyrant!” Another recognized the famous cultivator.

“Break!” A’han rushed forward and roared: “Diamond Bull Force!” He summoned a golden bull that thrust its horns against the cane.

At the same time, one more big shot ambushed Xiao Yan. Virtually indiscernible sword energies engulfed the youth.

“Soaring Blade Marquis!” He was recognized as well.

“Evil Vine Law!” Woodman summoned countless dark vines for defense; each was as thick as a mountain range.

Members of the Improper Four showed their immense power against these big shots. They couldn’t be nameless juniors.

Spectators didn’t think much about the robbing attempt. This happened every day in the cultivation world.

“Raging Tempest!” Xiao Yan’s technique created a terrible tempest capable of tearing the world apart.

Both his allies and enemies were instantly trapped inside.

“Boom!” The latter eventually destroyed the tempest. Alas, the four youths were nowhere to be found.

1. I’m afraid that this treant might be a character we’ve seen before in the first 1,000 chapters. I tried doing a search but didn’t come up with anything ?
