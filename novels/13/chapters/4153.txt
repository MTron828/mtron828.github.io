Chapter 4154: Fortify

No one had an idea of Li Qiye’s purpose since his tossing was random. It didn’t seem to be a formation or the previously-seen money fall method.

“Seal him!” Nonetheless, Wandao Jian’s group took this seriously and still used their formation.

“Boom!” It released a mighty divinity and a palm made out of dao lord laws descended from above.

Everyone felt the lake being ravaged and shaking violently because of this palm strike. They turned pale as a result.

Wandao Jian’s goal was to seal both Li Qiye and the entire lake, stopping Li Qiye from using any secret method.

This made it unbearable for the cultivators nearby, feeling as if they were being crushed.

“You’re finished!” The scion’s sword continued releasing dreadful energies as he pointed it at Li Qiye. He could sweep through the continent with this sword in his possession.

“Clank!” The bright lights suddenly dissipated and night came in the form of an abyss right above Li Qiye, wishing to devour him.

This sword dao could devour anything, whether it be powerful cultivators or other affinities and eternal laws… Just one move from this dao could extinguish everything in existence.

“My turn.” Li Qiye smiled before the incoming attack. He waved his hand and released bright particles.

“Buzz.” Suddenly, rays of light rushed out from the bottom of the lake. They illuminated everything and caused ripples. Something incredible was coming out.

“Boom!” The Chaos Seal Formation reacted and increased its suppressive nature. The palm of a dao lord smashed the surface of the lake, wishing to destroy it.

Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough to extinguish the light rays. This only agitated something below. A primordial creature seemed to be awakening, unhappy with the rude guest.

“Raa!” Everyone heard the furious scream of a beast.

Next came a bright detonation from the bottom of the lake. The rays came together and formed a single beam. It looked like a massive dragon soaring upward and smashing into the formation. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Fortify!” Wandao Jian’s group became frightened.

Spectators were alarmed as well. The formation itself was impressive since it was created by a dao lord. Moreover, the users were capable as well, the majority being elders from Sea Emperor. This was enough to suppress most great powers.

Alas, the draconic beam was causing serious damage. The formation was nearly toppled.

“Rumble!” The elders and protectors from Sea Emperor immediately poured their vitality and power into the formation.

A wondrous figure appeared with haste, looking to be invincible across the ages. The suppressive nature of the formation intensified.

“A dao lord?!” Spectators immediately lost their freedom, unable to move an inch.

The figure’s focus was on stopping whatever was down there at the bottom of the lake.

Sure enough, the thing down there faltered and stopped struggling.

“This formation is so strong.” An expert noticed the beam weakening.

“Die!” The scion took advantage of this and sent his abyss towards Li Qiye.

It was a formless yet undodgeable slash. Spectators thought that Li Qiye was done for. They saw an illusion of his head flying in the air then falling and rolling on the ground.

In reality, the slash was inches away from Li Qiye’s neck. This prompted him to wave his hand again.

Another beam came from the bottom of the lake and fully engulfed him.

“Boom!” The scion’s technique struck what seemed to be the toughest rock in the world. Fiery sparks splashed everywhere after a deafening clank from the impact.

The scion failed to kill Li Qiye while his sword violently bounced back. He nearly lost his grip.

This beam surrounding Li Qiye served as the toughest armor available, easily stopping the Abyss Sword Dao.

“This thing stopped a dao lord sword and a heavenly sword dao.” Spectators were astounded after seeing this. Even divine armors would be split open yet the beam protected Li Qiye just fine.
