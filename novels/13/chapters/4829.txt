Chapter 4830: Finality Swords

Triune Alligator Lord has fallen and Silly Da chose to surrender. Only Lord of the Deeps, Undying Lord, and Dead Immortal were left.

They knew that this could only end in one of two ways - devouring Li Qiye or dying in battle.

“Let’s see your epoch then.” The abyssal lord stepped forward.

They had no other choice but to fight him together. First, he was the current epoch lord and had plenty of vitality left. On the other hand, their vitality withered, not to mention the heavenly injuries.

“Enough to kill you all.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand, issuing wonderful sword hymns.

Nine Grand Sword Dao emerged in Eight Desolaces. The sword dao blossomed beautifully in the air.

Sword intent became omnipresent, whether it be around living beings, the highest peaks, or even the stars above.

Corporeal Zone turned into nine swords in order to harmonize with the nine paths of Finality Swords.

The swords floated behind Li Qiye, representing the pinnacle of the sword dao - Terra, Abyss, Flamedao, War God, Myriad Era, Hallowed, Mad Sun, Tribulation, and Vastsea. 

The swords and sword dao fused together to create something unbeatable. Li Qiye immediately became the greatest swordmaster in history.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Back in Sword Continent, the sword users could feel this omnipotent presence more than everyone.

The scripture when used in conjunction with the corresponding treasure resulted in perfection. His opponent became serious right away after seeing this.

“Now!” The abyssal lord reverted to his original form - an incredible ocean consisting of dancing laws and profound derivations. Dao could turn into whales, turtles, or radiant clams with pearls…

This was a world made of dao laws and wondrous affinities. However, the lord himself turned into an abyss and started devouring everything. This was how he had devoured his own epoch.

“Dao Reversion.” Dead Immortal spoke softly before summoning various lightning bolts. They had different forms - tribulation type, earth bolts, life bolts…

Its body then melted into a liquid with the consistency of mercury. The next transformation surprised everyone - the liquid pooled together to form a second Li Qiye.

Though they were identical, keen eyes could still see a difference in the aura and that the eyes were silver.

The next development shocked spectators even more. “Li Qiye” waved his hand and summoned the same nine heavenly swords and their respective dao. They fused together to create a supreme sword dao just like Li Qiye.

The other overlords were caught off guard as well, having no idea of Dead Immortal’s duplication ability. It became rather difficult to discern the real one when just staring at their sword dao.

“Perish!” Undying Lord attacked right away without any preparation. Eternal Death thrust forward with a speed a million times faster than lightning. Time seemed slow in comparison.

The limit of speed created an opposite illusion - that time was flowing slowly; even a single breath took years.

Spectators were frozen and stuck in this temporal phenomenon. Grand dao and laws became useless.

This thrust was also imbued with the death affinity. This judgment occurred faster than the lance. Death was something above time and space.

“Zzz…” Li Qiye’s flesh became black after the judgment. If he couldn’t stop this, he would die before the lance could reach him.

Of course, speed was not a problem for Li Qiye. As the current epoch lord, he wasn’t constrained by the fabrics of reality.

“Clank!” A sword hymn resonated across Eight Desolaces. Everyone felt their heart being filled to the brim by this affinity. Only the sword existed in their world now.

He chose Hallowed for the slash. Holy light illuminated and protected the world, chasing away darkness and death.

Mortals and cultivators forgot all about fear while bathing in this light. This was the effect of Hallowed Sword Dao.

Li Qiye parried the lance successfully while shock waves blasted outward. The judgment of death was stopped by the ultimate holy affinity.

In the next second, the light caused Eternal Death to gradually disperse into smoke.

Undying Lord became alarmed and pushed his shield forward, releasing the death affinity that has been accumulating in there for eras. The dead obeyed the summon and started climbing out of the ground again as a side effect.

“Bam!” Eventually, Eternal Death disappeared from sight and Hallowed struck Undying Shield.

The holy light erupted upon impact and illuminated the mortal realm. The remnant aura of death and the corpses turned into smoke after being touched by the light.

Anything not part of the holy affinity could be purified by Hallowed. This included death and “indestructibility”.

Therefore, the shield itself started becoming transparent. Undying Lord reacted swiftly by retreating just before the destruction of the shield.

“Die!” The abyssal lord also joined the battle after gathering enough power. His ocean and its endless cycles engulfed Li Qiye in the blink of an eye.
