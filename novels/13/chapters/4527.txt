Chapter 4528: Foolish Provocation

After Li Qiye carried out his part of the bargain, he left the grotto with the rest.

The auctioneer with the goatee and the ancestors of the grotto walked with Li Qiye to the gate before waving enthusiastically.

“We forgot about those bandits from the Du.” Jian Ming suddenly remembered their business here: “Gotta teach them a lesson to stop them from being so haughty.”

“When will you learn anything?” Wise Ancestor glared at him and said: “Our mission is to take our dao stone back, not to stir trouble. You’ve done enough of that.”

“Ancestor, we’ll naturally resort to peaceful measures first before using force. If they are unable to tell right from wrong, then we’ll destroy their lair.” Jian Ming laughed and spoke as if he could destroy the Yu with one hand wave.

“Who’s gonna do it? You?” The ancestor joked.

Jian Ming’s eyes shifted shadily as he smiled: “Ancestor, we both know that my meager skills can’t do anything but you and the young noble are invincible. The Yu are nothing and will be dealt with in a few seconds.”

He took advantage of Li Qiye being around and spoke fearlessly. Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind so Wise Ancestor stopped scolding him.

Jian Ming then confidently led the group toward their target.

“Why are you following us? We’re busy here.” Along the way, he glanced at the daoist and asked.

“I’m not following you, stop being so noisy.” The daoist retorted.

“Well, you’re walking behind me and in the same direction as I am.” Jian Ming glared at him.

“It’s a big road, mind your own business.” The daoist responded.

“It’s okay to be a follower, no need to be shy since we’ll recruit you. It’s hard to watch you like this.” Jian Ming never wanted to lose an argument.

“You think too highly of yourself, you’re not part of this at all.” The daoist became irritated.

“If you’re following our young noble, then we’re in the same camp. Hehe, I know what you’re thinking, you want the young noble to bestow you something nice. If that actually happens, then don’t forget about my contribution, I want a piece of the pie too.” Jian Ming got closer and whispered.

The daoist kept on walking and ignored Jian Ming while he smirked, clearly coming up with another scheme.

They left the city to find the Yu. Alas, a group stopped them along the way.

These were familiar faces - Alchemy Child and his friends. However, there was one addition - an old man wearing a robe with golden stitchings. The robe was spotless and without a single wrinkle.

Though he wasn’t particularly tall and sturdy, his complexion made it feel as if he was made from bronze. This was rather threatening but strangely enough, his eyes were calm like a clear lake.

“Stop right there!” Alchemy Child roared.

“Sir Alchemy Child, what a surprise to see you again. I would have thought that you would be too embarrassed to show your face near the city after being escorted out by the auction house. Wow, True Immortal, strong with thick skin too, how admirable.”

Alchemy Child started trembling with rage again. It was one thing after another - losing to Li Qiye and then getting kicked out by Grotto Courtyard.

“Brat, mind your words or I’ll rip out your tongue!” Another member of True Immortal bellowed.

“Oh no…” Jian Ming patted his chest as if he was horrified for a second before looking normal again.

“Ignorant fool, I won’t argue with you.” Alchemy Child took a deep breath and managed to calm down.

He looked over at Li Qiye and cupped his fist: “Fellow Daoist, our young emperor is truly interested in your immortal grass. Would you like to visit True Immortal as a guest?”

He suddenly changed into a different person - amicable instead of haughty. No one would buy this act. It seemed that they haven’t given up on the immortal grass.

“I see.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Our young emperor is a true dragon, a future saint in the making, I don’t need to say more regarding his supreme talent. He also loves to befriend everyone and after hearing your name, he wishes for a meeting.”

“I have no reputation to speak of.” Li Qiye responded.

“Stop going around in circles.” Jian Ming laughed and said: “Just say that you want the immortal grass and state the offer. Maybe our young noble will be benevolent and sell it to you.”

Alchemy Child chose a different method this time around. After all, they didn’t want others to say that they were forcing Li Qiye or capturing him back to True Immortal.

He ignored Jian Ming again and calmly said: “Fellow Daoist, just name the price. We will buy it from you as long as it is reasonable.”

“Not for sale.” Li Qiye instantly refused.

“Don’t be so fast, Fellow Daoist. Everything is negotiable, please come meet our young emperor. Maybe a friendship can come out of this…” Alchemy Child didn’t give up.

“Not everyone is qualified to be my friend.” Li Qiye said.

“You!” Alchemy Child’s tone changed instantly.

“Bold words.” A few pedestrians heard Li Qiye and couldn’t believe it.

One cultivator said: “Everyone wants to befriend a potential dao lord in the making. Who is this brat? So arrogant.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Did you hear that?” Jian Ming said intimidatingly.

Alchemy Child’s expression became ugly. He could no longer pretend to be polite and coldly uttered: “Li, don’t pick the hard way because you can’t redo your choice later.”

“Finally showing your fox tail. How despicable and unbecoming of a True Immortal’s member.” The daoist joined in.

“Haha, do you want to be slapped again? Our ancestor will be happy to oblige.” Jian Ming poured salt on Alchemy Child’s fresh wounds.
