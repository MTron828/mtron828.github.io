Chapter 4194: Old Acquaintance

The world turned red once the solar eyes opened. There seemed to be blood flowing on the ground.

The atmosphere was terrifying but this creature took it to the next level. Its jaws were large enough to devour millions in one bite.

Not to mention the cowardly, even experienced and decisive ancestors would lose their courage. Some might be paralyzed on the ground or piss their pants.

“You are one of the few who get to see my true form.” Each of the centipede’s words was thunderous, enough to send people flying and rupturing their eardrums.

“Just a thousand-legged worm.” Li Qiye nonchalantly responded.

“Hahahaha!” The creature laughed again, releasing its true power.

“I want to see what you can do, little one.” It was finally furious and lunged forward in order to get a better look at him.

The reality was that they were still extremely far away. The centipede was insanely long so its head was still far away. Once its head got closer, it became even more frightening than ever. Li Qiye was but a speck of dust versus this monster.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In the blink of an eye, the head was now next to Li Qiye but he had no reaction.

The one to react was the centipede. First was astonishment then it took a more careful look. Afterward, all of its mountainous legs started shaking.

“You, you… you are Li Qiye!” It said with uncertainty.

“I believe I’m the only one with this name.” Li Qiye smirked.

The centipede trembled again after this was confirmed. It couldn’t stay calm at all. Its grand dao was finished, allowing it to lord over most cultivators in history. Alas, the name “Li Qiye” smashed its mind with the force of a heavy hammer.

Millions of thoughts and possibilities crossed its mind in a short span.

“I won’t change my mind about sparing you, especially since you know my name. Leave.” Li Qiye ordered.

The creature was woken up from its stupor after hearing this. It took a deep breath and began shrinking its body at a rapid pace.

In just one second, a middle-aged man appeared before Li Qiye, looking rather charming and graceful. One would never connect him and the ferocious centipede just now. The difference was extremely drastic.

“I was blind to not recognize you, Great Emperor. Please forgive me.” He prostrated and apologized.

“You must be from the nine worlds to know this.” Li Qiye said.

“I had the fortune of seeing you in Stone Medicine, Great Emperor. Lady Zi Yan granted me an audience. I was just a weak demon back then, that’s why you don’t remember me.” He spoke respectfully.

The emperor with the title “Prime” - Li Qiye. His name and title were taboo and couldn’t be uttered carelessly even though the nine worlds were gone.

This was an existence that had ascended yet could still come back to Eight Desolaces. No other emperors and dao lords had done the same as far as he knew.

Despite being a monstrous demon, he was aware that Li Qiye was far above his level. It was best to be subservient.

Prime tore apart the nine heavens and massacred whoever he wanted back then. He could definitely do the same right now too.

“Oh, I remember now, Ye Qingcheng’s follower, Cloud Soaring Venerable.” Li Qiye remembered this man.

“It is an honor to be remembered by you, Great Emperor.” The man became ecstatic.

He worked for Ye Qingcheng then and even tried to recruit Li Qiye. Though he wasn’t the best at cultivation, his craftiness made up for it.

“It’s surprising to see you alive.” Li Qiye said.

This was miraculous indeed. Numerous invincible beings have turned to dust. This included Immortal Emperors and dao lords.

They bloomed beautifully and made their mark in history, albeit only for a short period. As for this Cloud Soaring Venerable? He was only a speck of dust in comparison.

However, he managed to live longer than all of them.

“Great Emperor, my cultivation was shallow and weak. After the events at Stone Medicine, I decided to retire and this kept me safe from various calamities. Later on, I couldn’t accept dying from old age and took a risk coming to this place. I came across a sword containing a grand dao and swallowed it. It kept me alive until now.” The man honestly answered.

“Hmm, you can’t leave. This prison traps you here but also lets you live. A disaster and a blessing in one.” Li Qiye commented.

“Yes, Great Emperor. I’m sure the sword will cut my heart and use my body as a sacrifice if I try to leave.” He said.

“This sword isn’t matchless or anything but it’s still impressive. It already has a master and without permission, you won’t be able to leave unless you can refine its grand dao and truly fuse with it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Right, Great Emperor. Later on, I learned that this is the sword of the second grave. Though it was abandoned by its master, it is still invincible for regular cultivators like us.” The man smiled wryly.

“Become greedless, exercise patience, and cast off unnecessary thoughts. Flow with fate, refine the sword’s way and it shall obey, gain many more days…” Li Qiye started reciting.

The man memorized the mantra. Once Li Qiye finished, he prostrated and smashed his head on the ground. He was moved to tears as he spoke: “Thank you for your guidance, Great Emperor. I can’t say enough to express my gratitude.”

“Fate has brought us together so I granted you a fortune.” Li Qiye said: “Rise, it is up to you now.”

“I won’t forget what I’ve learned today, Great Emperor.” The man slammed his head one more time before standing up.

Li Qiye then focused on something else not far from there.
