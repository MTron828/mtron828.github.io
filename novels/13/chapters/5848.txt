Chapter 5848: Sword, Come!

“Enough!” Primal shouted and said: “Save your breath until after we survive. Focus on the fighting right now.”

The others realized that this was not the time for internal conflict.

“I will go first.” Primal took one step forward, assuming the unwanted role of the vanguard. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Alright, let’s deal with this first.” Imperial Progenitor took a deep breath and stepped forward as well.

He and Primal formed a pincer against Li Qiye.

“Shall we?” Dao Ancestor put aside personal plans for now.

All of them understood the threat of Li Qiye and didn’t want to be killed due to a lack of teamwork and focus. They needed to let go of their animosity toward each other because this was an existential crisis for both the blood and dao branch.

Stonesplitter himself moved forward, albeit still hiding behind his shield and never taking the initiative.

“So be it, let’s see who will come out on top.” Derivation smiled and decided to work with the team despite always wanting to trample them.

The others also restrained their nausea while standing near the colossal monster.

“Boom!” Primal’s Trinity Bloodaxe released a blood inferno violent enough to escape the boundaries of Elder Galaxy.

It entered the six continents and made everyone feel its power. The axe was made from his bloodline - one so old that it felt like the first of all bloodlines.

Living beings trembled, unable to resist its subjugation due to their younger and inferior bloodlines.

However, the primordial rays emanating from the tree behind Li Qiye were even older. His bloodline’s pressure did not affect the primordial tree.

“Return to me!” Imperial Progenitor roared and everything relating to cultivation followed the same beat as he took one step forward.

The myriad dao harmonized with him, including the grand dao created by emperors and monarchs.

Profound, World, and Hao Hai lost control and their dao started flowing toward Imperial Progenitor.

“Epoch Dao!” He shouted again and the dao exploded before uniting into one.

Some emperors could do something similar but it was rather limited in scale. Imperial Progenitor, on the other hand, turned it into an epoch-level dao.

This dao surpassed the limitation of time and space, hailing from the previous epoch to the current one.

Cultivators in history have learned the dao and accumulated all of this power. Since Imperial Progenitor’s grand dao was the source, he had access to theirs as well.

This was the reason why only his dao could birth epoch power while emperors and monarchs couldn’t.

“Sword, come!” Metallic clanks could be heard as he summoned his weapon.

From the first cultivator to the last, countless sword laws gathered to form a single dao sword. After taking a glance, everyone could see that it contained all the sword dao in the previous epoch.

This ranged from a mortal swordsman practicing amidst the falling leaves to the domineering sword dao of an Immortal Emperor.

“Epoch Dao Sword.” He stated the name of the weapon - the culmination of Trinity Epoch’s sword dao.

“Boom!” As for Dao Ancestor, he grasped Nine-dao Chaos Seal instead of summoning another weapon. Elder Galaxy trembled upon his touch.

Everyone felt the most primal power in the world gathering on the seal along with the mysteries of the heavenly scriptures. This was not something that belonged to this world.

Among the five overlords, Dao Ancestor gave the most otherworldly and transcending impression - the closest one to the word “immortal”.
