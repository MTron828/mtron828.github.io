Chapter 3703: Too Easy

Everything happened so quickly. Golden Regiment didn’t have the chance to help before the remaining forces of Abyss Dragon were utterly crushed.

“You...” The lone survivor was the general. He stood there in a daze, as pale as can be.

He had fought numerous battles with the regiment and decapitated countless foes. He wouldn’t claim to be invincible but due to his experience, the regiment should be able to stop a powerful Heavenly Sovereign.

Alas, they couldn’t do a thing to Li Qiye. His fear was understandable after the total defeat.

Of course, no one thought that this was because of Li Qiye. They attributed the whole thing to the bizarre statue from Wish Ward. This was something new even for the experienced cultivators present.

“Amitabha.” While everyone else was frightened, the monk’s eyes were bright. He looked happier than ever.

This weapon exceeded his expectations. This was a great development for Wish Ward. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“St-stop!” The general unsheathed his sword and placed it next to Yang Ling’s throat: “Li Qiye! Take off your armor or, or I’ll kill her!”

He crazily shouted while the hand holding the sword was trembling.

“Don’t listen to him, Young Master!” Yang Ling ignored her own safety.

The crowd wondered if Li Qiye would actually take off his armor in order to save Yang Ling. Doing so would make him helpless against the two clans.

“Did-did you hear me?! Take-” The general bellowed again.

A red ray a thousand times smaller than a strand of hair suddenly flashed before he could finish speaking. Only the top masters noticed the flashing ray.

It sent the general to the yellow river along with the two soldiers holding Yang Ling and her father back by penetrating their forehead.

The three had no idea what happened before dying. They had no time to scream, let alone struggling.

A few noticed that the ray came from the helmet of Li Qiye. There seemed to be a ruby hidden in the top front. It disappeared after shooting out the ray.

“The general of Dragon Abyss is a Grand Dao Sacred Physique cultivator...” Someone shuddered after seeing the death of a top expert.

“Young Master!” Yang Ling hurriedly ran over to Li Qiye’s side. Her father did the same.

“Kill him!” Golden Regiment finally launched their offense.

It wasn’t that they were slow, Li Qiye just took down Abyss Dragon in no time at all. Once they got here, their allies were already dead.

“Rumble!” The members of Golden Regiment became a flood of steel, gathering their vitality and power together.

This was a magnificent scene. The golden flood looked unstoppable like a world-ending tsunami. It could easily take down numerous mountain ranges.

Li Qiye stood before the incoming storm. He looked feeble in comparison.

He leaped up in the air and the armor plates assembled into a bronze warhead with him inside. It fell down onto the golden tsunami and instantly exploded. A cold energy rushed out and froze the entire area.

Mist and vapor shrouded the scene. Once they dispersed, the crowd became astonished by what they saw.

Black Robe Alley was frozen along with the soldiers from Golden Regiment. The latter was encapsulated in ice while still maintaining their offensive rush. Their face looked aggressive and heroic; their mouth remained open from the battle cries.

As for Li Qiye, he stood there as if he hadn’t done anything previously.

“There’s a technique like that?” They couldn’t believe it. That bomb detonated and froze an entire regiment.

Cultivators have learned ice techniques before but Li Qiye didn’t do anything like that. This was all due to the armor.

“This treasure is incredible. It’s powerful and versatile.” One ancestor commented.

“Definitely. A few can accomplish this feat, for example, the four grandmasters. I don’t know if they can do it as fast as this though.” Another expert nodded.

“I believe it is on par with a dao lord treasure.” One more added. This caused people to swallow their saliva.

“It’s way easier to use. Not just anyone can use a dao lord treasure since it requires some power. As for Li Qiye, he can control it despite being at the conqueror level. This means that anyone can wear it.” Someone else joined in.

Everyone’s heart beat faster. One sect master shouted at the monk: “Hey, is this armor for sale?!”

“Yeah, is it for sale!?” Another big shot shouted: “Just name the price when this is over. No, just give us a number right now.”

The armor was too tempting. If Wish Ward wanted to sell it, many great powers would pay any price for it.
