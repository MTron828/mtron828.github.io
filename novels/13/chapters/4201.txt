Chapter 4202: Heaven Silkworm’s Hidden Power

“Boom!” Nonetheless, it still broke through the cocoon armor. People felt terrible because a great genius was about to fall today.

Alas, during this critical juncture, an imperial aura erupted around Dong Ling and successfully stopped the slash.

His robe was destroyed, revealing a set of imperial armor. It seemed to be made from a combination of the skin of a true dragon and silkworms’ strings.

This ultimate armor clearly belonged to an ancient emperor once. It finally woke up once its master was in danger and protected him.

“Ugh…” Dong Ling still spat out blood.

“Nice!” Many shouted after seeing this. They didn’t expect him to be wearing the armor of an Immortal Emperor.

“He still had an ace card up his sleeve.” A big shot was surprised as well.

“Hmm, just how deep is his sect’s coffer. The guy has at least two treasures from ancient emperors.” An ancestor became startled.

It was common knowledge that artifacts from ancient emperors were equal to dao lord weapons.

As a supreme genius from Sea Emperor, the scion was loved by the ancestors there. However, he only had one dao lord weapon - Violet Abyss.

Remember, Sea Emperor had a total of five dao lords and was considered the strongest in Sword Continent.

On the other hand, Heaven Silkworm School was recognized as being an ancient lineage. However, they have never produced a dao lord, at least not on official records.

It turned out that Dong Ling had at least two dao lord weapons, even more so than his prestigious opponent.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“They must have incredible resources.” An envious crowd member said.

Youths enjoying the same privilege as Dong Ling could be counted on one’s hand. Of course, Li Qiye was an exception to this rule.

Meanwhile, the scion was quite surprised. He thought that Dong Ling was dead for sure after that slash.

His astonishment only increased because in the next moment, the power of his previous slash was somehow stored in Dong Ling’s Ascension Martial Dao.

Dong Ling immediately sent the same daunting slash towards its master.

“Abyss Slash!” The crowd bellowed in horror. The horrifying part was that this slash was even more powerful than the previous, destroying everything in its path.

The scion stood there in a daze for a second, not expecting that martial dao to possess this counterattack factor.

“Abyss Citadel!” He roared and created a black fortress made of swords.

“Boom!” The fortress collapsed right away.

He was confident in stopping his own slash. However, this version was actually stronger since Dong Ling’s power was added to it.

“Ahh!” The slash’s energies managed to infiltrate the scion’s body and caused grievous damage. Blood splattered while his bones crumbled during a freefall towards the ground.

“Dragonshot!” Dong Ling leaped to the air and raised his sword, leaving behind a bright trail before delivering a downward thrust towards his opponent.

The scion was powerless. In fact, he was on the verge of death and had no chance to stop the incoming beam.

“I can’t believe this!” A spectator shouted since Dong Ling was about to slay his foe. The reversal caught everyone by surprise.

Moreover, Dong Ling showed no mercy and seemed keen on killing the scion. After all, they had agreed to a fight to the death. This was not a friendly duel.

“I’m finished…” The scion himself saw the beam and knew that he was going to die.

“Show mercy!” A dignified and noble voice suddenly echoed.

In this split second, an ocean of golden particles stopped the beam and saved the scion. This naturally caught everyone by surprise.

They looked up and saw a man sitting on a throne by the clouds. He wore a royal robe and was brimming with a regal aura.

Tides ebbed and flowed beneath him as if he was the king of the ocean. His eyes were as bright as two galaxies, capable of containing the entire world.

His appearance was also impeccable, as handsome as can be. All of this culminated in a divine presence. Others couldn’t help wanting to prostrate.

The regal aura emanating from him was natural as well. He didn’t purposely put up an act to look dignified; he was merely born this way - destined to become a ruler.

“Peace Ocean Sword King!” A youth shouted after recognizing him.

“That’s Peace Ocean Sword King?!” Those who had never seen him before were shocked to see him for the first time.
