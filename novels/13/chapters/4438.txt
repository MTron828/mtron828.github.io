Chapter 4439: Dao Bone

It became abundantly clear that this tiny bone was the center of this dimension. The crystal walls merely served as a frame holding it up - the reason for its existence.

Regular cultivators had no chance of truly understanding the bone. Most would only focus on the crystal walls, unable to detect the presence of the bone.

The stronger cultivators would be able to find it. Alas, comprehending it was harder than reaching the heaven.

It contained grand dao and mysteries above their understanding and imagination. Peerless masters were no exception.

Li Qiye gently caressed the bone. It looked rather coarse but felt pleasant and smooth to touch. It reacted by emitting a faint light that expand it outward.

“Uncompleted dao yet still fought.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Things are just things, not worth risking your life like that.”

“Jiu Bian, it’s not a bad name.” Li Qiye smiled and continued to caress the bone: “Wait until the final transformation next time. The grand dao is arduous but take your time, don’t make the same mistake again.” [1]

This dao bone belonged to none other than Jiu Bian. Both combatants died in the battle.

Feng Qi left behind a dimension in Phoenix Ground while Jiu Bian left behind this one in Tiger Pond. The dimensions obtained their biggest secrets - their source and grand dao…

They have been sealed and unavailable to outsiders. However, Li Qiye was different since he had ties to both creatures.

His goal this time was to create them once more. Success meant boundless potential - two new brilliant legends for this world.

“One more time.” He spoke: “To do everything again and drop previous feuds to become a peerless legend. Otherwise, you’ll be entangled again and the result will be virtually the same.”

Having said that, he sat down on the ground and formed a mudra with both hands then chanted for the dao bone.

“Void is to be, looming above myriad existences and belonging to the source…” His voice echoed across the dimension.

As he chanted, a radiance expanded from him. As time went on, the intensifying radiance turned into a grand dao and celestials.

Peerless visual phenomena manifested into being - cycles of the dao, a true immortal descending, immaculate immortal energies…

Li Qiye turned into a true immortal and his energy nourished and woke up all living beings. The rays could turn rottenness into miracles. A blade of grass bathed in his energy would turn into a panacea. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He fused with the dimension and shared his dao and immortal energy, intending on transforming it into something greater. The visual phenomena and everything else appeared on a single whim of his. He had reached a supreme level, surpassing all else in the world.

The birth of the dao meant the birth of all things. After loud buzzes, the runes on the dao bone became illuminated.

The runic lines glowed brightly as the runes were lined up in a particular order to form coherent mantras. The dao of this new creation was in tune with Li Qiye’s own.

“Buzz.” Eventually, an entire chapter containing a supreme grand dao appeared and lit up all the crystal walls.

A mysterious mist started forming with the walls. They took the images of the various beasts but were none of them - dragon, phoenix, tiger…

After fifteen minutes, a true dragon leaped into the sky and performed a tail whip, sweeping away the celestials. They dropped to the ground and released their mysteries and life force to all else.

Next came the screech of a soaring phoenix with boundless auspiciousness. It poured down a fortune to regular mortals, making an eternal peace possible.

The mist continued to change, each just as profound and mysterious as the previous… If a peerless genius was here to see them, he could derive the various images into incredible dao. Just one alone would make him stand out in history.

Unfortunately, none was lucky enough to see them, let alone comprehend them.

Li Qiye continued to chant and bless the dao bone. Matchless essences and immortal energies gathered in his palm and transferred into the dao bone.

As they seeped into the surface, the fatal crack on the dao bone was actually being mended. Remember, this wound has lasted forever. This feat was easier said than done.

***

Back in Tiger Pond, the four demons remained patient. They knew that Li Qiye would show up eventually after leaving the secret dimension.

Days passed and sure enough, a buzz could be heard. Light appeared above the pond and eventually dispersed, revealing Li Qiye in the meditating pose.

“How are you, Sir?” Nine-tailed God came over and asked.

“Doing well.” Li Qiye got up and smiled.

“What was in there?” Ancient Pheasant couldn’t contain his curiosity.

“I’m sure you have guessed correctly, yes, it’s the secret dimension of Jiu Bian.” Li Qiye answered.

“Jiu Bian’s legacy…” Ancient Lion became emotional. The legend was indeed true.

“Would the talented descendants in the future be able to see it?” Ancient Treant took a deep breath.

“Entering isn’t that easy. Talent alone is not enough, karma and fate play a large role.” Li Qiye smiled: “Thus, if someone can actually enter, then it’ll be a great fortune for Dragon, a blessing from above.”

“That’s great.” The ancient demons rejoiced. It seemed that there was still a chance for their descendants to enter.

As long as these two secret dimensions were around, Dragon would continue to prosper.

“Don’t be so optimistic, the chance of entering is virtually negligible.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The three’s joy faded after hearing this.

1. Jiu Bian = nine transformations ?
