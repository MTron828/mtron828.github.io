Chapter 4896: Kidnapping At Night

Though the crowd was caught off guard, they had no problem with A’zhui becoming the next ruler. After all, she was Eight-stallion’s daughter and the dynasty was more than glad to have her.

The problem was the suddenness of the situation and how Li Qiye willingly passed the throne down to A’zhui.

He had changed everyone’s mind by superbly taking care of the enemies. This solidified Eight-stallion’s reign once more so they accepted him.

Now, the dynasty’s top officials were at a loss. If they were to convince him to stay, then it would be offensive to A’zhui, implying that she was not a good fit for the throne.

However, letting her take over felt strange as well. Li Qiye didn’t even have time to warm the throne before abdicating.

A’zhui herself was confused since she was unconscious earlier. Fortunately, Li Qiye didn’t leave right away so Venerable Dragon God and Northern Monarch could breathe easily.

Serenity visited the capital tonight. Its inhabitants finally relaxed for a second since they have forgotten what it was like to have a good night’s sleep recently.

Now, there was nothing threatening Eight-stallion Dynasty so it was time to rest.

Li Qiye also slept well on a tasseled bed tonight, so deep that even a falling sky wouldn’t be able to wake him up.

A figure appeared by his bed and observed him, completely shrouded in a brown uniform from top to bottom.

The only things visible were the eyes. Judging by its appearance and brightness, this was a woman.

She seemed to be peering deep into him but looked rather confused at what she found. Li Qiye himself had no idea that there was an intruder. Good dreams must be keeping him occupied.

Her uniform was thin but it didn’t depict her figure. For some strange reason, when it fluttered to the wind, so would her body. She could meld into the night, completely imperceptible to guards and patrols.

She blew out a bubble that surround Li Qiye. He still didn’t wake up as it lifted him into the air. She waved her hand and her outfit also coiled around the bubble.

Both disappeared into the night and no one in the dynasty had any idea.

A chilling night at a remote valley demanded a bonfire. This place was shielded from the loud winds, only the sounds of insects and the occasional beast roars could be heard.

The mysterious woman stared at the fiery sparks and embers in silence. As for Li Qiye, he was still sleeping inside the bubble.

It took a while before he woke up and yawned. She stared at him and became tense.

After all, she didn’t know whether she could actually stop him since the observation yielded nothing.

He seemed to be a regular cultivator but given what he had accomplished at the coronation, he was at Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s level, at the very least. He relied on the charcoal but clearly, he was unfathomable as well.

“Where is this place?” He looked around and calmly asked.

“A valley far away from Eight-stallion.” She took a deep breath and clenched her fists.

He rubbed his eyes and yawned again before staring at her: “Taking me here late at night, I believe an explanation is owed.”

After a moment of hesitation, she gritted her teeth and popped the bubble, releasing him.

“Taking me hostage?” He sat down by the bonfire and asked.

“I had some questions during your coronation yesterday, Your Majesty, so I’ve invited you here.” She gazed at his face illuminated by the bonfire and answered.

“I’m not the king of Eight-stallion anymore.” He waved his hand and said: “What questions?”

She heaved a sigh of relief because he didn’t become angry at all. There was no power fluctuation.

“My name is Jian Yunyun. I hail from the Alliance.” She introduced herself and took off her veil. [1]

The night suddenly became brighter due to her extraordinary beauty and fair skin. Her eyes were gentle like limpid autumn waters. Deep inside was also determination.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When she spoke, it could make hearts beat faster. She had a combination of both femininity and unyieldingness. Others wanted to pamper her but didn’t dare to get close.

“The Alliance.” Li Qiye sighed and said: “You were a guest from Primal Dao yesterday.” He became slightly emotional but didn’t show it.

“Yes, the Alliance and Primal Dao.” She admitted that she represented Primal Dao yesterday.

Though she was shocked by the reversal, this was not the reason why she kidnapped Li Qiye.

“This is a declaration of war against Eight-stallion.” Li Qiye smiled and played with the bonfire.

She shuddered because this was indeed risky. If Eight-stallion were to pinpoint this to their Primal Dao, they would immediately go to war.
