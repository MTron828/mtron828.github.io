Chapter 4258: Decision

“Disciples of Sea Emperor can-can’t die in vain like this!” Vastsea Venerable gritted his teeth and lost his composure. Grief and indignation took over due to the heavy losses.

Both of them thought that they were responsible for avenging their fallen members.

“What can you do about it?” Li Qiye chuckled.

His smile froze the crowd because this was indeed the truth. It had nothing to do with arrogance since he had the power to back it up. The two overlords were clearly outmatched.

Though he merely told the truth, the duo still felt as if he had just slapped them. Their pale complexion turned red. They wanted to scream and shout but that would be useless.

No one expected the top masters of the continent to fall so low, being looked down upon by their opponent. They resembled stray dogs that have lost their master.

Not long ago, they were imperious characters. Anyone talking to them did so with fear and anxiety. This was no longer the case. The abrupt shift made it difficult for the crowd to accept.

“Li, blood for blood!” The venerable roared. Alas, raising his voice caused him to tremble since it took all of his strength.

“Try your best now, I’m waiting.” Li Qiye replied.

Spectators became confused. What else did the venerable have up his sleeve? After all, he already utilized their foundation for a comprehension strike earlier. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This will not end until I taste your flesh and drink your blood!” He roared furiously.

All eyes were on him, eager to see what he had in mind. He took out an old item, looking like a shell seemingly made of bronze.

This was rather surprising because it didn’t look like a supreme artifact at all. Alas, it had to be amazing given the circumstances.

“Brother, I don’t think this is right.” The vajra hesitated and told him.

“We must pay any price today.” The venerable remained steadfast.

The vajra sighed and didn’t say anything else. After all, he wanted to avenge his fallen disciples as well.

“Ooo-” The venerable blew on the shell-like item and the sound echoed across the realms.

While listening to the sound, the crowd felt something ominous and terrible approach. The sound was akin to the wail of specters from the past. It left behind an indelible mark in their mind.

The sky suddenly turned dark, seemingly blotted by something.

“What’s going on?” People looked up and didn’t notice anything peculiar.

It wasn’t the night sky because there would be stars. Only boundless darkness was up there right now. The fear of the unknown took over. They thought that something was awakening deeper inside and staring greedily at them.

“I’m creeped out, it feels like there’s a ghost.” One expert trembled.

Others shuddered as well, thinking that they were stuck in a ghastly domain. A monster was about to emerge and devour them.

“What the hell is up there?” Heavenly gazes weren’t sufficient to see through the darkness.

“Boom!” A loud explosion caused the world to shake. Something seemed to be coming down and swept the crowd off their feet.

“What is happening?!” Numerous cultivators screamed.

An endless power manifested out of nowhere and suffocated, albeit only for a split second.

Once people got up again and stabilized, they found themselves in a different area. The sky was no longer dark.

They saw rays from the stars again. The light allowed them to get an idea of the surroundings.

“Where are we?” Most became confused.

A while ago, they were in Sword Ocean but this place was completely different. They saw mountain ranges and ancient architecture. Most buildings have collapsed due to their old age.
