Chapter 4378: Phoenix Space

The power dispersed afterward and the monarch could stand up again.

“Where are you?!” The monarch was startled since the roost was empty. He looked around and saw no sign of Li Qiye. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Moreover, the roost appeared the same as before. Even the firewood in the middle of the hole had the same glazed layer around them now. This was the case with the ashen ground as well.

Thus, everything he had witnessed just now could have been an illusion. The inferno, the phoenix cry, and the unstoppable power were no longer present.

The only change was the disappearance of Li Qiye who was meditating there. He was at a loss for words, unaware of what was real and what was not.

“Did he die?” The monarch thought that Li Qiye could have been reduced to ashes.

After all, the inferno and terrible force earlier couldn’t be stopped by many. Li Qiye probably became a victim doomed to a terrible fate.

He kept on looking around but didn’t see any sign of Li Qiye, not even his ashes. This made him certain that Li Qiye was alive.

If that’s the case, where was he?

“Impossible.” The monarch murmured and used his divine intent to scout the roost. Li Qiye must have gone somewhere else. He even speculated that the guy might have figured out the true mystery of the roost.

This made him take a deep breath. Even Divine Luan Dao Lord probably didn’t figure it out back then because she never mentioned anything to the sect.

Did this mean a new dao lord, once capable of shocking the ages, was coming?

He waited patiently instead of leaving, wanting to see the changes. As long as Li Qiye was alive, he would appear at the roost again.

Of course, he didn’t know how long he would need to wait. He entered a state of meditation for a while.

After some time, he suddenly awakened after sensing something.

“Peacock Monarch.” He sensed the aura of his peer.

In the past, they had an amicable relationship because both were demon monarchs. Goldbird respected Peacock for being powerful as well.

However, Li Qiye was a variable that changed everything. Goldbird looked around again and Li Qiye still wasn’t there. He had no choice but to leave the roost.

***

Li Qiye was indeed gone since he entered a different dimension.

“Screech.” Supreme laws floated above and poured down immortal energy. A magnificent and inscrutable rune continued to transform.

Each rotation gave birth to a new world consisting of celestials and billions of lives.

“Screech!” A phoenix crossed through the sky and poured down bright particles. Once they touched the ground, they erupted in a magnificent manner and released a wondrous sound. This was a melody of a supreme grand dao.

When the screech dissipated, so did the image of the phoenix. This was another rotation - the screech, image, and the melody…

The great phoenix continued to appear and disappear - a process seemingly lasting for an eternity.

Thus, there was no flow of time in this dimension. A million years could pass in the blink of an eye during the continuing cycle.

“Phoenix Space.” Li Qiye said while observing the spectacle.

This was a dimension unavailable to regular people. Not even invincible dao lords could reach it. Only an immortal beast in the legend like a phoenix had this ability.

It required all the perfect circumstances and timing. Using brute force alone was not enough. This was the case for Li Qiye.

However, he had set up these circumstances and planted the seeds a long time ago. Thus, he was able to enter.

All in all, immortal beasts only existed in the legends. If there were no immortals, there were no immortal beasts either.

Most believed that phoenixes didn’t exist in reality, so they had no idea about a dimension like this.

Li Qiye focused on the massive rune in the sky. It was the ruler of this place and the skeleton of this space. Its presence allowed the special dimension to exist.

“Screech!” The cycle continued above.

“Rebirth, the innate gift of a phoenix.” Li Qiye commented.

Of course, these images weren’t phoenixes. However, their appearance had the same type of cyclic rebirth.

If anyone were to somehow see this cycle, they would attribute it to mere illusory images. They didn’t know that the cycle contained the mysteries behind rebirth.

All immortal beasts had a unique innate gift. Rebirth was given to phoenixes. While watching this scene, one might think that there was only one phoenix in existence. It had undergone this cycle and appeared time and time again in history.

Li Qiye’s eyes were focused on the area beneath the rune where there were golden threads of energy brimming with life.
