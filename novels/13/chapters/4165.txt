Chapter 4166: Meeting Again

“Clank!” Pulsing sword energies immediately attacked the intruder.

“Ahh!” The cultivator’s arm was reduced to blood. He lost his balance and fell into the river while screaming repeatedly. His body then suffered the same fate as his arm. Nothing was left behind.

The spectators didn’t pay that much attention to his gruesome death. Their focus was still on the divine sword.

“It’s sinking!” Someone shouted.

The sword disappeared for a bit before reemerging again a few seconds later.

“Now!” One ancestor rushed forward with lightning speed.

The sword energies from the current attacked him with haste. Nonetheless, he was prepared for this and summoned a tripod. It released countless dao laws serving as a barrier in front of him.

Though he was powerful, the dao laws were cut through, leaving the tripod as the last line of defense. He swung it forward and it was still pierced through. Thus, he became frightened and retreated with lightning speed.

Alas, he still groaned once since one ray pierced through his left shoulder, leaving him bloodied.

This served as a good lesson for the nearby cultivators. Even a mighty ancestor stood no chance against this river, or so they thought.

Another newcomer decided to give this a shot. A sweet fragrance permeated the air then came a violet aura.

They saw a girl gliding across the air. She raised her hand and released a long silk string towards the sword.

“Fire-and-Ice Sword!” Someone shouted after seeing her.

“Clank!” The sword energies crushed the string then rampaged towards her direction.

She became alarmed because she maintained a safe distance from the river, choosing to use the silk instead.

In this split second, she performed dozens of stepping techniques for spatial leaps. Her figure and beauty charmed the crowd, especially her fans.

“Boom!” She successfully evaded the slashes. Deep scars were left on the shore.

“They actually attack that far?” Experts took a deep breath because the princess was nearly killed.

“It’s just too strong.” They could only watch the sword flow away.

“But look, the princess is completely unharmed. She’s worthy of being the successor from two schools.” One male youth couldn’t help but praise. Even the older cultivators were impressed by her agility.

“I thought that this is the outermost region, the simplest one?” Someone said: “How can this be the weakest with this level of sword energy around? No one can get a divine sword here.”

“Just gotta get lucky with the straddlers.” A high elder smiled wryly.

“Yes, it’s a matter of luck if one wishes to survive. Rumor has it that Sea Sword Dao Lord found his dao and sword on the shore.” An aged cultivator said.

“Really?” This piqued the crowd’s interest.

“It’s just a rumor.” The old man said: “But the dao lord never denied it.”

“Just have to keep trying then.” Others decided to rely on luck like a blind cat coming across a mouse.

There was nothing else they could do. The sword energies from the river were too powerful and robbed them of their confidence.

Snowcloud Princess sighed while looking at the river, realizing that she wasn’t strong enough to grasp a divine sword from there. Plus, there was no need to throw away her life for one.

As she was leaving, many youths came over and greeted her. She politely answered back before leaving.

Some still wanted to tag along but she was too fast for them to keep up.

She moved across the shore and observed the river along the way. Though she gave up on a direct attempt, she still wanted to understand the river.

This phenomenon was unique in Sword Burial Zone. This was a great learning opportunity.

She occasionally saw more divine swords floating down the river but didn’t become greedy. As she delved further, she realized that the sword energies were becoming stronger.

It wasn’t enough to stop her right now but that would only be a matter of time. The majority of cultivators didn’t make it as far as her. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They simply wanted to test their luck and find abandoned swords. That’s why they chose the safer areas.

As for her, she was strong enough and had ample treasures to deal with the various dangers looming here.

At one particular turn, she nearly died to a sword ray but a peerless treasure saved her. She became hesitant and wondered if this was it for her journey.

But, something in the distance caught her eyes - a man sitting with both feet dipped in the water, looking quite relaxed.

Seeing people playing in the water wasn’t surprising in other rivers. However, this was Sword River. Doing so would result in losing their feet.

Strangely enough, this didn’t happen to the man. The current acted like normal water instead of metals.

“Young Noble Li!” She shuddered after seeing him clearly.

It was none other than Li Qiye. However, he was alone and didn’t have an entourage with him. He kicked his legs back and forth, looking like a happy child.

He no longer resembled the pompous young master or the devilish murderer, only a content village child getting to play.

She took a deep breath and approached closer. She bowed deeply and said: “It’s a pleasure to see you again after Cloud Dream Lake, Young Noble. You’re as unpredictable as always.”

Li Qiye didn’t answer and simply tapped the boulder next to him.

She sat down and looked at his feet. Of course, she didn’t dare to do the same.
