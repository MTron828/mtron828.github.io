Chapter 4915: Discerning Glance

Ming Shi circled several times around Li Qiye as if wanting to help Yunyun out by assessing her suitor.

“Hmm…” She walked like an old man with both hands behind her back: “Brat, do you know how lucky you are?”

“How so?” Li Qiye smiled.

“You really have no idea?” She crossed her arms in front of her chest and said: “Look at Big Sis’ cultivation, she is undoubtedly a genius.”

With that, she gave him the side-eye and continued: “Then look at how beautiful she is too, everyone in Abroad knows of her fair skin and gorgeous face. This is before taking her prestigious background into account, the successor of The Alliance.”

“And?” Li Qiye asked.

“And? That’s how lucky you are, it is the blessing of three lifetimes. She is excellent in all categories and has enough suitors to make a line through the academy yet you were chosen to be her boyfriend. A guy can’t ask for more.” Ming Shi finished.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Ming Shi, enough, don’t spread rumors about the young noble.” Yunyun shook her head.

“Sigh, so quick to help your boyfriend.” Ming Shi glared at her in response: “You’re the lord of Primal soon. Not to mention just the academy, the entire world doesn’t have that many suitors worthy of your hand. Now, you’re worrying about his prestige instead of your own? That’s so strange. I guess that is what love does to women, wanting to be subservient. Big Sis, you need to clear your head.”

“It is because you don’t see Young Noble Li’s peerless status.” Yunyun smiled wryly.

This was indeed the truth. Li Qiye was the king of Eight-stallion before he passed the throne to someone else. He had Venerable Dragon God and Northern Monarch beneath him.

“Oh?” Ming Shi remained skeptical as she stared at Li Qiye: “Young Noble, where are you from? I’m afraid I don’t see it.”

She shared the impression as many others when it came to Li Qiye and didn’t understand why Yunyun viewed him so highly.

“I’m just a regular guy.” Li Qiye smiled.

“No, you are lying to me. My Big Sis doesn’t care for the geniuses from Deity, Luminous, or Heaven Burial. There must be something special about you.” Ming Shi said.

“Ming Shi, watch your words.” Yunyun didn’t want Ming Shi to offend Li Qiye.

Though she didn’t understand Li Qiye completely, she could tell that he was ruthless. She recalled how he executed three monsters without batting an eye.

“No, I will have to see what he has to charm you so deeply.” Ming Shi’s eyes shifted between the two of them.

“Go for it then.” Li Qiye seemed amused.

The girl circled around Li Qiye several more times before giving up: “Forget it, I don’t see anything.”

Yunyun was not a weak girl but seemed to be overly accommodating to Li Qiye. This didn’t make sense to Ming Shi.

“Well, I see something about you.” Li Qiye said.

Ming Shi snorted in response and said: “I doubt you can notice anything.”

“You are a rabbit demon.” He smiled.

“That’s no secret at all.” Ming Shi said before complaining to Yunyun: “Sis, you told him everything already?”

Many in Abroad knew about her origin so this wasn’t really a secret. She thought that Yunyun had told him.

“Why would I talk about you with him?” Yunyun shook her head.

Ming Shi believed this and said: “Fine, let’s see what else you can tell.”

She felt a little uncomfortable by his piercing gaze. Nonetheless, she still arched her chest proudly, waiting for a response.

“Hmm, I don’t know if I should reveal your secrets.” Li Qiye hesitated.

“Do it, show me what you can do.” She thought that he was bullshitting.

“During your transformation, your dao had flaws so you suffered from qi deviation.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

This stunned Ming Shi and he went on: “You would have died if it wasn’t for a capable senior saving you, using Gods’ Art to stabilize your mind and recraft your dao foundation.”

“Tendril King!” Yunyun knew who it was right away.

Ming Shi didn’t respond because this was indeed a secret. She came from Untethered and was considered a top genius. However, there was someone more talented than her - Senior Uncle Tendril King.

Despite being her martial uncle, he wasn’t that much older and could still be considered a part of the young generation.

He was the number one genius in Untethered and was renowned in the lower continents. Everyone knew that he was a direct disciple of Stone Ox, the only dragon lord with seven sacred fruits in this region.

He was strong enough to defeat most dragon lords from the last generation, let alone his peers.

Ming Shi didn’t know how Li Qiye knew this but it was all true. Another disciple could only wait for death since it required the help of a powerful cultivator.

She was a top genius but there were many like her in Untethered. Nonetheless, Tendril King took action and used the Gods’ Art to save her. This actually boosted her foundation as well.

This matter was only known by a few seniors in Untethered.

“How-how do you know?” She stammered.

“I can sense the Gods’ Art on you.” Li Qiye waved his hand as if this wasn’t a big deal.
