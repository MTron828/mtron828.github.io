Chapter 4565: Immortal Monarch

Cultivators watched Si Jingru and the sect master of True Immortal with bated breath.

The representative of Ancestral Divine Temple had officially stated its position to support Li Qiye. What would be the outcome of the temple going to war with True Immortal?

Everyone became emotional while thinking about the possibilities.

“Will there be war?” A big shot wondered.

“In that case, no one can predict what happen. I’m afraid the death toll will be insane and Sky Border will change.” A powerful ancestor quietly answered with a solemn expression.

True Immortal’s domination has been well-documented. They had been the number one sect for a long period. Who could truly contend against them right now?

Of course, this didn’t mean that they were unbeatable and could easily destroy Ancestral Divine Temple.

Lion’s Roar was still the leader of the south and one of the strongest lineages in Sky Border. Though both Lion’s Roar and the temple have been rather reclusive, this didn’t mean that they were weak.

Both had plenty of hidden dragons and tigers. Both True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao wouldn’t offend them for no reason. This was mainly due to the existence of a particular being - the Supreme Monarch.

Dao lords and top ancient ancestors have never dared to disrespect the Supreme Monarch. True Immortal might not be the favorite in an all-out war.

“The two behemoths won’t go to war so easily.” An ancient ancestor evaluated the situation.

The majority of his peers agreed with him. True Immortal could easily destroy weaker sects. However, to defeat Ancestral Divine Temple meant paying a heavy price. Perhaps it would be no different from what Emperor Ye did to them - generations of declination.

Moreover, blood would flow like rivers. All of Sky Border would be tormented and ravaged by the flames of war. In fact, both sides could go down from this conflict.

Therefore, logic forced True Immortal to act wisely here.

The crowd wondered how the sect master of True Immortal would react after hearing about Li Qiye’s true backer. Would he do everything to avenge his disciple?

Suddenly, a dao note could be heard and heavenly flowers fell down. Transcending melodies could be heard and wondrous rays descended.

It was as if there was a paradise beyond the clouds - the place where an Immortal Monarch sat on his throne. The leaking aura alone left everyone in shambles. They felt like ants in comparison.

They have yet to see this cultivator from True Immortal but already felt overwhelmed.

“A peerless ancient ancestor that has weathered the river of time.” Even ancestors and high elders felt chills coursing down their spine.

“No, it’s an Immortal Monarch…” Someone murmured.

Ancient Ancestors from True Immortal were top beings. Among them, those capable of having the title Immortal Monarch were even rarer.

They were the pillars of True Immortal - the reason for its long-lasting foundation. Rumor has it that they could fight dao lords evenly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The sect master’s pressure was not comparable to this even though the monarch has yet to show their face. Experts and ancestors bowed toward the clouds while feeling trepidation.

“Boom!” Something else seized their attention.

A beam shot into the air from the Yang Cemetery, piercing through the sky and leaving a void hole behind. Time suddenly came to a stop or became infinitely slower.

“The ancestor is here.” The upper echelon of True Immortal took a deep breath after seeing the beam.

“Everlasting Monarch…” Both the Immortal Monarch from True Immortal and Heavenly Monarch from Three Thousand Dao became emotional.

This title carried ample clout since it belonged to a man comparable to a dao lord. If he was still alive, he would still dominate the world.

A middle-aged man was seen strolling leisurely out of the cemetery. Each step took him one thousand miles.

People couldn’t help themselves from respecting this godlike cultivator. He had no sign of death on him and simply looked like an elegant noble. Judging by his appearance alone, one would mistake him for a regular person.

Time didn’t leave its mark on him as if he could walk untethered on the river of time. Despite his lack of aura, everyone viewed him as an immortal walking in the mortal world.

“So transcending.” Skybreak Monarch sighed and said.

Once Everlasting Monarch got close enough, people started bowing deeply in his direction.
