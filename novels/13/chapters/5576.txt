Chapter 5577: Few Were Worthy Challengers

Turmoil Conqueror wore an ugly expression since this was his toughest obstacle since his dao debut.

His talisman attack could eradicate a kingdom without any problem. Now, his opponent didn’t bother to look at him during the fight. The guy might be right - his attack couldn’t scratch an itch well enough.

Being humiliated was one thing but in reality, he knew that this old demon was far beyond his level. What could he do to regain face?

“Such a mighty defense.” One of the Five Elders commented: “Dao Brother, we hope to learn from you. Let us see how many more of us you can block.”

The elders exchanged glances and wanted to join the battle.

“All of you can come together, I don’t care.” Niu Fen boldly showed off with extraordinary confidence, provoking the entire audience.

“Very well, we admire your style and will be displaying our slight skills.” The five elders became agitated.

“Try this seal, Dao Brother!” They roared in unison.

“Boom!” A total of five seals soared upward with loud detonations.

They came from five different directions and seemed to be pushing the world downward. The five gathered together and released a devastating inferno, burning the nearby vicinity.

A mountain manifested into reality and exuded five colors, temporarily blinding the audience. It also robbed them of strength, causing them to fall to the ground.

“Be careful!” A dragon lord shouted after seeing her peers fall.

“Boom!” This had enough power to overwhelm some emperors and monarchs. When these elders worked together, they became ten times stronger.

“Bam!” The five-colored mountain engulfed in flames descended but was also stopped by the shell.

“Excuse me, Dao Brother!” Jadesword Conqueror’s battle spirit surged.

After a sword hymn, an ocean of swords appeared around Niu Fen, initiating a relentless onslaught.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The sharp aura alone inflicted pain on the spectators' neck.

“Boom!” Niu Fen’s barrier around his shell still blocked everything. He then activated his power and the eighteen solutions, strengthening the shell.

A total of eight top cultivators utilized their strongest offense yet still couldn’t take him down. His shell seemed capable of withstanding the most frightening attacks.

“Is that all?” He laughed and swung his shell, shooting supreme dao laws upward.

“Boom!” This sent the five elders flying, somersaulting several times before stabilizing. As for the conquerors, they staggered dozens of steps backward before steadying.

This naturally astounded the crowd. Not only did they fail to injure the old demon, but they were sent flying from a single swing - the disparity in power was obvious at this point.

The attackers became alarmed, realizing the frightening power of the enemy.

“Immortal shell, right?” Spectators speculated. The old demon should at least have an immortal shell to dominate everyone in this manner.

“Maybe anima already…” A conqueror said with a serious expression.

Just Niu Fen alone prevented the crowd from interfering with Li Qiye’s refinement process.

“Dao Brother, you ascended from Eight Desolaces?” Six-finger Conqueror asked seriously.

He couldn’t connect Niu Fen to any famous cultivator from the immortal continent. After all, someone this powerful couldn’t possibly be unknown to the rest of the world. Therefore, there was a high chance this guy might be from Eight Desolaces.

The cultivators from there were incredible; most managed to reach the apex.

“So what if I am? I still dominated this continent when I ascended. Few were worthy challengers.” Niu Fen laughed, offending the crowd and everyone else living on the immortal continent.

Nonetheless, an apex dao lord like himself had the right to brag. Only a selected few could defeat him.

“You have reached the truth, Dao Brother?” Jadesword Conqueror asked.

“Was that supposed to be challenging?” Niu Fen raised his voice and left everyone speechless.

No one here had been able to reach the truth and obtain anima. Even supreme geniuses found this to be an exceedingly difficult task.
