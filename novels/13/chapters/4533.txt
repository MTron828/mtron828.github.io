Chapter 4534: Home Of The Dead

Yu Zun invited the two ancestors to sit down while stealing glances at Li Qiye. He was curious and frustrated about Li Qiye being an ancient ancestor.

No matter the angles, the guy didn’t resemble an anciesnt ancestor. He even seemed inferior to Wise Ancestor. However, he could tell that Wise was following Li Qiye’s lead so he didn’t dare to say anything.

“Ancestors, may I humbly ask for the purpose of your visit?” He cupped his fist.

“I’m afraid it is something that will trouble you, Virtuous Nephew.” Wise smiled.

“Ancestor, please let me know. We will do everything in our power to assist you.” Yu Zun replied.

His enthusiasm caught Wise by surprise. There were old ties between them and this was strengthened after the marriage.

Alas, due to the Yu’s special circumstances, they rarely interacted and kept a distance. Therefore, from another perspective, their relationship was awfully weak.

Wise was ready for the Yu to refuse the request. If he were to let them know how important the dao stone was, their villainous blood might make them extort him.

In reality, the entire clan has been treating them awfully well. He pondered for a bit and got straight to the point: “When the ancestral aunt went to your clan, her dowry included something that belong to the four clans. The reason for our visit today is to take it back.”

“The dowry?” The clan master didn’t expect the reason for this visit. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The two parties rarely mingled, Jian Ming was an exception. Therefore, he assumed that it would be something of significance to have two ancestors arriving.

He pondered a bit before responding: “I’m afraid this is rather difficult. Ancestors, there married was a very long time ago and the ancestral aunt’s branch is all but gone. Finding something that old will be challenging.”

“This is why we need your help, Virtuous Nephew.” Wise said.

“May I ask what it is?” Yu Zun asked.

“A dao stone, it was special to the ancestral aunt.” Jian MIng said: “Think about it, do you remember anything? Ask some old men.”

“Well…” Yu Zun said with uncertainty: “I know about it but I’m not that sure. The dowry was generous back then.”

Having said that, he smiled awkwardly and added: “You know about our situation. Normally, when disciples or even ancestors pass, their funeral arrangements would be done on the spot. This applied to the ancestral aunt as well. We descendants don’t know much about it anymore.”

They had a nomadic lifestyle so whenever a member passed away, they would be buried on the spot if they didn’t want cremation. Because of how much time had passed, they didn’t know the location of the ancestral aunt’s grave.

“It was a very special item, I’m sure the ancestral aunt was attached to it.” Jian Ming said: “Fatty, think carefully, this is very important.”

“Mmm…” Yu Zun didn’t dare to be careless after hearing this. In recent years, Jian Ming have helped them out with getting rid of merchandises. This was a huge favor.

“Now that I think about it, there is really something.” He responded after a moment of contemplation: “It is not with the ancestral aunt but rather, Pioneer Ancestor.”

Pioneer Ancestor was renowned and mighty, the husband of the ancestral aunt.

“He always carried something with him and had it with him before burial, nothing else. From what I’ve heard, it could be your dao stone.” He said.

“Where is his grave?” Jian Ming couldn’t wait.

“I can answer this question. He is one of the few who has a chosen place for his grave.” He answered.

“A chosen place?” Wise found this surprising given the nomadic nature of their clan.

“We didn’t keep track of all the graves but Pioneer Ancestor was different. He already picked a spot when he was still alive.” He added.

“Where is it?” Wise asked.

“Yin Yang Crossing.” He became serious as he answered.

“Yin Yang Crossing?!” Jian Ming became startled.

“What did your ancestor want to do? To live again or to enter the reincarnation cycle?” The daoist felt the same way.

“We aren’t sure.” He shook his head: “He’s the only one who chose Yin Yang Crossing, according to our sparse records.”

“It’s a place for the death, excavating a grave there won’t be easy.” Wise’s expression soured.

“Indeed.” He smiled wryly: “Rumor has it that he had a plan and everything. Once he died, the disciples of our clan only carried him to the entrance and didn’t dare to enter.”

“That place is no joke.” The daoist said: “Just entering should be fine but digging a grave? That’s fundamentally different and will alert the dead. Numerous invincible beings have been buried there and their corpses might wake up. They’ll be just as strong as before.”

“Right, it is a devilish place.” Jian Ming smiled wryly.

Wise thought of a worse possibility: “What if your ancestor has finished the crossing? The dao stone would be gone then.”

“There is good news, the seniors have said that with a successful crossing, his lamp in our clan will extinguish due to him entering the reincarnation cycle. The lamp is still lit so I don’t think he has crossed over yet.”

“Should we go to that cursed place?” Jian Ming was afraid of digging up a grave surrounded by the dead.

“What else can we do?” Wise said.

On the other hand, the daoist was interested in this: “Did your ancestor obtain a fortune or know something? Why did he choose that place?”
