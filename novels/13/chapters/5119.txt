Chapter 5120: A Secret

Greenmountain was stomped to death like a cockroach, always reviled instead of celebrated. This was an uncommon end for conquerors.

Normally, regardless of the conqueror’s personality and morality, they would at least have some fans. A few might remember them or have a different perspective than the rest.

In this case, Greenmountain had earned the hatred of the entire lower continents.

“Save yourself for no one else will save you.” Li Qiye commented while glancing at the abyss.

Meanwhile, people required a moment to regain their composure, wondering about their own ancestors and conquerors.

This was especially true for the dao lineages since their progenitors were conquerors. Could the same happen to them one day - their revered ancestors becoming devils?

The next thing everyone did was kneel in the direction of Li Qiye and perform a full kowtow to show respect. The lower continents would have been doomed without his involvement.

He didn’t belong to any lineage as far as they knew but still prevented the worst. This was their way of showing gratitude.

He sighed and shook his head before returning to Eight-stallion Dynasty.

Light returned to the three continents and their inhabitants celebrated the occasion. They found a revitalized appreciation for just being alive. The storm was finally over and the sun rose again.

Back in Eight-stallion, Li Qiye relaxed on a long chair and enjoyed the sun. A’zhui stood next to him and said softly: “I won’t seek revenge.”

“Oh? Then what will you do?” He glanced at her.

“Finish my father’s business. Chaos is still chaotic, he never stopped working.” She said.

The battle earlier had a profound effect on her, even more so than her father’s death. His death was akin to the sky falling down but it wasn’t the most terrifying thing.

She was still a princess with loyal protectors such as Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God. The dynasty was on her side.

Though she wanted revenge, she knew that it was no way to live. Her father wouldn’t be able to come back anyway.

On the other hand, the path of vengeance might take her on the wrong path. She might drag Eight-stallion down to the abyss, causing many deaths along the way.

Her father wouldn’t want to see this for he was a protector. Continuing his legacy and protecting the dynasty became her wish out of respect.

She had received plenty of love from her father and his dynasty. It was improper to abandon this for her own personal wishes.

“Remember, your father, when alive, was a great dao lord, and a hero in death as well.” Li Qiye said.

“I know.” A’zhui bowed and said: “I will work for this world, what my father did, I shall continue to do. Chaos will change its name one day.”

Li Qiye smiled and touched the top of her head, sending a faint light inside her mind. He then closed his eyes.

She bowed again and left.

After a long while, another person sat down next to him - Conceal Conqueror.

“Shouldn’t you tell the little girl? She has the right to know.” He spoke without opening his eyes.

“No.” She paused for a bit before answering. Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t pursue the issue.

“You’re ascending soon?” She asked after a brief silence.

“Yes, I am finished with my business here, it’s time to move on.” Li Qiye said.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

She seemed to have something on her mind.

“Returning to Celestial Court? If I see you there, I will not show mercy even if you are the successor of the dao heart kill.” Li Qiye spoke with a calm yet merciless tone.

“I understand.” She nodded, aware that he wasn’t joking around: “Celestial Court doesn’t have to be my home.”

“Indeed, The Race’s members don’t need to think about it like that.” Li Qiye said lazily.

“I’m not returning to Deity either.” She said.

“No rebuilding?” He glanced at her.

“No, there is an end to everything. I will leave Godchaser as it is.” She shook her head.

“Correct, no sects last forever, it’s only a matter of time.” Li Qiye said.

It wasn’t difficult for her to rebuild Godchaser and make it the strongest sect in the lower continents again. Others might be unable to separate themselves from these attachments but not her.

“What will you do then?” Li Qiye asked.

“Cultivation, seeking one dao alone - dao heart kill.” Conceal said.

“Yes, just one dao alone is enough to be unbeatable.” Li Qiye smiled: “The crucial thing is to gain an immovable dao heart, that’s the only way to reach your desired level.”

“I understand.” She nodded.
