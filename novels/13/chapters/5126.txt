Chapter 5127: Blessed Dao Lord

“Hmm, Yin Sever Aqua.” Li Qiye sighed and thought about the requirements.

Reviving the corpse required more than just this liquid. A supreme vein as energy was needed as well on top of a supreme coffin.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The problem was finding this liquid in the mortal world was nearly impossible. He only saw it once during his life.

“Let me see again.” He activated his heavenly gaze in order to calculate all the ages.

“Boom!” The power of time and karma didn’t let him off easily, instantly pouring into him.

Billions of years with the accumulation of karmic ties tried to cut him down. He utilized the primordial power for self-protection and focused on the search.

Smoke surrounded him as if he was being boiled.

“Yin Sever Liquid first.” He said softly: “You gave up your life for something and I shall drag it back to find out.”

Despite her immense power, she still lost her life here. No, she deliberately did so in order to tell Li Qiye something.

With that, he sealed the corpse and entered a great realm blessed by the fortunes of the world.

It looked like an immortal paradise with incredible cities. The sounds of the dao could be heard everywhere, allowing its inhabitants to accomplish magnificent feats.

Heavenly flowers and laws hovered in the air. Comprehension was extremely easy here, making this the pinnacle of all treasure lands.

“Boom!” A supreme god immediately stopped Li Qiye from entering.

“The Realm of Blessed lies before you, Fellow Daoist. A disaster approaches for His Venerable, please leave.” The god had a resonating voice.

“I am not interested in Blessed or his disaster, I will leave after getting one thing.” Li Qiye smiled in response.

“What is it?” The god stared intensely at Li Qiye.

“Yin Sever Aqua, I know that he has a bottle.” Li Qiye smiled.

The god’s expression changed as he raised his voice: “This water separates life and death, it is not for you. Leave!”

“I’m not asking.” Li Qiye said.

“Boom!” The god activated his power and trapped the area into an endless cycle.

“Stop!” Someone arrived on the scene and raised a badge: “Blessed has given the order for you to stop!”

The god glanced at the badge and then at Li Qiye before disappearing from sight.

The newcomer smiled at Li Qiye and bowed: “I thought I would be able to see you again, but not this soon.”

She normally had a stoic expression but was happy to see him. She was none other than Lin Mo - an ancient ancestor of True Immortal and Blessed Dao Lord’s younger sister.

“You found your older brother.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I owe it to you, Young Noble.” She responded and led him inside the city.

There were many top cultivators along the way but Li Qiye was not interested. He always wore a natural and calm expression regardless of time and place.

“My older brother will not be able to leave his isolated training due to the impending disaster.” She said.

“I’m not here to see him, I want his bottle of Yin Sever Aqua.” Li Qiye said.

The top cultivators became annoyed after hearing this. They were the lords of this region yet Li Qiye showed them zero respect.

In fact, even the representatives of Celestial Court and Immortal City wouldn’t dare to be arrogant here.

As for Li Qiye, he was sitting on the throne itself while making unreasonable demands.

“Young Noble, we shall give it to you.” Lin Mo agreed since she understood her brother very well.

“Good.” Li Qiye didn’t hold back since he wanted the bottle regardless of the method.

This was a priceless treasure capable of separating life and death. Numerous cultivators in the six continents wanted it but Blessed was the only one. Of course, it took untold effort as well.

“My brother only has this bottle.” Lin Mo returned and handed it to Li Qiye.

“I’ll take it.” Li Qiye nodded.

Anyone else would have needed to pay an immeasurable price for the bottle regardless of their power and status. Alas, Li Qiye was an exception.

“Where will you go next, Young Noble?” She asked.

“Need a few more items to save someone.” He smiled.

“It must be someone special to warrant your involvement.” Despite her short time with Li Qiye, she knew that he always finished his mission.

Therefore, she agreed to the matter right away to avoid any complications. Moreover, she also witnessed him killing the overlords. It would be foolish to go against him.

“Staying here is not a bad choice for you.” He said.

“Yes, I’ve made some progress and might start over.” She nodded.

“It’ll be a long road.” He became interested.

Due to her impressive cultivation, breaking the foundation and starting over again would be far from easy. Moreover, there was a high chance of failure so most would never take the risk.

“I must in order to go even farther. Otherwise, my disaster will come soon.” She said.

“Commendable determination.” He said: “Very well, I won’t take your bottle for nothing, I will bestow a fortune in return.”

“Buzz.” His eyes became piercing as he gathered power to deliver a supreme law into her body, paying back the favor.
