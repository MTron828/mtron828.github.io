Chapter 5567: Not The Realm Of The High Heaven

“So an immortal sword?” Baifeng said. That strange throwing star with three prongs earlier was frightening, was this sword on the same level?

“Please elaborate.” She couldn’t help but ask.

She once thought that paragon artifacts were the strongest. However, she had only heard of them through legends.

“I haven’t seen it, just a sword capable of slaying immortals. I only know that it is inside Sword Burial Ground, no one has seen it before.” Niu Fen shook his head before asking Li Qiye: “Young Master, have you seen it?”

“Immortal swords certainly don’t exist.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Haha, at least for cultivators, anything beyond their imagination is at the immortal level. In my opinion, only pseudo ones are around.” Niu Fen shrugged.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye agreed.

“Where did these pseudo ones come from then? Is that the future destination for our cultivation?” Baifeng couldn’t help but ask.

“Hard, unimaginably hard.” Niu Fen said: “From what I know, most pseudo-immortals are born that way, to reach this level through cultivation is virtually impossible, maybe only a few instances in history.”

“Pseudo immortals certainly do not belong to this world.” Li Qiye said.

“Then where did they come from?” Baifeng asked.

“An unknown place above.” Niu Fen glanced at the sky.

“There is another world beyond ours?” Baifeng looked up as well.

She was aware of the six continents and Eight Desolaces mentioned by many dao lords. She hasn’t been to the upper and lower continents. Eight Desolaces, the birthplace of the dao lords, was even more impossible given her power.

In fact, she hasn’t heard of anyone capable of reaching Eight Desolaces. This seemed to be a one-way trip - just powerful cultivators from Eight Desolaces coming to the six continents including Cloudsweep Fairy.

“Young Master, I heard that it was an immortal realm?” Niu Fen smiled.

“What else did you hear?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hmm, how should I put this? Given my speculation regarding the emperors and monarchs who have surpassed the tribulations, I believe there is another world above the heavens. There’s no record of it, I just know that it must be there.” Niu Fen said.

He paused for a bit and said: “Some have embarked on this journey previously, for example, our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s Immortal Emperor Min Ren and many others.”

With that, he laughed and said with a mysterious expression: “Young Master, do you know of anyone else who has researched or actually been there?”

Li Qiye chuckled and slapped him playfully: “Don’t try these tricks on me.”

“Hehe, I’m just curious, that’s all. I know that it is there.” Niu Fen smiled.

He simply lacked actual evidence regarding its existence. Nonetheless, this was a path all apex cultivators pondered for the future.

Baifeng listened attentively regarding these great secrets, not missing a single word.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“What you refer to as an immortal realm is far from a paradise but it does exist. If we compare it to the six continents or Eight Desolaces, using the word ‘immortal’ isn’t out of line.” Li Qiye revealed.

“What should we call it then?” Niu Fen had a calm reaction, unlike Baifeng who was astonished by the confirmation.

“Heaven Realm.” Li Qiye glanced upward as well.

“Heaven Realm.” Niu Fen murmured the name of the mysterious location researched by all top cultivators in history.

“The realm of the high heaven.” Niu Fen remarked.

“Not like that, it is just the place closest to the old villainous heaven.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So isn’t it the scariest place, who can survive tribulations when they’re that close?” Niu Fen stuck out his tongue.

“Would you always throw lightning bolts in front of your house each day?” Li Qiye asked.

“Huh? True.” Niu Fen agreed.

“So what is it like?” Baifeng was full of curiosity about this legendary and unreachable world.

“To put it briefly, it is a place more suitable for cultivation compared to the six continents and Eight Desolaces. Energies found naturally are extremely dense. What is considered rare here is just commonplace up there.” Li Qiye said.

“Does that mean everyone can become dragon lords or even conquerors and dao lords? Cultivation would soar rapidly.” Baifeng speculated.

“You have to get up there first, I’m afraid that you would die before making it that far.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Right.” Baifeng found this reasonable. If it were so easy, so many top cultivators would have ascended.

“That’s where I have to go for my training, a paradise for unbeatable cultivators such as myself.” Niu Fen laughed and declared.

“Nice fantasy, you’ll be sauteed or boiled the moment you get there. Unfortunately, so tiny that you won’t be a decent appetizer.” Li Qiye ruined his daydreaming.

“Isn’t that an exaggeration, haha?” Niu Fen chuckled but was losing confidence.

“Why doesn't everyone go if it is such a nice place?” Li Qiye asked.

“Perilous for sure.” Niu Fen said: “There are hunters.”

“Things will change because the plot of land will be cultivated.” Li Qiye glanced up again.

“Cultivated? In what ways?” Niu Fen asked.

“Eliminate the pests, plow the fields, and ample irrigation of lightning bolts. After the chilling winter comes spring.” Li Qiye said.

“I love spring.” Niu Fen said excitedly.

Li Qiye gave him the side eye and didn’t respond.

“Buzz.” A frightening ray flashed in an unknown location, capable of piercing or decapitating anyone.

Niu Fen and Baifeng felt a sharp pain as if their heart had been pierced.

“It’s showing up again.” Baifeng said, recognizing the aura of the so-called immortal weapon.

“It’s awakening and will try to run.” Li Qiye said.

“We have to hurry then.” Niu Fen became anxious and increased his speed toward the source of the flash.
