Chapter 5086: S-save me

“Not bad at all, a great fortune.” Li Qiye naturally took a look at this famous boulder and nodded approvingly.

The boulder seemed to have heard Li Qiye’s praise and lowered his head in Li Qiye’s direction.

Li Qiye didn’t stop and visited another lineage - Heaven Burial. It possessed a unique and domineering aura - a confidence of burying the heaven eventually with its dao.

In fact, any visitor would feel tiny and insignificant here. After all, even the heaven above could be buried, let alone them.

This lineage was considered only second to Deity among The Race. Its founder was Heaven Burial Conqueror - a frightening cultivator.

Not to mention regular cultivators, other dragon lords and conquerors didn’t dare to confront him. He held a pivotal position in Celestial Court.

In fact, some believed that he could become its next lord - a testament to his ability. His history was just as impressive, potentially being the second dao lord in the history of the six continents.

Rumor has it that there was someone before him - Martial Conqueror. This conqueror was blessed with good luck and obtained a fortune allowing him to reach the apex. His only fault was being born in the same generation as Heaven Burial.

Due to Heaven Burial’s exceptional talent, Celestial Court decided to fully support him. They ambushed Martial Conqueror and allowed Heaven Burial to seize his dao fruit. With that, he officially became a conqueror.

Of course, none of this has been verified. This was too long ago, not to mention the chaotic nature of that period. Various disasters and darkness loomed over the land then.

Nonetheless, Heaven Burial’s prestige remained today despite not being present in the lower continents. 

The sacred ground of this lineage was a mountain taken back by their progenitor. He polished it for many eras and added it to the main earth vein.

The members believed that this was the very source of the land’s power. Thus, cultivating here was immensely effective. In fact, staying here also prolonged lifespan automatically.

Most importantly, rumor has it that the heavenly scripture could still be here. Of course, Heaven Burial’s ancient ancestors denied this.

Either way, outsiders thought that the conqueror had infused the mysteries of the scripture into the land itself. This meant that the future was bright for its members; there was always a chance of a carp turning into a dragon.

Because of these beliefs, top masters from Heaven Burial always stuck around at their ancestral mountain.

“Heaven Burial.” Li Qiye stopped and scouted the area.

“Brother, sa-save me…” A faint voice echoed in his ears. [1]

In fact, no one else in the world could hear it, not even the dragon lords and conquerors. Li Qiye was the sole exception because this was his epoch.

This was because it wasn’t an audible noise - just a remnant strand of obsession on the verge of disappearing.

Too much time had passed so it only sounded once. Li Qiye closed his eyes and released all of his divine intents. After a while, he finally heard the call for help again.

He opened his eyes and turned his focus to the sacred Heaven Burial Mountain.

“Boom.” He took one step and appeared above the mountain.

Divine lights erupted to greet him. Runes twisted together to form supreme formations.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Rumble!” Halos also floated upward and supported the mountain. Next came the loud warning gongs and ringings.

“An imperial-level warning!” The ancient ancestors of Heaven Burial became alarmed.

The warning gongs could be heard in the entire system and shocked everyone. This was unprecedented for them since this level had not been used for millions of years now.
