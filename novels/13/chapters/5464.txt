Chapter 5465: Destined For Greatness

Supreme and Immortal Pagoda felt their legs shaking, not out of fear but out of injuries from the stomp earlier. Their immortal shell was nearly destroyed despite possessing the full forces of the alliances.

They exchanged glances and took a deep breath, gathering their vitality and confidence once more. They regained their proud stance but the same couldn’t be said about their allies.

Some harbored wishes to retreat because this was a suicidal mission. They had dominated their entire life and never feared anyone.

Fear was an emotion they once felt during their youth and cultivation journey. Eventually, they overcame it and reached the top of the world.

Although they weren’t as strong as Supreme and other apex cultivators, they believed that this was only temporary. As long as they could stay alive and maintain this road, they could be the last ones smiling.

Such things happened repeatedly in history - the weak eventually catching up and surpassing stronger cultivators. Thus, fear wouldn’t be the right word, only temporary apprehension.

Unfortunately, this emotion resurfaced in their heart after being stomped by Li Qiye. It crushed their confidence and dao heart.

They looked up and saw the immeasurable gap. They couldn’t see the end of the dao path while Li Qiye was already standing there. This was a hopeless fight.

Therefore, some among them wavered and wanted to escape. The solidarity had been shattered.

Not long ago, they were willing to throw their lives away for their belief and mission. Now, the absolute zero chance of success made them abandon their conviction.

This was the prelude to the collapse of the dao heart and the start of their downfall. They understood the frightening consequences of this. They attempted to strengthen their dao heart, summoning the courage to face Li Qiye.

Events flashed in their eyes in this split second, harking the early days of cultivation. When they were weak, they felt the same fear toward stronger cultivators.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In the end, they eventually defeated these powerful foes and went farther and farther. This was a similar situation and they couldn’t yield now.

The first to stabilize were naturally Supreme and Immortal Pagoda. The former remained calm and collected while the latter was still the heaven’s favorite.

Conquerors and dragon lords couldn’t afford to yield. Giving up meant weakening their dao heart - something unbecoming of their status.

“Your perseverance is commendable.” Li Qiye praised the courageous foes.

“You have helped me understand my dao heart more, Sir.” Supreme took a deep breath.

“You should be proud of your comprehension ability.” Li Qiye said.

“Well, I am certainly ready to die today for the sake of learning more about the dao heart.” Immortal Pagoda laughed and interjected.

All-things and the others had respect for their mortal foes. These two regained their composure and courage in such a short time despite facing Li Qiye.

Nonetheless, not all agreed with their readiness to die. What was the point of gaining a stronger dao heart if it meant dying in battle today?

However, Supreme and Immortal Pagoda appreciated maintaining their dao heart. If they could somehow survive, they would be able to go farther than ever before.

Plus, they had no regrets if they were to die during a battle. They didn’t let down their past self by running away like a coward. This was absolutely the correct path for cultivators.

“Yes, cultivation is an internal journey, not for the sake of fame and authority nor incredible techniques.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Born in this world and destined for greatness, it’s a shame that my mission collides with yours, Sir.” Immortal Pagoda laughed.

“Let us finish this, Sir.” Supreme said.

They have chased fear away and readied themselves for the second round.
