Chapter 4123: Illusory Princess

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Nine-wheel Citadel stood second only to Sea Emperor on this continent. In fact, for a long period of time, it was stronger than its rival and ruled over the region.

The most unmatched thing about Sea Emperor was its possession of two heavenly sword daos. How did Nine-wheel Citadel manage to overcome this in the past?

Of course, this was due to them producing waves of talents, but the primary reason was that they possessed three parts of one of the Nine Heavenly Scriptures, Six Wheels of the Myriad Realms.

They had three wheels out of the six - void, diamond, and earth. This made it easy for them to train top cultivators, culminating in four dao lords.

Its progenitor was Nine-wheel Dao Lord, a member of the sky spirit race and their very first dao lord. His talents and innate gifts were impeccable. He then eventually found part of the Heavenly Scripture, establishing an unshakable status for his sect.

These three wheels were definitely comparable to Sea Emperor’s two sword dao. Thus, they remained competitive over the years.

Though many came to greet the princess, there was a clear difference in their attitude versus Goldflow Young Noble’s entrance.

They actually liked him so they sincerely greeted him. As for the princess, they had to do so out of fear and propriety.

“What is this sword?” She came over and glanced at the daoist’s sword, getting straight to the point.

She didn’t care for this sword after having seen numerous treasures in her life, merely feeling curious after seeing her peers in this place. She thought about obtaining it in order to one-up them.

“It’s just a family heirloom.” The daoist could sense a sliver of hostility from her. He actually didn’t think the sword was that precious. It’s just he couldn’t lose it or he would go down as a sinner.

“Let me see it.” She demanded imperiously. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

This attitude wasn’t appreciated, especially not after the daoist saw Goldflow and Snowcloud. He instinctively held the sword tighter and closer to his chest.

“No need for that, it’s just a crappy sword. I won’t waste your time.” He smiled wryly.

Though he was an inexperienced traveler, he had heard of Nine-wheel Citadel and its might before.

“Old man, it is an honor to be asked by Her Highness.” A cultivator nearby said, wanting to please the princess and climb up Nine-wheel Citadel.

“No way.” The daoist didn’t like this development.

Illusory Princess didn’t like this and uttered coldly: “I only want to take a look, do you think I’ll rob you of your crappy sword? Hmph, it’s not up to you either way.”

His expression darkened after hearing this.

“Princess, don’t make it difficult for him even if you’re just joking.” Goldflow Young Noble smiled.

“He’s treating me like a robber and this sword like an ultimate treasure. As if I care about this piece of crap…” She said.

“It’s our sect’s ultimate sword…” The daoist complained, unable to endure her contemptuous speech.

“It’s still worthless.” She didn’t like him because others would have happily handed her the sword.

As for this old man, he seemed afraid of her stealing from him. She viewed this as an insult.

“How much, name the price and I’ll buy it.” She glared at him.

“It’s not for sale.” He immediately responded.

“I can afford it, don’t worry. 3,000,000 Myriad Form Refined Jades, yes or no?” She snorted.

The crowd clamored afterward. This was quite a high price because the old man probably came from an unknown sect. Even his heirloom probably wasn’t worth anything close to the offer.

In fact, they thought that he could sell his entire sect and that still wouldn’t be enough. They didn’t doubt the princess’ ability to pay this much either.

“I’m not selling.” He shook his head and spoke firmly. Though his sect and he were completely broke, he didn’t want to sell their heirloom.

“5,000,000.” She spoke again, wanting to buy it more and more after seeing his refusal. She thought that a poor cultivator like him would cave eventually.

“Daoist Peng doesn’t want to sell, let’s drop this matter, Princess.” Snowcloud chimed in, aware of Illusory Princess’ fiery temperament.

The girl’s pride and arrogance were understandable since she came from such a prestigious sect.

“That only makes me want it more. 7,000,000.” The princess scowled.

Goldflow Young Noble and Snowcloud Princess exchanged glances. Their relationship with her wasn’t strong enough to overcome her imperious and competitive nature.

“100,000,000.” A lazy voice interjected.

“100,000,000?!” The crowd looked over right away, astounded.

“Who is this, he dares to offend the princess?” Another murmured.

Everyone could see the princess’ insistence on obtaining this sword. It would be foolish to interfere right now since she was a top disciple of Nine-wheel Citadel.

“He, he’s Li Qiye, the world’s richest!” Someone shouted after seeing the bidder.

“Li Qiye? The guy with enough money to drown people to death?” Most have heard of Li Qiye at this point.

“He can smash a hole in the sky with his money. He’s the one who took down Dark Dragon Island, there are so many experts working for him right now so he can do whatever he wants. Bidding one hundred million is nothing more than a game to him.” One expert became jealous.
