Chapter 4142: Sever

Ninth’s seventh slash was incredibly powerful. Some ancestors believed that they might even die to it but Pineleaf Sword Lord successfully stopped it.

The sword lord was putting up a great fight and lived up to his reputation. In terms of sword technique, he was inferior to Ninth. However, he made this up by having ample inner force and cultivation.

“There’s still hope, just two more variations, Earthless and Skyless.” A high elder said softly.

“Right, maybe it’s possible to stop Skyless.” A different ancestor mused.

No one has been able to stop Ninth’s titular attack but they thought the sword lord had a good chance. After all, he still looked perfectly fine and composed after stopping the seventh slash.

“Clank!” Pineleaf’s sword vibrated slightly as he went on the offensive.

This wasn’t surprising since he seemed to have ample energy still. This attack severed all the existing affinities - karma, the temporal trinity, and various cycles.

“Sever, a sure-kill move from Wooden Sword Holy Devil!” An ancient ancestor shouted.

“I’ve never seen anything like this before.” The top masters of the sword dao were astounded.

“I see, the sect master is versed in two different schools.” Someone else praised since the sword lord had used techniques from both Jade Bamboo Dao Lord and Wooden Sword Holy Devil so far.

Ninth used the seventh slash again to stop this incoming attack. Both were exceptional and truly dangerous.

A devastating blast was the result, capable of destroying numerous eras. The countless slashes from Ninth crumbled right away. Pineleaf’s sword made from his main root seemed sharper than anything else in existence.

Though the slash didn’t sever Ninth’s sword, it still defeated his seventh slash.

“Yes!” Some started cheering loudly since the sword lord currently had the upper hand thanks to his counterattack.

“This attack is invincible! He got this!” One ancestor became red with excitement while clenching his fists.

The reversal stirred the crowd. “Sever” still had enough momentum to fly straight for Ninth’s head.

The user of this move needed to go all-out, concentrating everything on this slash without holding back. They couldn’t think about the consequences, only the present until blood is drawn.

The technique itself was impeccable on top of being elevated by the sword lord’s ample energy. This was the move Wooden Sword Holy Devil relied on to defeat War God Dao Lord.

“Activate!” However, Ninth showed no fear despite the slash coming for his head.

His sword became resplendent and chasms formed beneath his feet. Swords rushed out from below like an ocean of lava. They came together to form a fortress capable of both offense and defense.

“Earthless!” One spectator shouted.

This technique was rather versatile. It could kill millions or simply act as an unbreakable barrier.

Nonetheless, the formation of this technique didn’t stop the sword lord from pressing forward. He kept on severing the swords standing in his way but sure enough, his momentum was weakening.

“Sever got this!” A genius shouted: “Kill him!”

The members from Wooden Sword in the audience became ecstatic. Even the ancestors were shouting.

“The sword lord will win!” The young ones applauded. Severing seemed to be overpowering Earthless. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Not long ago, the majority considered Pineleaf to be a clear underdog. Ninth’s sword techniques were just too terrifying but Pineleaf was proving them wrong.

“The tides are reversed now.” Another young one became emotional.

Many watched closely, hoping that the slash would be able to decapitate Ninth.

“This is the end of Ninth’s era.” One expert shouted.

“Sword Lord, you got this!” Tumultuous chants echoed across the region like waves.

“Break.” Ninth didn’t try to dodge the slash and said one word.

Everyone instantly felt his vitality rushing out in an endless manner. This empowered his existing sword energies and raised them to the next level.
