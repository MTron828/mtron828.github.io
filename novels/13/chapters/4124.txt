Chapter 4125: Dirty Money

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Who says Nine-wheel Citadel won’t pay?” The youth helping the princess barked back.

“That’s perfect then, just bid five hundred million and I’ll give up the sword.” Li Qiye reached out his hand, telling them to go ahead.

“You!” The youth turned red.

“It’s just five hundred million, pay the daoist and the sword is yours.” Li Qiye continued.

The youth turned as red as a pig’s liver. He obviously couldn’t muster this monstrous sum and left himself in an embarrassing situation. Plus, even if he actually had five hundred million, he wouldn’t buy the sword with it anyway.

“I don’t want to buy it.” The princess said, unable to keep up the farce of saving face. Though she was pampered by the seniors, this amount was still outrageous. Thus, she changed the narrative.

“Oh? Your Highness, you were so imposing earlier when you demanded the sword, and here I thought you would be more than willing to pay a meager five hundred million for it.”

The princess trembled with rage but restrained herself from killing Li Qiye in order to maintain her image. She took a deep breath and said: “I’ve changed my mind. That piece of scrap metal is not worth five hundred million, I would rather buy something else that is actually worth it.”

She spewed acrimonious words towards someone’s heirloom. This was rather distasteful but Daoist Peng remained calm. He himself didn’t think the sword was worth the price.

Nonetheless, no price was enough to buy it since it has been passed down for generations. He wouldn’t be the one to lose it.

“A poor excuse from a poor person.” Li Qiye shrugged and smiled: “Those with money never care about the price, they buy as long as they like it.”

“…” The princess gritted her teeth, wanting to cut Li Qiye to pieces.

Meanwhile, spectators exchanged glances, wondering why Li Qiye was taunting her. It ended up with him becoming an enemy of the two strongest sects in Sword Continent.

“This brat is just crazy, offending everyone.” One person said. Others smiled wryly after seeing his arrogant and fearless style.

“Oh well, I gave you the chance. It won’t be for sale again.” Li Qiye smiled.

“No one would buy it anyway.” The princess snorted.

Daoist Peng heaved a sigh of relief - the storm was finally over. He shouldn’t have bragged about his sword in the first place.

“It’s not easy for all of us to meet, let’s enjoy this moment.” Goldflow laughed and tried to change the topic after seeing a pause.

He walked to Li Qiye’s front and slightly bowed: “Your reputation precedes you, Young Noble. It is a pleasure to finally meet you in person.”

“Coming over just to flatter me?” Li Qiye glanced at him.

Goldflow had an awkward expression but didn’t mind too much: “Haha, let’s say that I am, shouldn’t the richest man in the world reward me with a few coins for drinks?”

“Sure, thirty million then.” Li Qiye chuckled and rewarded him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Bam!” Refined jades fell to the ground and lit up the entire floor.

The young noble was just joking around yet Li Qiye actually rewarded him with a crazy sum.

“Thirty million…” Numerous patrons salivated.

One of them calmed down and wiped his mouth: “I’ve never seen so much money in my life before.

Goldflow himself couldn’t believe it either since he was just joking around. He became emotional despite being quite experienced. This wasn’t his first time seeing thirty million refined jades.

But in this case, they were mere strangers and this was their first conversation. This level of generosity was unprecedented.

“It would be rude of me to refuse your generosity, Young Noble.” He bowed and accepted the jades.

Other geniuses would find this rather embarrassing, more or less. After all, he was from the famous Virtuous School. Accepting a reward from Li Qiye seemed improper or even disgraceful. He didn’t seem to care and preferred the jades.

“Never seen anyone like him before, so ridiculous.” A previous-gen cultivator said sentimentally.

Others toiled for a lifetime and would never come close to this sum yet he simply gave it away.

“Young Noble, you’re the greatest…” Another came over and flattered Li Qiye, wanting the easy money.

“Stand aside.” Li Qiye impatiently waved his hand: “The first to do something is a genius, the rest are just idiots.”

Others immediately backed off right away, not wanting to make fools out of themselves. Li Qiye was amused at first but didn’t want to be bothered afterward.

“I have a question for you, Young Noble Li. I’ve been very curious about it.” Snowcloud Princess politely inquired.

“What is it?” He smiled.

“How did you open the Preeminent Legacy?” She asked. She had heard every detail about it before from numerous sources.

However, she knew that opening it wasn’t so simple.

All eyes were on Li Qiye right away since they were curious as well. That event turned him into the richest man in the world.
