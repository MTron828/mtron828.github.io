Chapter 4510: Competitive Auction

All in all, the big shots present felt frustrated and curious about the buyer’s demand. Normally, low and high-quality jades of the same level had the same monetary worth.

But now, since the demand was 1,000,000,000 perfect jades, it became a supply issue that would increase the price.

“They want to build a kiln, one better capable of controlling the quality for a long period. This would allow them to produce high-quality pills. Looks like they have gathered enough perfect-quality jades of all levels outside of sovereign.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“That’s a thing?” Wise hasn’t heard of such a magical cauldron before.

The Wu was also an alchemist clan with peerless alchemists before. However, they have never heard of using a kiln for mass production before. Just controlling one cauldron alone was difficult enough and normally for the divine pills, only one would be produced.

Li Qiye only chuckled and didn’t elaborate.

The auctioneer stared at the guests and then asked: “Any other questions, Esteemed Guests?”

No one else said anything because it was none of their business what the buyer wanted. The only thing to do was to satisfy the demand in order to obtain the bottles. The quality of the pills was not to be questioned since the auction house has guaranteed it.

“Then we shall begin, the starting price will be 1,000,000,000.” The auctioneer went on: “Because this was the final work of Fire Dragon Enlightened Being, the increment will be 100,000,000.”

The crowd clamored after hearing this. Alas, there would be no more pills like them afterward. Maybe this was still within the realm of acceptability.

“This might be better than small raises. We’ll save time too, let’s go.” An ancient cultivator urged.

Qi deviation could happen to everyone, even the mighty ancestors. Of course, the chance for them was lower. Nonetheless, it meant that they would lose everything after working for so hard. Therefore, older cultivators were actually more frightened of qi deviation.

The old cultivators in the crowd were willing to pay a premium to rid themselves of this fear.

“We shall begin.” The auctioneer said.

“1,100,000,000.” Turtle-seeker Ancestor shouted. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“1,200,000,000.” The ancient cultivator immediately responded.

“1,300,000,000.” Alchemy Child bid as well for his young emperor. There was only a tiny chance for someone so talented to suffer qi deviation. However, if the price didn’t go too high, having the ten bottles would still be wise.

“1,400,000,000.” A big shot from an ancient clan joined.

“1,500,000,000.”

“1,600,000,000.”

“1,700,000,000.”

“1,800,000,000.”

“1,900,000,000.”

“2,000,000,000.” The other participants were clearly interested in the pills.

It didn’t take long for the atmosphere to heat up and the bid became 3,000,000,000. Despite the heated nature of the auction, everyone still adhered to the minimum increment. No one wanted to escalate the situation.

Turtle-seeker, Alchemy Child, and the ancient cultivator seemed insistent on winning.

Alchemy Child wanted it for his young emperor just in case as long as he could get it for a reasonable price. The ancient cultivator seemed to have a problem with his cultivation, hence needing the pills.

Most participants dropped out once the price got up to 3,000,000,000. Although they could still afford the amount, they needed to save money for other treasures.

Turtle-seeker seemed hellbent on winning and came prepared. Alas, his expression became serious since the price was slowly getting out of reach.

“4,000,000,000.” Finally, Alchemy Child broke the mold with a strong bid.

Turtle-seeker hesitated, raising his hand halfway but eventually lowering it. This amount was beyond his current wealth. His expression darkened as he sighed, looking helpless and sad.

“4,100,000,000.” A new participant joined the show - Cloudgrasp Elder who has regained his wits.

Meanwhile, Wise worried about his old friend and asked: “You really need these ten bottles?”

“It’s the kid.” Turtle-seeker smiled bitterly: “His talent is perfect, it’s just that there was a problem during the training process.”
