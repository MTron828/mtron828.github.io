Winter Wonderland
0.00 / 0.00

The perpetual spring season here filled the place with life. Foliage, plants, willow trees; all inviting people to come.

One could open their eyes anywhere and see a variety of beauties. A man would definitely forget his way back home.

A cold and prideful lady like the winter apricot was watering a flower pot; a smiling girl was chasing after a deer; a gentle woman was picking some medicines... The climate was perfect but the population even better.

His appearance here attracted many gazes. Some bashfully smiled at him while the colder ladies only glared. A few were friendly enough to nod their head cheerfully as a greeting...

This was an assault on one’s vision. Any other man would abandon his lover in this new scenery, but Li Qiye leisurely strolled and perused the landscapes instead.

A man in Hundred-flowers was a curious matter, but not just any man, he was a chief disciple.

After this news was known, more female disciples came to take a look. The majority kept a distance with an expression of surprise and shyness on their face. After all, few male disciples could even visit this place.

The curious ones continued to steal glances while the bolder ladies pointed at him while quietly discussing with their best friends. He was a monkey in a cage, on full display for all the ladies.

Of course, he didn’t mind at all and maintained a natural expression. This nonchalant style of his attracted even more attention.

This was indeed a special case. More importantly, this chief disciple was ignoring them.

Normally, a chief disciple was a successor, the future leader of Longevity Valley and the system in the future. The problem was that Longevity Sage was still young on top of being quite powerful. It wasn’t the right time to appoint a successor. Because of this, the position of chief disciple has been left alone until now.

If it wasn’t for the letter from the sect master, everyone would certainly think that he was a fake. However, the seal couldn’t be faked, so this chief disciple was the real thing.

He looked more like a new groom visiting the bride’s family. The ladies were watching and smiling at him.

His skin was thick enough to ignore all of this while feasting with his eyes.

“What a brazen man.” One disciple didn’t approve of his blatant gaze towards the girls.

She was right. His eyes showed no restraint, whether it be the beautiful sceneries or the pretty ladies. He would stop and took his time appreciating their charm.

The girls here didn’t have the same shamelessness. No one could withstand his invasive gaze; they felt naked and began to realize something about this new male disciple while quietly muttering one word, “pervert”.

Most didn’t know his name so “pervert” became his moniker. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Nevertheless, complaints and coquettish protest were still very pleasant to the ears. Of course, one would need to be shameless enough to handle being called a pervert so many times. Li Qiye was such a guy, evident by the natural smile on his face.

The girls became increasingly vexed while his smile became increasingly brighter. The cute cries and murmurs from the girls actually livened up the place.

Because he was the only male disciple, he couldn’t stay at the same place with the rest of the female disciples. They prepared a courtyard in a remote location. He was satisfied with this arrangement.

He didn’t go outside and meditated about the grand dao instead. This place full of life was incredible for cultivation. A session would be filled with this refreshing affinity.

Someone came to visit him right away, a great beauty at that.

Shapely brows, big and round eyes spirited enough to tell a tale. They also flashed with a crafty glint just like a little fox.

Her complexion resembled the peach blossom, skin tender and white. More importantly, her bright smile was irresistible, causing others to feel close to her right away.

She wore a light-pink dress with a skirt draping down to the ground. It accentuated her beauty even more. Though her face and figure weren’t on the same level as Wu Bingning or Longevity Sage, she was still very attractive in a more approachable manner.

“This Little Sister’s name is Fan Miaozhen, nice to meet you, First Brother.” She didn’t act like a stranger and bowed to greet him, a perfect first impression.

So this was the First Sister of Hundred-flowers, a genius at alchemy.

Li Qiye assessed her carefully as if wanting to see everything.

She was much bolder compared to the other girls. She stood before him and waited until he was almost done before smiling: “No wonder why the sisters are saying that First Brother is a pervert. No girl can handle such a blatant stare.”

“But you can.” Li Qiye remained seated, nonchalant yet imposing.

“Because I’m the First Sister. If I act shy, then no one in Hundred-flowers will come and take care of you. Gotta grow some thick skin to come here.” She winked with her wavy eyes.

He chuckled: “Who knows? Maybe I have a special taste, preferring blushing girls over a bolder one that will scare me away.”

Any other girl would become quite embarrassed after hearing this comment.

“One that can scare you away must be quite bold, I’m afraid I can’t do it.” She smiled.

He continued staring at her without any reservation. It was both out-of-line yet so natural.

“I’ll be uncomfortable if you keep staring, First Brother.” She finally pouted.

“As the adage goes, like master, like disciple. Longevity Sage’s disciple is quite extraordinary.” He praised with a smile.

“No, First Brother, your comment is about the wrong person. It should be aimed at you, not me. Only a visionary like Master would pick a disciple like you. We sisters will surely need to keep our eyes wide open for the future. I myself will require your guidance later on.” She said with delight.

She finally squatted down but still managed to keep a graceful appearance.

“You’re here to test me?” He asked, amused.

“Of course not, I’m simply telling the truth.” A playful glint flashed in her eyes: “Plus, we sisters would never dare to test you, First Brother, given your great abilities.”

“Testing me indeed. Don’t bring your sisters into this, it’s just you wanting to figure me out.” He shook his head in response.
