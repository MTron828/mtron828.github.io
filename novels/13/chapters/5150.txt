Chapter 5151: Mere Pawns In The Grand Scheme Of Things

“Hmph, a dragon lord can’t marry a conqueror.” Someone didn’t respect Heavenly Sword Godmonarch.

“Right, only Windchaser Conqueror is right, they are a match made in heaven.” A supporter of Windchaser sneered.

They knew that Windchaser and Harkrain were already together before achieving success, that they were married despite not having a ceremony like mortals do.

Thus, why did Heavenly Sword Godmonarch even propose this marriage?

“Let’s be objective here, the godmonarch is a good match in terms of talent and ability.” A big shot supported Heaven Alliance.

“Please, if he was worthy, he would have picked the path of the conqueror instead.” Another said with disdain.

This caused many dragon lords to glare at him, prompting him to defend himself: “Don’t look at me like that, I’m a dragon lord too.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“It is a bit strange but the proposal has Supreme’s support.” The ancient ancestor revealed a key point.

“Supreme!” Silence took over the scene after this.

Everyone, regardless of their allegiance, took a deep breath due to this title. Supreme might just be the strongest and most terrifying cultivator in the upper two continents right now.

Yes, dragon lords were generally considered inferior to conquerors. Supreme was an obvious exception.

“Why is Supreme taking Heavenly Sword Godmonarch’s side?” An expert asked.

“It is time for recruitment and allegiance.” A dragon lord understood.

“Again, but we’ve been so free after the agreement.” A dragon lord became unhappy.

Previously, Blessed Conqueror and his allies successfully defeated Heaven and Dao Alliance, resulting in an agreement preventing them from forcing others to pick a side.

According to the agreement, cultivators had freedom, meaning a member of The Race could join Dao Alliance and vice versa.

The four alliances, Pure Land, and Lesser Firmament all agreed to follow these rules. This applied to dao lords and conquerors from the lower continents as well. It was one of Blessed Conqueror’s many achievements, granting freedom and stability.

Now, everything was changing.

“Blessed Conqueror’s rules are no longer effective.” A dragon lord worried: “Principle Conqueror is replaced by Sword Sea Dao Lord, Divine Alliance will become closer to Heaven Alliance. The Race is uniting once more.”

The implications of this marriage proposal stirred the crowd. Meanwhile, Li Qiye and Jun Landu had finished their meal. The latter told a disciple of the pavilion and left.

“Sir, shall we play one match?” Jun Landu suggested.

“And the world shall be the board?” Li Qiye smiled at him.

“No, nothing so high stake, just a pleasant game because I don’t want to lose my life yet.” Landu hurriedly refused.

“Okay, just a pleasant match then.” Li Qiye smiled.

As they were leaving, they saw a tornado ravaging the air and turning into a figure. Another conqueror aura erupted afterward.

“Windchaser Conqueror!” The ancestors shouted.

“Heavenly Sword, meet your demise!” Windchaser roared and immediately attacked the ancient ancestors from Heavenly Sword.

His power destroyed the peaks nearby while causing the victims to scream in horror.

“He’s actually attacking.” Someone said.

“They deserved it.” Another said since this was a clear provocation.

“Heaven Alliance is provoking the brat on purpose.” Jun Landu shook his head after seeing this.

“Isn’t it going in accordance with your plan?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“What plan? We’ve just been eating the last few days.” Landu acted confused.

“Right, the tea session today was just a coincidence.” Li Qiye said.

“Indeed, what a coincidence.” Landu said.

“In the case of an ambush, are you interfering?” Li Qiye asked.

“No way.” Landu waved both hands: “I can’t possibly hope to stop Heaven Alliance, it will have to be you, Sir.”

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t mind going with the flow. Of course, there was nothing Landu could do if he didn’t want to play along.

They returned to the courtyard and sat beneath the osmanthus tree, preparing to engage in a go match.

Serenity returned to the duo along with the fragrance of the tree. The events of the world weren’t relevant here.

Unfortunately, Windchaser Conqueror interrupted them: “Lord Landu, may I come in?’

Landu had heard this numerous times. Windchaser came every day and asked the same thing from outside the door during his youth.

“Come in.” Li Qiye answered because Landu was busy coming up with the next move.

Windchaser was ecstatic and ran in. He bowed to Li Qiye for giving him permission before focusing on the match.

“Gentlemen, may I come in?” Another visitor asked.

Landu ignored the person but Windchaser glanced at Li Qiye for permission.

“Come in.” Li Qiye agreed again and recognized this visitor - the middle-aged man that he saw back in Bear Mountain.

“I apologize for coming uninvited.” The middle-aged man said humbly.

Windchaser recognized him and stood up to return the gesture. The man stared at the board and became emotional.

This match was special since the momentum and flows of the world were contained within the pieces.

One move encompassed an era and trillions of existences. One had to at least be a conqueror to participate in this match.

He and Windchaser had to look away and rest for this match was too much for them to take.
