Chapter 4405: Ancient Pheasant

The three ancient demons were the strongest sovereigns in Dragon right now, putting Nine-tailed God aside.

One came from each of the three branches, forming a balance of power for eras now.

Ancient Pheasant naturally came from Phoenix Ground. Some believed that he was from the Jian and had an azure luan bloodline. Though it wasn’t at the phoenix level, it was still immensely mighty. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

These turned out to be false rumors. He was not from the Jian nor was he a descendant of the phoenix bloodline, just a simple pheasant born on a treasure peak.

However, there was an ancient bloodline sealed within him. Because of this, an old ancestor from Dragon brought him back to Phoenix Ground and taught him the dao.

This went on for several generations and the pheasant’s bloodline eventually awakened. He became intelligent and gained a human form.

He didn’t let down his natural constitution and the effort of the demon ancestors. His cultivation soared instantly and he swept through his peers. After he made his dao debut and left Dragon, he defeated numerous masters.

Eventually, his title became Ancient Pheasant - one of the three ancient demons of Dragon.

Jian Qingzhu had heard about his legends before. She thought that he would have an impressive appearance and aura. For example, her father had a divine and intimidating glow with many colors.

However, this ancestor looked like a regular rooster. There was no surging vitality and energy.

No one from Dragon would think that he was their ancient ancestor, only livestock belonging to a villager.

This was a testament to how well Ancient Pheasant hid his aura. Nonetheless, Li Qiye still spotted him.

“Come inside, everyone.” Ancient Pheasant invited the two back into the hut.

The rooster spoke while strutting forward. Jian Qingzhu who followed right behind found this rather amusing.

After they were inside the hut, Ancient Pheasant waved its wing and the hut suddenly changed position.

Once Qingzhu regained her wits, she found that they were standing on a peak with clouds, fog, and ample spirit energy just like a paradise.

“Wow, this place is…” She murmured.

“It’s my true home, the hut was only an entrance.” Ancient Pheasant said.

Without Ancient Pheasant’s guidance, Qingzhu wouldn’t have been able to find this place.

The peak was refreshing and bright. The occasional breezes made it quite pleasant and carried the aroma of the freshly brewed tea prepared by Ancient Pheasant.

Qingzhu hurriedly poured the tea for both Li Qiye and the ancestor. This was her duty as a junior.

“The tea might not be up to par, but please still give it a taste, Sir.” Ancient Pheasant invited.

Li Qiye didn’t show any reservation and took a sip. He then nodded approvingly.

The two of them enjoyed the tea for a bit before Qingzhu spoke: “Ancestor, my father is imprisoned…”

“I’m aware.” The demon waved his sleeve and said: “He only lost his freedom and isn’t in any danger.”

“You knew?” Qingzhu was surprised at first but then again, Ancient Pheasant was still staying in the sect. He had enough power to know everything that was going on in Dragon.

“Ancestor, do you mean that we can’t save him right now? He is absolutely loyal to the sect and has contributed greatly for years now.” She wasn’t exaggerating his accomplishments. Phoenix Ground has prospered under his reign without facing any danger.

“It’s not a big deal to release him.” Ancient Pheasant said: “Sir, what do you think about this?”

“This is your sect’s problem, I’m not interested in offering advice.” Li Qiye smiled and took another sip of tea.

“Ancestor, you’ve figured everything out already?” She asked.

“Don’t flatter me, little one. I know you’re smart already.” The demon smiled wryly.

“What should we do to solve the current conflict then?” Qingzhu bowed.

The imprisonment of Goldbird Monarch has created a rift between Phoenix Ground and Dragon. It appeared that Dragon was challenging its sovereignty and this could escalate at any moment.

In order to prevent needless bloodshed, Goldbird Monarch willingly put himself under house arrest, hoping to quell any potential issue for now.

“Goldbird is wise, it’s just that Peacock has been too famous and ambitious recently. He’s reckless and arrogant, not knowing that there is always a higher mountain.” Ancient Pheasant said.

“Only wisdom can maintain peace.” Li Qiye interjected.

“You’re right, Sir, it’s just that Goldbird can’t influence Peacock, sigh…” The demon smiled wryly.

Qingzhu could tell that Ancient Pheasant held her father in high regard, maybe going as far as supporting him to be their sect master.

It’s just that he wasn’t as strong as Peacock. His talent exceeded the other three demon monarchs.

He had power, talent, and even contributions to the sect. If Goldbird had been chosen as the sect master, Peacock and many other disciples wouldn’t accept it.

Moreover, Dragon Platform certainly had supported him in the past.

“Everything about Peacock is excellent, with the exception of pride and arrogance.” The demon said: “The sect has high hopes for him since he is the most likely among the young generation to break myriad dao.”

“Myriad Sovereign?” Qingzhu asked.

“Yes. I don’t think Goldbird has a chance.” The demon responded.

Myriad was the level above Golden. Ten dao were originally perfect, hence the name “golden”. The difference between these two levels was immense - the difference between ten and ten thousand.

Most sovereigns could never reach this level despite trying for a lifetime.
