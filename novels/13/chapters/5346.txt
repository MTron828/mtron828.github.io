Chapter 5347: Kill Everyone Here!

“How about killing everyone here?” Illumination spoke with a mysterious smile.

This immediately surprised everyone since they heard him clearly.

“That’s a bold statement to make.” Swordsea stared at him intensely. Someone of his status wouldn’t bluster to this level.

The old servant and the others also paid careful attention to Illumination, preparing for the worst.

How could Illumination alone kill everyone here? Spectators thought that it was impossible given the field - Supreme and Swordsea were just as strong.

Moreover, Heaven Alliance had more conquerors and dao lords present as well on top of Immortal Emperor Xu Kong.

“Illumination, I hope you have an army behind you or some monstrous ace cards in order to kill all of us.” Timewatcher was curious like the rest.

No one thought that Illumination would be able to defeat all of them. If he were in possession of such power, he wouldn’t have been chased out of Dao Alliance previously.

“Just me alone.” Illumination gazed at the group.

“Make your move then!” Hallowed Dao Lord channeled his power and sword dao. He wanted to kill Illumination and pave the road for solidarity.

Despite knowing the odds, no one dared to take Illumination lightly. They all channeled their defensive barriers while thinking of attacking him without holding back.

“I apologize for what comes next.” Illumination’s eyes flashed brightly as he summoned a badge and shouted: “Heed my wish, destroy everything here!”

The enigmatic and ancient rune of the word “command” on the order became resplendent.

“A Dream Immortal Order!” Everyone’s expression soured.

Spectators from a distance started running. However, some shook their head and said: “Running is useless, this is Duality World.”

“Buzz.” After making his wish, the badge turned into the shape of an eye.

Light gathered into that single point and the eye collapsed from his grasp. Darkness descended as if there was a gigantic palm looming above everyone.

“It’s activated, shit!” A big shot shouted in horror.

“The bastard’s really trying to kill us too!” Another cursed.

The particular badge came from Dream Paradise. Rumor has it that there were only five badges in existence.

The owner of the badge could make a wish in Dream Paradise and it would come true - whether it be obtaining a supreme merit law or anything else within its territorial constraint. Not even an apex conqueror could resist its power.

According to the legend, the renowned Calamity Dao Lord was trapped inside Dream Paradise despite having the ultimate defense. His fate remained unknown.

Since Duality World stretched across all three realms, it was considered inside Dream Paradise.

“Boom!” A flood of invisible power stopped everyone from leaving.

Even the fastest cultivator capable of leaping through dimensions couldn’t be able to escape. Dream Paradise had fully closed this area.

There seemed to be immortals from above. Everything beneath felt insignificant in comparison; resistance was futile even for apex cultivators.

“Is this it?!” The big shots bellowed in astonishment.

Timewatcher and the others channeled their power and grand dao.

Hallowed unleashed a sacred slash capable of illuminating the world. Timewatched summoned a wheel of time and tried to hide himself in the reincarnation cycle. Immortal Emperor Xu Kong summoned all twelve wills. They spread behind him like a peacock’s tail.

Alas, this couldn’t contend against the power of Dream Paradise.

“Illumination, you can’t do this!” The neutral crowd members from The People roared furiously.

“Heed my wish, nullify the previous command!” During this perilous moment, Supreme shouted and took out another dream order.
