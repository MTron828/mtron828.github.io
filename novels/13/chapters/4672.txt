Chapter 4673: Fiercest

The battle ended with one prodigy dead, the other seriously wounded. Of course, the process was far more shocking than the result - Li Qiye simply appeared unbeatable while dealing with these two, not resorting to any external forces. The victory happened in just a few seconds.

In fact, if it wasn’t for Paramount Scion’s interference, Sima Hanshan would have been killed as well.

Glances of confusion were thrown around.

“Unbeatable.” This character popped up in everyone’s mind since it was the perfect fit.

“This is so illogical, it shouldn’t have been possible.” An expert thought that those two were capable of fighting an ancient ancestor while working together.

“He’s True Immortal’s genius killer, two dead and one wounded” A youth admitted Li Qiye’s power, albeit begrudgingly.

“What the hell is his goal? This feud won’t ever be resolved.” Someone commented.

“What if Li Qiye kills True Immortal Young Emperor too? That would spell the end of their young generation, they will have to give up the competition.” One clan disciple said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Shut up!” A senior slapped the back of his head and glared at him.

Although everyone thought that a fight was rather likely and that the emperor would be a huge underdog, True Immortal was still the leading sect right now. Looking down on them wasn’t wise.

“I think it’ll be the Six Conquerors of Sky Border from now on.” A big shot stared at Li Qiye.

“No, keep the five conquerors, add a Young Fiend of Sky Border.” Someone else gave Li Qiye a title.

“Sure, Li Qiye is extremely devilish but it doesn’t quite fit.” An ancestor disagreed.

“Then what’s a good title?” Another gossipy soul asked.

“Son of Miracles?” Someone brought this up.

“Don’t like the sound of that.” Others disagreed.

“Greatest Noble.” Another knew that Li Qiye liked to be addressed as “Young Noble”.

“Too elegant for him.” A last-gen cultivator said.

“Greatest Monster?” Someone else jumped in.

“He’s not quite a murderous villain.” An expert said.

“What about Fierce?” One more came up with something new.

“Fierce? That sounds good but let’s make it Fiercest instead?” A crowd member immediately liked the title.

“Fiercest…” Others didn’t object and also agreed with this title.

However, an ancestor from an old era heard this title. Something flashed in his mind and a forgotten legend was remembered once more.

This legend was no longer circulating in Eight Desolaces. Stories regarding it became unclear and the details were lost with time. Nonetheless, he remembered that the title “Fiercest” was around then as well. He felt a chill coursing down his spine as a result.

Li Qiye smiled at the escaping duo and didn’t stop them. He began climbing the mountain instead with the daoist and Jian Ming right behind him.

No one from True Immortal could stop their path while spectators became more invested in this event.

“The main fighting force from the alliance, especially the ancient ancestors, are preoccupied with stopping the dynasty. This backline depends entirely on the young generation so if Li Qiye can get through, wouldn’t he get the gemstone from the emperor?” An elder speculated.

The ancient ancestors were busy fighting with the masters of Divine Fist Dynasty. There was no way they could get back in a short time.

“This is our chance too.” Members of the great powers became eager since a path was being created in front of them.

“Prepare and wait patiently, we will make our move with lightning speed when the time is right.” An ancestor secretly passed down this order.

When Li Qiye made it to the ridge, someone finally had the courage to block his path. This newcomer possessed an ancient and regal aura.

Though he showed no sign of contempt or arrogance, he was born to be a leader. Others would view him as a king and over his orders due to his bloodline. Even the beasts and birds felt the same way.

“Five-sun King.” Many shouted his title. Those from the east had nothing but respect for him. Numerous female cultivators were his fans as well.

Though he wasn’t as handsome as Shen Juntian or as noble as True Immortal Young Emperor, he resembled the rightful king of the mortal realm - a natural-born leader.

“We meet again, Dao Brother.” Five-sun King stood there, brimming with innate divinity despite not activating his aura.

“Standing in my way?” Li Qiye smiled.
