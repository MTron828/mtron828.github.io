Chapter 5506: The Tides Rise And Fall

Qin Baifeng stopped trying and let out a sigh. If this tablet could be solved, it would have been done long ago.

Her senior sister was right - this was only a last-minute attempt with no chance of success.

“Your talent is exceptional but your mindset is lacking compared to your senior sister.” Li Qiye glanced at her and said.

“Could you elaborate, Young Noble?” She became slightly emotional after hearing the casual remark.

Her talent left no room for doubt. After all, she gained the ancestors’ approval despite being a recruit from the outside world - a contrast to Sunset Glow Goddess who was born here.

“It’s an innate thing, your senior sister is more suited to lead the valley, a natural fit.” Li Qiye said.

His comment might have angered anyone else since it was rather rude, especially when it was directed at a six-fruit dragon lord. He praised her rival while putting her down.

They might think that he was purposely insulting her after being chosen by Sunset Glow Goddess as her consort.

In this case, Qin Baifeng didn’t think that this was personal.

“What makes you say this, Young Noble?” She asked calmly.

“You came from an impure world, so you have impure world views. Your senior sister was born and raised here, her bright heart is one with it.” He said.

“Your logic is sound.” She humbly nodded and said: “I am indeed an outsider. Although I won’t actively plan for the clan, it will benefit if I were to become the valley lord.”

“Heaven Searching had four monarchs in the past. Why does it need to rely on Sunset Glow?” He asked.

“The truth is that our clan is barely hanging on now.” She sighed and admitted with a sad expression. It was impressive that she would admit this to an outsider.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Alas, this was simply the truth. Heaven Searching was reduced to ashes after Immemorial Epoch War. Their clan was the sole remaining branch.

In order to honor the past, they kept “heaven searching” as part of the clan’s motto.

“The tides rise and fall, no one can escape.” He said.

“Young Noble, where are you from, and why did you visit our valley?” She became curious about him.

She didn’t think that he was allowed inside by the senior sister.

“I’m just passing by, that’s all.” He smiled.

“It’s not that easy to enter our sect.” She was skeptical.

In the past, Cloudsweep Fairy didn’t wish the sect to be involved in worldly struggles that might end disastrously. Thus, she used a special technique to protect the valley; it could have been concocted by the immortal artifact.

From then on, no one could enter without permission or invitation - not even powerful emperors and monarchs. Was this man strong enough to infiltrate their valley undetected?

“I was invited.” He said with a smile.

“Invited?” Baifeng was surprised because she and her senior sister were in charge of the sect’s administration. However, they didn’t invite him.

“The matron invited you?” She asked since this was another possibility.

“No, a white cloud did.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Really?” Though this sounded unbelievable, intuition told her that he wasn’t lying.

“A white cloud…” She murmured.

“Sigh, the two of you cannot grasp that artifact.” He suddenly said.

“What makes you so sure of that, Young Noble?” She became curious.

“Because you two can’t even understand one tablet from Immortal Dao. The artifact will not acknowledge you, let alone be controlled by you.” He said.

“You can understand the tablet?” She took a deep breath.

“Not difficult at all compared to controlling the artifact. It is hopeless for you two.” He said.

She wasn’t offended because no one else in the sect had been able to do so. Rumor has it that the artifact was deeply connected with Immortal Dao City. Perhaps one would be able to see some of the heavenly treasure’s secrets with it.

She then understood why her senior sister talked about picking him to be her consort. This ordinary man could read the tablet - something rather pivotal to the sect.

“Do you think you can control the artifact, Young Noble?” She asked again.

He only smiled and didn’t respond.

“Are you willing to stay here?” She couldn’t help but ask.

“Don’t tell me you want a consort too.” He teased.

“... The winner can decide that…” She turned red despite being a six-fruit dragon lord, not daring to look straight at him.

“Not interested.” He shook his head.

“Well, if you stay, Young Noble, we will honor you as an esteemed guest.” She regained her composure and said.

“I’m afraid this tiny Sunset Glow Valley can’t persuade me to stay.” He couldn’t help but smile.
