Chapter 4675: Mystic True Fate

“Show me what you have attained in the dao.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“So be it, Dao Brother.” Five-sun King raised the bowl with a serious expression.

“Boom!” Twelve palaces appeared and rotated continuously. Within their rotation was boundless chaos true energy. The true fate within was also different from everyone else’s.

Dao runes appeared along with the true fate. Each had a mystical power, seemingly blessed by the heavenly dao. They carried a mysterious and ancient presence, allowing them to boost the true fate.

It made it easier for the true fate to perform various grand dao, utilizing them to their maximum potential.

Everyone could see that under the derivation of his true fate, merit laws and grand dao should come easy to him regardless of their difficulty.

“So this is a mystic true fate.” One expert said.

“The dao is so easy with one, training less yet gaining more.” Someone became jealous and salivated.

The majority of cultivators didn’t even have an inborn true fate. They needed to create one through cultivation.

Those with an inborn one were lucky since they could cultivate any merit law at whichever cultivation realm. This included dao lord ones.

A mystic true fate allowed them to learn even the most profound merit law via meditation. Moreover, the result would be far stronger since they could derive the dao of the law to the limit.

As for a primal true fate? They were extremely rare. Just a mystic true fate belonging to Five-sun King was already the subject of envy; it destined him for greatness.

“It’s about to begin. The power of a mystic true fate is wonderful. Every technique will be immensely destructive.” An expert became anxious and backed further away to a safe distance.

“He’s using the bowl and his mystic true fate, he knows the enemy is capable.” Someone from the east said.

By tis point, he didn’t need to go all-out against ancestors, let alone his peers. However, he was facing none other than Li Qiye. Being careless and underestimating the enemy was foolish.

“Boom!” Suddenly, all of Worldbreaker shook violently.

“What the hell?” At first, they assumed that Five-sun King used a mighty technique but this turned out to not be the case.

Worldbreaker itself was shaking for some unknown reasons. The land was on the verge of splitting apart.

War horns sounded next from the dynasty. The king gave the order to retreat and the legion receded like the tides.

“What is happening?” Not to mention spectators, even the ancient ancestors of the alliance didn’t understand.

They didn’t have the upper hand but their enemies decided to withdraw. This took everyone by surprise.

“The dynasty was winning, right? Maybe they didn’t want a drawn-out conflict?” A cultivator murmured.

“It’s not that.” An expert shook her head.

“Rumble!” The quaking at Worldbreaker intensified to the point where cultivators couldn’t stand straight, falling up and down.

“Damn, this is serious.” An expert gasped.

“We need to leave right now!” An ancestor ordered his fellow members.

Five-sun King also felt the same way and stopped worrying about the battle with Li Qiye.

Outside of the regular detonations, fist intents also got out of control like a horde of stallions galloping uncontrollably. They seeped out from every inch of the land.

Of course, this was the case before but the scale was completely different. Worldbreaker turned into a raging ocean of fist intents.

“We need to capture the emperor and seize the gemstone right now, there’s something off about Worldbreaker!” An ancient ancestor from True Immortal ordered.

“Boom!” The ocean gathered into a central point and turned into a gigantic maelstrom. Loud explosions were deafening. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This maelstrom had enough destructive potential to destroy everything. All cultivators trembled nervously regardless of their power.
