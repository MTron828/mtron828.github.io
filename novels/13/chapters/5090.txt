Chapter 5091: Starting Over

“Sigh, I can’t argue against that.” The man lowered his head and smiled wryly.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, this pessimism only lasted for a second before he asked: “Big Bro, you’re here to destroy Celestial Court, right? Don’t do it so fast, wait for me first.”

“If I want to destroy them, I still have to wait for you to get your revenge first?” Li Qiye laughed.

“I guess it’s unreasonable.” The man chuckled before coming up with a good idea: “Okay, just leave that brat Heaven Burial to me. Once I rise again, I’ll teach the brat a lesson for his transgression.”

“I’ve never paid attention to this minor stuff. When people antagonize me, I just destroy them without thinking twice.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s true…” The man didn’t know what to do because he couldn’t avenge himself in such a short time.

Just returning to his prime required more time and the perfect circumstances, let alone taking down Heaven Burial Conqueror and Celestial Court. They might not even be around if he were to wait that long.

“Wait, I must be stupid. Why do I need to look for something else, my Big Bro is unbeatable in all eras. Big Bro, just teach me again and make me reach the truth of the dao. I’ll rampage Celestial Court afterward.” He acted pitifully afterward: “Big Bro, please.”

“Pop!” Li Qiye smacked the crystal side of his head and said: “You can only rely on yourself to find the truth, no one can do it that quickly. If you actually want to become strong, you need to work hard first.”

“I know…” The man sighed: “Looks like I won’t have my vengeance, they’ll be dead before then.”

“Forget about revenge, just create a strong base this time around. Your heart needs to seek the dao in order for you to reach the desired level, there is no shortcut.” Li Qiye said.

“I know you’re right, it’s just that I can’t forgive them for what they did to me.” The man said.

“Just focus on cultivation or you’ll be mediocre forever, not living up to your potential.” Li Qiye disagreed.

“I will, and I know that meeting you again is a great fortune. After all, I’m destined for greatness, the second conqueror of the six continents, the best in the past and the best in the future. My light will blind the world later.” He became excited.

“Are you listening to yourself?” Li Qiye chuckled, the kid was still the same despite becoming a conqueror.

“It’s true, Big Bro. I became invincible so fast that I felt something was off, why was it so easy? Then I thought about it again and it’s because of you. This is your dao so because of our relationship, I just needed to put in a little effort and became a conqueror right away.” He said.

“A bit shameless but I do admit that it was impressive to jump out of the previous limitations.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement.

“I didn’t let you down, did I?” He gloated.

“You ruined my reputation by being trapped here for eras while being used as a ginseng.” Li Qiye said.

“Uhh, that’s a different issue.” The man turned red and said: “Hmph, I would have crushed the brat if it was a one-on-one fight, but the old geezers ambushed me while I was being too careless.”

“The process doesn’t matter, only the result.” Li Qiye retorted.

“Now I’m just embarrassed…” The man said awkwardly: “However, Big Bro, the old geezers’ wings are tough now. They suddenly broke the balance and started the war.”

He paused for a bit before continuing: “Celestial Court must be backed by some devious entities. It’s just that we never got to see them.”

“It is to be expected.” Li Qiye said: “They became impatient after losing the epoch. Of course, they are still holding back, that’s why they are using Celestial Court as their pawn.”

“Are you going all out again, Big Bro?” The man asked.

“No rush just like one can’t eat hot tofu right away.” Li Qiye said while stroking his chin: “There are uncertainties requiring confirmation. Once that’s done, I’ll sweep away the troublemakers.”

“There should be no problem with your involvement.” The man expressed unwavering confidence in Li Qiye: “It’s a pity that I can’t fight alongside you, I’m just a piece of trash now without training.”

If others had encountered such setbacks, they would have been overwhelmed with hatred and fear toward everything. However, this man was still laughing and completely undeterred, showing remarkable mental fortitude.

“Yes, train so that you can be worthy of your martial dao.” Li Qiye said.

“For sure, I can’t ruin your reputation. After all, this was all bestowed to me by you, if I don’t work hard, what kind of man will I be?” The man nodded.

“Good, learn to stop talking so much though.” Li Qiye smacked his crystal head again.

“I wonder when I can go out to see my sister.” He laughed and said.

“If she’s still alive, you don’t need to worry about her. If she’s no longer around, then you need to become stronger, that’s how you should grieve and honor her.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes.” He sighed in response: “It has been a long time since I’ve been scolded by her, I wonder if I can see her again.”

The man had accomplished great deeds. Alas, he wasn’t that famous during his own era since he was overshadowed by his older sister - an Immortal Monarch.

Those from that era believed that he was protected by his ancestors and sister. Moreover, his own personality and conducts were questionable. In their opinion, he would have accomplished nothing if it wasn’t for his strong background.

In fact, some were rather vocal about it back then but he didn’t give a damn. This didn’t affect his relationship with his sister either.

It wasn’t until the new epoch that he changed his ways and decided to try harder. He obtained a great fortune and became a supreme conqueror.

Unfortunately, his opponents were not messing around, hence his lamentable fate. If it wasn’t for Li Qiye finding him, his end would have been rather tragic.

“You need not worry, you will see her again if it’s meant to be.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand and will keep your guidance in mind as I enter isolated training. If you see my big sis, tell her that I am doing well.” He nodded.

“I will.” Li Qiye agreed.

He decided to focus on reaching the apex again, putting aside his desire for vengeance and longing to see his loved ones. He knew that if he wasn’t strong enough, he wouldn’t be able to survive for long in this ruthless world.

Li Qiye could see his determination and decided to banish him into another dimension. He could only come back after becoming strong enough.
