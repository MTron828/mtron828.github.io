Chapter 4700: Smashed Mercilessly

The disruption of reality fabrics acted as a black hole sucking everything in. Those that got caught were instantly twisted into pieces.

“How is Tian Feng right now?” Someone asked.

People activated their heavenly gaze to observe the maelstrom. Alas, Tian Feng was no longer there.

No one could have imagined this development - a rotation fast enough to create this maelstrom. It broke everyone’s common sense.

It was one thing for him to use a powerful merit law or a peerless treasure, using the mysterious dao to create this maelstrom. However, he simply spun his enemy and started this terrifying phenomenon.

“What kind of move is this?” A spectator asked. Alas, not even ancestors can explain this to their juniors.

Shen Juntian shook his head and said: “There is no dao profundity to this, only physical power and extreme speed. As long as you possess this ability, you can start this maelstrom by just waving a wooden stick.”

“So his physical prowess is that frightening?” Godwhip Princess became alarmed.

She was not an inexperienced junior. In fact, she had met top masters before but the maelstrom horrified her.

“He’s monstrous, I’ve never seen such a terrifying foe before.” Shen Juntian said earnestly.

“I still believe in your victory, Senior Brother.” She believed that no one was more qualified than him to become the next dao lord, not even Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” The spatial dimension suddenly stabilized a bit since Li Qiye stopped the rotation.

“Bam!” Tian Feng appeared once more and Li Qiye smashed him to the ground repeatedly.

Mountains went down and layers of earth were excavated. More cracks appeared that eventually turned into massive chasms. They were then flattened again by the next smash.

Destruction and flattening, flattening and destruction; this process kept on continuing until a colossal basin was formed around Li Qiye. It looked like the mouth of the world.

Not long ago, this place had towering peaks, surging rivers, and shimmering lakes… All of this disappeared with Li Qiye’s brutality. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When standing from above, it looked as if another planet had just smashed Eight Desolaces. Once Li Qiye got enough exercise, he tossed Tian Feng away.

The guy reverted back to his original form, bloodied from top to bottom. He lay still on the ground, unable to move an inch. It appeared that all of his bones were broken, causing him to groan in agony.

Jaws dropped to the ground as a result. The lords and ancestors became frozen, unable to form a single coherent thought.

Tian Feng was a supreme genius, strong enough to fight any ancient ancestor. He was also an heir, meaning that he was qualified to become a dao lord.

He might also be the most notorious among the five conquerors, having fought numerous battles since his dao debut. Now, he was at his last gasp because of Li Qiye.

“This doesn’t make any sense. He didn’t even need to use a weapon.” A spectator couldn’t believe her own eyes.

No one would believe Tian Feng losing to an unarmed combatant, thinking that it might be a bad joke.

Alas, Li Qiye actually did it without using any merit law or technique, only brute force.

“A mad frog’s innate gift is actually beaten today.” A big shot murmured.

The entire world knew about the physical gift of the mad frogs. Powerful treasures might not be able to break their physique. At best, they would only leave skin-deep wounds. Since Tian Feng was barely alive right now, Li Qiye had clearly beaten the innate gift.

“Could it be so simple?” The ancestors wondered.

They only saw Li Qiye lifting and spinning Tian Feng before smashing him repeatedly like a rag doll.
