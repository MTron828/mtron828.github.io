Chapter 4874: Hexajewel Loop

“No one is going to stop me from killing him!” A’zhui shouted. She was no coward and wanted to protect her father’s legacy with her life.

“How are you going to do it?” Li Qiye smiled.

Northern Monarch and the dragon god frowned after seeing this. They sympathized with A’zhui since she had just lost her father. It would be stranger if she didn’t react so strongly. Alas, they didn’t know how to stop Li Qiye since he was the current ruler.

“I will do it myself if you dare to touch my father’s palace!” Her eyes brimmed with rage as if she wanted nothing more than to tear Li Qiye apart.

“And if you can’t kill me?” Li Qiye smiled.

“You, you’re just a nobody, killing you is not difficult at all. Come, I’ll show you!” The livid girl shouted.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Despite her young age, she had met plenty of cultivators before and could see Li Qiye’s subpar cultivation.

“Alright.” Li Qiye waved provocatively and said: “Since you don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth, I will show you but of course, I will be merciful out of consideration for your father.”

“Utter rubbish!” The contempt drove her madder and performed a dragon-claw technique on him. Her hand soared through the air and aimed for his chest, wanting to dig out his heart.

“Bam!” Unfortunately, Li Qiye somehow sent her flying down to the ground and caused her to see stars.

She had no idea what happened and ached all over.

The other three experts were startled because Li Qiye only performed a simple shoulder push. Her cultivation was rather decent despite her age.

She had been trained by Eight-stallion Dao Lord so both her defense and awareness were exceptional and in tune with each other. It was absurd for her to topple over due to a slight push.

“So impetuous and temperamental, you will ruin your father’s reputation in due time.” Li Qiye glanced at her.

“You!” She nearly vomited blood from anger while still seeing stars.

“Stand up, show me what you have learned from your father.” Li Qiye waved again.

She was going crazy - this was her first time experiencing this level of humiliation.

“I will kill you!” She got up and shouted.

“Maintain your composure!” Northern Monarch shouted: “There is order to the dao.” 

Her advice rang in A’zhui’s head like the morning bell and woke her up from her rage.

Anger took over earlier but she managed to regain her wits.

“Very well, I’ll show you.” Her eyes flashed with chilling murderous intent - something not often seen in a youth at her age.

The daughter of a dao lord was still exceptional and possessed a strong aura.

“I’m waiting.” Li Qiye smiled leisurely, not bothering to pose.

“Clank!” A’zhui raised her left hand. 

“Boom!” A beam shot into the air from a bracelet made of tiny dao strands. The power of a dao lord erupted and rendered others breathless.

There were six little bells on the bracelet but upon closer inspection, they turned out to be six dao fruits.

Of course, they weren’t real dao fruits but mere duplications created by Eight-stallion Dao Lord. This was a weapon left for his daughter - Hexajewel Loop.

A girl her age shouldn’t be able to control a dao lord weapon. However, he had trained her well enough so that she could use it relatively efficiently.

“My father’s unbeatable weapon. Ready your weapon and prepare to die.” She calmly said, no longer possessing the unrestrained fury and looking more like a noble princess.

“No need, just this finger is enough to bully a little girl like you. You should feel honored that I’m taking the time to teach you a lesson.” Li Qiye taunted.

Northern Monarch and the dragon god exchanged glances, having no intention of stopping the fight since they wanted to see Li Qiye’s ability. If this were to escalate out of control, they would take action then.

“Take this then!” A’zhui’s calmness was disturbed again.

She took one step forward and released the power of eight stallions. Her fate palaces opened and released billowing vitality. The halos of a dao lord manifested into reality. EIght-stallion clearly spoiled her, leaving behind numerous seals for protection.

“Bam!” The energy stallions struck Li Qiye but he didn’t move an inch. Even his sleeves didn’t flutter.

“Seems like you forgot to eat, no power at all.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Die!” She roared and used her bracelet, blessing her with her father’s wind affinity.

She appeared in front of him and performed another claw attack at his face. This time, it was empowered by the wind and became immensely sharp. 

Alas, it only struck air because he became illusory. In the next second, he showed up behind her and smiled: “Too slow.”

“Go!” She roared and the power of her father erupted without holding back. Waves of energy struck him directly - one stronger than the previous. Furthermore, they stacked up continuously and could destroy a mountain range.

“Boom!” She finally sent him flying into the air, looking like a fallen leaf.
