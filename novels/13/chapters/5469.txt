Chapter 5470: Sir, Can You Stop The Force Of An Epoch?

Holding the sword in his grasp was akin to holding an entire epoch. The world trembled before its emergence, let alone its inhabitants.

Apex cultivators couldn’t hold the sword but Supreme was able to do so due to his current empowered state. The mysterious momentum seemingly possessed endless power. Perhaps it was blessed by a supreme existence previously.

Everyone gasped at this sight. All-things and his peers understood that their current selves wouldn’t be able to control this sword.

If they were to forcefully hold this sword, their body would instantly crumble despite possessing an immortal shell.

“The rumor is true, Celestial Court does have this sword, a paragon artifact from an old epoch.” An emperor from Heaven Alliance murmured.

“I can’t believe it, they left a paragon artifact down here?” A monarch didn’t understand the reason why.

Some of the top cultivators have heard rumors of Celestial Court possessing a paragon artifact. However, no one could actually wield it, hence its disappearance in history.

In theory, it should be well-guarded in Celestial Court. Just how much trust did Celestial Court have in Supreme?

“It’s to kill an overlord.” An ancient emperor speculated.

“Wait, the existence of this sword is a sin, that’s why it couldn’t be left behind in Celestial Court or it would have been taken away.” A conqueror heard something like this before.

“Not necessarily, maybe Supreme is granted the sword for a battle, he’ll have to return it later.” Another came up with a different theory.

Regardless of the actual answer, this showed just how much trust Celestial Court had in Supreme. Heaven Burial Conqueror and the lords during Time Immemorial might not had this privilege.

After all, a paragon artifact was an actual threat to Celestial Court. Its power could cut through the barriers and formations.

Sword Emperor who had toiled for Celestial Court for eras didn’t have access to it either. Perhaps only Light-dragon Conqueror was equal to Supreme in this regard.

Now, everyone understood the reason for the supreme momentum hidden in the upper continents. It was so that someone could obtain this incredible shell for the sake of controlling the paragon sword.

The user would be able to easily dominate the upper continents, hence Celestial Court’s careful selection of Supreme.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If Supreme harbored any intention of betraying them, they would lose control over the upper continents since anyone sent down would be swiftly killed. This was similar to what Eternal Conqueror did in the lower continents.

“What do you two think? Can you wield the sword?” Swordsea asked Darkfrost and Sword Queen.

Sword Queen didn’t respond while Darkfrost put on a serious expression before replying: “If I muster all of my strength, maybe I can swing it twice, but most likely once.”

“Same for me, holding it alone will destroy my body.” Swordsea agreed after assessing the power within the skeletal sword.

“Sir, please give me pointers.” Supreme looked invincible at this moment since he could defeat all the apex cultivators together.

Li Qiye seemed amused to see the sword and said: “True Bones, finally showing up again. Looks like your Celestial Court has a capable ally, to be able to come up with this wielding method. They didn’t forge it and must have needed to use a borrowed shell in the past.”

“Incredible insight, so you are familiar with it, Sir.” Supreme praised.

“True Bones?” Everyone repeated the name of this paragon artifact.

It was forged by a monstrous overlord after sacrificing their epoch - a truly dreadful tale. Celestial Court eventually found it but no one there could actually use it.

Their ultimate masters couldn’t show their faces to the world. Thus, they had to take over a mighty cultivator’s body to wield the sword temporarily. Of course, this had serious consequences for the unlucky cultivator chosen to be taken over.

Because of this, they rarely used it in history until an unknown guest came along. This person had vast knowledge of True Bones and came up with the current method to wield it.

“Do you think that this is enough to kill me?” Li Qiye smiled.

Sir, can you stop an attack with the force of an epoch?” Supreme asked with a serious expression.

The crowd wondered as well. No apex cultivator would be able to survive a swing from this sword, but what about Li Qiye? He might be the only one capable of this feat.
