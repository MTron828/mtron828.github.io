Chapter 4710: Numerous Enemies

Their formation made it clear that they weren’t here to fight fair.

“Didn’t I beat you already?” Li Qiye smirked at Wild Paragon.

The latter’s expression became awkward instantly. He was livid since Li Qiye reminded everyone of his defeat again. Alas, it was indeed the truth. His third head has recovered but no one could erase his defeat from history.

The only way to change this was to defeat Li Qiye. Otherwise, there was no way for him to retort.

“You have the immortal gemstone.” He changed the subjected and uttered coldly.

“That’s right, want to try and rob me?” Li Qiye seemed calm despite being surrounded.

Spectators became immersed in this development. This force was enough to sweep through a great power, but what about Li Qiye?

“Fellow Daoist, hand over the immortal gemstone and everything shall be fine.” Featherhat waved his fan and suggested.

“And if I refuse?” Li Qiye lazily stretched.

“Death!” Sacredscroll shouted. The word “death” manifested into a physical form and struck the ground, causing it to shake violently. Death energy appeared and made him look like a god of death.

“I’m afraid a bunch of dogs won’t be able to take me down.” Li Qiye stared at them with disdain, not giving a damn about their prestige and domineering aura.

This was the style of a future dao lord - a being strong enough to look down on everyone.

Nonetheless, his opponents didn’t appreciate the contempt that was no different from a slap to the face. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“You’re not leaving this place alive!” One sovereign shouted.

“Clank!” Sword Dao Paragon activated his sword dao, releasing destructive rays and flashes.

Spectators shuddered after seeing them. Fortunately, they stood at a safe distance now.

“Some call him Sword Immortal.” An eastern cultivator said.

Sword Dao Paragon was rather capable. Of course, calling him an “immortal” was an exaggeration. Nonetheless, his sword dao had slain numerous masters before.

“Fellow Daoist, avoid making this mistake. The gemstone is just a source of trouble. Don’t ruin your future over it.” His words had a metallic ringing to them.

Others agreed because the gemstone incited uncontrollable greed. Li Qiye would always be everyone’s target. This would keep him preoccupied and robbed him of cultivation time.

“Mere insects can’t ruin anything. Be smart and run while I’m feeling merciful.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

The four paragons and sixteen sovereigns were furious, thinking that the guy was suicidal if he wanted to fight all of them at once.

“So domineering.” An expert took a deep breath.

“He beat Tian Feng so easily, let him say whatever he wants.” A high elder responded.

Others nodded right away. Li Qiye has more than shown everyone his power previously.

“Can he beat all of them?” One youth asked.

“None can take him in a one-on-one fight. Hmm, they have a chance to win though when teaming up. None of them are weak and I’m sure they have practiced extensively. This teamwork should be enough to suppress any of the conquerors.” An ancestor from an ancient clan replied.

“It would be favorable for them if they have mighty weapons.” Another from an archaic sect said.

“Don’t turn today into your last day. Hand the gemstone over!” Wild Paragon said menacingly.

“That’s my line.” Li Qiye posed with both hands behind his neck and smiled: “Come together, if you come one at a time, you won’t survive a single move. Of course, I only need one move to make all of you scram.”

Though the other three paragons were experienced and tolerant, they still felt the urge to vomit blood from anger. No one has ever claimed to be so superior, needing only one move against them.

“Junior, my rage will only subside with your death!” An old sovereign roared.

Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively and didn’t bother looking at them: “Stop shouting and wasting my time, just attack together.”

“Formation.” Sword Dao Paragon had enough and ordered his fellow men while murderous glints flashed in his eyes.
