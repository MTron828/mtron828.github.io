Chapter 5477: Fortune

The crowd stared at Li Qiye as if he was the high heaven itself. Jilin Buddhist Emperor and Azure Ancestor took their men closer for an official audience.

If it wasn’t for their ancestors, they wouldn’t have been qualified to pay their respect to Li Qiye. This was akin to mortals and regular cultivators wanting to have an audience with a dao lord - just simply impossible.

“My Lord.” Principle Conqueror kneeled before Li Qiye along with his descendants.

Li Qiye had visited the Lu in the past. Alas, he had no ties with them now outside of Principle being wise enough to serve him.

Li Qiye glanced at them and said: “I shall be leaving soon and given our fateful connection, you may ask for a fortune.”

Everyone listened attentively and became envious of the Lu. Although top cultivators didn’t necessarily need anything, their sect and clan certainly needed help.

To have a fortune from Li Qye meant that their descendants could prosper for eras to come. Everyone else desired a favor from the conquerors while the conquerors wanted nothing more than to be granted a wish by Li Qiye.

“You are too kind, My Lord.” Principle said: “But the Lu has already received your grace in the past and further greed will only birth complacency and pride. We ask for nothing more.”

This surprised many top cultivators nearby. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity yet Principle politely refused.

However, after thinking it through, some thought that this was a reasonable decision. The Lu was already strong enough with ample resources. Their descendants were blessed at birth.

Future prosperity depended on their descendants’ efforts and had nothing to do with Principle.

“That is fine.” Li Qiye nodded: “Humility is a virtue that can grant stability and peace.”

“We will not let you down, My Lord.” Principle bowed again with his descendants.

He knew that this might be their last meeting because Li Qiye wouldn’t just stop at the immortal continent. He would soar to a place unreachable by the likes of them.

Li Qiye nodded approvingly before gesturing for Li Zhitian to come closer. The latter obeyed and brought his fellow clan members over as well.

In reality, they were in a tough position. The Imperial Clan was a part of Celestial Court and had been a pillar for Heaven Alliance.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Li Qiye had stated his goal of attacking Celestial Court, meaning that he would be fighting their ancestors eventually. Therefore, Li Zhitian had no reason or qualifications to see Li Qiye.

Nonetheless, he was summoned and respectfully accepted the call.

Li Qiye smiled at him and said: “You have an open mind and an open heart, you do not discriminate between The Race or The People. Are you aware of your duties now?”

“Young Noble, that will be my life goal, I will guarantee peace and never show bias between the two sides. I will not let you down.” Li Zhitian understood and kneeled.

Li Qiye handed him the primordial fruit and said: “Let us see what you can accomplish then.”

“I humbly accept.” Zhitian accepted the primordial fruit.

All eyes were on him. Most couldn’t use the primordial fruit since they had their own dao fruits. This didn’t mean that the fruit was useless outside of cultivation.

The primordial fruit was gained through cultivation or fortune. No one else had access to one otherwise.

Since Li Zhitian had one outside of this, it implied that the Imperial Clan would have a primordial-fruit user in the future - an existence comparable to Immortal Pagoda Conqueror or their ancestors, Crimson Emperor and Titanic Conqueror.

The group paid respect one more time before leaving.

“Benefactor, will you visit Azure Peak again?” Azure Ancestor bowed, aware of how fleeting this moment was.

She was different from the others, possessing a special bond with Li Qiye. He was there to protect her during the moment of her birth and could be considered her father.

“I’m afraid not.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head. He then gestured for Li Xian’er to come over.

“She’ll stay in Azure Peak, she will do great things in the future and it is mutually beneficial.” Li Qiye said.

Both didn’t have a problem with this. Li Xian’er had no home to speak of so Li Qiye purposely set up Azure Peak as a new home for her. This would pave a stable path for her future, not letting her fall into the darkness.

The two women bowed one more time and retreated to the side.

Li Qiye turned his attention toward Ye Fantian and said: “You may tag along with me to train for a bit.”

This shocked everyone in the audience. By this point, Li Qiye’s superiority was apparent to all; they thought that he was the embodiment of the high heaven.

Apex cultivators were mere insects compared to him. Thus, this invitation took them by surprise.
