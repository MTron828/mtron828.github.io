Chapter 4218: Crumbled

Void Crush severed the spatial fabrics around Li Qiye along with his body. Though he was still standing there, the various body parts had been removed from each other. There was no way to block this swift attack.

The crowd was horrified by the effectiveness of this attack. They knew that it contained mysteries and profundities regarding the spatial affinity. Even some ancestors here would be dead before they could react.

“Such power!” Someone shouted.

“This is spatial manipulation. The fabrics of space severed themselves, not cut by an external force. Dozens of coordinates shifted in accordance to Void Saint Child’s will.” A big shot shook her head.

The experts understood the significance of this. Anyone caught in the spatial shift would be cut apart right away. That’s why Li Qiye still seemed to be standing. It’s just that his body was divided into different dimensions at this point.

“Boom!” Peace Ocean immediately made his move. Sword energies gathered at the tip of Vastsea before he thrust it forward. A beam capable of piercing three thousand worlds and time itself shot forward and penetrated Li Qiye’s chest. Distance and time no longer mattered before this attack.

“Whoa!” Spectators shuddered as a result since they felt the immensity of this attack despite not being the target.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Its sword intent pricked them by the throat and the chest, causing them to scream in pain. In fact, some actually bled profusely from these spots.

The thrust contained the myriad sword dao; all pierced through Li Qiye at the same time. This was an inescapable judgment of death.

“Vastsea…” An ancestor gasped. No merit laws and treasures could stop the power of this heavenly sword.

Void’s Void Crush separated Li Qiye’s body while Peace Ocean’s thrust pierced his chest. Both attacks were brilliant and unavoidable.

People were still waiting to see Li Qiye’s heaven-defying method. Alas, this seemed to be the end of him. This abrupt development left them dizzy because Li Qiye had performed numerous miracles in the past.

Unfortunately, he had no chance to resist this time around and was as helpless as a fish on the chopping board.

“This is how it ends?” A cultivator murmured, thinking that Li Qiye was dead.

“I didn’t expect this at all…” A fan of Li Qiye didn’t know what to do.

“He asked for it by using a broken sword against those two, idiot.” A youth sneered and felt superior to Li Qiye: “Just a young master can’t compare to real geniuses.”

Various emotions and thoughts surfaced in the audience. The duo themselves stared at each other, thinking that it couldn’t be this simple.

“Mmm, it’s over, time to leave.” A last-gen member begrudgingly said.

Since Li Qiye was dead, no one else had a chance of seizing Myriad Era from the two behemoths now.

Others became pessimistic and started dispersing. Only a few stuck around and maintained their original opinion, not giving up on Li Qiye just yet.

“Wait, something’s happening!” One of them shouted.

He saw Li Qiye’s hand with the sword moving a bit despite being separated from the rest of his body. At first, it moved like the directionless hand of a blind man before suddenly thrusting forward.

Strangely enough, the thrust didn’t aim at the duo but rather, his own torso.

“What is he doing?!” The crowd turned around and saw this.

They thought that he would do something incredible to reverse the situation. Alas, he somehow tried to pierce his own body.

“Shit!” Peace Ocean and Void were strong enough to have an instinctive awareness of danger.

Peace Ocean immediately pulled his sword back and raised it horizontally in front of him, sealing all dimensions around him. Unfortunately, this was still just a tiny bit too late.

As for Void, he traveled through the dimensions in a patternless and unpredictable manner, utilizing his various spatial leaping techniques. Alas, he was also too slow just like the king.

“Splash!” Blood splashed everywhere.
