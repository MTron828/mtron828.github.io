Chapter 5722: Summoning Call

The dao lords understood that running from Li Qiye was futile.

“No excuses, I’m just weaker.” Just-once accepted his situation. He had lost numerous times in his life and now, this was it.

“Can’t ask for more in life than to lose to you, Sacred Teacher.” Nine-wheel said.

“And here I thought I was unstoppable once. There is always a higher mountain and the imperial realm is only the beginning, hahaha. Sacred Teacher, end us swiftly.”

“As you wish.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Let’s go out with a bang!” Just-once Dao Lord’s dao fruits became resplendent as he channeled his vitality and dao power into them for a final explosion.

“Brothers, let’s face death together!” Nine-wheel and Armament laughed madly as they also performed the same suicidal explosion.

This was enough to destroy Imperial Field; no apex cultivator could have escaped unscathed.

“Boom!” Li Qiye merely waved his hand and dispelled the incoming explosions. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Just like that, three unstoppable dao lords evaporated from this world; not even corpses were left behind.

Nonetheless, they departed courageously, not shaming the image of a dao lord. They calmly faced death and didn’t beg for mercy.

Regardless of their position or who they were fighting for, they didn’t tarnish the title and dignity of the dao lords. Their lofty reputation and indomitable spirit wouldn’t be forgotten in history.

“Ooo-” A withdrawal horn could be heard from Celestial Court’s camp. They understood that there was no reason to fight.

“Kill them!” The leaders of Imperial Field gave chase against the headless snakes.

Corpses and blood rained from the sky. The remnant armies of Celestial Court were routed in just a short time.

The leaders returned, ecstatic with the victory. Celestial Court suffered a heavy blow and wouldn’t be able to invade anyone in the short term.

“That felt good, we’re going to crush Celestial Court!” Calamity Dao Lord was eager to launch an assault.

“Young Master, should we march?” Demon asked for Li Qiye’s guidance.

“March then, seize the opportunity yourselves if you wish to establish a foothold in this world. Gather the troops.” Li Qiye glanced at Imperial Field and said.

“Very well, gather the troops!” Calamity was the first to agree and ordered the legions to assemble again.

“Blow the horn.” Demon followed Li Qiye’s command.

“Ooo-” A long and deep horn could be heard, reaching every remote corner of the immortal continent.

“The signal for the counterattack.” Members of The People knew what it meant right away.

“To Celestial Court!” Top cultivators scattered all over the world knew what to do, feeling their blood boiling with excitement.

“To Celestial Court... how long have I waited for this day?” An ancient ancestor was moved to tears.

The People had waited for ages now for a chance to attack Celestial Court. Unfortunately, many ancestors couldn’t live long enough to see this day.

This was especially true for the veterans of Immemorial Epoch and Skysplitter War. At the end of Skysplitter, the duck egg buyer, Immortal Assailant Emperor, Immortal Emperor Fei Yang, and many more invaded Celestial Court.

They defeated armies in battle and eventually reached the celestial river. Unfortunately, this terrain forced them to retreat.

Only a few members could cross it unscathed. At that point, they wouldn’t be able to defeat the rest of Celestial Court. After enough deliberation, they unanimously chose to retreat.

Today was another hopeful assault. Perhaps they would be able to cross the river and topple the source of Celestial Court.

“Rumble!” Mighty cultivators from distant lands joined the ranks.

“Screech!” A phoenix cry could be heard as laws gathered in the sky to form the image of a massive phoenix.

A woman walked out of the radiance and was greeted by emperors and monarchs. Her title was Immortal Monarch Fengying.

“Boom!” A blood beam crossed through the horizon, spreading an ancient aura of the heaven’s wills and the mortal coil.

“Brother Chen Xue.” An emperor came over to greet him.

The world suddenly turned dark; only a pulsing red light could be seen. A man in a crimson robe appeared, seemingly serving as the guiding light.

“Immortal Emperor Chi Ye too!” People became excited after seeing this influential emperor.
