The heavenly tribulation increased its effort several times. In the beginning, the offensive force looked like a storm. Now, it was at the level of a full-blown tsunami.

It sent down golden ocean after ocean of lightning towards him, wanting to drown him completely.

Since he became the prime target, the bolts attacking the other areas weakened. Other areas under attack became less pressured as a result.

Of course, the onslaught was still useless. The tribulation above was certainly majestic but Li Qiye’s own ocean didn’t let up.

The quantity and quality of the offensive bolts didn’t matter. His ocean still took all of them in. The raging tribulation and its increasing effort actually benefited Li Qiye like an unending buffet.

“Boom!” The shrouding emperor nearby suddenly got struck by one of the golden bolts.

All of her concealing methods exploded.

“Activate!” She reacted quickly by raising her hands and summoned many treasures and activated numerous defensive measures.

“Rumble!” The lightning bolts aimed for her since she was now exposed.

A twelve-palace emperor like her was infinitely close to being as strong as a progenitor, leaving no room for doubts.

However, her defensive measures and treasures crumbled before the bolts. She couldn’t withstand the tyrannical force of the tribulation.

“Buzz.” She tried to shroud herself again but the golden bolts broke her method. There was no way for her to break away from the onslaught now.

She reactivated her treasures for another defensive attempt but couldn’t stop the attack. One bolt struck her and left a gaping hole.

“Leave! This is a domain of lightning now, the tribulation will destroy everything near me, go as far as possible!” Li Qiye shouted at the emperor.

She also realized that she was standing near the biggest target for the tribulation. The closer she was, the more likely she was going to be pulled into this mess.

“Take care, Dao Brother, we’ll meet again.” She couldn’t stay and risk being attacked again.

“Buzz.” She decisively opened a dao portal, knowing that Li Qiye would be just fine against any attack of the lightning affinity regardless of its might.

“Boom!” The tribulation seemingly sensed this attempt to escape and sent more bolts straight at her.

“Come here!” Li Qiye roared. His ocean of lightning became a maelstrom and started sucking in the bolts.

“Bam!” The emperor disappeared into the portal at the very last second before some remnant bolts struck and crushed the portal.

“Rumble!” The failure to kill infuriated the tribulation. All focus turned back on Li Qiye to no avail.

“Boom!” Li Qiye had an easy time facing the barrages since lightning couldn’t kill him.

At this exact moment, his dao heart suddenly trembled and he sensed this fluctuation.

This didn’t come from the tribulation or the golden bolts but rather the dark law sealed in his dao heart. It was obtained after killing the dark abomination back in Stone Harmony. It stayed dormant all this time until now.

“Finally, time to fish.” Li Qiye smiled with his eyes turning cold.

He leaped forward and moved through numerous domains in one fell swoop.

“Rumble!” His speed was unreal but the tribulation kept up. Behind him was still a flood of lightning bolts.

This was an incredible scene. The bolts resembled a golden galaxy illuminating the realms.

The spectators couldn’t see Li Qiye for they were dazzled by the golden radiance.

“Why is this tribulation flying around?” Many gasped in astonishment since they have never seen such a wondrous spectacle before.

Only Eternals and emperors at a certain level could see Li Qiye darting through space.

Alas, no one could get close. First, the speed was too much. Second, why bother getting close to that ferocious expanse of lightning?

That’s why they couldn’t get a good look at Li Qiye’s appearance. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Who is that being pursued by such a mighty tribulation?” One emperor noticed the pursuit.

The masters here became speechless at this domineering scene. The next one would shock them even more.

“Come now.” Li Qiye reached a remote area, deep in the crevice of the sky.

His lightning ocean spewed out a boundless radiance of lightning affinity and illuminated the entire region.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The set of explosions came from him this time around, not the tribulation.

He retaliated with a dazzling tsunami of lightning surging from his chest area.

“What is that?” The mightiest emperors and progenitors couldn’t keep their eyes open against this blinding radiance. They didn’t dare to stare straight at the move, let alone seeing Li Qiye clearly.

A lightning vortex formed from his ocean, spectacular beyond belief.

“Boom!” Immortal Lineage nearly exploded. All the bolts attacking the various places in this world headed for Li Qiye. He alone attracted everything.

The tribulation floating in the sky then sent out the rest of its arsenal after a loud detonation.
