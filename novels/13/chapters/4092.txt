Chapter 4093: Holy

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Many unfortunate souls were just too close to the battle. They learned their lesson after losing some blood, having underestimated the large-scale effects from a battle of this magnitude.

They then saw the colossal ape staggering backward repeatedly. Starshooter King was trembling uncontrollably as well. He would have been pushed back without the help of the legion behind him.

Alas, his expression darkened since he noted a shallow sword mark on his bow. Earlier, he used the bow to block Ninth’s slash. The guy actually managed to damage a dao lord bow made from divine metals.

Thus, his sword was most likely something incredible as well, not inferior to the bow in the slightest.

Ninth finally changed his stance. He floated up in the air and gazed at his foe without exuding any aura. Just his emotionless expression alone intimidated people. This god of death could reap any life including the two kings.

“Ninth is so strong!” It became apparent that this swordsman was far stronger than the two kings together.

“No wonder why he dares to challenge the Six Kings, he is qualified to do so.” An expert murmured.

“Yes, I think he might be stronger than those six too.” An ancestor said: “We’ve only seen the third slash, the ninth slash will be something else.”

Others took a deep breath and felt their scalp tingling. He seemed unstoppable after showing just three slashes. There were still six to go.

The two kings exchanged glances; both had a stoic look. The round earlier told them plenty about the future. They didn’t even think they could make it till the ninth slash. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Alas, escaping was not an option. First, there was a high probability of the opponent being faster and killing them anyway. Second, in the case of success, they might be able to stay alive but would lose everything else.

Their rumination didn’t last long since Ninth attacked again. It became too late for them to flee.

“Sixth variation!” He roared.

Swords appeared sequentially behind him, seemingly imprinting themselves into all three thousand worlds. Size and distance no longer served as constraints.

His voice echoed and a holy presence took over. It seemed as if he had reached the next level and became transcendent. All living beings were nothing more than tributes to him.

“Holy is the name of this variation.” An ancestor revealed.

Ninth decided to skip several variations and used the sixth.

“Clank!” The sixth variation consisted of six slashes in unison. It would annihilate emotions and desires, the mortal realm and saints, and all else in existence.

This was akin to an ascension process - tearing away the mortal coils and the associated factors in order to become a higher being.

The spectators suddenly found life to be meaningless and dull. They were willing to die to the slashes so that they could be freed.

“Die!” The two kings knew that they had no choice but to fight.

“Rumble!” The demon king raised his rod and chased away the clouds and winds. He started waving it in a circular motion to build momentum.

It released immense shockwaves while creating chaotic spaces. Dimensions began stacking on top of each other in front of him, serving as an impregnable wall.

“Clank!” As for Starshooter King, he somehow transformed the bow into a sword. The crowd was astounded to see this.

The terrible aura of a dao lord manifested into reality. The resplendent sword created numerous worlds as a result.

After loud explosions, planets materialized in front of Starshooter King. He then unleashed a forward slash containing planetary powers.

“Boom!” Terrible rays shot out from the impact point and destroyed several mountain ranges.

“Ugh…” During the loud blasts, people suddenly heard the noise of someone being unable to speak.

Nonetheless, they focused on the bright spectacles. The world was being torn asunder by the attacks and they were being blinded.

Once the light dispersed, they finally saw the aftermath.
