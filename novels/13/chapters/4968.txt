Chapter 4969: It’s A Miserable Life

He only smiled and didn’t respond. The two of them fixed gazes and time seemed to be coming to a halt. This communication didn’t require speaking, only a harmonization of the souls.

“You have grown old.” She stroked his hair and said. The word “beautiful” when used to describe her smile was an insult.

“Yes, just turned eighteen.” He smiled.

“Is that so?” She chuckled: “You’re not standing that straight anymore. It’s different.”

“What are you saying?” He said.

“Because your responsibilities are getting heavier, an entire epoch is pushing down on you.” She responded: “Since it is your epoch, no one will share the burden with you.”

“Right.” He said sentimentally: “The path is long and my burden is heavy.”

“It’s precisely why you aged so much. You alone must shoulder this world.” She said, becoming a bit emotional.

“Did your personality change too? This isn’t like you.” He smiled.

The woman glared at him, looking a bit amused. Her mood continued to affect the dao around her.

“Just a bit sentimental, I’ve been thinking about my father in recent years and you remind me of him.” She said.

“Don’t, I am not your father or your senior. If anything, you are older and I should be calling you grand aunt or ancestor.” He shook his head and stopped her.

“Don’t you dare!” She glared at him again. Even though her fierce eyes were still as attractive as ever.

Li Qiye shrugged and lay down, enjoying himself.

She lay down next to him on the divine mountain and stared at the flashing stars.

“I do miss him sometimes.” She said.

“It’s good that you still care enough about someone to miss them.” He said: “Though he is no longer around, the feelings alone attach you to this world.”

“What about you?” She asked.

He took his time thinking before responding: “I don’t know. Maybe I’ve forgotten or I just don’t have the capability to care, or perhaps I purposely avoid it. Everything, hmm, is simultaneously gone with the wind while still being carved in my heart.”

“Poor old man.” She gently patted his cheek.

“Don’t view me as a substitute for your father. I’m not old enough to have a daughter like you.” He gave her the side eye.

“You wish you have a daughter like me.” Her happy laughter warmed his heart.

“You have really changed. The previous you were always on guard and fierce.” He stroked her hair back.

“This is how I really am, I merely changed back to my original self.” She leaned closer to rest her face on his shoulder.

“I see, your childhood must have been good.” He said.

“It was great.” She nodded: “I grew up with my father and always held his arm. He stood at the apex and did everything so I did whatever I wanted.”

“How enviable.” He smiled.

“It’s jealousy for you, jealous that I had such a good life while you spent your time toiling in agony.” She laughed.

“No one wants to suffer. It’s just that I’m on the path and I refuse to turn back, that’s the only thing that is keeping me as myself.” He said.

“You even sound old.” She rubbed his temples and said: “My father said familiar stuff but I didn’t really understand back then. Now, although I’m not on the same level yet, I can sympathize.”

She let out a sigh of sadness and disappointment - something that has been accumulating over the years.

“It’s a shame that he’s no longer around.” She grabbed his arm and said.

He patted her shoulder and let her have a moment of silence.

“You’re still around, I’m sure he’s happy that you still remember him.” He eventually spoke.

She enjoyed being in someone else’s presence after a long time. After a while, she asked: “Is this world that precious to you?”

“Not quite.” He smiled.

“If that’s the case, why are you still protecting it?” She lifted her head and stared straight at him.

“Because this is a path of no return. I have chosen to walk forward so why would I falter? The moment I do, that’s the end of me and my dao heart. I cannot forget my original pursuit.”

“Trying your best to be untethered, I see. How lonely.” She said.

“I chose loneliness, not the other way around. Plus, there is no point in regretting my choice.” He smiled.

“So pitiful.” She felt sorry for him.

“Others call me the dark hand or a butcher, they rarely pitied me. I like where you’re going with this.” He laughed.

“My father’s path is similar to yours, but he wasn’t as pitiful. The things that drove him were emotions and love.” She said.

“I can only say that he was lucky, although this might not be the case if more time had passed. After all, many have taken this path, they were also motivated by emotions.” He paused for a moment and stared at her perfect features: “But I’m sure you know of their final choice.”

She shuddered for a split second but due to her cultivation, she calmed down right away.

“Would be nice if we could go back in time.” He said.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I agree.” She said.

“Why must people search for immortality? This is the source of it all.” He sighed.

She didn’t answer and stared at the stars.

“Thank you.” She broke the silence a long while later.

“For what?” He smiled.

“I wouldn’t have been able to see the sun again if it wasn’t for you. Even if I could somehow come out, I would not be me anymore. I am only myself because of your kindness.” She said.

He smiled and accepted her words of gratitude.

The two of them lay there together for who knows how long? Time continued to pass in this special dimension.

“I can keep laying here, can you?” She eventually asked.

“I can’t.” He smiled wryly.

“What a tough life.” She concluded.

“Is this my unlucky day or something? Don’t pity me so much.” He said.

“Because it’s the truth.” She chuckled.
