Chapter 4449: A Grave

The demon god had met many top cultivators before. He even faced the terrifying danger looming in Evil Flame Ridge. Alas, none of them could hold a candle to the attack just now.

He was able to struggle against Evil Flame Ridge but in this case, he knew that he would be reduced to dust without Li Qiye’s protection.

He realized that the apex was not actually the apex. There was an even greater height, one above his comprehension and scope.

The last few events have shaken him to the core. Most importantly, this overbearing power suddenly became gentle in front of Li Qiye.

The latter treated it as his own, capable of giving commands. Thus, just a hand wave from Li Qiye sent it away.

In his opinion, no one in all of Eight Desolaces could have endured that historically-unstoppable attack. The strongest characters would barely be able to block it.

Therefore, the attack was a tyrannical dragon instilling fear into all living beings. Alas, it felt like a docile puppy before Li Qiye.

It took a long time for him to calm down; cold sweat streamed down his back. He eventually asked: “Wh-what was that attack?”

It wasn’t here from the start nor was it a heavenly tribulation. This meant that someone purposely left it there, meaning that the source was even more impressive.

Not to mention him, even Dao Sanqian of Sky Border would be nothing more than an insect against this being.

“A true immortal actually exists?” He murmured since this was the only lifeform he could think of capable of leaving this attack here.

Of course, top masters have unanimously said that true immortals did not exist. Dao Lords believed that they were far from reaching the mythical characteristics of a true immortal in the legends.

However, dao lords were already unbeatable. So how could there be true immortals?

“If immortals are around, they won’t be there. A shallow pond can’t produce a qilin.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see.” The demon pondered and agreed with this logic. Eight Desolaces couldn’t handle the existence of one.

For example, his world has plenty of top geniuses in every generation. However, only one dao lord could be produced at one time. Perhaps there were exceptions of two being around, but this would be extraordinary.

Thus, it meant that Eight Desolaces couldn’t accommodate two dao lords. As Li Qiye said, a small pond wouldn’t be able to birth a qilin. Or, a kun would only appear at a great ocean.

“So who left behind this power?” He asked if an immortal wasn’t the right answer.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t respond. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The demon god was smart enough to not pursue this matter. He turned his attention towards the rock pile and became speechless.

This situation was akin to a treasure-seeker being filled with anticipation after finally opening the vault. However, they only found rocks instead of gold nuggets.

In this case, he only saw a stone tablet, nothing else. There wasn’t any engraving either. He initially assumed that opening the rock pile would show them the mysteries of immortality.

He believed that there would be billowing immortal energy or the rays of everlasting life, perhaps an immortal grass with a fragrance capable of delivering ascension…

He regained his wits and came closer, hoping to see something else. Perhaps it was hidden well and required time to ponder.

The slab seemed to be made from bluestone with shoddy workmanship. It hasn’t been polished either, seemingly removed from a cliff and was taken to this place. The craftsman didn’t leave a signature behind either.

His heavenly gaze didn’t spot him anything new - no runic lines and symbols. They didn’t exist at the start and weren’t added either.

Thus, this was just a regular slab of bluestone. The lack of hints made it impossible to even start pondering any dao mystery.

“What is this, Sir?” He asked for help.

“A grave.” Li Qiye gently touched the tablet.

“A grave?” He was only surprised for a moment before realizing how much sense it made. He was too focused on the chance for immortality and didn’t read the situation normally.

He then used his heavenly gaze and looked down but there was nothing buried underneath.

“This is an empty grave?” He asked again. Those who died with their corpse missing could still be remembered in this manner.
