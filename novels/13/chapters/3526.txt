Chapter 3527: Skeletal Blade

The power of the five ancient ancestors reached an apocalyptic level. The other inhabitants in Eight Desolaces were affected as well.

People were scared out of their mind, feeling that their true fate was being directly injured by the auras.

“Boom!” In the next second, Golden Sun Ancient Ancestor slammed his palm on the ground, creating a solar seal with an all-scorching heat. The ground started melting; the plains, mountains, and rivers turned into an ocean of lava. The liquid splashed high enough to look like erupting volcanoes.

“Raaa!” The azure dragon jumped into the surging lava, splashing the hot liquid everywhere.

“What is he doing?!” The spectators didn’t understand why: “Is he suiciding?”

“Obviously not.” A high elder understood the event and said: “It’s a type of fusion.”

He didn’t have time to elaborate because a clank could be heard. A sword rushed to the sky, certainly capable of splitting it apart, but showed restraint. It then flew into the lava as well.

First was the dragon king, now Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign followed suit.

“They’re really fusing?” A few skeptics wondered.

“Clank!” A deafening clank could be heard right afterward, causing people to shout and cover their ears tightly.

This didn’t help much because the sharp clank could penetrate anything.

They looked up and saw a skeletal blade flying out of the lava. It consisted of long and thick macabre bones. The sword energy emanating from it caused people to have goosebumps.

It had both sword hymns and draconic roars as if there was a dragon trapped within.

“A gigantic sword made from dragon bones?” Everyone took a deep breath. Could it be that those two earlier have fused into this sword?

“Poof!” Golden Sun Ancient Ancestor added to the confusion by turning into a plume of fire, seemingly made from the essences of a million suns. Just one strand would be enough to burn everything.

The plume flew straight to the skeletal sword and lit it on fire. The two separate entities eventually joined into one. The sword had a red glow now akin to molten metal, no longer the white of bones like before.

The spectators couldn’t help thinking that the sword came from the eighteen levels of hell - a dreadful tool of death.

“Rumble!” Silver Moon Ancient Ancestor sent down a gigantic round moon. There were divine palaces and holy grounds on the surface along with legendary trees.

The moon possessed unimaginable power, enough to smash the entire world into smithereens. However, as it drew closer to the ancestor’s palm, it shrank in size until it became a jade ornament.

He then disappeared from sight, replaced by a cataclysmic power. “Boom!” The tiny moon’s power only intensified despite the size reduction.

People were blinded by a flash for a moment. Once they could see again, they noticed that the jade moon was now embedded onto the skeletal sword.

“Buzz.” Silvery strands of sword energy oozed out of the sword. One is enough to pierce through anything.

It was a fascinating sight to behold - a crimson skeletal sword with a silvery glow. Anyone a bit cowardly would be scared stiff.

“What kind of sword is this?” No one has seen something like this before so they couldn’t come up with a title.

“Activate!” Star Ancient Ancestor roared and the sky suddenly sank.

Everyone felt as if he was dragging a galaxy downward. A portal manifested up above and poured down celestial light.

The day became night with countless flashing stars. Their starry light bathed the ancestor who tried his best to absorb all of them.

At this exact moment, the armies also controlled the supreme formation. The runes and arrays all rushed towards Star. Star became larger and larger to the size of a colossal giant.

He opened his mouth and devoured all the stars. “Boom!” Flames of the celestial affinity engulfed him. They erupted and covered the entire northern region.

Those in the distant lands could see this strange phenomenon. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What is this transformation?” The weaker cultivators had no idea.

“This is Myriad Dao Heavenly Physique, a form reserved for Heavenly Sovereigns.” One ancestor said: “At their realm, they could take in the myriad dao into their body. It becomes a vessel capable of storing immense energy.”

Everyone was in awe at Star Ancient Ancestor’s state due to its sheer size. Their horizon was broadened since this was a form created by Space Dragon Emperor. This allowed Heavenly Sovereigns to compete against dao lords.

Most benefited greatly from watching the battles today, enough to last for their entire life.
