Chapter 5117: The True Hunter

A terrible scar existed in the lower continents where Reincarnation should be. One of the twelve lineages was no more.

In the case of Heaven Burial, at least it went down to an external enemy. Reincarnation’s destruction was due to its own conqueror - someone who should be protecting it instead.

“I am now the lord of the three lower continents.” Greenmountain looked down and declared.

Listeners shuddered in horror. They were fat sheep standing near a hungry tiger.

“A cockroach wanting to be a lord?” A leisurely voice interrupted this solemn moment.

Although it wasn’t overly loud, everyone clearly heard it and became startled.

“I-it’s Li Qiye’s voice!” Most nearly cried from excitement. This included both The Race and The People. His voice descended like the first rays during a wintry night, giving everyone hope and warmth.

“Crack!” The symbol cracked, on the verge of collapsing.

“C’mon, c’mon, get out of it!” Ancient ancestors wanted to come and help him break out of the symbol.

“Die!” Greenmountain attacked instantly with a temporal beam, capable of withering anyone down to ashes.

The moment contact was made, the symbol exploded into particles. The waves emanating from it easily took down the temporal beam. The power of time had no chance against absolute force.

Greenmountain staggered backward, pale.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When the dust settled, everyone saw Li Qiye stretching lazily as if he was napping.

“Li Qiye!” Greenmountain glared at his opponent. He planned all of this with ample room for errors. Alas, he still underestimated Li Qiye.

He assumed that the power of four conquerors in addition to the ancient epoch would be enough to refine Li Qiye.

Sure, they did reduce Li Qiye to a symbol yet he still somehow got out unscathed after the symbol was gone.

Even a fool would know what was going on - Li Qiye was viewing him as a prey while he thought of himself as a hunter.

“Li Qiye is still alive!” Everyone rejoiced after seeing this, even those who wanted to see him suffer before.

His being alive was more exciting than anything. They even hugged and celebrated the matter.

“Fiercest is unbeatable!” An unknown spectator gave Li Qiye this nickname.

“Fiercest?!” Others nearby liked the nickname and started shouting as well: “Fiercest is unbeatable!”

They didn’t know that this was once Li Qiye’s nickname in the distant past. The lower continents had an unprecedented level of solidarity. Everyone was of one mind - hoping for Li Qiye’s victory.

“I knew about you, a little cockroach planning and scheming from the shadows. Now, you’ve finally shown yourself.” Li Qiye smirked.

“So what? I am no longer afraid.” Greenmountain took a deep breath.

“Oh? Confident, aren’t you?” Li Qiye said.

“It doesn’t matter if you have twelve dao fruits. Do you see this thing in my hand?” Greenmountain spoke while holding Chrono Disk: “If I use my life force, it will unleash the power of an epoch, more than enough to take you down. The worst-case scenario is both of us going down.”

He believed that his Chrono Disk was as strong as an epoch lord’s paragon artifact.

“I’m aware.” Li Qiye smiled: “The old geezer’s weapon. It’s not that mysterious, just disgusting with the forbidden refinement. Don’t mistake it for something impressive, it’s just a lowly art that isn’t worth mentioning.”

Greenmountain’s expression changed again. Few were aware of these secrets, perhaps not even the progenitor of Reincarnation and Blazing Conqueror.

He only came across an ancient scroll by chance and spent his entire life researching this matter before unlocking the wheel.

He suddenly had a bad feeling about this after listening to Li Qiye’s knowledge.
