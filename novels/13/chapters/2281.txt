The elder lord simply snorted with a fierce glare: “Unfortunately, your cultivation is limited since you aren’t a progenitor. The primal shield can’t save you or the valley.”

With that, he waved his hand, seemingly pulling up another world.

“Boom!” A world indeed started flying with another majestic momentum and power. Imperial rays emanated from it, illuminating the world.

Three figures appeared, each strong enough to rule the world.

“True Emperors!” A crowd could tell.

“Three intents left behind by Everlasting’s emperors.” Another ancestor said.

This kingdom had produced three famous true Emperors before. With such achievements, it was no wonder why they would dare to challenge Longevity Valley for the reign of the system.

“Boom!” The three figures empowered the old man, especially the one in the center - Lifejewel. He looked more tangible with a stronger aura.

Lifejewel was Everlasting Elder Lord’s disciple so the two of them were more compatible.

“Buzz.” The elder lord became blindingly bright while enjoying a massive boost of power. He took control of the wheel and increased the rotational pace. It reached such a massive speed that it looked immobile to the naked eye.

The same thing was happening to the black hole. Its absorption rate became much faster.

“Activate.” The beam doubled in size after a shout from the elder lord.

“Boom!” The fire shield failed to handle this surge and crumbled to numerous pieces.

The assault carried an invincible force, blinding all spectators.

“It’s over.” Everyone on the altar was ready for death. They didn’t expect for the beam to be powerful enough to go through the fire shield. They were certain that Li Qiye would turn to ashes along with the altar and themselves. It was too late to escape now so they closed their eyes, awaiting death.

However, none of this happened. The world seemed to have skipped a beat so they opened their eyes again.

“Nothing happened.” They looked down and found themselves to be perfectly fine before celebrating.

Next, they turned and saw Li Qiye standing there. He didn’t turn to ashes, contrary to everyone’s expectations.

The beam did connect on him but his chest exuded a radiance like the flipping of a scripture. Numerous runes and symbols appeared on him.

“Longevity Scripture!” Someone recognized this force right away.

“No, that’s not right.” Upon closer inspection, they found that it wasn’t the scripture.

A green light was flowing through him, filling the entire system with life.

“Look!” One fella pointed at the sky of Herb-plucking. They saw that this green light was actually coming from there.

A massive and old tree appeared. Its trunk was big enough, requiring dozens of men connecting their hands to surround it. Alas, it had less than ten branches and very few leaves.

Its age was too great so many branches have withered already. The tree itself could die at any moment. Nevertheless, its green glow still emitted so much life force. People were surprised that this near-death tree had enough life force to fill the system.

“The divine tree!” Someone shouted after spotting it. Others didn’t know about this tree and its immense power.

“The legend is true!” Everlasting Elder Lord’s expression soured. He had heard about this tree before, limited to the tales, of course. Now, its appearance confirmed the validity of these rumors.

“Know why I’ve been waiting?” Li Qiye smiled: “I just want to show you the true power of Longevity System, to let people know who are the real rulers here. Alchemy Immortal had left plenty of means behind. Don’t think you can rely on some foreign powers to take over, such naive thinking. Time to end this.”

He raised both hands and with a deafening blast, all life force gathered to his hands.

“Screech!” A phoenix hymn echoed across the area. A phoenix actually flew out of the tree to the astonishment of the crowd. Its feathers varied in colors. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The bird landed on Li Qiye and spread out its wings, seemingly opening a world.

“Boom!” A scene of green took over the blue sky. Everything seemed to have disappeared, engulfed in this green life force.

“Wutong Phoenix Tree!” The Untethered finally recognized the name of the tree.

So many progenitors wanted to get one for their own system. Possessing this tree would boost their system’s power to the next level. The progenitor of Yang Radiance also tried to do this but failed, unlike Alchemy Immortal.

“The power of the phoenix!” The elder lord knew the strength of this tree as well. He just didn’t expect for the tree to be here instead of Longevity Valley!

Many geniuses also understood the source of the suppression when coming to these mountains.

“Too late.” Li Qiye pushed both hands forward and created his own maelstrom. It instantly shot out a green beam.

“Rumble!” The world quaked as this green beam confronted the black beam. It was gaining ground due to its majestic life force.

The green beam grew stronger, pushing the black beam out of Alchemy Hut and towards Everlasting.

“Not good!” Everlasting Elder Lord and the twenty-five high ancestors were astounded.

“That’s the power of a phoenix...” The representatives took a deep breath.

“We’ve underestimated Longevity System.” One of them said.

In Myriad Lineage, Longevity wasn’t known for its military potential, definitely no match for Yang Radiance or Vermillion Martial Court. Some actually thought that it was only a second-rate system. Today, after seeing its resources, they realized that it only chose to keep a low profile.
