Chapter 5229: I Am Boss Tang

Only one spot was left among the thirteen so people waited eagerly for the last.

“I see that I am late.” Someone appeared in a mysterious manner - old in age but not in body and spirit, tall and muscular with a broad frame, capable of raising the sky.

No blinding aura and frightening divinity came from him. Despite the absence of dao signs, everyone could see that he was immensely strong physically. It felt as if as long as they were near him, even the sky falling down would be perfectly fine. Anyone would be willing to stand by his side. [1]

“Brother Immensity.” Skysword Dao Lord stood up.

The young geniuses performed a respectful bow despite already being on the twelve-fruit level. The cold Jue Xian’er bowed in her seat without getting up. This was as much civility as one could hope for from her.

Others were more than willing to pay their respect to this particular cultivator. He was once a supreme genius, most likely even more brilliant than the current Three Tians.

However, he stopped at one fruit and didn’t improve. Even his sons and descendants surpassed him eventually.

Thus, he became a topic of ridicule, at least behind his back. His achievement didn’t match his talent.

Nonetheless, his dao heart remained steadfast and eventually, he obtained eleven fruits in one go and finished an immortal shell at a later date. He stood shoulder to shoulder with apex existences such as Supreme, All-things Dao Lord, Sword Sea Dao Lord, Azure Ancestor…

The Three Tians felt close to him and viewed him as a role model because they were experiencing the same pressure.

He greeted everyone back before sitting down. His humble display put Suppression Conqueror in an awkward position.

Suppression came with fanfare, exerting his dominance and aura over everyone. Immensity - a stronger cultivator, chose otherwise. This difference in mentality was reflected in their strength.

All the auction participants have arrived with his appearance.

A bell sounded on the battleship and a youth appeared on deck. He lazily stretched and looked around in an arrogant fashion.

He wore an extravagant outfit as if wanting to tell everyone how wealthy he was.

“Uh… that’s Boss Tang?” A spectator whispered.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This cultivator was no stranger to both continents. Powerful cultivators sought him out since he had access to all treasures. If he couldn’t get it, there was no chance of procuring it otherwise.

Because of this reputation, everyone thought that he would look rather imposing and majestic. Alas, the only thing they smelled right now was the stench of a vulgar prodigal son.

He was definitely a thorn in everyone’s eyes and should be disliked wherever he went. Alas, this wasn’t the case due to his resources.

As for the big shots who have seen him in the past, they were already used to this. Nonetheless, they noted how his appearance didn’t change at all from the past.

“Okay, if everyone is here, we can get started with the auction.” He laughed heartily while clapping.

“What is the main treasure today?” The quiet Celestial Stone Dao Lord asked. He spoke slowly but every word was full of power and resonated deeply into the ears of listeners.

All eyes were on Boss Tang. This was an important question since it could change the bidding strategies of the participant.

“Allow me to keep it a secret, it will be revealed in due time.” Boss Tang smiled.

“What are you looking for today if it is indeed an immortal-level item?” Another asked.

“It depends on what is available. I hope I won’t be disappointed because the item is not from this world.” Boss Tang smirked.

“Not from this world.” Everyone took a deep breath after hearing this.

The main participants put on a solemn expression as well.

1. With this context, changing Heavy-ear to Immensity. That was a ridiculous title but the second character was 耳, meaning ear; handle; and that is all (classical Chinese). Now with enough context, it seems obvious. ☜
