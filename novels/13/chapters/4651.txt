Chapter 4652: Worldbreaker’s Hand

“Let’s get started already so I can see what you can do. I don’t believe in sorcery.” Tian Feng became impatient.

Though his aura was uncomfortable to be around, the crowd found Tian Feng to be an honest person, a man of his word.

His enemies needed to fight constantly while being trapped in a state of fear. However, they knew that Tian Feng would never resort to cheap tricks such as sneak attacks or relying on his sect. In a sense, this madman was rather cute for being so honest. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You will soon enough.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I doubt there is anyone in this world that can convince me otherwise!” Tian Feng laughed.

Another thing that people liked about Tian Feng was his willingness to accept defeat without giving any excuses.

“Very well, you may show me your abilities now.” Li Qiye became a tiny bit more serious.

“Boom!” Something suddenly exploded and everyone thought that the battle has started.

However, they realized that this wasn’t right since the sound came from Worldbreaker Fist.

The ground shook violently as if a major power was breaking out. Even though Golden Gate was relatively far away from the border, they still felt its intensity.

“What is happening?!” All eyes turned toward Worldbreaker. Everyone thought that something major was occurring.

More explosions came next and the fist intents there became chaotic like a brewing storm.

“This… looks bad…” Someone commented.

Sure enough, the intents gathered into a great hand that was visible to the outside region. Remember, the fist intents here were limitless. A top master once said that they could engulf all of Eight Desolaces.

This was a monstrous sight to behold. Although the hand didn’t encompass all of the fist intents, it still seemed terrifying and caused spectators to shout. It didn’t matter whether they were ordinary disciples or ancient ancestors. They all felt like ants.

Everything beneath the sky was subjected to the whims of the hand. It could crush the high heaven and obliterate the earth. Such power couldn’t possibly exist.

Fortunately, it was still contained within Worldbreaker and didn’t actively suppress others. Nonetheless, outsiders were still forced down on their knees.

At this moment, it descended in an attempt to grasp something. Powerful cultivators immediately activated their heavenly gaze in order to take a closer look.

They then saw a golden figure being chased by the hand. He ran for his life in order to escape the looming hand. Alas, his wondrous speed didn’t matter. It felt as if the hand was in complete control.

“Golden Fist Emperor!” An ancestor shouted.

“Ancestor!” Mad Fist bellowed.

“He is still in Worlbreaker.” A spectator said.

This surprised many people, especially those who were at Golden Gate. A while ago, everyone thought that he had obtained a great treasure from Worldbreaker. This started the interest in the marriage alliance. Rumor has it that this particular treasure exceeded even patrimony weapons. Therefore, the behemoths joined in as well.

During the marriage proposal period, Golden Gate stated that they didn’t know their ancestor’s whereabouts. No one believed them.

Most thought that he has returned to Golden Gate and chose to hide for several reasons. Firstly, he wanted to understand the treasure in order to improve his battle prowess. Secondly, he might be recovering from injuries.

None expected for him to still be in Worldbreaker. To be more exact, he never made it out of Worldbreaker.

“He’s being hunted.” This became obvious to everyone.

“What the hell did he do?” An expert murmured.

An ancestor who has read many records said: “Just entering Worldbreaker alone doesn’t start a hunt, the same for taking a few fortunes and treasures.”

“Right. Some fortunate souls have done so in history and became famous later. Worldbreaker never pursued them.” A high elder nodded in agreement.

A forbidden zone was dangerous. In the case of Worldbreaker, the possibility of turning into a fist slave was always present.

Nonetheless, adventurers still came for the hidden treasures and cultivation materials on top of dao enlightenment. In history, many were successful but they weren’t hunted by the land in this manner.

“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” An expert murmured.

“Yes, this shows that he must really have obtained an immortal treasure.” A big shot said with a stoic expression.
