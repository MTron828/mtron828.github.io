Chapter 3908: Lil’ Yellow’s True Identity

The sword citadel looked unbreakable. Calling it “impregnable” would be an understatement. The most important aspect of this technique was the divine sword hanging above. As it rotated, it also derived numerous sword dao of both the past and the future.

These dao could slay gods and destroy myriad realms. They deterred anyone from getting closer.

It became apparent for the stronger cultivators that the citadel itself has become a part of a new sword dao. Both ancestors and high elders knew that getting close would instantly turn them into targets. Their defenses weren’t enough to stop the slashes.

Sword Hero believed that his magnum opus could rival any techniques from the dao lords. Thus, he was brimming with confidence.

All eyes turned towards Lil’ Yellow - an old and feeble dog facing a citadel of swords. It seemed as if one remnant sword energy alone could decapitate it.

“Gao!” Lil’ Yellow barked and stared contemptuously at the citadel.

The spectators found this astonishing. They had no idea who the dog was but its arrogance put the ancestors to shame.

These top experts shuddered before the great citadel, not daring to get close. This dog, on the other hand, didn’t care in the slightest.

A while ago, some would attribute this to the dog being ignorant and foolish, simply courting death. Now, no one dared to say a thing after knowing Li Qiye’s identity. The pets of the Sacred Lord couldn’t be ordinary.

They actually thought that both Lil’ Yellow and Lil’ Black were divine beasts from Sacred Mountain. In other words, they were guardian deities.

Amidst everyone’s contemplation, Lil’ Yellow suddenly barked at the sky.

“Boom!” A blinding beam of light shot out of the dog’s mouth, looking as if it was trying to spew out its internal core.

Space trembled as the dog grew at a rapid rate, going from being tiny to the size of a mountain. Its fur was standing on ends. Its eyes became larger than lanterns, bright enough to illuminate the surroundings.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Metallic sounds similar to swords unsheathing could be heard.

However, it was just the dog scratching the ground with its sharp, black claws. They emitted tiny rays that could pierce through any defense.

It added a bit of strength and its paws dug into the ground. Cracking noises could be heard by everyone. They thought that it had more than enough power to tear Black Wood Cliff into two halves.

“It’s massive!” They had to look up to look at the dog. Its fur looked like billions of arrows aiming at the sky.

“So it’s actually a divine beast?” One spectator shuddered.

It looked gallant and intimidating without trying to do so. A Duality student dropped to the ground, looking as pale as can be: “I’ve never seen such a big dog before...”

The true form of Yellow frightened the students. It was a good thing that they didn’t sneak in to kidnap it. It wouldn’t have had any problem devouring them.

“Senior, is this one of the divine beasts from Sacred Mountain?” An expert quietly asked a mightier ancestor.

The ancestor had no response and exchanged glances with his peers. No one had an answer since they haven’t been to Sacred Mountain before.

However, an elderly high elder pondered for a bit before speculating: “This should be a chaos primal beast, an earthbreaker bi’an.”

“What level is it, high heaven?” A junior has never heard of this type before.

“No, a king.” The high elder solemnly said.

“A king? Is that another classification?” The junior asked for elaboration.

“You’re unaware because you’re not strong enough. High heaven-level is only the starting point for beasts. Their true power far exceeds your imagination.” His ancestor nearby replied.

“An earthbreaker bi’an? I’ve heard of it before. My grandfather said that he saw one killing a high heaven-level beast with one slash...” A royal member became frightened.

Others found this astounding. High heaven-level beasts were monstrous enough yet this dog killed one in one move? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Die!” Sword Hero’s voice came from the citadel. Sword hymns echoed as a maelstrom of swords materialized above.

The maelstrom instantly gushed forward like a tsunami, bringing enough destruction to kill just about anything. The crowd gasped after seeing this.

“Gao!” Lil’ Yellow barked at the incoming tsunami and its body started vibrating.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” The dog’s hair shot out with unstoppable momentum, instantly turning the sky into a sieve.

The hair strands struck the incoming swords, easily crushing them in no time at all. The bright particle remnants from the sword scattered before astonished eyes.

“Hair can be that tough?” Mouth became agape in disbelief.

Meanwhile, the Praetor who was dealing with Black became serious as well.
