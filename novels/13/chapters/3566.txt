Chapter 3567: I’m Just Getting Fruits

“What fruits are you looking for?” Yang Ling asked since this was the natural conversational flow.

Li Qiye looked over at the magical gem tree and said: “Overthere, that tree has plenty of fruits.”

“Magical gem tree...” Yang Ling thought that she had misheard him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Initially, Li Qiye didn’t garner a lot of attention. Some found his appearance strange but didn’t pay any more mind.

However, his comment made everyone stare at him.

“Do, do you know what those fruits are?” The girls’ eyes were wide open.

“Fruits are fruits, to quench thirst. What else can they be?” Li Qiye shrugged.

“Ignorant brat.” Zhang Yu who had a feud with him immediately jumped in: “You don’t even know magical gem fruits. Stop speaking or you’ll embarrass yourself even more.”

The other students from Duality stared strangely at Li Qiye. Some had disdain in their eyes; others thought that he was as bizarre as can be.

“Gem or no gem, as long as it can quench my thirst.” Li Qiye answered with a leisure smile.

“Nonsense, a frog wanting to eat swan meat.” Zhang Yu sneered: “You’re not qualified to eat those fruits. Hmph, you can’t even touch them. That dichromatic ape can smash you to death with a single finger.”

“Why must I be subjected to so much blabbering when I just want some fruits. What’s so hard about plucking some?” Li Qiye shook his head.

“What’s so hard about it?” Zhang Yu purposely raised his voice to stop Li Qiye from backing out: “Am I hearing things? A woodchopper just declared that plucking the magical gem fruits is an easy task? Is he looking down on all the heroes in the world?”

The listeners certainly thought that Li Qiye was being bombastically ignorant.

“The brat doesn’t know the power of that ape.” A few experts shook their head and didn’t like the nonsensical comment.

Those present including the ones from the Nightwalker Tribe have failed to grasp a single fruit. Thus, Li Qiye’s comment could be construed as insulting them.

“How ludicrous.” Zhui Xueyun was annoyed already from being injured earlier. Now, he snorted and stared at Li Qiye: “The thing protecting those fruits is a dichromatic ape, a high heaven level chaos primal beast. Just one breath from it can turn you into blood yet you dare...”

His strong reaction was understandable. His anger couldn’t be taken out on the ape; Li Qiye became the new target.

“Just because you can’t doesn’t mean others can’t.” Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted the guy.

Xueyun’s anger nearly rushed out of his throat in the form of blood after hearing this.

“How are you so sure?” Xueyun glared at Li Qiye.

“Of course.” Li Qiye smiled, completely nonchalant.

Not a single soul in the crowd believed him.

“No one here can make this claim.” An expert shook his head: “I don’t think you can ever get one in your lifetime given your power.”

“He’s just spouting bullshit.” Zhang Yu laughed and didn’t hold back.

“Can’t believe you all are having such a hard time getting a few fruits, looks like your intelligence is far below average. You overestimate yourself by coming to this mountain range for an adventure.” Li Qiye smiled.

This line offended virtually everyone in the crowd. The benevolent ones chuckled and ignored it. However, a few became aggressive.

For example, Zhui Xueyun. Li Qiye’s comment struck him hard because he failed to grab the fruits just now.

“Haha, I see. If you can get even one fruit, I’ll call you Master.” Xueyun sneered.

“I don’t want a disciple like you.” Li Qiye refused.

Xueyun’s eyes flashed with murderous intent. He restrained his anger and threatened: “If you can’t do it, then you need to bow to me three times. Otherwise...”

He didn’t finish but everyone knew what he wanted to do just by looking at his eyes. The two of them had no prior feud. Alas, the guy just needed to vent while Li Qiye purposely brought this on himself.

“So you insist on me grabbing those fruits.” Li Qiye became amused and grinned.

Unfortunately, people here were foreign to this grin.

“Scared now?” Zhang Yu said: “Words can’t be taken back just like spilled water. It’s too late for you to change your mind now.”

“If you want to give up now, bow obediently three times.” Xueyun uttered coldly.

“Brat, just give up. Your life is more important. It’s not shameful to bow to Young Lord Xueyun.” An expert wanted to help Li Qiye.

This was reasonable because in their eyes, Li Qiye was only a woodchopper. On the other hand, Xueyun was a genius with boundless potential. A few bows meant nothing.

No one here thought that he would be able to grab the fruits. It was nothing more than a fool daydreaming.

“I was going to grab them anyway.” Li Qiye smiled and pulled up his sleeves then walked towards the tree.

“Young Noble Li, forget it. Just apologize to Young Lord Xueyun, that ape will really kill you if you provoke it.” Yang Ling thought that Li Qiye was going for real.

“It’s no big deal.” Li Qiye continued forward.

“Junior Sister, just let him die since that seems to be his wish.” Another student said.

“It’s courting death.” The spectators could see the outcome already.

“Just watch, when he gets closer, the dichromatic ape will crush him to a pulp with one finger.” Zhang Yu snorted.

In fact, the ape didn’t need to do anything. The other chaos primal beasts were more than enough to devour Li Qiye.

Unfortunately, an extremely bizarre scene unraveled next, causing them to be slack-jawed.
