Chapter 4708: Immortal Gemstone

Despite his wondrous bulwark, he felt that Li Qiye could have killed him with a single thought, not needing to raise his hand at all.

“How… what merit law is this?” He couldn’t help but ask after being utterly dominated. No one could be this strong, he thought.

Jian Ming and the daoist trembled with fear. They knew about Li Qiye’s terrifying ability despite his non-flashy nature.

However, he became the high heaven or something greater just now. Even the immortal monarchs were nothing more than ants. He was in complete control and could determine the fate of the world at will.

This was a power beyond their imagination. It was dreadful to think that one particular being could have so much control over everything else.

“The dao can be used with a single thought, it’s not a merit law or anything.” Li Qiye stared at him and said: “You wanted to see the power of the union? That was it.”

The emperor took a deep breath. The power of the union was obvious at this point. The problem was - how did this person control it so easily?

“Invincible…” He murmured and turned pale.

For regular cultivators, ancestors of great powers were invincible. For the experts, he and the monarchs were invincible. For them, Dao Sanqian and the other eternal beings were the true monsters. Now, he gained a new perspective - this word should only be used for Li Qiye.

“Okay, don’t make me take the gemstone myself now.” Li Qiye said.

“I have to obey, Young Noble.” The emperor smiled wryly, realizing that it was suicidal to go against Li Qiye. Plus, he was a man of his word.

He took out an ancient box capable of sealing everything.

“Seems like you were prepared.” Li Qiye saw this and said. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He respectfully presented the box and said: “I was guided by a master and blessed by fortune before obtaining the gemstone.”

“A master? Ah, Golden Divine Fist.” The daoist said.

The emperor didn’t mind the revelation since he was focusing on Li Qiye. It turned out that he didn’t come across the gemstone by luck. His ancestor played a hand in this matter.

Though the latter has become a fist slave, he still cared about his descendant, hence the guidance in obtaining the gemstone.

Li Qiye accepted the box and opened it.

“Buzz.” An immortal beam shot upward and pierced the sky vault.

“My eyes!” Both Jian Ming and the daoist immediately felt a sharp pain and had to look away.

The emperor himself could only stare at it for a few seconds before closing his eyes.

“Look at that immortal light!” This alerted everyone currently in the union.

As for Li Qiye, he stared at the gemstone. It had a rhombus shape with pulsing rays, each seemed to be an independent world with its own celestial system. One ray could destroy Eight Desolaces if left unchecked, let alone the entire team.

The gemstone contained peerless power but not just anyone could control it.

Li Qiye closed the box and the beam disappeared. Jian Ming and the daoist heaved a sigh of relief and opened their eyes again.

“One of the five gemstones. Seems like the others are gone.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“There are five of them?!” Jian Ming was astounded.

“How strong would all five be together?” The daoist murmured. This was a force beyond their comprehension.

“That is correct.” The emperor knew more than these two and nodded: “The ancestor said that Worldbreaker once had five gemstones. Unfortunately, someone came and crushed them. This is the only one left behind.”

“The duck egg buyer.” Jian Ming recalled the legend with the gauntlet.

“That’s later on.” Li Qiye said: “The five gemstones are at their strongest when embedded into the gauntlet. Of course, its master is even stronger.”

This information astounded all three listeners. One gemstone was destructive enough but all five embedded on an immortal gauntlet? That must have been insane and virtually impossible to control. Nonetheless, its master could still do so. This being must be an unimaginable existence.

“Someone like that actually exists?” The emperor said in disbelief and fear despite already knowing the answer.
