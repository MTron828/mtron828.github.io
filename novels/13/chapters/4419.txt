Chapter 4420: Forceful

The stench of blood wafted in the air. The crowd exchanged glances, aware of the potential complications.

The east came with good intentions, hoping to form an alliance with Dragon. Now, one of their thirty-six sovereigns has been killed.

He was an influential character, being the successor of the Shenfan - an ancient clan of the east.

How could the alliance return and tell the clan about his death? The other clans wouldn’t appreciate this either since it appeared that their continent was being mistreated and looked down upon.

“Sect Master, your disciple is out of line.” The ex-sect master of Five-sun said with a serious tone: “We came as guests but now, blood has been shed. We demand an explanation.”

Without his sun, he was the leader of the alliance. It would be difficult for him to return to the east and tell the other clans.

Peacock Monarch slightly frowned. Death during a duel was normally not a big deal. Alas, this could destroy their alliance.

“Monarch, your disciple was too cruel. Killing an emissary is detrimental to our friendship.” Featherhat Paragon shook his head.

The members of Dragon naturally disliked their accusation. Their First Brother won fair and square. Moreover, Shenfan Tiejian was the one pushing the issue.

“He could only blame himself for lacking skills.” Celestial Tiger spoke up.

“Virtuous Nephew, you’re still too hot-headed. What if you were the one who was killed during your trip to the east?” Featherhat retorted.

“It was a friendly spar, not a fight to the death. It should have stopped much earlier. Does Dragon want an enemy instead of a friend?” Another ancestor from the east said.

“Are you sincere in forming an alliance with us?” Treasure Ancestor, an influential character, asked.

Peacock Monarch couldn’t answer right away. As the sect master of Dragon, he naturally wanted to form an alliance with these powers. It would be a great contribution to the sect.

“We will give you a reasonable answer.” Peacock Monarch ordered his underlings: “Capture Celestial Tiger.”

Dragon sect members exchanged glances of confusion. They wouldn’t want to capture their first brother. However, the worst-case scenario could be war with the east.

Some of them had to obey and surrounded Celestial Tiger.

“Who dares?!” Celestial Tiger roared and intimidated them.

Putting his impeccable power aside, the group didn’t want to capture him because he killed Shenfan Tianjie who insulted them. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Celestial Tiger, stay home and ponder your mistakes. Know better than to rely on brute force all the time.” Ancient Treant spoke.

First, no one would dare to challenge this ancient ancestor. Moreover, he was actually protecting Celestial Tiger by placing him under house arrest.

“Yes, Ancestor.” Celestial Tiger was furious about this situation and stomped his foot, albeit still obeying.

“We will make it up to you.” Peacock Monarch cupped his fist after Celestial Tiger was taken away. He knew that reparation was necessary in order to quell their anger.

“Let’s come up with a date for the engagement then. We come with full sincerity.” The ex-sect master of Five-sun said, not wanting to miss this opportunity. Jian Qingzhu’s bloodline was extremely important for their clan.

“Of course, it would be great if Five-sun King can become our sect’s son-in-law.” Peacock Monarch smiled.

“We’ll be waiting for your saintess then.” The ex-sect master agreed.

“Ex-sect Master, please reconsider.” Qingzhu humbly interjected: “An ordinary girl such as myself is unworthy of Five-sun King.”

The ex-sect master’s expression became unsightly. He said: “Virtuous Niece, marriage is arranged by the parents. In this case, leave it to your sect.”

“Hahaha, you don’t need to worry about us. I, her father, don’t dare to climb up your branch.” Goldbird Monarch laughed.

This naturally humiliated the ex-sect master.

Featherhat Paragon jumped in: “Monarch, His Majesty will become invincible later on. You will soar along with him.”

“Think about your daughter’s future. Nothing is better than being married to a dao lord.” Peacock Monarch said.

In reality, the experts and ancestors agreed with this viewpoint. They would love to have a female disciple eligible to marry Five-sun King.

“I appreciate the thought but if my daughter doesn’t want to marry, that’s final.” Goldbird refused.

“Gold, reconsider.” Ancestors who had a good relationship with him came over and said.

In theory, this marriage alliance should be a cause for celebration. Moreover, to refuse meant not giving face to Five-sun Sect and a potential dao lord in the future. This carried significant implications.

“Brother Gold, think about it again.”

“Goldbird, focus on the sect instead of your own whim.” Ancient Treant finally spoke: “Take your leave, now.”

He then increased his aura and froze everyone. Even Goldbird staggered backward from the pressure.

Ancient Treant believed that only good could come from this marriage so he has made up his mind.

Thus, the atmosphere became extremely tense for the involved parties.
