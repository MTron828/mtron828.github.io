“What do you mean?” She asked.

“The pits have been dug and placed on the path, the stakes are as high as can be.” He explained.

“For complete annihilation with one strike.” She responded.

“It’s not aimed at you all but rather, the villainous heaven. It’s just that the pits will catch everyone along the way as well.” He said.

“And if you are involved?” She asked.

“They would try to bury me as well since it’s a rare opportunity.” He smiled.

“I understand. I just hope that I can make it in time.” She took a deep breath and nodded.

“The trip is just as perilous as before, you make the decision.” He said.

“Young Master, you already told me that this path is one with no return. I am well prepared to meet my end since the start of my journey.” She said without any hesitation.

“Very well. Then recover and rebuild your cultivation first before starting the journey. You all must take charge of your own fate, I have done what I can.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes.” She nodded solemnly: “We’ll be waiting for you, Young Master. If we are no longer there when you start your expedition, just know that our spirits are with you.”

“I hope I’ll be able to see all of you again.” He looked up at the sky and let out a sigh.

“We will try our best to not let you down, Young Master.” She nodded.

“Just follow your heart, I ask for nothing more.” He said.

“And our heart is with you.” She said with absolute resolution before sitting down in the meditative pose.

He then placed his palm on her forehead and created a dao maelstrom in her mind.

“Buzz.” Her chest lit up and became a boundless galaxy. The maelstrom started moving downward and lit up one star after another. Its rotation began summoning the most refined essences and life force.

Since they were inside Galaxy, the maelstrom could absorb as much as it wanted. Various essences in the form of particles began floating toward her chest.

There were enough of them to create green energy rivers in the air in an elegant and peaceful manner. The particles resembled butterflies landing on desirable flowers. Their flow was of their own volition, not because of a devouring force.

As they joined the maelstrom, they aimed to strengthen her sea of memories and dao foundation.

Given her innate talent and dao comprehension in addition to Li Qiye’s power, they could have easily absorbed the entire tree. This would shorten the length of time required.

Despite the tree’s immense life force, Li Qiye could have absorbed it in just a short time, not leaving anything left. Instead of doing so, they merely channeled the power of the tree through the woman, flowing from one part to another.

They certainly nourished her without being depleted. Once this was complete, they would flow back into Galaxy. This decision allowed them to cure her without hurting the tree in the slightest, albeit at the expense of time.

Of course, others in Galaxy became startled right away. The tree was their very foundation. The moment the countless rivers of energy started to flow, alarms could be heard by everyone.

Ancient ancestors, dragon lords, conquerors, and dao lords all showed up to face the culprits, viewing this as an existential crisis.

“Who are you?!” One of them shouted while observing the rivers flowing toward the woman.

“State your name or face death!” An ancient ancestor shouted.

However, Li Qiye was busy with re-creating her cultivation and didn’t care to respond.

“Kill them!” A conqueror gave the order. The situation was serious enough for them to attack without finding more information or giving the enemies a chance to retaliate.

“Rumble!” Treasures appeared in the air. Ancient laws turned into various dao. Sacred and dao fruits manifested into reality and became resplendent.

Frightening auras ravaged the battlefield as these top cultivators worked together in order to obliterate the thieves.

They couldn’t afford to let this continue. If Galaxy were to wither and die, that would be the end of Azure Peak as well.
