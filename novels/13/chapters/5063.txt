Chapter 5064: A Lost Epoch

“A whole life of cultivation only to become a rabbit, is it worth it?” Ming Shi took a while before sighing.

“What’s wrong with being a rabbit?” Li Qiye stared at her.

She thought about this seriously before answering: “I won’t understand or know anything, no friends either, just a wild animal.”

“We’re not talking about the same thing. You’re thinking of a wild rabbit instead of a rabbit that has reached the truth.” Li Qiye chuckled and shook his head: “You’ll be one with heaven and earth. What you have forgotten or should remember has fused with the world. No friend? Everything is your friend then.”

“Is that so?” She murmured and glanced at the strange worms. They seemed so close to the monkey.

This gave her a new perspective regarding an absolute reversion to the source. The monkey didn’t seem to be having a bad time.

“Reversion.” Li Qiye pattered the monkey’s shoulder: “I can’t say that this is the wrong path. Once you jump out of the cycles, that is when it will happen.”

“I understand, Sir.” The monkey scratched his head again.

Meanwhile, the two women thought about how a dao lord was invincible, especially one with twelve dao fruits.

Alas, this monkey had done that and wanted to take it another step higher, albeit with an unconventional method.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Okay, I should get going.” Li Qiye got up after chatting with the monkey.

The monkey stood up and told Ming Shi: “Fate takes you to the dao and this place, do you wish to stay?”

He clearly wanted to bestow the princess a great fortune.

She immediately shook her head and said: “I don’t want to stay here, I’m scared of them.” She was referring to the headless worms.

“You don’t understand, silly.” Li Qiye shook his head: “These unique worms have a divine bloodline, they will transform and be able to eat top masters as if they are fried beans.”

“They’re divine beasts?” Though the worms looked cute playing with the monkey, she was still scared of them and shook her head: “I still don’t want to, let’s go somewhere else.”

Having said that, she grabbed Li Qiye’s arm and coquettishly said: “Young Noble, can I get a different fortune instead?”

“Let’s go then.” Li Qiye smiled.

The monkey and the tiger walked with them for a while. As they were about to split up, the monkey said: “There’s a chance I will not remember anything soon, but it is a blessing of three lifetimes to meet you, Sir.”

“Don’t worry, you don’t remember the world but the world will remember you, that’s enough.” Li Qiye said goodbye.

The monkey watched their departure before giving a command and happily roaming the plains with his tiger and the strange worms.

“Is it actually good returning to the origin?” Ming Shi asked after they got far away.

“This is a cultivation choice, you will be able to escape the cycles and don’t need to worry about the mortal coil.” Tendril King said.

“I don’t think it’s right for me.” Ming Shi smiled: “I prefer to just find the truth through cultivation.”

“That path isn’t all that great.” Li Qiye said: “It’s endless and that’s not even the hardest path. The true difficulty lies in being able to maintain your original conviction. Otherwise, you might end up turning into the thing you hate the most.”

“The thing I hate the most?” She repeated.

Tendril King understood right away due to her experience while Ming Shi remained confused.

“Is Golden Mosquito God scary and nasty?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hmph, I shudder just thinking about him.” Ming Shi responded.

“There are existences that have gone farther than him, far more powerful. In reality, their intrinsic nature is not different from him at all.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t want to become someone like that, devouring others.” She trembled.

“In order to prevent that, you must protect your dao heart. As long as it is indomitable, you will be able to travel far even after reaching the truth.” Li Qiye said.

“I will remember your guidance, Young Noble.” She nodded solemnly.

Tendril King could see that Li Qiye has a high evaluation of Ming Shi. This meant that the junior still had a long way to go.

Not to mention regular cultivators, even a genius dragon lord like her might not be able to reach the truth. However, Li Qiye was already talking about it with Ming Shi. The girl’s future seemed brighter than hers.

“You can do it.” Tendril King patted her shoulder.

The three walked in this land and felt its life force. Ming Shi had a hard time noticing anything special but Tendril King had questions.

“The power of this world seems different from our cultivation.” Tendril King asked Li Qiye.

“You are correct, because this cultivation is different, hence the unique nature of Demon.” Li Qiye nodded.

“So what is this place?” Ming Shi asked.

Demon was indeed different from the other dao lineages. They had deity branches and the power of worship; everything originated from a place known as the divine nest. The others’ system was straightforward and more personal.

“The remnant of an epoch, it has been repaired.” Li Qiye said with a casual tone.

“!!!” Tendril King couldn’t believe it. She had heard rumors about this but never took it seriously. So the divine nest of Demon belonged to a different epoch?

“What do you mean? Which epoch was it from?” Ming Shi became curious.

“Demon Beast.” Li Qiye glanced at the sky and said.

“Demon Beast.” The two women exchanged glances.

“What was it like?” Ming Shi asked.

“Do you know true dragons and phoenixes?” Li Qiye asked.

“Of course, they only exist in the legends and have never been seen before.” Ming Shi answered.

Some cultivators claimed to have the bloodline of true dragons. The actual creatures remained elusive.

“They were born in that epoch.” Li Qiye said.

“I see, so that’s why we don’t see them anymore, not that they don’t exist, they’re just from another epoch.” Tendril King commented.
