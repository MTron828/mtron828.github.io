Chapter 4886: Demoness' Demand

All eyes were on Li Qiye now - an ineffective king who wouldn’t be able to handle these notorious villains.

Monochromatic Master smirked since his plan was working.

Fire Ape walked forward and the crowd naturally made a path for him in order to avoid the heat.

Li Qiye wasn’t intimidated and said: “What is your desired reward for joining our dynasty?”

The ape let out a deafening burst of laughter and said: “If Toad King wants the northern riverland, then I want the southern heaven.” 

“Nonsense!” Many officials shouted since this southern heaven was virtually half of their territory.

The guests also shook their head since this response was ridiculous. Eight-stallion Dynasty would be in-name only afterward.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“That’s fine too.” Li Qiye smiled and had no issue with this.

“Your Majesty, you mustn’t!” All the loyal officials shouted.

“Your Majesty, this might destroy the dynasty!” Someone even shouted.

“No, if they wish to join with absolute loyalty, the land will still belong to us. So be it, your wishes shall be granted.” Li Qiye smiled.

Some officials nearly vomited blood while gritting their teeth. They were going crazy because of the new king, wanting to give the hard-earned territories to these villains.

“Hahaha! Good, I will have half of Eight-stallion then!” Fire Ape laughed boisterously.

People stared at Li Qiye as if he was an idiot, handing Eight-stallion to other people right away. Putting aside the citizens and soldiers, even the guests shook their head disapprovingly.

They had no idea why the dao lord gave the throne to someone so unworthy and foolish.

“Your Majesty, you should abdicate.” Demoness who has been watching in silence finally spoke. Her voice was alluring yet imperative.

The serious statement surprised everyone. A guest official wanting the new king to abdicate already?

“Oh? Why is that?” Li Qiye stared at her.

“I had a pact with the late king that if the successor ever causes a rift, my warship shall take over instead.” Her eyes were bright and enchanting.

“Your Majesty, you have shown your incapability during the coronation. Your actions will only widen the rifts in the dynasty, its members do not respect you.” She added.

Many agreed with her statement after seeing Li Qiye’s decisions so far.

“Is there such a pact?” Li Qiye glanced at the crowd.

Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God nodded in confirmation.

Meanwhile, the villains in the crowd became rather excited. This was exactly what they came here for.

This applied to Fire Ape and Toad King as well. They hoped to see the top officials of the dynasty fighting each other.

“Rest assured, Your Majesty, Warship will do a commendable job of reigning the dynasty.” She concluded. [1]

“I’m alright with abdicating but I wonder if they will agree. After all, you might not be as generous.” Li Qiye smiled, not minding this at all.

“Demoness, Warship will not have authority over me.” Toad King sneered.

Fire Ape laughed as well and said: “Demoness, if you take over Eight-stallion, I will just separate Southern Heaven from it.”

“I do not support you either, Guest Official.” Monochromatic Master stepped up and said.

She was ranked ninth and the other villains didn’t respect her enough.

Demoness glanced at Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God: “Isn’t it time to take care of this internal strife?”

The atmosphere became tense right away. Venerable would absolutely be able to defeat Toad King and Fire Ape. Wild Dragon would be the only exception.

“The pact does exist but I have no reason to be loyal to you.” Venerable Dragon God responded.

“We will support His Majesty. If you wish to deal with this internal strife, feel free to command your experts to do so.” Northern Monarch revealed her stance.

Their decision astounded the crowd. Why would these two support such an incapable king?

This put Demoness in a tough situation. She wanted to use the pact in order to legitimize herself as the next ruler. Nonetheless, this required her own strength to do so.

She was strong and her sect was mysterious. Alas, they would lose considerable men to deal with this tough situation.

She initially was glad to see how ludicrous Li Qiye was. The dynasty’s top officials should have supported her. Alas, both sides would not yield to her so the pact became useless.

“It looks like I’ll be keeping the throne.” Li Qiye smiled, leaving the crowd speechless.

“As I’ve said, the door is open for those wanting to join us. It is time for Wild Dynasty to do so as well, where is Wild Dragon? He should be here to show his loyalty.” Li Qiye asked Pyromancer.

Jaws dropped to the ground. No one dared to provoke Wild Dragon before outside of Eight-stallion Dynasty. Now, a junior wanted Wild Dragon to submit to him?

“Haha, as you wish, your Majesty.” Pyromancer’s expression soured as he blew a whistle.

“Rumble!” Loud rumblings caused violent quakes instantly.

1. The name of her sect is impossible to translate without context. Using Warship for now ☜
