Chapter 5181: I'll Help You Tidy Up

The duo crossed through many streets and alleys, commanding attention along the way. Of course, given the scale of the city and its diverse visitors, they weren’t too surprised.

Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind the uninvited companion who insisted on following him.

Eventually, they reached a small courtyard. The old bricks have been battered by time.

Only apex existences would note how special the bricks were - each had this shape from the initial conception, not molded by men.

The entire courtyard seemed to have grown from the ground, whether it be the bricks and roof tiles or the soil itself.

They would realize that one could obliterate the entire city but this place would still remain standing.

“So meticulous with a grave, the dead want to be buried like the living.” Li Qiye judged the courtyard and said.

With that, he opened the door and entered. It closed afterward and the old man in blue didn’t follow.

He sat down on a step by the corner of the entrance, waiting for Li Qiye to come out.

There was nothing inside the courtyard but an entirely different world. Li Qiye could see the profundities hidden within.

“Open.” He stomped on the ground and golden radiance appeared beneath his feet.

With him at the center, supreme runes and grand dao mantras manifested into reality. They intertwined like streams flowing through the cracks between the brick tiles.

In reality, each brick was already a dao seal. Li Qiye was imprinting his own dao in it.

A golden spring gushed out of the ground after loud explosions and formed a pond in a shallow spot within the courtyard.

Its appearance improved the courtyard and brought it to life with incredible vitality. It resembled the eye of the yellow river, capable of connecting the mortal world to hell itself.

Li Qiye took out the coffin of the Qian and added more seals to it before lowering it into the pond.

“Splash!” The coffin slowly sank into the pond and disappeared from sight. This was as if it was taking a trip to hell in order to bring the soul back.

“Rumble!” Next, he drilled dao laws into the ground, adding a layer of blessing to the entire courtyard.

One bodhi tree after another began to grow in this paradise. They swayed to the wind and emitted the fragrance of the grand dao. One could meditate here forever and be in touch with the dao.

“You’re stuffing a corpse in my resting place on top of trying to suppress me?” A feeble voice sounded.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It came from an old man laying in a long chair in order to bask in the sun - the same beggar seen earlier in the city.

Li Qiye finished with his task and smiled: “You’ve done an amazing job taking care of your corpse and death energy but since you were dead, it wasn’t perfect. I’m helping you get rid of all the impurities by turning this place into a paradise.”

“You’ve turned it into something awfully unsuitable.” The old man angrily said.

“I’m sure you didn’t expect your grave to be so nice and comfortable.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Why don’t you join me then?!” The old man retorted.

“Is that really what you want, my corpse being here too?” Li Qiye asked.

“Bah.” The old man spat on the ground and said: “Just imagine how inauspicious this palace would be with your corpse here. I don’t even want to see you now, let alone having to tolerate your corpse every day.”

“I see.” Li Qiye smiled: “I’m just borrowing it for a bit, and look, I’ve added some trees too in order to chase bad luck away. Since you died long ago, there is some unwanted accumulation but worry not, your friend is here to visit and help you out.”

“Maybe I should just kill you.” The old man said.

“Would you sweep my tomb after killing me? Or light an incense? No, I won’t even be buried since you would have devoured me completely. On the other hand, I actually showed mercy by letting you rest in peace, that’s how kind I am.” Li Qiye said.

“Go ahead and devour us if you can.” The old man said.

“No thanks, I don’t have the same taste as you, and I’m sure you old geezers would have made me puke after one bite.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“Fine, whatever.” The old man waved his hand: “This is the only exception, no more.”

“Yes, the only exception.” Li Qiye bowed and gracefully accepted this condition.

In reality, the old man had no choice since he was already dead. Plus, even back when he was alive, his group was still taken down by Li Qiye.

“Who is she?” He opened his eyes and asked.

“An ascender.” Li Qiye looked up at the sky and said.

“Hmm, not killed by the villainous heaven.” The old man shook his head.

“Yes, and she shouldn’t appear here either, which is why I revive her.” Li Qiye nodded.

“It seems things are changing faster than your expectation.” The old man said.

“Too fast, perhaps the established foundation is no longer there.” Li Qiye said.

“Then just wait, the villainous heaven won’t sit idly by.” The old man responded.

“Indeed, but others are not lazing around either, perhaps they are waiting for the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye said.

“A trap?” The old man’s eyes suddenly flashed with destructive rays.

“I would say so, someone is behind all of this.” Li Qiye said.

“Scared?” The old man joked.

“Not quite, it’s just troublesome having to figure it out.” Li Qiye rubbed his nose.

“Good.” The old man was happy to see Li Qiye suffer.

“It’s no big deal.” Li Qiye smiled: “But before I do anything, I have to find a flower for this place first or your unpleasant aura will resurface.”

“Get lost.” The old man didn’t appreciate his home being modified by Li Qiye.
