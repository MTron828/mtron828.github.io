Chapter 5537: Momentous Frontier

The moment the group left the new world, they met a familiar face.

“Sir.” The person was surprised to see Li Qiye as well. It was none other than Qin Baifeng from Sunset Glow Valley.

She didn’t expect to see him again, let alone so soon.

“Fate again.” Li Qiye sighed.

“Sir, where are you heading?” She asked.

“Dao City.” Niu Fen peeked his head out and answered before hiding again.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She glanced at the old snail and then the cloud. She recognized the latter since it came from the immortal artifact of her sect.

“I am also heading to Dao City, Sir.” She said.

“Then let’s go together.” He smiled and tapped the spot next to him.

“Thank you, Sir.” She happily got up and sat down next to him.

“We’re going!” Niu Fen shouted before rushing forward. This trip wouldn’t take long since Dao City was nearby.

“Not staying at the valley?” Li Qiye asked.

“Senior Sister can handle everything back in the sect and I am at a good spot regarding training, so I am coming back to take a look.” She responded.

“Qin Clan, the Heavensearchers.” Niu Fen interjected.

This slightly surprised her already, let alone his next line: “Divine Emperor Baili, truly a tragic death at Celestial Court.” [1]

“How do you know this, Senior?” She blurted out.

“It’s no secret, anyone who can reach that place knows.” Niu Fen shook his head.

She opened her mouth and didn’t say anything since it was indeed not a secret. This was the reason why their clan left and chose to stay in Dao City instead.

Li Qiye didn’t bother to inquire about past matters, still having a smile on his face.

“Sir, may I ask why you are heading to Dao City? Is it for Immortal Dao City?” She asked Li Qiye while glancing at the cloud.

She had never seen the immortal artifact before. However, Li Qiye left the valley with only this mysterious cloud. She speculated that it must have a deep connection with the artifact and therefore, Immortal Dao City.

“I’m not sure yet, just taking a look for now.” Li Qiye smiled and stared ahead.

“That’s Dao City, also known as Dao Domain.” Niu Fen stopped and elaborated.

They observed the majestic scenery ahead - towering peaks with stars rotating around them. Waterfalls seemed to come from the heaven itself and divine trees of unimaginable size…

Ancient walls and cities could be seen, projecting magnificent auras. This was a true manifestation of prosperity with no end in sight. Countless sects and villages populated the land.

The farthest reaches had an immortal energy. Although it was faint, one could still sense it from ten million miles away.

Nothing was more conspicuous than this type of energy. Each strand contained untold power, capable of pushing up the heaven or crushing the earth.

Beneath this expanse of energy was a city capable of withstanding the test of time. A calamity wouldn’t be able to destroy it.

It seemed to have been crafted by nature, completely unstained by the touch of men.

“Dao City, and Immortal Dao City.” Niu Fen murmured.

Immortal Dao City was one of the Nine Heavenly Treasures. Now it served as the headquarters for The People.

Immortal Monarch Yi Ye and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan were the first to reach the city, stopping waves of attack from Celestial Court.

In the end, they defended the city long enough for the duck egg buyer and others to arrive, successfully repelling the attackers. From then on, Immortal Dao City belonged to The People.

The surrounding areas and cities were known as Dao City or Dao Domain. It became the new home for the unfortunate victims of Immemorial Epoch War. They moved here and found hope for the future.

The cloud stared in the direction of Immortal Dao City, looking left and right. It seemed to find this place rather familiar.

As for Li Qiye, he only glanced briefly at the treasure before focusing on something else.

When others took a look, they would note the undulating mountains and flowing rivers. As for Li Qiye, he saw images of a great momentum - a golden age. However, he frowned after seeing that something was missing.

“That is?” He pointed ahead.

“Still a part of Dao Domain, mostly inhabited by mortals.” Niu Fen said.

Qin Baifeng became excited and said: “Sir, that is Momentous Frontier, our clan is there right now.”

“Momentous Frontier.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Would you like to visit our humble abode?” Baifeng hurriedly invited.

Li Qiye patted Niu Fen and said: “Notice anything?”

“Haha, Young Master, you don’t need to test me. I don’t need to look to know what’s there, a tablet capable of controlling the momentum of many eras.” Niu Fen said.

“What a shallow observation, go there.” Li Qiye patted him again.

“Alright…” Niu Fen obeyed.

“Sir, we would be honored if you don’t mind staying at our residence.” Baifeng saw that he wanted to go to her region.

“Very well.” Li Qiye nodded and said: “It’s been a while since you’ve been back?”

“Yes, I am a clan master there but there are limits to training in Momentous Frontier, so I received permission from the ancestor to join Sunset Glow Valley.” She elaborated.

The Qin had fallen and couldn’t produce a capable cultivator. Moreover, there were certain rules to Momentous Frontier as well. Thus, she had no choice but to leave for Sunset Glow Valley.

Since her cultivation improved recently, she took a break to visit home again since it had been a long time. Unlike a traditional clan master, she wasn’t responsible for passing down the clan’s legacy and cultivation, only keeping a watch and making decisions when necessary.

1. This was Conqueror in a previous chapter but Divine Emperor might make more sense since he’s from the tenth world ☜
