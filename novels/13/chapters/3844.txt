Chapter 3845: Who’s The Heavenly Genius?

The youth saw auspicious signs and couldn’t keep it to himself. However, the Grand Seer’s warning woke him up and he hurriedly left the scene.

Some started talking about him right away. One said: “Looks like his future is quite bright to see those events.”

Others were envious right away. After this, more and more wanted to give it a shot.

They wanted to find out whether they would see the same auspicious signs, perhaps becoming a sect master or a leader in the future. Maybe a sovereign wouldn’t be out of reach.

Thus, someone from the last generation climbed up the platform and touched the crystal ball. It lit up and allowed him to see his own images.

Once he let go, he sighed, looking a bit dejected and sad. He left without saying anything.

Everyone could tell that he had seen something unfavorable regarding his future fate, hence his expression. This created the opposite effect.

Seeing ominous signs would leave behind immense pressure. It was better not to try.

Nonetheless, another youth tempted fate and followed the process. Once he let go, he became confused and asked: “Senior, I saw a white elephant. What does it mean?”

“A white elephant is a sign of mighty power.” The seer answered.

The youth was ecstatic and continued: “What if it starts breaking down mountains and rivers?”

“The mystery known only to heaven cannot be divulged.” To which the seer responded.

The listeners understood that the seer knew the answer but just didn’t want to speak.

The youth had no choice but to bow towards him then left.

“Might as well try.” Eventually, a line formed beneath the platform. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The majority couldn’t resist this opportunity and gave it a shot. The result was mixed.

One started punching the air in jubilation from seeing something good. Another had a solemn expression and even sighed.

A few had no clue what the signs meant so they asked the Grand Seer for guidance.

“Senior, I saw myself pushing forward while wielding an evil sword...”

“Grand Seer, I saw blue clouds somehow blotting out the sun, leaving nothing but darkness...”

“Grand Seer, I only saw a circular light, nothing else...”

The Grand Seer rarely answered, treating his words as if they were gold.

Those who believed that their future was ominous even asked him for support in order to change it. Alas, he only answered with the same phrase - the mystery known only to heaven cannot be divulged.

“Young Master, do you wish to try?” Wei Qianqing was filled with anticipation.

Yang Ling thought the same way and wanted to try herself too.

“No need.” Li Qiye smiled while staring at the crystal ball.

“Young Master, given your ultimate prestige, I’m sure what you see will be incomparable...” Yang Ling urged.

The cultivators nearby snorted, finding the comments to be ludicrous. The geniuses and experts here wouldn’t pick such words to describe themselves, let alone someone like Li Qiye.

“My fate is unfathomable.” Li Qiye chuckled.

His group nodded in agreement after hearing this. The old servant thought that it would be difficult to gauge Li Qiye’s future.

However, the crowd found it rather ear-piercing.

“Unfathomable? You think too highly of yourself.” One youth sneered.

“Even the ancestors can check their fate, why can’t you? Just go up there and see.” An expert accused Li Qiye of being arrogant.

Three Slashes himself glanced at Li Qiye then Wei Qianqing. He then said: “The Grand Seer’s remarkable divination ability is second to none. He had checked Eight Stallion Dao Lord’s fate before, so you can give it a shot, Fellow Daoist.”

“Damn right, the Grand Seer even read the future of someone as peerless as a dao lord, let alone a junior like you. It will require zero effort.” The young lord of the Tuhuo added, purposely putting down Li Qiye.

He could see that Three Slashes was interested in Wei Qianqing while she was too close to Li Qiye. Thus, he wanted to help the guy out.

“Crystal alone can’t handle the immensity of my fate.” Li Qiye smiled.

A furor started after he said this. People stared at him and considered him to be ignorant.

“Preposterous! That crystal ball read the fate of a future dao lord!” One older expert shook his head.

“Fool, even the supremes are respectful towards the Grand Seer for his magical ability. I can’t believe a junior is running his mouth like this.” A high elder added.

Many insulted Li Qiye, thinking that he was being disrespectful towards the Grand Seer.

The Grand Seer himself took a look at Li Qiye, slightly raising his muddled eyes. They became profound right away, seemingly capable of seeing everything with total clarity.

“This young master has an auspicious fate.” He then suggested: “Go try, maybe the heavenly genius is none other than you.”

“What?!” The crowd immediately clamored like boiling pots after hearing this.

“He’s the heavenly genius?” Others started paying attention.

A while ago, the Grand Seer no longer wanted the responsibility of looking for the heavenly genius. Now, he said that Li Qiye might be the one?

“Really?” People started examining Li Qiye.

“No way, the Grand Seer himself said that nothing is absolute.” An old cultivator said.

“He was being sarcastic, right? This youth dared to question his ability.” A youth uttered coldly.

Others found this to be the highest possibility. The Grand Seer must be annoyed at Li Qiye for doubting him.

However, he didn’t bother explaining to others and still focused on staring at Li Qiye. The latter stood there calmly as well.

“See, you’re the heavenly genius, go and confirm it. Show everyone the wondrous images that will stem from your fate.” The young lord of the Tuhuo smiled and said.
