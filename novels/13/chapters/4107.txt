Chapter 4108: Gift

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Subsequently, Armament Mountain treated Li Qiye as an esteemed guest of the highest order. He enjoyed the best treatment and hospitality possible.

They never brought up the disciples killed by him either since he had saved their sect. The prior feud seemed insignificant in comparison.

As its savior, he could do whatever he wanted right now in the sect. With one word of his, the best genius and prettiest female disciple would come to serve him. Of course, he had no interest in any of this.

Shi Yingxue knew what he wanted. Thus, he didn’t need to ask again before she started a conference with the elders and ancestors.

“Young Noble, we have come to an agreement that you may take the ancestral peak. When will you need it?” She reported after the meeting.

She had taken the risk of deciding on her own during the moment of crisis. Nonetheless, she still needed to let the seniors know.

The ancestral peak had a special status in their sect, serving as its spiritual totem. Emotionally, it was difficult for them to part with it.

Nonetheless, she carried out her promise despite how hard it is on her personally.

“I like trustworthy people.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Since fate has brought us together, it will be a gift to you.”

Shi Yingxue became confused for a moment before replying: “Youn-young Noble, are you referring to the ancestral peak?”

She thought that she misunderstood since it would be ridiculous.

“What else can it be? You want something else?” Li Qiye chuckled.

Her mouth opened wide in astonishment. She found it hard to regain her wits. In the beginning, he came precisely for the ancestral peak. Its value and importance couldn’t be understated. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

After putting in the effort, the peak was finally his yet he simply gave it away just like that?

No one would believe this illogical and ridiculous story. However, it was indeed the case.

She was overwhelmed with emotion. The two of them were strangers yet he gave something so precious away?

“Young Noble, aren’t you here because of it?” She asked, thinking that this was a dream. It would be perfect if they could keep their peak.

“I was just a bit interested, don’t really need it.” He paused for a bit before continuing: “If I actually needed it, I wouldn’t have asked since I could take it whenever.”

Anyone else would become livid after hearing this since he was blatantly disrespecting Armament Mountain.

Forcefully taking their ancestral peak would result in an all-out war. The members would fight to the death.

Moreover, few in Sword Continent could actually bypass their defenses to grab the peak. After all, they had two dao lords and numerous masters.

It’s just that Li Qiye sounded so confident as if he only needed to reach forward. This could be construed as ludicrous arrogance.

Alas, she actually agreed with him. Though he never showed his power and might not be as strong as the Five Overlords, she thought that he would actually be able to take their peak uncontested.

It was just like before. He said he could solve the disaster in Armament and he managed to do so.

“Thank you, Young Noble.” She got on the ground and bowed her head: “It is an honor to receive your grace. I will do everything I can to follow your orders, the same with Armament Mountain.”

“Your intelligence is the reason for Armament’s survival.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Thank you for your kind words, Young Noble.” She felt deep gratitude because she knew that Li Qiye was doing her a personal favor. He didn’t fear her sect at all.

“Go now.” Li Qiye said.

She kowtowed again before leaving. This became a joyous day for her. The sect was saved and they got to keep their ancestral peak as well.

Li Qiye stayed as a guest in Armament for a while but still received reports from Ning Zhu.

“Miss Xu asked when will you be returning? She wishes to go to Cloud Dream Lake.” Ning Zhu said.

“For what?” He asked casually.

“She said that you have bought some land there, Young Noble. However, the other party refused to honor the transaction so she has to go there and recover it with force.” Ning Zhu said.

“Oh? Someone dares to go against me?” He smiled, seemingly amused instead of becoming angry.

Ning Zhu didn’t say anything. This smile of his signaled the death of many people.

“What a coincidence, I need to go to Cloud Dream as well. Tell Yiyun that I’ll be tagging along.” He added.

“Yes, Young Noble.” Ning Zhu obeyed. She seemed to have something else on her mind but refrained from speaking.

“Speak.” He noticed her expression.

“Young Noble, I… wish to return to Wooden Sword.” She revealed.

“Why?” He stared at her.

She gently bit her lip and said: “I’ve heard the news of Ninth sending a challenge letter to my master and he had agreed. I want to go back and see him.”

“I see, this guy recovered quite fast, not bad at all.” He chuckled.
