Chapter 5200: Can’t Follow Him

Dracoflame took a deep breath and maintained his composure while still analyzing Li Qiye and the servant.

As a dragon lord with nine sacred fruits, his vision was impeccable. After traveling with his master, he met numerous big shots but Li Qiye seemed different.

This person resembled an ordinary youth but his servant was unfathomable. Dracoflame knew that he stood no chance against the old man after the first exchange. He wasn’t afraid of the bear but this creature was rather powerful.

It frustrated him not being able to see through Li Qiye. Why did such an ordinary man have these capable servants?

“May I ask where are you from and what is your grievance with my master? I can deliver your message to him.” Dracoflame said, capable of being flexible in adversarial times.

“I have no grievances with your master but he is not qualified to lead Imperial Attendant and needs to scram.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hundred Dao is a part of Imperial Attendant. We have contributed meritoriously and my master is in charge in accordance with the rules.” Dracoflame said: “No matter the angle, my master is qualified to rule, his dominion is recognized by the various powers of the city.”

“You speak well but it is useless with me since I am the laws. I won’t make it difficult and keep you here. Go, tell your master.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Dracoflame didn’t know what to do before this arrogant man. Keep in mind that Hundred Dao was the defining power in Imperial Attendant currently and his master was a being nearly on the same level as Sword Queen or All-things Dao Lord.

They couldn’t tell him to scram as if they were clear superiors. This was insulting enough to warrant a fight to the death.

Nonetheless, Dracoflame took a deep breath and said: “I will send the message but just know that you are out of line. My master will surpass everyone…”

“Just an insect. I am showing mercy out of consideration for the ancestors of Hundred Dao, hence giving him time to scram.” Li Qiye answered.

“You!” Dracoflame had to restrain himself again: “Fine, I will leave now but my master does not respond well to threats. Visit Imperial Attendant if you wish, he will be waiting.”

“How interesting. Let him know that he should prepare a coffin before my arrival.” Li Qiye smiled.

Listeners couldn’t believe it. Everyone knew the might of Suppression Conqueror. The ancient ancestors of Qilin Manor, Iron Tree, and Alchemy Dao couldn’t take him down while Li Qiye spoke as if this was no big deal.

“Sir, we’ll be awaiting your arrival.” Dracoflame quelled the internal fury and bowed.

“Good. I can see that you’re talented so I will spare you once in the future.” Li Qiye nodded.

Dracoflame had never been treated like an ant before. The guy spoke as if he could crush Dracoflame on a whim.

This feeling of being treated with utter contempt infuriated him. Nonetheless, he knew that as long as the old servant was around, there was nothing he could do to Li Qiye.

“I appreciate your kind intention.” Dracoflame bowed again and left with haste.

“Young Noble, are you going to Imperial Attendant to take down Suppression?” Gourdkeeper became excited because with Li Qiye’s help, their chance of victory would soar.

“I will, but not right now.” Li Qiye said.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s pick a time then. We’ll tell the geezer to bring Resplendent Array before launching an assault.” Gourdkeeper suggested.

“No need.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The group became disappointed after hearing his refusal. They wanted to keep him around but he was already leaving with his followers.

They tagged along until they were outside of Alchemy Dao. They waved in his direction and shouted: “Please come visit us when you have time.”

Saintess Shao Yao, in particular, stared in his direction for a long while even though he was no longer in sight.

She wanted to say goodbye but since the seniors were around, she didn’t get the chance to be alone with him. Moreover, she didn’t have the courage. She felt especially disappointed because she didn’t know when the next meeting would be.

She thought about chasing after him just to say goodbye or just to take another glance at him. Alas, he had disappeared into the horizon.

“He is something else.” Panacea said: “No matter how strong we are, we will only be able to watch his back.”

“Yes.” Shao Yao nodded.

He gently patted her head and said: “Silly girl, your responsibility is to develop Alchemy Dao back to its golden age, don’t think about anything else.”

“Senior Uncle, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She turned red and wanted to hide in a hole.

“I’m not blind.” He sighed: “I’m afraid you’re not qualified to stay by his side. Look at his followers, I can’t even detect their cultivation. He might not even accept you a a servant, poor girl.”

“Senior Uncle!” The embarrassed girl ran back to the sect, not wanting to stick around.
