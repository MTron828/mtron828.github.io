Chapter 5504: I Choose You

“You’re trying to comprehend this tablet.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, but that would be an unprecedented feat. Only our fairy has been able to do so, I’m here to attempt the impossible.” She said.

“You’re not the only one who can’t understand it. It’s alright.” He said.

“I just need to be recognized by the artifact.” She didn’t have an issue with her lack of comprehension and continued staring at the tablet.

After a while, she turned towards him and asked: “Young Noble, what do you see?”

“What’s the punishment for spying on another sect’s secrets, decapitation?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sure, for other sects.” She nodded because this was indeed the truth.

Li Qiye seemed to be violating this by observing the tablet of Sunset Glow Valley. However, the sect didn’t have a problem with it.

“But remember, you and our sect are definitely connected by fate, so it is fine for you to take a look.” She winked cutely at him.

“This fate thing is rather convenient.” He nodded and smiled.

“Young Noble, you’re making it sound like you understand the tablet.” She realized something and became excited.

“Just a little bit.” He smiled.

“No way, there is a reason why you’re not leaving. If you can somehow understand the tablet, you can control the immortal artifact just like our fairy.” She started fantasizing.

“I don’t know about that.” He smiled at her.

“You are amazing.” She said enviously: “You’ve only been here for a bit and immediately noticed something right away. Heck, you might be more than just connected to our sect, it seems like you’re the chosen one. We should be welcoming you with a grand reception.”

“Now that’s pushing it, I have no relation to your sect.” He shook his head.

“Young Noble, do you know of our ancient tradition?” She smiled mischievously.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What are you up to?” He smiled.

“I see, you don’t know.” She was clearly playing around with him.

“How does an outsider such as myself know your tradition?” He said.

“Don’t worry, I know about it. It originated from our progenitor, Sunset Glow Devil Emperor.” She responded.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer.

She happily continued teasing him: “You see, when the circumstances are right, the sect can select an Emperor Consort, one who might lead the sect.”

Having said that, she stared at a male statue in the hall and said: “For example, our second Grand Emperor knew that a disaster was coming so she picked an Emperor Consort and left him in charge of Sunset Glow. This was proven to be a successful decision.”

As male emperors had queens, female emperors also had consorts. The second Grand Emperor of Sunset Glow trusted her consort to properly take care of the sect during her time of crisis.

“And?” He asked.

“How about I pick you as our next Emperor Consort? You can stay here and be recognized by the immortal artifact, doesn’t that sound marvelous?” She held his hand as she said this.

“Not interested.” He swiftly refused.

“Why not? Am I not pretty enough?” She asked directly.

“You are.” He smiled.

“Don’t you want to be my Emperor Consort?” She showed no sign of embarrassment.

“I’m just a passerby who will not stop traveling.” He shook his head.

“Oh?” She didn’t expect this answer from him and became curious: “Wait, so there is no place or anyone who can make you stop?”

“My dao has no end.” He smiled.

“How lofty.” She said with admiration as she stared at him: “It seems like your height is beyond my imagination. I can’t pick you as my consort then.”

“Have a little more confidence. With enough luck, you can guide Sunset Glow to a bright future.” He said.

“The more you talk, the more I think that you can control the immortal artifact.” She said.

“Well, it’s because I can.” He said.

“You can’t do it if you don’t become my consort.” She shook her head.

“If I want something, I will just take it.” He said.

“That’s stealing.” She didn’t expect this response.

“I’m just taking it, not stealing from anyone.” He said.

“When you take something that doesn’t belong to you, it’s stealing. You’re ruining the mood. I told you, you can have it if you want. Just become my consort.” She grabbed his arm and said.

“You’re not even the valley lord yet, already thinking of how to cook the duck before catching one.” He chuckled.

“That’s okay, I just think that our valley can use a capable Emperor Consort. If you don’t want to marry me, you can marry my junior sister instead. I’m sure that you will do great things for our sect.” She smiled cheerfully.

“Great things?” He asked.

“It goes back to fate again. Without the interference of fate, you wouldn’t be sitting here right now. No one else had this fateful connection for eras, so there must be a reason and I wish to push it further.” She explained.

“You’re overthinking this.” He said: “It won’t happen though.”

“Well, how about staying here for a bit? Our valley can be quite fun, no need to leave right away.” She asked softly.

“This world is vast. If I were to stay at any place that is fun, I would run out of time.” He said.

“You’ve been to many places?” She asked.

“Indeed.” He responded.

“I’m sure there are many legends and adventures about you left behind in these places. What about your descendants?” She stared at him curiously before asking the key question.
