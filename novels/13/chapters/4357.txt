Chapter 4358: Kick

“Please, kind sir.” The old beggar insisted but Li Qiye didn’t respond.

“What do you want?” A different disciple asked.

He didn’t answer which confused the group.

“Don’t you see the coins in your bowl?” One attributed this to him being blind.

“He can’t see anything, right?” Another added.

“I bet he’s famished too, that’s why he doesn’t care about anything else right now.” A female disciple joined in.

“Do we have any food?” The group was kind-hearted and tried to help.

“No. Where are we going to find some buns?” Someone else responded.

Though they weren’t experts, they still didn’t need to eat like mortals. There was no need to pack food or rations during a long trip.

“I have a snake-scale fruit. He can have it.” A generous youth looked for a while and took out a fresh fruit from his pouch.

This was a common fruit for cultivators but for mortals? It was extremely nutritious, especially for a malnourished old man. It would fill him for several days.

“Hey, take this and stop asking our sect master.” He placed the fruit into the bowl.

Alas, the old man insisted on begging Li Qiye alone: “Please, kind sir.”

The young ones lost their patience. From start to finish, they have been rather cordial to him.

After all, who would give a damn about a mortal beggar? If he were to infuriate cultivators, they might just kill him.

Thus, Little Diamond’s members have shown generosity and compassion. Alas, the old man was being rather stubborn.

“What do you want?” One of them lost his politeness.

The old man continued on shaking his bowl in front of Li Qiye, seemingly ready to stay forever until Li Qiye acquiesced.

“We’ve already given you money and food.” An older disciple unhappily complained: “If you won’t move, we’ll have to make you and it won’t be pleasant. I don’t think your old bones can handle it.”

They didn’t look down on the old man but he was being unreasonable to their sect master whom they respect.

Li Qiye was surprisingly patient today and smiled at the old man: “What is it that you’re begging for?”

“Life.” The old man finally spoke.

“?!!” The disciples immediately unsheathed their weapons and put on a defensive stance after hearing this. They assumed that he carried malice towards the sect master.

“I don’t think you can bear it.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Please be generous then.” The old man shook his bowl faster this time.

“Fine.” Li Qiye smiled and raised one leg before kicking with an unknown amount of strength.

“Whoosh!” Nonetheless, this sent the old man flying across the sky like a shooting star.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he had made it out of the city or even Dragon. This naturally stunned the members of Little Diamond.

Their mouth was wide open, not expecting Li Qiye to mercilessly kick the old beggar with so much force.

They thought that he was dead for sure, or the best-case scenario would be surviving with all of his bones broken.

After all, sending someone out of the city with one kick? Its power was immense while the old man was feeble. A random kick could break his ribs, let alone what Li Qiye did.

“... H-he’s dead for sure…” One disciple stammered. Even they would die after being kicked like that.

“No, I’m sure the sect master showed mercy…” Another disciple spoke on behalf of Li Qiye.

Despite being a small sect, Little Diamond still, more or less, considered itself to be part of the orthodox and righteous faction.

Now, their sect master had just killed a beggar. This might become a topic of scorn and ridicule.

“There is no need to worry.” Li Qiye smiled: “He’ll still be alive and well after you’re all buried in your coffin.”

“Uhh…” The young ones were left speechless and unconvinced. They were vigorous cultivators so there was no way an old mortal beggar could outlast them.

Of course, little did they know that this old man last showed up in Sword Continent. Going from Sword Continent to Sky Border was exceedingly difficult. Few in the world could travel across continents.

Alas, this old man could do so and showed up wherever Li Qiye went. Thus, how could he be killed by a single kick?Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Sect Master, do you know him?” One of them calmed down and asked.

They gradually realized that this meeting was not a coincidence. The beggar purposely came to see Li Qiye.

“Just a dead man.” Li Qiye casually responded.

“A dead man?” This caught the young ones off guard.

“I-impossible. I saw that he was clearly alive.” One of them said. Though he was up there in age, he was certainly alive.

Nonetheless, the group always took Li Qiye seriously.

“Why is a dead man playing the part of a beggar, Sect Master?” Another became curious.
