Chapter 5805: My Overlords Cannot Lose

No one had a problem with Profound conceding to Li Qiye. The question was how were they going to slow him down.

“Make way then.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Profound shook his head and said: “You will still have to walk over my corpse first.”

His calm tone still evoked emotions from listeners - a response worthy of being the mightiest emperor from Celestial Court.

“How stubborn.” Li Qiye smiled. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, Sacred Teacher, but Celestial Court will persist forever after my death.” Profound said with conviction.

His allies felt their blood boiling and their courage returned.

“Persist forever.” The emperors closest to Celestial Court such as Light-dragon shared this sentiment.

They have spent their whole life toiling for Celestial Court. Thus, they had no problem hoping the best for its future.

However, Profound was an outsider who had only appeared in Celestial Court a few times. His loyalty and determination left everyone in awe.

Not long ago, Titanic Conqueror removed her bone to leave Celestial Court. This dealt a blow to their morale.

After all, removing that forehead bone was agonizing with lasting consequences. Nevertheless, some wanted to follow in her footsteps. The price aside, it was better than dying with Celestial Court.

The next sequences turned the tides, starting with Sword Emperor swearing to protect Celestial Court. Immortal Emperor Hao Hai who came from the nine worlds remained steadfast. The most mysterious and powerful of them all, Profound, still had confidence in its survival.

Therefore, the wavering ones decided not to leave right away. There might be a reason for Profound’s confidence.

“So much confidence.” Li Qiye chuckled after hearing this.

“Our three immortals and founder have surpassed the test of time and were rewarded with a primal anima. They will guarantee Celestial Court’s future.” Profound said.

“So you’ve met them before.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Indeed, I was graced with their presence.” Profound said, causing others to become excited.

Sword or Nether might have only seen one or two among the four. However, Profound spoke as if he had met all of them.

“Primal anima.” Li Qiye smiled: “I can slay them just like that.”

The declaration suffocated and killed the crowd’s excitement. None thought that he was merely boasting.

“Yes, but our foundation is more than just that.” Profound shook his head.

“The overlords?” Li Qiye chuckled.

This used to be a taboo topic so none dared to talk about them previously.

Profound answered with silence.

“You haven’t thought about the possibility of their not showing up even after your death and the collapse of Celestial Court? Do you know where they are, have you met them before?” Li Qiye continued.

Profound didn’t answer while others thought he hadn’t met them.

Although some of them were gifted incredible treasures, it appeared that an actual meeting had not taken place.

Who among them had seen the overlords? Just the founder and the three immortals?

“Sacred Teacher, the supreme overlords are slumbering, the likes of me cannot meet them, but your intrusion shall wake them up.” Nether said.

“I’m afraid that’s just a fantasy. They won’t care about any of you, just be smart and run away.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I trust the overlords and will not yield, Sacred Teacher.” Profound shook his head.

“Fine, we’ll see if they will save you.” Li Qiye said.

“They have their reasons, a junior such as myself is not worthy of their time, but Celestial Court will be.” Profound looked ready for death.

“Wow, such loyalty. If you all wish to die protecting this place and the old geezers, have it your way then. Don’t worry, I will keep you alive so you can see how I will slay your supreme overlords.” Li Qiye clapped.

Listeners felt a chill coursing down their spine, somehow believing he would stay true to his words.
