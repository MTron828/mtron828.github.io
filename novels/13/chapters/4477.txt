Chapter 4478: Golden Isle

Golden Isle was connected with a peerless dao lord - Emperor Ye.

This being had “emperor” in the title instead of “dao lord”. In history, many believed that the emperor was one of the strongest dao lords, comparable to Blessed Dao Lord or Puresun Dao Lord.

The emperor had entered forbidden zones before and killed the ominous existences there. This was an unparalleled achievement.

However, the most interesting tale included the end of the Blessed Era and the sealing of True Immortal Sect. From then on, this sect no longer produced another dao lord.

Remember, True Immortal was considered unbeatable due to its foundation erected by Blessed Dao Lord.

During this era, Blessed Dao Lord spread the seven laws to all existences. This started the golden age of cultivation.

In fact, eighty to ninety percent of all cultivators back then considered themselves to be students of Blessed Dao Lord. His cultivation methods truly benefited the world.

He had numerous capable followers back then, too many to count. The beings in the forbidden zones kept quiet during his reign.

The most magical part was how his successors also became dao lords. In other words, True Immortal Sect had a monopoly of dao lords during this era.

The second most famous dao lord in True Immortal was none other than All-things Dao Lord, Li Dao’er.

His cultivation was impeccable; his mastery of All-things Mantra actually exceeded Blessed’s own. Moreover, he taught three thousand disciples and each of them went on to become top masters. All of them also changed their last name to Li. Because of this, some respectfully gave All-things Dao Lord another nickname, Li Sanqian. [1]

At first glance, three thousand disciples didn’t seem impressive compared to Blessed Dao Lord’s widespread fame.

After all, nearly every cultivator back then considered themselves to be under Blessed Dao Lord’s banner.

The main difference was the actual tutelage. Blessed Dao Lord didn’t teach them while All-things Dao Lord was actually involved in training his disciples.

Later on, future generations said that although All-things Dao Lord wasn’t as strong as Blessed Dao Lord, his disciples were far superior.

These three thousand disciples made True Immortal unbeatable. The sect’s actual power might actually be greater than during Blessed Dao Lord’s era.

Unfortunately, his legacy had a large stain caused by a single arrogant woman. She severed the monopoly and became the dao lord instead, the only person to do so during the Blessed Era.

She had an amusing phrase even before becoming the dao lord, “I will tie and beat up Li!” [2]

Everyone thought that since this was her “slogan”, she was purposely aiming for True Immortal. After all, the disciples of All-things Dao Lord had changed their last name to Li. Therefore, the top dogs of True Immortal and even the entire world had this last name.

The might of True Immortal was not enough to stop her. They had no choice but to watch her become the dao lord since she was unstoppable.

After her generation, True Immortal’s geniuses started taking over again. The monopoly resumed for the subsequent generations. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

No one could change this fact so the sect appeared to be eternal, always standing at the apex.

Another person disrupted this cycle - Emperor Ye - a girl praised to have the greatest innate talent in history.

Back then, ninety percent of potential heirs came from True Immortal. They had so many that it required a system to keep track of these heirs - three Lord Princes, six Heavenly Princes, thirty-eight Sacred Princes, Ninety-two Celestials…

This didn’t matter because these high-potential geniuses were all killed by Emperor Ye. This golden age of talent couldn’t match up to a single cultivator.

Before becoming a dao lord, she fought her way into True Immortal three times and left successfully.

Keep in mind that at this point, even the forbidden zones refrained from provoking True Immortal. Alas, she had no problem doing so even before proving her dao.

The sect was aware of her frightening talent and even resorted to ambushes in order to stop her from taking the dao lord position.

They sent seven ancient gods, thirteen golden dragons, sixty-seven godkings, eighty-nine paragons, and countless other ancestors… This was their full force, all mobilized for the sake of dealing with one girl.

This expedition was enough to destroy all of Eight Deolaces and campaign against the forbidden zones. They were ready to pay any price for the sake of keeping their monopoly.

According to the legends, she massacred them all, resulting in rains of blood and the world torn asunder.

She inflicted untold destruction on True Immortal. In the end, they failed to stop her from becoming a dao lord despite trying everything. This marked the end of the Blessed Era.

They declined afterward and couldn’t produce another dao lord. It wasn’t until recently that they started recovering and becoming a top behemoth once more.

It gradually became the leader of Eight Desolaces and could look down on the world again. Alas, their top disciples and sect masters never brought up retribution against Golden Isle.

As Wise Ancestor had said, even the sect master of True Immortal would act with respect while visiting Golden Isle.

After millions of years, Emperor Ye’s prestige and authority still remained unchallenged.

“Golden Isle.” Li Qiye looked up and murmured.

1. Sanqian means 3,000 ?

2. This line is hard to translate. Since this was brought up before in the final chapter of the first half, I believe the author is implicating something for us. The more formal/literal translation would be, I will tie and beat up (anyone with the last name) Li. In Chinese, calling someone by their last name in this manner is informal and purposely rude. In this case, it was 姓 (last name) and 李 (Li). So, in Chinese, it can be construed as either singular (a single person) or plural (an entire clan with this last name). This is why it is difficult to translate it to English. I have to either pick that it is a single person or that it is anyone with the last name Li. The first being, I will tie and beat up that Li guy; the second being, I will tie and beat up those Lis or I will tie and beat up anyone with the last name Li. In this case, I believe the author is implying the singular, but I have to try and keep it ambiguous in English. This is why I chose the translation; it doesn’t sound good or correct, but at least it keeps the ambiguous effect. ?
