Chapter 4327: Who Opposed?

Deer King and Gao Qixin acted as representatives of the smaller sects without questioning them. The rest didn’t have the chance to voice their stance since it was too late.

To refuse right now was to blatantly insult the young lord, risking punishment from Dragon. Thus, even those who wanted to remain neutral couldn’t say anything.

The young lord smiled while seeing the lack of opposition. Of course, he didn’t actually care about these smaller sects. Their plan and strategy didn’t take these sects into account in the first place.

Nonetheless, this was a great starting point thanks to Deer King and Gao Qixin. He was awfully pleased.

“We appreciate your noble intention, Young Lord. Soaring Feather School will share the burden.” A girl sitting on the top platform spoke. She wore a phoenix dress and had plenty of treasure ornaments covering her with their radiance.

This beautiful noble was none other than the daughter of Soaring Feather School Master. She was quite powerful after learning her father’s art.

Her school was a great power in Southern Desolace. Though it couldn’t compare to the behemoths, it still wielded ample influence. Thus, her words carried far more weight than Deer King or Gao Qixin.

“Soaring Feather is indeed a pillar of the world.” The young lord has been waiting for this.

Everyone knew that Deer King and Gao Qixin merely tried to flatter him. Now, Soaring Feather School’s attitude was considerable support.

He alone had no chance of activating the divine altar. However, if he could somehow garner the support of the other great powers, he would become the leader of the young generation and surpass the heir of Lion’s Roar.

More minor powers voiced their support afterward. This didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things outside of adding to the young lord’s momentum.

“I don’t like this.” A youth from a small sect whispered.

The young ones were smart enough to know that they were merely being used as stepping stones by the young lord. Their only value was to make the meeting more official and exciting.

Because of this, they could be used and abandoned, completely helpless to the young lord’s whim. This was not a pleasant feeling to have. Alas, their seniors remained stoic and stopped them from acting out.

“Flow Gate will also toil for this great cause. We shall help you activate the divine altar.” The young lord of Flow also revealed his stance.

Flow Gate was about as strong as Soaring Feather, being the second great power to support Crystal Dragon Young Lord.

Putting aside Dragon’s ambition of taking over the south, everyone could see the young lord’s desire of becoming the leader of the young generation.

After all, his father was mighty and overshadowed the experts of Lion’s Roar. As the saying goes - with a distinguished father, the son is sure to do well. He didn’t want to fall behind, wanting to make a name for himself by surpassing the heir of Lion’s Roar.

“We shall support you, Young Lord.” Weaker great powers began to voice their support as well.

Nonetheless, many still chose to be neutral. Though Dragon and the young lord had all the momentum right now, Lion’s Roar has been the leader for too long. Thus, its authority remained in the heart of these cultivators. Dragon couldn’t replace it just yet.

“Perfect, I appreciate your help, gentlemen.” The young lord had achieved his goal today despite the neutral group. He had enough great powers on his side to activate the altar without a problem.

He laughed and continued: “We shall be remembered today for our contribution to the world. Gentlemen, I propose a toast, we shall activate the altar tomorrow.”

His plan has been carried out perfectly and the heir of Lion’s Roar was still nowhere to be found. His mood couldn’t be any better. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

On the other hand, some of the neutral parties found this quite strange. The young lord’s goal was obvious for all to see yet Lion Roar’s heir was nowhere to be found.

Did the heir want to give up already? Did he think that he was inferior before actually trying?

“No, we can’t activate the altar!” However, someone rudely interrupted his gloating moment.

The voice wasn’t particularly loud. It’s just that this was a crucial moment and someone actually stepped up to oppose the young lord. It erupted like thunder in the listeners’ ears.

“Who is it?!” The majority searched for the speaker.

At first, they all assumed that the speaker was none other than the heir of Lion’s Roar. He was the only one with enough authority and influence to challenge the young lord.

Alas, they saw that it was an old man with a hatchet hanging on his waist.

The majority didn’t recognize him. They scanned his cultivation and found him to be extremely weak.

“Who is he?” This confused everyone - a nobody daring to oppose the young lord? How suicidal.

“Wait, I know, he’s from Little Diamond, right?” An elder from a small sect quietly said: “The least-talented cultivator in that sect, Wang Weiqiao. He had joined for a century now and is still weaker than a novice.”

“Is he insane?” This frightened the audience.

“He can be suicidal all he wants but he’ll drag his sect down with him like this.” One sect master said.

The small sects were afraid of being dragged into this mess and kept a distance from Weiqiao, acting as if they didn’t know him. What the latter had done was verbally slap the young lord in the face. The consequence was rather obvious for both him and his sect.
