Chapter 5191: Please Recall Your Power, Young Noble

Of course, this was only a mere reflection of the nine worlds. Nonetheless, memories of familiar faces popped up - those who had fought with him and waited for him…

All were no longer around. Prosperous sects and protectors have turned into ashes, not leaving a single trace behind. Worlds have shattered; blue seas turned into mulberry fields.

While Li Qiye immersed himself in old memories, Gourdkeeper and Resplendent were shaken.

“You… you can control our Resplendent Array? Impossible!” The monarch became slack-jawed and shouted just like a cat with its tail stepped on.

Only the merit laws created by Peerless Monarch of Qilin Manor could activate this secret treasure.

In the long history of their sect, only a selected group of geniuses had access to the merit law. Among them, only three to four managed to learn it - all core members of the sect. This naturally didn’t include Li Qiye.

It was frightening how effortlessly he controlled the array, something a ten-fruit dragon lord couldn’t do.

As for Gourdkeeper, he had seen the array activated before. When comparing the two, Li Qiye resembled its master more.

Li Qiye sighed and stopped reminiscing. He stared forward and said: “Heavenhoof Ravine.”

“You know about this too?!” Resplendent’s astonishment grew since he knew all of their secrets.

“Don’t be surprised, even your progenitor can’t control this array as well as I.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“...” Resplendent retorted, albeit in a feeble tone: “Our progenitor, Peerless Monarch, was a true mastermind. She could scheme and control an entire era. Though she wasn’t an emperor, she was inferior to none. She created this array and managed to stop the horde by herself from invading Imperial Attendant.”

“Your progenitor was amazing indeed, a true master of controlling worldly momentum and auras.” Li Qiye said: “But no one can control the momentum of the nine worlds better than me.”

“...” Resplendent didn’t believe this because the progenitor was the one who created this array.

While they were doubting Li Qiye’s comment, he flew into the air.

“Rumble!” Lightning bolts as thick as mountain ranges struck him.

However, their intention was not to kill him but rather empower him. He exuded the lightning affinity and illuminated the nine worlds like a god of lighting. Its power became his for the taking.

The earth veins in the nine worlds answered his summon and released their colorful rays as well.

“Boom!” The various momentums also gathered around him. Laws belonging to the nine worlds alone gave him endless potential.

Now, his smash wielded the power of an entire epoch, enough to obliterate anyone.

As he raised his foot, the first to kneel was Saintess Shao Yao. Next was Gourdkeeper Monarch who lost control of his body.

“Raa!” True Bear wanted to test himself against the power of the nine worlds.

He became gigantic and pushed the momentum upward. Alas, he only lasted a second before being pushed to the ground as well.

Resplendent Monarch roared and gathered all of his energy. A yin-yang radiance emerged as a barrier.

Unfortunately, he still didn’t last long in spite of possessing ten sacred fruits. “Bam!” His knees touched the ground.

The strongest was none other than the old servant. He stood upright, capable of shouldering the entire heaven.

His cultivation was shocking but as Li Qiye slowly pressed his foot down, the ultimate power of the entire nine worlds pushed down on him.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Li Qiye became a part of the nine worlds and was in total control.

“Bam!” Finally, the servant was suppressed just like the others.

“Young Noble, please recall your power!” Gourdkeeper could no longer handle the pressure.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye gazed down at the nine worlds while still feeling sentimental.

“Boom!” He dispersed the momentum back to the array.
