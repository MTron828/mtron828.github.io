Chapter 5793: Three Thousand Worlds’ Collapse

“Zzz...” A bright liquid flowed throughout the mech and mended the mech’s arms as if nothing had happened.

“In the end, I’m not the epoch lord and it’s not my epoch either.” Jiao Heng reflected while healing the mech.

He had a difficult time harnessing the mech’s true power, not its ultimate blow either. The main issue was not being from Machine Epoch.

“Just need to not be a mortal, then you don’t need the mech either.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s no fun, Sacred Teacher. The joy is in the search.” Jiao Heng shook his head.

“Then feel free to keep trying, let’s see how much power you can exert out of it.” Li Qiye gestured with his hand again.

“Yes, I’ll keep it interesting, I found another thing this mech can do.” Jiao Heng smiled.

“Use it then.” Li Qiye said.

“Very well!” Jiao Heng laughed and the mech’s radiance illuminated and subjugated three thousand worlds.

This only lasted for a split second before everything extinguished and turned into scattering particles. The radiance became weaker, on the verge of disappearing.

During this strange process, particles traveled to the far reaches while the mech seemed to be losing its power and deflated like a balloon, turning from a giant into a tiny seed.

“What’s going on?” An emperor became confused.

“No, the mech isn’t shrinking.” Sword and others of his level understood what was going on: “It’s at the center of three thousand worlds.”

Fan Chen and his allies also noticed this.

“We’re just not in there.” World murmured.

Space and time had changed around Li Qiye and the mech with the spread of the particles. The mech wasn’t growing smaller but the space around it became infinitely large. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Thus, spectators outside the domain incorrectly saw the mech changing in size.

“Collapse!” Jiao Heng roared and a world descended for Li Qiye.

It had thousands and thousands of islands, dozens of continents, and countless stars. Towering trees could be seen - the lords of this world. They breathed in and out pure energy - culminating in a pure aura used against Li Qiye.

“Bam!” The impact destroyed everything below.

“Boom!” A different world engulfed in flames descended next. It had millions of suns and fire giants. It slammed against the first world and ignited the trees, causing devastating explosions.

“Boom!” A third world inhabited by various divine beasts came afterward - roaring dragons, soaring phoenixes, great serpents spewing miasma...

Explosions never stopped as one primal world came after another - a total of three thousand worlds aiming to destroy everything within the special domain.

Affinities including time and space were obliterated, leaving the target no room to hide or even breathe.

Spectators understood they had no chance of survival if they had been in the domain.
