Chapter 5589: Replacement

“Boom!” Momentous Frontier resonated with the light. Dao lines appeared everywhere and were arranged in inscrutable patterns.

Runes were eventually formed. Each was unique and profound, brimming with chaos true energy.

The region was engulfed in energy and the runes continued to proliferate and multiply. A supreme chapter could be seen and turned into a barrier above Momentous Frontier.

It served as the strongest defense and contained all possible affinities. It became one with the land and looked to be boundless.

Figures appeared in this ocean of runes - seemingly walking from the past to the future… They resembled giants on the river of time.

As long as they were around, nothing would be able to take down Momentous Frontier.

“Look, our brothers.” Many emperors and monarchs recognized their true identity.

Space Dragon Emperor, Ox-dragon Ancestor, Immortal Emperor Di Yu, Immortal Emperor Bu Si, Bones Dao Lord…

These deities were more than happy to live within this supreme chapter together with countless mortals.

“They’re amazing.” Everyone, regardless of their background and stance, admired the deities.

Putting emperors and monarchs aside, cultivators with the tiniest achievements still looked down on mortals, viewing them as moths with little lifespan.

An average cultivator had a lifespan of up to ten thousand years while a mortal could only last up to a century at best - nothing more than the blink of an eye from an emperor.

The gap between the two sides was insurmountable. Cultivators didn’t want to mingle with mortals, let alone be tied up with them through a supreme chapter.

It took extraordinary willpower and determination to become deities of Momentous Dao, abandoning personal freedom and desires.

“Boom!” Li Qiye raised his hand and a tablet flew up to the sky. As it floated in midair, it looked immovable and unchanging. Time did not affect the tablet.

“Momentous Tablet!” Only the top cultivators recognized this artifact.

Those who had befriended Space Dragon Emperor and the others were aware of Momentous Frontier’s mysteries and the tablet’s importance.

The runes on the tablet exuded eternal rays, looking like floating lamps. They were the saviors during the dark, delivering living beings toward salvation.

“Rumble!” The runes evolved and harmonized, serving as the core. All the grand dao and powers from Momentous Frontier originated from this tablet, maintaining a perfect connection.

“Boom!” Suddenly, Li Qiye pressed downward and the tablet started crumbling. Little pieces fell off and turned into dust.

The supreme chapter became unstable, seemingly losing its source.

“What is going on?!” This scared the hell out of spectators. Wouldn’t this destroy Momentous Frontier?

Without the tablet serving as the source, the laws and runes will become unstable and disperse into nothingness.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Clank!” With one hand, Li Qiye stabilized the supreme grand dao. He threw the throwing star into the location of the crumbling tablet.

Spectators watched with bated breath. The dao of the tablet contained immense power and mysteries. Just one mistake would result in a devastating explosion.

Nonetheless, Li Qiye maintained stability while embedding the throwing star into the system. This process didn’t have the slightest error or tremor. Li Qiye displayed an unparalleled level of steadiness.

The runes began latching onto the throwing star like vines. The weapon was integrated into the supreme chapter through Li Qiye’s manipulation.

“He’s replacing the tablet with the weapon.” Everyone understood his intention at this point.

Although replacing the source was theoretically simple, just the slightest instability could have spread throughout the system and led to the total collapse of the supreme chapter.
