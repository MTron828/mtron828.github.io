The end of the bridge stopped in front of Li Qiye, clearly welcoming him to board.

“It’s the three immortals!” One progenitor said.

The existence of the three immortals wasn’t a secret for the top masters at the expanse, contrary to the view back in Three Immortals.

After entering the expanse, these progenitors found out about the three immortals. They were the earliest pioneers, the greatest sages, and the strongest cultivators.

For millions of years, these three were viewed as the apex of cultivation.

The progenitors knew that peace was possible due to these three guardians. They have been guarding this world all this time.

During the earliest era, some came to the expanse and were lucky enough to receive their guidance. This allowed them to become top progenitors.

They also took charge during the dark war. Their leadership kept the expanse free from total corruption.

Later on, they stopped showing up for some unknown reasons. Bao Pu, Zither Empress, Fire Ancestor, and Gao Yang - these brilliant progenitors took over.

They were certainly amazing but without characters like the three immortals to stop the darkness, many progenitors started falling.

The trio was still gone after several cruel battles. This made people question whether they were still around. Some thought that the dark existence had killed them.

This speculation was reasonable because during the later battles, Zither Empress’ group barely held on, losing fights after fights.

Thus, this bridge came as a surprise for many among the crowd.

“The three immortals are still alive, maybe they’re at the other shore.” One master murmured.

“This is great news for Three Immortals.” One progenitor commented.

The ones here knew that the first line of defense for Three Immortals was actually the expanse, not the sky moat. Some of them stuck around, serving as defenders.

Though Li Qiye had swept away the darkness today, who knows if another danger would come to this unknown land?

They would be the first to face the next wave of disaster, shouldering the responsibility of protecting Three Immortals. That’s why they felt so relieved to know that the trio was still alive. Three Immortals always had hope regardless of the calamity with the trio around.

The name of their world originated from the protection of the trio. Without them, this world might be completely different right now.

Li Qiye smiled and stepped on the bridge to head towards the other side. As he moved along, the section behind him gradually disappeared.

“Sir is going to see the three immortals.” One progenitor said.

This invitation came as no surprise. Plus, Li Qiye was strong enough to go see the three immortals regardless of being invited or otherwise. He was certainly qualified to meet them.

Remember, weaker cultivators relative to him have met the three before. For example, Zither Empress and her peers.

“So there will be four immortals now? Our world will be Four Immortals from now on if they stay together?” One master started fantasizing with a smile.

The majority thought that nothing would be better if Li Qiye were to stay at the expanse. They would no longer need to worry about any threat.

“I hope so, our world will be at the top, completely peerless versus the others.” An optimistic progenitor answered.

“No, Sir won’t be around.” One who had talked to Li Qiye before knew his goal.

“He’s only a passerby, nothing in our world can make him stay. He has done enough for us anyway.” Another sighed and added.

The group familiar with Li Qiye didn’t say anything. They naturally wanted him to stay but no one could persuade him anyway.

The bridge crossed through space and took Li Qiye along. He eventually made it to the other end of the expanse in no time at all. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A person stood at the end of the bridge, waiting for Li Qiye. He wore a cotton robe along with a winter hat, nearly hiding his entire face.

Li Qiye was no stranger to this man. They have met several times back in Three Immortals.

This time was a little different. The old man had a pulsing green glow brimming with life force. The area around him felt like spring - the perfect time to sow some seeds. His life force seemed enough to create three thousand worlds.

In the case of everything dying and drying out in Three Immortals, his life force was enough to save them all.

“Excuse me for the late reception, Dao Brother.” The old man bowed respectfully.

“You’re deliberately late.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m sure you’re happy about the outcome. Our interference would have ruined your plan, we would be inners then.” The old man said.

“You’re good at running from your responsibility and letting someone else clean up the mess. Did this happen a lot during your expedition too? Tricking the villainous heaven up and down.” Li Qiye joked.

“That past is not worth mentioning, we were just struggling and didn’t accomplish much, unlike you who keeps on fighting back, Dao Brother.” The old man shook his head.

“It’s just small-scale stuff so far, not really fighting directly. There’ll be a chance for that later.” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man nodded. He believed that Li Qiye would be able to put up a monstrous fight - a battle for the ages.

“I am Emperor Nong.” The old man bowed again for an introduction. [1]

Li Qiye smiled. This was within his expectation.

“I’ve heard good things about your Nine-pistil Golden Grain, that it’s the best in history.” Li Qiye chuckled.

The bull had bragged about eating this grain before but not a single soul believed it. Why? Because according to the legends, these grains belonged to Emperor Nong, one of the three immortals. Those back in that world thought that these beings were myths or even fabrications.

“Just child’s play, nothing impressive, can’t enter your sight.” The emperor shook his head.

“Of course, it’s not what I want.” Li Qiye let out a wide grin: “I want way more, obviously.”

“Mmm...” The emperor let out an awkward smile, aware that Li Qiye was about to bleed them dry.

“You’re already a true immortal now. Our crappy possessions can’t enter your sight.” He said.
