“Rumble!” Even when the beasts were quite far from the city, a storm of dust formed due to their massive number.

“Oh lord...” The crowd realized how horrifying this was and quickly left the main path, afraid of being drawn in.

As the tide grew closer, people finally saw them clearly. In fact, they weren’t different from other beasts, relatively similar in appearance. Some had strange and unfamiliar forms, but they were fewer in number.

One impertinent bull was entirely red, around three meters long. It ran like crazy and left behind four large hoof marks. Another one resembled a snow leopard - not as impressive in size but it was as fast as lightning, leading at the front. Mist and frost formed on its path. One more looked like a monkey and rode a beast. Its mount followed all of the orders...

The diversity of beasts astonished the crowd. However, they all had one similar characteristic - a particular rune on their head. The mark was a golden coin - hence their name, coinbeast.

The colossal ones were unbelievably strong. An ape taller than the highest mountain traveled a thousand miles with each step, leaving gigantic footprints behind. Geographic barriers didn’t deter it at all.

The real victims were the other beasts, trampled and crushed into mincemeat. Nevertheless, the horde continued on its path.

Another lightning-fast serpent stretched for a thousand miles and easily decimated a hill with its tongue. It destroyed peaks and trees just like the large ape, leaving a long scar on the ground.

“Rumble!” The world was seemingly rocked by a major disaster.

“We’re too close!” The cultivators who chose the nearest peak to the main path faced the most pressure. Some got overran instantly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Ah!” Their screamings stopped after their body became pieces.

Some were fast enough to jump to the sky but unfortunately, large birds flew by and dismembered them, resulting in an explosion of blood.

A few lucky ones have prepared their coins. The front-running beasts opened their mouth and took in these coins. After seeing this, the cultivators jumped on the beasts and made their way towards the city.

Misfortune tagged along with luck, so after getting on the beasts, the sky suddenly turned dark. They looked up and the bottom of a massive foot became the last thing they saw before death.

Their mounts were affected too, but some were resilient enough to get back up and moved on, despite the fleshy mess on their back.

“It’s a good thing we weren’t that close.” The cultivators standing far away celebrated. Not being able to take the good spots earlier became a good thing.

A few beasts wandered away from the main path and ate coins a bit farther away. The owners of the coins naturally jumped and rode the beasts.

Another group wanted to ride without paying, so after seeing the ones they like, they immediately rushed forward and tried to get on top.

“Boom!” The beasts didn’t hold back at all and rocked back and forth until they got these people off. The majority of these non-payers died to the incoming waves.

This was a lesson to the spectators so no one else tried to be stingy.

“Rawr!” The howls of the beasts were truly shocking.

Strange enough, the gate of the city might be incredible in size, but it wasn’t as big as the horde. Some beasts were countless times larger by themselves. However, when they made it to the gate, they shrank right away - like a planet turning into a pebble.

This wasn’t a physical change, but rather, they were stepping into a different and limitless dimension.

“Boom!” The large ape mentioned earlier opened its mouth and sucked in Coiling Dragon’s imperial coins from the distance. It then shouted at the young noble.

No doubt that it was willing to be Coiling Dragon’s mount. The man became excited and leaped over, landing on the ape’s shoulder and looking just like a tiny dot in comparison to the creature.

The other colossal serpent coiled around a mountain and pulverized it without any problem. It swallowed Sword Sovereign’s coins, so he jumped on its back without any hesitation.

The other beasts were aware of these two’s might so they stay far away, not wanting to be crushed.

Right before the ape and serpent were about to start again, a detonation in the ocean created a tsunami of unprecedented size.

A beast jumped out of the expanse and braved the waves.

“Bam!” The very next second, all the beasts stopped like braking carriages.

The explosion earlier nearly ruptured everyone’s eardrums and the world became strangely quiet. Before they could react, the horde of beasts got down on the ground. Even the large ape and serpent didn’t dare to get up.

This sudden change naturally shocked everyone. They quickly looked towards the ocean and noticed the incoming beast.

It had the body of an ox with just a single leg, one horn on its head. One could hear the thunder crackles accompanying it along with surging lightning currents flowing around.

Despite possessing only one leg, it wasn’t hopping. Each step was stable, fast, and even soundless.

It was much smaller in size compared to that ape and didn’t emit a frightening presence. However, one could sense a matchless aura, though the beast didn’t try to be imperious and threatening. This aura was simply flowing within its very flesh and blood. This meant that the thing was born to be supreme, possessing the strongest of bloodlines!
