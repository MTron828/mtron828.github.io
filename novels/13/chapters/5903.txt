Chapter 5903: Be Patient

The cloud took its time thinking about its future. After all, despite its long life, it saw a new beginning after meeting Li Qiye.

“Heavenrealm is the right choice. Perhaps changes are coming, an entirely new chapter.” Li Qiye said.

The cloud remained skeptical.

“You don’t believe me?” Li Qiye smiled and got the same reaction again - the cloud telling him to read the room.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Believe in me because when I initiate the battle, a curtain will be drawn for a new chapter.” Li Qiye shook his head and said.

The cloud once again scanned the area above.

“I know what you want but it’s all just starting. Although the villainous heaven is forever unchanging and indestructible, it’s the right time for a new chapter.” Li Qiye smiled.

It looked back down at Li Qiye.

“Trust.” Li Qiye said: “This will be a battle to the very end, I will get an answer. Yes, you have cause for concern, that I’ll be replacing it, the same idea as many other old men. This is reasonable, the outcome will be the same as before and the cycle continues.”

He sighed and said: “Listen, I have no interest in becoming the villainous heaven or an immortal with eternal life.”

The cloud thought that whoever wanted to fight the final battle did so to replace the high heaven - to ascend to immortality.

“Immortality is meaningless. As I’ve said, it reduces everything to nothingness with time.” He continued: “I know what you want to ask, what will happen if I manage to do it?”

The cloud stared at him, wishing to understand him.

Li Qiye stared at the sky silently for a moment before patting the cloud and answering: “I started as a mortal. Everything I did in life was to show my fangs. When it is over, I let go of all shackles and responsibilities to live idly.”

The cloud was surprised to hear this. It had heard grand speeches before but this one caught it off guard.

He let out a long sigh after stating his purpose. He had done what he needed to do for Eight Desolaces and the six continents. He no longer worried about this world and believed his departure was for its betterment.

Beautiful memories remained but they no longer served as shackles. Therefore, the departure became a perfect ending to his story in this world.

This was the perfect time. What should be forgotten will be forgotten, and what should be remembered shall stay sealed in his heart. Unfortunately, the journey was far from over.

“True immortality, a true tragedy. Will everything change then?” He said sentimentally.

The cloud didn’t react this time and respectfully gave him room to reflect.

“Be careful when you get there.” Li Qiye smiled: “There are many monsters there. You may meet Geezer Tribunal if he is still alive.”

“When I met him back then, he was indeed perfect. Of course, there are great flaws hidden behind perfection. For example, when the whole world is shrouded in light, it is only a hair’s breadth away from darkness. I do have to admit, Tribunal is only one tiny step away and inspires admiration upon sight.” He continued.

“The other geezers are questionable but Tribunal is alright. His goal is to be the scale of justice, but how can one weigh everything in the world? The hearts of the people cannot be judged in this manner. This is the biggest flaw of his way. He had such a good chance back then but this little gap alone was fatal.” He lamented.

“A few places are safe.” He suggested: “We built Crimsonheaven’s place into a fortress so as long as the brats have been doing a good job defending it, you should head there.”

The cloud believed Li Qiye but too much time had passed.

“It’s true, I no longer know if these places are still around, especially after this sweep.” He admitted: “Some of the monsters back then are probably dead since they were used as pawns, it’s not time for the direct confrontation yet.”

The cloud seemed interested in Crimsonheaven.

“I told Min Ren to be patient and lay low, that’s all he had to do.” He smiled before looking up: “Unfortunately, I know him too well, that’s not his personality. He’ll stand up for his belief during the sweep. Others might call him righteous and foolish, but it’s hard to hate this foolish boy.”

The cloud didn’t respond.

“Okay, it’s a deal then. You can run if it looks bad.” Li Qiye rubbed its head like a puppy: “Some of the geezers might be dead by then so you can explore a bit, not only to see this world but maybe you’ll come across what you’re looking for.”

The cloud nodded, making up its mind about moving forward.
