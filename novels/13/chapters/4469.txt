Chapter 4470: Dao Stones

The Tree of Contribution remained standing despite its withered state. Li Qiye glanced at it and said: “It’s not due to the lack of supreme ancestor. Its decline is due to your own clans.”

“Well…” The group didn’t have a response.

“I think that is recorded in our history book.” Wise Ancestor eventually said: “The ancestors took out the dao stones.”

“Is that what you’re referring to, Young Noble?” Jian Ming said: “The records are lacking down. It simply states that after a full deliberation of the four clans, we decided to take the dao stones for the sake of the descendants.”

“That’s putting it nicely.” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “They worried that their descendants would be useless and incapable of protecting it. In order to avoid greed and clan destruction, they took away the dao stones. With them gone, the tree withered right away. Nonetheless, it’s still holding on.”

“So you think that if we put the dao stones back, the tree will be fine again?” Wise Ancestor became excited.

“Your recent ancient ancestors probably weren’t stupid and have tried this before.” Li Qiye commented.

Jian Ming knew more about this subject and said: “That is indeed the case. The dao stones alone can’t revive the tree. The ancestors debated this and believed that one must enter the dao source and re-create the grand dao using primordial energy.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“This is the reason why we were looking for someone like you, Young Noble.” Wise Ancestor smiled wryly.

“Is that so? You got lucky like a blind cat coming across a dead mouse. If it was so easy, your ancient ancestors would have done them long ago.” Li Qiye said.

The reason for reviving the tree was due to its nature as a dao source. Its existence allowed the clan members to cultivate far faster.

Nonetheless, their older ancestors believed that withering the tree was necessary for survival.

Such a divine tree was coveted. During the prosperous generations, too many powerful cultivators appeared so the risk was high.

Recently, the current ancestors found this unacceptable and wanted to revive the tree. Unfortunately, adding the dao stones again didn’t work.

They kept on researching this issue and believed that one has to go straight to the dao source and stimulate it once more. They have attempted countless times to no avail, hence the need to find the ancient ancestors.

“We are too weak so attempting the Primordial Union is meaningless. I’m sure you, on the other hand, will be able to trace back to the source.” Wise Ancestor continued. [1]

“Even if I’m interested in participating in this union, it is useless without the four dao stones.” Li Qiye said while staring at the four missing holes.

“Each clan has one, and I actually have the one from the Wu with me.” Wise Ancestor took a deep breath and revealed.

“Coincidentally, I have the one from the Jian.” Jian Ming searched his sack for a bit and took out a dao stone: “Here you go, Young Noble. This is the dao stone.”

He held the radiant stone with both hands. It had a blue color just like the sky, looking like a piece of jade. Inside its azure hue were many dao runes in the shape of clouds.

They gathered and dispersed - a process that one could construe as the breaths of the world.

“You were keeping this stone?” Wise Ancestor found this surprising.

Though the dao stones didn’t have any effect alone, the four clans knew how important they were and kept them safe.

Who would expect for the Jian to let a youth keep it? It showed how much trust the ancestors of the Jian placed in him. This was truly surprising.

“I think the ancestors are starting to be senile from old age, that’s why they gave it to me.” Jian Ming joked.

Wise Ancestor didn’t waste time and took out their clan’s dao stone. He presented it to Li Qiye with both hands and said: “Young Noble, here is the stone of the Wu.”

It was different from the Jian’s stone. It was transparent with runic fire within. The fiery strings resembled a sky-searing inferno. The thing looked hot but was rather cool to the touch.

“We will gather the four stones for you, Young Noble.” Wise Ancestor said confidently.

“I”m sure you will be able to obtain the union, Young Noble. After all, no one else can match you.” Jian Ming was excited as well.

“Don’t be so blatant with your flattery.” Li Qiye chuckled: “If your four clans want to revive this tree, go gather the other two stones.”

He paused for a bit before concluding: “Fate has brought me here today, so I shall do what should be done.”

“Thank you, Young Noble!” The two prostrated.

“We will go get the other stones now.” Wise Ancestor wasn’t one to waste time and discussed this with Jian Ming.

“The Tie should be easy.” The youth said: “But I don’t know if the Lu still has theirs…”

He became worried after thinking about this potential problem.

“Hmm, the Lu…” Wise Ancestor hesitated as well. The Lu’s decline was faster than the rest and it has been rather distant lately.

“Start with the Tie first then worry later.” Jian Ming said decisively.

“I’ll go visit the geezer, we’re friends so it should be easy to get their dao stone.” Wise Ancestor nodded in agreement.

Speak of the devil - an old voice interrupted them: “Old Wise, I heard you managed to find an ancient ancestor. Why didn’t you let me know first?”

A group wearing tight black robe appeared. They stood proudly with their back straight, looking like javelins. They were up there in age yet still had ample vitality and spirit.

“The Tie is here just in time.” Jian Ming greeted them: “Hehe, Purpose Ancestor, I was worried about how to invite everyone here…” He kept on going.

“Brat, you must be up to no good to be blabbering like this.” Purpose Ancestor was from the Tie, being in the same generation as Wise Ancestor.

“Of course not, Wise Ancestor is here as well. Are you here to greet the ancient ancestor? Such perfect timing.” Jian Ming said with a sincere tone.

1. This used to be Primordial Conference, it is changed to Union. The character, 会, just had too many meanings and conference was the best choice given the context. These were the potential meanings - can (i.e. have the skill, know how to) / likely to / sure to / to meet / to get together / meeting / gathering / union / group / association / a moment. Choosing union since it has the original vague meaning but also a union between a cultivator and the dao. Seems like the better choice; enlightenment was another one even though it diverged from the original character. ?
