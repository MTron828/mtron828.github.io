Chapter 5637: You Again


A peculiar flower resembling a dendrobium orchid grew on top of the reef. It had leaves and branches with a light yellow hue, almost like bamboo joints. This tint seemed to be the result of its age, having been polished by countless years and losing its emerald color.

It looked remarkably hard. Even the delicate twigs and slender branches seemingly carried considerable weight like iron.

It bloomed magnificently to the size of a hand. The pure petals were whiter than snow while the pistil remained unstained by the mortal world.

They nurtured infinite life like three thousand worlds. The cluster was surrounded by a fiery swirl - a symbol of the mortal coil.

The flower also emitted successive light rings. They spun endlessly and in different directions. Each represented a cycle of existence in a constant state of change. 

The light rings prevented the blood bolts and other malicious entities in the ocean from getting close to the reef.

Nonetheless, they didn’t prevent two top masters from being there for a fight. The ocean was churning from the shockwaves. Their imperial powers would reduce anyone to blood and make the stars lose their brilliance.

Man versus woman; young versus old. Each possessed their own supreme grand dao. Laws descended like heavenly waterfalls. Heaven’s Wills and dao fruits exerted their true power.

A monstrous vine could be seen from a distance. The leaves were yellow and dried but remained attached to the branches instead of being blown away by a gust. The barks on the vine resemble iron scales.

“Poof!” The entire vine was on fire while an old man stood on top. His aura differed from the vine’s, resembling an ancient forest brimming with life force.

Twelve Heaven’s Wills floated above him and were strengthened with anima.

His opponent looked rather young, only around sixteen, and extraordinarily beautiful. Her skin was porcelain and soft. Her eyebrows are like distant mountains, verdant and dark. Her eyes seemed to be where all spirit energies gathered.

She wore a palace dress, looking noble and dignified like someone who had stepped out of an ancient painting.

Her awe-inspiring aura allowed her to dominate the firmaments as a supreme god-king. The divine laws of the world obeyed her whims.

Twelve dao fruits floated above her and poured down pillars of chaos true energy. Each strand suffocated anyone nearby.

A thousand hands could be seen behind her in a blinding radiance. They formed different mudras, causing deafening detonations.

They paused their battle after noticing Sindragon and Li Qiye, not knowing whether they were friends or foes.

They had fought for so long now and were evenly matched. A third party would certainly decide the outcome.

Li Qiye landed on the reef, unaffected by their tempestuous forces as if they were mere breezes only capable of blowing his sleeves.

“Boom!” He raised his hand and all of their powers disappeared, causing them to stagger backward in astonishment.

The old Immortal Emperor’s eyes erupted with a scorching heat, wanting to attack Li Qiye. However, the moment he got a good look at Li Qiye’s face, he turned pale and stopped immediately.

His first reaction was to run for his life after meeting the most terrifying being in the world. Running was the only option.

However, his legs were frozen once Li Qiye’s gaze fixed on him. They no longer listened to his command.

“Is competing for treasures with a junior the new modern trend?” Li Qiye asked.

The old man prostrated on the ground and said: “Sacred Teacher, please forgive Bai Lian’s insolence.”

He was a familiar face - a tree that reached the dao from the nine worlds. He survived an encounter with Li Qiye by running for his life. Now, he no longer had the same courage as back then, unable to even run.

“An acquaintance needs not to be afraid.” Li Qiye always enjoyed meeting those from the previous epoch and waved his hand.

The Immortal Emperor feared no one at this point. After all, no Immortal Emperors were cowards considering the brutal competition for the Heavens’ Will.

However, Li Qiye was a different story. Bai Lian knew the legend too well and didn’t want to be crushed like an ant after a futile battle.

Running wasn’t possible this time so it was best to abandon pride and kneel before an overlord. This wasn’t embarrassing because he was far from being the first one to kneel before Li Qiye.

“You have improved, obtaining twelve wills and finding anima.” Li Qiye smiled.

Bai Lian smiled awkwardly and said: “I lived a borrowed life, not daring to be arrogant. Due to my meager alchemy skill, I was able to live a bit longer until I was lucky enough to step into the entrance.”

He was being overly humble. His alchemy ability had few peers in this world.

“Obtaining twelve wills can be attributed to luck, but not finding anima. You are qualified to search for the dao.” Li Qiye smiled.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You’re too kind, Sacred Teacher.” Bai Lian was rather proud of his achievement. 

He was not considered the most gifted emperor in terms of cultivation and comprehension. However, he worked hard and preserved long enough to reach anima - a task that many others have failed.

“Go, live well, it’s not easy to make it this far.” Li Qiye said, not intending to make it difficult for the old man.
