Chapter 5024: Surrounded By Heroes

As a five-fruit dragon conqueror, he was somehow the weakest among the bunch. Moreover, everyone knew that he was spewing nonsense just like before.

“Well said, I do enjoy how you shamelessly assume the role of justice without turning red at all. Truly a prestigious cultivator from a famous sect.” Li Qiye clapped while laughing.

“No need to waste words when it comes to subduing evil. Everyone wishes to slay you for a reason.” The old man turned slightly red before looking around: “Who wishes to carry out justice today?!”

“The venerable is right, a villain shouldn’t possess such a powerful treasure!” Many experts shouted.

“No need for all of this!” Demons, on the other hand, weren’t used to needing justifications and rhetorics.

“Hand the god source over and we will spare you!” One of them roared.

“We demons shall fight on the side of justice too!” Some demons started being interested in obtaining the moral high ground before fighting.

The feeling of robbing while acting all righteous was new to the demons. No wonder why the orthodox sects could last for so long. Some thought that they should definitely learn how to do this.

Tendril King sighed while watching this. She moved to the side, wanting no part in this.

“Hahaha, I might be ranked first or whatever in that monster list but I can’t even come close to your level of shamelessness.” Wild Dragon laughed and said.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Swordgrasp Venerable and Jun Cuican turned red. Alas, the arrow has been shot and there was no turning back.

“Boom!” Wild Dragon walked forward and released his draconic aura: “Justice or dog-eat-dog world, whatever, neither has anything to do with me. I will always do what I want and today, that is robbing your god source, brat.”

“Anyone else?” Li Qiye stared at the crowd and said: “There’s no need for a reason, it can be anything since I have free time right now to entertain all of you. Don’t miss this opportunity.”

Skystomper snorted and wanted to kill Li Qiye in order to avenge Halo Monarch and his son. The two wheels above him released chilling murderous intent.

However, Golden Cicada pulled his sleeve and stopped him from joining the battle. There seemed to be an agreement between the two.

“I don’t care for the god source.” Radiant Monarch spoke. He resembled a god of light that made everyone breathless with his majestic existence.

Even without taking action, his radiance has already illuminated everything. Under its holy influence, cultivators would turn weak before even engaging in battle, and they couldn’t help but feel ashamed in comparison. The monarch was someone who could win the battle even before it began.

“I rarely accept inferiority, especially not from someone as arrogant as you, Fellow Daoist. Since you treat us with disrespect and disdain, I have no choice but to change your mind through the use of force.” His voice seemed to be coming from above, commanding admiration and respect.

With that, he stepped forward and said: “Reckless it may be, I will still stand with the others to see your supreme arts. I do not doubt your abilities but they will not deter me.”

Some couldn’t help but give him a thumbs-up. His words were pleasant and appropriate, the same couldn’t be said for Li Qiye’s.

They knew that Swordgrasp and the others only cared about the god source and personal vendetta despite talking about justice. They were too blatant, not actually giving a damn about the optics.

Radiant Monarch, on the other hand, focused on Li Qiye’s contempt while maintaining an air of humility.

“Sounds like you are even more shameless than they are, you have perfected the art of acting righteous. How commendable.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

“Hahaha, all dragon lords yet the difference between Swordgrasp and Radiant is immense.” Wild Dragon laughed.

“Fellow Daoist, will you accept our challenge?” Radiant Monarch said calmly, ignoring the jeers.

“Of course I will, the more enemies, the merrier.” Li Qiye smiled before looking around to ask: “Anyone else?”

No one responded because this was a battle at the dragon lord level. Others weren’t qualified to join.

Guardian Pagoda and Skystomper chose to observe instead of joining the fight. Their allies stood patiently behind them.

“No more wasting time, let’s get started already!” Wild Dragon shouted and leaped into the air, turning back into a fire dragon.

“Good!” Jun Cuican leaped onto another peak.

“Till death.” Swordgrasp Venerable formed a triangular formation with the other two, surrounding Li Qiye.

“I won’t be holding back since you all seem to have a death wish.” Li Qiye smiled and leaped into the air as well.

“Your heroism is commendable, Fellow Daoist.” Radiant Monarch joined the battlefield.

Despite his holy aura and compliment, he chose to stand behind Li Qiye - the perfect spot to stop Li Qiye from escaping or delivering a fatal blow.

His style was completely different from Jun Cuican or Halo Monarch. The latter seemed amateurish and naive in comparison.
