Chapter 4850: Coffin Returning

Chaos had four top lineages - Primal, Hundred Races, Demon, and Maddened.

Primal has declined, Hundred Races maintained neutrality, Demon - always ferocious and lawless, and finally, Maddened was unpredictable. This was the main reason why Chaos became so dangerous.

In fact, it became a safe harbor for villains of all three lower continents. Rumor has it that during the ancient past when Primal was in its golden age, Eternal Conqueror was unstoppable and kept this place safe. Villains had no choice but to live in hiding. Later on, Primal declined and lost control over the land.

How unsafe was Chaos? One example was that a newly-created sect or kingdom could be robbed and destroyed the next day.

In fact, these immoral cultivators even started their own dynasties and sects. For example, Wild Dynasty was one of them.

Eight-stallion Dao Lord tried to get rid of the vermins, attacking the ten mountains of Demon and Wild Dynasty. Eventually, he started his own dynasty and this helped the situation.

No power dared to invade the dynasty when the dao lord was around. They stopped massacring sects and clans as well.

Today, the news of his demise has spread across Chaos. Villains hiding in the mountains of Demon, the ferocious members of Wild Dynasty, and the crazies of Maddened shouted in jubilation. Many wanted to attack and divide Eight-stallion Dynasty right away.

However, the dynasty still had Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God. This stopped them from acting recklessly. Of course, the same couldn’t be said about the coffin on the way back. The corpse of a dao lord was rather precious and beneficial.

This wasn’t to say that everyone living in Chaos preferred having no rules and violence. Weaker cultivators and sects hoped for order. At the very least, their survival would be guaranteed.

Eight-stallion’s reign gave them room to grow in the last millennium. They were saddened by his death and came to pay respect.

As Firerage and the guards escorted the coffin back to the dynasty, they saw man cultivators lining up along the way.

“Your Majesty.” Some paved fresh flowers on the path.

“Your Majesty!” Others got on their knees and crossed their palms on their chest, performing a full rite.

Many were moved to tears. Those who have lived in the previous generation understood how valuable peace was. Now, Chaos would revert back to its original form.

“Your Majesty, be well on your journey. May the light illuminate you.” Experts who have benefited from his favor kowtowed along the path.

Though he didn’t bestow them any treasure or merit law, his very existence saved them from being massacred.

Along the way, Firerage and the guards exercised utmost vigilance. Firerage constantly scanned all four directions.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, sat next to him and looked rather carefree. Firerage insisted that he stays close in order to avoid needless complications.

Firerage viewed Li Qiye as the successor of Eight-stallion. If anything were to happen to Li Qiye, he would be letting His Majesty down.

“One can’t ask for more with the dao.” Li Qiye glanced at the respectful crowd and nodded approvingly: “Be true to oneself and maintain the original intentions for there is only one life. Otherwise, only harm will come to the world.”

Firerage stared at Li Qiye, feeling rather frustrated. He has been trying to talk to Li Qiye this whole way.

Li Qiye was definitely an average vagabond despite the occasional wise remarks. He wondered about the king’s decision.

The group didn’t dare to slow down because they knew villains were targeting them. Eight-stallion had plenty of fans but the opposite was true as well. Many wanted nothing more than to cut him to pieces.

Thus, it was imperative for them to return to Eight-stallion Dynasty. At the very least, their army would be there, the same for Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God.

As they were passing through a particular mountain, black smoke billowed in their direction.

“Enemies!” Firerage became serious and gazed ahead at a mound.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Sure enough, drums could be heard along with roars from up above.

Various demons appeared - tigers and serpents…

“I build this route, if you want to get through, you must pay a toll.” A serpent demon surrounded by miasma said. It had a human head and a serpent body that was as large as a hill.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Scums from Devil Cloud Ridge.” Firerage’s eyes became murderous after seeing the demons.

“Firerage, your dynasty is over. We are no longer under its jurisdiction. Pay the toll or don’t blame us for being merciless.” The serpent demon continued.

“Yes, pay the toll! Leave the coffin behind and we’ll let you pass!” The other demons shouted.

“You’re courting death!” The guards shouted back.

Though the king was no longer alive and Chaos had countless powerful villains, these demons from Devil Cloud would never get to violate his dignity.

“Scram if you want to live.” Firerage activated his fiery aura and uttered coldly.

He was an Immortal Sovereign, far more powerful than these demons. He only viewed their sect as a gathering of scum and ruffians. He alone could annihilate them.

The demons became intimidated. Firerage and these guards were still rather powerful.

“Firerage, don’t be arrogant now! Demon Dao has countless monarchs and gods. If you dare to oppose us, we will come to your dynasty with full force and destroy it!” The serpent demon shrieked.

They were only a minor branch under Demon Dao but still wanted to use its prestige for their own gains.
