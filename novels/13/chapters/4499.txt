Chapter 4500: Slap

Alchemy Child found the daoist’s assessment insulting. He tried to persuade the crowd to drop the issue earlier. Alas, the daoist seemed to be fanning the fire by reminding the big shots here.

Due to the stealthy nature of the crowd, they could outbid and win the grass without suffering any consequence.

“You must be tired of living to spew such untruths.” He uttered coldly with an aggressive expression, aiming for the daoist alone.

“Of course not, a nobody like me wouldn’t dare to compete against True Immortal.” The daoist hid behind Li Qiye.

“Hmph, good.” The youth snorted. At least the guy knew when to give up so this looked good for his reputation.

“Wait, this depends on if our young noble is interested in it or not.” The daoist smiled while standing behind Li Qiye: “Young Noble, this grass might be crucial for True Immortal Young Emperor and his dao in the future. Do you think he should be the one?”

The big shots became interested in the answer. In fact, they thought about this matter when the youth brought it up.

The grass might be pivotal to the young emperor’s dao journey or perhaps some other uses unbeknown to others. A selected few thought about how detrimental it would be if they were to buy the grass instead.

“Right, our young noble has to assess whether he should become the next dao lord or otherwise.” Jian Ming stroked his chin and spoke even more brazenly: “If I remember correctly, True Immortal was sealed by Emperor Ye and stopped having dao lord from then on. What is your opinion on this, Young Noble?”

He spoke as if the next dao lord would need his young noble’s permission first, reminding the crowd once more of how annoying he could be.

Not all were fans of True Immortal, albeit none would be so public about their distaste. Attempting to stop True Immortal from having another dao lord meant a fight to the death.

Their sect has yet to produce a dao lord after Emperor Ye’s invasion. Of course, there was Worldbearer Dao Lord who could arguably be considered one. However, when strictly speaking, Worldbearer was not from the sect.

The details included Worldbearer being the disciple of Skywheel Dao Lord, the actual last dao lord of True Immortal.

He hibernated at a young age for some unknown reason and didn’t come out until many eras later.

Because of the seal, Worldbearer left True Immortal and returned to his original clan - the Sima. He proved his dao later and became a dao lord for his clan.

Nonetheless, some still considered him to be a dao lord of True Immortal. The sect also shared this opinion.

As for the dao lord himself, he refrained from speaking on this issue. Alas, he only ruled the Sima and didn’t return to True Immortal. Thus, adding him to their list of dao lords would be inaccurate.

Therefore, breaking their shameful history was of pivotal importance. True Immortal Young Emperor was the one to shoulder this burden of breaking Emperor Ye’s seal.

All the big shots here knew that True Immortal was willing to do anything to make him the next dao lord. They also hated whenever this dark past was brought up.

Therefore, Alchemy Child’s expression darkened along with his fellow sect members.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t comment.

“Ignorant fool! Do you know the consequence of insulting True Immortal?!” Alchemy Child shouted.

“I’m so afraid…” Jian Ming got what he wanted and hid behind Li Qiye.

Even a fool at this point could tell that Li Qiye was their backer.

Because of this, Alchemy Child turned his focus towards Li Qiye and threatened: “I don’t care which sect you are from, you better disciple your juniors well or disaster will come calling!”

“What kind of disaster?” Li Qiye finally spoke, seemingly amused.

Alchemy Child declared: “Being disrespectful towards True Immortal is a grievous sin. Death is the light punishment, the end of the spectrum being the execution of all seniors in the sect or even clan extermination. Once the young emperor becomes the dao lord, he’ll also seal your sect and prevent all of you from ever entering the reincarnation cycle.”

“If your young emperor is the type to do that over some words, then he is not qualified to become the next dao lord.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Such impudence!” Alchemy Child roared. This comment had crossed the unforgivable line.

True Immortal had absolute confidence in their effort. They would spend all resources and do anything to make the young emperor into the next dao lord. Therefore, any disparaging comment about this issue was seen as ominous or bad luck.

This was especially true for Alchemy Child since his future was predicated on his master’s success. He wanted this more than anyone else so Li Qiye’s transgression was intolerable.

“Say one more word and we’ll exterminate your ten clans!” Alchemy Child lost his cool, acting unbecoming of someone from a prestigious sect.

“Slap him.” Li Qiye ordered without looking at the guy.

“Pop! Pop! Pop!” Wise Ancestor followed the order right away.

Alchemy Child and his fellow sect members tried to stop him but this ancestor was too powerful.

Alchemy Child was slapped repeatedly until his mouth was filled with blood and his cheeks swollen.

A junior like him was not qualified to stand before the ancestors. It’s just that the latter gave True Immortal Young Lord face and left the kid alone. Any of them could have easily taught him a lesson.

Wise might not be a supreme ancestor but this was not a difficult task. The only issue here was offending the young lord and True Immortal.

The crowd didn’t stop Wise from doing this because some of them wanted to do the same thing. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” True Immortal’s members unsheathed their weapons, furious.

“You!” Alchemy Child became livid due to the unprecedented disgrace. He felt a fit of uncontrollable anger overwhelming him as he glared at the group and gritted his teeth.
