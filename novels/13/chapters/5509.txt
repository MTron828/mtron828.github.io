Chapter 5510: No

The crowd clamored at this sight and began gossiping again. They believed that Mu Shaoyun and the goddess were a great match.

Now, this outsider popped up out of nowhere. Of course, they had no ill will toward Li Qiye; some were even happy to see him.

However, they knew nothing about his background, only that both their senior sisters were interested in him.

“Does First Sister like him?” Someone whispered.

“No way, why would First Sister like an outsider?” Her friend whispered back: “This is his first time here, they’ve probably only met recently, it can’t be love or anything.”

“Don’t you know about love at first sight? Maybe that’s what going on here.” Another boldly speculated.

The group then took a closer look at Li Qiye and came up with the same conclusion - ordinary. Any random male disciple from their sect was superior in terms of appearance.

“He doesn’t look special at all. Remember, First Sister is a dragon lord.” The whispering started again.

A six-fruit dragon lord was far from being unbeatable in the immortal continent. Nonetheless, she was still an influential character - a peak that couldn’t be surpassed by the average cultivator.

The one affected the most was none other than Mu Shaoyun since everyone knew about his crush.

Although the goddess was friendly with everyone, she still kept a certain distance. Moreover, others never crossed the line due to her power and status.

However, she seemed particularly enthusiastic and close to Li Qiye - something Shaoyun had never seen before. Thus, he immediately considered Li Qiye as a love rival.

“What does it look like then?” Li Qiye smiled, seemingly having a good time while being surrounded by two beauties.

“Young Noble, shouldn’t you offer us some tea first?” The goddess said before glancing at the pot.

“No.” He answered directly.

“Junior Sister, I’ll brew you a pot if you wish to drink.” Shaoyun offered with a smile.

“Thank you, Senior Brother, but it’s quite alright.” She shook her head, clearly not interested.

She then peeled some boiled peanuts and fed Li Qiye who was happy to oblige. This caused another commotion among spectators as if a bomb had just detonated.

Even a fool could see that their relationship was special. Peanuts were a simple snack in the mortal world. However, they were rather significant since she was the one feeding him.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Didn’t I tell you, she likes him.” The female disciple from before said excitedly.

They had no prejudice against the outsider. In fact, this might become a beautiful romance akin to a princess loving a poor scholar. The tale of this would spread throughout the valley.

“How did she meet him?” Another found this surprising because their First Sister had never left the valley before.

“I told you, it has to be love at first sight since she’s a sensitive soul.” A different disciple said.

“Are they going to get together? No way, right?” One more whispered.

“Why not? It’s not like we can’t marry outsiders, it happened all the time in the past.” Someone said, preferring to witness a potential romantic tale.

“It’s different, First Sister might become the valley lord, our successor.” A relatively older disciple shook her head.

“Abandoning ambition for love.” One girl’s eyes lit up and said: “She’ll drop her status and will leave with him, becoming a virtuous wife and mother instead.”

“That should not happen.” The older disciple responded.

The girl overwhelmed with excitement glared at her and said: “Why not? Even if First Sister leaves, we still have Senior Sister Qin, our valley will be just fine. First Sister is so pretty and full of life, she deserves happiness.”

Although they had no idea bout Li Qiye’s background, a few pure-hearted girls were already fantasizing about the romance.

They even thought about the future - how many children would Li Qiye and First Sister have together? What would their names be? Would this family return to the sect later and recognize their heritage?

On the contrary, Mu Shaoyun’s face became increasingly ugly. He had always thought that they were meant to be despite not spending enough time together. After all, he was the most qualified candidate in the valley.
