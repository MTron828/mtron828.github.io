“You will get your chance, but not right now.” Shaochen laughed and continued to retreat with an awkward expression, bereft of the previous imperious attitude.

Li Qiye broke his expectation. Though he knew that guy was very strong and in his calculation, he pushed the guy to the very limit, but he realized that he had still underestimated this foe.

Ultimately, he was certain of his victory and that killing this guy wasn’t going to be hard. Now, he needed to revise his plans since many plans have become useless.

“If you don’t have a Paragon Artifact, you will die. An ancestral weapon is not enough.” Li Qiye chuckled.

The crowd couldn’t be more immersed in this fight with their heart hanging up high. They didn’t only worry about the outcome but also whether Mu Shaochen had a Paragon Artifact or not.

Everyone guessed that he would have an ancestral weapon. After all, their progenitor was powerful and must have left many artifacts behind. As for a Paragon Artifact, who knows?

Nevertheless, there were still rumors about him possessing one. The crowd couldn’t wait to see the unbelievable power of one.

“Li Qiye, there’s no denying your abilities, but you’re not strong enough to warrant using a Paragon Artifact.” Shaochen replied. Due to his talents and experience with true masters, he quickly composed himself.

Li Qiye answered: “Is that so? What else do you have because with your own power, you won’t be able to block a single move from me. Your talents are good but you didn’t focus on cultivation or you wouldn’t be this weak. Otherwise, you might be strong enough to struggle for a bit against me. Plus, if that was the case, you wouldn’t be down here either.”

“You!” Shaochen turned red and glared angrily at him because he had touched his wounds. His talents were indeed unfathomable to earn mild praise from Li Qiye.

Not to mention Myriad, he was exceptional even in Imperial. Alas, as a member of the Mu, everything came easy to him so he became arrogant and didn’t care about cultivation.

As a result, his cultivation was only considered exceptional, not quite brilliant. If he had actually tried in the past, perhaps he would already be a True Emperor at this point. However, he didn’t care about his personal strength since he believed in defeating enemies using other methods.

Unfortunately, schemes and plans were useless before absolute power. Even his amazing talents couldn’t do anything. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Because of reasons related to this, he left Imperial for Myriad. Otherwise, which genius would actually make this choice? Imperial had more resources available. He came down with predicaments that he didn’t want anyone else to know but Li Qiye was bringing it up.

“Not convinced?” Li Qiye chuckled: “It doesn’t matter, this is only the beginning since you’ll be even more vexed later on for opposing me, resorting to living a borrowed life. The clan and talents you are so proud of are trivial before me.”

Shaochen had a hard time staying calm. Ever since coming to Myriad, even the ancestors here showed nothing but respect towards him. This change of pace left him gritting his teeth.

Li Qiye smiled and continued closer.

“Clank!” The falcon flapped its wings and stopped him with a motion akin to a thousand iron swords fanning out.

This mount was intelligent and mighty; many True Gods have fallen prey to it in the past.

These sword-like feathers sealed Li Qiye’s path, not allowing him to take half a step forward.

“Stop.” The falcon actually spoke, albeit with only moderate clarity.

“Even your master won’t be able to stop me, let alone you.” Li Qiye wasn’t in a hurry.

“Li Qiye, you have crossed the line and deserve death for killing so many people.” The falcon god’s words came from above. He wasn’t here but this didn’t make much of a difference.

“So what?” Li Qiye replied: “Those who block my path will be shown no mercy, killing everyone is still not crossing the line.”

The crowd became astounded. In their mind, anyone with a tiny bit of sense wouldn’t be so haughty but Li Qiye chose against doing so. Despite knowing his contempt for all, there was nothing they could do but smile wryly. He was a man of his words so who would want to die over some imperious rhetoric?

“A fool is fearless.” The falcon god said.

“Enough of this.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve: “Stop hiding up there so I can take care of you and everyone here, then that number one expert in Myriad too.”

The crowd couldn’t believe it. This guy not only threatened to kill Cloudcrossing Falcon God but also Dracoform Martial God?

They stared speechless at him. One ancestor muttered to himself: “He’s crazy, always talking about killing Eternals. Does he think they’re so easily slain? Before killing one, he might find himself dead without a grave.”

“Hmph.” An echoing scowl could be heard, causing the stars to rustle. The previous comment from Li Qiye clearly angered the falcon god.

“Clank!” The falcon began aiming at Li Qiye with its wings.

“Get ready to die!” It threatened.

“You dare to be impudent before me, little bird?” Li Qiye said insipidly.

“I will cut you to a thousand pieces!” After gaining intelligent, it hated being called a bird the most.

It began flapping its wings, shooting out feathers no different from divine swords. The remnant energy turned a mountain into a sieve. The weak cultivators couldn’t escape in time and were filled with holes.

“Watch it!” Many managed to evade.

The rampant sword energies all aimed for Li Qiye, wishing to put an end to him.
