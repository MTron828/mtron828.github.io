Chapter 5265: Is My Last Name Li?

“All of them deserve a beating.” She continued to stare at Li Qiye.

“Why do you hate the Li so much? Was one your lover?” Li Qiye peeled and ate another peanut.

“Pah!” She said with disdain: “I would never fall in love with any of those cowards.”

“Makes sense, sorry for the stupid question.” Li Qiye nodded and said: “This clan must have fallen hard, to be utterly despised by a young lady.”

“You don’t agree that they all deserve a beating?” Her gaze remained fixated on him.

“This is good, another plate.” Li Qiye ordered another plate of soybeans instead of answering.

A plate appeared out of nowhere and Li Qiye paid with another treasure.

He took a sip before staring at the girl to answer: “I don’t understand why you want to beat the Li in particular and not anyone else, like the Lu or whatever.”

She picked up the jar with both hands and finished it before slamming the table: “Another.”

One appeared and she tossed out coins. It didn’t matter the payment amount, they would all disappear into thin air.

She took a big gulp before wiping her mouth and responding: “I heard stories about a cultivator with this last name, extremely arrogant and unreasonable.”

Li Qiye peeled another peanut and blew the skin away. It fluttered like a dancing fairy, looking rather beautiful.

“Arrogant and unreasonable? How so?” He then asked.

“The guy claimed to be the greatest in the world, fiercest or whatever, Prime Immortal Emperor.” She said: “I don’t buy it, which is why I want to beat him up.”

“I see, claiming to be the best, how shameless and vulgar just like a brat. He does deserve a beating.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement.

“Unfortunately, I haven’t met a Li capable of putting up a good fight since my dao debut, just a bunch of weaklings collapsing after the slightest touch, all pathetic.” She drank and said.

“Sigh, forget about it.” He peeled a soybean’s shell and relished the taste: “This is it, the taste is wonderful like a prisoner getting to see the sun again.”

“What?” She glanced strangely at him.

“The pleasant warmth of the sun is comforting, makes you feel alive after being trapped in a dark jail.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sounds like seeking joy amidst misery.” She responded.

“The world is a prison.” Li Qiye was in a good mood while snacking: “It’s just that people don’t know that they’re the prisoners.”

“That’s true, have a drink.” She was surprised by the sudden comment but agreed with it so she offered a toast.

“Thanks, that’s why it’s best to be a turtle nowadays, it’s safer.” Li Qiye raised his bowl.

She finished the jar and asked for another before glancing implicatively at Li Qiye: “You’re making me think that your last name is Li.”

“And if I insist that Li isn’t my last name?” He responded.

“I can beat you until you admit it.” She said.

“Sigh, no peace these days, looks like you’re rather stubborn.” He shook his head.

“Don’t worry, it’s not that bad being a Li.” She said: “Once you’re near death from the beating, just call me Big Sis and I’ll spare you.”

“That’s quite a dilemma. If I call you Big Sis, it’s insulting since it implies that you’re old.” Li Qiye shrugged and calmly responded, peeling and eating another salted peanut.

He enjoyed how it was perfectly seasoned and roasted to a crispy texture.

“Let me elaborate, anyone who is old enough for me to call Big Sister has already turned into a pile of bones. There’s no way to turn back the clock now so by addressing you as such, I’m actually cursing and shortening your lifespan.” Li Qiye joked.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Is that so?” She scoffed and said with disdain.

“Yes, I should be calling a cute girl such as yourself Lil Sister.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re asking for it now. Come, let’s fight.” She said arrogantly.

“No thanks, I am a true gentleman who fights with words, not fists. Trust me, you don’t want to get in a fight with me.” He chuckled and shook his head.

“I’ve been looking for that Li guy to see how arrogant he is, to see if he can handle my beating. Looks like I have to delay that today and teach you a lesson first.” She became annoyed and glared at him.

“Please don’t.” Li Qiye poured a full bowl and came over to hand it to her: “Why fight when we can drink, here.”

She finished the bowl in one go before asking what seems to be an invisible bartender for more.

“Tell me the truth, is your last name Li?” She hiccuped after another full gulp before asking.

“Sigh, I don’t want to be a Li.” Li Qiye said sentimentally.

At this time, a youth with starry eyes and other great features entered the tavern, looking as impressive as can be.

“Oh, he’s a Li.” Li Qiye smirked and pointed at the youth - Li Zhitian.

Li Zhitian was excited to see Li Qiye but didn’t understand the situation.

“Yes, my last name is Li.” Li Zhitian said.

“A Li, I see.” The woman stared at him.

“My name is Li Zhitian, is there anything I can do for you, Miss?” He asked politely.

“You have committed an unforgivable sin, your last name is Li.” Li Qiye laughed while clapping his hands.

“...” Li Zhitian remained confused.

“Little Li, come, let’s have a duel outside.” The woman came over and grabbed him by the collar, nearly lifting him off the ground.

“I…” He didn’t know what he did to be put into this situation: “I’ve never offended you, Miss.”

She casually tossed him to the side, causing him to roll for a bit before stabilizing.

“You’re not qualified to offend me, your fault lies in your last name.” She said.

He trembled after witnessing her chilling gaze - something rather rare given his supreme talent.

“What a great development.” Li Qiye finished his bowl and said: “Miss, teach him a lesson and make him change his last name.”
