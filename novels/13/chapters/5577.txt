Chapter 5578: One Of A Kind

“Buzz.” A blinding blast interrupted everyone from pondering Niu Fen’s true identity.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They looked over and saw that Li Qiye had finished refining the throwing star. The weapon exuded rays as pure as could be. Cracks could no longer be seen on the weapon - it had reached flawlessness once more.

In fact, it didn’t possess this level of perfection even during its prime. It seemed to be one whole piece, born in this manner instead of being created.

It was one with the world regardless of the time and place. As long as the world was around, so would it.

The fundamental improvement also boosted its sharpness. Its rays could decapitate immortals, let alone an actual attack.

Previously, they seemed to be refined from countless stars. No one would dare to look at them out of fear.

Now, they became beautiful and all the little particles could be seen. They floated down gently and brimmed with life. This was an affinity that shouldn’t be present in the mortal world.

Any cultivator could sense the joy of life within the particles - singing songs about how life was worth experiencing and protecting.

“It’s magnificent.” Qin Baifeng couldn’t help but praise.

When she last saw the weapon, she was overwhelmed with fear due to its murderous nature. A dragon lord such as herself was nothing in comparison. Death came knocking just by being near it.

After the refinement, the murderous rays became transcending. The weapon had undergone an immaculate metamorphosis. Li Qiye himself was satisfied with his work while staring at it.

He had refined a pseudo-immortal weapon back in Black Tides. Unfortunately, that weapon’s damage was irreparable and the refinement couldn’t reach this level.

Of course, everyone was fixated on the throwing star as well. Instead of possessing an unbearable suppressive presence, the weapon actually brought joy to spectators.

They even felt a sense of inferiority - that they weren’t worthy; it was meant for immortals alone.

Its supremacy was as clear as day. It would be impossible to find an equal in this world. The strongest weapon of the emperors and gods stood no chance. Even the legendary epoch paragon artifacts paled in comparison.

Thus, greed reared its ugly head in everyone’s heart. Nonetheless, they didn’t make a move because that old demon was only the youth’s servant.

Moreover, the youth refined an immortal weapon. Even if a lucky soul came across this immortal weapon by chance, they didn’t have the ability for modification.

Most importantly, he was in control of the weapon - clearly capable of killing anyone in the audience.

“What, want the weapon?” Li Qiye lazily glanced at the crowd without an imposing aura or suppressive presence.

Nevertheless, everyone still became frozen and didn’t dare to meet his gaze. Some even staggered backward. Was it due to the immortal weapon in his hand or another reason?

Six-finger, Jadesword, and the five elders felt the same way. They saw a vision of the throwing star being next to their neck, ready to decapitate them with just a bit more strength. Their steel-like body wouldn’t stop it for a second.

“You want it, right?” Li Qiye appeared amicable as he asked Turmoil Conqueror directly.

For some reason, this casual question robbed Turmoil of his courage, leaving him unable to respond. He found himself to be insignificant like a speck of dust versus Li Qiye.

Remember, conquerors were ambitious existences, wanting to soar above the nine firmaments and reign over the realms. They feared nothing for victories would come in due time.

This applied to Turmoil Conqueror who had fought many capable rivals in the past. Alas, just Li Qiye’s glance alone was too much for him to take.

He no longer dared to make claims about the immortal weapon. He took a deep breath and activated his imperial aura, using his full strength to support his mental state.

“I believe that this one-of-a-kind weapon belongs to the virtuous.” He repeated and felt a weight coming off his shoulders. Just speaking to Li Qiye was quite a struggle.
