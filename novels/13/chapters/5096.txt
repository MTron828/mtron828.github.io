Chapter 5097: Mine

The news of Li Qiye staying in Eight-stallion prompted a visit from a familiar face - Jian Yunyun.

“Looks like you have something to tell me.” Li Qiye smiled after seeing her.

She bowed and said: “Yes, Young Noble. I have retrieved Primal’s treasure.”

Back in Demon, she didn’t follow the group into the divine nest and returned to Primal instead. Divine Empress Dowager had left her a mark. After deciphering the runes, she understood something and used the key to retrieve the item.

“What does this have to do with me?” He asked.

“I’m not sure, intuition tells me that it is related to you, Young Noble.” She said with a serious tone. Moreover, her intuition has been correct ever since she met Li Qiye for the first time.

She believed that Li Qiye was somehow related to her lineage. The first thing on her mind after obtaining the item was to bring it to Li Qiye.

Given her status, she should have used it to stabilize her position in Primal or even use it to revitalize the lineage. Thus, her action was rather questionable. Some could consider this traitorous.

How could she present their sect’s legacy to an outsider? This was egregious and should be heavily punished.

“Do you know what you’re doing?” Li Qiye asked.

“I know, this is arguably treason.” She nodded.

“Yet here you are.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I believe that this is the right way to benefit Primal. Not doing so means declination until destruction.” She took a deep breath and said.

“What you lack in innocence when compared to Ming Shi is made up with decisiveness. You will make a great leader.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly and said.

“Here, Young Noble, please take a look.” Yunyun took out a box and presented it to Li Qiye with both hands.

This box was made from a rare and ancient material known as Azure Stone with a legendary hardness. Thus, whoever managed to carve it into this shape was incredible.

The more shocking thing was the seal on it. It seemed to be battered by time but in reality, it has become one with the box. This was beyond any conqueror or even ancient emperor. Only someone who had embarked on the path toward the truth could create this seal.

This was the reason why no conquerors and dragon lords from Primal were able to open it. The content remained unknown to the lineage as it was passed down as a legacy treasure.

Eternal Conqueror himself spent painstaking effort attempting to open it. Alas, he failed and so did his successors in Primal.

They only knew that the content was something amazing, nothing more. Moreover, the box itself made it clear that their progenitor who left it behind was far stronger than any of them.

Li Qiye stared at it and knew what was inside right away. As he held it, a crimson light flashed on his forehead. This light didn’t belong to Li Qiye but rather, the drop of blood that was given to him by Eight-stallion Dao Lord before death.

He patted it and said: “Little girl, you did the right thing. This treasure does not belong to your lineage.”

“Who does it belong to?” She asked right away.

“Me.” Li Qiye answered.

“So you’re our progenitor?!” She blurted out but then thought that this couldn’t be right. “No, Young Noble, you are connected to Primal.”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

She thought that the latter speculation was more accurate.

“I have nothing to do with your lineage but yes, I am connected to your progenitor. Now the ties are deeper after the decision to give it back to me.” Li Qiye smiled.

Yunyun became emotional despite being mentally prepared. There was no doubt now that Li Qiye was an ancient existence from the same era as their progenitor. He could even be an emperor from the ancient past.

She couldn’t believe that she was standing before a mythical being right now.
