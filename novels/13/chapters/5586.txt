Chapter 5587: Losing Is No Big DealUppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

His comment was not an exaggeration given the clan’s glorious past. They never yielded even before the wrath of Celestial Court.

Alas, this ordinary youth with an immortal weapon had the upper hand; they couldn’t display their dominance and high morale after losing consecutive battles. Nonetheless, they seemed ready to fight to the death.

Spectators watched with bated breath, wondering what Li Qiye would do. Chances are, he might be able to take down the clan by himself.

After seeing the weapon's prowess, some emperors and monarchs were confident in his success.

“Dao Brothers, we’re on the same side. No need for escalation and making fools out of ourselves.” A piercing voice came from a manor in Dao City.

Rays emanated from this spot and illuminated Dao Domain. The initial burst of rays bloomed and looked like rising suns.

However, they were gentle instead of blinding, allowing others to be comfortable even when staring straight upward.

A figure appeared within the clear and gentle radiance, purifying and bringing joy to the world. Describing the figure accurately and fairly was challenging due to his divine nature.

The middle-aged man resembled a precious piece of jade radiating a nurturing warmth. Others couldn’t help but feel happy in his presence.

“Luminous Conqueror!” They shouted his title and bowed with reverence.

He hailed from the lower continents and was known for his peerless talents. Only a few cultivators were his equal in all six continents.

He currently served as the lord of Dao City and chose to stay out of Immortal Dao City, not participating in the unknown event. The city flourished under his leadership and its inhabitants had nothing but trust and respect for him.

West Bank Prime Emperor shared the same sentiment as everyone else. The lower-ranking members also bowed in Luminous Conqueror’s direction.

The prime emperor was considerably older than Luminous. Nonetheless, the latter’s success was guaranteed due to his primordial dao fruit.

“Sir, I was preoccupied and couldn’t come to Momentous Frontier to pay respect, my sincerest apology.” Luminous bowed his head.

Li Qiye smiled in response.

Luminous then spoke to the prime emperor: “We are members of The People. Recall how we fought together to survive numerous tribulations and extermination, eventually building a place we can call home.”

Listeners had no problem with his grandiose statement; some nodded in agreement. The truth wasn’t as perfect but they did have commendable solidarity to survive all the bloody wars.

After Grand Dao War, the emperors and other top cultivators rarely had conflicts, only minor disagreements at best.

Today, this battle between Li Qiye and West Bank has taken it to the next level. Regardless of the eventual winner, it would devastate The People and potentially cause a rift in its solidarity.

“There is no conflict that cannot be resolved among those who walk on the same path…” Luminous suggested peace.

“An irreconcilable enmity that reaches heaven cannot be resolved.” A dragon lord from West Bank disagreed.

They lost two of their strongest dragon lords today. If they were to swallow this humiliation without dishing retribution, they would lose all face and no longer be able to stay in Dao City.

“Dao Brothers, if you wish to end this with blood, it will be an ocean, that is not something anyone wishes to see.” Luminous responded.

“Is that not the outcome of wars?” The dragon lord didn’t wish to yield.

“Prime Emperor, what is your thought on this? There is no need to escalate.” Luminous asked.

All eyes fell on West Bank Prime Emperor - the lord of his clan with the final vote. He stared at the weapon in Li Qiye’s hand for a while before bursting out in laughter.

“Hahaha, victory and defeat are just part of life, and we have lost today. That is fine, we agree to stop.” He surprised everyone.

The clan still had ample firepower and given their illustrious past; everyone thought they would continue the battle.

As for the powerful cultivators, they could tell that the emperor was not confident in beating Li Qiye’s immortal weapon.
