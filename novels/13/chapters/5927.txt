Chapter 5927: Benevolent Immortal

“Oh, benevolent immortal... thank you for delivering us from suffering...” The villagers were moved to tears and continued to show their respect.

This act might have been easy for Li Qiye but it changed their life. Survival was a struggle in this harsh desert given the rarity of water. The arid climate made life unbearable and as difficult as it could be.

With a mere gesture, he caused a spring to gush forth from the depths of the earth to alleviate the hardships that had plagued them for generations.

They no longer needed to wait three days to drink with the presence of the stream. Furthermore, the towering trees shielded them from the harsh sun, not to mention the fertile soil.

Their future descendants have been blessed with an unprecedented increase in quality of life. Some had blood on their forehead for kowtowing too roughly against the ground. Alas, they felt no pain and only wanted to show as much reverence as possible.

Chu Zhu, on the other hand, let out a sigh and paid attention to the statues, not commenting on the situation.

Of course, transforming the terrain wasn’t difficult for a character of her level or any emperor. It’s just that none would want to do something like this. After all, plenty of mortals lived in suffering.

Emperors and primal ancestors could spend their whole lives and wouldn’t be able to save all mortals. This feeling of futility prevented them from trying in the first place.

Although the villagers appreciated their new oasis, Chu Zhu understood the statues were the true gifts. They could protect future descendants and the oasis in perpetuity.

They were connected to the earth veins now so in reality, this mortal village gained a frightening foundation and resources. Powerful cultivation kingdoms and sects weren’t lucky enough to have this privilege.

Of course, they remained a secret for now. Not to mention the mortals, even mighty cultivators wouldn’t be able to spot them.

Chu Zhu also confirmed her suspicions and doubts - Li Qiye was no mortal but rather, an unfathomable existence. No wonder why she felt so insignificant when sitting near him.

While the crowd showed their respect, Li Qiye took his time looking at the statues like an artist looking at his portfolio. Chu Zhu followed right behind him.

Judging from the exterior and markings, the statues seemed to have existed for countless years. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

They depicted warriors clad in armor, standing tall and imposing with an aura of authority. They were seasoned warriors from the same legion, honed by blood and gore on the battlefields.

Two stood out among the rest. Everyone couldn’t help staring at them first.

Although petite in stature, one of them exuded an aura of fierce determination. She held a long sword, preparing to vanquish gods and demons. The valiant woman instilled a sense of fearlessness among those nearby. No enemies could ever take her down.

The other woman had flowing golden hair shimmering in the sunlight. Her exotic charm was matched by an unparalleled elegance. She chose the blade as well, capable of sweeping through the world.

“This is Sky Moat Legion...” Chu Zhu knew their legends very well.

Li Qiye nodded without speaking.

Chu Zhu carefully looked at the two female statues and speculated: “They must be the legendary Buddha and Godhand.”

“Which one is which?” Li Qiye smiled.

Chu Zhu pointed at the smaller woman and said: “She must be Stone Buddha, the commander of the legion, the guardian of Sky Pass.”

Time did not weather her unwavering determination. She never forgot her mission and duty, remaining steadfast to the very end.

The other exotic woman was Godhand. Although she wasn’t a part of the legion, she shared a deep friendship with Stone Buddha. Therefore, she did not hesitate to come to their aid during the calamity.

Unfortunately, the fortress crumbled and the sea monsters invaded, causing the deaths of countless innocent lives. Nevertheless, the legion didn’t retreat and continued to fight.

The odds were against them due to the number and the power of the sea monsters. Godhand’s involvement couldn’t change the tides.

This land was only saved with the arrival of Supreme Black Ancestor’s group but they were too late.

Chu Zhu sighed while looking at the statues. They fought valiantly and despite failing, there was no room for reproach.

“Sky Guard War was horrific. I heard Sky Moat Legion was the strongest in the world yet they still lost.” Chu Zhu murmured before looking at the village and the villagers.

The mortals clearly didn’t know much about their legendary ancestors.

“Rumble!” Loud blasts on the horizon suddenly interrupted their conversation.
