Chapter 5252: Child’s Play

“If you don’t roll off that throne, I will either kick you out or worse, wring your head. Which outcome do you prefer?” Li Qiye smiled.

The crowd thought that this was finally time for the finale.

“Is that so?” Suppression’s pressure continued to make everyone tremble in fear.

A few big shots stared at him and thought that if he were to give up now, it would be utterly humiliating compared to dying in battle.

“This throne is mine.” Suppression said before shouting: “Erupt!”

On another side of the palace, Jadecure Conqueror had managed to stabilize the situation after expertly controlling the flames in her cauldron. She stopped the interference and continued to refine the pills within.

“Boom!” However, the imperial rune floating above Darkflame Cauldron Emperor became resplendent, no different from a dao fruit.

The influx of power made the alchemist tremble in pain. His dark flame rushed out of the cauldron and began attacking Jadecure Conqueror’s cauldron.

“Crack!” The pavement beneath her started cracking; her feet were pushed into the ground.

This caused her flames to be weaker and the refinement process came to a halt.

“Rumble!” Suppression didn’t stop from channeling more power to the cauldron emperor via the rune.

“No more!” The latter shouted, unable to endure the sudden influx.

Suppression ignored him, only focusing on defeating Jadecure Conqueror as fast as possible to maintain his legitimate claim to the city.

“Boom!” Jadecure naturally couldn’t handle the dark flames at this point since she was barely stronger than her opponent.

She only had two dao fruits so the gap between her and Suppression was insurmountable. The flames in her cauldron became feeble, on the verge of extinguishing.

Worst of all, the evil flames didn’t only attack her cauldron but aimed for her as well.

“!” She became alarmed and it was too late to run. The dark flame coiled around her like a dragon, seemingly wanting to devour her.

“No!” Resplendent and the others bellowed in horror. It was too late for them to empower her.

Moreover, this would have been useless since Suppression alone was far stronger than all of them combined.

Amidst the crucial moment, Li Qiye shook his head disapprovingly and said: “Child’s play, how embarrassing.”

He stomped the ground and an alchemy dao releasing eternal flames manifested into reality. It seemed to contain the powers of numerous alchemy emperors. Their flames have been embedded in this special dao.

It flew into Jadecure Conqueror’s body, causing her to light up in a blinding manner. A verdant tree suddenly appeared and blotted out the sky.

She became empowered with numerous flames as if she was taken over by capable predecessors.

“Boom!” They easily broke the fiery dragon trapping her and went on the offensive, incinerating the rest of the dark flames.

“Shit!” Darkflame Cauldron Emperor couldn’t believe it and turned to flee. Alas, this dao flame engulfed him in no time at all.

“Ahh!” He let out one scream before being reduced to ashes along with his cauldron and the content inside.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“!” Suppression Conqueror was affected as well and staggered backward.

The dao flames then returned to Jadecure’s cauldron. She could only stand and watch since these flames were beyond her control.

The refinement process changed constantly in a profound manner. Alchemists became immersed in this scene; even regular cultivators observed carefully. This was the apex of the alchemy dao.

Suppression himself couldn’t help staring at the refinement process and the dao flames, unable to think of another soul in the upper continents capable of this.

“Boom!” A tribulation appeared again in the sky.

“It’s coming.” Someone said.

A medicinal fragrance wafted in the air next. Whoever breathed in immediately became shrouded in a golden light.
