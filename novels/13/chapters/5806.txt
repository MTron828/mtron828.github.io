Chapter 5806: Malignant Dao

“Shall we get started, Sacred Teacher?” Profound bowed.

“Come, show me what you have received from Dao Ancestor.” Li Qiye said.

“Just child’s play in your eyes, so please excuse me.” Profound said before melting like ice.

Instead of turning into water, he melted into dao strands that fuse with the myriad dao in the process.

One could hear buzzing noises and dao blossomed like flowers. Eventually, it became impossible to discern the natural dao from Profound’s dao strands.

It reached a point where he and the myriad dao have fused into one entity. Since cultivators relied on the dao, their bodies contained dao laws and mysteries. Thus, Profound became a part of them as well.

Some emperors trembled at this thought. If Profound was a part of their dao and body, it would also mean that he had control over their life.

Because of this, they retreated to keep a safe distance, not wanting to be part of this process.

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand, instantly destroying all dao nearby. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Spectators gasped after seeing this. This was akin to destroying a galaxy with a single hand wave.

“Zzz...” Dao mysteries suddenly emanated from him, forming one layer after another. A fission process started at a frightening pace.

Dao mysteries were the basis of cultivation. Understanding and implementing them into the dao foundation were essential, eventually culminating in a dao law. This was a good thing since it meant improvements.

However, the propagation of dao mysteries and laws around Li Qiye appeared malignant and grew uncontrollably like tumors.

The precious mysteries of the dao morphed into something foul and attempted to take over Li Qiye.

“A mutation of the dao?” An emperor shuddered.

“They’re malignant and will try to infect his dao.” Nether saw the clues.

This was their first time seeing something like this.

“What should we do in this case? Sever our own dao?” Someone asked since this appeared to be the only option.

“Creative, yes.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “But unfortunately, it’s me you’re dealing with, the true beginning of the dao.”

“Buzz.” Primordial rays appeared within Li Qiye, existing since the start of time.

Each ray represented a new world and excavation - initiating a one-sided contest against the malignant dao. They burned the dao tumors to ashes, not leaving a tiny piece alive.

It didn’t take long before the layers enveloping him disappeared.

“Bam!” The rays came together for a focused attack, extracting Profound from his omnipresent state and smashing him against the ground.

“Sacred Teacher, you are invincible. My Profound Transformation is not worth mentioning in your presence.” Profound got up and vomited blood before praising.

“Profound Transformation? It’s an interesting path but I’m the wrong opponent for it.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly: “Anything else?”

Everyone exchanged glances. The title of the technique sounded great but in reality, it was a dreadful move.

“I’m not giving up yet.” Profound summoned his Nine-heaven Shroud.
