True Emperor themselves would find trouble dealing with this type of direct suppression.

The crowd was absolutely horrified by this scene - Dracoform’s might was no exaggeration.

“His fame as the number one expert is not empty at all.” Some were lost in admiration.

They felt that he wasn’t that strong a while ago. Well, not that he was weak, but Li Qiye was just too strong.

The latter had the upper-hand numerous times in this battle, so Dracoform didn’t look like the number one expert at all. Thus, people started becoming disappointed and thought that he wasn’t as strong as they have imagined.

Since the carp’s tail was being pushed down by the elephant, it couldn’t create any more wave. It became no more than an ordinary fish.

“Please give me pointers.” Dracoform stood there with a heightened presence, seemingly invincible. His progenitor aura caused people to shudder, regardless of who they may be.

True Gods could only kneel, unable to resist this type of aura. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that his strands of power right now could crush them.

“No need.” Li Qiye smiled: “Just Wavebringer Carp is enough. You’re not the only one who can control the power of the dao source.”

With that, a buzzing noise came about. Li Qiye suddenly radiated strings of light, resembling the formation of a cocoon. They drilled into the ground.

“Boom!” The system poured out endless light. This place was massive with countless living beings. In this blink of an eye, dao runes densely packed on every inch of the land.

“Clank.” They wove together to create dao laws that surged to the sky. These dao laws then formed a heavenly symbol - an order of the grand dao. This runic order instantly imprinted itself onto Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” The entire system quaked once. Every inch of the land was pouring out pure, true energy. Everything accumulated in the system was coming out. This endless power gathered on a maelstrom formed by the previous runic order.

“Boom!” Two dao wings appeared behind him. Just one flap of them would send down enough wind and lightning to eradicate everything.

Though his physical shape remained the same, he seemed a lot bigger than before with his head wearing the sky and feet stomping on the earth. The power of a progenitor presided within him.

“I-impossible!” Dracoform became aghast with his eyes wide open in astonishment, unbecoming of being the number one expert.

“How can this be?” He couldn’t believe his own eyes, thinking that he was only seeing things.

The rest of the world became afraid too. The members of Vermillion were slack-jawed, standing there frozen like wooden chicken.

They couldn’t regain their wits at all. Eventually, one ancestor was the first. He confirmed that it wasn’t an illusion and gasped: “No, no way... how can he control the power of Vermillion, he’s, he’s just an outsider, and this force isn’t any weaker than Dracoform Martial God either!”

Indeed. Li Qiye’s grasp on this dao system’s power right now was not inferior to Dracoform’s.

People wouldn’t find it strange that Dracoform would be able to do this. As its strongest ancestor, he had researched and studied the entire place. On the other hand, Li Qiye was just an outsider who has never been to Vermillion before this.

The whole thing was too frightening. Only those who studied the laws of their progenitor and the dao source could control its power. As for how much? That’s dependent on their own abilities.

It seemed as if Fiercest could casually grasp any system’s power. This meant that he would be untouchable wherever he went, capable of crushing all the other members of these systems.

“How, how are you wielding our system’s power?” Dracoform has finally lost his cool and stuttered.

Mu Shaochen had also controlled their system’s power before, but that was because he had time to research their system on top of having permission from the martial court.

Moreover, his control was quite limited, far less than what Dracoform could do. This wasn’t the case for Li Qiye at all. It meant that Li Qiye could use their own power to crush them without using an ounce of strength - quite a frightening thought. No wonder why someone of Dracoform’s stature would still be shocked.

Li Qiye leisurely answered: “It’s only returning to the origin. Whatever your Martial Ancestor did, I replicated the same thing, that’s all, so what’s difficult about controlling your dao system?”

The nonchalant comment frightened Dracoform because he himself didn’t know how his progenitor did it. No one in Vermillion in history has been able to answer this question, let alone an outsider.

The members of Vermillion didn’t know, not their wise sages either. Li Qiye possessed this knowledge, allowing him to use the twelve variations and control Vermillion’s power.

It was indeed the truth when people said that Martial Ancestor had found a section of a heavenly scripture - Physique. Of course, it might not be named the Physique Scripture back in that era. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Because of these pages, he was able to create his own grand dao along with the twelve variations. Thus, he used the words of this scripture as the guiding principle for the dao land refinement process during the foundation of Vermillion.

It didn’t matter whether the scripture was named Physique or Finality, it still had the same essence, created from one of the nine words.

Coincidentally enough, Li Qiye had this scripture and even opened a new page completely, naming it Finality.

He possessed the real thing on top of mastering its profundities, so it wasn’t hard for him to trace all the way back to Martial Ancestor’s original source.
