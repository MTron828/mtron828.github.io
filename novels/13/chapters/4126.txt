Chapter 4127: Coincidence

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Money is not omnipotent, cultivators focus on the dao. Only ultimate strength can represent everything.” A young cultivator interjected.

“Strength is the foundation.” Illusory Princess glared at Li Qiye, not wanting to back down after his repeated transgressions.

“Sounds like you think you are stronger than me.” Li Qiye smirked at her.

“I am absolutely sure of it in terms of cultivation.” She paused for a bit before emphasizing.

Of course, the majority here agreed with her since they could see Li Qiye’s cultivation. There was nothing profound to speak of since he was below average.

Ordinary disciples from the behemoths could easily kill Li Qiye in a one-on-one fight, or so they thought.

“Hmph, do you dare to fight the princess without relying on external means?” One youth scowled.

Illusory Princess wasn’t the number one genius at Nine-wheel Citadel. However, her strength shouldn’t be questioned.

As part of the Four Weapon Heroes, she was on the same level as the Ten Sword Prodigies. Sure, Goldflow Young Noble would be stronger but she might be able to contend against the others.

“Blades do not have eyes, death might be the result.” She sneered.

It became apparently clear that she wanted to kill him. It was his fault for insulting her several times so far.

His amusement returned as he spoke: “Some fools are so full of themselves, always thinking that they can kill me.”

“Try then if you’re not convinced.” She wasn’t afraid of trouble. So what if Li Qiye was the richest man in the world? Her sect wasn’t afraid of Sea Emperor, let alone the new-rich.

“We have fine wine and good dishes here, enjoy them instead of violence.” Goldflow Young Noble said.

He had immense influence and pull. After his smoothing attempt, the crowd scowled but chose to drop the issue. The princess did the same.

As for Snowcloud Princess, she had a strange smile on her face. Her interest in Li Qiye only grew since she was unable to see through him.

Calling him ignorant and arrogant wasn’t quite right. It was more so confidence and boldness.

Thus, the atmosphere calmed down but this didn’t last. “Bam!” A middle-aged man rushed in and accidentally slammed one of the tables.

He kept on looking out the entrance, looking quite sorry as if under pursuit. He saw many patrons and became happy. This doubled the moment he saw Illusory Princess.

“Your Highness, please save me!” He rushed over and prostrated before her.

“You are?” The princess didn’t recognize him.

“I am Liang Po, a member of the side branch. I was there during your coronation.” The middle-aged man hurriedly responded.

She nodded and recalled someone like that. He must have been a descendant of a powerful ancestor from the sect who decided to branch out later on.

The members of such sects might never set foot in the primary sect but were still considered part of it.

“What is it?” She slightly frowned after seeing the call for help. Who dared to pursue a member of Nine-wheel Citadel?

“Your Highness, my ancestral ground is on this island but someone is after it. I couldn’t take them on so I fled but they still wouldn’t let go.” The man explained.

The crowd became startled after this.

“Such audacity? Are they courting death?” One youth said.

“Right, they’re messing with the wrong person.” Another expert added, wanting to please the princess.

“Who is it?” The princess’ eyes turned cold and flashed with aggression.

Others should be thanking their luck that her sect wasn’t actively expanding. Who dared to take their territory? She wanted to make an example of these fools to show others the consequences of provoking Nine-wheel Citadel.

Two women then entered the restaurant. One had a black veil and a stealth technique, making it impossible for anyone to see her true appearance. The other wore a purple dress, looking slim and graceful.

“Us.” The latter responded to the princess.

“Pendant Sword Maiden!” Someone shouted her title. [1]

The newcomers were none other than Xu Yiyun and Lu Qi. They were surprised to see Li Qiye and walked over to bow.

“What a coincidence.” He smiled.

The patrons exchanged glances. The sword maiden’s background wasn’t as impressive as Illusory Princess but she was still one of the Ten Sword Prodigies. They also knew that she was working for Li Qiye.

“Miss Xu, why are you seizing our disciple’s ancestral land and pursuing him?” Illusory Princess had no intention of being courteous to someone working for Li Qiye.

“Your Highness.” Xu Yiyun responded: “Then you need to ask your disciple why he sold his land to our young noble but won’t actually hand it over once we come for it. I had no choice but to take what belongs to us by force.”

The crowd had no idea who was telling the truth or not.

The middle-aged man shouted back: “Such lies! They came and took our land for no reason, now they’re trying to make up a story!”

Illusory Princess’ eyes narrowed: “Our members do not lack money. Even if they do, they’ll ask the sect for it. This must be a misunderstanding.”

She naturally trusted her sect member over Xu Yiyun and Li Qiye. Plus, she was being logical as well. Her sect had enough resources to take care of even external members and side branches.

“Words aren’t enough, you need proof!” Another youth helped the princess. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yiyun calmly responded: “Your Highness, I have the receipt for the land deed right here. His signature is on it.”

“She faked it!” The man bellowed.

“Let me take a look to know if it’s fake or not. Every inch of land here has a rightful owner and a deed approved by me.” A gentle voice suddenly sounded.

An old man came into the restaurant. Li Qiye had met him earlier at the base of the mountain.

“Tortoise Monarch!” Many got up and bowed towards him.

Though he lacked an oppressive aura, he was still the lord of this island. Some believed that he was only second to Cloud Dream King in this region.
