Chapter 5723: Dao City In Declination

Dao City was prosperous and lively no more after the invasion of Celestial Court. Numerous imperial lineages and kingdoms fell into ruins.

However, the betrayal of Luminous Conqueror and West Bank Prime Emperor hurt more than anything, shattering the survivors’ morale.

They didn’t return even after the withdrawal of Celestial Court.

First, they feared another invasion with time. Moreover, they couldn’t get over the pain of the betrayal. Some had lost faith entirely.

For eras now, Dao Domain was considered the home of The People. The heavenly treasure and powerful cultivators served as mighty defenders.

Now, what was the point of having a haven if the defenders could turn on their own home at any moment? The terrible memories haunted them, prompting them to leave.

At the same time, some entered Momentous Frontier and abandoned cultivation, choosing to live like mortals instead.

They believed that Momentous Frontier was the safest location in the world. Moreover, they had lost hope and confidence with the dao.

Of course, a few great powers chose to stay behind, not wanting to abandon their ancestral home. They were born here and wanted to die here as well.

Their faith remained strong. They believed that Dao City would be able to get through this since worse things had occurred during Immemorial Epoch War. Nonetheless, The People still persevered.

They still had confidence in the emperors and monarchs. Immortal Dao City would still be a pillar in the future and prosperity shall return to the land.

Although there were traitors, their optimism was not shattered. They recalled the fallen combatants - Jadesword, Skysplitter, Six-finger, Immortal Emperor Yao Guang, War God Dao Lord... Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

These powerful cultivators didn’t take a single step back and protected Dao Domain with their lives. The same thing applied to the fallen armies of Dao Domain.

Luminous and West Bank Prime Emperor didn’t represent cultivators, only two traitors among countless heroes.

While Demon summoned the strongest members of The People, Li Qiye came to Immortal Dao City instead.

He gazed at this broken region; it looked lonely and sad like a dying beast. He let out a sigh since many epochs had fallen in this manner. What happened in Dao Domain was essentially the same, albeit on a smaller scale.

This was a fatal blow. Even if the epoch somehow survived, it would wither with time due to the pervasive doubt and despair. Survivors would question the dao path and mighty cultivators.

Li Qiye gazed at the beam from Celestial Court flying deep into Immortal Dao City. A supreme existence there must be trying to research the latter’s mysteries but only sent an intent.

“Boom!” Li Qiye raised his hand and lifted the beam serving as a mighty bridge.

“Rumble!” The deep crevices of Celestial Court shook violently. It sent out more light in retaliation, aiming at smashing Li Qiye.

The activated power of a heavenly treasure was too much for any cultivator to bear. Of course, Li Qiye was an exception.

He lifted and bent the beam, intending to break it. The dazzling rays couldn’t slow him down.

The commotion naturally alarmed everyone in Dao Domain. At first, they thought that Celestial Court was returning.

The first reaction was to evacuate but once they looked up, they saw Li Qiye pushing up the heavenly beam.

It had been there ever since the opening of the gates. No one could move it an inch, let alone destroy it.

“Sacred Teacher, it’s the Sacred Teacher!” Some started cheering after witnessing Li Qiye’s attempt to take down the beam.

Although they didn’t understand why he was called “Sacred Teacher”, he left an indelible impression on them after massacring an army from Celestial Court.

They had absolute confidence in him and viewed him as a savior.
