Chapter 5393: Right Before Us

Illumination’s hellbent obsession with eradicating The Race was no secret. Though this alienated the majority of cultivators, it also gained him many diehard followers.

For example, Wild Conqueror’s sect was destroyed by The Race, hence his vengeance. Another was Devil Conqueror whose sect suffered a similar fate. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, many dao lords in the palace came from Eight Desolaces. After ascending to the upper continents, they had ties with The People or other relationships but didn’t share the same hatred toward The Race.

This was the reason for Dao Alliance’s decline - neutrality versus vengeance.

“We do not wish to destroy The Race.” All-things said.

“If you have access to this ancient art, why haven’t you used it?” Five-sun Dao Lord chimed in.

“I need a catalyst.” Illumination said with a dark expression: “I require the ancestral blood of the three races.”

“!” Everyone became emotional after hearing this because this was something capable of causing a war in the immortal continent.

“The ancestral blood types are no more.” One conqueror shook her head.

“Not necessarily.” Illumination laughed and said: “What did Eight Stallion come here to do? Brother All-things, you know better than anyone.”

Eight-stallion Dao Lord had indeed visited the upper continents and come to Dao Alliance before.

However, he didn’t garner much attention because he was only a six-fruit dao lord. The most noteworthy thing about him was his immortal shield.

All-things sighed and shook his head, not saying anything else.

“What does Eight-stallion Dao Lord have to do with the ancestral blood?” A dragon lord asked.

Illumination laughed and said: “He came to Dao Alliance specifically to give us information regarding the blood.”

“Are you saying that you know where it is?” Five-sun was interested too.

“You’re asking the right person. It is right before us yet is as unreachable as the heaven.” Illumination said.

“Where?” Five-sun’s curiosity grew.

Everyone thought if they had to pick someone to be in possession of the blood, it would be All-things Dao Lord.

“Sir.” Illumination stared at Li Qiye who was sitting there with a smile, completely ignoring him.

“Sir, if I guess correctly, you are in possession of the ancient blood.” Illumination pressed on.

The group clamored after hearing this due to the significance of the situation. Ye Fantian opened her eyes as well.

Li Qiye immediately became the center of attention.

“So what if I am?” Li Qiye smiled.

“The ancestral blood is of utmost importance to The People’s survival. If you have it, Sir…”

“You want me to give it to you so that you can use it to destroy the three races.” Li Qiye chuckled and interrupted him.

“That is correct, Sir.” Illumination didn’t hide his plan: “My ancient art can utilize the ancestral blood to trace all the deviating branches. Through it, I will be able to destroy all of them in the six continents.”

Everyone shuddered upon hearing this.

“This will be a ruthless extermination, even the mortals won’t be spared.” One dao lord raised his voice.

“So what?” Illumination looked up at the sky and laughed heartily: “With the destruction of the three races, the world shall belong to The People alone!”

“The People has heaveners, diviners, and devils as well! Look around you, we have dao lords and dragons from the three races right now!” Worldraiser Dao Lord shouted.

“Fine, The People will be no more afterward. After the three races are gone, Celestial Court will fall as well, and the same for Heaven and Divine Alliance. Our hundred races shall be safe then.” Illumination said.

The ones from the three races had a darkened expression after hearing this. Despite their background, they chose to join The People.

After all, the two classifications had more to do with allegiance than race itself. If Illumination were to carry out this ancient art, The People would also suffer devastating losses.

“Even if we have this ancient art and the ancestral blood, we shall not use it. It is injustice to do this to innocent mortals.” All-things shook his head.

“You’ve gone insane.” Members of the three races were eager to take down Illumination.

“Sir, don’t you think that by destroying the three races and Celestial Court, the hundred races will finally live without worries?” Illumination asked Li Qiye.

Everyone stopped and listened with bated breath. Some among them were actually interested in the possibility of ending Celestial Court despite the loss of lives.
