Chapter 4324: The Heir Of Lion’s Roar

Putting his contempt aside, the smaller sects certainly found the young lord’s arrival exciting. Moreover, the saintess herself was here in person.

The conference became grander than before, a sign of Dragon treating it more seriously. This became a main topic for the crowd.

They wondered the reason behind this. Were these two youths here on their own accord or under orders? Was there something special about this conference?

In the next several days, the larger sects send experts and even grand characters to the conference. It could be due to the appearance of these two youths.

Soaring Feather School, Flow Gate, Ice Immortal Peak… These top powers sent disciples and even those from the last generation to the conference.

This made the ward far livelier than before, completely packed with carriages. Those from the great powers always traveled with great fanfare.

Normally, the yellow rooms were packed because weaker sects were the primary audience of the conference. The higher-level rooms had fewer visitors until today.

The administrative disciples working at the ward lost their haughty attitude as well. They enthusiastically greeted the newcomers.

After all, they were just outer disciples and now, the big shots from their sects were finally coming.

The members of the smaller sects became nervous and fearful. The newcomers were powerful and overbearing. They needed to be careful lest they invite unnecessary trouble. Thus, though the place became exciting, it also became far more dangerous.

Another piece of information was leaked by an unknown person - the arrival of the heir of Lion’s Roar.

This news shocked both the weak and great powers alike.

“The heir?” A listener shuddered.

This news erupted like unexpected thunder. Though the conference was started by the Supreme Monarch, Lion’s Roar rarely sent big shots after the conference’s decline.

Some believed that Lion’s Roar was on a downward slope and that Dragon was catching up. Nonetheless, it was still the behemoth in Southern Desolace.

This went beyond the appearance of the young lord and saintess from Dragon. Lion’s Roar’s heir’s influence exceeded both.

After all, that young lord only had a strong possibility of succeeding. As for the chosen heir? It was only a matter of time.

“So he is an actual crown prince?” A youth asked, not aware of Lion’s Roar’s political system. After all, it was too distant and out of reach.

“The crown prince can be the heir, but not always. Lion’s Roar doesn’t have a strict hereditary tradition. An actual crown prince might not become the next ruler.” A sect master explained.

“Ah, I see.” the youth understood.

A member of a larger sect chimed in: “The current heir is a member of the side branch, not the main royal branch.”

“A member of the side branch can still be the successor?” This surprised the listeners.

“Lion’s Roar has a different system than most. The heir just needs to have the bloodline of the Chi. In fact, the current heir has only been decided recently. He has gained both the recognition of the royal clan and the approval of the Ancestral Divine Temple.” The guy went on, willing to divulge more information.

“He already got the temple’s approval?” A sect master became startled: “Then he will really become the next ruler of Lion’s Roar.”

The temple’s seal of approval meant that this heir’s status was absolute. It didn’t matter that he wasn’t the son of the current king.

“He’ll be in charge of the entire region.” One youth murmured.

The young lord of Dragon couldn’t compete with this. He might not become the successor of Dragon. Plus, Dragon was still inferior right now.

Lion’s Roar has been in charge of Southern Desolace for eras. Therefore, the small sects became emotional.

They could finally see the future ruler of the land - truly an honorable privilege.

“This branch, if climbed successfully, will give a lifetime of benefits.” An elder said. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Nonetheless, this could be the hardest task. Many were willing to think about pleasing and bribing the young lord of Dragon. This wasn’t the case for the future ruler of Lion’s Roar.
