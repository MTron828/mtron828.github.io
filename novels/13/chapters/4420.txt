Chapter 4421: I Decide

Goldbird Monarch couldn’t oppose Ancient Treant for he lacked power. Though he was a demon monarch, there was still a considerable gap between him and the ancient demons.

Putting pure might aside, Ancient Treant was obviously influential in Dragon. The other ancestors also shared the same sentiment regarding this engagement since the pros far outweighed the cons.

The two parties were indeed a good match, especially in terms of their bloodline. There was a chance that their offspring could come back to Dragon as well. It would certainly boost the sect’s foundation.

The future of the sect was more crucial than the personal desire of a single disciple. Moreover, as a saintess, Jian Qingzhu should be more willing to sacrifice. Therefore, her objection was futile.

“Very good.” The ex-sect master of Five-sun became happy and said: “Our sect will immediately pick an auspicious date for the wedding.”

“What a joyous event, the coming together of two families.” Peacock Monarch smiled, satisfied with this ending.

Putting his personal agenda aside, this move was indeed beneficial for Dragon. The historical annals would have this deed of his written down, another accomplishment among many.

“What is going on here? Is forcing marriage a new trend nowadays?” A leisure voice suddenly interrupted the joyful atmosphere.

Everyone looked over and saw a trio entering the field - a youth accompanied by two old men standing to his left and right.

“Young Noble, Ancient Ancestors!” Jian Qingzhu finally saw her savior and heaved a sigh of relief.

“Li Qiye!” Someone immediately recognized Li Qiye but not the two old men: “Who are those two?”

“Ancient Ancestors!” The ancestors of Dragon bowed their head while the juniors got on their knees.

Peacock Monarch lowered his head while Ancient Treant stood up.

“Ancient Pheasant and Ancient Lion.” An expert took a deep breath.

“The three ancient demons.” The crowd became emotional as a result. These famous demons were all present today.

Ancient Lion had an impressive figure and looked rather intimidating like a lion ready to lunge.

The members of the east became startled after seeing this.

“You’re two are here?” Ancient Treant came over to talk to them: “You’re Li Qiye?”

However, Li Qiye ignored him and told the ex-sect master of Five-sun: “Okay, this engagement is nullified, effective immediately.”

“What?!” The crowd clamored.

This was a grand matter between two sects yet Li Qiye chose to interfere? Did he want to antagonize both sects? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Such impudence, who do you think you are to run your mouth like this?!” The ex-sect master rebuked.

“Junior, this is Dragon’s official matter. Watch what you say, I’m not done with you yet either.” Peacock Monarch became emotional.

“Peacock, back off.” Ancient Pheasant uttered coldly.

“Ancient Ancestor…” Peacock Monarch didn’t want to yield and turned towards Ancient Treant.

The latter came from Dragon Platform so he would naturally support Peacock.

“This engagement is of paramount importance, don’t play around.” He told the two ancient ancestors.

“Old tree, the chicken and I vote against this marriage. Thus, it is over.” Ancient Lion spoke powerfully and silenced the crowd.

Since two ancient demons have taken a stance against it, the marriage alliance was over.

“...” Peacock Monarch turned red as a result. This was his great plan to help Dragon. Alas, it was all over now. His authority was challenged as well.

“Forget it!” Ancient Treant stomped the ground and didn’t say anything else.

Dragon had rules for official businesses. He and Peacock Monarch wanted to finish this as quickly as possible.

Once the matter was decided publicly, it would be too late for Ancient Pheasant and Ancient Lion to stop. However, the two came just in time to cast their vote.

“Dao Brother, please reconsider.” Featherhat Paragon tried to persuade the two: “Our alliance from the east came with sincerity. The proposed marriage alliance between Dragon and Five-sun is absolutely perfect.”

“Yes, Five-sun King is the heaven’s favorite and will be a dao lord in the future. We should be supporting them.” Treasure Ancestor chimed in as well.

“Enough, she’s not your daughter, stop caring so much. She doesn’t want to marry so that’s the end of it, stop blabbering and leave.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“You!” The eastern members glared at him.

“Junior, you don’t speak for Dragon.” Featherhat retorted.

Peacock Monarch also glared at Li Qiye: “An outsider needs not to interfere with Dragon’s business. This place doesn’t welcome you!”

He thought about killing Li Qiye right now to avenge his son. Alas, Dragon’s official business was more important so he calmed down.

“The little girl is under my protection now. If I say no, then it’s no. Those with no sense of propriety will be courting death.” Li Qiye smiled and made an overbearing statement, offending the supporters of the marriage.
