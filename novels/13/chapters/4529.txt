Chapter 4530: Acting

“You are as strong as a god.” Untethered Vajra’s expression was rather exaggerated as if he was grievously wounded after the exchange.

However, he didn’t relent and continued: “Nonetheless, I will overestimate myself and try again.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He took one step forward and gathered energy once more. Roars resounded before he made a move.

“I don’t know how strong Li Qiye is, but just look at that impeccable aura.” A spectator praised.

The bestial roars were intimidating and real - a testament to the cultivator’s strength.

Untethered Vajra seemed eager to fight regardless of Li Qiye’s power, not wanting to let down True Immortal.

“Strong you may be, I will fight in my young noble’s stead.” Wise Ancestor stepped forward.

“So be it, let’s see what you can do, Wise Ancestor.” Untethered Vajra shouted.

“Clank!” Wise unsheathed his sword. Its divine pulse frightened the crowd since they could feel the ancestor’s strength.

“Take this!” Untethered Vajra roared. He summoned a portal and let out a raging lightning storm.

“Come!” Wise raised his sword, ready to parry the incoming lightning bolts.

However, the moment his slash touched the bolts, they suddenly dispersed into nothingness. Untethered Vajra seemed to be injured by the sword energy and staggered again.

“The sword art of the Wu is peerless indeed.” He praised.

Wise was left speechless. He merely started the first variation to repel the lightning bolts. How did his foe lose already?

Wise knew that he wasn’t strong enough to defeat Untethered Vajra so effortlessly. He then went on to perform a vertical slash. The energy traveled like a rainbow across the sky.

Untethered Vajra became resplendent. A diamond shield manifested into reality and landed in front of him, looking like an unbreakable mountain range.

“Bam!” Alas, unlike its appearance, the shield broke down to the slash and Untethered Vajra staggered backward for the third time.

“How can I stop your sword art?” He said, aghast. It was as if Wise was the strongest swordsman in the world.

Wise, on the other hand, felt the toughness of the shield earlier. His attack had no chance of piercing it, let alone crushing the entire thing. He knew that his opponent purposely destroyed his own shield.

Why would he do something to help his enemy? Of course, Wise wasn’t an idiot and understood right away.

Untethered Vajra had no intention of helping True Immortal. Alas, he couldn’t refuse their request and had to put on an act to shield himself from repercussions.

“Fellow Daoist, try this move! Soaring Dragon!” Untethered Vajra released a golden dragon into the sky.

It raised its claws and revealed its fangs, capable of tearing apart an entire army.

“Very well.” Wise understood that this was all for show.

Thus, he gathered all of his sword energies. They took the form of a rising sun with chaotic rays.

“Rumble!” The two of them fought in the air and swept away the clouds. The sun and moon lost their colors.

“You have truly mastered the techniques of the Wu.” Untethered Vajra praised again.

“You’re too kind, your commendable arts have broadened my horizon.” Wise laughed.

Though the battle seemed fierce and flashy, they always held back at the last second. Weaker cultivators would think that they were serious and fighting to the death.

Li Qiye chuckled after seeing this. The old men were crafty enough to put on a good show for the audience.

He then stared at Alchemy Child and said: “How do you want to die?”

“You dare?!” Alchemy Child barked back.

“You tell me.” Li Qiye smiled and walked closer.

“Go!” Alchemy Child waved his hand and his fellow sect members unsheathed their weapon and readied their treasure.

A dozen or so immediately surrounded Li Qiye.

“Allow us.” Jian Ming and the daoist joined the fray.

Jian Ming opened his trunk and released strange treasures, instantly going on the offensive.

The daoist was normally reserved but in reality, he was immensely strong in battle. He waved one banner and sealed the disciples inside a tornado.

Alchemy Child was only a servant under the young emperor and didn’t have a high status in True Immortal. Thus, his men were only regular disciples, no match for Jian Ming and the daoist.

Alchemy Child turned pale and could sense death coming for him. He shouted: “Don’t be insane, my master is a scion and will be a dao lord soon. If you touch a hair of mine, you will become his enemy…”

He tried to threaten Li Qiye. Most would give True Immortal and the young emperor face, not wanting to go to the extreme. He had done this plenty of times in the past to deter his opponents.

“I will give you a chance to attack or I’ll crush your neck.” Li Qiye naturally wouldn’t fall for this.

Alchemy Child could see that the threat didn’t work. He shouted for help: “Untethered Vajra, help me!”

“Fellow Daoist, please show mercy!” Untethered Vajra acted as if he wanted to save Alchemy Child. Alas, he couldn’t get away from Wise.

Wise wanted to laugh because he wasn’t putting in any strength in his attack yet the vajra acted as if he was under unbearable pressure.
