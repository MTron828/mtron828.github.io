“Pop!” The great domain crumbled and the ten bones trembled a bit before remaining standing.

The difference was now, they had runes clearly carved on them that have come together to form complete texts. Each character was brimming with dao power, seemingly capable of blowing up the sky.

The mystical source and its power from each bone were in full view. Perhaps this was the bone’s true appearance.

The crowd, whether it be Gong Qianyue or Zhang Yue, the elders or the disciples - all of them were left speechless.

The oldest elder has seen and experienced many things in his life, just not something like this.

Comprehending the dao bones was a profound matter; a merit law derivation was even harder.

Just deriving one successfully was an amazing contribution to cultivation. Now, Li Qiye had done ten of them in just a short time and without any effort.

They needed to be here in person in order to accept this reality from watching with their own eyes. Nonetheless, some still felt as if they were dreaming. They pinched their thigh and the pain indicated otherwise.

This made them gasp in astonishment. Shock wasn’t a strong enough word to describe their current emotion. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This was nothing less than a peerless miracle, a soon-to-be legend.

“This dao bone should be mine now?” Li Qiye revealed a soft, natural smile as if he didn’t do anything big.

“Yes, yes, it’s, it’s yours.” The elder in charge answered; his wits haven’t fully returned.

He eventually calmed down and personally placed the bone into Li Qiye’s hand as if afraid the guy would change his mind.

This was an extremely good deal for Divine Black. Anyone in charge would definitely agree. Only a fool wouldn’t do so.

First of all, ten merit laws. Their level actually didn’t matter. When a disciple offered to make this contribution, a great reward was in order.

Moreover, there was a high-level earth merit law too. This would be considered amazing in any sect.

In fact, it would be fine to reward such a disciple with treasures and imperial arts on top of more resources and privileges.

Now, Li Qiye only wanted a single dao bone of the lowest quality. This didn’t matter to the sect in the slightest.

They had several thousand low-level yellow bones. Thus, Li Qiye’s request was actually too generous.

“Virtuous Nephew, is there anything else you want?” The elder thought that this was ridiculous and wanted to offer more. Even Zhang Yue who didn’t like Li Qiye felt that they needed to do more.

“Just let us know if you need any resource or treasure. We’ll negotiate and will satisfy your request, yes.” The elder went on.

“That’s for sure.” The other elders nodded in response.

They naturally wanted to treat a disciple like Li Qiye well. Any sect would treat him like royalty and do everything to groom him.

There has been a shift in the crowd. More than a few disciples thought that Li Qiye was making a mistake for asking so little versus his accomplishment. They would have asked for much more.

“No need for anything, just call me Young Master from now on.” Li Qiye looked at the nearby dao bones before answering.

This naturally took the elders and disciples off guard. This was a heaven-sent opportunity where Li Qiye could ask for pretty much anything. This was his demand?

Plus, it was unreasonable. Ordinary disciples could call him Young Master but for the elders to do so as well?

“That’s not giving any consideration to seniority, so improper.” One disciple murmured.

The elders exchanged glances and found this whole thing bizarre. Anyone else would be asking for resources and status but this guy only wanted to be called “Young Master”? Was he obsessed with being a young master even in the cultivation world?

Only a fool would do something like this but Li Qiye was far from it. If he were a fool, then everyone else here wasn’t qualified to be a fool.

There was another possibility, that something was off about him. More often than not, only a thin line separated genius from insanity.

“Virtuous Nephew, you can reconsider this.” The elder in charge seemed especially attentive towards him.

“It’s Young Master.” He repeated.

The elders didn’t know what to do. How could elders like them call a disciple of their sect this?

“Very well, Young Master.” This elder actually gave up and smiled wryly.

The other disciples widened their eyes in disbelief. Elders were the top dogs in their sect with plenty of power. Now, they have acquiesced to Li Qiye’s request. Could anything be more bizarre than this?

These elders thought that they had met the most eccentric disciple possible as they smiled at each other. Of course, the wise thing to do was to keep him around at all costs. They must devote their resources into training him.

“Hmm, I think I had a bet with some people here, right? Do I have to demand the payments from each of you?” Li Qiye then turned towards the crowd and said.

Most remained silent; the active betters turned red since they made fun of him earlier. Now, his derivation slapped them on the face without showing any mercy.

Their disdain for him earlier worsened the blow and humiliation.

“I betted.” No one dared to renege and placed their treasure in front of him.

“Same, I lost.” The others joined in despite the pain.

They could see how much the elders valued Li Qiye by this point. Reneging meant that they would have no place to stay in Divine Black.

The one feeling the worst was Zhan Hu. He scowled and begrudgingly took out a treasure that instantly exudes a majestic beast aura and immense life force. This treasure was stronger than anything shown so far.

No elders here bothered to help Zhan Hu. After all, a bet’s a bet.

It didn’t take long before a pile of treasures appeared in front of Li Qiye. Their wondrous lights made the spectator salivate.

No one alone was in possession of so many so he became the envy of everyone. Alas, none of them could do what he did to justify winning so many treasures.
