The fire phoenix ravaged the sky with its flame. An imperial aura and divine glow emerged magnificently.

“A technique from an imperial art.” A spectator roared.

“Can he win now?” An older cultivator also became shocked.

This was the only imperial technique in Stone Harmony.

The decline of the system heralded the end for many sects. Amazing techniques and weapons disappeared from the world as a result.

Later on, it had a single imperial law left in the possession of its strongest sect - Luo Faction.

However, few could actually cultivate it successfully. Yang Tingyu was one of them, also the youngest to have accomplished this.

This art allowed him to defeat many foes. That’s why he earned the title of being number one in Stone Harmony.

Yang Tingyu was a Grand True God but in terms of raw internal power, he was inferior to Wu Youzheng.

Alas, Youzheng didn’t have an imperial art so he lost immediately the moment Tingyu used his.

“Screech!” The phoenix flapped its wings and sent out waves of fire.

“Go!” Yang Tingyu roared and issued endless flame as well. He and the phoenix became one before flying straight for Li Qiye.

His flame incinerated the world - boiling the ocean and burning the sun and moon. This annihilative force wanted to completely swallow Li Qiye.

The domineering scene left people speechless. They believed that his art was unbeatable and could burn any master to ashes regardless of how powerful they were.

“Watch it!” Yixue was shaken and quickly warned him.

However, Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye and simply raised his foot before stomping down.

“Boom!” Despite the surging flame filling the sky and his wondrous momentum, Tingyu was still suppressed by the stomp all the same as if he was an ant. His abilities and methods were rendered ineffective.

“Screech!” The phoenix wanted to soar again so its flame became even more radiant and hot. This was its final struggle.

Unfortunately, even a real phoenix wouldn’t be able to escape his stomp, let alone one made out of fire.

He slightly increased the strength and the phoenix instantly turned into smoke. The great bird was no different than a tiny spark of fire, so easily extinguished.

At the same time, Yang Tingyu’s chest was crushed while issuing horrific cracking noises. He naturally spat out blood.

“Ah!” He screamed in agony.

Time seemed to be frozen; everyone’s mouth was open big enough to fit in a goose egg.

An imperial art was peerless in the mind of these disciples - the very best of merit laws. In the past, whenever Yang Tingyu resorted to this art, it meant assured victory. However, this all changed today. His art was nullified completely and he was just as weak as anyone else below Li Qiye’s foot.

The crowd couldn’t utter a single word after seeing this. No one else in the system could have withstood this move since it was the strongest merit law utilized by the strongest master of their system.

Li Qiye’s murderous slash was already frightening enough, displaying his brutality in full. Now his stomp has crushed this imperial law. This took away the hope of the spectators and crushed the system’s pride into ashes just like that phoenix earlier.

The members of Stone Harmony felt unprecedented despair - a feeling of powerlessness.

They looked up at Li Qiye’s average frame and saw a giant wearing the sky and stomping on the earth. They were nothing in comparison so they dropped to the ground, becoming empty-headed.

Just think about it, even the strongest merit law was nothing to him. Their own merit laws and dao became even more insignificant in comparison. What was the point of cultivating then? They couldn’t rise above being an ant.

The brutal slash earlier was already traumatizing but this stomp would wake them up in the middle of the night for years to come.

The entire city became quiet. The spectators didn’t dare to breathe loudly. Alas, some couldn’t help but tremble.

“Told you but you didn’t listen.” Li Qiye looked at him and said: “Some people won’t cry till they see the coffins.”

“Kill me then! I’m a bitch if I let out even a little groan!” Tingyu yelled.

He was indeed courageous and didn’t bother begging for mercy after losing.

“No, killing you won’t increase my infamy. I’ll let you walk away with your life.” Li Qiye smiled.

This naturally shocked the crowd. Some thought that he was joking.

Li Qiye raised his foot and kicked Tingyu to the side. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The man was bloodied and stared at Li Qiye in disbelief. He was ready to die but didn’t expect to be spared.

“Do you know why I’m not killing you?” Li Qiye glanced at him and said: “Since you’re Puresword True Emperor’s disciple, go tell him that Fiercest, the person who killed his little brother, is right here waiting for him. I’m too lazy to go to the Mu Clan so this will save me a trip. Tell them to all come with their neck ready for decapitation.”

Tingyu and the rest became horrified. This was a blatant and domineering challenge to both an invincible emperor and the monstrous Mu Clan.
