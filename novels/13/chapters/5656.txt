Chapter 5657: Kelp Man

Everyone found identifying the figure that had leaped out of the dark expanse challenging.

It appeared humanoid but was covered entirely in black kelp, or so it seemed. It held a weapon that was just as impossible to distinguish. It was covered in the same black aquatic grass as well. Perhaps it had been submerged underwater for too long and became covered with this grass.

Thus, it resembled a thick and long tree branch more than anything.

“Enough, Resolute!” The figure shouted.

Listeners found it surprising that this unknown being recognized Resolute Conqueror. Moreover, the voice was male and he appeared lucid, not a demonic or frenzied devil from the darkness.

Were they friends or foes?

“Clear the way so I can come in.” Resolute’s voice carried a supreme might capable of suppressing all living beings.

“You court death!” The kelp man shouted furiously and released a blinding imperial aura. The weapon in his hand let out a resonating cry, ready to dominate.

He swung his weapon and the six paths of reincarnation appeared, suffocating everyone. The strange weapon seemed capable of annihilating everything. Blocking didn’t seem to be an option even for emperors.

Resolute raised his arm and his armor became radiant with a heavenly light.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” It enveloped and blessed the emperor as an ethereal image of Celestial Court appeared behind him.

“Break!” He lunged forward, evading the smash and slamming down with both arms.

A resounding blast detonated. The strike seemed to be breaking the spine of the world. Everyone felt a sudden pain jolting throughout their body. Being struck by him meant certain death.

The kelp man raised his weapon horizontally to block the smash. The impact caused sparks to scatter like meteors. Spectators immediately retreated - the farther, the better.

Resolute channeled power from his radiant anima tree into his arms, making them the heaviest objects in the world. On the other side, the kelp man maintained his stance, not being crushed by Resolute.

Few in the world could match Resolute Conqueror yet this unknown cultivator was able to do so. However, none could come up with the man’s identity.

“Boom!” Suddenly, an arrow shot forth while exuding a dazzling trail, resembling a galaxy. It seemed to have been made by the refinement of countless stars, possessing both sharpness and immeasurable weight.

Time seemed to be reversing since the explosive sound of its trajectory was only heard when it appeared before the kelp man. Its lethality couldn’t be overstated.

“A sneak attack?!” Ordinary big shots couldn’t react in time while imperial-level characters sensed the arrow’s power and shouted. If one were caught unprepared, destruction was all but certain.

However, the kelp man gathered darkness in one hand, utilizing it as a shield to block the arrow.

“Boom!” The impact could overturn space itself, blowing away billions of stars.

“Bam!” Alas, he no longer held his weapon with both hands so Resolute won the contest, landing a direct strike after smashing through the defense.

He staggered backward and vomited blood, suffering a serious setback from the ambush. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Once people calmed down, they traced the arrow back and saw a man standing amidst the stars. He seemed to be the center of the celestial affinity.

When he drew his bowstring, the stars formed a long arrow. The infusion of celestial power allowed his arrow to penetrate anything in the mortal world.

“Starshooter Dao Lord!” A big shot recognized him - a dao lord from Eight Desolaces versed in long-distance ambush. Many of his opponents were taken down unaware.

“That’s it!” The injured kelp man became livid.

“Bam!” Something like a dao lock shattered, freeing him from its binding.

“Rumble!” He stood upright while explosions detonated around him. Afterward, he gained a dark aura; his eyes were dyed with the same hue.

He resembled a devil king, becoming one with the dark expanse.

“Boom!” His attack no longer wielded the imperial light but rather, an ancient darkness.

Big shots were reduced to blood, only the stronger cultivators managed to survive from his dark aura. Such power frightened everyone.

“Damn!” Resolute’s expression soured.

“Whoosh!” The kelp man’s weapon changed and resembled a black lightning spear.

The spear flew with a frightening speed, leaving an indelible scar along the way. It pierced Starshooter’s chest in the blink of an eye, causing blood to gush up in the air.

“Ahh!” He screamed while being thrown backward from the impact, staining the area with his blood before falling downward.
