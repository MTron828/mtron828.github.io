Chapter 5435: Heaven’s Favorite

The four alliances maintained a delicate balance after Emperors War; none displayed clear dominance and absolute advantages.

Today, Supreme seemed confident in breaking the established mold.

“What did you get from Celestial Court?” Eternal couldn’t help but ask.

The two had a peculiar relationship - neither entirely friends nor foes, seemingly allies with a hint of tension.

“Just some insights and connection. I can show you if you wish.” Supreme answered vaguely but still admitted to having gained something from Celestial Court. The actual details might not even be available to the upper echelons of Heaven Alliance.

Nonetheless, it seemed that Supreme was willing to divulge the information to Eternal - a sign that he wanted to strengthen their relationship.

However, Eternal didn’t press the issue and focused on the task at hand.

“Brother, what will you do now?” Supreme asked All-things.

“I’m sure you didn’t come here alone without ample preparation, can we get started?” Eternal smiled.

“It is an honor to be respected enough to have the two of you after me alone.” All-things said.

“He’s right about one thing, it’s been a long time since our last fight. Today is as good as any day.” Suddenly, a dao path appeared.

A man wielding a righteous sword dao approached the group using this path. Was the sword dao righteous because of his noble personality or vice versa?

“Brother Darkfrost.” Supreme and Eternal greeted All-things’ expected reinforcement.

All-things certainly came prepared for Illumination’s sacrificial ceremony. Darkfrost has been waiting the entire time.

“I’m sure our alliances have more capable cultivators than just us.” Supreme revealed a rare smile, perhaps more captivating than that of a beauty.

“Imperial Alliance certainly will not stand and watch on the sideline.” This time, it was a swordswoman who possessed an everlasting sword dao.

“Sword Queen, so Imperial Alliance is finally making its move.” Supreme said while staring at the woman with a sword in her embrace.

“I’ve been waiting for this.” Eternal was interested in dueling someone possessing a similar affinity to his.

“So it’s a three-on-two? Do you have anyone else?” All-things asked Supreme.

“Clank!” Another appeared and was accompanied by a rampaging sword ocean.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Brother Swordsea.” No one was surprised to see him either.

“A rare moment of all of us being present. Let us end it here and respect the victors instead of suffering a prolonged war. It doesn’t matter who rules in the end.” Swordsea laughed and said.

“Eight Desolaces are filled with talents.” Eternal couldn’t help but comment.

Among them, four came from Eight Desolaces. He and Supreme were the only ones from the six continents.

Now, the delicate balance emerged again - three on three.

“Give the command.” Darkfrost told All-things.

The latter nodded and shouted: “March!”

“Boom!” A grand formation created a portal. After loud detonations, numerous cultivators walked out including Skysword, Stone Monarch, Hallowed…

An army consisting of thousands of the best cultivators appeared behind All-things Dao Lord. Their auras erupted like the roars of a million stars.

“March!” Supreme and Swordsea Dao Lord gave a similar order.

Another portal appeared along with the sounds of war horns. On the other side were Five-sun, Immortal Emperor Xu Kong, Ye Fantian, and many others.

The world became tiny in the presence of these powerful cultivators. After all, any attack from a single member could destroy a kingdom.

“Boom!” A third portal allowed a pagoda to manifest into reality. On top of it was a man whose hair cascaded over his shoulders.

He was blessed with an ethereal radiance and immaculate physical features. His imperial robe shared the same perfection, making him appear like a dragon among men.

He could be seen from any distance due to his imposing presence. In fact, he drew more attention than his renowned pagoda. Anyone would immediately think that they were looking at heaven’s favorite or an immortal.

His talent and achievement didn’t actually matter. His appearance alone made him seem destined for greatness. He was born to be great while others had to work to reach the same height.

This man needed neither courage nor diligence. Just existing alone was enough for him to become a conqueror in due time.

“Immortal Pagoda Conqueror.” The other side became serious after seeing him.

“Everyone, we meet again.” Immortal Pagoda stood proudly and said. His seemingly arrogant demeanor was not pretentious or an attempt to intimidate others. This was his natural aura that had been there since birth.
