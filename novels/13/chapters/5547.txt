Chapter 5548: Seizing Merits

“I’m hearing a lot of critiques but I’ve never seen you train before.” Li Qiye glared at him and said.

“Young Master, it’s not my fault, I was busy cultivating the eighteen solutions taught by you, no time to learn about the dao source or whatever.” Niu Fen protested.

“That’s an entirely different issue. If you had only studied the eighteen solutions, how did you get your dao fruits?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hehehe.” Niu Fen smiled awkwardly but he had thick skin and said: “It’s not my fault, Young Master. Those guys back then got all the good stuff, taking branches and fruits. I didn’t do anything but enjoyed the moment, I just made some slight adjustments to the comprehension method of the mantras.”

“So you’re actually one of the first to pass them down.” Li Qiye said.

“Hehe, not me.” Niu Fen shook his head repeatedly: “Maybe the first to explore and ponder them. As for why the insights were lost, I don’t have an answer since I spent most of my time in the sect.”

“I’m telling you, blame Duck Egg, he’s the first dao lord. Or maybe that Puresun brat, he was the one running everywhere to preach the dao. And as for these continents, I don’t have anything to do with this, it was like this when I got here.” Niu Fen said: “But to be perfectly honest, if we’re gonna blame anyone, it has to be that brat Blessed. In my opinion, he purposely did this since the seven mantras or whatever didn’t exist during my era.”

Having said that, he prolonged the inflection of his voice and said: “Yes, that’s it, the little scoundrel, modifying the way to cultivate with the dao source. Now, only mortals cultivate the seven laws, no other cultivators.”

“It’s because all of you tried to seize merits.” Li Qiye said.

“Sigh, Young Master, not me because I remembered your teachings.” Niu Fen said: “Can’t you see that I have cultivated the eighteen solutions to the limit?”

“Fine, I don’t blame you due to your talent because, at the very least, modifying the source requires your current attainments.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Exactly.” Niu Fen nodded repeatedly: “Let me tell you all the suspects. First is Duck Egg, then in my opinion, Puresun is next. Later on, that ferocious lady must have had a part too, no one dared to provoke her back then. Whatever she said went, no one else had much to say. In the end, I don’t know what the original intention or the proper method is at all, I’ve never seen or touched it, let alone taken matters into my own hands.”

“Is that so?” Li Qiye glared at him after three consecutive denials.

“Hehe, of course.” Niu Fen said before gesturing with his thumb and index finger together: “Well, okay, I glanced at it a little bit, just this tiny bit.”

“Fine, whatever.” Li Qiye smiled and pressed his palm forward.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The laws of Momentous Dao twisted together and then loosened like a tightly clenched lock that was suddenly released.

“Creak.” The heavy gates opened, revealing the grotto inside.

Soft rays emanated from the interior and made people feel a surge of vitality spreading within their body. It was as if seeds were taking root and sprouting to life.

“Are you home, old geezer?” Niu Fen shouted.

Alas, he didn’t garner a response.

The group came inside and saw an exquisite paradise. Life force echoed like green waves. Flowers and trees were gestated by immense spirit energy. Just one strand of essence oozing out to the outside world could result in a bountiful harvest.

However, no one seemed to be here so the group moved forward. They reached the center and saw a pond with a golden liquid.

The mysteries of Momentous Dao constantly evolved within the water, turning this into a container for the dao. A rice stalk grew exceptionally tall in the middle.

The ones seen in the various shrines and temples were around three feet tall. This one looked like a tree and was full of grains the size of elongated fruits. They glowed golden, giving the impression of a bountiful harvest.

The radiance from the grains harmonized with the golden liquid. Who knows what was the original source of the golden hue? Perhaps they complemented each other from the start.

The power of faith and worship allowed this stalk to grow tall and awe-inspiring. It channeled its power into the pond and from that, Momentous Dao spread to the rest of the realm.

“This is it.” Niu Fen said.

“The Root of Harvest.” Baifeng murmured while sensing the power of faith gathered from everyone in Momentous Frontier. They prayed and gave offerings for good weather and a fine harvest.

“This thing again.” Niu Fen noticed something - a gray aura infecting the stalk.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It entwined the stalk and caused withering and decay. Branches and grain fell into the pool, dissolving into nothingness.

“Where is the old geezer?” Niu Fen wondered.

“Did someone infiltrate the grotto?” Baifeng became anxious.

“No sign of intrusion and fighting. He left on his own volition.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Out of Momentous Frontier?” Baifeng became emotional.

“No, still here.” Li Qiye said.

“Something must have happened. Given their ambitious and noble goal, they won’t ignore problems or give up halfway. Their dao heart is indomitable.” Niu Fen said.
