Chapter 5778: Trinity Zenith

The circular disk above Nether Emperor released primordial energy. It resembled a grindstone with three distinct parts possessing unique runes. Their constant rotation and derivation created a boundless realm with countless living beings.

Thus, a total of three realms harmonized with each other, giving rise to more creations infinitely.

Light arcs cascaded down, each seemed capable of cleaving the world apart - removing karma and other affinities along with all enemies.

“Rumble!” The rotation became faster, forcing powers and dao to be sucked inside. The grinding combined everything into an epoch.

This treasure contained the eras of an epoch, the powers of all of its cultivators and dao...

“Can Reversion stop my Trinity Origination Disk?” Nether appeared unstoppable with the might of an epoch above him.

“Ask yourself first whether you can wield its power in entirety.” Fan Chen gripped his blade tightly, preparing for battle.

“We’ll find out now!” Nether took one step forward and shouldered the weight and power of an epoch.

“You cannot muster its full power unless your supreme overlord takes over.” Fan Chen remained calm while facing a paragon artifact, reaching a transcending state with Reversion in his grasp.

“No need, this is more than enough to slay you.” Nether roared, aware of his insufficiencies.

Trinity Origination Disk - a creation of Primal Ancestor - was not at grand completion just like Immortal Emperor Hao Hai’s Divine Beast.

In terms of crafting methods and materials, Divine Beast was far more precious and powerful. However, its main problem was that it belonged to an older epoch. The clashing of dao left Hao Hai unable to fully master it.

The disk, on the other hand, belonged to Trinity Epoch. Thus, his dao could properly harmonize with it.

“Come.” Fan Chen released Reversion from the scabbard, looking like a cheap sword instead of being one of the five immortal armaments.

“Boom!” Fan Chen activated his twelve wills and anima power.

Strangely enough, destruction and suppression were absent from his power activation. It gave the impression that he was no longer part of the cultivation world, reverting to simplicity. He appeared weaker but became one with nature.

“Clank!” Reversion finally lit up, releasing a power that could only be seen at the start of time.

All paths led to the original truth and that was the location of this blade - a container for all powers and dao.

This activation stole everyone’s attention including the brilliant Ren Xian, Hao Hai, and many others. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

They thought that Fan Chen might be the most suitable cultivator for Reversion. Was it created for him or was he born to wield it? Either way, it was a perfect match.

“Truth Reversion!” His technique illuminated Celestial Court itself. All dao and affinities were taken into the blade before being unleashed at Nether’s head.

“Impressive!” Nether roared and commanded the disk to send out an arc propelling time and space forward.

“Trinity Zenith!” The arc turned into a divine ring - a physical manifestation of the unstoppable sharpness of Trinity Epoch.
