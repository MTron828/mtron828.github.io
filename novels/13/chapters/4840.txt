Chapter 4841: Six Heavenly Continents

Chaos energy filled Eight Desolaces to the brim. Its magical property aided the proliferation of life and cultivation.

After the disaster was a majestic upheaval. All living beings felt closer to the grand dao. Even those who have lived for millions of years suddenly found themselves able to break the bottleneck.

The mysteries of the dao became easier to learn. The dao themselves became flawless and continued to transform in jubilation.

Deers could eat grass and somehow learn the dao; fish came across pearls and became enlightened; eagles simply played in the air and still gained great fortunes…

This golden era should have no lack of brilliant geniuses - something planned and carried out by Li Qiye. Now it was time for him to bid goodbye and leave.

The only person to accompany him was Lin Mo of True Immortal. Everyone else came for the send-off event.

This included the Supreme Monarch, Tantai Ruonan, Primeval Old Ghost, Triune Immortal, Sky-devourer and Grand Immortal, the friends from Void Zone…

The ancestors from True Immortal also came because of Lin Mo - Tian Tu, Specter, and many others.

Though he was reluctant to part, he still hurried the process and hugged Chi Xiaodie, Tantai Ruonan…

“I hope you will return, Young Noble.” Zhuo Jianshi spoke softly.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Don’t let us become grandmas before returning.” Liu Ruyan was bolder and winked at him.

Li Qiye smiled at the group and then told Lin Mo: “Let’s go.”

He started walking without looking back.

“Ancestral Aunt, please be well.” Tian Tu and the other ancestors from True Immortal prostrated before Lin Mo.

These brilliant ancestors chose to stay in Eight Desolaces and didn’t ask to follow her.

Lin Mo looked back and became emotional. She might not be able to see those that she had spent eras with ever again.

“I’ll take you now. Just focus on thinking about it and you’ll get there.” He told Lin Mo.

“And you, Young Noble?” Lin Mo stared at him. She thought that they would travel together for a while.

“Not me, I’m not that welcomed there. You will have a better reception.” Li Qiye said.

“As you wish, Young Noble.” She nodded.

“Goodbye.” Li Qiye finally looked back one last time and waved at the group before ascending.

Everyone waved back at him.

“First Brother, goodbye!” Among them was a woman with a pair of big and round eyes who shouted loudly.

Lin Mo also floated upward right behind him. Once they got high enough, Li Qiye performed a special step to activate the myriad dao.

“Boom!” The spirit energy of Eight Desolaces gathered beneath his foot as he took control.

Cultivators got on their knees during the phenomenon. They only knew that the lord of Eight Desolaces, Li Qiye, was up to something.

“Rumble!” A clear and holy path descended from above with a blinding radiance.

“Go!” Li Qiye shouted and pushed Lin Mo upward, protecting her with chaos energy and supreme laws.

She cooperated while focusing her mind on the destination. She ascended above the realms and suddenly, she saw a different world.

“Boom!” The grand dao of Eight Desolaces suddenly deactivated and the path closed. Lin Mo disappeared from everyone’s sight after a successful ascend.

As for Li Qiye, he used his primordial mastery and pulsed brightly before turning ethereal. After a short while, he also disappeared.

The remaining primordial light dispersed into particles and scattered downward. Living beings raised their hands and upon contact, the particles released beautiful waves. The dao affinity entered their body.

“Why did First Brother use a different method?” The round-eyed woman asked.

“To hide his destination from curious eyes.” Primeval Old Ghost responded.

“They are certainly paying attention, he doesn’t want to be bothered.” Triune Immortal nodded in agreement.

Everyone murmured “goodbye”. They knew that he has finished his task in Eight Desolaces and might not return ever again.

***

Li Qiye stood on a hill and enjoyed the gentle winds. The thirteen continents were no longer the same.

The winds carried the aura and history of this world. He closed his eyes and immersed himself in their embrace.

He lay down with a blade of grass in his mouth, seemingly enjoying this arrival before murmuring: “Are they still around? The old geezer might be dead.”

As he decided to rest, his body seemed to be seeping into the land like rainwater, becoming one with it.

During the previous calamity, great powers have fallen. Immortal Emperors and Divine Emperors fell in battle.

Today, there were only six left. They were classified into three parts - Continent of the Immortal, Two Upper Continents, and Three Lower Continents.

Chaos was one of the three lower continents. True to its name, this place was disorderly and dangerous.

Its inhabitants included countless villains. Sect destruction happened every day. Conquerors and dao lords have fallen as well.

This unrest was unceasing and only halted recently with the generation of Eight-stallion Dao Lord. Of course, it was far from being peaceful but at the very least, sects could feel relatively safe. Mountains of corpses and rivers of blood weren’t created on a daily basis.

Eight-stallion Dao Lord didn’t have the ability to subdue the continent nor did he harbor such ambition. Nonetheless, life became better because of him.

Today, the villains and fierce cultivators became impatient again due to a particular rumor - the dao lord’s immortal shield has been stolen by someone.

All three lower continents were stirred by this piece of information.

Eight-stallion Dao Lord was a dominating figure. The other behemoths didn’t dare to disrespect him. His shield allowed him to be unbeatable even when fighting against the conquerors.

Now, with the shield gone, many speculated that his death was inevitable. His battle prowess has significantly decreased.

Nonetheless, no one came to challenge him thus far. After all, he still had six dao fruits and only Conceal Conqueror of Deity could fight him.

The experts in the lower continents believed that even without the shield, Conceal Conqueror was the only person with a real chance of winning.
