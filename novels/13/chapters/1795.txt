The truth was that Shen Jinlong himself wished for this since his heart was no longer his the moment he laid eyes on Jilin Princess.

Since she was about to inherit the dao legacy of the Jilin Clan, she couldn’t marry an outsider. It was definitely an amazing news for Shen Jinlong.

Even before any of the rumors, his ancestors have already wanted a marriage between the two of them and even came to talk to the Jilin ancestors about it.

The Jilin ancestors didn’t directly reject it because Shrouding Sun was a good choice while Jinlong himself was a decent seed.

However, the princess refused right away. Her mind was set on the Heaven’s Will and didn’t have time to worry about romance.

Jinlong didn’t give up after this and simply felt that the time wasn’t ripe. As long as he kept on showing his best side, he would be able to earn her favor one day because he was the most excellent in this region, the most suitable for her.

This was the reason why he tried so hard for her arrival this time in order to satisfy her and leave a good impression.

“May I ask when you will go to the imperial clan for a marriage proposal?” Li Tianhao half-jokingly asked.

Jinlong naturally wouldn’t bring up the refusal and proudly declared: “I’ll let you know when I’m successful, Brother Li.”

“The marriage alliance between the two houses will be a joyous event and a blessing for the people of Jilin.” The cultivators quickly fawned over Jinlong.

Of course, some people weren’t happy but after truly thinking about it, only Jinlong had a good chance of earning the princess’ love.

Being the center of attention did satisfy Jinlong a bit. Nevertheless, he was determined to follow the princess and show her his best side this time around in order to win her heart.

Godwatching Peak was beautified in a short time. Everyone here was waiting for the princess’ arrival.

Tieshu Weng knew that Wang Xiaotian wanted to cause trouble but they didn’t dare to leave because they were waiting to meet up with Li Qiye. Thus, he brought his disciples away from Wang Xiaotian - out of sight, out of mind.

Of course, He Chen’s group still wanted to stay at the peak as well in order to see the princess.

Li Qiye finally came over during their wait so they could finally breathe easy, almost like seeing the sun after a cloudy day. Without him by their side, they felt lost. When he was around, they felt quite safe even with just him standing there, not lifting a single finger.

They quickly rushed over to greet him.

“Am I in the wrong place?” Li Qiye pretended to be surprised at the dazzling mountain. It looked just like the main mountain of a sect now.

“No, this is indeed Godwatching Peak but since Jilin Princess is coming, the people of Jilin decorated it a bit.” Weng explained.

“Good, let’s go up then.” Li Qiye nodded. He didn’t care about the princess’ arrival at all. His focus was to observe the star in order to find the position of Mad God’s corpse.

“I’m afraid Southern Sun Young Lord and Jinlong won’t let us up there.” Shen Xiaoshan was worried: “Earlier, I heard these big shots talking about not letting minor cultivators get up there.”

It made sense for that group to want such an atmosphere. They were going to welcome the princess and didn’t want randoms to be present. Moreover, this would lessen the competition so even if Li Tianhao and Jinlong didn’t want to do it, the other great powers would chase the weak cultivators off the peak anyway.

Li Qiye smiled in response: “No one can stop me from going where I want.”

Weng was startled due to his negative premonition earlier.

“Sir, why don’t we wait a bit until the end of the event? It’ll be quieter anyway.” Weng persuaded.

He didn’t want this little ancestor to cause so much trouble. What if he were to antagonize the Jilin Clan? What was Sago Palm going to do then?

“No need, right now is fine.” Li Qiye calmly said before heading towards the top.

Tieshu Weng and Shi Sou were helpless and had to follow him. On the other hand, He Chen was quite excited because he could get a better view of the princess by going up.

There were experts guarding at the base already. Not to mention cultivators from the weaker sects, even the non-famous ones would be stopped.

Strange enough, Li Qiye only glanced at the guards and they seemed to not notice him at all, allowing the group an easy passage.

This confused Shen Xiaoshan and the others. It was as if the guards didn’t see them at all but that was impossible because they weren’t cloaking themselves or anything.

This was the power of the Thought Scripture. Li Qiye only needed a quick glance before controlling the guards’ mind and dao heart. Of course, their shallow cultivation played a big part in it as well or one glance wouldn’t be enough.

Wang Xiaotian was very happy today. Even though things weren’t going as well as they could recently, today was good for him because he had befriended many imperial descendants and elders in this place.

It was a good investment for the future to know these big shots since his life would be much easier in Jilin.

Suddenly, he saw some familiar figures - Tieshu Weng’s group.

“You think people like you can come to this place? Scram to the base and kneel or face the punishment!” Xiaotian immediately walked over and scolded.

A few cultivators glanced over but didn’t bother asking because Sago Palm was only a tiny sect under West Bank.

“Since when can you yell at my people?” Li Qiye answered since Tieshu Weng was too scared to do so.

“You again!” Xiaotian gritted his teeth. His recent unhappiness was all because of this mortal.

“A good dog does not block the way, leave.” Li Qiye’s eyes were next to the precipice over yonder because it was the best location to observe the ominous ground.

“Ignorant fool, the heroes of the world are all here today, this isn’t the place for you to prance around!” Xiaotian couldn’t handle Li Qiye’s disrespectful attitude towards him before everyone.

He reached for Li Qiye without holding back and didn’t think that this mortal could do anything, intending on killing Li Qiye with one blow.

“Ugh...” But he couldn’t crush the guy for he was hanging in the air with his neck gripped. His eyes were going white as he couldn’t breathe.

This sudden development made everyone look to their astonishment. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The prince was clearly being choked but no one could see the assailant because there was no hand by his neck.

It looked as if an invisible hand was doing it and capable of crushing the prince to death at any moment. The crowd instantly looked around and assumed that a master was the one doing it.

Meanwhile, Shen Xiaoshan’s group was completely confused by this invisible hand holding the prince up in the air by the neck.
