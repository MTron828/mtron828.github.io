Chapter 4224: Unbeatable

No one viewed Li Qiye as a young master or a man with a few impressive tricks any longer. Who would dare to say that he didn’t use his own power to kill Ocean and Void at this point?

Though they didn’t know how he did it, it seemed like he did kill them fair and square.

“The number one of the young generation, completely unbeatable.” Someone gazed at Li Qiye and concluded.

Another opened his mouth but couldn’t quite refute. In a traditional sense, Li Qiye didn’t resemble a supreme genius or a true cultivator.

His cultivation wasn’t as solid as Void and Peace Ocean. It was akin to the reflection of the moon on a river, too intangible and different.

However, how could they refute when he had just taken down both Peace Ocean and Void, the previous candidates?

“Not just the young generation, who can actually take him on right now?” An old big shot gazed at Vastsea and said.

By this point, everyone thought that Li Qiye would be able to take down ancestors from the previous generation as well.

“This battle might cause the flames of war to engulf our continent.” A king reflected.

A war between these behemoths would drag many down with them, no exception. Death would replace peace in Sword Continent.

The weaker powers naturally didn’t want an all-out war to happen because sect destruction would be a common sight.

“Hand the sword over!” Jialun shouted. His voice scared the hell out of the listeners due to his power.

His expression was quite ugly. He was one of the strongest ancestors in Sea Emperor yet he couldn’t save Peace Ocean and Void.

Alas, he couldn’t kill Lu Qi in such a short time even if he went all out. His hands were tied under these circumstances.

“It’s just one sword, stop shouting.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hand it over or our kingdom will never let this go!” Jialun was ready to fight to the death against Li Qiye.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

All eyes were on Li Qiye. They knew that it wasn’t an empty threat. Vastsea was too important for Sea Emperor for many reasons.

It belonged to their progenitor and also served as a spiritual totem for the kingdom. Losing it to an outsider would be a fatal loss to their morale.

In reality, Peace Ocean’s death was rather insignificant compared to losing Vastsea. The kingdom could produce more geniuses but there was only one Vastsea.

“Sigh, the number one sect in the world is losing its cool over one sword?” Li Qiye shook his head before finishing: “Fine, here.”

Having said that, he threw the sword forward.

“Whoosh!” As the sword soared through the air, a bright radiance instantly blinded everyone.

It was as if the entire universe was being thrown along with the sword. All powers in the world were contained in Vastsea.

Jialun wanted to catch the sword at first but then realized the power of the throw. He immediately pulled his hand back, not wanting to be crucified by it.

“Boom!” The sword formation from Sea Emperor immediately shifted to form a thick wall. Chants could be heard as the diamond wall from Nine-wheel activated as well. Golden figures appeared and blessed the wall with profound runes, repeatedly empowering the wall.

The world shook violently as the swords crumbled into countless pieces. This wasn’t enough to stop Vastsea and the diamond wall became the next victim.

Just one throw alone annihilated both the sword formation and the diamond wall. The crowd gasped loudly as a result. This contained enough power to destroy an entire sect.

Vastsea traveled deeper into this sea region and caused tsunamis along the way. Eventually, it struck an even tougher defense. The shock waves seemingly flipped the entire ocean over.
