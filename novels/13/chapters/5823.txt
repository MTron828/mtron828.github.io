Chapter 5823: Who Would You Pick?

Everyone speculated that the founder must be stronger than the three immortals, but how much stronger?

He has maintained control over Celestial Court over the three immortals. Therefore, it should be a considerable amount since it was a one versus three scenario, not to mention their backers - Primal Ancestor and Lord of Derivation.

Given Li Qiye’s comment, he was only one step away from becoming an overlord - the step above their dreams. After all, they were more than happy just reaching the ancestral stage.

Becoming an ancestor was possible but an overlord? That felt like a fantasy. Moreover, they haven’t heard of any emperor becoming an overlord.

World and Profound have made it to the ancestral stage. On the other hand, the three immortals have been stuck for so long, making them feel hopeless.

Li Qiye’s revelation ignited their ambition and optimism. The future had so much potential, or so they thought.

Since the founder didn’t respond, Li Qiye continued: “It doesn’t change anything if you become an overlord either. That road only leads to one outcome, your being devoured by Primal and the others. After all, they will not permit the existence of an overlord in charge of Celestial Court and most importantly, Elder Galaxy.”

Having said that, he glanced at the three immortals and smiled: “Primal and Derivation do not allow these three to become overlords either, they’ll be devoured in that scenario just like you.”

“It is not true, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said.

“You know better than anyone whether it’s true or not. They want someone who can be trusted by both branches, a capable hound and you are the perfect match. Only you claim to be the one maintaining the delicate balance.” Li Qiye said.

“Mind your words, Sacred Teacher.” The founder appeared awkward after hearing this.

“Then what do you think you are and what have you done? Did you protect this epoch and its inhabitants or Celestial Court? No, you did nothing during the division and the blood refinement, you didn’t help Divine Ancestor when he wailed in agony, and you couldn’t say the word ‘no’ when your master returned either.” Li Qiye retorted.

The founder had no response.

“But now, you have an opportunity, an actual choice.” Li Qiye said.

“You wish for my allegiance, Sacred Teacher?” The founder asked.

The atmosphere immediately changed and everyone listened attentively. The three immortals couldn’t help clenching their fists and preparing to punish the traitor if necessary.

As for the emperors, this also affected their decision. Would they want to stick with him or the five overlords?

“Who would you pick?” A Grand Emperor whispered but none answered.

They didn’t want to make a choice before him. Of course, most have made up their mind at this point.

“You were young and weak once, unable to make a choice. This is no longer the case. It is a once-in-a-lifetime choice.” Li Qiye continued.

The founder finally shook his head and said: “Sacred Teacher, I came from Sacred Court and shall stay loyal. Since your goal includes destroying Celestial Court, I will fight you to the very end.”

“Good!” The three immortals became riled up and shouted: “We will fight to the end for Celestial Court!”

They heaved a sigh of relief because this was one fewer enemy.

“Is it too late now?” A crowd member asked.

A fool could see that the upper echelon of Celestial Court wasn’t going to give up without a fight. Leaving now meant being attacked by these four Ancestors.

“We missed it.” His friend sighed and thought that they should have left right after Titanic Conqueror.

Alas, they were shaken then and couldn’t muster the determination. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What a shame, this is it for you, the capable disciple of Trinity Epoch Lord, what a shame indeed.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Thank you for trying, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said: “I wish to die with Celestial Court, so I cannot follow you.”

“Alright, then I won’t waste more saliva and will destroy Celestial Court now.” Li Qiye said.

“Let’s see if you possess the ability to do so, Sacred Teacher.” The founder said firmly.

“Together.” The three immortals told him.

Although they were responsible for keeping an eye on him, they prepared to stand as one now.
