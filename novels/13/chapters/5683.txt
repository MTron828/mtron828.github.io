Chapter 5684: Taste My Blade

Previously, Dao Domain would have fallen without Li Qiye’s interference. This time, Celestial Court brought more troops and apex cultivators, wanting to fully suppress their enemies.

“Fellow Daoist, I am here again.” A chaos expanse appeared and a cultivator walked out. His battle intent surged like a hurricane.

“War Ancient God!” Luminous roared after seeing him.

“Once again, it is not too late to surrender.” War said calmly.

“You dare to return after being lucky enough to escape last time?” Luminous’ eyes narrowed.

“Cultivators must be ready to die. A coward will never be able to obtain the true dao.” War said.

“Aren’t you afraid of Sacred Teacher slaughtering your armies?” Luminous took a deep breath.

“Of course I am afraid but since war has been declared, we cannot falter. Celestial Court’s domination is inevitable.” War nodded: “However, Sacred Teacher will not be able to save Dao City this time. Just know that you won’t be as lucky as last time if you don’t surrender right now, Fellow Daoist.”

“I'd rather die than surrender.” Luminous laughed and immediately attacked with a radiant palm strike.

“Have it your way, Fellow Daoist.” War’s long black hair fluttered to the winds. He leaped into the air and pushed upward with both palms.

“Take them down!” Celestial Court’s reinforcement showed no end in sight.

Troops poured in and Dao City could no longer hold its ground. The defenses of sects and kingdoms were breached. This included imperial lineages such as Six-finger Peak, Skysplitter, Timeworn Manor...

“Tighten the lines!” Jadesword and the others had to retreat while fighting.

“Retreat, retreat!” Most could only abandon the battlefield and head for a stronger defensive line.

“West Bank, rise!” Suddenly, an imperial light erupted from West Bank Imperial Clan.

“Boom!” Majestic figures appeared including five emperors and twenty-two dragon lords.

They didn’t hold back and erected the barriers of West Bank.

“We march from the west!” West Bank Prime Emperor was the first to rush into the battlefield.

As an apex cultivator, he broke through the offense and forced several emperors and monarchs to fight him.

“Rumble!” The armies of West Bank began pushing their barrier forward.

“The nine legions! The west is back!” Seeing them brought hope back to the members of Dao Domain.

“We’re withdrawing to West Bank!” The defeated sects and kingdoms were lost at the start but now, they found a potential stronghold to keep this war going.

During the previous invasion, West Bank Imperial Clan did not participate despite being the strongest lineage of Dao City. This made people question whether they had defected to Celestial Court.

Now, they mobilized all of their forces and accepted the fleeing combatants. At the very least, this proved that they were still on The People’s side.

The western front showed everyone a glimpse of hope. Perhaps this renewed coalition would be able to stop the massive armies from Celestial Court.

“Clank!” An aura of despair oozed out from a slash, taking down numerous cultivators and even dragon lords.

Sword energy ravaged the area, preventing anyone from getting close.

“Patriarch, why fight when Dao City will fall today?” Just-once Dao Lord’s blade was unstoppable.

He made his way through the battlefield to challenge his patriarch once more.

“Hahaha, why would I not fight?” A battle intent engulfed the area, preceding an ocean of swords.

War God Dao Lord accepted the challenge despite not being fully healed.

“Very well.” Just-once aimed for a decapitating strike.

“I’m here as well!” Immortal Emperor Qing Xuan wielded an imperial seal to control a supreme grand dao, attacking War God from behind.

“War God, taste my blade!” Immortal Emperor San Dao appeared and released a slash as white as snow, blinding those nearby. It left a frightening scar in the air, capable of delivering untold carnage.

“Activate!” War God summoned a defensive sword formation around him, not faltering while fighting three emperors.

On another side, the towering western front remained strong.

“Who can stop me?!” West Bank Prime Emperor descended to the center of Celestial Court’s troops, fighting their commanders. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I will!” A figure emerged from the void. His entry seemed to dominate heaven and earth, suppressing the myriad laws and causing space to concave. His aura was one of stability and unshakability.

“Resolute Conqueror.” West Bank Prime Emperor had a serious expression after seeing him.

“Another battle, Fellow Daoist.” Resolute raised both hands and draconic energies coiled around his arms. Thunderous explosions erupted due to his overwhelming might.

“Just in time, Resolute, let’s get started!” The prime emperor waved and sent out three thousand dao empowered by his twelve fruits. Three thousand stars came crashing in Resolute’s direction.

“Boom!” The two apex emperors severely damaged the battlefield around them.

This was far from being their first battle so they didn’t hold back, utilizing the most fatal move posthaste. Alas, it was impossible to kill another apex cultivator within a few moves.

“Rumble!” Meanwhile, the transportation of troops via energy beams continued. As invaders rushed in, the defenders rushed toward the western front.

At this time, a blinding radiance directly bombarded Dao Domain.
