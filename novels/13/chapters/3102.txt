Winter Wonderland

These ancestors readied themselves to lend the vigors a hand, holding the chains tightly. This looked like a game of tug-of-war to the spectators.

Their auras naturally frightened everyone. Immortal Bronze Mountain was impressive indeed. Very few systems in Immortal Lineage could come up with this level of force.

“Go!” One of them shouted to initiate another attempt.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The old men released their vitality in the form of beams shooting in the sky.

At the same time, the vigors roared and started moving their hooves at full force, working alongside the ancestors.

The entire continent quaked again and still didn’t move an inch, betraying everyone’s expectation.

“Activate!” The ancestors roared and used all of their power, the same with the vigors.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The iron chains were stretched to their limit by the unreasonable power exerted by the pullers. Some started deforming as well.

Unfortunately, their effort was in vain.

“Im-impossible!” The spectators couldn’t believe it.

These ancestors could pluck the stars from above. Moving mountains and oceans wasn’t a problem for them.

A heavy continent still had a ceiling. So many ancestors working with the vigors should have had zero problems pulling a regular landmass back to Immortal Lineage. This wasn’t the case here.

“This makes zero sense.” Another commented.

“It’s not an ordinary continent, more like a supreme paradise or sacred ground, that’s why it’s so heavy.” One ancestor immediately realized.

The big shots nearby exchanged glances and agreed. After all, they were witnessing this event in person.

A regular continent would have been bested by now. Alas, this one has shown its immeasurable weight.

“Maybe this has nothing to do with the weight of the continent but rather, a type of power, a seal, perhaps. That’s why it isn’t moving.” One Everlasting’s eyes flashed as he tried to use his divine intent to scout the place.

“There’s a reason why Luminous Master chose this continent, it must be precious in some way.” Everyone figured this out.

Luminous Master had plenty of choices to pick from in the vast space - a star or some abandoned land.

However, he picked this one from Uncrossable Expanse. People have yet to realize its potential.

“Keep on going!” The ancestors didn’t give up. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Boom!” Red radiance illuminated all of Sky Ruins.

“Raaa!” The vigors also exuded the same bloody glow.

Both the ancestors and the vigors have resorted to using their life force, tapping into their true potential. This burning of vitality naturally shocked the spectators.

The floating continent shook again. It was still as futile as ever.

“Clank.” The clanking noises weren’t as loud as before. The individual links have started deforming. The chains wouldn’t last much longer.

Meanwhile, the structure of the continent was having a hard time as well. Cracks appeared as mountains crumbled. One corner even fully broke off from the mainland.

Some of the anchors lost their grip and sprung backward towards the ancestors and the vigors.

“Boom!” Chaos ensued. Some of the beasts lost stability and started rolling forward while the horrified ancestors soared to the air in order to dodge.

It took a long time before they resumed their original position while cutting a sorry figure.

The continent was a mess now versus before but it still didn’t move.

The ancestors didn’t know what to do and had no choice but to give up on this method.

Sky Ruins became quiet again since Immortal Bronze Mountain didn’t have a next move.

Zhe Long and Luminous Master didn’t show up despite this failure. They have been silent like a rock falling into the ocean ever since they stepped on the continent.

The cavalry still didn’t leave and didn’t allow anyone else to enter. No one knew what the progenitor and Zhe Long wanted to do.

“There is a great profundity in this continent.” One ancestor finally commented after observing the deathly silence: “Zhe Long and Luminous Master are still researching. I think something amazing is in there.”

”I think you’re right, he might not only be trying to create a system with it.” An Everlasting said.

It could be a great treasure or some incredible dao inside - the crowd didn’t know the details. Nonetheless, it must be at the immortal level to attract these top existences.

This realization made the big shots and many systems become overwhelmed with greed.

A thing that could attract these two would be insane. No one would want to miss the opportunity of finding out the thing hidden inside the continent.

The problem was, Immortal Bronze still didn’t let anyone inside.

“Maybe it’s worth taking a look.” One ancestor became tempted.

Though Luminous Master and Zhe Long weren’t ones to be trifled with, the existence of an immortal-level item was too much. Some might be willing to take the risk.

Sure enough, a mighty Everlasting took action. Going directly against Immortal Bronze was unwise so he chose to use a heaven-defying art to sneak there.

Another resourceful system utilized a secret dao, allowing them to scout the continent from a distance.
