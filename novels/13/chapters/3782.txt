Chapter 3783: Dao Decapitation

Intent Devourer was a magical merit law. At the highest level, it was believed to be able to devour intents. For example, battle intent, sword intent, murderous intent...

The conversion power seen here from the Buddhist light could be considered a type of intent instead of an attack.

Thus, the scion chose Intent Devourer to deal with it instead of Force Devourer.

The black maelstrom grew in size as it repeatedly absorbed the inextinguishable light. The latter kept on reappearing and surged towards the black maelstrom like a flood.

Nonetheless, the light of the Buddhist kingdom gradually dimmed down. Nonetheless, it possessed plenty of Buddhist affinities.

Though the maelstrom was incredible, it would still need more time to fully devour the Buddhist light.

In this second, the scion’s grand dao released deafening blasts as he took it to the next level. He wanted to use Intent Devourer to its limit.

“Activate!” His grand dao laws were derived to the highest profundity. All of its mysteries fully manifested.

“Boom!” The black maelstrom assumed its largest form, as big as the sun itself.

The spectators saw it crazily devouring the Buddhist affinity. Its true target was the kingdom.

The image of the Buddhist Lord started flickering and became more ethereal than before, on the verge of collapsing. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Wow...” The spectators gasped at this sight.

If this image were to be suppressed, it meant a defeat for World Crossing to the seven chapters.

“Our World Crossing can’t beat Righteous Sect’s Evil Devourer?” Some members became worried. This would be a great blow to their sect.

“Not yet, just wait.” One ancestor patiently watched.

Nonetheless, if this absorbing process continued, World Crossing’s defeat was inevitable.

“Convert!” Golden Cicada Buddhist Child didn’t stand idly by and began forming mudra and chanting.

The image of the Buddhist Lord also performed the same mudra. Its palms became blinding as if a new world was being created in there - a world protected by Buddhas.

It was filled with Buddhist affinity and faith. The light then spread to the actual world.

“Buzz.” Something unbelievable happened next. The black maelstrom suddenly became bright.

This maelstrom resembled a black hole capable of devouring all lights. But now, bright rays were coming out - a sign of conversion.

A moment later, the black maelstrom became a shimmering Buddhist Maelstrom.

“Suppress!” The scion roared. More chaos true energy and dao hymns materialized with great destruction.

Alas, this dao power couldn’t revert the conversion because the maelstrom had taken in considerable Buddhist affinity prior.

This overabundance worked against his grand dao and cultivation power now.

“Zzz...” His body started being invaded by the light once more. It seemed to be turning him into an avatar of Buddhism. His robe became golden, akin to a bronze statue.

“I can’t believe it!” The crowd was shocked to see this reversal.

They all thought that Golden Cicada was on the verge of losing. But now, it seemed that the scion would have a hard time stopping the conversion.

“Righteous Scion was too careless earlier with the absorption, that’s actually helping him now. The absorbed affinity is converting him from within.” One ancestor explained.

This gave the holy ground’s members hope so they cheered loudly. World Crossing still had a chance of victory.

As the light around the scion intensified, his body seemed to be turning into a statue. The conversion looked to be inevitable at this point.

“Dao Decapitation!” In this crucial moment, the scion shouted and released his twelve palaces and true fate.

A supreme grand dao floated around his true fate and released primordial energy. The true fate then burst with a force capable of creating an entirely new universe.

After his shout, the supreme grand dao left his true fate and crossed through space, instantly appearing before the image of the Buddhist Lord.

This was a slash consisting of using the true fate as a sword, capable of severing the nine firmaments, ending the reincarnation cycle, and forever changing history.

“Seal!” Golden Cicada’s expression soured as he retaliated with another mudra.

The image duplicated his action and created a seal capable of separating heaven and earth in order to stop the slash.

Alas, this was proven to be futile.

“Whoosh!” The true fate slash started from the head and moved to the bottom, separating the image into two halves.

In this split second, people felt that Golden Cicada’s connection to the land was severed, akin to a sky-blotting tree losing all of its roots. He immediately lost the empowerment of the temples.

“Pop!” The Buddhist image disintegrated and the particles scattered with the wind.

With that, the Buddhist light and affinity receded like the tides. The conversion process on the scion also disappeared from sight.

“Ugh...” Golden Cicada Buddhist Child staggered backward, leaving deep footprints on the ground.

He couldn’t handle the chaotic flow of his vitality and energy so he spat out a mouthful of blood. Nonetheless, he remained standing.

“I have lost.” He sighed and placed his palms together.

A hush fell over the crowd due to his surrender. Golden Cicada Buddhist Child and World Crossing have lost.

This blow was too much for the holy ground’s members. They felt suffocated as a result.
