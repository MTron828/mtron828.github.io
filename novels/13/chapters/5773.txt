Chapter 5774: Smash Your Dog Head

Her vitality looked submissive before his bloodline like a servant staring at the king. Yielding was only a matter of time.

“Heaven Authority!” Nightmoon Conqueror shouted the name of this bloodline.

The heaveners possessed a unique bloodline, the highest being one of the four immortal ones - Heaven Authority. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It could suppress and subjugate weaker bloodlines. Most importantly, this effect applied doubly to other heaveners.

In this case, they were from the same clan so his superior bloodline had an absolute grasp over her own.

“You cannot beat me.” Sword Emperor revealed his strongest stance, finally looking like the lord of Celestial Court.

“So what if your bloodline evolved? You’re still a wretched traitor.” Nightmoon showed no sign of fear.

Initially, Sword Emperor had one of the eight ancient bloodlines - Sacred Authority. Now, it had evolved to the immortal level - Heaven Authority.

Was it from his effort or taught by an overlord? No one knew the answer.

Because of this, he had an absolute advantage against the three great races. His bloodline alone intimidated any opponent.

“Boom!” Nightmoon released her primordial dao fruit, sending its energy into her vitality and body.

“Rumble!” Her bloodline became a raging tempest, no longer fearing the superior bloodline.

Sword Emperor couldn’t help but gaze at the special effect of the primordial fruit.

“Your immortal bloodline is of no use.” Nightmoon’s aura surged again, overshadowing her opponent.

Her eyes gleamed with murderous intent. The rays emanating from them could cut down stars.

“We’ll see about that.” The emperor harnessed more energy from the palace and transformed into a massive avatar.

“Hmph.” Nightmoon sensed his rapid increase in his power, deciding to summon a bronze bottle.

The area around them sank lower as if the world couldn’t withstand the weight of the bottle. It was clearly from an older epoch with a touch of primordial affinity.

One could smash a hole in the sky vault using this weapon. Moreover, the space within was boundless.

“Primordial Bronze Bottle.” Sword Emperor’s expression changed, having tasted the power of this bottle previously.

Although he didn’t know of its origin, this was the reason why Nightmoon managed to escape unscathed during the previous assaults on Celestial Court.

Few knew of its origin - one being Li Qiye. He found the floating bronze giant in Immortal Lineage World and the bottle.

However, it fell to the mortal world after his explosion. Nightmoon became the fortunate one to come across it and named it “Primordial Bronze Bottle”.

“What can this treasure do?” Sword said seriously, unaware of this unknown treasure’s true potential.

“I can smash your dog head with it.” Nightmoon uttered coldly.

“Very well.” He dared not underestimate the treasure and traced his finger down his blade, staining it red with blood.

“Crack!” A crack appeared on the heavenly sword, revealing an ancestral talisman that had existed since time antiquity.

It contained the power and mysteries of an epoch - a safekeeping place for a cultivation system.

“My Progenitorial Dao Talisman shall be the test for your bottle.” Sword Emperor took out his supreme treasure.

“From Imperial Progenitor of Myriad Realms.” Nightmoon came from the Qian, possessing enough knowledge to recognize its origin.
