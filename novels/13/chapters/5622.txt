Chapter 5623: The Empress Is Not Here

She looked frail and feminine as if a gust could blow her away. Despite this, spectators thought that Titanic Conqueror wouldn’t be able to get past her.0

The gentle woman was not overshadowed by Titanic’s immortal bone and primordial dao fruit.0

“Demon Conqueror!” Everyone in Thousand Emperor Island recognized her.1

“She’s here!” They became excited to see her appearance.0

They heard tales of her establishing an eternal deity position in Ten Great Mountains. She also proved twelve fruits at the same time.0

Her battle record was illustrious and not inferior to Titanic Conqueror’s in the slightest - defeating Dao and Heaven Alliance, assaulting Celestial Court, and entering Immortal Dao City.0

However, her background was different and mysterious. Some said that she came from the Ten Great Mountains while somehow still having the freedom to travel outside.0

Her debut on the immortal continent was one of domination. Imperial Field had no leaders after Grand Dao War since everyone disappeared inside High Heaven Aegis.0

Of course, it still had top emperors and monarchs including apex ones, but none took the mantle of leadership.0Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

She arrived at Imperial Field and lived reclusively for a period before taking charge.  Perhaps she had gained knowledge of Imperial Field’s mysteries or been recognized by the previous leaders. 0

No one had a problem with her claim because of her martial prowess. Today, she appeared to uphold Thousand Emperor Island’s authority.0

“Fellow Daoist Demon, you wish to stop me?” Titanic’s eyes narrowed.0

Demon revealed a faint smile resembling a blossoming lily - pure and beautiful without being overly flashy.0

“This is Thousand Emperor Island, not Celestial Court. Please return, Fellow Daoist.” She said firmly, leaving no room for question without being impolite and aggressive.0

Titanic focused her gaze; the weight of the entire continent pressed down on Demon. This caused the latter’s expression to become serious. A melancholic aura resembling the southern misty rain engulfed the area.0

“My admiration for the empress is like a never-ending surging river. I have heard of the suppression and today is a rare opportunity. I wish to see Her Majesty’s grace.” Titanic spoke with conviction.0

“The empress is not present.” Demon shook her head; her soft tone stood in stark contrast. Nevertheless, she didn’t leave room for anyone to question her stance.0

“There are vestiges and legacies still.” Titanic said: “I don’t come here often so I must visit Empress Star.”0

The two female cultivators had two contrasting styles. Titanic looked like a supreme existence capable of grasping the cosmos. Her very presence instilled fear into spectators.0

Demon, on the other hand, looked like a slender maiden standing before an unstoppable giant. This didn’t mean that her aura and momentum were inferior. Titanic couldn’t take one step forward without defeating her first.0

“Fellow Daoist, if you insist on entering, you must pass through me first.” Demon said calmly, showing no sign of anger or annoyance.0

“I’ve long wished to exchange some insights with you, Fellow Daoist. Shall we get started?” Titanic readily accepted the challenge.0

Demon sat down cross-legged, using heaven and earth as a qi board. She raised her hand and manipulated numerous dao laws.0

“Boom!” A domain appeared to isolate the road to Empress Star from the rest of the world.0

Celestial bodies surrounded her. As she sat there without an imposing aura, she still looked to be in complete control.0

“I will go first, Fellow Daoist.” Demon plucked one planet and moved it to a different position.5

“Boom!” Imperial laws morphed the star into a new existence and unleashed a dazzling radiance. This sequence changed the momentum of the region, entangling and confusing any potential opponent.0

To break free, one must comprehend the mysteries of this sequence first.0

Despite Titanic’s power, she had no choice but to join the match. She sat down as well, taking a look at the board and becoming trapped by the first move.0

The sequence never stopped evolving either, adding more and more puzzles to be solved.0

“Good move.” Titanic couldn’t help but exclaim, deeply impressed by the unmatched sequence.0

Her eyes gleamed with a golden light as she started a derivation process. Laws appeared around her and she morphed them into a qi piece.0

“Bam!” She infused the yin and yang into the piece before powerfully making her move.0

“Raa!” A golden dragon surged upward but was immediately surrounded by chains made from supreme laws.
