Chapter 5713: Ancestral Bone

“Stabilize!” The top cultivators of Imperial Field had no choice but to consolidate the arrays and abandon more islands.

The formation faced immense pressure from both Celestial Court’s armies and the unstoppable specters. It worked continuously to stop anything from getting close.

“Rumble!” The abandoned islands were taken down by the colossal monsters.

“Onward!” The armies of Celestial Court could breathe and regroup again since the formation was distracted.

“Keep on replenishing!” Imperial Field’s members utilized all of their vitality and energy to power the trees. The smaller area of effect meant higher lethality.

Thus, emperors and even gigantic monsters were taken down. Nonetheless, they were still re-summoned to the back by the horn of death.

It seemed that using the horn of death also required energy and vitality from Celestial Court, meaning that they didn’t wish to prolong this war of attrition.

This was evident by the increased frequency of the horn. As it gained more energy, something unbelievable happened.

The melody was one of death, the same for the aura stemming from the horn. However, ancient runes eventually appeared after a full activation of the horn. They wielded divinity, albeit faint. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As more emerged, strands of chaos energy appeared as well - the ones that could only be seen at the formation of heaven and earth. Despite their thin appearance, nothing in this world could cut them down.

Another sound eventually came from the horn - quiet enough to be overshadowed by the melody of death.

However, when one listened carefully enough, they would be able to hear whispers seemingly coming from children.

Given the setting, this was rather eerie. However, when one focused enough, the voice was not that terrifying. It expressed a sense of hopeful waiting...

This was akin to a child looking at the village’s entrance, waiting for his father to return after a long trip. He murmured to himself, praying for his father’s safety and swift return, hopefully with a gift...

Only those close enough could hear the whispers beneath the death melody.

It struck a chord with any powerful cultivators. They have lived for so long and were removed from their homeland and even family. They abandoned everything to go farther, hoping to obtain the dao.

If they were to hear the whispers of love from their children or to see them waiting by the door, perhaps they would want to stop their journey at last.

“Rumble!” An explosion came from the deepest crevices of Imperial Field.

Chaos rays of the highest level surged into the air and divine rings appeared next. A new world was being formed within their rotation.

“Boom!” The rings destructively pulsed across the region. In the center was a figure far larger than any emperor or colossal monster.

The immortal continent would only be a pile of dirt in his grasp. Everyone couldn’t help wanting to prostrate in reverence.

“The progenitor of the world.” War murmured.

The ancient ones from Celestial Court understood the significance of this figure. The horn’s whispers had somehow woken up Trinity Ancestor, the dead epoch lord.

“The ancestral bone is still there.” His allies responded.

In the small village, Immortal Emperor Mu Tian, Dhyana, Vajra Dao Lord, and others observed the figure, preparing for battle.

In High Heaven Aegis, Li Qiye couldn’t help but smirk.

Celestial Court wished to use the horn to wake up the ancestral bone but this didn’t mean that he would return to life or appear again.

Their mysterious guest, or the rebellious form of Trinity Ancestor, didn’t want this to happen lest risking demise.

Sure enough, dark beams resembling dragons coiled around the divine rings and the majestic figure.

“The darkness?!” Someone shouted.

“Imperial Field is hiding evil entities, they deserve death!” A commander from Celestial Court shouted, blaming everything on the enemies.
