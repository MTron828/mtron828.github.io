Chapter 5687: Perish Together

“West Bank!” West Bank Prime Emperor bellowed after seeing his clan being reduced to ashes. Six emperors, twenty-four dragon lords, and nine legions were destroyed.

He recalled the glorious days when they built the western front to stop Celestial Court. Countless clan members died after numerous battles but they remained standing.

Alas, this was their last stance, unable to handle the relentless assault.

“Activate!” He still didn’t want to give up and continued fighting.

Unfortunately, Resolute Conqueror prevented him from causing any damage.

Armament continued to send mighty weapons filled with murderous intent. The prime emperor had no choice but to raise his shield defensively, gathering the power of his dao fruits.

Nonetheless, cracks appeared due to Armament’s unending attack.

Resolute took advantage of this, raising both hands and smashing downward with the immensely of heaven and earth.

Finally, the emperor’s defense and shield crumbled, causing him to vomit blood. His enemies didn’t give him a second to breathe.

At the same time, Luminous had a difficult time dealing with Nine-wheel Dao Lord and War Ancient God, evident by his wounds.

“Clank!” A sword wielding despair appeared out of nowhere and locked onto him.

“Die!” Immortal Emperor Qing Xuan and San Dao also joined the battle.

One summoned an azure with an ocean of lightning. The other slashed three times in the blink of an eye, seemingly freezing time.

Three slashes combined into one - the result was a blinding radiance lasting for eternity.

“Celestial Strike!” War Ancient God focused his battle intent into an energy palm strike from above. The palm seemed to be engraved with countless exploding stars, making it look like a crashing galaxy.

Luminous’ primordial dao fruit couldn’t stop so many attacks at the same time. He became drenched in blood with some bone-deep wounds. Blood gushed forth from his pierced chest.

Nevertheless, his aura remained dazzling and the dao fruit still hung high. Chaos true energy continued to empower him in waves.

He roared and continued to fight the hopeless battle.

“Run, just run!” The paralyzed ancestors and cultivators on the ground couldn’t help but scream.

They wanted to rise and fight by his side despite knowing how futile it would be. They were willing to sacrifice their lives to offer whatever little support they could to him.

“Boom!” Only several moves were exchanged before he was struck by War Ancient God.

“Crack!” Nine wheels broke through his rib cages.

“Clank!” Just-once’s sword pierced through his body.

Immortal Emperor Qing Xuan’s azure descended and caused cracks to appear on Luminous’ head. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In spite of his deteriorating body, his primordial dao fruit remained vigorous, continuing to release dao laws to aid its master’s quest.

Survivors on the side of The People were moved to tears while watching his valiant effort. They didn’t wish for victory, only for their pride to run and survive.

“Conqueror, escape!” They screamed but this was easier said than done.

“Leave!” West Bank Prime Emperor shouted at him: “World Breaker!”

“Boom!” His strongest weapon known as Prime Seal erupted with power. He sacrificed his true blood and looked eager to bring the enemies down with him.

Armament and the others became startled and immediately went on the defensive.

“Buzz.” Resolute’s armor became resplendent, not to mention the blessing from Celestial Court.

Armament erected a heavenly wall while recalling all of his weapons.

The others also utilized their strongest defensive measure, allowing them to survive with injuries.

The pale emperor vomited blood, no longer able to fight. Nonetheless, he inspired Luminous to action.

“Eternal Luminance!” His broken body illuminated the entire immortal continent. He gathered his true blood and ignited them, also choosing to explode.

“Shit!” His enemies’ expression soured after seeing this.

Nine-wheel Dao Lord retreated with haste while protecting the back with his nine wheels and their heavenly dao.

Just-once appeared again and raised his sword, hoping to see a glimpse of survival and exploit it just like before.

War Ancient God roared and utilized the blessing of Celestial Court to the limit, surrounding himself with an expanse of light.
