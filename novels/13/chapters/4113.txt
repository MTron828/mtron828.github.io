Chapter 4114: Slash

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Boom!” The monarch became frustrated and leaped into the air for a dual-slash attack, splitting the water beneath.

Fiery sparks scattered everywhere as if a volcano was erupting. The rest of his men didn’t relent either.

It seemed as if they were hitting a steel barrier. Meanwhile, the island kept on spinning and forcing them back.

“See, Dark Dragon Island is not bad at all.” One cultivator said: “It has been worked on for millions of years now. If Dark Dragon Monarch and his men stay there, they’ll be just fine.”

“Yes, the situation looks unfavorable for Crimsondeath Monarch’s side.” Someone from the last generation analyzed: “The bandits from the other islands will come soon, he’ll be pincered then.”

“Not only that legion but Li Qiye’s group will be trapped too, the bandits won’t let such a fat sheep go.” A big shot added.

Everyone wanted a piece of Li Qiye’s pie, let alone the greedy bandits. Moreover, he was inside their territory.

Dark Dragon Monarch heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the successful defense. He laughed and said: “Crimsondeath, surrender and join us and we’ll drop this issue. We’ll even give you half of the spoils.”

He attempted to poison Crimsondeath to team up with him against Li Qiye. Moreover, having Crimsondeath join them would increase their island’s power as well.

“Stop daydreaming, attack!” Crimsondeath didn’t fall for it and continued attacking the island.

This wave of offense was still proven ineffective.

“Enough of this, help them.” Li Qiye waved his hand and ordered.

“Affirmative.” A voice came from the sky.

“Clank!” A resplendent sword glint manifested with the intensity of the sun, temporarily blinding the spectators regardless of their cultivation. They covered their eyes in pain.

A gigantic sword descended; its energies ravaged and divided the lake.

“Such power!” The neutral crowd shouted.

“Crack!” It slashed the island and immediately destroyed the defensive line.

“Who is it?!” Dark Dragon Monarch bellowed in horror. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The massive sword suddenly split into actual cultivators. They had a cold aura, looking like unsheathed swords ready to deliver a fatal blow.

There were only several hundred or so. A middle-aged man also showed up at the same time. He wore a traveler’s robe, looking a bit yellow and sickly.

He was none other than Tie Jian. The other sword users were members of his sect - elites among elites and battle-hardened.

“Kill them.” He coldly uttered and didn’t join the battle.

“Clank!” Sword glints and images filled the sky again. An ocean of grand dao appeared above as numerous slashes rained down on Dark Dragon Island.

“Go!” Dark Dragon Monarch led his men to battle.

“Ahh!” Unfortunately, the bandits were far weaker than the elite swordsmen. This resulted in a bloody massacre.

“Here’s our chance!” Crimsondeath Monarch took advantage of the barrier being down and joined the battle with his men.

It became a one-sided massacre; a reversal seemed impossible.

Tie Jian’s men were particularly impressive, decapitating one demon after another. Their battle spirit was considerable and frightened the spectators.

“Who are they?” This question popped up.

Crimsondeath’s legion was already impressive enough, being on the same level as those from first-rate sects.

However, this elite force was far superior. It would be extremely difficult for any sect to have something as deadly.

“Only the behemoths can train such elites.” One ancestor’s expression darkened.

“It must be nice to have money. How much has he spent so far…” A clan expert said with envy.

Sure, the behemoths such as Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel Citadel could have disciples of this level. However, they would only work for their own sect.

On the other hand, Li Qiye only became rich recently. There was no way he could train this elite force in such a short time. Thus, everyone believed that he had paid a sky-high price for them.

“This seems a bit familiar.” One ancestor commented, thinking that he had seen the swordsmen’s style before.

Blood flowed like rivers in this one-sided affair. The bandits no longer put up a fight.

“Boom!” After a direct exchange with Crimsondeath Monarch, Dark Dragon Monarch smashed into the island, causing it to shake violently.

He turned to flee towards another island to seek reinforcement, aware of how grim the situation was.

“I don’t think so.” Tie Jian saw this and grabbed his sword.

“Clank!” The spectators couldn’t even see his swing but a mighty slash was indeed coming for Dark Dragon Monarch.

The frightened monarch turned around and raised his spear for a parry.

“Clank!” The spear was cut in half without being able to stop the slash from hitting its master.
