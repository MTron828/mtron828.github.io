Chapter 4826: Ace Card

“Rumble!” The massive creature running with its short legs seemed rather comedic. However, its speed was anything but.

It crossed through one domain after another and appeared in front of Li Qiye for a peck. Unlike Undying Lord’s lance where each thrust was virtually silent, Da’s beak encompassed immense physical strength.

This was as simple as a chicken trying hard to eat grain. It had no reliance on the grand dao - only pure strength and toughness. This beak could be considered an ultimate weapon on the same level as an epoch paragon artifact.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Each peck caused fiery sparks to go everywhere. They fell and turned the ground or mountains into a lake of lava. Terrible gales also emanated from the impact point, strong enough to blow peaks away.

This was an utterly different method from Undying Lord’s attack. Shockingly enough, the peck managed to leave behind a shallow mark on Corporeal Zone. This, at least, made success seem possible.

This was a testament to Silly Da’s destructive power. No wonder why it demolished an entire epoch by just pecking and swallowing.

Unfortunately, the shallow marks didn’t last for long. The dao runes on the wall pulsed brightly and washed away the marks immediately. 

Undying Lord shuddered after seeing this.

“The nine Heavenly Treasures live up to their fame.” An overlord commented.

Nonetheless, this was still a product of Li Qiye’s power. The nine treasures were obviously incredible but the user mattered just as much for the overall efficiency.

“Brother Da, your beak is second to none. You have to go all out in order to break Corporeal Zone.” Undying Lord said. He thought that the only way to get through this wall was with Silly Da attacking in a frenzy. Eventually, this should leave a hole before recovery.

Alas, Silly Da stopped pecking afterward and stood still again.

“Brother Da!” Undying Lord urged but the creature has fallen into a dazed state again.

He regretted praising his ally and thought that he should have kept his mouth shut. The situation became difficult since Li Qiye was still recovering. Once the heavenly injuries were gone, Li Qiye would come to settle the score with them.

“Brothers, this is the decisive moment.” He had to urge the three other overlords.

Alas, they were held back by Primeval Old Ghost, Triune Immortal, Tantai Ruonan, and Supreme Monarch.

“Brother Dead Immortal, why are you still holding back? It is time for you to turn the tides.” He repeated.

Though they were fighting fiercely, Triune Alligator Lord and Lord of the Deeps still glanced over at Dead Immortal.

“I’m not holding back.” Dead Immortal responded while still fighting.

“Your death incantation can settle this.” Undying Lord revealed.

“You’ve been waiting long enough.” The abyssal lord didn’t hold back either.

They weren’t friends and didn’t trust each other. Therefore, they all kept their secret moves just in case.

Alas, they have made their move and needed to take down Li Qiye. This became an existential crisis.

“The death incantation requires an exorbitant price, I shouldn’t be the only one paying, correct?” Dead Immortal no longer hid it.

“It’s time to be honest and reveal our cards.” The alligator lord shouted back.

“So be it, let’s go all out.” The abyssal lord agreed since they had no other choice.

“We need Brother Dead Immortal to hold them back.” Undying Lord said.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Possible, but I need epoch true blood to support it.” Dead Immortal named the price.

“I have no problem with that.” Undying Lord got straight to the point. Priceless true blood of the epoch level soared out of his forehead.

A primal power assaulted the nine firmaments instantly. It came together to form a bloody ruby. It flew and embedded itself into Dead Immortal’s body.

“It’s settled then, we’re starting.” The other two lords also offered their epoch true blood.

This represented longevity so they were giving up a part of their lifespan to Dead Immortal.

“We have to kill him now!” Old Ghost shouted and used his strongest attack to kill Dead Immortal. Alas, it was stopped by the others.

“Obey my call!” Dead Immortal roared and turned into a death incantation.

“Not good!” The hidden overlords trembled in astonishment and immediately backed off.

“Boom!” A coffin made from ancient death runes flew out of Inner Wild and exuded a terrible curse.

Curses and merit laws were different forces. The latter had a hard time blocking the former.

“Death Incantation!” Dead Immortal roared.

“Creak!” The coffin slowly opened.

The triangle of temporal flows suddenly crumbled. All three overlords returned and the duplicates disappeared.

Triune Immortal, Supreme Monarch, and Tantai Ruonan immediately gave chase.

“Don’t!” Old Ghost yelled at them before raising his hatchet in front of him for a defensive seal: “Guard!”

“Boom!” His temporal flow turned into a barrier to protect the three women who realized the gravity of the situation.
