Chapter 4066: Threat

“Should be me if there isn’t a second legacy.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hahaha, good, we didn’t find the wrong person then.” The two exchanged glances then one of them laughed.

“Kekeke, brat, do you pick life or death?” The other smiled sinisterly.

“Elaborate.” Li Qiye calmly responded.

“Death comes easily, we just need to bite your neck. Kekeke, of course, you won’t die that easily and will become a moving corpse, our puppet.” The second revealed his sharp fangs.

Liu Yushang shuddered since he had heard about these two before. Some believed that it was better to die in battle than be bitten by them.

Their evil technique drained their victims dry on top of turning them into a puppet. The dozen cultivators earlier were the perfect examples.

“If you want to live, then hand over everything you have. We’ll be merciful and spare your dog life.” The first smiled.

“How boring, the same old song again. What’s the point of becoming the richest when you look like that? Have you looked in the mirror recently?” Li Qiye shook his head.

The two exchanged glances. Their eyes flashed fiercely, clearly infuriated.

“Hahaha, brat, because of your foolish comment just now, we’ll have you taste a fate worse than death. You’ll be a corpse for an eternity.” One of them threatened with a murderous glint.

“No need to rush it.” The other smiled cruelly: “We need to torture him first, let’s just take our time.”

“Brat, today is not your lucky day.” The two exchanged glances and walked forward, wanting to surround Li Qiye.

“Young Noble, please get inside first.” Ning Zhu raised her sword defensively and blocked the duo.

“Little girl, you’re not bad but still no match for us. Out of consideration for Pineleaf Sword Lord, we will not bully you today. Leave now.” One of them smiled at Ning Zhu.

“We’ll see about that.” She maintained her composure while gesturing with her sword.

Liu Yushang didn’t want her to get hurt by the renowned masters. He stepped forward and shouted: “Count me in.”

He looked back and told Li Qiye: “Li, we will save your life today so you’ll have to write off the bet later!” He still didn’t forget about trying to save the princess.

“Hahaha, how interesting.” The duo exchanged glances after seeing this.

Li Qiye waved his hand and pulled Ning Zhu back before answering: “Does it look like I need to be saved?”

Yushang became frozen. How could Li Qiye face these two monsters alone?

Li Qiye turned his focus towards the duo and smiled: “Do you know the true origin of your progenitor?”

No one expected Li Qiye to suddenly bring this up. The duo was indeed from the Blood Race but they didn’t have anything to do with the progenitor.

“What does that have to do with anything? Brat, accept your fate.” One of them retorted.

“Very well, it’s time for you to see what is called the Blood Progenitor.” He smiled.

“You think you can become the Blood Progenitor given your meager cultivation. Are you hearing this?” The duo burst out in laughter as if this was the most hilarious thing ever.

“Watch.” Li Qiye smiled before slightly cutting his finger, just enough to draw a little blood.

“Buzz.” His vitality and blood suddenly turned into evil energy.

He seemed to have succumbed to the evil path and a rune appeared on his forehead.

“Devil Mantra!” Liu Yushang recognized this right away.

Ning Zhu heard him and became startled. The seven mantras were the easiest to cultivate. This also made them the least popular for cultivators. Why did Li Qiye pick something like this?

Liu Yushang recognized it right away because he came from a small sect. They didn’t have top merit laws so they collected common ones from all over the world.

As for Ning Zhu, she most likely had never seen any of the seven before.

“Hahaha! This brat thinks he’s the Blood Progenitor just by using the Devil Mantra! We’ll teach you a lesson for overestimating yourself!” The duo laughed again.

Yushang shouted: “Your Devil Mantra can’t take them on. They’ll suck you dry right away!”

He wasn’t trying to belittle Li Qiye. The weak merit law was one thing but Li Qiye’s cultivation wasn’t on the same level as the duo.

“I’ll take care of this ignorant brat.” One of them stepped forward.

He activated his vitality and a pair of blood wings manifested behind him. His eyes became bat-like, looking quite intimidating.

“Let’s see the taste of your blood.” He revealed his fangs again and licked his lips.

Spectators would feel a chill by their neck as if they had been bitten.

“Idiot.” Li Qiye chuckled and became serious. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In the next second, he suddenly turned into someone else; his eyes became filled with blood.

The evil energy around him turned into layers of blood mists. His appearance also changed into that of a supreme devil - red from top to bottom. His body seemed to be made from congealed blood.
