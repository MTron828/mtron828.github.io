Chapter 5182: Pick A Lotus Flower

Li Qiye left the courtyard and saw a large bear laying outside. The moment it saw Li Qiye, it approached and bit on his pants, seemingly wanting to follow him.

This was none other than True Bear Conqueror who had lost his human form. He had been following Li Qiye since Immortal’s Peak and finally caught up just now.

“Fine, we can travel together.” Li Qiye patted the bear and smiled.

“Raa!” The bear lifted its head and roared happily.

Meanwhile, the old man in blue also tagged along, still wearing the same sign.

Li Qiye stopped and looked back, prompting him to raise the sign.

“Want to sell yourself?” Li Qiye said with a smile.

The old man nodded repeatedly, seemingly wanting nothing more than to be sold to Li Qiye.

The latter took out a few silver coins and tossed them toward the old man: “Alright, I can’t keep on refusing. I’ll buy you.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The old man caught the coins and excitedly put away the advertising sign. He lowered his head and said: “Your servant greets you, Master.”

The bear stared at the old servant, seemingly on guard on top of being confused since it couldn’t see through him. Keep in mind that True Bear had three dao fruits now.

The group traveled southward. The old man walked behind them, looking rather relaxed as if he had been doing this for several thousand years now - just another servant from Li Qiye’s mansion.

They visited the southern region of the city - a place with beautiful landscapes and special fragrances known as Alchemy Dao - one of the most influential powers and contributors of Imperial Attendant.

Most sects had something unique about them - a special aura or transcending energy. As for Alchemy Dao, it resembled a flower blossoming quietly.

There were alchemy gardens everywhere with grass dormitories for the disciples. The sect was known for its pill-making and healing prowess. Its agricultural mastery was second to none as well.

In the upper continents, eighty to ninety percent of all expensive pills and medicines came from Alchemy Dao.

Its prestige traveled far in the river of time; its members were a part of all the great wars. This was especially true for Heavenly Sage Yuan who had saved numerous emperors for The People.

She preferred to be known as an alchemist and a doctor. Alas, she gained the title of “Heavenly Sage” because the emperors she had saved addressed her with this title.

She worked with City Lord Zi Yan and the others to establish Imperial Attendant City.

During the war known as Grand Dao, it was said that she expended all of her energy into supporting and healing her allies, eventually leading to her death.

Nonetheless, Alchemy Dao inherited her legacy and continued to prosper, retaining the respect of top cultivators.

As the group walked through the fields to the main gate, they saw a constant flow of people entering and leaving. Among them were powerful cultivators and even mortals.

The disciples of Alchemy Dao numbered in the millions. They provided medicine for cultivators but also treated mortals.

After passing through the main gate, security became stricter since this was the inner mountain. The alchemy medicines and plants here were precious, not to mention the finished elixirs and furnaces. Thus, it was no longer as accessible as before.

A disciple immediately came over and inquired Li Qiye the reason for his visit. He honestly answered: “I’m here to pluck a lotus flower.”

“A lotus flower?” The disciple was surprised at first before answering: “I don’t think we have lotus flowers here, please try another place.”

“No, it’s definitely here, and only here.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Could you elaborate? What is the exact type of flower you’re looking for?” Another disciple asked with a changed expression.

“The one growing right up there.” Li Qiye pointed at the highest place of Alchemy Dao where ten peaks or so gathered together like the petals of a blossoming lotus.

“Our ancestral lotus?!” One of them blurted out.

“The Exalted Cascade Lotus!” The first disciple shouted.

“So that is its name, then yes, I just want one.” Li Qiye smiled.

Disciples nearby rushed over and grasped their weapon, ready to unsheathe right away.

A third disciple stared at Li Qiye and said: “Fellow Daoist, your joke is not funny. Please be respectful.”

Their strong reaction was warranted. These lotus flowers were their ancestral inheritance. With the plant’s existence, the effectiveness of all aspects relating to alchemy was boosted.

Rumor has it that it was planted by Heavenly Sage Yuan herself. Another legend said that after passing away, she transformed into the plant.

Either way, the plant was priceless and could be viewed as the very foundation of Alchemy Dao. Moreover, it took eras for one lotus flower to form.

Now, an outsider wanted a flower? This was a blatant provocation.

“I’m not joking.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand: “And I’m not here to negotiate either, I’ll leave after taking one flower.”

This nearly drove the disciples crazy.

“Fellow Daoist, what are you trying to do?” A disciple said while giving an eye signal to his peer to go seek reinforcement.

In reality, he wisely enough assessed the situation - the enemies consisted of two men and one bear.

The one making the unreasonable request appeared ordinary enough, the same for the old servant. On the other hand, this bear looked intimidating and powerful.
