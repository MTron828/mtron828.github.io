Chapter 4677: Primordial Union

“Boom!” The fist suddenly turned into a claw, reaching for the sky. Each finger spanned ten million miles. The tips were sharp, capable of piercing the heart of the toughest cultivator.

Everyone felt the world being torn apart by the mere formation of the claw. They looked down at their belly, hoping to find it intact due to an unbearable pain sensed below. It spread to the rest of their body, leaving them in agony.

The sky was torn asunder with explosions everywhere. Stars started falling down like the scene of an apocalypse.

The claw simply destroyed everything in its way including celestial bodies. Large meteors and remnant pieces fell down and left long trails behind them.

Cultivators bellowed in horror. Once the rain of stars hit the ground of Worldbreaker, lava and flames took over.

Many big shots regained their wits and started running, no longer interested in the fun.

“This is the price of greed.” An ancient pair of eyes in Inner Ruins observed the show.

A different force manifested into this dimension - one capable of crushing the six dao and even true immortals. This was the absolute apex.

The ancient ancestors including Cosmic Lord felt their knees buckling. Though they were considered unbeatable ancestors, they were nothing compared to this ultimate power.

True chaos energy came together to form a peerless palm strike. Its target was none other than the incoming claw.

The latter already possessed a dreadful amount of destruction. Unfortunately, everyone heard an echoing crack after the palm descended and crushed the fingers of the claw.

This force immediately suppressed everyone. The ancient ancestors from the alliance dropped to the ground, unable to resist.

“Ahhh!” Countless fist slaves instantly died from the attack.

Once the dust settled, everyone saw a gigantic crater in the form of a palm. All the buildings belonging to the fist slaves were reduced to ashes.

Mouths were wide open because they all knew the unstoppable power of Worldbreaker’s fist intents. Both top masters and supreme geniuses didn’t dare to oppose them since it would be suicidal.

The amalgamation in the form of the claw earlier was insane. Cosmic Lord himself had no chance of stopping it. Alas, today, they witnessed something even more frightening.

“Talk about not knowing your own limit.” In an unknown abyss, a pair of eyes stared at the sky vault and commented on Worldbreaker’s folly.

Some of these eternal overlords also desired the item since it could let them live for generations to come. However, in the course of history, they merely observed and didn’t take action.

Today, the chance appeared in Worldbreaker and it couldn’t resist the temptation. The result was clear - Worldbreaker’s combined power was obliterated.

“What the hell was that…” Cultivators were scared out of their mind, trying to absorb this new piece of information. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Worldbreaker was already untouchable yet whatever left this palm print was far stronger. Remember, even dao lords and the wise sages never managed to take Worldbreaker down.

“Is this the mightiest force in existence?” One expert murmured.

The ancient ancestors stood there in a daze. They thought that they had reached the height of cultivation. Now, they found themselves to be squirming at the base of the mountain again just like worms.

“It has to be… it has to be…” An ancestor agreed.

“Look up!” They then saw a gate in the sky after the expanse of chaos energy dispersed.

This gate seemed to be carved out of the roots of a sky-blotting tree. Behind it were majestic stars and mountains with no end in sight along with an endless stone pathway. Each step of this pathway spanned a thousand miles.

“The gate to the Primordial Union is opening!” Young cultivators had no idea but an ancestor shouted.

“Why is it appearing in Worldbreaker…?” An ancient ancestor became confused.
