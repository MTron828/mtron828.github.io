Chapter 4357: Seeing The Beggar Again

By this point, numerous ancient ancestors from the three branches have awakened. Discussions sprung everywhere in the city.

“Is this another treasure bestowment?” One cultivator quietly asked after seeing the violent phenomenon.

Though peace has returned to the city, people couldn’t help talking about this matter due to the perceived significance.

“Could it be a supreme weapon? Or an invincible merit law?” A peer added.

“A treasure bestowment doesn’t have this kind of phenomenon.” An older expert from the previous generation answered: “This is unprecedented.”

An ancestor from one of the three branches joined the conversation: “I’m sure there’s a reason for something like this to happen.”

The top ancestors were aware that such an impressive phenomenon carried a proportionate level of significance. Of course, whether this was a blessing or a disaster remained unknown.

“Didn’t a phenomenon happen when Myriad Eyes Dao Lord entered the palace back then?” An old cultivator asked a senior.

The senior shook her head in response: “It was written so, a phenomenon occurred when the young dao lord entered, but it wasn’t anything like this.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Yes, not comparable in the slightest.” An ancestor responded: “The difference is so drastic. In fact, I wouldn’t even call that a phenomenon after seeing this one. According to our records, the young dao lord’s exceptional abilities granted entry to the palace. However, the light of the palace merely intensified. There was nothing like the violent quakes we had earlier.”

During the dao lord’s youth, the elders granted him entry to the palace. The moment he entered the entrance, the palace became bright and gave him a fortune. Some attributed his future success to this gift.

The truth was that all demons believed that being recognized by the palace meant having a great future. It could also grant gifts to brilliant disciples.

“Does that mean someone had just given birth to a great genius in the city? Or a future demon king?” Everyone started thinking about the possibilities.

“Not necessarily.” An older expert became worried: “It could be a disaster of sorts, the appearance of a genius doesn’t warrant this strong of a reaction.”

“I agree, the dao lord’s birth didn’t trigger anything, only when he entered the palace.” Another expert responded and remained skeptical.

“Well, will there be an incredible reward waiting in there now? Maybe even the imperial laws of Space Dragon Emperor.” A young demon fantasized.

“It’s within the realm of possibility given the nature of that phenomenon earlier. It is worth a shot.” A senior replied.

“Yes, we should try and enter.” One ancestor nodded.

Thus, the branches in the city encouraged their disciples to try and enter the palace, hoping to obtain the potential fortune awaiting within.

As for the members of Little Diamond, they were startled by the shocking phenomenon.

“Don’t tell me that’s an ominous sign.” One of them said, not wanting to face another crisis the moment they got here.

“It’s fine. Plus, the great demons in the city will take care of any potential problem, it wouldn’t be your turn.” Li Qiye smiled.

The young ones exchanged glances and wholeheartedly agreed. Given their power, they didn’t have the responsibility to deal with anything. The demon ancestors should have everything under control.

“Right, I worried over nothing.” The guy chuckled.

“It could be an auspicious sign too.” Elder Hu stared at the palace and said: “I heard Myriad Eyes Dao Lord’s entry to the palace sparked a phenomenon.”

“Elder, how do we gain entry to that palace?” Some became eager to try.

“I’m afraid we’re not qualified.” Elder Hu shook his head.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye said and moved on. The rest hurriedly followed him.

Alas, they didn’t get far before they met a beggar who stopped in front of Li Qiye. He was up there in age and wore a tattered robe with patches shoddily embroidered everywhere.

However, the terrible craftsmanship was understandable because they saw that he was blind. His eyelids were puffed up like two lumps of meat, only opened ever so slightly. Who knows the extent of his blindness, if he could see outlines when close enough?

His cheeks were down to the bones, sunken. His frame was as skinny as the bamboo stick he was holding. Just one gust of wind could send both flying. The bottom of the stick was bald; it had clearly accompanied him for a long time.

He carried a broken bowl with his other hand. It had several holes, perhaps picked up randomly from the street. Nonetheless, he seemed to cherish and cleaned it repeatedly with his robe. Not even a speck of dust could be found. Inside the bowl were a few coins so they clanked as he traveled.

This wasn’t their first meeting. Li Qiye and Lu Qi had met him back in Sword Continent.

“Please, kind sirs.” He came closer and raised the bowl. He narrowed his eyes, seemingly trying hard to see Li Qiye to no avail.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything and only smiled.

He gently shook his bowl to issue more clankings.

“Take it, buy something to eat.” A youth from Little Diamond took out some coins and placed them in the bowl.

This was nothing to cultivators. Alas, it was a considerable amount for a beggar in the mortal world. He could live for a long time without needing to worry about food and clothes.

However, the man turned a deaf ear to them and still kept the bowl raised in front of Li Qiye.
