“Let’s go!” The regular disciples were awfully excited.

This could be considered a triumphant return, especially after dealing with such powerful foes.

On the contrary, during the way back, Zhan Hu and Huang Ning didn’t say a thing, looking a little moody.

They thought that Li Qiye was too big of a threat. If this continued, Li Qiye would stomp on them again in the future.

It became apparent that he was winning people in the sect over. Many supported and liked him. Admiration wasn’t too strong of a word to describe their attitude towards him. The previous contempt was nowhere to be found.

Those who used to admire them were now admiring Li Qiye instead. The guy was on the verge of becoming the First Brother of the entire sect.

They realized that once Li Qiye became fully-fledged, they would stand to lose everything. Opposing Li Qiye then would mean certain death.

They exchanged glances at the exact same time and knew that they shared the same thought - Li Qiye must die. They would never be able to sleep well again before that.

Both were quite ambitious and sought greatness. Moreover, Huang Ning also desired Gong Qianyue.

Thus, Li Qiye became the biggest obstacle if they ever wanted to rule Divine Black.

Just think about it, a mature Li Qiye with Gong Qianyue would be unstoppable later on. Not only would Li Qiye take over, but their demon clans also might not be able to stick around.

No, all demons would lose their status in Divine Black. Humans would be in charge.

That’s why they came to a consensus of eliminating Li Qiye, whether it be for personal reasons or for the benefits of their race. They must do it as soon as possible too. Time wasn’t on their side.

Meanwhile, the rest was immersed in talking about Feather and the battles. They didn’t notice anything off about Zhan Hu and Huang Ning.

Li Qiye had a faint smile on the entire way. He didn’t make a big deal out of anything.

Gong Qianyue followed him back to his place after they made it back to the sect.

“Young Master.” Qianyue stared at Li Qiye who was sitting in his favorite chair again.

The experience earlier was incredible for her. The raging power of a dao lord brimmed through her body earlier. This force was simply irresistible and unforgettable. She tried her best to remain calm.

“Yes.” Li Qiye’s eyes were still closed.

“You haven’t taken the sword seal back.” She said.

He didn’t bother looking at the seal after giving it to her nor had any intention of taking it back.

Remember, this sword seal was priceless. There were more than one dao lord weapons in Divine Black but only one sword seal.

It contained the sword dao of South Conch Dao Lord along with other dao profundities. Thus, it could control any weapon left behind by him. Moreover, the power within the seal allowed her to use Feather earlier.

This seal could let one escape from their personal dao shackles and grant them immense abilities.

It was certainly more useful than any dao lord weapon. No one would want to return it.

Nonetheless, she knew that it was Li Qiye’s and would remind him even if he were to forget.

Unfortunately, she couldn’t remove the seal from her body. This was quite strange.

Li Qiye at the Bronze Tendon realm had no problem separating the seal from him and even imprinted it on her.

Those who haven’t experienced this magical sword seal had no idea about the difficulties in this task. She, on the other hand, knew just how powerful this sword seal was. It was refined from a supreme grand dao.

It became abundantly clear to her that removing the seal should be impossible. At the very least, she couldn’t do it. Their sect master couldn’t do it either.

So how did Li Qiye do it in spite of his shallow cultivation? That’s why she was shocked.

“You have been putting in effort serving me in the last few days. The sword seal is your reward.” Li Qiye opened his eyes for a second before closing them again.

He could control all weapons even without this sword seal. Obtaining it was just a coincidence after reaching the top of the steps.

South Conch Dao Lord left this precious artifact behind in order to reward a capable descendant - a special surprise. He put a lot of effort into refining this gift.

Alas, it was inconsequential to Li Qiye. He had no hesitation in giving it to Gong Qianyue.

“For me?” Waves of emotions overwhelmed her.

She had plenty of treasures, even a dao lord weapon like Feather. Thus, very few things could actually shock her.

This sword seal certainly did. She knew just how precious it was after a personal experience. It would allow her to control Feather on top of gaining a tiny portion of a dao lord’s power.

People would go crazy over this sword seal. The peak lords and even Ping Suoweng were no exception.

How could Li Qiye just give it away as if it was nothing more than a cheap souvenir?

“Thank you, Young Master. I will go through water and tread on fire for you.” She regained her wits and bowed deeply towards him.

The respectful gesture was more so about his generosity than the gift itself. It was an honor to follow a man like him.

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded and accepted her gesture. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He glanced at her and added: “An inborn true fate, not too bad. However, the shackles of the grand dao are still there. You need to develop your hidden potential in order to go further. This sword seal will do just that, it’ll bring out your hidden potential and make cultivation easier. However, this doesn’t mean that you can stop caring. You still need to fully comprehend the sword seal before using it to aid your cultivation.”

“I have memorized your teachings, Young Master.” She bowed again.

Li Qiye nodded and went back to relaxing. She made him tea and quietly served him.

After a while, she couldn’t help but ask: “Young Master, why are you here?”

Her master had asked this question before. At this point, she knew that it wasn’t about treasures or anything. He simply didn’t care for any of them.

She felt that he was a true dragon from above. One day, the great dragon suddenly decided to visit their sect.

She really believed that it was something like this.
