Chapter 4128: Covering Up?

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Moreover, his power was comparable to any sect master. He controlled everything on this island as well.

He bowed deeply towards Li Qiye then told the rest: “All the deeds pertaining to this island have my personal seal and can’t be faked.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Spectators glanced at the main parties. Earlier, that side-branch disciple swore that Xu Yiyun’s deed was fake. Now, the monarch was here to attest.

The disciple’s expression soured as he staggered backward. He didn’t expect the situation to deteriorate to this level.

In the beginning, everyone thought that Li Qiye was an idiot who got lucky. Thus, they sold their lands and treasures to Li Qiye at a ridiculous price, far higher than the actual valuation.

Li Qiye didn’t care at all and purchased the majority of the offers with the help of Xu Yiyun.

The sellers thought that Li Qiye was tricked and wouldn’t actually come to finish the transaction. In this case, the man shared the same thought.

His ancestral land on this island wasn’t worth much yet he sold it to Li Qiye for a high price. He thought that Li Qiye wouldn’t be able to come and get it either.

After all, this was Cloud Dream Lake - the lair of bandits. Moreover, even if Li Qiye did, he wasn’t afraid, being from Nine-wheel Citadel and all.

Now, the guy actually came for his tiny plot on top of bringing an unstoppable legion. He was scared out of his mind and started running away.

Of course, Xu Yiyun had traveled so far and wouldn’t give up so easily, hence the current situation.

“Miss Xu, do you mind if I check the deed?” The tortoise monarch asked Xu Yiyun.

Yiyun looked over at Li Qiye and was granted permission. She then handed the deed to the monarch.

He accepted and inspected it. “Buzz.” The deed scroll became brighter. The map of the island appeared with several bright dots - the location of the side-branch disciple’s ancestral branch. A seal of a crawling tortoise also lit up on the deed.

“It is real and the ownership has been transferred.” The monarch concluded.

The spotlight changed back to the side-branch disciple. Even Illusory Princess had an ugly expression. This conclusion was a slap to her face.

“No, this must be a mistake.” The disciple still denied the accusation.

“In accordance to the transactional rules of Tortoise Monarch Island, this deed formalizes Young Noble Li’s ownership of the respective plot.” The monarch ignored him and continued sternly: “Cloud Dream Lake is indeed a place for bandits and villains, this includes this island. However, there are rules here that must be upheld. Violation will be punishable with banishment, not only to the violator but also all kins.”

People quietly discussed the outcome but none tried to help the side-branch member. The rules of Tortoise Monarch Island couldn’t be broken. They were crucial for the island’s prosperity.

Since this side-branch disciple had violated it, he deserved the banishment. Pleasing Nine-wheel Citadel was not worth opposing the monarch.

The disciple was in disarray. Their properties have already been taken. Being banished now meant losing everything at the lake.

“Your-” He looked over at the princess only to be disappointed by her scowl.

“Unfortunately, this isn’t over yet. It’s not a matter of repaying the debt.” Li Qiye stared at him.

“What, what do you want?” The disciple staggered backward in fear.

“Those who welch must be made an example of. In your case, death.” Li Qiye lazily said.

“You’re out of line!” The disciple shouted.

“I have spent an outrageous sum buying stuff so if everyone tries to welch, I’ll waste too much time dealing with each one. As the saying goes, kill the chicken to scare the monkey. Don’t worry, I’m a merciful person who doesn’t believe in clan extermination. Kill yourself now and I’ll drop this issue.” Li Qiye revealed a bright and harmless smile.

The crowd had mixed responses - some thought that he was right while others felt that he was pushing it.

It was true that Li Qiye had bought many properties after becoming rich. Thus, forcefully dealing with issues might take a long time. Making an example of this disciple was a fine solution.

On the other hand, to kill someone over a matter of debt was quite extreme. Li Qiye had already taken back the land too.

“Don’t be ridiculous, members of Nine-wheel aren’t subjected to punishments and judgments from outsiders! You are trying to undermine our authority and prestige!” The disciple hid behind the princess and shouted.

“What authority and prestige? Not to mention Nine-wheel, even if it was Ten-wheel or Hundred-wheel, if someone from there dares to welch me, I’ll kill them even if they’re an ancestor or the sect master!”

“How dare you! Disrespecting us will result in death!” The disciple became bolder and stepped forward.

Initially, he thought the princess would definitely save him. But now, Li Qiye had disrespected Nine-wheel Citadel. This became a bigger issue.

“What did you say?” The princess’ expression changed. Earlier, her member was at fault so she didn’t say anything.

“I am saying that if your sect is foolish enough to cross me, I’ll annihilate you all.” Anyone else would have taken back their words but not Li Qiye.

“Ten deaths wouldn’t be enough, you deserve clan extermination!” The side-branch member jumped on this opportunity.

“This brat has balls of steel to make this claim.” One expert whispered.

To say such words in public meant starting an irreconcilable feud with Nine-wheel Citadel.

“Such impudence!” The princes could have dropped the issue with the side-branch member but this was unforgivable.
