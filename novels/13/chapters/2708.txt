“Ah!” Many in Immortal Lineage started screaming while twitching on the ground due to a terrible transformation taking place. Their body became crooked and warped, seemingly turning into dark beasts. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Rumble!” A monstrous hand stretched out of the ground in a remote region. The worms there turned into draconic abominations. They became hundreds of times bigger with tentacles all over.

In a different lake, fish surfaced and also started changing in a terrifying manner. Their fins turned into dark hands; bones grew on their back; their face became quite ferocious.

“What is going on? A devil ancestor is descending?” The top beings who could still maintain their dao heart became alarmed.

The oldest and most knowledgeable progenitor still found this scene terrifying. A forceful turning of this massive scale never happened before in Immortal Lineage.

Because of this, bells could be heard around many great systems. The clear ringing served as a way to calm the mind. Moreover, they sent out powerful progenitorial lights. Images of progenitors appeared as well on top of wise chantings.

The light and chanting expelled the darkness to stop the transformation process. The successful systems were the strongest in Immortal.

Nevertheless, the spread of evil continued across the world. It didn’t take long before Immortal turned into a nest with monsters everywhere.

The top beings didn’t know what to do. They couldn’t think of someone with such a frightening evil affinity.

Only progenitors could stay calm after protecting their dao heart. Certain powerful emperors were still affected, more or less. Alas, they all needed to hide out of fear towards the unknown.

“Activate!” Li Qiye roared and a path split open on his forehead, revealing a strand of sacred light. This single strand tore apart his body along with the area nearby.

“Pop! Pop! Pop!” The holy light swept away any evil intent and darkness, wanting to refine this affinity inside him.

It actually emanated from his dao heart and created the cracks on him.

“Buzz.” A buzz could be heard. It wasn’t that loud but everyone in Immortal Lineage clearly heard it.

The holy light poured down from the sky and permeated everything like mercury, reaching all the depths and crevices.

“Buzz.” Burning noises resounded everywhere, even on the living. The darkness and evil intents were being scorched by this holy light.

Thus, the nearly transformed cultivators and various terrains assumed their original state. The twisted body of experts became normal again.

Li Qiye’s dao heart was the source of all that is holy in this world. He turned into the hottest and most blinding radiance.

“Now it’s a saint...” Everyone wanted to get on their knees and join the light after sensing its purity.

The light was winning and managed to save people from the darkness. Even the devils would feel this power in their heart and surrender.

“A saint from an old era?” One progenitor wondered. He first thought of an ancient progenitor capable of exuding this holy light. However, this being was long gone now on the river of time. Thus, it has to be a different person.

He opened his heavenly gaze to look at the light source in order to figure it out. However, this holy light actually imprinted itself into his dao heart, causing it to waver.

This scared the living hell out of him so he quickly averted his gaze out of fear. The power of this light was insane. He might turn into a follower if he had kept on looking at it.

A progenitor giving in to the light? That would be something else.

What else could be spared from its holiness then? It was capable of turning all of Immortal Lineage into a land of bliss in the blink of an eye. From another perspective, it was no different from the evil affinity earlier.

An ancient mantra came out of Li Qiye’s mouth. It echoed across the world and nearly flipped the river of time over.

In this blink of an eye, the darkness that had disappeared in the river of time emerged once more and sent out offensive waves.

It resonated with the darkness in his body so popping noises could be heard. The dark flames around him ignited again, intending on taking his dao heart and body. This ambush seized the upper hand and started to extinguish the holy light.

With that, the living beings suffered the same devilization process - fangs, bone spurs, fur...

“Not again!” The powerful masters had to flee once more while trying to remove the darkness.

“Ah!” The weaker cultivators and ordinary living beings had no choice but to suffer this torturous transformation.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” A series of metallic ringing came next. Far up in the sky vault were three great maelstroms releasing twelve laws.

“Hmm...” The spectating progenitors didn’t recognize them at all.

“Clank!” These Primordial Wills instantly locked Li Qiye’s dao heart and the darkness within.

“Boom!” While everyone was still confused and horrified, the holy light suddenly exploded.

The light was already explosive and powerful before but now, it intensified to a whole new level. This was all of the holy lights in history exploding at the same time.

It resembled a world-ending flood washing over Immortal Lineage. The deepest abysses and most reclusive corners of darkness were still instantly illuminated.
