Chapter 5039: Calling The Soul

The world was once so beautiful to Ming Shi. Now, she found it to be far darker.

“This is all your fault, I can’t eat anything from now on.” She complained.

“This is just the norm, you haven’t been exposed to them before. Now you have.” He chuckled and said.

“I don’t need this crap.” She snorted.

Meanwhile, Yunyun was sitting down and staring at her empress dowager’s corpse. She spent all of this time and effort searching for her, wanting her to take charge of Primal. Alas, this was all in vain. 

No one could fix the issues in Primal now. That thing might be lost forever as well. This left her lost because she no longer had a goal in mind.

The thing keeping her from crumbling down due to the pressure was the hope of finding the empress dowager. That was the way to reunite Primal again. Now, the only path has been blocked. Despite her exceptional talents, a single tree was not a forest.

“It’s not over.” Li Qiye sat down next to her.

Her eyes turned bright as she immediately asked: “How so?”

Li Qiye glanced at the corpse and said: “The culprit might have consumed her but the technique was yet to be perfected.”

“Are you saying… that the empress dowager can still be saved?” Yunyun suddenly thought that there was still hope because he was Li Qiye.

Li Qiye shook his head in response: “No, there is no reviving the dead. Doing so is declaring war against the heavenly dao, resulting in a tribulation like no other. A minor punishment is death to the offender, a heavy one means dragging the epoch down with it.” 

“Then there is another method?” She asked.

“The divinity is still there inside her corpse due to the incomplete consumption.” Li Qiye said: “This strand of divinity is extremely weak, you have little time.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It sounds like you’re trying to summon her soul, Young Noble.” Ming Shi became curious.

Li Qiye chuckled and said: “Not quite. A dragon lord’s divinity contains many things, such as power and divine intent. The problem is the difficulty with awakening them. Moreover, it requires precision since time is limited in order to grasp vital information.”

He then glanced at Yunyun and continued: “You must grasp the opportunity. Otherwise, everything will really be in vain then.”

“What should I do to communicate with this divinity in time?” She had never done something like this before.

Goldcrest joined the conversation: “And how can she make it so that the divinity would recognize and accept her, given the time limit?”

“Good questions.” Li Qiye nodded: “In this case, it is dependent on whether the empress dowager has a strong impression of you in her memories. Her divinity might still acknowledge you.” 

“I don’t think so.” Yunyun said because it was Black-dress Lady who took care of her, not the empress dowager.

“Then you must somehow make it recognize you in the shortest possible time.” Li Qiye said.

“What are my next steps?” She took a deep breath.

“First, gain the divinity’s recognition and acceptance. Next are the questions, and this is crucial. If you ask the right thing, it will give you the desired answer.” Li Qiye said: “But if you can’t fulfill these requirements, the divinity will disperse.”

“The right questions and acceptance.” Yunyun pondered.

“This is your only opportunity and it will only last the blink of an eye. Let me know when you are prepared.” Li Qiye said.

Ming Shi and Goldcrest exchanged glances after hearing this. If they had to perform this task, what would they do to gain the divinity’s recognition? What were the right questions?

This was a difficult task due to the time limit.

Given her indignant death, her divinity would definitely answer any question regarding the culprit. However, did it really matter just knowing the culprit for Yunyun?

Did she have enough power to avenge the empress dowager? Unfortunately, this answer was clear.

“Young Noble, I am ready now.” After thinking it through, she took a deep breath and solemnly said.

“Good, let us begin then.” Li Qiye nodded.

Yunyun then kneeled before the corpse while raising the Primal Key with both hands. This was their heirloom - a symbol of status and identity. Any ancestor or regular disciple from Primal understood its significance.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye released an exuberant ray from his fingertip. It seemed to be alive.

He chanted and created a mudra in front of his chest. The others felt a yin wind flowing by afterward.

He released a majestic life force - the opposite of yin. The rays emanating from the mudra chased away the nether winds.

This holy force resembled the birth of a blessed infant - snow would melt and spring would return. All withering entities would be revived in preparation for an incoming golden age.

The corpses on the ground started glowing; their remnant divinity was being awakened. This process only lasted for a second.

Ming Shi and Goldcrest compared the glowing corpses to the stars above. The latter had nothing left and didn’t react.

This was a sign of imperfection. Whoever killed them didn’t devour them thoroughly like the world destroyer.
