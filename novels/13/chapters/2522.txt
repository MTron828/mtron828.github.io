Li Qiye’s overwhelming aura pervaded the area and Hanyu felt she had no place to hide.

It seeped into her very being, every inch of her body. She felt weak and utterly helpless. When his breath touched her neck, the heat invaded her and spread all over.

He had gripped her mind, disallowing her from refusing him.

During her formative years, those around her have always been respectful. Such insolence was out of the question. She has never been so close with the opposite sex, so this entire ordeal left her in shambles.

“I need to enjoy a demoness like you, to not waste the opportunity.” Li Qiye gently flicked his finger.

“Pop!” The buttons on her dress broke, one by one.

The entire process was especially slow, starting from the top. Her dress began to drape off of her shoulders.

This great beauty naturally had skin as fair as jade, especially tempting and comfortable to the touch.

“No...” The girl tried to pull up her dress but Li Qiye grabbed both of her wrists, holding her hands above her head and against the wall.

“No, just kill me.” Tears filled her eyes.

“It won’t end that easy.” He smiled in a gentle manner, but this gentle smile was full of danger and ruthlessness - akin to that of a tyrant!

His fingers traced down her soft skin following the slipping of the dress. It was quite elegant yet domineering, leaving no room for refusal and resistance.

“Kill me!” She started sobbing.

“No, you will enjoy the feeling of being taught, you will become the happiest woman from pleasure.” He smiled: “Being taught by me will be the apex of your life, the greatest of pleasure. From now on, you won’t be able to control yourself from loving the experience of squirming from pleasure beneath me and letting me do as I please!”

“No...” His voice rang next to her ear, full of temptation and masculinity. His breath by her ear made her sensitive, causing her to tremble.

Tears began streaming down her seductive face.

“Look at me.” It was an inviolable order.

She instinctively looked up at him, teary-eyed, and fell into silence. This old man was showing a rare expression - domineering and oppressive like a supreme, forcing anyone to submit before him.

His gaze immediately captivated her heart and imprisoned her mind. It was a bottomless abyss; no coming back out once fallen inside.

He was the invincible master of this world. The gods prostrated before his thrones; the myriad existences were under his whim.

This was the most powerful man in the world, capable of conquering everything. A girl like her could only submit before this absolute power.

She was lost before she knew it. Her dress was down by her ankles now, revealing her full figure.

Ample perfection; plump and round with the beautiful pink spots. Others couldn’t help but take their time enjoying them...

So Li Qiye’s hands started touching them.

“No!” She still had a sliver of reasoning and mustered power out of nowhere to stop him.

Unfortunately, his domineering aura erupted again with flashing lights in his eyes. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“No...” Her voice became softer, almost like a moan.

Under a round a kneading and ravaging, her soft bosoms became hard.

“Mmm...” She suddenly found her mind to be leaving her body; the latter no longer under her control!

It didn’t take long before he raised her up against the wall in a rough manner...

Meanwhile, Nine-linked Mountains was still overwhelmed by Li Qiye’s authority. Everyone kept their mouth shut.

His invincibility has taken over. He became a supreme that robbed everyone of their breath.

“Clank!” Suddenly, a sword hymn shook the world.

The sword light formed its own world and illuminated the realms. One sword finally flew the long distance and pinned itself inside Nine-linked mountains.

Everyone could tell that it came from Myriad Formation Kingdom.

“Eight Formation True Emperor...” The crowd realized the person behind this and instantly looked around.

“The emperor is coming, he’s really coming.” Murmurs sounded.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Countless divine swords rushed out of the kingdom.

They had all shapes and forms - ancient ones full of stains and spots. Some pulsed with divinity and fury...

They formed a net, seemingly wanting to pierce the entire world until total demise.

“Boom!” They emitted blinding radiance and murderous intent. Everyone in Nine Secrets could sense this.

“Such fury...” The spectators felt a chill after the bloodthirsty eruption.

Next, these swords rushed like the tides towards Nine-linked Mountains with extreme speed.

This resulted in a magnificent scene of countless swords converging and blotting out the sky.

It wasn’t only aiming at Great Desolate Mountain. They eventually scattered on the various peaks in this sect.

Moreover, after this first wave, another loud explosion occurred back in Myriad Formation Kingdom. Exuberant light oozed out like the opening of a treasure chest. Another wave of sword rushed to the air.

It didn’t take long before this realm was filled with lights and hymns of swords. More waves came in a never-ending manner, causing the crowd to gasp.

It looked like a rain of swords above Nine-linked Mountains. They kept on falling down and pinning themselves on the ground.

A terrorizing sword intent engulfed the sect; these energies penetrated deep into the bones in every location.
