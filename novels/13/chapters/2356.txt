Mu Shaochen stood up and looked at the mass: “If Falcon God is here, then we are ready to start the trial.”

“Unfortunately, Li Qiye isn’t here.” Someone else played along perfectly.

Shaochen’s eyes became serious: “If Li Qiye still isn’t here, then he knows he is guilty and doesn’t dare to face everyone. It’s not unreasonable to consider him a heretic deserving persecution now.”

People glanced at each other, understanding that the young lord wishes to turn Myriad against Li Qiye. It didn’t matter if the guy would come or not; the young lord would come up with different excuses until one stuck.

“That’s right, the coward must know he is guilty. He surely had cultivated the blood art, no need to be merciful towards someone like that.” An ancestor from Coiling Dragon said.

“I agree, maybe he wants to run back to Insane Court. We can’t let him run back to his lair and must mobilize now.” Members of Heavenstart and Sword Grave hurriedly added.

His supporters loudly shouted while the undecided systems couldn’t exactly refute. The latter stared at the untethered, waiting for her to say something.

If they were to voice their opposition, it would mean supporting Li Qiye and being implicated with him.

“It is not appropriate to declare a judgment before the trial. We should, at the very least, give him an opportunity to defend himself.” The untethered remained calm. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I doubt he will show up.” Mu Shaochen said: “Untethered, how much longer must everyone wait for him? We don’t need to talk about whether he’s a heretic right now since that seems to be clear. We need to talk about countermeasures right now!”

Shaochen aggressively declared his decision, wishing to shake the very foundation of Yang Radiance’s authority in Myriad Lineage. As long as the majority systems took his side, he would become the new leader.

“You’re rushing it right now, the event has only just begun.” The untethered was unperturbed.

“Young Lord Mu isn’t rushing it.” An ancestor from Sword Grave said: “We have been waiting for a long time now, this is giving the heretic a chance to escape.”

“Untethered, it is time to deliver a judgment, no need to play nice with a heretic. If you continue to be merciful, more lives will be lost as a result. Can you bear the responsibility?” Another from Vermillion Court said.

Numerous top systems have shown their stance and allegiance to the young lord.

The ones that have gained benefits from him such as Sword Grave were offering their full support and treated him as a leader.

As for the martial court, it was willing to pick him as well for immediate benefits but most importantly of all, he would eventually return to Imperial.

If they could surpass Yang Radiance right now, their system would become the new ruler after his departure in the future.

This was more than a trial; it was a battle struggle for supremacy of Myriad.

Mu Shaochen certainly came prepared to challenge Yang Radiance and had formed solidarity with his followers. This allowed them to seize the initiative and the upper hand.

As the atmosphere intensified, the sage and the untethered were strangely calm and didn’t bother to respond.

“We need to mobilize now against that heretic! He is clearly guilty, that’s why he isn’t showing up.” People kept on shouting.

“Very well.” Mu Shaochen spoke after gaining control of the event in such a short time: “We’ll send a search team so that he can’t escape.”

“Who says our Young Noble doesn’t dare to appear?” A cold voice sounded with two figures appearing before the crowd.

People looked over and saw two girls.

“It’s the martial goddess.” One was immediately recognized.

Wu Bingning and Ling Ximo have arrived at Myriad Peaks. Though there were numerous ancestors present, Binginng stood there proudly with her back straight.

On the other hand, Ximo was having a hard time, not daring to look at anyone. Nevertheless, she chose to stand by Li Qiye’s side.

“Bingning, you are a bride of the Mu and should mind your words.” Mu Shaochen didn’t become angry and slowly said.

She looked at him and uttered coldly: “You think too highly of yourself. You aren’t enough to earn my grace, someone else can be your clan’s bride.”

Shaochen’s expression turned a bit ugly. Ever since he came to Myriad, everything happened so smoothly until her disdainful words just now.

“How improper! You can’t act as you please in this important matter, come back to the sect with me right now!” Another ancestor from Vermillion Martial Court shouted.

“Ancestor, no need to pressure me with seniority.” Binging shook her head: “First of all, your status is inferior to Windchaser Matron. I didn’t come back with her, so why would I come back with you?”

The ancestor turned red as a junior challenged his authority. He declared: “Such impudence, I will take you back then.

“The martial court wishes to bully a junior?” Yang Radiance Buddha has been standing quietly behind the untethered. He stood up and said: “If you want to play, I’ll entertain you. No need to be so tough on a junior.”

“Does Yang Radiance wish to interfere with our internal affairs?” The other ancestor said with a heavy voice.

“No, but I do owe Miss Wu a favor, so if you want to take her against her will, you need to ask me first.” The Buddha heartily laughed.

He was quite brave standing up for Wu Bingning right now. Of course, he was referring to the hostage situation back then.

“Hmph, that wretched has joined the heretic, willingly choose damnation! She is not qualified to stand...” Cloudcrossing Princess said with disdain.

“Pop!” But before she could finish, a slap made her spit out blood.

“Who?! Show yourself!” She howled after being slapped before everyone.

“Consider yourself lucky that you’re still alive.” A lazy voice was heard.

This newcomer floated in the air, seemingly so nonchalant and carefree.

“Fiercest!” Many recognized this lazy tone even before seeing him.

“Li Qiye is here.” People looked over at the direction of the voice and sure enough, it was Li Qiye.

He seemed to be taking his time walking over, but in fact, he was moving with frightening speed and instantly made it to Myriad Peaks.

He stood there relaxed as if he wasn’t facing a great alliance but just enjoying his own garden. He was bereft of an imperious aura, but this leisure attitude made people shudder uncontrollably.

This was a being who had massacred numerous ancestors from three systems, definitely a monster.

His appearance caused a bigger stir than the young lord. Those who have witnessed him in action felt their palms becoming sweaty.
