Chapter 5702: Force Her Out

“Augmentation!” Resolute Conqueror shouted and a heavenly beam surged downward.

“Clank!” His armor plates were repeatedly molded and tempered with a lightning-speed process, each time stronger than the previous. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Finally, he was clad in an armor as large as a mountain. Each plate weighed billions of pounds. Every step he took shook the region.

He summoned a battle aegis, looking impenetrable. The heavenly beams still descended and empowered his defense.

This was the reason for his title - Resolute. It seemed impossible to force him to back down from a fight. His plan was to stop Genesis Conqueror’s slashes.

“Break!” Genesis unleashed another immortal slash. The sky was split open and chaos could be seen from the gap.

“Boom!” Fiery sparks emanated from the impact, looking like meteors.

“Crack!” Resolute’s shield couldn’t fully absorb the blow, on the verge of crumbling with countless cracks.

He staggered several steps backward and vomited blood.

“Again!” He mustered confidence once more, summoning the same heavenly beam to rebuild his armors. The broken pieces came together and formed an undamaged shield. Blood also returned to his body for a full recovery.

“Excuse us, Fellow Daoist.” Nine-wheel, War, and Armament joined the battle.

“Clank!” Nine-wheel combined his wheels together, creating a golden azure with a touch of Buddhist affinity and sending it straight at the opponent.

Just-once’s eyes flashed menacingly while thrusting his blade wielding the power of despair. Only death awaited the target; the glint of his blade resembled the god of death. It would not stop until a throat is pierced.

Armament roared and summoned all of his weapons in a row, creating a special domain. Each of them grew to the size of a star. They destroyed everything along the path, wanting to obliterate Genesis.

War’s black hair danced wildly in the air and his totems appeared. He was blessed by Celestial Court and cleaved his massive axe downward...

Their combined attacks horrified all living beings in Dao Domain, enough to sink the entire city.

“Can she endure?” Survivors didn’t know whether Genesis Conqueror could handle the insurmountable odds despite being empowered by Immortal Dao City.

Celestial Court didn’t give a damn about a fair fight, preferring to buy time for Luminous Conqueror instead.

“Rumble!” Genesis raised her hand and the immortal dao laws coiled around her defensively like a natural barrier.

If this wasn’t taking place in Immortal Dao City’s gate, the remnant waves would have destroyed Dao City. Only a heavenly treasure could withstand the unceasing barrages.

“Force her out!” Resolute fought fiercely despite being covered in blood, preparing to lose a shield and creating a new one each time.

The others worked with him and focused their firepower on only offense, attempting to buy enough time for him to get close enough.

Their goal was to force her out of Immortal Dao City - that would weaken the channel between her and the treasure.

Genesis, empowered by the city both defensively and offensively, never stopped slashing and inflicting considerable damage to all assailants.

However, War, Nine-wheel, and Just-once were blessed by Celestial Court as well, albeit not on the same intensity as Resolute. This allowed them to survive the slashes.

Finally, Luminous managed to prop the gate open with Momentous Frontier.

“Bam!” A heavenly chapter emerged, seemingly a last resort. With a loud click resembling the sound of a lock, the gate started closing again.

This prompted a response from the distant Celestial Court itself. A brilliant light surged from the area and illuminated the entire continent.
