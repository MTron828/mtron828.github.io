Chapter 5542: Young Master Shuangjian

“How can this be?” She staggered backward in astonishment.

Not to mention a mortal, even a six-fruit dragon lord wouldn’t be able to touch her dao without permission.

The sword dao was hers alone, gestating within her dao heart. Everyone else was considered an enemy, unable to reach it or risk being attacked.

In this case, her dao seemed rather intimate with him and hummed in resonance - something rather absurd.

“He has a sword heart, freed from desires and emotions, it starts and ends with the sword.” Li Qiye smiled: “This innocence and purity allow him to befriend and communicate with any sword dao.”

“This is a thing?” Qin Baifeng was startled by this incredible human. How did he obtain a sword heart without cultivation?

“A total infatuation with the sword.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I love them, but not the kind you can see.” He pulled back and told Li Qiye with a naive tone.

“Right, the invisible type.” Li Qiye nodded.

“You can see them too, right?” The man excitedly asked, referring to the dao of the sword.

This was beyond the reach of mortals yet he proved to be an exception. No cultivators would believe this story if told.

“Let me show you something nice.” Li Qiye grabbed a branch and started doodling on the granite slab beneath.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This slab was part of the temple so it was extremely tough. Alas, he wrote on it as if it was as soft as tofu, looking like a child drawing randomly or just exceedingly bad at calligraphy.

“Take a careful look.” He told the man after finishing.

The latter didn’t hear Li Qiye because he was engrossed again by the strange markings. He couldn’t escape even if he wanted to.

“How beautiful.” He murmured.

As for Qin Baifeng, she didn’t see anything outside of its appearance on the surface.

“This sword dao…” The stronger Niu Fen took a deep breath.

After hearing this, Qin Baifeng activated her heavenly gaze and derived the myriad dao. She finally saw hints of a sword dao hidden beneath the random doodles. This left her entranced as well due to its irresistible complexity.

“Okay, let’s go.” Li Qiye tapped on her shoulder and woke her up.

He shook his head and said: “This isn’t suitable for you, if you want to learn it, take your time doing so later.”

Having said that, he sent a ray into her forehead, imprinting a sword dao inside.

“Thank you for the gift, Young Noble.” She eventually regained her wits and bowed deeply.

“We’re leaving.” Li Qiye walked away.

“This brat should be polished.” Niu Fen stared at the man stuck in a zen state and said.

The cloud only glanced curiously for a moment before catching up to Li Qiye. Qin Baifeng, on the other hand, changed her perspective entirely.

She was considered a sword genius who had created her own dao. Alas, she realized nothing while staring at the doodles until Niu Fen reminded her. Understanding the embedded mysteries would take an exceedingly long time.

As for the man, he had never cultivated before yet he saw enough to be mesmerized by the sword dao - a testament to the gap between them.

This was the difference between a mortal and a six-fruit dragon lord. However, it was flipped around in this scenario. Niu Fen calling him one of the greatest sword geniuses in history was not an exaggeration.

First, she never expected to meet someone like him in the mortal world. Moreover, it would be a shame for him to never cultivate. If he had gotten the same opportunity as other cultivators, he might already be a conqueror right now.

“Young Master Shuangjian! The master wants you home to eat.” They heard someone calling for the man while leaving.

The man couldn’t hear the servant since he was lost in cultivation.

“Young Master, the master will be angry if you don’t come back now, eat first and then you can come out to play after.” The servant tried to drag the man away.

“There are some good seeds in this world.” Niu Fen couldn’t help but say.

“Good seeds might not sprout. There has never been a lack of genius.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re right, Young Master.” Niu Fen nodded: “There are too many temptations and cultivators can’t resist them either. Geniuses always enjoy success, not to mention greed and desire, just one failure can take them down forever.”

“They need to be polished as well. Otherwise, they might be able to smoothly obtain dao fruits but not maintain their dao heart.” Li Qiye replied.

“What happens when dao lords and other top cultivators fail to maintain their dao heart? Isn’t that just their personal issue?” Baifeng said, believing that apex cultivators had incredible mental fortitude.

“A minor case is self-destruction, a worse case leads to great harm to the world.” Niu Fen said.

“It’s always the latter. Only the weak will suffer alone, the strong wield the power to commit evil.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s true.” Niu Fen nodded.

Baifeng found this comment reasonable as well.
