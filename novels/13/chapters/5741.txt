Chapter 5742: Meru

Meru Buddhist Emperor hailed from Pure Land. Some believed that he was its founder.

Although the latter notion was incorrect, the region did prosper because of him. He started as a young monk and eventually learned enough Buddhist dao to gain incredible power through the dharma.

Other emperors relied on cultivation and the dao fruits to become powerful. He utilized Buddhism instead.

He didn’t focus on the intricacies of cultivation techniques or the dao, attaining enlightenment through Buddhist insights instead. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

During his era, most have heard of his resolute vow - I will not attain Buddhahood until hell is empty.

As he walked the world, he enlightened both mortals and powerful cultivators. This included dragon lords, ancient gods, and even imperial-level characters.

Buddhism prospered on the six continents due to his efforts. His influence couldn’t be overstated despite not having started a sect or an alliance.

It trended over the three major alliances at one point. Living beings became disciples of Buddhism; the world's laws were of this affinity.

Some emperors engaged in dao discussions and exchanged insights with him. A few had sparred as well and could maintain their dao heart. However, rumor has it that given enough time, he could convert anyone to Buddhism.

With one thought sprouted a seed that would become Mount Meru - a place containing three thousand worlds. His dharma-based technique frightened the land during his prime.

He visited all three alliances and spread the wonders of Buddhism. He left deep impressions on all the top cultivators.

They still remembered his appearance back then - a diamond-like body towering at an incalculable height, being the center of three thousand worlds.

Anyone who laid eyes on him would feel as if they were in a blissful paradise on the verge of attaining enlightenment.

Alas, the current Buddhist looked like an old fisherman beaten by time and weather. There was no visible trace of Buddhism until Demon’s intervention, forcing his radiance to burst forth.

He suddenly disappeared one day and the world stopped hearing about him. None would expect to see him here in Celestial Court.

“Did you join Celestial Court, Buddhist Emperor?” A dragon lord couldn’t help but ask.

Although this was a sensitive question, many had the same thought in their mind. Why else was he here in the celestial river? Celestial Court didn’t just allow anyone inside.

“No.” He shook his head: “They asked me to join but my aspirations lie elsewhere.”

“Why are you ferrying people here then?” Starflash Conqueror asked.

“Amitabha, this celestial river is boundless, where I cross myself and others. Three thousand worlds are but a speck of dust in comparison. If I can cross this river, I can enlighten anything else in existence.” He responded. [1]

“Buddhist Emperor, you’re attempting to convert this river? For what reason?” Vajra Conqueror also came from Buddhism.

“The river is the key to Celestial Court, separating the mortal and the otherwordly. If I can obtain Celestial Court, I will be able to enlighten all living beings.” He said.

“Incredible, you seem capable of traveling freely on this river, clearly having found its mysteries.” Ren Xian said.

“You’re too kind, Benefactor, I have only seen the bare surface. Otherwise, I wouldn’t need to be ferrying right now.” He placed his palms together.

Everyone exchanged glances - crossing

this river in the Buddhist sense was akin to gaining Celestial Court, being able to control a heavenly treasure. This was something beyond their capability.

“If everyone wishes to cross the river, I will offer my assistance.” He said.

“What do you ask in return?” Thousand-hand asked.

“Nothing, only to see if those who ride my boat are fateful with Buddhism. If they are, they will join Buddhism, otherwise, they can come to the other shore.” He revealed.

This made it rather clear - he could help them get past the river but they had to pass a test first.

Under normal circumstances back on the six continents, they would accept the challenge - testing their dao heart against his Buddhism. They could always give up before being fully converted, stopping the process.

The same couldn’t be said in this case given the unpredictable factors and his control over the terrain.

“Buddhist Emperor, why do you wish to enlighten us? We are here to attack Celestial Court, not join Buddhism.” Demon asked.

“Amitabha, it is because with everyone’s help, I might be able to cross this river. The world shall be as one afterward.” He said.

This made everyone think carefully. They preferred to die in battle against Celestial Court, not join Buddhism.

Two choices awaited them - forcefully crossing the river or accepting his test.

The risks between the two weren’t drastically different. The emperor simply had an absolute advantage on this river.

The only difference was that when failing his test, they would still survive, albeit unwillingly shackled by Buddhism.

“How ambitious, but unfortunately, you cannot cross the celestial river.” A leisurely voice interrupted their rumination.

Everyone looked over and saw a man strolling closer as if this was his backyard.

“Sacred Teacher, your reputation precedes you.” Meru Buddhist Emperor bowed.

“Sacred Teacher.” Everyone bowed respectfully in his direction.
