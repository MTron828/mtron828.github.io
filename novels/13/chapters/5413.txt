Chapter 5414: Destroy Heaven Alliance and The Race

Back in Duality World, an announcement shocked not only the illusory realms but also the upper continents.

Illumination Conqueror planned to sacrifice Ye Fantian at his grotto and invited everyone to participate.

Most were shocked to hear this news but as for the conquerors and dao lords, they worried that their biggest fear was actually happening. His enemies and previous allies understood that he was capable of going to such extremes.

Nonetheless, regular cultivators had differing opinions.

“This is what we should have been doing all along.” Someone who was a fan of Illumination Conqueror after reading about his legends said.

“Right, All-things and his Dao Alliance have done nothing but let The Race grow stronger and stronger. We have to be on the offensive.” Another added.

“Our land has been taken by them for generations now. Illumination Conqueror will lead us back to the glory days.” A different supporter echoed the sentiment.

“That’s right, only by destroying The Race would we have a place to live.” One supporter claimed.

“We are fortunate to have someone like him, he’s the only one who can take down The Race.” A powerful cultivator said.

“Start with sacrificing Ye Fantian to boost our morale, let The Race know that we aren’t to be trifled with.” Certain groups among The People became excited, feeling their blood becoming hot.

Not everyone shared this same thought. A big shot listened to their conversation and murmured: “Who knows if Illumination Conqueror will be able to lead The People back to its glorious past but one thing is for certain, another war will be disastrous for all. The top cultivators are fighting for pride and honor, not actual victory. What about everyone else who will have to suffer from the devastating battles? Will these cultivators try to hold back? No, they will unleash everything in their arsenal without thinking twice.”

“This is the start of the next war. Preparation is necessary to avoid being dragged in.” A wise leader became worried.

“Where do we hide? Haven’t we suffered enough from Emperors War already? The flames of war will ravage all six continents, only a fortress capable of withstanding imperial-level shockwaves will survive this.” Her ancient ancestor said.

The old survivors of Emperors War witnessed the sheer devastation that resulted when top cultivators went all out. They feared another war more than anything.

“Why the need for this? Just follow the Pact of Blessed.” A dragon lord complained.

Immemorial Epoch, Skysplitter, and Grand Dao War were more or less unavoidable. Both sides had no choice but to fight.

Afterward, a balance was reached and the aftermath of Emperors War allowed harmony and co-existence.

They just needed to follow the rules of the pact and everything would be fine. Only minor skirmishes between individuals and sects happened occasionally.

Alas, when the top cultivators stopped obeying the pact, it could lead to an existential crisis involving all six continents.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The pact is broken now. I see dark days ahead of us.” An ancient ancestor sighed and said.

“It’s so meaningless, we’re just fighting among ourselves while forgetting the true history. The People and The Race are so intermingled that the classifications are mere fabrications by Celestial Court.” His friend sneered.

On the other hand, supporters of Illumination thought of how to contribute to his cause.

“The right road to take is to destroy Heaven Alliance and The Race. We have to support Illumination Conqueror.” Someone said.

“He should lead Dao Alliance again. All-things Dao Lord is weak and useless, unable to contend against The Race. How many have they managed to kill?” Another added.

“The emperors and dao lords of Eight Desolaces are mere usurpers while Illumination Conqueror is the founder and true ruler of Dao Alliance. Maybe they are actually traitors who conspire with The Race to keep Illumination Conqueror down. I’m sure of it, they conspired to force his abdication in the past.” An expert speculated.

“Stand with him and chase away the usurpers. We shall rebuild Dao Alliance.” His supporters became increasingly vocal and active, wanting nothing more than to launch an attack against Heaven Alliance.

It seemed that Illumination’s influence remained at a relatively high level. Some had only heard of his exploits without being aware of the intricacies. They believed that he was the only one who could lead them down the right path.

One observer noted the unrest and commented: “As if Illumination cares about their support or feelings regarding this matter. He will do things just because he wants to.”
