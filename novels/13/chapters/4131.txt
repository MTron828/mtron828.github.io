Chapter 4132: Money Smash

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The teeth on the wheels made noises as if there were millions of blades cutting everything on their path.

Everything happened in a split second; some cultivators had a hard time keeping up. Even the ancestors were impressed after seeing this move.

They wouldn’t have enough time to evade it completely and would have to withstand the strike.

“Watch out!” A neutral spectator shouted.

On the other hand, the target of the strike simply smiled and took one step forward then shouted: “Activate!”

Once his foot stomped the ground, runic lines appeared on the surface and became resplendent. They traveled to the pile of refined jades and entered the individual jades.

“Buzz.” Space trembled once as the jades lit up and released chaos light and energy. The energy was awfully dense and tempestuous, looking like flowing liquid mercury. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Inside this expanse of energy was the start of a new world. The stars and celestials came first and created a gigantic entity made of chaos. This figure seemingly contained an entire cosmo.

The chaotic being roared and deafened the listeners. They dropped to the ground, paralyzed.

It raised its palm to deliver an ultimate strike. “Boom!” The fabrics of space instantly crumbled along with the seal of the princess.

This saved Li Qiye from his perilous situation but the figure didn’t stop there. Its palm continued aiming straight for the princess’ chest while crossing through space.

Her Void Wheel was considered one of the best techniques for controlling space. However, the spatial stability around her crumbled and she lost control.

She was shocked since the palm made it in front of her. She swung her treasure straight at it for a last-ditch attempt.

“Boom!” Alas, the Immortal Sovereign treasure was still not enough to stop the destructive palm.

“Crack!” The princess bellowed painfully and was sent flying. Blood splashed everywhere and the bones all over her body shattered.

“Ahh!” She flew out of Tortoise Monarch Island just like a shooting star. Her screams continued to echo until she was long gone from the horizon.

This left the crowd speechless. She had access to a Heavenly Scripture on top of an Immortal Sovereign weapon. This should be enough for her to defeat members of the previous generation.

Alas, the chaos figure easily took her down; her fate remained unknown.

This silenced the crowd. Earlier, many thought that victory was hers for the taking. However, Li Qiye changed this the moment he took out a dozen dao lord weapons or so.

Afterward, he changed his mind and took out refined jades instead. They thought that he was being suicidal by doing so.

Nonetheless, he proved them wrong by sending the princess on a vacation away from Tortoise Monarch Island. She didn’t have a chance to fight back at all before being decimated.

This was something one must personally witness to believe. No one else would believe in this ridiculous story.

People calmed down and stared at the pile of refined jades. They found cracks on the jades and their chaos energy had dispersed. These jades have become useless at this point, the same as rocks.

“What the hell was that?” One youth was astounded. He had never seen an attack like this before - using jades to fight. Moreover, the princess was a capable genius, not a nobody.

“The name is money fall.” An ancestor finally confirmed his suspicion and said: “It’s a magical technique created by the progenitor of the Tang. It doesn’t require merit law and energy, one just needs enough refined jades to activate it.”

“I’ve heard of this before as well.” Another expert nodded: “That progenitor relied on this method to defeat numerous masters. Rumor has it that he was really rich while having no cultivation to speak of.”

“What’s Li Qiye’s relation to the Tang?” Someone else asked.

“Right, didn’t he buy their ancestral ground?” An elder said.

“More than that, he managed to use an ancient formation left behind by their ancestors to defeat Ninth.”

“So they have to be related.” One big shot said: “That’s how he knows their secret technique.”

Everyone became curious. First, Li Qiye bought the plain and activated the Tang’s formation. This was something the Tang’s descendants couldn’t do. Now, he even used their ancient method - money fall.

Furthermore, both the progenitor and Li Qiye were insanely wealthy. Was this just a coincidence?

The crowd thought that they were from the same branch. The only thing different was Li Qiye’s last name. Otherwise, they would consider him to be a member of the Tang who has obtained their progenitor’s legacy.

“Money fall is truly magical.” Snowcloud Princess murmured.

Only a few have read about this technique before. They thought that it was only a legend since the premise was ridiculous. How could one win using refined jades alone?

Moreover, no one else inherited this technique afterward so it didn’t seem real. Today, Li Qiye showed them that it was an actual technique.
