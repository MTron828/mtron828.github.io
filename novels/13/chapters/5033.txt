Chapter 5034: Regarding Cannibalism

Cannibalism itself wasn’t a rare thing in the cultivation world. It was a world reigned by the strong and the weak were bullied.

However, Li Qiye made it sound rather serious - a conqueror eating other top masters.

“Why did this conqueror stop? In the past, it seemed to be every thousand years but I haven’t been hired for a while now.” Shadowrider asked.

“So you have thought about this.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, because this was a dangerous deal so I paid more attention than usual. I’m sure that the conqueror has been inactive.” He nodded.

“And that’s what we’re trying to find out.” Li Qiye smiled.

He was sure that something had happened for the conqueror to stop. This did interest him a little.

“Left for the upper continents?” He speculated.

“No, that’s not what I’m interested in. I don’t even care about who this conqueror is.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Then what?” He asked.

“Cannibalism.” Li Qiye responded, causing the assassin to tremble again.

The latter felt as if he was a delicious meal waiting to be devoured by Li Qiye.

“Don’t misunderstand, I don’t want to eat you. To be perfectly blunt, eating you is similar to eating a worm. You wouldn’t eat a worm, right?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see.” He understood the crucial point: “So this is refinement requiring a special merit law or method to truly be effective.”

“Correct, to put it simply, there are two goals.” Li Qiye said.

“What are they?” He became more and more curious since he was one of the participants.

“Either to increase power and energy or to prolong lifespan.” Li Qiye answered.

“Shouldn’t he use alchemy?” He said.

“The consumption of pills and alchemy ingredients are very particular, not every kind can be used at a given period. Moreover, refinement is an extremely profound art. Being a powerful cultivator does not make one an amazing alchemist without the proper mastery.” Li Qiye paused for a moment before continuing: “Of course, cannibalism can be rather profound as well.”

“So the bodies were used to make pills?” Shadowrider took a deep breath and speculated.

Technique mastery was one thing, the materials were crucial as well, whether it be special grass or beast cores, flesh, or dao bones.

No one had a problem with using these materials, but what about human flesh, tendons, and bones? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It was rather frightening to imagine a conqueror extracting certain human parts for the sake of either power or lifespan.

As an assassin, he merely killed people. Refining and eating them seemed more sinister in comparison.

“It doesn’t have to be pills, he could have eaten them alive. For example, when you eat a snake, you have to know where to slice in order to extract the gallbladder.” Li Qiye explained: “This is a high-level art, either self-created or was passed down.”

“Hmm, power or lifespan.” Shadowrider wondered about the possibility.

“Either way, once started, there is no going back. The user will be addicted and fall into the darkness.” Li Qiye said with a profound gaze: “It is forbidden and detested for a reason. Even the greatest hero who had protected this world would not be able to redeem themselves after walking down this path. Only darkness awaits.”

“Why pick this path?” Shadowrider said.

“Cultivators are just far more nutritious compared to a same-grade material. For example, an immortal versus a so-called immortal grass.” Li Qiye said: “Thus, a dragon lord will be more effective to a conqueror than a divine grass. The same applies to conquerors for a supreme overlord.”

“So big fish eating small fish.” Shadowrider’s horizon expanded as he understood a dark truth.

“Indeed, it is the law of the jungle. Nonetheless, it is outwardly forbidden, not allowed in any era or epoch. Once it is unleashed, the world will plunge into darkness and chaos.” Li Qiye said.

Once this particular art became popular, even a highly-skilled assassin like him would turn into delicious meals.

“Now, it has appeared in the hand of a conqueror, how strange.” Li Qiye continued.

Shadowrider agreed and wondered about the origin of this method.

“Let’s go to that place, we’ll find out soon enough.” Li Qiye said.

Shadowrider got up but first, they regrouped with Goldcrest and the others.

The youths were frightened to see him next to Li Qiye.

“Shadowrider…” They would have run if it wasn’t for Li Qiye’s presence.

He only stared at them in silence.

“Did you kill anyone here?” The innocent Ming Shi asked.

“No one paid me to.” He uttered coldly.

He couldn’t stand up straight in front of Li Qiye but he was still a dreadful king of assassins in the youths’ eyes.
