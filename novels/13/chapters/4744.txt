Chapter 4745: Fiendish Water

The ancient ancestors from the alliance knew what they must do - fight together.

Spectators watched with bated breath, becoming eager for this ultimate battle. Perhaps the first battle of the dao lord competition would also be the fiercest and the one to decide the future winner.

They knew that if Li Qiye didn’t go down here, he would absolutely become the next dao lord. As for the other conquerors, they would have to live in his shadow afterward - a cruel fate for the competitive souls.

Thus, Five-sun King and the young emperor nodded in unison after coming up with the same conclusion.

They were supreme geniuses and dragons among men, wanting to reach the apex. To be inferior forever was an unacceptable future; the gap between them and Li Qiye would be akin to that of insects and a dao lord.

Losing to one of the conquerors would have been acceptable. They previously thought that one of them would become a dao lord. The competition was close enough for them to maintain face. Alas, Li Qiye was simply too dominant and haughty.

Their pride made them rather die here than to live a borrowed life under Li Qiye’s reign. Therefore, determination flashed brightly in their eyes.

“It’s time for us to team up.” The river demon uttered nefariously: “Brother Spider, lend me your strength.”

The crowd had an ominous feeling bout this - two demon gods working together. Moreover, the result should be impressive. These two saints must have worked together before with special techniques.

“Boom!” The fist-sized spider landed on the ground after hearing this. Strangely enough, the impact was as devastating as a large meteor.

“Crack!” Cracks appeared on the ground and took the form of a gigantic spider web. Even space itself had cracks that extend to Li Qiye’s area.

This turned the world itself into a spider web. Meanwhile, the small spider released boundless jade radiance. An ocean of light emerged and could drown out the entire battlefield.

The cracks on the ground and in the sky were infected by this green light. The spiderweb became more conspicuous.

Once they coiled together, Li Qiye would be trapped in a cocoon in the blink of an eye, helpless. The web could have trapped a true dragon with room to spare, let alone a being as tiny as a human. By this point, Li Qiye couldn’t move an inch lest caught by the web.

“Inescapable Net.” A demon king said: “This is his ultimate technique. All of his power is channeled into the web right now.”

The spider himself couldn’t move because of this. He and the web were one at this point. Therefore, the technique was a double-edged sword since it left him vulnerable as well.

The river demon also joined the fray, shaking his demonic banner and summoning an evil skull with his other hand. It issued a nefarious and nauseating ringing. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Abyss of the dark earth, water of all evil…” He started chanting.

“Splash!” Water suddenly sprung from the ground and filled the area of the web, seemingly originating from the yellow river.

“Zzz…” It drowned Li Qiye and started sucking his life and vitality.

“Fiendish Water!” A spectator recognized the move.

“This is what he used to easily massacre a kingdom. Everything inside was robbed of their vitality.” A mighty devil monarch became afraid.

“Yes, and he refined the victims into specters afterward, that’s the real scary part.” A big shot from the east added.

“Start!” The five monarchs of Three Thousand Dao initiated their attack plan as well.

After Titanic Monarch’s command, a void appeared in the air and sent down countless heavenly swords. Each could cut down a mountain range and change the current landscape.

“Die!” Pagoda Monarch empowered his pagoda again and sent it to smash Li Qiye into a pulp.
