Chapter 5319: Eating

The beauty of Heaven’s Allure birthed legendary tales. Of course, some cursed her for being a lascivious demoness whose purpose was tempting men.

Though her reputation preceded her, others still couldn’t help falling in love. This included dao lords and conquerors - the greatest cultivators in the world.

Remember that these beings have been through numerous adventures and conquests. They had seen countless beauties in the past. In fact, some had harems consisting of gorgeous cultivators, the fairest of their era.

Their rich experience didn’t help them when it was time to face Heaven’s Allure. This was a testament to her indescribable charm.

There were exceptions, of course - those who managed to resist her temptation. Nonetheless, they sang praises of her appearance.

All in all, she was a popular topic in the taverns. Some regular cultivators even believed that being able to see her was the blessing of a lifetime.

Alas, she rarely showed up in public after joining Celestial Court - the opposite of everyone’s wish.

“Don’t get the wrong idea, Heaven’s Allure goes beyond physical attraction, not like a kingdom toppling beauty found in the mortal world or a seductress. After enough interactions, her charisma is what draws people in.” Peacock Dao Lord said.

Zhitian could see this because how could top cultivators fall over physical beauty alone? That would be rather disappointing for them to lose to the flesh. This meant that she must have intelligence and cultivation insight as well. Beauty alone couldn’t justify her position in Celestial Court.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Do you have any idea who might have left these statues here?” Zhitian asked.

“Hard to say. If there’s an accurate statue, it must be someone who had seen her before, not easy after her joining Celestial Court. It must be an emperor-level character.” The dao lord shook his head.

“We came to the same conclusion.” Zhitian said.

“That’s a wide net. Hmm, what an incredibly strange matter, leaving her statues here. The problem is that many top cultivators visit Evil Reborn. I’ve seen All-things, Supreme, Immortal Pagoda, Timewatcher, Eternal, and many more…” Peacock responded.

“Are you staying here long-term?” Li Qiye asked.

“Sir, that is my temporary plan. I have no interest in joining Heaven or Dao Alliance. The mortal world doesn’t have anything I pursue either, I’m just a lone wolf with nowhere to be. Herding these tigers is at least interesting right now but I might leave later.” Peacock said.

“Dao Lord, will you eat them before leaving?” Zhitian couldn’t help but ask.

“I understand what you’re saying but it actually makes zero difference. What I do will be dependent on my whim at the time. Eating them might seem cruel to you but they will go extinct without me anyway.” Peacock smiled.

“It’s best to not be so extreme.” Li Qiye said.

“I will try to follow your advice, Sir.” Peacock lowered his head.

The group chatted for a bit and ignored the matter of Heaven’s Allure. After all, too many powerful cultivators have visited and they had no good guess.

As the group was about to leave, Peacock decided to send them off for quite a distance. After they were gone, he still bowed in the direction of Li Qiye.

Along the way, Li Qiye glanced at Li Zhitian and asked: “Still thinking about the tigers?”

“My apologies, Young Noble. It seems like my emotion is getting the best of me, how embarrassing.” Zhitian let out a dry chuckle.

“It’s not your fault but in a way, Peacock is right. Nonetheless, there is no problem with you being a passionate youth.” Li Qiye smiled.

“After thinking it through, Peacock Dao Lord is not at fault. We all do similar things with alchemy materials, cultivating before consuming them.” Zhitian said.

“Because of your first impression of Evil Reborn, you felt pity for the tigers after seeing them in the lair and felt uncomfortable to see them eaten.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m aware that it’s hypocritical and I shouldn’t be so judgmental.” Zhitian said.

“People have different interpretations of the ways of the world.” Li Qiye said before pausing a bit: “But, remember this, the world’s inhabitants should protect themselves because there are no saviors. Those who claim to be are often the initiators of disasters, this had occurred numerous times in history.”

“Saviors or destroyers…” Zhitian murmured.

Li QIye stared at him with a meaningful gaze and asked: “Do you think Celestial Court is protecting The Race? Was Peacock Dao Lord protecting the tigers?”

Zhitian stopped walking. He had never questioned Celestial Court’s intent in the past. However, spending time with Li Qiye and personally experiencing certain events changed his perception.

His clan’s title was Imperial; its members have served Celestial Court since time antiquity. The ideology of Celestial Court’s noble goals has been engrained in The Race.

Peacock Dao Lord also protected the tigers and built a lair for them to avoid extinction. However, he also ate them, not to mention potentially wiping them out if he were to be bored in the future. Would he be the tigers’ saviors or destroyers?
