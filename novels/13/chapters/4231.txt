Chapter 4232: A’zhi’s Identity

The old man was rather conspicuous; no one would give him a second glance. It was surprising to see him stepping up to challenge Vastsea Venerable.

Though the five overlords never had an internal ranking, many speculated that the strongest was either War God or the venerable. Either way, he was not one to be trifled with.

Even Terra and Nine-sun Sword Saint were not qualified to challenge him, let alone an unknown cultivator. Thus, the crowd thought that this old man was courting death. Where did he get the confidence to challenge the venerable?

“Li Qiye has so many followers, this guy even dares to challenge Vastsea Venerable.” An expert murmured.

The old man was none other than the mysterious A’zhi.

The venerable showed no sign of anger and became sentimental instead: “Brother Hallowed, you must join this mess as well? Hallowed City has always been neutral and uninvolved in the past.”

This revelation stunned the crowd.

“Ah, can’t hide it from you, Brother Vastsea.” A’zhi said and took off his hat, revealing his true appearance. [1]

A’zhi had a young face despite his gray hair, looking both friendly and mysterious. Others found him to be extraordinary right away. This was a stark contrast to his form earlier.

“Hallowed City Lord…” Spectators murmured.

They regained their wits and started talking among themselves. Hallowed City was one of the strongest lineages in Sword Continent. Its lord was renowned and mighty as well.

He was considered the strongest when not counting the five overlords. No one refuted this, not even the overlords.

Other ancient ancestors have been praised in a similar manner before, such as Sword God Jialun or Poplar Paragon…

However, all of them seemed to be missing a little something compared to Hallowed City Lord.

“Goddamn…” Crimsondeath Monarch and his allies were astounded.

They have been taught by A’zhi previously. They knew that the guy was extremely strong, just not his actual ceiling. Who would have thought that they were hanging out with the lord of Hallowed?

It became obvious why A’zhi’s teaching was so effective. They were learning from a true master.

“We’re so lucky.” One of them said, never expecting such luck before.

Normally, characters like them didn’t have the luck to be in the city lord’s presence. Now, they were actually taught by him thanks to Li Qiye.

“Why would Hallowed City Lord work for Li Qiye?” Someone calmed down and brought up this point.

“You’re right, what happened between them?” Others had no answer. Hallowed City Lord was not a man who needed money.

“I’m afraid this isn’t the right occasion for you to join the fun.” Earthraiser Vajra said: “It’s against your city’s creed for you to be the dao protector of Fellow Daoist Li.”

Listeners exchanged glances right away.

“Ah, so is Hallowed City Lord acting as Li Qiye’s dao protector? Does he want to become a dao lord?” One expert asked.

This was the only explanation for the lord to be around Li Qiye.

“One should venture out and experience many things in life.” The city lord smiled and said: “Of course, Sword Continent will be in a better state if you two would be kind enough to yield.”

“Brother Hallowed, this is a serious issue. The existence of this sword can start a war after one wrong move.” Vastsea responded.

This wasn’t incorrect since if the matter of Myriad Era didn’t have a satisfactory conclusion here, it might actually start a bloody competition.

“That’s too early to say, but your sect already has two heavenly swords. Is there a need to get a third?” Hallowed answered.

The two overlords exchanged glances, aware that Hallowed City Lord wasn’t going to back down.

“Your sword dao is flawless but I don’t think you alone can make decisions here.” Vastsea Venerable said.

“Then count me in. Being able to fight an overlord is the blessing of a lifetime.” Tie Jian appeared next to the city lord; his voice was rather charismatic.

“Another?” This was a surprising development for the crowd.

“He has to be another big shot, right?” One of them asked.

“I don’t recognize him, I have no idea who he is.” Someone nearby shook her head.

This was the case for the mass. They simply didn’t know who Tie Jian was.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Young Ancestor.” The sect master of Daoist Sword Ground actually recognized him and bowed deeply.

“An ancestor?” Others became startled.

“I left the sword ground years ago, I’m not a member of your sect.” Tie Jian’s attitude was rather strange.

Ling Jian’s mouth opened but no words came out. He eventually let out a sigh and kept quiet.

“I remember the day vividly when I visited the sword ground, you were only eighteen yet still sparred with War God.” The vajra spoke: “He said that your cultivation would certainly surpass him in the future.”

Listeners couldn’t believe it. This guy fought against War God when he was only eighteen?

“I’ve let First Brother down, my cultivation is not a match for his.” Tie Jian took a deep breath and said.

“Though you left the sword ground, he still gave you his legacy before death.” Vastsea added.

“What?!” Some gasped and became emotional.

War God chose to leave his legacy to someone who had left the sect? Just how much hope did he place in Tie Jian?

Ling Jian himself knew very little about Tie Jian, only that the guy was the most talented during that era, not War God. Keep in mind that War God was a supreme genius back then yet Tie Jian was still one level higher?
