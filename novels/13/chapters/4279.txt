Chapter 4280: Arduous Dao

The yin and yang circled around him along with dao images. Chaos energy emerged akin to the start of a new world.

His body was being melted, resembling an entity at the start of time. This chaos energy far exceeded his current cultivation level. One could hear bestial roars due to this majestic energy.

Once the channeling reached its peak, a divine lion from time immemorial woke up and let out a devastating roar. The image of one appeared next to him - dominating and tyrannical.

These characteristics spread over to him as well. He grew in size and became a tyrant.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Alas, as his chaos energy and dao were reaching their limit, chains suddenly appeared and sealed them.

“Boom!” His true fate was stopped and couldn’t channel energy any further. This was the bottleneck mentioned prior. The process thus far came to an abrupt halt and everything receded like the tides.

He felt empty and couldn’t restart the process. This made breaking through an impossibility.

“Again?” He smashed the ground from rage, leaving a deep pit behind. Various emotions surfaced - ire, helplessness, and despair.

He had experienced this numerous times already but didn’t give up. Unfortunately, this bottleneck seemed impossible. Another dao seemed to be binding his own and prevented him from improving.

“Why is this happening to me?!” He shouted indignantly.

If it wasn’t for this dao seal, he would have soared above the nine firmaments. He was once the most talented descendant of the royal clan.

His cultivation speed was the fastest; this didn’t mean that his foundation was rushed either. Though he was the son of a concubine, he still had plenty of supporters due to his talent. They believed that he could become something great, perhaps the throne wasn’t out of the question. Thus, his reputation and fame were unmatched.

Unfortunately, the dao shackles happened and he stopped improving abruptly. The other geniuses caught up and even surpassed him as a result.

Years went by and the great genius became the laughingstock of the royal clan. His status cratered afterward.

The royal clan had treated him well and gave him everything necessary for cultivation. But now, his unfavorable background annoyed others and his talent couldn’t hide this fact any longer. This was one of the reasons why he left the capital.

“Is it impossible?” He murmured in a daze.

In recent years, there were still ancestors who have yet to give up on him. The flashes of brilliance in the past justified them trying numerous methods and medicines to break this dao shackle. Alas, nothing worked.

Eventually, all of them had to give up and chose other juniors instead. After all, they needed capable leaders in the future.

He didn’t hate the seniors for abandoning him. After all, they certainly helped during his prime and had tried numerous methods to solve the bottleneck. Abandoning him was pragmatic.

It’s just that falling from the peak all the way to the abyss was unbearable. Others also kicked him while he was down.

He sighed and thought that maybe the heaven didn’t want to see him improve. He took a deep breath and regained his composure for another session. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He channeled chaos energy and dao again. It’s a shame that his effort was not rewarded this time either. Pessimism came but was defeated by determination. He had no intention of giving up just yet.

“Boom!” Another session resulted in his energy and dao receding back into his body.

“What else can I do?” He had tried countless times but the result was always the same. Not even the tiniest improvement occurred.

Worst of all, the experiments didn’t point out a potential problem to him. He didn’t know why this was happening.

He had no injuries and no sign of qi deviation either. His merit laws had no flaws and mistakes either. The ancestors agreed that his comprehension of the merit laws was impeccable, going as far as being superior to members of the previous generation. Alas, he was still stuck in the yin yang realm.

“The way you’re doing it, a million more attempts won’t help.” He suddenly heard someone nearby.

He turned around and saw that the beggar was looking at him. Ever since he brought this person back, he has been in a stupefied state, not eating or drinking.

“You’re awake?” He was happy to see lucidity in Li Qiye’s eyes.

“Are you okay now?” He assumed that Li Qiye’s injuries had gotten better.

He wasn’t a stranger to injuries and knew how traumatic it could be.

“Of course.” Li Qiye responded.

“Brother, what did you mean earlier? Do you know something about my condition?” He recalled Li Qiye’s comment and lowered his head.

He naturally had no hope in this because even the mighty ancestors failed. Alas, he was desperate enough to do anything.

“Forcefully breaking through is useless.” Li Qiye said: “Your Tyrannical Physique requires the true fate’s approval.”

“Approval? My true fate?” He mumbled and pondered. Suddenly, a light flashed in his head.

“Brother, are you saying that I should…” He became excited and looked over only to find that Li Qiye had returned to his drowsy state.

He tried several times but Li Qiye didn’t respond.
