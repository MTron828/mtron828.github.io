Chapter 3577: Join Our Academy

The ode attracted everyone’s attention. They saw a young man meandering over.

He dressed in a simple manner without any decoration. A woodcutter was hanging by his waist, a carrying pole on his shoulder. He had a natural and free expression as he sang a strange song.

“Young Noble Li! Over here!” Yang Ling called out for him.

Li Qiye stopped and stared at her: “What is it?”

“It’s nothing. This place is very lively with everyone gathered. You should come with us.” She winked at him with good intention.

She thought that Sir Shang might be scheming, wanting to use Li Qiye. Thus, if he were with the academy, at least Sir Shang wouldn’t dare to do whatever he wanted.

“That’s Li Qiye?” Sir Shang wasn’t impressed by Li Qiye since he really looked like an ordinary woodchopper. A cultivator at the Violet Marquis realm was insignificant in his eyes.

The marquis and the others also stared at Li Qiye. They found it hard to believe that this woodchopper could co-exist peacefully with the chaos primal beasts here.

“Yes.” Someone else told Sir Shang: “He really got some magical gem fruits from the ape. Even a high monk from Heavenly Dragon Temple and the Nightwalkers couldn’t do it yet he had no problem.”

He then gave a brief recollection of what happened during that event.

“That’s nothing short of a miracle.” Both the senior defender and the marquis remained skeptical.

“Sir, it’s absolutely true, thousands of people saw it. Those from the Nightwalker Tribe even experienced this.” The cultivator swore.

As for Duality, the students who weren’t there became very curious. They believed it because Yang Ling’s group had no reasons to lie.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye seemingly didn’t see Yang Ling winking repeatedly. He shook his head and smiled: “If there’s nothing, I need to bring some firewood home, can’t be delayed.”

Yang Ling stomped exasperatingly on the ground since Li Qiye didn’t notice danger was approaching. She said with an urgent tone: “Just come over here, I’ll explain later.”

“No need, gathering wood is more important.” Li Qiye shook his head and refused.

Yang Ling felt the urge to beat someone since Li Qiye couldn’t tell good from bad. She wondered if he was dumb beyond cure.

“Princess, just let him die if he wants to so badly.” Zhang Changyu would be more than happy to see Li Qiye die.

“It’s none of your business!” The anxious Yang Ling glared at him.

Zhang Changyu never dared to go against Yang Ling so he kept his mouth shut. The anger once again was diverted towards Li Qiye.

Teacher Du decided to descend to the ground, landing in front of Li Qiye.

“We meet again, Young Noble Li.” He didn’t put on an act at all, looking as friendly as can be.

“What is it?” Li Qiye seemed disinterested in the amicable teacher.

Anyone else wouldn’t like this. After all, Teacher Du was a man of status, around the same level as an elder from a big sect. He was well-respected by the students in Duality as well, the geniuses included.

Teacher Du didn’t seem to mind and smiled: “Young Noble Li, Duality Academy always has love and appreciation for talents such as yourself. Would you like to join our academy to advance your studies?”

The students from Duality were surprised first then the rest of the crowd.

Though Duality had its door open for everyone in the world, the entry requirements were severely stringent.

The students either had an incredible background, strong talents, or something brilliant about them. One-in-a-billion wouldn’t be an exaggeration.

An invitation like this was very rare. Only others asked to join Duality, never the other way around.

“Hmph, Duality is quite calculating. They’re inviting him in order to monopolize the fruits.” An elder calmed down and sneered.

“Right?” Other experts clapped their thigh in full agreement, thinking that they knew Duality’s goal. They started sneering at the academy.

Teacher Du turned a deaf ear to this and only focused on Li Qiye: “What do you think, Young Noble?”

Li Qiye also ignored the others and stared at the teacher. He smiled and shook his head: “No point in going to Duality to learn more, it’s more comfortable chopping woods here. Nonetheless, I will remember your goodwill.”

The refusal was certainly unexpected for the students. It took immense effort for them to join, needing to surpass numerous trials. Now, Li Qiye was turning down this great opportunity.

“This is a mistake!” Yang Ling performed her trademark foot stomp again and hurriedly told him: “You should know that joining our academy is far better than staying here. It’ll guarantee you a great future.”

She implicated that the senior defender wouldn’t be able to do anything to him if he were to join their academy.

Vajra might be strong but it wouldn’t directly confront Duality nor would it do anything to a student there in public.

“I prefer my current life.” Li Qiye waved his hand and smiled. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Idiot, I’m trying to save you...” She murmured, vexed.

“Just let him fend for himself.” Other students snorted since their teacher was refused. They had a terrible impression of someone so unambitious.

“If you ever change your mind, our door is always open for you. We truly appreciate talented people and will not let you down if you visit us.” Teacher Du stared at him and said.

He then paused and glanced over at the marquis and senior defender, whether on purpose or not, then said: “Of course, if you have any problem, you’re welcome to come to find us. You know where we are.” With that, he floated back to the peak.

“Brother Du, this brat is worthy of your effort?” A different teacher asked him.

“Yes.” Teacher Du’s eyes were profound as he stared at Li Qiye: “I’ve never seen someone with that type of personality and character before. Just that alone is worthy of joining our academy. His talents don’t matter.”

“What do you mean?” An older teacher joined in.

“Unmoved by external temptations.” Teacher Du responded seriously.
