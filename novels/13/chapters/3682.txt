Chapter 3683: Just One Move

“Since you’re courting death, we’ll help you accomplish your goal.” Li Xiangquan uttered coldly.

They had no need to employ false courtesy or make excuses. Both stepped forward at the same time.

If it was someone else weaker than them, they wouldn’t have chosen to work together. A victory then would still ruin their reputation.

However, Li Qiye had infuriated them. Thus, they didn’t mind a gloriless victory.

“I hope the two senior brothers will let him have his wish.” Many students from Duality snorted. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The duo slowly walked towards Li Qiye with murderous intent. They clearly had no intention of holding back. If they could kill him with one move, they wouldn’t plan to use a second one.

Li Qiye lazily stretched, not looking like someone who’s about to fight two geniuses at all. This seemed like just another stroll to him.

“How do you want to die? A swift one or an agonizing one?” Zhang Yunzhi taunted after the two surrounded him.

This wasn’t a real question since he would take the time to torture Li Qiye after defeating him. His twisted grimace said it all - clearly fantasizing about the future malicious acts.

“You have a rich imagination. Be realistic now.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Is that so?” Li Xiangquan sneered. He thought that when the two of them were together, no one else in the young generation could take them on. In fact, he was confident going against Dugu Lan like this.

“You really think we can’t beat you?” He glared at Li Qiye.

“One move is enough.” Li Qiye smiled.

“One move?!” The crowd found this astonishing.

“He’s joking, right? That’s impossible.” Even those who would bet their money on Li Qiye were skeptical.

“Yes, one move is not enough.” An elder shook his head: “These two aren’t ordinary cultivators given their clan’s resources. Their treasures should be amazing. Not to mention their peers, not many from the previous generation can take them down that quickly.”

“Does he think that he’s a supreme?” One student laughed: “He doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.”

Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi found this hilarious, thinking that they have misheard.

“Hahaha, you’ll defeat us with one move?” Zhang Yunzhi laughed boisterously.

“Hmm, maybe one move is a bit unfair, too cruel in sending you two to the pit of despair. I’m always a merciful person even to my opponents. I will allow you to struggle a bit.” Li Qiye calmly added.

The crowd smiled wryly in response. Li Qiye has only made his debut recently but he was far from being a merciful person. Someone who killed 100,000 had nothing to do with the word, “mercy’.

“Three moves.” Li Qiye raised three fingers and said: “The first two moves are free, do whatever you want with your treasures and merit laws. The third move will send you two on your next journey.”

“Li, do you think we’re fish on a chopping board for you to do whatever you want?!” Li Xiangquan shouted back.

“No, you’re no different from dead men in my eyes.” Li Qiye revealed a soft smile.

“You!” Xiangquan trembled with rage.

Zhang Yunzhi felt the same way but he took a deep breath and told his ally: “Brother Li, no need to argue with him. Let’s use action instead.”

Li Xiangquan agreed with this and calmed down. He stared intensely at Li Qiye and said: “I suppose killing you is letting you off too easily. This won’t end quickly.” He had the urge to torture Li Qiye as well. He made up his mind to do so.

“Boom!” He released his vitality and chaos true energy. Zhang Yunzhi also did the same. His vitality exploded, resulting in waves.

The two of them were ready to subdue Li Qiye then torture him afterward.

“Rumble!” Their released energy swept through the area, capable of pushing the world away.

One could hear lighting crackles around Li Xiangquan. He focused his eyes and turned them into two endless oceans of lighting bolts.

They started escaping from his eyes and floated around him. Once enough accumulated, they rushed to the sky like a reversed waterfall.

He suddenly became gigantic with an ocean of lightning bolts above him, turning him into a thunder god.

“Myriad-form Sanctity. He might not be the very best but still a dragon among men, worthy of being the successor of the Li.” Many started praising him.

“Cold-eyed Lightning Sword, true to his title.” Others thought of his title after seeing the ocean of lightning bolts.

“He doesn’t have any inborn talent but there’s still something special about him. His eyes have the lightning affinity at birth, that’s quite rare.” Someone who was familiar with him said.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Zhang Yunzhi’s silver armor started having more sections and plates added in a loud manner.

His actual physique became massive as well. Because of his armor, he looked like a silver wall separating the realm - uncrossable and indestructible.

Just one step of his could destroy mountains and rivers along with his foes. His divinity was intimidating, not inferior to Li Xiangquan in the slightest - whether it be his aura or momentum.

The two seemed evenly matched after assuming their peak state.
