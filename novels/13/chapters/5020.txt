Chapter 5021: God Sources Assembled

“Nice, nice, a young star has risen. You have my admiration.” Bloodfly was visibly ecstatic.

The unsealing of the tablet was his only wish for all these years. Now, he could finally carry out his ambitious plan.

Golden Cicada knew the amount of effort Bloodfly had put into this, hence his disbelief at Li Qiye’s success.

The other dragon lords were left speechless and humiliated. However, they didn’t understand the process and the secret behind Li Qiye’s attempt.

“You should scram now.” Li Qiye waved his hand and said.

Bloodfly laughed and was in a great mood. Even his words weren’t as intimidating as before: “Good, I’m leaving then. We’ll meet again if it’s meant to be.”

He stared at Li Qiye one last time; his eyes flashed brightly. The rays resembled blood-draining needles.

Li Qiye saw this and said: “Got another idea? Be smart and fly away, fly. If we meet again, I will wring your head off.”

“We’ll see about that.” Though he wanted to kill Li Qiye, he needed to keep his word. Otherwise, worshipping beasts and demons would stop trusting him.

“Boom!” He turned into an ocean of blood. The stench intensified and made everyone want to puke.

As he disappeared into the horizon, the stench left with him. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief because this commanding god was rather frightening, especially his bloody eyes.

“Keeping a promise, I see.” Li Qiye smiled. Of course, he didn’t mind either way. If Bloodfly were to renege, he would have a reason to kill him.

“Young Noble, you are brilliant indeed. I am utterly convinced by your greatness.” Golden Cicada bowed to show respect, ignoring the feud between Li Qiye and his commanding god.

“Demons reaching the dao is difficult, changing their culture is even harder. Love yourself instead of courting death.” Li Qiye stared at him and left a clear warning, giving him a chance to survive. After all, he had done well to bring civilization to Demon.

Golden Cicada became startled before responding: “I will keep your advice in mind, Young Noble.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He then brought the two god sources over to Li Qiye and said: “They’re yours now.”

The focus returned to the two god sources. Li Qiye was known to have three at this point.

“Not bad at all.” He smiled before taking out the two god sources that he had and assembling them together.

“Four!” The dragon lords became startled since they only knew about the third one given to him by the little girl.

“So you already had two, Young Noble. If you can gather all six, you might be able to enter the divine nest.” Golden Cicada said.

“Young Noble, I do not deserve this god source and shall give it to you.” Goldcrest took out his own and offered it to Li Qiye.

The latter accepted it without hesitation. Now, five pieces were together; their radiance and divinity became stronger.

Some glanced over at Tendril King since she had the last one. All six were in this palace right now.

Ming Shi herself also stole glances at her senior aunt. If Li Qiye wanted all of them, he would need to make a move.

She once thought that Li Qiye was weaker than her senior aunt but by this point, she knew that he could kill her easily. It would be the same situation as Halo Monarch so she started worrying.

Tendril King sighed and took out her own god source. She walked over and said: “Young Noble, you are an unparalleled hero under the heaven. I do not deserve this god source.” 

She could tell that this was inevitable. She couldn’t obtain the five god sources from Li Qiye and had personally witnessed how he killed Halo Monarch - he couldn’t block a single move.

Both of them had five sacred fruits and similar power. Therefore, it was suicidal to go against him.

Having one god source alone was relatively useless for her. Plus, she wasn’t from Demon. Giving it to him now meant wisely making him owe her a favor.

It would be too late once he started demanding it; the situation would no longer be the same.

“Smart.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Thank you, Young Noble. It seems like fate is bringing you and the god sources together.” She said. She felt that this was predetermined and that the little girl was the wisest for giving it to him first.

“Buzz.” He added the final piece.

“Boom!” A five-colored radiance shot up into the air and created the image of a peacock.

“Peacock Monarch!” Everyone shouted.
