Chapter 5818: Heaven Seal

Spectators couldn’t help thinking about the consequences of the immortals joining Li Qiye. They had never seen the five overlords behind Celestial Court, viewing them as illusory existences.

These beings weren’t on their mind and there were no shackles. Commands came from the three immortals and the found, so they had stronger ties with them.

As for Profound, Sword, Hao Hai, and Nether who were given gifts from the overlords, they still have never seen or heard from these beings before.

If the three immortals were to join Li Qiye, did that mean they would join Li Qiye as well? This meant that Celestial Court would have a new master unless the other overlords chose to retaliate.

“We stand and die with Celestial Court.” Heaven Authority eventually responded.

“Absolute loyalty, have it your way then, a brave soul deserves a dignified death.” Li Qiye nodded: “I do hope this will be rewarded and your ancestors won’t just watch or your death will be in vain.”

Others couldn’t help but feel respect for the three immortals. They have been loyal all this time but in the end, it seemed that their masters didn’t fully trust them. Nevertheless, they resisted Li Qiye’s temptation and chose to side with Primal Ancestor and Lord of Derivation. Betraying Celestial Court was not an option, and this caused those who wanted to leave to hesitate.

“Let’s get started!” The trio roared in unison.

Divine Eternal blew on his grass and shouted: “Divine Eternal Grass, Unending Slumber.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Poof!” A spark flickered and ignited the bundle of grass. Green smoke emerged and was blown away by his puff, enveloping Li Qiye.

It had a temporal stagnation effect, putting all affinities and dao laws to sleep. This prevented the defender from using any technique or dao power.

Heaven Authority and Devil Bestowment made their move. The former swung his staff and seemed to be drawing stars to initiate an ancient incantation.

“Buzz.” Starlight infused with dark magic appeared with the swing and changed the rhythm of heaven and earth.

“Heaven Authority Staff, Heaven Seal!” The light entered Li Qiye, morphing into an incomprehensible curse to imprison his true fate, karma, and samsara cycles.

“Divine Bestowment Crystal, Infinite Banishment!” At the same time, Devil Bestowment’s crystal ball became resplendent. Its light sent Li Qiye through countless dimensions, never letting him return to their own.

“Boom!” The trio utilized all of their vitality and power, burning their true blood.

Their twelve wills turned into an azure of primal anima power sweeping through Celestial Court.

This was not the crowd’s first time seeing this next stage - primal anima. They had seen World, Jiao Heng, and Profound activate this power. However, the three immortals’ primal anima far exceeded theirs.
