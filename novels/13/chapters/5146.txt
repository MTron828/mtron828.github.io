Chapter 5147: Some Fruits Too

Some cultivators were truly magnificent beings. For example, All-things Dao Lord, Sword Queen, and Supreme. The latter was a dragon lord yet he loomed above conquerors and dao lords.

However, these two men were so unfamiliar. Their ancestor had traveled the world and met virtually everyone yet he didn’t recognize them.

“Emperors from the immortal continent?” One conqueror said softly. This would make sense since their ancestor might not know the ancient emperors.

After all, most emperors disappeared after the Immemorial War, either due to dying in battle or choosing to live reclusively.

“Celestial Court would know if there are descending emperors.” The ancestor shook his head: “Just remember that the world is full of hidden masters. We are far from being the strongest. Others praise us as true dragons but in reality, some view us as insects.”

“Who can view us as insects?” One dragon lord didn’t accept this comment.

“We’re only a small clan.” The ancestor explained: “Do not be arrogant. Remember, we are nothing compared to the Qian.”

They shuddered after hearing this and thought that he was right. Recently, their success in the upper continents has made them blind to certain things.

The Qian were the nobles of The Race. They were absolutely on the same level as Celestial Court during their prime.

Just imagine a single clan with nine emperors, one of them being the legendary World Emperor. Which emperor could have fought him evenly - a perfect cultivator with a true immortal armament?

Alas, the result was the total destruction of the Qian after being branded as sinners by Celestial Court. Even World Emperor fell in battle.

Though the Lu had four conquerors, they were indeed nothing compared to the Qian.

“Ancestor, you wouldn’t have stagnated if it wasn’t for…” A dragon lord said with indignation.

“No, it was my own choice. Mind your words so that you do not ruin our reputation.” The ancestor scolded.

They kept their mouth shut and didn’t continue this train of thought.

“Bring fruits for the two gentlemen.” The ancestor said: “We will just observe from a distance, it’s just ten thousand years of waiting… as long as our clan is still around.” He stared implicatively at them after saying this.

The clan members learned their lesson and bowed, no longer daring to disturb the two.

“This is a small token of our sincerity, please accept.” A dragon lord presented priceless fruits and left right away.

Thus, Li Qiye and Jun Landu had some fruits to go along with their wine and fish now while awaiting the grand dao phenomenon.

Jun Landu took a bite of one fruit and noticed how juicy it was: “The brat’s reception was terrible compared to this.”

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t comment.

“Buzz.” A light suddenly flashed before them.

“It’s coming.” Jun Landu became excited and sat up straight.

Deeper in this region was a faint light - a celestial ocean of the myriad dao. Heavenly stars became brighter and descended like shooting stars of varying shapes and sizes.

Meanwhile, the dao phenomenon has finally started. They started as dao particles before grouping together into larger wisps.

Heavenly meteors crashed downward and smashed into the dao wisps, resulting in incredible explosions like fireworks.

Visual phenomena appeared within the explosions - phoenixes, true dragons, gigantic lotus, day turning into night…

Through the special phenomena, one would be able to catch a glimpse of the grand dao. Even conquerors would be fully immersed in this learning experience.

Of course, learning required exceptional comprehension and talent. Those not strong enough would be reduced to mincemeat or blood by the explosions alone.

One would need to be at least a dragon lord to be close enough to observe this special event. The members of the Lu didn’t hold back and used their best defensive measures. Alas, they didn’t have the best spot.

Li Qiye and Jun Landu already took the nearest cliff. They watched the explosions while still eating and drinking, treating the shockwaves like gentle winds.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Although the Lu already knew about their true strength, seeing the disparity was still astonishing. They had nothing but respect for their ancestor because if it wasn’t for his vision, the consequences would have been grave.

The explosions and visual phenomena continued to wow them. The explosions near the climax were of unimaginable scale.

“Boom!” Eventually, the final image was one of a great tree. Conquerors and dragon lords were mere specks in comparison. The six continents were only a small corner of the tree.

“The Primordial Tree!” A conqueror saw this for the first time, unable to contain his excitement.

“Yes!” Jun Landu stood up after seeing this.
