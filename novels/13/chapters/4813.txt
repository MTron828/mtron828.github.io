Chapter 4814: Supreme Monarch

These electrical particles converged into the owner’s true fate. This process applied to not only living beings but also trees and grass. As long as there was life, this phenomenon occurred.

Normally, this felt like ascension with the particles inside the true fate - an unsurpassable feeling of pleasure and joy. In this case, because it wasn’t due to their own cultivation, they only became afraid.

Ancient ancestors and divine monarchs wanted to shout. Despite their impressive cultivation, they didn’t have that ultimate control over their own body. They couldn’t have controlled these tiny particles with such finesse.

This was a matter of limitation with merit law and dao comprehension. Even those adept in the lightning affinity didn’t possess such mastery.

It seemed that Dead Immortal’s cultivation system was rather different from the current one. This was a different manifestation of power.

Due to the electrical particles overfilling their true fate, once these things were dragged out, so did their true fate. Because of this, they saw their body falling down to the ground.

“Nooo!” The true fate, or the souls, screamed in horror. They knew that if they couldn’t return to the body, death was inevitable.

“The dao system of Bionic Epoch is unique indeed.” One supreme overlord said sentimentally.

The difference in cultivation was actually a plus in this case. If it had the same system as everyone else, it wouldn’t have overpowered them as easily.

However, as one of the creators of this unique system, it had perfect mastery over its laws and might. This allowed for a swift takeover of the inhabitants’ souls.

Dan Sanqian performed something similar. This required eras of planning - from the creation of the sect and passing down his merit laws. Finally, the ceremony itself required ample effort. Compared to Dead Immortal, Dao Sanqian’s technique was not worth mentioning.

“Are we going to die?!” The souls screamed.

A sublime scene occurred all over Eight Desolaces - the departed souls became resplendent with the lightning affinity.

The overlords understood that Dead Immortal didn’t dare to be reckless. He wanted to gather all of Eight Desolaces’ lightning particles to unleash an ultimate blow. It needed to be strong enough to kill Li Qiye so that the devouring would be simple. The heavenly treasure would be his as well.

However, during the split second before the conversion of souls into lightning power, an eternal power erupted and propagated across Eight Desolaces.

Mortals, cultivators, and all other creatures basked in this second affinity. Dead Immortal’s domination over them crumbled and the souls immediately returned to their original body.

They were horrified because just one more second and that would have been the end. That was a trip to hell and back.

“Fuck!” Many wanted to run away as far as possible, hiding in caves or pits.

The eternal power that managed to stop Dead Immortal came from a certain temple in Sky Border. More circular pulses shot to the sky.

“Rumble!” They served as seals to protect this world. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

People looked up and saw that the individual dao laws were as thick as mountain ranges. They covered the sky and granted protection.

The origin of this power was none other than a woman shrouded in boundless dao radiance. The moment she showed herself, primordial chaos and melodies poured down from the nine heavens. She gained the blessing of the entire mortal realm.

She wore a phoenix robe - a symbol of absolute authority. Her golden hair fluttered as she channeled her sacred power. The myriad dao in Eight Desolaces were under her jurisdiction.

“Your Majesty!” Inhabitants who have regained their freedom prostrated in her direction.

She had appeared in this crucial moment to save them all.

“The Supreme Monarch!” Everyone shouted.

The guardian of Eight Desolaces has returned again. She once showed up during the grand calamity and went into isolation afterward.

Despite her absence, the world still remembered her heroic deed. She was considered “supreme” because no one else could match her in Eight Desolaces.

“Finally here.” A supreme overlord whispered: “Stronger this time too with the true essences from the dao source.”

“Guardian.” Dead Immortal saw her and said: “You are not an overlord and this world’s dao is not your own. You cannot stop me.”
