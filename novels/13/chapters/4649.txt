Chapter 4650: Unexpected Development

It was one thing for Li Qiye to control the fist dao and foundation of Golden Gate. One explanation would include him cultivating this fist dao. However, for him to borrow the power of Worldbreaker?

Nothing could explain this outside of him being a fist slave. The whole thing didn’t make sense so people watched silently.

True Immortal Spirit was now dead despite using a dao lord weapon. Moreover, his killer was considered inferior in every way.

Nonetheless, after seeing him being able to use Worldbreaker’s power, his victory made perfect sense.

“Fellow Daoist, that’s another life you have taken.” The young emperor’s tone was calm yet forceful.

There seemed to be something about his voice - regal and commanding. This was the charisma and authority of an emperor, leaving no room for questions. This alone intimidated and suffocated listeners.

As the successor of True Immortal, he had the right to make decisions for the sect. Everyone thought that he would certainly avenge his fallen comrade. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“It’s his fault for being incapable.” Li Qiye smiled.

Different reactions occurred among the crowd. Some were shocked at his arrogance; others admired him for actually going against True Immortal and the young emperor.

Some top masters might not be afraid of the young emperor. Nonetheless, they would look rather serious due to the circumstances. As for Li Qiye, he still spoke with a smile.

None questioned his ability at this point since he had proven himself thus far. He certainly had the power to challenge the young emperor or the other conquerors.

Nervousness disappeared and anticipation grew about a potential fight between these two. Some believed that the young emperor was an apex genius while Li Qiye would certainly put up a good fight.

They wanted to see the young emperor’s current attainment in the dao since he could become a dao lord in the future. Just watching him in action was rather beneficial, especially for younger cultivators.

“Hahaha, he’s right. It was a fair fight, he could only blame himself for being incapable.” Tian Feng laughed and interjected.

The crowd agreed with this logic because if Li Qiye were to lose, True Immortal Spirit wouldn’t have spared him either.

“As I’ve said before, I am in charge here. Feel free to jump up the stage if you disagree and I’ll send you on your way. Otherwise, leave.” Li Qiye smiled and looked at the crowd, offending everyone once more.

When he said this the first time, others immediately chastised and yelled at him for being arrogant. Only silence occurred this time.

They exchanged glances and none dared to challenge him. His power was as clear as day - capable of killing a top genius wielding a dao lord weapon with a single punch.

They then stole glances at the potential competitors - Tian Feng, True Immortal Young Emperor, and Speargrasp.

Even Mad Fist who was in charge of the competition had to swallow his words after seeing Li Qiye being able to control his sect’s foundation.

“I’m too old to join this stage.” Speargrasp was the first to back off despite being aware of the crowd’s eagerness to see him fight.

This was expected since he didn’t want to be a part of this marriage competition in the beginning. Only two were left.

Tian Feng would certainly love to have a good fight. As for the young emperor, avenging his fellow sect member should be the next move.

“Hah, count me in.” Tian Feng’s battle spirit surged intensely.

The waves made people feel as if their heart was being crushed. Nonetheless, they were right about him being interested.
