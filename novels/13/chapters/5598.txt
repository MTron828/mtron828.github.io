Chapter 5599: Draped In Cloth

Mortals could only pray for protection from the deities, hoping that their family and land would be unscathed from this event.

Alas, their confidence wavered due to the presence of countless immortals. Moreover, some of these immortals were bloodied and seemingly defeated - fostering an ominous atmosphere.

Something horrifying must have happened outside and made these immortals run like dogs without masters. A few prophets felt as if a storm was approaching Momentous Frontier with malice.

Of course, there was nothing they could do. If immortals were running for their lives, mere mortals such as themselves would be crushed in a single second. Praying to the deities was the only option.

Meanwhile, Luminous and the others faced several options - fleeing away, entering Momentous Frontier, or fighting to the death. None was optimal.

They had no reinforcement to speak of due to the sudden attack from Celestial Court. It was too late to seek help from Imperial Field.

“Boom!” Dao City had been taken over. Anyone capable of running had fled inside Momentous Frontier. The rest faced subjugation and an overwhelming seal. They had to accept the light and become a part of The Race.

Luminous, despite being an apex cultivator, couldn’t fight Celestial Court by himself. No single man possessed the ability to do so, not even the great Purewood Divine Emperor in the past.

He thought about asking Momentous Frontier for help. Perhaps that would be enough to deal with the current armies of Celestial Court. Alas, this meant destroying the peace of Momentous Frontier in perpetuity.

The sacrifice and effort of its deities would be in vain. How many mortals would die in the future?

“Boom!” Under War Ancient God’s command, the armies came to the border of Momentous Frontier, facing Luminous and his remaining allies.

“Brothers, will you take us in?” Luminous had no choice but to resort to this last option.

They could just run inside but this would be blatant disrespect, culminating in animosity. They knew that the barriers of this place could stop Celestial Court’s current forces.

No response came from Momentous Frontier. Luminous and the others exchanged glances, aware of the answer.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Looks like we either die here or scatter like dogs.” Skysplitter Conqueror smiled wryly.

They had no grievances against the deities despite their refusal. After all, accepting them would ruin Momentous Frontier’s future. Plus, they had done nothing to deserve the help.

“Gentlemen, do we fight or run?” Six-finger Conqueror asked.

None expressed an opinion on this matter.

Dying today was meaningless. However, running away was rather shameful because Dao City was their home.

“We have done what we can to help others evacuate. You all are free to leave if you wish.” Luminous spoke first.

Not only was he the strongest, but he was also the lord of Dao City and had full authority, especially in West Bank’s absence.

“What will you do?” Someone asked.

“This world is vast but I have Dao City alone. This will be my final destination, I do not mind dying here. Plus, it won’t be the first time anyway.” Luminous laughed.

His plain words resonated with the listeners. This was one of the strongest cultivators in the world yet he stood before a dead end at the moment.

He was lucky before, surviving due to his primordial dao fruit in the lower realms. A repeat was unlikely.

“A general returns draped in cloth after a hundred battles.” Jadesword laughed and said: “We have killed countless cultivators, now it is our time to die. This is karma.”
