Chapter 4158: Unexpected Outcome

Of course, none dared to question his power. Thus, the scene became silent as he disembarked.

The eighteen islands had plenty of experts and villains. Alas, they all obeyed Dark Gale Camp regardless of their violent nature. This was double when it came to someone like Nightloom. Even the oldest bandits could only be considered his juniors.

“Greetings, Ancestor and Camp Lord. Please excuse us for the lack of reception.” One island lord came over and bowed towards Cloud Dream King, no longer worrying about the siege.

“Why the escalation?” Cloud Dream King frowned.

The island lord immediately responded: “Camp Lord, it’s because the enemy forced our hands, daring to take over Black Dragon Island and massacring our men. Please avenge our fallen brothers.”

“Ancestor, Camp Lord, please avenge our fallen brothers!” The other island lords and bandits shouted.

They knew that they wouldn’t be able to take down the island themselves. The situation was rather unfavorable so they needed Dark Gale’s involvement.

Dark Gale was their leader for a reason; its power was considerable. Moreover, Nightloom has made a rare appearance as well. Victory would be theirs for sure with his involvement. Then, all of Li Qiye’s wealth would belong to them.

They assumed that this was Nightloom’s purpose for being here.

“Is Nightloom going to join?” A neutral expert asked.

“Yes, and it’ll be amazing.” One ancestor became emotional since a true top master was present.

“That would make it the end for Li Qiye.” His friend speculated and became eager for the next development.

To see Nightloom in person was a priceless experience for their cultivation path. Moreover, some were annoyed at Li Qiye’s pompous attitude as well.

“Decapitate the enemy and drink their blood! Show no mercy towards Li Qiye! Let the world tremble before our might!” One bandit started shouting.

“Decapitate the enemy and drink their blood! Show no mercy towards Li Qiye…” This prompted the rest to shout as well.

They glared at Li Qiye; each gaze was as sharp as a sword. If gazes could kill, Li Qiye would be dead a million times by now.

However, he only smiled, seemingly taunting them.

He and Nightloom became the main stars of this event. Everyone thought that a battle was inevitable because Li Qiye had challenged Dark Gale’s authority.

Cloud Dream King didn’t respond and waited for his ancestor’s order.

Nightgloom didn’t bother to look at the shouting bandits. He calmly spoke: “Enough shouting. Kill whoever wants to cause more trouble.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The shouting stopped right away. Everyone heard him clearly despite the low volume. The bandits, in particular, were completely shocked.

They thought that the strongest reinforcement was here; this no longer seemed to be the case. They initially thought that a new offense would launch and they would be able to kill Li Qiye.

A single command killed this dream. Nightloom sounded as if he didn’t wish to help them.

With that, Nightloom tidied up his robe and walked to Li Qiye’s front. He bowed deeply and said: “It is an honor to have you here in Cloud Dream Lake, I apologize for ruining your mood.”

Jaws dropped to the ground as a result. People couldn’t close their mouth.

“You didn’t know, it’s fine.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“The night is chilly here, please come to my humble abode…” Nightloom heaved a sigh of relief and invited.

“Go.” Li Qiye agreed right away.

“Prepare the carriage, we’re returning.” Nightloom didn’t waste time at all.

“Rumble!” The cavalry rode the waves again before astonished eyes. Li Qiye joined Nightloom on his chariot.

All of this happened too quickly and caught everyone off guard. Dark Gale Camp came thunderously and left just as fast. Most importantly, they weren’t here to help the other bandits, only to greet Li Qiye.

“What the hell is going on? What’s his relationship with Dark Gale?” Most scratched their head, looking like confused monks trying to find hair.

Just a moment ago, Li Qiye’s legion had a bloody battle against the bandits. Now, he became an esteemed guest?

“Maybe he’s from Dark Gale?” Someone boldly speculated.

“Well, we don’t know where he’s from so that’s a possibility.” One expert said.

There was no reasonable explanation for the development just now.

“Even if he’s from Dark Gale, he should only be an important disciple or successor at best. That doesn’t explain Nightloom’s attitude.” A last-gen cultivator said.

“I don’t think he is related to Dark Gale. Don’t forget, he’s the richest man in the world while Dark Gale is in charge of the bandits. If they become an alliance, they’ll have both manpower and resources.” One ancestor mused.

“You’re saying that Dark Gale wants to team up with Li Qiye for a more ambitious goal?” His friend responded.
