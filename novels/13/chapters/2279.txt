An Eternal like Everlasting Elder Lord was intimidating. His words were no joke, so many became stirred.

All eyes were on Li Qiye, wondering if he could stop the elder lord. If not, then it was over for the valley if they didn’t have an Eternal as well.

Li Qiye didn’t become angry: “Good, are you coming to die or must I make a trip there to take your head?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I’ll kill you first then the valley. Initiate the momentum.” The elder lord coldly declared.

With that, the imperial palace of Everlasting lit up. The peaks there became bright with dao lines filled with the aura of emperors and eternals.

“Buzz.” With the imperial palace at the center, these lights began to spread across Everlasting. It didn’t take long before ten million miles of territory lit up with lines, turning into a great formation.

“Everlasting is going all out now, throwing their foundation into the mix as well. Failure would be the end of them.” Many cultivators in Longevity were startled.

Everlasting was built on the dao foundation of Longevity. The creator of this kingdom fortified its territories with his merit laws. The wise sages from later generations did the same. Thus, they began to have their own foundation and momentum.

Because of this, they didn’t need to rely on Longevity as much. Their action so far meant betting everything their forefathers have done today.

“Longevity shall fall!” This chant echoed across their kingdom. All disciples, regardless of strong or weak, began to recite this unique yet frightening chant.

Strands of light emanated from their body and joined with their kingdom’s foundation. The inhabitants of this kingdom became inseparable. If Everlasting were to fall, they would turn to ashes as well.

Twenty-five figures appeared in the group of temples where the elder lord resided. These were old men on the verge of death. Nevertheless, their chants were louder than anyone else; their light brighter, almost like the sun.

“The twenty-five high ancestors!” These were the final ace cards of Everlasting, their strongest ancestors.

Though they weren’t as strong as Everlasting Elder Lord, they were superior to the thirty-six Dragon Sovereigns.

These were warriors who have been bestowed titles by True Emperors. They had great status and authority on top of being quite mighty, also known as the final shields of Everlasting. They wouldn’t appear unless there was no other choice.

Now, Everlasting used both their foundation and these ancestors. Their entire kingdom was of one heart and mind.

“Everlasting is so ambitious, victory or defeat, there is no returning.” One ancestor shuddered with fear.

These disciples were willing to die with their kingdom for this coup. The power of solidarity was a great one.

The momentum of their kingdom widened, resulting in loud noises.

Everlasting Elder Lord slowly picked up a strange round disk, resembling an observation wheel or a water wheel. It was made from imperial steel. The spokes of the wheel grew bigger from the center while the wheel hubs were engraved with multiple imperial gems. These gems have been refined by True Emperors before. The wheel itself was filled with the best true stones.

“This type of imperial steel can only be found above!” A representative recognized the materials.

The Untethered’s eyes narrowed. A dao system couldn’t find this material that easily. Though her sect possessed some, Everlasting wasn’t strong enough to have so many. It meant that someone was helping them. Like the elder lord had said, this wasn’t a simple coup.

The wheel began to spin with an increasingly faster pace. The rays emanated from it made the heart beat faster because it had a dark glow. This seemed to be the power of darkness.

The momentum of Everlasting opened completely. The entire kingdom was filled with this vast power. Lightning bolts crossed through the sky, striking any foe that dares to take a step inside.

Once the wheel reached the right speed, it assumed an ethereal form. The space around it trembled and all of the black rays gathered at the very center of the wheel.

With that, space collapsed and was replaced by a black hole. Runes now took shape on the wheel, connecting its flow with the darkness.

“Boom!” The power of the entire kingdom poured into the black hole. It devoured all of the incoming power without fail.

It grew in size and spun proportionally to the rotational speed of the wheel, becoming the most terrible absorption force. Eventually, it devoured all of the kingdom’s power.

An unbelievable thing happened - the black hole was turning its sight towards Longevity.

The system was affected and had earthquakes everywhere. People naturally turned pale.

Keep in mind that the system was refined by Alchemy Immortal and protected by his power. However, it was still shaking from this force right now. The dao foundation of the system was being dragged in.

“Buzz.” it retaliated by activating its own rays. The areas around Everlasting were especially dazzling. This was the automatic defensive measure of Longevity.
