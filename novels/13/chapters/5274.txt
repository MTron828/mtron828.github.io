Chapter 5275: Dragon Heart

A few things here couldn’t be seen in the outside world. For example, when the group turned a corner, they heard an advertisement regarding dragons.

“Dragon meat, fresh! Very reasonably priced! Dragon meat!” A merchant shouted.

Li Zhitian took a deep breath after seeing this: “Fuck, that’s a big adult true dragon.”

The great beast lay before them with its eyes closed, brimming with a divine aura. Each scale shimmered brightly and its very presence caused auspicious images to appear above.

It was unknown whether the creature was alive or dead. Nonetheless, just one drop of blood would be immeasurably beneficial to any cultivator.

This was not a so-called “true dragon” in the mortal world. Those true dragons clearly evolved from lizards and serpents. This one was the real thing.

The seller was a man wearing a crimson robe. He exuded an air of dignity as if he was sitting among the clouds. His charisma was second to none.

However, he held a butcher blade while loudly peddling: “Dragon meat for an incredible price!”

“Are you really selling dragon meat?” Li Zhitian murmured.

True Bear cried out several times, not daring to get close to the dragon.

“Why would I be lying?” The man glared at Li Zhitian and said: “Little grandson, how many pounds do you want?” [1]

“...” Zhitian felt as if he was being insulted by this address, thinking that he had misheard.

“Give me half to bring home.” A man only around twenty years of age said. However, he had an ancient aura as if he had just walked out from an old painting due to his old crest and sword.

The seller in crimson ignored him, causing him to touch the true dragon: “Cut from here and give me this side, I don’t want the other.”

The seller still ignored him.

“Start cutting already, I have to start the stew soon.” The man insisted but was treated like air again.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Are you selling or not?!” He finally raised his voice.

“You didn’t pay last time.” The man in crimson finally stared at him.

“Ridiculous, my clan is known for being wealthy with inexhaustible treasures, we can last for thirty generations while trying to spend it all, don’t slander me, I don’t know you any money.” The young man stared with his eyes wide open.

“Slander? You took half the dragon meat last time and still didn’t pay.” The man in crimson said.

“Given how rich I am, do you think I give a damn about a few coins?” The young man pulled up his sleeves and looked like a prodigal young master: “Keep on spewing this nonsense and I’ll buy your entire business up.”

“What nonsense? You really did ate half of my meat and didn’t pay.” The true dragon suddenly got up and pointed at the youth while shouting.

This left the group slack-jawed with the exception of Li Qiye. Why did the dragon help the butcher argue about debt? Moreover, wasn’t it half-eaten?

“You… you…” The young man pointed at the dragon and stammered: “You watch your mouth too! We have too much money to spend, I can easily afford your crappy meat!”

“Should I cut open your stomach and have a look?” The dragon stared at him in response.

“You evil dragon! You deserve death a thousand times!” The young man shouted: “I should boil and fry you every day!”

“Too bad you can’t.” The dragon gloated and lay back down; its expression infuriated the youth and made him leave.

“Dragon meat for sale here!” The man in crimson started advertising again.

“Are you really selling?” Li Zhitian stared at the dragon, confused.

“Little grandson, are you buying or not?” The man in crimson stared at Li Zhitian, seemingly thinking that the guy was an idiot.

“Give me the heart.” Li Qiye smiled.

The man was happy to have an actual customer. He revealed a beaming smile and said: “Alright, coming right up.”

Having said that, he picked up his butcher knife and started slicing.

“Ahh!” Dragon blood and essences splashed everywhere. Everyone could see that these were priceless treasures.

“Crack!” The man moved with lightning speed. The knife was sharp enough to cut the dragon open, revealing a pulsing dragon heart.

“Not bad at all.” Li Qiye praised after seeing it.

“Taking it out now.” The man reached into the chest.

“Bam!” The dragon suddenly jumped up and yelled: “What the hell are you doing, such crappy techniques. That hurts, I’m not selling anymore.” Having said that, it started leaving while closing its chest.

“Brother Dragon, come back! Come back!” The man shouted.

“No, I’m done here.” The dragon completely ignored him and left.

Li Zhitian was left speechless by this ridiculous scene.

“Sigh, too clumsy today and couldn’t extract the heart.” The man wiped his hands and said helplessly: “Come early tomorrow, I promise I will get you that dragon heart. Be really early or someone else will take it first.”

“Tomorrow then.” Li Qiye smiled and rode the tiger away.

Once they left the stall, Zhitian asked: “Do you really want to buy that heart?”

“A guy who likes to sell and the other who likes to endure, there’s no problem here. It’s just a transaction.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I don’t understand that full-grown dragon. Why does it want to be butchered?” Zhitian said.

It was one thing for a dragon to be killed and sold. In this case, it willingly let the man in crimson cut it open.

“This act shows its worth.” Li Qiye responded.

“Uh, please elaborate.” Zhitian responded.

“An adult true dragon is so precious that it is always hunted. If there’s a dragon that isn’t desirable, then it’s not a true dragon.” Li Qiye said.

“Makes sense.” Zhitian said.

“One is willing to be butchered and the other is a butcher, a perfect match out of necessity.” Li Qiye smiled.
