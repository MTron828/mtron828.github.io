Li Qiye didn’t emit any rambunctious divinity and blinding aura right now. However, all could feel his terrible rage. This fiery anger engulfed all of Imperial, seemingly wishing to refine it to ashes.

Systems, masters, and everything else wouldn’t be spared. Imperial itself would become a casualty of his wrath. Its inhabitants were naturally nervous and panicking, truly experiencing fear.

They came to realize his destructive potential. Even the most revered existences would be killed if they were in his way. This guy clearly could destroy a system with a single move right now. Just one glare could scare a god to death.

Provoking him meant starting a massacre. Not only the provoker would die but so would his sect and system.

Feeling afraid wasn’t embarrassing at all. Knowing when to back off was better than being destroyed.

Sun Lengying and his friend tried many evasive maneuvers but it was useless. Li Qiye had refined space and messed up the boundaries of Imperial. Their escaping method looked like child’s plays in comparison. They were moving extremely fast but in Li Qiye’s eyes, they were barely moving faster than snails.

Nevertheless, the two soared ahead because the Mu System was only inches away. Just getting there meant accomplishing their mission.

“Who are those two?” Many Eternals in Imperial were surprised to see the cloaked figures.

They could see that the two were peak Eternals, judging by their speed. Alas, that’s still not enough against Li Qiye. Eternals were insignificant before his apocalyptic wrath.

“They must have truly crossed the line to piss Fiercest off so badly. This will drag their sect and system into the mix, everyone’s gonna die.” One Eternal shook his head.

It was obvious that only Solar Daoist has a chance against Fiercest in the present day. Anyone else was simply courting death.

They must have touched Fiercest’s proverbial reversed scale in order to make him so angry.

“Still resorting to trickery before me?” Li Qiye only needed one step to catch up.

“Boom!” A massive wave erupted and spread at an unprecedented rate. It destroyed everything around it and even the stars and galaxies above.

Sun Lengying and his ally were shrouded in a sacred light. They took out dozens of defensive artifacts but still failed to stop the offensive wave.

“Bang!” Their treasures shattered and they were blown flying while vomiting blood. Their concealment methods were nullified as well.

Few people could actually handle one move from Li Qiye when he was serious. It was impressive that these two managed to stay alive. Nevertheless, they were bloodied all over and have revealed their true appearance.

“What?! Sun Lengying, and that’s Lucidity King, how can this be?!” Many were startled.

“I thought Lucidity King passed away...?” Some became dumbfounded.

The entire world knew about his passing. Who would have thought that the king was still alive and had no signs of illness?

The spectators glanced at each other. Rumors about the end of his life span had circulated for a long time in the past and that he could have died at any moment.

Because of this, no one was surprised to hear about his death due to a depletion of vitality. It was already a miracle for him to live this long.

However, he was perfectly fine once more so the crowd became astounded.

“Lucidity King is too treacherous. I saw him before and his life span was really over then, looking quite weak. What an act he put on.” One grand alchemist said.

The king had asked the world for longevity medicine, so numerous famous alchemists have been invited to make longevity pills.

They have visited and checked Lucidity King’s pulses, noting that he was indeed on his last leg from all possible angles.

It became clear that everything was a lie before, just an act for the world to see. Sun Lengying was his accomplice.

“I don’t get it, Lucidity King even passed the throne to Fiercest. Some even said that Fiercest is his illegitimate son, so why is this happening right now?” An expert murmured.

No one could make sense of this crazy relationship. Before his death, Lucidity King appointed Li Qiye as the heir and Sun Lengying helped him during the coronation. Now, Lucidity King turned back up and Fiercest wanted to kill him?

People exchanged glances, utterly perplexed.

“Where is she?” Li Qiye looked down on the world. Everyone else seemed like ants to him, even powerful Eternals like Lucidity King and Sun Lengying. They were no different than a common folk in his eyes.

“We got ambushed and someone else took her.” Lucidity King calmly revealed since it has gotten to this point.
