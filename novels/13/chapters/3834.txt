Chapter 3835: Dao Lords' Suppression

The coming of the devil kings horrified the spectators. Some of these beings were unreasonably mighty, superior to the gods above the nine firmaments.

All living beings were mere ants. This was the case for supreme-level characters as well. Their auras permeated across the massive ocean.

Just a few remnant strands making it this far to the cliff were too much for people to take. Their legs trembled as they turned pale.

The ancestors thought that they would be nothing more than insects. The horde of devils would instantly obliterate them.

This was the case for the upper echelon of the Biandu as well. As guardians of the region for eras, there were times when the ocean gave them certain benefits such as treasures. However, this event was unprecedented. There was nothing similar in their historical scrolls.

One ancestor thought that maybe they knew nothing about Black Tides besides the bare minimum.

“Is the world about to turn into hell?” Another ancestor shuddered.

If this horde were to reach the holy ground, the consequence would be unimaginable.

“Amitabha.” A chant suddenly came from the depth as well.

It echoed and suppressed everything. Even those back in Black Wood could hear it.

“Boom!” A massive Buddhist palm descended from the black sky and swept away the clouds. Its radiance illuminated the entire holy ground.

A swastika was engraved in the palm. This seal was the source of the light and its targets were the devil kings.

“Buddha Dao Lord!” Everyone thought of this dao lord right away after seeing the palm.

“Clank!” An ebony sword slash quelled the chaos and severed the six dao. The surging ocean was subdued by this slash since it contained an indomitable will.

Righteousness will always prevail! This slash was the embodiment of this dao lord’s intent. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Righteous Dao Lord!” A few big shots shouted.

People still sensed the dao lord’s intent despite being so far away. They started kneeling with haste.

A finger appeared next, giving birth to a lotus flower. Another Buddhist chant sounded to bring peace to the ages. Its light could enlighten all living beings and chase the darkness away. It attempted to convert the devil kings at the bottom of the ocean.

This process encompassed serenity and gentleness. The crowd was soothed as well; their mind became stronger.

“Dhyana Dao Lord!” Everyone recognized the user of this technique.

They didn’t have time to calm down because a vajra manifested for an onslaught. The ocean bed had cracks everywhere. Numerous devils were reduced to dust.

All were insects before the devils. Well, they were worms before this wondrous vajra. The destruction spanned across the entire southern West King.

No one thought they had a chance of surviving when facing this vajra.

“Vajra Dao Lord!” They shouted. This was too obvious.

The techniques of these dao lords began ravaging the ocean’s depth to the crowd’s astonishment.

The blood sun seemed to be furious and gathered its power. The water of the ocean was lifted up and blotted out the sky, acting like a barrier. This concealed the scene and no one could see any more.

Occasionally, certain beams and rays would shoot out of the barrier. The spectators could sense the apocalyptic attacks happening there.

“The dao lords are still with us in this world?” One young cultivator asked.

“Of course not.” A senior shook his head: “These are only techniques left behind to suppress Black Tides.”

“This might be the reason for the wise sages’ expeditions.” One ancestor said: “They left behind these ace cards in the depth so that this ocean would be suppressed for eras. It’s meant for our protection.”

The spectators became emotional. They could see the struggle and love from their ancestors.

Prior to this, the goals of the expeditions weren’t clear. Now, the dao lords simply wanted to protect the descendants.

“Rumble!” Eventually, the surging water returned to the ocean floor. The surface rippled and splashed violently for quite a bit before calming down.

Black Tides looked the same as before. The waves and fog were there; the red sun was no longer in sight along with the devil kings and the dao lords’ techniques.

Of course, people knew that they weren’t just seeing a mirage or an illusion. All of this really happened.
