Chapter 5569: Annoying Fly

Supreme was a dragon lord who could command emperors and conquerors. Could Wang Teng do the same?

He certainly didn’t let the clan down - obtaining twelve sacred fruits in one attempt at a young age. He crafted his immortal shell shortly after and found anima, living up to his fame as the future greatest dragon lord.

This exaggeration carried a hint of truth. Many believed that he could actually become someone like Supreme or greater in just three hundred to five hundred years.

His current title was North Star Grand Saint Wang Teng, the third-ranking member of the twenty-four dragon lords of West Bank. The first ranker was Wang Taishou, his ancestor and a cultivator who stood shoulder to shoulder with Supreme in the past.

It made sense for Turmoil Conqueror to be proud given his son’s potential. Perhaps he would be the one to lead Dao City against Celestial Court in the future.

“Will North Star Grand Saint show up as well?” A spectator wondered.

Having dao lords and conquerors as parents was often difficult. After all, surpassing them was virtually impossible. However, North Star Grand Saint managed to do so.

“I’m sure many more conquerors and dao lords are here, they’re just keeping a low profile.” Someone else remarked.

The others didn’t wish to antagonize the deities of Momentous Frontier. The same couldn’t be said for Turmoil Conqueror.

Some speculated that Turmoil Conqueror was purposely putting on this act to let others know about their intention regarding the immortal weapon. Their confidence was warranted given the current political climate in Dao City.

Li Qiye’s group arrived at a remote area with sparse vegetation and trees. Only mountain ranges could be seen in the distance.

“Right here.” Li Qiye said.

“Haha, it wants us to search? Don’t worry, Young Master, leave the dirty manual labor to us.” Niu Fen pulled up his sleeves and said excitedly since the immortal weapon was near.

He recalled his attempt at obtaining the one back in Black Tides. Unfortunately, that failed entirely.

Of course, this was more of a joke because it wouldn’t take an apex dao lord more than a second to excavate the land.

“Rumble!” Suddenly, a golden carriage with cascading imperial laws stopped before them, no longer soaring forward.

“State your name.” Turmoil Conqueror looked down imperiously.

The big shots nearby were surprised to see this. They took a closer look at Li Qiye’s group - a dragon lord and two strange individuals, a demon and an ordinary youth.

As an apex dao lord utilizing a disguise, the average conqueror couldn't detect Niu Fen’s true form and identity.

“Turmoil Conqueror, a member of Imperial West Bank.” Baifeng whispered to Li Qiye.

“None of your business.” Niu Fen shouted instead, not giving a damn about a five-fruit conqueror.

“You killed our soldiers?” Turmoil got straight to the point; his aura surged forward with the intent of knocking her down to the ground.

She released her six fruits and laws, enough to stop his attack. Alas, she was the clear underdog in this case.

“They killed West Bank soldiers??” Others heard this and discussed the issue. Killing soldiers was akin to declaring war on West Bank.

“Conqueror, your generals and soldiers ran rampant at our frontier, they deserved death.” Baifeng calmly answered, not accepting fault.

Turmoil’s eyes flashed intimidatingly with penetrating rays after hearing this. Many big shots felt intimidated by his power.

“Momentous Frontier is not qualified to deliver sentences on our soldiers.” He said domineeringly.

“Enough of this annoying fly, get rid of it.” Li Qiye was in no mood and ordered Niu Fen.

“Very well.” Niu Fen has been waiting for this and immediately waved at the conqueror: “Brat, my young master is in a foul mood today and you’re only making it worse. Slap yourself one hundred times and skedaddle or I will beat you down and make you piss your pants.”

His audacity and wanton disregard for Imperial West Bank left everyone speechless.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Although Turmoil Conqueror wasn’t unbeatable, few existences could take down a five-fruit conqueror in the grand scheme of things. Moreover, he had a monstrous clan behind him as well.

“Who is he?” A big shot wondered while staring at Niu Fen.

“Boom!” Turmoil frowned and activated his frightening imperial aura, starting a storm of power.
