Chapter 4197: Limitless Sword Formation

There were victors and losers in Sword Ocean, either rewarded with fortunes or death.

Some groups lost every single member but this didn’t deter the mass’ enthusiasm. Whenever good news came out about someone obtaining a divine sword, others couldn’t help but jump into the ocean.

“Rumble!” Explosions could be heard from the oceans. Hurricanes and tidal waves came subsequently.

“What’s going on?!” This startled those nearby.

A beam shot to the sky, looking like the strongest of its kind in the world. The clear light illuminated the entire ocean.

“Are you seeing this?!” It stole everyone’s attention.

What made this beam special were the dao runes accompanying it. This made the beam even brighter; the runes seemed to be empowering it.

It served as a pillar capable of shouldering the sky and connecting it with the ground. It seemed that climbing up was a way to reach immortality or travel through time.

Spectators felt time slowing down, that they could catch every single detail of a blossoming flower. Their swords then resonated with the beam, wanting to fly out of the scabbard.

Golden particles eventually scattered from the beam; the sword resonation became more violent. Owners had a harder time holding on to their sword.

“Can someone tell me what the hell is going on?!” A youth shouted.

“It’s an ultimate divine sword emerging.” An expert knew right away.

“That place used to be shrouded by dense fog. I’ve been lost there before.” An experienced cultivator was surprised.

“You’re right, it was so easy to get lost there.” An ancestor agreed.

“What are we waiting for then?!” The crowd shouted and soared towards the beam.

“It’s such an incredible phenomenon. Can it be a heavenly sword?” Someone else asked.

“It could be Myriad Era, time is of the essence!” An ancestor who heard about this became impatient.

It didn’t take long before this became the new focus at the ocean. No one wanted to miss this opportunity.

“If it’s actually Myriad Era, whoever gets it will be unstoppable.” Some started fantasizing even before catching a glimpse of this heavenly sword.

Everyone knew that heavenly swords were even stronger than dao lord swords. Thus, the temptation was irresistible.

The only one yet to be seen among the nine was Myriad Era, rumored to be the leader and the strongest.

Once people got there, the thick mist was gone and replaced by a blue ocean with golden shimmering.

The source of the golden glow came from the broken ships in this region. Some were made from a golden metal, still as shiny as before. A few were well-preserved enough to be taken out and reused.

People noticed and desired them right away. Each usable ship was an expensive treasure. Alas, this wasn’t the time for salvaging.

The most important thing was a particular island with two parallel mountains forming a valley - the source of the beam.

From a distance, it looked like a portal to an immortal world. Spectators found it impossible to contain their excitement.

“It has to be there!” A cultivator pointed at the island.

“Come, we’re getting on the island!” One ancestor ordered his men.

However, this group was stopped by a series of tablets descending from above. Loud detonations from their appearance deterred the newcomers.

They landed on the ocean and created massive waves. However, they floated and didn’t sink to the bottom.

The tablets were covered in diamond-shaped runes. They activated and immediately sealed the surrounding waters.

“Diamond Rampart!” The ancestor was astounded.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Nine-wheel Citadel! Are they trying to monopolize the island?!” An expert shouted.

“They’re too unreasonable!” Those from bigger sects such as Armament and Wooden Sword didn’t appreciate this.

They knew that Nine-wheel Citadel was strong but it couldn’t afford to face the wrath from everyone else.

“It has to be Myriad Era for them to do this, right?” Someone speculated.

“Open!” A high elder from a prestigious clan could wait no longer and began attacking the wall.

“Boom!” The attack caused some lights to disperse but didn’t move the wall in the slightest.

“Clank!” Loud sword hymns suddenly echoed.

People looked up and saw countless swords descending.

“Retreat!” They reacted quickly and left the area of effect.

These swords came together to form a massive sword formation - always rotating and releasing a murderous aura.

“Limitless Sword Formation!” Experts shuddered after seeing this.

“That’s a sword formation from Sea Emperor.” The crowd was smart enough to keep a distance.

“Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel are working together…” Everyone understood what was going on.
