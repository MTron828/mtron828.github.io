The egg has been here all along. If others were to see it, they would be driven to insanity.

Its value was immeasurable. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it was far more precious than a dao lord.

There have been plenty of dao lords in history, the same couldn’t be said about this egg. The thing was real; a phoenix might come out of it with a pure bloodline.

Unfortunately, years have passed and it still didn’t finish the incubation stage.

Others might not know the reason. Some would assume that a lengthy period was required for the beast of a divine egg.

This wasn’t the case for Li Qiye since he let this phoenix roam free back then.

“Still not enough.” He shook his head: “A fiery rebirth isn’t that easy. The villainous heaven doesn’t allow it.”

This phoenix roamed through space back then, seeking a way to reach rebirth. It experienced numerous tribulations and accumulated wondrous resources. In the end, failure was still the result.

Of course, when strictly speaking, this phoenix still didn’t fail. At the very least, it still left behind an egg.

This was an opportunity eager to strike when everything lined up perfectly. It would be able to break out of the shell and soar above the nine firmaments once more.

Alas, fiery rebirth could be considered a great tribulation. The process back then invited a disaster, resulting in flaws in the egg. Otherwise, it would have hatched long ago.

Li Qiye stopped looking at the egg and focused on the entire nest instead. The profundity of this place was endless and complicated, on the verge of being inscrutable despite trying for a lifetime.

However, it was continuously evolving and being derived in Li Qiye’s eyes. He became immersed while appreciating its beauty.

“Click, click, click...” He gently knocked the entire nest, also in a special rhythm. An unknown power firmly took root in the area.

The nest seemingly came back to life. In the next second, it disappeared from sight, replaced by a massive cosmo. Each star here had a unique glow and an eternal mystery.

A light flashed on Li Qiye’s forehead. This radiance turned into a dazzling maelstrom.

The stars in the cosmos started flying towards Li Qiye’s forehead as if they had finally figured out their end destination.

A portal appeared there and absorbed in all the magical essences. Loud clunks sounded as the dao laws as big as gigantic veins twisted together to form a supreme grand dao inside his brain.

“The innate grand dao of a phoenix, rebirth.” He took a look and sighed: “Unfortunately, this isn’t the path I’m looking for, not what I want.”

Each divine beast had a unique gift, allowing them to be mighty and peerless. Others would be ecstatic and jump up and down after obtaining one.

Li Qiye remained calm. Rebirth in this manner was brilliant but not part of his pursuit. It simply didn’t matter to him.

After the cosmos disappeared, the nest still looked the same as before. An outsider wouldn’t be able to figure it out.

Li Qiye put away the feather since it could be used to create an amazing outfit. He then looked at the egg.

Only a fool would leave it here but Li Qiye had no intention of taking it away. This place was the most suitable for its incubation.

The entire domain served this purpose, especially the raging inferno. Taking it out of this place would remove the favorable circumstances, resulting in greater difficulties.

“Fine, since we have met again, I shall grant you a fortune.” Li Qiye said.

He became serious and raised his hand. A force enveloped the entire egg.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” He sent out lightning bolts towards the phoenix.

The thing lit up, not because of the bright bolts but because something in there was activating, seemingly reacting to the incoming currents.

The power of the heavenly tribulation continued to pour into the egg. Li Qiye seemed to be the high heaven unleashing its supreme wrath to destroy this egg. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A phoenix screech could be heard inside the light within the egg. A tiny phoenix flapped its wings and attacked the sky with its endless flame, wanting to stop the terrible tribulation.

Alas, how could this little phoenix contend against the almighty Li Qiye? It cried out in pain as its wings were broken by the bolts.

Alas, it didn’t give up and healed its injuries, flapping its wings to meet the tribulation head-on. This seemed to be rather futile.

“Activate!” Li Qiye raised his other hand and grasped the universe along with the little phoenix, protecting it with chaos energy.

This empowerment allowed the divine bird to survive and bathe in the tribulation.

“Screech!” The revitalized bird flew up and attacked the tribulation again.

This contest lasted for quite a while. The continuous battles and surpassing the tribulations matured the bird.

Li Qiye’s clothes were drenched in sweat during this process. Of course, efforts were always rewarded.

The little bird gradually turned into a full-fledged phoenix capable of soaring above the skies. Its feathers radiated an amazing glow, enough to deter anyone. It looked divine and unbeatable. Once it broke out of its shell, a true phoenix would come out.

Li Qiye put his hands down and sat in the meditative pose to recover.

The supreme phoenix inside the egg stared at Li Qiye and let out a screech of gratitude. The light within slowly dissipated.

Everything returned to before as if nothing had happened.
