Chapter 4617: Fire Dragon Mantra

“Raa!” The three puppets then tore the firebird apart to the astonishment of the crowd. They didn’t expect the puppets to be so strong.

“What the hell are they?” A spectator became startled. These puppets weren’t afraid of fire at all on top of being physically capable.

“Must be something from the ancient age.” An ancestor saw the clues and said: “Runes are embedded in the puppet via an inscrutable method. Whoever created them must have been insanely strong.”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Voidburn Godchild staggered backward after his firebird was destroyed.

He thought that Jian Ming was only a nobody, not competitive at all. It shouldn’t be difficult for a godchild of Voidburn like him to take the brat down.

He would be able to show his abilities in front of Ye Tingrong. Perhaps she would have a more favorable opinion of him as a result.

Unfortunately, the battle didn’t go as planned since he lost the first exchange in a humiliating manner.

“Good!” The daoist wasn’t stingy with his praises: “Brat, beat him up!”

“I’ll do more than beat him up, he’s dead.” Jian Ming declared in an imperious manner.

After all, he was a member of a truly prominent clan and possessed a noble bloodline. His talent and comprehension weren’t inferior to any young successor. Alas, his attitude and unsavory conduct made people think of him as a shady merchant.

“Chicken, is this all you got?” He laughed and said: “Weren’t you awfully confident earlier? Looks like you’re all bark and no bite, haha!” Jian Ming’s foul mouth went back to work once more.

Voidburn’s face turned red as he trembled with rage. Geniuses like him weren’t used to this treatment.

“He deserves it.” A listener whispered after seeing his enraged appearance.

“Ignorant fool, I shall cut you to pieces even if it’s the last thing I do.” Voidburn gritted his teeth.

“Wow, I’m so scared.” Jian Ming sarcastically said while patting his chest: “Unfortunately, the last thing you’ll do is die in this battle.”

“Die!” Voidburn Godchild’s seven halos slowly floated upward and spewed out runic flames.

“Fire Dragon Mantra!” Voidburn’s roar echoed across Golden Gate.

“Boom!” Heat waves the size of a tsunami manifested into reality. Time and space turned into ashes as a result.

“Raa!” A draconic and primal aura engulfed the battlefield even before the appearance of the beast.

In the next second, a large fire dragon appeared with its claws at the ready. Everyone felt their mouth being parched from the high temperature. It coiled in the air and painted everything with a red shade. The sky vault was on the verge of melting.

“Fire Dragon Mantra, a technique comparable to dao lord merit law.” People were impressed to see this technique created by Skyfire True Dragon, the first disciple of Eight-step Dragon Dao Lord.

“Dragon Trample!” Voidburn controlled the grand dao and channeled his chaos true energy to control the dragon. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The sky turned dark as the dragon leaped downward with enough momentum to rend the earth. Worst of all, the claws also wielded all-melting flames.

The four puppets couldn’t stop the technique known as Dragon Temple and were sent flying. When the claws reached the ground, they left behind deep prints with lava oozing out.

“Puppet Formation.” Jian Ming released his vitality and his runes entered the four puppets.

“Boom!” The puppets exploded and all of their runes drilled into the ground.

In the next second, an overgrowth of runes rushed out of the ground and intertwined together with incredible speed to form dao strings.

Countless strings wrapped tightly around the fire dragon, making it look like a preserved corpse.

“Burn!” Voidburn Godchild roared. The dragon’s flame intensified and became hotter but this wasn’t enough to burn the runic dao strings.

The eruption of runes never stopped. “Boom!” Eventually, the runes formed a puppet even larger than the fire dragon.

“Boom!” It then pulled the dragon down from the sky before astonished eyes. The dragon smashed into the ground, leaving a deep pit.

“Ugh…” Voidburn Godchild became seriously injured and vomited a mouthful of blood.

“It’s so strong!” A spectator shouted.

“Well done.” The daoist praised.

“This puppet is incredible.” Paramount Scion added.

“So it turns out that Fellow Daoist Jian has always been hiding his power.” Ye Tingrong gained a new perspective on Jian Ming.

“Haha, this brat has more ace cards up his sleeves but he’s never serious.” The daoist laughed.

She heard this and stared carefully at Jian Ming. It seemed that he was just as strong as any successor around his age. Alas, he chose to do unsavory stuff such as mingling with ruffians and being a merchant instead.
