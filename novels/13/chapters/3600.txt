Chapter 3601: Just Statues

A powerful lineage like the holy ground was extremely influential. However, its foundation was affected by a new academy yet it had no response.

Future generations still found this unbelievable. However, Duality Master was indeed an unbelievable existence.

Its first day was a magnificent and unprecedented occasion. All of Eight Desolaces were affected by this.

Apricot Dao Lord personally came with peerless scriptures as gifts. [1]

Moreover, the strongest ancestors and existences in Eight Desolaces eventually arrived with gifts as well.

True Immortal Sect, Primal Immortal Mountain, Sword School, Righteous Sect, Pure Yang Clan, Lion’s Roar Country, Wild East Eight Kingdoms, Ancestral City... These behemoths that have dominated before came to celebrate. [2]

The gathering of these lords was unmatched in history. Even the coronations of dao lords lacked the same extravagance and impact.

Furthermore, the gifts they brought were incredible - paramount weapons and artifacts, enough to shock the world.

In fact, even the strongest ancestor of Buddha Holy Ground personally led his favorite disciples to celebrate the opening of Duality. He brought gifts too, of course.

Such a thing remained a mystery. Duality Master did nothing short of taking over the holy ground’s territory for his academy. However, Buddha Holy Ground didn’t retaliate in the slightest and actually brought gifts for the occasion.

The legend didn’t end there. Duality Master performed the first lesson for the opening ceremony.

Who were the members of the audience? Apricot Dao Lord, ancient ancestors, sword gods...

They were the strongest characters in the era yet they still wanted to listen to the lecture. Some said that this was the most prestigious classroom ever. Only Heavenly Sovereigns were eligible to be there.

This incredible history laid an unshakable foundation for Duality Academy. It wasn’t the oldest academy in Eight Desolaces but was once the most illustrious.

The present couldn’t compare to the past when Duality Master was still around. Nonetheless, its influence still remained.

Moreover, it had produced plenty of geniuses including several dao lords. For example, the third dao lord of the holy ground - Dhyana. He studied at the academy first before entering Sacred Mountain.

Three Truths Dao Lord also studied at the academy before branching out. Another famous student was Heaven Devourer Dao Lord who revitalized Righteous later on as its second dao lord.

Righteous and Buddha Holy Ground had an unceasing rivalry in history and the academy had influence in both.

As for Heavenly Sovereigns? There were too many to count. Let’s not dwell on the ones from the older period. The most famous and strongest one recently was Mad Blade.

He studied at the academy during his youth and created a unique saber art later on. He swept through Eight Desolaces and proved his supremacy.

All in all, whether it be the past or the present, Duality Academy was still well-respected by cultivators.

The greatest geniuses didn’t dare to be haughty while standing in front of its gates. They knew that they were nothing compared to Apricot Dao Lord and others who have listened to the lectures here before.

Li Qiye arrived while riding Lil’ Black. He smiled while looking at the landscape consisting of grand mountains and glorious rivers. Some peaks reached the sky with waterfalls streaming down.

Pavilions and buildings scattered across the area. A peak might have a single one at the pinnacle. Another mountain might have buildings built around it. Bridges connected these mountains.

The academy only had ten thousand miles of territory so students were everywhere. They rode their mount or flying sword...

The truth was that this prosperity and liveliness could also be found in the rest of Metropolis. That’s why this was the golden region of Buddha Holy Ground.

“Duality.” The old man said; vivid images of the past resurfaced in his mind.

“This is the largest academy in Eight Desolaces?” Fan Bai stared intensely.

Fan Bai was certainly not the only one affected by the grand atmosphere here. Virtually all first-timers felt the same way.

“Pretty much.” The old man smiled: “It can’t compare to the past but still has 100,000 students or so. The dynasties always send their princes and descendants to the academy too.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s go in.” Li Qiye smiled and moved forward with Lil’ Black.

100,000 was a commonly quoted number when talking about Duality. However, some thought that this was a low estimation.

One didn’t need to be from Buddha Holy Ground to join the academy. Anyone from Eight Desolaces could give it a shot without meeting prejudice.

Moreover, it didn’t forbid visitors either. Even a mortal could come here for a trip. This was one of its best aspects.

Just think about it, many mortals considered the big sects as something unreachable. Regular cultivators were treated like gods so mortals weren’t qualified to enter such places. The other academies had the same factor.

This wasn’t the case for Duality. As long as one could make it here, they could come in freely. This added to the number of people currently present in the academy, adding to its liveliness.

The mortals eventually built towns at the base of the mountains. Thousands of them lived here and added more excitement.

It wasn’t strange to see anyone from any race in Duality. However, Li Qiye’s group attracted special attention.

It wasn’t because of Fan Bai or the old servant, just Li Qiye. It had nothing to do with good looks either, just his unique mount.

When the big shots came to visit Duality, they rode flood dragons and heavenly stallions...

These mounts weren’t surprising at all. The problem was - Li Qiye was riding a black boar.

He looked exactly like a country bumpkin especially with the hatchet hanging on his waist.

Both students and pedestrians pointed their fingers and whispered.

Li Qiye had a natural expression but Lil’ Black was raising its head and arching its chest, trying to look intimidating and cool.

Unfortunately, this had the opposite effect. Others found it hilarious; a few girls quietly smiled while looking at the boar.

1. Mei = Apricot/plum flower. I’m thinking that it could be Mei Suyao so Dao Lord Mei is correct too in that case. It’s not common to have one’s name in the title though, at least for dao lords. Either name works.

2. Better write all of these names down in my note
