A single punch repelled the darkness in a domineering fashion. The inhabitants of Three Immortals were left speechless on their knees.

They saw the majestic figure in the immortal light earlier - unique and peerless in history. Progenitors and immortals weren’t worth bringing up in his presence. He was the only true immortal.

“Prime! It’s Prime!” An ancient existence in Three Immortals shouted emotionally.

“He’s saving us again!” Tears flowed down everyone’s cheeks as they kowtowed.

“Prime Progenitor!” Li Qiye’s title echoed across the world, becoming an eternal legend.

Many masters in the expanse also bowed deeply to show their respect.

“Boom!” Li Qiye stepped into the other world without any hesitation or fear.

Each step was decisive and convincing. He didn’t look back a single time as if there was nothing here that could hold him back - a testament to his dao heart and desire.

He wanted to enter this world with the greatest momentum, taking the problem down at its source.

“Seal!” The three immortals roared right after he got in there and worked together to use a mighty force to push the world barrier, closing the rift.

“Rumble!” The rift gradually became smaller. This process appeased the spectators, saving them from further anxiety.

They knew that the closing of this rift would mean that their world was safe again.

Of course, ordinary people had no idea how much power and resources were spent by the three immortals to close it.

After the rift disappeared, the three immortals returned the tree back to the stars.

“Buzz.” The stars became lively again and rotated with incredible speed. This rotation spread life to the rest of the world.

As this affinity seeped into the fabrics of reality, a tiny change occurred. It was unnoticed by regular people, only the powerful masters could sense it.

“This is...” A powerful progenitor became startled.

“The world is awakening?” Another master speculated.

Meanwhile, those in the redemption ground didn’t care for this change. Their eyes were fixated above the sky, waiting for the worst.

“Who will die in this generation?” One overlord murmured.

The three immortals shared the same feeling. They watched with a dignified expression since this was only the beginning. They needed to prepare for any development.

The ones back in the nine worlds and thirteen continents didn’t have the privilege of watching this in person. However, they sensed the ripples of power.

“I hope for the best result.” A terrible creature in a dark dimension said.

“Yes, both sides dying in battle is the best outcome.” Many dark eyes opened, but not all the way out of fear.

Another existence had an even better wish: “Maybe more than just that. Let him sweep through and even fight that villainous heaven. Nothing is better than both of them dying.”

Li Qiye was definitely a threat to them but what looms above was even worse. It had forced them to hide for millions and millions of years. That’s why they wanted to see all of their enemies dead.

Li Qiye entered another world in a dominating fashion. This was a place no outsider has been to before. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He stood there, seemingly the unbeatable master of the universe. He scanned the area and understood everything after a flash in his eyes, capable of deducing the possibilities.

This was a silent world. No other affinity existed outside of death. Time, space, grand dao, and all else - dead.

Their death didn’t come from time and withering. They were simply sucked dry; all of their essences taken to the last bit. Only a shell of a world remained = akin to a lifeless boulder.

An ashen hue permeated the land. No light could be seen since they have been drained already; the sun, moon, and stars had nothing left. Many stars have actually fallen down to the ground.

This world was massive. In fact, the three thousand words that Li Qiye knew might not be as big as this one.

Even the strongest character and their power wouldn’t make a difference when coming here, similarly to a drop of water touching a desert.

However, his presence was instantly noted by many eyes opening wide. Alas, they didn’t bring life to this world, only more darkness.

No, that’s incorrect. Darkness was actually a type of power, an affinity of sorts. The darkness here wasn’t the same. This was a black hue of death.

Existences awakened and brought with them terrible abysses capable of swallowing everything. Even a little stone would be robbed of everything after falling in, leaving only behind the useless dregs.

After arriving here, people would find out that the darkness wasn’t the scariest thing. The unknown murkiness was far worse.

At the very least, darkness was still a form of life. Here, only death and devourment.

In other words, they would understand the source of darkness. Once this murky aura became filled and satiated, it would turn into darkness.

The top masters and progenitors would feel powerless while standing here. Their legs would start trembling.

Fighting wasn’t necessary because they knew of their grim outcome. On the contrary, Li Qiye withstood the black devourment as if he was above them.

“Boom!” During his arrival, a loud blast could be heard as a monstrous creature was pushed back.

This was the thing wanting to invade Three Immortals but failed due to Li Qiye’s interference.

“Ages flew by, finally a guest.” The existence’s voice echoed.

He used an ancient language transmitted by his divine intent. Those who didn’t know this language still understood him.
