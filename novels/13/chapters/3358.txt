“Clank!” The slash contained righteous dao, karma, and great fortune. It had reached a state of apogee. The myriad laws were overshadowed as a result.

Only a saint could unleash this slash. There was only one in Divine Black - Ping Suoweng.

This was a move from the South Conch Sword Art, certainly top-notch in the current generation.

Everyone knew that he had reached an immaculate level with this art, not inferior to those before him.

The lightning bolts were severed and the storm disappeared. Light returned to the sky since no affinity could stop this slash.

The demon king might be strong but was still far from being Suoweng’s match. One was at the myriad-form realm while the other Grand Dao Sacred Physique - the difference of an entire realm.

“Crack!” Brains and blood splattered. Zhan Hu couldn’t scream this time since his head was fully crushed by Li Qiye’s foot.

By this point, the speechless crowd didn’t know if they were more shocked at Zhan Hu’s death or Ping Suoweng’s wondrous slash.

Zhan Hu, the son of Iron Whip Demon King and a top genius of Divine Black, was now dead.

Li Qiye managed to provoke both the demon king and the demon tiger clan.

The atmosphere became solemn. People knew that a storm was brewing.

The demon king became frozen after hearing the crack, seemingly struck by thunder.

He staggered backward before shouting: “No!!!”

This blow was too much to take. He didn’t have a son until later in life. Moreover, Zhan Hu was exceptional so he had high hopes for the boy. He wanted his son to surpass him and eventually rule Divine Black. Alas, his son was no more.

He still stood there in a daze, unable to calm down.

Time came to a still for both him and the audience. They knew that a beehive had been poked and peace would be gone in Divine Black.

“Master, save me!” Huang Ning was scared out of his mind since Li Qiye was coming for him. Only his master could save him now.

This diverted the attention of the spectators. Would the bodhi king stand up for his disciple?

In that case, Li Qiye would have offended two peak lords. It would be quite difficult for him in the future.

“It’s a duel to the death, a personal responsibility. I’m afraid my hands are tied.” The bodhi king standing above answered.

This naturally surprised the listeners since he didn’t choose to help his disciple.

“No...” Despair overwhelmed Huang Ning.

“I’ll see you off then.” Li Qiye said before stomping down.

“Crack!” Blood and brain matters splattered once more. Huang Ning died an indignant death, unable to scream.

“Hu’er!” A furious roar echoed across the area. The water in the lakes and rivers in Divine Black rushed to the sky due to a terrible power.

“Boom!” It ravaged the four directions in a merciless manner.

“Shit!” Many frightened disciples began to run.

The demon king has gone mad after losing his only son. “Little animal, I will cut you to pieces!” The fury in his eyes could incinerate the nine heavens and ten earths.

His current appearance was truly frightening. His impressive cultivation also intimidated the spectators.

“It was a duel to the death.” Ping Suoweng spoke again with authority and power.

“No! A life for a life! I won’t let the murderer of my son roam freely! Those who stand in my way will be my enemy, my clan’s enemy too! It won’t end like this!” The tiger king roared.

The wrath of a peak lord was too much for many disciples to take. They trembled in fear, paled.

The protectors and elders exchanged glances, realizing that Iron Whip Demon King had lost his mind. Directly opposing the sect master was extremely unwise.

Alas, he had just lost his only son. He no longer cared about anything else, only wanting to offer Li Qiye’s head to his dead son.

“Demon King, mind your position!” Suoweng’s thunderous shout hurt everyone’s eardrums.

It contained a suppressive power flying straight towards the demon king. He wanted to wake the guy up.

There was no room for personal vendetta after a fair duel to the death. The demon king was being foolish and breaking the sect’s rules.

“Boom!” A powerful demonic energy rushed out to stop the soundwave.

The demon king didn’t listen since those words didn’t enter his ears. His body grew larger.

It didn’t take long before a colossal tiger appeared on top of Divine Black. Strands of demonic energy poured down from its body like waterfalls.

Most felt suffocated by the influx of demonic energy as if they were drowning in an ocean.

“A grand avatar of the myriad-form realm.” One disciple murmured after the demon king revealed his true form.

The spectators’ mouth dried up from being nervous and afraid.

“Raa!” He unleashed a roar destroying numerous buildings. Several peaks nearby crumbled as well. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Numerous disciples started running. The cowardly ones dropped flat to the ground.

“Boom!” He performed a vertical tail swipe, nearly splitting heaven and earth. The length of this tail was unimaginable, as long as a river of stars.

“Iron Whip!” Someone shouted after seeing the tail. It was the reason for his title.
