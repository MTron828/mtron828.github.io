Chapter 4210: Come Together

The long-awaited day for many cultivators finally has arrived - the climax of the engagement mess.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“It’s about time.” Someone murmured.

They’ve been waiting for a battle between Li Qiye and Peace Ocean Sword King, thinking that it was inevitable.

Putting the engagement aside, Li Qiye had also killed many disciples from Sea Emperor at Cloud Dream including their first elder.

This was an irreconcilable feud. No sect could let this go. This was doubly true for a prestigious sect like Sea Emperor. As its king, Peace Ocean needed to kill Li Qiye in order to appease the spirits of his fallen brethren.

“The most devilish versus the most talented, what a brilliant show we have here.” One expert commented.

“And it’s a great opportunity too.” Last-gen members hoped for Li Qiye to disturb the circumstances enough for them to take advantage of the situation.

“I actually do welcome death, it’s just that it’s impossible for me to die. How frustrating.” Li Qiye said flatly.

“Don’t worry, I’ll send you on your way.” Void Saint Child interjected. He and his sect wanted to eliminate Li Qiye in order to have peace in the future.

“You alone? Far from enough.” Li Qiye smiled at Void and continued: “The both of you and all your ancestors and sword gods, come at once so I can save time.”

“Hmph!” A thunderous scowl came from beyond the blockade and scared the wits out of the crowd.

He had clearly annoyed the ancient ancestors but they refrained from attacking him.

“He wants to go against all of them alone?” An expert who knew little about Li Qiye took a deep breath.

“This is his style.” A familiar cultivator thought that it would be far stranger for Li Qiye to stop acting overbearingly.

“This courage alone is commendable, how many other youths would dare to challenge these two?” One ancestor praised.

Anyone who had traveled around knew just how talented and powerful Peace Ocean and Void were. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call them the strongest of the young generation.

Just one could sweep through the world, let alone both together. In the latter scenario, even ancestors and older kings couldn’t take them on.

Thus, a few were surprised to see Li Qiye’s bold challenge. Of course, others thought that this was normal because Li Qiye was fearless.

“Hahaha, you’re the first to speak to me in this manner!” Listeners could hear the rage in Void’s voice.

They thought that it was understandable. A supreme genius like Void couldn’t endure this humiliation.

“When the world lacks capable heroes, brats like you become renowned.” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “Let’s get this started already.”

“I want to see what you can actually do, is it going to be the moneyfall method?” Peace Ocean’s eyes surged with devouring sword rays.

Spectators felt thousands and thousands of needles piercing through completely. Some cried out in pain and immediately retreated.

“Damn, he’s strong, just like the rumors.” One of them shuddered.

Peace Ocean has yet to do anything outside of focusing his gaze yet they already found it unbearable. It seemed like the Ten Sword Prodigies working together might not be enough to take him on.

Many weren’t convinced of his power due to his age previously. Now, they must admit that he deserved his fame as the number one cultivator of the young generation.

Eyes then turned towards Li Qiye as people thought about his mighty moneyfall method. Maybe the method itself wasn’t that mighty, it’s just that he had too much money to spend; even dao lord refined jades could be thrown out.

They saw how it killed the experts of Sea Emperor before. Thus, if Li Qiye was willing to spend millions of refined jades, maybe that would be the end for these geniuses.

“Do they have a way of stopping moneyfall? What if Li Qiye spends a million or two dao lord refined jades?” One expert wondered.

“He might not need that much if it’s at the refined jade levels. That amount is enough to destroy a sect.” One ancestor shook his head.

Others might not be able to afford this sum but Li Qiye was an exception.

“He has too much money and doesn’t know how to spend it all. That’s why he isn’t afraid of anyone.” A big shot smiled wryly.

In fact, if he were willing to spend a few billion dao lord refined jades, even Sea Emperor would have a tough time dealing with it.

“Since when did money become so important?” A youth became jealous.

“No, this is a good thing. Li Qiye has a chance at changing the tides as long as he is willing to spend.” An old ancestor said.

It became increasingly harder for the crowd to exercise patience. They couldn’t wait to see the fight.

“Moneyfall?” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively: “No, it’s too boring doing the same thing every day. I’ll be trying something new this time. Hmm, a broken sword is more than enough to deal with you all.”
