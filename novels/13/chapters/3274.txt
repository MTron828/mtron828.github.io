Zhan Hu’s official complaint was only approved by Furious Tiger and Jade Bird while being dismissed by the other three. This nullified the complaint so Zhan Hu couldn’t do anything to Li Qiye.

Zhan Hu was simply trying to use Li Qiye to deal with Thunder Dragon Liu and Huang Jie, therefore inflicting some damage on Eight Zhang’s prestige.

Nothing came from this weak finish. Nonetheless, some smart disciples could still sense that something was amiss. This pertained to the ongoing competition between the humans and demons at their sect.

The demons had the upper hand for a long time now in the sect’s recent history. This lessened when Ping Suoweng took the reign.

The main character in this matter, Li Qiye, didn’t give a damn about Divine Black’s internal struggle. He didn’t come here to clean this crap up.

He simply focused on reading books and cultivation in the last few days. The library of Jade Bird had plenty of historical scrolls, some dating back to the Ancient Era of the nine worlds. He found much useful information from them.

Next, he finally reached grand Mortal Shell so he started with the second mantra - Society.

For ordinary cultivators, going from Mortal Shell to Iron Skin required opening a second palace. This palace would allow them to break through to the next realm.

There were a total of twelve realms from Mortal Shell to Golden Avatar. This meant that a Dao Lord would have twelve palaces.

At the same time, each realm would make the four symbols inside the palace one foot longer.

For example, a mortal who has never cultivated would have four symbols at nine feet long. At Mortal Shell, ten feet. At Iron Skin, they would grow again to reach eleven feet. Therefore, a Dao Lord would have symbols spanning for twenty-one feet.

Chaos true energy engulfed his fate palace. The worldly energy, grand dao power, and self-vitality were being channeled and refined into this true energy by the four symbols. It served to gestate the true fate.

As the true fate grew stronger, so would one’s techniques and abilities.

His true fate had a halo around it, made from peerless runes. This halo was a grand dao created by All-things. This served as one part of his dao foundation.

Tinier runes floated around his true fate, still scattered about like the stars in the sky. As more true energy was being added, they gradually came together in the shape of another halo.

These runes were from his second mantra - Society.

Normally, one would start on their second mantra after reaching Silver Carapace. This would allow them to cultivate a law at the black level, far stronger than the previous yellow law.

Li Qiye did something different. He started much earlier and didn’t use a higher level mantra versus All-things. Both All-things and Society were part of the seven laws.

Others would laugh at him for doing something they consider extremely foolish. Some disciples actually caught wind of this and began mocking him.

“So impatient and dumb, starting with another mantra after reaching Iron Skin, one at the same level too.” One said.

They believed that this was due to his despair and willingness to try anything at this point in order to cultivate faster.

Of course, Li Qiye didn’t hear any of this. He wouldn’t have cared anyway.

The world simply didn’t know that they could cultivate all seven laws. The limit of four wasn’t a thing.

Moreover, finishing all seven would create a firm foundation that allows them to reach higher profundity. Perhaps they didn’t understand or have forgotten about this in the present day.

Remember, Li Qiye created this epoch. He knew more about this system than anyone else.

He didn’t rush his way through and continued fortifying his dao foundation and other aspects.

At the same time, he reached a zen state allowing him to spirit walk. He saw everything in Divine Black. Not a single secret was kept from him.

His trip here wasn’t prompted by a sudden impulse. He purposely came here due to certain connections from the past.

Liu Fuyou and Huang Jie heard about his second mantra choice and became perplexed. They naturally knew more about him to not consider this idiotic.

Nonetheless, they came for a visit and saw him sitting lazily on a big chair, gazing at the mountain range.

Liu Fuyou prepared some tea for him and sat to the side. Meanwhile, Huang Jie didn’t know what to think.

Even their peak lord, the mountain king, didn’t act like a young master requiring Fuyou to wait on him.

Alas, this scene came so naturally with Li Qiye. It wouldn’t look out of place for high gods and heavenly sovereigns serving Li Qiye. [1]

Everything about Li Qiye was a mystery, especially the things that happened around him. Huang Jie had tried to move the statue that crushed Yang Si. It wasn’t that heavy and shouldn’t have been able to kill a Silver Carapace cultivator.

He speculated that when it crashed on Yang Si, it must have had a weight comparable to a mountain.

He told Fuyou who simply responded: “Don’t be surprised at anything happening around the young master.”

Fuyou was Li Qiye’s biggest believer. Li Qiye could cure a problem that even their sect master couldn’t solve. No one in Divine Black could do this. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Huang Jie stared at the ordinary-looking at Li Qiye and only saw an inscrutable question mark.

“I heard you have started training with Society, Young Master.” Fuyou poured a full cup for him before asking.

“Yes.” Li Qiye answered, still gazing at the scenery.

“May I ask why, Young Master?” Fuyou knew that the guy had his reasons.

“Why are they the Seven Laws of the Golden Age? Why not four, six, or nine?” Li Qiye finally glanced at Fuyou.

The two couldn’t answer because the seven laws have always existed. They were conventional knowledge by this point. No one ever wondered why there were seven and not any other number.

“A coincidence, perhaps, that the creator came up with seven.” Huang Jie pondered and said.

“This is not a coincidence.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Blessed Dao Lord chose to spread the seven of them. Why didn’t he lower this number?”

This indeed made sense because cultivators should only cultivate four mantras. Why didn’t the great dao lord compiled them into four mantras instead?

1. Not sure if these are cultivation realms. They can be used to describe powerful masters, pretty common terms. Going literal for now
