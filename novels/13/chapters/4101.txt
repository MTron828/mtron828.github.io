The domain assumed the form of a radiant fortress. Each ray represented the luster of a unique weapon created by the peaks - sword, saber, hammer…

This culminated into a colorful barrier to protect all of Armament Mountain. Thick dao laws then manifested and coiled around the peaks and the ground.

Furthermore, each disciple became shrouded by a layer of light. This added armor to them; each had a unique rune as well corresponding to a certain weapon type.

They felt themselves being blessed by a god. The endless power of their ancestors poured into them. Thus, their cultivation became one or two levels higher than before, akin to being added several hundred years of training.

“Till death!” They became excited and morale soared after gaining the ancestral blessings. They were ready to fight to the death against any enemy since they weren’t alone. Their ancestors were here as well in spirit.

“Armament’s grand defensive formation lives up to its fame. That’s two dao lords and numerous paragons for you.” An ancestor from another sect praised.

“Boom!” The dark maelstrom smashed against the grand formation in the next second.

Violent earthquakes ensued. Everyone felt as if the ground was being pierced through. The grand formation released a constant stream of dao lord energy, hoping to turn the tides.

Alas, the maelstrom didn’t waver. While being under pressure from the dao lord beam, it actually grew in size.

After reaching a certain size, it was large enough to swallow all of Armament Mountain now.

Cracks finally appeared on the external barriers and eventually, the entire thing crumbled into little particles.

“Rumble!” This gave a clear path for the maelstrom to crash down on Armament.

Spectators have been watching in horror because the maelstrom was unreasonably strong. The grand formation was created by Armament Dao Lord and strengthened by God Ape Dao Lord. However, it still faltered today.

Once Armament Mountain fell, the surrounding sects might become the next victims.

“What the hell is this thing?” Even the experienced ancestors gasped. They had seen many things before but this battle was different. The other party was still unknown at this point.

This amplified the danger of the situation due to a lack of information. If it was a big shot attacking, Armament Mountain would still know who they were facing and prepare accordingly.

Unfortunately, they couldn’t come up with a strategy in this case.

“Could this just be a natural disaster?” One expert regained his wits and asked.

“No, a disaster of this level doesn’t come out of nowhere. Moreover, it’s clear what it is targeting.” A big shot shook his head.

Others agreed with this. A disaster had other signs such as lightning and thunder. However, these were black clouds coming together to form a maelstrom. This didn’t look like a natural disaster.

“Wait, can this be an omen in the legends?” One disciple shuddered.

Those nearby staggered backward after hearing the word “omen”. The ones in the myth were extremely dangerous. Even dao lords have died to them before.

“Impossible.” An ancient big shot disagreed while comparing the two: “An omen isn’t like this. Most importantly, after the Myriad Dao Era, they would only appear during the ascension trial of a dao lord. The probability of one happening is minuscule as well. Armament Mountain doesn’t have an invincible character appearing, so this can’t be an omen.”

Others exchanged glances after hearing this. The big shot was right about the omens.

“Then what is this thing?” Conversations popped up everywhere.

“I heard some ominous events have been happening here, maybe it’s related?” A knowledgeable cultivator speculated.

All in all, none could come up with an acceptable answer.

“Rumble!” The grand formation couldn’t keep up with the continuous pressure from the black maelstrom and was on the verge of collapsing.

“What do we do?” The disciples of Armament were no longer as confident as before.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a radiance took over the sect with the force of a million stars exploding. The source was from the sect’s deepest location.

Two supreme figures appeared. One had weapons floating around him, looking like the ruler of worlds. The other was a massive divine ape with majestic golden fur.

“Armament and God Ape Dao Lord!” The crowd shouted.

“The ancestors will protect us!” The emotional members of Armament were moved to tears after seeing their dao lords.
