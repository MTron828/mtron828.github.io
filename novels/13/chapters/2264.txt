Everlasting Emperor was an excellent prodigy once - quite decisive and highly regarded, beloved by most.

After winning the throne, he certainly didn’t let people down. Everlasting continued to grow until it was the sun at noon.

Because of these favorable circumstances, his ambition grew, no longer content with ruling just Everlasting. His gaze spanned across the entire system, wishing to take over. Furthermore, he had the support of the entire kingdom in this effort to replace Longevity Valley.

Rumor has it that he was an Ascender at the first level. His power was worthy of his ambition.

He cupped his fist towards the guests and said: “The ceremony is much brighter with your presence, esteemed guests. Today, I represent Longevity System and Everlasting to welcome everyone.”

The Untethered and the other representatives simply greeted him back in a polite manner, not wishing to speak too much and getting involved in this power struggle.

“The ceremony is meant to worship the ancestors and the sages of past.” The emperor looked around and said slowly: “We are inferior compared to the glorious olden days, so I am here with everyone to remember the wondrous deeds and contributions of those before us. I offer this toast to everyone.” He raised a cup of wine.

“Same to you, Your Majesty.” His supporters quickly raised their cup in response. The neutral parties and the opposition did nothing in return.

“Allow me to start the ceremony.” He began walking towards the highest throne meant for Longevity Sage.

“Excuse my rudeness, Your Majesty.” A high elder shook his head and said: “You can’t sit there. The valley is still in charge of the system!”

“That’s right, the valley is still in charge!” Many cultivators repeated.

Everlasting had won many sects over. However, there were plenty more in the systems, some quite powerful. The valley had ruled for so long that people couldn’t forget about it. Furthermore, the Pill King and his sect’s support yesterday only empowered the determination of the loyalists.

The emperor’s expression turned cold after hearing the opposition. He became slightly awkward and had overestimated his kingdom’s influence.

They have already captured Longevity Valley’s disciples yet some people here still voiced their dissension.

“Longevity Sage isn’t on time so I shall take over.” His eyes became murderous towards the high elder.

“Power and authority belong to the virtuous.” A sect master on Everlasting’s side interjected: “His Majesty’s righteousness reaches the heaven, his dao spread across the eight plains. In terms of achievements, virtue, and prestige, he is eligible to handle the great responsibility of ruling. This is for the betterment of the system.”

“That’s right, let the capable be in charge. His Majesty had plenty of contributions and merits, we wholeheartedly support him to become the ruler of Longevity!” The cultivators on his side voiced their support.

“It’s not hard to become the ruler of Longevity System.” An ancestor uttered coldly: “This sovereignty belongs to the orthodox branch, the legacy sect of the progenitor, and that’s the valley alone! Anyone else is only a monkey wearing a crown!”

This powerful comment shut up the other side. The issue of legitimacy and the orthodox branch was very important. In terms of bloodline, only the valley was the real thing since it was Alchemy Immortal’s sect.

No one could touch or replace the valley on this point. This played a great part in why the valley has been in charge for so long despite the existence of more powerful sects.

Some sects were willing to support Everlasting, but they didn’t wish to talk about this issue. In order to deny the valley’s blood rights, they would need to deny their own progenitor.

By doing so, Longevity System would cease to be itself. This was beyond seizing power but akin to a changing of the system.

“Ridiculous, only disturbing the sanctity of the ceremony.” Everlasting Emperor was ready to kill.

When all else failed, he was resorting to the most direct method - force.

“Rumble!” Silver Dragon Legion appeared before the crowd like a flood of steel, capable of crushing everything before its path.

“Those who dare to disturb the ceremony and insult the reputation of Longevity System, be ready to face execution!” The emperor coldly declared.

“Clank!” The dissenters stood up and unsheathed their weapons.

The atmosphere became tense as can be; a fight could break out at any moment.

The emperor actually didn’t mind for blood to ruin the ceremony. In fact, he preferred a massacre here to deter the rest of the system. This would be the first step for him to seize power.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. Wanting to take over with such a pathetic method? You think too highly of yourself.” A leisure voice broke the silence.

Everyone immediately looked over and saw an ordinary man strolling over with two beauties behind him. Furthermore, Pill King Feng Xiaochen and his men were right behind them.

“That’s the First Disciple of Longevity System.” Someone recognized him right away.

No one called him by Li Qiye right now because his status as the First Disciple was more pertinent to the current situation.

Without the sage, he was the representative of Longevity Valley, garnering the support of the loyalists.

The Untethered and the other representatives stared straight at him, wishing to see what he could do.

“And here I thought one or two True Emperors and Eternals would come. All of this time and only a low-level Ascender is here. Just an ant pretending to be an elephant.” Li Qiye gently shook his head and sneered. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“That’s a traitor conspiring with the heretical faction, an unforgivable sin. Capture him, kill if he resists!” Everlasting Emperor ordered right away upon seeing Li Qiye.

Though this was their first meeting, Li Qiye’s position as the First Disciple alone was enough for the emperor to push him towards his death.

“Clank!” Silver Dragon Legion turned their attention towards Li Qiye, surrounding his group completely. Their spear and treasures aimed straight at him.

“Scram!” The Pill King shouted and took out a cauldron the size of a fist.

“Boom!” It spewed out a flame that took the form of a gigantic cauldron.

It started flying around and crushed the surrounding troops, causing their bones to break and blood to gush. One expert got blown flying after another.

The Pill King wasn’t only good at alchemy. His fighting ability was impressive enough since he was also an Ascender.
