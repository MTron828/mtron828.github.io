Chapter 4753: The Real Battle Begins

The arrival of Enveloping Monarch caused quite a stir. If he was here, there was a chance that his sworn brother, Dao Sanqian, could arrive later.

Most became emotional while thinking about this eternal being that was on par with the dao lords.

“Looks like Dao Sanqian is likely to come.” An old demon murmured.

“Right.” A prince with close ties to Three Thousand Dao said: “It is only a matter of time since this is more than just protecting Shen Juntian. Li Qiye with that gemstone is too much of a threat. Once he becomes a dao lord, he’ll be one of the greatest in history or perhaps the greatest of them all, surpassing even Blessed, Swordsea, and Puresun Dao Lord.”

He paused for a moment and then continued: “When that happens, the true apex existences will have to submit to him or face death.”

The ancient ancestors nearby exchanged glances and agreed with this logic. Hidden supreme masters were the true lords of this world.

For example, though Dao Sanqian was not a dao lord, he had still trained several. His status in Eight Desolaces was paramount and new dao lords treated him with the deserved respect.

However, Li Qiye’s circumstances could make him truly invincible. Characters such as Dao Sanqian needed to yield lest risking destruction.

Would they want to see the rise of such a dao lord?

“You’re right, Dao Sanqian will make a move. He won’t let Li Qiye ascend.” An ancient ancestor whispered.

They then turned their attention back to the battlefield.

“Will Enveloping Monarch change the tides?” One big shot asked the group.

Previously, they would place all of their bets on Enveloping Monarch due to his power. Now, they had just seen Li Qiye suppress the entire alliance. Enveloping Monarch might no longer be enough.

His steps still quaked the world as if he was incalculably heavy. He readied his spear as well - one having a fiery cosmo flowing around the tip. It naturally contained the power of this cosmo; its rays illuminated the battlefield.

It shared the same name and prestige as its master - Enveloping.

He came from Bones and once used the Golden Cycle of Death. However, he gave it back to Bones after joining Three Thousand Dao as a token of respect.

Losing his main weapon didn’t weaken him. He then took up the spear and still dominated Desolaces.

He became a different person and one with the spear while grasping it. Three thousand worlds couldn’t stop a single thrust. All of his wills shall be done through sheer domination.

All eyes were on him as he became the center of the universe. Suddenly, he started becoming illusory and only the spear was left.

“Enveloping Spear…” Ancient ancestors and regular cultivators took a deep breath.

As far as they knew, no one in history has been able to defeat Enveloping and his favorite weapon. However, Li Qiye was still considered the favorite in this fight.

After all, the entire alliance was still being suppressed by him, on the verge of death. Enveloping Monarch couldn’t do the same thing to the alliance. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Boom!” A six-dao cycle was activated in the air. Each rotation contained an era.

Everyone felt as if they were pulled into this unending cycle. They nearly forgot that Six-dao Monarch has still been looming above so this explosion reminded them of his presence.

As the first disciple of All-things Dao Lord, he had earned the respect of all cultivators. He was here early but didn’t make a move.

Thus, the crowd assumed that he wouldn’t get involved due to his status. Now, this no longer seemed to be the case.

“Six-dao Monarch and Enveloping Monarch, maybe Li Qiye will actually lose.” A king from a wild plain shuddered in fear.

Enveloping alone might not be enough but Six-dao as well? The latter was someone comparable to Dao Sanqian.

“Boom!” As the two appeared eager to join the fight, a small figure suddenly landed in front of them.
