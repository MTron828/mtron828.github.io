Chapter 4970: Twilight Hunter

“Little girl, you might not like what will happen next, it might even affect you. I still need you to face it though.”

She stared at him for a bit before nodding: “I already mentally prepared for this. I knew you wouldn’t come to visit for no reason.”

“You make it sound like I’m an unlucky star.” He smiled wryly.

“Pretty much. A crow is not an auspicious beast. Wherever one appears, only bad things happen.” She burst into a fit of giggles - a melody so delightful, it echoed through the starry night and drifted far, far away.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He smiled and looked up at the stars. They seemed to be laughing with her as well.

“I want to ask about someone.” After a while, he finally got to the point.

Her smile disappeared after this. The stars also dimmed down.

“I have a pretty good idea.” Her expression became serious.

“Not a stranger to you.” He said.

Her eyes flashed with rage, pain, sorrow, and many other emotions…

“You want to ask about my killer.” She sighed.

“Yes, I have only heard of this person but never saw him or caught any real clues. I’m sure you have a better idea.” He nodded.

She sighed again while thinking about the past. Eventually, she shuddered while uttering the name: “Twilight Hunter.” [1]

He grabbed her hand and intertwined their fingers. She clenched her fingers tightly and was still scared of the past. Although it has been so long, it still felt like yesterday.

Everything crumbled in the blink of an eye. The thing that frightened her was not death but rather, an attempt to destroy her everything.

She was subjected to a fate of darkness - an eternal seal. Alas, the thing that hurt her the most was losing her trust.

She was once a carefree goddess living with her father, not worrying about anything while possessing countless dreams. The world was beautiful and opened many doors for her.

Alas, the strike killed her and her heart, hope, and dreams. She could endure the eternal torment but recalling that moment was difficult, hence her shaking fingers.

Tears streamed down her cheeks despite her current cultivation.

“I am here for him, I know he is still around.” He wiped her tears and said.

“Are you sure?” She asked.

“You tell me. Aren’t you here, all alone, because of him?” He stared straight at her eyes.

“Right, I don’t think he can die that easily.” She nodded her head and agreed.

“I have searched countless scrolls and paintings that can trace back to past epochs.” He said: “My intuition tells me that he is around. I am the lord of this epoch and I can sense all three thousand worlds. I was unsure before but now, I know that he is still alive.”

“Then that’s correct, he is alive. Yes, he can’t die that easily.” She agreed: “If you know, he also knows and is hiding, that’s his style.”

“Hence my visit. We both know that you are in this dimension to not be found.” Li Qiye said.

“No one will think that I’m alive, including him. They all believed that the epoch was fully buried.” She was sure of this.

“Your father saved you.” Li Qiye sighed.

“Yes… Even as the sky was falling down and he was preoccupied with keeping everything intact, he still made sure that I would have a chance to live. That’s why only reason I’m still here.” She became emotional.

That last moment was horrifying. All the worlds were being destroyed. She witnessed her father meeting his end. All living beings were obliterated subsequently.

Li Qiye held her hands tighter.

“My trust killed everyone.” She was heartbroken.

“It was not your fault.” He said: “You are the sun, the culmination of all that is good and beautiful. You were born under the bright sun and should get to enjoy its warm rays. Even if it wasn’t for you, he would have picked someone else to start the hunt. He was responsible, not you.”

“My father had created an ultimate defense so I thought that everything would be fine.” She lamented.

“It wasn’t your fault. The same result would have happened eventually, just a different process. He slumbered in the darkness and planned for a long hunt.” he said.

She calmed down and wiped the tears from her eyes: “I will tell you everything you want to know.”

“I suspect that he has appeared recently, maybe not right now but at least after Trinity. He must have done something.” He said.

“I’m not quite sure but if you are right, I’m certain that there was one death caused by him.” She pondered for a bit and said.

“Supreme Primogenitor.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s the one.” She said: “It has to be something tempting enough to make him lose patience and appear. Very few things are worthy of his attention even when we’re talking about epochs.”

“In this case, a bloodline.” He said: “I know that this Supreme Primogenitor had inherited a matchless bloodline - Dao Origin. This is tempting enough.” [2]

1. This name might change since I’m not sure if it’s a title or a name. It should be a title since this name is clearly evil or dark ☜

2. I’m keeping an eye out on whether this Supreme Primogenitor and the bloodline are something we have seen before. I did a search but didn’t come up with anything. ☜
