Chapter 3776: Strange Monk

The chariot stopped and Righteous Scion deboarded, slowly walking up the cliff.

At the start, some were surprised to see him making a stop in this place. It didn’t take long before a keen eye realized it and shouted loudly: “Look, beneath that tree! Golden Cicada Buddhist Child!”

Others followed this call and sure enough, Golden Cicada was chomping down roasted meat beneath the tree. They just didn’t notice him since their attention was on the scion prior.

“Looks like he wishes to challenge Righteous Scion.” An older expert remarked.

Many nodded in agreement. On the first day of the challenge, Dugu Lan accepted; Hu Ben and Phantom then showed their support.

Only Golden Cicada didn’t show his stance, not even his shadow could be seen. This made most think that he wasn’t going to participate in this challenge. After all, some monks didn’t worry about external affairs.

This particular encounter was far more low-key compared to the one back at Smoke-fire Fortress. Hu Ben’s appearance had plenty of fanfare.

On the other hand, Golden Cicada didn’t say a word and only showed up along the path. He knew how to keep it low-key.

“Impressive, worthy of being the Monk of Wisdom’s disciple.” People began praising him for rising up to the challenge.

“The four geniuses are not letting us down.” One genius said.

The scion was clearly unbeatable yet Golden Cicada still chose to fight alone. This alone was worthy of the utmost admiration.

Hu Ben relied on the fortress and a legion to fight him previously. This made the monk seem superior in terms of determination and courage.

“Wait, maybe Golden Cicada Buddhist Child is far stronger than Hu Ben?” One expert wondered.

Among the four, Golden Cicada was the youngest and the last to make his dao debut. Moreover, he saw what happened to Hu Ben earlier yet he still wanted to fight one-on-one against the scion? One must assume that he was stronger than Hu Ben.

As the scion climbed the cliff, each step was an entire world. The dao of nature followed each of his movements as he became the lord of this region as well.

On the other hand, Golden Cicada continued eating without being affected. Nothing in the world was more interesting than the piece of roasted meat in his hands right now.

This was a bizarre scene - a supreme lord moving up the cliff while his opponent relaxed beneath a tree.

Everyone watched with bated breath; some became awfully tense and clenched their fists tightly. They were worried for the young monk.

The monk didn’t seem to notice the scion and continued immersing in his meal. As for the scion, he waited patiently without bothering his potential opponent.

The scene went from bizarre to interesting. Time came to a halt - the whole scene became a painting.

A meat-eating monk and the greatest genius of the south - there was something romantic about this meeting. The two have yet to fight yet people already felt that this would go down in history.

Golden Cicada finished his meal in a jiffy, leaving only the bones behind. Alas, he seemed unsatisfied and continued licking his ten fingers clean.

Some shook their head; others had a wry smile. Those who didn’t know him would consider this to be a disgrace for the Monk of Wisdom and Heavenly Dragon Temple.

On the other hand, those who knew him beforehand thought that this was expected. They knew the type of person he was.

“Sorry for the wait, Benefactor.” Golden Cicada placed his palms together and smiled.

“It’s fine to wait in this wonderful weather.” The scion seemed to be in good spirits.

“Hmm, how mighty you are.” Golden Cicada stared at the scion with his pure eyes and concluded.

“Your Buddhist art is peerless as well.” The scion complimented.

The spectators exchanged glances after hearing the cordial conversation. They felt that a battle between these would be magnificent and flawless.

“The holy ground hasn’t been entertaining you during your eastward journey. A monk normally abstains from these matters but today, I have no choice but to bother you.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Don’t worry, one of my biggest wishes this time is to see World Crossing. It is an honor to fight you, Buddhist Child.” The scion laughed heartily.

“I have only learned ten percent or so at best.” Golden Cicada smiled.

This confirmed to the crowd that he had started learning it.

World Crossing was Dhyana Dao Lord’s derivation of Buddhamization. Both Buddhamization and Evil Devourer were merit laws belonging to the Supreme Four Truths.

Thus, this became a competition between two great merit laws of the famous scripture.

“I’ve barely scratched the surface as well.” The scion earnestly said.

Normally, he acted with pride and arrogance. This humble response was a striking contrast to his usual demeanor.

Of course, he wasn’t trying to be humble towards the monk. This was only to show respect to the Supreme Four Truths - a series of invincible arts in history.

“That’s good, ten percent versus barely scratching the surface, a perfect match. Nonetheless, I have favorable conditions today, please excuse me for that.” [1]

“The holy ground is blessed with boundless Buddhist affinity, I will not miss the chance to see it in action. Let’s get started.” The scion chuckled. Today, he no longer dared to be careless against his foe.

“Raa!” Having said that, a golden dragon materialized and coiled around him.

“Heaven Devourer Dragon Guard!” People recognized this merit law right away.

The scion has already put on a defensive line before the start of the battle. This truly surprised the spectators.

“He’s taking this fight very seriously.” One spectator said.

Remember, it took the scion a long time before needing to activate it even against Smoke-fire Fortress and Vigorous Tiger Legion.

“So Golden Cicada Buddhist Child is far stronger than Hu Ben?” One genius found this hard to believe.

“No way, Golden Cicada Buddhist Child is the youngest and the last to cultivate. He could be stronger but definitely not by a large margin.” Another expert felt the same astonishment.

“Remember, this is Buddhist Holy Ground.” An ancestor explained: “Heavenly Dragon Temple is the orthodox branch, that’s why they have World Crossing.”

Numerous powers and dynasties have taken charge of the holy ground in the past. Alas, none ever had access to this art. Sacred Mountain only gave it to Heavenly Dragon Temple.

1. By favorable conditions, he means he has the home-court advantage. Home court just didn’t fit in this line but that’s the essential meaning
