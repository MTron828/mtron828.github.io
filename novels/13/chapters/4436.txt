Chapter 4437: Pertaining The Legend

“Jiu Bian’s relationship with our Tiger Pond… Hmm…” Ancient Lion murmured.

The mysterious Jiu Bian has been shrouded by fog. Some believed that Jiu Bian was actually nine separate people, or a being that has lived for nine eras. It could also be a lineage instead of a person…

All in all, no one knew much about Jiu Bian, only that this being was strong enough to deter dao lords and fight evenly against Feng Qi.

The pond already existed before the foundation of Dragon. It was a place where demons gathered. Most believed that these demons were related to Jiu Bian, many of whom thought they were Jiu Bian’s descendants.

This might be a bit unreasonable but the mighty demons thought that if they could reach atavism, they would be able to obtain Jiu Bian’s bloodline. For example, the Jian’s bloodline could evolve into a phoenix bloodline.

“Was Jiu Bian from here?” Ancient Treant asked.

“That’s unclear, but I’m certain that Feng Qi was an outsider.” Nine-tailed God said.

Despite the vagueness of the records, Dragon’s three branches believed that for a long period of time, Jiu Bian was in charge of this area, especially Tiger Pond. Feng Qi was the outsider who came to challenge Jiu Bian.

There were speculations of them having existing feuds as well, that this battle was arranged long ago. Either way, the two didn’t hold back.

“The two must have been competing for something.” Ancient Pheasant said.

This has been a long-running question in Dragon. Their ancestors never ceased researching this issue.

One legend stated that Space Dragon Emperor picked this area due to a secret hidden here. He then chose to protect it and create Dragon.

Alas, the ancestors of Dragon and even external dao lords have searched only to fail. Eventually, the ancestors believed that it has to be the Demon Realm Palace. Only that place was elusive to them.

“It could have something to do with immortality.” Nine-tailed God brought this up.

The three ancient demons exchanged glances. Immortality was unreachable for cultivators. However, the mighty existences all yearned for it.

“What makes you say this?” Ancient Pheasant asked.

“Because outside of immortality, there aren’t many things worthy of taking up dao lords’ time.” Nine-tailed God said: “Our own dao lords had resided in City of Demons. Many other dao lords came later too.”

He paused for a bit and continued: “From the historical records, there has to be something here to tempt all the dao lords. Not in our capital or a different region, it’s in City of Demons.”

“Don’t you think it’s the palace?” Ancient Treant said.

“No.” Nine-tailed God shook his head: “The palace is indeed a peerless treasure for us, inscrutable as well, but given the dao lords’ power, they should have been able to take it away if it was their actual goal.”

The others couldn’t refute this logic. Dragon was certainly strong but they wouldn’t be able to stop the dao lords.

There were tales of dao lords coming and praising the palace repeatedly. Alas, none took it away.

Moreover, this made them think about something else. Their sect has been growing more and more, possessing numerous ancestors and geniuses.

This was especially true during Peacock’s reign. The sect started having the ambition of competing with Lion’s Roar.

Alas, Nine-tailed God made them realize how futile it was. It was as if he stuck a needle into a balloon.

All of their current developments didn’t mean much because a dao lord could still destroy them without qualms.

Was this the case for Lion’s Roar? The answer was no. In history, dao lords always hesitated on doing anything detrimental to Lion’s Roar.

This might be the biggest difference between Dragon and Lion’s Roar. The latter has been quiet recently and gave off the impression of declination. Nonetheless, no one still dared to do anything against them. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Nine-tailed God was more insightful and woke them up from their dream. Ancient Lion and Ancient Pheasant stared at Ancient Treant, the latter being the strongest supporter of Peacock Monarch.

“I, I never thought about it.” He awkwardly responded.
