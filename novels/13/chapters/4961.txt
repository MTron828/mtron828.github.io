Chapter 4962: So What If I Kill Them?

Four dragon lords have shown up; their mere presence immobilized all students on the divine mountain.

Furthermore, they represented Deity and Reincarnation while on the other side was Li Qiye, all alone.

“Release them now, this is not a negotiation.” Stone Lion God roared furiously, causing everyone to tremble in fear. No ants could resist the might of a god.

Could Li Qiye handle all four at the same time even with the help of the dao controller?

“Unfortunately, I prefer flowery words over hard fists. Looks like I will have to kill them then, and all of you as well. No one is leaving this place today.” Li Qiye smiled.

Students took a deep breath; some thought that they have misheard him.

Even the most talented genius wouldn’t dare to fight a dragon lord, let alone four of them together. Thus, he appeared arrogant to the point of being ignorant.

The four dragon lords couldn’t believe what they were hearing. Stone Lion God and Oblivion Monarch, in particular, were ready to kill.

They have dominated for a long time and were used to being respected and feared, not to mention their fierce and ruthless nature.

“Don’t blame us for being merciless.” Oblivion Monarch said menacingly.

In fact, they somewhat preferred this development. Li Qiye’s arrogance could be used as an excuse to be punished. They would be able to kill him and seize his treasure; Benevolence was no longer the goal.

“Save me!” The young monarch found his dao foundation to be cracking so he cried for help. The other two have already fainted.

“You do not wish to know what is in store for you if you hurt them.” Stone Lion God shouted.

“Is that so, come then.” Li Qiye smirked and increased the intensity of the dao laws.

“Ahh!” The young monarch screamed in pain; the other two also woke up due to the unbearable agony.

“Crack!” Their dao foundation was being crushed.

“Ancestor, save me!” The young monarch became afraid during these last moments. Losing the dao foundation meant being crippled if they were fortunate enough to survive.

“Enough!” The Stone Lion God let out a deafening roar, and his claw was enveloped in a dazzling golden aura. It was larger than the tallest of mountains and sharpest than the mightiest blade.

"Boom!" The massive claw descended with destructive force, tearing the very fabric of the sky in two as it slammed down upon Li Qiye.

Spatial storms raged in the aftermath of the destruction, but Li Qiye remained calm and relied on the power of the dao controller, which sent out another minuscule law to confront the massive claw.

The two forces collided with a thunderous explosion, and a black hole formed in the center of the destruction.

Li Qiye was perfectly fine while Stone Lion God seemed to be struck by lightning. He faltered backward and felt his vitality churning until he vomited blood. He looked down and saw that his claw has been pulverized by the law.

The students watched in disbelief as their eyes bulged out of their sockets, strained to their limits by the sheer spectacle before them.

“Ahh!” Meanwhile, the laws unleashed by the dao controller reduced the three geniuses to nothing more than bloody mists, which dissipated into the wind without a trace.

The four dragon lords’ auras intensified and froze the atmosphere. Students felt a chill biting down to their bones.

They tried to save the juniors but couldn’t. Li Qiye gave them no face and executed the trio in public - a true slap to the face. The only way to salvage their reputation and honor was to kill Li Qiye.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Bastard!” Oblivion Monarch’s words were like knife stabs to the heart.

“I will flay you to rid myself of this unquenchable anger!” Stone Lion God bellowed with murderous rage.

He made students at the sovereign level feel like ants, let alone the weaker ones.

“Accept your fate and surrender now for a swift death.” Reincarnation City Lord said.

“Boom!” A fiery figure appeared in the air and interrupted their battle.
