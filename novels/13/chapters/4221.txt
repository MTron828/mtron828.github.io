Chapter 4222: Lu Qi’s Identity

Most believed that Ancestor Jialun was only second to Vastsea Paragon. Thus, only a few in the continent could actually take him on.

This mysterious lady captivated the crowd and piqued their interest. Of course, she was none other than Lu Qi.

Since they didn’t recognize her, they immediately thought that she was overestimating herself and didn’t have the qualification to challenge Ancestor Jialun.

“Who is she? Is she actually strong enough to fight the ancient ancestor?” One expert said while staring at Lu Qi.

“I think she’s Li Qiye’s maid, she’s been with him from the start. Her background is a puzzle.” An old cultivator responded.

“Li Qiye has quite a few masters with him.” A high elder mused.

“Sure, he managed to recruit some famous people with his money, but is that enough to challenge Sword God Jialun?” A peer found this unwise.

Everyone questioned Lu Qi’s ability because her foe stood at the apex. They had no idea of her actual power and thought that she was being arrogant.

However, Jialun himself didn’t think so. His eyes shot out rays of light with the intensity of the sun. They illuminated the world and chased away the fog, allowing him to see the truth.

“Ah, Miss Lu Qi.” Jialun, unlike the others, was able to discern her identity: “You were only a sovereign when I visited Everlasting Sword God back then. Now, you’ve caught up to us old men.”

He didn’t dare to underestimate his opponent despite being the leader of the six.

This astounded the crowd. So this unknown lady turned out to be from Everlasting Sword God’s camp.

“I see, that’s why she’s so audacious.” Someone regained her wits and said.

No one thought that she was overstepping her bound any longer. Her background alone said enough about her power.

“It’s her.” One aged ancestor knew who she was after Jialun brought it up.

Ning Zhu and Xu Yiyun were surprised as well. They knew that Lu Qi was extremely strong but not her background.

A’zhi and Tie Jian appeared normal, having known this before. There was another person remaining calm - Terra Sword Saint.

“Why is someone from Everlasting Sword God’s camp serving Li Qiye?” One cultivator asked: “Don’t tell me he paid enough to recruit her too.”

The questioner felt that money alone shouldn’t have been enough to hire someone of her status.

“If it is not money, then what? Why would she act as his maid? It doesn’t make any sense.” An ancestor replied.

Other cultivators felt the same way. Just who the hell is Li Qiye?

A young master with money? No, this was no longer appropriate to describe Li Qiye.

“I know, he has to be the direct disciple of Everlasting Sword God.” Someone boldly speculated.

Many felt a light flashing in their mind. They agreed with him right away: “That would explain many things.”

All in all, various groups talked about his identity in just a short time.

“Ugh…” Void finally got up but couldn’t speak clearly due to the hole in his throat.

“He’s still alive? That’s a supreme genius for you.” Others were surprised to see Void relatively well after suffering a direct blow.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It’s about time to end this battle. My turn.” Li Qiye smilingly said while Lu Qi kept Jialun at bay.

Peace Ocean and Void panicked after hearing this. They wished time would stop while the crowd was eager to see more.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye simply raised his sword to begin a sequence.

“Splash!” Everyone heard the sounds of waves as if a torrential ocean was behind him. The waves were made of sword energies - violent and bestial like primordial beasts, ready to devour everything.

Just the initial stance alone affected all other sword dao. He became the ruler of the swords while holding Vastsea.

Any slash would contain the power of countless sword dao - a force to be reckoned with.

“Activate!” Peace Ocean also created a domain of swords. His belonged to the void affinity - an abyss containing numerous sword dao. This abyss could devour three thousand worlds and everything thrown at it. On the other side, he also created an ocean of swords.

“Two sword dao at the same time! Vastsea and Abyss!” Spectators shouted.

In this perilous moment, he decided to show his ace card - using both heavenly dao at the same time.

His vitality pouring into the dao appeared to be gilded, exuding a golden radiance. He was clearly desperate enough to use his true fate and longevity blood. This was the only way for him to keep up both dao at the same time.

Though he was supremely talented, controlling both heavenly dao at the same time required an absurd level of power and energy. Otherwise, they could collapse and annihilate their own user.

The crowd thought that he was living up to his fame as the number one genius of the young generation. The outcome of this fight wouldn’t change this.

“Rumble!” As for Void, he shifted space and the yin and yang. His Light of the Worlds became resplendent again, separating him and Li Qiye. Myriad words stood between them; even the fastest speed and greatest power could no longer get through.

At the same time, the rays of the treasures came together to form a cocoon.
