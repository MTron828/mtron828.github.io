Chapter 5756: Let’s Go Meet This Person

Li Qiye’s rays fused with this world’s space and time, encompassing every inch of existence and granting him full control.

He could dictate the flow of time, serving as the ruler of the past, present, and future. He could change the fate of someone - turning someone into a baron or making a poor soul die an early death, even preventing a human from dying...

The rays went backward in time and images appeared before him. He carefully observed the events of this world and every lifeform.

This wasn’t time traveling - just an attempt to see everything. Due to the length of history, he had to accelerate the time-tracing process.

Unfortunately, he didn’t notice anything as he observed the mortals - people growing older and dying. Some had descendants and others became the last of their line...

This was just a world of mortals, nothing more.

“No reincarnation cycle.” Lives passed by before his eyes with the speed of light. Each pulse represented a lifeform - flashing into appearance and otherwise.

Billions and billions have lived so it was a constant stream of pulsing lights - from birth until death.

“Interesting.” His findings proved that this was an ordinary world. However, an ordinary one couldn’t be in this place.

He reversed time again, paying more attention to the pulsing lights. Staying patient was difficult since there was nothing to see - only the mortal coil.

Nonetheless, he remained meticulous, observing each life despite their ephemeral nature.

Eventually, he noticed something peculiar - a pulsing light always starting from the same point. If he didn’t pay special attention, this would have just been another lifeform.

However, he noted that the length and appearance were the same each time - a mortal was born and died at eighty years of age. This repeated enough to be the only constant in the random world.

He then changed the flow of time back to the present to see the current position of this pulse.

“Let’s go meet this person.” Li Qiye smiled and told the duo.

He teleported and the two kept up with him. Their destination was a well-loved courtyard where each flower was carefully tended to. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was meticulously maintained - from the layout to the cultivation process. They saw a girl watering a flowerbed, occasionally bending down to trim the flowers and loosen the soil.

She wore an indigo-green dress, looking ethereal like the mist. She was not particularly beautiful but had a modest and delicate appearance. With light makeup, she resembled a flower blossoming in the morning.

Upon closer inspection, her complexion seemed a bit pale as if she was ill. Nevertheless, her gentle smile could melt hearts and chase illness away.

“Grow well, you are very strong.” She gently patted a small plant with a smile.

“You are strong too.” Li Qiye remarked.

“You are you?!” She stepped back and blurted out from being startled.

However, she saw that it was just an ordinary youth with no hint of malice. She heaved a sigh of relief and noticed the cloud and star instead.

“I’m just passing by.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see, you scared me there.” Ling’er bowed slightly to Li Qiye while curiously staring at the two entities.

They were also interested in her, circling several times as if examining her from top to bottom.

“Is this real?” She couldn’t help wanting to touch the cloud and the star.

They didn’t refuse her advance due to their curiosity.

“A star and a cloud?” She asked innocently.
