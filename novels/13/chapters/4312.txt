Chapter 4313: Myriad Sect Mountain

“Well, I’m full now, time to go.” Li Qiye smiled and placed a coin on the table before heading for the door.

His fellow members gave chase right away, thinking that this departure was rather sudden.

“Visit more often!” The aunt remained enthusiastic and came to the door to wave. This looked rather strange, similar to a madam bidding the guests goodbye at a brothel.

The young ones thought that this was the strangest meal in their life. They weren’t aware of the intricacies.

Some were confused, some benefited, while one person needed to deliberate further… Nonetheless, the wonton bowls had decided many things, even the fate of certain sects.

Along the way, they saw the old man again. He cupped his fist towards Li Qiye and didn’t say anything else.

This old street was still filled with pedestrians. It looked rather common and could be seen in many cities during this prosperous era.

Alas, it was buried with numerous unreachable secrets. They were shocking legends; some could eradicate a sect if spread.

Li Qiye ignored them and continued moving forward. Wang Weiqiao paid more attention than he did. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The street was filled with the aura and atmosphere commonly seen in the mortal world. Nonetheless, he thought that it was special somehow. He eventually stopped looking and caught up after being left behind.

Li Qiye and his group strolled aimlessly around the city with no destination in mind. This was the young ones’ first time visiting a big city. They were filled with curiosity and looked everywhere.

It didn’t let them down. They saw treasures and manual scrolls for sale everywhere. Some were extremely valuable and expensive.

They couldn’t purchase anything but at least they broadened their horizon. In a sense, one could find whatever they wanted here. The only limiting factor was money.

They eventually gained more insight into the resources and power of the top sects in the world. This made the gap rather obvious. Their Little Diamond was only a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things.

After a while, Elder Hu suggested: “We need to go register at Myriad Sect Mountain or we won’t have a spot.”

In the past, they came rather early to the conference. After all, there were too many tiny sects in Southern Desolace. Being late might result in not having a spot at all. They weren’t important enough to have a reserved location.

This wasn’t Elder Hu’s first time so he led the way. Myriad Sect Mountain was a mountain range filled with buildings.

The Supreme Monarch held the first conference in this place and it became the permanent spot subsequently.

The great powers had built buildings and palaces on top of the peaks. This made each trip rather convenient since they would already have a place to stay.

The mountain range resided to the north of the city. When standing from a distance, spectators could see how magnificent it was. Each peak towered all the way to the sky.

However, the largest ones were notably broken. Something from above had descended and crushed them. There were still chaotic maelstroms in the air. They have lasted for eras now and fortunately, were weakened. Nonetheless, dust still drifted in the air.

Those with better vision could also see lightning flashing by the main peaks. This must have been caused by the great calamity.

The conference has also lost its splendor. There were thousands and thousands of buildings here once. Alas, many have been abandoned and were reduced into ruins.

When the group arrived, they still saw many cultivators from all races gathering by the base. They mainly consisted of weaker sects; the big shots were far and few in between.

The Myriad Sect Conference was no longer as influential as before. Even the host, Lion’s Roar, didn’t send important characters here.

Only the weaker sects took it seriously. This was their best opportunity to potentially interact with the great powers. Leaving the big shots aside, just meeting the disciples from Lion’s Roar or Dragon Sect was enough. These relationships could improve their status and future.

The young ones from Little Diamond were in awe to see the mighty peaks, especially the broken ones deeper inside.

“So this is Myriad Sect Mountain.” One of them gulped.

“What happened over there? Why are those peaks broken?” Another was in awe.

Due to the height of those peaks, they were visible even from afar.

“Legend has it that this is the devastation from the sky falling down.” Elder Hu still became emotional every time he saw this sight.

“The sky falling down?” One disciple asked.
