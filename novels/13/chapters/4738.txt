Chapter 4739: One Palm Strike

Tian Feng eventually reached an enormous size. If the sky and the earth had handles, he would be able to lift and reverse them as he pleases.

With the help of his allies, he was able to garner more power from the madstone, potentially reaching its limit.

He has yet to activate his power but it was impossible to contain akin to a flood destroying a dam. The crowd knew that if they were close enough to him, they would be reduced to pieces.

He seemed to be made out of a blood diamond - tough and heavy, seemingly invulnerable to all weapons and attacks.

“Boom!” He began channeling his power.

The world shook violently and even the most accomplished cultivator had a hard time stabilizing.

“Go!” He shouted.

This single word slammed listeners in the chest and discomforted them.

“Boom!” They then saw a magnificent scene. The devastating energy palm of Li Qiye was actually being pushed upward by Tian Feng, one meter at a time. The contest obliterated the spatial fabrics nearby.

“Up!” Tian Feng roared and still grew in size, managing to press back against Li Qiye with unstoppable momentum.

“Up!” The roar didn’t stop, and neither did his advances to the crowd’s astonishment. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Though they knew that it wasn’t his power alone, he was the only one capable of serving as the vessel for these cultivators. Just one mistake would end with implosion.

“That body can crush the heaven.” An ancient demon monarch became emotional.

Tian Feng’s colossal frame could crush a kingdom with a single smash. It wouldn’t be hard for him to massacre an entire region. This was enough to deter some ancient ancestors and undying monsters.

“Finally, someone who can stop Li Qiye.” A big shot murmured.

“Perhaps this is the extent of Li Qiye’s power.” An ancestor from a sacred ground speculated.

They saw that Tian Feng has finally seized the upper hand after being pushed back for so long.

“Maybe so, it’s absolutely horrifying.” A great lord took a deep breath.

The three heirs alone should be an unbeatable team. This time, it included dozens of Heavenly Sovereigns as well.

This showed that Li Qiye’s true power far exceeded his peers. Few in the world could actually touch him.

“I believe Tian Feng has a chance.” Someone else became excited.

If this was still not enough to beat Li Qiye, it would be hopeless for everyone else.

“Not bad.” Li Qiye smiled: “Very well, watch carefully then.”

“Buzz.” He raised his hand and it became bright. Next, every inch of existence resonated with him and emitted light.

The rays carried a primordial affinity, seemingly existing at the start of time. They contained various powers such as the energy of the earth, the heaven, other essences…

Eventually, the rays of the world turned into a boundless sphere in his hand. As the sphere rotated, the suppressive power surged out. Just one particle of light from this sphere could reduce anyone to ashes.

This incalculable power and the rays emanating from it destroyed everything along the way.

“Boom!” Tian Feng immediately dropped to the ground.

“Crack!” Next, his seemingly-invulnerable body boosted by the madstone had cracks everywhere.

Ah!” Tian Feng bellowed in pain.

The young emperor, Five-sun King, and their allies were sent flying. Some vomited blood, others couldn’t handle the injuries and died on the spot.

Tian Feng’s gigantic frame was pushed to the ground by an inviolable power and was still being crushed.

The big shots shuddered after seeing this. They thought that Tian Feng was invulnerable only to be proven wrong.

“He’s untouchable.” Someone said. Just one finger of Li Qiye could take her down.

“He’s the next dao lord for sure.” The ancient existences realized that no one else was qualified to compete against him.

Meanwhile, the losing side was still screaming in agony while laying in a pool of their own blood.

“Enough of this, Junior!” A net suddenly descended with a corrosive force. Even space itself was being devoured.
