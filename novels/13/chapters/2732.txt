It has been half a year since Li Qiye’s arrival. The entire sect has improved by leaps and bounds. For a few people, this period was equivalent to a ten-year-long session in the past, perhaps even longer.

The upper echelon already had accumulation and experiences built up. They were stuck because of certain bottlenecks binding them down.

Alas, with Li Qiye’s help and the dao power coming from Mountguard, they were able to reach the next level.

The atmosphere and morale in Mountguard were at an all-time high. People couldn’t eat and sleep, albeit for a good cause - cultivating.

Today, School Master Chen Weizheng ran in and reported: “Ancestor, a patrolling envoy from Eight Trigrams, Sir Fu is here.”

Li Qiye was in a state of dormancy as always, seemingly not listening.

“Sir Fu is here for the matter relating to the Virtuous Crown. I believe Eight Trigrams will not let us have a sage so they want to take the crown. Please make your decision, Ancestor.” Weizheng was used to this and continued reporting.

In the past, establishing the next sage was Mountguard’s business. Other great powers in Immortal Demon System weren’t qualified to get involved.

Alas, this was no longer the case. Mountguard has fallen while the sage was responsible for greeting the next reincarnated form of Everlasting Forefather. Thus, this status and role were pivotal and highly regarded in the system.

It represented the orthodox branch in Immortal Demon. However, as one of the strongest lineages in the system right now, Eight Trigrams didn’t have this role and the status of a main branch.

Thus, the return of the crown tempted them. It wasn’t hard for them to take it from the current Mountguard either, hence the visit from this envoy.

“It’s no big deal, let him come since he’s here already.” Li Qiye spoke without opening his eyes.

“Ancestor, this envoy... is a third-level Ascender.” Weizheng rubbed his palms together awkwardly.

Remember, he was still the strongest in Mountguard as a True God. He wouldn’t be able to stop this envoy from forcefully taking the crown. No one else in the sect could either.

That’s why he had no choice but to report this to Li Qiye since it was a big event.

“Push me out.” Li Qiye told Jiahui.

Weizheng became ecstatic. Li Qiye’s involvement meant that they would be able to keep the crown.

The conference hall of Mountguard was normally meant for high-level deliberations within the sect.

Today, it was taken by a guest from Eight Trigrams, an envoy whose responsibility was to patrol the various sects with the name, Fu Kun.

Eight Trigrams immediately sent him here after receiving news about the crown. He brought along an elite group as well, making the kingdom’s intention as clear as day.

They clearly didn’t want the next sage appointed to be from Mountguard. Since the crown has returned, it should be taken to their kingdom. Only they were worthy of possessing an item of this level!

Fu Kun came with absolute conviction. Nothing was out of line in order to seize the crown, including murdering everyone here.

An envoy wasn’t that prestigious of a position but it was very influential. Moreover, a third-level Ascender like him shouldn’t have any problem dealing with this tiny sect.

One could easily see the disparity in power from this. The kingdom could casually send out any envoy and that would still be enough to sweep through Mountguard. The kingdom itself was a behemoth in comparison.

Fu Kun sat in the main position that was meant for the school master. Of course, he didn’t really give a damn since he could do whatever he wanted here.

Around him were masters in uniforms with an aggressive aura. These were clearly battle-hardened combatants. This elite group used to be responsible for wiping out traitors in the kingdom.

Fu Kun sat there in an imperious manner, acting as if this was his own home - the dove has taken over the magpie’s nest.

The members of Mountguard’s upper echelon were obviously unhappy with his attitude. Alas, they weren’t in a position to say anything. Eight Trigrams could easily wipe them out.

At this time, Weizheng came in with Jiahui and Li Qiye.

The older members heaved a sigh of relief and celebrated inside. Their school master has successfully invited their ancestor to join this mess. The crown would never leave Mountguard now.

Fu Kun watched the trio and narrowed his eyes. He coldly uttered: “School Master Chen, what do you think you’re doing bringing this cripple here?”

He didn’t try to hide his feeling of superiority and lorded over Mountguard’s school master.

“Envoy, this is our ancestor.” Weizheng restrained himself, thinking that this was his own fault for being weak.

“Ancestor?” Fu Kun glared at Li Qiye and took a good look at him, finding that this was only a wheelchair-bound cripple.

“School Master Chen, this nonsense can’t trick me. Your sect announced that a reclusive ancestor of your has returned and brought back the Virtuous Crown. That’s why you will establish a new-generation sage.” Fu Kun said.

“Envoy, that sounds about right.” Weizheng replied.

“I’m afraid that this deceitful attempt won’t go as you plan when I’m around. That’s your new sage? A little girl still wet behind the ears daring to call herself a sage? Know your limits!” Fu Kun snorted and looked over at Jiahui. To be exact, the crown on her head.

“That’s the mythical Virtuous Crown?” He has never seen the crown before, only thinking that it was his now.

“Yes, Envoy.” Weizheng knew of his malicious intent. He would have told Jiahui to hide if Li Qiye didn’t come along.

“Hmph, School Master Chen, your sect’s action can be considered as lying to the people and disrupting the peace of Immortal Demon System, a serious offense!” Fu Kun declared: “Hand over the Virtuous Crown in order to redeem your sect or face heavy punishments.”

“Envoy, establishing the next stage is Mountguard’s responsibility and internal matter. We only need to report this to fellow sects, no need for anyone else to get involved.” Weizheng answered in a proper manner.

This was indeed the case. No other sects were qualified to interfere with the sage appointment, not even the Longevity Hall.

“School Master Chen, watch what you’re saying.” Fu Kun retorted: “The times have changed, your fallen sect has lost the qualification to hold the crown or establish a sage. To do so is merely insulting the title of sage!”

His eyes became fierce with a cold glint: “Be smart and hand over the crown, don’t make this mistake.”

Weizheng took a deep breath and put on a solemn expression: “Envoy, for millions of years now, the crown has always belonged to Mountguard. The sage must also be from Mountguard, no one can change this fact!”
