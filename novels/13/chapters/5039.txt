Chapter 5040: Returning Souls

Li Qiye roared and focused the rays into his hand again, pressing them with lightning speed against the empress dowager’s forehead.

“Buzz.” Her corpse lit up more than the others.

Strands of divinity emanated from her and life returned to the corpse. Alas, the strands were feeble and could fade to a single gust of wind.

The youths watched with bated breath, not daring to move because that might disturb the divine strands. 

The strands came together and formed a bright expanse. It eventually became an ethereal figure that slowly rise from the corpse.

It was identical to the empress dowager, resembling something of a spirit. Ming Shi immediately covered her mouth, not wanting to gasp loudly and scare it away.

The figure only stared at the key in Yunyun’s hand, nothing else. The atmosphere became rather tense as they awaited Yunyun’s first words.

However, she didn’t say anything and only stared intensely at the figure, communicating earnestly with her eyes and seemingly asking for permission.

The figure stopped looking at the ruler and released a bright particle, looking like a drop of dew on a blade of grass during the early morning. The shimmering drop landed on Yunyun’s forehead and caused a ripple.

It entered her mind and turned into a tiny rune. With that, the figure dispersed and the light on the corpse dissipated as well. The final strand of divinity was now gone.

After a while, Yunyun opened her eyes and kowtowed before the corpse.

“What did the empress dowager say?” Ming Shi asked after Yunyun was finished with the ceremony.

Yunyun smiled wryly and shook her head: “Nothing, just a rune that I can’t understand right away.”

“We’re leaving, there’s nothing else to see here.” Li Qiye got up.

“Young Noble, don’t we want to try and communicate with the other corpses, perhaps we can find the culprit that way?” Ming Shi couldn’t help but ask.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s not that simple. This method shouldn’t be performed repeatedly or there will be consequences.” Li Qiye shook his head.

Yunyun bowed deeply toward him, aware of the risk he had just taken to immensely help her out.

Next, the youths decided to bury the corpses and erect memorial gravestones. Future descendants could pay respect later on.

Once they exited through the gate, they saw Shadowrider still standing there. They thought that the young noble was right - he didn’t take this opportunity to flee.

However, there was another person who was laying on the ground. The youths were surprised because they recognized him - Qing Songke from the academy.

“What did you do?” Ming Shi thought that Shadowrider had killed him.

“Should I kill him?” Shadowrider ignored her and asked Li Qiye.

So it turned out that Qing Songke came near and was knocked out instantly by Shadowrider.

“You can’t just kill randomly, no one hired you.” Ming Shi said.

“Let him go.” Li Qiye simply didn’t care about the youth.

Ming Shi heaved a sigh of relief after hearing this.

Shadowrider then woke the youth up. The latter opened his eyes and was horrified to see Shadowrider. He immediately got up and leaped backward, pale.

“Don’t worry, you wouldn’t be alive right now if he wants to kill you.” Li Qiye said.

Qing Songke saw the group and speculated on the situation. It seemed that Li Qiye had saved him again for the second time.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye ignored him and started walking away.

As they were leaving, Yunyun asked: “Dao Brother, why are you here?”

“I am following the traces of my ancestor but unfortunately, I’m a little lost.” He revealed the truth.

“Be careful of this dangerous place, I think you should leave as soon as possible.” Goldcrest said, aware of the dangers looming in his home.

Qing Songke didn’t say anything. Once the group was gone, he looked around and didn’t notice anything, only that this palace appeared a little familiar.

“Where are we going now?” Ming Shi asked.

Li Qiye smiled and glanced at Shadowrider who hesitated for a moment before answering: “Mist.”

This surprised all the youths. Goldcrest, in particular, had a light flashing in his mind. This made him stare at Shadowrider in disbelief.

Unfortunately, their journey was interrupted by two mighty cultivators - Thousand-faced Sovereign and Truth Conqueror.

The emotional youths immediately bowed after seeing them. The sovereign had a holy aura that commanded respect. As for the low-profile conqueror, they still couldn’t help but revere her.

A conqueror was a supreme being. Dragon lords were innately inferior. In order to make up for the disparity between the two cultivation schools, the former needed to be way farther down the road.
