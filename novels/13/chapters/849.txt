Chapter 850: Golden Serpent With The Golden Crow

Many immediately looked over at Li Qiye after the young king stated his challenge. Everyone knew that Li Qiye’s audacity was boundless, so they wanted to see if he would accept this challenge or not. Of course, some hoped that Li Qiye could incite chaos. Only a brute like Li Qiye would be able to destroy Ye Qingcheng’s plans so that others would have the chance to enter the beastworld.

“It’s just an insignificant formation, there’s no need for me to do anything.” Li Qiye simply didn’t care for this type of formation. In his eyes, it was far from the apex.

Keep in mind that the most powerful formations in this world came from him and the Formation Ancestor. In the past, they created the “Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation”. It massacred everything and created rivers of blood across the nine worlds!

Such a response left the elders from the school furious. They angrily glared at Li Qiye since this was a blatant humiliation! If their school claimed to be number two in formations, no one else would dare claim to be number one! But now, Li Qiye was clearly looking down on their grand formation with contempt.

Li Qiye completely ignored the unfriendly gazes and smiled: “I’m not interested in your bullshit. You want to stop me with just this formation?” With that, he signaled with his hand and said: “Girl, it is time to test your talents. Break this formation.”

Long Jingxian immediately rushed forward and rolled up her sleeves. This crazed girl liked to fight more than anyone else, so the moment she saw this formation, her battle intent instantly soared.

Many people were astonished by her advance. They were both frightened and skeptical. The fear was from whether the Kui she was riding was real or not while the skepticism stemmed from her origin. Just who was she to be acting so bold alongside Li Qiye!

Of course, very few people in this world knew of Long Jingxian. She rarely showed herself, and the citadel also didn’t want people to know that they had a descendant with a natural born Immortal Fate!

At the same time, Jian Wushuang was coldly staring at the prince and uttered: “Start!”

The prince didn’t want to fight her, so he wryly smiled: “Miss Jian, why should we cross swords? Plus, I don’t want to hurt you.”

Jian Wushuang snorted in response and coldly uttered: “Aren’t you known for grasping the essence of Immortal Emperor Jin She’s arts? Someone adept at two different schools of techniques? Didn’t you claim that your tribe’s supreme arts can challenge my Jian Clan’s archery? Very well, I’ll give you the chance today to see our archery firsthand!”

The prince instantly responded: “Ah, that was only a misunderstanding. I was only joking back then.” Back then when he wanted to see Jian Wushuang and invaded the clan, he made that comment out of hubris.

Jian Wushuang ignored his nonsense and flatly said: “Less words, let’s fight!”

The prince took a deep breath then answered: “If Miss Jian truly wants to see my supreme arts, then I’ll try my best today!”

Jian Wushuang only snorted as a cold glint flashed across her eyes like two sharp arrows that carried a blatant ice-cold murderous intent. If it wasn’t for the elders stopping her back then during his intrusion, she would have tried to kill him already.

“Ey, can you take care of him in three to five moves?” Long Jingxian stared at Jian Wushuang with a provocative look: “Jian Wushuang, do you want to bet? Whoever finishes first is the winner!”

“Why not!” Jian Wushuang laughed proudly.

“Good, it’s decided, let us get started then.” Long Jingxian cheerfully laughed then immediately headed for the grand formation of the Celestial Array School. She disappeared inside the many pavilions and temples.

“Miss Jian, you have to be careful!” The prince shouted at this time. He was a genius with a great amount of pride after all. Being looked down upon by the two girls like this enraged him.

The angry prince emitted a boundless brilliance. The powerful flames of the sun soared up from his body. A golden crow slowly emerged from this flame as if the sun was its dwelling. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At the same time, a golden serpent flew around the powerful flame. It was especially dazzling under the blinding sunlight!

“The golden serpent together with the golden crow!” Someone was startled after seeing this. A Demon King from the southern region exclaimed: “The prince actually managed to combine the arts from both the Golden Crow Tribe and Immortal Emperor Jin She!”

After hearing this, those who knew a little about the ravine and the Golden Crow Tribe were astounded.

Immortal Emperor Jin She was the second emperor of the ravine while the tribe was its foundation. The emperor was a major reason for the ravine’s survival as he acted as its supporting pillar. Moreover, the tribe also occupied many ancestor seats throughout the history of the ravine, thus its influence was immense. It could even control the fate of the sect itself.

Although the Golden Crow Tribe had never produced an Immortal Emperor, its merit law could be considered the best.

However, there was a particular phenomenon at the ravine. Immortal Emperor Jin She’s emperor law and the crow tribe’s law were opposing in nature. This meant that those in the ravine who cultivated the crow’s law would absolutely be unable to cultivate the emperor’s law! However, the prince managed to combine both arts — this came as a great shock!

A golden crow would devour a golden serpent and vice versa; these two existences were as incompatible as fire and ice. The crow’s law prioritized strength to grow while the emperor’s law used speed and agility to reign.

Thus, the combination of the two would allow the prince to have both superior strength and speed. Moreover, their tribe’s powerful body meant that the prince was a weapon in human form!

“To have both strength and agility on top of the emperor law’s reaction means that the prince will be able to crush most enemies without even using a weapon. If he has an imperial weapon as well, then just how strong will he be?” Someone murmured as they stared at the golden serpent coiling around his body.

“Miss Jian, watch out!” The prince’s confidence erupted after displaying his ultimate weapon.

“Nonsense.” Jian Wushuang snorted as her bow lit up. She shot out the word “Formation”. The moment the arrow appeared, a formation instantly came into existence. A rain of arrows quickly shot towards the prince.

The prince let out a cry and leaped into the sky like a gigantic golden crow taking flight. He flapped his wings, creating clanking sounds. The wings were able to cut down the barrage of arrows.

This was the power of the Golden Crow Tribe. Their bodies were weapons; his wings were two sabers capable of slicing through the sharp rain.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and sharp. In an instant, she unleashed a “Soldier” arrow. It was extremely fast and whizzed through the sky. Even time itself lost control of its stability as it was sped up by this arrow.

It was simply too fast. No one could even see the arrow. Even a peak Heavenly King would not be able to evade it.

However, the prince cried out and spread his wings to roll in the sky. Then he fearlessly flew straight towards this “Soldier” arrow at an astonishing speed.

Under such great speed, everyone thought that the prince wouldn’t be able to dodge this arrow, and that the arrow would pierce his body!

However, right when the arrow was about to penetrate him, his body twisted like a golden serpent at an unbelievable speed. He was extremely agile and was able to narrowly dodge this arrow!

Not only was the evasion successful, but he instantly attacked Jian Wushuang as well. His speed was no less than Jian Wushuang’s firing rate.

A phoenix hymn filled the sky. In the blink of an eye, images of phoenixes began to dance. She disappeared amidst these birds and instantly showed up in a different location.

Nevertheless, the prince’s frightening speed immediately allowed him to come killing the moment she emerged at the new location. He reached out with his sharp golden claws capable of tearing all things into pieces, including weapons!

Jian Wushuang remained calm in the face of danger and shot out a “Front” arrow. This one arrow created myriad realms to protect her. In addition to this, her phoenix physique activated, signaled by the hymns of divine birds!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!” A series of shattering sounds could be heard shortly after. The prince’s golden claw tore through these layers of protective realms at an incredible rate.

However, the moment he made it through the myriad realms, Jian Wushuang was no longer there. He soared through the sky again and lunged towards a different direction.

This time, Jian Wushuang was already standing right there while coldly glaring at the prince. The prince, on the other hand, was courageous and rushed forward without any hesitation.

“Boom!” During his advance, a surging flame charged into the sky and instantly set him ablaze. As she was hiding with her physique, Jian Wushuang had shot out an ambush arrow. This was a fiery arrow; the moment anyone set foot inside her domain, it would instantly activate.

“It’s no use, I am a golden crow!” The prince was undaunted against such an overbearing blaze. The sun rose behind him and crazily devoured this powerful flame. Jian Wushuang’s fiery arrow couldn’t hurt him at all!

Many people were astounded by the prince’s might. Although they knew that he was not as great as Ye Qingcheng, his combination of two conflicting arts made his prowess rise several times over!

The agility of Immortal Emperor Jin She meant that he could avoid the vast majority of techniques. Plus, he had the speed of a golden crow as well, meaning that anyone who faced him would become a punching bag!

“Zzzzz—” An icy gust blew by. The moment the prince had just finished devouring the flames, a chilling mist emerged from his body. This extreme rime was about to freeze him completely.

The prince’s expression quickly changed as he channeled the refined fire around his body to dispel this layer of ice. As a result, a mist enveloped his entire body.

Jian Wushuang’s ambush was not a fiery arrow, but a fire-ice arrow with cold hiding within the heat. The prince was confident in his fire devouring ability and didn’t expect to fall into a trap, thus he was sealed by the ice property hidden within the powerful flame.

“Pluff! Pluff! Pluff!” While the prince was using his refined flames to remove the ice, Jian Wushuang had already shot out the word “All”. This was an invisible arrow with no tangible form, making it difficult to dodge. However, with his dual arts, the prince would still be able to dodge this arrow.

Unfortunately for him, his body was currently encased in frost. His reaction time slowed, allowing the arrow to strike its target, causing him to be stained with blood.
