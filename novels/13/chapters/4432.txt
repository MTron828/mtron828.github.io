Chapter 4433: Unstoppable Slash

This was the end of the ex-sect master of Five-sun despite the protection of his son’s treasure bowl.

“Boom!” A deafening explosion resulted in considerable pain in the eardrums. The slash continued and left behind a lasting trail. The visual of the trail painted an empty feeling after actualizing the physical distance.

It seemed to be feeble and powerless yet it easily cut down the dao laws emanating from the bowl.

The laws contained the power and understanding of a potential dao lord. Alas, they stood no chance against the seemingly-unimpressive slash.

“Boom!” Finally, the slash made it through all the dao laws and struck the bowl itself.

The bowl immediately lost its radiance upon contact. Its immense power was not enough to stop a weak slash seemingly coming from a mortal - one that wouldn’t be able to cut down a tree branch. In reality, it had the opposite effect - total destruction.

The weakened bowl was sent flying like a meteor and disappeared into the horizon, leaving behind complete silence.

Li Qiye’s single slash still managed to kill the ex-sect master and defeat the Bowl of the World. He didn’t need to perform a top saber art of channel energy, just the swing of his blade was more than enough.

The crowd thought that the whole thing was inconceivable. Anyone else doing the same thing would have been killed since the opponent was none other than Five-sun King - a renowned genius.

That attack was enough to injure most Heavenly Sovereigns, let alone a simple slash.

“Not again…” One expert calmed down and murmured.

Everyone was utterly confused since no one could account for Li Qiye’s sorcery. How could they try to fathom the dao mysteries behind the slash when it had none? Even ancestors couldn’t spot any transformation or saber dao.

Thus, the only conclusion was that he simply swung the saber like a mortal.

“What the hell did he do?” An expert said.

“How do we even name it? Ordinary slash? Casual slash?” A cultivator from a big sect joked.

Some wanted to give a name to this amazingly-effective technique. Alas, this proved to be a difficult task due to the stark contrast between its nature and effectiveness. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Others turned their focus towards the east, especially Five-sun School. Night has returned again and the bright radiance was gone.

“Will Five-sun King attack again?” A clan member wondered.

Though the first exchange was clearly Li Qiye favored, Five-sun King didn’t come in person. Thus, it couldn’t be considered a defeat. The question was, would this great genius let it go like this?

“He must avenge his father no matter the price. This is what must be done, the feud is irreconcilable.” An older expert said.

“No matter the price…” Some shuddered after hearing this.

Five-sun King was both powerful and influential. If he were to go all out, destruction of several sects might be possible.

“Putting his father’s death aside, he has lost to Li Qiye today. If he doesn’t defeat Li Qiye, how will he prove his dao and become a dao lord? Li Qiye has become an obstacle that he must surpass and kill. A fight is inevitable.” One ancestor said.

“Can Li Qiye handle it?” One expert glanced at Li Qiye.

“Hard to say, Five-sun King isn’t alone since he has numerous supporters. They will definitely lend a hand in killing Li Qiye.” A big shot from the east said.

“Looks like Li Qiye will have a tough time finding safe haven. In fact, it’ll be worse for him after Five-sun King becomes a dao lord.” Another speculated.

“I disagree. Li Qiye won’t just be sitting idly. In my opinion, he’ll be the killer, not the victim.” A supporter of Li Qiye claimed.

“Are you sure? Five-sun King has mighty dao protectors. Can Li Qiye overcome them?” The big shot from the east said.

This didn’t surprise anyone. After all, top geniuses normally had capable dao protectors, let alone an heir like Five-sun King.
