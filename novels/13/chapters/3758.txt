Chapter 3759: Effortlessly

The golden swords lacerated the spatial fabrics, on the verge of taking Chi Xiaoyue down next.

The spectators gasped; some covered their mouth while others turned away - unable to bear seeing her being turned to a bloody mist.

In this split second, Li Qiye finally spoke again: “Release the dao, Six Sense Break!”

Chi Xiaoyue’s grand dao suddenly activated along with her six senses. They instantly buried Liu Huaishi’s attack with the might of a primordial beast.

“Boom!” She waved both hands and the formations crumbled. The incoming swords headed for Liu Huaishi instead.

He shouted from horror and pulled back the whip for defense. Despite being as fast as lightning, it wasn’t enough to stop the backlash.

“Boom!” He got pushed out of the mountain and free fall until eventually smashing the base - resulting in a huge pit.

Dust scattered everywhere. Mouths were open wide enough to fit a goose egg at this point.

Liu Huaishi was the first one to attack yet he still lost the exchange. People had a hard time calming down.

Once they realized the situation, they became increasingly frightened. When Chi Xiaoyue attacked earlier, numerous ancestors were watching. They still didn’t notice anything special and had no idea how she defeated Force Devourer.

“Is Li Qiye still human?” One ancestor glanced at Li Qiye.

“Of course he is, just know that he’s the son of miracles too.” A teacher from Duality smiled wryly.

This title has been increasingly popular. Those who witnessed him doing so multiple times were at a loss for words.

“He really figured out how to break Force Devourer? That’s so heaven-defying. Has it ever been done before?” One big shot asked.

“Break, I’m not sure, but it’s definitely effective.” Another expert became excited.

The youths from the holy ground celebrated. It seemed that the mysterious Li Qiye has decided to join their cause.

“Bam!” Liu Huaishi got out of the pit, covered in dirt and wounds.

Chi Xiaoyue didn’t want to take his life earlier but the injuries were still relatively serious.

“I accept my defeat.” Liu Huaishi climbed up the steps and cupped his fist towards Chi Xiaoyue.

“No, I took advantage of the situation, it’s an honorless victory.” She returned the respectful gesture.

The end of this battle was great news for the members of the holy ground.

“We finally won one.” Someone heaved a sigh of relief.

The battle was nerve-racking for many since Chi Xiaoyue was absolutely an underdog. A second loss seemed inevitable until Li Qiye joined. Just a few sentences from him turned the tides to everyone’s astonishment.

Liu Huaishi then cupped his fist towards Li Qiye but was ignored. He then moved back and stood next to Xu Cuimei.

“Thank you for your guidance, Young Master.” Chi Xiaoyue walked over to the creek and bowed her head.

Li Qiye didn’t answer her either, still focusing on fishing.

A while back, most would have thought that he was being too arrogant and putting up an act. Now, no one saw through him and kept quiet instead.

Despite a lack of response, Chi Xiaoyue still bowed one more time before leaving.

“Alright, ladies and gentlemen, my mission is complete. The scion will come to spar against the heroes of the holy ground. We can’t wait to see your great techniques.” Xu Cuimei smiled and told the crowd.

The geniuses that were rejoicing earlier felt the pressure again. She woke them up from their celebration.

Chi Xiaoyue’s victory was only a minor one. Righteous Scion was still coming. The next battle was the true test between their holy ground and Righteous Sect. But who could actually take him on?

Xu Cuimei then cupped her fist and left with Cloudwhip and Thunderblade.

Silence took over the area.

“Take your leave, everyone.” Dugu Lan said: “Righteous Scion won’t make it here instantly. If anyone wishes to challenge him along the way, go for it. But don’t force yourself.”

No one responded due to their pessimistic mood.

They all saw how powerful Thunderblade and Cloudwhip were. Righteous Scion was definitely stronger.

No one dared to challenge him. This meant that he would be able to walk straight to Minor Sacred Mountain - something truly shameful for the holy ground.

Though the humiliation was unbearable, there was nothing they could do.

They understood that fighting him would be great information-gathering for Dugu Lan. The problem was, who would dare to step up?

“I shall return to Divine Ghost to ask for a weapon.” Phantom Sacred Child told Dugu Lan then left.

His solemn expression told everyone that this would at least be a dao lord-level weapon. It certainly made the crowd feel better.

“I’ll talk to the elders in the court, we’ll do everything to help you, Fairy.” Hu Ben cupped his fist and hastily left as well.

Their hasty departure was due to the pressure stemming from Thunderblade and especially Cloudwhip.

Just one chapter from Evil Devourer was dreadful enough. The scion knew at least four chapters. Thus, the two needed to prepare more than ever before.

One genius started leaving after another. Some truly wanted to help Dugu Lan but they lacked the abilities.

They would have had a hard time dealing with Cloudwhip. Therefore, they might not be able to last two or three moves against the scion. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Listen, let Li Qiye participate in the last battle, this might be enough.” A few geniuses had this idea as they were leaving.

“Hmm, the cultivation gap is too great.” One peer disagreed.

“Right, but he’s Li Qiye. Senior Sister Xiaoyue won by following his order.” A student added.
