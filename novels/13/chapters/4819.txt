Chapter 4820: Stopping Three Overlords

“Finish this as fast as possible.” The alligator lord agreed.

“So be it, connect the epochs.” The abyssal lord concurred.

These epoch lords knew but had no love for each other. This was only a temporary alliance that was built in the blink of an eye out of absolute necessity.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The only way to capture this epoch was to take down Li Qiye first. There couldn’t be a better opportunity due to his heavenly injuries.

If they wasted more time, he might actually be able to recover and their plan would be over. He wouldn’t forgive them for what they had done, meaning that they would lose everything after one wrong move.

“Epoch flow!” The abyssal lord started the sequence by manipulating time.

“Boom!” An untold number of years surged out of his body and rushed into the sky, connecting the present and the past.

This river of time was magnificent and beautiful, encompassing various colors and legends…

They had images of numerous races. Each living being had their own stories and past - happy and sad occasions…

“Epoch flow!” Dead Immortal did the same.

“Boom!” Another river of time surged upward just like the first.

The two rivers joined together, the same for the timelines.

Meanwhile, the alligator lord also released his timeline. Unfortunately, Triune Immortal immediately put a stop to that. The two of them were born in the same epoch, meaning that his time was also hers.

“Boom!” He tried again only to be stopped once more.

“Hurry, we’re running out of time!” His allies urged.

“Return!” The alligator lord released a seal filled with death.

On another battlefield, the yin kun peng blocked a fierce attack from Seven Martial Goddess. It roared and flapped its gigantic wings, releasing enough death affinity to open a portal.

It rushed through the portal and appeared behind the alligator lord.

“Zzz…” It fused together with its master and became a kun peng seal on his lord’s stomach.

With that, he attempted the temporal release for the third time. The roar of a kun peng could be heard and finally, a temporal stream rushed out of his body successfully.

This culminated in a circle with three separate epochs rotating together. The battlefields joined at once and the overlords appeared near each other.

They formed an eternal triangle of connection between the three epochs - Triune, Aqua, and Bionic. The new time flow was flawless and continuous, forming a closed loop.

“Temporal harmonization.” A neutral overlord deep in space whispered.

Under normal circumstances, the river of time consisted of the past, present, and future. However, this loop between the three epochs has escaped the regular boundary and reached stability. With the connection finished, something magnificent happened. 

In Triune, the three overlords appeared together. Strangely enough, there were three of them in Aqua and Bionic as well - a total of nine supreme overlords.

Spectators were astounded. Just one overlord was frightening enough but now, there were copies in each other’s epoch.

Dead Immortal’s epoch was the past and the other two appeared in the past. The abyssal lord’s time was the present and the others appeared as well. Lastly, the alligator lord's epoch served as the future.

“Rumble!” One set of three walked out to fight the Supreme Monarch. Another went to deal with Triune Immortal.

The last set connected their temporal sphere to Eight Desolaces, causing this destination to quake violently.

The moment they arrived, their terrifying auras suppressed everyone down to the ground.

“Wh-what is happening…” The strongest sovereigns felt helpless in comparison.

Three have turned into nine overlords, making the situation seem helpless. Eight Desolaces were as feeble as ships trapped by a violent storm.

The trio wasted no time devouring anything else - their target was Li Qiye alone.

“Boom!” They all reached for him at the same time and spectators bellowed in horror.

“Whoosh!” Suddenly, a hatchet came out of nowhere and separated the dao into two halves.

Its power was enough to alarm the three, prompting them to pull their hand back.

An old man left his burial ground and also rode a temporal river to arrive in Eight Desolaces. The hatchet returned to his hand.

He had a shriveled appearance yet still looked unbeatable despite facing three overlords.

“Another supreme overlord!” This became apparent to the spectators.
