Dracoform had a hard time taking in that last statement while the crowd became frozen.

He might not be a top existence among Eternals, but one would be hard-pressed to find someone on Myriad to match him, let alone someone stronger. Now, Li Qiye viewed him like an ant?

Everyone exchanged glances with their friends, speechless. Li Qiye was obviously strong; surely stronger than Dracoform Martial God. But to call him an ant? Too arrogant of a comment.

Though people have grown used to Fiercest’s aggressive attitude and would find its absence jarring, they felt he was out of line this time around.

If Dracoform Martial God was an ant, then what were they? And all the cultivators and systems in Myriads? Certainly inferior to an ant.

The older experts were vexed. Some scowled: “Fiercest is very powerful, but he is just needlessly insulting Dracoform Martial God, an ungraceful showing.”

Dracoform represented the strongest man of the last generation, so these old men naturally didn’t like this blatant insult from Li Qiye.

“I see, then please teach me.” Dracoform Martial God finally stepped forward and headed for the sky.

He had no other choice. Li Qiye had made his way into their system and wouldn’t back down. They would need to either fight to the end or to acquiesce to his demands.

Nevertheless, he wasn’t blinded by anger. His form remained ethereal and each step left a footprint on the sky. Furthermore, they were uniform with the same distance from each other, seemingly measured by a ruler to the finest detail on top of containing his dao rhythm. The key thing was that he did it so effortlessly, indicating his immense power.

It meant that his attacks would also have precise movements and variations. He could unleash and withdraw techniques on a whim, perfection or even reaching the point of apogee.

As the saying goes - laymen watch for fun; experts watch to learn. Ordinary cultivators wouldn’t be able to notice this but the ancestors became serious just from watching his steps, realizing how frightening he was.

“Now that’s more interesting, challenging me in apogee? So be it, let’s have a match.” Li Qiye saw the prints left behind in the sky and became amused.

On the other hand, Li Qiye’s steps left nothing in the sky as if he was just an ordinary person.

Alas, when facing Li Qiye, Dracoform had a serious expression, not daring to be careless since he took in everything when Li Qiye was crossing through Woodmen Alley.

He devoted his life to techniques and variations. It could be said that he could use them as he pleased, and in any order. Still, he was greatly shaken while spectating Li Qiye, realizing that the guy had an incredible gap on apogee.

Because of this, he chose against using an invincible weapon or a supreme art, relying on the simplest techniques instead.

After reaching the level of Eternals, cultivating top arts wasn’t uncommon. They cared more about minute variations, boosting the potential of each move to the limit.

Anticipation was at an all-time high as everyone watched with bated breath. Though the two looked quite calm, bereft of divinity and destructive auras, their first move would certainly be capable of crushing gods and devils.

Li Qiye leisurely stood there, full of openings in the eyes of Dracoform. Each opening could result in a fatal blow. However, Dracoform knew that at their level, these openings were trivial. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Let’s get started.” Dracoform cupped his fist. Though this would be a brutal fight, Dracoform lacked bloodthirst and fury, replaced by composure instead.

“Go.” Li Qiye smiled: “I want to see how much you have mastered your techniques.”

“Excuse me then.” Dracoform didn’t hold back and rushed forward.

The move got there instantly. It wasn’t flashy, lacking a loud detonation and a blinding flash. The name was Black Tiger Strike.

People wouldn’t believe that this was his first choice. Not to mention cultivators, even a faker could learn this move in two days or so.

It couldn’t be simpler and had no variations to speak of. A regular martial artist could perform this move in an identical manner as Dracoform.

The crowd believed that Dracoform would start the match with a dazzling move, such as a supreme merit law, a famous move from Vermillion, or one of the twelve variations.

Who would have thought that he would use Black Tiger Strike against Li Qiye?

Some thought they were seeing things. Others speculated that perhaps this move had some hidden changes.

“Maybe we just don’t understand this move? There’s more to it?” An elder rolled his eyes and began to think.

Unfortunately, no transformation came. The simple move continued heading for Li Qiye.

In fact, Dracoform didn’t look like the number one expert of Myriad but more like a mortal that had only learned martial arts for several days.

Of course, the wise ancestors were quietly praising him: “Such free movements, so tight too, not one drop of water can leak out.”

Naturally, this seemingly-unimpressive fist could destroy the world. People didn’t see any power coming from it because he had full control over it. Only when it made contact with Li Qiye’s chest would he allow this power to erupt. This meant that no energy was wasted before a successful blow.

This was more than enough to either grievously injure or even kill another Eternal. He was the only one in Myriad who could use this ordinary move to this extent.
