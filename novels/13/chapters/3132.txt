An illusory space with flashing stars - a dreamlike location. This place was deep in Ascension Pond, a place where no one has been before outside of Li Qiye.

He was refining a weapon brimming with the power of the high heaven, majestic and mighty beyond imagination.

“You’re entering the expanse to kill?” An ethereal voice sounded.

“Not necessarily, just going with the flow. I do hope he’s smart enough to back off but the opposite is more than fine too, I’ll see how sharp my blade is.” Li Qiye looked up and smiled before glancing at his weapon.

“For what reason are you actually going? Those three old men?” The pond clearly questioned Li Qiye’s motives. It seemed capable of seeing the end of the world.

“There’s a potential shortcut there. If there’s a way in, there’s a way out.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re courting death, bringing a fat sheep straight to the tiger’s jaws.” The voice didn’t hold back at all.

“Is that so? Why not, that’s one way to bait the tiger, no?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“You’re not strong enough.” The voice eventually said: “You might think you’re strong and amazing, same with your dao heart, but once you go in there, only eternal damnation awaits.”

“I must be hearing things because it sounds like you’re worried about me. Makes me a little scared from being loved so much.” Li Qiye joked.

“You’re bringing a streak of tigers here, a calamity will turn everything to ashes.” The voice snorted.

“I’m aware, you’re afraid that once broken, Three Immortals is such a fat piece of meat. You’ll be the same.” Li Qiye said. [re] It’s unclear in this last line whether Li Qiye is saying that the pond will join in and feast on Three Immortals or it’ll become a target too[/ref]

“Die if you want but don’t drag the entire world down with you.” The voice coldly uttered.

“Who says I want to do that? Stagnation is the most fatal choice. Nothing stays the same forever, not in the past, present, and future. Three Immortals are certainly impregnable right now, this might not be true later.” Li Qiye said.

“The three geezers screwed it up, hmph!” The voice scowled.

“Maybe, but even without this issue, you don’t think something else will happen in the future?” Li Qiye said: “Nothing is unbreakable nor eternal. You and they are ancient enough to know this logic more than me.”

The voice didn’t respond this time. A lull took over.

“Of course, if you are willing to help me, I’m sure it’ll be good. This is the best opportunity.” Li Qiye leisurely said.

“No, I have no interest in falling down together with you.” The voice refused right away.

“Then you can keep on hiding in your shell like a cowardly turtle until you’re found, and that’s inevitable.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hiding and fighting, the result is the same. You can’t change anything, the same with me.” The voice said.

“Not necessarily. There are many unknowns in the world.” Li Qiye said.

“None. I know more and they know more than you.” The voice said.

“I won’t deny that.” Li Qiye nodded: “But I am me and they are they, there’s a clear difference.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“All the same. Some had the same thoughts as you in the past. What happened in the end? They still became lackeys.” The voice responded.

“Yes, it’s not surprising at all. Nothing is scarier than the heart of men.” Li Qiye agreed.

“Truly terrifying.” The voice emphasized.

“But you’re not men, we are. Because of this difference, you all will never be able to become true immortals but we still can. See, now that’s the difference, one’s superior to the other.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmph, insects, after all is said and done, are still insects.” The voice scowled.

“Then you need to be careful and avoid being bitten by them. Insects might be small but they can multiply, you all can’t. When you die, your kind will end.” Li Qiye said.

“Look at this world and history. So many epochs have ended but in the present day, the so-called insects are still alive. People have changed, same with the methods, but they keep on struggling beneath the sky.” Li Qiye paused for a bit before continuing: “On the other hand, when one of you dies, that’s one fewer, so you tell me, who is the real ruler of this world?”

The voice also understood this particular train of thought and didn’t respond.

“Have you thought of the day when you become a fat piece of meat? It’s not unprecedented.” Li Qiye went on.

“And?” The voice said.

“I can see that you do not wish to take action but there are other ways. For example, me. Don’t you think someone as handsome as me will always win? Do it right and I’ll become the only true immortal.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Stop fantasizing.” The voice coldly uttered.

“That’s one way to put it but think about the possibility. What if I become a true immortal? Or, we can take one step back and assume that I’ll fail. Nevertheless, my going all out is still a good thing for all of you. You reap all the rewards without doing anything, able to live and see the sun again.” Li Qiye continued.

“Are you threatening me?” The voice questioned.

“Feel free to see it however you want, but calling it a threat is rather shallow for people like us. It’s more of an investment. I’m definitely worth it!” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’ll die.” The voice said with absolute certainty.

“But if I don’t?” Li Qiye put on a serious expression, the same with his voice.

“What do you want?” The voice paused for a bit before asking.

“I know you all still have some good stuff.” Li Qiye let out a satisfied grin.

“No, I don’t, my resources are limited.” The voice became vigilant.

“No, I said you all, not just you, you all. Just you alone is not enough. I might be poor but not that poor.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmph, don’t win an inch and want a foot, being too greedy will only result in trouble.” The voice didn’t like this.

“False, if this is considered greedy, then how are you going to invest in me? We’re considered big shots, right? So if we’re going to play, then do it big. Don’t be so small-minded now.” Li Qiye said.

“Even if I agree, it doesn’t mean the others will.” The voice contemplated for a bit before speaking.

“You can tell them my intent. As you can see, I’m quite busy, I don’t have time to go visit each one. Trust me, don’t miss this great investment, there won’t be another.” Li Qiye said flatly.

“I understand.” The voice replied.

“It’s a deal then. One day, you will all be joyous for this will be the most fruitful investment of your life.” Li Qiye smirked.

The voice scowled but didn’t bother to retort this time around.

However, right at this second, a pair of eyes seemed to be opening in this deep space. It gazed towards Uncrossable Ocean.

“It’s coming.” The voice said.

Li Qiye stopped refining his weapon and stood up, also gazing towards the expanse.

“Yes.” His eyes turned cold after penetrating the void.
