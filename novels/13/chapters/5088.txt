Chapter 5089: Imprisoned

No man has ever set foot this deep into the sacred mountain with one exception - its founder.

The area was worshipped as a holy ground. All generations knew that the resources beneath were unfathomable. Chaos true energy constantly oozed out along with dao harmonization. Laws were constantly changing and evolving.

This was no different from an ultimate treasure grove - eternal and boundless. Thus, they dreamed of being able to stay here to cultivate.

Alas, this privilege was reserved for ancient ancestors and dragon lords. Youths with entry were considered supreme geniuses - future pillars of the sect and dragon lord candidates.

As for the origin of this power and energy - this remained elusive to all of them. They only knew that the mountain was brought back by their progenitor.

Li Qiye entered the abyss made by him and reached the depths. This was a place blessed by creation, having been formed by a supreme grand dao and unbreakable seal.

Runes and laws of a conqueror formed numerous layers. As he walked past them, the last layer had turned into a separate chapter with an automatic power capable of crushing any intruder.

After all, its creator was one of the greatest conquerors. Of course, this didn’t hinder Li Qiye’s path.

He made it to a place where the laws became as thick as iron chains. He heard a beating sound - the rhythm of this earth vein.

He saw something there that would frighten anyone else - the deepest crevice of this mountain served as a prison.

A half-naked middle-aged man was locked in chains. He looked mighty with an air of martial arts. Nothing could destroy his love for this dao for they were one and the same.

His flesh and muscles have been through countless tribulations. Each inch brimmed with explosive power. Time has yet to erase his dao.

Alas, there were signs of deterioration. If the imprisonment kept on, he would become all bones eventually.

The chains were actually made from the laws of various dao lords. They have fused into his body at this point like pipes and were connected to the sacred mountain.

In other words, they eternally connected him to the mountain. His true chaos energy, dao power, and dao laws co-existed and empowered the mountain. He was the vessel of Heaven Burial Mountain’s magical properties.

Upon closer inspection, Li Qiye saw this a part of his mind has been taken out - the place where the dao fruit should be.

Witnessing this scene would shock anyone due to the terrifying methods.

Digging out the dao fruit of a once-invincible being and locking him deep here to be used as a power source for eternity - the victim was none other than the legendary Martial Conqueror.

“Big Bro…” The man felt Li Qiye coming closer and smiled weakly. He was already struggling to hold in on but still had a sense of carefree optimism.

Li Qiye shook his head at this sight and raised his hand, instantly severing all the dao chains. They should have been unbreakable but this wasn’t a problem for Li Qiye.

The man fell to the ground without the chains keeping him up. Li Qiye reached out and supported him, seizing the power of the myriad dao.

“Boom!” The power of the earth vein erupted. These dao laws tried to resist him but it was useless.

They struggled like roaring true dragons but it was all in vain. His firm grip instantly subdued them like an expert catching a cobra.

The various affinities were taken from Heaven Burial and sent back into the man’s mind.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Rumble!” Meanwhile, members of Heaven Burial on the surface could tell that their lineage’s power was disappearing.

“Boom!” The foundations of the tributaries in the region leaped into the air, wanting to escape. Alas, an invisible hand seemed to be catching them.

Escaping was futile. All of Heaven Burial turned into a large funnel and the powers were only flowing downward into a single point.
