Two big-shot ancestors came out at the same time - a truly shocking matter for the north. It has been a while since the last exciting event.

“What about Yin Yang Gate?” Many turned towards the third sect.

Everyone knew that Yin Yang must be the one to take charge in the offense. It wasn’t only due to their power and influence, allowing them to keep their allies honest. Most importantly, they had the best reason to siege the city.

For example, if Skylight was in charge, Firmaments might not fully listen to them. Only Yin Yang Gate fulfilled all the requirements.

“Will Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang come out too?” Someone looked over towards the direction of this sect. [1]

The tone of those speaking about him was one of prudence and respect. This ancient ancestor was different from the others since he was comparable to a dao lord.

“It has been eras since his previous appearance, this will go down in history.” A younger ancestor commented.

“Impossible, the last time he came out was to train a dao lord. He stopped showing up after returning from the forbidden zone.” His peer quietly said.

Very few ancient ancestors in the north could compare to Chan Yang. He even trained one of their dao lords - Ancient Zen Dao Lord. This was indicative of his ability and status.

“Wait, he went to the forbidden zone?” A younger cultivator hasn’t heard about this matter.

“Yes, according to the rumors, he’s one of the few survivors after going there. His trip caused quite a stir back then.” A high elder said with a serious expression.

“That’s so heaven-defying.” A fearless young genius became shaken.

“That’s why people in the north view him so highly.” The elder added.

Because of this, the young ones in the group no longer ran their mouth and put on a dignified expression.

Previously, they knew that he was strong but didn’t have a full gauge. This was no longer the case after finding out about his trip to the forbidden zone.

“Buzz...” As people were talking about this issue, a quiet sound began spreading into their ears.

They felt a spatial ripple as if a supreme being had flapped its wings. This was enough to create a widespread fluctuation.

Each buzz seemed to be dissecting the world, akin to the primordial rays shining on the world during its chaos stage.

“Look, Yin Yang Gate at last.” A keen observer could see through the long distance.

Yin Yang was now surrounded by chaos energy with a yin yang touch. Rays emerged from this expanse and created the primordial world - a new beginning for all.

“Rumble!” The ground shook violently. Something deep underground seemed to be turning, ready to get back on the surface.

The yin yang chaos expanse surrounding the sect started churning. Something inside wanted to come out. However, no one could see through the expanse to see the scene within.

Explosions continuously sounded with blossoming rays. This would make people think of invincible masters coming out of their hibernation coffin.

Powerful auras still managed to seep through the yin yang expanse and started ravaging the area nearby. People were horrified by their sheer destructive capability.

“Which ancestors are coming out from there?” The experts of the north knew that powerful cultivators were awakening.

“Definitely the impressive ones, they’re coming out of hibernation.” Most were shaken by the auras.

For a mighty lineage like Yin Yang, ordinary ancestors weren’t qualified to hibernate. The weaker ones would follow the normal aging process. Only the top ones were preserved in this manner. Several auras could be sensed, a sign of multiple ancestors coming out.

Though they didn’t make it public like Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign and Azure Dragon Ancient King, this still showed their determination.

As the crowd was preoccupied with shock and guesses, a group of men rushed out of Yin Yang Gate with an incredible speed.

They traveled without any fanfare nor did they show off their strength. It didn’t take long before they made it to Ancestral City.

They didn’t enter and chose to wait outside instead to avoid any confrontation. Perhaps this was an attempt to reconcile.

“Bai Jianchan is there.” People figured this out and received another breaking news.

“Bai Jianchan wishes to see the ancestors of Ancestral.” Who knows where this piece of information came from? Yin Yang Gate itself might have spread it.

On that day, Bai Jianchan’s request letter was brought to Ancestral. This showed civility and propriety.

“Peaceful measures before using force.” An ancestor from a neutral party understood their intention.

“It’ll be fun with Young Lord Bai there.” The younger crowd couldn’t contain their excitement and started discussing.

“We’ll be able to see his supreme appearance, this might be the biggest harvest. Our trip wasn’t wasted.” The girls went crazy after hearing this.

“I’m satisfied just to see him, or maybe I’ll be able to speak with him for a bit. That’s all I ask for in life.” One girl became silly, completely infatuated. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“He’s a dragon among men, I was fortunate enough to meet him once and can’t forget his handsome face.” A girl who had met him before revealed.

“I don’t ask for much, just one passionate night with him...” Some started fantasizing.

Their male friends were annoyed but couldn’t do anything. Even the most talented youth paled in comparison. They couldn’t keep their head up in his presence.

Bai Jianchan was just too exceptional and could be considered the number one genius of the north.
