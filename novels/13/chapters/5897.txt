Chapter 5897: Couldn’t Let Go Before

“If they’re not, then where did the nine treasures come from?” Li Qiye nodded.

“I see.” The founder murmured. He had controlled Elder Galaxy before and had insight into the treasure’s unfathomable size.

He and the other lords couldn’t fully grasp its true power. He didn’t believe anyone could do so.

What about the nine words, the source of these treasures? What kind of power would come from wielding one? He didn’t dare to imagine this for it was above his station.

“It was like this when I first visited.” He said.

They didn’t create this space for it was here from the start.

“It was like this long, long ago, even before the start of Trinity Epoch.” Li Qiye responded.

“Did they ever appear in our world?” He couldn’t but ask.

“Not now, maybe long ago before time immemorial.” Li Qiye said. [1]

“Where are they now?” He asked.

“That’s an interesting question. Where is the safest place?” Li Qiye smiled.

“The safest place?” He blurted in response: “What are they afraid of?”

In his opinion, nothing was stronger than the nine treasures, let alone their sources.

Li Qiye chuckled and pointed above.

“The high heaven...” This gave the founder the answer.

This applied to everyone, ranging from Epoch’s End to Trinity Ancestor. Therefore, it made sense that the nine words would be afraid of the high heaven as well.

He truly wanted to go take a look at what kind of existence this high heaven was.

“Let’s go, no traces here.” Li Qiye had scanned the area several times only to find nothing.

After they left the dimension, he asked the founder: “Got any plan?”

“I await your decision.” The founder got on his knees.

“As I said, I have no judgment over you, do as you please.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Sacred Teacher, I no longer have a place to be.” The founder lamented with a wry smile.

During those long years, he struggled and tried his best to preserve a little spark for the world amidst the ravenous overlords. Now, everything had changed and he didn’t know what to do.

“Everyone has their path. That’s an answer only you can seek.” Li Qiye smiled and left, leaving the old man standing there in a daze.

He visited another area in Celestial Court to see World Emperor.

“I’m thinking about retiring.” World told him.

“You have toiled for so long and have paid enough.” Li Qiye didn’t find this surprising and said.

“Right, I’m a bit weary.” World said: “Celestial Court has been around for so long, maybe it doesn’t need to exist anymore.”

“It’s just a name, only Elder Galaxy will exist in perpetuity.” Li Qiye smiled.

World agreed with this. Disbanding Celestial Court didn’t mean much because Elder Galaxy would still be around. Who would be in charge of this heavenly treasure? Another would create a new faction, a second and third Celestial Court...

“Maybe find a successor.” Li Qiye suggested.

“Where? It’s Elder Galaxy we’re talking about, not just anyone can control it.” World shook his head first before adding: “Perhaps you should take it.”

“No, my mission is complete so it belongs to you all and the living beings. I must not interfere any longer.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You’re leaving forever this time?” World stared at Li Qiye for a moment before letting out a sigh.

“Yes, the path here has been walked, I must depart.” Li Qiye gazed at the horizon and smiled heartily.

“You’re finally letting go.” World murmured. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Li Qiye had never rested during times of peace or turmoil. He traveled from the nine worlds to the thirteen continents and back to the nine worlds, repeating the journey numerous times. This couldn’t have been pleasant.

“I can say that I’m just a passerby now without it being a lie.” Li Qiye said sentimentally.

“You became one after returning from Heavenrealm, you didn’t have to.” World said.

“I couldn’t let go back then since there were too many memories there, I had to do something.” Li Qiye showed several emotions as he recalled the past - a hint of melancholy but also a sense of freedom.

“Right, you wanted to protect.” World said.

“I don’t want to wear the hat of a savior for that is too heavy, no one can bear that burden. The weight crushes the wearer and the world itself.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“But you've done just that.” World said earnestly.

“Not to save the world, only to perfect my dao heart.” Li Qiye smiled.

World sighed and asked again: “You’re really not coming back?”

“Yes, I’ve said goodbyes too many times.” Li Qiye calmly gazed at the outside world and answered firmly.

“I see.” World could tell that Li Qiye had finally let go of the epoch.

During his previous expedition, he was still unwilling to let go due to the unforgettable memories but most importantly, the looming threats.

Now, he was calm while gazing at it one last time, no longer experiencing negative emotions. He finally turned into a true passerby, not wanting to linger for much longer.
