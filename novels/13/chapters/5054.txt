Chapter 5055: My Turn Now?

It didn’t take long before only two true masters were left on the other side - Bloodfly and Golden Mosquito.

“Kill him!” Golden Mosquito ordered since he was occupied with the divine tablet.

Bloodfly naturally wanted to kill Li Qiye. The problem was - how? Slamming his head into the guy?

He was certainly stronger than the other dragon lords but his opponent easily killed them. He had zero confidence and thought that this was suicidal.

He thought about running but this wasn't possible either. First, he couldn’t get out of Demon and second, his founder god would be the first to kill him.

“Take him down!” Nightwalker, Lunar Rabbit, and Chillglare Hawk took advantage of this and lunged for Golden Mosquito.

“Clank!” Nightwalker activated his supreme sword dao, manifesting it into a great Buddha raising a blade. The myriad dao fused into this blade along with the blessing of sacred monks. Buddha was furious today and the slash was ready to devour gods and devils.

Lunar Rabbit let out a deafening roar despite her tiny frame, sending out countless ice needles capable of freezing the stars above. Chillglare Hawk chose to use his inconceivably sharp claws.

“Boom!” Runes appeared all over Golden Mosquito’s body. The power of worship engulfed him and added a layer of golden armor. The attacks failed to deliver the smallest injury.

The trio took a deep breath after seeing this. The demons and cultivators who were still awake couldn’t believe it because the attack came from three commanding gods.

Of course, this was partly due to them being weakened by Dream Monarch and Vine God’s negative effects. Furthermore, they could only borrow the power of the deity branches, not actually wield it.

Nonetheless, they didn’t give up and continued their assault.

On the other side, Bloodfly staggered backward instead of following orders.

“You want to run too?” Li Qiye said with a smile.

This was obvious to everyone but Bloodfly didn’t have this freedom. Not to mention being unable to leave Demon, Li Qiye didn’t spare anyone who tried to run.

“Screw it!” Bloodfly shouted and revealed his true form - a gigantic, grotesque fly.

Unlike a regular fly, he had the shade of blood. His body bloated as if it was filled with the blood of his countless victims.

A sticky liquid of the same color dripped from his body and burned large holes in the ground.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He opened his mouth and spewed out a rain of this liquid, wanting to drown Li Qiye. It melted the peaks nearby into corrosive acid as well to the horror of the spectators. This was all he needed to destroy a sect - just utilizing this corrosive force.

Some wondered if Li Qiye could actually survive but they got their answer once the liquid flowed down into the craters in the ground - Li Qiye being perfectly fine.

He patted his shoulder and said: “My turn now?”

Bloodfly let out a strange song before summoning a thorny cudgel. It had lightning flashes, only red instead of white.

The power of worship empowered him and made him even larger. He smashed the thorny cudgel downward and actually struck Li Qiye.

“Bam!” The latter took it without any problem and then broke Bloodfly’s legs that were holding the weapon.

The evil god bellowed in pain as blood gushed out. His face twisted in agony as he finally made the decision to run. His wing flaps created devastating gales as he run for his life.

At the same time, Golden Mosquito finally managed to suppress the divine tablet and make it disappear. He released his divine power and sent the trio flying, injured.

“Buzz.” His speed exceeded reality. Even his opponents had no idea where he went.

“Ahhh!” Next came a heartwrenching scream.

People finally saw Golden Mosquito again who was now drilling his needle into Bloodfly’s body.
