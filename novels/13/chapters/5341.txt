“Dao Brother, have you always advocated coexistence?” The old servant told Hallowed.

“Yes, I agreed with All-things’ proposal back then. Fortunately, Puresun Dao Lord stepped in and ended the conflict so I went to live a simple life.” Hallowed said.

He was once a pillar of The People and had joined Dao Alliance, agreeing with harmony and peace. He knew that there was no point in fighting wars against The Race.

Even if Illumination had managed to wipe out The Race from the upper two continents, what about the lower continents and the immortal continent?

There were immensely powerful cultivators in the latter, meaning the destruction would be out of control. There was no guarantee they would be the victors but one thing was for certain - mortals would definitely be massacred.

The subsequent Pact of Blessed allowed Hallowed to step back and open a noodle shop to live in peace.

“That’s why Supreme started with you, he’s no different from Illumination. Since you had advocated peace, killing you will infuriate the conquerors and dao lords of The People. They will retaliate by attacking Heaven Alliance and breaking the pact. With that, Supreme would have the perfect clarion call.” Timewatcher said.

“Well, I’m still alive.” Hallowed said.

“Supreme doesn’t participate in battles that he isn’t confident in winning.” The old servant said.

Timewatcher and Hallowed had great respect for the old servant so they took his opinion rather seriously.

“Hmm, what does he have up his sleeve?” Timewatcher wondered.

Unfortunately, due to the old servant’s special identity, he didn’t elaborate despite not being on Supreme’s side.

“Could be a plan with Divine Alliance.” Timewatched continued.

“Heaven and Divine shall join while The People are still suffering from internal strife.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Is The People prepared for an actual war? Otherwise, they’ll lose during the apex skirmishes.” Li Zhitian commented.

“Right, it is still the battles between the apex cultivators that will decide the outcome.” Hallowed agreed.

“The Race has Supreme, Swordsea Dao Lord, Eternal Conqueror, Immortal Pagoda Conqueror, Principle Conqueror. How will The People stop them?” Zhitian asked while staring at the old servant.

Timewatcher mused for a bit and answered: “The People has All-things, Sword Queen, Darkfrost.”

“Not enough.” Hallowed shook his head.

“And Calamity Dao Lord?” Zhitian asked.

“Calamity is not here.” The old servant said.

“Without Calamity Dao Lord’s ultimate defense, no one will be able to stop Immortal Pagoda Conqueror’s primordial dao fruit. Seems like an unfair match.” Zhitian commented.

“The People needs to deal with their internal conflicts as soon as possible before worrying about external enemies.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Right, and I’m certain that war is only a matter of time.” Hallowed sighed in response.

“How about Azure Ancestor and Dhyana Dao Lord?” Zhitian asked curiously.

“They will not participate in the future war since they deem it as foolish.” Hallowed shook his head.

“For apex cultivators, we still have Coldflame Conqueror, Immensity Conqueror, and Apricot Dao Lord. We have to recruit them.” Timewatcher said.

“Coldflame won’t be participating.” The old servant said confidently, surprising Timewatcher and Hallowed.

“Hmm, then just those other two.” Timewatcher said.

“Apricot Dao Lord won’t show up either since she has been reclusive since the injury rumors.” Hallowed said.

“Immensity Conqueror is the last one then. If you all have to make a bet, which side will he be on?” Timewatcher said.

“Sir, which side are you on?” Hallowed suddenly asked Li Qiye.

Everyone became startled since they didn’t dare to ask Li Qiye before. They all knew that if Li Qiye were to participate in the upcoming war, he would change the entire balance.

“Not interested.” Li Qiye shook his head: “The whole distinction between The People and The Race is ridiculous. The Race has humans and The People has heaveners. Have the three great races never protected this world or harbored weaker humans and demons before?”

“Yes, the Qian and the War Monarch stood on our side against Celestial Court during Epoch Immemorial War.” Hallowed agreed.

“This foolishness stems from confusion. Who started the distinction?” Li Qiye said.

The group exchanged glances and the old servant answered: “Celestial Court.”

“There we go. Now, without destroying Celestial Court, you all will never have peace.” Li Qiye said.

Everyone became emotional, especially Li Zhitian.

Heaven Alliance was a part of Celestial Court. Moreover, destroying Celestial Court was akin to destroying the very foundation of The Race.

“Heaveners, humans, whatever, all are inhabitants of this world. Racist prejudices became extreme due to Celestial Court, the so-called protectors are actually the source of disasters.” Li Qiye said: “Of course, there are more to it behind the scene.”

“We should gather all apex cultivators to destroy Celestial Court. Count me in this time.” Timewatched laughed.

They knew that Li Qiye was right - Celestial Court was the starter of the racial conflict ever since Epoch Immemorial War.

Heaven Alliance might be under the order of Celestial Court in this attempt to break the pact. Illumination Conqueror was merely fanning the flames.

“In order for The People and The Race to live in harmony, we must first eliminate Illumination then Supreme. We change the leader of Heaven and Principle should be in charge of Divine again. Next, we have to reinstate the Pact of Blessed.” Timewatcher concluded.
