Chapter 3755: Just A Minor Art

The young ones from the holy ground felt suffocated as if an invisible hand was grabbing their throat.

Chi Xiaoyue’s defeat would be another heavy blow to the academy. They stared at her, aware that the reputation and dignity of the holy ground relied on her.

“The seven chapters are indeed special, I’m afraid I don’t have a solution.” Chi Xiaoyue took a deep breath and said solemnly.

The audience felt their heart sinking downward. Is she going to accept defeat? They would never be able to stare a member of Righteous Sect in the eyes afterward.

“It’s not your fault, Miss Xiaoyue.” Liu Huaishi nodded: “For millions of years now, no one has been able to solve these seven chapters. It is understandable...”

Though Liu Huaishi’s tone was polite and he didn’t try to mock the holy ground, the other side still found it unbearable.

“It’s not difficult to solve it, just an incomplete chapter of a heavenly scripture, there’s no deep profundity to speak of.” A leisure voice suddenly interrupted him. [1]

The casual and indifferent tone froze everyone.

Evil Devourer Seven Chapters were derived by a dao lord from the Four Supreme Truths. The speaker’s assessment made it sound inadequate.

“Who is so bold to say this?” Many felt this way.

No one has been successful in solving the seven chapters. Only the top geniuses and masters in history bothered to attempt.

The wise sages have all failed yet this person viewed the topic with such frivolity?

They followed the voice and noticed that it was none other than Li Qiye who was fishing by the creek.

His head was still lowered and hidden by the hat. If he wasn’t the speaker, people would have thought that he was sleeping.

They forgot about him since he didn’t utter a single word from start to finish. Now, his arrogance got everyone’s attention.

“It’s Li Qiye.” Those who have witnessed him in action before thought that they have grown used to his style. Alas, this time still surprised them.

Dugu Lan and the others stared at him. Chi Xiaoyue, in particular, became excited.

“Can he actually break the seven chapters?” A believer of his still remained skeptical due to the historical precedence.

The greatest geniuses have failed. How could a junior like Li Qiye do so?

“Hey, it’s possible. Li Qiye even understood Sword Point from Sword Emperor? No one has done so in history, right?” A student from Duality said.

“But you’re forgetting that Sword Point is just a casual move left behind by Sword Emperor. The seven chapters are from a heavenly scripture. After its derivation from Righteous Dao Lord, it should be far stronger and more profound than Sword Point. Understanding Sword Point doesn’t mean that he can break the seven chapters. The difficulty must be several hundred times greater.” A doubter stated.

“Yes, easier said than done.” Discussions with conflicting viewpoints sprung up everywhere.

“Young Master Li, you believe you can break our seven chapters?” Liu Huaishi’s eyes were heated as he stared at Li Qiye.

“It’s just an incomplete chapter, there’s no difficulty to speak of.” Li Qiye didn’t move at all while responding.

“Young Master Li, though I will be overestimating myself, I am eager to try after listening to you. May we spare?” Liu Huaishi said.

“I don’t need to do it myself over one minor art.” Li Qiye casually responded.

Liu Huaishi and everyone else became speechless. The seven chapters were just a minor art?

Even invincible dao lords wouldn’t dare to make this claim. Li Qiye’s arrogance couldn’t be described with words.

“This isn’t a joke, mind your words.” Hu Ben glared at him.

The other spectators thought that Li Qiye was exaggerating as well.

“This matters pertains to the reputation of our holy ground. It’s more crucial than anything else. If he can’t back up his claim, Righteous Sect will mock us for a million years.” One youth murmured.

“Please watch your words in order to not besmirch the holy ground’s reputation. The Evil Devourer Seven Chapters aren’t that easy to defeat.” Another easily-stimulated genius told Li Qiye.

“Right, now’s not the time to be flippant and careless.” Another chimed in.

“If you can’t back up your words, you’ll become a sinner of the holy ground for harming its reputation.” One expert snorted.

In fact, many had faith in Li Qiye. It’s just that his comment was too extreme and left no room for failure. This exacerbated the severity of the situation. He would lose both his and the holy ground’s reputation.

Li Qiye turned a deaf ear to the criticism and continued fishing.

“You’re displaying absolute confidence, Young Master Li.” Liu Huaishi took a deep breath, doing a great job at maintaining civility.

The seven chapters were the ultimate arts of Righteous. Many people took pride in being able to learn it. Liu Huaishi’s Force Devourer was his best merit law and a reason for pride.

Others would be livid after hearing Li Qiye disparaging their prized art.

Nonetheless, he stayed calm and didn’t think that Li Qiye would actually be able to do so.

“If you don’t personally do it, how will you break our arts?” He elaborated.

Though he was an enemy, the members of the holy ground nodded in agreement.

“Yes, claiming to be able to break it without doing it himself? That’s a little absurd.” One genius said.

“It’s beyond the point of taking back now. How humiliating will it be for the holy ground if he can’t do it?” Another scowled.

1. If Li Qiye says this, then it’s most likely an official heavenly scripture and new ones do exist
