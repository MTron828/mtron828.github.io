Chapter 5322: Unrequited Love

Crossing through the frozen layer led them to a dark expanse. The group could tell that the black water resembled the black liquid oozing from Heaven’s Allure’s statues, albeit at a diluted amount.

“Where is this place?” Zhitian looked around and asked.

Everyone outside Li Qiye felt uncomfortable being here despite their firm dao heart. Few things in the world could affect their emotional state.

The black tides here resembled the embodiment of darkness or an existence that shouldn’t be allowed to exist.

“It’s here, the birthplace.” Li Qiye remarked.

“For the primal darkness, right?” Zhitian felt afraid, thinking that a creature had been boiled here for countless times before being reduced to the black liquid. From this liquid came an entirely new existence.

Li Qiye didn’t answer and stood in silence for a long while before stepping into the black tides.

The group followed behind him and focused up to prevent anything malicious from entering them.

They traveled through the ominous expanse and reached the end - a pond with a thicker concentration of the black liquid than anywhere else.

They immediately recalled the liquid oozing out of the statues - now this was the right concentration.

Sure enough, there was another statue of Heaven’s Allure inside the pond.

“Another?” Zhitian murmured, feeling that this might have been going on for a long time now.

The third statue had a different pose and expression while maintaining the same animated charm.

“Perhaps the one behind this is rather close to Heaven’s Allure.” The old servant remarked.

“Close or not, it is certain that this person had been together with Heaven’s Allure, hence the familiarity with her demeanors and gestures. Otherwise, it would be impossible to create these life-like statues.” Li Qiye said.

“A suitor, maybe?” Zhitian asked.

“That’s a high probability, a conqueror or dao lord as well.” Li Qiye smiled.

Zhitian turned and stared at the old servant who shook his head: “There are too many suitors.”

“Let’s see how this is going.” Li Qiye raised his hand.

It pulsed with a dao light in order to derive the events of the statue. The same thing happened - more thick liquid seeping out of the statue.

Suddenly, it started moving unpredictably. This didn’t happen in the prior cases.

“Protect your mind and dao heart.” Li Qiye shouted.

The group shuddered before removing all unnecessary thoughts and becoming saints unstained by external forces.

The black liquid gathered together and slowly turned into the shape of a woman. Despite its gross exterior, one smile could still rob others of their sanity and freedom.

“Heaven’s Allure!” Zhitian remained composed since he was well prepared for this. Otherwise, his heart would have started to beat rapidly.

The woman didn’t last long and suddenly splashed down to the ground again, unable to maintain her shape.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Seems like they found and even imitated it.” Li Qiye said.

“So it’s going well?” Zhitian asked.

“Yes, it appears so.” Li Qiye nodded.

There was no doubt that the primal darkness has been hiding in Evil Reborn. A certain top cultivator knew about its existence and wanted to charm it for an unknown reason.

“To satisfy his perversion.” Li Qiye had a good idea but still needed more confirmation.

“How so?” Zhitian asked.

“This guy is in love with Heaven’s Allure but can’t have her. He wants a substitute.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So he is attempting to lure the primal darkness and turn it into Heaven’s Allure? He’ll treat it as his woman afterward?” Zhitian shuddered: “Perverted indeed.”

“An unrequited love.” The old servant said.

Zhitian was filled with curiosity and wanted to meet the famous Heaven’s Allure in person.

The old servant could tell and said: “It’s best not to be curious but if you somehow get the chance, protect your mind with all of your power. Otherwise, just one misstep and you’ll fall into the abyss.”

“What a dreadful beauty, so destructive.” Zhitian murmured.
