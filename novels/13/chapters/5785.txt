Chapter 5786: Initiate

“Long time no see, everyone.” Jiao Heng smiled at the crowd first.

His charismatic smile captivated friends and foes alike, leaving them unable to hate him.

“Fellow Daoists, you need not trouble yourselves with this toy. Let me have some fun first.” He told Light-dragon’s group.

They exchanged glances, not knowing what to say. A grand-completion paragon artifact to be used as the key to victory was a “toy”?

“Please go ahead.” Light-dragon conceded. What else could he do? Argue with Jiao Heng?

Although Jiao Heng had helped them and chose to stay at Celestial Court, he had never fought on their side, experiencing life and death and becoming brothers on the battlefield.

Moreover, he had no responsibilities or ties with Celestial Court either. He was a free man who could come and go as he pleased; none could command him.

Light-dragon and the others thought he might randomly switch sides one day. Therefore, they only viewed him as a guest, not one of them.

If Light-dragon were to refuse Jiao Heng’s request, who knows what he would do?

“I’ll be going then.” Jiao Heng smiled again and entered the world within the mech before anyone could react.

This mech was a whole piece, looking impenetrable. Just leaving a scar on the hull seemed impossible.

However, Jiao Heng somehow made it inside its chest as if the metallic hull was liquid. Ripples pulsed outward during the entry.

“Nice.” He sat and laughed joyously like a child coming across a super fun toy.

“Initiate!” He didn’t forget to tell the crowd how much fun he was having.

“Boom!” He channeled his power into Three Thousand World Mech.

The mech lit up and issued loud detonations during the channeling. Unlike the previous machines needing to enter a special state to release energy vectors, this one needed zero preparation.

Each part of its metallic frame could release light and vector, not needing emission ports or conditions. Everything could be released at will.

He successfully activated the mech, unleashing an overwhelming might and momentum. Weaker emperors and dragon lords couldn’t handle the shockwaves and were blasted away.

“Rumble!” A total of three thousand divine rings appeared, each representing a world.

Its aura alone froze spectators, leaving them thinking about its actual battle prowess. The locks of hair to the back started rising. They looked like massive black galaxies capable of untold destruction.

The endless expanse of Celestial Court became unstable due to the sudden appearance of an epoch-level power. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Emperors were mighty enough to look down on the rest of the world. Alas, this was the combined might of three thousand worlds. They felt as if the mech could crush them to pieces or reduce them to bloody mist with one stomp.

“Yes, this will be fun.” Jiao Heng somehow grasped the mech’s mysteries and could control it in an instant.

“That’s Jiao Heng for you.” Light-dragon couldn’t help but praise.

Leaving his immense comprehension aside, he had the power to control the mech as well. It required more than a single apex cultivator to do so, perhaps their entire group - hence their decision to go together.
