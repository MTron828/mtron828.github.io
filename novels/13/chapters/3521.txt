Chapter 3522: Draconic Celestial Wall

The five ancestors didn’t know what to do because Li Qiye exceeded all expectations.

“My turn.” Li Qiye casually declared; each word struck everyone’s heart like a hammer, enough to make people’s legs go weak and destroy their morale.

This next move would naturally be earth-shattering so the five became aghast as a result.

“Let’s go!” They hurriedly regained their wits and took action with haste.

Blaze Blade Heavenly Sovereign was the first and raised both hands, activating his sword dao. Sword energies filled the realms along with metallic clankings.

Swords manifested into reality and formed an endless wall with supreme chains made of fire wrapped around them, serving to bolster the wall. It was large enough to connect the earth and the sky, separating Li Qiye in the process.

A great power could use their full force for ten thousand years and still wouldn’t be able to break this wall down.

However, this was far from enough for the five. They needed something tougher to stop him.

“Go!” Golden Sun Ancient Ancestor poured down numerous dead stars to block behind the walls, using their weight as another augmentation.

“Seal!” Silver Moon Ancient Ancestor joined in and sent down silver liquid on the wall and the stars. A complete infusion of the silver affinity created a mightier wall spanning across the world.

People couldn’t help but gasp before its colossal size. No one should be able to get through it.

“Raa!” Azure Dragon Ancient King was next. He opened his mouth and spewed out draconic talismans and added them to the wall. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Boom!” The thing became filled with power and life. There seemed to be countless dragons within them now. Their draconic power was majestic and empowered the wall.

“Myriad Sun Cycle.” Golden Sun Ancient Ancestor then summoned numerous suns and imprinted them into the draconic wall. These fiery suns rotated inside the wall and spewed out endless solar trueflame, adding one more layer of defense.

They have done everything possible while mustering their greatest abilities, going as far as separating the dimensions - all this for the sake of stopping Li Qiye’s attack.

“Draconic Celestial Wall...” Someone named this line of defense.

The spectators were shocked because this might be the most magnificent defense they have ever seen.

“If Li Qiye can’t take it down and the wall remains, the north will always be separated into two halves.” Another said.

This was indeed the case. No one else had the power to cross through the wall if Li Qiye were to fail.

At this point, the five ancestors poured all of their vitality and power into it, hoping that it would be enough. Alas, this was only a sliver of hope since they weren’t confident in the slightest.

Moreover, this action of theirs made it apparent that they thought that they were inferior to him in direct combat.

“A bit interesting. Let’s see how long it’ll last.” Li Qiye smiled and slowly raised his hand.

Everyone watched with bated breath even though he didn’t seem to be putting any force behind it. Nonetheless, the entire world was being lifted up with his hand.

“Buzz.” The worlds rotated, the gods prostrated, and the supreme devil king lowered his head. Li Qiye gathered the power of all of them into his finger.

A tiny glimmer flashed around his fingertip. Nonetheless, everyone became horrified because it might be able to destroy the world itself.

“Boom!” The glimmer turned into a shooting beam, extinguishing all in its path. The world shook violently, on the verge of crumbling down.

After a loud explosion, one could see a hole on the wall with cracks emanating from it.

“Repair!” The five immediately channeled energy into that spot.

“Zzz...” The silver liquid, golden sun, draconic runes, and sword dao crazily repaired the cracks and hole on the wall. The damages were fixed at a rapid rate.

However, the beam didn’t stop and continued the onslaught.

“Rumble!” The wall shook violently, still at extreme risk.

“We need to hold on!” The dragon king roared and channeled everything he got into the wall.

He didn’t need to say so because the rest was doing the same already.
