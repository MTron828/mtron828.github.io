Chapter 4954: Only When It’s Too Late

After Ming Shi shocked the crowd with her generous gift, Jian Yunyun and Goldcrest Young Noble also presented theirs.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yunyun gave a special weapon from The Alliance while Goldcrest took out a beast badge. This was a top treasure from Demon enveloped in demonic energy.

In reality, their treasures weren’t bad at all. Many students in Abroad would never be able to find something similar despite trying for a lifetime.

After all, there was a considerable difference between geniuses from prestigious sects versus vagrant cultivators. It’s just that the princess’ gift overshadowed everything else.

Nonetheless, they still wanted to show their gratitude to the academy. Not all students had the same thought.

With that finished, Li Qiye turned his attention toward Heaven Suppression Shawl and walked closer.

“What are you doing?” Swordgrasp became aggressive because the shawl was his goal.

He has been trying to understand it for a long time now and no one else dared to get close.

“Got a problem? The treasures of the academy are available for the fateful, it is not yours.” Princess Ming Shi said.

Swordgrasp had no response. This wasn’t because he was afraid of her but rather, logic was on her side. Moreover, she had the moral high ground after giving away a supreme treasure.

Other students currently felt inferior and shameful since they couldn’t repay the academy in the same manner.

Li Qiye crouched down and gently touch the shawl before letting out a sigh, looking slightly sentimental.

“This is a supreme treasure left behind by Nightmoon Conqueror, perfect for both offense and defense. Is this what you want, Young Noble?” Jian Yunyun said softly.

Li Qiye smiled and shook his head, having no intention of taking it away. He then scanned the area and started walking again.

Students kept a distance from him, going as far as making a path in his way. An outsider would think that they were afraid of him but they merely perceived him as a harbinger of bad luck and kept their distance, fearing he might utter something foolish.

He didn’t pay attention to most but eventually stopped in front of Skyquake Dao Controller.

“This is another famous treasure.” Ming Shi introduced: “Rumor has it that it was taken from the pawnshop just like my lantern.”

“It’s a good one.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement.

“I was here first.” Radiant Young Monarch uttered coldly, afraid of others wanting the artifact on top of despising Li Qiye’s attitude. Other students knew to stay away but not this guy.

“Shouldn’t you be getting ready to apologize and admit faults?” Li Qiye glanced at him and said.

The young monarch turned red, speechless. They had indeed made a bet back in the pawnshop and he had lost. This was put aside due to Bai Shaojin suddenly revealing Benevolence.

Many students were witnesses so he couldn’t play dumb regarding this matter. If he were to renege, his reputation would reach rock bottom. A dragon lord was a bright star whose words carried immense weight. Lying was unacceptable.

On the other hand, apologizing to Li Qiye was even more unbearable given his mighty status. Doing so had the same result, leaving him in a tough position.

“That was just a coincidence, don’t take it seriously.” Swordgrasp helped him out.

“Please, a loss is a loss. Don’t humiliate Deity any further with this nonsense.” Ming Shi retorted.

“I do not believe in this fortune-stealing nonsense and blame the whole thing on our bad luck.” Halo said with a smile, attributing their loss to anything but Li Qiye.

“I see, how embarrassing.” The princess said with disdain.

The young monarch had a hard time dealing with all the gazes. He eventually got enough and shouted: “I don’t buy it, he can’t steal anyone’s fortune!”

He chose to escalate the issue instead of just taking it easy the way his allies had helped him.

“Sounds like someone wants to get their luck stolen again.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Do it again then, there is no such thing as luck stealing.” Halo sneered.

“That’s right, we still don’t buy it.” Swordgrasp said fiercely.

These two hoped to get on the young monarch’s good side since it would be rather beneficial in the future.

“Show us one more time and we’ll be completely convinced.” The young monarch said, wanting to use this as a way to not apologize.

“Show us your ability.” Swordgrasp added.

“I concur.” Halo joined in.

This attracted everyone’s interest so they stared at Li Qiye, awaiting a response.

“This might show us whether Li Qiye is a harbinger of bad luck or not.” One student said.

“Again, again!” Some started shouting.

The atmosphere became rambunctious in no time at all.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t say anything.

“Yes or no?” The young monarch pressed the issue.

“We’re betting again.” Swordgrasp said.

“Let’s go big this time.” Halo said.

“Such incurable idiocy in full display. It looks like you three will only cry after seeing the coffin.” Li Qiye finally answered.
