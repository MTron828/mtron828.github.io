Chapter 5703: As One

Numerous heavenly beams surged out of Celestial Court during the battle to empower the allied combatants. This particular one was brighter than the rest and seemingly had the image of Celestial Court itself.

Moreover, eagle-eyed cultivators could see the faint shadow of what could only be described as an immortal amidst the beam.

“You see that?!” Spectators became emotional.

“One of the three immortals?” A powerful big shot speculated on the potential appearance of the legends.

“No, most likely only an intent.” Her friend disagreed.

The beam didn’t aim for anyone but directly flew into Immortal Dao City, wanting to cross through the boundless world inside.

“We’re going!” Luminous and West Bank leaped into the air and made it through the gap.

Luminous didn’t bother taking a second look at Momentous Star. Although it was unbeatable, it belonged to the frontier alone. Since he could only pick one, he decisively chose Immortal Dao City.

As for West Bank Prime Emperor, in the split second before entering the gap, he still took one glance back at Dao City. Perhaps this was the last time he would ever see it again.

“Scram!” Genesis shouted. All the runes on her body suddenly rushed outward in waves.

“Retreat!” War and the others have achieved their goal and retreated posthaste.

However, she wasn’t aiming at them but rather, the entire Dao Domain.

“Buzz.” The runes seemingly activated the hidden foundation of Dao City. Immortal light and runes oozed out of the ground and pushed back Celestial Court’s suppression.

“Rumble!” It only took a second before it started crushing this invasive force.

“Run, now!” Survivors in Dao Domain ran away, not wanting to be paralyzed again.

The runes also flew into Momentous Frontier, waking up its dao. Just like that, Momentous Frontier released a bright expanse again, breaking Immortal Ancient Seal and freeing the deities.

“Fuck!” Space Dragon Emperor cursed.

“Things went so wrong.” Immortal Emperor Di Yu and the others felt humiliated for falling into this trap - kindness repaid by treachery.

With Celestial Court’s suppression removed from Dao Domain, Genesis Conqueror retreated to the heavenly treasure instead of pursuing the assailants.

“She’s strong.” Resolute retreated as well instead of attacking again.

The others gazed at Immortal Dao City and stopped.

“Dominant, true to her fame.” Resolute continued. He would have died without the blessing from Celestial Court, having his shield shattered numerous times.

“You did just as well, Brother.” His allies had nothing but admiration for his tenacity and martial potency.

He was virtually unkillable on the battlefield while under the empowered state. Anyone else would have been destroyed by Genesis Conqueror. It took immense willpower to be crushed and rebuilt that many times, blessing or not.

He resembled an ambitious metal ingot, ready to be melted and forged numerous times.

“I fortunately had capable allies. If everyone didn’t channel more power to me, she would have obliterated me.” Resolute said humbly.

Apex cultivators enjoyed special privileges and status in Celestial Court, gaining its blessing. This was especially true after the mysterious guest’s visit - the power of the heavenly treasure became unearthed and intensified.

Of course, there was a price for everything. They were now tied with Celestial Court, similarly to what Temporal Serum did for Luminous Conqueror. Removing this connection was difficult so their allegiance became fixed.

Resolute’s blessing couldn’t have lasted that long. However, Nine-wheel and the others channeled their blessing to him, allowing him to take the vanguard.

“We fight and die as one, no need to be polite.” Nine-wheel said. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There was no other option for them now, being fully tied to Celestial Court.

They stared at the city but Genesis Conqueror didn’t come out. Was she still acting as the guardian or did she travel deeper into the treasure?

“Fellow Daoist, please forgive us for our rudeness earlier.” War shouted and bowed his head.

The others did the same before commanding their armies to retreat. It didn’t take long before they left Dao City, not a single soldier lingered behind.

At first, the survivors were skeptical of this retreat.

“They’re really leaving?” Someone said.

Dao City was theirs for the taking yet they chose to abandon it.

“I don’t get it.” Everyone stood there in a daze.

The whole thing was like a dream. So many casualties and hurtful betrayals, leaving behind a changed city.
