Chapter 4688: Myriad Heavenly Sovereign

Wild Paragon’s position was blindingly bright, and so was his current achievement. He was so young yet he has reached the myriad milestone. Only the five conquerors could match this. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Given his talent, it is only a matter of time before he becomes a Supreme Sovereign, and then Immortal Sovereign.” A last-gen expert whispered.

“Immortal Sovereigns… they are unbeatable when there is no dao lord around.” An ancestor responded.

There weren’t that many Immortal Sovereigns in the entire world. Some were capable of competing against dao lords.

“Another Dao Sanqian then?” A third member joined in.

Dao Sanqian has lived for a long time and even taught several dao lords before. Getting on his level required immaculate talent and effort.

“He can do that.” Another said softly: “Remember, his talent is on the same level as the five conquerors. If Five-sun King becomes the next dao lord, the two can rule the world together.”

“Ruling the world together…” Listeners became emotional.

If Wild Paragon could reach the immortal level, he would definitely be equal to Dao Sanqian. Most importantly, Dao Sanqian was getting high in age. Therefore, he would certainly live longer and might overpass this great being.

“Peerless talent indeed.” The daoist said.

“Yes, he might actually become a second Dao Sanqian. If it wasn’t for Five-sun King, the east would have been his. I’m sure he can’t be that much weaker than the current Five-sun King.” Jian Ming said.

“True, working for Five-sun King doesn’t mean he’s inferior.” The daoist agreed.

Li Qiye stared at the youth from afar and nodded: “An exceptional talent. It is true that he is on the same level as the five conquerors.”

Back in Southern Desolace, the sect master of Dragon was also exceptionally talented and reached the myriad dao level.

Here, Wild Paragon did it at a far younger age. Calling him a supreme genius wasn’t unreasonable.

With the successful session, he recalled his energy and dao before descending from the peak.

“Congratulations regarding the myriad level, Paragon.” Many came over to celebrate.

Though he picked the sovereign path and couldn’t become a dao lord, some considered his future to be potentially brighter.

After all, any of the five conquerors might die in the competition; no one knew the final victor. As for Wild Paragon, he didn’t necessarily need to fight to the death. Therefore, his future survival rate exceeded that of the five conquerors.

In a sense, befriending or joining a conqueror was a huge gamble. The reward was certainly handsome in the case of success. Alas, to join a losing combatant? This meant throwing all of the investments away.

This wasn’t the case for Wild Paragon. If he were to become an Immortal Sovereign, that would be the same as climbing up the branch of a dao lord.

Therefore, geniuses, ancestors, and sect masters all came over to greet him. He simply nodded in response, looking both confident and prideful.

After all, he was qualified to be haughty given his talent and power. Most ancestors from regular sects were weaker than him.

“Only the five conquerors can hope to compete against you.” A genius flattered.

“I will pave the path for Brother Five-sun, flattening all obstacles.” He smiled brightly with all three heads, capable of seeing everything around him.

This powerful declaration made others become emotional. It seemed that he was determined to participate in the competition as well, going as far as being in the vanguard.

“Paragon, which conqueror will you challenge first?” Someone couldn’t help but ask.

True Immortal Young Emperor, Firmament Mortal King, Tian Feng, and Shen Juntian were the choices.

Most thought that he would challenge Firmament Mortal King first. After all, the young emperor of True Immortal was considered to be the strongest by many. Shen Juntian was also monstrous since he had his father’s dao lord weapon and he could use it to its full potential. This made it virtually impossible to beat him. As for Tian Feng, everyone was afraid of this madman. Provoking him had dire consequences.

Thus, Firmament Mortal King was the best choice, seemingly the most conspicuous out of the four.

“There is this guy named Li Qiye.” The paragon said: “Everyone says that he is sorcerous, a future rival. I wish to see what he can do.”

His six eyes scanned the region, seemingly viewing everyone as mere insects - Li Qiye included.

“Li Qiye?” The crowd exchanged glances. They were no strangers to Li Qiye’s devilish ability at this point. True Immortal had suffered numerous losses to him.

“Two of True Immortal’s prodigies lost to him recently.” A youth from the east reminded the paragon.

“Their six prodigies, with the exception of the young emperor, aren’t much.” The paragon smiled.

This made others take a deep breath. This comment certainly offended True Immortal. No one else dared to put down the prodigies.

“Paragon, so you’ll be challenging Li Qiye?” Another asked.

“If he wishes to stand in the way of Brother Five-sun, I will kill him.” The paragon stated.

“!” The crowd took a deep breath after hearing this.
