Chapter 5609: There Are Things Men Should And Shouldn’t Do

Li Qiye observed the chaotic space for a while before remarking: “We shall pull the net soon.”0

“It’ll be a comprehensive capture, the net is quite extensive.” The person said.0

“Extensive indeed, but it won’t be easy. Any mistake and some fish will slip away.” Li Qiye said.0

“Celestial Court is still a big issue. It’s so vast and mysterious, certainly beyond my ability.” The person said.0

“It’s understandable that it eludes you. The treasure has been in their possession for so long that they have figured out the proper steps to take.”8

“Right, many places are puzzles at this point, impossible to explore.” The person said.0

“You’re not the only one. If it were so easy, it wouldn’t have taken this long to build the net.” Li Qiye said.0

“The control improved drastically since the start of Immemorial Epoch War. I do not know who is in charge right now.” The person worried.0

“The visitor, only him.” Li Qiye smiled.0

“Logically speaking, that doesn’t make sense.” The person said.0

“Change your perspective and it’ll become clear.” Li Qiye smirked.0

“Well…” The person said with uncertainty: “Isn’t this highly unlikely?”0

“Why not? This isn’t Trinity anymore, it is my epoch. If you’re a visitor from a different realm, who would you come to find? Who is the true ruler of the epoch?” Li Qiye asked.0

“You.” The person said without hesitation.0

“But the visitor went to Celestial Court instead of me. Most importantly, think about how they managed to learn more about Celestial Court after the visitor’s arrival, more so than they ever did in the past due to certain limitations.” Li Qiye smiled.0

“In theory, the lord of Celestial Court should have access to these secrets. He had inherited the legacy.” The person said.0

“The one who had the legacy back then was Divine Ancestor.” Li Qiye said: “Although the lord created Celestial Court, that’s just the lineage, not the heavenly treasure.”0

“But Divine Ancestor is dead.” The person said.0

“Yes, and in a tragic manner. The ambushers included Primal Ancestor, Stonesplitter Patriarch, Lord of Derivation, and finally, Twilight Hunter.” Li Qiye nodded.2ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“It doesn’t make sense if this is right. Why mediate between the two parties?” The person said emotionally.0

“People have two sides.” Li Qiye said: “A supreme saint still has a dark side to them. If someone believes that they only have light within them, there is only one possibility - a fraud.”1

“The other side shouldn’t exist, right?” The person asked.1

“Not the right way to put it.” Li Qiye shook his head: “The side of the past gave birth to this era but whatever happened next, it happened above instead of here.” 0

“Now it has returned?” The person said.0

Li Qiye sighed and said: “This other side is what we call ‘fallen.’”10

“If that’s the case, wouldn’t the entire epoch fall as well?” The person took a deep breath, aware of the significance. No one knew what had happened in the past or what could happen in the future, but this world was once placed before a bloody maw.0

“Fortunately, it is my epoch now, not Trinity. This changes everything so they need to kill me before trying again.” Li Qiye smiled.0

“This requires time.” The person said.0

“Yes, more time after killing me because the time to feast wouldn’t be right. If it’s too early, who knows who will actually get to eat?” Li Qiye said.0

“Right, they won’t be able to devour the epoch alone if they want to kill you.” The person gained a better understanding of the situation.0

Li Qiye smiled while staring at the thing on the person’s back: “That’s why they have to learn how to share.”2

“Compromises with Voracious Leviathan and Epoch’s End. I see now.” The person murmured.0

“It’s a good thing.” Li Qiye remained optimistic: “Those who want to eat at the table should get there early instead of crouching in dark corners where no one can see.” 0

“And we’ll clear this table, once and for all.” The person couldn’t help but say.0

“We’ll need your help to get the guests seated.” Li Qiye patted the person’s shoulder and said sentimentally: “Don’t be careless or you’ll end up being a braised pork hock on the table.”0

“I have lived a borrowed life until now so I’m not afraid of becoming a meal. Plus, when that happens, it’ll be the right time for you to fish, Sir.” The person smiled.0

“I understand, but that wouldn’t sit well with me.” Li Qiye sighed in response.0

“There are things men should and shouldn’t do.” The person smiled: “I haven’t done much compared to you, Sir. Plus, everyone dies eventually, it’s just a matter of how.”0

“Either way.” Li Qiye patted his shoulder and nodded solemnly: “Just try your best to not become food.”0

“I know, I want to help you pull the net too.” The person smiled.3

“Right, a single man can’t handle a net this big.” Li Qiye said.0

The two of them laughed and understood each other’s intent without needing words.1

After leaving the mysterious location, Li Qiye rode Niu Fen in the direction of Imperial Field.1

“Can’t wait to see all those old friends, I wonder how South Emperor and the others are doing.” Niu Fen was ecstatic.7

He laughed and continued: “That brat was rather impressive back then, commanding the emperors to stop Celestial Court.”0

“Did your status suddenly shoot up? Calling people brat now.” Li Qiye patted his head playfully.1

“Hah, this is feigning strength in the presence of a tiger. That brat is nothing when you are around. In fact, he should feel honored that we’re visiting him.” Niu Fen said.0

“Doesn’t have a damn thing to do with you.” Li Qiye laughed.4

Niu Fen didn’t care and grinned before winking at Li Qiye: “Young Master, you’re going to meet them again, I’m sure the ladies have been waiting anxiously.”1

“Nonsense.” Li Qiye said.0

“Haha, I’m just speaking the truth.” Niu Fen mischievously continued: “The last time I visited, the ladies kept on asking about your return.”1

Li Qiye glared at him, prompting him to laugh and stop talking.0

“Those years must have been tough, surviving to this point was not easy.” Li Qiye said softly.0

Niu Fen felt heavy-hearted as well. He sighed and said: “That war was tougher than Immemorial Epoch, the empress’ group was extraordinary. Even though they borrowed the primordial power, the sheer amount was out of this world. No one else could have duplicated this feat.”0

“Right, the result of teamwork.” Li Qiye said.0

“True, Celestial Court’s members were on something then, crazy and wild, wanting to break through the barriers. Everyone fought back fiercely, that was a true display of brutality.” Niu Fen said.0

“Yes, just withstanding the onslaught of the visitor was amazing enough, let alone actually killing him, primordial tree or no tree.” Li Qiye gazed at the horizon.0

“I would have died within three to five moves. The empress and the others endured long enough until victory.” Niu Fen shuddered while recalling the past.
