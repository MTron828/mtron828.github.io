Chapter 5261: The Abyss Gazes Back

Although Suppression Conqueror’s armor suit was massive, it looked like a dwarf before Li Qiye’s new version.

Space loomed behind him but still appeared tiny due to its immense aura.

“Boom!” Suppression attacked without any hesitation, sending all the rays and beams of molten liquid against Li Qiye.

Despite their destructive potential, it looked like a child peeing - completely harmless to the larger giant.

It merely waved its hand and instantly dispelled the offense.

“Did you see that?” A crowd member couldn’t believe it.

Other ancestors felt the same way since they understood the might of the rays and molten jets. Thus, Li Qiye’s effortless defense left them speechless.

“Rumble!” They then saw Li Qiye reaching for Suppression Conqueror, successfully grasping him.

In just a few seconds, he pulled off numerous plates and then punched the guy flying. Suppression became bloodied with numerous broken bones, virtually deformed after just one punch.

Suppression roared and tried to channel more power from Redflood for the sake of assembling an even stronger and larger armor suit.

However, something there started dragging his dao fruits and dao laws deeper into Redflood.

“Shit!” He bellowed after noticing something akin to an invisible rope tied around him. He tried to break free but it was too late. All of his dao laws were embedded in Redflood and became chains.

“Clank!” This fully immobilized him.

“What is going on?!” Spectators didn’t expect this development. Instead of him borrowing the power of Redflood, something was chaining him.

Suppression tried to break free but it was impossible since he had connected too deeply with this realm.

“Whoosh!” The molten jets were no longer under his control and turned into a lava giant. It rushed over toward the conqueror and encapsulated him fully.

“Zzz…” Sizzling noises and smoke along with his agonizing screams could be heard as he was pulled into the other side.

Spectators watched with bated breath - the molten liquid seemed to be alive and was swallowing Suppression.

The liquid giant grew larger and resembled Li Qiye’s armor suit after the devouring process. The only difference was that it was still made from molten liquid instead of exquisite pieces.

“Buzz.” It became radiant with eleven eyes growing on its forehead.

“Dao fruits… they’re Suppression Conqueror’s dao fruits…” This horrified the crowd.

“A new entity… Eleven-eyed Giant…” Someone gave it a name.

“Still not what I’m waiting for.” Li Qiye inside the armor suit scanned deep into space and all the crevices. Alas, there was no reaction.

He prolonged this battle and allowed Suppression to connect with Redflood, hoping to see a ripple or a reaction for the sake of marking coordinates.

Nonetheless, the appearance of this large giant was outside of his expectation. Suppression had gazed into the abyss and was punished for his reckless endeavor.

“Rumble!” The molten liquid in all of Redflood condensed on the giant. Its rays became monstrous while it continued the extraction process.

This horrified all spectators in the upper continents.

“The legends are real, the broken realms have evil entities that will break out one day. This one looks unstoppable.” A top conqueror became aghast.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Perish.” Li Qiye’s eyes turned cold and activated his armor suit. The brightest rays shot out with enough power to pierce the high heaven.

“!!!” Everyone felt as if this was the end of the world.

“Boom!” The giant has yet to finish extracting the power from Redflood so its head was pierced by the rays. The eyes made from eleven dao fruits also exploded into ashes.

The molten giant fell down to the ocean of lava in Redflood, causing a devastating tsunami.
