Li Qiye’s appearance robbed the breath from the crowd. Many exchanged glances, already aware of the result even before it began. It would certainly end with blood and death.

Zhang Yue smiled wryly, aware of the same thing. He quietly retreated without trying to fight it.

Liu Menglong still found the gazes on him to be awfully strange. It was as if he was being pitied for some reason.

He was the chief protector of Three Truths and didn’t need sympathy nor pity. Moreover, he didn’t deserve any either, being powerful and prestigious.

“Who are you?! State your name!” He shouted at Li Qiye, annoyed.

In his opinion, this guy was only a regular disciple. What could he do?

“Aren’t you looking for me?” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re that Li Qiye!” He became surprised, having never seen Li Qiye before and only heard about him from the members of his sect.

The atmosphere changed ever since this guy came out. He noticed this but couldn’t really understand why.

“That’s my name.” Li Qiye lazily answered.

Menglong took a closer look at him while thinking that this brat was being too haughty. The guy looked down on everyone as if he was the lord of Divine Black.

How dare a regular disciple treat him with such disdain? He was on the same level as Zhang Yue.

On the other hand, the members of Divine Black didn’t have a problem with this at all. This seemed rather natural by this point.

“Perfect.” Menglong said: “That’ll save me some effort since you’re here. Be smart and follow me.”

“Follow you? To where?” Li Qiye’s smile grew thicker.

“To Three Truths. You urged someone else to kill our disciples so you must give us an acceptable explanation. Otherwise...” Menglong put on a tough expression.

“Otherwise what?” Li Qiye smiled as if this was a casual conversation, completely ignoring the threat.

“Otherwise, death!” Menglong’s eyes flashed with a murderous glint.

Zhang Yue watched this rampant aggression in silence while feeling sorry for the guy.

Anyone else declaring their intent to kill a member of Divine Black would meet retribution from Zhang Yue. However, he didn’t bother joining this mess.

Liu Menglong was the only one here who didn’t have a clue, the same with the ones from Three Truths.

“What are you looking at?!” He eventually lost control and shouted. Why would these disciples stare at him in this manner? This was driving him nuts.

“It’s not like I can’t go with you to Three Truths.” Li Qiye said: “However, I don’t know if your sect is prepared.”

“Prepared for what?” Menglong was surprised.

“What else but sect destruction? Blood will flow like rivers, bodies will pile up like mountains when I go there. Three Truths will be erased from this land.” Li Qiye replied.

Everyone from Three Truths immediately became livid because of the blatant provocation and disrespect.

“The gall!” Menglong calmed down and laughed: “You think you can destroy our sect?”

“Just a tiny one, as easy as pie.” Li Qiye said dismissively.

The ones from Three Truths had nothing but rage in their eyes, wanting to kill Li Qiye.

Their sect was one of the strongest in the northern West King. Now, this guy thought that he could easily destroy them?

Meanwhile, the disciples of Divine Black weren’t surprised at all. They didn’t think he was boasting either. Being domineering was just his style and they didn’t doubt his abilities.

“I see!” Menglong shouted: “Incredible, impressive even, so this is a disciple from Divine Black, huh? Today, I’ll teach you a lesson in your seniors’ stead.”

“I’m afraid you didn’t hear the message from the survivors. I said that I would kill all members of your sect when I see them. Don’t think about leaving this place alive.” Li Qiye smirked.

Many from Divine Black shuddered after seeing his smile for it was scarier than anything else.

Zhang Yue was helpless. He knew that this would happen but once Li Qiye said it, that’s final.

“Ignorant fool, I will cut off your limbs!” Menglong started walking towards Jade Bird with a furious expression.

“Boom!” Though the two were still far away, Menglong still reached for Li Qiye.

His palm dispersed the clouds; his fingers resembled five mountains. Li Qiye’s location became tiny in comparison.

Chaos true energy poured down from the palm, resulting in a suppressive force akin to being trapped beneath a mountain.

He was still a yin-yang cultivator, deserving of his reputation.

Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye and simply raised his finger. It crossed through the air, leaving an afterimage.

“Clank!” A sword hymn came from South Conch Peak before an actual slash.

“It’s coming...” The ones from Divine Black focused their gaze in order to see it clearly.

Alas, the sword slash from the peak was just too fast. Not even the elders got a good look.

“Pluff!”, “Ah!”

Menglong screamed before blood rained down. His right hand has been severed so blood gushed out. The pain left him pale.

He staggered backward and looked around in confusion. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Who?!!! Show yourself!” He shouted in fear, thinking that a sword user had just ambushed him.

“Big talk, little power.” Li Qiye shook his head: “A sneak-attack isn’t necessary to cut off your paw. I just need to lift one finger.”

“You!” Menglong nearly vomited blood from anger.

He still didn’t believe it, the same with his allies. They all looked around to find the assailant.

“Fine, let’s see it!” Menglong still didn’t believe it. How could a regular disciple cut off his hand?

“Boom!” He took out a dao basin. “Splash!” The waves inside surged outward.
