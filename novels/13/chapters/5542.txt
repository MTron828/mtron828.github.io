Chapter 5543: Time Is Merciless

The Qin of Heavensearch was located in Momentous Frontier as well. It was a sizable clan with several hundred members. Perhaps when considering the side branches, it had a thousand members or so.

They could be considered nobility in the mortal world. However, back during the days of the thirteen continents, Heavensearch Sect had a total of four Immortal Monarchs.

Its fame echoed across Pure Continent - a sect coveted by many from all over the world.

During its prime, it had millions and millions of disciples spreading across countless kingdoms and minor sects. The Qin was a pillar with great authority then.

The past was long gone now, the same for the clan’s golden days. In fact, they had no idea of their ancestors’ illustrious success, that their clan once stood on top of the world.

Now, they were regional lords in Momentous Frontier - not quite at the bottom of the totem pole but far from being comparable to the Guardian Clan. The majority of them were merchants and farmers. Only a few were capable martial artists.

This was nothing in the grand scheme of things. Even a weak cultivation sect suffering a drastic decline could easily exterminate them.

This all changed with the birth of Qin Baifeng. It has been so long since they had someone capable of cultivating successfully, and perhaps eras since their last dragon lord. This immensely boosted the clan’s status and prestige.

Normally, cultivators would not linger in Momentous Frontier due to its culture regarding cultivation. There were too many shackles for cultivators in this place.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Nonetheless, mortals here still looked up to cultivators with envy and respect. To have a cultivator as part of the clan was a great honor.

Their bloodline had changed drastically and became mortal-like, no longer suitable for cultivation. Nonetheless, everyone hoped that their children could somehow cultivate. As for their future, that was up to their fortune alone. Only the Guardian Clan had an ancestral guidance explicitly forbidding cultivation.

The moment Baifeng was shown to be capable of cultivation, she became the family's jewel. When she became a dragon lord, the clan master position was given to her.

She was no different from an immortal in their eyes. Thus, her return was a monumental event.

The entire clan mobilized for the reception ceremony. When the group arrived, they saw everyone down on their knees, welcoming the arrival of the immortal.

Eyes were filled with reverence as they stared at the marvelous cultivator. She possessed both a kingdom-toppling beauty and a transcending aura. They believed that she was the fairest in the world.

Baifeng was sentimental. Her clan members knew nothing about their glorious past but she did, being a dragon lord and being exposed to the legends.

Various emotions and sentiments sprung up in her heart after returning to the place where she had grown up. She had ascended to great heights and saw the wonders of the world. Thus, the respect of the small clan, in reality, was just normal.

“Normal” was the polite way of putting it. Another dragon lord would think nothing of this. This was akin to a mortal looking down on a bunch of ants.

Although she had strong sentiments about this place, this could disappear with time.

“Time is merciless.” She murmured as she knew that this was inevitable. Her birthplace was both familiar and distant.

“Yes.” Li Qiye understood what she was talking about and responded: “Time is merciless indeed, it won’t be long until you won’t return again.”

This was rather frank but she knew that it was the truth. Her attachment decreased with each subsequent visit.

At the start of her training, she missed home and her clan. Eventually, her parents and siblings would grow old. The familiar faces would no longer be here in due time.

Given her current realm, she might have to go into isolated training for ten thousand years and would recognize no one upon returning. At the very least, this wasn’t the case right now.

“Emotions wane for those who walk through time.” Li Qiye said: “This is inevitable for those aiming for the peak, a hurdle that must be crossed.”

“What’s next when there is no attachment left?” She couldn’t help but ask.

“One can guard their dao heart as long as there is some warmth left.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, the dao path is endless, one must warm themselves and not rely on the world to do so.” Niu Fen nodded.

He had lived for far longer than Qin Baifeng and had ample experience with this matter.

“If you cannot persevere, your dao heart will falter in the future. The dao path is longer than you can imagine, don’t take the good times for granted. Appreciate and cherish them, only then will you be able to walk forward.” Li Qiye said.

“Throughout the ages, overlords with a heart as tough as iron still fell into the darkness. The world could warm their heart no longer, neither did themselves.” Niu Fen said sentimentally.
