Chapter 5251: Speak With The Fist

“Rumble!” After Heaven’s Equal sealed the airspace above Li Qiye, the generals all appeared with the exception of Devil-vine who was sent to the horizon.

“They are changing their strategy.” A spectator commented.

“Will the gauntlet alone be enough to stop a combined attack from all of them?” Everyone became curious, the same for Suppression Conqueror who wanted to see the limit of the treasure.

Given his talent, he believed that it would only take time for him to understand the treasure. Moreover, through the gauntlet, he might be able to control the metal giants as well. His ultimate goal was to become a being comparable to epoch lords.

“Boom!” The general with the title of Black-tortoise turned into six suits of black armor to shield his allies. Now, they could attack without needing to worry about defense.

“Go!” Heaven’s Equal shouted and made his move first. The colorful spots on his feathers suddenly opened like eyes.

“Buzz.” Countless eyes fixated on Li Qiye and shot out colorful rays to trap Li Qiye. They had a mesmerizing effect that affected weaker audience members. Many fell to the ground, feeling as if their soul was leaving the body.

“Avian Soulstealer!” Many big shots became alarmed since countries have been destroyed by this technique.

“Hmph! Ha!” Hmph-ha General unleashed sonic waves at the trapped Li Qiye.

Twisted Shot also unleashed a barrage of white strings, looking more like a torrential wave than a barrage of arrows.

Treasure-fruit threw numerous fruits at the foe of various affinities - curses, devouring, poisonous, fire… Once they were flying in the air, they fused together before exploding by Li Qiye, wanting to reduce him down to blood.

Skyhorn’s attack came from underground. Countless blades protruded upward around Li Qiye.

“Boom!” The fabrics of space and time couldn’t contain their destruction.

“Can he survive this?” A spectator wondered, thinking that the gauntlet couldn’t guard against this many attacks at once.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, the rays from the gauntlet intensified and became blinding.

“Watch it!” Suppression Conqueror shouted in astonishment but it was too late. The rays swept through the palace and drowned the generals.

“Ahhh!” Black-tortoise General’s mighty defense proved useless and was obliterated. The defenseless generals burned like paper the moment the rays illuminated them.

As capable cultivators, they reacted in this split second and performed their strongest merit laws in order to stop the rays. Alas, it only took one moment for them to be reduced to ashes.

The piles of ashes were no longer distinguishable from one another and eventually got swept away by the wind coming from outside the main hall. One of them even had eleven sacred fruits but this didn’t matter.

Suppression became emotional after seeing the core of the gauntlet - the source of the rays. If he could obtain this core, he could craft it into a weapon perfect for his cultivation.

“Sir, you’re rather merciless.” He stood up and uttered coldly.

“Since you don’t seem to understand words, I have to use my fist.” Li Qiye answered with a smile.

The atmosphere became tense while everyone had their eyes on Li Qiye’s gauntlet. An eleven-fruit dragon lord stood no chance against it, what about an eleven-fruit conqueror?

Not long ago, challenging Suppression Conqueror would have been viewed as foolish arrogance. Now, the tides have turned and Suppression seemed to be the underdog.

In their eyes, he was now a prime candidate to test the power of the gauntlet.

“Can you also control the metal giants in the city?” He asked suddenly.

Everyone became interested in the answer with haste.
