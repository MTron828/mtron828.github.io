Chapter 4676: Indescribable

“Boom!” A gigantic fist emerged from the maelstrom. Its movement alone demanded prostration and submission.

“Shit…” The crowd was immediately suppressed by its frightening fist intent and became paralyzed.

“You know what’s going on?” Confusion struck the crowd.

The fist became increasingly materialized and physical, prompting everyone to gasp. It no longer looked like an amalgamation of fist intents but rather, an actual fist made of flesh and bones, pores and veins.

The fist intents in Worldbreaker were frightening but this took it to the next level. The fist overshadowed everything.

Those far outside of Worldbreaker felt it as well. Ancient ancestors in Eight Desolaces woke up after sensing this new power.

“Hmm?” An ancient ancestor woke up and looked around.

“Is Worldbreaker awakening?” A monstrous creature in Inner Ruins opened its eyes.

Deep in the void, an old existence woke up and commented: “Awakening is useless, the duck egg buyer had crushed it before, it is no longer the same.”

Back on the scene, the monarchs and ancient ancestors from the alliance took a deep breath.

No one had an idea where this fist came from. Some glanced at the area deeper into Worldbreaker.

There was a large fist that has been standing there for eras now. Most assumed that it was a mountain resembling a fist.

Now, this new one gave them a new perspective because it looked rather similar to the “mountain”.

“Don’t these fists look alike?” One expert commented. This opinion was shared by the mass.

“I think they look identical.” Someone else said.

“Perhaps there is more than one fist in Worldbreaker…” An old ancestor quietly speculated.

“Right, humans have two fists, what about demons or some other races?” An expert added.

“Are you telling me that Worldbreaker has more than one fist?” A big shot interjected.

“I heard that the duck egg dao lord crushed the power of that fist back then, will this new one be as strong?” The old ancestor responded.

Meanwhile, the suppressed crowd felt helpless like fish on a chopping board.

“What is this thing?” Even Five-sun King was aghast to see the fist.

“It’s here.” Li Qiye calmly stared at the fist.

Winds suddenly took over the sky. Strangely enough, the winds seemed to be blowing away the pressure and made everyone feel much better.

An expanse of chaos energy was the source of the winds. It poured down beams of energy connecting heaven and earth. Something massive was trying to enter this dimension from above.

“What is appearing?” Many cultivators thought that something peerless was emerging. They had a terrible feeling about this while not fully understanding the situation.

Some felt that this thing has existed since the start of time. It instilled an instinctive fear in all living beings.

“It’s time.” An invincible existence inside an abyss of Inner Ruins woke up to watch this scene.

“It’s a shame that I can’t go.” A slumber entity buried deep underground salivated.

A being that has been dead for millions of years sprung back to life. Of course, this was still only a corpse. It sat up and murmured: “Feasting on this… another three lives…”

“Everlastingness.” Someone on the verge of death in another forbidden zone said.

Alas, all of these beings decided to stay out of this matter.

“The thing is incredible but whoever gets it will die, how regrettable.” A peerless being found this hard to accept.

All of them coveted the item but they knew that this was forbidden. Acting recklessly and joining meant destruction in spite of their might.
