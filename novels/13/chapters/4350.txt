Chapter 4351: Casual Decision

“Peacock Monarch!” Someone recognized this voice.

“He wants to avenge his son.” An expert murmured.

This wasn’t surprising at all due to the horrific death of his son and the destruction of his divine intent. This was an unforgivable transgression.

Though the young lord wasn’t killed by Li Qiye and the same with the divine intent, everyone still thought that he was the primary reason for all of this since he dug a hole for the young lord to jump in.

This notion became apparent the moment Li Qiye used the five gates to kill the dark existence. It showed them that the young lord and the intent were nothing more than bait.

With all this considered, the monarch would never drop this issue. Otherwise, his reputation and face would be seriously damaged.

All eyes were on Li Qiye now, awaiting his reaction. The experts believed that his choice wouldn’t matter since all paths lead to death.

The upper echelons of the smaller sects swore to have nothing to do with Little Diamond after this. They wanted to return to their sect and warn their disciples.

After all, the monarch himself had gotten involved. This meant Little Diamond’s enemies included all of Dragon.

“Will he surrender or flee?” Someone wondered. The outcome would be the same for Li Qiye; it’s just Little Diamond’s fate that was in question.

“Seems like I need to make a trip to Dragon and teach you idiots a lesson in your ancestors’ stead.” Li Qiye stretched and said in a lackadaisical tone.

“What?!” Listeners couldn’t believe what they had just heard.

No one in the south would dare to oppose Dragon outside of Lion’s Roar, let alone teach them a lesson. Such arrogance could only be exhibited by a few sects in all of Sky Border.

“Hmph!” A thunderous scowl came from the horizon and hurt their eardrums. The monarch was obviously furious. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Dragon’s gate will be open and waiting for you!” His voice had a suppressive affinity and left others trembling.

The monarch was indeed a supreme genius of this generation. Though he was unbelievably far away, his divinity still frightened the crowd.

“He’s insane…” An expert regained his wits and commented.

“He’s courting death, how can Little Diamond take on Dragon?” A disciple from a great power said.

No one had confidence in Little Diamond when their opponent was Dragon.

“Why does he seek his own demise?” Another couldn’t understand.

One youth answered: “Well, is it decided already? Li Qiye has two ultimate treasures right now. They even killed something as strong as that dark creature, maybe he can use them and defeat Dragon.”

“You’re sorely mistaken.” Someone from a prestigious clan replied: “Do you think Dragon only has Peacock Monarch? No, they have numerous ancestors and top weapons. For example, Space Dragon Emperor alone probably left behind invincible weapons, not to mention the other forefathers.”

“That’s true. If Dragon can be taken down by one or two treasures, it wouldn’t be considered to be on the same level as Tiger’s Roar.” A knowledgeable cultivator nodded.

“He has zero chance, both he and his sect will be utterly destroyed. The problem is whether Dragon will be furious enough to clear out the region.” A prestigious clan member uttered coldly.

This was indeed a real concern for the smaller sects present. They could become innocent victims if Dragon decided to show its wrath. Thus, some gritted their teeth angrily at Li Qiye.

Li Qiye ignored them and said: “Looks like there’s nothing else to do at the conference, why are you all still here?”

No one responded. The small sects didn’t want anything to do with Li Qiye. They wanted to leave as soon as possible in order to draw a clear line between them and Little Diamond.

As for the great powers, they understood that the conference was over. Dragon lost its young lord and numerous disciples. Some great powers also lost many members as well. They weren’t in the mood to stick around.

“Let’s go.” The first great power left and many followed right after. This signaled the end of the Myriad Sects Conference.

“We’re leaving too.” Smaller sects no longer had a reason to stay and got as far away from Li Qiye as possible, treating him like a plague.

In just a short time, only a few cultivators remained. For example - Chi Jinlin and Jian Qingzhu.

“Sir, would your group like to visit Lion’s Roar?” Chi Jinlin invited Li Qiye.

The members of Little Diamond became excited right away and stared at Li Qiye with anticipation. Putting the circumstances aside, they would love to visit Lion’s Roar, especially the capital.

After all, cultivators naturally wanted to visit the overlord of the south. The only thing stopping most of them was the distance, rendering it impossible for weaker cultivators.

Therefore, a direct invitation from the heir was as good as it gets. There was a chance of them entering the capital and even meeting the royal clan.

“Afraid that I might fight Dragon to the death?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sir, you’re a true dragon soaring on the horizon, of course you are not afraid of anything. It’s just that I would like to offer my assistance.” He paused for a bit then stared at the other members of Little Diamond: “Lion’s Roar is responsible for protecting any sect within its border, so you can rest assured.”

He made it clear that even if Li Qiye were to visit Dragon, he wouldn’t need to worry about Dragon sending its underlings to destroy Little Diamond.
