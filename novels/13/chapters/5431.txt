Chapter 5432: Dream Eye

Illumination Conqueror attained a high mastery over his anima tree while borrowing the power of the illusory realm. This granted him enough power to kill apex cultivators such as Supreme or Eternal.

Alas, his anima tree was uprooted by Li Qiye while he lay in a puddle of his own blood.

If he had gotten a chance to fight Supreme and his enemies, it would have been a tragic and stirring tale even in the case of defeat and death - the end for a hero.

Unfortunately, there was nothing talelike regarding this beat down. Li Qiye drove him helpless and insane, looking like a struggling clown. He ruined his prestige and reputation by continually descending into madness.

“Even if I die, my spirit will live on with The People!” The broken conqueror got up and healed his wounds with his dao and vitality.

He had no other thought in his mind outside of a singular obsession - offering everything for The People.

Holding on to this obsession was the only thing keeping him going. Otherwise, he would collapse himself without being defeated due to the atrocities he had committed.

“Boom!” His vitality coiled around his true fate and created a blood maelstrom. He then roared: “We stand together, The People shall never fall!”

Time and space started spinning with the maelstrom as well, creating total chaos in the illusory realm.

A gigantic eye manifested into reality at the center of the maelstrom. Everything else came to a halt.

This caused everyone to gasp while the top cultivators shuddered in fear. They understood what Illumination was doing - calling out the legendary eye of Dream Paradise.

“The mythical eye… the ender of worlds if it opens…” A dragon lord murmured in horror.

“At the very least, the illusory realms will go down.” Another dao lord said.

“Open and obliterate this world!” Illumination laughed wildly before chanting.

Although this was only an image of the eye, everyone believed that it still could destroy the illusory realms. This meant that anyone inside would be killed as well.

“Pop.” The eye opened wide, revealing its profundity - capable of devouring the illusory realms and all six continents.

“Not like this!” Supreme shouted while the others felt the same fear. Li Qiye, on the contrary, only smiled and took no action to prevent it.

“Let us destroy everything, hahaha!” Illumination celebrated as if this would destroy everything before him including Li Qiye.

He didn’t mind dying in the next second since he was going to drag so many members of The People down with him.

“Zzz…” The sound of absorption started since the eye truly initiated its consumption process.

However, it didn’t devour the world, only Illumination Conqueror’s vitality, dao power, chaos true energy, and even his newly-gained primordial affinity.

“Nooo!” He bellowed while deteriorating into a dried corpse: “Devour them!”

Unfortunately, the eye didn’t understand and continued absorbing him who couldn’t resist since he had become a part of the illusory realm. The power he borrowed was now directly suppressing him.

This development caught everyone by surprise. First, Illumination Conqueror knew the secret to summoning the dream eye? Second, they thought that the eye would target them and the illusory realm. Alas, only the summoner himself was affected.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Bam!” He fell to the ground once all of his essences and true fate were absorbed by the eye, resembling a grotesque corpse.

“I--I stand with The People…” He uttered his last words.
