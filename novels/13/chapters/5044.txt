Chapter 5045: Sleep And Pollen

“Demon is dangerous right now.” Nightwalker elaborated.

Goldcrest thought about it briefly and didn’t know why.

“Peacock Monarch is about to pass.” Nightwalker continued.

“I don’t understand.” Goldcrest said respectfully. Everyone in the world knew about this.

After all, commanding gods didn’t live forever. This wasn’t an unprecedented event at all in Demon. It was no different from other lineages losing their ancient ancestors.

“Something else must be happening.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, Vine God is facing his disaster soon too.” Nightwalker nodded.

“Vine God? Isn’t his lifespan unlimited?” Goldcrest took a deep breath. Alas, it shouldn’t be surprising since he had lived for so long already.

“This is different.” Nightwalker shook his head: “Vine God maintains his original form and experiences one tribulation after another. As long as he surpasses them, he can keep on surviving with a new cycle.”

“What do you mean by a new cycle? Like reincarnation?” Ming Shi had heard legends about this before.

“No, he has been keeping one form all this time.” Nightwalker said: “This is akin to a tree with fruits. They will mature and fall every season but this won't repeat forever.”

“But why is this an issue?” Goldcrest asked.

“Dream Monarch will hibernate for sure.” Nightwalker said with a serious expression.

Goldcrest took a deep breath and said: “According to the legend, if the monarch sleeps, so will the rest of Demon.”

“It depends on the length.” Nightwalker said.

“What are you guys talking about? Who is Dream Monarch?” Ming Shi asked.

“The commanding god of Serpent.” Goldcrest said.

“Well, I don’t understand the connection between Vine God’s looming disaster and Dream Monarch’s hibernation.” She said.

“It’s because Dream Monarch was born on Vine God’s branch and has a nest there. Its true form is a sleepy worm, that’s the connection between the two.” Goldcrest explained.

“Because of this, so many in Demon will sleep as well.” Nightwalker said.

“What is going to happen next?” Ming Shi asked.

“Dream Monarch rarely appears, always in a drowsy state. That’s why Wild Dragon is usually in charge.” Goldcrest said: “If it actually sleeps for a long time, no one will be able to stay awake.”

“Yes, that is part of it. Vine God will also open his flowers to release vine pollen in an attempt to stop the disaster.” Nightwalker added.

“Pollen?” Yunyun was confused as well.

“It causes paralysis on top of decreasing cultivation. If this disaster lasts for a long time, the pollen will stop everyone in Demon from improving since it would seep deep inside the body.” Nightwalker said.

“So it’s similar to a chronic poison.” Ming Shi took a deep breath.

“That’s right.” Nightwalker nodded.

Ming Shi realized something and smiled at Goldcrest: “Rooster, sounds like you have to run back to Abroad then.”

“What about Phoenix City? I’m still the city lord and can’t just abandon it.” Goldcrest smiled wryly.

Ming Shi didn’t see it from this angle because she was just a regular disciple, not having the same pressure and responsibility as her friends.

“I still worry about Bug the most. Your unsealing that tablet is rather ominous, Young Noble.” Nightwalker said.

“It’s fine, it’ll only make things more exciting.” Li Qiye smirked.

“I did feel something off about that tablet.” Ming Shi said.

“It should have something to do with that branch’s deity spot.” Nightwalker said.

“You’re referring to their founder god?” Goldcrest asked.

“Yes, the legends aren’t good ones. I’ve had a bad premonition ever since the unsealing event.” Nightwalker nodded.

This was not an empty statement because commanding gods were sensitive to the changes in Demon.

“Tell me more about this founder god.” Yunyun said.

“Rumor has it that he is a golden mosquito, extremely ferocious and leaving only skeletons in his path. This is before he became a founder god, of course.” Goldcrest said.

The girls shuddered after hearing this.

“Why would people worship this evil god then? There are other branches.” Ming Shi said.

“Remember Bloodfly God? Bug is the right branch for them.” Goldcrest said.

“Bug consists primarily of poisonous creatures.” Yunyun said.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“That is correct, Miss Jian.” Goldcrest nodded.

“The return of Golden Mosquito would be a disaster to Demon.” Nightwalker speculated while staring at Goldcrest.

“I still can’t leave.” Goldcrest said because he wouldn’t be able to face his ancestors after abandoning Phoenix and its inhabitants.
