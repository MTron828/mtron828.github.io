Chapter 4818: White Crane Legion Commander

The eyes on each head of the abyssal lord had a different glow. Some had flames while others had a nefarious dark glimmer; another had a blinding radiance…

Just the innate destructive forces from the eyes alone could kill the strongest Heavenly Sovereign in the mortal world. This included ancient ancestors who were Supreme Sovereigns.

The abyssal lord was no fool. He had calculated the possibilities and suspected that Li Qiye might be faking his injuries.

On the other hand, this was a once-in-an-epoch opportunity. The flesh of an epoch creator in his prime and during his period was immensely nutritious. This could actually bring him to the next level. Furthermore, eating Li Qiye and this epoch would also remove the heavenly injuries as well.

Therefore, despite the dangerous circumstances, he was willing to take the risk. Success meant becoming the leader of the other overlords. In fact, he could even devour all of them.

That would make him one step closer to a more terrifying realm, perhaps immortality. After weighing the pros and cons, he decided to shoot the arrow and started a blood feud with Li Qiye. There was no going back.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Whoosh!” A blurry image appeared and the sound of it breaking through space came after.

This was a simple finger strike of the water affinity. He didn’t resort to using his strongest attacks. The water thread was as thin as a strand of hair and shouldn’t be dangerous at all.

Of course, when it came from an overlord, it could pierce through all dao defenses and the stars. Moreover, he embedded a curse within it.

Space and time withered along its trajectory. This curse could eliminate an entire world alone.

Top cultivators who were still conscious didn’t see a damn thing. Only the supreme cultivators saw an afterimage.

However, everyone felt the power of the curse and their life force withering away. This prompted them to scream.

Meanwhile, the other overlords gaze intensely at the incoming water thread, hoping to gauge Li Qiye’s injuries.

“Boom!” Alas, they did not get their wish. A magnificent wall made of water descended. 

It had the blessing of countless layers of runes. This special wall had a heavenly affinity, consisting of myriad water types and the apex of this dao. The runes empowered the already-incredible wall and stopped anything from coming through.

Living beings in Eight Desolaces felt the power of water encompassing and protecting them.

“Bam!” This seemingly-impregnable wall collapsed but still managed to stop the water thread.

A portal manifested into reality and a woman walked out. Behind her were the mighty auras from many true gods and divine trees. She stood before the abyssal lord, ready to fight. 

She wore a navy dress over her tall and slender figure. Her cloak fluttered with the wind while her eyes shone like the stars.

Her beauty invoked gasps of admiration. It seemed that the ocean always followed her as if she was a goddess.

Living beings looked up and had nothing but reverence for this divine being.

“Void Zone.” An old monarch focused on the bright portal. 

He saw many true gods with incredible power. Moreover, they were still alive and weren’t just remnant images. Behind them were towering trees brimming with dao power. They could support numerous worlds for eras.

“The lord of Void Zone and the true gods, the World Tree is behind them.” This was his first time seeing these legends.

“Who is she?” An ancestor asked.

“I believe she is the lord of that secret domain.” A progenitor from an ancient clan whispered.

“A capable general under the dark crow serving as a legion commander.” A supreme overlord recognized her because back in the Nine Worlds, she showed her worth while possessing many ace cards left behind by him.

Today, she was a being that the overlords didn’t dare to underestimate. None of them knew her entire arsenal.

“Little girl, you are my descendant.” The abyssal lord stared at her.

She was none other than the daughter of Martial Sea God and the commander of the White Crane, Tantai Ruonan. 

“I have nothing to do with the previous epoch.” She coldly uttered.

“You do not know our connection.” The abyssal lord said: “The blood of the sea dwellers courses in your vein, I am the creator so you are my descendant.”

“How shameless.” Triune Alligator Lord who was trapped in his own epoch laughed: “An epoch lord such as yourself need not lie. When it comes to bloodline, she is my descendant, a sea demon.”

“The sea demons of the Triune Epoch have nothing to do with you. You are only a sentient rock compared to me, the true ruler of the seas, the creator of the Aqua Epoch and the sea dwellers.” The abyssal lord retorted.

Listeners couldn’t believe it because they haven’t heard of anyone creating a new race outside of the heaven.

“You think too highly of yourself.” The yin kun peng joined in as well: “Sea dwellers are only a branch of our divine beast family. You borrowed our bloodline and added it to the living beings of your own epoch to create abominations. These descendants of yours had to hide at the bottom of the ocean and never see the sun.”
