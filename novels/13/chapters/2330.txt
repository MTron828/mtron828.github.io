As the group went on, Li Qiye finally became interested when they made it to a stone wall. He chuckled and said: “A bit interesting. Friend, you can go now.”

He patted the Kui before jumping down. The two girls quickly followed him.

The Kui didn’t mind and went on its own, disappearing into the mountains.

Li Qiye turned his focus towards the wall, same with the two girls.

It was located at the ridge area of this mountain. Below are a series of protruding edges, seemingly circling around the wall. The girls took their time and didn’t notice anything. This was only a regular cliff. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

It had holes and crevices with rocks filling in along with bits sticking out, definitely not a flat surface. Its shade was a common gray, decorated with the random vines and weeds.

The strange part was Li Qiye’s fixation, treating it as a beautiful natural beauty. The girls didn’t get it at all.

He leaped up to the edge of the cliff and touched the rough surface. He was gentle as he would to a lover. The girls also jumped up and stood on the protruded part with him.

“Such perfection, they could be considered the origins.” He said with emotion.

The girls failed to see the perfection in this ordinary cliff. They have seen too many like it in the outside world. They touched the surface and found it coarse enough to prick their skin.

“So why is it perfect?” Bingning asked out of curiosity, unable to see the mysteries in this place.

“Look carefully.” Li Qiye’s finger slightly touched the wall with a strange rhythm and order.

“Pop!” The wall resembled more of a lake now with rippling waves.

What the two girls saw became different, no longer their own shadow. Bingning saw a vast expanse and an explosion signaling the start of a universe.

It came quickly but also left with haste. Everything was ephemeral and disappeared before she could see them clearly.

Ximo’s vision also only lasted for a split second. She saw a divine sword containing the secrets of heaven. Unfortunately, she didn’t get a second glance.

When they regained their wits, they looked at the stone wall again. It was still the same as before, crude and ordinary.

An illusion would be the logical assumption, but intuition told Bingning that the scene she saw earlier was real.

“What happened?” She asked in astonishment.

“You’re looking at a dao bone.” Li Qiye was amused at their reaction.

“A, a dao bone? This wall?” Both the girls became wide-eyed.

“Indeed.” He smiled.

Bingning was greatly affected. She had heard of stories about dao bones before. Normally, it would only be the size of a fist. A large one would be that of a water basin.

But this wall, or rather cliff, was gigantic. Could a dao bone of this size be real?

“It’s way too big.” She murmured.

“That’s why no one can take it away. Its origin is ancient and earth-shattering, far more precious than a dao scripture.” Li Qiye revealed.

The two girls found it hard to remain calm. Bingning copied Li Qiye and also touched the wall with one finger. However, the result wasn’t to her expectation.

“Why can’t I create the same images again?” She wondered.

“If everyone can create the origins, then it wouldn’t be considered mysterious or profound, right?” He smiled: “This required the power of a progenitor or another similar existence. You right now can’t do it, unless you are born with an immortal heart.”

“Would this allow one to learn the dao?” Ximo had limited knowledge but she had heard stories about dao comprehension using dao bones.

“It’s possible, predicated on excellent talents, an unyielding dao heart, great vision, and impeccable intelligence.” Li Qiye answered: “Just an ordinary dao bone can be difficult already, let alone this one.”

With that, he sat down and began to meditate with his eyes closed. The two girls did the same, wanting to learn for this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

A hush fell over; only the sound of the winds and flowing water could be heard. Even their breathing became muted.

As time passed, Ximo couldn’t sense or feel anything despite an earnest effort at meditating. Perhaps this dao bone was rejecting her.

Bingning fared better, seemingly grasping on to something yet losing her grip. She tried repeatedly to no avail as if she was far from reaching the level of understanding the dao bone. Eventually, she decided to give up, aware that certain things couldn’t be forced. This learning opportunity alone was already a new peak for her.

On the contrary, Li Qiye seemed to be sleeping, staying as still as a statue. Nothing could distract him right now.

“Let’s watch carefully.” Bingning sighed quietly. The two of them stood nearby and tried to not bother Li Qiye.

One second after another, then minutes, hours, he still didn’t move.

Rustle suddenly interrupted the silence. Bingning raised her guard instantly.

“Someone’s here.” She darted next to Li Qiye, realizing that qi deviation could happen if he were to be interrupted during his meditation.

Ximo came closer to protect him as well in spite of her meager cultivation.

Sure enough, a group approached from the distance. All of them were strong; a few old men had the aura of a True God.

“Sword Sovereign...” Ximo recognized the young leader to her dismay: “The ancestors too...”

She took a deep breath as her expression soured after seeing the rest of the group.
