Chapter 4821: Primeval

Just a single swing managed to repel three overlords. This shocked all spectators including other overlords.

Heaven and earth trembled in the presence of this old man even though he didn’t exert an aura. As he stood there with a hatchet resting on his shoulder, he gave the impression of being unbeatable regardless of the enemies.

“Primeval.” A supreme overlord in space revealed his name. [1]

“The lord of Ancient Heavenly Burial Ground.” Ancestors who have lived for a long time became emotional.

“Primeval has chosen his camp.” Another overlord in a burial ground inside Desolate Wild said.

In reality, this was not his first time picking a side. He had shown up during the previous calamity to fight the Ancient Ming. Other overlords still remembered this.

Today, he picked Li Qiye again during his ally’s moment of crisis. This confirmed his faction for the future.

“Primeval Epoch wants to join this mess too?” The three overlords on the other side stared intensely at him.

“Indeed. Actions have consequences.” Primeval Lord who was also known as Old Ghost responded.

“You’re rather confident, Fellow Daoist.” Dead Immortal’s mystical voice echoed.

“Fellow Daoist, you intend on fighting the three of us by yourself?” Triune Alligator Lord looked around and then asked.

“Triune, you are only an incomplete epoch lord. Dead Immortal was killed as a sacrifice to the heaven and Lord of the Deeps’ very existence is unacceptable to the heavenly dao.” Old Ghost judged each one before concluding: “You three are broken, it is mistaken to think that you are unbeatable now.”

“Hahaha.” The alligator lord snorted in response: “Fellow Daoist, you’re not faring any better than us after losing your expedition. Just another man living a borrowed life.”

“True, but I am all I need to deal with you three.” Old Ghost smiled confidently.

He spoke without any hesitation and revealed his domineering personality. This was a claim very few could make - fighting three overlords alone without trepidation.

“Fellow Daoist, the high heaven is absent in this flourishing epoch. If we split it, we might be able to recover. Walk with us instead.” The abyssal lord said, wanting to tempt Old Ghost to their side.

The high heaven’s absence didn’t happen during their own epoch. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

“Devouring one epoch does not make you invincible. Look up at the sky vault, many in history have done so and are far stronger than you three. They’re still living as pathetically as us.” Old Ghost scoffed in response.

Those capable of understanding this shuddered because it contained terrifying information.

There seemed to be another place separated from their world with even stronger characters who had done terrible things in the unknown past.

“Boom!” Another lightning bolt coursed around Li Qiye. Though it returned to the body, one could see that Li Qiye was seizing the upper hand.

“Time’s running out.” Dead Immortal reminded his allies.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Fellow Daoist, nothing good will come out of this for you.” The abyssal lord threatened. His chilling tone alone could freeze Eight Desolaces for eras.

“Your temporal flows are a double-edged sword, your copy cannot exert your true power. Victory is mine.” Old Ghost said.

“So be it.” The three didn’t want to waste more time, realizing that they must kill him to get to Li Qiye.

“Come, we’re fighting in the temporal flow.” Old Ghost roared and stomped on the ground.

A primordial light erupted along with chaos true energy and dao laws. They enveloped him and turned into primordial armor plates.

“Boom!” The flow of time around him belonging to Primeval Epoch created an ancient battlefield. It pulsed outward and covered Old Ghost along with his enemies.

Interestingly enough, a river of time belonging to the current epoch was also connected to this battlefield. This epoch should have been destroyed but it seemed to be revitalized by the current timeline. It resembled new branches growing from a dead tree.

Regular cultivators didn’t take note of this but the overlords did.

“It’s flowing with Eight Desolaces, how?” One of them became startled.

Primeval Old Ghost naturally belonged to his own epoch. Alas, this epoch has turned to ashes long ago. Only a shell remained, nothing more.

Strangely enough, its rotation included the flow of Eight Desolaces right now. The latter was adding life to this past epoch.

“Looks like Eight Desolaces have accepted him.” One overlord in Desolate Wild speculated.

The three combatants became serious. They understood that Old Ghost had more than just his personal power in this battle.

“Primeval!” Old Ghost immediately attacked by stomping the ground and releasing the power of time toward the enemies.

The three stepped forward and didn’t relent, performing their grand dao without holding back. The shock waves from their battlefield still affected Eight Desolaces to the dismay of its inhabitants.

Meanwhile, someone else had a different plan.

“The time is now, use my body and arrive.” Cosmic Lord has been watching patiently for the right time.

A death mark with a circular sawtooth pattern was embedded on his chest. It corroded his flesh and looked like a bloody hole leading to the deepest area of hell.

1. Primeval is just the new translation for Ancient Heavenly since with this context, it should be a cool title. Inputting this change into the automatic system for replacement ☜
