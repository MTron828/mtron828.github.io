Chapter 4927: Deer Pawnshop

The stress caused by Deity’s search disappeared right away since many students were about to graduate.

The academy would open its door and the timing coincided with the appearance of a certain pawnshop.

There were timings to its appearance. Moreover, only students were allowed to participate. The risk was low while the reward was potentially sky-high.

Excitement filled the air for the incoming ceremony. Graduates would have a chance to gift the academy a useful gift or merit laws. Or, they could also earn generous prizes during the ceremony.

There was nothing else like the academy in the lower continents. One just had to participate in the graduation ceremony and test their luck.

Many have been lucky in history and became famous later on. This was another reason why top masters paid the academy back so handsomely. Of course, some students still thought about what they should leave for the academy before all of this.

“Let’s go to Book, maybe we’ll find a nice treasure for the academy.” A genius from a great power contemplated this matter.

Of course, others only cared about their own gains during the ceremony. Discussions sprung everywhere.

“If we can obtain Demon Conqueror’s treasure during the graduation ceremony, we can ride it to the top.” One student said.

“Our ancestor left behind an heirloom here, I want to bring it back this generation.” A member of a declining sect relied on this opportunity to revitalize it.

“Don’t forget about the deer pawnshop. If we get lucky there, we’ll be able to pay the academy back.” Another said.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A few merely wanted everything while not paying any price. In their mind, they wanted to become invincible first. It wouldn’t be too late to return to the academy afterward.

Meanwhile, the academy was busy hanging up red lanterns as well. Later on that day, they floated up in the air and created a path reaching the horizon.

“Sky Way is up now. We’re so lucky, the pawnshop will really be there.” Many students became ecstatic.

“Let’s go, no more wasting time. It will start soon.” Some couldn’t wait any longer.

Unfortunately, it was packed with people even before the start of the event. After all, everyone from Abroad was trying to get there.

“We should go too, everyone is there already.” Ming Shi couldn’t wait and started pulling Li Qiye while running.

“For the majority of people, seeing the pawnshop is the blessing of a lifetime.” Goldcrest told Yunyun who wasn’t that interested.

She didn’t come for any treasure, only to look for a certain person during the ceremony. This was one clue to the empress dowager’s disappearance.

Nonetheless, she didn’t want to kill the mood and followed along.

“You know that there is an earth-shattering secret behind this pawnshop? Hehehe, you’ve read many books and know everything, right? This is your time to shine.” She happily pulled Li Qiye’s arm.

“How so?” Li Qiye asked.

“Watch and tell me when there is something really good before pawning, then I can show it off during the ceremony.” She said.

“Why should I?” He gave her the side eye.

“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity since the pawnshop isn’t always there. Most importantly, you can finally make good use of your knowledge. If you can figure out its mystery, wouldn’t it be the proudest moment of your life?” She said shamelessly, trying to get him to help.

“What’s there to be proud of about figuring out one mystery, let alone it being the proudest moment of my life?” Li Qiye said.

“Oh? Then what do you think is worth being your proudest moment?” She asked.

“Being a good person.” He responded with a serious tone.

She stopped running and stared at him: “What kind of an answer is that? Being a good person isn’t hard at all. Even mortals can do it without any problem.”

Yunyun and Goldcrest didn’t expect this response either.

“For me, being a good person is the hardest pursuit since it requires an unchanging heart.” Li Qiye said.

“An unchanging heart…” Yunyun realized something.

“For a tiger to be good, it needs to not eat humans.” Li Qiye said.

“But you’re not a tiger.” Ming Shi retorted.

Li Qiye smiled mysteriously. For some reason, this smile creeped her out.

“Okay, don’t be going crazy on me now, we can just go test our luck.” Ming Shi shook her head and kept on pulling Li Qiye forward.

Once they made it there, they saw that it was completely packed. Nonetheless, male students came over and showed them a spot.

“Looks like our Big Sis’ charm is unbeatable.” Ming Shi laughed due to the suitors making a path for them.

“It’s starting soon.” A student said.

They were one of the latest groups to get here. Everyone silently awaited the pawnshop’s appearance.

“An evil wind.” Li Qiye suddenly noticed something and focused his gaze deep into the sky.
