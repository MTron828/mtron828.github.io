Chapter 5473: A Certain Someone

The insurmountable odds didn’t apply to Li Qiye. Although the crowd was shocked by the grand spectacle, they didn’t find the result surprising.

They felt something about his current state, that he was one with the world. No, he was the high heaven itself.

The high heaven was a concept beyond their grasp - unimaginable and unfathomable. Nonetheless, they could tell that this entity was true, evident by the terrifying tribulations.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Li Qiye was just as unstoppable as the heavenly tribulations. The skeletal sword and the combined might of the four broken realms were overwhelming, just not when the target was Li Qiye.

He was one with heaven and earth. Everything else could be destroyed and he would still exist. Some insightful cultivators gained a new understanding of anima and the true self. Was this the highest level?

“Anima… seeing the high heaven at the end of the path…” One of them murmured.

Prior to this, they had a vague idea of the end of the path after cultivating anima. Alas, something flashed in their mind after seeing Li Qiye’s current state.

“Seeing the high heaven…” The empowered Supreme and Immortal Pagoda became emotional as well, reaching the point of being “enlightened”.

Could this be the final destination of their path, the end of the dao?

One could now hear lightning crackles and thunderous explosions above Li Qiye as if a tribulation was forming. This only lasted for a few seconds before receding.

A valiant woman in the upper continent looked up and saw Li Qiye’s current state, murmuring: “Is it necessary to display the high heaven’s appearance when garnering this little power? Show-off.”

Meanwhile, Li Qiye prevented the sword and the pagoda from moving an inch. Supreme and Immortal Pagoda could see that this was futile.

“Senior, lend me a hand!” Immortal Pagoda shouted to everyone’s astonishment.

Who in the upper continents was qualified to help him now, given his empowered state? Moreover, “senior”?

“Celestial Court, descend!” Supreme shouted as well.

Everyone became tense and felt something ominous was unraveling.

A figure appeared in the deepest region of Ultimate - a place known by cultivators yet unexplorable. The dao profundity there was beyond the reach of apex cultivators.

Space and time morphed chaotically around him, unable to maintain their original form. This caused him to be ethereal like a shadow.

Nonetheless, they felt that he had understood all the mysteries and truths. No secrets in this world remained for him.

“Boom!” He raised one hand and took control of the four broken realms, activating the final radiance of a setting sun and extracting all of their power.

“Rumble!” The upper continents couldn’t contain such a frightening force and started expanding violently.

Storms and gales manifested into reality, ravaging the continents.

“Profound Emperor!” An ancient Grand Emperor saw him and gasped.

“Profound Emperor?” This was a nearly forgotten title - an immemorial being who was the founder of Divine Alliance.

In the distant epoch, only a few cultivators could be considered his equals - the most notable being Purewood Divine Emperor and World Emperor.

He disappeared not long after starting Divine Alliance. People speculated that he had chosen to live reclusively in Celestial Court or passed away from old age.

None expected to see him in Ultimate. Some have gone there before without knowing that it was his abode.
