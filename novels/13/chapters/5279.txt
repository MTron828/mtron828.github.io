Chapter 5280: Hideous Visage

The sand beneath and those scattering to the wind were unbearable all the same. Travelers became restless, unable to bear the extreme weather.

Li Zhitian convinced the others to trace the source of the cries. They eventually found it - a girl whose hair draped down her white dress.

It was unclear whether she was injured or for some other reason, but she couldn’t move away from the spot.

Her soft cries pierced the heart and made everyone feel distressed, wanting nothing more than to hug and protect her.

She didn’t seem to notice their presence and continued to cry.

Li Zhitian couldn’t endure this any longer. He approached and crouched down, speaking with a gentle voice: “Lil Sister, why are you crying?”

The girl turned around, revealing something that could barely be considered a “face”, more resembling a blood-filled gaping mouth with spiky teeth.

Li Zhitian immediately stepped back but suddenly found himself frozen. Something controlled him and his true fate, fully immobilizing him. The mouth aimed for his head with lightning speed.

He knew that something like this was going to happen. However, he was confident in his cultivation, thinking that he would be able to escape in time.

Alas, his current state left him horrified. He wanted to scream but no sound came out.

‘It’s over.’ He thought and closed his eyes, only capable of waiting for death.

Fortunately, Li Qiye was countless times faster than lightning and lifted the mouth away from Zhitian.

“Raa!” It let out a chilling roar and opened wide toward Li Qiye instead.

His eyes flashed brightly as he summoned lightning to strike the creature, causing it to be ravaged by this mighty affinity.

“Crackle!” Lightning surges repeatedly struck the mouth, causing it to tremble uncontrollably. Eventually, it couldn’t move any longer.

Zhitian watched the entire thing but still couldn’t move until Li Qiye tap him on the shoulder.

He shuddered and thought that a spell had just left his body. His true fate finally worked again.

“Shit, that was close.” His knees buckled after the fact. That would have been the end for him if it wasn’t for Li Qiye.

“You were told to not go.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

Li Zhitian remembered back in the city, the rude man in crimson told him to not go anywhere. Unfortunately, he was caught from the very start by this mysterious creature.

“What is this monster?” He shuddered after recalling his near-death experience.

“It has a few names, ghost face or nightmare.” Li Qiye casually picked up and tossed the “mouth” to Zhitian.

He caught it but wanted to throw it away. Nonetheless, he still curiously took a look.

The thing had been sealed by Li Qiye but its appearance was still horrifying.

“I didn’t know such things exist in our world.” Zhitian remarked.

“They don’t, only in dreams.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Dreams?” He became surprised but the group was moving on already.

Zhitian hurried to catch them while still holding the creature.

“Should I throw it away?” He asked, not wanting to be exposed to it for too long.

“No, keep on carrying it, I have uses for it.” Li Qiye said.

Zhitian had no choice but to carry the nasty creature while following Li Qiye.

The journey was not difficult for cultivators at their level. It was only a matter of time before they crossed through the desert.

The next area consisted of magnificent shooting stars. They flowed like rivers, emitting colorful auroras, stardusts, and flames. As they streaked across the sky, they left behind pleasant echoes…

“A surging galaxy.” Zhitian murmured.

“No, it’s the ground that is moving. The stars are not in motion.” The old servant corrected him.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zhitian observed the scenery carefully and found that this was indeed the case. He realized that the desert was nothing more than a gigantic vessel with a curved front. It carried the sand through this galaxy.

To the front was someone controlling the ship with a large oar, rowing left and right. His shoulder was incredibly broad, capable of shouldering three thousand worlds without any difficulty.

Even if the heaven were to collapse, he would be able to raise it and allow a pure land to exist underneath.
