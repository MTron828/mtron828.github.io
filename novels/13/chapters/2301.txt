“Did you guys hear? That ant-feeding brat made it to the sixth hall.” People still didn’t know Li Qiye’s name by now, only his nickname.

Some weren’t surprised to hear this: “So? The guy has enough money to feed ants so he could probably get into the tenth hall without any problem. He should last for a while.”

Sure enough, another news came about - Li Qiye had entered the tenth hall.

“Just how rich is he?” The youths started to salivate with envy.

For many cultivators, just reaching the fifth or the sixth hall was amazing enough.

“How many re-do has he done already to reach the tenth hall?” This question came up.

In fact, everyone guessed wrong. They assumed that he had failed many times because it took him a while to get from the fifth to the tenth hall.

They didn’t know that he took his time appreciating the works of art on each level.

Ximo shared the same confusion, wondering if he was here for the arts instead of treasure.

Anyone else would only care for the latter but Li Qiye showed no sign of this. She copied him and also carefully judged these paintings and statues. Alas, she didn’t understand the symbolism behind most of them.

“Young Noble, what’s so magical about these items?” She couldn’t help but ask.

“They are records.” He calmly explained: “Existing in all eras and epochs, such as ceremonies, battle deeds, or just fantastic anecdotes. However, writings would disappear with time, so statues and paintings are the best preservation method.”

“Do you mind elaborating?” She remained curious.

“They are pieces of history that can solve mysteries, far more precious than merit law or treasure. Of course, the prerequisite is being able to understand them.” He chuckled.

She didn’t quite agree with this statement since merit laws and treasures held a great position in her mind. History wasn’t worth a single coin in the eyes of many; no one cared enough to waste time and effort recalling the past.

He didn’t bother explaining why since the gap between the two was too high. They didn’t have the same starting perspective.

After seeing more of them, he sighed and quietly murmured: “Ancient beyond traceability. Eternal life, desired by all, has certain origins. They are just unaware of the terror within.”

“The ant-feeding brat got to the fifteenth hall.” Someone else brought up Li Qiye.

“That guy is a badass, just how much did he spend so far? Wait, is this even true?” Someone remained skeptical.

“Of course it’s true, Regaldusk True God met him there.” A knowledgeable person revealed. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Fifteenth hall, the guy is going to be rich.” Another youth became envious.

“He must not be here for wealth cause he doesn’t look like he gives a damn about true coins, feeding those ants without batting an eye.” One more speculated.

News about Li Qiye stopped after this. Those who met him at this time were Ascenders and ancestors, not people who interact with the public. They also chose their conversation carefully.

In fact, after reaching the twentieth hall, the crowd thinned out completely. More often than not, only the duo was around.

Ximo was rightfully astounded by Li Qiye’s abilities so far. She knew that treading through Bewildering Palace was challenging, especially later on. This applied to True Emperors and Eternals as well since only progenitors could derive the mysteries later.

However, Li Qiye didn’t need to do any calculation. Only one glance was required before he picked the correct key for the next hall.

No one would believe something like this but she had a first-hand experience of this surreal event.

“Young Noble, are, are these shortcuts?” After moving through dozens of halls, she asked with trepidation.

“There is no shortcut in this world.” He smiled.

“But it looks like you don’t need to guess, Young Noble, you only need a glance to pick the right key, that’s so magical.” She quietly said.

Li Qiye smiled: “Use your heart and mind to gauge the boundless grand dao and endless laws. It is impossible to see the end, and even if you were capable, time is the limiting factor. Only the dao heart can break through all illusions and maintain one’s original goal. Everything starts here.”

“Dao heart?” She couldn’t understand due to the simplicity of it all, as if just having a strong dao heart makes everything easy.

She hasn’t reached the right level just yet. It required pain, time, prosperity and decline... All were required to build an immovable dao heart.

Meanwhile, Moneyfall was lively all over. As time passed, the big shots who came were more influential than the last. All the famous dao systems had members present.

“I heard Sword Sovereign has arrived.”

“If that’s the case, maybe Saber Devil Crown Prince will be here too. After all, the rivalry of the sword and saber continues. The crown prince will not let the sovereign steal all the spotlight.”

“Not just him, Coiling Dragon Young Noble and the martial goddess are here too. I heard Yang Radiance will send someone as well.” An older cultivator had a good information network.

Another youth came bringing news that would shock many systems.

“Isn’t that Young Noble Chu?” The moment this fella came to Moneyfall, cultivators crowded around him like the stars circling around the moon. He looked quite smug from this treatment.

However, the younger ones didn’t know who he was. Plus, his cultivation was mediocre at best so they became confused, wondering why the older cultivators were treating him so well.

“Who is that guy, look at how smug he looks?” One youth snorted while watching from the distance.

“Zhou Zhikun, very famous recently.” An old expert replied.

“Is he strong?” A youth didn’t think the guy looks like a genius or master at all.

“No, he’s just a regular disciple from a tiny sect in Longevity System. The guy managed to suck up to a big shot and became a messenger, that’s why he can act like this.” The old expert revealed.

“Young Noble Chu, how is the young lord doing?” An old cultivator greeted Zhikun and also asked about his backer.

“The young lord is doing very well, and he’s coming here soon too.” Zhikun arrogantly said.

“Young Lord Mu is coming?” A few ancestors shuddered upon hearing this.

“That’s right, Young Lord Mu is coming and he wants to see the ancestors of the big systems. I hope everyone will show up then.” Zhikun declared.

Just imagine, this was someone who would need to kneel before the elders, let alone the ancestors. But now, after becoming a messenger of Young Lord Mu, everything changed for him. Even the ancestors became polite when dealing with him.

All this felt impossible to him in the past, so now, his confidence and arrogance soared. He could speak to anyone with his chest arched forward.
