Chapter 3833: Saber And Heart

The group picked an inn near the coastline as their temporary abode. Yang Ling and Fan Bai busily went to set up the rooms. Only the old man stayed behind with Li Qiye.

The latter sat by the window to stare at the ocean in silence. The old man did the same.

“You have something to say?” A while later, Li Qiye stopped looking and asked.

“Young Master, you came specifically for Black Tides?” The old man chose his words carefully.

Ever since the beginning of his arrival in the south, Li Qiye’s goal had nothing to do with the holy ground or Sacred Mountain. Not something as insignificant as Vajra Dynasty either.

He had his focus set on Black Tides. Others simply didn’t know and assumed that he had other plans.

“Correct.” Li Qiye looked out the window again; his eyes became quite profound.

What existence would aim for Black Tides directly in this manner? The old man had a hard time gauging Li Qiye’s actual potential.

“You’ll leave the holy ground soon too?” He then glanced at the ring wrapped around Li Qiye’s finger.

Regardless of Li Qiye’s status at the holy ground, he was still only a passerby. Nothing in Eight Desolaces or any other place or people would be able to hold him back.

“Can’t stop worrying about the land?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Yes, I mean, I can be considered as half a member of the holy ground. What about you, Young Master? Do you worry about anything?” He smiled and asked.

Li Qiye didn’t answer right away. He seemed to be focusing on understanding the recent eras. A while later, he quietly sighed and said: “Worries? I can’t remember.”

This nonchalant answer had special significance when coming from Li Qiye. The experienced old man could speculate the information contained within.

As Li Qiye said these few words, each second seemed to be lasting an eternity. His eyes seemed to be looking at millions of years in the past or millions of years in the future. The long trek of time blurred everything.

“Time changes too many things.” Li Qiye eventually added.

“But it doesn’t change your goal, which is why you’re here.” The old man said sincerely.

“That’s the dao heart.” Li Qiye replied.

The old man nodded, aware that Li Qiye’s immovable dao heart was special.

“What is it that you want to say?” Li Qiye said.

The old man took a deep breath and mustered his courage to ask: “I wish to follow you, Young Master.”

He became anxious after revealing his thoughts. He was a top master who had dominated before. The four grandmasters and supreme geniuses were nothing in his eyes. His title alone instilled fear into the listeners.

Alas, the battle-hardened man became nervous, akin to a junior waiting for his senior’s guidance.

“I can see why since the dao is so long.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, the world is larger than my imagination. That’s why I wish to be your follower and gain more knowledge.” The old man nodded.

“That won’t change anything. There are benefits, sure, when following me. But, you would lose your original pursuit.”

“My original pursuit?” The old man murmured.

“When you started your dao journey, I’m sure your blood was boiling with excitement. Alas, the arduous path weathered and grind down everything you had. What did you want at the start?” Li Qiye elaborated.

The old man seemed to be in a daze. It took a while before he solemnly answered: “My heart goes where my saber points, always cutting a path forward.”

“Indeed, that is your original pursuit. Would you still have it if you follow me?” Li Qiye asked: “I’m afraid that when you truly reflect on this, you won’t be sleeping well that night.”

A tempest emerged in the old man’s mind as he fell into remembrance regarding his past. He used to be so confident, believing that he could do anything as long as he wielded his saber.

This confidence allowed him to tread fearlessly forward, always keeping his head up without fear. Because of this, he became a renowned saber god.

Unfortunately, time wore him down and he began forgetting many things. His heart became filled with callus; his hot blood turned cold. Nothing was new and exciting anymore.

Li Qiye’s comment served as a reminder, breaking some of the calluses. The hot blood started flowing once more, allowing him to turn back time as if he was eighteen again.

“I will go where my saber points.” He emphasized; his eyes became bright and his aura surged once more.

“Thank you for correcting my mistake, Young Master.” He took a deep breath and bowed towards Li Qiye.

Back in Myriad Beasts Mountain, Li Qiye’s guidance improved his cultivation. Now, he remembered his original pursuit again, no longer being lost in the river of time. Thus, his fate was changed because he found himself once more.

“Remember, living beings like us have emotions and desires.” Li Qiye sighed: “But as time passes, we forget about these things, even ourselves. One day, we might become the things we hate the most.”

He paused for a bit then stared at the old man to conclude: “In history, numerous brilliant and invincible beings inadvertently lost sight of themselves. It starts with losing our humanity then our pursuit. What we desire so much loses its meaning and color and we become mere husks.”

The old man understood enough to follow the train of thoughts: “Because of this, some become angry at themselves, others stop moving forward, more fall into indulgence.”

He paused for a bit before finishing: “And then there are those who fall into the darkness.”

“Yes, let’s try to avoid that now, shall we?” Li Qiye said.

The old man sighed. Without this conversation today, perhaps he would eventually be lost on this eternal path and change completely. He would forget who he used to be.

“My dao heart is unstable.” He shuddered. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“It’s hard to criticize anyone for this. The path towards the grand dao is just too long, not all can make it to the end.” Li Qiye put it simply yet described numerous historical events.
