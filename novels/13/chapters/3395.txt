“Young Master, may I ask where you are heading to?” Ping Suoweng eventually regained his wits and asked.

He believed that a master like Li Qiye could travel wherever he wanted. It was a shame that Divine Black was just too small for him to stick around just a bit longer.

“Stone Plateau.” Li Qiye stared at the horizon with a profound gaze. He paused for a bit before adding: “Certain things and fateful connections should end.” [1]

Suoweng sighed after having his speculation confirmed. He guessed that Li Qiye wasn’t actually a young cultivator. The guy had many shocking secrets unbeknown to others.

This was the same reason why he showed up in Divine Black. Perhaps he was somehow connected to them. It’s just that no one had a clear idea as to what.

Thus, the fateful connection between him and Divine Black had ended, hence his departure. Of course, he didn’t dare to pry about this connection or Li Qiye’s secrets.

“Stone Plateau, the world of the golems.” Suoweng only dared to comment on this part.

“Yes, it is their ancestral ground.” Certain memories resurfaced for Li Qiye. He had forgotten about some people and things due to the length of time.

“Golems are no longer the same as before. The world has changed.” He sighed and said.

“They became uncommunicative after Golem Ancestor, hellbent on finding the path to atavism.” Ping Suoweng knew a bit about this history.

In the distant past of the Nine Worlds Epoch, the golems were extremely powerful and prestigious. Alas, the great disaster changed the world and the grand dao.

Later on, an extremely heaven-defying existence appeared and came to be known as Golem Ancestor.

He opened a new path for their race, allowing them to have a method to reach atavism.

Because of this, their race started becoming distant from the rest everywhere in Eight Desolaces. Everyone knew that they were still around but it was different from their prosperous era.

“Yes.” Li Qiye understood the underlying reasons and nodded: “Well, the world should enjoy peace in a sense. Being silent is not necessarily a bad thing and the opposite applies. Too much rowdiness can herald a disaster.”

“I’m not quite sure I understand. Are you saying that prosperity can be a source of disaster?” Suoweng hesitated, thinking that he misunderstood Li Qiye’s point.

“Prosperity is usually viewed from a shallow perspective by most. A few things aren’t clear within a generation or two. And being reclusive doesn’t mean declination either, it’s just a changing of attitude and method to survive in this world, one with safety and the future in mind.” Li Qiye stared at Suoweng and answered.

“I see.” Suoweng pondered quietly and agreed.

As a sect master, he was aware of many things. After the golems’ period of isolation, it became hard to see golems in Eight Desolaces. It seemed that their population was dwindling even at their ancestral ground.

Because of this, the race’s influence decreased. For a very long period, no one exceptional came from there.

On the other hand, some speculated that the golems simply chose to change their ways. Their population and influence might have decreased but not their actual overall power.

This particular theory was neutral; it didn’t have a lot of support nor disagreement. Suoweng trusted this theory more now that Li Qiye had said it.

“Go.” Li Qiye waved his hand and told the sect master.

“Will you visit again?” Suoweng hesitated for a bit before asking. He naturally wanted to see Li Qiye here again for a multitude of reasons. The sect had boundless potential with him around.

“Leave it up to fate.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

“Let us prepare a departure ceremony worthy of you, Young Master.” Suoweng asked for permission. He had done so much for the sect so this was justified.

“No need.” Li Qiye wasn’t interested.

Suoweng didn’t dare to act on his own accord without permission. He got on his knees and started bowing again to show his gratitude: “You have saved Divine Black for sure destruction. You are our benefactor and if you ever need us in the future, just say the words and we’ll jump into a boiling cauldron without a second thought...”

He spoke from the heart with true sincerity. Li Qiye nodded and accepted the gesture.

Suoweng performed a full kowtow ceremony before quietly leaving. He was a bit disappointed as he gazed at the forces of Divine Black. He needed to think more about its future. Every step must be the right one.

“You’re leaving, Young Master?” Gong Qianyue poured a cup of tea for him, feeling a bit sad.

Though their time together was short, he gave her plenty of benefits for a brighter future. By this point, she truly viewed him as her young master and would like to stay with him.

“Do you have any plans?” Li Qiye nodded and asked.

She thought about it before answering: “I wish to train in isolation. But, I also wish to go along and serve you, Young Master.”

This was a tough choice. She wanted to focus on cultivation in order to reach a greater height but it wouldn’t be bad to follow him either.

“It’s a good plan. I’m only a passerby, like a lonely goose on the horizon that comes and goes so you can’t travel with me. You have good talents and a firm dao heart, thus an isolated training session will be very beneficial. Reaching the peak is a possibility.” He encouraged her.

“I understand.” She said softly: “I wonder how far I’ll go on the long path.”

“Silly girl, keep the main goal in mind while shouldering the burden. With great effort and diligence, you’ll be able to obtain what you want. Your goal might change as well. Everyone at different levels in their life has a different aspiration since they see different things. Just continue forward and the future is full of potential, whether it be the realm of a Heavenly Sovereign or a dao lord.” Li Qiye taught her.

“Thank you for your teachings, Young Master. I’ll continue forward without losing my aim.” She bowed towards him and said with gratitude.

“I’m sure you’ll exceed my expectation.” He nodded.

“Will we be able to meet again?” She stared at him and asked, feeling quite sad.

“If it meant to be.” Li Qiye stroked her hair and said: “The horizon, the clouds above, the apex. Everything is possible up there.”

“I understand.” She nodded.
