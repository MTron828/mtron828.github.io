Chapter 5557: Originated From Me

“The bastards at Celestial Court conduct themselves differently. When they decide to take action, they will gather a formidable force, so if they want Momentous Frontier, it will be armies led by emperors and monarchs for a full sweep instead of this type of method.” Niu Fen said.

“What is this thing… one disaster after another and the deities are nowhere to be found.” Qin Baifeng worried.

“We just have to find the geezers. Young Noble, let’s go to the tablet?” Niu Fen shrugged.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, stroked his chin and glanced around before commenting: “Hmm, there’s something strange about this thing.”

“Strange? In what way?” Niu Fen asked, believing that there was nothing Li Qiye couldn’t solve. It was a matter of willingness.

“Hmm…” Li Qiye had a strange expression before responding: “It seems to be connected to me.”

“Huh? Connected to you, Young Master? This thing is rather ominous, if not outright evil.”

“Indeed, and that’s where the issue lies. Yet it is connected to me.” Li Qiye smiled.

This left Niu Fen at a loss for words.

“Young Master, could you please elaborate?” Baifeng asked softly.

“Well, it seems to have originated from me.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“I see…” Baifeng stammered afterward: “Yo-young Master, you are neither ominous nor evil.”

“That’s debatable.” Li Qiye said: “You might not know this but I had some titles including Butcher and Fiercest.”

“Hehe, that’s all in the past. You were so glorious and awe-inspiring then.” Niu Fen laughed.

“Am I not awe-inspiring now?” Li Qiye gave him the side eye.

“Of course you are, it’s just different. Back then, you resembled a hot-blooded youth ready to massacre and destroy. Now, you are the lord of the myriad ages and can control the cosmos with a single thought, you’re also more compassionate and only kill the offenders, not entire clans and sects.” Niu Fen said.

“Maybe I should wave my hand and destroy worlds to change your opinion, do you think you will survive?” Li Qiye said.

“Please don’t, you are the most merciful and benevolent ruler, the lord of light, the guardian of the cosmos…” Niu Fen stuck out his tongue and smiled wryly.

Baifeng stood there, speechless at the blatant and shameless flattery. Of course, if she were to know that he was an apex dao lord capable of shouldering crucial responsibilities, her reaction would be even stronger. If the situation warranted this sycophantic display from him, a six-fruit dragon lord such as her might not be qualified to join the shameless act.

“Rumble!” An earthquake suddenly interrupted their conversation.

“Boom!” A gigantic skeleton crawled out of the ground, looking like a mountain.

“What the hell is that thing?!” Guo Cheng was horrified after seeing it.

“Raa!” The awakened skeleton roared.

“Is it evil?” Baifeng’s expression changed.

Niu Fen carefully looked at the light inside the skeleton’s eye sockets and said: “It’s not evil, probably something big that died long ago. It is awakened by an unknown power now.”

“Not the only one, many are awakened.” Li Qiye glanced around and said.

Niu Fen and the others leaped into the sky and sure enough, they saw the dead coming back to life in the cemeteries and the wilderness.

Some were all bones at this point; others were still undergoing the decaying process - looking rather frightening and nauseating.

A few corpses belonged to mighty creatures that had been buried underground long ago - gigantic tigers, birds, and serpents…

“Rumble!” They crawled out of the ground - seemingly awakened by something that was traveling underground with a reviving aura.

The appearance of skeletal monsters and zombies made spectators feel as if the god of death was arriving - bringing an army to harvest this world.

“What is happening…” Guo Cheng’s legs trembled in horror.

“A type of mystical force…” Bai Feng took a deep breath. Although she had never seen anything like this before, she understood the source of the phenomenon.

“An aura of death, most likely an inborn power.” Niu Fen commented.

“Boom!” The largest skeleton started walking toward the mortal world. Due to its immense size, just one stomp could kill countless mortals.

As for the others, they started walking around aimlessly and didn’t seem to be aggressive toward the living.

Nonetheless, some were just too large and could cause devastating damage if left unchecked. After all, mortals in Momentous Frontier had no way of escaping fast enough.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Boom!” The largest one drew near a city, causing violent quakes with each step.

“Scram!” Niu Fen waved his hand and obliterated the skeleton.
