Chapter 5426: The Hard Part Is Getting One To Leave

The world seemed to be contracting to a single core - Illumination Conqueror. This extended beyond Duality World and affected all the illusory realms.

.

“Rumble.” His grotto was disintegrating, unable to handle the incredible influx of power.

Once all of the dao and world essences were absorbed by Illumination, only ashes were left of his home.

Earlier, the grotto suffered immense destruction from the battle but its framework remained intact. There were still living beings and a chance to rebuild. Now, Illumination was the only one left, having destroyed his own creation.

Other cultivators had created grottos as well. Some were lost for various reasons but how many were destroyed by their own creator?

Meanwhile, Illumination grew to the size of a cosmic being - dark like a galaxy while having stars growing and flashing within. His eyes alone were made from millions of stars pushed together. A separate temporal and spatial order manifested within him.

It became difficult for spectators to distinguish the conqueror from the Illusory Realm. A light containing a supreme power flashed brightly and blessed him.

As they looked closer, they saw a massive shadow in the shape of a closed eye. This was fortunate because they couldn’t imagine the consequences of the eye actually opening.

They thought that it would be able to spot all living beings and reduce them to ashes, apex conquerors included.

“Borrowing the power of Dream Paradise.” All-things murmured.

Supreme, Swordsea, and Eternal had to look up in order to see Illumination’s face.

“Inviting a god is easy, getting one to leave is the hard part.” Swordsea said: “This is courting death.”

“I’ve never thought about leaving this place alive anyway.” Illumination’s voice could be heard everywhere as if he was the ruler of the world. It echoed from all directions and made people feel like insects.

Nonetheless, his opponents were undeterred.

“What a frightening method, and the price paid too.” An ancient ancestor murmured while keeping a safe distance. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Illumination relied on the sacrifice to channel vitality and dao power into the pool of devil dreamwater.

Keep in mind that this special “water” was a part of the illusory realm. As he became one with the pool, he also turned into part of the illusory realm and could borrow its power.

“Do you think this is enough to kill us?” Eternal said proudly before growing gigantic as well.

“Boom!” His immortal bloodline erupted, seemingly powerful enough to destroy the entire realm. This changed him into a cosmic being possessing infinite time.

“Boom!” Supreme released his twelve radiant sacred fruits and activated his dao. With that, he became a humanoid colossus as well.

“You aren’t the only one who can transform.” Swordsea, on the other hand, chose to maintain his normal size. However, his sword dao expanded at an unimaginable rate, causing stars to look like specks of dust. The dao encompassed an ocean of swords that could expand infinitely.

Cultivators of this level had no issue changing into a grand avatar form. Of course, size didn’t matter as much as raw power which Illumination had.

“We’ll see who’s the strongest!” Illumination shouted.

“Regardless of strength, you are destined to die today for the world no longer tolerates your existence.” Eternal said mercilessly, stating a blunt reality regarding Illumination’s predicament.

“Don’t worry, I shall live long enough to see the extermination of the heaveners.” Illumination laughed.

“Extermination?” The trio exchanged glances after hearing this, thinking that something was amiss.

“Hahaha! This is not my final ace card! Even if you three defeat me today, you still won’t be able to stop me from exterminating them!” Illumination declared.
