Chapter 5662: Thirteen Fate Palaces

“Sacred Teacher, is it possible to break through in the current age?” He took a deep breath and asked.

“Yes, albeit difficult. There is no shortcut though and death is the common outcome.” Li Qiye said.

“How arduous.” He sentimentally said: “But to leap out of it is still the best choice.”

“Right, breaking out means endless possibilities because the dao suppression has two sides. Every path is the same, if you get an easy start, then the later stages will be difficult. If you bear a heavy burden initially, it will be smooth sailing later on.” Li Qiye elaborated.

He paused for a moment before continuing: “All paths converge ultimately and the prices paid are nearly the same. It’s just that some stop instantly or only make it halfway. The dao is lengthy, requiring a steadfast dao heart.”

“Right, only a strong dao heart will be able to endure all the sufferings.” He understood: “Can’t make it to the end with a crumbling dao.”

“What you have achieved thus far is a height unreachable by many emperors and monarchs. Is it only due to your matchless talent or grand fortunes? Not entirely, your diligence and perseverance in the nine worlds paid off.”

“I understand, and I have lost my way here because of greed, how embarrassing.” He broke out in cold sweats.

Despite his unparalleled talent, he still faced challenges during the era of the nine worlds. Over time, those less talented with no fortunate encounter still ascended to the thirteen continents.

He took a long time before ascending, eventually becoming an apex monarch. Most of those who came before him couldn’t reach this goal.

Ascending first didn’t matter. This occurred to Eight Desolaces as well. Brilliant dao lords from there didn’t reach the apex after entering the six continents.

“Remember, mortals might view emperors and monarchs as the end of the grand dao, but that is only the beginning.” Li Qiye said: “Although you’re an apex monarch now, you might not be able to reach the end of the road, it is not guaranteed. Keep in mind that perseverance can triumph over talent.”

“I understand how reckless and foolish I was in attempting to break the limit. I know how I nearly fell to the darkness.” He said.

He had such confidence in his talent that he thought about reaching the next realm. However, merely cultivating didn’t seem to work, hence his adventurous attempt. Alas, he nearly paid the ultimate price. If it wasn’t for Li Qiye, he would have been drowned in darkness for eternity, never to see sunlight again.

“Emperors, ancestors, overlords, everlasting life, how arduous is this long road? But as long as you walk steadily, there will be achievements and transformation, breaking through is inevitable.” Li Qiye reminded him.

“I will carve this deep in my heart, Sacred Teacher.” He bowed in acknowledgment.

Ever since he stood at the apex, there have been subtle changes to his perception of cultivation. Perhaps he took his achievements for granted due to his innate greatness, causing him to become hasty in wanting to reach the ancestral realm.

“Keep walking forward and your future is limitless. Take a shortcut and although you’ll be an overlord, you’ll be no different than an abomination lurking in the darkness.” Li Qiye warned again: “Is that what you want? A lifetime of hard work to become a sunless monster? If that’s the case, your carefree and proud legends would become mere jokes instead.”

“I won’t forget, Sacred Teacher.” He became drenched in sweat.

“If you do become such a monster, I’m afraid I will be the first to kill you.” Li Qiye went on.

“I understand.” He knew that Li Qiye was not joking around. If he were to fall to the darkness, Li Qiye would not show mercy due to previous sentiments.

“I see potential in you as long as you can persevere, becoming an overlord is not impossible. Cherish yourself enough to protect the dao heart.” Li Qiye said.

“I will not let you down, Sacred Teacher.” He took a deep breath.

Li Qiye ended the scolding and focused on the thick gate instead, imbuing dao from his palm.

“Buzz.” When all the runes lit up, they started a deriving process culminating in a supreme chapter.

A boundless aura manifested from the chapter, capable of crossing through an entire epoch back to its source.

“Creak...” Li Qiye slowly pushed the gate despite it possessing the immensity of the entire world.

Beyond the gate was a pitch-black expanse. One could only see outlines of indelible divinities - remnants from the start of time.

Although the darkness came from themselves, it still couldn’t fully erase the eternal divinities and their primal nature.

“Thirteen... thirteen palaces!” South Emperor observed and confirmed one of his speculations. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Sure enough, the faint figures depicted fate palaces - a total of thirteen.

He couldn’t help but stare at Li Qiye - the only known cultivator to possess thirteen palaces in history.

However, the world didn’t know that there was someone else who had obtained thirteen palaces before Li Qiye - an existence too ancient to be studied.

The idea of fate palaces containing Heaven’s Wills started during Trinity Epoch. Someone at the start of this epoch had obtained thirteen palaces.

Later on, everyone believed that twelve was the limit. This persisted to the golden age of Eight Desolaces and the six continents. No one believed that creating the thirteenth one was a possibility.

“Thirteen palaces...” He became overwhelmed. Li Qiye was not the sole exception.

He had speculated this possibility previously but seeing it with his own eyes was a different experience.
