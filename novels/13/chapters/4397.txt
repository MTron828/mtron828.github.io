Chapter 4398: Again

Celestial Tiger lost all confidence in capturing Li Qiye. His previous exploits have emboldened him.

He heard about Li Qiye defeating Bear King previously but didn’t think much of it. He could defeat Bear King as well.

Someone of Li Qiye’s background was limited and couldn’t be that much stronger compared to the geniuses of the east.

The worst-case scenario should have been a hard-fought battle, eventually ending with history. Unfortunately, he felt fear right now while trying to understand the situation. The destruction of the aegis made him feel something ominous.

All eyes were on him, waiting for his next move. His ace card was still available - the Omniscient Eye.

He narrowed his eyes and looked serious. His ace card was indeed stronger than the spear technique.

Back during his battle with Jian Qingzhu, he didn’t waver despite losing in terms of grand dao comprehension. This didn’t apply currently because he wasn’t sure of defeating Li Qiye even with a full-force attack from his special eye.

The guy’s mysterious nature horrified him. He knew nothing about Li Qiye’s other techniques.

“Got anything else?” Li Qiye gestured provocatively.

The hand wave was naturally viewed as contempt. If this was the beginning of the fight, Celestial Tiger would have been livid. However, he didn’t have time for that since the opponent was unfathomable.

“Senior Brother, use the Omniscient Eye!” A disciple lost his patience and shouted.

“Right, render him unconscious!” Another loudly chimed in.

Most members of Dragon believed that the eye had a high probability of knocking Li Qiye out.

“I shall do my best if you wish to continue.” Celestial Tiger put the spear down and said seriously, no longer possessing the haughty attitude seen previously.

“Show me your brilliant techniques.” He took off his top robe.

The crowd became tense since he was about to use his Omniscient Eye. Only a secret dao lord technique could defeat someone as bizarre as Li Qiye.

Alas, if Li Qiye were to win, their sect’s reputation would take a large hit. This was unacceptable for these prideful disciples.

“Clank!” Suddenly, a saber slash cut through the air. Energies and clankings could be heard as rays spread outward like a blossoming flower.

“Boom!” The net sealing Jian Qingzhu was cut apart by her saber.

She appeared and stood in front of Li Qiye then said: “Senior Brother, I’m your opponent.”

She showed no sign of being dizzy any longer. Her saber energies were still rampant like before. It seemed that the eye failed to deal significant damage.

Everyone knew that she was quite strong. The problem was that she didn’t have a solution for the Omniscient Eye.

“Junior Sister, your courage is commendable but I’m afraid your brilliant saber dao still can’t stop my eye. You need to use a secret dao lord technique to contend.” He said. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The crowd respected her power but they didn’t disagree with his comment. Alas, the second part piqued their interest.

Jian Qingzhu had cultivated a secret art as well? Some members of Dragon became envious since they never had access to one.

She and Celestial Tiger were highly-prized geniuses. Thus, it made sense for them to have these arts.

“Right, I’m sure Divine Luan Dao Lord left some behind.” One disciple said.

Divine Luan Dao Lord had strong ties with Phoenix Ground. If she had left some of these arts behind, they would certainly be under the possession of Phoenix Ground. It wouldn’t be surprising for Jian Qingzhu to train with one of them.

“I have not cultivated a secret art.” Qingzhu answered honestly.

The crowd didn’t expect this response.

“If that’s the case, Junior Sister, I don’t think you have a chance of beating me.” Celestial Tiger said.

The same outcome seemed rather likely - her being unable to stop the eye.

She took a deep breath and said: “Your Omniscient Eye is peerless indeed, but I still wish to overestimate myself and try again.”

All eyes turned towards Celestial Tiger. He put on a serious expression and said: “Junior Sister, weapons do not have eyes. It won’t be good if I overdo it and injure you.”

“Don’t worry, Senior Brother. I will only blame myself for being weak even if I die in battle.” She took a deep breath and said solemnly.

This surprised everyone. They didn’t know why she insisted on fighting again. The odds were insurmountable.

“I shall give you a gift.” Li Qiye lazily interjected.
