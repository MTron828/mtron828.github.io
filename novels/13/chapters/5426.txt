Chapter 5427: Extermination Method

The threat naturally frightened everyone on both sides. Heavener was one of the three great races but The People also had heaveners.

The distinction between The Race and The People has been blurred recently due to the peace enjoyed after Emperors War. The usual races from both sides mingled with the other, making classification increasingly harder.

As time passed, many cultivators eventually abandoned the classification altogether. Top cultivators understood that this was started by Celestial Court.

In the upper continents, the only differentiation came from the four alliances. In fact, Divine Alliance had sided with The People before.

There should only be the races - heaveners, devils, diviners, humans, golems…

The Race and The People, despite the names, had nothing to do with racial classifications.

“You’ve found it?” All-things felt something ominous.

“I’ve always thought about exterminating the three great races and there is indeed an ineffective method. Though I haven’t found the ancestral blood to wipe them out, I suppose we can start with the heaveners first.” Illumination laughed.

Everyone was aware of his intention to exterminate The Race. However, targeting heaveners meant targeting members of The People as well.

“The audacity!” Supreme shouted.

“Hahaha, I will show you!” Illumination laughed and finally made his move.

“Buzz.” A runic gate appeared on his cosmic chest and began to open, revealing the dark world beyond.

It was devoid of light but everyone could still see the flow of the dao clearly. Ordinary cultivators didn’t notice anything but the dragon lords and conquerors’ expressions darkened.

“Ultimate!” A conqueror shouted after seeing one of the four broken realms. Rumor has it that Devil Conqueror gained his fortune here after falling into an ominous pond. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

All-things immediately thought of something and shouted: “Brother, you must stop, this leads to damnation!”

“Damnation? So what, I fear not even death.” Illumination laughed in response.

All-things couldn’t say anything else because this was true. Illumination was ready to sacrifice his life for his grand ambition. He sighed and could already see the consequences.

“Heaveners first!” Illumination shot strands of dao laws made from connected stars into the gate leading to Ultimate.

“Clank! Clank!” They entered a bottomless pond and wrapped around something.

“Splash!” Illumination started pulling with one hand, causing the water to splash.

He lifted up a colossal entity shrouded by black fog. Behind it was a hook-like object - a manifestation of the dao that has been refined countless times.

Illumination’s dao chains attached to the hook, allowing him to pull it out of the bottomless pond. It still seemed to be sleeping and didn’t move an inch.

Only a few knew about this entity - Supreme and his allies included.

They had seen it back in Lesser Firmament, causing immense damage. During its escape, Illumination ambushed it and left behind a dao mark.

Everyone thought that he had failed to subdue it but now, it became apparent that he was merely preparing for the next plan.

Since it was still deep in slumber, people had no idea what was going to happen next. However, Supreme knew what it was and understood the gravity of the situation.

“What is it?” A dragon lord asked.

“What does this have to do with exterminating the heaveners?” Another wondered.

They focused their gaze on the dao chain pulling on the hook.

“Do you know what you are about to do?” Swordsea glared at Illumination.

“Of course, this is destiny, a path left behind by the predecessors. I am merely following the course.” Illumination laughed.
