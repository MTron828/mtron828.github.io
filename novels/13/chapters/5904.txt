Chapter 5904: Is Sacred Teacher Still Here?

The world basked in the glow of the primordial tree. It shouldered three thousand worlds and history itself, capable of taking in many more. Size didn’t seem to be a constraint for this wonderful tree seemingly existing at the very start of time.

Li Qiye sat on top with his eyes closed, possessing absolute control over his epoch. The chaos affinity of the tree purified him, making him look like a true immortal from the legends - the only one in existence.

The chaos flow worked with his primordial derivation, initiating a metamorphosis. He became more and more of a mortal while being impervious to the weathering of time.

He returned to the source and had no cultivation aura to speak of - a mortal physique and a mortal appearance. The only things notable were his exceptionally clear eyes, capable of seeing through deception and secrets immediately.

As he meditated, others might mistake him for having passed away. After a long while, his energy and aura dissipated and became hidden within. A million years could pass by in the blink of an eye during this process.

Eventually, he opened his eyes and the rays could tear apart the epoch. An Ancestor wouldn’t be able to block a single move from this “mortal”.

“Rumble!” He heard loud explosions and so did everyone else.

They came from above and caused the world to shake. Each explosion shattered the spatial fabrics between worlds. Living beings trembled because they felt something attempting to descend.

“The sky is breaking?!” Everyone became alarmed.

“Another calamity?” An old ancestor on the verge of death recalled a distant legend - long ago, the landscape of the world changed due to a calamity from above.

“What is happening?” The strongest emperors woke up and noticed the pressure.

“Overlords are no longer around though.” One of them said.

Seven Nights enjoyed peace and prosperity in the absence of the overlords. Such a catastrophic event couldn’t possibly occur. The coming of a foreign one horrified everyone.

“Is Sacred Teacher still around?” One emperor wondered as the sky was being assaulted.

They were still far from being strong enough to stop a supreme overlord.

“Yes.” Someone close to Li Qiye said. They knew his departure was only a matter of time but he was still here right now. Alas, his actual location was unknown even to World and the others.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Prepare for battle, we’re Ancestors now, it is time to fight.” World Emperor’s command could be heard.

The breaking didn’t happen immediately and the explosions took a long time before reaching them - days to years.

Nevertheless, World and his allies understood the situation was getting more serious.

Following World’s order, the entire six continents entered a state of war readiness. A combative aura permeated the realm.

The strongest cultivators in this era were unprecedentedly united, prepping to fight against any incoming overlord. They built grand momentums all over the continents to harness the power of the epoch.

“It’s coming.” One day, everyone heard someone speaking.

“Sacred Teacher!” World, Profound, and many others felt a chill run down their spines followed by a surge of joy.

All of their worries were swept away since Li Qiye could easily deal with any descending overlord.

“Boom!” A deafening boom echoed across the epoch and a power pierced through the sky. Both the six continents and Eight Desolaces felt the impact of this inexplicable force.

Emperors felt utterly insignificant - something they hadn’t felt in a long time since the demise of the overlords.
