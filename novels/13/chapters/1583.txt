Li Qiye was glad to see the old man’s calm demeanor: “The choice of each individual determines their future. This can all happen with a single thought. It certainly did for the three of you.”

He sentimentally continued: “Qian Li’s background was a bit worse, same with her conditions, but her confidence never wavered. She knew she would become a dragon one day to obtain the Heaven’s Will. That’s why she became an emperor. As for Lil Blackie, he loved challenges. Such a madman who only wanted to fight. That’s why he ruled for three generations. He broke through his own limit in each of them while taking a different path each time.”

He stared at the old man and said: “As for you, Zhengfeng, you are either hiding or just plain weary of it all. That’s why you don’t want to leave your nest and ultimately became a shopkeeper with only this lamp as your friend.”

“I agree. Qian Li had her imperial path while the Black Dragon King had his tyrannical dao. As for me, I probably can’t defeat my inner demon.” The old man said.

“Inner demon? Others might have this but not you. This path leads to being loathed by the heavens. What inner demon can you have? What is scarier than being unwanted by the heavens?”

“That makes sense too.” Zhengfeng smiled leisurely.

Li Qiye only shook his head and drank the fine wine. In his eyes, Zhengfeng didn’t have that many flaws. It was just that his chosen path leads to darkness.

Yu Zhengfeng was Matriarch Yu’s older brother and was from the same era as the Black Dragon King and Immortal Emperor Qian Li.

When he was younger, the Yu was only a minor clan. His sister back then suffered a terminal illness. All the famous doctors gave up on her.

In order to save his sister, he tried his best at cultivation to become an invincible being. The karmic nature of life willed it so. During an adventure, he found Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo’s supreme grand dao. Henceforth, he embarked on a peerless path.

There were geniuses everywhere in that era. He, the Black Dragon King, and Immortal Emperor Qian Li were always together because of Li Qiye. Others praised them as the three heroes back then.

Later on, Zhengfeng fell in love with the emperor. However, she was hellbent on her imperial path without looking back while not having any feelings for him. Zhengfeng eventually lost to her in the competition as well. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This made him dejected. Despite having the power to challenge an emperor, he grew bored of the mundane world so he returned to Discover to open a pub and spend his day doing nothing.

As for his sister, the Dark Crow back then gave him the right treatment. However, the materials required were too difficult to find since they were immortal medicines.

Thus he had no choice but to seal his sister until Immortal Emperor Qian Li found the mythical immortal medicines. Zhengfeng then asked Li Qiye for help and they finally cured Matriarch Yu.

A bit later, Matriarch Yu joined the Black Dragon Legion. This was when Zhengfeng completely shut himself from everything and the world forgot about him.

No one knew that there was an incredible master hiding in this tiny pub.

“Your Excellency, I admire you the most out of everyone. I don’t know how you keep on going, I certainly can’t do it.” He took a sip after pouring another cup for Li Qiye.

“Just have to keep walking.” Li Qiye drank and said with a smile.

He smiled wryly: “Easier said than done. You have been walking for millions of years now. That’s a very long period. You must have suffered endlessly, bidded farewell to many love ones and even buried them yet you didn’t go crazy or became a devil. You were certainly not a saint either nor choose to hide from the world. You are yourself after the arduous time, never changing your determination regardless of the perilous challenges. The winds and rains accompanied your journey with the stench of blood. Black Dragon King once said that if he had experienced so much pain like you, he would have started to hate the world and become a monster! Your dao heart isn’t something we juniors can compare to.”

He finished his cup in one gulp before letting out a long sigh.

Li Qiye actually didn’t know what to say and continue drinking quietly. The guy was right. He has sent away and even buried many loved ones. He had many friends and loyal confidants once but ultimately, he was the only one left. Numerous had died from old age while he continued to live on!

The most painful thing in life was not death. It was watching those close to you die one by one. At this point, death became sweet relief.

“There’s a fair amount of people who have lived just as long in this world.” Li Qiye said flatly.

Zhengfeng disagreed: “I know, you have told me about them but they’re not actually living, only sealing themselves by sleeping. It’s not the same as you who tread on the mortal plane for generations. Time and mundanity washed your body but they can’t break your will and heart!”

“It’s good to be alive.” Li Qiye answered. It wasn’t the perfect response since he didn’t know how to help the guy.

Zhengfeng understood all the logic and rationalities right now. If he wanted to jump out of his dao, he must rely on himself. The problem was that he didn’t care for it so Li Qiye couldn’t help him at all.

Zhengfeng nodded and drank silently.

The two continued drinking. After a while, Zhengfeng slowly said: “I saw Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo on the grand dao!”

Li Qiye pondered for a bit before smiling wryly: “Sigh, the emperor has too much of an influence on this dao. At this moment, he might be better and had walked further than you so that’s why you can see him.”

“He can’t leave it and is just walking around in a circle. If you go on, you’ll be just like that stubborn guy.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“He’s already an emperor, why is he going back on this path?” Zhengfeng found this puzzling.

Li Qiye elaborated: “Who knows? Just him, probably. The guy has always been a controversial emperor, different from the others. Even after ascending, he kept to himself. Maybe in his mind, he’s too far removed from the world.”

“It could be fate then. The emperor and I are somewhat similar.” Zhengfeng answered.

Li Qiye said earnestly: “Perhaps. The two of you have failed in love before but this isn’t the reason or the end. The path is still beneath your feet. It was created after he became emperor. He didn’t embark on it during his youth. Moreover, his heart remained unchanging despite romantic frustration and pain, that’s why he could still become emperor. But as for why he returned in the future, it might not be related to worldly matters. You and Mu Zhuo are not the same.” Li Qiye stared at Zhengfeng and finished.

Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo was a very reclusive and mysterious emperor. For many emperors, they would shine after ascension. Moreover, there would be many friends and followers both before and after. Many were willing to fight for them.

Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo was an exception. He had always been fighting alone for that was his nature.

“Maybe he’s lonely? That’s why he returned to this path.” Zhengfeng speculated.

“Not necessarily.” Li Qiye denied: “He had two marriages on top of many lovers. His heart shouldn’t have been too lonely.”

He was born in a declining family. Because of this, his fiancee betrothed to him at a young age married a richer husband later on.

This inspired the emperor and he started to rise and become a famous hero with sufficient power. This allowed him to marry the prettiest girl in the region.

Unfortunately, tragedy struck again. His wife had an affair with a peerless genius in the nine worlds. It was quite a blow to the emperor.

He gave up all of his wealth and dissolved his sect before slumbering in a forest away from the world.

After skipping a generation, he came out and shocked the world once more to eventually become emperor.

With that, he found many lovers and eventually married one world’s most beautiful woman.

Such achievements were the lifelong pursuit of many people. However, the emperor felt life was dull and left quietly. From then on, no one heard of him again.

He didn’t create a sect nor pass down his grand dao. Though future generations cultivated his emperor laws, he wasn’t the one passing them down.
