Chapter 5798: Need To Wash My Head

This was abnormal - an Immortal Emperor exuding the might of the heaven.

All cultivators feared heavenly tribulations the most and this aura usually preceded one.

“Still want to keep going?” Li Qiye smiled.

Although Jiao Heng no longer had the mech, he seemed more frightening than before.

“Rumble!” A thunderous ocean surged wildly within him; lightning bolts detonated constantly and fueled him.

He appeared possessed by the high heaven, unable to contain the rampaging power.

“Ahh!” Jiao Heng bellowed as his eyes lit up. This seemed to be his absolute limit.

His appearance suddenly changed - his eyes became omniscient in this split second. One would mistake him for being the messenger of the high heaven. With just a single thought, he could end this epoch.

The world trembled before the heavenly blast waves emanating from him as he reverted to the origin.

“Shit, he’s losing control!” Spectators shuddered in horror because Jiao Heng was turning into an ocean of lightning.

“Brother, calm down, calm down.” Someone descended out of nowhere during this crucial moment.

He came gracefully like the drifting clouds, free-spirited and natural. As he walked, he put everything at ease and made people smile.

He was bald but not a monk. It seemed that he found having hair annoying and decided to shave it clean.

He looked clean and tidy, giving off a comfortable and relaxing feeling. He always had a faint smile, always viewing the world through a lens of kindness. Emperors, mortals, and insects were all the same in his eyes - potential friends.

A messenger of light and a harbinger of darkness didn’t affect him; he could still interact with them in the same manner. This applied to both evil and kind people as well.

Others didn’t affect him but his aura was infectious. Negative emotions were removed in his presence, washed away by happiness like the spring breeze.

Interacting with him was a carefree experience. A demon or a god would love to sit down with him, drinking and joking around.

His kindness was unwavering and unaffected by external circumstances. Although the demon wouldn’t want to drop everything and turn to the light, they would temporarily forget their identity and enjoy the moment together.

They felt safe due to his lack of malice. After separation, they would then return to their previous selves, not converted by him to be someone else.

“Brother, don’t harmonize.” He patted Jiao Heng’s shoulder and infected him with kindness, opening the heart.

Jiao Heng was infected by this unshakable kindness and the ocean of lightning within him gradually dispersed.

He regained his sanity and wits - just a mortal with the title of Jiao Heng.

“Come, let’s go to a better place and have a drink.” The youth scratched his head and said: “I just got a cut and need to find a nice place to wash my head.”

Jiao Heng laughed and said: “Great, I know just the place, we need to bring some good wine.”

“Excellent, what are we waiting for then?” The youth happily responded.

They seemed excited to partake in just an ordinary activity commonly seen in the mortal world.

“Sacred Teacher, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed, I am still just a mortal.” Jiao Heng smiled and shook his head.

“Bask in the joy of being what you want to be then.” Li Qiye said before glancing at the youth.

“Sacred Teacher, I do admit that I would have lost today. I don’t have anything, just this little gift before leaving.” Jiao Heng said and flicked his finger.

“Clank!” A gold coin landed on Li Qiye’s palm, prompting him to smile.

“I’m off now, Sacred Teacher.” Jiao Heng said goodbye only to Li Qiye. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“This is going to be great, wash our heads first and then drink.” The youth and Jiao Heng wrapped their hand over each other’s shoulders, looking like two kids running away from their parents.

Once they got far enough, the youth waved his hand without looking back: “Bye, old man, let’s not meet again.”

Li Qiye smiled while watching his departing figure. Everyone else watched the duo depart until they were completely out of sight.

They then glanced over at the broken Three Thousand World Mech, speechless. Li Qiye had somehow pierced through the chest of a grand-completion paragon artifact.

Who would be able to stop him now? Their entire horde empowered by Elder Galaxy was far from enough.

He was truly invincible, far beyond the reach of any emperor.
