This matter, even if Cao Xiong was ten times braver, he still wouldn’t dare. Not just him; even the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wouldn’t dare to offend Li Shuangyan. To offend her, was akin to offending the entire Nine Saint Demon Gate. To offend a giant monster like the Nine Saint Demon Gate, this was the same as seeking for death!

“To hell with it!” Cao Xiong couldn’t help but scream out this sentence. His genius disciple did not get into Li Shuangyan’s eyes, but a bag of straws like Li Qiye was winning Li Shuangyan’s favor; this was like meeting a ghost. [1]

This event, the only explanation was that Li Qiye was a spy from the Nine Saint Demon Gate. However, this type of explanation was even more like meeting a ghost and even less plausible than Li Shuangyan favoring Li Qiye.

If the Nine Saint Demon Gate sent a disciple with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace to infiltrate the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, then that would truly be like meeting a ghost. What was even worse was that Li Qiye would be the most unqualified spy; had anyone ever seen such an arrogant spy?

To say that Li Qiye was a spy of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, even Cao Xiong himself didn’t believe it. This was merely only a scheme to attack Li Qiye.

If Li Qiye wasn’t a spy from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, then what was the reason for Li Shuangyan’s favor towards him? Could it be because the two sects have a marital pact? Or maybe it was because Li Shuangyan really liked him?

Regarding this matter, Cao Xiong had almost broken his head from continuous thinking. Cao Xiong’s expression was extremely hard to see; in the end, he went to visit a certain place in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.

On top of a main peak in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was a peak with the densest natural world energy in the sect; however, today, inside the main hall of this peak, was not an elder nor a protector of the sect, but Guest Adviser Dong Shenglong!

Guest adviser — this seat was present in many sects and even in many countries. To be a guest adviser was to benefit from the resources of the sect or nation, and they did not need to worry about the sect’s matters; only when the sects or nations met a disaster would the guest adviser need to take action!

Dong Shenglong was a guest adviser of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, plus, he was the only guest adviser of the sect!

Inside the ancient hall, the breath of a Royal Noble – like mercury – discharged into the air; without a single opening. This caused others to not dare to come closer! An old man wearing a blue robe with a suppressing pressure; his whole body absorbed and exerted the frightening energy of a Royal Noble. Without a doubt, he was a powerful Royal Noble; a Royal Noble that was highly experienced.

Dong Shenglong, a guest adviser of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, was a powerful Royal Noble that could change other people’s expression. His cultivation, compared to the Six Elders of the sect, was even stronger.

At this moment, Dong Shenglong and Cao Xiong were sharing a table. Even though they were sitting together, Cao Xiong was still showing a respectful and cautious manner.

“Brother Cao’s mood recently has not been good, ah.” Dong Shenglong poured wine into Cao Xiong’s bowl. As a Royal Noble, he appeared to be very approachable; however, his fathomless eyes carried coldness that could swallow others!

Cao Xiong drank the wine in silence, and he didn’t say anything in the moment. Naturally, he came here with many expectations, but he was not willing to open his mouth first. He was waiting for Dong Shenglong to name the price.

“Brother Cao is worried because of the sect master’s seat?” Dong Shenglong was still pouring wine for Cao Xiong; his face still wore the same hidden smile, but the cold intentions in his eyes were extremely frightening.

Dong Shenglong was a guest adviser for the sect, but in reality, his origin was formidable. His Royal Noble title was not self-proclaimed, it was bestowed upon him by the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.

Dong Shenglong’s background was from the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom’s nobility. This noble family had complex ties with the Heavenly God Sect, and it could even be considered a sub-sect of the Heavenly God Sect.

Also, even Dong Shenglong’s family was not weak, it was many times stronger than the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!

Dong Shenglong being a guest adviser at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, naturally, was not from an invitation by the sect. Don’t jest, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Heavenly God Sect were considered enemies.

Thirty thousand years ago, when the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had declined, the Heavenly God Sect went on the offensive against them. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect did not only lose their kingdom that they had ruled for many generations, but they had also lost all of their Grand Elders, more or less, in this war!

After this war, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had never recovered. The Heavenly God Sect erected the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom on the remains of the collapsed kingdom of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!

Dong Shenglong was a noble at the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, and he was bestowed Royal Noble by this kingdom; why would the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect invite him to be a guest adviser? He was assigned here as an adviser by the Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.

Regarding this particular guest adviser, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect could not decline. Today, the sect was no longer able to compete with the Heavenly God Sect or the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. With this guest adviser sent by the kingdom, the sect could only accept him inside.

Dong Shenglong, as a guest adviser at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, had his own mission. He kept a very low profile during his time here. Besides cultivating, he rarely went outside, and he, even less, interfered with the matters of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; thus, Dong Shenglong had not made that many protectors and elders to outright reject him.

Cao Xiong was an elder of the sect. In the past, he, similar to the other protectors and elders, had great animosity towards Dong Shenglong. However, Cao Xiong, in his heart, also had many things that he wanted to change since he always had an ambition towards the sect master’s seat.

During that year, regarding the passing down of the sect master’s seat and taking into consideration of order according to status, the sect master’s seat should have gone to the first elder or to him!

However, inexplicably, Su Yonghuang appeared, and this made him painfully lose the sect master’s seat! In these recent passing years, Cao Xiong had lost the idea of becoming Sect Master himself; he instead placed all of his aspirations into his disciple, Leng Shizhi.

This was also the reason why Cao Xiong had so often tried to turn his disciple, Leng Shizhi, into the prime disciple, but this progress was not so smooth.

With this result, Cao Xiong became disconsolate, and his magnificent aspiration was difficult to achieve. Under these conditions, with Dong Shenglong intentionally acting friendly towards him, Cao Xiong inadvertently became closer to Dong Shenglong; his previous hostility towards Dong Shenglong had dissipated by a lot.

Later, Dong Shenglong had implied many times that he and his backing would be able to assist Cao Xiong in climbing to the sect master’s position of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!

With such a tempting offer from Dong Shenglong, it would be strange if Cao Xiong was not interested! Cao Xiong knew the people that were behind Dong Shenglong were powerful, but he also knew what Dong Shenglong wanted.

If he truly joined Dong Shenglong, Cao Xiong knew that him becoming the sect master was not a difficult matter. The problem was, once he joined Dong Shenglong, he had to put in great effort afterward. The backing of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom was not easily bestowed upon, and this deal would symbolize his betrayal of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the ancestors.

Even though Cao Xiong truly coveted the sect master’s seat and was tempted by Dong Shenglong’s offer, but as an elder of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and a disciple that grew up here, he ultimately couldn’t cross this bottom line in his heart. In the end, for him, to betray the sect and the ancestors would be something that will torture his conscience!

Of course, Dong Shenglong was not in a rush either. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had declined, and the items of this sect, one day, would fall into his hands; he had enough patience. Naturally, if Cao Xiong would join him, then it would be even better.

Facing Dong Shenglong, Cao Xiong was just drinking without replying while Dong Shenglong maintained his smile. It was a smile on the outside, but inside, it wasn’t.

Finally, Cao Xiong placed down the bowl in his hand and said: “The sect master is not present, so I do not need to worry.”

Dong Shenglong, with his pretentious smile: “Brother Cao is an elder of the sect, and you have truly contributed to it with your blood and courage. Brother Cao should be more aware of the current situation of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.”

Cao Xiong was waiting for Dong Shenglong to say these words. He looked at Dong Shenglong: “My mind is dark; please give me a few pointers.”

Dong Shenglong, still maintaining a smile, replied: “Brother Cao, even though the Nine Saint Demon Gate is here because of the marital matter; however, have you thought about this? I’m afraid that they are only here because of a certain thing in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.”

“Is that so?” Cao Xiong did not answer directly. In reality, he knew clearly what he meant in his heart.

Dong Shenglong did not care for Cao Xiong’s attitude. He was afraid of the fish not biting the bait. As long as he took the bait, everything would be easy. He wouldn’t be afraid of Cao Xiong’s hesitation anymore. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Dong Shenglong sincerely asked: “Has Brother Cao thought more about this? The truth is, in the end, the only thing that can protect the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is still the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. The Nine Saint Demon Gate is far out in the other corner of the world; they only want the things that belong to them. As for whether the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s living or dying, I’m afraid they do not care at all.”

“The marriage between the two sects, I don’t see it as a bad thing entirely.” Cao Xiong still replied in a patient manner.

Dong Shenglong let out a laugh and then spoke words with hidden meanings: “Of course, from your point of view, the marriage pact between the two sects is a happy thing, worthy of celebration. However, the marriage of the two sects; from my perspective, if your disciple Leng Shizhi could marry princess Li, then it would be ten parts perfect.”

“Unfortunately, my disciple is not the prime disciple!”

“This marital pact; it doesn’t necessarily have to be the prime disciple, right?”

The fish had taken the bait, so Dong Shenglong smiled. Cao Xiong, in the end, couldn’t escape his palm, and his confidence rose; he then, with a beaming smile, said: “The two sects have the pact. However, what if something unexpectedly happens to the prime disciple, or what if your prime disciple commits a grave sin?”

Cao Xiong’s eyes narrowed as he asked: “What is the meaning behind brother Dong’s words?”

Dong Shenglong answered while smiling: “Brother Cao, there are some people that have achieved a few accomplishments, and they couldn’t help but become arrogant and disrespectful toward their seniors. They then committed wrongful acts against the sect’s rules? Tell me I am right? For example, if your prime disciple, Li Qiye, commits a crime, then the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would have to deal with it fairly. This type of horse that causes trouble to its herd; if not dealt with, it would cause detrimental harm to the sect.”

Cao Xiong’s eyes were focused, but he did not say anything for a long time.

Finally, Dong Shenglong, still staring at Cao Xiong, slowly opened his mouth: “Brother Cao, since you came to confide in this little brother, this little brother will naturally help a friend; even if it would risk my life. If brother Cao has any ideas, just go and do it. Even if the sky falls down, isn’t this little brother still here to console brother Cao?”

“Brother Dong is so affectionate and helpful; this Cao is very appreciative.” In the end, Cao Xiong stood up and clasped his hands together before taking his leave.

After Cao Xiong’s departure, Dong Shenglong smiled, and he slowly said: “As long as you have stepped on this boat, I’m not afraid that you won’t betray the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Cao Xiong, ah Cao Xiong; if you want to fight with that old Gu, you definitely will request my help!” [2]
