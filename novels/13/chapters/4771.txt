Chapter 4772: Cosmic Lord

This might be the only thing of its kind in the history of the nine worlds. It couldn’t be duplicated or created.

There has been more than just one epoch, meaning that top masters were constantly appearing. As the lords of epochs, they created unimaginable artifacts, weapons, and even miracles. Epoch paragon artifacts were the classification for their best work.

Alas, none of them could copy and create something like what Li Qiye was looking for. It was born with heaven and earth during the primordial period.

First, there was nothing in the expanse. Worlds started to form and their inhabitants prospered. Cultivation became available and the wise sages began researching the mystical period.

This thing has been around and had owners at times. Unfortunately, they didn’t know how to use it.

In the modern days, Li Qiye has created a new epoch after the calamity. Hidden masters still paid attention to the item and its whereabout. Alas, they couldn’t bypass Li Qiye’s heaven-defying method of relying on the heaven.

They knew where it was but couldn’t actually obtain it because it would be foolish to act recklessly against the high heaven. A single mistake would render their epic patience meaningless.

Unfortunately, time was running out because of Li Qiye.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“We must obtain it.” One of them whispered.

In Desolate Wild, they possessed a special communication method. Even the strongest cultivators in Eight Desolaces couldn’t spy on their conversations.

“It is time to make a move.” Another dark overlord said.

“Don’t forget that this is his era.” Someone else responded.

“It is still in its infantile stage, this opportunity will not come again.” One more responded.

This was the end of the conversation. No one else joined in.

Deep in the Three Thousand Dao, a majestic figure floated in a temporal sphere. He opened his eyes and showed the vicissitudes within them.

“Leave the sect.” He told his closest confidante.

The person became confused at the sudden request.

“Leave, don’t linger here.” he repeated.

The person didn’t know what was going on but something terrifying must be happening soon. After receiving this order, the person left the sect quietly and didn’t report this to anyone else.

“The lord of the nine worlds. Perhaps everything will change in this era.” He then said while staring up at the sky.

“We’ll see if this is a blessing or a disaster.” With that, he crossed through dimensions to reach an unknown area - the abode of a superior capable of destroying everything.

In another chaotic expanse were numerous behemoth lineages. For one reason or another, they didn’t show themselves to the rest of the world. Nonetheless, they were strong enough to conquer Eight Desolaces. Within them were slumbering lords of terrifying power.

Today, someone visited them - a man pulsing with divinity.

If another cultivator was here to see him, they would immediately recognize him as Cosmic Lord of True Immortal.

“What?” A monster guarding the entrance to the lineage asked haughtily.

“The heavenly item is coming out soon.” He said.

The monster pondered for a bit before answering: “So what? Leave.”

“I have a recommendation from Gu Yin.” Cosmic Lord expected this so he revealed.

The monster snorted, releasing a sound wave that could destroy the stars. Nonetheless, Cosmic Lord didn’t leave.

“What do you want?” The monster eventually asked.

“May I have an audience with the supreme lord?” Cosmic Lord lowered his head.

“You are not qualified.” The monster didn’t hold back.

Anyone else would be shocked to hear this since Cosmic Lord was a top-tier existence eligible to meet dao lords.

“Gu Yin has been strongly recommending me.” Cosmic Lord insisted.

“No.” The monster shook its head: “Know your place, insect.”

“Let me meet him, I have a plan to obtain the heavenly item.” Cosmic Lord didn’t take offense to this.

The monster ignored him, causing him to leave. Nonetheless, he still didn’t give up and traveled to another desolate region.

A great city floated in space with celestials floating around it. The walls were made from black steel, rendering spying impossible. It seemed to have existed in secrecy for epochs now.

Cosmic Lord stood in front of the gate and announced: “This junior respectfully greets you, Supreme Lord.”

He patiently waited despite not getting an answer back while thinking about the various possibilities and the proper responses.

He knew that inside was a terrifying existence capable of changing the situation.

“What is it?” An ancient and distant voice seemingly from hell eventually answered.

“This junior greets you.” He got on his knees and prostrated.

“Disturbing my slumber is a death sentence.” The voice responded.

“I am aware.” He said: “But I also know that you wish to obtain the heavenly item, My Lord.”

“Is that so?” The voice returned after a brief silence.

He was not afraid since he came with multiple plans, ready for any scenario.

“And?” The voice gave the impression that it came from a gigantic entity standing above the heaven and looking down on an ant.

“I have a great plan.” He said.

“Insects can’t come up with any great plan.” The supreme lord said with disdain.

“My Lord, if you wish to participate in this grand event, I shall play the part of your messenger and servant.” He said.

“Rather ambitious.” The lord saw through him.

“I am merely looking for small benefits.” He sincerely responded.

“Do you know the consequences?” The tone became frightening.

“I am willing to bear all the consequences.” He answered resolutely.
