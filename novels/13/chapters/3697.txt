Chapter 3698: Trouble At Black Robe Alley

The Golden Regiment marched onto the eastern side, rendering the area impregnable. All the streets were under watch; those without permission couldn’t enter.

If the regiment was in charge of the east, then the west must be the Zhang’s responsibility.

Sure enough, the mansion of the Grand Chancellor opened soon after. Two groups began marching out.

They wore tight, black robes instead of armor. Each member was an expert with no emotion on their face and a billowing vitality.

It felt as if two black dragons were climbing out of the abyss. People could faintly hear the roars of the dragons.

“This is the Grand Chancellor’s personal force, Abyss Dragon Regiment.” A spectator shouted its name.

The Zhang and the Li were ancient clans. Just because they worked for Vajra didn’t mean that they didn’t have their own forces.

The two regiments began working together to guard Black Robe Alley. Not even a drop of water could get through without permission from the Grand Chancellor or Grand Commander.

Bloodthirst permeated the streets. Numerous experts were lying in ambush. They were the pillars of the two clans.

They chased away the spectators and outsiders. The latter naturally didn’t appreciate this but there was nothing they could do.

First, Black Robe Alley wasn’t exactly a public location. Moreover, the two regiments would have no problem forcing them away.

Some uttered a few words of grievance but still chose to obey. It wasn’t worth provoking the big shots over wanting to watch the fun show.

The streets became quiet as a result. One could only hear the sounds of breathing. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, the two factions have erected a ceremonial altar for the dead. The hour was approaching.

“This is quite rare.” One spectator watched from a distance.

After all, to sacrifice two nobles in the capital was unheard of, borderline rebellious.

“The Li and the Zhang have the power to do so, anyone else would have been killed by Vajra by now.” Someone from the last generation said.

Most agreed with this statement. After all, wanting to bury a noble and his daughter? Only the royal clan would be able to do something like this.

“They can do whatever they want, even changing the direction of Vajra.” An outsider added.

These words were rather taboo and better left unsaid, especially for the officials.

Alas, this made the crowd contemplate. The Grand Chancellor and the Grand Commander might be doing something - wanting to pick the younger prince as a successor instead. This alliance and the current circumstances allowed them to do so.

The second princess finally appeared. She stood in front of the altar with a murderous glare.

“It’s the second princess.” The spectators paid careful attention.

Both the Grand Commander and Grand Chancellor have not shown their face so the princess was in charge.

People actually wondered if she was representing the royal clan in this event.

“Vajra is supporting their action? Or just giving implicit approval?” Someone murmured.

“No, they wanted to see the king but couldn’t. Vajra didn’t express its stance yet, this is the princess’ personal view.” Another close to the court said.

“She’s very close to the third prince and has always been supporting him.” One more joined in.

Strangely enough, despite being siblings, she wasn’t close to the crown prince at all - the opposite of her relationship with the third prince.

“Something will change...” Those who supported the crown prince became dejected.

If the Grand Chancellor and Grand Commander wanted the third prince to be the next king, maybe this would actually happen with just a little support from the royal clan.

“The hour draws near, bring the criminals here.” The princess checked the time before ordering.

Yang Ling and her father were taken closer to the altar. They were sealed and immobilized. Their clothes and appearance looked fine; it seemed that they weren’t tortured.

“Take them up.” She ordered. The disciples below pushed the two up the altar.

“I want to see His Majesty! This is unlawful, Your Highness!” Yang Ling’s father shouted.

The princess ignored the comment.

“It’s time.” People looked up at the sky then at the street. Li Qiye was nowhere to be found.

“Is he coming?” This became the main question.

“Him alone against two top clans? That’s suicidal. He probably fled already.” One youth said.

“You know nothing about Li Qiye then, he’s a force to be reckoned with and wouldn’t run away before the battle. He faced 100,000 men alone back in Myriad Beast Mountains and maintained a calm expression from start to finish. Since he made a statement, he’ll definitely go all-out against them.” An older cultivator disagreed.

“What is he going to do?” Most couldn’t fathom how one man was going to take on the Li and the Zhang.

The current forces right now weren’t the clans’ full strength. Nonetheless, it was tough enough. Not even an ancestor from a great sect could take down these mansions right now.

“From what I’ve seen so far, there’s nothing Li Qiye can’t do.” A cultivator who was there for all of Li Qiye’s exploits said.

The majority haven’t seen Li Qiye in action. “Is he really that devilish? How can a conqueror like him touch the two clans? How ludicrous.” One skeptical soul said.

“Just wait and see.” Nonetheless, the skeptical crowd still wanted to see a miracle.

“He’s here!” A crowd member shouted after seeing a person standing by the western side.

This youth didn’t have a carriage or an auspicious beast, merely sauntering forward.

“That’s Li Qiye?” One spectator became disappointed because his image of Li Qiye was completely different.

The ordinary-looking guy didn’t look like he could decimate the mansions.

“Li Qiye!” The second princess gritted her teeth, not bothering to hide her hatred for him. Not long ago, she was forced to strip in public but worst of all, he killed her lover - Zhang Yunzhi.

“Young Master!” Yang Ling was ecstatic to see him. She had full confidence that he would come and save her.

Her father also stared at the young man. He thought that Li Qiye would look quite impressive. This was far from the case.
