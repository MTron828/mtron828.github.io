Chapter 5864: Nice Try

He raised his strongest weapon - Immortal Hexaplate. It resembled an unpolished stone slab with tiny holes and bumps. This normal-looking slab managed to stop Li Qiye’s punch earlier.

The materials couldn’t be found in this mortal world. Epoch’s End created it himself by incubating the essences and dead souls of six epochs. He proudly called it Immortal Hexaplate afterward - an unprecedented treasure.

Thus, it was dreadful despite its magnificent title. It had nothing to do with immortal energy, only death. Once activated, the death affinity from the tiny holes would spread to the current epoch.

“Die!” Voracious whipped his tail, sweeping stars away. His scales also activated their innate gift for a combination attack.

“Epoch Heaven!” He roared and became resplendent. Images of various divine beasts manifested and turned into a chaotic expanse.

It exploded and was replaced by a resplendent light. Nothing else existed, not the high heaven or heaven and earth.

It encompassed all types of power including that of the high heaven. This new gift was not found naturally in Divine Beast for it was created by Vocious Leviathan after the devourment.

“Crack!” Everyone heard a crack as the world was severed by the light arc - a move strong enough to make them wonder if Li Qiye could get hurt by it.

Epoch’s End attacked with his plate at the same time, engulfing Li Qiye with its death energy.

Li Qiye retaliated with a punch, piercing through Epoch Heaven and causing an apocalyptic explosion. Meanwhile, the death energy continued to surround him and removed any sign of life.

“Ooo-” Countless souls wailed and lamented as they lunged forward, wanting him to stay with them forever. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This was the perfect time for the five overlords to attack with their strongest move, aiding Epoch’s End and Voracious Leviathan.

However, they fled toward the celestial river to leave Elder Galaxy, aiming to find a place that had not been marked by Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng.

“Bastards!” Voracious and Epoch’s End bellowed in astonishment.

Just a while ago, these five roared and shouted, seemingly gathering energy to fight to the bitter end. They successfully convinced the duo of their determination.

Alas, the duo nearly vomited blood from anger after seeing the fleeing allies. The three immortals of Celestial Court were at a loss for words. The ancestors revered by them ran like dishonorable rats.

“Haha, nice try!” Li Qiye laughed and punched through the world of death, eradicating the wailing souls despite their endless number.

His punch reduced them to ashes and caused Voracious’ epoch scales to have cracks all over. Epoch’s End was sent flying through space.

He would have exploded into a bloody mist if it wasn’t for his Immortal Hexaplate’s protection.
