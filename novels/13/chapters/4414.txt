Chapter 4415: Yes Or No?

The crowd sympathized with the awkward situation these seniors have been put in.

The ex-sect master of Five-sun publicly asked for a marriage alliance. In theory, this should have been easy because Five-sun King was indeed popular. Moreover, he has just shown his worth by successfully gaining a fortune in the demon palace.

Peacock Monarch and Ancient Treant have agreed as well; no other disciple would have refused. Thus, none expected Jian Qingzhu to oppose the engagement in such a resolute manner.

This put Dragon in such a tough position; Peacock Monarch and Ancient Treant lost face as well. Now, even Goldbird Monarch has joined in.

The ancestors from the east have voiced their support. It seemed like the rest of the world was against the father-and-daughter duo.

If they insisted on refusing the marriage, they would be antagonizing everyone on top of severing the new alliance between Dragon and the east.

One could say that her stubbornness would make her into a sinner of the sect, being reviled by all.

Most thought that their effort was futile given the circumstances. Saying no would only make them appear to be ungrateful for ruining the sect’s future.

Goldbird and Jian Qingzhu’s expression soured since the tides were against them. These great powers were pressuring and forcing them into submission without using force.

“This marriage will be a song for the east and south to sing. This is a monumental event for Dragon, one supported by all of its members…” Peacock Monarch jumped in, telling them that they would be going against the sect for refusing.

Their status and reputation would go down the drain as a result.

“I oppose as well!” Suddenly, a disciple interrupted him.

“Oh?!” The crowd clamored as a result. It was obvious that this disciple has chosen the wrong side. Peacock Monarch and the ancestors might hold a grudge.

The punishment could range anywhere from imprisonment or even expulsion.

“He’s the first brother of Tiger Pond.” Some spectators became startled after seeing the man.

No one expected Celestial Tiger to oppose this marriage. Jian Qingzhu was a powerful rival and they had just fought earlier. It ended with his defeat.

Thus, he should be the one wanting this marriage the most. She would be sent away to the east. His chance of becoming the next successor would rise as a result. In other words, her presence in Dragon prevented his ambition.

Therefore, for both personal reasons and taking the sect’s future into account, he should absolutely support the marriage. His contrarian decision surprised everyone.

Peacock Monarch’s expression darkened. It was one thing for Jian Qingzhu to refuse since she was an involved party. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Celestial Tiger, leave.” Ancient Treant spoke with enough force to freeze the youth.

Few dared to oppose the three ancient ancestors in Dragon. It would be considered disrespectful and expulsion might be the punishment.

“Ancestor, Sect Master, Junior Sister Jian will be our pillar in the future.” He took a deep breath and mustered courage: “Moreover, our sect allows for freedom in love. She might be the saintess but she still has the right to decide.”

“First Brother is right.” Some whispered among themselves.

An older disciple mused for a moment before responding: “He’s right, if Senior Sister Qingzhu can’t decide her own partner, none of us can. It set a terrible precedence.”

Peacock Monarch was visibly livid; Ancient Treant narrowed his eyes.

“I disagree.” Featherhat Paragon smiled and said: “Niece Jian is the heaven’s daughter who has inherited the phoenix bloodline. Only someone as capable as Five-sun King is worthy of her hand in marriage. Furthermore, because of her prestigious bloodline, she has a great responsibility to pick the right husband. His Majesty is the perfect choice.”

“Well put, Paragon. A saintess and a dao lord, a song to be sung for eras to come.” An eastern ancestor said.

Another capable cultivator from the east laughed and said: “No one else in the world is a better match for the saintess, let alone just Dragon.”

This comment offended the young generation of Dragon. Though they knew that they weren’t on the same level as Five-sun King, they couldn’t let others talk down to them in this manner.

“What did you just say?!” One of them shouted.

“I’m merely speaking the truth.” The cultivator smiled and said: “Not to mention His Majesty, I’m confident sparring with any of you.”

He spoke as if he alone could sweep through the young generation of Dragon.

“You!” This further infuriated the youths.

“Not convinced? Then come, I’ll show you.” The cultivator sneered.

The atmosphere suddenly became tense and combative.

Some members of Dragon were angry enough to think about drawing their weapons. However, their seniors stopped them.
