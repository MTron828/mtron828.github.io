Chapter 4817: Lord of The Deeps

The suction of the maelstrom in the air started pulling up one of the continents. The entire ten million miles of land were lifted off the ground.

“Dragon!” An ancient ancestor bellowed after seeing this continent being torn asunder.

Since the majority of cultivators in Eight Desolaces have fainted, only a small number were still awake to see this horrific scene - an entire continent being pulled up into the maelstrom.

Dragon was first, next could be Sky Border or Sword Continent.

Alas, the inhabitants of Dragon didn’t go down without fighting. The powers of dao lords and emperors immediately activated.

Dragon has been around for eras now so it certainly had mighty lineages. These clans and sects had produced emperors and dao lords before.

Weapons of the highest level instantly rushed to the sky to fight the maelstrom. Meanwhile, ancient ancestors also appeared. They recklessly summoned their true fate to deliver the strongest attack possible, wanting to protect their home.

As for the weaker sects and mortals, they were the first victims. Without stabilizing formations, their territories were the first to be devoured by the maelstrom. 

Eventually, even the ancient lineages faltered. Though they had formations and resources left behind by dao lords and emperors, these defenses still crumbled and they were eaten by the maelstrom like the rest.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It only took a minute or so for an entire continent and a hundred thousand sects to be reduced to dust.

This shocked all the ancient ancestors and monarchs elsewhere in Eight Desolaces. One threat appeared after another today.

“Who is this monster?” A sect progenitor who had traveled the world fearlessly trembled.

A momentary break came for the world as the maelstrom stopped releasing explosions. Though it was still spinning and grinding, the deafening blasts halted.

A figure appeared in the maelstrom, shrouded in a black robe from top to bottom. His stature was tall but seemed strangely flexible. His body seemed capable of moving and shifting in any direction.

He only had a humanoid form, not quite a human. He had nine heads; each of them had a unique visual phenomenon behind them. These images had never been seen in Eight Desolaces before.

“Lord of the Deeps.” A supreme overlord in space whispered. 

“This old geezer devoured all living beings in his epoch, his children too.” Another inside a burial ground glared coldly at this cloaked monster.

Living beings in Eight Desolaces felt despair again.

“Who else can stop them…?” A divine monarch lamented.

First came Triune Alligator Lord then Dead Immortal. Now, a frightening monster from the ocean? 

For eras now, they thought that they were the strongest cultivators in Eight Desolaces. The world was their safe playground. 

They had no idea that in the abysses and burial grounds were monstrous overlords. These beings were waiting for the world to prosper. Alas, this epoch was rather different due to its heaven-defying defenses. Otherwise, it was rich enough for the harvest.

The abyssal lord stared at Li Qiye with flashes of greed in all of his eyes. He wanted nothing more than to devour Li Qiye as fast as possible, expressing this appetite even more than the alligator lord.

Nonetheless, he restrained himself and looked around.

“Fellow Daoists, the meal is before us, shall we dine together?” His ancient words reached all the overlords that were observing on the sideline for one reason or another.

He was no fool and knew their intent. Alas, Li Qiye’s flesh was too tempting so he eventually lost patience after the appearance of the first two overlords.

None answered him. At the very least, they still wanted to watch a while longer. There was a chance of other ace cards looming in Eight Desolaces.

“Very well, I shall take it for my own then.” The abyssal lord declared.

“Don’t even think about monopolizing it, I have one part.” Dead Immortal retorted.

“Brother, I’m afraid you will be occupied for a while, it’s best that I start first.” The abyssal lord was not afraid of Dead Immortal.

“Go for it then, we will eat you after!” The alligator lord’s voice from a different timeline echoed.

“That depends on your ability.” The abyssal lord responded. These epoch lords were afraid of no one.

With that, he turned his attention toward Li Qiye.

“Please recover and wake up!” Spectators in Eight Desolaces prayed again.

Li Qiye’s recovery was the only chance to revert the tides by killing these overlords.
