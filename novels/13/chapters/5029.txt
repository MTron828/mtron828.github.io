Chapter 5030: Sure Kill Move

The pulse has reached a monstrous level after being blessed by Jun Cuican. Despair took over Demon due to the sheer devastation.

When it struck Li Qiye, everyone felt that nothing would be able to survive it, not even him. The impact alone caused Demon to sink down while mountains crumbled nearby.

“Boom!” Nonetheless, it didn’t disintegrate Li Qiye.

“Die!” Wild Dragon roared and continued to add more power.

As for Li Qiye, his power was fluctuating dramatically. The various affinities burned themselves due to Jun Cuican’s My Brilliance.

“Ah!” He cooperated with the play and let out a scream, letting others know that he was on the verge of death.

“He’s finished.” Jun Cuican said.

Li Qiye managed to stop the triple attacks but because of activating his power, it caused the internal chaos to intensify. The thing killing him was his own power and My Brilliance, not any of the external assaults.

His scream stirred the spectators who thought that this was only a matter of time.

“Jun Cuican’s talent is unreal.” Everyone was amazed by this creation.

Li Qiye’s scream continued to echo around the region. Everyone think that this was his limit.

“Keep going!” Radiant Monarch and his allies started burning their own vitality and energy, once again pushing their attacks.

Li Qiye decided to scream louder to keep up with the play. His power surged and waned repeatedly.

“Clank!” A murderous intent suddenly manifested along with a god-killing thrust.

“No!” It froze the crowd and made them scream, thinking that their head was going to be pierced.

The target was none other than Li Qiye, wanting to deliver a fatal blow.

Time came to a halt and everyone saw the move clearly, feeling that they were so close to death.

It didn’t come from the current combatants. Nonetheless, It pierced through Li Qiye’s head.

Someone regained their wits and shouted in horror: “Shadowrider!”

Others finally realized the situation and became afraid. The famed assassin was the one to end the battle by piercing Li Qiye’s head.

No one saw how the assassin got there before everything was over. This was Shadowrider’s style, just one decisive move.

Radiant Monarch’s group felt the same fear since they had no idea either. They would rather fight a stronger combatant than become Shadowrider’s target.

“It’s over.” Skystomper God shuddered and watched Shadowrider closely.

“Sigh, not fun at all.” They suddenly heard someone sighing and speaking.

Li Qiye who was supposed to be dead opened his eyes and his wound closed, looking as alive as ever.

“What?!” The crowd shouted, thinking that he had turned into a zombie.

The combatants also became afraid because they thought that he was dead for sure. That sword really did pierce him.

“Impossible!” Radiant Monarch shouted because he saw the event with his own eyes.

“It’s not a bad dao, it just doesn’t work on me.” Li Qiye smiled.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Boom!” The dao sealing Li Qiye was forced out and sent back to its master.

“No!!” Jun Cuican summoned numerous treasures and channeled laws in order to stop the dao.

Alas, this was futile since it broke through his defenses and obliterated his four sacred fruits, ending with him being reduced to blood.

“Clank!” The hand that was stopping Swordgrasp Venerable’s slash retaliated, breaking the top half of the blade and swinging it forward.

The frightened old man tried to parry only to fail - his fruits were cut through, his body dismembered. The two halves fell to the ground; he died with his eyes still open.

Radiant Monarch, on the other hand, escaped right after Li Qiye finished speaking. He crossed through one spatial dimension after another, not wanting to linger around.

Li Qiye flicked his finger and sent the spear of light in that direction.

“Ahhh!” It pierced through all the dimensions and pierced Radiant Monarch.

Nonetheless, he still kept on running with the spear still stuck in his body.
