Chapter 4089: Slaughtering Slash

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Everyone knew that Ninth’s sword would need to taste blood. Thus, this battle would end with someone dead.

They didn’t know whether Shi Yingxue was hiding from Ninth or just buying time to recuperate.

“Today.” Ninth ignored the demon king’s suggestion. Though there was no hint of emotion in his voice, he clearly left no room for negotiation.

He was the embodiment of the sword - always ready to pierce someone’s heart. Thus, it was difficult to refuse him.

The listeners took a deep breath after hearing his determination to fight.

“This is a chaotic period and our sect is busy dealing with a scourge.” The demon king could hold back no longer and barked back: “Sir, leave and return another day!”

Starshooter King joined in as well: “No need to be in such a hurry, Armament Mountain won’t go anywhere so your fight will happen eventually. We are occupied right now.”

Ninth didn’t need to be told and still understood the situation.

“Buddha will come out once I kill a few monks.” He uttered coldly.

“What is your intention?” The demon king’s expression darkened. He felt something ominous incoming.

“Make your move.” Ninth glared at the legion of Armament Mountain then bluntly stated.

Not to mention the demon king, even the neutral spectators knew what was about to happen. Alas, no one dared to stand up to this monster.

“I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed if you want to fight us. Our official business is not finished so we won’t fight you just because of face.” The demon king said.

“We have to save our disciples first, please stand aside.” Starshooter King interjected.

“So be it.” Ninth replied then raised his sword.

“Clank!” Everyone became afraid of this cultivator gathering energy. They thought that he was about to attack the legions.

Both Celestial Ape Demon King and Starshooter King grabbed their weapon and were ready to fight this mighty enemy.

“Whoosh!” However, Ninth’s targets weren’t the duo. His slash swept through the plain, seemingly flattening it.

The ropes tying up the three geniuses and their allies were severed from this single slash. Its precision astounded the crowd.

Strangely enough, Li Qiye didn’t bother trying to stop it and only watched.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” The captives fell to the ground from the towers.

No one expected Ninth to save them. This swordsman was always alone and only cared about the sword. Saving people was not part of his modus operandi.

Meanwhile, people were still surprised at Li Qiye’s inaction.

“Run!” The captives were ecstatic and didn’t expect a stranger to save them instead of the seniors. They immediately got up and started running away from the plain.

“Thank you, Sir, for this kind favor!” Both Celestial Ape Demon King and Starshooter King expressed their gratitude.

“I’m not saving them.” Ninth turned around to look at the fleeing captives and said: “Be ready to block my slash.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The runners, the kings, and even the spectators were caught off guard by this.

“Clank!” A sword hymn and a sharp aura engulfed the area.

“Sh*t!” Both the kings bellowed: “On guard now!”

The incoming aura horrified the fleeing captives. They immediately gathered energy and vitality, resulting in loud explosions.

Ninth finally made his move and raised his sword, leaving afterimages along the way. Thousands of ethereal swords appeared around him.

People sensed something formless and emotionless - murder was the only thing driving this technique.

“First variation, Compassionless!” An ancestor recognized the first move.

The swords then flew out with the speed of light, ready to unleash fatalities.

“Ahhh! Ahhh…” Waves of screams resounded.

The majority of the captives couldn’t block or dodge in time so the ethereal swords pierced their chest. The three geniuses also felt death coming for them.

Hundred-blade raised his hand and swords rained down to create a barrier. Starshooter Prince relied on his movement technique, becoming as fast as a shooting star in order to dodge the flying swords. Eight-armed Prince roared and decided to meet the swords head-on with eight palm strikes.

“Stop!” Both kings roared thunderously and made their move as well, choosing to attack Ninth.

The members of the legions also summoned their weapons and did the same. However, the attack was just too fast. Both dodging and blocking simply didn’t work.

“Ahh!” The three geniuses suffered the same fate as their men. Their eyes remained wide open and were filled with unwillingness and despair, not expecting to die after seeing a glimpse of hope.
