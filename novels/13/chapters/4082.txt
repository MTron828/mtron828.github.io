Chapter 4083: Repel

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Boom!” The palm continued exerting tremendous pressure on the plain.

“He’s damn strong.” One expert remarked.

“Yes, the demon king is only second to the sect master at Armament.” His friend replied.

Though he was still ten thousand miles or so away, this palm strike was still insanely strong - enough to crush the average sect masters and ancestors.

“Final warning, release them or die.” Each of his words left no room for question and fully displayed his power. Of course, the palm strike by itself was more than enough.

“Enough, scram!” Li Qiye smiled and raised his hand.

The earth’s loop became resplendent and the plain resonated with it. The fortresses released energy waves that travel through the lines to reach the towers.

The towers released flames akin to erupting volcanoes. Their lights then gathered on Li Qiye, looking similar to a peacock spreading its tail. Each light had a different color.

“Boom!” The loop then shot out a pulsing beam with unparalleled power. The spatial fabrics were instantly torn apart; this scar could last forever. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The spectators became aghast right away, the same case with the demon king.

He immediately channeled his energy and grand dao power. True chaos energy poured down like a flood and could flatten the entire area.

Nonetheless, the beam didn’t relent at all against this mighty defense. It looked like a true dragon climbing up a waterfall, ready for its ascension.

The spectators took a deep breath or gasped after seeing this.

“Such impudence!” The demon king was furious. Though he wasn’t here in person, he still expressed the will of Armament Mountain yet Li Qiye dared to resist?

Moreover, he felt danger coming from that beam. Thus, he added dao laws and celestial power to that palm strike, increasing its potency to the limit.

“Boom!” The palm strike became as grand as the nine firmaments and pressed downward.

“Bye now.” Li Qiye said and the pulse turned bright enough to illuminate heaven and earth, becoming several times wider.

The dao laws and celestial power were useless. The demon king screamed in pain as blood rained down. Everyone saw the beam piercing through the palm and leaving a gaping wound. One could see the sky on the other side.

The palm suddenly pulled back and disappeared from sight. The demon king clearly lost this exchange and had to return to the sect.

Winds and clouds returned. The blood on the ground was the only thing left of the exchange earlier.

The crowd was speechless. Most thought that he was crazy for challenging Armament Mountain and Starshooter Kingdom. This was akin to throwing an egg at a rock.

Now, he easily won the first round. Albeit, the king didn’t actually come in person.

“What kind of grand formation is this?” A clan member stared at the resplendent fortresses and towers.

The crowd knew that this formation allowed Li Qiye to repel the demon king. Its power was truly astonishing.

“I have no idea.” A formation master from that clan replied after a careful observation: “I don’t think it has anything to do with Armament Mountain, I don’t see a connection between the two. Hmm, it seemed to be a part of the plain as well, not recently created. This means that the plain had access to it for a long time now.”

“The progenitor of the Tang, maybe he created this too.” Another brought this up.

“No wonder why Li Qiye spent so much for it. There are secrets here.” One cultivator who saw the purchase in person said.

“Putting the treasury aside, this wondrous formation alone might be worth one hundred million.” The formation master responded.

The big shots from the region were going crazy with regrets.

“I should have bought it, that clan master only asked for three million back then.” A clan master remarked.

The plain was on sale for a long time now but no one wanted to purchase it. Alas, they saw its true potential now and blamed themselves for missing out.

“See, should stop thinking about being saved by your seniors.” Li Qiye drank a cup offered by Dong Ling and smiled: “Gotta beg them to come up with the ransom amount or you’ll die here.”

The hostages didn’t bother responding. They initially thought that the seniors would have no problem saving them. Unfortunately, Li Qiye had the upper hand, at least while fighting at the plain.

“If we die here, you won’t have good times ahead anyway. Sea Emperor will not let this go so you’ll have to stay at the plain forever.” Hundred-blade Noble uttered coldly.

“I’m afraid you’re mistaken.” Li Qiye said: “I don’t give a damn about your sect even when I leave the plain.”

By this point, Hundred-blade was smart enough to know that Li Qiye was telling the truth. If he were afraid of their sects, he wouldn’t have done any of this in the first place.

“Sigh, your ancestors should calm down and be smarter. I don’t really want to roast all of you since we’re from the same generation.” Dong Ling shook his head before taking another gulp.

The prisoners felt the same way and lamented their helpless situation. They could only pray that their seniors can come up with an incredible plan to save them.
