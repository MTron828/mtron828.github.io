Chapter 4965: Meat Skewer

Li Qiye became trapped in the dual-affinity attack, seemingly dropping his dao controller.

“No!” One student who saw the development clearly shouted.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Go!” Stone Lion God and the others waited for this exact moment.

“Whoosh!” Arrow Saint released his cursed shot instantly.

Students heard the wind-breaking sound after the arrow appeared in front of Li Qiye’s throat, nearly piercing his skin.

“Boom!” Stone Lion God released his cosmic seal from above, turning everything along the way to dust.

“Poof!” Maddened God gathered all of his flames into a single beam. This alone was enough since it surpassed the mysteries of yin and yang. In fact, it could burn both dao fruits and sacred fruits.

Keep in mind that these cultivated fruits were the toughest things in the world. It required something unimaginable to destroy them. This fiery beam was one of them.

Some believed that if immortals were real, the maddened flames could still burn them down.

Darkness enveloped the scene since lights have been destroyed by the various attacks.

“He’s finished.” Everyone felt despair for Li Qiye. In fact, they worried for their own safety.

The schoolmaster couldn’t do anything since he wasn’t strong enough to fight five dragon lords.

In this crucial moment, Li Qiye somehow managed to grab the dao controller firmly. This astounded the five dragon lords since Reincarnation City Lord used his dao to change the flow of time while Oblivion Monarch pulled Li Qiye in with his special eye.

They also witnessed the plan unraveling successfully with Li Qiye losing his grip. How did this happen when Li Qiye was so weak?

“Skyquake, control.” Li Qiye’s soft words could be heard by everyone.

“Boom!” The artifact rotated and so did the world. The myriad laws and time became affected by its flow.

The cosmic seal, fiery beam, and cursed arrow along with everything else collapsed in the blink of an eye.

“Ahhhh!” An unstoppable centrifugal force sent them flying, grievously injured.

Alas, they didn’t have time to get up, let alone dodge the incoming laws.

Their next screams echoed as the laws pierced their body and raised them up into the air. Their blood dripped downward and painted the five laws red.

“...” The students were overwhelmed with a mixture of emotions as they watched the once mighty dragon lords being skewed into the air like roast meat. The scene was one that would be ingrained in their memories forever. Some students involuntarily voiding their bladder from sheer terror.

The schoolmaster himself was visibly shaken and pale. He witnessed the power of the old sweeper previously. However, that was a proper power gained from dao mastery and exuded a feeling of safety.

The same couldn’t be said about the violence dished out by the dao controller. He thought that he might have nightmares tonight about sharing the same fate.

“Impossible!” Stone Lion God bellowed.

They didn’t know how the laws pierced their body so easily, given its toughness.

Such a mighty weapon couldn’t possibly exist. The strongest conqueror weapon didn’t have the ability to defeat them in this manner.

The issue was that they inaccurately attributed their defeat to the dao controller instead of Li Qiye’s actual ability.

Maddened God screamed and struggled to break free. Alas, the law rendered this impossible.

“Crack!” Cracks appeared on his body as he gave up his physical shell, wanting to escape with his true fate.

The other dragon gods saw this and did the same. Their true fate flew away with incredible speed.

Unfortunately, the laws were even faster and instantly pierced their true fate and scared fruits.

“Not like this!”

“No!”

They bellowed in despair because there was no reversing this any longer.

“Didn’t I say that today is your last?” Li Qiye smiled and shook the dao controller again.

The power of the artifact coursed through them and destroyed their true fate and sacred fruits as they screamed in agony.

Their cultivation and toughness no longer mattered. Eventually, the bloodied laws receded from the corpse, signaling the end of the battle.

Students became statues after seeing this, unable to regain their wits. Five dragon lords have been taken down like ants.
