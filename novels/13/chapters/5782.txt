Chapter 5783: Moon Embrace

Everyone saw World Emperor standing there but for some reason, there seemed to be a second copy stacking on top of him.

The second had a majestic landscape behind him with dragons and phoenixes - a paradise protected by Grand Emperors.

They appeared to be real and breathing, not just mere images and avatars. Moreover, countless descendants lived in this majestic world, some of whom were gods and sages.

Next were billions of mortals living in prosperous kingdoms. They all worshipped a single being - World Emperor.

The duplication process eluded spectators. They only noted that time and space were being twisted and the two emperors became one.

This new being wore Moon Embrace, releasing a boundless ocean capable of storing the thirteen continents. Its high waves could extinguish the burning sun. Within this ocean was a bright moon, adding a silver glow to the water.

It looked as if the ocean was embracing the moon, hence the name of the immortal armament.

“Clank!” World held a heavenly shield with his left hand. Just raising it could erect an unsurpassable barrier or knock down a star.

In his right hand was a white heavenly sword crafted from stars, capable of splitting the earth.

“Moon Embrace!” He roared, attacking with both sword and shield. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“One Dao!” Profound immediately combined nine heavenly dao and treasures into one.

“Rumble!” He gained the dao of the high heaven and unleashed a tribulation at World Emperor.

“Eternal Moon!” World didn’t slow down, attempting to slash the tribulation.

“Boom!” The world had a difficult time containing their power. The impact pulverized the surrounding space.

On another side, Nightmoon Conqueror was furious, utilizing her primordial dao fruit to empower the bottle, smashing it against Sword Emperor.

Although Sword Emperor had the mighty defensive talisman imbued with a primordial force, he was still being pushed backward. Without it, he would have been reduced to bits.

She fought in a frenzy, going as far as burning her true blood to muster every ounce of strength from her primordial dao fruit - a truly heavy price to pay in her quest for vengeance.

“Rumble!” Sword survived the onslaught but blood streamed down his mouth.

Meanwhile, Hao Hai and Ren Xian fought evenly. The former looked unstoppable with his epoch blade, never running out of power.

Ren Xian was protected by his Azure Omniplate while exerting his sword dao to the limit. Alas, Divine Beast left him covered in lacerations and blood.

Of course, Hao Hai didn’t fare any better. Divine Beast’s potential exceeded his expectations, definitely one grade above the immortal firmaments.

His body was being pushed to the brink while channeling its epoch power, leaving him pale while vomiting blood.

As for the main battlefield, Demon’s primordial tree fully suppressed the enemies.

Earlier, the saber attack from an Ancestor and the appearance of Profound Emperor gave Celestial Court’s members a second to breathe. Titanic and Light-dragon regrouped, adding the power of the twelve entities along with Primeval Cauldron to the flood of steel.

Unfortunately, Demon’s group had understood the essences of the primordial. Their teamwork was impeccable as they burned their true blood to crush the new barriers with the primordial tree, sending the enemies flying.

“Now, crush Celestial Court!” Demon ordered, issuing another barrage at Celestial Palace itself.

A strange noise came from above during this critical juncture. Four ships appeared, carrying a large machine.

Just how large was it? As it was carried across space, it shattered numerous stars.

“Bam!” It landed in front of Celestial Palace, blocking Demon’s path. Their primordial tree looked tiny compared to this colossal machine.

Back in Imperial Field, Resolute’s group had formed a massive machine yet that still couldn’t compare to this one.

Most importantly, it looked to have many parts assembled while thing one looked to be a single frame just like the ones from Imperial Attendant City. It was like the machine was born - another living entity not built by men.

Furthermore, although it seemed inactive, it already emitted an unparalleled aura in the form of celestial flames sweeping through the region.
