Chapter 5248: How Strange

Did Suppression Conqueror only care about authority and influence? Of course not.

As an accomplished cultivator, he naturally didn’t care for political matters. The throne of Imperial Attendant was indeed a shining jewel atop a crown. However, his main goal was to understand and grasp the mysteries of the city. From that, he would be able to seek a higher dao. For example, the metal giants outside the palace or this ship…

Ever since the takeover, he had never stopped researching these matters. He pursued every single detail in the palace and city, the same for the machines outside.

He once thought about taking everything as his own. Alas, he came to understand that the city must have been built here for a reason. Even if he were to take all the treasures, they would be nothing more than scrap metals.

The ship floating above Li Qiye was one of his main research subjects. He knew that there was something more to it and that he needed to understand its fundamentals before activation.

If he could somehow learn to use the ship and the giants, he would be able to establish a power no inferior to Imperial or Divine Alliance.

The giants’ power and effectiveness were proven by City Lord Zi Yan who had controlled them during several wars. With their help, he would be able to reach the height of Illumination and Light-dragon Conqueror.

He couldn’t fathom how his years of research were inferior to a single handwave from this youth. Did the ship look down on him and his sincere effort?

“The emperor is back!” At the same time, Resplendent Monarch and his allies were moved to tears. This was another proof that they got the right man.

As members of the main branch, their mission was to protect the city. They knew that everything here was special.

Back when they were in charge, they had tried to understand the treasures as well. Only City Lord Zi Yan was known to have success.

Now, this young man was able to activate the ship of the city, meaning that he must be the emperor in the legends. They have witnessed a miracle and finished their mission.

Li Qiye spread his palm and released tiny laws. Suddenly, the ship above him suddenly crumbled into little pieces.

Before gazes of disbelief, the pieces fell into his palm and turned into small particles. They wrapped around his hand and turned into a fiery gauntlet.

“!” Suppression stood up with his eyes wide open from disbelief.

The ship had turned into a gauntlet - a perfect fit for Li Qiye’s hand. Suppression had never thought of this possibility before.

His theory was that this ship was an ultimate treasure meant for fleeing world-ending disasters. Now, it was clearly a weapon.

“Have you seen anything like this before?” Li Zhitian asked.

The audience members had seen plenty of treasures but nothing like this. Of course, they didn’t know that it was from a different epoch.

“That’s amazing…” Even Skyhorn General couldn’t help but exclaim after seeing this. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Have a taste of my horn!” He calmed down and became blurry to the audience.

They saw numerous images due to his incredible speed.

“Phantom Thrust!” A few big shots recognized this move.

“Clank!” The ground trembled violently and sparks splashed outward. Most didn’t see the attack until it was already before Li Qiye’s chest.

His speed was impeccable but most importantly, he gathered all of his strength onto a single point - the horn. This could break through any dao defense and deliver a fatal blow.

Spectators felt a chill in their heart as if they have been pierced and thrust high into the air by his horn.

However, the thrust was easily stopped by Li Qiye and his gauntlet. His movement was fast enough to also leave behind afterimages before grasping the horn.

Before people could digest the event, he lifted the general up and slammed him repeatedly to the ground.

“Bang!” After he became bored, he tossed the bloodied cultivator outside. The latter couldn’t get up while groaning in agony.

From start to finish, it appeared that Li Qiye didn’t use any of his own strength. Everything came from the fiery gauntlet alone.

The crowd exchanged glances after seeing the swift defeat of one of the generals.

However, another general appeared on the other side of the main hall - a centipede with a twisted frame possessing numerous arms and legs. Despite his grotesque appearance, he was adorned with majestic silver armor.

He held numerous bows - small enough to look like children's toys.
