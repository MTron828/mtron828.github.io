Chapter 4690: Three-headed Heavenly Scripture

It was as if he weighed billions of pounds, hence the destructive steps. People thought that he lived up to his fame, showing off his power before the actual fight.

He appeared next to Li Qiye in the blink of an eye. His opponent still had a smile, not intimidated in the slightest. He also had zero aura compared to the paragon’s suppressive presence.

Their auras were akin to a dragon facing an ant. Of course, Li Qiye was no ant.

By this point, some ancestors felt as if Li Qiye’s lack of aura meant that he was one with the grand dao. Since his rhythm coincided with nature, it didn’t become conspicuous.

His calm demeanor also told them how little he cared about Wild Paragon. There was an inscrutable air to him now - a complete shift of perspective due to new information.

“Li Qiye!” Wild Paragon roared nefariously and grew larger. His heads became as tall as the sky and his feet crushed the ground.

Many watched his colossal form with bated breath, thinking that he might be the strongest genius when not counting the conquerors.

The battle between these two might start the competition for the dao lord position. This would serve as an effective scale for people to judge the power of the top contenders. How strong would one be in terms of the sovereign realm?

At another peak, True Immortal Young Emperor and True Immortal Saintess also observed this development with great interest.

“What do you think?” The saintess had a serious expression.

“A good time to see Li Qiye’s true ability.” The young emperor responded.

“What?” Li Qiye smiled while facing the three-headed giant.

Anyone else would have been quivering with fear since they wouldn’t be able to handle the pressure. They might even kneel and surrender right away.

“This is a fight to the death.” Wild Paragon uttered. Each word had the force of an axe slashing down.

“You want to die so soon?” Li Qiye smirked, seemingly deciding the paragon’s fate.

“Hahaha, those who have talked to me like this are slumbering in their graves right now.” The paragon laughed heartily. Even his laughter made the crowd uncomfortable.

“Your insolence has sentenced you to death.” His eyes narrowed and the temperature suddenly became cold.

“I will forgive your insolence if you cut off one of your heads right now.” Li Qiye retorted. Though his delivery wasn’t as merciless, it was far more vexing.

“That depends on whether you can cut my heads off before I wring your neck.” The paragon said, painting a gruesome scene.

“Make your move then.” Li Qiye said.

“Prepare your weapon and we shall start.” Though the paragon was enraged, he was still from a famous sect and didn’t attack right away.

“I just need these to decapitate you.” Li Qiye waved his hands in response. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The paragon trembled with rage while the crowd exchanged glances. This level of contempt was a new experience for Wild Paragon.

“Very well, take this then!” He shouted and gathered energy in his eyes.

“Whoosh!” Six beams shot out toward Li Qiye, piercing through space and everything along the way.

Li Qiye’s figure became illusory and the beams pierced through him, destroying all the peaks in the back.

“Die!” The paragon didn’t stop. His eyes shot out more dao rays that intertwine and entrapped Li Qiye. Escaping was impossible.

“Three-headed Heavenly Scripture!” An ancestor recognized the move.

Wild Paragon cultivated an ancient scripture with this name. Its power was comparable to dao lord merit laws.

Moreover, he was a heavenly devil and had an exceptional bloodline. This scripture was perfect for his race.

Li Qiye saw this and merely raised his hand, looking as if he was trying to block the sun rays.

“Boom!” The rays eventually struck him, crushing the entire peak beneath. Debris and dust were scattered everywhere.

“What do you think?” An expert asked his friends. Those eyes beams earlier were rather impressive.
