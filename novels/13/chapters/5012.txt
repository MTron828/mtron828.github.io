Chapter 5013: Mysterious Stone Tablet

Everyone knew that this was no simple matter given Golden Cicada’s ability and generous proposal.

He cleared his throat and said: “I have an unsolvable problem, hence needing everyone’s help.”

“There is a problem you can’t solve?” Skystomper God asked.

Golden Cicada was inferior to none here. After all, he was a brother to a commanding god.

“It’s a stone tablet.” He said before telling a disciple to carry it up.

It didn’t look so special outside of its old age. However, upon closer inspection, something seemed off. The stone tablet appeared to have been chiseled from somewhere, with the front side being smooth and the back side rough and pitted.

Moreover, while the front side appeared polished, there was something strange covering the surface - a cluster of black dots being trapped beneath.

The dragon lords immediately spotted something special about the tablet while others didn’t think much of it.

“I haven’t been able to figure out this tablet. Today is a rare occasion where so many capable heroes have gathered. Anyone who can open this tablet will win my two god sources.” He said.

Meanwhile, the dragon lords couldn’t avert their gaze from it.

“Where did you find this?” Pagoda Guardian felt something frightening and ominous from it.

“I came across it by chance.” Golden Cicada said.

“No, you must have dug this from the depths of the Ten Great Mountains. What are you trying to do?” Wild Dragon felt something amiss.

“I just want to satiate my curiosity.” Golden Cicada smiled.

Most felt that there was something off about the tablet as well. After all, they were strong enough to sense certain fluctuations.

“This is a seal.” Jun Cuican, the most talented here, said.

“You’re right, Virtuous Nephew. It took me a while before confirming this while you only need a short moment.” Golden Cicada praised.

“It is not easy to break it down.” Cuican enjoyed being recognized for his talent.

“I don’t think we should break the seal. Perhaps it is trapping something ominous.” Tendril King said after utilizing her righteous merit law - Emperors Art. It had a negative reaction to the tablet.

The others exchanged glances but didn’t answer.

“Whoever can release this seal will obtain the two god sources, right?” Radiant Monarch said. His bright eyes were always the center of attention.

“That is correct.” Golden Cicada nodded: “I appreciate your assistance.”

“Fine, I will try first.” Wild Dragon appeared in front of the tablet and immediately released extreme heat. The ground beneath him turned into lava instantly.

Most guests were immobilized by his aura and couldn’t even move to a safe distance.

He opened his mouth and spew out a raging inferno. This was different from his regular flames since it was entirely concentrated into a single beam.

The other six-fruit dragon lords’ expression changed after seeing this.

“True draconic flame!” Radiant Monarch became startled.

Wild Dragon truly possessed the bloodline of a true dragon. Though it was sparse, it gave him access to this special flame. Cultivators couldn’t release something of this level with their dao flames.

The flames of a true dragon could refine the yin and yang. Very few metals in existence could endure this heat. Alas, it failed to damage the tablet, let alone break the seal.

“What the hell is this seal?” Eventually, he recalled his true draconic flame in disbelief.

Nonetheless, they did gain new information - a force from the tablet that seemed to be demonic in origin.

“Let me try.” Radiant Monarch became competitive and joined the contest.

“Activate.” He chanted and his light erupted, temporarily blinding the audience. No other lights in the world could compare.

His light shined the realms with its piercing rays. The fabrics of time and space became transparent and purified.

If the world was initially a rough stone, the gentle permeation of this light would eventually turn it into a smooth jade with unparalleled grace.

The others became emotional. Even the dragon lords wanted to stay away, not wanting to be affected by his light.

Unfortunately, his overwhelming light only managed to slightly nudge the tiny black dots beneath the surface. This was its limit.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“How strange, there is an unknown power in the tablet.” Radiant Monarch stopped.

The rest exchanged glances. If Wild Dragon and Radiant Monarch couldn’t do it, the same would apply to them.

“It is even more difficult than my expectation.” Golden Cicada was slightly disappointed.

“Our cultivation is not bad, but there is someone stronger than all of us here.” Tendril King suggested.

“Who?” Guardian Pagoda asked while narrowing his eyes.

“Bloodfly God.” Tendril King answered: “Why not invite the commanding god to join us?”

Everyone agreed with this and stared at Golden Cicada. They didn’t disagree with her power assessment in the slightest.
