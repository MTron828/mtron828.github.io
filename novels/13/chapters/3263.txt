No one could stay calm at this juncture as they stared at the radiant scroll.

It slowly floated down and landed in Li Qiye’s hand. “Buzz.” The scroll turned into runes and entered his mind.

This was the most direct way to pass down an art. The scroll wasn’t the original version, only runes that could be imprinted in this manner.

Since this art was one of the strongest merit laws in Divine Black, the actual copy was naturally hidden in the most secretive place.

So many salivated at this sight. Very few in the sect were eligible to learn it for most weren’t qualified.

Even the seniors felt envious. They couldn’t cultivate it yet but just grasping a version was good enough. Perhaps in the future, they would be able to comprehend it.

“Only one person in our sect has cultivated it before.” One protector murmured.

“Yes, only Bodhi King. Moreover, he only learned one of the nine, Cassia.” A different expert nodded.

Numerous tales sprung off this origin. Some said that because the Black Tortoise followed the great immortal into battle, the latter taught the tortoise, allowing it to create the nine arts. Or, it could be that the immortal was the one who created the laws and passed them down to the tortoise.

Some listed it as a high-level heaven merit law. A few ancestors disputed this. They believed that the merit law came from the Ancient Era and couldn’t be classified using the current system of this epoch.

Nonetheless, its mighty power was beyond doubt.

It didn’t take long before people stared at Li Qiye with both envy and jealousy in their eyes. A new disciple had just received the nine immortal laws. How lucky could one get?

There were those who couldn’t accept this reality, thinking that the statue or stone was off in some ways. How could a Mortal Shell activate all thirteen sections?

Alas, the truth was that Li Qiye really did receive the nine Primeval Laws just now.

Yang Si’s expression was as ugly as can be. He purposely tried to make it difficult for Li Qiye but ended up just doing the guy a favor.

Li Qiye checked the nine laws and smiled: “So this is your Nine Primeval Laws?” Li Qiye smiled.

Fuyou could only smile wryly after seeing the guy’s casual expression. He had just gotten their best merit laws yet still acted as if it was no big deal.

All in northern West King understood the value of these nine laws, just not this guy.

“Did I pass?” Li Qiye then returned to his carriage and lazily glanced over at the examiner.

“Yes, yes, absolutely!” The stunned examiner blurted out.

C’mon now, if someone who had just activated thirteen sections still couldn’t join their sect, no one else would be qualified.

Plus, he got their merit laws now. They definitely wanted to keep him around instead of risking these laws being spread outside.

“Let’s go set up a place for you guys.” Fuyou shouted at the children. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The group cheered and followed Fuyou into their dream. They have finally become official disciples of Divine Black.

Huang Jie still stood there in a daze, shocked by the result. He fully believed in Fuyou’s words now and started admiring Li Qiye.

“So what if he got the Nine Primeval Laws, the strongest ones are still just trash in his possession since he can’t study them.” Yang Si scowled while watching Li Qiye enter the sect.

“Right, our top members aren’t strong enough to learn it, let alone a new disciple. It’s useless to him.” Many disciples agreed.

Since it was considered a high-level heaven law, only one of the five peak lords managed to cultivate it - Myriad Demons Peak Lord, Thousand Arms Bodhi King.

Moreover, Bodhi King only cultivated one of the nine laws, Cassia. Rumor has it that he was actually not strong enough for these merit laws. However, his unique bloodline allowed him to bypass this requirement for Cassia.

“Maybe there’s something wrong with the ancestral stone?” One expert asked.

The main examiner glanced at the stone and said: “We’ll find out soon.”

His eyes locked onto the runes on the statue. They seemed to have changed a bit compared to before.

“Go!” He released the stone and it started leaping, eventually lighting up three sections.

“It’s fine.” The examiner said with confidence.

“So he really got thirteen.” The seniors stared at the statue; their expression varied. They didn’t know whether this was a sheer stroke of luck or the will of the heaven.

Some immediately ran back to report to the higher-ups.

The news of this examination traveled through the sect like a storm. Most couldn’t believe it after hearing the first time. They still felt the same way after confirming it.

In the main peak surrounded by clouds and mist, Ping Suoweng stood by the edge and stared at a floating sword. His eyes didn’t move in the slightest.

“An ordinary disciple able to activate all thirteen sections.” He pondered after receiving the news.

“Maybe it’s just a coincidence.” The messenger said.

“Definitely not, this is a supreme dao chapter with ultimate profundity. No luck, only comprehension.” Suoweng smiled and shook his head.

“That’s even more outrageous.” The messenger responded.

Suoweng didn’t respond and continued staring at the floating sword. His powerful aura made him look unfathomable.

The messenger had nothing but respect because their sect master was also the strongest member of their sect, always wise in his choices.

Myriad Demons Peak, a place of verdant trees and beautiful valleys.

There seemed to be a bodhi tree growing on the pinnacle facing the recently-risen sun, absorbing the mists and clouds. This was their peak lord - Thousand Arms Bodhi King.

“The Nine Primeval Laws?” His eyes became profound.

“Yes, Peak Lord.” A disciple respectfully said.

The peak lord used to be the only one who was training the Nine Primeval Laws. Now, a newly-recruited disciple has obtained the full version.

The protectors, elders, and even the peak lords took this matter very seriously.

“A miracle, really. Even Little Qianyue only activated five sections.” The bodhi king found this astonishing.

“It has to be luck, he can’t possibly compare to Qianyue.” The disciple speculated.
