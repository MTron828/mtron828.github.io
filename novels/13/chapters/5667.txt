Chapter 5668: I Am Both Buddha and Dharma

The entrance to the village painted a scene of serenity. Visitors would get the feeling of returning home while standing in a place with green trees and yellow leaves fluttering in the breeze.

Wildflowers bloomed nearby, exuding the scene of home. Foxtail grass swayed gently, seemingly welcoming visitors.

A nostalgic sentiment would strike anyone hard, making them want to rush into the village to meet fellow villagers and elders. Once calmed down, they would stroll through the path leading to the entrance, protected from the sun by lush trees on both sides.

The fresh air made them want to breathe deeply several times, smelling the fragrance of the verdant wilderness.

This harkened back to the days of old, a youthful time when one would have a foxtail grass in their mouth, spending time in leisure and carefreeness. They could either rest in the shade of a tree or plunge into a stream to catch fish. Memories of a playful childhood resurfaced.

All of the above prompted Li Qiye to smile during his entry. The yellow leaves landed on his shoulder and slowly seeped into his body like melting snow.

The entire process was silent and comforting, causing others to let out a sigh in comfort instead of brushing them off. It instilled a remarkably refreshing feeling like taking a sip of clear spring water.

The grass and flowers beneath touched his ankles, causing a tingling sensation. Crackles could be heard as if lightning was shifting from the grassy ground to the visitors.

Walking here meant becoming one with heaven and earth. The ground and all things growing on it became a part of one’s body, granting omniscient sight.

One would gradually forget who they were as they gained insight into this area, listening to buzzing cicadas or the rippling streams nearby.

They could find themselves lazily lying on a soft cloud to gaze at the ocean and azure, blissfully enjoying the afternoon sunlight and the gentle breezes.

They became the lords of this world - all things became possible after a single thought. Sadness and difficulties disappeared in this beautiful world.

Potential became limitless as long as one was willing to stay. This was a world forged with thoughts.

Li Qiye smiled and played along - forming a supreme immortal kingdom with countless emperors and monarchs.

Three thousand worlds contained numerous reincarnation cycles and karmic ties. Even the legendary immortals were subservient to Li Qiye’s whims.

He chuckled and changed direction - creating a majestic grand dao encompassing his imaginary worlds.

“Rumble!” Unfortunately, the spatial and temporal fabrics of reality couldn’t withstand the dao. The mortal coil and all else were on the verge of being crushed.

During this calamity, a Buddhist light erupted along with countless hymns. A kingdom of Buddhism emerged.

Within were towering Buddhas and monks. One ancient Buddha was taller than heaven itself. The mantras chanted by him and his followers became an ocean of sincerity and devotion.

Impure thoughts were washed away; one couldn’t help wanting to kneel and join this Buddha.

Unfortunately, it started suffering damage due to Li Qiye’s thoughts.

“Rumble!” The monks, Buddhas, and the giant were reduced to nothingness by the grand dao.

“Buddhism is infinite!” Only a young man remained in the western paradise, as handsome as could be.

His Buddhist robe had no dazzling treasures or trinkets. This only made him appear more transcendent. The location around him turned into paradise.

He placed his palms together and chanted, releasing an incredible power and radiance. Ten million miles turned into a Buddhist kingdom again. All living beings wanted to take refuge in Buddhism and kneeled before him.

However, Li Qiye was unaffected and attacked with another thought - reducing the Buddhist kingdom and its rhythm.

The youth drifted backward, still in the sitting position. He maintained a certain distance away from Li Qiye.

“Repent and see the other shore!” As he retreated gracefully, his teachings continued to resonate melodiously.

Buddhism permeated into Li Qiye’s body, wanting to embrace and enlighten him. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I am both Buddha and dharma.” Li Qiye smiled and chanted back, dispelling the affinity around him.

A single utterance from Li Qiye summoned a surging wave of Buddhism. Even the greatest Buddhist emperors would have no choice but to submit before him. His Buddhism became the only righteous path; all others were mere fabrications.

The youth continued to retreat, unable to handle Li Qiye’s dao.

“Rumble!” The paradise continued to break down. This included a colossal peak.

Once it collapsed, golden radiance oozed out and illuminated the world. Within was another Buddha whose head touched the starry sky.

He was clad in a kasaya which seemed to function as an armor, covering his entire body. The colossal being had a majestic aura and an oppressive force unique to Buddhism.

He held a vajra staff, looking ready to subdue evil. One strike alone could annihilate demon kings and shatter their realms. No malevolent beings could escape his wrath.

“Be gone, evil!” He let out a long roar and smashed forward, releasing the destructive power of his affinity.

“Boom!” Another kingdom manifested into reality behind him, empowering his descending staff.
