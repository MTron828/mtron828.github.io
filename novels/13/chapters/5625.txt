Chapter 5626: Dream About You

For many cultivators in the nine worlds, the wings of the dark crow instilled fear in them. This was the dark hand behind the curtains - the ultimate mastermind.9

However, the girl who was trapped in despair and hopelessness viewed the wings as the safest haven. They carried her away from the darkness and the clutch of the death god. The dark crow descended from heaven and illuminated her life.0

However, she had no time to spend with him as the war continued and she was sealed. She assumed that she would never be able to see him again.0

Today, she saw the familiar face again and his arms were just like two wings, sheltering her from trauma.0

“Your Excellency.” She burst into tears from joy, expressing her emotion with a single word.0

“It’s him.” Ancient emperors and monarchs thought about a particular legend.0

Those who were born in the nine worlds or the thirteen continents recalled something long ago. The legend had disappeared and they thought that he was no longer around.0

Today, it seemed that the dark crow was still alive and had returned to their world.0

“Sacred Teacher.” An emperor bowed in Li Qiye’s direction.1

“Sacred Teacher?” The others have heard of this title by chance in the past and only had a vague impression of this existence.5

“Sacred Teacher.” Other ancient emperors and monarchs followed suit and lowered their head to show respect.1

Other cultivators couldn’t believe it. This ordinary youth warranted this much reverence from the strongest members of Thousand Emperor Island?0

As for Li Qiye, he wiped away Demon’s tears and said: “Be happy, no need to shed tears.”0

Demon’s face was filled with joy. She smiled and nodded vigorously; her mood infected the crowd.0

Some had no idea what they were seeing - an apex cultivator crying happily like a little girl. Remember, this was someone who had assaulted Celestial Court in the past - an unstoppable conqueror.1

Li Qiye turned his sight toward Titanic, who appeared confused just like everyone else.1

She still possessed an imposing presence but her eyes revealed a hint of perplexity. This man simply looked familiar as if she had seen him often.0

“Who are you? I have seen you before.” She asked.1

“Where?” He focused his gaze, seemingly piercing her body.0

She staggered backward, startled for all of her secrets laid bare before him. As an apex conqueror, she could evade any attempt at calculation or spying. Her power would crush those who tried to calculate her secrets.0

This didn’t work against Li Qiye and this infuriated her.0

“I see, in your dreams.” Li Qiye said: “Then it is fate.”0

“How can this be?” She murmured since he was correct. She had dreamed about him since her youth - not the present Li Qiye but someone just like him. Her young self had no issues with this, attributing them to mere dreams. 0

After becoming a conqueror, she realized that this was a significant issue - a man whom she had never met before appeared in her dreams repeatedly.0

Cultivators could control all their senses and eliminate unnecessary thoughts. They possessed absolute control over their dreams - whether to not dream at all or see whatever they wanted.0Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Unfortunately, she still couldn’t banish the man from her dreams where she theoretically had absolute dominion.5

She had traveled the world while keeping in mind the image of this man, wanting to find him. Today, she confirmed that this man was the one in her dreams.0

She didn’t know how to describe her current emotions - confusion, astonishment, or fear…0

Perhaps it was a mix of everything. She recalled how he used a karmic force to send the two of them flying. This must be the reason why she couldn’t chase him out of her dream - he was far stronger.0

This still didn’t explain why he appeared in the first place. Did they share the same bloodline? Was he an ancestor?0

She denied this idea because her imperial clan never had someone like this before. Moreover, after hearing “Sacred Teacher” from the other emperors, she knew about this legend's background and stories. They definitely had no familial relationship.0

“Why were you in my dreams?” She stared at the unfathomable legend capable of miraculous feats.
