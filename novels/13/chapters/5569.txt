Chapter 5570: Stomp

Many big shots retreated away from the destructive aura instead of withstanding it. A conqueror could destroy mountains and rivers with a single hand wave; his imperial aura was unbearable.

“Boom!” Niu Fen teleported and released a supreme grand dao while delivering a vertical kick.

The dao floated into the air with a rotating galaxy, immediately crushing Turmoil’s torrential aura. This was akin to an inferno being wiped out by a stronger hurricane, rendering Turmoil helpless.

Turmoil felt as if a divine boulder of immeasurable weight was crushing his chest and suffocating him.

“Crack!” His golden chariot crumbled into countless pieces as well.

It wasn’t only a transportation artifact but also a powerful treasure made from divine metals. It was blessed by emperors as well, granting it immense defensive potential.

Thus, everyone couldn’t believe their own eyes after seeing Niu Fen crushing it with a single stomp.

They thought that he was being arrogant and ignorant before and the furious conqueror would cut him down as punishment. The opposite occurred instead.

Turmoil had leaped backward and dodged the stomp. Nonetheless, his expression soured after seeing the destruction of his chariot.

“Dao Brother, please state your title to avoid any further misunderstanding.” Turmoil changed his address to show respect, aware of his opponent’s superior cultivation.

Spectators watched with bated breath. Some thought that this inconspicuous old demon might have ten dao fruits or so. Others calculated that he needed at least this many fruits to destroy Turmoil’s precious chariot so easily.

“Who is he?” They took a deep breath. Someone with ten dao fruits should be world-famous - a conqueror or dao lord hiding his true identity.

Turmoil’s intention was clear. Niu Fen just needed to state his true background and Turmoil would back off, putting an end to this confrontation.

Unfortunately, Niu Fen didn’t play along and said with a smile: “Misunderstanding? There is none. My young master wants me to teach you a lesson, I told you to slap yourself but you refused so now, I gotta deliver a sufficient beating.”

Turmoil’s expression became ugly while the big shots nearby exchanged glances.

The initial demand was ridiculous. A prestigious conqueror would never slap himself in public as an apology. Honor was more important than life itself.

“Just who is this?” The hidden top cultivators shuddered. To be so confident against Turmoil and West Bank, this old demon might actually have twelve dao fruits.

“Escalation is unnecessary.” Turmoil didn’t wish to fight a losing battle: “Dao Lord, we should change our method to deal with this issue.”

“Haha, it’s too late for that.” Niu Fen laughed: “I will give you the first attack so that others won’t chastise me for bullying a junior. Just know that the young master is merciful for not taking your life after your insolence.”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This caused others to focus on Li Qiye and become frustrated. Niu Fen’s power was obvious - at least ten fruits. However, why was he addressing this ordinary youth as “young master”?

This didn’t make any sense since they couldn’t spot anything special about Li Qiye. Turmoil glanced at him and noticed nothing out of the ordinary.

“Brat, make your move so your grandpa can teach you a lesson.” Niu Fen gestured provocatively with a smile.

“So be it, Dao Brother, you left me no choice!” Turmoil had never been treated with such contempt previously.

He had no other choice either - unable to ask for forgiveness or slap himself. The only option was to fight.

“Boom!” The moment he took out a talisman, runes the size of stars appeared above him. They descended like meteors, wanting to reduce Niu Fen to dust.

“Good.” Niu Fen laughed and activated his shell. It became resplendent as he hid inside.

This looked rather funny to the audience who had no idea of its unbreakable toughness.

The runes from the talisman surrounded him and started spinning like maelstroms.

“Rumble!” They started sucking in and crushing everything nearby.

However, the shell’s radiance and dao prevented them from hurting Niu Fen.

“Boom!” The talisman itself slammed into the shell, causing the spatial fabrics to cave in. Alas, it didn’t leave a single mark on its target.
