Chapter 5900: I Won’t Look Back

Countless stars illuminated the duo, making them look transcending. As they walked amidst the night enjoying the breeze while holding hands, a feeling of reluctance surfaced. None wanted this moment to end.

The mortal coil seemed so far away for they were with the stars. This stroll could last for eternity.

“You should go now.” She said as their fingers intertwined and their eyes locked.

“Yes, one step closer to the conclusion.” Li Qiye glanced upward.

“Do you need to do anything before facing the heaven?” Her eyes rippled with light like autumn water, making it impossible to look away.

“Let me return to being a mortal once, that’s better than being an immortal.” Li Qiye said sentimentally.

“Being a mortal…” She murmured during her reflection. The sentence flashed like a lightning bolt inside her mind.

“It will take some time, but no rush after reaching this point already.” Li Qiye smiled: “I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time, this is my pursuit and belief.”

“Yes, ride the momentum and fight to the end.” She nodded while having complete confidence in him.

“I will since I’ve lived a little too long already.” Li Qiye became slightly emotional as he spoke with a hinge of disappointment.

“You’ve grown weary.” She hugged him.

The hug lasted for a while before they let go. He stared at her perfect face and said: “Living too long is a punishment so perhaps there is no need to seek everlasting life. That might be a curse.”

“I understand.” She sighed and asked: “You won’t be looking back this time?”

“When this battle is over, there will be a conclusion. I won’t need to look back.” He said.

“I’m sure you will get your wish.” Their fingers intertwined again.

He gazed into her eyes for a moment before asking: “What about you?”

The two seemed to become one as they locked gazes.

“My dao has reached its end. The path to be taken has been walked by others. I cannot surpass what you will do.” She said.

“Your dao might be over but you can still seek something.” He gently touched her hair.

“I await your victory.” She revealed a smile eclipsing heaven and earth.

“You will have to wait a bit longer then.” He lamented while looking at the sky.

“And I shall.” She nodded and made a promise. Her gentle words could cause others to melt - one couldn’t ask for more in life.

He raised her hand and kissed it before replying: “I will move forward, never looking back.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I know. Wherever you are, I am there as well.” She said firmly.

“Very well.” Li Qiye’s eyes gazed into the endless crevices, capable of seeing everything beyond.

***

Li Qiye lazily rested, forgetting that he was still in the mortal world. Next to him was a white cloud enjoying the sunlight and breezes. This was far better than drifting endlessly above.

“Some say the ultimate pursuit is immortality.” Li Qiye remarked while looking at the sky.

The cloud copied him and seemed to be staring upward too, resting its non-existent chin on non-existent hands.

After a while, it shook its head, prompting him to rub it like a cat. It enjoyed his touches, almost looking like a purring kitty.

“There’s a price for everything, only when one becomes an immortal will they appreciate the limit of life, that’s what makes it beautiful.” Li Qiye said.

The cloud looked a bit puzzled.

“I forgot that you’ve never been a human.” Li Qiye chuckled and continued: “It’s because you are immortal and have forgotten that you are alive. Time has lost meaning and when that happens, so do the colors of life.”

The cloud fell into rumination afterward.

“When there is a limit to life, the days become precious. Each passing day means a shorter lifespan. Each day becomes important and does not repeat. People can then cherish the present instead of fantasizing about the future.” He continued.

After a moment, the cloud seemed to smile after listening to the epiphany-inducing comment. It applauded by smashing the ground, showing its appreciation.

“The days become cheap and so does life for a true immortal, how ironic. Look at you, when you look back through the countless years, how many wonderful moments did you have? Any memories worth reminiscing?” He asked.
