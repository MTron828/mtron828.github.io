Chapter 4711: Heavenburn Solar Cauldron

“Crack!” Sword Dao Paragon took one step forward and caused the ground to crack.

The other paragons also assumed their assigned position for the array. Cracks also appeared beneath their feet.

From the cracks came red lights and then thick lava in a seemingly endless amount.

“Are they trying to crush the earth?” Spectators gasped after seeing the cracks. Of course, this formation could actually do so given the participants.

The cracks continued to increase in length and width until they became connected. It turned out to be a formation array while Li Qiye stood at the very center.

Spectators felt the flowing lava beneath, meaning Li Qiye was standing on no man’s land. Pieces started crumbling and were being melted.

Heat waves made the power of the lava rather apparent. Being too close meant being reduced to ashes. Trees and vegetation nearby became the first victims even though the formation has yet to be activated.

“Poof!” The paragons and the sovereigns ignited themselves with mighty dao flames. This special type of flame rushed toward Li Qiye and detonated, wanting to be the reason for his demise.

Twenty capable cultivators sealed Li Qiye with a formation and used dao flames to incinerate him. The entire area had nothing but coursing lava in just a few seconds.

“Activate!” The paragons roared and summoned certain fragments brimming with dao lord power.

This empowered the dao flames and boosted them to be at the dao lord level. A single spark could take down the hardest metal at this point. Li Qiye became trapped in a world of lava and he was not welcomed.

They then threw the fragments up in the air. These pieces came together to form something resembling a cauldron around Li Qiye, adding another type of flame into the mix.

The only target was Li Qiye but the heat of the cauldron also escaped outside. The sky started being burned, prompting the crowd to gasp.

The yin and yang were reduced to being void zones. It seemed impossible to survive while being stuck inside.

“Heavenburn Solar Cauldron!” The paragons roared and channeled their energy and vitality into the fragments.

The fragments finally latched onto each other and formed a complete cauldron. Li Qiye disappeared from sight and was subjected to refinement. If he couldn’t withstand the heat, there would be nothing left of him.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Is this a dao lord weapon?” An expert asked.

“More than that. They used a dao lord formation too so the resulting power is heavily boosted.” An eastern ancestor responded.

Many ancestors took a deep breath after receiving this information.

A dao lord formation was already strong enough, normally used to protect the sect. The efficiency soared if there was a proper treasure also refined by the same dao lord to go along with it.

“Twenty experts with a Myriad Sovereign in Wild Paragon. One formation master is dreadful enough for this dao lord formation, let alone twenty at the same time. Would you say that this is comparable to a dao lord personally using it?” One disciple asked.

“No, it won’t be as strong but this is enough to kill most people that are trapped inside.” The eastern ancestor said: “Five-sun Dao Lord casually tossed this formation into the center of an evil region and reduced it to ashes in the blink of an eye. Not a single evil villain got away.”
