Chapter 4167: Feet Washing At Sword River

The turbulent current of metal resembled a gentle stream - one to be enjoyed, not feared.

If Snowcloud didn’t see it herself, she wouldn’t have believed it. The ferocious sword energies operated like primal beasts previously, always delivering the fatal blow to uninvited intruders.

But now, this current appeared uncharacteristically gentle. The sword energies flowed quietly and softly near his feet.

When he kicked his foot forward, the energies would circle around it like water or mist. Why were they not enraged?

On the other hand, Li Qiye played the part of a naive child unaware of any danger, merely enjoying the moment.

“Here to look for a divine sword?” Li Qiye casually asked while still staring at the river.

“Mmm, I suppose.” The princess replied.

Everyone came searching for fortunes, she was no exception. However, she didn’t wish to force the issue and felt that just gaining knowledge during the trip was enough.

“I’ll get you one.” Li Qiye smiled and reached forward. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She became startled; numerous ancestors have tried to do this and ended up losing their arm or worse, their life.

This wasn’t the case for Li Qiye. His hand moved unhindered across the sword energies and scrap metals, akin to a mortal boy looking for a conch at the bottom of the river.

“Splash!” It all happened too quickly and she didn’t get a good look but he grabbed a divine sword from the river.

Sharp rays came from this sword, brimming with enough power to kill anyone.

“Clank!” He removed the scabbard and revealed a pulsing blade. The lights pierced the eyes like needles, forcing the princess to close her eyes. She became emotional and slack-jawed as a result.

The divine swords in this river could only be found with luck. Forcefully taking one away was prohibitively difficult. Alas, it was so simple for Li Qiye.

She became speechless and didn’t know how to react.

“Oh, I guess you don’t like it. We’ll look for another one then.” Li Qiye shrugged and tossed the sword back into the river.

“Wai-” She blurted but it was too late. The sword had sunk down to the bottom.

She smiled wryly, wondering if she should ask him to get it again for her.

“Young Noble, your abilities are matchless.” The word “emotional” wasn’t enough to describe her feelings right now.

Li Qiye’s actions always shocked others and left them speechless.

“May I inquire about your reason for coming here, Young Noble?” She calmed down and asked. It was obvious that he wasn’t here for treasures and swords.

After all, given his ability, he could grab every single divine sword from the river but he didn’t do so. It showed a lack of interest on his part.

“To see someone.” Li Qiye replied.

She didn’t expect this answer and immediately responded: “There’s a hidden master here?”

The burial ground has been around for millions of years. Of course, information and knowledge regarding this place were far from being adequate.

Now, Li Qiye specifically came here for the sake of meeting someone? He seemed to know the place quite well. Are they connected somehow?

“Might be someone’s already dead.” Li Qiye decided to entertain her.

“Dead?” She thought of one possibility and became astonished: “You’ll be meeting an ominous being?”

She didn’t know about living people in the burial ground. However, there were many records about these ominous beings. She had read about them before since the expeditions of the dao lords targeted these beings.

These battles were bloodied; numerous great cultivators lost their lives.

“Young Noble, are you starting an expedition?” She took a deep breath and asked, thinking that Li Qiye was qualified to do so despite not being a dao lord.

She had no idea why she felt so confident in him. In reality, not even the Five Overlords of Sword Continent could do something like this. She attributed this to blind faith.

“Fighting and killing, how senseless. We’ll just be chatting.” Li Qiye smiled.

She gained nothing from his vague comments, only that he was meeting someone related to the burial ground.

Suddenly, a paper boat floated down from upstream and made it next to Li Qiye’s feet. How did it make it through all the sharp metals and rampant energies?

She didn’t think that this was only a coincidence. It was made from hemp paper, looking quite crude. It seemed that someone had picked up a piece of paper and casually made a boat before releasing it on the river.

Li Qiye picked it up and unraveled it. There was nothing written on the surface, no word or symbol.

There were grains stuck on the surface from the shoddy craftsmanship but that was it. Nonetheless, Li Qiye still paid careful attention to her confusion.

She activated her heavenly gaze and still didn’t see anything extra.
