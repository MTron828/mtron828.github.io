Chapter 5033: A Few SecretsVịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s certainly something I’m interested in knowing.” Li Qiye said.

“...” Shadowrider didn’t know why Li Qiye was curious about his secretive lineage. No one knew of its existence for millions of years now. He was absolutely the first.

“I have a particular suspicion.” He said.

“Go ahead.” Li Qiye gave permission.

“You must be from the upper two continents.” He said, thinking that’s the only explanation behind this.

Radiant Monarch had the same guess as well but for a different reason.

“What makes you say that?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Well…” He wanted to choose his words carefully because this pertained to both his survival and his lineage.

“It’s because you believe your lineage is from the upper two continents or even the immortal one.” Li Qiye’s eyes became profound.

He took a deep breath and said: “I don’t know the details.”

“Don’t worry, you would be dead right now if I have any malice. Plus, I could have read your memories, you wouldn’t appreciate that though due to the agony entailed.”

Though Li Qiye’s tone was casual, Shadowrider still trembled in fear.

As an assassin, he was familiar with death and didn’t fear it. On the other hand, torturing meant prolonged pain and Li Qiye was a frightening existence. Having his memories pulled out forcefully would be a fate worse than death.

He had experienced pain before but still didn’t think he could endure the experience.

“I’m not sure, I’ve never seen our founder god.” He elaborated: “From the records, our founder god should be an outsider from the upper continents.”

There was no point in resisting Li Qiye. The result would be the same; it was wiser to pick the easier route.

“It’s plausible.” Li Qiye said.

The founder god of Mist was enigmatic, unlike the others who came from Demon. This person cut the tablet and left behind a deity spot.

“That’s why I want to see your lineage.” Li Qiye added.

Shadowrider was visibly unwilling to do this.

“No?” Li Qiye smiled.

“As if I can refuse.” Shadowrider said.

“You can not bring me there.” Li Qiye said: “I’m easy to work with, it’ll just take me a bit more time and effort. It’s just that if I am not careful enough, I might accidentally destroy it too.”

“Fine, I will take you there.” He conceded.

“That’s the smart choice.” Li Qiye said: “Not all are as smart as you nowadays, and especially not other assassins.”

He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at the compliment due to the tough circumstances. It was obvious what would happen to him if he didn’t obey.

“We’re connected by fate, don’t you know?” Li Qiye said softly: “I’ll take it easy on you so you can relax. I won’t kill all of Mist so you just need be enjoy our time together.”

“Yes, I’m feeling great right now.” He said begrudgingly. He had no control over his own life right now, not to mention that this madman might kill all of Mist.

“I hope so because when things are outside of our control, there is no use being all gloomy. Just be smart and flexible regardless of the circumstances.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m trying.” He smiled wryly.

“I’m sure we will work well together.” Li Qiye acted as if he was talking to an old friend: “Now, isn’t it time to bring me to your lineage?”

“Yes.” He agreed with Li Qiye’s logic. There was no point in trying to stop the unstoppable.

“Oh, don’t you want to go see that place?” He then asked.

“The killing place?” Li Qiye became serious.

“Yes, that slaughterhouse is actually right here in Demon. However, I cannot enter.” He nodded.

“I am indeed amused by this matter. It is rather interesting.” Li Qiye stroked his chin: “Don’t you want to know what this guy is doing?”

“No, and I don’t really care.” He shrugged: “One thing I’m sure of is that this isn’t about treasure or revenge.”

He wasn’t too afraid of working with this powerful being. After all, he was only a dao avatar and had confidence in his escaping techniques. Li Qiye might be the only one who managed to learn his true secret.

“Cannibalism.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

“...” He shuddered after hearing this. In reality, he had thought of this before but didn’t dwell on it.

Now that it became the main topic, it was indeed frightening for a conqueror to eat famous cultivators.

“For what reason?” He asked.

“Since you’re a pure assassin, this isn’t part of your domain. It is a lost art, a forbidden art. Alas, it has shown itself again.” Li Qiye said.
