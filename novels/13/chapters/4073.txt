Li Qiye smiled while watching the intruders trying to rush in: “I’ve said my part so if you all insist on trespassing, don’t blame me for being merciless.”

The rushers suddenly stopped with a changed expression, clearly showing hesitation.

“Who is he trying to scare?! We’re just here to observe the changes in the plain in order to avoid a potential disaster for everyone else in the region!” A crowd member shouted.

“Damn right, this is also Armament Mountain’s territory, I am responsible for observing any peculiarity. Do you have something to hide?!” A member of Armament shouted. Who knows if he was being egged on by the crowd or if it was his own thought?

Thus, the intruders became emboldened after listening to them.

“Yes, this is about the safety of the region! Nearby sects have the responsibility to do something!” An expert roared.

“Feel free to come up with whatever reason you want because I certainly have no qualms in killing any trespasser.” Li Qiye chuckled again.

“We live on the edge of the blade, you’re not scaring anyone! Plus, we have the number advantage here while you’re all alone! Come, let’s go!” Another instigated.

Just like that, several powerful cultivators continued moving forward.

“Look at how many of us are here! There has to be a reason why he won’t let us go inside. This is about the wellbeing of everyone in Armament Mountain!” An expert declared.

“This is our responsibility and duty!” One more shouted.

Most thought that a great treasury must have appeared. Li Qiye’s refusal to let them enter only confirmed this.

“He can’t stop us!” A dozen experts formed an alliance in order to break through.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” They unsheathed their weapons - swords, pagodas, bows…

“We won’t show mercy to those standing in our way.” One of them declared murderously and released their energy.

Their intent was clear - killing Li Qiye for trying to stop them.

“Very well, don’t think about leaving this place then.” Li Qiye smirked and raised his hand. It became bright due to the earth’s loop appearing in his grasp.

The fortresses and towers resonated with the loop and activated.

“Attack!” The experts didn’t waste any time and also braced themselves for battle.

“You’re courting death.” Li Qiye said.

“Boom!” The lights from the towers gathered behind Li Qiye, looking like a peacock spreading its tail. His hand became even brighter as he unleashed a mighty pulse towards the enemies.

“What?!” The attackers saw this but it was too late to turn back. They raised their weapons, resulting in a colorful spectacle. Swords and pagodas flew through the air…

Alas, their effort was futile. The pulse’s destruction couldn’t be stopped and crushed through all the defenses.

“Ahhh!” They screamed in pain as their body was reduced to pieces first before being pulverized completely.

The scene became silent right away. The hesitated intruders were horrified.

“Goddamn!” Some reacted quickly and ran out of the plain right away, paled.

No one expected Li Qiye to stick to his words so closely. After all, he was alone against the mass.

Chills and sweat coursed down their back. They thought that they were lucky for not rushing like the first group.

“There’s a grand momentum built on the plain.” Someone from the last generation immediately recognized what was going on.

“Li Qiye has control over this momentum as long as he is in there.” A peer looked around and said.

“What is his goal?” Someone else wondered.

“Maybe the treasury is real. He’s using the momentum to stop others from coming.” An old cultivator speculated.

“Li, how, how dare you?!” A member of Armament calmed down and shouted: “You dare to kill members of Armament, we will not let this go!”

“Boom!” Li Qiye sent another pulse and reduced him to a pile of flesh before he could finish speaking. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’ll spare your life.” He pointed at a survivor and said: “Go tell Armament that only a massacre awaits for those who dare to act haughty in front of me.”

“I, I will…” The frightened survivor instantly fled back to Armament Mountain.

“Anyone else?” He then smiled at the crowd.

They all had awkward expressions. Though they thought that there was a treasury, no one wanted to be the first to come in and die.
