Chapter 4234: Everlasting Sword God

Li Qiye showed no emotional fluctuation in this tough scenario. An overlord was no different than a random passerby in his eyes.

“Earthraiser, it’s not time for you to challenge Young Noble Li since we have a score to settle.” A pleasant voice answered before Li Qiye, successfully captivating the crowd.

Though they haven’t seen the lady, that voice alone penetrated their heart. After the initial shock, the big shots calmed down and thought about this newcomer. Only a few beings were qualified to address the vajra by his title directly.

A woman landed from the sky right in front of Earthraiser Vajra. She wore a simple white dress and didn’t have any makeup on.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Despite the dress’ simplistic style, it was clearly made by a master artisan - a perfect fit. She wasn’t gorgeous nor did she have a powerful aura.

However, her complexion was healthy and vibrant. Her temperament was noble and elegant, completely unpretentious. She seemed as free as the clouds in the sky, able to do whatever she wanted. The vast world couldn’t contain or shackle her.

In spite of her ordinary appearance, people couldn’t help staring for a long time. They appreciated her just as much as a kingdom-toppling beauty. She was an immaculate piece of art crafted by nature itself.

No one expected the newcomer to be an ordinary-looking woman since she spoke without honorifics.

“Everlasting Sword God!” An old ruler shouted in astonishment after seeing her.

“She-she’s Everlasting Sword God?” The youths’ eyes widened in disbelief.

“I-I thought Everlasting Sword God was a man.” One of them stammered.

“You thought wrong.” A senior glared at him.

Most subconsciously assumed that the five overlords consisted of five unbeatable ancestors. In this case, she was still relatively young.

Putting her sex aside, they were also surprised by her lack of divinity and pressure. Everlasting Sword God was known to be an invincible sword user. However, she didn’t appear this way.

Lu Qi and the others bowed towards Everlasting Sword God.

“We meet again, Young Noble.” She, on the other hand, bowed gracefully towards Li Qiye.

He smiled and slightly nodded. This only served to further confuse the crowd.

A while ago, many guessed that Li Qiye was from Sword Temple, potentially being her successor. This was obviously not the case now.

Everlasting Sword God was none other than Xi Yue who had met Li Qiye back on Crimson Island.

“Long time no see, Miss Xi Yue.” Both Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra greeted her.

“Indeed, it is time for debt to be paid.” She replied with conviction.

Outsiders exchanged glances. The feuds between the five overlords weren’t public knowledge so they became interested after hearing her.

“Competition and strife during the path towards the grand dao are inevitable. We all tried to obtain Myriad Era back then, it wasn’t personal.” The vajra said.

“Indeed, it should have been a competition based on skills and virtues. However, I’m sure you two know more than anyone how Dao Sanqian got involved.” She retorted.

More information about the previous battle made the crowd shudder. Its outcome was revealed recently - War God’s death; Sun and Moon Lords leaving the cultivation world. Only three remained.

It turned out that others have joined this competition. Dao Sanqian was named to be one of them. This was now confirmed by Everlasting Sword God.

Eight Desolaces were isolated in the absence of a dao lord. However, Dao Sanqian still extended his reach to Sword Continent. What was the secret behind this?

Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra’s expression changed, looking rather awkward as they smiled wryly.

Many realized that perhaps this alliance was forged long ago. Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra most likely teamed up during the previous war and had the upper hand.

The others might not have lost because they were weaker. There were other factors, one being Dao Sanqian.

“Unexpected things happened back then.” Earthraiser coughed.

“I’m sure you two expected all of them.” Everlasting Sword God disagreed.

“It is in the past now, Miss Xi Yue, but if you want revenge, we are ready.” The venerable was more direct. He seemed eager to drop this conversation, not wanting the truths to come out.

“So be it.” Everlasting Sword Got was straightforward as well.

“Are you intending on fighting both of us?” Earthraiser Vajra narrowed his eyes.

“Looks like you have understood the mysteries of Everlasting, your cultivation has taken another step forward, how commendable.” The venerable gazed and tried to read her.

“I can’t compare to you, Venerable. You created Torrential Rain on top of knowing Abyss and Vastsea.” She said.

“Torrential Rain is no match for Everlasting Sword Art.” He humbly responded.

“We will find out today.” Her gaze fixated on him, clearly intending on stealing Tie Jian and Hallowed City Lord’s opponent.

“My old bones have been stagnating for years now.” His eyes turned cold: “I wonder how I’ll do against your sword art.”

“Clank!” Xi Yue unsheathed Everlasting. Her aura immediately changed afterward.

It had a clear glow as if time was floating around it. One inch of the blade contained millions and millions of years.

Both the sword and its dao were created by Sword Queen. Some believed that they were extremely close to reaching the level of Myriad Era and its dao.
