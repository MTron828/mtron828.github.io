Chapter 3530: Forefather’s Arrival

The lives of the coalition were hanging on a thread. Just a bit more force from Li Qiye would end with their death - truly horrifying just to think about.

Suddenly, one could hear the loud sounds of rolling wheels from a carriage over the horizon.

The yin and yang engulfed ten million miles and culminated into a bright path originating from Yin Yang Gate and reaching Ancestral Gate.

There seemed to be a world being derived within the sounds of rolling wheels. The crowd was still shocked to see this phenomenon despite a lack of intimidating pressure. They knew that a supreme being was arriving.

An ancient carriage slowly made its way through the yin yang path. It seemingly rolled like a normal carriage but with each full rotation of the wheel, it traveled across millions of miles. This was a type of spatial leap.

It was made from the exceedingly rare Archaic Yin Wood embedded with immortal bronze and jade, sun-moon stones...

The carriage itself along with the ornaments exuded an ancient aura. The spectators could sense the years on them as if the carriage came from the past.

Plenty of damages existed on the body - holes from arrows, cuts from swords. Some broken arrows were still stuck there. People could tell at a glance that it had experienced numerous battles and wars.

They also heard the stomps of a beast dragging the carriage. It resembled a qilin but wasn’t one. It had silver armor plates with white smokes shrouding its feet. It lacked the gallant divinity found in a qilin.

Its eyes exuded frightening glimmers akin to lightning bolts capable of killing anyone.

The carriage driver was an ancestor from Yin Yang Gate even older than Golden Sun’s group. He had bright eyes and sharp brows. He had an outfit of an older style on; just him sitting there alone commanded reverence from the spectators as if he was a crownless king.

“A Silver-carapace Lin.” Someone in the front shouted in astonishment because this was a branch of a divine beast. Its bloodline would be the most precious in this world if the divine beasts didn’t exist.

Thus, it meant that the master of the carriage must be extremely prestigious to have a beast like this.

“That, that’s Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang, right?” An ancestor said with uncertainty after seeing the carriage driver.

“Forefather!” Golden Sun and the others became excited.

“Forefather!” The soldiers of Yin Yang still cheered despite being suppressed on the ground.

“He has to be the heavenly sovereign.” The spectators thought that this was the case after seeing the army’s response.

“Yes.” Numerous took a deep breath to calm down.

Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang was nothing short of a legend in the north. Just mentioning his title alone always had a magical effect on the listeners.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that even a three-year-old had heard of his title. He was the sun hanging above the north, illuminating everyone with his prestige.

Though everyone had heard of him, very few had the privilege of seeing him in person. This included those from Yin Yang Gate. Only high-level ancestors like Golden Sun were lucky enough.

Thus, to be able to see him today was a great honor for everyone.

“I can’t believe I will get to see him in this lifetime. There’s zero regrets.” An ancestor became emotional. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang...” Some juniors actually had tears streaming down their cheeks.

The defining character of the north was here in person. All eyes were on the carriage.

“There’s hope for Yin Yang Gate.” A high elder murmured: “Maybe he’ll be able to change this outcome.”

“Yes, at least they’ll survive.” Many ancestors agreed: “Li Qiye is really strong but there’s no way he is stronger than the sovereign. It’ll be even at best.”

“In my opinion, Li Qiye is still too young so there should be a small gap between them. But that doesn’t matter, he’s already solidified his position in history.” An older big shot speculated.

Their comments weren’t meant to disparage Li Qiye in the slightest. In fact, they could be considered as praises. After all, how many youths in history could be mentioned in the same breath as the sovereign?

“The forefather is here for us.” Not to mention ordinary disciples from Yin Yang, even their regular ancestors were overwhelmed. They would be prostrating if it wasn’t for the suppression immobilizing them.

“This is the true power of Yin Yang Gate. Who will be able to stop the sovereign?” An expert asked.

“Right, even a dao lord would need to give him some face. Several dao lords have assumed a junior role while visiting him.” Someone else commented.

Because the sovereign taught Ancient Zen Dao Lord, some referred to him as Imperial Teacher later on.

“Don’t forget, the sovereign entered the forbidden zone and came out alive, one of the few to do so. This required immense power.” A historical buff said with respect.

“That’s untouchable indeed.” Others were shaken to hear this.

“Creak.” The carriage finally stopped and floated in the air. Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang sitting on the carriage didn’t bother looking at anyone, not even the ancient ancestors.

His eyes immediately fell upon Li Qiye. The crowd watched with bated breath during this meeting.

They wondered about a battle between these two and thought that Li Qiye was the underdog.

The disciples from Yin Yang were ecstatic, thinking that they were saved. No one in this world could stop their forefather. This was the true ace card of their sect.

However, in a kitchen soup restaurant inside Ancestral, the old shopkeeper gave it a quick glance before shaking his head: “Not enough.”

“Screech!” The tense atmosphere was suddenly interrupted by a phoenix screech. It tore apart the clouds nearby. A gigantic bird appeared; its five-colored wings were large enough to blot out the sky.

“What is that?!” Everything turned dark and people became startled.
