Many nodded in agreement while staring at Li Qiye.

“Yes, maybe a really thin phoenix bloodline, we just can’t notice it.” One murmured.

An older expert carefully observed both Li Qiye and the domain. He agreed as well and added: “The phoenix trueflame and a phoenix bloodline are from the same branch, it makes sense that he isn’t afraid of the heat here.”

If this was actually the case, then this heat was actually beneficial to Li Qiye. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“No wonder why Dragon-phoenix Dragon favored him, the same with Pearlstone Saintess. Looks like they noticed his bloodline. Remember, they have amazing bloodline too.” Another extrapolated.

“That’s possible.” Some agreed with this, especially the young geniuses.

Otherwise, how could someone as regular as Li Qiye win the two women over?

In reality, Li Qiye being impervious to the heat had nothing to do with a phoenix bloodline. The spectators simply didn’t know what was going on and chose to come up with a plausible explanation.

“So what if he has a phoenix bloodline?” An expert regained his wits and snorted: “He’s still not powerful, not at the sacred level, so this bloodline isn’t special right now. Only power will lead to victory.”

“True, he’s not stronger than Young Lord Bai. He doesn’t have long to live either after offending the young lord and Yin Yang.” Another chimed in.

This bloodline was astonishing and made people envious. However, they still dismissed him because of his weak cultivation. Opposing the princess’ group right now would only end in death.

As for Wu Zhongtian and the others, they were afraid because Li Qiye might be the only person in history to be unaffected by the heat here, as far as they know.

They agreed with the ancestor’s speculation. A phoenix bloodline was the only explanation for this.

Only Pearlstone Saintess thought that Li Qiye could still do this regardless of his bloodline.

“Poof.” The flame in his palm disappeared. He walked out of the domain and smiled at the princess: “See? You don’t need to worry about me traveling through there.”

All eyes were on the princess now. They knew that this alliance wouldn’t easily abandon the treasury.

“Young Noble Li, you are truly incredible. Looks like you have the mythical phoenix bloodline and will definitely soar to the nine firmaments in the future. My horizon was broadened today...” The princess didn’t hold back on praising Li Qiye.

This would be considered a great honor, especially for the younger generation. They would definitely be elated but Li Qiye was unaffected.

“Okay, you no longer have any business here. Leave and stop being an eyesore.” Li Qiye waved his hand and said.

This wasn’t his first time telling them to leave but as the adage goes - never slap a smiling face. No one else would be so blunt when the princess was so generous with her praise.

Moreover, this alliance was extremely powerful. Putting aside Li Qiye’s bloodline, this alliance and their armies were unbeatable in this place.

Thus, the blatant disdain was impossible to take. Zhongtian and the others had an ugly expression. Even the princess’ eyes turned cold. She remained calm and told Pearlstone Saintess: “Sister Shi, I am sincerely asking everyone to join us, I hope for your sympathy. Will you put in a word or two?”

The princess made it clear, wanting Pearlstone to convince Li Qiye. She remained patient with these two.

“Her Highness can’t be any nicer.” The crowd thought, still thinking about the contrast in attitude between Li Qiye and the princess. They also thought that Pearlstone Saintess would make a compromise.

However, Pearlstone shook her head and said: “Princess, I say this with nothing but goodwill, our young master is wanting the best for you, he’s being merciful right now. Leave with your followers or face his wrath with terrible consequences. Think about it.”

Pearlstone had no ulterior motive this time. She knew that Li Qiye would stop playing nice soon and rivers of blood would start flowing. The princess and her men wouldn’t be able to escape death.

Alas, others didn’t appreciate this. They were shocked that she would still support Li Qiye, an outsider instead of her fiance’s sect and future sister.

“Biting the hand that feeds you!” One disciple from Yin Yang couldn’t help raising his voice.

“Clank!” A ray flashed and he was instantly decapitated. Blood gushed from the severed body.

“You deserve death.” Li Qiye had a sword in his hand now. He gently blew away the blood pearls on the blade.

The crowd’s expression instantly changed after seeing his nonchalant murder.

“Such impudence!” Both the godchild and the first prince stepped forward. The former shouted!” Brat, you brought this upon yourself!”

Li Qiye answered by tossing the sword back to Pearlstone Saintess. He raised his hand and a crack suddenly appeared in the domain. Lava oozed out from that spot.

People finally realized that there was an ocean of magma underneath. The lava that came out suddenly flew and coiled around Li Qiye’s hand.

He came into possession of the destructive fire affinity, enough to destroy an army.

“Come together.” He smiled and swung his hand down.

“Boom!” Terrible destruction blasted across the area.

“Die!” The first prince and the godchild didn’t believe in Li Qiye’s power.

“Clank!” The godchild used a sword slash while the first prince performed a draconic punch.
