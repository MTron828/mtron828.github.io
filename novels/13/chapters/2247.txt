He eventually left the cave and descended down the mountain.

From the main mountain were multiple waterfalls pouring downward. The other mountains in the vicinity had waterfalls as well but they couldn’t compare to the main ones. The main ones looked like rivers from the heavens; one could see them from a thousand miles away.

The waterfalls eventually gathered into a massive lake at the bottom, looking no different from an ocean.

Islands were hidden by the mists just like pearls on this lake named Alchemy Lake by others. One could see boats coming back and forth. The islands did have natives but the majority of people were just tourists.

Li Qiye focused his gaze at the waterfalls streaming down the mountains and continued to be impressed by Alchemy Immortal. He walked alongside a particular stream to make his way down.

Alchemy Hut had plenty of herbs and plants. However, there was one native thing only available in this place - Alchemy Wood.

Rumor has it that there was one divine tree growing somewhere on the main mountain. Each year, some old branches would fall down along the streams. This process would take a very long time so the branches were truly immersed in the water. They eventually sank to the bottom due to their immense weight and be covered by the river bed.

Another million years would pass then these branches would become Alchemy Wood.

Gestated by both the waterfalls and earth, they contained the essences of this land. This made it as precious as gold, or even more so.

Just a tiny piece would be quite costly. A particularly old one would have a sky-high price.

Many disciples in the system would try to find them in the streams. However, Longevity Valley didn’t allow for reckless excavation so it was quite hard to find them. Nevertheless, for a nobody, finding one would make them rich overnight.

Li Qiye followed the stream and watched the current. He was a bit interested in this special wood, but not in and of itself.

He eventually made it to the great lake with its scintillating and golden surface, quite a beautiful scene.

The dazzlingness of the lake didn’t interest him as much as one tiny island with no inhabitants.

“There are spirits in all things, truly interesting.” He commented with amusement.

He took out a shovel and began to dig the shallow water, ignoring the mud and soil dirtying his robe.

Mu Yalan and Qin Shaoyao have been trying to find Li Qiye for several days to no avail. This made them quite anxious until a disciple reported that he had appeared by the lake. The two ran there with haste with their fans right behind them.

They didn’t like these unwanted tails but they couldn’t chase them away either. They thought it would be so nice if their First Sister was here.

Fan Miaozhen had too many schemes. If she was here, she could easily lose these young fellas. Yalan and Shaoyao didn’t have this ability since they normally only focused on their own field instead of socializing.

The two had no choice but to be out in public right now in order to find Li Qiye. The most excellent among the crowd were Zhang Yan and Hu Qingniu - cranes among a flock of chicken. They easily overwhelmed their love rivals.

The two girls got on a boat and paid attention to the islands. Many suitors did the same. Miaozhen would have come up with ways to throw them into the water, but Yalan and Shaoyao couldn’t.

“Miss Mu, are you enjoying the lake’s sceneries?” Zhang Yan came forward with what he considered to be his most handsome smile - one as bright as the sun.

He was indeed a handsome fella with a strong background. Many girls considered him to be their prince on a white horse, but he only had eyes for Yalan.

“Finding medicine.” She answered coldly. It wasn’t an act since this was her natural demeanor.

“May I ask which kind? I’m quite familiar with the ones here, maybe I can be of service.” The rather quiet Qingniu seized the opportunity to jump in.

This normally arrogant doctor was a man of few words. He looked down on speaking to those he considered beneath his station. However, he wanted to show off in front of Qin Shaoyao, hoping to make a good impression.

“Thank you, but it is alright.” Shaoyao shook her head and refused in such a gentle manner.

“The two of you are too reserved, we’re all family, no need for that. Plus, Longevity Valley is the orthodox branch, it is fine for us to be the errand boys.” Zhang Yan quickly added.

“My medicinal trove has many different medicines, may I ask what you are looking for? Maybe I have it already.” Qingniu came up with a way to make the beauty happy.

“That’s right, the two of you are being too polite right now. Longevity Valley’s problem is our problem. Just let us help you find whatever you need.” A different youth said.

Yalan stopped replying and continued looking over at the islands while Shaoyao politely shook her head.

The two of them didn’t talk about Li Qiye’s disappearance, using finding medicine as an excuse.

Zhang Yan and Qingniu became awkward since the girls weren’t responding. Zhang Yan came up with something else and said: “Brother Hu, are there any interesting story during your medical journey?”

“Not much, just busy with finding medicine and saving people. I suppose I’ve seen some interesting illness recently and spent some time researching them.” Qingniu contemplated before answering.

His answer was only to impress Shaoyao. He didn’t have time to waste saving people. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Zhang Yan didn’t have a response since he wasn’t good at medicine. Talking about this subject would only make Qingniu look better.

“However, Brother Miracle is coming out of his cultivation and will participate in the ceremony this time around.” Zhang Yan changed the topic.

He knew about the relationship between Everlasting and Longevity, so this was a way to attract Mu Yalan’s attention.

“Mmm, I have heard rumors of him wanting to have a dao discussion with Longevity Sage.” Qingniu immediately replied.

But he immediately realized that he had said the wrong thing because the sage was the two girls’ master. This particular topic could annoy the two.

Zhang Yan wanted to strangle the guy. He might be a good doctor but was so bad at idle chatting. He could save people but could kill a conversation right away. This was driving Zhang Yan crazy.
