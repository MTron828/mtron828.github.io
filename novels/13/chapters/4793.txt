Chapter 4794: Ancestral Aunt

The girl resembled a regular disciple from a great power. Nothing stood out regarding her appearance.

Nonetheless, she had just given Specter Monarch an order. In True Immortal, it seemed that only Tian Tu had a higher status than him since both were Blessed Dao Lord’s disciples.

He was the one to give out orders, not the other way around. Therefore, spectators found this confusing and outrageous.

They couldn’t come up with another person capable of commanding Specter. Tian Tu was gone, and she naturally couldn’t be Blessed Dao Lord since he had left this world.

Surprisingly, Specter and Six-dao bowed deeply after seeing her. They then walked over and stood behind her as if they were juniors.

“We obey you, Martial Aunt.” Specter said respectfully.

Remember, Specter only cupped his fist toward his senior brother since they were from the same generation. In other words, she had the same seniority as Blessed Dao Lord and this astounded the crowd.

It meant that this woman was either Blessed Dao Lord’s martial sister or his blood sister. [1]

“Such a person exists?” A knowledgeable ancient ancestor became confused after hearing the honorifics.

“A junior sister of Blessed Dao Lord?” A close friend of True Immortal from the olden days murmured.

“Who is Blessed Dao Lord’s master…?” A high ancestor from a prestigious clan asked.

No one could answer him, not even ancient ancestors that were immensely connected to True Immortal. None of their disciples either. Perhaps only Specter and Tian Tu were privy to this information.

In reality, Specter himself wasn’t sure. He thought that maybe his first brother would know the truth.

There were no records of this, not even in True Immortal’s library. According to the legend, Blessed Dao Lord met an immortal who taught him the grand dao.

Because of this, he was able to become one of the most brilliant dao lords in history. Many considered him to be the greatest. The legacy of the immortal allowed him to create the seven mantras.

Despite this widespread legend, the actual details of the immortal remained unknown. This figure seemed to have appeared out of nowhere and left just as quickly.

There was a problem with this. A person capable of being Blessed Dao Lord’s master must be amazing.

For example, Dao Sanqian had taught numerous dao lords and survived the test of time. He became world-renowned. This should be the case for this mysterious teacher as well.

Therefore, all eyes were on the woman. She could also be that immortal’s disciple?

Everyone stared intensely, hoping to see some clues regarding the existence of immortals. On this topic, the first person to come to mind was none other than Li Qiye.

Unfortunately, heavenly gazes from ancient ancestors and monarchs couldn’t gather any new information.

The woman’s appearance had nothing that would connect her to being an immortal’s disciple but Specter Monarch’s statement said it all.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Dao Sanqian became emotional as well. He took a deep breath and murmured: “Another legend that is proven to be real.”

He knew more about True Immortal than some of its ancestors. After all, it was a competitor. He didn’t expect this particular person to still be around on top of hiding rather well.

Other ancestors and top masters trembled because they realized that they have severely underestimated True Immortal.

They once thought that the pillars of True Immortal were Six-dao and the other ancient ancestors. Now, Specter Monarch came out of nowhere, and then Tian Tu.

Now, a woman who could potentially be the disciple of an immortal has shown up.

“This is insanity. Why did these characters not show up even when True Immortal was on the brink of destruction?” An ancient ancestor said.

Emperor Ye nearly destroyed True Immortal but these figures didn’t show up to stop her. This also happened with Six-dao Monarch and the arrogant woman.

“Martial Aunt?” Cosmic Lord became confused as well. Despite being a hero of the sect, he didn’t know about her existence. In fact, she could be considered a matriarch or a progenitor.

Sure, he read ancient scrolls regarding someone like her at the start of True Immortal. He just didn’t expect her to still be around.

1. The word indicates younger but I would have to do Martial Younger Aunt which is too wordy. I’ll elaborate on this via context instead through the narrative ☜
