Chapter 5084: Well-deserved Death

Li Qiye still used the branch as his sword for another ordinary thrust. Of course, it had the power of his dao heart infused with it. Anything else was unnecessary.

The pinnacle of killing - the whim of the dao heart. The stronger the dao heart, the sharper the attack on top of being indiscernible.

This was the reason why the ancestors in the crowd couldn’t see its profundity. This was reserved for stronger cultivators such as Conceal Conqueror.

“Boom!” Everyone saw the broken branch contesting against the immortal sword from Celestial Court.

The explosion reduced Heaven Summit into dust. Ten million miles of land were immediately flattened.

Not to mention regular cultivators, even dragon lords were left paralyzed on the ground. It took a while before the calm.

Spectators regained their composure and saw the entire battlefield being obliterated. Most importantly, they knew that the combatants have purposely reduced the area of effect in order to minimize damage.

They saw Conceal Conqueror laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood. A hole could be seen where her heart should be.

“Is she dead?” Everyone became emotional since this unbeatable conqueror was no longer moving.

They then turned and looked for Li Qiye, only to see a bottomless abyss. Some immediately thought that he was nothing now after being targeted by Immortal Slaughter.

“What an attack…” The devastation of that immortal sword left an indelible mark in their mind. That strike alone had enough power to destroy an entire dao lineage.

“Celestial Court…” They shuddered in fear.

This was only one of Celestial Court’s methods. Moreover, it was so far away too - just imagine their reach at the immortal continent. This was one reason why it was able to kill emperors and dao lords in the past.

“How fun.” They suddenly heard someone speaking and looked again only to see Li Qiye floating above the abyss.

They clearly didn’t see him before so this was rather confusing.

‘I wonder who left it behind.’ He murmured to himself. Since he knew the previous top members of Celestial Court, he knew that none of them had left something like this behind. Where did it come from then?

“Dao heart kill.” Conceal’s voice suddenly echoed.

Everyone turned around and saw that she was still alive. She vomited a mouthful of blood as she spoke.

“A well-deserved death.” She had excitement instead of fear. No, a type of happiness.

Spectators exchanged glances, speechless at her extraordinary reaction to the attack and love for the dao of murder.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Many dragon lords with three or fruit fruits stopped the pursuit. They believed that they were strong enough to roam the lower continents. There was no need to pursue another tough road.

This wasn’t the case for Conceal. Even when she was on the verge of death, the only thing on her mind was Li Qiye’s dao heart attack. This obsession with the dao put cultivators to shame.

“Buzz.” Suddenly, her body became ethereal and disappeared from sight.

“She ran away!?” Many shouted after seeing this since the once-strongest cultivator in the lower continents chose to run dishonorably.

Everyone felt that someone like her would rather die in battle instead. Remember, her rival - Eight-stallion Dao Lord - chose death instead of running away.

Now, the representative of Deity and even The Race ran away. This was quite a blow to their prestige.

Before the start of the battle, they all thought that it would end with one of the combatant’s death. Now, the star of The Race had run away. How could its members ever walk with their head held high again?

Her death would have actually improved their morale and solidarity. Now, those from Deity and its allies stood there in a daze.

Li Qiye had no need to throw insults since they were already as dejected as can be while looking down at the ground like stray dogs.
