Chapter 4457: Life Or Death Situations

Death was unavoidable for all living beings. Wang Weiqiao’s answer wasn’t unreasonable. Since he lived far longer than mortals and the average disciples, he had no problem accepting his mortality from old age.

However, to suddenly face unexpected and traumatic death? He felt fear and was not ready for this.

“Facing death is a way to test your dao heart. Nothing else carries the same gravity.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

“I see.” He naturally understood this comment.

“It’s fine to be attached to life, that’s absolutely understandable. On the other hand, it’s also pitiful and blameworthy.” Li Qiye went on.

“Could you elaborate?” He asked.

Li Qiye looked towards the horizon and explained: “Being attached to life makes one enthusiastic about the world, a source of motivation. If you don’t care for your own life, then there’s nothing else you will care for.”

“Right.” Weiqiao agreed.

“But if you have lived long enough, being too attached to life can be a source of calamity for others.” Li Qiye went on.

“Hmm…” Weiqiao found this surprising.

“Once someone has lived long enough, they will have also gained ample power. Thus, for the sake of surviving, they might do anything to live. In the end, they might go as far as destroying the world they love to live longer.”

Weiqiao was moved to hear this.

An attachment to life bred motivation but also destruction - a double-edged blade. With time, the latter became rather likely.

“Because of this, you need to experience facing death.” Li Qiye elaborated: “Not only would this improve your cultivation and foundation, but it’ll also give you a clearer perspective on life. After several experiences, you will know what you want.”

“Master, I’m afraid that I can't live up to your expectations.” Weiqiao said.

“Only time can tell. If you don’t wish to ruin yourself, you need to be resolute and courageously continue forward.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand.” Weiqiao memorized his teaching.

“We’re going.” Li Qiye grabbed the old man and crossed through space.

Inner Ruins was massive; few could see all of its mysteries. This didn’t stop the duo from reaching a desolate area protected by a mysterious force. No one else could come here.

There seemed to be no end in sight in this void expanse. There were floating continents; some were destroyed and reduced to large boulders. The lucky ones were completely intact with a strong life force. A few became dangerous grounds resembling hell…

“We’re here. Leave.” Li Qiye stared at the expanse and said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Weiqiao had no idea where he was. Though he was weak, he instantly recognized the perilous nature of this area. There were too many hidden dangers to count.

He also got the feeling that numerous eyes were staring at them from the shadows. They belonged to creatures eager of leaping out and eating them.

“Where is this place, Master?” He took a deep breath and asked softly.

“Inner Ruins.” Li Qiye casually answered.

“How will I find you, Master?” Weiqiao inquired.

“No need to say goodbye. Walk your own path and become a mighty tree. Being under my protection will limit your growth, you’ll amount to nothing.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see, I will try my best and not let you down, Master.” Weiqiao became emotional and bowed.

“No, do it for yourself, not for me. Cultivation is a personal pursuit. Find out what it is that you seek.” Li Qiye continued.

“I will remember this.” Weiqiao bowed again.

“Go now, there is a long path ahead, we’ll meet again.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“I’m leaving, Master.” Weiqiao bowed again, not truly wanting to leave. Nonetheless, he got up and turned away.

“I’ll see you off.” Li Qiye chuckled and kicked the old man.

“Bam!” Weiqiao flew like a meteor towards the horizon while screaming: “Ahh!”

“Boom!” Eventually, he landed and rolled on the ground.

It took a while before he stopped seeing stars. He strugglingly got up from being dizzy.

Suddenly, his mind became focused again due to a thick stench in the wind.

“Creak-” Something heavy was moving ahead.

He looked up and saw a moving hill. No, it turned out to be a massive insect with countless legs. Its carapace seemed to be made of rocks. It slowly crawled out of the ground with eyes larger than lanterns. This was the source of the stench.

“Shit…” Weiqiao immediately fled.

The insect roared and headed for Weiqiao. Its sharp legs cut through the ground, leaving behind numerous cracks.

Weiqiao ran for his life, crossing through the maze-like terrains in order to avoid the attack. He completely forgot about the whole training with facing death. The only thing on his mind was to get away from this creature.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye observed the chase with a smirk on his face. He then looked up and said: “Show yourself.”

Bright ripples appeared above, akin to an elephant walking into the water. There was something large hiding above.

Sure enough, a monstrous creature appeared with a billowing aura. It had tried its best to hide this frightening aura to no avail.

Despite its world-devouring nature, it looked rather obedient before Li Qiye.

“Greetings, Sir. I am a member of the burial ground.” It landed on the continent and bowed.

Others might not know about Li Qiye but this thing certainly did. It was facing a true monster capable of crushing it with no problem at all.

“You’ve been following us since Little Diamond.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I didn’t dare to act on my own volition without your permission, Sir. Please forgive me if I had offended you.” The creature said.

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye waved his hand: “You harbored no nefarious intent so there is no fault. Your ancestor stuck to his words so I will keep an eye on his descendants. His investment was not in vain.”

“The ancestor had mentioned you to us before, that if we see you, we must treat you with the same level of respect as we do him.” The creature hurriedly said.
