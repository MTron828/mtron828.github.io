Chapter 5884: Let Me Devour And I Will Leave

Stonesplitter had not shown up since the last battle, so only the participants and those they told knew about him.

He was the only overlord spared by Li Qiye. Not all understood the latter’s reasoning because the fish was already on the chopping board.

Although he became tied with the epoch, this still left a potential seed of trouble for the future. Killing him might have been the more conservative option.

Nevertheless, World and the others heaved a sigh of relief. They had broken the limit but couldn’t defeat Twilight Hunter alone.

Whilst his offense was negligible, Stonesplitter boasted the best defense in the epoch. Twilight Hunter might not be able to take it down.

Stonesplitter looked the same as before - cowardly and hiding behind his shield without any impressive aura to speak of.

All in all, he didn’t look like an overlord in the slightest - placing his shield forward and propping his sky piercer on it.

“Since when did you become a guardian of this world?” Twilight Hunter’s illusory voice echoed.

“I am doing what I should.” Stonesplitter answered from behind the shield.

The emperors recalled when the seven overlords teamed up against Li Qiye. Now, one of them was protecting them from Twilight Hunter.

Their impression of him improved dramatically - he didn’t look as pathetic and cowardly as before.

“Shouldn’t you be refining the weapon you so desired?” A hint of sarcasm and mockery could be heard.

“It’s a different age now and we must obey this world’s rules.” Stonesplitter answered earnestly.

Twilight Hunter was initially taken aback before chuckling in response: “How unexpected, the ambitious Stonesplitter no longer wanting to fulfill his dreams, a rule-follower now, I see.”

Stonesplitter didn’t respond, still waiting for the right opportunity to strike. This was the same for Twilight Hunter, not showing any impatience.

In fact, the emperors thought that given his stance, he was ready to escape at any second. He had no love for fighting nor reputation.

His specialty was ambushing but in this scenario, the opponent was just as cautious and showed no sign of opening. These two overlords were opposite of each other so how would this fight go?

“What do you want then?” Twilight Hunter asked.

“Leave, it’s good for everyone.” Stonesplitter said. It seemed that losing to Li Qiye made him more careful than before if that was possible.

He had no allies to speak of right now after the death of the overlords. If he were to lose a single exchange, that might spell the end of him.

“Let me devour Trinity and I will leave. We shall not become enemies.” Twilight Hunter said, focusing on his only goal.

He wasn’t one to rule the epoch - it was a matter of devouring and living in seclusion again.

The emperors glanced over at Trinity. The two separated beings were caught off guard during their fight and have been suppressed.

They knew that these fallen overlords required flesh and vitality to stay alive. Would Stonesplitter suddenly change his mind and join the meal? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

That would be the worst possible development for their epoch.
