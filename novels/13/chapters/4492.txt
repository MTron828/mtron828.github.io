Chapter 4493: Azure Assault

Wise simply raised his hand and released rays of energy this time like a peacock spreading its wings, easily stabilizing the situation.

Lotus Young Noble’s sudden shifting technique was impressive but the difference in power was overwhelming. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Boom!” The petal blades were instantly destroyed while remnant rays forced the youth backward once more.

Anyone could see that he was no match for Wise Ancestor despite his considerable talent. From start to finish, the ancestor has yet to use his weapon. If he were serious, the youth might die from a single slash.

“My turn.” Wise narrowed his eyes. Though he has yet to activate his aura, just his expression alone made others shudder and feel an immense pressure on their chest.

The youth got chills as well, not expecting the situation to develop in this manner. He thought that these clans were too insignificant to dare oppose him.

During a conflict, these clans should be trying their best to appease him. Moreover, they were in the wrong for insulting Three Thousand Dao. Alas, Wise Ancestor seemed keen on backing up his own people instead of apologizing to him. This might end with his death.

Spectators exchanged glances. This was a rather rare occasion, backing one’s own members against Three Thousand Dao.

“Prepare yourself.” Wise warned and gave the youth a chance. After all, it was an unfair fight.

“Fine!” The youth couldn’t back off any longer. Plus, in the back of his mind, he didn’t think that Wise Ancestor would actually dare to kill him.

“Boom!” He released his vitality. It manifested into an azure beam and tore the sky vault like a divine sword.

He floated upward and seemingly became empowered by a god. Though the beam wasn’t that large in size, it still intimidated the crowd.

“Azure Assault. This is one of the three thousand dao created by the dao progenitor!” An expert bellowed after seeing this.

Three thousand dao reaching for immortality - this was the most accurate description of Dao Sanqian - a supreme monster. The name alone instilled fear into all of Sky Border for eras now.

Dao Sanqian served as both his title and achievements. Rumor has it that he created three thousand special dao and started an impressive lineage.

Countless experts and masters have been trained by him. Some thought that it was disrespectful to address him by his title. Thus, they chose to call him dao progenitor instead.

Once again, he wasn’t a supreme genius but being able to cultivate this art was a testament to his skill.

Of course, he was far from mastering this dao but the spectacle still shook the crowd. This particular dao lived up to its fame.

“What a great grand dao. Unfortunately, you have a superficial knowledge of it.” Wise Ancestor commented.

“Try then, I can block three moves for sure!” The dao empowerment also boosted the youth’s courage.

“You do have a backbone.” Wise smiled and channeled his saber dao.

The experts nearby were curious about this ancestor’s saber art.

“Splash!” Suddenly, a massive shadow leaped out of the water.

It was none other than a dragon appearing above the youth. It opened its jaws and came for him.

“No!!!” The youth panicked and tried to retaliate. Alas, it was just too late and the dragon caught him.

“Ahh!” Screams could be heard from the mouth of the dragon.

It chewed several times and then swallowed the corpse.

“Shit…” The worker on Li Qiye’s boat shouted.

“It’s the azure flood-dragon…” The crowd didn’t expect this development. This included the workers.

The dragon was a spirit beast on sale. It has been here for eras now and had never attacked a guest before. Today, it seemed to be on the hunt for food and its target was Lotus Young Noble.

This was an impressive creature; even ancestors didn’t want to provoke it.

“Raa!” It let out a roar and returned to the water.

“Watch it!” Many immediately controlled their boats away from its path and maintained a safe distance.

It swam towards Li Qiye’s boat.

“Watch out!” The worker warned the customers but Li Qiye walked closer to the edge and reached forward.

“Raa…” The dragon rubbed its head against his palm just like a pet wanting to be pampered.

The smiling Li Qiye was happy to oblige. The dragon looked docile and harmless, no longer the murderous beast like before. No one expected them to be so friendly with each other.

“Raa!” The dragon roared again and dived back down to the bottom of the lake.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief, especially the worker on Li Qiye’s boat.
