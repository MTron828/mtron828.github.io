Chapter 5691: To Save Or Not?

The proud emperor’s decision drove people to tears.

“Buzz.” A bright radiance from Momentous Frontier descended and engulfed the two, instantly carrying them toward the source.

The life of the entire region seemed to be here - the abode of the deities. Momentous Dao was contained in every inch of the land.

“Deities, please save him.” The prime emperor heaved a sigh of relief and said: “Brother Luminous can’t last for much longer, just replenish his fate and we will leave with haste.”

He dropped butt-first to the ground, still holding onto a thread due to his impressive willpower.

Immortal Emperor Di Yu, Bu Si, Space Dragon Emperor, Bones Dao Lord, and the others exchanged glances. This was quite a dilemma.

“Deities, may I ask how the discussion is going? There is not much time left, please adhere to your neutrality.” War Ancient God’s voice came from outside, unhappy with the delay.

“Should we save him or not?” Bones asked the others.

“We will leave right away instead of disturbing the peace here.” The prime emperor became anxious.

“Save him.” The group came to a consensus.

They hailed from the nine worlds and Eight Desolaces, meaning that they didn’t have a strong attachment to The People of the thirteen continents. Nonetheless, they still had a bias for The People.

To watch the selfless Luminous die today was unacceptable despite their neutrality.

“Boom!” They raised their hands and the endless power of Momentous Frontier surged toward Luminous’ true fate.

“Thank you, thank you, every-!” The prime emperor was nearly moved to tears since his effort was finally rewarded. He couldn’t finish the sentence before fainting. Just relaxing for a second made him drop to the ground.

“Rumble!” Loud explosions detonated as the deities reinforced Luminous’ true fate.

They came before total extinguishment and ignited it just in time.

“Deities, time is running out.” War Ancient God began losing his patience.

The armies of Celestial Court marched again with the commanders leading the way. Auras of emperors and dragon lords engulfed the region.

Mortals became paralyzed on the ground, unable to move. They were mere insects waiting for the apocalypse. They have grown used to peace and prosperity but recently, external threats became apparent.

“They must capitulate, right?” Survivors of The People saw the might of Celestial Court and said.

“They have to back up The People, to surrender the prime emperor and Luminous Conqueror is no different than bending the knee.” A big shot said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I disagree, it’s the way to remain neutral, not surrendering. Momentous Frontier’s goal is to protect all living beings, not to stand with The People.” An ancestor said softly.

“They are located inside Dao City, they have to be on our side.” One expert said.

“That’s right.” The majority agreed with this sentiment.

“Giving up the two emperors will leave Momentous Frontier with infamy for eras to come. It’s no different from betraying The People.” An expert added.

“Well, with regards to sentiments and ties, they shouldn’t do it. However, this goes against their grand goal.” An ancestor said logically.

“Sure, but Momentous Frontier has a unique advantage, an ultimate defense. Capitulating will only show their lack of courage against Celestial Court, might as well plead loyalty then.” One expert said.

“Right, then there’s the immortal weapon too, they can handle anything Celestial Court throws at them, lasting the first wave is the only challenge. Celestial Court will need to mobilize more men and by that time, Imperial Field will send reinforcement as well, Momentous Frontier doesn’t need to do anything else then, isn’t that the perfect scenario?” A big shot speculated.

“I feel the same way, we’re not asking for them to fight Celestial Court, only to withstand the assault for a little bit to buy Luminous Conqueror and West Bank Prime Emperor a little time.” Another said.

“It’s the least they can do for the selfless duo.” Someone said with indignation.
