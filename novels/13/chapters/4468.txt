Chapter 4469: Short Tree

Li Qiye’s group finally returned to the Wu’s territory. Judging by its majestic architecture, one could easily imagine its past glory.

The buildings had an air of vicissitudes, clearly having been around for many years. They were built with exquisite details and grandeur, a testament to the Wu’s prestige.

If one had to pick out a difference between the Wu and the other clans, it would have to be the alchemy aspect.

There were many locations with alchemy gardens, furnaces, and ample materials. The Wu was indeed an alchemy clan once.

Right after Alchemy Saint’s success, other great powers came to ask the alchemists of the Wu for help with pill creation.

Next came the period dominated by saber masters. The alchemy clan abandoned the pills and took up the blades, earning success and recognition in this field as well. Of course, their alchemy dao was still superior to their peers, it just wasn’t the best any longer.

In the present day, they still had a relative focus on alchemy. On the other hand, a second atmosphere - one that was bold and forceful - could be sensed here. This was the presence of saber energy.

The saber dao has penetrated every inch of the land and manifested into a faint presence.

“Do you sense the saber energy here, Young Noble? Something similar is there at the Tie as well in the form of spear energy. One could hear the clank of a spear upon entering right away.” Jian Ming chatted with Li Qiye.

The Tie was another of the four clans with a focus on the art of the spear. Their progenitor also followed the duck egg buyer and was known as Spear Ancestor.

Li Qiye smiled after hearing this and looked up at the peak: “Let’s take a look up there.”

“Sure thing.” Wise Ancestor immediately led the way since he was proud of their divine peak.

In fact, everyone in the group wanted Li Qiye to see this monument.

“This is the symbol of our four clans.” Jian Ming smiled and said: “Rumor has it that it might be our source, the container of our miracles. They used to happen here but no more. Maybe you will be able to see one.”

“Miracles.” Li Qiye smiled and didn’t say anything else.

For eras now, the members of the four clans climbed up the peak in order to stare at their beloved lands and remember their ancestors.

In reality, this peak was just another peak with no miracles to speak of. This might have been different in the past. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The clans used to refer to it as the divine peak because it used to contain a primordial power in the form of miracles. This helped them survive the Chaotic Era.

As they declined, the miracles also disappeared. This was attributed to the dispersion of primordial power. Though the peak was no longer special, it was still viewed as a symbol of pride for the four clans.

Li Qiye took his time climbing the peak, seemingly measuring it with each step. The scenery was a beautiful green. The place brimmed with life and gave off a refreshing feeling.

From the base up the winding paths were many historical sites left behind by the four clans.

After reaching the peak, one could look down and see all of their territories - fertile agricultural fields, buildings, and other wonderful aspects. Though they had declined, they still had ample resources. Smaller clans couldn’t compete in this regard.

The pinnacle didn’t have much outside of some dried branches and weeds. There was a clear lack of verdant trees compared to the dwindling path.

Li Qiye’s eyes fell onto an altar in the center, seemingly made from piles of ancient stones. They were placed in a neat and deliberate manner. Each contained a suitable dao for the spot.

It was only the size of a table or so, surrounding a small tree in the center. The tree was as tall as an adult but its trunk was the size of a basin. Thus, it looked rather short and round.

Nonetheless, it emitted a powerful feeling. Each bark resembled the scale of a true dragon, looking as tough as can be. This, in turn, made the tree look like a dragon that has been here for eras.

Unfortunately, it has withered long ago, holding onto one last breath. The withered leaves were yellow with no sign of life.

Near the roots were four embedded holes. There used to be something in there but they had been taken away.

Li Qiye stared at the withered tree as if it was a priceless treasure, not averting his gaze. The group patiently stood behind him.

After a while, he stared at Jthem and said: “I see, you invited me back here to revive this tree.”

“...” Wise Ancestor smiled awkwardly then told the truth: “Young Noble, you are absolutely right. Our four clans haven’t had a supreme ancestor in so long so the tree withered. We have tried everything to call the miracles back. Alas, it’s all futile.”

“Young Noble, we call it the Tree of Contribution.” Jian Ming said: “It used to have primordial energy circling around it as if it was the source of the dao.”
