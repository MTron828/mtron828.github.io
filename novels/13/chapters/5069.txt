Chapter 5070: I’m Here To Help

Li Qiye finally made it to his destination - a dark place with low visibility. Looking ahead, one would see something akin to giant dragons intertwining in the air.

In reality, it was a nest made from massive branches. The two were only seeing a tiny corner of the nest.

Unfortunately, Ming Shi couldn’t get any closer due to an unknown power. As she stood there, she speculated that even conquerors couldn’t get in.

Li Qiye stared at the nest for a while before speaking: “Wait here.”

“Okay.” She agreed.

With that, Li Qiye took one step forward and nullified the power. It had no choice but to acquiesce before his presence.

“Hmph.” He became more serious eventually and added force. All the laws reversed their course and made way for his steps.

“Boom!” A hole was made, allowing entry.

He disappeared into the nest while Ming Shi sat in the meditative pose, knowing that he would return unscathed.

Inside the nest proved that the initial assessment of its size was accurate. Countless stars flowed together like a river and eventually formed a maelstrom. It could accommodate an entire epoch.

It was spinning rather slowly in this timeless dimension. If it was in the outside world, it might require millions of years before a full rotation.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

If it was spinning any faster, its sucking force would cause devastating damage. Upon closer inspection, a top master would be able to calculate its appropriate age and find out that it was still rather young.

Li Qiye took his time analyzing the maelstrom. After a while, he finally spoke: “Am I not welcome here? Must I flip this place over before getting to chat with you two?”

It looked as if he was murmuring to himself since no one else was around.

“Pop!” Space rippled to the sides of the maelstrom. A total of four eyes opened to look at him.

One pair of eyes was golden, as bright as two suns. The other was amber with a glassy feel to it.

Two divine beast auras engulfed the area and could make anyone tremble. Two massive shadows appeared next to the maelstrom as well.

One was a golden dragon while the other was a white tiger.

“Sigh, no matter where I go, you keep haunting us.” The white tiger to the right had a domineering voice.

“You should be thanking me for helping you find the ancestral nest. Now, you have obtained atavism.” Li Qiye said.

“That is true.” The golden dragon on the left was much more friendly in comparison: “It is thanks to your help that we were able to find this place. Now, our bloodline is as pure as can be.”

“We also helped you out.” The tiger said.

“So what, you two would have been suppressed under that mountain still if it wasn’t for me.” Li Qiye retorted.

“Hmph.” The tiger had no response to this.

“It is an honor to see you again, Young Noble.” The dragon cordially said.

“Don’t even start, I’m sure he’s not here to bring us good news.” The tiger said.

“I see how it is, turning your back on an old friend after finding the ancestral nest.” Li Qiye sat down in space and said.

“Not to that extent, but everyone knows your unsavory reputation by now, Crow. You don’t visit for no reason, I’m sure you’re here to exploit us in some way again.” The tiger had a fiery temper.

“Well.” Li Qiye stroked his chin in response: “You two were so scrawny before but now, big and fat. Maybe I can really squeeze out something nice.”

“Stop dreaming.” The tiger retorted.

“Young Noble, we’re happy to see you again because after all, we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you. Unfortunately, due to our circumstances, we can’t follow you to battle like before.” The dragon politely said.

“I’m aware.” Li Qiye said.

“Dark Crow, we don’t owe you either, we cured the little girl and trained her into an invincible master.” The tiger said with pride.

They spent immense efforts on this matter and the result was absolutely transformative and unprecedented.

“I’ve guessed as much, and you two deserve all the merits for this.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Let’s not talk about debts like we’re strangers. But the girl really didn’t disappoint and she brightened up this place. She was with us for so long that we consider her family.” The dragon laughed happily.

In the past, they weren’t at her level, let alone being able to train someone to that level.

“That’s why I’m here relaxing and chatting, I remember what you have done and am grateful for it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I don’t feel any gratitude coming from you.” The tiger said: “Nothing good ever comes from your presence, only bullying.”

“Sigh, that’s hurtful and untrue when I’m such a nice person.” Li Qiye complained: “What can I do when my kindness is viewed as malice?”

He paused for a second before adding: “You should know that I am here with a gift.”

“No need.” The tiger had a bad feeling about this.

“Hahaha, we appreciate your goodwill, Young Noble, but we’re old now and just want to retire here.” The dragon felt the same way and became cautious.
