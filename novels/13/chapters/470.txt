Chapter 471: Treasure of the Oasis

Once Golden Child, the Hundred Clans Child, the Divine Spark Prince, and Ghost Monk teamed up, they would represent the most powerful force in this area as long as the descendants of the emperor’s lineages didn’t come.

They were famous and had great cultivations, so even if cultivators from the other races wanted to seize this treasure, they lacked the necessary might.

Qiurong Wanxue was amongst the cultivators from the other races and was going to leave along with this group, but Ghost Monk clasped his hands together and gazed at her with his fiery and ghastly eyes: “Chief Qiurong, please stay.”

Her heart sank as she pretended as if she didn’t hear him, thinking that the opponent might not necessarily be able to confirm that it was her.

Ghost Monk’s ghastly eyes narrowed as a dark smile appeared when he deepened his tone: “Chief Qiurong, do you want me to personally invite you out?” His eyes were firmly fixated on her.

Everyone was now staring at her so she couldn’t leave even if she wanted to.

“Thank you.” Qiurong Wanxue took a deep breath before she stepped out. She then shook her head to say: “I only came here for the experience. I have no intentions of getting a share of the treasure.”

Ghost Monk revealed a strange smile and said: “Chief Qiurong is too polite. You are also a ghost so of course you can stay behind. Maybe you can even get one or two treasures.”

“My Snow-shadow Tribe is only a small tribe, so we can’t handle great treasures. I do, however, appreciate your sincerity.” Qiurong Wanxue knew that this did not bode well, but she still calmly stated: “I have other business to attend to, goodbye.”

However, the moment she turned to leave, the Divine Spark Prince appeared and blocked her path. He sneered and declared: “Leaving isn’t impossible, but tell Li Qiye to come here to pick you up!”

The prince had been slapped several times by Li Qiye and had lost all face. How could he not try to repay this humiliation? Although his backing, the Ghost Insect Evil Child, was not here, he was confident that his current alliance could capture Li Qiye if Li Qiye came here. Then, the prince could wash away his shame.

Everyone was looking at her since they all knew she was Li Qiye’s companion. Moreover, they were the first ones here, arriving before everyone else.

The prince wanted to keep her behind not only to take revenge on Li Qiye, but also to find out some news from her.

In the end, Qiurong Wanxue was still a chief so she was able to stay calm in a bad situation. She spoke without any panic with a deep tone: “Divine Spark Prince, I don’t understand your intention. There are no grudges between us.”

“Although I have nothing against you, I do against Li Qiye.” The prince sneered: “You going together with Li Qiye was courting death!”

“Chief Qiurong, I trust that you can send a message to Li Qiye.” The Hundred Clans Child also chipped in with a smile: “Why don’t you stay here for now and wait to watch the treasure come into being? Then you can tell Li Qiye to come and pick you up as well. Would that be okay with you?”

Qiurong Wanxue shuddered inside. It was clear that this group had formed an alliance not only to find treasures at this place, but also to set a trap for Li Qiye after baiting him.

The cultivators who were chased away from the oasis were only watching from the distance. They didn’t know Qiurong Wanxue so naturally they would not take action to help her.

As for the cultivators inside the oasis, they were all on the side of the Divine Spark Prince, so they were certainly not going to help her. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Besieged, Qiurong Wanxue knew that whatever she did would lead towards a disaster. She took a deep breath and shook her head to say: “I’m afraid you have found the wrong person. Ever since we got here, Fellow Daoist Li and I went on our separate ways. I don’t know where he is at this moment. Moreover, we are merely acquaintances so I have no way of informing him.”

Although Qiurong Wanxue could indeed contact Li Qiye, she didn’t hope for her Young Noble to come to this place. If Li Qiye came to save her from the location with the prince and his alliance along with several thousand ghost experts, it would be akin to hopping into a pit trap.

No matter how strong he was, he most likely couldn’t deal with so many ghost experts working together.

“Hah, Chief Qiurong, if you don’t help us, then I’m afraid we can’t help you.” Ghost Monk revealed a dark smile and continued: “You are also a chief from a ghost tribe, so you should know that us ghost race members should be united and should wipe out pests like that human ant!”

“Chief Qiurong, even if you don’t think for yourself, you should still think about the Snow-shadow Tribe!” Golden Child slowly articulated a heartless threat.

They were clearly trying to intimidate her. Many shivered after hearing this because they knew that Golden Child’s words were not just baseless and overreaching.

Qiurong Wanxue’s expression greatly changed. Her tribe was only a minor clan; it could not reach the apex or even approach it. However, the Hundred Bones Sacred Tribe was a renowned great clan. Although it was not an emperor’s lineage, it was a giant monster. One of its fingers was enough to easily destroy the Snow-shadow Tribe.

She knew the consequences, but she still took a deep breath and replied with a deep, calm voice: “I have no connections to Fellow Daoist Li. If your tribe is going to destroy my Snow-shadow Tribe, then I have nothing else to say. Although we are only a small clan, we are not spineless. We will never succumb to your oppression!”

She had made up her mind about not putting Li Qiye in a dangerous situation.

Her powerful rhetoric earned her a lot of respect from the young cultivators of the other races. A small tribe like the Snow-shadow Tribe could not oppose a behemoth like the Hundred Bones Sacred Tribe. Even other great powers in the Nether Border would not want to mess with this tribe since this was the territory of the ghost race. One had to show proper restraint when dealing with them.

Moreover, the alliance showed that it was not just the sacred tribe at work here. A minor tribe like the Snow-shadow Tribe was weaker than an ant in the face of this alliance.

However, even against prodigies like Golden Child, Qiurong Wanxue, who hailed from a small tribe, still spoke powerfully without shrinking away. As a result, many people admired her courage.

“Why waste time talking with her?” The Divine Spark Prince looked at the increasingly brighter brilliance from the lake and impatiently said: “Just capture her. Then, we will see if a treasure is about to come out from this lake or not.”

“Chief Qiurong, if you choose to be unreasonable, then we have no choice but to ask you to stay here as a guest.” Compared to the Divine Spark Prince’s aggressiveness and Golden Child’s heartlessness, the Hundred Clans Child had much better manners.

Qiurong Wanxue’s expression darkened. She knew that she would not be able to escape today.

The moment the Hundred Clans Child was about to take action, a lazy voice came from afar: “Oh? You want to hold my people hostage? Did you ask for my permission?”

Everyone couldn’t help but look over towards the direction of the voice and found that Li Qiye was quickly approaching. In the blink of an eye, he had already reached the oasis. Everyone had different reactions to his arrival.

“The next generation’s Fierce has come!”

Mo Lidao was known as a ferocious man in the southern Distant Cloud, so Li Qiye was known as “Fierce” after stomping Mo Lidao to death.

“Young Noble!” Qiurong Wanxue was both happy and scared to see him. She was happy to see Li Qiye, but she was scared because the alliance was ready to deal with him so he was in a precarious situation.

Qiurong Wanxue quickly winked at him, signaling him to leave as soon as possible since the Divine Spark Prince had gathered thousands of experts here to take care of him!

Li Qiye smiled and slowly walked towards the oasis without a care for the big alliance. He then slowly spoke: “A bunch of men bullying a lady — is this the honor of your ghost race?”

“Li, you came just in time!” The Divine Spark Prince said as he gritted his teeth. After being slapped several times, he suffered from extraordinary shame and humiliation and hoped for revenge.

He hated Li Qiye to the bones and wished that he could peel Li Qiye’s skin and tear apart his tendons, then beat him down to his knees to wash away the shame.

Unfortunately, his brother-in-law went to capture the Scarletflame Qilin and the Ghost Insect Evil Child was immersed in the dao. The Divine Spark Prince was powerless even if he wanted revenge.

However, in the current situation, he was working together with the group of Ghost Monk, the Hundred Clans Child, and Golden Child. They huddled together along with many other disciples from the great powers, causing their camp’s power to surge.

Regarding strength, cultivation and status, the Divine Spark Prince was not a match for the other four. However, these geniuses were looking for a breakthrough.

They were talented geniuses in the Sacred Nether World, elites with great cultivations. However, the descendants from the emperor’s lineages, the Titanic Crescent Saint Child and the Ghost Insect Evil Child loomed over their heads. Even Jian Xuan was no exception.

Competing against these imperial descendants would be extremely difficult in the future. They felt that it was better to join Di Zuo’s camp. Once he becomes an Immortal Emperor later on, they would be bestowed titles and countries and would have the same amount of power as imperial descendants.

Because of this, this group banded together.

Now, they all stared at Li Qiye. This could be described as “the path is always narrow for enemies.” The Divine Spark Prince’s eyes were filled with fury. He wished that he could stomp Li Qiye down to the ground at this very moment, but he knew that Li Qiye was very powerful and he was not stupid enough to rush over.

Ghost Monk, Golden Child, and the Hundred Clans Child looked at each other and were eager to give it a try. They didn’t plan on fighting him solo and instead wanted to work together to capture Li Qiye in an instant.

They were all geniuses of the Sacred Nether World, so they were very confident that they could capture the lone Li Qiye if they were to join forces.
