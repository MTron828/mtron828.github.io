Chapter 4726: Just In Time

Juntian’s choice surprised some people. He was clearly not a match for Li Qiye so without the protection of his sect or allies, death was inevitable.

“Dao Brother, the curtain for the dao lord competition has been lifted today.” The young emperor said before turning his eyes toward Li Qiye.

They pulsed with a regal aura as he said: “There is a long way to go on this dangerous path. Fellow Daoist Li, you don’t have a problem with us starting now, do you?”

As long as geniuses wanted to become the dao lord, this competition was inevitable. This suggestion from the young emperor could have a reaching impact on all great powers. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t have a problem with people courting death.” Li Qiye responded: “Start it then, we’ll see how much waves this competition can create.”

“We admire your fearlessness, Dao Brother.” Five-sun King laughed and joined in: “All of us wish to become the dao lord so a battle between us can’t be avoided. Today is as good as any day to start this competition.”

“The curtain is lifting.” The crowd members saw the declaration of war at last.

“It's finally here.” A big shot said softly: “The five conquerors have started the competition, it’s just that we have Li Qiye now too.”

Ample theory-crafting went into predicting the winner of the five conquerors. Everything was possible, whether it be alliances or one-on-one duels. No one expected a new variable to be thrown into the mix - Li Qiye.

“This is not a personal fight, I hope you understand, Fellow Daoist. If you have reinforcement and dao protectors, it is time to invite them as well.” The young emperor said: “We, True Immortal, will obtain the dao lord position at all costs in this generation.”

He was frank with his intention and gave Li Qiye time to prepare, that he was facing all of True Immortal.

“The elders of the east will support me as well. Dao Brother, summon your protectors.” Five-sun King said.

“An all-out war soon enough. This will make the potential candidates clear soon enough.” A spectator knew that there would be more competitors than just these three.

“This is expected. Li Qiye is simply monstrous. The more time they give him to grow, the more unfavorable it’ll be for them. Once he reaches a certain level, not even True Immortal can suppress him.” An ancient ancestor from a prestigious clan observed.

“Right, a case similar to Emperor Ye who crippled True Immortal without becoming a dao lord. They went all out and it still wasn’t enough.” Another ancestor said.

Many compared Li Qiye to Emperor Ye at this point. In that generation, True Immortal sent out numerous monarchs and ancient ancestors only to lose.

“I alone am enough to slay all my foes.” Li Qiye smiled.

This declaration shocked all listeners. The dao lord competition required the power of sect or even an entire race. Its climax included thousands and thousands of top masters and awakening ancient ancestors.

They took a deep breath and thought that he was insanely domineering for choosing to be alone.

“Another Emperor Ye.” A crowd member commented.

Five-sun King and True Immortal Young Emperor didn’t expect this answer. They had declared the start of the competition and knew that they would have the support of their sect. It might not mobilize all men but the ancient ancestors would do their best to help them.

They were clear with this intention and told Li Qiye to make preparation as well. They were sure that he would have his own dao protectors and allies. For example, Ancestral Divine Temple and Lion’s Roar. After all, Paramount Goddess was here to stop the two monarchs. This verified the rumors of him having Lion’s Roar as a backer.

This new information was still acceptable and even expected by the two conquerors. This was just part of the game.

Alas, Li Qiye didn’t bother summoning any help. He was actually ready to fight all of them.

“The monarchs of True Immortal and the saints of the east will come soon.” Shen Juntian warned: “Dao Brother, I’m afraid you alone won’t be enough.”

He reminded Li Qiye that Five-sun King and the young emperor won’t fight him by themselves. They would absolutely, and wisely, rely on their sect.

“Slaying those monarchs and saints? I alone am enough.” Li Qiye smiled and paid it no mind.
