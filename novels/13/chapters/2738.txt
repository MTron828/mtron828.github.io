The old man cleared his throat and continued: “Our little girl, hmm, she’s always been arrogant. Though she doesn’t act like it, I can see her high standards, not putting any man in her eyes, let alone liking one. Sigh, she’s not young anymore but has no time to find a nice husband. Now, we have the perfect opportunity, young man. I really think the two of you are perfect for each other, so let’s go for it. It’ll satisfy this old man’s wish of being able to hold a cute little baby later.”

He smiled and patted his thigh, seemingly very happy while imagining a cute baby later.

“Grandpa, our ancestor is picky too, not just anyone is a good match for him.” Ruoxi still added despite being forced to the side.

Weizheng didn’t stop her this time and only smiled wryly.

“That makes the match even better. Our little girl is definitely well-suited for him.” The old man became serious: “I don’t dare to comment about other things but she’s as pretty as a fairy with perfect features, definitely worthy of being called the fairest. As for her natural talents, she’s quick-witted, intelligent, and wise...”

The old man didn’t hold back with the praises as if she was the most peerless woman in the world and could only be found up above.

“Really?” Ruoxi was skeptical to hear this.

“Of course.” The old man said seriously: “When our little girl shows up, all others will start feeling inadequate and are completely overshadowed.”

“If your lady is really this beautiful and smart, I’m sure she has plenty of suitors and can pick any of them. Why do you want to match her up with our ancestor then?” Ruoxi asked.

“You don’t get it.” The old man patiently said: “Regular people aren’t worthy of our little girl. Even the geniuses and talents are ignored by her for they are no match for her peerlessness. Plus, this marriage proposal is all about fate. I can see that these two are connected by the heaven...”

“But our ancestor and your lady haven’t even met each other, how can you be so sure?” Ruoxi continued.

“That’s why fortune reading is magical. I can tell just from looking at their palm and know that they’re meant to be husband and wife.” The old man said: “I’ve never been wrong before, yes, they’re meant to be together.”

“It’s really that magical? Grandpa, then have a look at mine too.” She stretched her hand forward.

The old man didn’t accept it and only took a glance before shaking his head: “Fortune telling is predicated on fate too. Without this connection, forcefully reading the future is leaking the heaven’s mandate, I can’t do that.”

“Stingy.” Ruoxi murmured.

“This is really fate though, it just drops down on your lap without needing to search for it. If you have no objection, young man, then this marriage proposal is settled.” The old man turned his attention back towards Li Qiye.

The group didn’t know what to do. This was the strange marriage proposal since the two main parties have yet to meet.

“I’ll take your silence as a yes.” The old man laughed: “Then it’s a deal. Come to our clan when you have time later and propose...”

“Sir, this won’t do. Our ancestor has sealed his six senses and can’t hear anything. It’s not that he agreed with you, it’s that he couldn’t hear you.” Weizheng had no choice but to stop the old man from doing everything on a whim.

“It’s fine, it’s fine, the decision is already made. This marriage will be the biggest event of this generation. People will sing songs about them.” The old man happily said.

Having said that, he searched in his chest pocket and took out something - a jade pendant exuding green wisps of light.

It seemed like a world of green, not made from a piece of jade but refined from a lake with green water, hence the rippling waves of light.

It had complicated patterns too that no one could decipher because the pendant wasn’t complete. This was only one-half of the whole thing.

Even a fool could tell that it was an amazing treasure. Its owner must be extremely wealthy or an important person.

“Hehe, this is the symbol of the marriage.” The old man laughed: “Our little girl has the other half. Put them together for a perfect piece again. Young man, bring this with you when you come to propose.” Having said that, he put the incomplete pendant around Li Qiye’s neck.

“Sir...” It was too late for Weizheng to stop the old man.

“Okay, I’ve finished one of my wishes, it’s time to leave.” The old man seemed very satisfied and took out his umbrella.

“Young man, come propose soon, don’t make our little one wait for too long.” He added before leaving the pavilion. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The group became speechless. Marriage was probably the most important thing for a girl. Their seniors always took it very seriously but this old man did it in such a trivial manner.

They have yet to meet this he had made this decision and even left a symbol of marriage behind. This was strange in both the mortal and the cultivation world.

“Sir...” Weizheng calmed down and ran out but the old man was nowhere to be found.

“He’s not there.” Jiankun’s group ran out too but the path was empty.

They clearly saw him walking out earlier but he disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.

“Don’t tell me we’ve just seen a ghost...” The naive Ruoxi shouted in horror.

They have killed so many monsters in recent days but she was still just a young girl. Something as ominous as a “ghost” still frightened her.

“No...” Zhiting felt a chill after hearing this too.

“Ghosts don’t exist. The so-called ‘ghosts’ are just monsters playing around. We’ve actually met a master just now.” Weizheng shook his head and sighed.

“What should we do, School Master?” Jiahui looked at the pendant and asked.

“I don’t know.” Weizheng got a headache. Their ancestor suddenly got a fiance out of nowhere.

The worst part is that they have become witnesses to this proposal.

“Hey, the rain stopped...” Jiankun noticed.

It was quite a coincidence. The heavy downpour stopped right after the old man left.

“Let’s go.” Weizheng had no choice but to wait for Li Qiye to wake up and deal with this issue. It was beyond his station.

He knew that the old man was a true master and he couldn’t have stopped it anyway.
