Chapter 4459: The Thing

“It’s fine to explore and search, it doesn’t make a difference.” Li Qiye said.

There was already an agreement between him and the old ghost. A pact between characters like them was eternal. Millions of years could pass but they were eternal overlords. There was no time limit to the pact.

Thus, the parties’ lineages were constrained by the clauses. It’s just that the descendants didn’t know about the exact details.

“I understand.” The creature bowed again.

It was one of the rare beings who knew about the peerless item. However, it harbored no intention of taking it from Li Qiye. The consequence would be unthinkable; even their lineage would be affected.

In fact, if it had tried to do anything, its ancestor would be the first one to kill it for being unfilial. Moreover, the pact was actually more important since it was a promise of prosperity. Their lineage would continue to prosper during this epoch.

“We never dared to think about the item but we can assist you in finding it, Sir.” The creature said. This was an order given by its ancestor.

“No need, you all don’t have the right conditions to leave yet, the restraint for your lineage is still there. Doing so will be detrimental so don’t rally them.” Li Qiye refused: “Plus, it might be rather close, it won’t be hard for me to get it.”

“I understand, I will relay your message to everyone.” The creature said.

Li Qiye then looked around again for a bit before speaking: “Your old man isn’t doing well, he’s gasping for air.”

“Well, I do not dare to speculate the ancestor’s plans. I just know that there are still shadows looming over our world, not only from the other lineages but mysterious things.” The creature said.

“Mysterious things.” Li Qiye chuckled and started observing again.

“I won’t come to any hasty conclusion, I just have the feeling that there are still things outside of this world, always spying on us. It might just be pessimism but one day, the races of Eight Desolaces and even my lineage might become food.” It was worried about this matter.

Due to its powerful cultivation, it could sense things that others couldn’t. Alas, it had too many constraints and couldn’t explore any further.

“They still haven’t given up.” Li Qiye stroked his chin and smirked.

This smirk naturally frightened the creature since Li Qiye looked like a beast searching for the next prey, eager to reveal its fangs. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Then, it saw Li Qiye’s eyes and realized that Li Qiye was actually looking at something. It wasn’t just imagining things.

They were considered untouchable existences but Li Qiye could easily devour them, not leaving a single bone behind. Violating Li Qiye’s domain meant a death without a burial regardless of the mysterious beings’ power.

“Years aren’t enough to kill ambition. They still think that they’re rulers. How foolish.” The smirk gradually disappeared off his face.

The creature no longer dared to talk, thinking that others should be smart enough to stay hidden. Otherwise, they would die a terrible death for provoking Li Qiye.

“This is just a speculation of mine, nothing more.” It elaborated.

“It has nothing to do with you.” Li Qiye smiled: “They’re delusional. Just because they had grasped their own epoch, they believe that they can return to this one too.”

He paused for a bit before continuing: “They didn’t even have the courage to fight against the heaven. It doesn’t matter how strong they are, they’re still cowards. If they don’t hide in their shell this time, I’ll show them a horrific end.”

The creature rembled after hearing this. He was indeed a being above their level right now - someone who had fought the heaven and still returned alive, retaining his power and freedom.

In fact, he was the lord of this epoch. Those who wanted to take advantage of the situation would be suicidal, akin to a mortal challenging a primordial beast.

“Your old man is wise.” Li Qiye suddenly commented: “Your lineage has been quite fortunate thanks to the karma accumulated by him. Try and enjoy it instead of making stupid mistakes, he won’t be able to save you all then.”

“I will remember your guidance, Sir.” The creature bowed.

“I’m leaving now but I’ll visit the old man when I have time.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Have a good trip, Sir. And your disciple?” The creature asked.

“Let him taste some hardship here for training.” Li Qiye waved his hand and then disappeared from sight.
