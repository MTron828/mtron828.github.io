Chapter 5271: How Manly

Li Qiye and the woman were as intimate as can be, causing others to have strange thoughts.

Of course, no one else was here in the audience with the exception of the old servant and Li Zhitian. Both have turned away, not wanting to be impolite.

“Sigh, how much longer are we going to do this? We’re killing the grasses.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You’re tearing my clothes too.” She complained.

“Uh… please don’t get this twisted, you’re the one grinding on me.” Li Qiye said.

“And?” She seemed intent on annoying him.

“Sigh, fine, you win. No Lis in this world can compete with you.” He raised his hands and surrendered.

“Giving up, right?” She grabbed his wrists with one hand while searching for something with the other.

“What are you looking for?” He smiled helplessly.

“Just coping a feel.” She said while still moving her hand around.

“If you keep doing this, I can’t gain my innocence back even after jumping into the yellow river. Just tell me what you’re looking for, I know what I have on me the best.” He complained.

“Hard to say, I’m just checking to see if you have made a deal.” She stared at him.

“A deal?” He stopped messing around and glared back at her ordinary face: “Who are you?”

His eyes became profound again, wanting to see through her.

She arched her chest and said: “Your noisy and intrusive habit won’t change. Keep on looking then.”

“It’s a good thing I don’t have a nosebleed right now or you will accuse me of being an old pervert.” Li Qiye sighed.

“I’m afraid that even being an old pervert is beyond your capabilities.” She mocked.

This prompted him to break free of her grip and flipped her back to the bottom again, gaining the absolute upper hand.

“Does this make you feel more of a man?” She asked.

“No, but as a man, I didn’t appreciate your comment regarding my health.” He smiled and shook his head.

“This is the perfect time to check.” She said provocative.

“We can’t do this in broad daylight.” He said.

“Listen, it’s okay if you have a health issue, no need to keep on hiding it.” She said.

“Are you sure?” He activated his aura and grabbed her hands tightly: “My apology then.”

“Finally.” She showed no sign of fear.

“You’ve been asking for it this entire time. Now, will you take it off first?” He said.

“Try it if you dare.” She said.

“I don’t think you can take my full force before being reduced to ashes.” He said.

“Strong words, we’ll see if you can back it up.” She glared at him.

“Very well, I will show you how manly I am!” He shouted and activated his divine intent.

Three thousand words were only a grain of salt in the ocean compared to the immensity of his mind. Thus, she became helpless and was pulled into its flow.

“Can you still handle it now?” The master of the mind ocean spoke with an imperious voice.

“Bring it.” She said.

“Don’t say that I’m cheating now.” Li Qiye laughed and sent his ocean forward.

“Activate!” She created one heavenly gate after another to protect her mind.

“Rumble!” Unfortunately, the countless layers couldn’t handle Li Qiye’s mental attack, causing her to moan in pain.

She was eventually overwhelmed and his divine intent invaded her mind. It was too late for her to resist his unstoppable momentum.

“Boom!” In the deepest and most profound part of her mind came a devastating blast.

“This is…” Li Qiye’s expression soured as he tried to create a barrier around the source of the explosion.

This bought her enough time to escape his grip. She leaped into the air and disappeared from sight, her voice lingered from a distance: “Li, this isn’t over yet!”

“So suicidal.” Li Qiye got up and murmured: “So hellbent on taking me down even if it means dying.”

He pondered for a moment before shaking his head and dropping the issue.

Now, the old servant and Li Zhitian were finally able to turn around, acting as if they didn’t hear anything.

“Another victory, Master.” The old servant bowed.

“Isn’t it too late to start flattering me?” Li Qiye said.

“It came from the heart.” The quiet old man spoke more than usual.

“She’s the legendary…” Li Zhitian tried to calm down. That woman earlier was frightening since she made him feel helpless despite having twelve sacred fruits.

“It’s just a title, doesn’t mean much.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Why are there two similar titles?” The old servant asked.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You should ask them, why is there a title for each sex?” Li Qiye said while looking up at the sky. He remembered a few things but they didn’t quite apply to this situation.

“You owe her something?” Li Zhitian became curious. The man before him was powerful enough to not owe anyone but she certainly made it seems that way.

“I don’t know.” Li Qiye himself thought that too many unexpected things have happened recently.

‘What are you doing, villainous heaven?’ He thought to himself.

“Well, whatever, let’s go drink again.” He clapped and told the two with a smile.

Once they got close to the entrance, the tavern suddenly jumped away. It grew four legs and started running.

“Let’s keep up.” Li Qiye told the others.
