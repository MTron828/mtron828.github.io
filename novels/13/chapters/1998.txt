The main building of Study Room was quite large with many architectures connecting together, resembling a small city.

Though these buildings and pavilions were right next to each other, there wasn’t an imposing or grand aura. Each building was exquisitely built and gave a scholarly aura.

The things in abundance here were naturally books of all shapes and forms - old manuals, ones made out of wood or jade...

Some said that this was certainly the biggest stockpile of books in the world.

Alas, the majority of them had nothing to do with cultivation. One would be hard pressed to find a merit law in this place. Of course, some got through the net and a few big shots purposely hid merit laws here. Nevertheless, they were quite hard to find, waiting for the fated ones.

Outside of the academy’s effort, others also donated books. Emperors and High Gods helped out as well.

The great powers were more than happy to give historical scrolls to the academy because this could be a good place to store their ancestors’ achievements and glory and their kingdoms’ expansion for an eternity. Even if their kingdoms were to be destroyed, they would still be recorded in this place.

As for the merit laws that were hidden in this place, the most famous one was probably the complete version of the Mortal Reversion Art, found by the Ancient God.

As Qianxuan took Li Qiye inside, a girl who was reading quickly put her book down and went to greet them.

She wore a simple and rather cheap-looking dress. Her white face was without make-up as her soft hair draped over her shoulders. Her eyes were especially bright, albeit without a flash of confidence. Delicate and gentle - the type that would make one have the urge to protect and love.

She became anxious after seeing Qianxuan and didn’t know how to react. Qianxuan was simply too famous at the academy for a multitude of reasons. Others could only become her fans, not her peers.

Thus, her sudden appearance here made the girl awkward. Few people came to Study Room, let alone a famous teacher.

“Teacher...” The girl nervously greeted, not knowing where to place her hands.

“You’re Ye Xinxue, right?” Qianxuan recalled her name.

Despite her nervous state, she was still quite elated when Qingxuan remembered her name.

“Yes, Teacher.” She nodded three times; this little excitement was quite cute.

“This is Young Noble Li. he will be your teacher from now on and is in charge of Study Room.” Qianxuan introduced.

The excited girl was taken aback. Their Study Room never had an actual teacher due to the low enrollment number. The teachers didn’t want to teach just three students in this place, it would be a waste of their energy. Thus, students from Study Room also went to the Hundred Halls for the lectures. Of course, no one cared whether they went or not because cultivation wasn’t their main focus.

The girl was surprised because someone actually wanted to come to Study Room for the three of them.

“Nice to meee-t you, Teacher.” She quickly bowed toward Li Qiye.

“Good. I’ll be staying here from now on.” Li Qiye withdrew his gaze from the books and told Qianxuan.

“As you wish, Young Noble.” Qianxuan nodded. In fact, the other teachers all had their own grottos and enjoyed great treatments. No one would want to stay with the students, but she didn’t dare to say anything.

“Is there anything else you would like, Young Noble?” She asked respectfully.

“No, just don’t disturb me, I’ll be researching in the upcoming days.” Li Qiye waved his hand and said.

“I will certainly pass on your message to the elders.” Qianxuan didn’t dare to show any slight and told him. This supreme existence was surely going to do some incredible research here.

“Go now.” Li Qiye ordered.

Qianxuan didn’t dare to waste his time. She told Xinxue a couple of things before drifting away like a goddess.

Xinxue stood there - petrified - after seeing the conversation between the two. Not to mention the students, even the teachers were respectful towards Qianxue due to her cultivation, background, and beauty.

But now, this ordinary-looking man, no, teacher, had this type of attitude towards Qianxue. He waved his hand as if her godlike status didn’t matter at all.

“Little girl, why are you just standing there?” Li Qiye flicked her forehead and said.

She immediately regained her wits and turned red from acting so silly in front of a teacher. She spoke quietly: “Teacher, please, please come over here, to your place.”

There were too many empty rooms in this place. It wasn’t a problem for Study Room to accommodate fifty thousand students. Thus, Li Qiye easily got a place.

Nevertheless, she still found the best pavilion for him. It took up an entire peak by itself and had a full view of Study Room. When standing in this place surrounded by clouds, one could actually reach for the stars.

Li Qiye didn’t need to say anything. Xinxue moved around like a spinning top, cleaning and sweeping the pavilion until not a speck of dust remained. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After she finished, Li Qiye nonchalantly sat down and looked at the girl with sweats dropping down her forehead.

“Why did you pick Study Room? Others rather go to Hundred Halls or something else.” He carefully analyzed her.

She was nervous to be under his gaze. She felt as if nothing could hide from him, that she was staring naked before his all-seeing gaze.

“My...” It took a long time before she answered with a soft voice: “My family... can’t afford the fees for Hundred Halls.”

She lowered her head in shame after admitting this. Li Qiye responded with a smile: “What do you like the most here?”

There was no oppressive aura or divinity, but his leisure stare was scarier than everything else.

She didn’t dare to lie to him and whispered: “I like... reading the books here.”

“Hmm, there are indeed countless books here, some are quite interesting. Though they can’t improve one’s cultivation like the merit laws, but they can grant you a lifetime of benefit and higher vision. A few records from the emperors are especially profound and insightful.” Li Qiye nodded seriously.

She completely agreed with his statement so her eyes lit up: “You’re right, Teacher. There are so many things here, rumors about the emperors that no one else know about. Some even had stories about the nine worlds, the elders and seniors don’t want to talk about this matter.”

The girl was a bookworm since an early age. Of course, the things she read were considered a waste of time by cultivators, such as historical scrolls.

Nevertheless, she viewed these books as treasures and always enjoyed reading them.
