The crowd has been waiting patiently. Alas, some disciples began clamoring after seeing how high the sun was.

The ones who disliked Li Qiye became even more annoyed.

One of them looked up at the sun and complained: “This Li Qiye is too arrogant, he’s late and making everyone wait on him.”

“He cares about face too much, all the elders are here now, does he want the elders to greet him or something?” A demon added.

However, they only talked among themselves because the chief elder and Zhang Yue didn’t say anything.

“He might be afraid and ran away already.” A friend of Huang Ning purposely agitated the impatient crowd.

A few exchanged glances, especially the demons. “Maybe you’re right, he could have run down the mountain already.”

“If that’s the case, the humans will lose all face.” Another snorted.

This didn’t meet without retribution. Li Qiye’s fans who were humans immediately jumped in.

“Hmph, you think too highly of yourself. Li Qiye isn’t afraid of anyone, those two aren’t stronger than the Shu Brothers. He wasn’t afraid of samadhi cultivators at all, let alone weaker combatants. What a joke.” One human sneered.

“For sure, just this little battle is nothing for Junior Brother Li, it’s completely insignificant.” Others chimed in.

Reaching the ancestral peak had given him the status of an idol, especially for the humans. Next, he earned the status of a hero after the skirmish with Three Truths.

His domineering style left others in admiration and made them feel safe. After all, everyone hoped that their peers would rise up and help them during moments of danger.

Meanwhile, Zhan Hu and Huang Ning standing on stage didn’t like that Li Qiye had so many supporters, feeling awfully annoyed.

Previously, everyone in Divine Black supported them since they were the pride of the sect. Alas, Li Qiye had stolen their spotlight. Their status and influence waned as a result.

“That’s probably just a stroke of luck.” A demon coldly uttered.

“Feel free to try, maybe you can get just as lucky. In fact, not to mention the pinnacle, make it up one hundred steps and I’ll accept my inferiority.” One human barked back instantly.

The demons shut up because that was something they couldn’t do. Not even Huang Ning and Zhan Hu could do so, let alone them.

Though their words were tough, they knew to keep their mouth shut when lost instead of asking for further humiliation.

“He’s here!” It was late noon when the spectators finally saw Li Qiye appearing in the distance.

He was still sleeping on his carriage, seemingly not ready for battle in the slightest.

The children from Liu carried the carriage over, making him look like a young master from the mortal world. Qianyue walked next to him just like a maid. He didn’t even wake up after getting up on stage.

The disciples exchanged glances. Not even the chief elder and Zhang Yue got carriages. They simply walked here.

Was walking really that arduous for this young master?

No one else in all of Divine Black would put up this type of haughty act, not even Ping Suoweng.

“Hmph! He thinks too highly of himself!” A demon murmured.

Of course, since the elders didn’t say anything, they also didn’t dare to criticize him straight to his face.

In a sense, he was qualified to do so after reaching the top of the ancestral peak.

“Young Master, we’re here.” Qianyue got closer and whispered to him.

Everyone saw the entire thing. Li Qiye was still relaxing like a noble used to a pampered lifestyle. He even got a beautiful maid to wake him up in such a gentle manner.

Plus, this maid was their sect’s number one genius. One couldn’t ask for more in life.

Resting on a beauty’s lap; waking up to decide the fate of the world. People thought about this particular adage after seeing this scene.

It aptly manifested in Li Qiye, causing everyone to be jealous and startled.

A fire of rage engulfed Huang Ning. This was something he had always dreamt about but wasn’t lucky enough.

Normally, Qianyue kept a distance from everyone. They considered her to be an unreachable goddess. Many worked so hard just to earn a verbal exchange or a smile from her.

Just one interaction was enough to excite them for several days, akin to drinking the finest wine. They were willing to die just to be in Li Qiye’s shoes right now. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Thus, glares of jealousy shot towards him.

He slowly opened his eyes and still looked drowsy: “Already?”

“Oh, everyone’s here so early too.” He looked around and smiled.

Some jealous disciples truly despised him for being so close to Qianyue. They hoped that he would die in the duel today.

Zhan Hu and Huang Ning didn’t have a pleasant expression either. Zhan Hu scowled: “This is too pompous, even for you.”

“You can’t delay this much longer, today will be your end.” Huang Ning threatened.

“I’m merely taking my time in order to let you two live a little longer.” Li Qiye chuckled.
