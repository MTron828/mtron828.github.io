Chapter 4622: True Immortal Spirit

The conversation stopped since they didn’t wish to gossip about the behemoths. These sects were unbeatable and could destroy just about anyone.

It was best not to antagonize them, let alone oppose them. No one wanted death or even worse, clan or sect extermination.

Some cultivators might be fearless enough to take the risk personally. Alas, they had to think about their families and fellow sect members.

Therefore, they exchanged glances after hearing Li Qiye’s overbearing comment.

“Why would he offend two behemoths together?” One expert calmed down and whispered. Just one alone was problematic enough.

“Friend, you have quite an attitude.” A dignified voice echoed in waves and suffocated listeners.

Just the words alone showed how powerful the speaker was. It seemed that he could roar and take down a city wall.

Radiance pulsed in and out and eventually, a youth walked out from the center. He wore silver armor with flowing runes on the surface. The shoulder plates resembled wings. He had a seal between his eyebrows, one belonging to the charming spirit race.

The seal was rather obvious as if it has been carved into the bones and the soul. This was proof of his power, enough to contend against anyone in the young generation.

“True Immortal Spirit!” The mass recognized him.

“One of the Six Stars of True Immortal.” One youth blurted out.

“Wow, look at him…” A female disciple couldn’t hide her admiration.

There was no doubt that True Immortal Spirit’s fame, power, and likeability far exceeded Voidbur Godcihld.

“So he’s the candidate for marriage from True Immortal.” Everyone understood right away.

“That shows that they’re rather sincere with the proposal.” Old experts admitted this.

Other suitors saw him and became dejected. One of them said: “Looks like it’s decided already, Golden Gate can’t refuse.”

The current True Immortal had plenty of geniuses. The most brilliant were referred to as the Six Stars and True Immortal Spirit was one of them.

“He’s a direct disciple of Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor, a higher-ranking member among the six too. His master adores him so he is a prominent member of the sect. The fact that he is here in person speaks plenty.” Another said.

Among the Six Stars, True Immortal Young Emperor was naturally at the top. The master’s disciple, Six-winged Emissary, didn’t even make the list. From this, one could see how exceptional their young generation was.

True Immortal Spirit wasn’t an ordinary disciple either. He was a direct disciple of Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor.

Just this alone indicated greatness. He didn’t let his master down either and eventually surpassed his peers.

“I have to admit that True Immortal Spirit is more than enough to be a good candidate, Miss Ye.” The daoist told Ye Tingrong. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Right.” She admitted because this was objectively true.

“True Immortal is serious about this.” Paramount Scion said.

She only sighed and smiled wryly. In terms of power, her sect would be climbing up True Immortal in a potential marriage alliance. Nonetheless, they sent one of their Six Prodigies, not a regular member.

In fact, numerous female disciples would love to have a similar marriage situation. Alas, Ye Tingrong felt rather conflicted.

She didn’t hate True Immortal Spirit since they had only met a few times. She only hated being used as a tool and not having control of her own fate.

Most importantly, True Immortal was scheming for her ancestor’s treasure so the matter was more complicated and sinister.

If they were to refuse to hand the treasure over, their in-laws might no longer be friendly and would choose to speak using the blades.

On the other hand, Jian Ming didn’t like the comment. He laughed and said: “What makes him so special? He’s just another tool in this marriage proposal.”

“If Golden Gate doesn’t have a better option, they’ll most likely pick True Immortal. He is a good candidate for a son-in-law. No matter how you look at it, he is in the lead.” The daoist instigated.

“Hmph, not necessarily. Miss Ye won’t necessarily pick him.” Jian Ming snorted.

Ye Tingrong opened her mouth but eventually refrained from speaking. She didn’t want to tell others how inconsequential her opinion was in this decision. In one sense, the decision was up to Golden Gate but given the current circumstances, it was even beyond their control.

Meanwhile, True Immortal Spirit approached. His aura still pulsed like the relentless waves of an ocean hitting the face, making it hard for others to endure.
