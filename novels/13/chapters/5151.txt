Chapter 5152: The Pact Of Blessed

The affairs of the world resembled a game of go. Each move contained indescribable intricacies.

Windchaser Conqueror could only analyze a small corner of the match. To do more meant risking serious mental damage.

As for the middle-aged man, he fared better by taking in the entire board at once. Alas, he couldn’t comprehend the grand scheme and could only come up with minor moves.

Jun Landu began having difficulty navigating the match and became stuck in its indiscernible power.

After observing and realizing his inadequacies, the middle-aged man cupped his fist toward Windchaser Conqueror: “Fellow Daoist, you are in trouble.”

“I seek your counsel in light of these circumstances.” Windchaser understood.

“Heavenly Sword School are the hounds of Heaven Alliance. This is an arrow aimed at you and Fellow Daoist Harkrain.” The man said.

“I’m aware.” Windchaser said.

“The Pact of Blessed will be ineffective soon, everyone will have to make a choice.” The man said.

“Is this Dao Alliance’s will as well? All-things Dao Lord wants everyone to pick a side?” Windchaser’s tone became cold.

“You misunderstood, it is only a reminder of the current situation. Dao Alliance has not and will not force anyone to do anything. It’s just that if anyone needs help, we are willing to help. This applies to you right now, Fellow Daoist.” The man said.

“There’s no free lunch in this world.” Windchaser said.

“Don’t be so on guard.” The man smiled: “We only want to tell you that the enemy of our enemy is an ally.”

“Harkrain and I have no intention of being dragged into this mess. We only seek the dao, not participate in the racial conflict.” Windchaser shook his head.

“I’m afraid it is not up to you. In my opinion, Supreme will gather his allies soon. Those who do not join will be persecuted.” The man said.

“Hmph.” Windchaser scowled.

“Just watch, Fellow Daoist. They will be knocking on your door soon.” The man said.

“That’s fine, if they want a fight, they got it. We are not afraid of death.” Windchaser responded.

“I see, an impressive mindset.” The man said honestly.

Meanwhile, a power engulfed Windchaser Hall. The sect was already on guard and warning gongs could be heard everywhere.

“Intruders, state your name!” The first brother of Windchaser, Thunderspear Saint Child, led the ancestors into battle.

The clouds dissipated and they saw a cavalry with rampant sword energy. The rays came together and formed a seal around their sect.

“What is the meaning of this, Heavenly Sword School?!” He shouted.

“What else but blood for blood?” An ancient ancestor from there shouted: “Your conqueror killed our disciples so we shall slaughter you today!”

“Clank!” A sword formation appeared above. Countless swords descended, destroying everything along the way.

“Activate!” Thunderspear roared and led his fellow disciples into creating conqueror-level barriers.

His two sacred fruits became resplendent and engulfed in lightning. He turned into a god as he threw his spear at the sword formation above.

“Boom!” Numerous swords crumbled but this still wasn’t enough to break the offensive formation.

The news of the assault spread across the upper continents and alarmed everyone. Ancestors arrived to observe the fight.

Heavenly Sword School attacked Windchaser Hall without any warning. Normally, two great powers would have a formal declaration of war first. There was a process before the actual mobilization.

This attack was considered despicable and lowly, no different from an ambush.

“They’ll bite anyone after being given an order by Supreme.” A big shot said with disdain.

In fact, even members of The Race looked down on Heavenly Sword for its shameless conduct in the past.

“To be fair, Windchaser Conqueror killed several ancient ancestors from there two days ago, this is blood for blood.” An ancient ancestor said.

“Hmph!” The majority of both sides didn’t agree with this comment.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A dragon lord from Heaven Alliance snorted and said: “The world knows of Windchaser and Harkrain Conqueror’s unofficial relationship. She already has a dao companion yet Heavenly Sword Godmonarch still proposed? Who is the one in the wrong here?”

“They are definitely trying to stir the pot.” Another big shot added.

“This is Supreme’s idea, not theirs.” A member of Heaven Alliance whispered: “Seems like our group is pushing for unification.”

“The Pact of Blessed is no different than a piece of scrapped paper now.” Someone lamented.

In reality, some from The Race didn’t wish for this. After all, the agreement allowed everyone to live in harmony. Its nullification meant potentially returning to war again.

“I think this is the case, Sword Sea Dao Lord might be as aggressive as Supreme.” Another whispered.

“I’m sure Dao and Imperial Alliance will counterattack, they won’t just sit and watch their territories being taken over.” An ancient ancestor said.

“That’s precisely what Heaven and Divine Alliance want. The moment the fighting starts, they would have the right to tear the agreement apart. Windchaser and Harkrain are being used as the catalysts.” A dragon lord speculated, causing everyone to take a deep breath.
