Chapter 5787: How About Another?

“Friends, my apologies, but get ready.” Jiao Heng told Demon with a smile, looking like a child playing the role of a pilot wanting to test the power of the mech.

“Primordial rises!” Demon’s expression soured as she ordered.

They had seen the power of these machines previously. Resolute and the others created a similar one but this was on a different scale - a true grand-completion paragon artifact.

“Boom!” Demon, Calamity, Chi Ye, and the rest channeled their vitality into the primordial tree. They went as far as burning more true blood.

“Rumble!” The tree’s light and inferno rushed into the air, wanting to contest against the might of three thousand worlds by creating a primordial barrier. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Despite its majestic primordial forces and chaos true energy, it still looked insufficient against the might of three thousand worlds.

“Here we go!” Jiao Heng laughed and controlled the mech for a dual-hand smash. Its arms wielded the power of the three thousand worlds, breaking the thick barrier in the blink of an eye and aiming for the tree.

Countless dao laws emanated from the tree to form a supreme chapter - another layer of defense.

“Bam!” This exploded before the onslaught of the mech. It had enough force to obliterate the immortal continent and reduce any single emperor to blood.

“Crack!” The extraordinary attack left cracks in the primordial tree.

“Interesting, how about another?” Jiao Heng couldn’t help but laugh, clearly excited.

The mech raised both hands again, causing the stars above to shake. Those merely brushed by the hands immediately crumbled.

“An eternity cannot change the primordial!” Demon roared; she and her allies showed no sign of yielding despite feeling their internal energy churning chaotically.

They burned more true blood, causing an explosion of red radiance to sweep across the expanse. It coiled around the primordial tree in the shape of a red true dragon.

The tree grew larger and radiant, just a single branch extended across the celestial river.

Jiao Heng roared and focused the power of three thousand worlds into a single point.

“Crack!” The colossal tree empowered by the red dragon couldn’t withstand the impact and crumbled to pieces.

The explosion blasted the imperial-level characters flying, leaving them with grievous injuries. The tree absorbed the majority of the blow, allowing them to survive.

“One more time!” Jiao Heng looked like a child excited with this newfound toy capable of immense destruction. He commanded for another similar smash - not adding additional power.

“Boom!” Nevertheless, space and time were reduced to their original state.

Demon and her allies watched in horror, unable to sing the ode again to create another primordial tree. Plus, they knew that this was futile and could only lament the inevitable demise. The scene of their remnant corpses flashed in their mind.

“Not yet!” World Emperor stopped fighting Profound and appeared before the group.

“Moon Embrace Aegis!” He roared, raising his shield to create an ultimate barrier.

“Bam!” The full activation of his immortal armament endured the monstrous smash, successfully saving Demon’s group.
