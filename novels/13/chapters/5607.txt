Chapter 5608: What Is He Planning?

“The Dao won’t agree.” The person shook his head.0

“Isn’t this the long-awaited opportunity? Crimson Emperor is dead, the Qian is destroyed, those who shouldn’t exist returned to smoke and ashes, new shoots will sprout from scorched earth.” Li Qiye said.2

“Could this lead to our downfall?” The person asked.0

“Firstly, certain things are simply out of our control, and secondly, we can’t plan for every possible contingency, that’s not a sustainable long-term plan.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.0

“Right.” The person agreed since this logic applied to their current situation.0

“Without implicit understanding and agreement, disasters may always occur. It’s hard to say who is the mantis and who is the cicada, not to mention the oriole.” Li Qiye said.1

“Who is the oriole?” The person asked.0

“Everyone thinks they’re the oriole.” Li Qiye smiled: “That includes me as well, I believe I am the oriole when in reality, I’m the cicada.”2

“Sir, if you’re the cicada, then our issue is so easily solved.” The person said.2

“Depends on the perspective. I suppose I can be the cicada, but the question is, who can eat me? That requires more research.” Li Qiye said.0

“Wise hunters often present themselves as prey.” The person said.0

“That’s an interesting remark. Maybe everyone in this game is trying to feign weakness.” Li Qiye said.1

“There’s one exception, Twilight Hunter.” The person shook their head.8

“A prey that doesn’t appear is still, nonetheless, a prey, unless it turns out to be a silent and concealed hunter.” Li Qiye said.0

“How can we lure out this careful hunter? Twilight Hunter is the hardest one.” The person said.0

“As long as there is greed in the heart, it will eventually appear. Otherwise, it means that the bait isn’t tempting enough. The pros have to outweigh the risks, then, even the most disciplined hunter will give in.” Li Qiye concluded.0

“Sir, your existence makes this hard.” The person said.0

“Well, things will change when the entire world becomes a hunting ground. The rules will be rewritten.” Li Qiye smiled.0

“And you think you will be the hunter of this endless hunting ground, Sir?” The person said.0

“I certainly hope so but only time will tell. There are baits everywhere, just waiting for people to bite.” Li Qiye said.0

“So our job is to ignite the sparks.” The person mused.0

“Yes, just ignite the sparks, I’ll be the one doing the burning. When the flames are raging and wild, some will no longer be able to sit idly.” Li Qiye said.5

“And we shall start with Celestial Court.” The person said.0

“Depends on who loses patience first.” Li Qiye said.0

“It has to be The Bloodline first.” The person said.0

“We need to stir up The Dao as well since they are allied now. They understand that if one side is in trouble, the other side will be affected as well. There are no healthy eggs under a collapsed nest.” Li Qiye said.7

“What if they don’t yield?” The person pondered.0

“Then they will have to stop me or Celestial Court will fall. But how can they stop me?” Li Qiye said.0

“The answer is right before us.” The person paused for a bit before answering.1𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“That’s why we need to put in a bit more effort. The spark has to be ignited in the right place for maximum effect.” Li Qiye said.0

“A bit challenging.” The person shook their head.0

“I agree, but they know the logic of seizing an opportunity when it arrives. They want to turn the tides because being trapped in my epoch is uncomfortable.” Li Qiye said.0

“Let’s give it a try.” The person nodded and said: “We should be able to take them all down with this move.”0

“I hope so.” Li Qiye said: “It’s looking rather likely for Voracious Leviathan. Epoch’s End should be possible as well.”0

“I agree regarding the leviathan.” The person said.0

“Promises and deals are being exchanged in the background. The Dao won’t let The Bloodline seize the initiative.” Li Qiye said.2

“If that’s the case, The Bloodline will want Epoch’s End.” The person speculated.0

“Epoch’s End won’t be able to resist under the perfect circumstances. This has been something he wanted to do for a long time now, he wants a piece of the action.” Li Qiye said.4

“We’re left with Twilight Hunter, even they can’t make contact with this being.” The person said.1

“Twilight Hunter is superior to these two because of his cautiousness and picky appetite.” Li Qiye nodded.0

“I’m sure you seem delicious to any of them, Sir.” The person said.0

“I hope he wants to eat me because as long as he harbors this intention, it’ll be easy. Moreover, once it starts, no one can stop it, not even Twilight Hunter. He’ll be completely exposed.” Li Qiye chuckled.0

“He prefers a single strike for success.” The person said.0

“Yes, he’s not one to scavenge the trash bins, only wanting the best of meals.” Li Qiye said.0

“Do you have a bait in mind?” The person asked.0

“I can use myself as bait pretty easily for the others due to their greed and confidence. Twilight Hunter will only move when he feels completely safe and his one move will end with success.” Li Qiye said.0

“Sounds impossible.” The person shook their head.0

“We must make it possible.” Li Qiye said: “If it is not safe, it’s not delicious. The biggest fish will usually come to the bait last. As long as we have enough time, there’s no fish we can’t catch.”0

“Then I’ll proceed as planned.” The person nodded.0

“Yes, as long as they bite, there is no escaping.” Li Qiye nodded.0

“I will be sure not to startle them.” The person said.0

“It’s not a big deal if they’re startled. If startling them makes them move, their location will be exposed. We just need to get the coordinates and everything else will be smooth.” Li Qiye smiled.1

“I wish for your success, Sir.” The person bowed.1

Li Qiye returned the gesture and said: “It is due to everyone’s contribution, I am well aware of the prices you all have paid to make this possible.”10

“I dare not say whether it will be considered a contribution. Perhaps we’ll be scorned for eras to come.” The person smiled bitterly.0

“Don’t worry, everything will end with us, we won’t let this linger any longer for our descendants to suffer.” Li Qiye patted his shoulder.1

The person let out a sigh after hearing this before adding: “There’s another thing, Jiao Heng in Celestial Court is a worrying presence.”15

“Jiao Heng has his plans.” Li Qiye chuckled.0

“I don’t know what he is planning, I believe he won’t team up with either branch.” The person said.0

“Let him be, there will be a time when everything becomes clear.” Li Qiye didn’t seem to be concerned with this issue.
