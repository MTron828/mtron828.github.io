Chapter 4250: Unending Rain Of Gratitude

The fist and sword technique were magnificent and revealed the possibilities of the dao, successfully bedazzling spectators.

However, Li Qiye’s slash paused the grand dao and allowed spectators to take a meticulous look.

Unfortunately, this experience was ephemeral and time began flowing again.

“Boom!” The wondrous scene exploded like fireworks then disappeared from sight. Once people regained their vision, they saw Li Qiye standing still while the duo staggered one step backward.

Though the exchange was over, it left an impressionable aftertaste in everyone’s mind.

“Magnificent!” The venerable couldn't help shouting, looking rather happy: “Myriad Era didn’t let me down after the long wait!”

“It does live up to its fame.” Earthraiser praised.

The crowd wholeheartedly agreed with the overlords’ assessment. After all, who was more qualified than them to make these comments?

“Li Qiye really cultivated Finality.” A genius brought this up.

A while ago, everyone thought that Peace Ocean Sword King was a genius for learning both Abyss and Vastsea.

Now, there was a chance of Li Qiye being able to use all nine. Peace Ocean wouldn’t be worth mentioning if this was the case.

“He’s far stronger than the highest evaluation. Did he purposely hide his skills?” A big shot took a careful look at Li Qiye.

Alas, her heavenly gaze revealed that his cultivation was subpar. Nonetheless, he still kept up with two overlords and actually had the upper hand. No one could make head or tail out of this.

“So this is the power of all nine sword dao together?” An ancient ancestor said, thinking that this was the thing allowing Li Qiye to be in this fight.

The invincible heavenly scripture gave him the means to contest against two overlords.

“Let’s try again!” The venerable shouted.

“I was thinking the same thing!” The vajra’s battle spirit surged.

They lost their confidence in the heavenly techniques because Li Qiye somehow nullified everything. But now, using their own made them feel much better and raised their morale despite Li Qiye’s successful stop.

“Don’t be so confident, the next move will draw blood.” Li Qiye smiled.

The crowd took a deep breath. Few could say this to the duo but they believed that Li Qiye could do so effortlessly. This realization scared the hell out of them.

The duo exchanged glances. Only two choices awaited them - to stop here or to fight to the death.

“I’ve embarked on many battlefields before and am no stranger to blood.” The venerable spoke with great momentum.

“Let us see whose blood will spill.” The gigantic vajra asserted.

“As you wish.” Li Qiye chuckled and slowly raised his sword, creating myriad eras in the process.

Strings of light circled around him, creating a phenomenon of him standing in the river of time. The sword was capable of affecting temporal flows. One flow could be ten thousand years, or even upward of millions.

Thus, people still became frightened despite a lack of oppressive aura. Each string and its temporal affinity contained immense power.

No one could escape the grasp of time. Thus, being slashed by this sword meant bad news. After millions of years, not to mention a cultivator, even top treasures would turn to scrap.

“Unending Rain of Gratitude!” The venerable used a similar style of attack again, painting a beautiful scene.

Spectators became immersed in an illusion seen in the rain - the best moment of their life. They became distracted and would become victims of the sword. Strangely enough, they would also feel gratitude towards this attack for bringing them back to a better time.

They felt a sharp pain in their heart. Defenses and techniques were useless against this attack because everyone had emotions.

The moment they felt something - especially debt to the attack - the sword would pierce their heart right away. Some thought that dying was absolutely worth it as they recalled the glorious past.

“Spirit Tyrant!” As for the vajra, his faint aura became resplendent after a loud explosion. He unleashed a punch capable of crushing all things.

Just the shock waves alone could reduce anyone to blood. This stood in contrast with the venerable’s sword. One attacked the mind while the other consisted of brute force.

“Chrono Thrust.” Li Qiye slowly moved his dominant hand forward. However, the blade itself wasn’t the thing being pushed but rather, time itself.

“Buzz…” The flow of time corroded both the illusory sword rain and the ferocious fist energy. The rain dried up and the energy waves turned into smoke. Both were unable to withstand the flow of time.

“Activate!” The duo used their vitality to pour energy into their techniques, wanting to reach their peak state.

They tried to empower their technique again to weather the temporal storm. Alas, this proved to be futile.
