Li Qiye’s successful attempt shocked the entire crowd.

“Fiercest, he should change his title to number one expert from now on.” One ancestor praised.

At this moment, everyone realized just how much stronger he was compared to Dracoform Martial God. He was the only one qualified to have this title in Myriad.

“What sorcery is this?!” Mu Shaochen was shocked just like the rest. He was hoping for the devil to consume all of Vermillion because it wasn’t strong enough right now.

It could certainly sweep through the current Myriad but not Imperial. Only by returning to the peak would it be unstoppable there too. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Now, Li Qiye had destroyed his hope. He would never accept this.

“No such sorcery exists in this world, fool.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Great talents but no knowledge? No different from an idiot.”

“You!” Shaochen turned red but couldn’t do anything outside of angrily glaring at Li Qiye.

“Ra!” The heart devil screamed with indignation. It tried its best to absorb but Vermillion remained standing, completely sealed.

Li Qiye started floating up above the airspace of the heart devil and pointed with his truncheon: “Time to end this.”

“Boom!” The creature screamed again and lost its figure, turning into a dark expanse that soars straight for Li Qiye.

It had turned into a world of darkness, deciding to assault Li Qiye with this affinity.

The crowd was astonished because Li Qiye disappeared into this darkness, devoid of light. No one could ever run from this eternal darkness.

The creature chose against using techniques, even ones as strong as the twelve variations. It chose darkness to take him down.

This affinity pervaded the entire area in an omnipresent manner. It would last for one generation after another, one reincarnation cycle and the next. It had sealed him completely, not allowing for an escape path.

Despite only being a mental weakness, this devil still came from Martial Ancestor. It knew the existence it was facing so it chose the best retaliation method.

The twelve variations would have been useless, but using darkness to infiltrate the guy’s dao heart might be possible. After all, even the strongest would have openings in their dao heart. A successful infiltration would allow it to take root in his dao heart.

At that point, not only would victory be in its grasp, it could also grow stronger using Li Qiye’s dao heart.

“Darkness into the heart.” Dracoform realized the creature’s intention and knew just how dangerous this was.

The devil could grow so much stronger, causing Dracoform to shudder. Not only would Vermillion go down, but the rest of Myriad also wouldn’t fare any better.

“Will Fiercest be able to protect his dao heart?” The crowd palpitated.

For many people, they could normally fight against a stronger opponent but defending the dao heart was much more difficult.

“Hahaha, you’re done, Li, you will only be a puppet to the darkness, you alone won’t be able to protect your dao heart!” Mu Shaochen let out a burst of crazed laughter.

In his eyes, someone as arrogant and prideful as Li Qiye wouldn’t have a strong mental fortitude.

“I’m sorry to disappoint you, but no one has a firmer dao heart than me.” Li Qiye’s leisure voice came from the darkness.

“Buzz.” Rays of light spread from his dao heart, piercing through the darkness. Li Qiye stood in the center, completely unaffected to the astonishment of the crowd.

Ancestors began taking a deep breath. One of them said: “Such an unyielding dao heart.”

Few could reach this level, not just in Myriad but all of Three Immortals.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye raised the truncheon.

“Boom!” It exuded the brightest radiance. One could hear the roar of tigers, phoenixes, and dragons. Visual phenomena of these beasts soaring around in the air appeared.

These massive divine creatures fused together to form an ancient totem.

“Myriad-form Totem!” Dracoform shouted. He had only heard of this move, never having seen it before since no one could use it outside of their progenitor.

Rumor has it that this was the legendary combination of all the laws within the twelve variations, the final evolution into a supreme totem.

The totem came down in an untouchable and resolute manner. The darkness was smashed back to its original form and fell down from the sky.

“Buzz.” The totem was also burning this black expanse.

“No!” The devil roared furiously. This was its first word.

“It’s refinement time!” Li Qiye shouted.

The totem released even more light, akin to oil burning on a lake amidst the night. However, this wasn’t just a scorching process. The darkness was being refined into worldly essences - back to its original form. This was the energy that the creature had devoured earlier from Vermillion.

The crowd couldn’t believe it. A great existence like this heart devil couldn’t resist at all and was being refined alive. Li Qiye’s totem completely overwhelmed it.

This thing easily defeated Dracoform earlier but it seemed so helpless before Li Qiye. One could easily imagine how mighty he was after seeing this.

“Pop!” Finally, all the darkness was refined. An endless amount of worldly essences surged to the sky like a tsunami.

“Boom!” The truncheon empowered by the totem pierced through the entire ocean of energy and started falling down.

“It is time for the catalyst.” Li Qiye shouted.

“I’m going!” Dracoform leaped into the sky with his chest arched forward straight for the descending truncheon.

He closed his eyes and was at peace with himself, knowing what was about to happen and had zero regrets.

He created this disaster so he needed to give his system an appropriate answer, wanting to heal the wounds of the land. Sacrificing himself for the system was the only thing he could do to forgive himself. Otherwise, he would live in a shadow, always stricken with guilt.

“Pluff!” The truncheon instantly pierced through his chest completely. It carried the worldly energy of millions of miles so its destructive power was as clear as day.
