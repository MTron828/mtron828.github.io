Chapter 3811: Trinity Sword Art

Dugu Lan’s current power pleasantly surprised the members of the holy ground.

They thought that she had no chance of winning in the past. Just putting up a good fight would have been more than enough. Now, she could actually beat him in a direct battle after revealing her twelve palaces.

“You can do it, First Sister!” Students from Duality cheered loudly while being overwhelmed with excitement.

Some even jumped up and down, wanting to tell the world about their amazing first sister.

“Twelve palaces... how impressive. We’ll always be surpassed eventually.” One ancestor became sentimental.

“She might not be equal to the scion right now but her potential is bright.” Another big shot commented.

She already had twelve palaces at her age. Once her grand dao is fortified, her height would be incredible. There was a chance for her to compete for the dao lord position.

“When I got here, I thought that you were at the peak of the sacred physique realm at best, it seems like I have underestimated you.” The scion said.

“You’re too kind. I’ve only broken through recently, my grand dao is still unstable while you have been an heir for a long time now.” Dugu Lan replied, not finding pride in her achievement.

Nonetheless, the crowd still thought that it was very impressive. She was definitely among the top of her generation now. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Only the scion can match up with her.” Another genius said with admiration.

“This is perfect, I can finally go all out.” The scion glowed with vigor and excitement, especially his pulsing eyes. His battle spirit surged after finding a capable foe.

“Rumble!” He released his vitality and twelve palaces as well. His true fate was in the center, looking as imposing as can be.

Chaos energy engulfed the area. He resembled an unbeatable king in charge of all things; all others must heed his commands.

It became apparent that he was above Dugu Lan in terms of raw power and cultivation. Thus, her claim made perfect sense.

One was an heir for a long time while the other had only broken through in the last several days.

Dugu Lan had a serious expression, not daring to underestimate her opponent.

“Clank!” She slowly unsheathed her sword. As the blade grind against the scabbard, everyone felt as if time was slowing down.

It lacked a blinding radiance and a sharp murderous intent. People saw the material of the sword. It looked like wood, stone, and metal yet was neither of these three.

The unknown material consisted of two colors - one side was black and the other white. The degree of intensity also changed from the bottom to the top for both colors.

The spectators felt as if she had the yin and yang firmly under her grasp.

Righteous Scion was obviously stronger but the moment this sword came out, the tides seemed to be turned. She became the ruler of the cosmos instead - the ultimate existence. This feeling was due to the sword alone.

The rather conspicuous sword startled the crowd. The only unique characteristic was its duo-chromatic appearance, yet it felt invincible.

“A paragon of swords.” The scion had a serious expression.

As the successor of Righteous, he has seen plenty of weapons before. His sect also had three dao lords so he certainly saw dao lord weapons as well. Nonetheless, he still praised this sword. This was an indication of its unequaled nature.

“Its name is Trinity.” Dugu Lan revealed.

“Trinity?” Some found this astonishing because in terms of auras, it was even above the scion’s spear.

However, the spear’s name was grand - Heavenseize. This made Trinity seem normal in comparison.

For the smaller sects, the elementary weapons of new disciples usually had these names - Taiji Sword, Trinity Sword, Four-form Saber...

“It is to be used with Trinity Sword Art, please give me pointers.” Dugu Lan added.

“Heaven, earth, and man, I see.” The scion solemnly replied.

He didn’t have this expression when dealing with Golden Cicada Buddhist Child’s World Crossing.

“Trinity Sword Art... the one from the legends?!” An old ancestor with one foot in the grave suddenly recalled something.

“So it’s a famous art?” A junior immediately asked.

“Rumor has it that it is from the secret realm.” The ancestor replied.

“Secret realm?” The junior had no idea about this realm or the sword art. Others shared the same confusion.

The ancestor ignored them and asked Dugu Lan: “Fairy, is this sword art from the secret realm?”

“Yes. When our progenitor created the academy, a messenger from Void Zone personally came with gifts.” Dugu Lan had no intention of hiding.

The young ones didn’t think much of it but those from the previous generation became frightened.

“It’s really from Void Zone!” One big shot gasped.
