Chapter 3756: As Easy As Pie

“Young Master, since you are interested in this matter, we can’t wait to see.” Xu Cuimei seemed invested and smiled.

“Young Master, how will you break Force Devourer?” Dugu Lan asked. She wasn’t skeptical of Li Qiye’s claim but merely curious.

So far, she herself couldn’t come up with a solution. She was considerably stronger than Liu Huaishi and could defeat him. However, to use a merit law or the mysteries of the dao to defeat Force Devourer? She didn’t have anything, at least for now.

That’s why she wanted to see Li Qiye’s method. Perhaps this would be extremely helpful before the fight with Righteous Scion since he learned the same thing.

“Xiaoyue can do it.” Li Qiye said without opening his eyes.

Xiaoyue immediately understood and became spirited again. She cupped her first and said: “I’m awaiting your guidance, Young Master.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

She then turned towards Liu Huaishi and said: “Brother Liu, let us continue to decide the victor.”

“Why not? I also wish to see.” Liu Huaishi narrowed his eyes. He thought that if she acted as Li Qiye’s proxy, there was only a twenty percent chance of success at best.

In fact, he had sparred with disciples from Righteous Sect previously. Even Righteous Scion who was adept at the seven chapters couldn’t come up with a solution.

The Supreme Four Truths were immensely profound. They could only cultivate it, seeing the flaws and openings was impossible.

An outsider such as Li Qiye most likely has never seen the chapters before, let alone learning them. This might be his first time seeing Force Devourer. How could Liu Huaishi take his assertion seriously?

“Clank!” The golden whip in his hand vibrated and issued a noisy aura, looking like a golden dragon.

“Let us get started.” Liu Huaishi told Chi Xiaoyue. He was quite curious to see what magical method could break his Force Devourer.

Everyone else had a serious expression at this point, meticulously observing the development.

Chi Xiaoyue stared at Li Qiye since she was relying on him completely.

“No need to make such a big deal when it’s just child’s play, put everything away.” Li Qiye opened his eyes and ordered.

“What?” Some thought that they had misheard him.

“Is he serious? That’s basically conceding.” One youth said.

“If Miss Xiaoyue were to put her weapon away, she’ll be completely defenseless and unable to resist.” A genius added.

They saw the power of the Scarlet Moon Seal earlier along with the Blood Moon Ascension. They felt that these things kept her competitive. Otherwise, she would have lost long ago.

Thus, not using these things was akin to surrendering.

“Hmm, not using the dao lord merit law and weapon?” Experts from the last generation were puzzled. Remember, Liu Huaishi had a top-level weapon as well.

“Is this a joke? Is she going to fight bare-handed?” Another questioned Li Qiye.

Hu Ben and Phantom’s expression soured due to the lack of logic.

“Is this the right move? She could at least defend with the dao lord weapon.” Phantom said.

Liu Huaishi’s Force Devourer was devilish indeed. However, even if Chi Xiaoyue couldn’t break his defense, she could still guarantee her own safety. What Li Qiye told her to do was akin to suiciding. No one believed that her body could handle the attacks from the whip.

“Don’t play with someone’s life.” Hu Ben shouted: “This is not a game. Just one mistake and Miss Xiaoyue might die. The reputation of the holy ground will go down the drain as well!”

“That’s right, we have to take this seriously.” Others agreed with this and nodded.

“Miss Xiaoyue, do not listen to him.” An older student from Duality said: “Your life’s on the line with just one wrong move, please exercise prudence.”

“This Li guy, he’s actually toying with someone’s life.” The young ones criticized Li Qiye’s ridiculous choice.

Of course, Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye despite the rampant criticism.

Contrary to the mass, Chi Xiaoyue actually recalled her seal and Blood Moon Ascension without any hesitation. She then stopped channeling her vitality and chaos true energy.

This shocked everyone, Liu Huaishi included.

“Is this safe?” An ancestor wondered. Going defenseless against that golden whip was too much.

Not to mention Chi Xiaoyue, the ancestors here wouldn’t want to fight Liu Huaishi barehanded.

“Are you sure, Miss Xiaoyue?” Liu Huaishi himself became worried. Though she was a capable cultivator, he thought that she had zero chance under these circumstances. Only death awaited.

“Thank you, Brother, this should be fine.” She calmly answered, having full confidence in Li Qiye’s guidance unlike the others.

She virtually put her life in his hand. Just one mistake and it would end with her death.

Everyone became nervous after seeing this. Some students almost wanted to turn away, their heart hanging on a thread. The atmosphere became awfully tense.

“Sit down, seal your six senses and the grand dao.” Li Qiye casually said.

“What?!” Everyone’s mouth became agape.

“Is he crazy?!” One person shouted.
