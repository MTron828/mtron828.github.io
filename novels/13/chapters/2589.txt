The incoming ships heading for the ten main ones shocked the crowd. They were just killing their own allies.

“Boom!” These small ships gathered together and resembled a massive continent of steel carrying an unstoppable momentum.

It had great speed just like a meteor with enough force to destroy the world.

“Not good!” The generals and disciples on these ships yelled out but they could do naught but watch.

“Rumble!” The worst part was that these ships were still firing while surging for the main ones. Moreover, the firepower only increased as if they have added more ammunition. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The barrier of the great ships became unstable, on the verge of collapsing. It surely wouldn’t be able to stop the incoming fleet.

“Fire!” The ten main ships had no choice but to give this order and fired in unison.

“Boom!” The firepower of these ten ships was more than ten times stronger versus the smaller ones. Thus, the shots decimated space. The entire area shook back and forth like the end of days.

“We’re on the same side!” The troops on the smaller ships saw this and became aghast.

One small ship after another exploded. It didn’t take long before more than half of the fleet was destroyed. The soldiers there turned to ashes.

These main ships had no other choice. Collison was imminent if they didn’t do so. Not only would the barrier break down, but these smaller ships would also smash into them as well.

The only thing they could do was destroy as much as possible in order to conserve strength. Any damage to these main ships would reduce their might considerably.

“Boom!” in the end, the rest of the small ships smashed into the barrier.

“Boom!” The barrier completely crumbled, the same with the ships.

The remnants pieces flew and scattered everywhere among the sea of fire.

The only thing could be heard right now was the unceasing burning. The crowd was speechless with their eyes wide open, mouth agape.

Li Qiye patted his hands and critiqued: “So useless, can’t even make it to the main ships before becoming scrap metals.”

The smaller fleet was done for. More than one hundred has completely been destroyed. The vicinity of Mingluo was filled with debris for thousands of miles, still burning.

Just imagine the magnificent devastation - there were enough of them to cover the airspace above Mingluo.

The natives here have never seen anything so shocking before so they became frightened. In fact, even the ancestors from the great powers in Imperial felt the same way. They didn’t expect this fleet to be defeated so swiftly.

“That’s one way to declare war against Hidden Gold Grotto...” One expert exclaimed.

“Declare war? You mean wanting to fight to the death. Those guardian warships were one-third of Hidden Gold Grotto’s fighting force and now they’re gone. It’s not just a slap, this is an irreconcilable feud.” One ancestor said with a serious expression.

“Right, it’ll be a feud to the death.” The experts in Imperial realized that mediation wasn’t possible.

This was still a great loss for the prosperous sect. It would be a miracle if they were to drop this issue.

“Who is he? Why is he so merciless and domineering? He’s pretty similar to Jade-break True Emperor.” One expert recalled.

“Jade-break True Emperor wasn’t this cruel either. The emperor was murderous and prone to committing massacres but still didn’t have such a hot temperament, fighting so quickly after one disagreement.” Another one stated.

“Jade-break True Emperor was really something back then, breaking into the Mu Clan and made that clan howl with anguish and agony, pushing towards the verge of destruction. In the end, they made many concessions or the emperor would have kept going.” One knowledgeable ancestor said: “So we have another one just like the emperor right now. It’s amazing how the next generation will always improve. Old men like us will need to retire eventually. Now that I think about it, the title Fiercest is actually very fitting.”

Others glanced at each other. Defeating a fleet in one breath? That’s more than domineering enough. Someone like him was perfect for the word Fiercest.

“How strange, how come I’ve never heard of this Li Qiye before? It’s as if he appeared out of nowhere, maybe he’s from a big clan?” Someone murmured.

Everyone became curious about his background. How could such a powerful being be unknown before?

Keep in mind that in Imperial, the capable youths are very powerful, such as Jade-break or Puresword True Emperor. Even the masters from the previous generation felt suffocated by these two and became overshadowed.

“Maybe he’s from the lower world.” An ancient ancestor spoke with a solemn expression.

“Lower world? You mean Myriad?” A response came with wide eyes and disbelief: “How could Myriad have such a powerful man? So young too.”

“Nothing is impossible. It’s not like all of Myriad are weak; numerous masters have come from there. Some were enough to be remembered for the ages, even surpassing those from Imperial.” The ancient ancestor said.

“There should have been some commotion if he came from Myriad, right? People should have noticed.” A clan member said.

“Not necessarily, older lineages down there have secret passageways. After all, many of them were originally from our world or even Immortal. They still have some resources left.” The ancestor replied.

“Maybe, or maybe he’s just a secretly groomed genius from a system in our world. There are plenty of hidden dragons and crouching tigers here.” Someone didn’t want to accept that a being from Myriad could be stronger than their own.

This wasn’t surprising at all. Imperial has always been proud - referring to Myriad as a lower world. They considered the people there as inferior.

“It doesn’t matter since this is still going to be a big deal. Hidden Gold will go all out to destroy him, or they’ll lose all face.” Another jumped in.

“Yes, they have been wanting to be among the top three and doing a great job at it. However, being trampled by someone now will kill their dreams, so they have no choice but to deal with Li Qiye. They want everyone in Imperial to know that their position is unshakable and that no one can challenge them since they possess enough power to be a behemoth.” An expert analyzed Hidden Gold’s intent.

Many nodded in agreement after hearing this.
