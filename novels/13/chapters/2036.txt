“Immortal Emperor Fei should be proud to have a son like you.” Li Qiye smiled: “So many tigers give birth to dogs, but you have never shamed his prestige before.”

So it turned out that the old man ahead was the son of Immortal Emperor Fei and the prettiest diviner in that generation. He was the unknown guardian of the academy; few were aware that he was still alive.

He was the embodiment of nobility with famous parents and of course, his grandfather was Deep South Divine Emperor.

One would be hard pressed to find someone with a more prestigious background. With such a family, he could easily call for winds and rains.

So many imperial princes would become bossy and unbridled, not giving a damn about the rest of the world.

This wasn’t the case for the prince. Diligence and sincerity described him perfectly despite his incredible innate talents. Furthermore, as a half-diviner, he was lucky enough to have one of the three great immortal bloods - Eternal! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

All of this gave him an unbelievable advantage; he was certainly destined for greatness.

Alas, he had a peerless father and an unbeatable grandfather so his life paled in comparison.

This wasn’t to say that he didn’t work hard enough or wasn’t powerful. In fact, the guy was exceedingly strong and could look down on many emperors. The problem was that his family was too excellent.

His father was among the greatest Immortal Emperors while his grandfather used to be the leader of the Divine Race. There was no way for him to exceed the two of them despite his lifelong effort and hard work.

There was no way of escaping from their shadow so his own light was dimmed. The truth was that even if he had twelve wills, it still wasn’t enough to overcome the other two.

Nevertheless, he still tried his best in life. This was the reason why Li Qiye viewed him in high regard.

“You’ve done enough, not becoming a prodigal son with such an invincible father and grandfather. Anyone else would go crazy under the weight of those two mountains.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

This statement was quite reasonable since even his mother was exceptional. He had done a good job reaching this point.

“It’s fate.” The prince smiled: “Who is to blame for me being born in that family? All I could do was try my best.”

In the eyes of many, his background was enviable even to the point of jealousy. However, it was also torturous for someone who had dreams and aspirations because a lifetime of effort was not enough to surpass their older generations.

Their achievements and excellence would not matter. Some would even think that it was all due to the protection and reputation of the family. No one would recognize their hard work or talents.

Nevertheless, despite not being able to fulfill his dream and living in others’ shadow, he continued to quietly protect the academy because this was the hard-earned accomplishment of his father.

“It wasn’t easy for you.” Li Qiye nodded. This particular prince was much stronger than the other imperial princes. It was too bad that the people from his generation didn’t feel that he was exceptional at all.

“Since my parents aren’t around, I need to do my part for the academy. Not just my family, but many wise sages from the hundred race have toiled for its sake so I can’t let it fall no matter what. It’s just that I don’t know how much longer I can last... Alas, once we get through this problem, the future will be even brighter.” The prince said.

Li Qiye agreed: “Right, the academy is the embodiment and culmination of labor from many, but this is also precisely why others consider it to be a fat prey. The moment it falls down, so many would pounce forward for a bite.”

The prince sighed; greed was part of human nature. He looked at Li Qiye and smiled: “However, I have nothing to worry about with you here in this generation. The waves can be even taller but the academy will be just fine.”

“I came with no purpose, only to hang around in Study Room and find some mysteries. This is more of a coincidence.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m even more at ease knowing that you’re there.” The prince smiled: “No need to send anyone to protect that place then. No one can go take that item now.”

“Even without me there, the High Heaven Scroll is not obtainable anyway. It has been there for so many years now. Hmm, right now, only three people could probably take it away.” Li Qiye replied.

“We have to plan for everything, who to say that a twelve-will emperor won’t get involved once the academy is in trouble.” The prince smiled wryly.

“That’s true, that scroll is too tempting. It is not only the most complete High Heaven Scroll in the world but also the strongest one.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Strongest might be too much.” The prince responded.

“Well, top three in history, at least.” Li Qiye commented.

So it turned out that Study Room was hiding an incredible treasure named High Heaven Palace. Of course, others didn’t know about it and they had no way of researching this particular item.

Few truly understood this place - one was Immortal Emperor Fei, another was Deep South Emperor, and the Dark Crow was the third.

Not too many treasures in this world could tempt a twelve-will emperor, but this was certainly one of them.

“I wonder if it’s a blessing or disaster to have something like that here.” The prince spoke softly.

“Who knows?” Li Qiye smiled: “But with this item, the academy will have unlimited potential. After all, if you want to look up and find what’s above, what can be more suited for this purpose than the palace?”

“That makes sense.” The prince said: “When Father left for the expedition, he left the palace behind and said that if the academy can hold on to it, then there will still be hope and unlimited potential for our world.”

“Leave it here.” Li Qiye said slowly: “Hope is within, of course, if there are apex existences looking for it, then it’s not a bad thing either. Let them show themselves.”

“After surviving this disaster, a long period of peace will come.” The prince nodded.

“It will be very exciting. Who will be on the academy’s side and who wants to make prey out of it? Time will tell.” Li Qiye smirked.

The prince showed some hesitation after this and finally looked up at Li Qiye: “Sir, there’s something I’ve been wanting to ask you.”

Li Qiye nodded: “I know, you want to ask about the expedition.”

“I’ve never wanted to ask about this because I’m not prepared to hear the answer.” The prince sighed: “But I’m old now and death can come knocking at any moment. I’m certain that it is time to know. Sir, you are the only person I know to have come back alive, so I want to ask, is there hope for them to come back?”

The question wasn’t whimsical for him since he wanted to ask a very long time ago. Alas, he was afraid of hearing the wrong answer.

“Perhaps this will be my last time seeing you since you’ll be embarking on this path in the future. If I don’t ask you now, there might not be another chance later.” A weight seemed to be lifted off his shoulder.
