Chapter 4071: Open

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“Buzz.” The thousands of lights combined and resulted in the phenomenon of a photon exploding.

This destructive phenomenon was contained by the rays. Nevertheless, ripples and waves appeared in the cellar.

An entirely new world seemed to be emerging in the center. Smaller rays of light manifested, looking like spirits playing and dancing around.

This process was ephemeral but still magnificent. Runes also materialized in this world and came together to form laws. The strands of laws were then assembled into characters describing a supreme grand dao.

“Pop!” The final culmination was a sphere of light. All the other rays disappeared afterward. The refined jades were drained of their chaos energy as well. The jades lost their luster and became worthless rocks.

Spectators would gasp audibly after seeing this. Ten thousand Dao Lord Refined Jades could support a sect for an entire generation or a great formation for a long period. However, they were spent in the blink of an eye in this cellar. Few sects could afford to spend so much.

The light sphere flashed brightly and brimmed with spirit energy. There was enough to gestate three thousand worlds.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The strands of laws within the sphere flew around like true dragons. Ning Zhu thought that if one were to smash this sphere down on the ground, all of Eight Desolaces would be reduced to ashes. Even the top masters would die without a grave.

“What is this thing?” She was both amazed and horrified by its power.

“A key to open the secret.” Li Qiye smiled and reached forward.

“Buzz.” His hand became resplendent with an oscillating dao light.

Once he got closer to the sphere, a pressure suddenly weighed down in the cellar. This weight was immeasurable; Ning Zhu felt as if the entire continent was sinking.

However, the light in Li Qiye’s hand managed to prop up the weight of the sphere and began infiltrating. This process resembled snow melting into the earth.

His hand eventually reached the core of the sphere. “Boom!” Thus, he was immediately viewed as an invader.

The living beings in the sphere looked up and saw a gigantic palm reaching for their world. In reality, this wasn’t far from the case.

The laws from his hand began permeating throughout the sphere, prompting retaliation. The light of the sphere became blindingly bright and pulsed uncontrollably.

Ning Zhu was scared out of her mind, thinking that the sphere was about to explode. This would instantly wipe out all lifeforms on Eight Desolaces.

Fortunately, Li Qiye tightened his grip and captured all of the sphere’s dao laws. They struggled but couldn’t get free. His own light pulsed and initiated a refinement process.

The chaotic light of the sphere gradually shrank. Its light and laws fused with his palm, seemingly wanting to imprint themselves.

“Buzz.” Finally, everything entered his palm and disappeared from sight.

“What did you gain?” She asked.

“When you wield the earth’s loop, you’ll also wield the world’s power.” He smiled.

“Earth’s loop? I’ve never heard of this before.” She said.

“It’s nothing, just an ace card left behind by someone.” He elaborated then raised his bright hand.

“Rumble!” Violent earthquakes ensued and the world started spinning.

The startled princess felt something digging up from the ground. She immediately left the cellar to take a look.

Sure enough, towers made out of golden stones drilled out of the ground. They were covered in mysterious runes as well.

If the lines and the fortresses resembled a mesh, then the towers would be in the center of each section.

The servants and Ning Zhu couldn’t believe it while watching the rising towers.

“What are they?” She asked.

“Good stuff, of course.” Li Qiye smiled and used the earth’s loop again.

The fortresses sent out rays through the embedded lines into the towers. All of this power eventually gathered at the top of the towers.

“Rumble!” Beams of light then shot upward and illuminated all of Armament Mountain.

“I see…” Ning Zhu started seeing a few clues.

The fortresses served as grand dao sources capable of empowerment. The lines were used to channel this power into the top of the towers. As for the earth’s loop, it was the tool to control the entire plain.

Nonetheless, she didn’t know the reason why the plain was set up in this manner.
