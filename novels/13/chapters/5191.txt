Chapter 5192: It’s Obvious

Li Qiye landed and the group still hasn’t regained their wits, unable to fathom Li Qiye’s perfect mastery over Resplendent Array.

Just having strength alone was not enough. Otherwise, the conquerors trapped inside would have been able to take over.

In this case, how did an outsider with no access to the essential merit laws be able to control the array?

The result was a power countless times stronger than Resplendent Monarch’s version. He thought that Li Qiye might do a better job than his own progenitor. He wasn’t sure of this because he had never seen Peerless Monarch in action.

“Geezer, the young noble is way better than you at using the array.” Gourdkeeper commented.

“If I could do it like him, Suppression wouldn’t have been able to break out.” Resplendent smiled wryly, still overwhelmed with emotion.

“Young Noble, how did you do it?” He then asked Li Qiye.

“First time trying.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Your Peerless Monarch was wise indeed but this array wasn’t created by her alone. Other Immortal Emperors must have helped. Alas, the nine worlds are too profound and she lacked resources, unable to wield the true momentum.”

Resplendent Monarch had no response. He pondered in silence, agreeing with Li Qiye’s assessment of the treasure’s complexity.

One of the most important reasons for his failure was that he and the others knew nothing about the nine worlds. Therefore, the previous users couldn’t muster its true power.

According to Li Qiye, it seemed that this array was still not perfected. If it could fully duplicate the power of this ancient world, would it be able to trap the strongest conquerors?

“How do you know this, Young Noble?” Resplendent asked and was curious about the emperors’ involvement.

“It’s obvious after one glance.” Li Qiye stared at the horizon and said, capable of deducing the flaws of the array in no time at all.

This prompted Resplendent Monarch to undergo a silent reflection due to the blow dealt to this ego.

He was only one level below those considered as supreme geniuses during his youth. Once he became a dragon lord, he spent all of his time learning the array.

After obtaining five fruits, he was finally able to control it. His mastery only improved with his cultivation. This process took tens of thousands of years.

Now, he felt as if he was an idiot when comparing himself to this man.

“Haha, geezer, I found the right person. Now I don’t owe you anything.” Gourdkeeper elbowed him and winked.

“You want to implant the Tree of Tranquility into this array.” Li Qiye told Resplendent Monarch.

The latter smiled wryly and responded: “I thought I’d done a good job at understanding the array. The problem is that when I fought Suppression, he could see through the flaws and openings.”

“The momentum is incomplete due to the flaws.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m sure when our progenitor uses it, the flaws will become virtually indetectable. My cultivation isn’t enough to hide them.” He sighed and said.

“It is not your fault.” Gourdkeeper shook his head: “We know how strong Suppression is, you were the one who lasted the longest.”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“He is even stronger now.” Resplendent said worriedly.

“Indeed, he has eleven dao fruits now. It’ll be impossible soon for us to take back authority.” Gourdkeeper said.

They have been mentioning Suppression Conqueror of Hundred Dao. He was rumored to be the descendant of Sindragon Dao Lord.

Because of this, he was rejected by several mighty lineages including Cleansing Incense Dynasty, Shi Gate, and Alchemy Dao.

Finally, he was accepted by Hundred Dao. This was a rather wise choice since the youth eventually became a conqueror with a limitless future.

“I hope that by transplanting the tree into the array, it will close some of the gaps. At the very least, it will increase my own power while inside. The problem is that the tree doesn’t want to stay in the array.” Resplendent elaborated.

“The momentum rejects the tree.” Li Qiye answered: “When your progenitor created the array, the momentum is already set and it does not allow invaders. The initial planting was fine because it didn’t affect anything. As the tree continued to grow inside, the momentum started resisting it.”

“That does make sense.” Resplendent said with admiration: “I came to Alchemy Dao to ask for help, maybe some of these old men would know how to keep the tree in there.”

“We don’t have a method. This is more than just alchemy since it requires working together with the array’s overarching momentum. We want to help but are powerless.” Gourdkeeper said.

“Using agricultural alchemy to keep the plant inside is useless. It will only make the flaws more obvious.” Li Qiye concluded.
