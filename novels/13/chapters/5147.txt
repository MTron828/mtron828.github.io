Chapter 5148: Beautiful Drizzle

The grand dao phenomenon concluded, fully displaying its beauty and dao profundity. It would be another ten thousand years for the next.

“Time to go, but I do have to return the gesture for the party.” Li Qiye smiled and said before reaching deeper into the celestial domain.

“Clank!” He created a supreme chapter by twisting the dao and laws in there.

“That’s good enough.” He clapped his hands clean and left with Jun Landu.

“Boom!” An immortal radiance manifested in the domain after they left. Wondrous flames rushed upward and turned into a supreme chapter containing the myriad dao of the world. They continued to transform and evolve, seeing the truth behind immortality.

“Buzz.” Spectators felt as if an immortal was on the verge of walking out from all the runes. They couldn’t avert their gaze from the new phenomenon.

Conquerors and dragon lords of the Lu became overwhelmed with emotions.

“This is…” Even their ancestor lost his cool.

These famous cultivators had created supreme dao and merit laws before. These arts remained at the top level for many eras now, containing the mysteries of the dao.

Unfortunately, after seeing the supreme chapter casually created by Li Qiye, they witnessed a potential path to immortality via returning to the origin. They stood there, completely frozen.

Jun Landu looked up at the sky and said: “This weather is perfect for tea at Night-rain Pavilion.”

“I’m about to be fat if we keep on eating.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sir, your free time is rather limited due to your quest. Who knows when you will have the time to relax and eat to your liking? You should take advantage of this.” Landu said.

“When you put it this way, it sounds like my life is pretty terrible. Very well, to Night-rain Pavilion then.” Li Qiye shook his head before staring at Landu.

“Sir, don’t give me that look, we’re only going there for a cup of ground tea because it’s really good.” Landu looked away and said.

“Okay, no hidden ulterior motives then.” Li Qiye nodded.

Landu laughed and said: “Off we go then.”

The two floated up into the air and walked toward their target.

A mountain range was faintly visible with the exception of a towering peak. Beneath was a small town with archaic buildings and pavilions. Stone steps led high up to the peak, stretching farther than the eyes can see.

Rain drizzled down on the steps and the town, accentuating the scenic beauty and their rich history.

The residents walked outside with umbrellas, taking their time climbing the wet steps. Raindrops flowed down from the edges of the umbrellas, looking like pearls.

This town’s name was Rainmountain, well known for two things - umbrellas and a type of ground tea.

The umbrellas are crafted with ingenuity with Night-rain Paper and Xianghen Bamboo. Walking up the steps while holding this umbrella could bring people back to the past, allowing them to reminisce about a better time.

The steps led to Nightrain Pavilion - the sect of Harkrain Conqueror. The tea here was unmatched; she herself had worked at the tea shop during her youth before becoming a conqueror.

Of course, it wasn’t easy for outsiders to have a taste. There was a long waiting line outside of Night-rain Pavilion.

It wasn’t only a matter of taste but since all materials related to the tea-making process were precious, it improved cultivation and comprehension as well.

Li Qiye and Jun Landu saw the waiting line consisting of cultivators from all over the world. The big shots didn’t skip the line either.

Their status didn’t matter. After all, even Harkrain Conqueror once worked here. All the current works were geniuses of the sect.

Jun Landu came over and spoke to a disciple: “We’ve come a long way, can you make an exception?”

“Everyone came a long way.” Another cultivator protested: “There’s no exception.”

“Who lives farther away than me?” One expert said: “I came from the frontier.”

“But we’re special.” Landu smiled.

Some stared at him with disdain because they didn’t recognize him.

“I’m a sect master.” An old man glared at him.

“So what? I’m a dragon lord yet here I am, waiting in line.” A stronger cultivator said.

“Damn right!” Others applauded.

A young lady from Night-rain spoke pleasantly: “Everyone, just take a number and wait for us to call. Meanwhile, feel free to take a look around the town and our mountains.”

Of course, most weren’t interested in the small town, only the tea.

“I know Harkrain Conqueror, how about it?” Jun Landu insisted.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The group burst out in laughter after hearing this while Li Qiye smirked.

“Who doesn’t know Harkrain Conqueror here?” Someone said.
