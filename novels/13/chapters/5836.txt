Chapter 5836: Unforgivable Sin

It seemed to be filled with specters. The top had a faint yellow color, seemingly made out of skin. Intricate and tiny patterns could be seen, looking unnatural and otherworldly. When they protruded, they could push the world up and vice versa.

Its ebb and flow resembled breathing as if the skin was still alive. It gave the impression that an evil creature had been flayed and its skin was being used for the drum.

Runes were carved too with crude techniques, no different from primitive people using sharp stones.

Upon closer inspection, one would find them depicting figures in a profound yet simple manner. They were somehow embedded into the drum, simply too many to count.

Derivation took out a stick made from a white-jade bone pulsing with divinity and an indomitable spirit. It most likely came from a supreme existence.

Everyone could tell that this drum was crafted from countless lives and the skin of a nefarious creature. The creation process granted the drum the power of hatred and curses.

“Brat, this is my Myriad Race Drum and you shall taste the wrath of hatred!” Derivation shouted and was proud of his weapon.

“An unforgivable sin.” Li Qiye uttered coldly.

“Unfortunately, no one can carry out justice against me!” Derivation laughed.

“Boom!” He tapped the drum with his hand and cries echoed forth.

The figures on the drum became vivid - tortured souls suffering in hell for eternity. They included towering giants, sinister spirits, saints of light...

Some giants had their bones taken, the spirits were flayed, and the saints were drowned in darkness...

Their unending torture birthed malevolence and hatred, culminating in a cataclysmic curse. The victims wanted the world to join their suffering as well.

“Boom!” The possessed emperors radiated brightly, releasing the inexhaustible power of epochs.

The overlords behind them didn’t hold back. Nevertheless, their power was limited by the shells.

“Clank!” Heavenblade’s dao talisman released primal laws. They coiled around the blade and created the most profound sword dao. This epoch dao sword could cut down an epoch and harm the high heaven, giving Sword a dignified appearance.

“Boom!” Various divine beasts appeared and roared - dragon, phoenix, gluttonous beast, kun peng... They all joined with Divine Beast as Hao Hai raised it, wielding the power of the bestial epoch.

“Bang!” Nether released three divine rings from the disk. These inborn rings could borrow the power of the high heaven and summon tribulations.

Profound’s shroud could conceal everything regardless of their size. Heaven and earth were only the size of an egg in comparison. This shroud could cover and refine everything back to the primordial chaos with the power of the Nine Heavenly Scriptures contained within the banners. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The flames in their eyes illuminated the battlefield as the overlords gathered power to kill Li Qiye.

“Die!” Derivation took the vanguard and attacked first, smashing his drum repeatedly. Just the shockwaves alone tore the world asunder and extinguished dao. His victims obeyed his command and unleashed their curses.
