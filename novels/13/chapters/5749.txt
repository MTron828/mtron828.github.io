Chapter 5750: A Friend?

Li Qiye and the cloud got out of the water. Sure enough, the celestial river they were in prior was only a reflection of the real thing.

Just the reflection alone had turned into an endless expanse. What about their current location? Could it truly be uncrossable?

In reality, they found themselves to be in a small stream. Anyone would be shocked to find out the truth - that the true form of the labyrinth that had put emperors to rest was so humble in size. Only those who have experienced it themselves would accept this reality. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The stream flowed gently and radiated starlight, casting a special and comfortable feeling on the duo.

It was far less imposing compared to the boundless expanse prior - instilling tranquility instead of anxiety and a feeling of being insignificant. Its gentle flow made the duo want to turn over and nap.

Li Qiye palmed a handful of water and gazed into it, seeming that there were galaxies within each drop. This was indicative of its true size - the reason why it was so difficult to reach the other shore.

“Secrets are hidden here.” Li Qiye told the cloud: “This is merely the entrance too, others are aware but have been guarding them.”

The cloud understood and stared at the water, sensing its unique nature.

Li Qiye closed his eyes and enjoyed the stream’s caress while activating primordial light around his legs.

The rays followed the current and became one with the stream. The rays resembled golden ink, integrating with the water.

The cloud mimicked Li Qiye’s posture and grew two legs, immersing them in the stream. They looked like cotton candy and wisps of sugary threads joined the water, flowing downstream.

The cloud closed its eyes, seemingly enjoying the process just like Li Qiye.

After an unknown length of time, Li Qiye suddenly opened his eyes. The light from them erupted thunderously and a new world was opened.

“Did you sense it?” Li Qiye asked the cloud.

The cloud opened its eyes and seemingly had a serious expression.

“Looks like a potential friend, no?” He smiled.

It contemplated for a moment before nodding.

He patted it and smiled: “Go catch it, don’t let it get away now.”

The cloud shook its head and made some noise, seemingly wanting to communicate.

“Afraid of what? This might not be your territory but what kind of existence are you? Besides, I’m right here, I’m not going to let anything happen to you.” He said.

It still shook its head despite his assurances.

“Don’t worry, it will be fine under my protection, just go in and drive it out.” He patted its head again.

It was not one to take risks, still showing hesitation.

“I see, it has nothing to do with territory or whatever, you’re just afraid of being weaker and inferior, don’t want to be utterly crushed and stomped on the ground.” He smirked.

His provocation worked beautifully on the naive cloud, leaving it infuriated with puffed-up cheeks. It glared at him, clearly displeased.

“Alright, no need to get angry.” He patted it again and said: “I was just joking, you are special and peerless throughout the ages, something like this has no chance to compete with you.”

It became happier after hearing this and enjoyed his petting like a cat would.

“I bet you will be able to force it out after three or five moves, don’t you think? It’s time to show the world your greatness.” He said.

The initially comfortable cloud regained its wits and glared at him again.

“Remember, no one has a chance against the two of us, especially that tiny thing.” He said.

It considered the situation carefully and agreed with his logic.

“We’ll force it out and if it doesn’t listen, we’ll teach it a good lesson. Wouldn’t that be fun?” He smiled while slightly squinting as if imagining the scenario.

It nodded in agreement.

“Shall we get started then? You drive it out and I’ll stay here to intercept, how about that?” He encouraged the cloud.

It was actually eager to try this time.

“Very well.” He smiled and patted it one last time before closing his eyes, still infusing his primordial light into the stream.

It copied him, relaxing and closing its eyes. Strands resembling cotton candy melted away into the water.
