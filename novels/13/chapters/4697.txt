Chapter 4698: Lightning

It seemed to have been made from lightning itself and sculpted by a dao lord’s supreme force. Within was an endless amount of this affinity. Runes occasionally pulsed and exuded the power of their great master.

Spectators became frozen after sensing its penetrating capability. It came from an ancient past with a tribulation power of the high heaven.

Tribulations were feared by all cultivators since most couldn’t withstand them. Not even the strongest master could do so.

“A patrimony weapon…” A mighty cultivator took a deep breath.

The demon big shot nodded: “Yes, Lightning from Eight-step Dragon Dao Lord.”

All listeners gasped after hearing the grade of the weapon. Patrimony weapons were rare since not all dao lords left one behind.

Eight-step Dragon Dao Lord was a mighty existence, one of the strongest in history. No one doubted the power of his spear.

“Use the spear, see if you can pierce me.” Tian Feng’s voice ruptured listeners’ eardrums.

This showed just how much confidence he had in his innate gift. This has been proven by his own life experiences. He faced opponents far above his station but eventually, he alone emerged triumphantly.

Though he was sent flying several times, he refused to believe that Li Qiye could take him down with his bare hands. The injuries were only external, unable to touch his dao foundation and true fate.

He decided to lend Li Qiye a patrimony weapon to make this fight more exciting. Of course, others thought that he was insane for doing so.

“You can’t find a second cultivator like this.” An expert said. No one would ever willingly hand a patrimony weapon to someone else, let alone an opponent.

“Start, let’s see if you can kill me with Lightning!” Tian Feng laughed heartily.

“What a madman.” Godwhip Princess commented.

“This is Tian Feng, he has the qualification and potential to become a dao lord. His love for fighting is commendable. In his mind, nothing is more beautiful than dying during battle.” Shen Juntian said.

Paramount Scion smiled wryly after hearing this. Few in the world could understand his crazy conduct since they feared death.

Li Qiye chuckled. He picked up the spear and took his time looking.

Spectators held their breath because Li Qiye was already mighty with his punches alone. Now, he had a patrimony weapon in his grasp. A tiger has just grown wings.

“It’s a good one.” He praised and then channeled his energy into it.

“Boom!” A tempest of dao lord aura erupted, sweeping the crowd off their feet.

“Ahh!” Some were sent flying thousands of miles away. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Crack, crackle!” Lightning bolts danced in the sky like spirits even before an attack.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” Unlucky souls were struck by them and fell to the ground, no longer moving like electrified fish.

“So strong…” Many were forced to the ground, not even daring to think about resisting.

“You actually manage to muster this much power from it? Hahaha, yes! Come, see if you can kill me!” Tian Feng shouted excitedly while lightning bolts caused his huge frame to tremble.

He showed no sign of fear but seemed to take pleasure in being struck by the bolts.

Remember, numerous cultivators were paralyzed on the ground, still twitching helplessly. Only Tian Feng’s physical constitution allowed him to enjoy it.

“He’s not just a madman, he’s a pervert too.” One spectator concluded.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye suddenly stopped and the pressure dissipated. The air became clear again, only the spear was still pulsing with lightning.

“No need for a weapon to deal with you. I do appreciate the kind intent though.” He tossed it back to Tian Feng and said.

This astounded spectators; some thought that Li Qiye was being a fool. Tian Feng’s innate gift was peerless and hard to break. A patrimony weapon was a gift from heaven itself.

The chance of winning was boosted with the spear. No one would want to give it back; Li Qiye seemed to be an exception.

“That’s a true genius for you, that mindset, how brilliant. He can become a dao lord.” A mighty big shot praised: “Dao lords are a different breed, ordinary people can’t understand them.”

The crowd appreciated both Tian Feng and Li Qiye’s choice even though it appeared unwise.

“You insist on being bare-handed?” Tian Feng became disappointed.
