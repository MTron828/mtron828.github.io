Chapter 5291: None Of Your Business

“If you have a sliver of goodwill in your heart, then the rest of the world is full of reincarnations of Buddha.” The godchild angrily said.

“Sigh, that hurts.” Li Qiye responded.

“Why are you here? State your true intention.” The godchild demanded.

“Look at the sky and find out instead of asking me.” To which Li Qiye answered.

“Hmph, don’t blot out the sky then, I’ll see through you right away.” The godchild snorted.

“The fault is yours in this case. We should talk with sincerity but the problem is your lack of memories.” Li Qiye said.

“Don’t even dream about the fusion, it will never happen.” The godchild’s expression darkened.

“The start and the end should be the same.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I am who I am, a free immortal among three thousand worlds.” The godchild said.

“Just a rootless duckweed, not free at all.” Li Qiye disagreed.

“It is none of your business. Your scheme doesn’t work on me.” The godchild sneered.

“You are inherently flawed, where is the joy in that?” Li Qiye asked.

“There is plenty, can’t you see that I’m having a blast?” The godchild said.

“I do not.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I see that you’re still guarding the world, albeit with a different method. You’re still you.”

“Enough of this, there is nothing you can do to make me agree.” The godchild stared at the sky.

“That’s alright, I’m just here to take a look anyway. Just remember that everything is negotiable, don’t be so extreme.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m being reasonable. I like the way I am now, he’s doing well too.” The godchild said.

“What about your oldest brother?” Li Qiye asked.

The godchild finally had no instant response this time.

“Let me guess, never seeing the sun or being a devil?” Li Qiye smiled.

“You were the one who did this.” The godchild uttered coldly.

“I do not deny my involvement and responsibility.” Li Qiye said and sat down closer to the godchild.

“I wasn’t the only one stubborn back then, you also agreed. Be honest now and ask yourself, whose choice was it?” Li Qiye stared at the godchild.

The latter snorted and pretended to not listen, only focusing on the sky.

“I have a general idea of what happened in the past.” Li Qiye said: “Certain things I didn’t anticipate, sure. The problem is that you have memories, unlike your second brother, yet you still let them happen.”

“Should I have done something?” The godchild said sarcastically.

“Opportunities are vanquished when you let them be.” Li Qiye said slowly.

“We have already done what we should do.” The godchild said coldly: “If there’s anything left undone, it’s your responsibility.”

“True, which is what I’m trying to do. I wish to end everything in due time, I have the ability and the perfect plan.” Li Qiye nodded and spoke with confidence, ready to back up each word.

Although the godchild disliked Li Qiye, he had no problem recognizing the guy’s abilities.

“Of course, there are loose ends that I need to take care of.” Li Qiye said.

“No need, can’t you see that I’m in a great state?” The godchild rejected it outright.

“Suffering always has a victim, it’s just that it isn’t you right now.” Li Qiye said: “If you were the one suffering, would you be singing the same tune?”

“You are not me so you do not know my intention. Perhaps I would be willing to bear the burden if it was placed on me.” The godchild said.

“Well.” Li Qiye stroked his chin: “You have a point there. I am not you so I am not privy to your thoughts.”

“Suffering is just suffering, nothing more. I can handle it if I have to.” The godchild said.

“You know that there are better solutions. Moreover, I am here now, we can go big.” Li Qiye smiled.

“From my perspective, you are potentially the source of all troubles. It would have been different without you, and perhaps for the better.” The godchild sneered.

Li Qiye chuckled before smirking at the godchild.

“What’s with that face?” The godchild got chills afterward.

Li Qiye waved his hand and said: “We both know that the alternative wouldn’t have been better. And most importantly, you are still you regardless of how hard you try. Whether you run away or forget the past, the inevitable will happen. Only a direct confrontation can solve our problems.”

“All I know is that I am free now.” The godchild remained unmoved.

“Think about your eldest brother, sealed for an eternity.” Li Qiye said.

The godchild’s expression froze for a moment.

“The situation might deteriorate but remember, I have the ability to give this a perfect conclusion.” Li Qiye said.

“I have no interest in becoming your work ox, so drop the idea.” The godchild said.

“It’s nothing like that. This is your pursuit, your desire, the reason for your existence. It has nothing to do with outsiders.” Li Qiye smiled.

The godchild scowled and didn’t respond again.

After a while, he said: “You taught your disciples well.”

“I know, they never disappoint and have done great.” Li Qiye said and then added: “You have a good son.”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The godchild fell into rumination but eventually glared at Li Qiye: “Get lost, I almost fell for your words!”

“You’re just being petty now, I’ve only made casual remarks that are nothing but the truth.” Li Qiye said.

“Well, you’re talking to the wrong person, I’m just a happy youth now. The matters of the world have nothing to do with me.” The godchild said.

“I know, I know, all are just passing clouds to you. That’s fine, I’m just here to chat, not to force you to do anything.” Li Qiye nodded.

The godchild naturally didn’t buy it and had a doubtful expression.
