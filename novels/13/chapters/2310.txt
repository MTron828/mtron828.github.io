“Alright, I’m ready for your slash.” Guixing shouted, feeling confident that his armor and shield would be able to block the incoming attack.

“The result is obvious.” Someone murmured.

“Just one bamboo sword can’t break an imperial armor.” Another ancestor felt the same way.

“Big mistake, Li Qiye probably didn’t expect for Elder Fan to have an imperial regalia.” A high elder shook his head in agreement.

The crowd thought that he couldn’t kill Elder Fan with a single slash or even break through the armor at all.

“Good, let’s get started.” Li Qiye slowly raised his sword without gathering any sword energy.

In fact, this had nothing to do with the sword dao. He was performing the Physique Scripture, the new version. He had opened this scripture once more so it probably needed a new name from now on.

“Boom!” The shield poured out light as Elder Fan cried out: “Shield Against The Devils!”

This shield instantly became massive, capable of separating heaven and earth. It covered him fully.

“Screech!” The firebird above closed its wings and let out a scorching flame to seal the myriad worlds, protecting the old man inside.

“Rumble!” The imperial aura erupted with blinding light.

“You are under my protection.” A grand figure lowered its palm, wishing to destroy everything.

The ground started to crack; this move possessed both offensive and defensive capabilities.

“Pluff!” Li Qiye finally unleashed his slash. It exceeded the temporal limit and reversed its flow.

No one could see the slash but they were affected and felt an illusion of becoming younger.

“Bam!” The moves collided.

When the spectators calmed down, they saw the gigantic shield still standing, the regalia was still radiant, and the majestic figure remained strong.

Guixing also stood there, seemingly unharmed.

“That’s it?” Someone wondered. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Crack.” Li Qiye’s bamboo sword had lines all over before collapsing into pieces.

“He lost.” Everyone believed that the slash failed to break the imperial defense.

“It’s still an imperial armor from a True Emperor. Such power can’t be touched even by an ordinary Ascender.” An ancestor commented, aware of the difference in power levels.

“Li Qiye was too careless, using just a bamboo sword against an imperial armor, that’s impossible. He’s slapping himself in the face now.” One cultivator gloated.

“Boom!” Suddenly, the massive shield collapsed; the majestic figure shattered; the firebird uttered a miserable cry before disintegrating.

Guixing’s armor turned into powder and scattered away with the wind. His eyes were wide open, same with his twitching mouth. He tried to say something but nothing would come out.

They finally saw blood oozing out of his throat. A tiny gash gradually became a bloody hole. The guy finally fell on the ground, causing specks of dust to go flying.

He couldn’t believe that his defensive measures have failed to a bamboo sword. In fact, everyone else shared the same astonishment.

The ones who thought Li Qiye have lost earlier felt their face becoming red and hot as if he had just slapped them.

No one would believe such an outrageous story.

“Just one slash, all about speed exceeding everything to return to the origin.” Li Qiye casually said.

This slash had jumped out of the boundary of the sword dao. This imperial armor couldn’t block it. The only way was to slow down the slash.

A while later, time finally began to flow normally in the area again.

“Rumble!” Explosions in the sky attracted the crowd’s attention. They looked up and saw the battle waging between Conqueror and Sword Sovereign.

Sword Sovereign looked unbeatable with his sword but Conqueror had countless bamboo blades. Though one by one, they were destroyed by the sovereign, more and more came out.

Who knows how many bamboo swords he actually had?

Li Qiye looked up and said: “So slow, do you need my help?”

“Crap, he wants to steal my opponent.” Conqueror was shocked.

He was distracted for just a second but this was enough for Sword Sovereign to fly away like a meteor towards the horizon. Such decisiveness and agility.

The guy was certainly afraid of being double-teamed by Li Qiye and Conqueror. Defeat would be imminent in that case so he decided to run away. Survival was the first priority.

“Sigh, he ran away so fast. Sword Sovereign, let’s play again later!” Conqueror shouted.

But the guy was already long gone. Who knows if he could hear Conqueror at all?

“You scared my opponent away. It’s not easy for me to find someone at the same level, who am I going to play with now? Big Bro, you need to buy five hundred swords to make up for this pain.” Conqueror said, feeling quite wronged.

“Not interested.” Li Qiye ignored him and told Bingning and Ximo: “Let’s go.”

“Big Bro, don’t leave! Just buy one more, I’ll take twenty off, no? Thirty then, fine, even fifty! That’s the best I can do!” Conqueror didn’t give up.

Alas, the trio also left him behind just like Sword Sovereign.

He turned his focus towards an elder from a great power: “Senior, how about it? Look at this beautiful sword, didn’t you see earlier? Young Noble Li used it to destroy an imperial regalia. With this sword, you can go wherever you want in the world.”

“Alright, just one.” This old man smiled and bought one.

“Don’t miss it, bamboo swords that can take down an imperial armor. Don’t miss it, you can’t buy them anywhere else, especially not for this cheap price.” Conqueror took advantage of Li Qiye’s display of prowess earlier.

He even guaranteed to others that his swords were this amazing. People couldn’t do anything but shake their head.

Some bought swords from him in order to build a friendship. Everyone could see that Conqueror wasn’t weaker than Sword Sovereign after the battle.

Keep in mind that the sword-and-saber duo made their debut much earlier than the three young nobles. They thought that the former would be stronger, but after today, they were certainly proven wrong.
