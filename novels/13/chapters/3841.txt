Chapter 3842: Seering Ceremony

All the experts bowed towards the Grand Seer, even those not from Black Wood Cliff. Everyone has heard of this famous cultivator before.

He stood before the well and time came to a halt. People didn’t want to breathe loudly and interrupt him.

He opened his eyes and glanced at everyone. Due to his age, his eyes were muddled as if he was on the verge of death. The fire of life could extinguish whenever. Nonetheless, no one dared to be disrespectful towards him.

“I observed the stars last night.” His eyes narrowed as he spoke in a feeble manner. Nonetheless, everyone heard him clearly.

Anticipation and anxiety built up for the crowd. They thought about what happened last night with Black Tides. Some opened their mouth, wanting him to hurry up and spill. Alas, they were smart enough to be patient.

“The astrological signs aren’t clear. It is best to prepare, gentlemen, for the changing Black Tides.” He slowly continued.

The crowd treated each word as if they were gold. The confirmation struck them hard. No one would question his words even without the fascinating event last night.

“Senior, may I ask what we should do?” A powerful ancestor inquired. Everyone wanted to know the answer as well.

The seer didn’t answer directly: “The stars are as different as can be, truly unusual.”

“Is it an auspicious or ominous sign?” The ancestor earlier asked again.

“That is yet to be determined. The only thing for certain is that the son of heaven has descended.” The Grand Seer closed his eyes and revealed.

“The son of heaven?” This stimulated the crowd.

“The rumored heavenly genius.”

A while ago, people claimed that Seer Watch had made a prediction about a heavenly genius. Now, the Grand Seer has confirmed it.

“What kind of genius? The future dao lord or someone who can stop this mess?” Another speculated.

“What are the criteria? One can’t be decided in this manner.” A genius said.

Of course, he wanted to be chosen as well. This would mean the easiest path and the brightest future possible.

“Who is it? And descended to which location?” One big shot asked for elaboration.

The Grand Seer coughed, a sign of a weak body. Strangely enough, the cough resonated in everyone’s ears like thunder.

The busily-debating crowd immediately stopped talking. All eyes were on him again.

“The will of heaven is impossible to read. I do not know any more information.” He said.

Some became disappointed, especially the geniuses. They hoped to be appointed as this heavenly genius but the Grand Seer didn’t seem to know.

“This is precisely the reason why a divination ceremony is necessary.” He added.

The disappointed members of the crowd became excited again.

“The heaven’s child might be right here or at the edge of the world.” He continued: “It is up to fate whether the well will tell us.”

No one else dared to speak and bother the Grand Seer after hearing this. He stretched out both hands, revealing how dry and aged they were, looking like bird claws.

He spread his fingers and seemingly encompassed the entire well. No one wanted to miss a single detail.

Most knew about the well rumored to be divine. However, it was useless in their hands. Only the seers would be able to use it, turning it into a tool to read the heaven’s will and the future.

They didn’t know whether this well had this ability at the start or the seers simply used it as a base for their art.

Thus, some visitors would come and take away a little bit of the water with them, hoping that this would bring them luck. Seer Watch didn’t have a problem with this.

Normally, the well would be decorated in a dignified manner for the ceremonies. This wasn’t the case this time due to the event’s rushed nature. Nonetheless, it shouldn’t matter because the Grand Seer was the one doing it.

He entered a state of zen while the other seers surrounding the well continuously chanted.

As the rhythm sped up, the disciples started dancing, clapping, and chanting as well. The faster they went, the more chaotic and crazy it seemed.

The spectators felt as if the world was spinning and they became stuck in freefall. This was a terrifying sensation for the first-timers. They couldn’t help but scream.

As for those who have participated in the past, they maintained a calm expression.

Eventually, the chants abruptly stopped along with the clapping. The crowd was able to stabilize themselves once more. The entire thing felt like a dream.

“Open!” Right as everything came to a halt, the Grand Seer opened his eyes and shouted. Dark clouds gathered beneath his palms and lightning bolts came out of his fingertips. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The sky turned dark as well. The sun was clearly up there but dark clouds and lightning gathered above.

“Rumble!” The ground started shaking as if something was awakening. Many felt a frightening power emerging from beneath.

“Splash!” The water in the well started rising upward. The thickness of this beam of water was the same as the mouth of the well. It seemed to be alive and gushed upward into the Grand Seer’s palms.

It resembled a puppy playing with its master as it rubbed against the Grand Seer’s hands. He then chanted an unknown mantra. No one here understood this ancient language.
