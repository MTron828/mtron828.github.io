Chapter 4669: Blessed Eighty Thousand Li Palm

“Boom!” Dominator soared into the air and disappeared from sight.

While most became disoriented due to his speed, a loud detonation and everything went black. This was due to a massive palm descending from above. It engulfed thousands of miles. Mountains became as small as a pile of mud. Living beings turned into insects.

The grand dao exploded and poured down dao laws of the dao lord level. Hymns and chants could be heard; this voice seemed to belong to Blessed Dao Lord and carried a suppressive affinity. The palm refined heaven and earth, subjecting its targets to demise.

“Blessed Eighty Thousand Li Palm.” An expert gasped after sensing the destructive power of the strike.

“He managed to duplicate the power of a dao lord via a merit law.” A big shot from the last generation became alarmed.

“This is a supreme technique. Eighty Thousand Miles relied on this to compete with a dao lord back then.” A high ancestor praised.

Many had seen dao lord merit laws; some even cultivated them. Alas, this palm strike contained an exceptional amount of dao lord power.

The target, Li Qiye, didn’t move at all as if he didn’t notice it.

“Watch out!” A spectator shouted to warn him but it was too late. The palm strike struck him directly.

The hit left behind a proportional print and uplifted the upper layer. It looked perfect as if meticulously carved. Even mountains were pushed into the ground, leaving spectators slack-jawed.

“Where did he go? Is he dead?” One of them looked around to find him.

They thought that he would have retaliated with something just as impressive, most likely a punch since he could easily borrow the power of Worldbreaker. Moreover, he was inside this time so things should be even simpler.

They envisioned him gathering fist intents to deliver a punch piercing through the palm strike, nullifying the technique. They even imagined him causing Dominator to scream in agony. Alas, Li Qiye appeared to be stunned and didn’t react at all.

“Is he mincemeat now?” One expert murmured since only the colossal hand print was visible.

Everyone started observing the ground carefully, hoping to find bits of Li Qiye.

“This doesn’t make any sense. He couldn’t stop a single attack yet he ran his mouth about flattening the alliance? Talk about not knowing your own limit.” A youth said with disdain.

“Look, over there!” Someone finally saw Li Qiye standing in the crater, not missing even a strand of hair.

“How?!” This prompted some to bellow in astonishment.

They all witnessed the direct hit from the top down. His body should have either exploded or crushed into bits. Even ancestors couldn’t make sense of this. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ancient ancestors recognized the power of the palm strike. They could withstand a direct hit but to be completely unscathed? Impossible.

“Did he dodge it somehow?” A big shot’s eyes were wide open.

“Maybe he teleported away and back.” Another said.

Li Qiye patted some dust off his sleeve and said: “How are you going to stop me with such meager cultivation? How disappointing.”

Dominator lost his composure and staggered backward. He had complete confidence in his palm strike.

It might not have been able to kill Li Qiye but grievous injuries should have been unavoidable. There was no one among the young generation who could fully evade his palm strike. In this case, Li Qiye took the attack directly without suffering any damage. The whole thing was unthinkable.

“Fellow Daoist Li, your abilities are unfathomable.” Princess Sima couldn’t help but praise. She continued: “But we have duties that must be carried out and won’t yield regardless of your power.”

“Is that so?” Li Qiye smiled and took one step forward.

Dominator instinctively took one step back while becoming numb. He was no fool and realized how grim it was after the first exchange. Unfortunately, as Sima Hanshan put it, they were responsible for keeping Li Qiye at bay until ancient ancestors were available to help.

On the contrary, Sima Hanshan didn’t relent and said with a solemn expression: “Though this is beyond my ability, I would still like to experience your techniques.”

Having said that, she summoned a treasure. It emitted a clear yet dangerous ringing, rupturing the eardrum instantly. Weaker cultivators started bleeding from the ears.

This was due to the dao lord power emanating from the treasure. The rays pricked those nearby in an uncomfortable and painful manner.

They saw her holding a disk with a hilt in the center and two blades with sharp teeth to the sides.

“Worldraiser Disk!” A big shot recognized the weapon.

“Another dao lord weapon.” Many exchanged glances, thinking that this was expected from True Immortal.
