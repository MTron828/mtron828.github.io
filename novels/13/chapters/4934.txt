Chapter 4935: Godchaser Brightstone

The students knew that Radiant Young Monarch was challenging this so-called harbinger of bad luck.

“He wants to challenge the Bringer of Bad Luck.” A student said quietly, giving Li Qiye a title.

“What? You want to try too?” Li Qiye responded to him.

His attitude only served to infuriate the young monarch. Though he only had one sacred fruit, he was still far superior to the young generation. Calling him a supreme genius wasn’t out of line.

Geniuses such as Swordgrasp, Halo, and Goldcrest had a long way before catching him. Therefore, Li Qiye’s attitude was utterly unacceptable. Many ancestors actually had to show him respect.

The fact that he hasn’t acted out yet showed considerable patience - or so he thought. If this was another place, he would have crushed the unknown junior already.

“Why not?” The young monarch said menacingly: “If you can’t back up your words, you will have to hand over the stolen item on top of facing a trial in Deity.”

He focused his gaze and an aura swept across the scene. Weaker cultivators fell flat on the ground.

Ming Shi, Yunyun, and Goldcrest roared, also releasing their dao power. This barely managed to stop the powerful flood. Nonetheless, this left them trembling since they couldn’t beat him even if they were to fight together.

“The monarch is showing his benevolence and righteousness.” A student from The Race praised.

In their estimation, Li Qiye was nothing more than an insignificant worm that could be effortlessly crushed underfoot by him. Therefore, sparing Li Qiye's life was an act of mercy and compassion on his part.

Li Qiye smiled: “I thought we’d made it clear that your Deity’s scrap metals can’t enter my sight. Nonetheless, if you wish to keep going, I’ll entertain you.”

"Agreed.” The young monarch declared: "In the event of my defeat, I will acknowledge my mistakes and accept any consequences."

"Buzz." A sacred flame enveloped him, each tendril exuding an aura of holiness that could purify sin and banish darkness. Any being with an evil nature would be unable to approach.

"Such holiness..." Many students were overwhelmed and fell to their knees in reverence.

"Hmm..." Even the powerful students stepped back, wary of the flame's oppressive effect.

“This is the truth of light, capable of stopping all evil arts and darkness.” Goldcrest Young Noble recognized it.

Previously, Halo Scion and Swordgrasp Young Noble didn’t believe this so they didn’t prepare any defense.

The young monarch didn’t buy it either but preferred to play it safe. Thus, he used this holy light to prevent anything from affecting him.

If Li Qiye possessed the ability to steal luck or was simply a bringer of misfortune, this ominous affinity would still be unable to penetrate the sacred flame.

Li Qiye smiled and went along with the act, reciting: "I claim your fortune and you shall gain nothing."

The flame on the young monarch fluctuated and pulsed dimly only for a split second. Nonetheless, everyone thought that it was a reaction to the “curse”.

As for him, he could sense the flame being stimulated by something but it had nothing to do with him. This feeling only lasted for a split second and he couldn’t react in time before it was gone.

“It’s starting.” Students were anxious to watch the development.

“Is he really bad luck incarnate?” Another said.

“No way, it’s just a coincidence.” Someone from The Race simply refused to believe this.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The young monarch approached the carriage, still surrounded by the sacred flame, not letting his guard down for a moment, lest he be infected by any ill fate. It was better to be cautious.

He retrieved a stone from an ancient box, which also exuded the same holy aura as the flame enveloping him. It appeared to be the origin of the light, and it left the audience in awe.

“Godchaser Brightstone.” A student from Deity blurted out.

“It’s famous just like the Jewel of Purification.” Another added.

A while back, Princess Ming Shi traded this jewel and now, he picked an artifact of similar value.

“He’ll get a great fortune.” All eyes were on him.

All the attempters so far couldn’t match up to the value of his item, the only exception being Princess Ming Shi.

After all, he was superior to her in virtually all aspects. He couldn’t present a worse treasure. If Princess Ming Shi could obtain something amazing, so should he.

“Even if it’s not an amazing treasure, he should still be able to get an item.” Those from The Race felt at ease.

“Hmph, that Li guy will lose for sure, there won’t be a third coincidence.” A fan of the young monarch said.

“Start.” The old man took it without looking twice and opened the sack.

“Buzz.” He reached in and activated a prying technique. Phenomena appeared in the sky - pagodas, valuable wheels, and many more…

It seemed that there were indeed countless treasures inside the sack.

He aimed deeper, wanting to pick up something special.
