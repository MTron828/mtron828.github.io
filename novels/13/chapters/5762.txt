Chapter 5763: I’ve Committed Crimes?

Li Qiye touched the rune, releasing a strand of primordial light. It seeped into the rune like rainfall meeting dry soil.

“Buzz.” A seed sprouted from the rune, growing into a tiny primordial tree. Branches and leaves came next, still growing into something unimaginable.

Chaos energy of the purest and highest concentration cascaded from the leaves. Taking a full breath would allow weaker cultivators to become stronger by several steps.

“Pop!” Essences condensed into primordial flowers. Their emergence was accompanied by dao hymns.

Each flower possessed a different sound. One had a metallic clanking, another was the gust from blade slashes. One had the sounds of the waves...

However, the tree started withering as if lacking nourishment, unable to handle the growth. The leaves became yellow and scattered; the dao fruits rotted like spoiled tangerines. As they fell to the ground, they disintegrated into particles.

When these particles touched the star, they created a tiny image of a primordial tree.

“Definitely missing something.” Li Qiye frowned after seeing this.

He found what he expected in this place. Alas, they were incomplete, missing the key part.

His star, on the other hand, still had great interest in its brethren within the circle. With every touch, the two issued a unique clanking sound that only it understood.

It seemed to enjoy the process and pulsed brightly with the beat, resembling a musician dancing to a song’s rhythm.

“You’re not seeking a mate, so why bother?” Li Qiye said playfully.

The star glared at him as if to say this was none of his business. The cloud got annoyed and touched the other star, breaking the metallic rhythm.

The cloud, infuriated, prepared for a skirmish.

“Enough, this isn’t a toy.” Li Qiye separated the two.

Ling’er couldn’t help but smile at their quarrel, momentarily reducing her sadness.

Li Qiye raised his hand and suppressed the power of the rune and the star.

“Boom!” Flames immediately erupted from the woman in the coffin. They resembled blood somehow and shot up into the air, leaving a long trail.

It seemed alive and fused with time and space - resulting in an indescribable presence. Lives were being created along the way, akin to a mother hen laying countless eggs that spawn into new life at every moment.

Li Qiye witnessed this absurd and eerie trail; his expression changed drastically. This prompted him to retract his primordial power.

“Boom!” The rune and the star immediately suppressed the woman again, recalling the flames back into her body.

“What have you done? This sin is unforgivable and irredeemable.” Li Qiye murmured while staring at the woman.

“Are you talking about me, Young Noble? I’ve committed crimes?” Ling’er trembled.

He patted her shoulder and shook his head: “Not you, you are innocent, just another victim.”

“Then who are you referring to?” She stared at the woman in the coffin and didn’t understand what was happening. Everything was beyond her imagination and comprehension.

“The person who caused all of this.” He said.

“Who is it, and who is she?” She asked.

“She is you.” He ignored the first question and only answered the second. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“How can there be two of me?” She asked. Having an identical twin was normal but this was unbelievable.

“You are one of many while she is the true you.” He gently touched her cheek.

“Why do you mean?” She asked.

He sighed and said: “What is the difference between me from yesterday and me today?”

“Nothing, both are you.” She pondered for a second before responding.

“Sure, but when my true self leaves the timeline, then the past and the present me become two different people. When they are extracted at the same time and placed into the future, wouldn’t there be three of me?” He said.

“I suppose...” She replied and sounded somewhat uncertain of this explanation.

“So what about this me?” She pointed at the woman.

“She is your origin, your past and future, while you are the present.” He sighed and said.
