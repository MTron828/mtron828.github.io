Chapter 5781: We Can Spar Instead

Myriad celestials and emperors worshipped where he stood. With a mere gesture, he could overturn myriad ages. None questioned his ability.

“World Emperor!” Everyone couldn’t help but shout his title in awe.

He dominated the thirteen continents and ruled over the three great races. Characters such as Crimson and Nether Emperor weren’t on his level.

He withstood the might of Celestial Court during Immemorial Epoch, besting one combatant after another with the help of Moon Embrace.

The armies of Celestial Court pursuing sinners couldn’t get past him. He bought enough time for The People to regroup and rest.

Eventually, he and his clan were turned to ashes, or so people thought. Future generations still remembered his title and glorious exploits, lamenting his passing.

Now, he stood before the crowd again and blocked an incredible attack.

“World Emperor, he’s still alive!” The People’s members were ecstatic beyond words.

“How is he still alive?” Celestial Court, on the other hand, became startled. The man still appeared as magnificent as ever.

He somehow stopped an attack from an Ancestor, earning the admiration of friends and foes alike.

“How did he survive?” Combatants of the war witnessed his death in person - his chest was pierced and he fell from the sky.

The attacker was none other than the mysterious guest of Celestial Court. Surviving was impossible.

However, they could see that he was perfectly well now, returning to his prime state or perhaps even stronger. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Three Immortals, which of you will come out first?” World Emperor gazed deeper into Celestial Court.

Listeners became emotional upon hearing this. They respected his courage while fearing the legendary figures.

Only a few had met the three immortals in history; only characters such as Hao Hai, Nether, and Sword...

Some top cultivators believed that they had reached the ancestral level - the reason why Celestial Court could command apex cultivators.

In terms of foes, Vine Conqueror’s assault made them show up. However, the two sides didn’t fight. After this meeting, cultivators were able to become conquerors.

“World, you’re still alive.” An ancient voice responded.

The trio found this puzzling since they witnessed the mysterious guest piercing his chest. They knew the identity of the guest, how could World Emperor have survived?

“Isn’t it time to fight, Heaven Authority?” World Emperor challenged.

Everyone paused the fight and exchanged glances. Was this an immortal’s name? What about the other two?

They then recalled the three immortal bloodlines - Heaven Authority, Divine Eternal, and Devil Bestowment.

“Brother, if you’re in the mood, we can spar instead.” A mysterious figure in Celestial Court appeared instead. His words resonated in everyone’s heart.

None could see him clearly due to his ethereal nature - only a shadow. However, they got the impression that he had understood the mysteries of the grand dao, capable of bending laws and dao to his will.

Thus, they thought they were looking at a dao, not a person. Staring at him for too long made them dizzy.

“Profound Emperor!” Some recognized this middle-aged man - another famous cultivator from the thirteen continents.

He was the youngest and perhaps the most talented among an elite group consisting of World, Crimson, and Yi Ye.
