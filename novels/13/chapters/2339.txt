Solitary became different - majestic and unreachable like the apex of the world. His weight was incalculable and immovable.

“Buzz.” The raising of his sword affected the space nearby as if it was pulling on the entire area. Just one flick could flip the world over.

People found it hard that this ninth-level True God would start with such a simple variation, only raising his sword upward without any preparation or difficult movements. This freestyle wasn’t worth pondering about, as insipid as water. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’m starting.” Solitary uttered each word clearly, carrying the same pull as his incoming slash.

“Whoosh!” A straightforward vertical slash came about.

In fact, calling it a slash might be inaccurate. He raised his sword then allowed it to fall down while maintaining a grip. There was no hacking movement.

The two of them were far apart despite being on the same altitude. This gigantic sword wasn’t going to touch Li Qiye.

It looked more like a child playing with a heavy sword, gesturing before the actual battle.

Due to his reputation, the crowd was ready for a flashy move containing profound dao and indecipherable techniques. However, even a three-year-old child could raise a sword and let it go down.

The disappointment didn’t last long, interrupted by a rumbling sound. Space below the sword began to shatter as if it was a massive piece of glass.

This horrific power gathered the weight of the world on the sword. Furthermore, it was perfectly under his control since only the space beneath was affected. It indicated his mastery over his sword.

For example, a person might be able to lift a sword weighing 100 pounds, but that’s it. Solitary, on the other hand, was able to lift a 200-pound sword with enough precision as if it was his own hand without any encumbrance.

The speed was as slow as an ant, but there was no escaping this technique since he aimed it straight for Li Qiye. It had nothing to do with space. Even if Li Qiye was far away, it was essentially right above his head already.

The spectators also felt this crushing pressure, imagining as if they were Li Qiye. The ones who were disappointed earlier were scared out of their mind. Some even dropped to their knees.

People started sweating, understanding Solitary’s notoriety. He could definitely beat any True God before the Eternal level. He established himself as the king of swords after showing off this move.

“Well done.” Li Qiye smiled before retaliating in a simple manner.

He raised his arm, lifted his hand and sword. A perfect flow without any wasted movement. Time seemed to be frozen at this point.

People couldn’t tell the exact weight of this bronze sword, only that it carried the gravity of ten thousand worlds. Just like Solitary before him, Li Qiye raised it without any difficulty.

Moreover, the frozen image meant that wherever the sword stopped, nothing could ever get through since it was the thickest and heaviest existence of all. Solitary’s slash was no exception.

The two moves finally collided. Of course, the physical swords weren’t actually touching due to the distance between them, but all spatial limitations were meaningless at this point.

Contrary to everyone’s expectations, a clank between two swords was missing. Only a loud boom like two heavy objects colliding.

Imagine two hard planets’ first impact. They didn’t collapse or suffer damage right away, only sending out shockwaves.

“Ah...” This injured people and made them vomit blood. The weaker ones were instantly turned to blood.

This was only the inevitable fallout of the impact, not directed at anyone in particular yet it could already harm the masters nearby.

The unharmed ones fell on their butt, paralyzed from the massive power of the attacks.

People couldn’t tell the victor just yet. Li Qiye’s sword froze everything into a still while Solitary’s sword stopped there, unable to advance. Intuition told the ancestors that Li Qiye had the upper hand.

Solitary instantly pulled back, wearing an expression appropriate for the most serious match of his life.

“My turn.” Li Qiye smiled and thrust his bronze sword forward.

His quick-draw was well documented at being imperceivable at this point. However, the crowd was disappointed since it wasn’t a swift thrust. In fact, it had nothing to do with the word “fast”.

A new practitioner could thrust much faster than this particular strike from Li Qiye.

He simply went with the flow and aimed for Solitary’s throat. One would be justified in thinking that this technique was rather lazy.

All of this instantly changed in the next second. The unremarkable and leisure thrust encompassed the greatest weight in actuality.
