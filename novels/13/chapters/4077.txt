Chapter 4078: Eight Treasures Splitting The Heaven

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The atmosphere became tense and spectators watched with bated breath.

Hundred-blade Noble’s eyes flashed menacingly as he spoke: “We can’t be considered taking advantage of you since you are a willing participant against all of us, Young Noble Li. Let’s see what you can do.”

Having said that, he patted behind his back. “Clank!” A box opened and countless divine swords soared upward. They posed behind him just like a forest. He raised both hands and they moved towards his front.

Terrible sword energies rampaged the area, causing the crowd to tremble. They felt a sharp pain after being brushed by the rays.

“Reversion Sword Art!” Spectators trembled at the sheer number of swords.

“Saberlearned Dao Lord is supreme indeed.” A previous-gen cultivator praised.

“Such unstoppable keenness, the unique dao lord stood out indeed.” An ancestor added.

Hundred-blade Noble was performing a sword dao named Reversion. Its creator was the second dao lord of Sea Emperor - Saberlearned.

He was a golem who had a great dao debut with the saber, virtually unmatched throughout the land. For some unknown reason later, he swapped from the saber to the sword. His sword dao became the focus instead for his ascension.

His decision solidified the sword as the main weapon of Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom for the future.

This feat was rather unique in history and could only be described as miraculous. Thus, this particular technique was a big deal when used by Hundred-blade Noble. The majestic and ferocious energies seen here had the style of the dao lord. He proved himself worthy of being a member of the ten prodigies.

“Activate!” Eight-armed Prince didn’t want to fall behind and roared.

He grew to the size of a giant in the blink of an eye. Just one stomp of his could take down a mountain or in this case - the plain.

He spread his hands and showed how massive they were - capable of raising the sky and suppressing the earth…

The eight treasures became resplendent, making it hard for the spectators to keep their eyes open.

The cauldron released an inferno; the pagoda had a light brighter than the sun… The sky was blotted out by his treasures. They looked like eight rising suns that were creating a new world.

“Eight Treasures Splitting The Heaven!” An expert shouted in astonishment.

This was a technique from the second dao lord of Armament - using eight treasures at the same time to their maximum potential.

Since Hundred-blade and Eight-armed have used their top technique, Starshooter didn’t want to fall behind.

He pointed his sword at the air and summoned a galaxy. The stars then turned into swords as he channeled more energy into it.

“You’re dead!” Eight-armed Prince was the first to enter the plain. Each of his steps caused a violent quake and damaged the ground.

The army of Armament also rushed forward with the force of a tsunami.

“Die!” Hundred-blade Noble’s countless swords flew towards Li Qiye like a torrent.

Starshooter Prince did the same and released a rain of swords down on the plain. His royal cavalry marched right behind them.

“Rumble!” The armies and the powerful techniques seemed hellbent on destroying the plain and Li Qiye.

Spectators trembled at this horrifying sight.

“They’re so strong!” One spectator roared. This group could actually destroy an entire sect, let alone one man.

“Can Li Qiye stop them?” Another wondered.

“I don’t think so, he’s all alone against several great powers.” One expert took a deep breath.

This wasn’t the extent of the sects’ true power either. Nonetheless, it was enough to destroy the average sect.

“Haha, he asked for it.” One youth sneered in response: “He thought that he could challenge these ancient lineages just because he’s rich. Hmph, he never stood a chance.”

Battle cries echoed from the other side while all eyes were on Li Qiye. No one else wanted to help him, not even Ning Zhu.

This eventually astounded the spectators.

“Does, does he really want to face these armies alone?” One of them asked. No one had confidence in his victory.

“You’ve made your choice, so be it.” Li Qiye smiled and raised his hand. The earth’s loop became radiant once more. Rays and thick fog suddenly appeared all over the plain.

“Careful, this might be a maze formation!” Hundred-blade Noble shouted.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
