Chapter 4466: Merchant Jian

The newcomer turned out to be a youth in high spirits. His eyes shifted back and forth to gauge the situation - a sign of craftiness.

He wore a non-fitting robe in a strange manner. It was oversized yet he tied it up by the wrists and ankles, leaving ample room within to store many things.

He also had a trunk tied to his back by a cloth - showing that he was a traveling merchant. This wasn’t an uncommon sight. However, the trunk was just ridiculously large. An extendable piece of cloth stuck out from the top of the trunk. Its purpose was to shield him from the sun and rain when necessary. He didn’t seem to feel the weight of the trunk either. He walked as if it was as light as a feather.

If anyone else were to spy on their saber art, the Wu members might just kill them outright. Alas, the merchant was not a stranger.

Everyone knew who he was and considered him a friend. He was as slippery as a loach and could travel anywhere.

In fact, all four clans were friends with him. He sold them strange yet useful gadgets.

“Jian Ming, did you follow us?” One youth glared at him.

“You’re finished for interrupting our meditation, Wise Ancestor is going to teach you a lesson.” Another added.

“Scram already, Jian Ming, don’t delay our session.”

The youths sheathed their saber, no longer acting aggressively like before.

The young merchant still wore a smile, seemingly unaffected by the complaints. However, he noted that Wise Ancestor was not happy.

“Wise Ancestor, I came across this place by accident and wanted to take a look, that’s all.” He smiled.

Wise Ancestor couldn’t do anything about it. He might not be an official member of their clan but wasn’t far from it.

After all, the four clans were on the same side. Moreover, this youth has been active and amiable, winning everyone’s love.

“Heaven Traversing Eight Slashes.” The merchant then said with admiration: “Congratulations, brothers. This is your origin saber art, the legacy of Martial Ancestor.”

“Seems like you know quite a bit.” Li Qiye spoke.

At first, the merchant only focused on diffusing the situation with the Wu members. Li Qiye was blocked by the group so he didn’t see him on the stone bed.

The moment he saw Li Qiye’s face, he couldn’t believe his own eyes and started rubbing them. He opened his eyes again and became frozen.

“Got a good look yet?” Li Qiye smiled.

The merchant looked as if he was struck by lightning. His soul nearly left his body but he regained his wits and got on his knees. He smacked his forehead on the ground repeatedly while speaking: “I, Jian Ming, a descendant of the Jian, respectfully greet you, Ancestor!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This display of reverence was one level above the Wu’s. A while ago, they treated him as juniors officially meeting their ancestor - a very proper showing.

As for Jian Ming, he crazily smacked his forehead, seemingly overwhelmed with emotions.

“Jian Ming, he’s our ancestor.” Wise Ancestor didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, feeling that the brat was trying to steal their ancestor.

“Isn’t this too exaggerated?” Li Qiye smiled while the youth was still bowing.

“I am but a brat from the dog pen, to be blessed by your supreme radiance, prestigious aura, and matchless voice…” The youth spewed out a barrage of flattery.

“Stop, speak normally.” Li Qiye shook his head: “It looks like you are quite lucky, to be able to enter the secret domain.”

“Your insight is incredible.” The youth was shaken.

His current state of mind couldn’t be understood by the others because he knew that Li Qiye wasn’t just an ancient ancestor.

He has been fortunate enough to visit a particular place. There, he saw miracles and knew who Li Qiye actually was.

“As I said earlier, Ancestor, everything I have is thanks to your blessing.” The youth didn’t dare to get up.

“Rise, member of the Jian.” Li Qiye said softly and sighed, feeling a bit disappointed about the past: “No need to be so formal, be at ease.”

“Thank you, Ancestor.” The youth finally got up.

“Call me young noble.” Li Qiye said before assessing: “Hmm, looks like the Jian has a capable successor.”

“I’m afraid my worthlessness will only bring shame to the clan.” The youth said: “Well, our current branch right now in Inner Ruins is only an outer branch, the main branch isn’t here.”

“Your branch wasn’t the only one.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, Young Noble. Several branches followed the forefather to create Eight Desolaces and decided to take roots here. We do not represent the main branch.” The youth said.

The listeners from the Wu were at a loss. Only Wise Ancestor had an idea regarding this topic. Alas, he knew less than the youth because the latter traveled extensively while he was stuck in the clan for the most part.

Among the four clans, this youth was one of the most knowledgeable.

“It’s fine, this is another path, not bad at all.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We owe it to you, Young Noble.” The youth hurriedly responded.

This was indeed the truth, not mere flattery. He saw many things in the secret domain and gained a better understanding of the four clans along with many other lineages.

Currently, the four clans had a deep history with Eight Desolaces and Inner Ruins. Alas, they didn’t know that this wasn’t originally their home. Moreover, they weren’t actually part of the main branch.

For example, the Wu started with Alchemy Saint according to their record. Alas, their history was far older than that.

In reality, Alchemy Saint started the clan in another area, not Inner Ruins. The latter became their home due to the saber saint. She followed the duck egg buyer and eventually created a branch in Inner Ruins.

In other words, they were only a branch of the orthodox clan. Alas, they lost contact long ago and current members had no idea about it.

Something similar also happened to the other three clans - the Tie, Jian, and Lu.

Their ancestors left their homes in order to help the duck egg buyer. Eventually, these cultivators decided to stay in Eight Desolaces.
