Chapter 5727: How Ruthless

“Still want to enter?” Li Qiye appeared before them with a smile.

The two stopped and exchanged glances, wondering if there was another way.

“I’m afraid there is no escape this time.” Li Qiye read their minds.

Their complexion alternated between green and white. All of their efforts and sacrifices of embarking on the dao limit path were in vain because of Li Qiye. Their dream journey lasted but several days.

They felt agonizing anguish and frustration from being helpless. Li Qiye resembled an insurmountable mountain, preventing them from escaping.

“It’s them!” Many survivors finally noticed the two.

“How dare you show your face here?!” Someone shouted with rage.

Under normal circumstances, regular cultivators didn’t dare to breathe loudly in the presence of apex cultivators. They trembled in fear, not daring to lift their head and look straight at the duo. Alas, rage overcame fear in this case.

“You bring disgrace upon the descendants who have died for the clan!” The members of West Bank roared thunderously at him while tears streamed down their face as they dropped to the ground.

Life was difficult for the survivors - perhaps death would have been more bearable. Their faith crumbled since the progenitor who once held a supreme position in their heart turned out to be the mastermind behind everything.

He built the clan and ended up destroying it. This simple statement couldn’t express the tragic death of his descendants and the pain of the survivors. They were willing to jump into boiling water and die for him, only to be used as sacrificial pawns.

The duo only gazed at the crowd, not bothering to react.

“Are you still human?!” A survivor screamed at West Bank Prime Emperor with a hoarse voice.

Of course, the two were still humans and apex cultivators. It was just that they had a different mindset now - that they had leaped out of this world filled with ants.

This included their descendants as well. Killing the world was no different than stomping an ant nest.

“Do you witness their suffering?” Li Qiye asked.

The two exchanged glances and took a deep breath. Luminous stepped forward and said solemnly: “Sacred Teacher, living beings are mere ants at the end of the dao path, I believe you hold the same belief.”

“And?” Li Qiye smiled.

“What do ants have to do with me?” Luminous said.

“We have left this world behind.” West Bank said: “They are ephemeral like the passing clouds.”

“Bastard! We were willing to sacrifice our lives for you!” Survivors from West Bank cursed him, infuriated by his lack of remorse.

Remember, their clan had followed him to the battlefields against Celsetial Court. How many passionate members had died for him?

“Looks like you two have abandoned yourselves and your conviction.” Li Qiye said.

“Sacred Teacher, we are not to be blamed.” West Bank couldn’t help but raise his voice: “We toiled for Dao City for eras, what price had we not paid yet there are no spots for us on the dao limit path.”

“If we weren’t given one, then we deserve to make our own path in Immortal Dao City.” Luminous added.

“You two would have swallowed this entire world if it meant everlasting life.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “You fought for your own cultivation and belief, not for anyone else.”

“It doesn’t change the fact that we deserve spots.” West Bank said.

“You’re mistaken. Immortal Dao City and everyone else owe you nothing, definitely not to the level of being offered to Celestial Court.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“It was just a method of cultivation, nothing more.” Luminous responded.

“And you are unworthy of cultivation. You have harvested from this world and its dao, it is time to return what you have taken.” Li Qiye said.

“What are you trying to do?” The two staggered backward after hearing this.

“Nothing, just that killing you is not enough.” Li Qiye said.

“How ruthless, Sacred Teacher.” Luminous’ expression darkened. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“How amusing, you two sacrificed countless lives and felt no remorse and repentance but when I sacrifice you back to the world, I’m the ruthless one? The concept of sacrifice seems to change when it comes to me.” Li Qiye clapped while laughing.

The two started thinking about how to run. Alas, this was futile since he could easily block them.

“Still want to run? Celestial Court? That won’t work. No place in this world can save you from me.” Li Qiye said.

The two became frozen because Celestial Court was indeed on their mind. No other alternative existed but how were they going to lose him?
