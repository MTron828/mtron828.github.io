Chapter 4946: Old Man Sweeping Leaves

He came from Maddened and was a genius from Madflame Sacred Ground. He once competed with Phenomena Conqueror but for unknown reasons later on, he betrayed his sect and left to become a villain.

His mind was unstable, occasionally breaking out in bursts of violence. The most destructive bout left an inferno ravaging half of Maddened. Billions died as a result.

One explanation included his cultivation type, that he had an inner devil in his mind. Thus, he turned into a devil form whenever he went crazy. This was different from other practitioners of this dao.

Of course, students were rightfully horrified to see him. The other dragon lords were holding back including Stone Lion God. On the other hand, this madman could try to burn the entire academy. The invaders kept on appearing, one stronger and crazier than the previous.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

A total of five dragon lords hovered in the sky. Anyone of them could cause untold destruction. Stars trembled from their mere auras.

However, even those from Deity didn’t like seeing Maddened God. They were considered gentlemen when compared to Maddened God.

“Old man, hand over Benevolence Vessel or I will burn your school down.” Maddened God threatened.

“Maddened is running errands for Deity as well?” The schoolmaster frowned slightly.

“Bah.” Maddened God said with disdain: “Deity ain’t shit. I heard that your student stole a supreme treasure and I’m interested. Hand it over or there will not be a single blade of grass left here soon.”

“You need to watch your tone here.” The schoolmaster didn’t appreciate the threat.

“Fine, old man, you choose the hard way. I will burn your academy down first before taking the treasure.” Maddened God laughed and siad.

“Benevolence belongs to Immortal Pagoda.” Stone Lion God walked forward; his demonic aura intensified.

“Deity will not share it with outsiders.” Oblivion Monarch sided with the demon god.

“Indeed.” Arrow Saint fixated his gaze on Bai Shaojin.

Stone Lion God, Oblivion Monarch, Arrow Saint, and Reincarnation City Lord moved into position, ready to deal with Maddened God and the schoolmaster.

“What are we going to do…?” A horrified student asked. Three of the dragon lords had four sacred fruits and two had three.

“Let’s get started already.” Maddened God didn’t react to being surrounded by the opponents. Perhaps he didn’t care at all: “Old man, you will regret this decision.”

Having said that, he spat out an inferno that turns into a fire dragon. Space turned into smoke due to the terrible heat while students shouted in horror.

Alas, they couldn’t do anything about it. Just one ember was enough to obliterate them. They thought that Abroad was going to disappear after this.

As for the schoolmaster, his expression darkened as he prepared to go all out against the inferno in order to protect the academy.

However, someone was ahead of him. The raging inferno couldn’t get close to the academy at all. The tumultuous explosions of the blazing inferno were upstaged by the soft rustling of a broom sweeping the ground.

This came from an old man who was sweeping the leaves on the steps leading to the academy, gathering them into a pile. The fire dragon couldn’t get closer at all.

With every sweep, the dragon seemed to be pushed backward. The crowd couldn’t believe their own eyes.

Maddened Dao was a terrible type of flame, even surpassing that of a dao lord or conqueror’s trueflame. How could this old man block it so easily?

Students stared at him, astounded. They saw him all the time in the past because at dawn, he was always there to sweep each day.

The schoolmaster and Bloodsea shared the sentiment, and the same for Stone Lion God's group. The schoolmaster has been here for so long yet he didn’t know how powerful this old man was.

Bloodsea used to be a long-term student here. He recalled seeing the old man on his first day. Every subsequent morning, he woke up early to train the saber dao. He also saw the old man sweeping the leaves without fail but didn’t think much of it.
