Chapter 5270: Eat

“I cannot see you while resorting to force.” He sighed and admitted.

“You’re welcome to try again.” She said provocatively.

“Don’t push me or I’ll change my mind and you won’t be leaving this place alive.” He said.

“I’m not afraid of you, Li.” She smiled charmingly while giving him the side-eye.

“I’m not falling into your trap, I have plenty of patience.” He shook his head in response and said.

“What do you have to be afraid of in this world? If there are, let me know, I’m rather curious.” She asked.

“There’s nothing, I just don’t want to fall into your trap.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Seems like you’re not too stupid, Li.” She continuously switched back and forth between arrogance and charm.

“I’m sure that you will show me in due time, there’s no need to rush it right now.” He said.

“Sure, how about right now?” She suddenly pushed Li Qiye to the side and got on top.

Li Qiye had a natural expression and didn’t try to stop it: “I’m ready to take a look if you’re ready to take them off.”

“Is that all you’ll be doing, just taking a look?” She became bolder and pressed teasingly against Li Qiye.

“Sigh, so many have tried to crush me in the past. I normally refuse but it seems hard to refuse in this situation. How can I say no to a beauty?” He said while reflecting on the past for a second.

He paused for a second and said: “Don’t be too rough, I make a living with my handsome face.”

“Is that so?” She opened her mouth and tried to bite him.

He tilted his head and evaded just in time: “Don’t do that, I feel like I’m looking at a gaping, bloodthirsty maw.”

“Say that again and see what happens!” She threatened before changing her tone to something more serious: “Li, you have debts that must be repaid.”

“Tell me then, what do I owe?” His eyes narrowed after hearing this.

Her eyes shifted in rumination before she giggled in response: “That depends on what you can afford to repay… hey, do you like looking into people’s souls that much?”

She noticed his gaze and intertwined her fingers with his again.

“I’m just trying to remember you, I’m sure we’ve met.” He shook his head.

“This is just proof of the number of women you have let down. Too many to remember.” She coquettishly hit him while still hiding her memories and soul.

“I never owe anyone anything, so it seems like you got the wrong person if you’re here to collect a debt.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I disagree.” She suddenly reached for his heart, seemingly wanting to piece it.

“Does that hurt?” Despite not actually making contact, the pain was still there so she asked.

“Interesting, you do know me.” He grimaced slightly.

“You have a masochistic tendency, wanting to be tortured to the brink of death before believing that someone else there understands you.” She said.

“It’s peculiar that you managed to pinpoint my weakness, let me return the favor.” Li Qiye shook his head and instantly shifted the agonizing sensation.

“You son of a bitch!” She trembled violently, having a stronger reaction than Li Qiye’s. The pain made her turn pale as she shouted and moved her face closer to his.

“You’re really here for me.” He looked at her and sighed, removing the spell.

“Yes, I told you already, I’m here to beat you up.” She smiled after the pain was removed.

“Don’t you know that this is my world?” He asked.

“Let me enter your world then.” She remarked with alluring flashes in her eyes. However, there was a dangerous aura lurking within.

“Which one?” He asked.

“What do you think? Open your mind and let me take a look.” She held his fingers tighter.

“No, open yours.” Li Qiye blocked her attempt.

“You go first if you wish to see mine.” She negotiated with a smile and tried to break through again.

“I do not negotiate, I’m the one bullying, never the opposite.” He blocked it again.

“Fine, go ahead then.” She pressed closer; their lips nearly touched.

He smiled and sensed her divine intent. However, she locked onto him and whispered: “Do you want to intertwine our lives together?”

“You have a death wish.” Li Qiye felt that something was wrong.

“Or perhaps, death is better than life.” She laughed beautifully. The sound contained a deep sense of affection and created a feeling of entanglement - twisting their life together.

“Boom!” Li Qiye stopped her and said seriously: “We mustn’t.”

“You finally remember?” She coldly stared at him.

“Is it true?” Li Qiye said with uncertainty.

“You tell me, Li, you sound confused.” She said.

“I am not, but this is a trap.” He shook his head.

“What’s wrong, are you afraid?” She exuded dominance even when speaking to Li Qiye.

“It’s not that I’m afraid, I just see a lack of good faith in our discussion, that changes things.” He smiled.

“Bam!” She pressed down again and said: “Men hate it when women take the initiative, it takes the fun out of the conquest. Would this be more interesting if I play shy? So that you can bring out your primal instincts and tear my clothes off?”

“Let’s skip that, I don’t have such a preference. I don’t mind women who take the lead so if you take them off, I will take a good look.” Li Qiye said.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Boom!” She clashed his dao heart this time with her own - ready to go down with him.

However, he was ready and prevented total destruction. He grabbed her hands and said: “Is our feud this serious?”

“Let me think?” She still smiled after losing again: “I want to drink your blood and taste your flesh.”

“I’ve heard that too many times before, it’s meaningless at this point.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Bam!” She pinned him down, refusing to let him go easily.

Her eyes shimmered as she targeted his mind. Unfortunately, it remained sealed and rejected her advances.

“I’m different, when I say it, I mean in the sense of a female mantis devouring the male.” She smiled.

“You’re giving me goosebumps.” He shook his head: “Our feud can’t be this extreme.”

“You keep saying it’s a feud. Don’t you think there’s a chance I want to eat you out of love?” She chuckled.
