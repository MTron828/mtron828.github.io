Li Qiye didn’t turn back and chuckled: “She’s doing well and is very happy. Like father, like daughter, she is just as great as you so you should feel proud.” He left with that.

He didn’t tell her the truth because he spent everything to sever her bloodline back then so that she could fly away, far from Heaven Spirit to the edge of the worlds!

Alas, she still chose to return in the end, back to her home. After a full circle, she eventually came back to the beginning. This might not be the result True Martial wanted but Li Qiye still respected her choice.

After all, she had many paths to take including one that would make her an emperor. Nevertheless, she still came back because she loved this land and her father. Thus, she must embark on his unfinished path.

He might not know of his daughter’s choice but as Li Qiye has said, he should feel proud of her. She has never faltered before difficult choices and chose to face them head on so she should be his pride.

Behind every brilliant daughter is a great father. This comment was perfectly apt.

He returned to the pavilion afterward and stay there in order to replenish Hallowed’s life.

Fortunately, the pavilion has prepared all the necessary alchemy ingredients for the process. This made Li Qiye’s life much easier. During the process, many visual phenomena occurred in this sect such as lightning waves all over the sky with rambunctious detonations as if a heavenly tribulation was descending.

This terrible period lasted several days before finally dispersing. The disciples here could finally rest easy.

The ancestors were ecstatic. They understood the significance behind this, a successful life replenishment of their Hallowed Ancestor.

A character like Hallowed was too important to the pavilion. It meant that he could protect them for several more generations!

Li Qiye has done everything he needed after this life replenishment so it was time for him to leave. However, he met the Seven Martial Goddess alone before leaving. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He looked at her and eventually said: “In a short time, your Hallowed Ancestor will tell you something. This means that it won’t be long until you become a sea god and the Trident will show up again.”

“Really?” The goddess spoke with skepticism: “The Trident didn’t appear in the last generation, will it show up this time?”

“That’s the last generation.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “There was a reason for its disappearance but it shall arrive in this one.”

“Why are you so certain?” The goddess curiously asked.

“The need for protection.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “This is a very critical period so the Bonesea requires a sea god to protect it until the next generation. Because of my provocation, both the Bonesea and the Divine Tree Ridge feel threatened. So, if they had a sea god or a treefather, they could have one more option.”

“Thus, I won’t assume anything about a treefather but the Trident will show itself and that is when you show your skills.” Li Qiye said solemnly.

She pondered a bit before answering: “Rumor has it that the Trident picks its master, I might not be chosen.”

“Aren’t you always confident? Why did you lose it all of a sudden?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but chuckle.

The goddess smiled wryly back. In the past, she was indeed very confident. She even thought she could defeat Li Qiye before he truly showed his might and gotten to know him. After all, she has mastered the seven styles. This was why she had immense confidence in her strength in the future.

But now, she had no hope of defeating LI Qiye. Her confidence was not worth mentioning. She understood that she wouldn’t have the chance to challenge him in this lifetime.

She has once said that she would challenge him after becoming a sea god. However, she knew that even after becoming one, it was far from enough to defeat him.

“Be confident in yourself.” Li Qiye stated: “Not being able to beat me is not something to be ashamed about. In the nine heavens and ten earths, you won’t the only one who is afraid of me either. Remember, you are one of the few people in the history of the pavilion who have mastered the seven styles. Your future will be brilliant; your achievements could even be on the same level as the Prime Sea God.”

“I understand.” She took a deep breath and stood proudly with her eyes lighting up. The confident goddess has returned again!

“The Trident will pick you.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Even if it doesn’t, no big deal, just seize it then. It’s not like your pavilion hasn’t done this before. Once you could wield it, you will become sea god regardless of whether it picks you or not.”

She solemnly nodded since Li Qiye was right regarding this matter. Their pavilion has done this before. In the past, Deep Blue Sea God actually seized the Trident by force! Moreover, the Hallowed Ancestor was still around in case she needed assistance!

“I have faith in you.” He looked at her and said: “Just work hard and you’ll be a sea god. The important part is whether you will be ready after becoming one.”

She calmly met his gaze with her own that seemed to be illuminating into his mind. After a long time, she nodded: “Don’t worry, I’ll remember you well. If I have made a choice, I shall do it without letting you down.”

“Very good. One day, you will be a hero of the sea demon race, the greatest sea god of them all.” Li Qiye smiled and said while getting ready to leave.

She stopped him: “Young Noble Li.”

Li Qiye slowly replied: “There’s something else?”

“I heard the Hallowed Ancestor said that you’re not just leaving Heaven Spirit?” She hesitated for a moment before speaking.

Li Qiye confirmed: “Yes, when I leave, it won’t just be leaving Heaven Spirit since I’ll be off to a faraway place.”

“Will I be able to say goodbye before you leave?” She eventually stared deeply at him.

“Yes. Don’t forget that you still owe me. In this world, anyone who owes me will have to pay in the end when the time is right.”

The goddess smiled and nodded solemnly: “I will repay what I owe you, Young Noble.”

With that, he turned and left while she watched his departing back until he was out of sight.

Finally, Li Qiye and Su Yonghuang traveled towards the sky. Each of the nine worlds had a gigantic dao platform. It was the portal connecting all of them. However, it was sealed after the Black Dragon King tore apart the Heaven’s Will.

He was thinking of using this dao platform to return to the Mortal Emperor World. However, there was someone quietly waiting for him there. It was a woman with a cold expression, Sima Yujian who has left several days ago.

“Why are you here?” He was surprised to see her.

“I was ordered to follow you, Young Master.” She bowed after seeing. She was completely different and respectful this time around.

“Young Master?” His eyes became serious as he immediately turned around while being affixed to a certain spot in the sky.

He took a step forward and instantly climbed into the nebula above.

“Come out, there is only one person in the world who has cultivated the Godslaying Dao to this level.” He said slowly.

The nebula was still silent with no one appearing.

“It’s been so many years, Shadowless, but you are still so cautious. I chose you back then precisely because of your prudence.” Li Qiye didn’t blame the guy for not showing up and laughed.
