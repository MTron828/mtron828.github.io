Chapter 5011: Gifting The Two God Sources

Radiant Monarch’s claim was based on confidence. It was only a matter of time before he obtain seven or eight sacred fruit to surpass Wild Dragon.

Moreover, Conceal Conqueror was present as well so Wild Dragon had no chance of stopping Godchaser.

Nonetheless, Wild Dragon was an experienced leader who had led villains against the world before. He survived many encounters with Eight-stallion Dao Lord previously.

Therefore, he didn’t find it dreadful to be in a room with these dragon lords.

“We shall eliminate you if you insist on your evil ways.” Radiant Monarch said.

“Haha, youths are always so aggressive.” Wild Dragon laughed: “We’ll see who can wait it out.”

He knew that he had no chance of fighting Radiant Monarch and Conceal Conqueror alone. After all, the latter managed to kill Eight-stallion Dao Lord.

However, he could just run back to Demon and enjoy the protection of the serpent deity. Time was on his side since these two might not stay in the lower continents forever.

If they were to leave, Deity and Godchaser would no longer have a chance against him.

“Okay, okay, gentlemen, we’re not here to feud. Put your problems aside and drink instead.” Golden Cicada mediated.

“That’s fine since I have two goals today. First, I want your two god sources. Second, I want to meet Bloodfly God.” Wild Dragon said.

The others became emotional after hearing the commanding god brought up. These gods were supreme as long as they were in the territory of Demon. Everyone here feared them.

This was especially true for the notorious Bloodfly. Rumor has it that this god enjoyed sucking blood from cultivators, leaving only dried corpses behind.

“Of course, Brother. I invited everyone here so that we may take a look at the god sources together.” Golden Cicada smiled.

He ordered a disciple nearby to go fetch them. It didn’t take long before both sources were placed on the table in the center for everyone to see.

Their power was as vast as an ocean and bathed the crowd. The demons and beasts in particular enjoyed this special affinity.

Peacock Monarch’s god sources were the finest materials for their dao comprehension and cultivation. Thus, some salivated and fantasized about seizing them.

Of course, they weren’t foolish enough to actually carry this out in the presence of numerous masters.

“Peacock Monarch is incredibly strong.” Radiant Monarch couldn’t help but praise.

“I have nothing but respect for him. Unfortunately, he has run out of time.” Wild Dragon said.

Just these fragments oozed with energy, let alone the power of the commanding god during his prime.

“Who is the strongest out of the six commanding gods?” Jun Cuican asked.

The dragon gods exchanged glances and didn’t want to answer. In Demon, commanding gods were the strongest when not counting founder gods.

Those with six sacred fruits still didn’t dare to disrespect these beings by commenting recklessly.

Of course, Wild Dragon was the exception. He said without holding back: “Vine God is the strongest and the oldest out of the six.”

He had no fear due to his special status in Serpent. When its commanding god was absent, he was in charge of this branch.

“I have no problem with that assessment.” Golden Cicada had no choice but to admit this.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s been a while since we last heard anything about Vine God.” Pagoda Guardian said.

Vine God has been a commanding god for longer than anyone else. Wood was the branch, founded by Demon Conqueror.

Vine has been in charge ever since this conqueror left Demon. It’s been a long time since Vine was seen in public.

“However, I respect Peacock Monarch the most because he has brought peace and stability to Demon.” Wild Dragon said with a smile.

The demons had no problem with this while outsiders refrained from commenting.

Demon was currently one of the strongest lineages right now in the lower continents. It had always united against external enemies, all six branches included.

Thus, opposing Demon in its own territories meant death. Not even conquerors could survive. This ongoing unity was started by the capable Peacock Monarch.

“Putting that aside, I want to meet Bloodfly God, he should be around.” Wild Dragon said.

Demons and beasts considered it a great honor to meet a commanding god. Thus, they became rather excited.

Cultivators from the outside world also shared the same sentiment, albeit to a lesser extent.

“The commanding god will see everyone but I have a small problem first.” Golden Cicada said: “If anyone can come up with an acceptable solution, the reward shall be these two god sources.”

“?!” This shocked all the listeners.

“You are giving away the two sources?” Wild Dragon asked for confirmation.

“As you already know, Brother Wild Dragon, gathering all six has a special significance.” Golden Cicada said.
