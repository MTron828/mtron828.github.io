Chapter 4213: Semicircle

Peace Ocean Sword King stepped forward and stole everyone’s attention.

“Be careful, I’m starting now.” He said.

“Go for it. I’m ready.” Li Qiye smiled nonchalantly.

“Buzz.” A bright flash appeared as the king raised one finger. He chose to use a finger attack instead of unsheathing his sword.

Lights began gathering at his fingertip and turned into sword rays. They ravaged the sky and horrified the spectators.

Just one finger of his released a massive amount of energy, enough to kill thousands of foes. Spectators took a deep breath; the weaker members hurriedly retreated since they couldn’t withstand the rays.

“Clank!” A metallic hymn resounded as all the rays turned into divine swords floating above him.

Destruction surged like a tsunami from the swords, capable of piercing through everything. The crowd saw how endless this ocean of swords was. It could rain down and destroy the earth.

“Such mighty sword energies.” An expert gasped after seeing how rampant the king’s energy was.

It permeated every inch of the land and infiltrated everyone’s pores. He seemed to be omnipresent. Just a single thought of his would result in fatal laceration and penetration.

This wasn’t a particular technique or anything. The king simply used his strongest sword dao to take over the region. He became the ruler of this area; all others were mere fish on the chopping board.

“Die!” He roared after channeling enough energy.

“Clank!!!” All the swords resonated in unison, resulting in a deafening clank.

The swords came down like a waterfall right above Li Qiye, piercing through space so distance became a meaningless aspect. Once the waterfall appeared, the bottom was already right next to his head.

Escaping was futile because the frightening sword energies were fixated on Li Qiye like leeches, not to mention the broad area of effect. A direct block was impossible as well because the waterfall was endless. They wouldn’t stop until nothing was left of their victim. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s coming!” A spectator shouted.

Everyone wanted to see how Li Qiye would react to this blow. He shouldn't be strong enough to stop it but then again, he had done so against Void just a moment ago.

It aimed for his forehead with lightning speed and ultimate power. His skull seemed more fragile and brittle than fried dough.

In this split second before death, he calmly flicked his sword to draw a semicircle around him. It wasn’t a perfect one and looked like the moment of an old man sweeping his courtyard early in the morning.

“Clank! Clank!” Nonetheless, sword hymns could be heard and something bizarre happened instantly.

The waterfall seemed to be drawn in by the circular motion and changed its trajectory. It arced around Li Qiye before shooting upward like a rainbow. The new target became its master, possessing the same endless property as before.

The king’s eyes turned cold and waved his hand, creating another ocean of swords to stop the incoming torrent.

The world spun while explosions detonated in a cataclysmic manner. Swords were turned into planetary sparks of sheer destruction, enough to destroy a sect or a kingdom. Violent gales came next and nearly lifted the crowd off their feet.

“The raw power…” Spectators were in awe while looking at the red sky vault and the continuous explosions.

“He is deserving of his fame. Look, he still hasn’t unsheathed his sword but still strong enough to sweep through the young generation.” An ancestor commented.

The youths exchanged glances and didn’t say anything. They admitted that he was on the next level compared to them. It wasn’t easy to do so given their pride.

“Truly impressive.” Even Dong Ling and his peers thought the same.

The Ten Sword Prodigies stood at the top of the young generation. Alas, there seemed to be a drastic gap between them and Peace Ocean.

He had reached a level where he could exert a sword dao with one hand wave.
