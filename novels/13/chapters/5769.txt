Chapter 5770: To Death

The four statues and the dao platform displayed the central hub of Celestial Court.

Most believed that the palace was the most important aspect but only the true masters paid particular attention to the statues.

Light-dragon and Heaven Burial Conqueror knew very little of them. Only high-status cultivators like Sword Emperor or Immortal Emperor Hao Hai were privy to the truth.

The five colossal structures represented the overlords behind Celestial Court - Primal Ancestor, Lord of Derivation, Stonesplitter Patriarch, Imperial Progenitor of Myriad Realms, and Dao Ancestor.

The ugly platform in the center depicted Lord of Derivation. Of course, this was the simplest depiction of the cultivator. Those who had seen the true form before were traumatized forever.

In Celestial Court, the founder and the three immortals had the most information on the overlords. Next would be Sword Emperor’s group.

Given the number of leaders, who was actually in charge of Celestial Court and gave commands? Outsiders often speculated about this matter.

Normally, commanders came from Nether and Sword Emperor. However, matters of high importance were decided by the founder and the three immortals.

As for potentially earth-shattering issues? They would come directly from the overlords.

Those in the know understood that the overlords weren’t unified. Two branches existed in Celestial Court - Bloodline and Dao.

Primal Ancestor and Lord of Deviration belonged to the former. The three immortals and Nether Emperor were part of this branch.

Stonesplitter, Imperial Progenitor, and Dao Ancestor represented Dao Branch. Next were Immortal Emperor Hao Hai, Sword Emperor, and the mysterious Profound Emperor who has been missing for a long time.

As for the found, his stance was unclear. Some said that he played the role of an arbitrator, being neutral enough to be trusted with Elder Galaxy.

At this time, Demon and her coalition had reached the gate of Celestial Court. She and Immortal Emperor Ren Xian had a serious expression while gazing at the statues. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Calamity Dao Lord and those in the know felt the same way. They understood that this was an uphill battle.

The armies of Celestial Court alone were difficult enough to defeat, not to mention the numerous overlords behind them.

Although these overlords have not been seen for a long time, this didn’t mean that the probability of their appearance was zero.

Demon and others, powerful, but still weren’t qualified to face overlords. Nonetheless, they knew that ultimately, Li Qiye was on their side. He wanted to kill these overlords, so perhaps he would show up at the right time.

As for the other side, they saw the primordial glow on their opponents - a sign of Li Qiye’s support for The People.

“Fellow Daoists, quite an incredible feat to cross the celestial river in full force.” Light-dragon remarked.

“The gates behind you shall fall today.” Demon’s domineering statement matched her coalition’s morale.

The People had never launched a successful expedition to Celestial Palace in the past due to the river. Thus, even if they die in battle today, it would still be something worthy of pride.

“We admire your determination and confidence, Fellow Daoist.” Heaven Burial replied. His very presence commanded respect.

He stared at the invading army and said: “But I’m afraid the outcome will be rather unfavorable for you all, death.”

“Hahaha, we’ll see about that.” Immortal Emperor Chi Ye laughed.

“We are blessed by a heavenly treasure and cannot be killed. That’s more than enough to crush you.” Light-dragon said.

This caused The People’s forces to stare enviously at the crystal palace and the rays emanating from it.

Although Light-dragon and his allies couldn’t fully grasp the treasure’s power, just this minor aspect was enough to be unbeatable. Moreover, the proximity boosted its effectiveness.

“You’re not the only ones blessed today.” Calamity retorted.

“Victory is within grasp!” His allies were filled with high morale and unstoppable momentum.

“I never thought about leaving this place alive after choosing to cross the river. Either Celestial Court goes down or my head will touch the ground.” Halo Conqueror declared.

“Indeed.” Immortal Emperor Chen Xue felt the same way.

They believed this was their only opportunity to contribute effectively to the eternal war.

“How courageous, we will entertain you!” Light-dragon shouted.

“To death!” Both sides roared.

“To formation!” Demon and the emperors created arrays first, paving the way for weaker combatants.

“March, kill them!” Light-dragon ordered.

Everyone roared furiously and rushed to the battlefield.
