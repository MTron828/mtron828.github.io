Chapter 5363: Once The Lord Of The Three Continents

Jue Xian’er avoided the battlefields and utilized her chain to reach the dreamwater, wanting to flee with it posthaste.

She had no intention of fighting the other combatants because it would be a four-on-one situation. Although her chain was strong, she wouldn’t be able to block attacks from all directions.

Alas, the others reacted swiftly, seemingly having been keeping an eye on the dreamwater despite fighting ferociously.

The moment she pulled the dreamwater away from the tenth bud, they would undoubtedly launch their assault.

“Buzz.” However, another cultivator appeared with lightning speed.

No one could see how he got there but he bypassed all the continents and appeared on the tenth budding leaf. 

He flicked the chain, causing it to uncoil around the dreamwater before moving back like a snake that had just been hit by a stick.

Jue Xian’er gathered her power and empowered the chain. Alas, she still staggered backward from the impact.

Everyone couldn’t believe their own eyes. They knew the reputation of her Immortal Piercer yet she was forced back by a single flick?

All eyes turned toward the pinnacle. They saw a man adorned with a purple robe, looking as if he was time itself.

The temporal affinity didn’t lord over him. Although he had a regular stature, he was always the center of attention.

Eternal would be the first word that comes to mind after seeing him. Although he wasn’t handsome, others couldn’t help appreciating his appearance. 

The most handsome men in the world seemed to be lacking something compared to him - perhaps a certain charm or charisma.

The former possessed a superficial appearance, unable to match the man’s charm. Moreover, bags of skin would wither with time. The same couldn’t be said about him.

He seemed to be on a whole different level compared to the current combatants and Jue Xian’er.

“Eternal Conqueror!” Someone shouted his title.

“That’s Eternal Conqueror?” Everyone became emotional because it carried quite a lot of weight in both the lower and upper continents.

There had been numerous conquerors and dao lords but he stood out among them. He came from Primal Dao, eventually managing to become the highest lord of the lower continents.

During his prime, orders from the four alliances and even Celestial Court were meaningless. Only his words were final.

Celestial Court wanted to send emissaries down to the lower continents but he didn’t permit them to do so.

After ascending to the upper continents, he was still an apex existence. According to the legends, he possessed an immortal bloodline with untold power.

In fact, he was eligible to enter the immortal continent back during his prime in the lower continents. Celestial Court had extended an invitation to him but he chose to stay in the upper continents until now, preferring to be in the illusory realms.

Since he came from Primal, he should be on the side of The People. Alas, many regretted his choice of siding with The Race instead.

“Why did Eternal Conqueror join Heaven Alliance?” A junior quietly asked.

“I am unsure, but I believe he might be in Divine Alliance, not Heaven Alliance. People do say that he has a good relationship with Supreme.” The senior answered.

“They are close indeed, I believe they had sparred numerous times and appreciated each other’s knowledge.” A dragon lord nearby joined the conversation: “Nonetheless, he might be in Divine Alliance because he owes an old conqueror there a favor. I don’t know how true this is.”

Eternal Conqueror himself never stated his affiliation. Nonetheless, others speculated that he was a part of Divine Alliance due to his previous actions.

Top dragon lords and conquerors believed that he was repaying a favor to someone in Divine Alliance. After all, he was someone who had fearlessly resisted Celestial Court before. Fear was not the reason why he switched sides.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Cultivators of his level normally kept their promises. For example, although Immortal Pagoda Conqueror was a pillar of Heaven Alliance, he still helped Alchemy Dao in order to repay the debt.
