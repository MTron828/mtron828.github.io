Chapter 3687: Omni Carapace

Because of the historical precedence, some students thought that it was impossible to actually learn the technique.

Today, Li Qiye performed the imperceptible technique before the crowd.

“I don’t think there’s a weirder method, using a saber for a sword technique.” One expert murmured, feeling a bit lost.

The technique itself was strange enough along with the resulting phenomena. Not to mention ordinary experts, even the top swordsmen present had no idea.

“The next move will pierce your right chest.” Li Qiye swung his saber smoothly to get rid of the blood drop.

The crowd no longer had any taunt or jeer to throw at him. They thought that he was overestimating himself going against the two geniuses with that saber. Now, his weapon no longer mattered, whether it be this average blade or an ultimate sword.

Just his words alone froze them in their tracks, making it harder to breathe. They didn’t think that he was arrogant for bringing up the three moves earlier after the first exchange. Their attitude and belief completely shifted as a result.

Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan felt the same way. At first, they thought that he was blatantly insulting them by allowing them to struggle until three moves. Now, trepidation and fear showed up in their mind.

Fear! This was a new emotion to them. They thought that death was still far away. No one dared to kill them in the first place.

Alas, they suddenly felt a shadow looming over them, perhaps that of a death god. Though they have rubbed ointment on the wound, pain jolted them after hearing his words.

“Next move, start.” Li Qiye smiled and coolly waved his saber before pointing at the two.

No one dared to look down on his stance right now as they watched with bated breath. The duo had a serious expression as well.

“A new technique, perhaps?” The spectators suddenly became excited, ready for the next grand display from Li Qiye.

“Maybe the supreme art from Duality Master? He saw all the top merit laws at the peak back then.” One student suggested.

“Yes, you’re right, he did look through them.” Another recalled what happened that day. People actually made fun of him too for saying that he understood Duality Master’s legacy.

Perhaps he was really telling the truth but they refused to believe him.

“No, I hope he does Sword Point again.” A swordsman said. Other sword dao users hoped for the same thing, especially the ancestors who have spent too long on this path. They wanted to see some clues for comprehension.

Previously, the two looked bloodthirsty due to their confidence. Now, this momentum was no longer there.

They stared at each other and finally came up with another new plan.

“Activate!” Zhang Yunzhi summoned a treasure and put it on.

This was an iron robe seemingly created from a tornado. Explosions detonated after he put it on. A terrible storm suddenly manifested and ravaged the nearby area. He became the son of the storm, capable of wielding this destructive power.

The crowd hurriedly retreated in order to not get pulled in.

“Omni Carapace, the renowned treasure of the Zhang.” An expert recognized the artifact.

It was a magical defensive tool. While using it, no one would be able to get close. Any attacker would be blown flying by the tornado regardless of the angle of approach, hence its name.

Li Xiangquan took out a bottle and slightly tilted it, releasing a monstrous tsunami. The blue water drowned out the sky along with its user. He then disappeared into this ocean. No one could see the end of this ocean or his position.

“Tidecaller Bottle.” An elder saw: “This is the real power of a big clan. These juniors have such powerful treasures in their possession. In any other sect, only the elders would have them.”

Tidercaller was created by a powerful Heavenly Sovereign. Most youths had no chance of wielding an artifact of this level. This was a showing of the Li’s resources.

“A defensive and an evasive one.” The spectators exchanged glances after seeing this.

This time, the duo abandoned offense and focused on defense. They clearly lost confidence after that last attempt and chose the safest route.

“They’re afraid.” One expert could read their mind.

“No, this is just a different strategy.” One student who was a fan of the two immediately barked back. Alas, his words lacked confidence.

“We’re ready for your attack.” Li Xiangquan’s voice echoed from the ocean.

This was indeed a high-level method. One would find it difficult to find him in this ocean, let alone attacking the right position.

Attention shifted back to Li Qiye. Everyone awaited his next move.

Li Xiangquan had an ocean as a separating force. Zhang Yunzhi’s style was more direct; his robe could stop all offenses within a thousand-mile radius.

“Can one move take down the carapace and the bottle?” A cultivator asked.

“These two treasures are very impressive.” An aware expert answered: “They came from mighty Heavenly Sovereigns. This won’t be easy.”

“Don’t be so sure.” A peer replied: “This is Li Qiye we’re talking about. Others can’t but he’s an exception.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

No one could refute this after personally witnessing the devilish nature of Li Qiye during this duel.
