Silver Secret Legion marched with the speed of lightning and made it back to the court within one day.

Li Qiye stepped into War Saint Dynasty. Its majestic appearance earned a smile from him.

War Saint Dynasty was in charge of Nine Secrets. It had forts everywhere in the system; its main court was located in Skywrap Mountain.

Skywrap was both the name of a mountain and the mountain range around it. There were plenty of tall peaks in this area, some towered to the clouds.

However, these peaks were insignificant compared to the main mountain with the name Skywrap. Even the clouds only made it to the base of Skywrap; the stars only hovered near the ridge. The peak of Skywrap was up in the galaxy. Quite a shocking scene.

Any random stream pouring down looked like a river with roaring currents in the form of a massive dragon. Any tiny portion of the mountain encompassed rich thickets. Just a random boulder here could be carved into a city.

On top of the peak were numerous palaces. On the ridges were cities with millions of citizens. Skywrap Mountain alone seemed like its own world.

Numerous bridges crossed through the air from one mountain to another. Some spanned for more than ten thousand miles. The smaller mountains and peaks at the base also had their own cities. The entire place must have tens of millions of people, maybe even more.

With Skywrap Mountain at the center, all of the cities nearby were considered part of Skywrap City. Of course, this was more like a kingdom than a city.

Nevertheless, this was only one part of War Saint Dynasty. Just looking at this place alone gave a good idea about the dynasty’s incredible scale; same with Nine Secrets System.

After all, one of the three behemoths of Imperial naturally possessed numerous territories.

The progenitor of this system was obviously Nine Secrets. The system was conveniently named after this person. No one knew the progenitor’s true name and identity.

People only knew that Nine Secrets’ master was Bao Pu, nothing else.

Bao Pu was the first progenitor in the written history of Three Immortals. As one of Bao Pu’s disciples, Nine Secrets started the system a very long time ago.

Because of this, few records about Nine Secrets existed, only a few words here and there in the ancient scrolls. Despite a lack of information, no one should question Nine Secrets System’s power and resources.

After numerous eras, the system had its ups and downs but it still stood strong till the present.

Under the leadership of Lucidity, it once again reached the top of Imperial.

Though no one knew the golden age of Nine Secrets, they thought that its current state couldn’t be much inferior.

Outside of numerous clans and sects, it also had monsters like Waterfront Pavilion, Bingchi Clan, Calm Lotus Monastery, Myriad Formation Kingdom, and Godstep Sect.

These five great powers were stronger than numerous other systems in Imperial. As for War Saint, this dynasty was enjoying its prime.

This was why whenever people stepped into Skywrap, they could sense the prosperity and confidence in the air.

Li Qiye didn’t see Lucidity after reaching the imperial city. The servants have already made preparation for him without needing to be told.

He was actually placed in the eastern palace of the imperial city. In other words, the location traditionally presided by the crown prince - very prestigious.

Lucidity only had one daughter. However, after becoming a True Emperor last generation, she left for Immortal and hasn’t returned.

It meant that he no longer had a successor available, so Li Qiye’s current placement truly shocked others.

No one would dare to make this arrangement without permission from Lucidity. Doing so could result in a clan extermination.

At the same time, people didn’t gossip about it either due to Lucidity’s perfect grasp over the dynasty.

Li Qiye didn’t react at all just like before as if this place was just another inn. He remained nonchalant, unaware of the significance behind the eastern palace.

All eyes were on Skywrap Mountain after the return of the king. They wanted to know about his health but none dared to visit without permission.

On this night, Lucidity sent a messenger to summon Li Qiye. The guy walked over in a carefree manner as if this was his own place.

When they met again, Lucidity was in a worse state, needing far more energy to open his eyes.

“Do you like your place, little friend?” Lucidity revealed a gentle smile, quite rare for him.

He was certainly not a nice person, more of a ruthless and imperious tyrant - bloodthirsty, even. A kind smile was the last thing to be shown on his face. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Not bad.” Li Qiye smiled back, treating Lucidity like just another person.

“I hope you will find the accommodation acceptable.” Lucidity acted like a doting senior.

One would be scared out of their mind if they were to see this. Lucidity never showed such care for anyone outside of his daughter. But Li Qiye was only a stranger without any relation to him.

“I don’t have much time, and no children either.” Lucidity wasn’t one to waste words and got straight to the point: “The dynasty needs a ruler, so I have made up my mind. Will you be the crown prince?”

His servants were astounded after hearing this. Appointing a stranger that he had only met for one day as the crown prince? How illogical.

They wondered to themselves - was the illness getting to the king?

The only person unmoved by this development was Sun Lengying who stood unnoticed in the shadows.

“Crown prince? That would make you my dad then.” Li Qiye laughed in response, still rather indifferent to anything thrown at him ever since his arrival.

“Our meeting is fate, no need to worry about worldly customs.” Lucidity weakly waved his sleeve.

Li Qiye smiled: “Perhaps. Is it fun being the crown prince? I can do whatever I want?”

“Indeed, you can do whatever you want.” Lucidity seemed insane, forgoing his authority in order to make Li Qiye the crown prince.

Once again, he had only met this guy yesterday.

“A bit interesting, could be fun. Very well, I’ll be a crown prince.” Li Qiye revealed a wide smile.

“Good, go rest then.” Lucidity was running out of breath and needing to close his eyes.

“Alright.” Li Qiye casually responded and left, not bothering to bow or perform any ceremonial gesture towards the king.

The servants were slack-jawed by the lack of formality. This was the first time they’ve met someone so bizarre.

Becoming the crown prince of War Saint Dynasty? This meant gaining unlimited power and authority yet this guy didn’t react at all.

‘Could it be that this brat doesn’t know the significance behind the role in War Saint? Does he not know how much power he had just gotten?’ They thought.
