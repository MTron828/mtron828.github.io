Chapter 4438: What Is It?

He was indeed Peacock Monarch’s staunch supporter and played a large part in the guy’s success. He also gave implicit permission for Peacock’s ambition to compete against Lion’s Roar, hence his current embarrassment.

He laughed and tried to play down the situation: “What I wanted to do was to just compete, not oppose them or seize their territories…”

“Dragon is doing very well right now.” Nine-tailed God said: “But even when we had dao lords, Her Majesty alone was enough to deter us. This isn’t even taking into account their ancestors.”

The three demons took a deep breath. It seemed that Lion’s Roar hasn’t produced anyone worthwhile, not any genius on the same level as Peacock Monarch.

Alas, upon careful rumination, Lion’s Roar wouldn’t decline so easily. There was only one person Nine-tailed God would address as “Her Majesty”, the Supreme Monarch. As long as she was around, no one in the world could touch Lion’s Roar.

“We were foolish.” Ancient Treant started sweating, thinking that they were blind with confidence.

Some of them believed that given the current trends, they would eventually replace Lion’s Roar as the number one sect in the south. However, they also recognized how true this reminder was.

Even back when they had Divine Luan Dao Lord and Myriad Eyes Dao Lord, they still couldn’t overcome Lion’s Roar. Now, juniors like them wanted to win? This was utterly ridiculous like a mayfly trying to push down a tree.

“Go with the flow.” Nine-tailed God elaborated: “Otherwise, destruction is imminent.”

The three bowed and agreed with his guidance.

“Splash!” Meanwhile, the waves in the pond intensified continuously. Eventually, the water rushed upward, boiling and churning.

“Raa!” A deep roar from the bottom erupted thunderously. Even the deaf could hear this roar because it pierced the mind.

An ancient aura manifested into reality. The four demons found themselves to be in a primal land belonging to a great ruler. They were subjected to this being’s whims in spite of their power.

This made them shudder because just from this aura alone, they could tell how powerful this being used to be.

The water in the air turned into the image of a certain creature. It had characteristics of several animals - dog, tiger, serpent, dragon, phoenix… Nonetheless, this amalgamation looked just right and natural.

“Buzz.” Blinding rays made them close their eyes next.

They staggered backward as the radiance engulfed Li Qiye. A while later, the radiance and billowing aura disappeared.

They opened their eyes and saw an empty pond. Li Qiye wasn’t there either.

“...” They exchanged glances of astonishment. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“A unique dimension.” Nine-tailed God concluded that Li Qiye has entered a different dimension.

“Old Lion, did you get close to this back then?” Ancient Pheasant asked.

“No, I didn’t even get the waves, let alone a separate dimension.” Ancient Lion smiled wryly.

“This must be the most profound mystery of the pond.” Nine-tailed God said: “I didn’t get anywhere close during my meditation either.”

“What about Myriad Eyes Dao Lord?” Ancient Treant asked. The dao lord had come here during his youth and benefited greatly.

“No details about this, only that he had obtained a fortune.” Ancient Lion replied.

Because they had no idea where Li Qiye went, all they could do was wait patiently and watch the pond.

Li Qiye had indeed entered a different dimension - a place where the ground and the sky resembled crystal mirrors.

Others would be confused in this strange dimension. However, Li Qiye had a clear goal - a black spot on top of a crystal wall. This was a dao bone the size of a palm.

Remember, the walls were massive so it was rather difficult to spot a single black spot from a distance. This didn’t trouble Li Qiye.

It was black without any luster, seemingly a piece of bone that has been abandoned for a long time.

Once he activated his heavenly gaze, he saw countless runes embedded in this tiny bone. They contained the mantras of the grand dao. Each could take one straight to a dao mystery. Of course, doing so required impeccable comprehension.

They were immensely heavy as well. Perhaps this was the reason why the crystal walls were necessary - erected for the sole purpose of upholding the bone.

One thing he noted was a crack countless times thinner than a strand of hair. This was interesting due to the bone’s heavy and tough nature. Something had actually managed to damage it.
