Chapter 5255: Take This

Spectators witnessed the famous suppression technique failing after the first move. Li Qiye still managed to deliver a dangerous blow despite being contained within the conqueror’s domain.

“I can’t believe how frightening this treasure is.” A dragon lord shuddered.

If Suppression Conqueror couldn’t block this move, it meant that someone like Jadecure Conqueror would have been obliterated.

Killing Heaven’s Equal and the others was impressive but this took it to the next level.

“Still not giving up yet? Okay, let’s have you taste despair.” Li Qiye said with a smile since Suppression was still gazing at the fiery gauntlet.

Having said that, Li Qiye raised his hand and the metal giants outside the palace suddenly disassembled into exquisite pieces. Some were smaller than sand grains.

All of them surged toward the gauntlet with the force of a tsunami. They attached themselves perfectly to the gauntlet and started covering his whole arm without hindering movement.

It wasn’t strange in the cultivation world to see massive treasures changing size dramatically. However, the crowd was impressed by this due to the assembling method. The pieces were meticulously arranged, not just randomly attached.

“He can really activate the metal giants.” A dragon lord became emotional.

An ancient ancestor from the city said: “Activate? No, this is having complete control over them. He can do whatever he pleases.”

Resplendent Monarch and the other ancestors became overwhelmed with emotions and got on their knees again. It was an honor to witness the return of their emperor; he was definitely the one from the legends.

Keep in mind that even City Lord Zi Yan could only control the giants, not disassemble them on a whim.

“This is possible too?” Suppression took a deep breath. In his long years of research, he did figure out a thing or two regarding these metal giants.

However, to freely assemble them was beyond his imagination. He thought that he would just use them as a powerful legion just like City Lord Zi Yan. Now, it seemed that controlling them in that manner was only an elementary step.

“I heard Celestial Court coveted these giants back then too but couldn’t get to them.” Xiao Qingtian quietly said.

During Emperor War, a group of gods and emperors surrounded Imperial Attendant City in order to obtain these giants. Unfortunately for them, Armor Conqueror defended heroically until the arrival of his allies - Cleansing Incense Dynasty, Dao Alliance, and Imperial Alliance.

“Very well, I do want to learn the taste of despair.” Suppression still didn’t give up and summoned his weapon - a bronze staff that has been used extensively.

Of course, his weapon wouldn’t be just an ordinary staff.

“Chaos Staff.” Someone recognized it instantly due to its notoriety in the upper continents. It had killed numerous dragon lords and even a few conquerors previously. Thus, it also had an unofficial moniker - Emperor-beating Stick.

“Boom!” As the conqueror channeled his power into the weapon, it became resplendent and exuded golden imperial rays.

The staff became longer as if the entire world has been refined within. Just one smash contained an incalculable force from its weight.

“Made from chaos metal and refined by imperial flames. Its weight is immeasurable.” One spectator said.

“How does it compare to Sword Queen’s heavy sword?” Someone else became curious.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It can’t. Sword Queen is at the apex, that heavy sword is something else. Of course, when strictly talking about weight, this staff can be ranked second.” A big shot said.

“I’m not so sure about that. When talking about weight, Titanic Conqueror should be the heaviest due to her special physique. Next should be Sword Queen’s heavy sword but she doesn’t quite need it anymore. Now, this staff should be third in the upper continents.” A different cultivator interjected.

“Take this!” Meanwhile, Suppression Conqueror finally made his move, leaping into the air for a vertical swing. This had no technique or dao profundity - only pure force.

This was enough to create black holes along its path. Spectators couldn’t help but bellow in horror.
