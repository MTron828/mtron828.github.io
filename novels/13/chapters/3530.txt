Chapter 3531: Dragon-phoenix Commander

The mythical bird above was unique. Its long tail had a golden brilliance; its chest had special runic lines to form the character “Virtue” filled with a venerable dao aura.

Its five-colored feathers were resplendent, looking as beautiful as can be from a distance. It was abundantly clear that this bird was special, not inferior to the Silver-carapace Lin.

“That’s five-colored luan, right?” A spectator became startled. [1]

This luan had an extremely thick and pure bloodline, close to being a divine bird.

Two people were standing on its back - a peerless woman and an old man.

The latter had a human body and a chicken head with four eyes. These eyes were extraordinary, most likely one of a kind.

They looked like unmatched stars; each could see and illuminate Eight Desolaces. People didn’t dare to look straight at them even in their dormant state. They would feel their soul being drawn in.

The eyes seemed capable of killing anyone at a glance or even refining an entire world. The old man resembled a true master; each action could cause untold destruction.

One could faintly hear the roars of his plentiful vitality and power as if there was a true dragon hiding in there.

He was definitely a top ancient ancestor. Other cultivators would feel the urge to bow or even prostrate before him.

Strangely enough, he wore an out-of-place cloak with numerous colors.

This could make people burst out laughing if worn by someone else. No one dared to laugh at this old man due to his frightening eyes.

“Dragon-phoenix Maiden!” Everyone recognized the beauty standing next to him.

“What about him? Don’t, don’t tell me he’s that old ancient ancestor? The forefather of the maiden’s clan?” An ancestor took a deep breath and speculated after seeing the bird.

“You’re right, he is Dragon King Commander. I was lucky enough to see his portrait next to Dragon-phoenix Matriarch’s portrait at the valley.” A demon master said before kneeling on the ground. [2]

“Commander...” The demon then shouted with reverence.

“That’s Dragon King Commander?” Everyone was shocked, especially the demons.

This title struck the crowd just as hard as Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang.

“The younger brother of Dragon-phoenix Matriarch, a forefather of an ancient race.” Some demons were unbearably excited; a few were moved to tears.

Dragon King Commander’s clan was a great demon race with an old and noble bloodline. They haven’t shown up for a long time now.

As for the commander, he dominated his era long ago. According to one legend, he petrified a first-rate sect with a single glance.

Furthermore, some records indicated that he was from the same era as Yin Yang Gate. It’s just that his clan always kept a low-profile. Others would only talk about it in passing when the topic was Dragon Phoenix Valley.

That’s why he wasn’t as famous as Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang and Yin Yang Gate.

However, a few old ancestors knew that he was just as strong as Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang.

“Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang is here, Dragon King Commander too, is it all because of Li Qiye?” These two men were the most influential cultivators in the north now. People were shocked to see the two of them in the same place today. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“No way, Li Qiye can’t handle both of them.” One spectator said after noticing that the commander was staring straight at Li Qiye too.

Li Qiye could be the strongest genius in existence and that still wouldn’t be enough to take on two supremes at the same time.

“Seems like today is a good day.” Li Qiye let out a natural smile after seeing the commander: “Everyone’s here.”

The commander almost became hysterical but managed to stabilize his emotions. He then looked over at Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang.

“Bastard, what are you waiting for? Come out and greet His Excellency.” The commander shouted.

While the crowd tried to digest this statement, he rushed over to Li Qiye and got on his knees: “This little one never thought that I would be able to see you again, Your Excellency. I am moved to tears.” His four eyes were actually moist.

Dragon-phoenix Maiden who was standing next to him got on her knees as well. The crowd became stupefied.

“Shi Zhongtian greets you, Your Excellency.” The colossal golem outside of Ancestral also got on his knees. His massive frame made it look like a mountain range was collapsing.

“Shi Zhong, Zhongtian... he’s the great-great-grandson of Stone Monarch Dao Lord!” Another revelation took the crowd like a storm.

Very few people knew his origin, not even the disciples of Ancestral. Now, it turned out that he was Shi Zhongtian.

Most importantly, he also kneeled just like the commander.

“Chan Yang greets you, Your Excellency. I’ve never had the honor of meeting you before so I do not dare to be presumptuous and act familiar, please forgive me.” Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang got off the carriage and also kneeled before Li Qiye. His head touched the ground.

These three were absolutely the top cultivators in the north. All of them were showing absolute respect towards Li Qiye. Even a dao lord wouldn’t receive this level of ceremonious treatment.

Thus, everyone’s mouth was wide open. They have never seen such a shocking scene before.

Once they calmed down, they knew that it was time to prostrate as well.

“Greetings, Your Excellency!” The chant echoed across the nine heavens and ten earths.

No one knew the importance and significance behind “Your Excellency”. However, since these top dogs were doing so, they had to follow the trend. This was absolutely the right choice.

1. Luan is normally a weaker-bloodline bird compared to a phoenix. No direct translation here. I usually used mythical bird for it but that doesn’t work in this context

2. The word for commander took a while because it also means handsome. I tried to come up with another noun for this but it’s rather difficult. Confident side-characters usually use this word to describe themselves. Authors use it for comedic effects.
