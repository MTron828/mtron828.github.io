“Rumble!” The entire world seemed to be uprooted in this process.

A dao source was the foundation of a system, personally created by a progenitor. Inside were supreme measures left behind by the progenitor.

In other words, outside of the progenitors themselves, no one else would be able to move or lift the dao sources. A person capable of this would have enough power to destroy a mighty system, truly a force to be reckoned with.

Nothing was impossible for Li Qiye, so he managed to pull up this dao source out of the stone jar. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Return from whence you came, it is time for Stone Harmony’s awakening.” He said insipidly and slowly placed the dao source back into the river.

“Boom!” This inner world shook as a result. It seemed as if an immensely heavy object has just dropped on the ground.

In fact, all of Stone Harmony shook as well. Everyone heard a loud bang.

A while ago, the system resembled a ship out in the wide ocean without heavy supplies and as light as a feather. Such a system felt feeble and easily toppled.

Once the dao source was placed in the river and after the bang, the ship’s storage now had a boulder heavy enough for stabilization - allowing the ship to no longer be afraid of big waves and storms.

Next, the true water of the grand dao assimilated with the river water.

“Boom!” It spread at an unmatched pace with Li Qiye’s position at the center. Immortal rays shot out all over this internal system.

Meanwhile, the dao laws inside the source extended and made the whole source to be incomparably large - no longer able to be stored inside the jar.

It took the form of a pulsing maelstrom. Inside seemed to be gestating endless strength of the dao.

“Rumble!” The rotating maelstrom caused this internal world to be filled with true dao water and majestic life force.

Though the progenitor separated the outer and inner world, they were actually the same. Thus, the proliferation of this water also affected Stone Harmony. Tremors happened outside as if something mighty underground was coming up.

The system became resplendent with rays coming out of the ground. They illuminated every single inch of the land.

Next came the power of the grand dao. It didn’t take long before this massive system become filled with dao and life force.

“What... our dao source has awakened!” Wu Youzheng was the first to react.

“It’s ours... our dao source... our dao source!” The disciples reacted with shouts.

“Our system is saved! We’re saved!” They got on their knees with tears dripping down their cheeks.

Though they didn’t know what was going on, they could sense the existence of their dao source again and its various powers spreading across the realms. They started breathing in the extremely thick dao energy and exuberant life force.

“Young Noble...” Youzheng and Lin Yixue were also on their knees with tears. They told their fellow sect members to kowtow.

Other members of the system were left in the dark, but this group knew that this revitalization was due to Li Qiye.

Not only did he save them and the city, he even went ahead and save the entire system. How could the group not be grateful?

Those looking up inside Stone Harmony could see the sky turning bright. This arc of light began to infuse the system with various forces.

“Stone Harmony is saved, maybe it will rise again in the future.” One Eternal emotionally said after seeing this.

The system has been declining for numerous eras. Everyone thought that collapse is imminent. But now, the system started flourishing once more.

“Nothing is impossible for Fiercest. He didn’t only stop the ferocious waves but also brought it back from the brink of death.” One ancestor commented.

The impossible became possible when Fiercest was involved; even a withering system could be saved.

Li Qiye didn’t waste time at the river before returning to the jar to touch it.

It had a coarse and sandy texture, also cold to the touch. Strangely enough, this cold was actually quite pleasant and comforting.

He closed his eyes and continued to feel it, sensing a boundless vastness as a result...

Worlds and galaxies felt tiny in comparison.

“Naturally formed during the start of all, truly priceless.” He withdrew his hand and said.

He then took out the Three Immortals Tree. It was now growing on top of the black soil taken from the heavenly prison.

He poured the soil in the jar then inserted the tree - a perfect fit. This jar looked like a tree pot now, seemingly created specifically for the Three Immortals Tree.

In fact, this tree was indeed grown inside this pot and with this soil during the olden days.

“Buzz.” The stone jar lit up and changed its appearance, no longer possessing the ashen shade.

It turned into a primordial world while the tree was holding up Three Immortals World.

To put it simply, the jar was the source of the three worlds, the soil gave them nourishment, and the tree created everything else in the three worlds - granting them life force.

Possessing these three things made it seem as if he had the three worlds in his grasp.
