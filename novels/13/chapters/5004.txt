Chapter 5005: It’s Nice Being A Fool

The monk happily got up and took one look at Flame-eater Child before leaving.

“Amitabha, another good seed.” His sickness resurfaced again after seeing the youth.

He seemed more like a recruiter than a monk, always becoming excited whenever he saw someone “fated” to be with Buddhism.

“So what if he’s a good seed? Want to convert him too?” Li Qiye said.

“That’s the way of Buddhism, converting anyone who is fated to be with it.” The monk said, eager to try.

“Your avatar won’t be able to do it, you’ll be burned to a crisp before anything.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see…” The monk actually became more interested as if he must carry out the “destined fate”, especially when it was more difficult.

“I might not be able to do it but I believe in the power of Buddhism.” He stared at Flame-eater like a prowling lion.

The more serious he became, the more frightened the youths. A while ago, they would have considered being “connected to Buddhism” a great fortune. Now, they were scared of being involved with him.

“He’s not a Buddhist, fate doesn’t work here.” Li Qiye said: “Plus, there is no point. Your Land of Paradise is only dragging people down with it.” 

The monk gave up after hearing this. He placed his palms together disappointedly and bid farewell: “I’ll be taking my leave then.”

Once he was long gone, Ming Shi immediately commented: “I’m so scared of that monk right now, I don’t want anything to do with Buddhism anymore.”

Yunyun and Goldcrest nodded in agreement.

“Buddhism might not want you three even if you wish to join it. Don’t underestimate this monk, common people would love to be converted by him, it is a fortune indeed.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“And I don’t want it.” Ming Shi giggled and said: “I feel that Untethered is a great place to be, no, the best.”

“If he wishes to convert you, your sect will send you to him right away.” Li Qiye said.

Ming Shi got goosebumps because Li Qiye was right. If this big shot were to talk about her being connected to Buddhism by fate, the seniors in the sect would wish for her to join it.

“Then you’ll have to protect me, Young Noble.” She playfully hid behind him.

“Don’t worry, if he wanted to convert you, he would have done it at first sight.” Li Qiye chuckled.

She heaved a sigh of relief while patting her chest. Her optimistic and cheerful nature always made others smile.

At this point, Flame-eater Child finally woke up and opened his eyes, revealing endless cycles derivative within. Alas, this only lasted for a split second.

“I am not me!” He shouted at Li Qiye, confused.

The youths noticed something different about him but couldn’t come up with any specific. It seemed as if he gained enough clarity to realize his lack of clarity.

“It depends on what version you’re referring to.” Li Qiye said.

The child who never reacted to outside stimuli seemed to be thinking about Li Qiye’s comment.

“What kind of person am I then?” He asked.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“The question is, who do you want to be? The current you, the past, or the future?” Li Qiye said with a serious tone.

This caused the boy to contemplate in silence again.

“What was he like in the past?” Ming Shi whispered, wondering if he had a happy past or a traumatic one.

Li Qiye didn’t answer and gave the boy time to think.

After a while, he asked: “Which is the real me?”

“The one you want to be.” Li Qiye answered.

“I want to be that one.” He still looked a bit confused but still gave an answer: “Can I do it?”

Li Qiye sighed and said: “Yes, it is possible. I suppose this is fate at work again. Since I have taken your god source, I shall return a fortune upon you.”

His expression became serious as he continued: “Remember, do not regret your decision. There is a price for everything regardless of who you become.”

“A price for everything…” The boy repeated.

“Young Noble, is there a worse situation for him right now? He’s already slow-witted, no one wants to stay this way.” Ming Shi couldn’t help but interject.

“What’s wrong with being a fool?” Li Qiye asked.

She took a second before responding: “No one wants to be foolish and unaware of the world around them.”

“What’s the point of being aware? Will the pain go away? The fear? The sense of helplessness?” Li Qiye elaborated: “A fool views all things as equal. For example, there is no difference between you or that monk just now. Life and death are also the same. As the saying goes, heaven and earth are not kind, they treat all things as straw dogs. In this case, are you a fool or are you the ruler of the world?”

Ming Shi and Goldcrest took their time digesting this information. Yunyun, in particular, became emotional.

Her experience was different from theirs. As the successor of The Alliance and potentially Primal in the future, others viewed her as a prestigious cultivator. Alas, she was truly struggling, unable to handle the weight and responsibility on her shoulders. She could collapse at any second from the pressure.

To everyone else, she was a beautiful successor of a great lineage. In reality, she struggled like an ant, constantly trying to just keep up.

“Heaven and earth are not kind, they treat all things as straw dogs.” She murmured: “The dao is emotionless yet its practitioners are filled with emotions.”

“Indeed, you are one step in the door now and will become exceptional.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly and extended his finger to tap her forehead.

“Pop!” The sounds of the grand dao echoed in her mind. The chanting morphed her dao foundation into something different.

She trembled and fell to the ground, entering a deep state of enlightenment.

“Big Sis Yunyun is so gifted, able to learn the dao right now.” Ming Shi praised.

Goldcrest felt the same way, realizing that she had just obtained a great fortune. Alas, he lacked the same opportunity and talent.

“This is due to her identity and status, you two are different and won’t be able to grasp this fortune.” Li Qiye said.

The two nodded in agreement.

“I want to look back.” Flame-eater Child finished making a decision as well.

“Looking back will change everything in the future, think this over carefully.” Li Qiye patiently said.

“I want to look back.” Flame-eater nodded and said firmly.

Ming Shi and Goldcrest, at this point, realized that Flame-eater was not a fool. His sixth sense was indeed sealed just as Li Qiye had said.
