Chapter 5607: Who Is He?

In an endless expanse surrounded by dao walls and spatial dimensions far from the reach of men, someone awaited Li Qiye.0

This location was untraceable, concealed by unimaginable methods. No one could find it outside of pre-selected visitors with access to certain traveling methods.0

“That was a big commotion, they are certainly alarmed.” The person commented.0

“They already knew the moment I entered the six continents. I’m sure my return to the mortal world was expected.” Li Qiye sat down and smiled.0

“So will they hide or fight fiercely?” The person asked.0

“Most likely the former because this is my epoch.” Li Qiye said.0

“I’m afraid that they have reconciled at this point.” The person said with a serious tone.0

Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “That’s not a bad thing.”0

“Hard to say.” The person said.0

“No, I’m sure that it is a good thing. Reconciliation means an upward slope toward an alliance. That’s good because they have more power and confidence.” Li Qiye said.0

“That is true.” The person said while watching spatial coordinates drift endlessly.0Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“This was inevitable when the epoch changed, the two branches of Celestial Court will become one instead of diverging with their own plan.” Li Qiye said.0

“I haven’t seen it myself, it’s just speculation.” The person shook their head.0

“No need to see, the answer will be revealed in time, and it won’t take long.” Li Qiye smiled.0

“Because of your arrival?” The person asked.0

“Yes, because how long can you keep the burden going?” Li Qiye said while gazing at his back.0

“The price was not insignificant.” The person smiled wryly.1

“Everything comes with a price, the only reason why they believed. Would you have believed in their shoes?” Li Qiye asked.14

“Right.” The person let out a soft sigh.0

“Just getting a bite is not enough, it has to be firmly hooked to make everything simpler. Otherwise, there is a risk of slipping away and all will be in vain.” Li Qiye continued.0

“There is more work to be done.” The person said seriously.0

“It won’t be too bad, just ignite a spark and when the fire catches and spreads, it’ll be manageable for us.” Li Qiye smiled while staring at space.0

“How do we strengthen the spark?” The person asked.0

“It’s rather simple, remember Celestial Court’s unknown visitor?” Li Qiye stretched lazily and said.0

“Already killed though.” The person was surprised to hear this.0

“They didn’t divulge all the secrets to you all, just matters of the distant past.” Li Qiye said.6

“Hmm…” The person mused and said: “From all the clues, the visitor acted as the mediator and both sides agreed.”0

“Why did they agree, was it simple because the visitor was from above? That’s not enough to earn the skeptical geezers’ trust.” Li Qiye said.0

“Do you mean… that they knew each other?” The person speculated.0

“More than that.” Li Qiye said: “The world can’t imagine the reason behind this.”0

“Where did the visitor come from?” The person tensed up, realizing that something was amiss regarding the issue.0

Li Qiye’s eyes seemed to be following a particular set of coordinates. After a while, he said: “The question is not where but who.”0

“Who?” The person fell into contemplation.0

“It’s fascinating.” Li Qiye said: “Potentially someone who was deceased.”0

“Deceased.” The person carefully discerned and unraveled the clues. Due to existing knowledge and insight, a new concept popped up.0

“Impossible.” The person blurted.0

“Why is that?” Li Qiye asked.0

“Just a matter of logic, they do not have the same goal or dao, this is putting it lightly. There is an irreconcilable enmity.” The person said.0

“Don’t be so sure. Look at Purewood’s decisions despite knowing certain things very clearly. Why was he missing for so long but in the end, which side did he pick?” Li Qiye shook his head.0

“Well…” The person took their time before answering: “Purewood always had his standpoint and conflicts.” 0

“In reality, you know that Purewood understood this before you.” Li Qiye responded: “He has his aspirations and ideas, not necessarily wanting to be on our side. His loyalty lies with his respective epoch.”0

“But it’s no longer his epoch…” The person’s eyes narrowed with a flickering flash.0

Li Qiye nodded: “He’s leaving himself some room for choice because he belongs to Trinity Epoch, the one he hopes will advance. Despite certain developments, he carries this hope with him.”0

“His ties are deep.” The person agreed.0

“It goes beyond that, he is different from us. His birthplace gave him faith and the strength to move forward, the fuel of his diligence and unwavering hope.” Li Qiye stared at the person and concluded: “He won’t stand with us.”0

“But he chose a side during Skysplitter.” The person said.0

“What made him do so? Why didn’t he show up during Immemorial Epoch?” Li Qiye chuckled.0

“Hmm…” The person had no response.0

“He kept being hopeful all along despite knowing better. Unfortunately, when he had to face it, the sliver of hope in his heart was shattered.” Li Qiye continued.0

“What happened?” The person asked.0

“Purewood must have met the unknown visitor, and it’s not just a casual meeting.” Li Qiye revealed.12

“What does he want to do?” The person murmured.0

“The sad part is that hope is hope, reality is reality. Hope isn’t all that useful and will extinguish.” Li Qiye said.1

“So he made his choice.” The person understood.0

“The choice depended on what he wanted to protect. His status and his faith? Then there was only one choice.” Li Qiye said.0

“So that’s why he picked Immortal Dao City.” The person said.4

“Only those with strong conviction make choices, the old geezers from Celestial Court know this.” Li Qiye said.0

“Their stance is clear, always The Bloodline.” The person said.0

“The ones who pick madmen often are mad themselves, they just don’t realize it.” Li Qiye smiled and stared at the horizon.
