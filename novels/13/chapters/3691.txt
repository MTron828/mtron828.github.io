Chapter 3692: Return

The news of the duo’s death caused quite a stir in Buddha Emperor Division then the rest of the holy ground.

“A rising storm, who will get pulled in?” One expert wondered.

Many talked about the issue in private, not daring to be too blatant in order to avoid needless trouble. After all, the Li and Zhang must be furious. They might try to vent by punishing others.

The ones most affected were the youths, especially students from Duality. Most were in disbelief for a long time after hearing the news, trembling with cold sweat.

The two belonged to the most brilliant group, albeit not the strongest. They also came from prestigious clans. All the students knew what they were capable of. Only a few were actually stronger than them. But now, they worked together yet still died to Li Qiye.

Prior to this, they thought nothing of Li Qiye. The only thing impressive about him was his unbridled tongue and undeserved confidence.

Some actually thought about teaching him a lesson so that he would stop insulting the academy. A junior like him shouldn’t be allowed to act in this manner.

Now, these students thought that it was a blessing that they didn’t go provoke him. Otherwise, they might be buried underground just like Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi.

On the other hand, many rushed towards Comprehension Peak again in order to take a look at Sword Point.

Normally, the place was relatively crowded already. Today, it was packed. Not even one drop of water can trickle through. Even some teachers came.

“This is Sword Point, the technique that defeated the two heroes.” One student said: “They couldn’t do a thing, as helpless as fish on a chopping board.”

“Are you exaggerating?” Another who didn’t witness the fight remained skeptical.

“I’m not exaggerating. In fact, I don’t think your imagination or my retelling are doing it justice.” The first student continued: “I’m not the only one who watched. Li Qiye used Sword Point only during the three exchanges. Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan employed their best offense and defensive abilities only to fail. Even the great treasure, Omni Carapace, was instantly broken...” The student meticulously repeated the sequences to his peers.

Students who were there nodded as confirmation. The others carefully listened and took a deep breath once the story was over. They exchanged glances.

“Sword Point is real and can be understood. We just didn’t do it right.” A powerful youth concluded.

Now, because of Li Qiye, everyone was going crazy again trying to learn Sword Point. Alas, the result was the same as before.

The teachers among them were exceedingly mighty and talented. They didn’t fare any better compared to the students.

“I don’t know about this.” A gifted student wavered after putting in so much effort.

On the other hand, a few teachers began to see a thing or two after listening to students recalling the battle.

“We’re not at that level. This isn’t a sword technique but rather, Sword Emperor’s dao.” An ancestor-level teacher elaborated: “Sword Emperor has to be the teacher in order for us to learn. Otherwise, in order to use it, the performer must be at the peak of the sword dao, maybe not as great as Sword Emperor but has to be at least a supreme.”

His peers agreed with this assessment. The problem became - how did Li Qiye learn it?

“The brat is too devilish, he must have many hidden secrets.” Another teacher smiled wryly.

The teachers knew their limit and gave up. Meanwhile, most students didn’t feel the same way and continued studying the legacy.

***

On the day after the battle, a great cavalry soared through the sky in the formation of a dragon. The clouds and winds dispersed along its path.

A militaristic aura overwhelmed the region. The leader was an old man with impressive divinity. He rode a fierce beast while adorned in full armor. His weapon of choice was a sky halberd, seemingly able to cut the celestials and split the earth. Lightning arced within his eyes in a frightening manner. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Rumble!” The group traveled in an unstoppable manner. Anyone who blocked their path would be swiftly dealt with. Their destination was the capital within Buddha Emperor Division.

“The Grand Commander is back!” The return of the Grand Commander shocked both Buddha Emperor and Metropolis Division.

He was the leader of the generals in Vajra, the clan master of the Li, and Li Xiangquan’s father.

“Isn’t he supervising the border?” One official became startled.

There have been skirmishes at the border so the Grand Commander personally went there for a quick victory. Thus, his sudden return came as a surprise.

“His son is dead, you think he would just sit there?” Another said.

The commander has returned in a grand manner. Everyone understood that it must have something to do with revenge.

Not long after, golden brilliance engulfed the sky of Metropolis. The presence of the dao manifested as if an immortal was arriving.

“Creak!” Numerous carriages could be seen with flying banners blotting out the sky. This fanfare could only be seen by an emperor patrolling his domain.

The unaware would think that this was the king of Vajra. However, upon looking at the symbol on the banners, the answer became obvious.

“The Grand Chancellor is back too.” A cultivator at the capital shouted.

The officials in Vajra became alarmed after seeing this since the Grand Chancellor spent the majority of his time presiding at the ancient court.

Vajra was currently in charge of the holy ground but the capital at Buddha Emperor Division didn’t belong to it.

The actual main branch of Vajra was located at Archaic Sun. As the leader of the officials, the Grand Chancellor usually presided at the court in Archaic Sun.

Now, he was coming to the capital but most importantly, in such a flashy fashion. He immediately came to see the king of Vajra first.

Rumor has it that he asked the king to give permission for him to kill Li Qiye, taking the guy’s head as an offering to his late son.

The truth remained unknown. Nonetheless, evidence pointed towards the two big shots wanting revenge.

“The Li and the Zhang are more than enough but if Vajra joins, Li Qiye will not have a grave. His clan might be brought down too.” One expert commented.
