Chapter 5366: Get Down Here

The power of Eternal’s immortal bloodline swept across the battlefield, amplified by the forces of anima.

It sent the four opponents flying and vomiting blood. They smashed into the ground; their internal organs and energies churned chaotically.

Spectators were amazed to see this sight. Jue Xian’er understood that even if she had gone all out with her Immortal Piercer, it wouldn’t have been enough to block his Eternity.

“The power of the source.” A big shot turned pale and commented.

Eternal had undoubtedly traveled farther on the path of anima than Ferocity. One was a beginner while the other a master.

“So strong.” Xiao Hu couldn’t believe it.

He had seen many powerful masters before but was still overwhelmed by Eternal’s unbeatable style.

“This is not due to the bloodline alone, he has trained with a heavenly scripture.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“A heavenly scripture?” Xiao Hu was astounded once more. His master studied one of the nine Finality Sword Dao but wasn’t this strong.

In reality, Hallowed Dao Lord was brilliant. Alas, contrary to Eternal’s bloodline, Hallowed’s bloodline was the thing holding him back.

At this time, Lightgrasp and the others got back up and stared at Eternal.

“Incredible, your Eternity activated with just a single thought.” Lightgrasp said with admiration.

“The path is endless, perhaps you all will surpass me one day.” Eternal said humbly despite the obvious insurmountable gap displayed during the challenge.

Nonetheless, he still gave others hope because he was right. The dao path was endless; who knows who would come out ahead in the future?

“I appreciate your fortuitous words, I will come to see you again once I possess anima.” Lightgrasp laughed and left the scene.

“He stole the words out of my mouth. See you later, Dao Brother.” Myriad Eye cupped his fist and left as well.

“Thank you for the lesson today.” Five-sun Dao Lord departed.

Ferocity stared at the dreamwater but realized that this was above his reach. He stomped his foot angrily and said: “This world is vast but we’ll meet again.”

Jue Xian’er also left the ninth leaf and didn’t say anything.

Eternal had shown everyone his strength. A solo fight was meaningless now; only characters such as All-things and Supreme had a chance.

“Seems like Eternal Conqueror is the final victor.” Xiao Hu sighed and said.

“You really want it?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I just want to do something for my master, I regret being so weak right now.” Xiao Hu smiled wryly, aware that he was just a worm looking up at a dragon.

Eternal cast his gaze at everyone before speaking: “I appreciate everyone for taking it easy on me, I do have a use for it.”

Having said that, he reached for the dreamwater - uncontested by anyone else. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Slow down now.” A leisurely voice interrupted him. The speaker seemed to be drowsy still.

Everyone looked over and saw that it was Li Qiye who was stretching. They started talking among themselves about this man who came out of nowhere.

Eternal stared at Li Qiye; his eyes suddenly became penetrating as if he wanted to see through Li Qiye.

After a second, he asked: “Are you interested, Sir?”

“Get down here, I do want it.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand.

This naturally astounded the crowd, especially those who didn’t know Li Qiye.

“Who the hell is this guy? Does he know what he’s doing?” A regional lord thought that Li Qiye was being foolish to challenge Eternal Conqueror. Did he not witness the fight earlier?

“He’s the emperor of Imperial Attendant City.” A dragon lord recognized him and said: “He killed Suppression Conqueror by controlling the machines there, it was incredible.”

“That’s him?” Other listeners were surprised to hear this.

“Hmm…” They began assessing his cultivation only to be disappointed - clearly insufficient when compared to dragon lords and conquerors.

“There is a big gap between Suppression and Eternal Conqueror. It doesn’t mean anything.” An ancestor said.

“Well, we don’t know if he had used all of his power.” A dragon lord responded.

Not to mention ancestor-level characters, even dragon lords and conquerors couldn’t speculate Li Qiye’s true peak. He seemed to be shrouded in a mysterious fog.

“Maybe the machines were the only reason for his victory.” Another lord speculated.

“Even then, it still shows how special he is because how many others were able to control them in history?” An ancient ancestor said softly.
