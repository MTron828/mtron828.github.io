Chapter 4318: Miss Ming

Everyone saw a young woman standing nearby. She wore a green dress and had just the right amount of makeup on. Her hair was tied to a bun and in spite of her maid uniform, she still looked exceptional and seemingly high status.

“Miss Ming.” The disciples of the ward and even the leader saluted her.

Everyone else immediately did the same despite not knowing who she was. Just the reaction from the ward’s members alone indicated her prestige.

“Miss Ming…” The leader hesitated: “I don’t think I have the authority to make this decision…”

Not even Deer King could assign a heaven room, let alone him. Remember, heaven rooms were currently reserved for elders and ancestors from the big sects.

Little Diamond could only stay in yellow rooms. In fact, giving them a black room would be the maximum. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Just do it.” Miss Ming didn’t bother explaining herself.

“Yes, this lowly one will arrange it.” The leader had no choice but to obey.

He was only an external disciple, nothing compared to this girl or her master. Offending them would be the end of him.

Moreover, this wasn’t his decision either so the blame wouldn’t fall on him.

“Heaven-level rooms…” Everyone became astounded. This included those from Little Diamond.

They all thought that Li Qiye’s arrogance and ignorance would result in his death. But now, this group actually got the heaven rooms?

“This doesn’t make any sense! On what ground does Little Diamond get this treatment?!” Eight Tiger Demon roared.

Most agreed with this since the heaven rooms represented status and power.

“We got a good sect master.” One Little Diamond disciple decided to vent.

They knew that Eight Tiger and Deer King were the ones behind this. Plus, the guy had attacked their sect before. There was no need to maintain a veil of friendliness.

“Your sect master?” Eight Tiger stared at Li Qiye with disdain.

He still wasn’t afraid because his sect still had powerful backers. There was no need for him to be threatened by a nameless junior.

“You’re not impressed with me?” Li Qiye lazily smiled.

Eight Tiger was annoyed by Li Qiye’s dismissive attitude. He snorted and said: “You were a nobody who suddenly became Little Diamond’s sect master. I heard that the previous master came across an ancient manual by chance but suddenly passed away afterward. Your sect didn’t let anyone know about this, how interesting.”

Elder Hu’s group became alarmed. They didn’t want anyone to know about their ancient immortal physique law.

“Eight Tiger Sect Master, words can’t be taken back. You have to take responsibility for your lies.” Elder Hu shouted.

“I take responsibility for what I’m saying. I was friends with your previous sect master. His death was untimely and unnatural and now, you have a new sect master that no one else knows about. Seems like a conspiracy to me.” Eight Tiger sneered.

“Malicious slander!” A junior from Little Diamond ignored seniority and shouted back.

“Did something like this happen?” The crowd discussed among themselves.

“Yes, I don’t think they announce their previous sect master’s passing.” A sect master quietly said.

It was indeed strange for Little Diamond to have a new sect master who was so young and unknown.

“Well, I’m more interested in the ancient manual.” One disciple brought this up.

“Most likely something amazing.” Her elder speculated.

“My clear conscience laughs at your accusation.” Eight Tiger was ready to go all the way: “If your previous sect master didn’t die of an indignant death, then why did you hide it from everyone? This should be a public case for everyone else to decide. We should judge whether your new sect master is legitimate or just a murderer.”

Others took a deep breath after hearing this. Though their sects were under the jurisdiction of Lion’s Roar, this behemoth never interfered with internal matters.

In this particular case, once external forces were to get involved in the form of a tribunal, Little Diamond would become helpless.

Some turned towards the members of the ward to see if they would interfere. Alas, they completely ignored the quarrel.

“So noisy.” Li Qiye yawned and said: “Shut your mouth before I wring your neck.”

“Sounds like you want to silence me to hide your crime.” Eight Tiger wasn’t afraid because the guy wouldn’t dare to kill him here.

There were many disciples from the ward present and he wasn’t weak either. He loudly continued: “How dare you threaten with violence in this place? Do you not respect Dragon…”

“Crack!” Li Qiye broke his neck before he could finish then decapitated him.

“Fuck!” Blood splashed those nearby, causing them to scream.

“?!!” Many were caught off guard by this development.

Eight Tiger’s eyes were wide open. He didn’t know what the hell happened during his last seconds.

“It’s a murder!” The crowd members shouted.

“How dare you?!” The leader of the ward unsheathed his weapon.

“Clank!” The other members did the same and surrounded Li Qiye.

The atmosphere became tense right away since killing others was forbidden at the ward.

Those from Little Diamond couldn’t believe it either. Everything happened so quickly during the decapitation.

“Shit…” Elder Hu murmured. Li Qiye had done it now.
