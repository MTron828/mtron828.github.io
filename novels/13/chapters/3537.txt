Chapter 3538: Take Leave

At this point, not just the basilisk but even the two girls stared at Li Qiye.

There were plenty of legends about Blessed Dao Lord. One of them told a story about his youth and his dao search. He came across an immortal and was taught by this great being.

It made the dao lord’s background and stories even more mystical. Some believed that he was only an ordinary youth before meeting this immortal.

They went on to say that the seven modified laws were passed down to him by the immortal. This made it easier for everyone else to cultivate.

“It’s not me.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The basilisk knew that it wasn’t Li Qiye after hearing this. He rubbed his chin and said: “A bit interesting. It’s as if they’re trying to be mysterious. Heh, true immortal? They don’t exist here.”

Others might not wonder about this so-called “true immortal”. However, the basilisk has been around Li Qiye in the past. Li Qiye had brought this up and he completely trusted Li Qiye, hence his skepticism.

There were two possibilities in his mind previously: that it was either Li Qiye or the guy was a fake. Of course, he has never seen this person before and didn’t know the location of the meeting between Blessed and this person.

On the other hand, the majority of future generations believed it. Blessed Dao Lord went on to create a sect and named it True Immortal.

“I wouldn’t mind a meeting if there’s a chance.” Li Qiye smiled.

His expression made the basilisk’s heart skip a beat. If Blessed was telling the truth, then Li Qiye would eventually meet this true immortal. It wouldn’t be a pretty meeting for the immortal.

“I wonder if it’s on purpose.” The basilisk had bold speculations because things seemed to change too much due to the changes of the seven laws.

The future generations haven’t seen the real ones but he did. Thus, he was aware of the disparity.

He didn’t dare to say that there was a nefarious plan behind this because cultivation certainly prospered afterward. It became easy for everyone to start training.

As time went on, the seven laws were abandoned for other forms of cultivation.

Therefore, the cultivation path started to diverge after the era of Blessed Dao Lord. They became more distant from the original dao start.

He wasn’t at the level where he had a good grasp of the myriad dao. However, he could still tell that there were minute changes. It wasn’t as connected as before.

In a sense, the ease of cultivation with the seven actually lowered its floor and power. Cultivators picked private merit laws instead. They began hiding these secrets and cultivation became segmented.

He had no comment on this particular direction. There was only one thing he was sure of - that the power of the grand dao weakened as a result.

Of course, he never said any of this publicly. He was a man of status now and needed to be responsible with his words.

“Anything is possible.” Li Qiye didn’t care for this and nonchalantly said: “People can make their own choices. There are pros and cons.”

“And you, Boss?” The basilisk asked.

“I serve as a spark for this world.” Li Qiye said: “However, this present can extinguish in the wind and rain. It requires fuel and future generations need to handle the supply.”

“I understand.” The basilisk nodded.

“Your Excellency, is it possible for me to cultivate the seven laws?” Shi Qingjian eventually took a deep breath and asked seriously.

Li Qiye glanced at her and chuckled: “You want to start over? It requires immense courage and determination. The grand dao isn’t easy and your expectations won’t always be met.”

Shi Qingjian was powerful enough already. Starting over meant paying a great price. Moreover, this path was full of unknowns.

She glanced over at Ye Lingyao before answering: “I want to experiment.”

“Let’s see if it’s the right one.” Li Qiye smiled.

Li Qiye began instructing the two girls in a brief session. He was able to easily explain profound issues. The two girls became immersed in the lesson.

He didn’t stay for long afterward and departed for the abandoned land.

He didn’t have thousands of disciples for the departure ceremony, only a top ancestor like Dragon King Commander. This was more than enough.

The city became silent and everyone made way from him on the street. The crowd stood with their head lowered, not daring to breathe loudly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Some didn’t have the courage to look straight at him; knees also buckled and they dropped to the ground. He still looked as ordinary as ever; the commander didn’t exude his aura either. Nonetheless, fear still permeated the atmosphere.

People only stopped being nervous after he was long gone. They stared in his direction and saw that he was heading to the deep south of northern West King.

It was a barren land filled with golden sand. One couldn’t see the end of it.

“Go back, can’t go with me forever.” Li Qiye smiled at the basilisk.

“Boss.” The basilisk got on his knees and said: “I think this will be our last meeting. My old bones will turn into dust soon enough and won’t be able to pay respect anymore.” He performed a full kowtow rite afterward.

Tears streamed down his cheeks. It wasn’t easy for people from his generation to live till now, let alone meeting someone else.

He believed that meeting Li Qiye again now was a miracle. There wouldn’t be a second one because he wouldn’t be able to live for that long. Plus, he didn’t need to live for that long. When Li Qiye returned once more, he would be nothing more than dirt underground.

“Take care.” Li Qiye sighed; his hardened heart felt some emotion once again: “May you have fortune and peace.”

“May you never stop on your path, Your Excellency.” He bowed again.

Ye Lingyao and Shi Qingjian standing in the back also prostrated.

“Goodbye, my old friend.” Li Qiye helped the basilisk up.

“Goodbye, Your Excellency.” More tears streamed down the basilisk’s cheeks.

Li Qiye smiled and turned around. He headed towards the yellow land without looking back.
