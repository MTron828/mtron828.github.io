Chapter 4728: Primal Fate Palace

Six Dao Monarch - the disciple of All-things Dao Lord, a peerless cultivator.

Everyone felt as if their grand dao was being suppressed despite the monarch’s current passiveness, reverting them back into helpless ants.

The hidden old monsters that have yet to show up didn’t dare to underestimate him. This was because his master was considered by many to be one of the ten greatest dao lords.

Six Dao Monarch had followed him to numerous battlefields. The two were unstoppable so his cultivation should be frightening as well.

“This battle is shaping up to be on the same level as Emperor Ye’s war.” One ancestor shuddered.

“I think so too, I wonder how many ancient ancestors from True Immortal are here, how many ace cards?” An undying ancestor said: “True Immortal went all out with seven ancient gods, thirteen dragons, sixty-seven godkings, eighty-nine paragons…”

Emperor Ye was yet to be a dao lord at this point and competed against the supreme genius of True Immortal. This started a shocking competition.

True Immortal enjoyed a golden age then. Numerous top masters tried to ambush Emperor Ye.

Today, they wished to have another dao lord and would flatten all opposition for him. Six Dao Monarch was already present, who else would come for the sake of this goal?

“The current True Immortal is no longer at its prime. Nonetheless, do not underestimate it.” A big shot whispered.

In reality, no one dared to look down on True Immortal. Just Six Dao Monarch alone made them tremble with fear.

“What about Three Thousand Dao? Will we see Enveloping Monarch or maybe even Dao Sanqian?” An expert calmed down and asked.

True Immortal was here to protect their young emperor. As for Shen Juntian, he seemed to be the most brilliant out of the conquerors. Would Three Thousand Dao stand with him as well?

Listeners became emotional whenever they heard the name “Dao Sanqian”. This was a being withstanding the withering of time. He had ample experience in this competition, having protected five dao lords before. He would have no problem facing Six Dao Monarch.

“This is going to be tough for Li Qiye.” Someone commented.

His opponents were the behemoths and their supreme cultivators.

“Fellow Daoist, as the saying goes, it is not over until it is.” The young emperor of True Immortal stared at Li Qiye with excitement: “I’m aware that I am not at your level but I still wish to face you for the sake of my dao heart.”

“As you wish.” Li Qiye said.

“I will be satisfied even after just experiencing one move alone with you.” He channeled his imperial aura, looking unbeatable and causing the crowd to gasp.

The competition had officially started and the five conquerors no longer had a reason to fight Li Qiye alone.

Nonetheless, as an heir and a supreme genius, he had ample pride and dignity. In the future, they will attack Li Qiye with full force but right now, he wished to duel Li Qiye alone even just for one move.

“I’ll stand by at the rear, Brother.” Five-sun King laughed.

“Very well!” The young emperor laughed as well and released his twelve palaces.

They stabilized the region and took charge with haste. Numerous visual phenomena appeared behind him - a great king descending in an azure made of the grand dao. This seemed to be a primordial world. Spectators felt as if their lives were under his control.

This froze them with shock because their grand dao was next, leaving them as feeble as mortals.

An innate sense of respect overwhelmed them since he became the symbol of prestige and regality. Everyone needed to prostrate before him.

“The Primal Fate Palaces…” A big shot was in awe.

This was his innate gift - a supreme talent. He was born with them.

Regular cultivators created palaces through cultivation. Those lucky enough to have palaces and visual phenomena at birth were destined for greatness.

Having palaces at birth was accompanied by one visual phenomenon. Mystical palaces at birth belonged to special cultivators that only show up once a generation or so. They possessed two phenomena.

As for primal palaces? Someone like the young emperor possessed four phenomena - something only seen once in an era.

“What an insane talent, perfect for cultivation.” Spectators became jealous. This was one of the greatest possible talents for cultivation.

It allowed him to wield dao lord weapons at the age of five, beat his martial uncles at the eight of eight, fight ancestors at ten, become an heir at fifteen, and sweep through all obstacles.

Who else could control a dao lord weapon at five? This was due to the power of the phenomena. Geniuses in the crowd lowered their head and sighed, accepting inferiority.

“Clank!” His weapon of choice was a spear. His aura erupted even more after holding the weapon, looking like a supreme king on the battlefield.

“Sagacity! He never lost with it before.” Someone murmured.

Those who have seen him in action with it before agreed with this comment.
