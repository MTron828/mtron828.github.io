Chapter 4267: Goodbye

For millions of years, Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel resided unopposed at the top of the continent. No one thought of offending them, let alone attacking their ancestral ground.

This all changed with Li Qiye commanding the heavenly swords against their foundation.

Though the majority of disciples escaped alive, they had to watch their ancestral ground being covered in dust and flames.

They knew that this spelled the end of their golden days. They would never be able to loom above all others henceforth.

The sects wouldn’t have a problem with losing ancient ancestors. After all, the foundation would allow them to produce more powerful cultivators in the future. Alas, their ancestral ground and foundation were annihilated now. There was no climbing out of this abyss.

They have been used to jades, extravagant outfits, and exquisite delicacies. Now, they became dogs without a master.

Many big shots activated their heavenly gaze to take a better look at the aftermath. Although they already knew the result, witnessing caused them to gasp audibly.

The ancestral ground from these two sects used to be heavily guarded and was considered a holy ground for cultivation. Everyone wanted a chance to enter - this would be the opportunity of a lifetime. Alas, only ruins were left of them.

“There’s no coming back from this.” One ancestor whispered.

“Yes, Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom and Nine-wheel Citadel will never dominate again.” A big shot said softly. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“It’s still better than sect destruction.” One ancient ancestor sentimentally said: “At least their descendants get to stay alive. They’ll only lose their riches, this is as good as one can ask for.”

Others remained quiet. Many of them wanted their sect to last forever in prosperity and authority. Unfortunately, living a borrowed life was still better than dying.

It was obvious that Li Qiye could have easily massacred every single member of the two sects. Nonetheless, he showed mercy while changing the landscape of Sword Continent.

“My heart grows softer with age, can’t be as merciless any longer.” Li Qiye commented.

No one dared to utter a word. They didn’t even dare to stare straight at him even when they felt nothing but respect and awe.

Terrifying became the most common emotion when dealing with Li Qiye since he had obliterated the top two sects of the continent.

His allies and supporters quietly congratulated themselves for making the right choice. As for the supporters of his opponents, they were kneeling on the ground. They didn’t dare to beg for mercy either and simply waited for his judgment.

“Come here.” Li Qiye waved at Daoist Peng.

The daoist scuttled over. He trembled while standing in front of Li Qiye because back in Hallowed, he had tried to recruit Li Qiye and treated the guy as a naive junior. It’s fortunate that Li Qiye wasn’t so petty.

“Take it. Back to where it belongs.” Li Qiye handed Myriad Era to the daoist.

The daoist didn’t expect this. Though Myriad Era was their heirloom, he didn’t have the power to take it back from Li Qiye. Plus, the guy was the only one who could seize it from that boulder.

He held Myriad Era and found the sword to be completely different. It was as if he was holding a grand dao in his palm.

“Thank you, Young Noble. Our sect will always remember your kindness today.” The daoist carefully put away the sword before kowtowing.

Others watched with envy. Li Qiye actually gave away the potential leader of the nine swords. This generosity was unmatched. Furthermore, they were jealous of the daoist’s incredible luck as well.

In this particular case, reason trumped over greed. No one dared to think about robbing this weak daoist.

Li Qiye publicly handed him the sword, meaning that to go against the daoist was to go against his wish. This might end in sect destruction.

“I leave Omniscient Home to you all.” Li Qiye then told Ning Zhu and Xu Yiyun.

“You’re leaving, Young Noble?” Ning Zhu quietly asked after hearing this command.

She already knew that this day would come since the continent was too small for a dragon like Li Qiye. Alas, it was happening too quickly.

“It’s about time.” He smiled.

“It was the greatest honor being able to follow you, Yong Noble.” Ning Zhu became sentimental.

Xu Yiyun bowed as well. She wasn’t as close to Li Qiye while Ning Zhu was considered a confidante.

“This wealth should go back to where it belongs.” He also handed the resources belonging to Omniscient Dao Lord to the two girls.

Crimsondeath Monarch and the others bowed; they have become a part of Omniscient Home.

“You’ve followed me for a long time, what is your wish?” He then asked Lu Qi. She was his first follower starting from Crimson Island.

“Nothing, being able to learn from you has been the greatest reward.” She respectfully bowed.

“Good answer.” He chuckled and touched her forehead with one finger, releasing a dao light to wash over her.

“Thank you, Young Noble.” She prostrated after receiving his blessing.

“Young Noble, when will I be able to follow you?” Everlasting Sword God Xi Yue came over and asked.

Others were silent. An overlord of the continent wanted to follow Li Qiye.

“The dao path is long, there will be a chance.” He said.
