Chapter 5292: I Am Me

“I’m serious, no more fusion talk.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Are you sure?” The godchild stared at him with suspicion.

“I can’t force you to do what you don’t want to do.” Li Qiye accepted defeat.

“Who knows?” The godchild had the word “doubt” written on his face

“Am I such a bad man? I’ve always been true to my words, no?” Li Qiye smiled wryly.

“Is that why you were chased from east to west?” The godchild said.

“Oh, this matter? That wasn’t my fault and your brilliant daughter has her own thoughts. I was merely a witness.” Li Qiye said.

“Bah, we were merciful for not chopping your crow head off back then.” The godchild said with disdain.

“I know you are joking because both of us know that her leaving was inevitable whether I was there or otherwise.” Li Qiye said: “Deep down, you know that my appearance didn’t affect things.”

“Hard to say, crows are bad luck. Maybe working alone would have been more auspicious and successful.” The godchild said.

“That’s what family is, working together despite negative superstitions.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Watch your mouth, we are not family!” The godchild jumped back and kept a distance from Li Qiye.

“One day you will have to agree because I’m sincere in this matter, don’t you think?” Li Qiye said.

“Save this for the future. At the very least, the current me wants nothing to do with you, unlucky crow!” The godchild said with disdain.

“Alright, no need to get so worked up. I’m just traveling around to check out the past on top of catching up with the people I care about.” Li Qiye said.

“No thanks.” The godchild patted his robe as if trying to wipe away bad luck: “But if we really want to bring it up, then it’s your fault for not disciplining them well.”

“How is it my fault?” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Assassination is fine but only when successful. They tried and only ended up with a mess.” The man said.

“You can’t blame them for that. Even you might not have been able to do it.” Li Qiye said.

“True, and I was careless too. This outsider’s dao was unlike anything I’ve seen.” The godchild admitted.

‘Because it’s not from your epoch. In fact, it shouldn’t appear in this world at all, yet it still did.” Li Qiye said.

“Perhaps Celestial Court came up with something.” The godchild said.

“I don’t know about that, but the outsider came for a reason and certainly left behind ace cards to minimize the risk.” Li Qiye said.

“We couldn’t investigate this matter fully. Your disciples were rather ambitious, challenging and attacking everything too quickly. If you want to know, you will have to put in more effort.” The godchild said.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“And that is why I’m back. This is my epoch so whoever they are, they will need to be obedient or I’ll turn them into fertilizer.” Li Qiye declared with a cold gleam flickering in his eyes.

“I’m no stranger to your merciless means, nothing good will come from this.” The godchild said.

“Well, my people will come out okay. Those who are smart know which side to pick.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

The godchild didn’t bother to look at him, still focusing on the sky.

“You all have shouldered so much in the past and I’m here to resolve all the problems.” Li Qiye said.

“Anything but the fusion.” The godchild asserted.

“You’re tying my hands here.” Li Qiye rubbed his chin.

“Well, find a way or stop calling yourself an epoch lord if you can’t deal with something so trivial. It’s embarrassing.” The godchild said.

“It’s not that I can’t do it, it just goes against my principle and it is not the perfect solution.” Li Qiye said: “But I respect your wishes. All of you are independent now and it is not up to an outsider like me.”

“Since when are you so understanding?” The godchild asked.

“I’ve always been this way with you because we’re family.” Li Qiye joked again.

“The dark crow I know was definitely a control freak, always wanting every step to go the way you want.” The godchild said.

“Sigh, that wasn’t the case at all.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Why are you actually here? If you want to move things along, just go directly to him.” The godchild said.

“You brothers haven’t seen each other since the separation. I’m here to arrange a meeting, nothing more.” Li Qiye said.

“No way, I will not fall for your trap.” The godchild strongly refused.

“Don’t worry, I am not forcing you to do anything you don’t want to do.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“That’s not the first time I’ve heard this. I should have just killed you back then.” The godchild said.

“Let’s not dwell on the past, we’re adults now.” Li Qiye smiled wryly.

“I will never meet them, I don’t know what tricks you have up your sleeve for the actual process but your intention is as clear as day.” The godchild snorted.
