Chapter 5853: The Mortal Coil And I

“A tribulation!” Spectators around the mirror were shocked.

When the five overlords appeared, their pressure was unbearable. However, the heavenly power stemming from the high heaven was an entirely different story. Everyone had to run away from the tribulations, overlords included.

“!!!” The three immortals and the founder trembled in horror.

Tribulations never descended inside Elder Galaxy, a heavenly treasure. Therefore, they were safe from the high heaven’s wrath until now.

“Boom!” It struck Derivation and didn’t dissipate, sticking to him like stagnant water.

As the tribulation bolts stacked up, the ignited heaven curse took them in and became more powerful.

“Ahh!” Meanwhile, Derivation still screamed in pain due to the curse. His body rotted and exploded.

However, it didn’t try to kill him but wanted to let him taste a fate worse than death.

“Ah, so you didn’t escape it. The curse has been inside you all alone.” Li Qiye commented.

Derivation had committed countless heinous crimes during his research to create a new life. The devious methods were unforgivable so the high heaven had sent down tribulations to destroy him.

His type of cultivation intelligence proved effective against the tribulations, using various ways to nullify them. Alas, due to his negative karma, a curse was built up within him.

He had no choice but to bury it deep inside his body, using an unprecedented method to seal it. Because of this, he never dared to leave Elder Galaxy. Of course, this applied to all of the overlords during Trinity Epoch.

Tribulations seemed to stop coming in the new epoch. Primal and the others could leave the treasure if they wanted to since only the strongest tribulations could take them down. The same couldn’t be said for Derivation due to his curse.

Now, he let the curse free and it immediately summoned a tribulation inside Elder Galaxy. This was the reason why they gave the founder Death Coffin instead of keeping it.

Elder Galaxy was special in that it could protect them, but other heavenly treasures increased the chance of a tribulation. This was doubly true for overlords who have performed blood refinement in the past.

Derivation felt as if he was being flayed by countless lightning blades, causing someone of his cultivation to scream.

“Activate!” The other four prepared well and activated Celestial Palace. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They channeled all of the power from Elder Galaxy to Derivation alone. The radiant palace filled Derivation’s broken body with light.

Although the treasure’s rays were dazzling, Derivation’s grotesque body and the rampaging curse overshadowed their beauty.

Now, Derivation had a monopoly on Elder Galaxy’s blessing so the pain greatly subsided. Nevertheless, more tribulation bolts descended in an apocalyptic fashion, continuing to fuse with the curse.

“Dark Crow, ready to die?!” Derivation shouted, having accumulated plenty of curse despite all of this happening in the blink of an eye.

He aimed this oceanic power toward Li Qiye, resulting in a frightening pulse capable of crushing the epoch.

“Protection Wish!” Li Qiye reverted into a defensive stance, stacking the mortal affinity in layers.

“Rumble!” The cursed pulse broke through one layer after another.

The curse activated on Li Qiye so lighting coursed around him, initiating another tribulation. The assault on two fronts took down the layers.

“The mortal coil and I!” Li Qiye summoned countless phenomena of mortal lives. Alas, they were shattered by the curse as well, haunting him like a shadow and couldn’t be erased.

It relentlessly tormented him, going as far as extinguishing his primordial rays. The internal tribulation erupted within him, causing blood and flesh to splatter.

“Damn!” Spectators behind the mirror became aghast.

“There is no escaping the heavenly curse.” The founder turned pale after seeing Li Qiye engulfed by lightning and explosions.
