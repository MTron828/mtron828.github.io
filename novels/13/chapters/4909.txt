Chapter 4910: Places That The Hammer Can’t Reach

The carriage sped through the night, completely surpassing time and space. Yunyun had no idea that this was happening.

She focused on the confusing conversation that seemed to be coming from two mortal villagers. However, they looked very serious while discussing these mundane matters.

“Why is your father so anxious all of a sudden given his patient personality? The farm crop isn’t ready for the harvest.” Li Qiye said.

“The weather is terrible now, not to mention the locust swarm. What a bad time we live in.” A’jiao complained.

“Your father can deal with the locusts with one wave.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s true, but the evil neighbor is quite a headache. A few things are out of control right now.” She said.

“Zhao Dachui is that annoying?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Lil Bro, it’s not like you don’t know.” She put on a charming expression and scared Yunyun again.

“I don’t know many things but there is one thing I’m sure of. Today will be Zhao Dachui, tomorrow might be Li Dachui. Your dad is the number one village boss, he doesn’t allow anyone else to usurp his authority. I don’t want to be hammered down.” Li Qiye said. [1]

“Where is your confidence?” She rolled her eyes: “Don’t you also want to smash Father? Then you’ll be the boss of the village. Don’t be afraid now, your ambition needs not to be afraid of a hammer.”

“I have no intention of becoming the village boss, although I do want to hit your dad.” Li Qiye said.

“Then you should be panicking right now. If Zhao Dachui hits Father first, it won’t ever be your turn. Since we’re family, I rather you hit him than Zhao Dachui. It would be far more poetic that way.”

“I’m absolutely confident in your dad.” Li Qiye said: “No other village brutes will be doing anything to him, I’m actually a target in the future.”

“Think again, he hasn’t tried to while this has always been your intention.” She said: “He has especially opened a path for just you because we’re family.” She disagreed.

“I don’t want to accept this sentiment.” Li Qiye said: “Your father has the hammer and looks around for nails. Since he hasn’t struck me yet, it just means that I, as a nail, am not stuck out enough.”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Don’t you see how fertile your little plot is?” She said cutely.

“Because the timing isn’t right. Your dad will definitely want to hammer me down in due time.” Li Qiye disagreed.

“Sigh, don’t be so extreme with your view. Father adores you, that’s why he sent me to find you repeatedly.” She said.

It was one thing when A’jiao didn’t act coquettishly. When she did, Yunyun felt her stomach churning and the content wanted to rush out.

“That’s where it is interesting to me. He is not trying to find me because of this Zhao Dachui. There must be a place where your dad’s hammer can’t reach.” Li Qiye guessed: “I know exactly how efficient he is, this must be special.”

“You’re overthinking it, Lil Bro.” A’jiao was unhappy: “Father is always the same, always merciful.”

“Merciful? Sure, when he views all living things as ceremonial straw dogs.” Li Qiye said.

“The same could be said about you, no?” A’jiao said.

Li Qiye stared into the night and eventually responded: “True, but I and your villainous father are different.”

“That’s why he has a good impression of you. As the saying goes - the father-in-law's gaze upon his son-in-law was like a bee to honey, the more he looked, the sweeter he found him.” A’jiao blushed bashfully.

“Ugh…” Yunyun couldn’t handle it anymore and puked. Fortunately, she puked outside the carriage.

The two completely ignored her and went on with their conversation.

“I’m flattered but this only work on a child.” Li Qiye said.

“You know full well what you’re doing, there is nothing to be worried about.” A’jiao said.

“I do, but since I’m the actual merciful person, don’t you know the saying, nice guys finish last?” Li Qiye joked.

“I agree, your merciful nature coincides with your perseverance thus far but, you don’t have to be on the losing end of things. Look, there are many that have gone just as far as you or even farther but where are they now? They couldn’t maintain this mindset.” Her tone became serious.

“Is this your opinion or your dad’s?” Li Qiye stared at her.

“Everyone has this view, it is an eternal truth, that those with a kind heart will be rewarded. In your case, you got to meet me.” She reverted back to being flirty.

By this point, Yunyun preferred to be facing Ascension Sacred Lord’s blade than to be looking at A’jiao’s bashful torture.

“Keep words to yourself, I want to see actual sincerity before negotiation.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Sure, but let me remind you that the times are changing. If the village fences break, it won’t be easy to fix.” She said.

“Right…” He murmured while stroking his chin.

“There is a solution though. As long as you agree, we can fix this to avoid further complications.” She went on.

“No, thank you.” Li Qiye didn’t bite.

1. Villagers’ names are usually silly. For example, Dachui just means big hammer, so Li Qiye is using that name as a joke ☜
