Chapter 5646: Ancient Battlefield

“Zzz…” Not a single evil entity could be seen in the destroyed sacs now.

“Ahh!” The monster screamed but was still pinned by the initial primordial ray, unable to break free.

“Boom!” Primordial light engulfed it and a dissolving process ensued.

Eventually, the monster crumbled, leaving behind four figures that were still pinned by the light in one place.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Sindragon and Thousand-hand focused their gaze and could see the four figures with their backs against each other, seemingly united as one.

They were matchless beauties judging by their figures. However, their faces were hidden by distinctive masks.

Their loose-fitting brocade robes couldn’t conceal their tall and voluptuous figures, the subtle undulating peaks and valleys.

The hideous monster was nowhere to be found, replaced by the four women after Li Qiye’s primordial light dispersed.

“Are they the four matrons in the legends?” Thousand-hand couldn’t help but ask. Her progenitor had told her many mysteries regarding the nine worlds.

After coming to the immortal continent, she heard rumors regarding Imperial Field and Grand Dao War.

The four women seemed to be in a state of hibernation or zen meditation. When Li Qiye removed the binding light, they flickered like candle flames on the verge of extinguishing.

“Buzz.” After a final noise, they turned into four faint glimmers, vanishing into the sky.

“Go.” Li Qiye didn’t give chase and told Skyshroud Emperor to leave instead.

“Boom!” They had no time to chat and leaped into the air, disappearing from sight.

Thousand-hand and Sindragon heaved a sigh of relief. They looked down and the ocean of blood along with black clouds were no longer there, replaced by a blue sky and beautiful waters. They could now see Thousand Emperor Island clearly from a distance.

As for Li Qiye, he kept his focus on a deeper region in the expanse.

He looked back and waved his hand: “You two may return, I am leaving for the ancient battlefield.”

The duo understood that this was the time to separate. They bowed in his direction and said: “Farewell, Sacred Teacher.”

Li Qiye took one step forward and crossed through space.

“Boom!” The hole created by him closed, and not even a trace remained.

“Back to Thousand Emperor then.” Thousand-hand let out a sigh while looking at the restored space before leaving with Sindragon.

The battlefield mentioned belonged to Grand Dao War, massive in size and divided into an inner and outer region.

Two fronts occurred at the same time. One included the empress and her allies fighting against the darkness.

At the same time, Celestial Court had issued a full-scale invasion as well. The remaining members of Imperial Field had no choice but to prepare against the incoming armies. Fortunately, Imperial Dao City also sent reinforcement.

Some said that Celestial Court attacked to help the gigantic hand from above, aiming to take down High Heaven Aegis. Others claimed that they merely wanted to take advantage of the situation, wanting to pillage the weakened Imperial Field.

The leaders of the defending force included South Emperor, Immortal Emperor Mu Tian, and Immortal Emperor Chi Ye.

They erected several defensive lines with the help of those from Immortal Dao City. In the end, not a single member of Celestial Court managed to reach the inner battlefield. Their valiant effort allowed the empress’ group to focus on killing the gigantic hand.

Few knew the exact details of the inner battlefield, only the outer one. Ultimately, Celestial Court had no choice but to withdraw while the empress seemed to have won her battle as well.

Top cultivators fell like flies during Grand Dao War. Corpses floated above the blood-stained ocean.

Imperial Field paid a heavy price to win the battle. South Emperor and the others no longer showed up afterward.

Rumor has it that they were either killed during the battle or succumbed to their grievous injuries at a later date.

Most estimated that Imperial Field lost more than half of their emperors and gods. As for the inner battle, all three great powers didn’t speak of the specific details.

Top cultivators refrained from discussing it. Was it because they didn’t participate and were unaware of the situation?

It could also be that the inner conflict was too brutal and they were unwilling to mention the details.

In any case, most key participants of Grand Dao War vanished without a trace. The wondrous creation, High Heaven Aegis, disappeared as well.

Future generations never had the privilege of seeing it in person. They only knew of its name and how crucial it was for the war effort.
