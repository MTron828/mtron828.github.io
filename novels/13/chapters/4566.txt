Chapter 4567: Dao Essence Ambrosia

“Ancestor, we are here to pay respect before you leave.” True Immortal Sect Master shouted.

Ethereal hymns echoed in the air as disciples of True Immortal appeared with banners. They prepared an official ceremony, wearing proper regalia and singing properly.

The crowd was moved by their effort. It truly looked like a goodbye party for an ancestor. Some got caught up in the moment and bowed to bid goodbye to Everlasting Monarch.

Unfortunately, the music and chant didn’t move the monarch at all.

“Prepare the offering for our ancestor.” The sect master ordered.

A formidable group walked out of the ceremonial unit. The leader was a gray-haired man holding a covered tray with both hands.

He made it to the front of the monarch and captured everyone’s attention. The members of True Immortal became nervous, especially the upper echelon since they were aware of the plan.

The old man got on one knee and raised the tray higher. He then removed the cloth cover and a blinding radiance took over.

It pulsed intermittently, just enough for the crowd to see tiny gemstones at first glance. Alas, it turned out that they were actually a type of food made from unknown materials.

Each piece was unique and seemed to be made from the grand dao. Inside were dao mysteries and runes.

Eventually, the initial radiance also contained a fragrance wafting in the air. Everyone took a deep breath and found themselves to be as light as air.

Their body started to float upward while they felt as comfortable as ever. At the same time, a dao resonation ensued as if they were inside a dao courtyard and listening to true immortals preaching their art. They got an illusion that they would ascend soon enough.

“What are they…?” The fragrance alone already had this effect, let alone actually eating them.

The crowd salivated, wanting nothing more than to stuff a handful in their mouth.

“I have no idea what it is, food for immortal?” A big shot said.

Nonetheless, even a fool could tell that the food was extremely precious and extraordinary.

“Dao Essence Ambrosia.” An ancestor that has close ties with True Immortal recognized it and whispered: “This is a priceless delicacy made from the light of the night star, marrow of a dragon horn, extracts of phoenix wings, and several dozen more rare materials.”

He paused for a moment before continuing: “Furthermore, the cooking process is exceedingly difficult. The cook must have both power and mastery over the grand dao. Thus, in the history of their sect, only a few are capable of making this dish. Rumor has it that Everlasting Monarch was the one who came up with this dish. It was also his favorite and he made it regularly for Blessed Dao Lord.”

Sure enough, the dish attracted Everlasting Monarch’s attention. He slowly turned around and stared at the tray then the members of True Immortal.

“They did it!” Spectators became startled.

A while ago, all groups failed with the exception of the Improper Four using the painting of a woman to distract Incineration Treant.

True Immortal came prepared as well with Everlasting Monarch’s favorite dish.

“Your descendant is under order to ask Venerable Ancestor for an item.” The sect master of True Immortal prostrated and said: “The progenitor decreed that the four treasures of the immortal are meant for filial descendants. Today, Venerable Ancestor will experience reincarnation and can’t bring external items with you. We beseech you to leave the item behind since this is the creed of the progenitor. Please take a look.”

Having said that, an ancestor of True Immortal opened a scroll.

“Boom!” People could see indelible runes left behind by a supreme monarch after a loud detonation.

The characters weren’t clear due to an oppressive divinity blinding them. Nonetheless, they could tell that Blessed Dao Lord personally wrote these characters. Being able to read it would grant someone a lifetime of benefits.

However, Everlasting Monarch didn’t react to the scroll at all. His focus was still on the dish.

“Why is the scroll not working?” This surprised the neutral spectators. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Everlasting Monarch was Blessed Dao Lord’s junior brother and they had a strong relationship. The activated scroll was akin to Blessed Dao Lord being here in person. Thus, Everlasting Monarch should have reacted, whether it be out of respect for a great dao lord or out of brotherly love.

The high-ranking members of True Immortal couldn’t understand this. They used the dish as bait and then the scroll from Blessed Dao Lord. This should have been enough.

“Does anyone know what’s going on?” One expert asked.

A big shot who has witnessed several events here said: “Everlasting Monarch is already dead. He had severed the past in order to enter the reincarnation cycle. He only remembers himself. Any external source capable of moving him must be something engraved deep in his heart.”

The sect master then gave the signal to the ancestors. The group then slowly approached Everlasting Monarch, forming a battle formation.

Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor stood in front of the monarch, seemingly wanting to stop all of his offensive power alone.

Decapitation Godmonarch stood to the left while Seven-seal True God stood to the right, ready to help seal their ancestor.

All the other ancestors and experts grouped up behind the monarch in order to cut off his retreat path.

“They want to use force.” Everyone understood what they were trying to do.
