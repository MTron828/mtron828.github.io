Chapter 5022: Divine Beast Tablet

Peacock Monarch - the commanding god of Feather - has yet to die. Alas, his god source has crumbled into six pieces.

“Screech!” The great bird’s screech echoed across the nine heavens. Numerous visual phenomena appeared and drew everyone in.

Spectators became afraid since they felt themselves being dragged inside and becoming one with the illusions. This power resembled the effect of a wondrous weapon.

The image of the peacock spread its wings and flew deeper into Demon. Its target was a towering tree that exude boundless light and grand dao.

The majority of dao consisted of the avian type. Thousands of birds flew around the tree and their auras could be sensed everywhere.

The actual living beasts and demons kneeled in that direction to show respect.

“Peacock Monarch is near death.” One demon said sentimentally.

That tree served as a curtain for the final moment of Peacock Monarch. He was about to pass away and return to Demon.

“Rumble!” Loud explosions came next before the sorrowful demons and beasts.

An ocean of dao power erupted with a great tablet inside. It had enough force to uphold the sky above Demon alone.

“Divine Beast Tablet!” The inhabitants of Demon naturally recognized it. Most prostrated since they respected it far more than the commanding gods.

This tablet was the source of the demon dao in this region. It was the reason why animals were able to turn into demons.

Normally, beasts were enlightened by a random master or had something special enough that a sect would take them in. As long as they had a heart yearning for something greater, the tablet would be there to guide them.

“Why is the tablet showing up now?” Ming Shi asked while staring at the great creation.

The emotional Goldcrest quietly replied: “For demons like us, as long as our heart yearns for the dao, a spiritual tablet will appear internally. But as for the actual tablet, this is my first time seeing it. It must be because everyone is mourning the monarch’s passing.”

Demon cultivators had their own tablet - a manifestation of the actual thing. Once they grew strong enough, they could finally see the great artifact.

In this case, their display of solidarity and love summoned the tablet.

“What are those runes?” Cultivators from the outside world took a careful look but didn’t understand anything.

Instead of a particular language, the surface of the tablet had strange marks. Some marks resembled the traces left by the claws of a swan, while others resembled the imprint of a tiger's paw. There were also marks that resemble earthworms crawling... Each mark was unique and extraordinary but most importantly - virtually indecipherable in terms of dao comprehension.

They were solely meant for the animals in the Ten Great Mountains, not outside cultivators.

As the inhabitants observed the tablet, the marks seemed to be coming back to life. Loud roars and movements could be hard.

Each spectator saw something different on the tablet - an interpretation of the dao unique to them alone.

“Is that the mark of a deity?” Yunyun asked.

Although she didn’t understand anything, she saw six special marks on the tablet. They exuded supreme power and divinity - the culmination from eras of worship.

“You’re right, each represents a deity spot.” Goldcrest said respectfully.

The founder gods have left an indelible mark on the Divine Beast Tablet. Five of them consisted of powerful demon gods gathering enough worship power to leave a unique mark on the tablet. The only exception was Mist; the seal carved by a sword user from the outside world.

Li Qiye activated his heavenly gaze and focused on Mist alone. It consisted of a few lines that resembled mist and fog. It felt as if this god was only playing around with his sword yet still managed to create a new deity spot.

The dragon lords also took advantage of this opportunity. This tablet was mystical and inscrutable to regular cultivators but they were the strongest in the lower continents. Observing the marks was beneficial to their cultivation.

“Calling it a supreme scripture might be more accurate than a tablet.” The gifted Jun Cuican could understand several mysteries in just a short time.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The others nodded in agreement since this was a library of sorts. Everyone saw a different “book” and “merit laws”.

This was the reason why the demon monarchs here followed different cultivation paths. Nonetheless, all had a chance of becoming rather powerful.

This made them wonder about the creator of this wonderful tablet.

“Perhaps this is the key to entering the divine nest.” Radiant Monarch speculated.

“You are very observant, Monarch. What you said just now has been a famous theory in Demon. I bet if you had been born in Demon, you might have become a founder god.” Golden Cicada had immense respect for Radiant Monarch.

Becoming a founder god was more prestigious than becoming a conqueror since there were only six of them. Only Demon Conqueror managed to accomplish both.
