Li Qiye didn’t flinch once while inside the sphere of fire due to a protective glow nullifying every single shot. Barrages continued to no avail, only managing to destroy the area around him.

In fact, people got the feeling that this was a rebirth via fire. The firepower not only failed to hurt him but also seemed to be increasing his strength by refining his constitution.

“That’s unreal.” Everyone became stunned.

“Who the hell is this guy? How can he stop this massive attack so easily?” Even the ancestors were astounded.

“Fire!” The barrage stopped for a second before another command was heard.

The small ships lit up in a blinding manner again and maximized their output. In this split second, all of them shot out a materialized ray with enough force to cut through time and space. These rays tore the area asunder while surging towards Li Qiye as the common target.

There was a lack of explosions and fire versus the previous barrage. However, these rays were far more terrifying.

Each ship has gathered all of its energy onto its respective beam, allowing the ray to sever anything. Powerful weapons and tough metals weren’t enough as a defensive measure.

“Buzz.” Temperature crazily surged like 100,000 concentrated suns. Because of this, everything started to melt.

The dao laws, worldly forces, and spatio-temporal affinities weren’t spared either. Everything became blurred, whether it be the blue azure or the earth below.

“That’s terrifying.” The horrified crowd was startled, thinking that they were next.

“I don’t think he can survive this time around because that ray is unreal. Eternals going all out still can’t stop it.” One expert stated.

One ancestor activated his heavenly gaze for a better look before shouting in horror: “Oh Lord!”

“What? His body is incinerated, even the true fate is done for?” Many came over to ask, thinking that the sight of Li Qiye’s death was too gruesome.

“He’s perfectly fine, it’s so strange.” The ancestor took a deep breath and said.

Other ancestors who were True Gods also opened their gazes. Sure enough, Li Qiye stood in the hottest area in a leisurely manner. Though these rays could burn and meld everything, they didn’t do a damn thing to him outside of lighting him up.

One could see a light emanating from him to stop the fast-shooting rays. These ancestors naturally became scared.

“Is this brat still human? So young yet possesses such a terrifying power already.” One of them shuddered.

“How does he compare to Jade-break and Puresword True Emperor?” Someone couldn’t help but ask.

“I don’t think they’re comparable.” An old True God shook his head: “The emperors are battle-hardened with brilliant talents and power among the young generation, but this so-called Fiercest is already amazing, being able to do this much.”

“How boring.” Li Qiye yawned while being struck by these rays: “Using the dao to control machines is a good method, but it is not being masterly done here, far inferior compared to the machine race.”

He smiled: “Okay, don’t block my view anymore, scrap metals.” With that, he slowly raised both hands.

“Buzz.” The melted space seemed to be torn asunder like the chaotic opening of a new world. Next came the light of dawn to signal the start of all things below the blue sky.

The hundred ships or so suddenly lost control and floated up and down. Gravity and weight have been affected.

“Not good!” The generals realized that they couldn’t control their ships.

Li Qiye circled his hands and the area turned into a gigantic maelstrom. One could actually hear splashing sounds like the ups-and-downs in an ocean. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Rumble!” The ships naturally spun with the vortex at an increasing pace. Finally, they became part of this maelstrom, quite a majestic scene.

“Boom! Boom!” After this formational shift, the cannons on the smaller ships suddenly aimed towards the ten big ones and began firing at full force.

The big ships were caught unprepared and trembled from the attacks. Some hulls were directly penetrated.

They immediately retaliated with their own cannons. With just one barrage, more than ten small ships were destroyed.

“We’re on the same side! We’re on the same side!” The disciples and generals on the surviving smaller ships shouted in horror, unlike their fallen brothers who couldn’t even scream in time.

“Buzz.” The ten main ships exuded a blinding light that eventually culminated in the form of a barrier.

Deafening explosions resounded as a result. The barrier effectively nullified the continuous barrage from the smaller ships.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Though the smaller ships went all out against the ten main ones, the barrier was simply too strong. Of course, it was shaking back and forth along with the area.

Meanwhile, the crowd was in awe at how Li Qiye managed to seize control of the smaller ships.

One ancestor took a deep breath and said: “Absolute control over space. Once he starts doing that, everyone within that domain will have to follow his whim.”

“Go now!” Li Qiye chuckled and pushed his hands forward.

“Boom!” The rest of the smaller ships condensed in the vortex and flew forward like a massive continent, aiming for the bigger ones.
