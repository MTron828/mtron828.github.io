Chapter 4360: Regrets

“Nothing is impossible since you have gone so far, just keep in mind that although nothing is off the table, there is a price for it all.” Li Qiye smiled.

“This again?” A’jiao stared flirtily at him and said: “We’re about to become a couple, no need to be so distant and calculative. It should be easy to talk between families.”

Her demeanor and tone would have been pleasant if she were a beauty. Alas, listeners only got goosebumps and felt nauseous from her bad acting.

Li Qiye said: “We can talk, it’s just that my starting price is high. Of course, he can afford it, no?”

“I’m here with sincerity and knew that you would turn around.” She said.

“I see, speak then.” He smiled, unaffected by her lack of charm.

“Honey, everyone has regrets, right? You do as well.” A’jiao’s voice suddenly became alluring and irresistible.

“Now that’s more like it.” Li Qiye narrowed his eyes.

“My father asks, what if you can make up for past regrets?” She said.

“Go on, I’m interested.” Li Qiye was not an exception and certainly had regrets in life.

“For example, the dead coming back to life.” There seemed to be celestial lights flashing in the depth of her eyes.

The disciples in the back heard her clearly. First, Li Qiye talked about the old beggar being dead. Now, this girl was talking about rebirth? They thought that this conversation was rather private and sensitive so they decided to stay far away and stop prying.

“There are always those who are missed, what would one do just to have a chance to say goodbye?” She said softly, seemingly falling into remembrance and reflecting. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“True.” His gaze traveled across the river of time before stopping at a particular figure. Perhaps someone had waited for him during the long years.

Alas, he kept on moving forward and the figure eventually disappeared. He had thought about returning to at least say something. Unfortunately, this never happened and it became his regret.

It was too late to do anything about it since time reduced it all to dust. The only medicine for this was time traveling or rebirth.

“What if we can turn dust back to life? You can then again pick up the pieces and no longer feel regretful.” She said stirringly.

“It’s not that I can’t do it, there are methods for rebirth.” He smiled. It’s not that he couldn’t do it; it’s that he shouldn’t.

“I see, so you have, at the very least, thought about it.” She said.

“What if I did?” He responded.

This offer didn’t seem to be enough to surprise Li Qiye.

“I don’t doubt your ability in doing so.” She laughed elegantly, one in tune with nature before continuing: “But, I’m sure that there will be flaws in your process. You know that as well. It won’t be the same as before.”

“And he claims to be able to do it?” He knew what she was implying.

“It is not a problem as long as you agree. Just nod and you’ll be able to return to the source.” She blinked.

“Is that so? There are things that one can’t jump out of, not even him in spite of having total control. It is impossible.” He disagreed.

“No one is talking about jumping out but there are substitutions. You mustn’t worry about that and should just focus on how you’ll be able to make up for past regrets. My father can do it.” She elaborated.

“Got it.” He didn’t doubt her father’s ability. A’jiao was most likely telling the truth.

“So what’s your answer?” Her tone became playful again.

“Time eventually leaves no traces, even if one tries to make amend, it still won’t be the same. It is not the past and not the same person.” He stared at her.

“Don’t worry, leave it to my father. Since he dared to boast, I’m sure there won’t be a problem. You will be able to return to the past, the exact past as before without causing any ripple.”

He fell into silence. His eyes returned to the past again and his very being seemed to have returned as well. Time was still flowing around him without disruption despite him breaking the rule.

“This is indeed tempting.” He eventually broke out of this state and said.

“So is that a yes?” Her eyes turned bright.

There weren’t many things in the world capable of tempting Li Qiye. Moreover, he just needed to put in the effort and pay the price then he could obtain anything. Thus, both peerless treasures and laws weren’t enough. However, getting rid of past regrets might be a different story.

“Wouldn’t it be too simple if this alone is enough to move me?” He said flatly.

“I’m aware.” She nodded: “This is only the first of many things to show that we’re sincere. As long as you agree, we can negotiate further.”

“No.” He shook his head: “Your condition is excellent but it is not enough. My heart is made of steel and has already decided to let the past go. This is inevitable on the journey, whether one is a devil or an immortal, a test that must be overcome.”

She understood his point. The overlords and hidden existences in the darkness have experienced this before. Their heart became as hard as steel as a result.

They eventually made different choices on the long path but none wanted to pick up the pieces of the past.

“Fine, let me know your requirements then.” She said.

“My demand is not unreasonable, there is only one. I don’t need to say it since you already know.” He responded before gazing up at the sky. It seemed that he was already standing at the farthest reach.

Her expression became serious since she knew the demand. There was no need for words considering his gaze.
