Chapter 4577: Spring Comes Upon A Withered Tree

A verdant spring returned to the Tree of Contribution. Though it was still dead, the group felt as if it was returning to life and that leaves could return at any second.

Majestic life force continued to surge from the depths. It seemed that the tree was still rooted in that peerless earth vein.

This vein resembled a gigantic dragon slumbering underground. Thus, the tree was growing on its body and capable of borrowing its power.

“This is…?” The members of the four clans felt this special aura. Though it wasn’t overwhelming, each inch of their land became more pleasant with a bit more water and life.

Nonetheless, this was more than enough for them. The highly-aware disciples could feel that their territory was transforming. With enough years, their land would turn into a paradise for cultivation - a perfect foundation for future descendants.

“Is it alive again?” Everyone on top of the peak was ecstatic.

“Not quite, but it is awakened.” Wise quietly said: “In order for it to actually be alive again, hmm… a lot more time is required. Most importantly, the Primordial Union.”

“Buzz.” Green rays, the color of life, emanated from the withered tree. Each ray represented a single grand dao of life.

A spatial ripple could be felt, akin to the opening of another dimension. A tiny spiritual totem surrounded by green light flew out of the tree. It had the form of a tiny tree but its life force was as vast as a boundless ocean. The waves emanating from it could drown the firmaments.

“Is this the soul of the tree?” An ancestor asked. This was still her first time seeing something like this - a tiny totem possessing enough life force to engulf the entire world. This could change everything regarding their four clans.

“This must be the thing to enter the union.” Wise and the others have read the old records before. He quietly said: “It’s finally here, seems like we still need the ancient ancestor’s method. The four dao stones alone weren’t enough.”

They understood that given their ability, they couldn’t have possibly activated the tree, let alone summoned its soul.

“Buzz.” The soul fell into Li Qiye’s palm and turned into little strands. They seeped into his flesh and flowed through his blood.

“It seems a true awakening still requires entry.” Li Qiye felt the tree’s power and commented.

“Please, Young Noble.” The ancestors prostrated and chanted.

Li Qiye stared at them and said: “It’s fine, I was going to go anyway.”

The ancestors ordered their immediate descendants to come to the peak in order to show their respect. They finally saw a sliver of hope for their clans in the future.

While staying in the Wu, Li Qiye had a courtyard with his regular group as company.

He sat down and summoned the girl encapsulated in chronoblood amber.

“Is it time, Young Noble?” Jian Ming and the daoist became excited, the same for Wise Ancestor. They have been eagerly awaiting for this moment ever since Li Qiye won the auction.

Li Qiye seemed a bit emotional while staring at the girl.

“I wonder who she is. Unless this is a natural encapsulation, she must be a heaven-defying existence.” Jian Ming was the first to speak.

“It’s not naturally formed.” The daoist shook his head.

“Then it's manmade.” Jian Ming became even more emotional: “This is chronoblood amber we’re talking about? Where does one find such a large block? I don’t think Sky Border has a single one. Is she a dao lord or an emperor, or maybe even an immortal? Or perhaps the daughter of one.”

“We can eliminate her being a dao lord or emperor.” The daoist said: “I’ve heard a theory that these beings either accept the dao fruit or the heaven’s will. They have such peerless properties that even the precious chronoblood amber can’t seal them for long. That is the reason why they have to leave this world eventually.”

“Then she’s the daughter of an immortal.” Jian Ming joked: “We’re rich then, we found an immortal’s daughter and we’ll be able to fish her parents out.” He started laughing, seemingly coming up with a nefarious plan. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Where are you going to find some immortals?” Li Qiye said dismissively.

“Hehe.” Jian Ming scratched his head awkwardly because no one has seen an immortal before. Therefore, how could this girl be an immortal’s daughter?

“Young Noble, you surely know who she is.” Jian Ming naturally understood this because Li Qiye’s eyes were different whenever he gazed at her.

“An old friend.” Li Qiye didn’t hide it.

“An old friend?” The trio shuddered. They knew that Li Qiye was an ancient and mighty existence.

Therefore, his old friend must be incredible as well. These simple characters overwhelmed them because they came from Li Qiye.

“I see…” Jian Ming’s legs started shaking.

If this was another immemorial existence, just one stray strand of power could crush them.

“Young Noble, this old friend of yours must be a peerless fairy, completely unmatched in history…” Jian Ming calmed down and started flattering.

“I wonder if your sly tongue will be effective. I advise you to watch yourself in a little bit.” Li Qiye smiled.

“...” Jian Ming trembled again.
