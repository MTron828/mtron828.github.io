Chapter 4479: Legend

“Golden Isle doesn’t care about external matters or domination. However, even True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao didn’t dare to challenge it back then.” Wise looked up at the floating islands and commented.

“Yes, it had plenty of invincible masters, not just Emperor Ye.” Jian Ming said: “After the emperor, it had Tree Ancestor, Mulberry God, Heaven Fountain, and many more. This is before taking into account the ancient beings before Emperor Ye. That’s why Golden Isle is so frightening. How many sects can match up to it in terms of age and resources?”

“No one likes sharing a bed.” Wise continued the train of thoughts: “There are unfathomable lineages in Inner Ruins. However, Golden Isle still existed so close to them, meaning that they have qualms against moving against the isle.”

Ultimately, Golden Isle might actually be on par with True Immortal Sect and Three Thousand Dao. It’s just that it preferred to be isolated from the rest of the world.

“This has plenty to do with their races.” Li Qiye’s eyes could pierce through the barriers shrouding the islands.

Wise Ancestor activated his heavenly gaze and nodded: “Yes, with the exception of Emperor Ye, the ancient ancestors of Golden Isle exist within the islands. In a sense, they have become a part of their lineage. This is the most frightening detail.”

He was talking about the waterfalls and towering trees. They looked just like guardian deities.

This referred to a particular legend - that the ancestors of Golden Isle didn’t pass away. They became a part of Golden Isle and as long as the islands were around, so would they. Perhaps their original self was no longer there, but this was indeed a method to last forever. The accumulation of top cultivators resulted in a matchless foundation.

This played a part in why disciples from Golden Isle were rarely seen outside. Once they reached a certain realm, they could take roots in Golden Isle for eras to come.

Eras seemed like an eternity for regular cultivators but for these members, it would only be the blink of an eye.

“People might be afraid of Golden Isle but not our young noble. Hurricanes and tornados are as light as a breeze in his presence.” Jian Ming smiled.

“Watch your words.” Wise glared at him.

However, he seemed audacious this time and continued: “I’m merely speaking the truth, Ancestor. The young noble is invincible without needing to do anything. In fact, upon meeting, Golden Isle will regret their late reception.”

“Seems like you’re eager for a beating.” Wise’s glare intensified. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jian Ming hid behind Li Qiye and continued: “Young Noble, am I wrong here?”

“I can see that you have learned many bad things in recent years. I would have kicked you flying if your last name wasn’t Jian.” Li Qiye said flatly.

“... Thank you, Young Noble.” Jian Ming continued: “I didn’t know it was so wrong to speak the truth. You are special, even the top masters are nothing more than laymen in comparison.”

“Stop buttering me up.” Li Qiye gave him the side-eye and said: “Get on with this and find people from the Yu.”

“I understand.” Jian Ming immediately said: “In my opinion, if they want to sell the stolen goods, they’ll definitely visit Dark Street. We should go there now.” Having said that, he led the duo into the city.

Along the way, Li Qiye suddenly stopped on a large street. Next to it was a strange place, a complete contrast to the bustling city where each inch of land was unreasonably expensive.

It could be considered the center of the city yet it was rather quiet and pristine. One could see a verdant mountain range with gurgling streams and cranes. Only a few old buildings with red bricks and green roof-tiles could be seen. This resembled a sect but there weren’t that many disciples, only one or two passing by.

The rowdiness of the city couldn’t reach this place. Even travelers walked slowly and quietly when passing by. A mysterious power here demanded so.

Li Qiye let out a sigh after seeing this serene spectacle.

“Young Noble, this is Land of the Pure Lotus.” Wise whispered: “This is the holiest place in Golden or maybe all of Eight Desolaces. Conflicts are prohibited.”

“I’ve heard of many legends regarding this place.” Jian Ming whispered: “It belongs to an attendant of the Imperial Queen. No one is allowed to be disrespectful here.”

“I see.” Li Qiye said.

“The legends are so old, virtually impossible to trace or research. They state that there used to be a sect here. Its saintess became the greatest queen’s attendant. Later on, no one saw them again but this place still became a hallowed ground. It doesn’t matter what feud two parties might have, they must not act or even be loud here. This rule has never been challenged before.” Jian Ming went on.

“Right. Even dao lords would need to tidy their robes before entering this place.” Wise Ancestor nodded: “Puresun Dao Lord, the ancient one, even showed his respect from a distance. The peerless Blessed Dao Lord also stopped here and lowered his head. The subsequent dao lords showed the same level of care when approaching this place.”

“But, I’ve heard of one exception. He actually came and stay for a long time. Can you guess who it is?” Jian Ming asked.

“It’s Duality Master.” He then answered his own question.

“Yes, the only outsider to sleep in the hallowed ground. It might just be a rumor though.” Wise added.

Pure Lotus enjoyed peace for eras now. However, it wasn’t an unbeatable sect or anything, not even one single brilliant disciple could be seen. Nonetheless, dao lords still didn’t dare to disturb this place, always hiding their auras and fanfare when near.
