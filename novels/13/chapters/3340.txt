“Who the hell are you, running your mouth like this? You deserve a slap!” Chen Chen retorted.

“Oh, you’re actually right. A slap is in order. Slap him.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“Pop! Pop! Pop!” Gong Qianyue moved with lightning speed and delivered a dozen slaps in the blink of an eye. Chen Chen’s head swung back and forth from the impact.

He spat out blood and teeth. However, his rage was far worse than the pain: “Kill, kill all of them!”

“Clank! Clank!” The disciples from Three Truths unsheathed their weapons.

“End this.” Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at the guy.

“Clank!” Qianyue took out her sword. Its cold energy and murderous intent pierced through the sky.

“Don’t do it! Miss Gong, does your sect want to go to war against ours? Think about the bigger picture!” Shu Jinqiao blocked in front of her and shouted.

“Daring to oppose us? We’ll destroy your sect soon enough!” The crazed Chen Chen roared. His mind had nothing but fury.

He was the First Disciple of the chief protector in Three Truths, meaning that he was always pampered. Now, being slapped in public left him mad.

Li Qiye simply waved his hand to reiterate the order.

“You asked for this.” Qianyue’s sword aimed straight for Chen Chen.

“You dare?!” Shu Jinqiao tried to stop her sword by creating a majestic mountain.

Unfortunately, Qianyue’s movement was impeccable, easily surpassing any terrain.

Jinqiao’s cultivation was actually stronger but he still couldn’t stop her.

“Clank!” Chen Chen was blinded by the glint of her sword. He summoned a treasure for defensive purposes but it was too late. “No!” He cried out.

“Pluff!” His head flew upward and blood gushed out from the neck. It spun several times before landing on the ground. His wide-open eyes could see the dismemberment and his falling body.

He didn’t expect to meet his end here to Qianyue’s sword. No, he had such a great future ahead of him, believing that he could become a ruler of an entire region.

“What have you done?!” The Shu Brothers’ expression turned unsightly.

Chen Chen might only be a third-generation disciple but he was still the First Disciple of their chief elder. What were they going to say after returning to the sect?

The other disciples from Three Truths became afraid and ran away from Qianyue.

Her power and mercilessness successfully frightened all of them.

“MIss Gong, this is a declaration of war?!” Shu Qinjiao uttered coldly.

“So what? No mercy for those who conspire against Divine Black.” She strongly responded.

Her peers felt their blood boiling; some couldn’t help but cheer. They viewed her as the pride of the sect.

The Shu Brothers didn’t expect this boldness from Qianyue. This wasn’t part of their plan.

“Is this your stance or your sect’s?” Shu Youyou glared at her.

“It’s mine. Don’t think about leaving today with your dog head still attached.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

The two brothers became belligerent towards Li Qiye. How could a Bronze Tendon disciple order Gong Qianyue around? This was so bizarre.

They made up their mind and Youyou spoke: “Enough of you, arrogant junior! I’ll teach you a lesson in your senior’s stead!” He reached for Li Qiye next.

“Hmph! Your opponent is me!” Qianyue performed a horizontal slash at once.

“Miss Gong, let’s see what you can do!” Jinqiao shouted.

“Boom!” He summoned a truncheon and attempted to smash her. The weapon contained a billowing flame just like a descending volcano.

The two of them maneuvered at the same time. One went for Li Qiye while the other tried to stop Qianyue from interfering.

Qianyue performed the same fluid movement steps to dodge the truncheon and appeared right in front of Li Qiye.

“Clank!” Her sword moved like a peacock spreading its tail and emitted numerous rays. Layers of sword images appeared and stopped Youyou’s palm strike.

“Boom!” The sword intent in this defensive seal forced Youyou back.

“The dance of the tortoise and crane!” Jinqiao realized the movement technique after failing to stop her twice. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jinqiao was at the grand level of Samadhi Materialization so he should be stronger than her. How could she maneuver around him so easily?

The two brothers exchanged glances after recognizing the move. This technique was created by the Black Tortoise. It was a high-level heaven merit law, one of the best in Divine Black.

They might be stronger but didn’t have the same talents. They could only train high-level earth laws at best at their current cultivation level.

On the other hand, her inborn true fate allowed her to learn heaven laws. This gave her immense advantages.

“Let’s see how amazing an inborn true fate is!” Youyou didn’t give up.

“Boom!” He activated his power. The terrible samadhi flame oozed out and ravaged the area.

Weaker disciples couldn’t handle the heat and needed to retreat.

He took out his weapon - a moon fork at the high earth level. It was the strongest classification that he could still control.

“Eight Wind Devils!” He released tornados empowered with his flame straight at her.

This power caused many disciples from Divine Black to have goosebumps.

Qianyue snorted in response. “Boom!” A Divine Tortoise shouldered the heaven above her, accompanied by the stars. Its dreadful yet stately imperial aura suppressed the area.

“Black Tortoise Imperial Art!” The members of Divine Black cheered.

Her opponents became alarmed after seeing this move. It was a high-level heaven merit law, strong enough to take down anyone!

“Clank!” She raised her sword towards the sky and prepared a peerless slash.

“Whoosh!” The vertical fiery slash sent Youyou flying.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” He somersaulted several times before hitting the ground yet was still pushed backward for dozens of steps before stabilizing.

He was as pale as can be. He looked down and saw a deep cut on his moon fork.

His cultivation advantage couldn’t make up for the gap between their merit laws.

“Yes!” Those from Divine Black started celebrating.
