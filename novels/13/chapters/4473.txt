Chapter 4474: Ten-crest Ancestor

\“Well…” Wise Ancestor smiled awkwardly before replying: “Though the times are different and we can’t compare to the past, the rules still remain. Once we rise again, we’ll have a leader once more.”

“Yes, we should and will have a leader soon enough.” Purpose Ancestor said: “I have hope for the future. Remember, the rules were created by the forefather and honored by their descendants. Even though we are incapable, we just need to persevere and one day, a leader will rise upon us, one deserving the golden crest.”

“Hmph.” The clan master snorted and took another deep breath from his pipe.

The four clans shared the Willow Crest even though it belonged to the Lu. It was left behind by the Ten-crest Ancestor. Rumor has it that an immortal bestowed it to the ancestor.

It granted the user a regal and oppressive aura. It also boosted their battle potential, improving the efficacy of each technique. Most importantly, it served as a symbol of authority and prestige.

Because of this, whenever the four clans chose an alliance leader, this person would get to wield the crest.

After all, a worthy leader deserved a worthy crown. Therefore, the other three clans paid a proper sum in order to use the Lu’s crest.

Later on, a leader was no longer necessary due to the clans’ decline. They lost their influence and didn’t need a leader to give orders.

Unfortunately for the Lu, their decline was swifter than the others. They eventually lost many treasures and asked for the crest back in order to pawn it. Alas, the other three clans refused, using the future and past glory as justification.

To be blunt, they didn’t want the Lu to lose the crest forever. After all, it had pivotal importance to the alliance and symbolized hope for a better future.

The Lu asked repeatedly only to be vetoed. Though it still maintained an ally relationship, a rift clearly existed. They were suffering yet their allies held on to their heirloom?

Because of this, they stopped interacting with the three clans and showed a clear distaste.

In this case, the clan master absolutely didn’t want to hand their dao stone over. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Virtuous Nephew, there are certain things that our generation alone can’t fix. However, the dao stone is one thing we can definitely do. It doesn’t only benefit our three clans, right?” Wise persuaded: “If we can gather all four, the young noble will revive our Tree of Contribution and primordial energy will return again. Your clan will benefit just as much in the future, right?”

The clan master opened his mouth for a moment but decided to go back to smoking his pipe.

“Virtuous Nephew, the young noble is here and the union draws near, we can’t miss this opportunity. After all, our solidarity made us strong in the past. Furthermore, there is no benefit for your clan to hold onto the dao stone.”

“What’s the benefit to your three clans holding on to our Willow Crest?” The clan master retorted.

This shut the trio up again.

“All of this bickering over one crown.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The group could only stare at Li Qiye after hearing this.

He ignored them and stared at the lady in the painting, becoming slightly emotional: “An intent left behind for an epoch just because of one fateful meeting. It’s time for it to disperse.”

Having said that, he reached forward to touch the painting.

“Buzz.” The painting suddenly lit up. All the details and outlines of the lady also did the same. The radiance coming from them brimmed with divinity.

“Ten-crest Ancestor!” The Lu Clan Master became startled since his ancestor seemed to be coming back to life. One could even see her eyes blinking at this point.

The might of a godking instantly took over the hall and made them shudder. This was a being who had protected Eight Desolaces and commanded reverence.

This oppressive aura was as tangible as can be, not a mere illusion. They didn’t dare to look straight at her.

“This is…” The four of them were astounded.

This painting has been in the hall for so long. The members of the Lu had no idea when it was placed here, only that it has been around right at the start of the clan.

The portrait depicted the Ten-crest Ancestor, a being dating back to the previous epoch. They only viewed it as an heirloom and didn’t think about anything else.

Alas, the painting was coming back to life and emitting such a frightening phenomenon.

“Pop!” Sure enough, the lady walked out of the radiant painting. This only made the aura more unbearable.

“The spirit of our ancestor is back!” They prostrated on the ground and shouted, overwhelmed with emotion. They kept on smashing their forehead onto the floor.

The lady focused on Li Qiye with her bright eyes. Time seemed to be reverting back to a previous epoch - the nine worlds. She reverted into a woman from Static Stream, always decisive and straightforward.
