Chapter 4682: Darkviolet Celestial Horse Grass

“Let’s move it.” Li Qiye continued walking.

“Where are we going? Tracing the dao source?” Jian Ming asked.

Li Qiye had agreed to save their Tree of Contribution. The way to do this was to connect the tree to the dao source of the Primordial Union. This would allow their clans to wield the dao source’s power again to revive the tree and revitalize their clan.

“Do you want to save the tree first or save your wife’s ancestor?” Li Qiye smilingly asked.

Jian Ming pondered carefully. Both matters were equally important but he promised his wife that they would save her ancestor. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Currently, the emperor was under attack by all. Time was of the essence. On the other hand, this was the one opportunity to save their tree. Getting mixed up in other affairs could potentially ruin their chances, meaning that he would become the sinner of the clans.

“Well…” He stammered: “D-do we have enough time?”

The daoist elbowed him and laughed: “If your ancestors know about your hesitation, they’ll definitely kick you out.”

Jian Ming protested with an angry glare.

“Don’t worry, we have plenty of time but if we don’t mind that emperor fast enough, True Immortal will do so and it’ll be difficult for you to save him, he is standing on his last leg now.”

“Alright, I’ll leave everything to you, Young Noble.” Jian Ming heaved a sigh of relief.

The group traveled deeper into this world, crossing through the remote mountain ranges. The peaks became taller and taller, reaching into the azure itself.

“Hmm, this peak seemed different.” Jian Ming stopped the group. He had seen numerous peaks at this point and noticed something peculiar.

“What about it?” The daoist reached down on the ground and picked up a handful of dirt. He noticed something too but couldn’t express it.

“It doesn’t feel like a peak. This whole place seems different from a mountain range.” Jian Ming said.

“You’re right, it didn’t use to be one.” Li Qiye who was leading the way smiled.

“What was it then?” The duo found this surprising.

“A root.” Li Qiye nonchalantly responded.

“A root?” The two exchanged glances of confusion.

“Of what…?” Jian Ming asked for elaboration. The roots alone reached space itself?

Li Qiye answered with a smile.

Flashes occurred randomly during this region. These were signs of ancestors finding the dao source and nesting inside.

As for the young geniuses who tagged along, they didn’t need to prolong their lifespan and focused on other things.

There were numerous expensive materials growing in a place so densely packed with energy. These were their targets.

“Screech!” On a particular mountain, a fire bird spewed out an inferno while trying to hunt a dozen cultivators. Nonetheless, they made it away thanks to the leadership of their ancient ancestor.

“Fromjade Dynasty’s ancient ancestor stole a golden egg from a Firedao Bird.” News of this spread quickly.

Dragon roars were heard in a ravine, prompting people to come to take a look. They saw that it was excavated and filled with medicinal fragrance. Someone must have gotten a precious alchemy ingredient.

Sure enough, a while later, they were informed that Abyss Sect found a draconic ginseng that has been growing for millions of years.

“Seven-star Gate found a special spirit jewel in a marsh, it can absorb and release heavenly essences."

“Smiling Young Noble found a fruit that boosts training efficacy.”

“I heard a clan found a divine stone that can transform into an auspicious beast.”

News of the treasure hunt traveled everywhere. Unfortunately, some of them were eventually robbed by stronger sects and ancestors. This caused screams to echo in the mountain range from all the fighting.

“Seven-star Gate’s ancestor was murdered, the spirit jewel is gone.”

“Smiling Young Noble is being pursued by Eight-horn Heavenly Demon right now, no one knows where he is.”

All in all, there were winners and losers in the Primordial Union. Losing often meant death.

Nonetheless, no one wanted to be passive here because this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity despite the risk.

Of course, not all forgot about the original goal of the union - finding the primordial. A few geniuses and ancestors headed for the top of various peaks. They began using their merit law to learn more about the dao.

Not all could reach this goal. Only supreme geniuses could derive and connect with the dao source through cultivation.

“Buzz.” A dao source appeared on the pinnacle of a towering peak. The figure rushed inside and harmonized with it. Dao melodies and laws manifested into heavenly flowers as she sat inside.

She wore a simple dress without any unnecessary decoration, looking rather transcending.

“Firmament Mortal King.” Many recognized her and became startled.

The news of her being able to derive and learn from a dao source spread. They talked about the various visual phenomena accompanied with it.

People came to take a look right away and became amazed at her accomplishment.

“She’s a peerless genius instead, that’s one of the five conquerors for you.” An ancestor praised.

Deriving a dao source was far from easy. Entering the union didn’t guarantee this. Modeling the grand dao was even harder but she managed to do so.

Ultimately, many events were happening inside the union but this didn’t affect Li Qiye’s group at all.

They continued heading deeper into this world. They came across a dark valley and noticed violet energy oozing from it.

“A divine grass known as Darkviolet Celestial Horse.” Li Qiye glanced at the energy and said.

The duo became emotional. The daoist said: “I heard Three Thousand Dao has one, they use it to help ancient ancestor grow their dao.”

They immediately rushed for the valley’s entrance. Once they got in, they saw someone and the corpse of a beast.
