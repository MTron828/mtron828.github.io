Chapter 5458: Oceanic Slash

Spectators somehow forgot about his identity and power, only seeing a blade before them.0

“Boom!” His twelve dao fruits became resplendent. He pulsed brightly with an ocean of chaos true energy.0

A magnificent anima tree appeared in the center of his fate palaces and dao fruits. It illuminated the region and granted him incredible power.0

“Clank!” His dao turned heaven and earth into his blade - an omnipotent and omnipresent attack. If he imagined his sword piercing the opponent, it would manifest into reality.0

Spectators felt the presence of his sword dao and looked up in the sky - an ocean of swords could be seen, still ever expanding. Eventually, this dao was everywhere; even an immortal wouldn’t be able to walk forward without being pierced.0

This technique was the perfect embodiment of his title - Swordsea. 0

“Oceanic Slash!” He shouted but no one could see him through the countless swords.0

Divine swords immediately surrounded the target. One required untold power in order to escape the blockade. Alas, they would find themselves trapped between more waves.0

“Clank!” The hum of the swords came from all directions and temporal branches - past, present, and future.0

There had been invincible swordsmen in the past; some dominated today with their blades, and more would do so in the future. All of their swords and techniques were encompassed in Swordsea’s attack.0

Oceanic Slash was the beginning and final destination, containing the ultimate profundity of this dao.0

Other sword masters including Darkfrost, Sword Queen, and Supreme were in awe. They admitted that this technique alone would add Swordsea to the list of the greatest sword users in history.0

“Clank!” It cut down all dimensions and timelines, leaving only death behind.0

“Heart Blade.” Li Qiye smiled and murmured.0

He needed nothing - no technique or a physical sword. As long as his heart wished so, his thoughts would turn into invisible blades.0Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This was the opposite of Swordsea’s boundless ocean of divine swords. Li Qiye’s attack couldn’t be seen at all.0

Nonetheless, it protected him from Swordsea’s onslaught and astounded the apex cultivators. The world wouldn’t be able to find a superior sword.0

“My Dao.” Eternal Conqueror took action as well, revealing his resplendent anima tree.0

He took one step forward and released his perfect eternal aura. It happened so quickly - the summoning and activation process were too swift for cultivators to detect.0

Time seemingly came to a halt as his dao connected him with heaven and earth. He became a river of time flowing through all three timelines.0

In fact, everyone felt as if time no longer mattered in his presence. They could now pick a timeline - going back to when they were eighteen or enjoying their power during their prime…0

His dao made everything seem illusory and dreamlike. However, the past and the future could somehow be grasped.0

Of course, he was the only one in actual control.0

“Eternity!” He roared and activated his bloodline - Divine Eternal. Its power quietly infiltrated the river of time and painted it bright red.0

The river became increasingly dazzling and impressive, seemingly overcoming the restraints of time and granting him true immortality.0

“Simply incredible!” A spectator shouted.0

Time no longer left its mark on the conqueror. No power could destroy his current state for he was truly eternal. This was the man who went against Celestial Court without facing any consequences.0

“This dao, as ephemeral as the clouds.” Li Qiye glanced at the dao and epochs passed by within his eyes.0

He looked back at history and saw nothing but dispersing clouds, whether it be the brightest river of time or the mightiest cultivators. Nothing lasted forever.1
