Chapter 5138: Have A Bowl Of Noodles

The conqueror blasted the hell bear from a distance, never showing his face from start to finish.

The villagers recognized him since he was a feral child from the village. He didn’t forget this and always protected his home.

It didn’t take long before disciples from Windchaser Hall brought the corpse away. The barrier then gradually dissipated.

Villagers heaved a sigh of relief. For countless years now, this paradise remained due to various protectors.

It became the morning of the next day. Jun Landu looked up and saw the dawn. Li Qiye finally opened his eyes and smiled: “Now that was a nice break.”

“Since you have some free time, would you like to go fishing and sightseeing as well?” Landu asked.

“Why not? Since I’m here already, might as well enjoy myself.” Li Qiye responded.

Landu put away his book and said: “I’m sure you’re hungry so why don’t we go eat something? I know a restaurant that makes their noodles by hand. Very chewy and the broth is rich, the chef is rather skilled.”

“Perfect, let’s go then.” Li Qiye smiled and got up to stretch before following Landu.

As the saying goes - immortals reside in the east sea in the morning and rest in the northern frontier at dusk. They could travel ten thousand miles with one step just to enjoy a bowl of noodles.

At a particular hill were twisting trees with crows perching and entangling vines. After entering a half-abandoned road stretching through the ridge, it felt as if they have traveled to a different dimension.

While looking down, they saw farms and houses in the distance. This was early morning yet the scenery gave the impression of it being twilight.

The road was infected with weeds and grass. After finishing the climb through the road, they made it to a small noodle restaurant with a cloth curtain hanging outside. It has turned black and shiny due to the cooking smoke and oil with the characters, Xiao Zhi.

It was unlikely to have many customers, only the occasional passersby needing to rest and fill their stomach before continuing onward.

To the left of the shop was a bundle of firewood prepared by a youth swinging his axe busily.

“Pa! Pa! Pa!” The rhythmic swing managed to split the wood cleanly every time, showcasing his impressive skills.

On the other side was an old man pulling the noodles, stretching each strand carefully. The flour grains on them were precisely identical in number and size.

His robe was clean but his hands were even cleaner. No one would have a problem with him not using gloves in preparation.

The youth saw Li Qiye and Jun Landu coming closer. He wasn’t surprised about Landu but paused for a moment when his eyes fell upon Li Qiye. The same thing happened with the old man.

He stared at Li Qiye who smiled back at him. He immediately put down the flour and went back to the store.

“Uncle Xiao Zhi, give us two bowls.” Landu asked with a smile and handed the payment over.

The old man accepted and put the coins into his chest pocket.

“Xiao Hu, heat the broth.” He ordered.

“Yes.” The youth added firewood to the stove in a masterful manner. Strands of smoke rose instantly like mountain spirits.

Li Qiye sat down, propping his chin and watching the youth while Landu took out his book again.

Once the water boiled, the old man came over while holding a black carp: “I caught it just this morning, how about two bowls of tender fish noodles?”

“That’s fine.” Landu agreed without looking away from the text.

“Give us two bowls as well.” Two customers entered the shop, one male and one female.

They seemed to be a match made from heaven; their appearance brightened up the shop.

The man wore an expensive robe with an elegant air. The winds seemed to be accompanying him, giving him the ability to soar in the air.

The woman’s features weren’t stunning at first sight. However, one would never get tired of looking at her. She was akin to a delicate drizzle, comforting and unobtrusive.

It seemed rather strange for them to appear in this remote region, especially at a cheap noodle shop.

“Alright.” The old man stuffed the lump of coins into his pocket after being paid by the male customer.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The two then sat down at a table opposite Li Qiye, hand in hand. They nodded at Li Qiye and Landu as a greeting. Li Qiye smiled in response.

The shop was particularly warm and serene; the affairs from the outside world didn’t affect them in the slightest.

The old man picked up a knife and skillfully sliced the raw fish into thin pieces before tossing them into the boiling water. Each swing was swift and orderly yet they could still be seen with perfect clarity.

Li Qiye was watching a master at work but the lovers only had eyes for each other. They snuggled together tightly with love flashing in their eyes. This attraction was palpable in the air.

Time came to a halt with everything in harmony, whether it be Landu reading his book, Li Qiye leaning on his chin, and the lovers whispering sweet nothings to each other.

When Landu finished his chapter, the old man also finished and the youth placed a bowl in front of him at that exact moment. The timing was perfect and the others were served as well.

Li Qiye picked up his chopsticks and enjoyed the chewy noodles in combination with the tender fish meat.

As for the couple, they fed each other pieces of fish and soup, showing affection with every move. They seemed to be of one mind and not a single action was wasted. Nothing else in the world existed, only their love.
