Chapter 4394: Bamboo Feather Art

None expected Jian Qingzhu to be so strong, not even the members of Dragon.

“Is Senior Sister Jian the strongest youth in our sect then?” One of them asked.

“Certainly looks that way.” One whispered.

The strongest genius of Dragon was obviously between these two combatants since they were both sovereigns.

Qingzhu had the upper hand right now so her odds looked better.

“What a shame, such power, talent, and luck. She could have inherited our legacy.” A member of the previous generation sighed.

The older cultivators lamented her betrayal, picking Li Qiye over her sect. Her achievements no longer mattered because Dragon would not pick her as its successor. After all, no sect could tolerate a traitor. Dragon was already being merciful by not persecuting and executing her.

“Well done, again!” Celestial Tiger’s spirit didn’t diminish in the slightest.

His true fate released unending light and made his two dao resplendent.

“Raa!” His spear’s aura ran wild and poured down true dragon laws. He finally activated the power of his weapon’s dao bone.

Meanwhile, one of his dao coiled around the spear like a galaxy. Spectators saw a true dragon swimming in this bright galaxy and empowering the spear. A pillar of light pierced the sky vault right away after the full empowerment.

“Lunging Tiger, Soaring Dragon!” A disciple from Dragon recognized the dao right away.

This was another powerful mantra from Dragon - embodying the ferocity of a tiger and the agility of a dragon.

Next came the power of a king from the dao bone. Chaos energy woke up the beast. His own dao was fusing with the spear’s dao - a method to exert the true potential of the weapon. This was more effective for him than using another dao lord merit law. Suitability often trumped the sheer ability of a merit law.

“Sky Breaker!” He unleashed another devastating thrust.

“Boom!” The crowd felt as if he had just pierced through the earth and all of its inhabitants. Some looked down at their chest and screamed in horror.

Not to mention the horrified youths, even older cultivators gasped because they knew that it could actually kill them.

This thrust from a two-dao sovereign could easily destroy a small sect such as Little Diamond. They would be completely powerless to stop him.

In this crucial second, she elegantly swung her blade again. Once again, it lacked flashiness and its dao didn’t show.

Nonetheless, it wielded the efficiency akin to that of a veteran butcher cutting meat - swift and accurate. The arc and angle were flawless, allowing it to solve any incoming attack regardless of their magical transformations.

This was akin to a master capable of destroying a great dam by throwing a rock at the right spot.

“Clank!” Though this thrust was far stronger and faster than the previous one, it still couldn’t overcome her slash.

He was struck by the remnant energy of the slash and was sent flying. Blood gushed out from his chest and stained his robe. It pierced his grand dao and defenses, albeit his life was in no danger. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The scene became silent right away and people became dumbfounded. That thrust earlier was tyrannical and dominating.

They thought that he would be able to turn the tides with this attack. It might not be able to defeat her but should be able to push her back and allow him to regain momentum.

Unfortunately, her elegant slash akin to a calligrapher swinging his brush easily dismantled the thrust.

“Isn’t her strength a little ridiculous?” One disciple asked. This fight was far from being even because Celestial Tiger’s blood was spilled after just three moves.

“They’re both two-dao sovereigns, how is the gap so large?” One youth didn’t understand.

“Their dao are different.” An expert elaborated: “Their cultivation power should be rather even but the same can’t be said about their personal dao. One is either more perfect or the other still has flaws.”

Many understood the situation. It seemed that her saber art was more polished than his spear art. Since their cultivation was even, the strength of their personal dao decided the match.

“Incredible saber art!” The wounded combatant couldn’t help but praise: “Junior Sister, your art is simple yet it contains the mysteries of the dao.” He accepted that his dao couldn’t match up to hers.
