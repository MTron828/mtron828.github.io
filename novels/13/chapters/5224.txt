Chapter 5225: Auction Starting

Eighteen have been reduced to thirteen - a truly unexpected development.

The two founders have kept the path the same since its creation. One could say that this was their ultimate comprehension of this dao. Descendants could follow this path to reach the apex. Furthermore, they might be the only ones capable of changing it.

No other dragon lord had exceeded them in history, not even the brilliant Jue Xian’er and Supreme. Attempting to do so was a foolish and arrogant endeavor.

Alas, the seemingly average Li Qiye had managed to do so, going as far as reducing the images down to thirteen.

In comparison, the previous version seemed needlessly complicated and less attuned to the dao.

“How…” Ye Fantian remained perplexed.

Since her debut, she had been taught by apex conquerors and dao lords. She only needed to focus before understanding Sword Sea Dao Lord’s merit laws despite the difference in cultivation.

She started thinking that her imperial path might be preventing her from seeing the mysteries.

She glanced over at Xiao Qingtian who had a bitter smile. The latter shrugged helplessly, expressing his confusion as well.

“Who is he?” Xiao Qingtian asked.

“He has to be related to Duality Master.” Ye Fantian speculated.

At first, everyone thought that Li Qiye was being ignorant for talking about changing the eighteen images. Now, his success left them speechless and amazed.

After a long while, those from Imperial Gate regained their wits. The ancestors appeared along with their juniors. They came closer and bowed before Li Qiye.

After all, ever since they lost to Suppression Conqueror, they lost sovereignty over their territories including their ancestral land and temples.

Although this was supposed to be temporary, Suppression Conqueror was far more ambitious. Alas, there was nothing they could do due to the presence of powerful dragon lords such as Crocodile and Sanctified Bones.

This man managed to slay these wardens and gave hope to Imperial Gate. This scene made the big shots let out a sentimental sigh.

In the past, Imperial Gate enjoyed prosperity ranging from the era of its founders to most recently, Armor Conqueror.

Once these cultivators were gone, they were suppressed by Suppression Conqueror and Hundred Dao, on the verge of being taken over.

Suddenly, their reflection was cut short by echoing gongs. The clangs could be heard across the upper continents.

“The auction shall commence shortly.” Boss Tang’s lackadaisical voice sounded.

“It’s starting.” Saintess Shao Yao became anxious.

Those in the cities leaped up into the air to get closer to the battleship. This auction included the strongest possible participants so no one wanted to miss it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Brother Qingtian, I’ll be going ahead.” Ye Fantian leaped into the air.

“I’ll tag along.” Xiao Qingtian happily followed her.

***

Jue Xian’er was here early. Ye Fantian sat on the throne for Divine Alliance and Xiao Qingtian did the same for the one reserved for Azure School.

“Seems like I’m a little late.” Another famous figure sat on the throne for Heaven Alliance.

“Li Zhitian is here too.” Everyone stared at the young newcomer who garnered just as much attention as his two peers.

“All three Tians are here, what a monumental event we have today.” An expert murmured.

“It is rare to see them together.” Another said, thinking that this auction was going to be incredible.

The three politely greeted each other but Jue Xian’er didn’t bother standing up. This was her style and no one dared to criticize her for it due to her unpredictable temperament.

“Excuse me.” Alchemy Dao and the others’ throne was occupied by Resplendent Monarch, a clear underdog compared to the others.

Nonetheless, this throne was under the protection of Immortal Pagoda Conqueror so it was kept safe. It was not worth provoking the conqueror just to participate in the auction.

However, others thought that this party had no chance of winning any auction. After all, other competitors were on another level of resources and wealth.
