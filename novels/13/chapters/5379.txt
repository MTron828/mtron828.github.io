Chapter 5380: Only Death

“Buzz.” A portal suddenly appeared next to her as if it had been there the entire time.

“Go!” The trapped Five-sun Conqueror and his men have been waiting for this and immediately traveled through the portal.

“Boom!” It shattered after the survivors made it through.

“!” This certainly caught everyone off guard. However, even a fool could tell that there was a hidden dao portal next to Ye Fantian all along. It must have been costly to prepare such an effective portal.

“Damn!” Some realized what was going on.

“It’s a trap!” A dao lord’s expression darkened.

Myriad Eye Dao Lord and the others understood that they had been baited into this situation.

Sure enough, lightning bolts appeared around Ye Fantian, and it was the worst type - tribulation lightning. No one knew how they got there.

She looked up with a piercing gaze capable of seeing everything between heaven and earth.

“Crack!” A crack appeared all of a sudden. It was as if a window of heaven had been opened and more lightning bolts descended from it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“A heavenly tribulation!” Even the strongest conquerors and dragon lords became aghast.

An apex cultivator knew better than to think they were above the heavenly tribulations. In fact, the stronger the cultivator, the stronger the heavenly tribulation. Thus, a weaker cultivator had a higher chance of surviving these tribulations.

In reality, tribulations didn’t happen often in this epoch. Normal dragon lords and conquerors didn’t have to experience this dangerous event. Exceptions included pioneers or extraordinary apex cultivators.

Nonetheless, its notoriety remained and still scared the hell out of the crowd members. Ancestors didn’t have a chance of surviving, and the same for dao lords and conquerors. They just didn’t understand how Ye Fantian managed to summon one.

She finished the twelve-fruit process earlier and there was no sign of a tribulation. It only started when lightning bolts appeared around her.

“Why is this happening?!” Li Xian’er and Ferocity became alarmed as well.

They noticed that she seemingly opened a window to the heaven earlier. What was her goal? This seemed rather suicidal.

“There’s no surviving this.” The arrogant Ferocity murmured.

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye glanced at the crack in the sky and became amused.

He knew what she wanted to do because he had done it many times previously - this was a favorite game of his. Today, he had no need to resort to this method any longer.

“Boom!” Ye Fantian roared and activated her twelve dao fruits, ready to meet the descending tribulation.

Keep in mind that she was far from being the only one on the battlefield. Myriad Eye and the others were still around so the tribulation also aimed for them.

These survivors of the sword formation were extremely strong. Nonetheless, their expression soured after seeing the tribulation.

As for those on the side of Azure School, they had total confidence at first to deal with all the combatants within the formation’s area of effect.

However, they didn’t expect her to finish the twelve-fruit process so rapidly on top of summoning a tribulation.

They couldn’t run either since they became its targets. The only way to escape from these lightning bolts was to have a heaven-defying method to elude it. Otherwise, it would follow them to the end of the world. Attempting to block it had a higher chance of survival than panicking and running defenselessly.

Of course, not everyone kept their composure. Weaker dragon lords on the side of Dao Alliance and Azure School started running away, unable to stay calm.

“Boom!” Lightning bolts rushed for them.

Although they have activated their strongest merit laws and utilized their best defensive treasures, they weren’t at full strength while fleeing in a panic.

“Ahh!” They were the first to die by the tribulation; their ashes scattered to the wind.
