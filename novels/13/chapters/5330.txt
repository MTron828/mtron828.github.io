Chapter 5331: God of Wealth

Duality Master left after opening Duality World and made it open for everyone. Only one place was personally created by him, a city with the same name.

Using the same analogy of the white paper, he left a mark by a tiny corner while leaving the rest for others.

Many top cultivators chose to stay in Duality City, turning it into the largest city in this region. Later on, average cultivators visited as well. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The majority of cultivators lacked the qualification and power to open their own grotto in Duality World. Thus, the city became an ideal choice.

Its prosperous and lively nature made it a popular destination for both weak and strong cultivators. It became a meeting place for the stronger cultivators who had their own grotto. Moreover, most put aside racial grievances and previous feuds during their stay.

It gave people a chance to broaden their horizons. For example, top cultivators were everywhere.

A conqueror soared in the air while being surrounded by chaos energy and dao laws. Another dao lord rode a carriage and didn’t reveal his aura. Nonetheless, the carriage was made from ancient wood and was pulled by a goldhorn thunder ox.

In fact, some of them even dressed humbly so any old man here could turn out to be an emperor or dao lord.

Li Qiye’s group entered and Li Zhitian found himself to be rather ordinary in this rich city. Geniuses like him didn’t stand out as much.

“Have to see Duality City to know the vastness of the world.” Zhitian said after seeing so many big shots.

One could throw a random stone and hit three conquerors here - a phrase often used to describe Duality City.

Li Qiye seemed to be in a good mood and took a deep breath to enjoy the air. He then led the group inside a shop named Duality.

The characters above the entrance were written casually and looked rather unique.

“One of Duality Master’s few properties.” The old servant said.

“Is Duality Master here right now?” Li Zhitian asked.

“Unfortunately, he is not.” The old servant shook his head.

The shop was rather small but was filled with merchandise on the shelves and on the ground.

Li Zhitian was amazed by what he saw - precious metals and ores were just laying randomly, the same for imperial weapons and merit laws.

An old shopkeeper stood in front of a small shrine and offered three incense sticks while mumbling something.

The statue inside the shrine surprised everyone because it was none other than Li Qiye. It depicted him holding a golden ingot in one hand and a ruyi scepter in the other. It looked a bit comical but this was unmistakably Li Qiye.

This was their second time seeing his statue in just one day. The circumstances were just as strange this time around.

“Venerable God of Wealth, please bless us with prosperous business on this new day.” The old shopkeeper held the incense sticks with both hands and bowed several times before placing them into the incense burner in front of the shrine.

Zhitian was at a loss for words. This shop was really worshipping Li Qiye as a deity of fortune.

As for Li Qiye, he smiled with amusement while watching this.

After finishing the opening rite, the old shopkeeper turned around and saw Li Qiye. He immediately smiled and said: “Wow, today’s a good one, the god of wealth is paying us a visit right after opening.”

This only astounded Li Zhitian even more. The guy worshipped Li Qiye as a god but didn’t have a big reaction after encountering Li Qiye in the flesh.

“What a weird shop.” He murmured.

“Where’s Duality?” Li Qiye asked.

“The boss is still traveling.” The shopkeeper calmly responded.

“You have a statue here that I want.” Li Qiye didn’t inquire further on this subject.

“Give me a second.” The shopkeeper said before taking a statue out from a corner of the shop: “This must be it.”

Zhitian took a look and saw that it was another Heaven’s Allure statue.

“Yes, I want it.” Li Qiye said.

“I would sell this to regular guests for three million conqueror refined jades but since you’re here, it’ll be ten million.” The shopkeeper wiped the dust off the statue.

“Wait, that doesn’t make any sense. Shouldn’t you be treating your God of Wealth better?” Zhitian protested.

“Listen, I’m just following the boss’ orders.” The shopkeeper presented the clean statue to Li Qiye.

“That’s fine. Tell me, who sold it to you?” Li Qiye smiled.

“It will cost another ten million for information.” The shopkeeper stared intensely at Li Qiye.

“Again?” Zhitian thought that this shop was ripping off its customers.

“The boss said that this is no big deal for the God of Wealth.” The shopkeeper said.

Zhitian thought that Duality Master was purposely trying to annoy Li Qiye with these rules. The whole thing just didn’t make sense.

“Sigh, how petty.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Do you want it? If so, this lowly one will wrap it up for you.” The shopkeeper said.

“Of course. I suppose I can give your petty boss a little allowance.” Li Qiye said.

The old servant immediately presented twenty million refined jades without being told by Li Qiye.
