Chapter 4446: Rock Pile

Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Li Qiye didn’t take the water or any of the grass. His focus turned to a pile of rocks.

After fully gathering the grass, the demon god came over and stood next to Li Qiye. He stared at the rock pile as well.

There was nothing special about a bunch of white rocks stacked randomly in this manner. However, he eventually noticed something weird - the rocks were connected with each other.

It seemed as if after the pile was made, they were burned by an unbelievable flame, resulting in the surface melting and fusing together. In other words, contrary to their appearance, they have become a single entity. Each individual rock was crucial to the whole and couldn’t be missed.

He then crouched down in front of it and tapped gently. There was a heavy echo, a sign of calcification.

“Hmm…” He started pondering that this rock was actually a bone.

“Take out your item.” Li Qiye ordered.

He immediately took out the treasure box with an incredible seal. The power stemming from it was ancient and seemingly unbeatable. The content inside must be nothing short of amazing because the seal itself was rather precious. Only a top master could do something like this.

He had a respectful expression, not because of Li Qiye but rather, the box. This was something left behind by Space Dragon Emperor - an heirloom of Dragon.

It wasn’t quite a treasure because no one in Dragon has been able to understand the thing inside. Nonetheless, they still revered it due to its prestigious origin.

Space Dragon Emperor personally sealed it in Dragon Platform. How many treasures were worthy of this?

Li Qiye demanded it a while ago and he yielded, accepting all responsibilities. He knew that they had no chance of stopping him in the first place.

The only difference between handing it over and fighting was the number of dead disciples. Dragon might turn to ashes as a result.

Li Qiye accepted the box and formed a mudra. A pulsing light manifested and opened the seal on the box.

The demon didn’t know what to say after seeing this. The seal required a special incantational mudra to open. This was a secret from Dragon only known by a few.

Without this mudra, no outsider would be able to open the box. This wasn’t the case for Li Qiye at all. He did it faster and easier than some of Dragon’s ancestors while not knowing the special incantation.

He took out the item inside and this made the demon realize something.

“I see, I get it now.” The latter said.

The thing inside was hard to describe. It had a long shape with random warpings and a white hue. He didn’t think that it was a bone until now with the rock pile in front of him.

The heirloom turned out to be something similar to the fused bones, consisting of dozens of “rocks” being melted together.

Li Qiye sat down and pressed the heirloom into the pile of rock. It turned out that this thing was a perfect match and made the rock pile complete.

“So the progenitor came here before.” The demon understood the use of his sect’s heirloom.

It wasn’t a treasure but a part of this rock pile. Perhaps this was the key to the more important part. This was the reason why they couldn’t figure out the item - its incomplete nature.

“Not just your Space Dragon Emperor, others have visited this place too.” Li Qiye said.

“Others? The top dao lords such as Sword Queen?” He asked. From his knowledge, top dao lords such as Sword Queen and Nine-wheel were the most likely to come here.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer.

“I’m guessing our heirloom is the key, how come he didn’t open this place for a chance at immortality?” He was curious about this issue.

If top beings have come here, they certainly noticed the biggest clue as well. Most importantly, his progenitor might be the first one here after the battle between Feng Qi and Jiu Bian. He even took away part of the rock pile and removed everyone’s chances.

Why did he do it? And what about the others? All of these top beings desired immortality. Why didn’t they take advantage of this opportunity?

If they had done it, the world would have known of their wondrous tale and legends would have started.
