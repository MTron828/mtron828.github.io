Chapter 4220: Pierced

This technique seemed rather simple - just a straight thrust into the throat. There was no transformation and variation yet still unstoppable and unavoidable.

The impeccable movement of Peace Ocean and spatial steps of Void couldn’t deliver them away from the sword. It maintained the same distance from their throat regardless of their attempt.

The same thing would apply to the top evasive techniques in history, let alone two young cultivators.

As a result, the crowd’s astonishment only grew with time.

“Which sword art is this?” No one had an idea about the origin of Li Qiye’s attack.

For the swordmasters here, they believed that even the most profound sword laws could be solved. This didn’t seem to be the case.

It had nothing to do with the duo’s incapability. The sword simply stuck to them like maggots on bones.

“How did he do it?” A top master had no words to describe the level of the attack.

“Distance doesn’t matter.” A big shot elaborated: “This contains both the mysteries of the sword and space-time affinities. Those capable of fusing these affinities are rare in Sword Continent, let alone a youth.”

Some spectators instinctively touched their throat while watching the inescapable blade, thinking that it could cut them down whenever as well.

Meanwhile, Void and Peace Ocean continued doing everything they could to run away.

“Drown the Heaven!” Peace Ocean roared and Vastsea became resplendent with lightning bolts and sword energies.

Waves began rushing up in the air, one higher than the previous. This created a region of hell where no living beings could live. Time and space crumbled as well; even gods and devils would be decapitated.

He focused on trying to take down Li Qiye’s blade. After bright flashes, fiery sparks shot out like meteors in a magnificent yet frightening display.

Keep in mind that it was Vastsea versus a regular sword. The latter somehow managed to survive the waves without breaking.

“Ridiculous!” Jaws dropped to the ground after seeing this.

“That sword is withstanding Vastsea! This can’t be happening!” Many had no answer for this.

Everyone knew the power of heavenly swords. Even supreme treasures couldn’t stop them, let alone Li Qiye’s current weapon.

“That thing can stop Vastsea?” Ning Zhu and Xu Yiyun were shaken as well. Their swords were top treasures but would still be beaten by Vastsea, eventually being cut to pieces.

“A peerless sword dao, virtually indestructible.” Tie Jian said softly.

“Yes, it’s not an issue of swords. That is no longer a sword.” A’zhi nodded.

Tie Jian and A’zhi have reached a level high enough to see some clues. It had nothing to do with the regular sword; Li Qiye’s sword dao was the key point here, capable of chasing the duo while withstanding the barrage of a heavenly sword.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Myriad Accumulation!” Void eventually gave up on running. He placed his palms together to form a mudra.

Light of the World appeared in front of his chest and released a blinding radiance. Worlds and dimensions came together within the half-an-inch between his throat and the sword.

Three thousand worlds and the yin-yang affinities created an unsurpassable space barrier. Thus, in order to get to Void, Li Qiye’s sword must travel through all these worlds and dimensions.

Void, once again, proved himself to be a master of spatial manipulation. His skill has surpassed many ancestors from the last generation.

“Boom!” This barrier was still not enough to stop Li Qiye’s attack.

The blade pierced through three thousand worlds and all the dimensions. It finally stopped playing around and cut his neck, causing blood to gush and the youth to fall on the ground.

On the other side, the radiance of Vastsea was as destructive as ever, nearly flipping the world over. Peace Ocean mustered all of his strength for a last-ditch attempt.

“Ah!” He managed to push the blade downward, diverting the thrust into his chest instead of his throat.

With just one effortless move from Li Qiye, Void’s fate became unknown while Peace Ocean had a bloody hole on his chest.
