Chapter 5279: Disappeared

What could be better than basking in the sun after filling one’s stomach? Life and death didn’t seem to matter that much if one could live like this even after death.

The group forgot their reason for coming here. Perhaps it no longer mattered.

After a long while, faint cries could be heard, seemingly coming from a little girl. Everyone heard it clearly, unable to restrain their emotion.

“I think a girl is crying.” Li Zhitian stood up.

“Little grandson, don’t go anywhere.” The man in crimson stopped him.

“Uh…” Li Zhitian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This man kept on addressing him with disrespect. Nonetheless, he obeyed and sat back down.

The cries continued. The old servant listened carefully, not wanting to miss a single detail.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t care, still relaxing like the rest of the group.

“I have to sunbathe too.” The old man in the corner lay down and enjoyed himself while keeping a distance from everyone.

The gentle warmth of the sun was unforgettable. Worries and other attachments were no longer important - only this moment.

The group fell asleep. After an unknown period of time, Li Qiye slowly got up.

He told the old servant, Li Zhitian, and True Bear to leave quietly, not wanting to disturb the sleeping group.

As they walked through the city, they found a serene silence. All the inhabitants seemed to be taking a nap as well.

They made it to the gate and left for the desert once more - a land of sand with no end in sight, only scattered gigantic skeletons.

The sun outside was somehow different than the one they enjoyed back in the city. This intense heat scorched their skin and could make them faint.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After taking a few steps, Li Zhitian looked back and no longer saw the city.

“It’s not there anymore.” He only saw endless sand behind him: “The entire city is gone.”

If he hadn’t spent time there, he could have considered it as a mirage. However, it felt so real to him.

“Of course it is not there, it doesn’t exist.” Li Qiye didn’t bother turning around.

“Doesn’t exist? We were inside just now.” Li Zhitian became startled.

“Experience doesn’t mean reality.” Li Qiye responded and continued onward.

In reality, Li Zhitian suspected as much during his time there. Nonetheless, this was still a shocking confirmation.

“Truly bizarre.” He murmured.

“This might be one of the most memorable events in your life, and it will help you understand many things.” Li Qiye added.

“I see.” Li Zhitian responded and agreed regarding these strange occurrences.

“Do the spirits remain after death?” The old servant spoke more than usual.

“You’re giving me goosebumps, Uncle.” Li Zhitian smiled.

“You weren’t scared hanging out with a bunch of dead people, why are you afraid now in broad daylight?” Li Qiye chuckled.

Li Zhitian couldn’t answer because everything prior felt so real even when he activated his heavenly gaze.

However, the cries of the little girl still echoed inside their eyes.

“You guys all hear this too, right?” Li Zhitian stopped and said.

“Yes.” The old servant said.

“Is she actually alive?” Li Zhitian became curious.

“The living does not dwell here.” Li Qiye said.

“Why is it crying? And what is it?” Li Zhitian asked while having an ominous feeling as if something was staring at him.

“If it’s here, it’s nothing good.” Li Qiye responded.

The cries continued regardless of how far they have gone.

“Shouldn’t we take a look?” Eventually, Li Zhitian couldn’t handle it any longer after having a guilty conscience. He knew that these cries in this desolate desert weren’t normal but they were calling him.
