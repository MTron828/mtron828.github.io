Chapter 4782: Another Immortal Monarch

Who wouldn’t want to take a look at a heavenly treasure? Even if they couldn’t obtain it, just taking a look meant gaining a great story to be retold in the future.

After all, these treasures were believed to be mythical or mere fabrications. This was the opportunity of a lifetime.

Of course, they didn’t dare to request this directly from Li Qiye due to the difference in status and power.

“Why should I let you take a look?” Li Qiye smiled.

“No one has seen them before while you are blessed by the heaven to obtain this supreme fortune. The world would praise you for your generosity if you were to do so. Your name would be part of many songs.” Six-dao Monarch said.

“We know we are overstepping our bounds.” Dao Sanqian added: “We respectfully await your decision and just want everyone to experience a monumental event, nothing more.”

If the crowd had to pick a side, they would pick the duo because they also wanted to take a look.

“Sounds rather noble of you two. Is it actually sincere though?” Li Qiye chuckled.

His contempt was met with nothing but acceptance. Though these two were top existences, they couldn’t actually do anything to him.

“Dao Brother, you are out of line here. Our True Immortal Sect has been working for everyone’s sake all this time. Our progenitor spread the dao and help build Eight Desolaces. Our aspiration lies in making the world a better place.”

He spoke powerfully and convincingly. As for the listeners, those who knew history would disagree with him. True Immortal had done its fair share of bullying others.

“Your sect isn’t worthy of your description.” Li Qiye said.

Six-dao Monarch’s expression soured. No one had the tolerance to withstand repeatedly insults, let alone an ancient ancestor like him. He couldn’t put on a smile and let the guy insult his sect as well.

“It’s been a long time since I’ve last heard someone criticize our sect.” An ethereal voice interjected.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Everyone looked around but couldn’t find the source of the voice. It seemed to be coming from the horizon yet they could hear it clearly.

“Poof!” Strands of smoke appeared not far from Six-dao Monarch, seemingly coming out of nowhere.

They condensed together to form a figure - a man wearing an ancient official uniform. Others couldn’t pinpoint a particular era to this style.

He floated like a ghost, capable of appearing in any location. Nothing in the world could hinder his path.

He had hidden his aura yet the crowd could still sense his power. Despite his fragile nature, they knew that he could drag the world and force it to follow his momentum. One could say that the ruler of hell should have this appearance, that he could command countless souls to devour Eight Desolaces.

They could actually imagine his body somehow opening into the shape of a mouth and swallowing all living beings. Fear immediately overwhelmed them.

“Who is he?” Experts and ancestors wondered. They only knew that he was an ancient ancestor of True Immortal.

“Ancestor.” Six-dao Monarch respectfully greeted him.

“!!” The crowd became slack-jawed because this man seemed to have a higher status than even Six-dao Monarch.

“This must be one of their rare surviving monarchs from the olden days.” An ancient ancestor had a good idea of the man’s identity.

“Specter Monarch, you’re here too.” Dan Sanqian greeted.

“Specter?” The crowd found this title unfamiliar. Only a few ancient ancestors became startled.

“Specter, a direct disciple of Blessed Monarch, one of the ten geniuses under him.” A high ancestor gasped.

The group around him exchanged glances.

“The generation of Blessed Dao Lord was brilliant with numerous talents. However, he still stood out among them.” The high ancestor continued: “Moreover, he also preached the dao frequently in his master’s stead. The progenitors of many current powers benefited greatly from listening and formed their sect afterward. He taught his fellow brothers and sisters as well, this included Worldraiser Dao Lord. In fact, he might have become the successor due to Specter Monarch’s support.”

Everyone knew that although Worldraiser was a direct disciple of Blessed, his talent was one of the worst, not to mention a late dao debut. However, he was still chosen by Blessed as the successor of a great behemoth - a rather unconventional and puzzling decision.
