Chapter 4146: Eight-hundred Li Court

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Most believed that Eight-hundred Li is only second to Dark Gale Camp. Though it wasn’t as old as Tortoise Monarch Island, it was still extremely strong. [1]

Their island lord, Eight-hundred Commander, was a ferocious monster - famous even before joining the lake.

Rumor has it that he was abandoned by his clan. This led him down on an evil path and eventually, he was pursued by many powers. This necessitated hiding in Cloud Dream Lake.

Dark Gale approved and supported him. Later on, he took over the island and called himself Eight-hundred Commander. His actual name and origin couldn’t be traced.

“Boom!” The bandits from Eight-hundred Li Court mustered all of their forces as they marched towards Dark Dragon Island.

The other islands also obeyed the command and marched as well.

“Eight-hundred Li is quite influential.” One expert became startled: “They’re all listening to Eight-hundred Commander, will this be okay?”

“Not everyone, Dark Gale and Tortoise Monarch aren’t mobilizing. They only have fifteen islands with them.” An older cultivator observed carefully and analyzed.

“Right, those two aren’t answering the clarion call.” An elder nodded in agreement.

An expert in the region said: “Eight-hundred Li is quite domineering here, only Dark Gale Camp can command them, but keep in mind that Tortoise Monarch might not be weaker at all. It’s just that the latter has little interest in criminal activities. Their leader is special as well since he’s the oldest ancestor here. Not even Cloud Dream King can command him, let alone Eight-hundred Commander.”

“Really?” Another was skeptical.

Another ancestor chimed in: “That sounds about right. Tortoise Monarch is technically under Dark Gale’s jurisdiction but since he’s the oldest, even Cloud Dream King is his junior. Rumor has it that the monarch has a great relationship with Nightloom, that they’re on the same level.”

“I see, no wonder why it’s so peaceful and prosperous there.” A merchant nodded.

Meanwhile, more explosions came from all directions as bandits surrounded Dark Dragon Island. This was quite an impressive and diverse group - humans, demons, heavenly devils, even sky spirits… 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The situation looked quite dire for Dark Dragon Island at this point.

“On guard!” Crimsondeath Monarch ordered his men to guard the important locations and gates.

He didn’t waste time during the short occupation and had built a mighty defensive line.

“Crimnsondeath is quite capable.” One expert noted: “He would do a much better job than the previous leader of Dark Dragon Island.”

“Crimsondeath Monarch, surrender. Realize how futile it is to oppose us.” Eight-hundred Commander roared.

Crimsondeath ignored him and continued to order his men.

“Ready the siege.” The commander shouted and the bandits unsheathed their weapons with great momentum.

This was clearly an uneven fight. The bandits had the number and power advantage.

“He can turn the island into a fortress of steel and it still wouldn’t be enough. This siege won’t take long.” An ancient ancestor said.

“Yes, this is all in vain.” Another added.

“Formation!” A resounding voice came from within the island.

“Clank!” Sword glints illuminated the island and the night sky. It soared upward in a dominant manner and released countless sword energies.

Its torrential devastation shocked both spectators and bandits alike.

Waves of sword formations gathered above the island and turned into an all-encompassing ocean. It was brimming with battle intent; even a trespassing god would be slain.

“I’ve never seen this sword formation before.” Astonishment struck the crowd.

“The sheer power and scale… this can’t be created by unknown or rootless cultivators. Only a dao lord lineage has access to this…” A knowledgeable ancestor took a deep breath.

Sword formations could be more frightening than merit laws. A top-level one normally came from a prestigious sect. Ordinary cultivators couldn’t create one.

As for this one, it should be created by a dao lord. The members activating the formation were well-trained too.

“Crimsondeath Monarch created this?” One high elder said.

In terms of raw power, Crimsondeath was actually well-received in Sword Continent. Alas, the crowd didn’t think he could create this formation.

“I know that Li Qiye has a group of master swordsmen working for him. I wonder where they came from.” Someone who watched the fight at Dark Dragon Island said.

He was indeed correct. The ones creating the formation were members of Tie Jian’s sect.

“Prepare formations for battle.” Eight-hundred Commander became serious after seeing the sword barriers.

“Kill them!” However, Tie Jian’s side didn’t give them time to set up and went on the offensive. Swords rained down on the enemies.

“Go!” The fifteen island lords had to fight without formations.

Meanwhile, Abyss Scion took one step forward and threatened: “Li Qiye, it’s not too late to grow a brain.”
