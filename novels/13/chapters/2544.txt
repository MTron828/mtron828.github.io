Li Qiye has been inside for a long time so the group became restless.

“Is he okay?” This wasn’t Wild Bull’s first time asking this question during the wait.

“The young noble will be fine due to his power level. Even if he can’t get all the way down, leaving is just fine. You’ve tried before too and came out unscathed.” The scholar replied.

“Sigh, don’t bring it up again. I instinctively felt something was wrong and ran. If it wasn’t for Ill Lord suppressing me right away outside, I would have gone crazy for sure.” Wild Bull still looked scared because that was one of the roughest moments in his life.

“In my opinion, the young noble should be able to deal with the murderous intent, but will he be able to handle the surge of rage?” Golden Dragon became worried: “It’s a mental attack and has nothing to do with power. Just the dao heart matters there.”

The group naturally worried about Li Qiye’s safety because they placed all of their hopes on him. If anything were to happen to the guy, they would no longer have a chance to leave this place alive.

“The young noble is a bit young but to reach that level, his dao heart must be far stronger than ours. He’ll be able to handle it.” The lady said: “Even if he can’t, he’ll still come out just fine. Remember, even the likes of us can leave the pit, let alone him.”

“I’m just afraid he’ll try to persevere for too long. Many have died in this place because they were too stubborn and eventually succumbed to their heart demon.” Golden Dragon was still worried.

“Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.” Ill Lord was calmer in comparison, having full confidence in Li Qiye.

“Since the young noble dares to go in, he should be very certain of success.” Ill Lord stared at the pit and continued: “Someone of his level can handle far worse dao and surely wouldn’t attempt something deemed to be suicidal.”

The group felt much better as if they have just taken a calming pill. Li Qiye surely wouldn’t have been dumb enough to try something he wasn’t sure of.

“Just wait, be patient.” Ill Lord said.

Li Qiye continued on. The pit seemed to be bottomless with numerous skeletons on the way down. These were the experts who have tried to explore this place, only to die here.

The deeper he went, the fewer corpses he saw. The murderous energy and mental attack gradually increased so those who have made it this far were incredible masters.

The murderous energy eventually acted like blades lacerating the flesh. Even with powerful defensive treasures, one still couldn’t handle its crushing power. One could be crushed to pieces at any moment.

Only someone as strong as Li Qiye could withstand its destructive might. He still walked normally without a problem.

The mental attack became fiercer. After reaching a certain depth, people would start to feel the rage of this land that could erupt at any moment - endless howlings and screams of anger.

He eventually made it to his destination and found another medium-sized pit within. Its depth far exceeded its radius. It has also been burned by a terrible true fire. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Rumble!” Continuous detonations occurred once he got close enough. The entire place shook as a result.

This hole was the origin of rage and murderous intent but Li Qiye still jumped down without any hesitation.

His ultimate defenses rendered him invulnerable to both of these offensive affinities.

When his feet touched the ground, the first thing he saw was a skeleton.

Judging by the skeleton, the person must have been tall and sturdy. The bones were yellow now from decaying.

Li Qiye finally found the two affinities exuding from this skeleton. Perhaps before death, this being was the embodiment of rage and madness. It unwillingly wanted to rush out of this place and tear the heaven and earth asunder. Unfortunately, escaping was impossible.

His attention turned towards an iron chain of a crimson color. It seemed to be ravaged by the terrible fire millions of years ago but the heat still remained.

He got closer and saw that it was pinned to the ground, perhaps to the deepest crevices and became one with the earth.

The other part of the chain coiled around the skeleton with the end drilling through the heart.

Li Qiye nodded approvingly: “Quite capable, a body seal and a true fate seal. No, even the dao heart is sealed. It’s impossible to take off this chain unless the prisoner is an immortal being, capable of starting over after destroying everything.”

It’s clear whoever inserted this chain was amazing. This method was simply heaven-defying.

Of course, the victim here was also an incredible existence. Otherwise, one wouldn’t spend so much effort on this sealing method. A weakling could be suppressed with simpler methods.

It became clear to Li Qiye how this pit came into form. The prisoner didn’t wish to be locked here forever and used the most terrible fire to burn the iron chain. Unfortunately, years passed by and the chain won. The great pit was the result.

The chain was connected to the ground, becoming one with this physical entity. It was virtually impossible to burn the other end of the chain. The prisoner eventually died from old age in this place.

Li Qiye squatted down for a closer look. This iron chain wasn’t that special at first glance but now, he could see the numerous laws intertwining to form the individual links. Embedded within the laws were the rarest immortal metals. Even one speck was priceless.

Creating this iron chain must have taken tremendous effort.

“Clank!” Li Qiye held the chain and the end coiling around the skeleton immediately loosened.

“Clank!!” The other end that was one with the ground started shrinking backward, almost like a spirit serpent.

It became a tiny chain that could sway to the wind, not quite heavy. Who would have thought that this iron chain had once sealed a terrifying existence until death in this place?

“Simply incredible.” Li Qiye praised. Only two or three people in the entire history of Three Immortals could have created this chain.

He put it away without any hesitation since such a great item could be useful in the future.

Finally, his eyes became profound. He started sweeping through the myriad realms of the three worlds, not allowing anything to hide from his gaze.

After several full sweeps, he stopped on the skull of the skeleton and smiled.

“I see, excuse me then.” Li Qiye placed his palm on the skeleton.

“Pop!” The skull started changing.

Space and time started twisting in a chaotic manner. The physical contacted allowed him to spy into a different world.

Spatial ripples continued to spread. Li Qiye’s body and the area around him started bending in a strange manner in multiple places.
