Chapter 5094: Not Up To Me

“It depends on the culprit’s ambition.” Li Qiye smiled: “Do you think the alliances will send someone down?”

First, descending was rather challenging. Ordinary cultivators didn’t dream of it because no sects would be willing to pay the price.

Normally, only conquerors and dao lords could make the trip, and this was precisely the problem.

First, the cost of using precious materials to fuel the trip. Second, the visitors didn’t wish to linger for long.

The dao power and chaos true energy in the lower continents were far from pure. This had an adverse effect on the visitors’ grand dao.

After returning to the upper continents, they would have to spend time refining and removing the impurities. This was far from a quick process so it was not worth it for them.

Few of them ever made the trip back down. Eight-stallion Dao Lord was one example but this was because of his plan.

“Yes.” She said with conviction since she knew about Celestial Court: “They know that you have the item so even the immortal continent will send people down.”

“They don’t have to since I’ll be paying them a visit soon enough.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Do as you please.” She said, aware that she was a fish on the chopping board. She had no cards to negotiate with against Li Qiye.

“What do you think would have happened if you had fallen into the ambusher’s hands?” Li Qiye seemed amused.

“That is not up to me.” She said without fear. Of course, she would prefer to be captured by Li Qiye. Intuition told her that he would at least give her a quick death.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye nodded: “You would have been drained dry but it seems that the plan is more ambitious.”

“A conqueror.” She decided to tell him: “A relatively recent one too yet stronger than me at my prime.”

Anyone else would be shocked to hear this. She was the strongest conqueror right now with seven fruits. However, this mysterious conqueror was even stronger? The person should have at least eight fruits then.

“I know, and that’s why it’s interesting. A conqueror, not a dao lord.” Li Qiye said.

She didn’t say anything else because in reality, she had nothing more to say.

“Do you think I should kill you?” He asked.

“Make your move, the outcome is decided.” She closed her eyes. A swift death was the best option for her right now.

She didn’t fear death due to her previous experiences. She had killed plenty of cultivators and now, it was her time.

However, Li Qiye only stood there and stared at her.

She opened her eyes and said: “What are you waiting for? Or do you want me to end it myself?”

“Your life means nothing to me. Whether you’re dead or alive has no effect.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You don’t wish to avenge Eight-stallion Dao Lord or get rid of an enemy?” She was surprised.

“You think too highly of yourself then. First, you’re not qualified to be considered an enemy. As for Eight-stallion, that was his own business and he does not need me to avenge him.” Li Qiye smiled.

She sat in a daze as she thought about it. Others thought that they were enemies similar to her and Eight-stallion Dao Lord back then.

An enemy would naturally want to get rid of her, given her talent and potential. Alas, this was not enough for her to be of note to Li Qiye.

“I’ve overestimated myself.” She nodded and said: “I’ll end myself then.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It was too easy for Li Qiye to kill her so doing it herself was more dignified.

“I don’t want to kill you, there’s no benefit in it for me.” Li Qiye shrugged.

She heard this and suddenly had a ridiculous feeling. In Li Qiye’s eyes, she was no different from a speck of dust. Her existence had no effect on his own. It didn’t matter if she were to stay alive and seek revenge one day. She had no chance of killing him either way; the disparity was insurmountable. Even if she could get on the path of reaching the truth, she would still only be an ant.

“I understand now.” She nodded after coming to this realization.
