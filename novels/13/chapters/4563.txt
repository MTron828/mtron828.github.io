Chapter 4564: Rage

“Little bastard, how dare you!” A thunderous voice detonated in everyone’s mind.

Next came a frightening aura that swept through the area like a tsunami, rendering everyone breathless.

It came from none other than True Immortal Sect Master. He has yet to activate his true power yet the crowd had a hard time being in his presence. This was akin to being smashed by a thousand mountains at the same time.

They felt their vitality and internal organs being affected. Weaker cultivators spat out a mouthful of blood for this was the wrath of a true master whom disciple had just been murmured in public.

Not to mention someone of his status, no cultivator could stand for this humiliation of a lifetime.

“Buzz.” He became radiant. Each ray exuded from him looked like it belonged to the start of the world. These were world-founding rays, capable of pioneering new existences. They were naturally destructive as well.

Even ancestors among the crowd were shaken by his display of might. By this point, the weak dropped to the ground, unable to stand up.

Some of them couldn’t bear the pressure and felt as if their bones were breaking. Creaks could be heard all over their body.

“He’s about to attack.” Everyone became nervous.

Though he couldn’t compare to the invincible ancestors from his sect, he was far stronger than the majority of external ancestors.

The crowd became frightened because his wrath could end with a massacre. Sects and clans could go down as a result.

“He’ll murder this brat.” Most believed that it was over for Li Qiye.

“That’s not enough to quell his rage. He might destroy his entire clan, everyone who is related to him is about to be very unlucky.” A last-gen expert murmured. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It wasn’t difficult for True Immortal to take down another great power at all.

“Brat, you seek oblivion and you shall have it.” The sect master’s eyes became murderous despite his tone being relatively calm. However, this calmness only creeped out listeners and made them shudder.

As for Li Qiye, he only glanced at the sect master without caring too much.

“Sect Master, please calm down. Your disciple attacked first, his death can only be blamed on his lack of skill.” Si Jingru calmly said.

This only added to the crowd’s interest in this feud. No one else would dare to talk to the sect master of True Immortal in this manner since they would be taken down with Li Qiye.

However, the priestess of Ancestral Divine Temple had plenty of authority and influence. Moreover, she was completely right.

Six-winged Emissary tried to seize the golden egg and was killed in the process. His death was due to his greed and weakness; he certainly didn’t have the moral high ground here.

She clearly acted as Li Qiye’s supporter, and having her as an ally was quite effective.

The sect master’s eyes only grew colder. His gaze seemingly became physical, capable of piercing the soul and destroying the true fate.

Si Jingru showed no sign of fear and met his gaze directly. His pressure had a limited effect on her - a testament to her power.

She stood above the rest of the young generation; her fame wasn’t empty.

“Priestess, the matter here has nothing to do with Ancestral Divine Temple.” The sect master spoke in a commanding manner, expressing how serious he was.

Others would be wise enough to back off after hearing his tone. They might even tremble in fear.

Si Jingru calmly answered: “You are incorrect, Sect Master. If you insist on being stubborn, I’ll have you know at the young noble’s problems are our problems.”

This froze the crowd for a moment. With that statement, it meant that even the temple was supporting Li Qiye.

“Priestess, do you represent yourself or Ancestral Divine Temple?” The sect master coldly uttered. Each word could kill a man from the emanating pressure.

“As its priestess, I naturally speak for the temple.” Si Jingru responded.

“!!!” Her confirmation startled the crowd. The temple didn’t mind opposing True Immortal just to back Li Qiye up? This included him declaring war on True Immortal?

Everything became different then. Since Li Qiye had such a strong backer now, people would need to think twice before offending him.

Henceforth, antagonizing Li Qiye meant antagonizing Ancestral Divine Temple.
