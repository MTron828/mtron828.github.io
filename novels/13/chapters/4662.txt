Chapter 4663: The Mortal Dao

“The heavenly dao is eternal while the mortal dao is boundless.” Li Qiye gazed at the horizon and said.

The old man repeated the phrase before asking: “Is your pursuit considered the mortal dao, Sir?”

“I search for neither the heavenly or the mortal dao, only the truth. Once reaching this state, the dao shall be me and vice versa.”

“I see…” The old man realized something and glanced over at Worldbreaker.

After a long while, he sighed and said: “Looks like I need to jump out and travel farther.”

“Can you do it?” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man contemplated and said: “Difficult but as long as there is a will, it should be possible given enough effort.”

“It would be a magnificent feat to be remembered.” Li Qiye nodded: “How many have been able to do so before? Even the most brilliant characters usually resort to the conventional path.”

“That’s the easiest and the most established way to seek the dao.” The old man sentimentally said.

“What about you?” Li Qiye asked.

The old man stared at Worldbreaker, capable of seeing the entire thing. However, he didn’t answer right away.

“You need a reason.” Li Qiye added.

“Right.” The old man admitted: “I’ve already walked the world and found it unimpressive.”

“You don’t think it is worth your effort.” Li Qiye understood.

“Yes, it is full of disappointments.” The old man nodded and paused for a moment before asking: “I’ve heard that there is another sky above Eight Desolaces, an entirely different world. May I ask your opinion on it?”

Li Qiye looked up and smiled: “That depends on what you want to know. The worlds of mortals are always the same everywhere. Living beings always have emotions. They love deeply and hate just as much. They also succumb to greed enough to kill. Yes, all are the same unless one strives to be different.”

“Strive to be different.” The old man’s expression became brighter.

“These unique souls aren’t special because of their birthplace. It matters not if it is Eight Desolaces or the sky above, or something even beyond.” Li Qiye added.

“I understand. To meet someone like that…” His eyes became bright as well.

“It would be a blessing to meet and cultivate with such a person. The dao chosen no longer matters in that case, whether it be a heavenly or immortal dao.” Li Qiye said.

“I see.” The old man murmured.

“With that, you yourself will become special as well.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

“I can’t disagree.” The old man said.

Li Qiye smiled and stared at the lake.

Meanwhile, Jian Ming and the daoist exchanged glances. The conversation was foreign to them since they weren’t at the right level. They were no fools and had ample knowledge. Nonetheless, they couldn’t grasp the true meaning behind it.

“Sir, you said that you cultivate to search for the truth?” The old man asked sincerely.

“Mmm, not quite. I do not seek everlastingness of the heavenly dao or the boundless mortal dao. It is my wish, so I carry it out. Rather simple, no?” Li Qiye shook his head.

The old man listened attentively before smilingly wryly: “I have yet to reach your unreachable level, Sir. I was even more ordinary during my youth, seeking nothing but revenge.”

“All beings were ordinary once.” Li Qiye said: “No one is born an immortal in this world.”

“Well said.” The old man praised.

“If you wish to leave, you need to ask yourself first and find the reason why.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Mmm…” This required inner reflection so the old man didn’t answer right away.

The water was calm and no fish was biting. He pondered meticulously before answering: “My initial reason for cultivation was to grow stronger to carry out my responsibilities. After a certain event, my wish was to grow stronger for the sake of vengeance.”

He paused and became sentimental: “The years passed by in a hurry and now, all the feud and hatred are gone. That’s why it’s hard for me to answer your question.”

“You require a goal and an indomitable dao heart. Your answer is not about the living beings, not the high heaven, and not the grand dao. You seek the other shore, one that is your own and one that can save you.” Li Qiye commented.

The old man fell into rumination after hearing this. After a long while, he regained his wits and bowed deeply: “Your teachings here are more valuable than a lifetime of cultivation. I have been enlightened.”

Li Qiye smiled and accepted his grand gesture.

“When will you be going on your way, Sir?” The old man asked.

“I’m not sure, there isn’t a definite date. If you wish to travel, prepare sufficiently first.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand.” The old man said: “I will keep your guidance to heart. If you ever need my service, just say the word.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“We’re out of wine, it’s time for me to leave then.” Li Qiye said with a smile and then got up.

The old man hurriedly got up and kept his head lowered to show respect.

Once they were out of the lake, Jian Ming said: “He’s a fist slave.”

Initially, the duo found the old man strange since he spent his time so leisurely in Worldbreaker. Even the top masters didn’t dare to do so but the old man acted as if this was his home.

As time went on, it became abundantly clear that he was a fist slave. The intents here no longer affected him.

“Yes, and an extremely strong one at that, capable of sweeping through the world.” The daoist said.

“Few in Eight Desolaces are stronger than him. The six heavenly monarchs or whatever, not even comparable.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“He’s that strong? What about Dao Sanqian?” Jian Ming asked.

“I haven’t met Dao Sanqian but I’m sure that he’s stronger.” Li Qiye said.

“What the hell?” Jian Ming didn’t expect this answer: “Who did we just meet? The legendary Golden Divine Fist?”

“If that was him, then it’s possible.” The daoist said.

Ye Zuodao was a monstrous existence before becoming a fist slave, serving as the lord of Golden City.

After entering Worldbreaker, he started his own sect - something far harder compared to the outside world since starting a sect meant being able to oppose Divine Fist Dynasty. Golden Divine Fist was able to do just that.

Furthermore, there was concrete evidence of his power.

Five-sun Dao Lord led an expedition against Worldbreaker but Golden Divine Fist alone stopped them at the entrance. Though he certainly had an advantage while being in Worldbreaker, this was still a testament of his power.
