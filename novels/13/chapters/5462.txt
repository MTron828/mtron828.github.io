Chapter 5463: Scrap Metals From Celestial Court

“Sir, we are ready for another lesson.” Supreme and Immortal Pagoda exchanged glances before preparing for battle.

Supreme stood with Heaven Alliance and Immortal Pagoda was with Divine Alliance.

“Gentlemen, are we as one?” Supreme glanced at his fellow members.

“To the death!” They shouted in unison.

“Yes, to the death!” Supreme roared back in high morale.

“Please lend me a hand.” Immortal Pagoda told the remnants of Divine Alliance.

“We shall do our best, Divine Alliance will never falter!” Their morale seemed high as well after becoming a part of Celestial Court.

“Very well.” Immortal Pagoda always looked magnificent whether in victory or defeat. His aura and presence didn’t wane in the slightest.

They once again focused on controlling the tower and the hook, shifting them away from the prisoners.

All-things and the others heaved a sigh of relief. They moved away from the battlefield instead of helping Li Qiye since he didn’t need them. Doing so might only annoy him.

“Sir, I’m afraid we will have to offend you. I hope you understand since this is a fight to the death.” Supreme entered the formation controlling Celestial Tower.

“No need for apologies, I don’t mind sending all of you to the next journey.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We’ll get started then.” Supreme understood how precarious this would be but they were determined to continue.

“Kill!” Immortal Pagoda controlled the hook with all of his power.

“Kill!” The members from both alliances let out a rallying cry as well.

“Boom!” The eruption of their power and vitality was a sight to behold.

Just a single conqueror alone could leave everyone breathless. All of them channeling at the same time stretched out the fabrics of space and reality.

The tower became resplendent; its mere presence alone became unbearable for anyone beneath. No cultivators could stay alive while being targeted.

The hook, on the other hand, lacked flashiness but made up for this in sharpness. Its glint alone could reap the lives of conquerors and dao lords.

The two artifacts reached their strongest state, capable of blowing through stars as if they were straw boats.

Mortals and cultivators in the upper continents were paralyzed on the ground, lacking the strength and courage to face this terrifying disaster. They felt as if an apocalypse was incoming. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Go!” Supreme and Immortal Pagoda attacked Li Qiye in unison.

The tower was the first to fly toward his position. The space around him didn’t just collapse but melted into nothingness. Being reduced to ashes and pieces still meant existing in some ways. This was a complete erasure of everything around him.

The hook appeared at the same time, resembling the scythe of a death god - sharp enough to cut down top cultivators like tofu.

“Boom!” Time came to a stop as Li Qiye did the impossible - raising the tower with one hand and holding the hook with the other.

Spectators couldn’t help but gasp in astonishment. He was using his bare hands to stop the empowered artifacts!

Anyone else could have been obliterated and sliced to pieces by them, not Li Qiye. Of course, they all knew how terrifying Li Qiye was but their jaw still dropped to the ground.

All-things and Sword Queen couldn’t have done this, not even the mighty Calamity Dao Lord. His shell couldn’t have endured the onslaught.

“These pieces of scrap metals could have been effective in the past but now, completely worthless in my eyes.” Li Qiye smiled and stunned his opponents.

They were already giving their all yet their ace cards meant nothing to Li Qiye.
