Chapter 5733: Quite The Confidence

The glow of the celestial river illuminated the intruders’ faces.

“Rumble!” Demon Conqueror was the first to arrive at the river; her aura of nature took over the area. Next came the commanders with weapons and treasures floating above them, and their legions.

Wondrous visual phenomena and unstoppable figures could be seen on The People’s side. The combined auras could sweep through the stars.

However, Celestial Court’s army has been waiting before the river, empowered by the heavenly light of the treasure. The light emanating from them built an unsurpassable wall, reducing the enemies’ morale.

Their imperial auras didn’t pale versus the monstrous coalition. If it weren’t for their commanders’ protection, soldiers would have been blown flying.

Two particular characters commanded everyone’s attention despite the presence of War and his allies.

“You are not returning after this unwelcomed impudence.” One of them spoke.

He sat in the meditative pose with a radiating glow. Each strand of light was far-reaching, capable of illuminating this expanse and the immortal continent. He seemed to be the center of the world.

His light chased away all the darkness and instantly purified any new one. Moreover, the image of a gigantic dragon of a golden affinity could be seen, seeming the source of the light.

Spectators couldn’t help but feel respect for the holy dragon. Nothing was more dignified and majestic than this creature.

Light-dragon Conqueror - a title known throughout the six continents. He hailed from Celestial Court itself, born destined for nobility and greatness.

There was no lack of talented cultivators with prestigious bloodlines in Celestial Court. However, all of them seemed to be just one tiny step below him.

This included Titanic Conqueror who came from the imperial clan - a descendant of Crimson Emperor. Ultimately, she cultivated in her clan and wasn’t a part of Celestial Court from the beginning.

War was ancient and had toiled for Celestial Court for eras. However, his background and status still seemed inferior to Light-dragon.

“Light-dragon Conqueror.” Members of The People became serious after seeing the meditating cultivator.

He had bested numerous emperors during Skysplitter and they haven’t forgotten. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“We don’t need to return.” Demon’s natural aura was pure and destructive as she responded: “Today is when we trample Celestial Court and replace it.”

Her aura contended against his with rays as large as heavenly waterfalls, seemingly equal.

“Fellow Daoist Demon, quite the confidence you have.” Another person with a colossal ring behind him answered.

Its thickness spanned ten thousand miles and could support the entire expanse. To the center were numerous images of destroyed galaxies and worlds, reduced to powder.

Was he the culprit of their destruction?

“Heaven Burial Conqueror!” None could stay cool after seeing him.

He was an ancient being, rumored to be the second after Vine Conqueror. In reality, this was an inaccurate legend that had circulated the world.

During his youth, he was talented and fortunate enough to learn from one of the nine scriptures - Heaven Burial Dual Wheels.

Thus, he was virtually unstoppable even before becoming a conqueror, capable of defeating imperial-level characters. Moreover, he enjoyed Celestial Court’s protection as well.

His ascension came with the help of Celestial Court, defeating Martial Conqueror and taking his primordial dao fruit.
