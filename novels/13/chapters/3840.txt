Chapter 3841: The Grand Seer

Three Slashes, unlike the furious crowd, showed no sign of anger. He smiled and cupped his fist towards Li Qiye: “I am a member of the Biandu. If you don’t mind, please be a guest at our residence.”

His amiable nature and politeness despite being the future ruler of Black Wood Cliff earned him points from the crowd.

“I’m sure our region will prosper under his rule.” Someone from the last generation nodded approvingly.

“If there’s a chance.” Li Qiye curtly answered.

The contrast between Three Slashes’ hospitality and Li Qiye’s bluntness only served to further annoy the crowd.

“Who does he think he is, the young lord of Buddha Holy Ground? Even Righteous Scion or the wild child would only be on the same level as our young lord. How dare he!” One youth unhappily said.

“Give him an inch and he wants a mile.” Another expert said: “Black Wood Cliff isn’t the place for him to act in this haughty manner.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Most locals considered the Biandu to be their leader, not Vajra Dynasty. Thus, the young lord of this clan was highly respected as well.

Now, an outsider dared to act pompous in front of him? This was truly an eyesore for the locals.

Moreover, a regional boss on his home turf could outdo a king. It didn’t matter who Li Qiye was, he had no chance against the Biandu at Black Wood Cliff.

Many big shots came to this place and acted just like Li Qiye. In the end, they tucked their tail between their legs and showed humility.

Three Slashes became a bit awkward and forced himself to smile: “Our door will always be open for you.”

By this point, even the people from Righteous Sect and the eight kingdoms appreciated his temperament and patience.

“Clank-” A series of melodious clunking of jade pieces could be heard. [1]

“Creak.” The wooden gate of the watch opened and two lines of disciples walked out towards the platform.

The ones in front held banners with their sect’s insignia and indecipherable runes. They wore gray robes with the same engraved insignia. These were only ordinary disciples and didn’t have the right to wear ceremonial robes.

The banners fluttered to the wind. After a while, the seers finally walked out.

They lacked oppressive aura but due to their solemn expression, others knew that it was time to be quiet and serious.

Their ceremonial outfits consisted of rings and loops along with bird feathers. Their pointed hats had embedded golden lines and stars, looking like the sky above.

Some robes had beast bone attached as well. The bones have turned yellow with time. Nonetheless, they still emitted a faint shimmer, looking quite magical.

These robes looked just as old, especially the materials. Nonetheless, the threads stood the test of time despite having worn marks. This only made them more special.

According to the rumors, these robes were passed down from generation to generation. It symbolized the seers’ legacy. Thus, if a regular disciple wanted a ceremonial robe, they would need to have considerable achievements. Once they were given a robe, this would mean that they could call themselves a seer.

Seer Watch took disciples from all over the world without discrimination. Thus, both the disciples and seers present consisted of all races - a tiger-body and human-head demon, flashing ghosts, heavenly devil with a halo above their head, regular humans...

However, the majority consisted of heart ghosts. This particular race had a mirror in front of their chest.

It used to be one of the strongest ghost races in the past. This was no longer the case. There were plenty of ghosts in the holy ground, just not heart ghosts. The easiest place to see one was here in Seer Watch.

They were blessed from birth with a divination ability. Thus, it was easier for them to become seers.

The seers surrounded the old well. Their dignified appearance made the atmosphere quite tense. The spectators held their breath in anticipation.

To be able to watch a divination ceremony was an honor. Plus, they could get a glimpse into the future as well. The big shots and ancestors didn’t want to miss a single detail.

“Hmm, looks to be rushed.” One ancestor who had seen one before quietly told his peers. This ceremony was too simple this time.

In the past, it would take more than a year just to prepare. The audience would have been notified ahead of time as well.

Thus, the weaker cultivators wouldn’t be qualified to go up the peak. This wasn’t the case today so many big shots were missing.

“Clank!” An old seer hit a gong then announced: “Please grace us with your presence, the venerable Grand Seer!”

The crowd focused right away, not daring to show an ounce of disrespect. The Grand Seer wasn’t an unbeatable character but his fame far exceeded the four grandmasters.

An old man slowly walked out of the building and instantly became the center of attention.

One could describe him as being short and small. His ceremonial robe was extremely old. It seemed that a gust of wind could blow pieces off of it.

He also had a heart mirror in front of his chest. The main difference between him and other heart ghosts was the leopard spots on his skin.

It showed that his bloodline wasn’t pure. He was a hybrid between a demon and heart ghost. As his walking stick struck the ground with each step, people felt as if it was hitting their heart.

“Grand Seer.” Everyone bowed to show their reverence, the ancestors included.

He wasn’t as strong as Heavenly Sovereigns but in the past, even Eight Stallion Dao Lord addressed him as “senior”. Buddha Supreme addressed him as “Venerable Seer”. Righteous Supreme used “old friend”.

These were all signs of his prestige and reputation. That’s why everyone present was at least one seniority lower than him.
