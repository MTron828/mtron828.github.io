Chapter 5381: Save Me, Master!

It became apparent that cultivators stood no chance against these lightning bolts. Nevertheless, those who stood their ground fared better, at least for a few seconds.

Eventually, their merit laws and treasures exploded as well; their sacred fruits followed next.

Meanwhile, Autumn, Arsenal, and Wild experienced their first heavenly tribulation. They smartly utilized Heavenslay to combat the lightning bolts.

Alas, the dreadful formation only made the heavenly tribulation stronger. Flames and lightning bolts destroyed the energy swords and took down the formation.

With the formation gone, they had to face this empowered tribulation. Wild was the first to be trapped by lightning bolts, seemingly naked and helpless.

“Ahh!” They converged and reduced him to ashes.

“Not like this!” Arsenal with ten dao fruits didn’t last much longer. The tribulation provoked by Heavenslay was fatally potent.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Ahh!” His dao fruits turned to ashes as well. He only lasted a few seconds longer than Wild.

“Master, save me!” Autumn faced the same peril and cried out for help.

Unfortunately, even if he were here, he wouldn’t be able to save her. After all, he might not be able to survive the heavenly tribulation himself. Appearing meant summoning more tribulations - one that would be far stronger than the one she was facing.

“No!” She screamed while being struck by numerous bolts. Her master still did not show up.

Meanwhile, spectators trembled in fear after seeing the power of the tribulation. Those near the battlefield fell, one by one.

They reflected on the situation as well - Autumn was a top conqueror with ten dao fruits. Regular ancestors were mere insects in comparison.

Now, despite dominating for a lifetime and never needing to ask anyone for help, she was begging for Illumination Conqueror to come save her.

Her dao heart crumbled and she reverted back to the young, helpless orphan. She considered Illumination to be her only hope right now. To her dismay, the past didn’t repeat itself.

Eventually, despair took over and the light of hope was extinguished. The tribulation finally broke through all her defenses and obliterated her.

The crowd saw this and knew that Illumination was watching as well. In fact, he might have been near the battlefield but chose to hide from the tribulation.

“Boom!” Only two survivors were left at this point - Myriad Eye Dao Lord and Ye Fantian.

The two of them weren’t faring well - Myriad Eye was covered in bloody wounds.

“Break!” He roared and sent his twelve dao fruits upward while burning his vitality. He didn’t give up and still decided to go all out against the heavenly tribulation. The constant barrage left cracks on his dao fruit.

“Boom!” Finally, his fruits exploded along with their owner.

In this split second, a light flashed deep in space, serving as a guiding lighthouse. What was left of the fruits started flying toward the light and immediately disappeared from sight.
