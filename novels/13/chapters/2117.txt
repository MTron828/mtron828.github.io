“Well, all I can say is that the situation is quite unfavorable. But don’t forget, you’re not alone even when I leave. You still have White Crane.”

“White Crane Legion.” The person said: “You have brought this up back then. Ah, when you created this legion, you also destroyed the list.”

“I’m the only one who knows the members in the thirteen continents.” Li Qiye smiled and pointed at his head.

“However, you’ll find out too.” Li Qiye paused and said: “Not only you but White Crane will also move forward. Of course, you’ll naturally become its leader.”

“But you won’t give me the list.” The person smiled, understanding the Dark Crow after cooperating for so long.

“Right, it’s not that I don’t trust you, but we don’t know who else could be potentially eavesdropping. You’ll find out all the members eventually.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Then I’ll look forward to it.” The person didn’t mind at all. Their trust was unquestionable; the guy naturally had his reasons.

“They’ll appear when the time is right, just remember to not carelessly trust anyone.” Li Qiye said.

“I will.” The person nodded.

This legion has always been mysterious. Not to mention the nine worlds, even few in the thirteen knew about it. In fact, despite their long-running partnership, Li Qiye had never revealed any member of the legion to him.

“When to start an expedition?” The person eventually asked.

“Eventually.” Li Qiye said: “The final battle will determine everything. A few things are unpredictable too, like the Ancient Ming back then. I’m sure no one hopes for another race like that to come!”

The person became serious as well after hearing this name: “It’ll be really bad to experience another Ancient Ming.”

“Not just bad, a catastrophe!” Li Qiye said: “So that’s why the expedition will come, just not right now. I don’t want any mistake along the way.”

“But that’s not within your grasp. Even if you don’t start one, others might. For example, that great Buddha.” The person said.

“He will do one sooner or later, maybe even before me.” Li Qiye nodded: “But, he won’t be able to do it despite his confidence.”

“Don’t forget, he had prepared for this battle for a long time now, even longer than you!” The person revealed.

“I know.” Li Qiye smiled: “But longer isn’t always better. Plus, he doesn’t belong to our epoch so he’s at a great disadvantage from the very start. Otherwise, with his effort and accumulation, he would amount to even more. The final battle required our own epoch as the main banner riser, or it would be the reflection of the flower in the morning dew or the moon in the night water.”

The person contemplated for a bit and said: “If you were to win, what will you replace it with, yourself?”

“You’re overthinking it.” Li Qiye laughed and shook his head: “You think I would do something so tasteless? Plus, the world won’t change when my dirty hands take over, not much at all.”

“Then what?” The person remained tense when asking this question.

“The judgment of the heaven and earth, the only thing that is impossible to fool in this world.” Li Qiye declared.

The person’s eyes became serious and eventually replied: “Hmm, I don’t think it can be carried out!”

“Who says so?” Li Qiye answered solemnly: “You should know that it is very real, not just in theory. The thing exists but we simply can’t touch it.”

Few understood this concept for what it is, limited to using the common adage to stand for justice, more so in the mortal world. However, cultivators were gods to mortals. They didn’t need to believe in a higher power. Nevertheless, this mysterious person understood the existence of this ethereal arbitrator. The exact details remained elusive because no one could truly grasp it.

“I have toiled for generations, not for survival like those dark overlords and epoch lords that want to protect their world. All I wish for is to fight to the end!” A terrible light flashed in Li Qiye’s eyes.

“One day, people might think you will become the devil as you keep on going down this path.” The person said.

“And some might also think that I will become the high heaven, such as those hiding in order to live longer, but they don’t know that has never been my wish.” Li Qiye smiled.

The person sighed again. The Dark Crow’s thinking was always unexpected because his vision was much more insightful than others.

“Being hated as a devil or being worshiped as the high heaven? Either one’s fine. I will only be doing what I want to do, that’s all.” Li Qiye concluded.

The person looked at Li Qiye and said: “As you have said earlier, the future won’t be easy but I won’t let the current situation fall completely. I don’t care what you will do or become, devil, high heaven, judgment, whatever. Just guarantee me that a second Ancient Ming won’t appear. You are aware of the grave consequences of that happening!”

“I can’t.” Li Qiye replied: “The only thing I can guarantee you is that if a second race of that nature appears, I will be the first to cut them down, no matter where I am, alive or otherwise! Is that enough?”

The person couldn’t say anything after hearing this. This guarantee from Li Qiye was stronger than everything else.

They kept on talking about secretive plans regarding the fate of the thirteen continents! Each individual plan was incredible and would certainly astound emperors.

Eventually, the conservation was heading to an end. The person said: “I wish you luck. Maybe you will meet immortals or become one yourself. At that point, no one will be able to catch up to you.” The person sighed.

“Regardless of the future, the Dark Crow will still be the Dark Crow. The existence of immortals might not be a good thing. My becoming an immortal will not be good news either. If you catch wind of this news, I’m telling you, run as far as possible, dig yourself a hole and hide, don’t ever show up again.” Li Qiye said slowly.

It sounded like a joke but carried a realistic stench of blood.

“Alright, I’ll be the first to run then when that happens.” The person joked back.

The two of them disappeared without leaving any trace of this meeting. No seer could ever detect or calculate it.

The thirteen continents were quiet after the battle at celestial like a serene pond. Many imperial lineages have closed their doors and connecting portals. People even felt as if the emperors themselves didn’t dare to breathe loudly right now. Everyone was playing it safe.

All of this was interrupted by auspicious energy coming out of nowhere, something similar to when reishi mushroom came out. [1]

In just one night, majestic power of grand dao and chaos energy slowly emerged. The world seemed to be heading towards the original chaos once more.

All of these powers were connecting together and headed for the same direction. Though it wasn’t that fast, the sheer amount coming from all thirteen continents gathered like endless rivers with loud detonations. These rivers flowed above the sky and everyone could see and hear them.
