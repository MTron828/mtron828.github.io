Chapter 5550: Monkeys Reign In The Absence Of Tigers

Someone had been waiting by the grotto’s entrance and bowed after seeing the group.

“Fairy Qin.” The old man said respectfully. He wore a gray robe and had a vigorous aura - a Heavenly Sovereign. This was a rare sight in Momentous Frontier since no capable cultivator would want to stay here.

The land became a prison of sorts. Outside meant freedom while staying implied following certain rules and laws.

“Protector Guo, long time no see.” Baifeng recognized him.

Guo Cheng was a vagabond cultivator in Momentous Frontier, belonging to a group that wanted to stay here to protect the land. They weren’t strong enough to obtain a deity spot like the founders.

“It’s good to see you again, Fairy Qin. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know what to do.” He heaved a sigh of relief before looking at the group.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Li Qiye looked average and he couldn’t notice anything special. Niu Fen was using a stealth technique as well. The cloud turned out to be the strangest entity.

Nonetheless, Baifeng was a dragon lord so it was understandable for her to have interesting companions.

Although he had cultivated for a long time, the gap between him and Baifeng was insurmountable. Thus, she was indeed a fairy descending from the firmaments.

“What’s the matter, Protector Guo?” Baifeng had a serious expression since she could see that something was amiss in her home.

“Fairy Qin, please deliver us from this disaster.” Guo Cheng bowed and spoke with a heavy heart.

“What disaster?” Baifeng asked, wondering about the deities’ ever-present protection.

“You have just returned, Fairy Qin, so you might not be aware of the disasters happening all over, terrible harvests, illness, and livestock going crazy and dying.” Guo Cheng said: “This is still limited in scale but people are suffering.”

“What is going on, the deities are always watching over us?” Baifeng responded.

“A few places are no longer enjoying the deities’ blessings, whether it be the Deity of Harvest, Deities of Cleansing, and Deity of Livestock. Villagers and animals are dying.” He said.

“Prayers and offerings didn’t stop, correct?” She asked.

“Fairy Qin, everyone’s faith has always been strong due to the tradition instilled upon us since youth, we never dared to show a sliver of disrespect.” He said.

“Your cultivation is strong enough to deal with this, right?” She asked.

He smiled wryly and let out a sigh before responding: “Fairy, I have refined some pills. That can’t solve the terrible harvests but even sick villagers aren’t getting better after eating them.”

“Your pills aren’t working on mortals?” Niu Fen became curious.

Pills refined by a sovereign were extremely valuable. They were virtually immortal medicines when used on mortals, capable of healing any ailment.

A mortal with serious diseases could become vigorous again and gain a longer lifespan. Limbs and flesh could grow again.

“It’s like a plague. It started in several areas and now, it is out of control, I’m so glad to see you back.” He said emotionally: “Since my pills did not work, I also prayed sincerely but never got an answer.”

“Oh? The old geezers aren’t responding to you? They’re still here though.” Niu Fen interjected.

“This lowly one does not know.” He answered: “Lands are withering and if this continues, all of Momentous Frontier will be affected.”

With that, he prostrated and asked: “Fairy, please save us.”

“Young Noble, what is your opinion on this?” Baifeng didn’t know how to start because the deities were far stronger than her. There was something else beyond the surface.

“There’s no way they’re turning a blind eye to this.” Niu Fen said.

“We will check.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Protector Guo, please lead the way. The young noble wishes to investigate.” Baifeng ordered.

Guo Cheng obeyed while feeling puzzled about her respectful attitude toward Li Qiye. Was this ordinary guy stronger than Fairy Qin?

“Oh, there is something else.” He said along the way: “People from West Bank are here.”

“West Bank Imperial Clan?” Baifeng didn’t expect this: “Why are they here?”

This clan was prestigious and influential in Dao Domain. Some said that they owned half of Dao Domain. Of course, this was an overstatement but it still properly conveyed their influence.

“I do not know, a general and his men are here to try to deal with the disasters but it’s not effective.” He said.

“They shouldn’t be here, Momentous Frontier is not part of their jurisdiction or any outsider for that matter.” She said.

“I said that too but I’m just a lowly cultivator who couldn’t speak up in the presence of a general.” Guo Cheng said: “I think they might start camping here if the deities do not appear.”

“I see…” Baifeng murmured and thought that this was a terrible development. Momentous Frontier was meant for mortals, not cultivators.

“Monkeys reign in the absence of tigers.” Niu Fen smiled and said: “Everyone is in Immortal Dao City so this imperial clan gets to rule Dao Domain, hilarious.”

“Senior, have you heard the news of Immortal Dao City closing its gates?” Guo Cheng asked humbly.

“The gates are closed?” Niu Fen didn’t expect this.

“Do you know why?” Baifeng asked immediately.
