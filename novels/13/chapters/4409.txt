Chapter 4410: Five-sun King’s Arrival

The force of the east received a grand reception from Dragon and Peacock Monarch. Spectators have seen something unprecedented before but unfortunately, they still felt unsatisfied.

“We haven’t seen the conqueror yet, what a shame.” One youth complained.

“Yes, the future dao lord, it would be nice to catch a glimpse.” Even a last-gen cultivator agreed.

After all, Five-sun King was an official heir - qualified to become a dao lord in the future. Seeing a dao lord during his youth would be the topic of a lifetime.

Alas, it seemed like he wasn’t part of the current convoy.

“Don’t worry, something good will happen soon.” A crowd member said.

“What are you talking about?” Those nearby became confused.

“The king wants to preach the dao.” The guy revealed, causing the crowd to clamor.

Sure enough, a message came from Dragon Platform a while later - Five-sun King will preach the dao in the front square. All guests are welcomed.

A storm immediately took over the city after this.

“A public dao lecture? The whole world will benefit from this.” One cultivator became excited.

Everyone in City of Demons became eager to come and listen. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Is this actually worth it?” One skeptic said.

An expert nearby immediately retorted: “Absolutely, this is an heir of a great power, a being capable of becoming a dao lord in the future. You will benefit from listening, no doubt about that.”

“Yes, It’s not just that, Dragon is very generous this time too.” One big shot from the last generation said.

First, Five-sun King was qualified to perform a public dao preach. He had surpassed the young generation and many ancestors in terms of grand dao comprehension.

Most wouldn’t want to share their enlightenment with the rest of the world. Thus, this was rather selfless of him.

Furthermore, Dragon was letting him use the square in front of Demon Realm Palace. This square was large enough to accommodate countless cultivators.

It was completely packed before the start of the lecture. Spectators could see the palace floating in the air.

The area was perfect for a dao lecture - a combination between a priceless treasure and a peerless genius.

This dao lecture was too tempting so everyone came early in order to grab a good spot, awaiting the event.

It included members of Dragons and even outsiders, whether it be those from large or small sects. The latter didn’t want to miss this opportunity and tried their best to come. This was a rare chance for them to learn.

“Clank!” On the right date, a ceremony also started with Peacock Monarch leading the way. The esteemed guests from the east followed right behind him.

Powerful auras swept through the square and made everyone put on a serious expression.

It was incredible for so many big shots to come only to listen to Five-sun King. The crowd no longer dared to speak loudly.

Of course, this wasn’t an issue of giving face. Five-sun King’s lecture could actually benefit them. Many ancestors were far older than him but he might actually be stronger.

Time passed slowly and the sun rose. However, Five-sun King was still nowhere to be found.

Initially, everyone waited patiently due to the dignified nature of the event and the big shots present. Alas, some started becoming impatient.

“Why isn’t he here yet?” One youth asked.

“Be patient!” A senior pushed his head down and glared at him.

The junior knew better than to test the wrath of his senior so he kept his mouth shut afterward.

Peacock Monarch frowned slightly after seeing this. Though Five-sun King was one of the five conquerors, Peacock Monarch was also a supreme genius worshipped by many.

He asked the previous sect master of Five-sun: “May I ask when Virtuous Nephew is coming?”

“Soon, very soon.” The sect master responded despite not actually knowing the answer.

“Boom!” Suddenly, the sky was treated like a golden gong. Something massive struck it, resulting in a blast waking everyone up.

Space rippled and a dao portal manifested into reality. Several dozen armored men appeared and lined up like an impregnable wall of steel. They were tall and completely covered in plates. Only their eyes could be seen. Their weapon of choice was the sword.

Though they simply stood there, their aggression and bloodlust were palpable. They resembled heavenly soldiers and demanded others to look up at them.

“Five-sun Iron Guardians!” One cultivator shouted in astonishment.

“The king is coming!” Others knew what was going on.

These men were personal guards of Five-sun King. They had accompanied him to numerous battlefields. Their presence meant that he was here as well.

The area in the center of the formation became engulfed in lightning bolts. This made it hard for people to keep their eyes open.

“Boom!” Eventually, a great figure landed on the square, causing a violent quake.

A devasting aura blew away the clouds and shocked the audience. Everyone felt an unbearable pressure pressing down on them.

“Five-sun King!” All eyes were on this figure.
