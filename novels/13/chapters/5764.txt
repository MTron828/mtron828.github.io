Chapter 5765: I Will Not Waver

“Boom!” The power of the primordial tree crushed Ling’er, pulverizing her body and soul.

“Ahh!” Only a bloody mist was left after a final scream.

However, the rays kept her alive and prevented the mist from dissipating. This was the worst possible torture - death with lingering pain.

Even if one had entered heaven or hell, this agony would still be there to haunt them.

“Rumble!” The tree continued to smash her while maintaining her existence, instilling pain worse than traversing the eighteen layers of hell.

After each smash, the bloody mist became smaller and was replaced by bright particles. Instead of flesh and blood, she gradually gained a form made from primordial light.

Only someone like Li Qiye could destroy her present self and turn it into a primordial body.

“Boom!” He formed a mudra and imprinted a seal onto her body, stabilizing and finishing the process.

She returned to life and had a radiant glow - a total transformation.

“The first step is complete.” He nodded.

“Young Noble, how did you do this?” A mortal like Ling’er did not know about cultivation or the power of Li Qiye.

Nevertheless, she felt that she had a unique power now. Within her was an uncharted world brimming with majestic forces.

“Next, you must fuse with your source before I release you.” He pointed at the woman in the coffin.

She shuddered after hearing this and asked: “Will, will I disappear?”

“You will still be you, but who you become is dependent on you alone. Fortunes are created by us, this is the dao heart.” He smiled.

“The dao heart.” This was her first time hearing this concept but it left a strong impression in her mind.

“Shall we?” Li Qiye asked.

“Will we meet again, Young Noble?” She stared at Li Qiye and thought that she might not be able to see him again.

“Who knows what the future holds?” He said: “But as long as your dao heart remains firm and sets you on the right path, I’m sure we can meet again.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I will not waver.” She clenched her fists and said before hugging him. Who knows how long it would be until their next meeting?

“Separation is inevitable in life, always try your best to move forward.” He patted her head and said.

She didn’t want to let go despite this being their first meeting. However, their brief time together was more memorable than many things in her life. He was someone who sympathized with her plight and assisted willingly.

“I can do it, Young Noble.” Tears soaked his robe and her dress. Nonetheless, she became incredibly determined and eagerly wanted to see what tomorrow would bring.

“Don’t worry, everything will be better.” He wiped her tears again and said.

She nodded and finally let go, entering the coffin. Her primordial body gradually dispersed into particles again and fused with her source.

She opened her eyes one last time, wanting to engrave Li Qiye’s appearance into her mind.

“Zzz...” All the particles fused with the source.

The woman still looked the same as before with one exception - a faint glow beneath her skin.

Li Qiye glanced at the horizon afterward - that figure was no longer there. Perhaps the person had gone into hiding.

“Old geezer, your gamble in leading me here paid off. This wouldn’t have been the outcome if I had a sliver of ruthlessness in me. This multiplying mantra with a bit more seasonings would have been quite a feast.” He smiled.

No one answered him.

Cause and effect were at play here, but not necessarily karma. Someone in Celestial Court wanted to make this gamble, hoping that Li Qiye was different than other overlords.

In the case of failure, he would have devoured Ling’er along with the rune. Thus, the outcome was dependent on Li Qiye’s whim.

However, his opponent won today because Li Qiye was indeed different.

“Let’s get this uncovering started.” Li Qiye told his star and the cloud.

His star looked at the one in the coffin, seemingly not wanting to do this. It had just found a counterpart despite some major differences. Nonetheless, it was rare to find another star in this mortal world.

“I’m afraid it will crumble.” Li Qiye said.

The star glanced at Ling’er as well since her body had a strong affinity with it.
