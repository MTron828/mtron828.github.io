Chapter 4610: Broken Cliff

“Go for it then, Puresword.” Jian Ming urged: “We shall help you take down Five-sun King, stomp on True Immortal Young Emperor, capture Shen Juntian, and beat up Tian Feng.”

The brat wanted to cause more chaos than anything.

Puresword smiled and shook his head: “How can a firefly compete with the moons? I do appreciate the sentiment.”

“Fuck, you overly humble idiot, if you’re a firefly, then what the hell are we?” Jian Ming gave him the side-eye.

Puresword only smiled. It looked like he had no ambition to take over the world.

“It’s time to leave.” Li Qiye didn’t bother persuading him and stood up to leave, still seeming to be in a good mood.

Jian Ming and the daoist gave chase. Paramount Scion and Ye Tingrong also wanted to leave.

The latter bowed slightly to the Improper Four despite not knowing their background. Nonetheless, it became obvious that they came from prestigious and ancient lineages. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After leaving the store, they followed Li Qiye’s group.

“Why are you following us? Got some ulterior motives?” Jian Ming laughed while staring at Paramount Scion.

“Of course not, I just want to broaden my horizon by following the young noble.” Paramount Scion shook his head and said sincerely.

“Brat, you are very smart, got thick skin too.” Jian Ming said.

“I can’t compare to you, Fellow Daoist.” The scion bowed slightly.

Jian Ming enjoyed the praise and laughed: “Haha, you’re too kind.”

The daoist came closer and whispered: “What the hell are you doing? Don’t you see that the miss is here too, you need to take advantage of this and get closer to her.”

“Shut up with this nonsense.” Jian Ming glared at him.

Despite the remark, his eyes still shifted toward Ye Tingrong.

“We’re heading this way.” Xiao Xuan frowned and sensed something, pointing to the other side of the town.

Li Qiye then talked to the other two: “You two have this much free time?”

“I wish to follow you and learn more, Young Noble.” The scion said, aware that Li Qiye was here for something, and shamelessly asked to tag along.

Ye Tingrong’s face wasn’t as thick. She turned red and said: “I’ve grown up in Sky’s Demise and know the streets like the palm of my hand. I don’t have anything to do right now and wouldn’t mind being a host if it is okay with you.”

“Of course it’s fine.” Jian Ming nodded in agreement: “With Miss Ye’s help, we’ll be saving a lot of time.”

The daoist laughed after hearing Jian Ming’s assistance, prompting the latter to glare at him.

Xiao Xuan took them to the other side of town. This place was abandoned and taken over with weed.

At the initial location, it wasn’t prosperous but there were still people living there. In this case, not a single soul could be seen.

It had tall trees and thickets amidst the broken walls and tiles. Judging by these remnant pieces, there used to be many large buildings here. Not far from here were mountain ranges that have been devastated by an unknown power, either pierced or severed.

It became difficult to imagine the place’s initial appearance; only its grand scale was obvious.

“Should be this place.” Xiao Xuan said without complete confidence.

Li Qiye scanned the area and didn’t notice anything. Of course, this was only temporary.

“Broken Cliff.” Ye Tingrong said.

“Do you know this place well, Miss Ye?” Jian Ming became curious.

She shook her head: “Not a lot, just a thing or two. This is one of the ancient ruins outside of Worldbreaker known as Broken Cliff. People rarely come here.”

“Is there anything special about it?” Jian Ming asked.

She tilted her head and carefully pondered for a bit before answering: “Rumor has it that back in the ancient era, there used to be a great capital here with pavilions floating among the clouds. It was the center of an entire continent, the place of central authority.”

“So a kingdom? I haven’t heard of this before.” Jian Ming said.

“One that is far older than your clan.” The daoist said: “It is a kingdom existing in the legends, its origin is shrouded in mysteries.”

“Go on.” Jian Ming became curious.

The daoist didn’t tease him this time and answered earnestly: “From what I know, the kingdom was started by a colony of a strange race. They were independent from Eight Desolaces and lived on their own continent, reaching a majestic level of prosperity. It might also have had an ancient lineage that regular people referred to as an immortal sect.”

“Wait, this place is next to Worldbreaker, what is this continent you’re talking about?” Paramount Scion looked around; this place was definitely still near Worldbreaker.

“The records are unclear. We do know that the world back then was different from the one we see now. During the great calamity, sects might have had their own dimension. However, the destruction changed everything, even oceans evaporated and divine mountains crumbled. Where we are standing might be an ocean in the past.”

“True.” The scion agreed with this logic. The landscape of the world changed entirely after the great calamity. Current generation might not know the exact details of the calamity, only the result.

“How did such a powerful race disappear?” Jian Ming asked.

“It’s impossible to know now.” The daoist shook his head: “Speculation has it that both the kingdom and the sect couldn’t avoid the calamity, resulting in destruction.”

He paused for a bit before glancing over at Worldbreaker: “A different one mentions the terrifying punch. Waves of fist energies broke through everything as if they were dried branches. A radius of one million miles was obliterated, all living beings were instantly killed.”

“That I am familiar with.” Tingrong said: “There are several ancient ruins in Sky’s Demise. The power of that punch was terrifying and crushed numerous sects.”

“I see, an ancient race became extinct just like that.” Jian Ming rubbed his chin.

“Hard to say.” The daoist replied: “I heard that Sword Ocean Dao Lord might be related to this race. Therefore, extinction might not be their fate.”
