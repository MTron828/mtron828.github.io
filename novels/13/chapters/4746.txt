Chapter 4747: Everyone Together

He has used the gemstone before and understood what terrible power loomed within. In his opinion, it was perfectly logical for its wielder to wound the seven ancestors.

After all, this was something capable of contending against the power of Worldbreaker - a place that was not conquered by the dao lords.

He had only used it a few times and it nearly took his life. From what he could see, Li Qiye had complete control over the gemstone. This meant that he had the means to fight Worldbreaker right now.

Of course, others didn’t have the same experience and only focused on the immediate results of the fight.

The bloodied ancestors were pale as they stared at each other in disbelief. As beings capable of looking down on others, they have met true masters such as Dao Sanqian before.

It has been a long time since they sustained such serious injuries. Moreover, they had no chance of stopping the attack earlier. Anyone slightly weaker would have been reduced to ashes.

“We have to join as well.” One of the five Sky’s End ancestors from True Immortal had a solemn expression.

As accomplished generals under Worldraiser Dao Lord, they could tell that they were facing a formidable foe. Killing Li Qiye was far from easy.

The other members of the alliance knew that this was not the time to hold back. They had to work together while using everything in their arsenal.

“Fellow Daoist Li, we shall be teaming up with all of our forces now. If you wish to have your own allies involved, now is the time.” Five-sun King said before preparing for the assault. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Bring as many as you want. Ten thousand come, ten thousand will stay on the ground, the same applies to a million. I alone am enough.” Li Qiye smiled.

The crowd took a deep breath. He was still wanting to go alone against the full forces of the alliance.

The dao lord competition has started. Therefore, it wasn’t shameful for the alliance to team up against Li Qiye. There have been plenty of historical precedences.

Therefore, becoming a dao lord was quite a feat - needing to overcome numerous obstacles.

“No mercy will be shown during times of war. This is your last chance to summon allies, Fellow Daoist. We will not stop attacking afterward.” The young emperor reminded.

Both Five-sun King and the young emperor wanted to win. Killing Li Qiye was of utmost importance. Nonetheless, they still wanted to give their foe more time.

“It’s alright, just these two hands are enough.” Li Qiye smiled again, looking domineering with the gemstone in his hand.

He resembled a mortal with no aura to speak of as he stood there. Alas, this was an unbeatable mortal.

“This is Li Qiye.” Everyone was moved to be in his presence - a competitor wanting to embark on the path all alone.

“Very well, start the formation.” A Sky’s End ancestor ordered. The alliance seemed to have a plan to deal with Li Qiye.

“Good.” The young emperor, Five-sun King, and their men also joined the battle.

Casualty would be nothing more than a number today. They must defeat Li Qiye no matter what.

“Hahaha, although I wish to fight you to the death in a one-on-one fight, it seems that I lack the ability to do so. I shall join them then.” Tian Feng laughed.

It was abundantly clear that Li Qiye would crush him in a fair duel. The lack of competitiveness ruined the fun. Therefore, he had no choice but to join the others and try to put up a good fight. Seeking death amidst a great battle was his joy in life. His goal was completely different and purer than his peers'.

The alliance members slowly circled around Li Qiye. Though they haven’t practiced this before, their experience and talent more than made up for it.

As for the spectators, they fantasized about the incoming move. This might be the strongest attack in the last few eras. They smartly retreated in order to avoid being hit by the remnant shock waves.

“This battle will decide everything.” A big shot murmured.

The crowd understood that one side would die today.

“Fellow Daoists, follow my lead to create a defensive seal.” Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor shouted.

The others showed zero hesitation. Their forehead lit up and shot out buzzing rays.

“Rumble!” Heavenseal turned into a great bulwark. Dao runes transformed and morphed continuously beneath his feet. The power of various grand dao blessed him.

The rays from other cultivators struck him and formed a seal.

“Boom!” He roared and a beam of divine light descended from above and hit him.

All of this culminated in the formation of runic shields.
