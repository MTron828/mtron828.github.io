Qing Shi’s casual swing contained billowing sword intent and considerable power.

He created a sword dao with a slight movement on top of a special sword rhythm. This ability display astounded the crowd.

“Clank!” He swept through the incoming sword formation uncontested. Fiery sparks splattered as the godchild was forced back.

“Boom! Boom!” It stopped the incoming dragons as well despite their awe-inspiring and dreadful strength. The prince staggered several steps backward as a result of the shockwave.

“My turn!” Qing Shi roared after a successful defense and pointed his sword at the sky. It illuminated the four directions.

A terrible sword brilliance manifested and created numerous divine swords. They were more than enough to turn someone into a sieve. This terrible technique naturally instilled chills into the spectators.

“So strong, who the hell is he?” Others took a deep breath.

“It’s just an ordinary technique, Blossoming Steel Flower.” An ancestor analyzed the move: “It’s not a special one or anything.”

The power of the move made others think that it was a peerless sword technique. However, the ancestors could see that it was just a common move. Many sword users have trained with it before; the result was just different.

“Let’s go!” The prince and the godchild roared again, undeterred by the powerful sword technique.

The godchild also summoned numerous divine swords for another formation, aiming straight at Qing Shi without showing any mercy.

The prince showed zero weakness, unleashing a four-beast technique. A true dragon soared to the sky along with a phoenix; the white tiger and black tortoise crushed the ground and the grand dao.

“Rumble!” Qing Shi alone fought against the two geniuses, causing the sky to turn dark. Fiery sparks scattered down like bright, beautiful flowers.

This seemed to be an even match; neither side felt like an underdog.

“Someone this strong can’t be a nameless junior.” People speculated after seeing Qing Shi’s sword mastery. He became more spirited as the fight went on.

Sure, they weren’t going all out but being able to fight two geniuses at the same time was indicative of his abilities. Most of the crowd would have died already.

It became apparent that he was far stronger than the prince and the godchild.

“No wonder why he was so arrogant. He can back it up.” One spectator said, changing his mind about Qing Shi’s previous attitude.

Arrogance came accepted when it was warranted.

“Sir, why are you hiding your sect’s merit laws? Looks like you don’t want to divulge your background.” The princess who has been watching the entire time spoke.

The listeners caught on. In reality, the weaker cultivators didn’t have an idea. They just found his techniques to be impressive.

On the other hand, the princess might be stronger than many ancestors present despite her young age. Thus, she noticed the clues right away.

“That’s why he kept on using the common moves and sword techniques.” A few ancestors have realized this as well.

“He’s not using his actual moves?” Some cultivators took a deep breath.

The guy was already strong enough right now. The prince and the godchild would be finished if he were to use his real techniques.

“I’ll use whatever I want.” Qing Shi laughed and didn’t respond.

“Hmph, we’ll see how long you can keep this up.” Wu Zhongtian scowled and made his move right away.

A saber slash cut through the air, instantly separating everything. This fatal cut aimed straight for Qing Shi’s neck. The speed and the suddenness made it impossible to dodge.

“Seven-fold Edge!” A big shot from the last generation stated the technique’s name.

Qing Shi performed a movement step in order to dodge the blade inches from his neck. He crossed through one dimension after another like a dancing butterfly, an eagle, and a dragon. The transformations of the steps made the spectators dizzy. They couldn’t tell where he was after a while.

However, Zhongtian’s slash didn’t stop there. It immediately split into seven slashes and continued pursuing Qing Shi. These slashes could kill the gods and devils. Each had a bloodthirsty aura.

The peerless and agile movements of Qing Shi weren’t enough to evade the slashes. Dismemberment seemed inevitable.

“He’s done!” One expert shouted.

Qing Shi thrust his sword seven times in response, causing the stars to fall and stabilizing the cosmo. The grand momentum of this technique contained incredible profundity. The seven slashes were stopped right away by the falling celestial lights. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Clank!” Qing Shi staggered backward after the successful parry.

“Cosmic Shifter.” Wu Zhongtian recognized the technique and stopped attacking. He stared intensely at Qing Shi.

“Isn’t this a supreme sword art of the golems?” An older master became startled.

“An art of Ancestral, to be exact.” An ancestor added: “It originated from Ancestral City and was passed down to the golems. Many golem sects have this technique.”

Wu Zhongtian’s involvement forced Qing Shi to use a real technique.

“Not just that,Butterfly Dance as well.” The princess stared at Qing Shi and said: “Incredible mastery.”

Her vision was powerful enough to recognize the movement technique as well.

“Butterfly Dance?!” Those in the know took a deep breath, such as the ancestors.

“What about it, Ancestor?” A junior asked curiously.

“That’s a secret move from Ancestral, this one isn’t passed down to outsiders. Few can cultivate it.” The ancestor explained.

The crowd became shaken as a result and stared at Qing Shi. This meant that Qing Shi was clearly from Ancestral City.

Ancestral was comparable to Yin Yang and Skylight, the behemoth of this land. If Qing Shi was a disciple there and hanging around with Li Qiye...
