Chapter 4867: Northern Monarch’s Secret

Few in the lower continents could compare to Northern Monarch’s talent. She had plenty of achievements and was considered a pillar of Eight-stallion Dynasty. Some believed that it was only a matter of time before she surpasses Venerable Dragon God.

In Chaos, many were also curious about her relationship with Eight-stallion Dao Lord. Was she his lover or best friend? None of them seemed to match their relationship.

People only knew that the dao lord had taught her before so in a sense, this could be a master-disciple relationship. However, they never addressed each other as such, only as king and his subject.

All in all, she had the qualifications to inherit his legacy. She normally presided by the border to keep the peace while Venerable Dragon God stayed in the capital.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

A’zhui told her about how mean Li Qiye was and wanted her to teach him a lesson.

“Princess, go rest, leave this to me.” Northern Monarch consoled the young princess.

The princess listened and snorted at Li Qiye: “Just wait, this isn’t over between us.”

She then left with her guards, leaving Northern Monarch and Li Qiye behind.

The former stared closely at Li Qiye while Firerage watched her every move. He feared her the most when not counting the dragon god.

Brilliant talent was normally accompanied by ambition. There was a high chance of her surpassing the dragon god.

In fact, he might even support her because she could become a second Eight-stallion Dao Lord to stabilize their situation.

“Your Highness.” She lowered her head and said: “I have just returned from the border and couldn’t participate in the ceremony. I sincerely apologize.”

Li Qiye only glanced at her and didn’t say anything.

“Guard Commander, may I have a moment with His Highness?” Northern Monarch asked.

“Well…” Firerage hesitated because she was a rival to Li Qiye right now. His safety could be at risk.

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand.

“I’ll be right outside, just call out if you need me.” Firerage said begrudgingly.

This wasn’t due to him trusting Northern Monarch at all. For some reason, he had grown to trust in Li Qiye.

After he left, Li Qiye sat down while Northern Monarch took her time brewing tea for the two of them. It didn’t take long before the aroma wafted in the air.

“Your Highness, you’ve only arrived recently, please try the dynasty’s Billowing Snow.” Northern Monarch poured a full cup for him.

He didn’t hold back and lifted the hot cup, slowly sipping it.

“I am a devil from Deity Lineage.” She poured her own and sipped while speaking.

If anyone else were to hear this, they would be startled right away. Deity was the strongest in the lower continents, a part of The Race.

Its current leader was none other than Conceal Conqueror - the mortal enemy of Eight-stallion Dao Lord.

“Few know about this besides His Majesty.” Northern Monarch said sincerely.

She knew that Eight-stallion would never pass the throne to a random person before death.

“I am only a passerby.” Li Qiye casually responded after seeing her sincere attitude.

Her eyes narrowed as she sighed, not really grasping anything from him. If he didn’t wish to reveal his background, there was nothing she can do.

“The devils have declined. My background was not impressive, the same for my shoddy talent and comprehension.” She stared at the steaming cup of tea and reminisced about the past.

This was rather hard to believe given her current status and cultivation realm. “Supreme genius” was how people would describe her.

“I was delegated to heavy labor in my small sect.” She continued.

The hall was silent as she recalled her life story. Even the flickering of the torches could be heard.

“I thought that I would be lowly and wretched my whole life.” She said softly: “One day, I met His Majesty. He was as bright as the sun and illuminated my life. He said that my bloodline was full of potential and whether I was willing to follow him to train.”

“Mmm.” Li Qiye nodded: “His vision was excellent since he saw your ancient bloodline.”

“You can see it too?!” She nearly dropped her teacup.

Her bloodline was the reason why the dao lord asked her to follow him back to the dynasty. Sure enough, she didn’t let him down and excelled at cultivation after having the right advantages.

She never forgot about his kindness and favor. If it wasn’t for him, her life would still be terrible.

On one hand, a great dao lord should be able to recognize her ancient bloodline. In her mind, he was the greatest and most knowledgeable. Thus, it surprised her that Li Qiye was able to see it as well.

“Don’t be so shocked.” Li Qiye said: “He was able to hasten your cultivation progress but ultimately, he wasn’t a devil so his knowledge was limited. Otherwise, given your current cultivation, your Devilization bloodline wouldn’t have stopped here.”

“!!!” She blurted out in astonishment: “You know about Devilization?”

Upon the first meeting, the dao lord could tell that her bloodline was special. Alas, he didn’t know the exact detail.

Once they returned to the dynasty, he researched extensively and eventually came across this special bloodline - Devilization.

“One of the eight ancient bloodlines.” Li Qiye casually remarked, leaving her in shock.
