Colorful Balloons Take Flight

By this point, the disciples of Divine Black have gathered beneath their ancestral peak. They were nervous because they were about to face two sacred cultivators on top of their army.

“Slay them all!” The great army invaded the sect. They were extremely excited because this was their best opportunity to destroy Divine Black, the best chance for them to become renowned, the way to accomplish their sect’s destined goal.

“Rumble!” The drill opened the way, flattening both rivers and mountains.

The side of Divine Black was furious. Unfortunately, powerless as well.

“Clank!” Suddenly, the ringing of a bell could be heard during this perilous moment. It caused the stars to shift and a roar emanated like the waves.

It sent the army flying akin to a primordial flood. They were pushed to the sky, screaming and vomiting blood. It didn’t stop there. Another ring came along with a golden dragon soaring to the sky.

“Raa!” Its roar ruptured the enemies’ eardrums.

It easily smashed the leading drill into thousands of pieces. The disciples controlling it inside were sent flying, grievously injured.

Bells emerged above and melodies started playing. The ones from Divine Black were too familiar with them. These were the bells used during the important examinations.

“What’s going on?” They didn’t expect this shocking development at all.

“The spirit of their patriarch is helping them?” The spectating experts felt the same confusion with their eyes wide open.

“How boring, I have to do this myself against my merciful nature.” A lazy voice sounded.

Everyone noticed a youth laying on a carriage.

“The young master! He’ll save us!” The disciples of Divine Black were jubilated.

The golden dragon taking care of the army completely astounded the spectators. Their jaw dropped to the ground.

“Who is he?” They didn’t recognize Li Qiye. Since when did Divine Black have such a monstrous cultivator?

Ping Suoweng and the bodhi king finally heaved a sigh of relief, especially the former. He thought that he had won the gamble. Making the wrong choice would have turned him into an eternal sinner for Divine Black.

“Taking so long against these foes? Nonsense.” Li Qiye stretched before giving the command: “Go.”

“Raa!” The golden dragon leaped to the sky and unleashed another attack. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Boom!” The area outside of Divine Black was decimated. The fight between Lu Yiling and the other two had to stop since they were all sent flying.

Ping Suoweng and the bodhi king exchanged glances then returned to the sect.

“Okay, go take a break. Leave it to me.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve.

“Thank you, Young Master.” The two bowed before retreating to the ancestral peak.

“Young Master?” The spectators’ confusion grew after hearing the greeting.

One was the sect master while the other was a peak lord. They had prestigious positions and status, definitely the highest in Divine Black.

However, they referred to this youth as “Young Master?”

Others didn’t have a clue about Li Qiye and his background.

“Who are you?!” Three Truths Sect Master glared at Li Qiye. He knew Divine Black better than most. It didn’t have someone so strong and so young.

“You haven’t received my message?” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re Li Qiye!” The sect master stared at Li Qiye with astonishment.

Yes, he had received the messages from the survivors but he didn’t expect a third-generation disciple to be so capable.

He assumed that the death of Liu Menglong and Elder Fu had something to do with Ping Suoweng. According to the details, Suoweng’s sword dao should have been involved. This third-generation disciple was used as a decoy.

This no longer seemed the case. The guy named Li Qiye was truly the culprit. But then, how could a Bronze Tendon cultivator be so strong?

The spectators stared at each other. They have never heard of his name before.

“Seems like you didn’t understand what I said, that I’ll massacre your sect members if I see any. Looks like I have to carry out my promise.” Li Qiye added.

“How arrogant!” The daoist on the elephant shouted: “You alone think you can massacre our sect? I’ll see what you...”

“Your crappy elephant formation is not worth mentioning. The three of you and your formations should come together to save time.” Li Qiye interrupted, not bothering to look at them.

The three daoists became livid; their face turning white. The other disciples who were part of the formations felt the same way.

“Fine, we’ll cut you to pieces then!” The third-ranked daoist bellowed.

“Come, come.” Li Qiye waved his hand as if he was chasing away a fly.

His attitude was infuriating to his enemies. Fires of anger appeared in their eyes.

“Isn’t this too much?” Even the spectators thought so.

Remember, Three Truths still had an army and three sacred cultivators. Lu Yiling seemed unstoppable right now. A third-generation disciple said that he could massacre them? How ridiculous.

“Kill him!” The third daoist commanded.

The pagoda, great bird, and elephant all attacked Li Qiye at the same time.

“Screech!” The bird used its sharp beak, aiming straight for his head.

“Boom!” The elephant raised its front hooves, ready to make mincemeat out of him. Space cracked from its power.

“Poof!” The pagoda released an endless amount of flames, more than enough to turn Li Qiye to ashes.

Any one of these attacks should be able to send Li Qiye down to the Yellow River.

However, he didn’t bat an eye and simply raised his hand: “Scram.”

“Raa!” The golden dragon moved again, this time with a tail sweep.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” It wasn’t a fair contest. The tail destroyed everything in its path along with the three formations. The daoists and thousands of disciples got blown away.

The dragon’s tail aimed for them again, ready to deliver the finishing blow.

“Enough!” Three Truths Sect Master became startled and joined the fray.
