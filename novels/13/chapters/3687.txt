Chapter 3688: One Sword Move

Li Qiye commanded the attention of all the spectators.

Meanwhile, Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi were ready with their strongest defense. One was a ravaging tornado while the other was a boundless ocean separating the realms.

“Try this.” Li Qiye casually smiled and raised his saber again.

The crowd was filled with anticipation and excitement, especially the swordsmen. Their eyes were wide open, not wanting to miss the smallest detail.

He then gently pushed the saber forward.

“Sword Point again!” A spectator shouted. This would be their second time seeing Sword Emperor’s peerless technique.

“Right...” The expert swordsmen’s eyes started bulging forward, wanting to memorize his action. They wanted to understand the mysteries of this technique.

In the holy ground or even all of the southern West King, most have heard of Sword Point and knew the stance and pose.

Alas, how many actually understood it? That’s why the sword users here didn’t want to miss an actual display of the technique. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

If they tried their hardest observing Li Qiye, they might be able to successfully learn this technique as well.

They meticulously stared at the moving saber. Suddenly, something flashed in their mind.

They felt a separation process in the trajectory of the thrust. Time flowed by the blink of an eye before reversing in the other direction - a million years into the future then a million years back.

This messed with their mind. Both the expert swordsmen and the ancestors felt as if they were trapped in a chaotic dimension, not knowing where they were.

“Ah! Ahh!” They heard two screams and regained their wits, realizing that Li Qiye’s saber had pierced through the duo’s right chest.

Once Li Qiye pulled back, blood gushed out of the two holes. Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi fell from the sky and smashed into the ground. Their robe was stained red.

The spectators couldn’t react in time. They were still focusing on the slow movement of the blade but it somehow made it past the tornado and the boundless ocean.

The ferocious winds and the million miles of water didn’t matter at all. Defenses simply didn’t exist before Sword Point. Perhaps they were present in their current dimension but not in the others.

The majority of spectators simply couldn’t grasp the technique’s profundity. Some ancestors versed in the sword dao noticed a thing or two. The rest was still shrouded in fog.

“A spatio-temporal bypass?” One ancestor became emotional as if he had just grasped something new.

“I think so, the technique and movement don’t matter. The dimensional leap does.” Another elder who has studied the sword for more than a millennium agreed.

“Can this move alone make someone invincible?” One youth said in a daze.

The dazed spectators felt their heart beating faster. First, Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi pulled out their strongest offensive technique. Sword Point easily defeated this. Now, it effortlessly broke through their defenses as well.

Li Qiye didn’t use any other merit law or technique. Sword Point was all he needed.

This made people wonder - could this move alone be all one need to run rampant across Eight Desolaces? They started fantasizing about the possibilities.

“That’s why Sword Emperor stands out among the dao lords.” Someone commented: “Maybe it is really that strong, that’s why he left it to the academy.”

“It’s powerful beyond our imagination.” Another expert added: “No wonder why so few managed to learn it in history. Something at this level is definitely inscrutable.”

Groups talked among themselves; jealousy and envy could be seen since Li Qiye had attained something incredible.

“You know, I spent half a year, day and night, racking my brains out over each small detail and movement and got nothing from it, not even a tinge of power. Li Qiye only stared at it once and immediately understood it, it’s so unfair. The heaven is so cruel to me.” A Duality student looked up at the sky and expressed indignation.

“That’s nothing. I started at the academy when I was eight and went there to take a look every day for thirty years, got nothing from it too.” An older student said.

“Stop comparing yourself to Li Qiye. He’s the heaven’s favorite and gets everything he wants. No one else is on the same level as him, just blame this on inequality.” One more student smiled wryly.

Other experts didn’t feel the same blow as the students. It was because the latter group spent so much time on Comprehension Peak and got nothing in return, unlike Li Qiye.

By this point, Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi have finally gotten up. They sealed their wound and added ointment. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

They were completely pale; their knees trembled. This wound wasn’t serious or life-threatening. Alas, it scared the hell out of them.

Li Qiye used the same move and still managed to break both their offense and defense. Their confidence and pride have been shattered. They felt helpless and weak, unable to resist this powerful opponent.

“The right chest.” One spectator noted the wounds. Li Qiye kept his words and did just that.
