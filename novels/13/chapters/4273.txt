Chapter 4274: Unbeatable

He became spirited and his aura soared, exerting its dominance. His current state alone commanded respect and reverence even though he has yet to activate his power.

The battle must have been unimaginable. Regular cultivators couldn’t even envision it due to a complete difference in power scale. Li Qiye didn’t have this problem and could understand the details.

“My slash eliminated the myriad eras.” The man ended the summary with this. Flames sparked in his eyes and he returned to the past once more. Even the cosmo was only a speck of dust compared to his sword.

He wasn’t exaggerating or being poetic. His slash actually wielded this power.

History on the river of time became nothingness by that slash along with the current world. If this happened in Eight Desolaces, the eight worlds and their inhabitants would disappear in the blink of an eye.

The man stopped after this last phrase. The light flashing in his eyes also gradually dissipated. He calmed down and stopped looking solemn.

“But I still lost.” The man let out a wistful sigh.

He then stared at Li Qiye and said: “My sword was unbeatable, no other dao could touch me.”

His world had terrifying existences yet he remained supreme with his sword dao. Any of his opponents would have shocked Eight Desolaces.

“He used the sword to defeat me.” He stared at Li Qiye and revealed the shocking truth.

His sword dao was absolutely untouchable for many epochs. This was no exaggeration. Alas, that person used the sword to kill him, meaning that there was still a superior sword dao.

“And, the sword dao might not be his main.” He went on to say, meaning that person didn’t even use his strongest dao.

The latter didn’t need to go all out against an apex existence. This reality was truly daunting. What was his actual dao? Just how powerful would it be?

“Unbeatable.” Li Qiye concluded.

He knew just how powerful this man was. Thus, the outcome of this battle painted a better picture for his future opponent.

“Why must you fight him?” The man stared at Li Qiye.

“Why not?” Li Qiye said flatly.

“Why not? Haha, well said.” The man laughed after hearing the reason.

“But ultimately, my opponent is not him.” Li Qiye added.

The man paused for a while before agreeing: “Yes, our opponent isn’t someone else.”

“Indeed, only ourselves.” Li Qiye said.

Weaker cultivators usually viewed their rivals or certain challenges as their targets. However, for Li Qiye and this man, they only sought to surpass themselves.

“Your goal isn’t a fight, it’s part of your research.” The man said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“It’s an illness, I don’t like uncertainties and unknowns.” Li Qiye replied.

“I am the same way.” The man enjoyed the conversation and lamented their late meeting.

“What would you do if there is a possibility of you and him teaming up?” He then asked.

“That’s an interesting scenario. What would you say is his pursuit?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmm…” The man pondered, then shook his head: “It would be presumptuous for me to comment since I know very little about him. But I’m sure that he’ll start on the journey again just like before.”

“Can’t rest when the villainous heaven looms above.” Li Qiye agreed since existences like them would inevitably embark on this journey.

“So teaming up is a possibility?” The man inquired again.

“The choice isn’t there.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You’re right.” The man agreed because ultimately, only one person would make it to the end.

“Would you like to pick one?” He then looked up at the stars above.

“Those swords are magnificent but they aren’t meant for me. It would be a waste.” Li Qiye said.

“I see.” The man stared at Li Qiye and started thinking for a bit: “Well, I believe a battle between you two is inevitable.”

“Who knows? It’s not up to me.” Li Qiye responded.

“I have a sword technique.” The man’s tone suddenly became serious as he revealed his true intention.

Judging by this, this technique should be superior to the star swords above.

“I couldn’t win when I was alive.” The man elaborated: “I had a particular idea going. Alas, since I was the sword, I couldn’t be unsheathed. Now that I’m dead, this sword has been gestating and growing boundlessly.”

“I can only imagine.” Li Qiye knew that he would be impressed by this technique even without seeing it.

“My regret is not being able to use it.” He said.

“You wish to give me this sword.” Li Qiye stared at him.

“Yes.” The man was direct: “I can’t fight again since I’m dead, the battle would be meaningless. This isn’t the case for you. It will shine in your grasp.”

“I can’t win using your sword.” Li Qiye disagreed.

“I’m satisfied with it being unsheathed.” He smiled: “No need to try and win with it, just don’t let my effort in crafting go to waste.”

“I understand. I’ll give it a shot.” Li Qiye accepted.
