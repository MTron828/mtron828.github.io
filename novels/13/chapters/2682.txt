“Buzz.” The emperor was taking in more and more of the dao source. The clan started to have another shiny and frost-like layer.

This layer emanated from the emperor and spread at an insane rate. It didn’t take long before the entire system was covered. This engulfing layer of light gave the sense that the emperor was becoming one with the system.

Flowing runes then appeared on the shiny layers and started moving around like tentacles, drilling into every inch of the land.

Next, all the living beings in the system were shrouded with a similar glow, almost like a thin cloak. They felt an unprecedented closeness to their system as if they were the same entity now. They could sense the power of their dao land and the majestic forces looming below.

They thought that they were joining the emperor in fusing with the dao source as well so they started the elementary chant of their system. These members were willing to offer everything, including their lives.

Tidal splashes came about as another majestic scene emerged before the spectators. The vitality of these members headed for the shiny dao source since they were willing to become one with the emperor and their system.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The waves of vitality looked like multiple tsunamis heading for the same location - the emperor.

With the help of their vitality and grand dao power, the fusion process increased in speed. He crazily absorbed the various forces of the dao source like a whale taking in water...

This was the first time the crowd saw something so incredible. First, the unity of this system’s members but even more amazing was the heaven-defying method. Few would be able to imagine such a clever process.

“It’s not just the dao source, they want to fuse with everything in the system too.” One ancestor was lost in a daze.

“I agree, this fusion will take in everything of the system once completed.” One Eternal was moved.

Just imagine, what kind of power would come after combining everything possible in an entire system? People shuddered after this. Perhaps it would be a force comparable to a progenitor.

“Boom!” The long-awaited process finally finished. The emperor has fully taken in the dao source.

His mighty form right now made the stars look like specks of dust. He became the embodiment of a progenitor.

“So strong...” Everyone gasped after sensing his progenitorial aura filling up all of Imperial Lineage.

“Hahahaha!” The emperor’s peak state was interrupted by a peal of mocking laughter.

The ethereal daoist who should be fused with the emperor suddenly appeared again and took over the emperor’s control of the Mu System.

A spear pierced downward from the top of the emperor’s head all the way through his body before pinning into the ground.

“No!!!” The emperor screamed but he couldn’t move at all, completely immobilized by the spear.

“What?!” The spectators were astounded by this development.

“Buzz.” The shiny dao source suddenly devoured everything from the system, all the worldly energies.

“Ahh!” The members of the Mu were robbed of their true blood, lifespan, and energy. These essences flew out, resulting in them all exploding into pieces.

The cruel scene happened in the blink of an eye. Billions and billions of disciples instantly lost their lives. The stolen essences entered the brilliant expanse where the daoist stood.

“No!” The emperor bellowed again after seeing the death of his system members. Alas, all he could do was watch. The unbearable agony tore his mind apart.

“You think I wanted to help you? It’s only time for me to harvest.” The daoist nefariously smirked.

“Buzz.” He then fused with the emperor’s body again.

“Ahh!!!” The emperor’s cries echoed across the world, helpless against the intruder.

They have already completed a fusion earlier but the emperor was in charge of this process. However, the daoist has successfully seized control and took all of these powers for his own.

“The magpie made a nest, the turtledove dwells in it.” The crowd understood the obvious situation. [1] RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The truth was that the daoist gave this fusion technique to the Mu. He had full control of it now and the emperor couldn’t resist at all. He became the main body while everyone else served as his nutrients.

“Who are the real chess players now?” Lucidity King smiled while watching from a distance.

He laid out this board as a trap for the Mu, wanting to use the daoist to destroy this system. Of course, the daoist also needed this endless power, so the two were more than happy to conspire together.

The Mu wanted to work with the daoist to fight Li Qiye. Who would have thought that they were only pawns on Lucidity King’s chessboard? Not only did they lose their clan but also their entire system.

They were someone else’s prey from the very start of this devious plan.
