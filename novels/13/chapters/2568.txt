Li Yuzhen glanced at the sky for a second before speaking: “Will this apocalypse come here?”

She couldn’t imagine the gravity of the situation at all.

“Three Immortals World is very lucky.” He chuckled: “Generations passed by on the river of time and it has escaped the terrifying years. This required perfect luck and the effort of the old sages.”

She quietly listened. Though she didn’t have a full grasp of all the information, she was still shaken by this revelation.

She found out about the worlds outside of Three Immortals and the darkness plaguing them.

“So what’s the reason behind these apocalypses from the high heaven?” She asked.

He only answered with a smile. He then stopped and squatted down, picking up pieces from the ground. They seemed to be sticky skin fragments as if a tentacle has fallen down from above.

“A bit interesting, how did this devious thing come here? It doesn’t make sense.” He stared intensely at it.

“Pop!” A tiny tentacle emerged out of the piece of skin and tried to dig into Li Qiye’s body - quite a nauseating sight.

He smiled and ignited a plume of fire in his palm with an indigo shade.

“Buzz.” The fire burned the pieces into ashes scattering away.

Next, he gazed at the sky once more in an investigative manner.

“It doesn’t make sense... how did it come down? Looks like no place is safe anymore.” He himself became startled and murmured.

He recalled the skeleton found in the heavenly prison and contemplated. These events weren’t that simple. An underlying current has started, issuing changes in the depths. This world just didn’t know about it.

“Could you elaborate on the world above?” She quietly asked.

“It’s full of terrors beyond your imagination.” He looked back and said seriously.

She inquired: “How so? The people there are incomparably strong?”

“It’s just one way to describe it, akin to how immortal is just another description. Do you know what immortals look like?” He chuckled.

“Immortals?” She has never seen one before.

Who has actually seen a true immortal? Probably none in history. People simply didn’t have a good idea about these beings.

“Why are you bringing up immortals right now?” She had a bad feeling about this and stared at Li Qiye.

“People have two reactions to the unknown - fear and curiosity.” Li Qiye looked at her and said: “Fear stems from invincibility and power while curiosity stems from ignorance. The latter also encompasses desire and hope. For example, some yearn for the light while others are afraid of darkness.”

She quietly contemplated.

“If you could be granted any wish, what would it be?” He smilingly asked.

“Immortality.” She answered without needing to think.

This response was quite common. Many top experts chased after everlasting life. After all, obtaining this would solve many problems. Infinite time would allow people to do many things.

“What about after obtaining immortality?” He continued.

Now this question finally stumped her since she has never thought about it before.

Immortality was unreachable, only a dream. If the dream itself was impossible to obtain, why would anyone think about what comes after?

She thought about it and couldn’t answer the question.

He began again: “Immortality in the truest sense of the word doesn’t exist in this world. To overcome this requires paying a great price. If you ever see a real immortal in the future, you need to start running as far away as the world allows.”

“Why?” She slightly grimaced, having a good idea of the bad implication.

“Because he’s an immortal with everlasting life.” Li Qiye said with a profound gaze.

Yuzhen shuddered since she grasped several things so far during this conversation.

For many people, meeting an immortal would be a once-in-the-ages opportunity, the greatest of luck. No one would miss this chance to ask many questions.

But now, Li Qiye proposed to do the opposite - run as far away as possible.

Going against conventional wisdom sounded insane to others, but not to Li Yuzhen.

He stopped then looked around and said: “This is only the beginning of a hunt, that’s all.”

“Dao Brother, other cities might meet the same fate?” She stopped as well.

“Yes.” He nodded: “Attacking White Orchid is akin to using a butcher’s blade to kill a chicken. It will grow stronger and hungrier.”

“Dao Brother, could you find it so we can destroy it together?” She took a deep breath and powerfully said.

Though she didn’t want to play the role of a savior all the time, she would never stand and watch when evil was happening in front of her eyes.

“It’s not easy to chase after it.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Let’s leave this place first.”

He flew to the sky after saying this with Yuzhen right behind him. The two of them returned to the edge of the abyss.

At this moment, more people were coming from the horizons. The sudden disappearance of White Orchid finally attracted other masters who rushed here to figure it out.

“Dao Brother, unfortunately, I have some other tasks to deal with and will have to leave for now. See you another day.” Yuzhen cupped her fist, aware that it was time to leave after seeing other people arriving on the scene.

He nodded: “See you later.”

Her figure flashed into nothingness. It wasn’t hard for someone at her level to be untraceable. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Li Qiye sensed the beat of the world and narrowed his gaze towards one particular direction: “Looks like chaos is coming. Are the sages of Three Immortals ready?”

He stepped into the sky and rushed forward with a clear path in mind.

He traveled through multiple mountains before stopping in a valley since he heard shoutings.

An old man was imprisoned by tree demons in this valley. They raised their vine whips, preventing him from leaving.

He tried multiple times to escape but couldn’t, only gaining more bloody wounds in the process. His vitality gradually depleted so he put up less of a fight.

The tree demons pushed further in with a ferocious expression - ready to drink blood and consume flesh.

He lost hope and lamented loudly: “This is the end for me!”

“Pop!” Li Qiye interrupted his moment of despair by casually piercing through several tree demons with one finger strike. The rest became afraid and ran away.

He regained his composure and became ecstatic after being saved.

“Thank you for saving me, Young Noble.” He bowed his head after seeing his rescuer.
