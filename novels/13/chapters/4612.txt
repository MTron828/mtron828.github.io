Chapter 4613: Jian Ming’s Thoughts

“Can we enter as well?” Jian Ming couldn’t help but ask.

“Feel free to try.” Li Qiye smiled.

Jian Ming came over to her spot earlier and copied her actions - forming a mudra while chanting before finishing with a shout: “Open!”

No reaction came from the boulder; the runes didn’t light up all the way.

“We’ll see about that!” Jian Ming repeated the same thing and shouted louder this time: “Open!”

He eventually gave up and it was the daoist’s turn. He came and knocked on it several times then paid particular attention to the embedded runes. Eventually, he shook his head and concluded: “Don’t waste your time, you can’t solve these ancient runes. They work together to form an extremely complicated dao chapter.”

“It is unique indeed.” Paramount Scion sighed and said. Since he came from a great power, he had seen plenty of strange treasures before. This particular boulder was particularly intriguing. It made people want to carry it back home for further research.

“Even if you can understand the runes, you still won’t be able to enter.” Li Qiye elaborated: “This is a dao door specifically created for a single person. You need to be from this race and have the right bloodline. Otherwise, it is impossible to forcefully enter.”

“So it was created for the lady?” Jian Ming murmured and gave up.

“Pretty much.” Li Qiye said: “It is to leave behind a legacy for future descendants, it is an obsession of wanting to leave a mark.”

“Where does it lead to?” Jian Ming asked. Xiao Xuan obviously didn’t enter the boulder. It must have been a teleportation device.

“Only Xiao Xuan knows.” Li Qiye said: “Perhaps a large-scale domain or dimension. The legacy of a mighty race won’t be so simple.”

“Sigh, why didn’t she take me along? I could have carried some trunks for her, she can’t carry all of them by herself.” Jian Ming lamented.

“Your dirty hands won’t be able to help themselves.” The daoist laughed with disdain.

“Swindler, don’t think everyone is as wretched as yourself.” Jian Ming retorted: “I am a member of an orthodox clan and would never do something that lowly. I have more sense than that.”

The daoist answered with a doubtful sneer.

“Let’s go take a look around.” Li Qiye smiled and suggested.

“We’re not waiting for the lady?” Jian Ming became surprised.

“I’m afraid she won’t be coming out any time soon. It’s fine.” Li Qiye said.

“How about we visit my sect?” Ye Tingrong took this opportunity to invite Li Qiye.

He glanced at her and the daoist immediately whispered: “Young Noble, should we go? We might as well try to propose for the brat while we’re there.”

“Not this crap again!” Jian Ming’s ears were sharp enough to hear.

Li Qiye stared at him and rubbed his chin: “Not a bad idea, I can help you two get together.”

Jian Ming turned red again, the same with Ye Tingrong. Nonetheless, the latter remained relatively composed.

“It’ll be successful for sure with you involved, Young Noble.” Paramount Scion said.

“Didn’t your sect propose too?” Jian Ming glared at him.

“That’s the will of the ancestors, not mine, and as you already know, we’re not the only ones either.” Paramount Scion said.

“So you’re just a side actor.” Jian Ming said.

“Of course, Three Thousand Dao has plenty of geniuses, the same for True Immortal and its vassals.” The scion smiled naturally.

“Those geniuses aren’t worth mentioning.” The daoist smiled: “They will have to stand aside before the young noble. The real question is whether Miss Ye is interested in our brat.”

“Swindler, didn’t I already make myself clear?! We’re being very insensitive toward Miss Ye right now.” Jian Ming shouted.

“I do not mind a proposal from the young noble on your behalf. After all, I won’t be the one deciding.” She calmly said.

“Miss Ye, you know what I meant, I don’t want you to feel offended.” Jian Ming smiled awkwardly.

“Very well, we’re going to Diamond Gate.” Li Qiye had nothing else to do.

As they were on their way, the daoist whispered to Jian Ming: “Brat, if this goes well, then your trip will be something else. Your ancestors will laugh happily after seeing you bringing a beauty back and will forgive you for your past transgressions.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“My ass, the two families haven’t even exchanged the introductory letters yet.” Jian Ming glared at him.

“We’re talking about introductory letters now? Looks like you are really interested in her then.” The daoist whispered back.

“You’ve been spewing a lot of shit. Watch it or I’ll knock your dog head off.” Jian Ming knocked on the daoist’s head.

The daoist laughed and started running away. This left Jian Ming standing there in embarrassment and explained himself: “The swindler doesn’t know when to shut up, I just taught him a lesson, that’s all.”

“Dao Brother, as I’ve said, I do not mind a proposal from you at all.” Tingrong smiled.

“I…I…” Jian Ming stammered, unable to say anything. This was a stark contrast to his usual self, having no qualms spitting out venomous words.

Li Qiye chuckled after seeing this. Memories of the past returned regarding the young geniuses. They grew up to be mighty characters and desired by everyone.

Unfortunately, no one remembered their romantic tales anymore. Li Qiye might be one of the few exceptions.

He sighed sentimentally about his own matters. Alas, this gorgeous world and its magnificent women couldn’t keep him from walking forward.
