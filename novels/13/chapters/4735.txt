Chapter 4736: Tian Feng’s Return

“Rumble!” Space had a hard time accommodating this influx of power. This created continuous detonation and cracking noises.

The ethereal walls near Li Qiye had cracks everywhere. The trio appeared to be existing in a glass world. The power coming from this place could instantly turn cultivators into bloody mists.

The crowd wisely backed off even farther away, not wanting to die a needless death.

“Boom!” The dimension collapsed.

The original master was none other than Five-sun King’s bowl, a rare artifact capable of creating its own dimension.

It had previously replaced the real world and trapped Li Qiye within. Now, the collision between Li Qiye’s palms and the slash destroyed the containment. The slash also collapsed at the same time, rendering the shockwaves even more intolerable.

This meant that the duo has lost to Li Qiye. The region was reduced to apocalyptic ashes after the exchange.

“Ahh!” They were sent flying again after the containment was breached. The explosion resembled an ambushing beast, catching them fully off guard and making them bleed.

Li Qiye leaped into the air and raised his hand, wanting to kill both the duo with an energy palm. The ground sank down into the shape of his palm.

“Shit!” The aghast duo summoned resplendent treasures with surging dao power to stop the incoming attack.

“Boom!” The treasures went down instantly.

“Ugh…” The suppression made them vomit blood.

Meanwhile, spectators thought that these two would either die or at best - alive but crippled.

“Activate!” A large figure suddenly joined the battle during this crucial moment and pushed up against Li Qiye’s great palm.

The ground beneath turned into a basin, on the verge of being pierced through by the continuous force.

Spectators saw that it was none other than Tian Feng who had lost to Li Qiye previously. He kept his human form this time. His muscles bulged visibly as he tried his best; each seemed to contain the power of a gigantic dragon.

“Dao Brother, I still want to fight despite my last defeat. I will be joining them, I hope you don’t mind.” Tian Feng laughed.

This caught everyone off guard since they thought that he was currently crippled. Alas, he appeared perfectly fine right now.

“I’m afraid you won’t be as lucky this time, do you wish to throw your life away?” Li Qiye maintained the pressure and asked with a smile.

“Leave it up to fate since this is what my heart desires. What’s so good about life or what’s there to be afraid of regarding death?” Tian Feng’s battle spirit remained lofty and intimidated the crowd.

Tian Feng was still Tian Feng, never faltering regardless of the enemy and ready to die in battle. This earned him the crowd’s respect since Li Qiye utterly destroyed him last time. He was on the verge of death yet he still came again.

Others would find this suicidal and idiotic. Losing to Li Qiye wasn’t shameful at all, especially not after recent events. However, here he was without a hint of hesitation.

“Rumble!” The power of his bloodline was pushed to the extreme in order to hold the line. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Go!” Since he was still losing ground, his forehead became resplendent with a red glow. His body then became translucent.

Eventually, people saw something resembling a ruby on his forehead, looking heavy and coarse. They thought that it contained countless firmaments with boundless weight.

“Azure Madstone!” An ancient demon monarch recognized the ruby and shouted.

“What’s that?” Those nearby asked him.

The monarch solemnly answered: “A unique stone in history, the defining treasure of the mad frogs.”
