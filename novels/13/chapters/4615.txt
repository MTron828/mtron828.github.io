Chapter 4616: Puppets

“Loser, this will not end until I kill you.” Voidchild’s eyes released intimidating eyes, seemingly capable of turning Jian Ming into a sieve.

“Poof!” His flames intensified. This was a type of dao flame capable of melting any metals with a single touch. Strangely enough, it gave off an impression of being unbearably cold.

This was due to his murderous intent, making those standing nearby feel as if they were stuck in an ice pit. His hatred for Jian Ming was as obvious as can be.

“We got ourselves a show.” Both members of Golden Gate and visitors were ready to watch this exciting development. They wanted more chaos to potentially take advantage of the situation.

After all, they were here for several days now and nothing happened. Maybe this could serve as a catalyst. It didn’t take long before the place was packed with cultivators.

The atmosphere became heated since the two combatants had nothing but vitriol for each other.

“Who’ll win?” People started speculating.

“Probably Voidburn Godchild.” An old man said: “Voidburn can’t compare to the behemoths but its progenitor was still the first disciple of Eight-step Dragon Dao Lord. He had access to top arts on top of creating the Fire Dragon Mantra, something comparable to dao lord merit laws.”

“True, they have considerable resources and history, albeit not on the same level as Divine Dragon Valley.” Someone from the west nodded in agreement: “This godchild has abilities from his race on top of cultivating the Fire Dragon Mantra.”

“We’ll see about that. This kid from the Jian is not bad at all. He hangs out with some ruffians but also top masters. The latter must be indicative of his ability.” Someone who recognized Jian Ming said.

“That’s not all.” Another with more knowledge of Jian Ming’s clan said: “His clan is ancient and has earned the favor of a supreme existence. They cannot be underestimated.”

“Just watch, I still believe Voidburn Godchild has the upper hand.” One more said: “A fire cloud fowl is extremely fierce, not to mention his top arts and numerous treasures.”

“We’ll find out soon enough.” The others said.

“Loser, come meet your maker!” Voidburn Godchild roared.

“I’m waiting, chicken!” Jian Ming didn’t relent; his eyes pulsed brightly. He seemed to be turning into a different person, not leisurely and carefree like before.

After all, he was from a great clan. His true aura and brilliance finally revealed themselves once he became serious. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Oh, not too bad.” The daoist got a new perspective on Jian Ming and praised: “How manly, not a hoodlum anymore.”

“Seems like I’m just a frog under the well.” Paramount Scion said after seeing Jian Ming’s heaven-devouring momentum.

Most remembered him as a foul-mouthed bastard. Now, he showed everyone a different side.

Ye Tingrong was surprised and stared at him in amazement.

“A pillar of the Jian won’t be a useless idiot.” Li Qiye wasn’t surprised at all.

“Boom!” Voidburn Godchild’s vitality erupted along with chaos true energy. Dao halos also appeared amidst his flames.

“Seven-dao Heavenly Sovereign!” His cultivation level became apparent to the crowd.

“Rumble!” His flames soared to the sky, eagle to incinerate the stars.

“Such powerful cloud flames.” A fire-affinity expert was surprised.

“Poof!” Jian Ming summoned four spheres. They fell to the ground and created a dust storm.

Once the dust settled, four gigantic puppets appeared before the crowd. Each had long and big runes intertwining everywhere. Their materials were also strange, looking like both stone and wood yet were neither.

“Die! Cloud Flame Incineration!” Voidburn Godchild grabbed some flames and formed a mudra.

The flames turned into a firebird. It spread its wings and released a torrent of power toward Jian Ming. Everything standing in its way was reduced to ashes.

Cultivators nearby immediately retreated in order to not be burnt to a crisp.

“Go.” Jian Ming was undeterred and ordered his four puppets to attack.

One of them leaped upward, leaving a massive pair of prints on the ground.

“Raa!” It roared like a primal beast and released boundless purple lights. They came together to form a shield.

“Boom!” The sky started shaking violently. Deafening blasts assaulted the listeners.

Both the firebird and the puppet didn’t relent for a single moment, continuing to release their power.

However, the other three puppets joined the fight and surrounded the firebird. The latter screeched and flapped its wings, taking its offense to the next level. Alas, this wasn’t enough to stop the puppets.

“Bam!” Two of them grabbed the bird’s wings while the third pulled its tail.
