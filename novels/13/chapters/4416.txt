Chapter 4417: Ancient Banner

Celestial Tiger and Shenfan Tianjie glared at each other while preparing their weapon.

Spectators watched with bated breath during this tense atmosphere. It was a relatively significant battle - Dragon versus the east.

“First Brother got this.” The members of Dragon were furious at Shenfan Tianjie. If their first brother were to lose, they wouldn’t be able to keep their head up again. Moreover, Dragon would lose a justification to stop the engagement.

“Shenfan Tianjie is exceptional.” A neutral expert from the east tried to be objective and said: “He was given the name Tianjie, a testament to the boy’s talent.” [1]

“Right, the two should have fought back then.” An eastern clan member said.

Celestial Tiger had traveled to the east and defeated numerous geniuses there. However, Shenfan Tianjie was not around. Otherwise, a fight between them would have been inevitable.

“Fellow Daoist, watch out now.” Shenfan Tianjie’s eyes pulsed coldly.

“Boom!” He slammed the pole of his banner into the ground, nearly penetrating the entire thing. The banner started fluttering and expanding upward.

The sky immediately turned dark and caught spectators off guard. The banner seemingly turned into the skyvault and encompassed everything.

“He’s strong indeed.” The ancestors from both sides couldn’t help but praise. It was obvious that he has surpassed the majority of the young generation.

“His clan has true masters of creating banners. They have been doing this for eras now, the banner in his hand is definitely made with the clan’s top secrets.” A big shot from the east said.

For the Shenfan, creating banners wasn’t only a way to create weapons and treasures. This was also a type of merit law for cultivation.

“If you lose while being trapped under my banner, I’m afraid you’ll die because I might not be able to control it from refining you into a puddle of blood.” Shenfan Tianjie’s voice echoed in the darkness. He disappeared and became part of the night sky.

“Don’t hold back.” Celestial Tiger wasn’t afraid in the slightest: “If I turn into a puddle of blood, I can only blame myself for being weak. However, the opposite applies as well if I kill you.”

Both sides didn’t hide their animosity and brutality. Neither would hold back in this fight.

“Good. Sky Obliteration!” Shenfan Tianjie began right away.

The audience felt violent trembling; some turned pale as a result. The entire sky seemed to be falling down - the start of an apocalypse.

“Dragon Ascension!” Celestial Tiger roared and thrust his spear into the sky.

Boundless golden radiance rushed out and turned into a dragon's head with a tsunamic aura.

This naturally impressed the audience and made them bellow in astonishment.

“Raa!” The dragon head smashed the falling sky. Numerous pieces scattered downward as a result.

“Tyrannical Dragons!” He roared and focused more energy onto the tip of the spear. Nine dragons fully materialized and clawed the sky.

“Sky Shower Banner!” Shenfan Tianjie retaliated by releasing nine banners large enough to coil around the dragons.

“Boom!” The dragons struggled and tried to tear the banner to pieces. Alas, this proved to be futile.

“Dragon Inferno!” Celestial Tiger ordered the dragons to open their bloody jaws, seemingly wanting to devour the world.

They spewed out endless lava, assaulting every conceivable direction. This successfully burned the restrictive banners.

“Devil Wind Banner!” Shenfan Tianjie waved his hand and tornados descended, destroying both the ground and the fiery torrents.

The auras of two sovereigns ravaged the entire battlefield. They exchanged dozens of moves in the blink of an eye, not holding back in the slightest.

The weaker cultivators had a hard time keeping up. Some became paralyzed from the pressure of this even fight.

Nonetheless, this was an eye-opening experience. Most were completely immersed in watching their impressive techniques; some loudly blurted out praises.

“Ancestral Coil Banner!” Shenfan Tianjie took it more seriously and summoned numerous godfiends.

They turned the world into a blanket with Celestial Tiger stuck in the center. It wrapped tightly and immobilized him.

“There is no escaping this technique. He’ll be refined into a puddle of blood in there.” An expert from the east was horrified by this technique.

“Really?” Those nearby became startled, especially the ones from Dragon.

“Watch out, First Brother!” One of them shouted.

“Fellow Daoist, you’re in trouble now.” Shenfan Tianjie was glad to see Celestial Tiger unable to dodge his technique. He had seized the upper hand.
