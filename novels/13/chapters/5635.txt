Chapter 5636: Human-monarch Bloodline


Six-dao Human Monarch had eleven wills. However, due to his unprecedented bloodline, he was able to compete against the twelve-will emperors and monarchs.

“Sacred Teacher, do you know who had this bloodline before Six-dao Human Monarch?” Sindragon couldn’t help but ask.

“The lord of Celestial Court.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Celestial Court’s lord?” Sindragon found this unexpected and asked: “Sword Emperor? No, Nether Emperor? Can’t be either, what about Solidarity Heaven Emperor?”

He named several great Grand Emperors and didn’t agree with any of them.

Sword came from the Qian and was a diviner. Ultimately, the lord of Celestial Court had always been a member of the three great races. A human or any of the hundred races couldn’t take this position.

True to its name, the Human-monarch bloodline should appear on a human or perhaps a member of the hundred races. Sindragon couldn’t come up with an actual answer.

“The founder of Celestial Court, its true leader.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“I see, we have heard of something like this before, a mythical character.” Sindragon said.

Celestial Court was a behemoth that had existed for so long. Few knew its origin due to its age. This was virtually untraceable at this point.

Only characters of Sindragon’s level had some clues and knowledge regarding this mysterious founder.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Solidarity, Nether, and Sword had the “lord” title but they weren’t the true rulers of Celestial Court, more like generational representatives.

“Seems like you know quite a lot.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We have never seen the founder before, I think only two have had this privilege, Jiao Heng and Duality Master.” Sindragon said and contemplated in silence.

It was rather strange because even the upper echelons of Celestial Court didn’t know more. Perhaps only the lords had met the founder previously.

“It’s somehow ostentatious, all the secrets.” Li Qiye joked.

The founder was the true ruler of Celestial Court, sitting at the top together with the three immortals.

“From what I heard, this founder personally welcomed Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng and Duality Master during their visit. They were treated as esteemed guests and allowed freedom to travel anywhere in Celestial Court.” Sindragon commented.

This was a testament to Jiao Heng and Duality’s influence and prestige - to have an audience with an elusive and legendary figure.

“This was a rather big deal.” Sindragon stared at Li Qiye and said: “Sir, are you saying that this founder is the one?”

“Yes, the lord possesses the Human-monarch bloodline.” Li Qiye revealed.

“Impossible!” Sindragon couldn’t help but blurt despite being a composed dao lord. This simply didn’t make any sense but Li Qiye was the one revealing this information.

“The lord of Celestial Court is, is a human…?” He stammered.

This founder was a supreme existence looming above the three great races, having commanded them for eras.

Everyone knew that Celestial Court was the fortress of the three races. Some considered it to be their homeland, especially for emperors and monarchs.

Although some members of the hundred races still joined Celestial Court, this was a faction for the three races, not to mention their prejudice and stance against The People.

When taking the past into account, it seemed unfathomable for the founder of Celestial Court to be human.

“Why not?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Well…” Sindragon had no response. Sure, “impossible” wasn’t the right word for the situation. The founder of Celestial Court didn’t necessarily have to be a member of the three races. This was merely their initial impression, and as the saying goes - the first impression is always the strongest.

“Who is this founder then, how come the world knows so little?” Sindragon calmed down and asked.

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t elaborate.

Sindragon couldn’t shake the issue from his mind. A human? Why would a human hate their kind and the hundred races so much?

“Over there.” As they flew over the ocean of blood, Sindragon looked up and said: “That’s where Fellow Daoist Thousand-hand is.”

“Over there?” Li Qiye followed his gaze and assessed the situation: “Were you two only here to explore?”

“Thousand-hand saw a nirvana immortal vessel in this ocean but something unexpected happened next.” Sindragon said.

“Nirvana vessel?” Li Qiye’s brow furrowed.

“We gave it this name and don’t know if it’s a real thing in this world.” Sindragon smiled wryly: “It has the power of the reincarnation affinity though.”

An island was up ahead but given its size, it might be more accurate to call it a large reef. It looked ordinary but the same couldn’t be said about the sky directly above it.

It seemed to be broken with a hole. Light came down and illuminated the reef, showing the broken spatial fabrics in all directions. They resembled pieces of broken glass.

Upon closer inspection of the hole, it seemed to be a spatial passage leading to somewhere.
