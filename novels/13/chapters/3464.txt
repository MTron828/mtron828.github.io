Everyone got chills after witnessing the previous exchange.

“The power of a phoenix.” They truly believed that Li Qiye had a phoenix bloodline. This allowed him to control the flames here.

“This brat is too lucky.” Some became jealous because a phoenix was one of the most powerful divine beasts. This ordinary guy actually had the prestigious bloodline.

The trio kept on puking several times before stabilizing their vitality. Nonetheless, they were as pale as can be, staggering backward in fear because of the lava armor.

“So weak, I didn’t even do anything yet. You all would die after a single stomp then.” Li Qiye casually remarked.

The casualness worsened the blow on the three. They nearly vomited blood again from anger while their expression darkened. Unfortunately, the three geniuses had no retort because Li Qiye was telling the truth.

There was an invisible palm grasping their throat, stopping any anger from coming out. They have never felt this level of frustration before.

The spectators felt the same way, speechless. Even those who hated Li Qiye or were jealous of him had nothing to say.

He really just stood there and didn’t do a single thing. The lava armor did it all; the eruption of its power sent the group flying, going as far as grievously injuring them.

“How?!” The first prince shouted, unable to accept this.

He once loomed above everyone. Now, his opponent didn’t move a finger and he lost completely. This was as humiliating as can be.

Worst of all, he lost to someone he completely looked down on. In his mind, Li Qiye was nothing more than a piece of trash.

“You all said that I have a phoenix bloodline. Consider it that. And it is true that this place used to be the nest of a phoenix, a place for rebirth.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

Everyone exchanged glances, thinking that he had confirmed this speculation.

Only the latter half was actually true. Because this place used to be the rebirth area of a phoenix, Li Qiye had full control over its power.

At this point, the princess raised her hand. The ancestors from Firmaments and the armies of Yin Yang and Skylight moved forward.

“Rumble!” The cavalry of Skylight surrounded the first prince.

“Get in formation!” An ancestor shouted at the first prince. He immediately joined the group.

Firmaments Sword Formation also activated above with loud clunks. Divine Swords emerged to form a great formation.

“Get back!” An ancestor from Firmaments pulled the godchild back in to complete the formation.

As for Wu ZHongtian, he also returned to the army of Yin Yang. One wouldn’t be able to notice him anymore since he became a part of it.

“If you wish to challenge all of us alone, Young Noble Li, we will do as you wish. It will be an honorless victory and I apologize for it.” The princess politely said.

“Honorless victory? Whatever, you can come too. I’ll kill all of you to prevent further annoyance.” Li Qiye smiled and did a hand gesture, telling them to come.

Everyone took a deep breath since they no longer viewed Li Qiye as arrogant. He had shown himself to be worthy of speaking like this.

“Is it possible? Those armies probably have one hundred thousand men.” One spectator whispered.

“Wait and see.” An older expert didn’t know the answer.

After all, the other side had an overwhelming force with actual ancestors. Though not that many were here, they were the strongest characters in their sects.

They no longer cared about seniority and actually worked together with their fellow members to fight a junior.

“Okay, please broaden our horizon, Young Noble Li.” The princess solemnly nodded. Their foe was invincible right now due to his bloodline and the area.

Of course, she also thought about escaping but it seemed that he wouldn’t just let them leave.

The two sides have broken all facades of friendliness. A fight to the death was in order. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Firmaments Sword Art!” An ancestor shouted and the swords up above started spinning to form a terrible hurricane. It tore the sky vault apart and was enough to drag a star down and crush it to pieces, the same with a sect.

People shuddered after seeing this. Being stuck in there meant being crushed. Merit laws and treasures were useless.

“Raa!” Skylight’s army turned into a golden dragon. This was their famous Regal Draconic Formation that had saved their country many times from invaders.

“Boom!” It landed on the ground and created cracks everywhere. It roared and released its torrential aura, showing off its destructiveness.

“The king of Skylight once presided over this formation and killed a Heavenly Sovereign near the border, or so they say.” One spectator commented.

Both Firmaments and Skylight have made their move. Only Yin Yang’s army stood still. Because they were shrouded by chaos true energy of the yin yang affinity, no one could see what they were doing. This made them look even more dangerous.

“What will Yin Yang Gate do?” Someone wondered.
