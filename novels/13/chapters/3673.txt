Chapter 3674: Take Whatever You Want

The trio took a while before finally going through the entire treasury. They might be the only outsiders who have accomplished this feat.

The place had enough treasures to keep Yang Ling impressed at the start. As they moved on, she gradually grew numb after seeing enough treasures. A sense of normality took over. Only a few things could startle her afterward.

Li Qiye didn’t share the same sentiment. This treasury was large but he only stared at them in passing with a smile.

His goal was to broaden her horizon. Only a few things here were barely qualified to enter his sight.

“Do you like any of them? Take whatever you want.” He casually asked.

“Take whatever I want?” She stared at the treasures in a daze. Anyone else would be ecstatic after hearing this since it meant immense wealth and a bright future.

“No? So you only came to take a look?” He replied.

She found that this was right. The crime was serious if Vajra were to find out. However, she was already here and had to bring some treasures back. Leaving empty-handed was not an option.

It became a question of which treasure. She looked around and didn’t know what to pick due to the sheer quantity.

She was naturally excited before entering the treasury. Now, all of them were up for grab and she had no idea what she wanted.

“Which one should I pick?” She asked, bewildered.

“If you don’t mind grabbing too many, just take all of them.” He chuckled.

“Al-all of them? I don’t think that’s a good idea...” She trembled after hearing this.

Vajra might go crazy and search the entire holy ground in order to find the thief. If they were to catch wind of her being the culprit, her clan would suffer their unmitigated wrath. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Vajra will exterminate my clan.” She smiled wryly, not daring to take the entire thing.

“We’ll see about that.” He chuckled in response.

“Let’s not do it.” She thought carefully and chose against it. Li Qiye’s suggestion was truly tempting.

This treasury was enough to benefit the future generations, not just herself. If her clan could use the resource appropriately, they could become a separate country, no need to stay as a tributary of Vajra.

But on the other hand, the risks were serious since Vajra could go wild. She had no choice but to give up.

“Just pick a few things then.” He didn’t interfere with her decision.

This brought them back to the starting point - not knowing which treasure to pick.

“Young Master, what should I pick?” She eventually asked for guidance.

“Depends on what you want. If you wish to be safe, then pick materials and chaos stones. These things are untraceable on top of being easy to use with effective results.” He answered.

“That makes sense.” She agreed with this suggestion.

Top weapons were naturally tempting for cultivators. They would usually be the first choice but in this case, she wouldn’t be able to use them since Vajra would find out right away.

This wasn’t the case for materials and money. Even if they realized the missing amount, they wouldn’t be able to trace it either. Materials could be turned into treasures while money could be spent to buy merit laws or weapons.

There were no markings on them for Vajra to trace. Plus, she didn’t need to spend them at the holy ground either. Traveling to Righteous Sect or the south was an option.

Therefore, she gathered plenty of materials and money. The coins were only a small portion in the treasury but still enough to make her extremely wealthy, rivaling a few countries and sects.

Materials were harder to pick because she didn’t know which ones were good or the right combinations. That’s why Li Qiye gave her several recommendations for good materials.

She didn’t go overboard with the amount and was still satisfied. Taking too much would make it easier for Vajra to spot that something was amiss.

“Don’t forget the treasures now.” He said.

“I just don’t want Vajra to notice right away.” She hesitated.

Taking treasures was bad because Vajra would note the missing ones with haste. Plus, they would serve as evidence later too.

“You don’t need to use them, just keep them as ace cards.” Li Qiye smiled: “Plus, once you’re strong enough, you can use them whenever. Do you see any sect coming to demand an explanation from Five-colored Sacred Sovereign?”

Yang Ling agreed with this as well. Her clan could keep them hidden until there was no other choice.

Five-colored Sacred Sovereign was the perfect example. The victims wouldn’t dare to do anything to him right now.

“Okay, I’ll pick a few.” Yang Ling pondered for a bit before selecting the treasures. The Archaic Sun World Diagram and Devourer Bell were included.

A few more weren’t weaker than these two but Yang Ling wasn’t greedy enough.

“I heard Vajra Dao Lord left behind some top weapons for the dynasty. I didn’t see any.” Yang Ling became curious since there was no dao lord weapon here.

According to the rumors, the dao lord initially didn’t care much about Vajra. However, the latter spent enough effort to win his favor. The dao lord kept this and his roots in mind, eventually leaving top weapons behind for the dynasty.

“That means there’s another secret one.” Li Qiye smiled, not caring about it.

Li Qiye picked a few merit laws and scrolls from the library section. The dynasty has been around long enough to have a great selection.

They included the ones created by the ancestors and forefathers of Vajra. Some originated from the sects and countries destroyed by Vajra.

“Back to the original owners.” Li Qiye picked some and put them away before Yang Ling could see.

He then gave others to Yang Ling and said: “Now you have treasures and resources. You need to be stronger, the same with your clan. Thus, they will be of use.”

“Thank you, Young Master.” She was overwhelmed with gratitude, aware that everything she got today was due to him.
