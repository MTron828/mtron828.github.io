Chapter 5644: Pinned

“The ancient ming was used as a blueprint.” Thousand-hand and Sindragon realized that in the past, someone had researched the creation of this terrible race.

They relied on the Human-monarch Bloodline, wanting to birth a new existence. Unfortunately, this process didn’t work and was cursed by the high heaven.

Such a lifeform had no chance of lasting long. Its bloodline disappeared from the river of time, only diluted versions remained. Nonetheless, if the offspring could somehow reach atavism, the pure version of the Human-monarch bloodline could emerge again.

The problem was that while tracing back to the source, the evil innate in this bloodline would show up again. It became even stranger and more malicious due to the high heaven’s curse.

“This bloodline must have come from the thirteen continents. It won’t appear in the nine worlds, right?” Sindragon asked.

“The ancient ming wasn’t created in the nine worlds either.” Li Qiye said.

This caused Sindragon to ponder how the ancient ming managed to enter the nine worlds. Perhaps no one had an answer to this mystery.

“Sacred Teacher, how should we proceed?” Thousand-hand asked.

Li Qiye stared at the monster and said: “We’re here just in time.”

Having said that, he took one step into the endless expanse. The monster might have looked as if it was in front of them but in reality, it was still incalculably far away.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The hole created by Li Qiye earlier was still blocked by a crystal wall, unbreakable by emperors and dao lords. However, it instantly crumbled before his step, granting him entry.

This expanse stretched infinitely, requiring a long period of travel. However, Li Qiye simply stepped through the dimensions and barriers to make it to the destination.

“Raa!” The monster felt his arrival and roared in response, activating the power of its bloodline.

Titanic waves swept through the stars, crushing one after another.

“Boom!” The four mouths spewed out more blood - a scene resembling a dam being broken through by a flood.

This empowered the gigantic frame of the monster, causing it to grow larger. The stagnation caused by Skyshroud Emperor ceased and the thing awakened.

She could no longer stop the growth despite mustering all of her dao power.

“Leave.” Li Qiye commanded.

She didn’t think twice and immediately retreated from the monster.

“Boom!” With her suppression gone, its body grew to the size of a small planet in no time at all.

Things squirmed and wiggled inside, causing sacs to form on the surface. The sacs started cracking like chicken eggs next in a dreadful manner.

Things started peeking out of the cracks, resembling tiny tentacles or black threads. Due to the countless sacs on the monster, did this mean that there were just as many evil creatures within?

Sindragon and Thousand-hand had goosebumps and felt nauseous at this sight despite their rich experiences.

The monster sensed danger due to Li Qiye. Blinding red beams shot in all directions, capable of sealing the entire world. 

They prevented anyone from getting closer but unfortunately, they were dealing with Li Qiye.

He raised his hand and summoned light from the primordial dao source. He formed it into the shape of a divine spear with enough power to start a new epoch.

“Raa!” The monster sensed this and directed its beams in the direction of Li Qiye, taking the initiative.

Alas, this couldn’t make him bat an eye since this wouldn’t affect him in the slightest. He threw the spear, piercing through time and space.

Nothing could run from this attack because it could thrust through three thousand worlds.

Sindragon and Thousand-hand felt their soul leaving their body while watching the spear fly. Although they weren’t the targets, they felt as if they had been pinned to the ground, unable to resist.

Merit laws and defensive barriers were useless. The fastest movement techniques couldn’t avoid this either. One could travel through dimensions and the result would still be the same.

The spear of light obliterated all the red beams along the way.

“Raa!” The monster couldn’t hide either, instantly being pinned to space itself. Its colossal body was left hanging in the void and left observers in awe.

Li Qiye didn’t kill it yet so it howled and roared, struggling to break free from the primordial spear to no avail.
