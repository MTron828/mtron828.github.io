Chapter 4458: The Legend

“Hmm, not bad. Looks like he knows how to educate his descendants.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Sir, we have benefited from your benevolence.” The creature said: “We wouldn’t be able to see the sun without your help.”

“I had nothing to do with it. Your old man toiled for it while risking his life.” Li Qiye responded.

“The ancestor has never forgotten your deed.” The creature continued.

“Hmm, looks like he has benefited greatly in order to still live in this epoch. Truly a miracle.” Li Qiye sentimentally said.

“Yes, the ancestor said that when you opened the world and created a new dao method, he had a great harvest. This is the same for us as well.” The creature elaborated.

“It was just an even exchange.” Li Qiye didn’t take credit but this didn’t diminish the creature’s reverence towards him.

In reality, this creature could be considered a supreme in Eight Desolaces. Nonetheless, it assumed the role of a junior because this was indeed the case. Li Qiye was a special existence.

Moreover, their ancestor had stressed this time and time again - to never cross Li Qiye. It didn’t know the details of the deal between its ancestor and Li Qiye. This was an epoch-level transaction beyond the reach of the descendants.

Nonetheless, it had a pretty good guess considering historical events, hence its wholehearted respect.

“Sir, would you like to visit our abode? The ancestor will be ecstatic to see you.” It invited Li Qiye.

“No. There’s no need to bother the old man and make him climb out. When I actually need something, I’ll let him know then.” Li Qiye said.

“Rest assured, Sir, we will do anything you ask of us.” The creature said.

“Ancient” was not enough to describe their lineage. They had enough strength to shake all of Eight Desolaces.

However, they remained reclusive and rarely interfered with the outside world. Alas, they would participate once more if Li Qiye so desired.

“I appreciate his enthusiasm.” Li Qiye accepted the sentiment. He then stared deeper into the region and murmured: “Years went by so quickly yet he is still alive. It must have been difficult.”

“The ancestor once drank a special medicine.” The creature revealed to Li Qiye a well-guarded secret. Few in their lineage knew about it but it still told Li Qiye.

“He said that due to your involvement, the circumstances became right for the medicine to form. Otherwise, he would have been dead long ago.” It continued.

“He’s quite lucky. The perfect circumstances still aren’t enough for some medicines since the villainous heaven might not permit.” Li Qiye smiled.

The medicine in this case was forbidden. Finishing it meant facing a heavenly tribulation. Thus, even the old man didn’t dare to do so. However, the circumstances became perfect with the great calamity, hence his success.

“It was due to your help, Sir.” The creature said. It didn’t know the alchemy process but the ancestor had asked Li Qiye for help before.

Li Qiye chuckled and shifted his focus elsewhere. His eyes became bright as he scanned all of Inner Ruins. He then commented: “This desolate land contains countless heavenly essences.”

“Yes.” The creature smiled wryly: “I still don’t have a full grasp of its actual size. We’re not the only lineage here either.”

“They haven’t died completely and decided to hide here.” Li Qiye understood.

“I’ve heard that there are lineages even older than us. During the great calamity, some got lucky and obtained some ancient sources…” It said.

“To put it bluntly, they got some corpses and get to live a bit longer, it’s nothing worthy of pride.” Li Qiye said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You’re right, Sir.” It didn’t dare to look down on the other lineages, unlike Li Qiye: “We only occupy one corner of Inner Ruins.”

“It’s fine, your old man likes to play it safe. This is the right way, know when to push and when to back off. Those who aren’t smart enough will face my wrath.” Li Qiye casually said.

The creature became startled since it understood the implication. There were other lineages just as strong as theirs right now in Inner Ruins. Their great ancestor might not be able to sweep through Inner Ruins.

However, Li Qiye made it sound so easy. Others might attribute this to arrogance and ignorance. Of course, it knew better than to underestimate Li Qiye.

This character might be the most terrifying and strongest being in Eight Desolaces right now. He could actually flatten Inner Ruins.

“You are invincible, Sir.” It sincerely said. Though it seemed to be at the top of the food chain, it knew that they haven’t come close to reaching Li Qiye’s level.

“Let’s not dwell on this issue. I’m here for one thing.” Li Qiye changed the topic.

“The thing from back then.” It finally understood Li Qiye’s goal.

“Yes, your old man knows.” Li Qiye smiled.

The creature politely said: “I heard about this from the ancestor before but nothing specific. We don’t dare to inquire without permission and have been waiting for you.”

In reality, they all coveted this item - something peerless enough to tempt the eternal existences. Their branch had ample information about it but they didn’t dare to push the issue.

First, they didn’t know whether they could obtain it or not. Second, and most importantly, the thing already had an owner. Sharing was not an option - their ancestor had warned.
