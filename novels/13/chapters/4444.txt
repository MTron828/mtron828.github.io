Li Qiye jumped into the created hole on the barrier. The demon had no choice but to follow him as well. After they were inside, the hole in the barrier disappeared.

When the demon god fell to the ground, he felt a harmonization experience with the dao. His pores started relaxing.

He looked around and saw immortal energy everywhere. This seemed like a paradise meant for immortals. He felt himself ascending by just being here.

“Is this immortal energy?” He carefully sensed this energy, realizing that it was completely different from chaos true energy or any other form of worldly energy.

He had even entered a forbidden zone before - Evil Flame Ridge. However, this was still a unique atmosphere.

It was so pure and magical, akin to one existing at the start of the world. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call this an immortal energy.

Of course, he wouldn’t know what that felt like. This was mere speculation.

“Primordial dao essence.” Li Qiye casually said.

“Primordial dao essence.” The demon wasn’t familiar with this title at all. Nonetheless, just the name alone was rather moving.

He then looked around and noticed that they were inside a valley. It looked rather simple with random pebbles and a small pond in the middle. It has been there for who knows how many years and was filled with water.

There were random green grass as well, rather sparse in number. They were overgrown because no one has come to disturb them.

There were only three leaves on each grass; they had a pentagonal shape. All the parts had a green jade color and looked shiny, brimming with water.

“This is the place? Hmm, there is a chance of immortality here?” He murmured.

This was obviously their final destination. Alas, nothing too peculiar seemed to be here just yet - no shocking artifacts, pulsing treasures, profound dao…

If it wasn’t for his pleasant state, he would question that they were in the wrong place. However, he knew that this was it.

They had been through so much to get here. The other dao lords must have wanted to come here as well. Who knows if they had made it?

He speculated that this place was the reason why Feng Qi and Jiu Bian fought to the death. He wasn’t a fool and activated his heavenly gaze to check out all the details here.

The first thing that drew him in was the small pond. He walked forward and saw something peculiar about the clear water.

It appeared resplendent and measureless, seemingly made from all of the water in the world compressed into a single pond. Moreover, there was no trace of impurity. This could be the purest water in the world.

“This is?” The demon had seen plenty of magical water before but nothing like this.

He bent down and placed one hand into the water. Suddenly, dao laws and hymns appeared around him.

His hand became ethereal, seemingly on the verge of breaking down into laws and runes. His own grand dao and totems were automatically activated. He felt himself transforming into an immortal.

This was only because he touched the water; he didn’t channel his power in the slightest.

“What the hell?!” He became frightened and pulled his hand back.

The water wasn’t dangerous, it was simply magical beyond imagination. He was afraid that if this continued, he could lose control of his own grand dao.

“This water is peerless.” His heart beat faster. If he could bring it outside to slowly absorb or comprehend it, he would be able to break through to the next level.

He took out a treasure gourd in order to take some water. However, it wouldn’t pour into his open gourd regardless of his repeated attempt. It was akin to the reflection of the moon in the water - beautiful but not actually tangible.

“Sir, what is this water?” He asked for help.

Li Qiye glanced at the pond and said: “Pinnacle Lifewater.”

“Pinnacle-?” The demon became startled: “The water in the legends?!”

He had heard rumors about it before. The sources and the details remained unknown. He never expected to see it in his lifetime. Unfortunately, he couldn’t take a single drop with him.

“If you don’t want to return empty-handed, take one grass with you.” Li Qiye glanced at the vegetation and said.

He calmed down and knew that Li Qiye was helping him. He rushed over and activated his heavenly gaze. He saw that this particular tall grass has three leaves. It brimmed with aquatic energy as if each of them was an ocean filled with life.

“This must be the Three-leaves Life-ferry Grass?” He said with uncertainty.

“Looks like your title as a demon god is well-deserved. At least you know about it.” Li Qiye joked.

“I see, one leaf can ferry nine lives…” He became emotional because he knew about this legendary grass as well.

Each grass could be considered an immortal medicine. Just one was enough to start a war but there must be more than a hundred blades in this valley.

“Sir, should I?” He bowed.

“Yes, but don’t be greedy or it’ll be the reason for your death.” Li Qiye replied.

He understood this logic - it was best not to incite others’ greed. He bowed at the grass before taking out a jeweled bowl. He carefully took down three leaves and stopped there. Taking too much would only cause trouble later on if others were to find out.
