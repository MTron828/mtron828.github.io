“Thank you, Young Noble.” The auctioneer bowed again despite his comment.

The seven old men closed the box fully and bowed before quietly leaving. They didn’t utter a single word from start to finish as if they were mute. Nevertheless, their status at Arrogance was still special.

“What a shame, we should have taken something that good.” The bull shook its head and complained.

The auctioneer ignored this comment completely.

“Okay, the transaction is complete, time to leave.” Li Qiye laughed and said.

“Young Noble, the elders told me to inform you that Arrogance Enterprise is ready to support you, just let us know if you ever need anything.” The auctioneer said.

“Looks like you have a high position in the enterprise.” Li Qiye looked at her and said.

“My name is A Lan and my accomplishments are mediocre at best.” She replied: “I will jump into a boiling cauldron if you command me so.”

“Sounds good, where is your young lord?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Well... he’s not here right now.” Her expression changed for a bit. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Not here or not want to see me?” Li Qiye chuckled.

The girl became slightly awkward but he stopped pursuing.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye put away the treasures and left.

She followed him all the way out to the door before stopping.

The group returned to Bai Jinning’s place. It wasn’t small but another person on top of the bull made it a little crowded.

Li Qiye took out Stone Orchid Scripture and said: “Charcoal says a lot of stupid things but not all the time. Your ancestor is indeed fated to be with Buddhism, the same with your bloodline. There is no dao system in the wildlands so this scripture is suitable for someone connected to this doctrine like you. Maybe you can have great achievements with it one day.”

“Fo-for me?” Jinning became startled since this scripture was bought for an insane price.

Even Brightking Buddha wanted it but eventually lost to Li Qiye.

“I’ve already memorized it, it’s nothing more than a book to me now.” Li Qiye tossed it in her direction.

She held the scripture, frozen.

“Clank.” Li Qiye unsheathed the ancestral sword bought earlier.

The energy and aura of Sword Saint remained, causing her to tremble with fear.

“Take it.” He put it back into the sheathe and tossed it towards her too.

“I...” She was at a loss for words.

The saint childs and royal lords weren’t lucky enough to have something like this, let alone a little soldier like her.

“I-I can’t accept it.” Her hands trembled, not because of the weight of the sword but rather its value. She never dared to even dream about something like this.

“Take it, the sword is not bad but I can’t use it since it’ll break after a few swings. The materials aren’t good enough.” Li Qiye said flatly.

This nonchalant line might be the most stirring thing she has ever heard. She would never forget it her whole life.

“My life is yours, Young Noble. You may take it any time!” She got on her knees and kowtowed hard. Li Qiye just gave her a new life with these gifts.

He accepted the grand gesture before turning over at the stonecarver girl who didn’t dare to look at him.

He sighed and took out her official document - the seal imprisoning her.

“Poof!” He burned it to ashes.

“You can go now.” He blew the ashes away and said.

The girl finally looked up and stared at him in astonishment. She had already accepted her fate back at the auction, ready for the worst. Thus, she couldn’t react in time.

“You’re free.” Jinning saw this and said: “The young noble has released you from servitude. You can go wherever you want now.”

She saw slave trades everywhere in the wildlands. Those lucky enough to have a good master would be able to live on.

As for the unfortunate ones? Potentially a fate worse than death, simply too sad to watch.

In Jinning’s opinion, this girl was lucky to meet a merciful master like Li Qiye. He still released her despite paying so much earlier.

This was a kindness on the same level as the birth given by her parents.

The girl still didn’t know what to do while staring at Li Qiye, almost like a lost little bird.

“Thank the young noble then go back home.” Jinning kindly reminded her.

“I... I don’t know where home is.” The girl calmed down and shook her head. Her eyes became moist.

Her soft voice could make people go weak. Moreover, her exotic look was extremely attractive as well.

“Where is your family?” Jinning asked.

“I don’t have any, my parents aren’t around anymore...” The girl said.

The two of them chatted for a bit and Jinning understood her current situation.

It turned out that this girl lived deep in the mountains, completely separated from the outside world.

This was understandable. Her race was on the verge of extinction. She would have been kidnapped the moment they found out about her bloodline.

She lived with her parents until the two of them passed away, leaving her by herself.

She then became curious about the outside world. Alas, she got captured right away the moment she made it out.

Jinning sympathized with her. Stories like hers happened all the time in the wildlands.

“Stonecarvers, this race used to be mighty and reigned during their golden age.” The bull became emotional too.

“What’s your name?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yanbai, Liu Yanbai.” She seemed bashful when talking to Li Qiye.

Li Qiye stared at her before turning his gaze towards the bull; his lips curled into a smirk.

“Sir, your smile is weird...” The bull felt a chill.

“From now on, you are responsible for this girl. She is very talented.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Shit, no, I don’t want to carry a burden around!” The bull immediately wanted to run.

“That’s fine with me. Bring her to Sacred Mountain and tell the old demon that I want him to teach her. I’m sure he’ll be able to groom an ultimate disciple, he’s a better teacher than you anyway.”

“Bah! That old demon’s building dao isn’t bad, but as for teaching? Not necessarily, I’m the greatest bull in existence. My cultivation method is unmatched in history. His light art is not worth mentioning, hmph.” The bull retorted: “You can go ask him about our cultivation art. It has been passed down since the ancient era. The guy was so impressed after seeing it...” [1]

“Well, you can teach her this unmatched method then.” Li Qiye interrupted it.

“That’s, that’s not what I meant.” It realized what Li Qiye was trying to do.

“Say no more, it is decided.” Li Qiye commanded.

“Goddamn it, you’re playing with me, right?!” The bull nearly vomited blood from anger and protested.
