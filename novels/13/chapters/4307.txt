Chapter 4308: A Trick?

“Indeed, this is fate.” One disciple happily said.

They didn’t mind at all. The guy sounded like he wanted to join their sect, hence all the mentioning of “bonds” and “friendship”.

After all, the sect didn’t have strict requirements for new recruits. Just this treasure alone was enough to let Zining become an elder’s disciple.

“Sigh…” Zining continued touching the box, seeming reluctant.

“Your heirloom isn’t of much use in your possession.” A disciple stared at the box, eager to finish the transaction.

“You’re right, let’s do this.” Zining made up his mind and opened the box.

“Buzz.” The same radiance appeared again along with the runes and the beautiful roars.

The individual ray stopped people from seeing it. Even Elder Hu could only see a faint figure - something resembling a heart.

“The heart of a divine beast? Or a special dao bone?” He became emotional.

As for the disciples, their eyes became wide open with excitement, wanting nothing more than to embrace this treasure. They had never seen anything like this before.

“Is this really a treasure?” Wang Weiqiao murmured. He still found the whole thing quite strange, thinking that there was something off about it.

Was it Wang ZIning or the treasure? Or everything including the boss of this store? No, even the street was off. Intuition told him that this all happened the moment they set foot in the city.

Of course, he wasn’t in a position to stop his peers from buying this treasure. These were mere conjectures and he had no proof.

The disciples from Little Diamond raised their hands, wanting to finish the deal.

“Where’s my money?” Zining asked.

“It’s right here, do you want to count?” The senior wanted to pay as fast as possible before the guy change his mind.

“What’s the hurry?” Li Qiye finally spoke and all eyes turned on him.

“Keep the money, the deal is off.” Li Qiye ordered.

The disciples couldn’t believe it. They wasted so much saliva convincing Zining to sell. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

“Se-sect Master, this is a great treasure, it’s a rare chance.” One disciple winked repeatedly at Li Qiye, telling him not to ruin the deal.

“It’s not worth anything, don’t buy.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What…” The disciples disagreed with Li Qiye’s assessment.

“Sect Master, this has to be a valuable treasure.” One of them didn’t give up but Li Qiye seemed hellbent on canceling this transaction.

Though unwilling, they still listened to their sect master and took back the money.

“You don’t want it anymore? What’s going on?” Zining looked confused while holding the treasure.

“As for you, a little interesting. Quite audacious as well.” Li Qiye then spoke to him directly.

“What do you mean, Sir?” Zining scratched his head, looking like an inexperienced and naive young master.

“What do you think about me?” Li Qiye suddenly asked.

“Sir, you have an exceptional appearance, definitely a true dragon among men or even a true immortal.” Zining stared at Li Qiye and said.

“Are you being honest now?” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed.

Though the young ones didn’t notice anything, Zining felt himself being pierced by Li Qiye’s gaze.

He took a deep breath to calm down before speaking in a serious tone: “Sir, you are matchless indeed.”

“Not so clever now, are you?” The boss of the restaurant standing to the side sneered.

Zining ignored the comment, still looking quite calm.

“Take this piece of crap away. You might be able to fool the children but doing this in front of me is rather unwise.” Li Qiye said.

Zining had thick skin and put his treasure away, albeit with a wry smile.

The disciples scratched their head in confusion. By this point, they realized that there was something off but were still uncertain.

As for Wang Weiqiao, he thought that this treasure was fake, just not the exact details. Only his master noticed from the very beginning.

“You said something about a bond of friendship?” Li Qiye asked.

“Zining wishes to have a bond with you, Sir.” He bowed towards Li Qiye.

“No need for that, just speak.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“What do you mean, Sir?” He didn’t expect this response.

“What is your goal? Just to have a good relationship with us?” Li Qiye smiled.

He pondered for a bit before replying: “Not quite, I wish to attribute the goodwill of this meeting to my sect.”

“Mmm. So be it, this karmic knot has been tied. Give it to them.” Li Qiye agreed then pointed at the young disciples.

“I will obey, Sir.” He bowed deeply.

Li Qiye then took out a bronze coin. This coin was completely worthless in the eyes of cultivators. In fact, it could only buy a meat bun at best in the mortal world. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He flicked and it landed on Zining’s table.

“This coin will be the payment for your box. The bond is forged.” Li Qiye said.

“The box?” The disciples were astounded. Li Qiye didn’t want the radiant treasure but this old box?

Was this a real-life case of buying the box but returning the pearls? This box was clearly less valuable than the treasure earlier.

Of course, Li Qiye was still getting a good deal because the box should be special given its old age. One bronze coin for it was as cheap as can be.

“Your insight is incredible, Sir.” Zining finished his scouting attempt and confirmed Li Qiye’s ability.

“A bond is forged, Sirs.” Zining slowly pushed the box across the table towards the young ones.
