Chapter 5144: Not Drinking Tea Today

Li Qiye and Jun Landu were presented with the best tea available from Windchaser Hall.

“I’ve been drinking too much tea recently.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“We can change to something else then, Young Noble.” Windchaser Conqueror smiled.

“Splash!” He raised his hand and a golden lotus was carried over by a stream of water. It exuded golden rays and mysterious mist.

A crane flew over with a fruit in its beak. It added some strength and the fruit juice streamed into the golden lotus. Not a single drop was wasted in this process.

Next, the golden lotus automatically flew toward the two. The liquid inside was splendid and magnificent with an alluring scent. Smelling it alone gave a feeling of ascension.

“A specialty only found in Windchaser, the dew of the crane, even more delicious when used with the lotus growing in this pond.” Windchaser introduced: “Please, Young Noble, Lord Landu.”

“You’re lucky because the young noble is here today.” Jun Landu smiled and drank from the lotus first.

“I’ll prepare three more then.” Windchaser laughed.

In reality, Landu had tried his best to live in his courtyard alone. Windchaser had tried so hard to become closer to no avail. Even when he was a conqueror, he couldn’t successfully invite Landu to his sect. His numerous traps and plots were easily ignored.

Others would find this silly? Why would someone refuse the friendship of a conqueror? Of course, Landu was a special existence.

The saint child was smart enough to know that he was in the audience of great cultivators. Thus, he served them like an attentive waiter.

“You have a good thing going on with Harkrain.” Landu was more talkative since Li Qiye was around.

“Will you come and give a toast? I don’t care for worldly traditions but it’s a different matter if you are around.” Windchaser smiled and took advantage of this opportunity: “Will you come for a drink too, Young Noble?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Don’t be so greedy now.” Landu smiled and said: “If Sir comes to your wedding, then it is all but settled. I do think that we’ll have free time then though.”

Nonetheless, he tried to drag Li Qiye in. Though he didn’t wish to have karmic ties with the mortal world, he had a special relationship with Windchaser Conqueror. After all, he watched the kid grow up and this was his time to help.

“Young Noble, will we have the honor of your presence?” Windchaser bowed and asked Li Qiye.

“Traditions are rather troublesome but I suppose that this union is something worth celebrating.” Li Qiye understood what they were trying to do but he did like Windchaser Conqueror.

“Did you hear that? It is time for your relationship with Harkrain to blossom.” Landu laughed.

“Thank you for your support, I will talk to Harkrain about this.” Windchaser couldn’t hide his excitement.

The saint child was just as excited since this was great news for their sect as well.

“The two of you might be willing but this is a rocky road.” Landu said: “It would have been easier before but times are changing. You have to take the initiative.”

“I understand.” Windchaser nodded: “Both sides won’t like it.”

“It’s one thing if you two are regular cultivators, then you can just leave and go anywhere in this vast world. On the other hand, conquerors don’t have the same freedom.”

Harkrain Conqueror was Windchaser’s dao companion, lover, and future wife. Alas, they haven’t announced their relationship yet.

Li Qiye had seen her before back at the noodle shop. The lovers both had four dao fruits.

Normally, it would be a joyful occasion for conquerors to marry each other. After all, most only focused on cultivation and didn’t care about romance.

In this case, they fell in love when they were younger and continued together after becoming conquerors.

The issue was their background. Windchaser was from Peace Village while Harkrain came from Heaven Alliance.

“Which side are you picking after marriage?” Jun Landu smiled and said.

“We do not wish to be involved in this conflict.” Windchaser said: “We only want to be together.”

At this point, the saint child told the others to leave. He left as well since this was no longer a suitable conversation for them to listen to.

“A predicament indeed.” Landu said: “But not anymore since we won’t be eating your fish for nothing, right?”

“You fished it, not me.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, but you have agreed to help them out, Sir.” Landu said before turning to Windchaser: “Rest assured that Dao and Imperial Alliance won’t interfere with this matter since we’ll talk to them about it.”

“I truly appreciate it, Young Noble, Lord Landu.” Windchaser understood the reason why his pond was specifically chosen by Landu.

“It’s harder for the other side. Do you want her to stay here or are you going to Heaven Alliance?” Landu asked.

“Neither, we will walk our own path.” Windchaser said.

“A while ago, I would have not come here to fish.” Landu said: “But now, Principle Conqueror has abdicated.”

“So I heard.” Windchaser said with a serious expression.

“Although you won’t have any problem from your side, what about her side?” Landu stated the obvious.

“Supreme will interfere.” Windchaser said: “Divine Alliance will also be more aggressive than before without Principle Conqueror. They will want to be closer to Heaven Alliance.”

“Reverting to an old tradition that has been ongoing since the day of their progenitor, Profound Emperor. It’s just that Principle was amazing enough to stabilize the situation.”

Heaven and Divine were virtually one family. Its progenitor, Profound Emperor, didn’t explicitly state that they needed to side with Celestial Court but it just happened that way due to the circumstances.
