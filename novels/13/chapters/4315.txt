Chapter 4316: Myriad Sect Ward

In the past, the ward took care of important cultivators from all over Eight Desolaces. This time around, it had guests from minor sects such as Little Diamond.

The disciples from the big sects weren’t that enthusiastic about the guests this time around. In fact, it would be polite enough for them to try to hide their disdain.

Because of this, the visitors needed to register and wait in line. Nonetheless, it wasn’t for nothing since the behemoths also gave out items and resources despite the short length of the conference. This was another reason why many participated.

Little Diamond’s group came rather early but there was still quite a line in front of them. Nonetheless, Elder Hu knew what to do and led the disciples to the correct places.

“Why are we assigned to the grass section?” However, there was a problem when it came to their temporary residence. Even the friendly Elder Hu complained to the disciples.

“That’s the only place left.” An administrative disciple uttered coldly.

Even external disciples from the behemoths were considered prestigious. Thus, they didn’t need to give Elder Hu any face.

“No yellow rooms are left?” Elder Hu didn’t buy it. He looked back and saw there was still a long line behind them.

The conference has always paid attention to detail. The more power, the better the treatment. For example, the lodgings were divided into five levels: heaven, earth, black, yellow, and grass.

Elder Hu had participated before and knew that according to the rules, they should be eligible to stay in yellow rooms. The grass rooms were meant for vagabonds and sectless cultivators.

Though they were weak, they were still a sect thus this was the wrong accommodation. Moreover, they weren’t late either so there should be plenty of rooms left.

“There are really no yellow rooms left?” The sects waiting in line behind him had members asking as well.

The grass rooms were tiny and meant for single occupants. On the other hand, the minor sects usually had a dozen members or so.

The administrative disciple didn’t answer and only sat there.

“Brother, could you check again?” Elder Hu realized that something was off and said: “We have more than ten members and can’t stay in a grass room. Please, do us a favor.” He bowed afterward.

Despite realizing the intentional insult, he couldn’t act out either. Insulting this administrative disciple might result in being kicked out.

“There are five grass rooms, either stay or leave.” The disciple flatly answered.

“Only five?” The elder’s expression soured. They couldn’t fit in five rooms and they couldn’t erect temporary buildings in this place. He hesitated, not knowing what to do.

“Brother, what’s going on? Is there a problem?” Loud laughter could be heard from someone heading over.

Elder Hu and the disciples looked around and saw that it was none other than the sect master of Eight Demons along with his fellow sect members.

“Looks like you have to stay in the grass rooms. Too bad, you must have arrived late and there isn’t any room left. Is this your new sect master? How about this, your sect master can stay with us, we still have room.” Eight Tiger tried to look generous and familiar, going as far as wanting to place his hand on Li Qiye’s shoulder.

Alas, Li Qiye glared at him so he pulled back awkwardly.

Elder Hu understood that this was the continuation of their feud. Eight Tiger lost half of his members but didn’t dare to retaliate due to the massacre last time. The conference was their chance to fight back while not assuming high risks. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Eight Tiger’s brother-in-law was Deer King from Dragon Sect. Perhaps the latter was here right now and had ordered the administrative members to cause problems for Little Diamond.

If Little Diamond couldn’t endure and bark back, that might give Deer King enough justification to eliminate them.

Given his power, it wouldn’t be hard for him to eradicate Elder Hu and the others since they were away from their sect.

“Okay, stop being a hindrance, there are people waiting behind you.” The administrative disciple became impatient and told Elder Hu, no longer caring about his decision.

“We’ll be going ahead.” Gao Qixin led his fellow sect members here and said.

“Junior Brother Gao, you can stay in the black rooms.” The administrative disciple’s mood changed and said: “Deer King said that if you need anything, just let us know. An elder from Dragon might come in the next two days.”

“An elder from Dragon?” Those from smaller sects clamored upon hearing this.

Elders were big shots in their eyes, no different from deities. Any elder could easily destroy them with a single hand wave.

Thus, it was surprising to hear one coming to the conference. Was there something important happening this time?

“Gao Qixin wants to follow an elder’s tutelage?” Someone boldly speculated.

Becoming an elder’s disciple was akin to a carp turning into a dragon.

“He has even more potential than Deer King.” Someone else said. After all, Deer King wasn’t qualified to become an elder’s disciple back then.

Elder Hu, on the other hand, confirmed that Deer King was here. The guy wasn’t a grand character in Dragon but still proved to be a big threat to them.

“Let him know that I appreciate it.” Gao Qixin bowed and looked rather calm.

“His future is so bright.” Many were jealous and envious since Qixin was assigned to a black room. Some found it imperative to please him in order to climb up his branch.

Remember, Maple Ravine wasn’t stronger than the minor sects here but they only got assigned to yellow rooms while the former had a black room. This showed how much Deer King care about Gao Qixin.

“Enter the yellow section.” Once Gao Qixin left, the smaller sects were assigned to yellow rooms.

Meanwhile, Elder Hu felt humiliated by the blatant disdain. As for Li Qiye, he still had a smile on his face and didn’t bother interfering.
