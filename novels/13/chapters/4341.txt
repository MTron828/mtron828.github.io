Chapter 4342: Greed Is Innate

“Hand over the treasures!” A cultivator loudly demanded.

Countless eyes - red from greed and desires - were fixated on Li Qiye. Many were willing to cut Li Qiye to pieces in order to take the treasures.

“Hand over them right now if you want to stay alive!” A disciple from a large sect shouted.

A clan member kept it less aggressive and said: “This treasure belongs to no one alone. Monopolize it and risk the wrath of the world.”

“You’re not leaving this place with it.” An expert raised his saber at Li Qiye.

The treasures were obviously precious. Thus, no one wanted to let them go.

“I see. Who should I hand it to then?” Li Qiye smiled at the crowd.

This caught them off guard. They exchanged glances and didn’t want to relent. Who would Li Qiye hand it to? This didn’t matter because a skirmish would break out right after.

“Give it to me!” The young lord of Flow insisted: “I will guarantee your safe departure.”

“Young Lord, don’t be so sure, you can’t represent everyone. In terms of seniority and status, you wouldn’t be next in line.” The golden daughter said.

“As if you’re next in line.” The young lord barked back.

“Fine, we need to come up with a decision.” She mused and said.

Both understood that no one right now could monopolize the treasures. The first to seize it from Li Qiye would risk being attacked from all sides.

Thus, she thought about teaming up with Flow. Two great powers working together would greatly increase their chance.

“Give it to me! We, Grand Metropolis, will leave you alone.” One expert lost his patience.

“Why should your sect get it? Treasures belong to the virtuous!” Another member of a great power shouted back.

“Yes, treasures belong to the virtuous, hand it over!” The crowd became rowdier.

“Brat, don’t let your life end in this silly manner, just give it up! It belongs to the virtuous!” Some tried to make it not look like a robbery.

“So who among you is the virtuous?” Li Qiye scanned the crowd.

“Give it to us for now, we’ll definitely find the right master for it.” A disciple from a small sect suggested.

“I’m the virtuous, give it to me now!” A thick-skinned expert roared.

“Pah, have you taken a look at yourself in the mirror, shameless brute?!” Someone nearby scowled.

All in all, the crowd wouldn’t stop yelling and demanding Li Qiye to give it to them.

“Enough, silence!” A thunderous shout interrupted them successfully.

They saw Crystal Dragon Young Lord approaching closer. His status and power were enough to be the top dog here.

The ones surrounding Li Qiye made way for him to come before Li Qiye.

“Be smart and hand the treasures over.” The young lord raised his hand.

Li Qiye glanced at him and smiled: “You’ve disgraced your ancestors, the young lord of a sect acting like a bandit.”

“How dare you?!” His expression darkened as he shouted. A sound wave rushed forward but Li Qiye was unaffected.

“Masterless treasures due indeed belong to the virtuous, don’t think about leaving with them.” He uttered coldly.

“Are you claiming to be virtuous?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Whether I’m virtuous or otherwise cannot be assessed by a worm like you. Hand over the treasure, Dragon Sect will take care of it.” The young lord said.

The smaller sects didn’t say anything but the ones from the great powers weren’t happy at all.

“All of that talk and he still just wants to monopolize it.” A great power’s disciple muttered.

“He’s definitely not virtuous.” A clan member complained quietly.

Most certainly feared Dragon Sect and the young lord. However, the treasure was too tempting so they still wanted to give it a shot.

Only a few members of the last generation weren’t afraid of him since they were just as strong.

The problem here for them was that if Li Qiye were to hand over the treasure to the young lord, it would be exceedingly difficult to demand it from him.

“And if I don’t hand it over?” Li Qiye asked.

“Then let’s ask the crowd whether they’ll agree or not.” The young lord uttered coldly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The eyes staring at Li Qiye resembled those of ravenous wolves. They all believed that they were the chosen ones and that the treasures were meant for them.

“Don’t be an idiot now.” A clan elder’s eyes gleamed with murderous intent.

“Monopolizing it will result in death.” An expert added.

“That’s right, don’t think about keeping it to yourself!” Others started shouting, wanting to finish this as fast as possible.

“Young Lord, if you believe that the virtuous deserve the treasures, then who else but Sir Li is worthy? He was the first to make contact, meaning that they have chosen him.” The heir of Chi Jinlin finally showed up.

Jian Qingzhu was next to him but didn’t want to be involved in this matter. As for Jinlin, he didn’t come closer in order to express his intention of not wanting the treasures.

No one else retorted so far in order to give him some face.

Only the young lord of Dragon spoke up: “Your Highness, how do you know that he’s the chosen one? He only got lucky to be here first and was the closest to the treasures. The virtuous are special and can’t be any random cultivator.”
