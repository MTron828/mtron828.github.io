Chapter 5044: What Was Left Behind?T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The group was finally brought to one particular wooden house. It looked simple yet mysterious, seemingly one with the tree itself so it was rather hard to spot.

“This is the house left by our founder god, we have been paying our respect from the outside for generations now.” Nightwalker didn’t enter and told Li Qiye.

Li Qiye stared at it and let out a sigh.

“Wait for me out here.” He said before opening the door, entering, and closing it.

The group exchanged glances after seeing this. Ming Shi innocently commented: “Why is the young noble interested in this little house?”

She had followed him for a while and rarely saw him interested in anything.

“There’s a reason, I’m sure.” Yunyun said because at the very start, Li Qiye became interested after seeing Shadowrider in action. In fact, this took more of his time than the matter of the missing cultivators.

“Why are you just standing there?” Ming Shi then turned her attention to Goldcrest.

He smiled wryly and said: “I’m just thinking about how strange the six deity branches are.”

“What do you mean?” She asked.

“I’m not sure, they’re just different from the other lineages.” He shook his head.

Demon might be one of the twelve lineages but it seemed so different than the rest, especially in terms of scale.

“If you want to know the answer, you must enter the divine nest. I’m sure all of your questions shall be answered there.” Nightwalker told him.

“You’ve been there before?” Ming Shi acted familiar and asked.

“Only the luckiest beings and founder gods. As for commanding gods across the eras, Vine God is the most likely one to have entered.” Nightwalker shook his head in response.

“Vine God…” Goldcrest murmured the title of the oldest commanding god.

The oldest branch was Serpent but the oldest commanding god was Vine who has been in charge after Demon Conqueror created Wood.

“Are there any known methods for attempting to enter?” Yunyun asked.

“First is just luck, as I’ve said. The probability is pitifully low and few had done so in history. Second is to possess a complete god source but it is not a guarantee. The probability is still low.” Nightwalker replied..

“So mysterious and elusive, I wonder what’s in there.” Ming Shi said.

Nightwalker only smiled.

“As far as I know, it is the origin of our dao.” Goldcrest said while staring at Nightwalker.

“I don’t know.” Nightwalker shook his head: “There is one person who does though.”

“Who is it?” Ming Shi asked.

“Demon Conqueror who came from the divine nest.” Nightwalker said.

Goldcrest shuddered after hearing this. There were rumors of the conqueror entering there, but that’s an entirely different issue than actually being from there.

“You and that assassin, no, your dao avatar, are so different.” Ming Shi said.

Nightwalker was amicable while Shadowrider brimmed with murderous intent on top of being stoic all the time.

“Because I am not an assassin, I am a commanding god.” Nightwalker replied.

“What is it like being an assassin?” She was curious but he didn’t respond.

The wooden house was empty - no bed or table, and not even a piece of hair could be found.

Li Qiye looked around and murmured: “For what, silly girl? Why in such a hurry?”

He knew the progenitor of this lineage but the motive eluded him. He slowly sat down in the meditative pose and closed his eyes.

His body became increasingly ethereal as it fused with the wooden house. This transformed the house into a dark world only seen by him.

Ultimately, this lineage and legacy were actually started by him. Though it had changed drastically over the years, the fundamentals remained.

After a long exploration, he opened his eyes and started drawing on the floor with his finger. His movement was as agile as a soaring dragon while following a mystical pattern. Once he was finished, the inscrutable traces disappeared completely.

“Buzz.” Bright dao runes appeared on the food next.

“Pop!” A sound similar to splashing water could be heard as something gradually emerged from the spell.

Li Qiye grabbed it and the room became normal again. He was surprised to see it - a wooden block.

This was actually a storage box but it was stuck together. There was no way to open it.

“Hmm, what happened to you?” He gently rubbed it and contemplated. She clearly left it here for him to find.

Something shocking must have happened, requiring this step from her.

“I’ll resolve it.” He said and put the box away.

***

The group has been waiting a long time before Li Qiye came out of the house.

“Did you find anything?” Ming Shi asked.

“I found what I needed to find.” He smiled before ordering Nightwalker: “The lineage is naturally important but it has lost its meaning. There is no need to continue and live in the darkness.”

“Young Noble, we will think about it.” Nightwalker bowed.

Li Qiye didn’t mind either way and said: “We’re leaving.”

After Nightwalker took them out of Mist, he glanced at Goldcrest and said: “If you can leave the ten mountains, do it.”

“What?” Goldcrest didn’t understand.
