Chapter 4053: Bladerain Young Noble

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

If the actual sect of Armament was the vantage point, then Armament City would be to the left and the Tang’s plain would be to the right.

They were strikingly different - desolate versus prosperous.

The city had verdant hills, beautiful peaks with waterfalls occupied by animals and birds. Buildings scattered on the rolling terrains, from the base to the peak.

Streets paved the peaks then bridges connected them together. From a distance, it looked rather lively and populated - a combination of a large city yet still maintaining a touch of nature. It truly put the plain of the Tang to shame.

It belonged to Armament Mountain, unlike the Tang’s plain. Its importance might be second only to the actual sect. In other words, it was part of the main branch while the plain played the part of a bastard.

Cultivators from all over the continent came here for business or just sightseeing. Humans and demons made up the majority of the diverse locals and visitors.

Why were there so many demons here? This was due to the second dao lord of Armament - God Ape Dao Lord.

He used to be an ape that gained enlightenment through the dao. He then joined Armament Mountain to learn more about cultivation.

After becoming a dao lord, he didn’t forget his roots and frequently had dao lectures for other demons. Random animals and vegetation were also enlightened by him and turned into demons.

During his generation, the demon population in Armament reached around fifty percent or so. This trend persisted to the present day, albeit not on the same level.

Li Qiye and Ning Zhu’s arrival in the city attracted ample attention. Of course, people paid attention to Ning Zhu.

Li Qiye’s ordinary appearance was inconspicuous. On the other hand, Ning Zhu was gorgeous but most importantly, her aura always made her stand out like a crane among a flock of chickens.

It was impossible for her to keep a low profile. After all, everyone enjoyed staring at beautiful things.

Some recognized her and came forward. Among them was a youth who was ecstatic to see her. He ran over and loudly greeted: “Your Highness!”

He wore a white robe that was tightly wrapped, revealing his powerful muscles. He was quite spirited, not in an arrogant and haughty manner but simply brimming with power like a wild leopard. An old-looking saber was hanging by his waist.

Its shine seemed to be a sign of love. Its master must have been diligent in polishing and keeping it clean. This saber user was full of youthful energy, akin to the rising sun at dawn.

His joy after seeing Ning Zhu was written on his face.

“It's been three years since our last meeting, Your Highness. It is an honor to see you again.” He said.

“Young Noble Liu, long time no see. Your cultivation has improved again.” She nodded.

“You’re too kind.” He couldn’t avert his eyes from her, looking completely infatuated. He tried his best to stay calm and praised her without holding back: “You’re still as pretty as a fairy, so unforgettable.”

“Thank you, Young Noble Liu.” She calmly answered while still following Li Qiye.

“Why are you here, Your Highness? Is it because of the commotion at the ancestral peak? I’ve heard that many experts have arrived because it has something to do with Sword Burial. It might appear near here in this generation…” He then looked around first - looking mysterious - and lowered his voice: “Many geniuses have come too, they want to be the first to get to the zone if it actually shows up.”

He wanted to divulge everything possible to her, wanting to both curry favor and show off his knowledge.

“Your Highness, are you here alone? If you’re interested in Sword Burial, how about we go together? Teaming up will make things easier since it’ll be very competitive. Everyone wants the divine sword.” He added.

“I appreciate your invitation.” She nodded politely and said: “But I am here on business with the young noble.” She then walked closer and stood behind Li Qiye.

The youth finally noticed Li Qiye after hearing this. In fact, ever since he got here, his eyes didn’t move an inch from Ning Zhu. Plus, even if he had seen Li Qiye, he wouldn’t have thought that these two were together.

“This gentleman is…” The youth found it surprising. Why was this junior accompanying the princess?

“This is Young Noble Li.” She introduced briefly: “Young Noble, he is one of the four Weapon Heroes, Bladerain Young Noble Liu Yushang.”

Li Qiye smiled and nodded at the youth.

The four Weapon Heroes were famous alongside the ten Sword Prodigies. They just used different weapons instead of swords.

Ten to four - this was another sign of the sword’s supremacy in this continent.

Liu Yushang was well-liked by the young generation, especially those from weaker sects or vagabonds. The latter viewed him as an idol.

The reason was very simple - he was one of the few geniuses with no background to speak of. For example, Princess Ning Zhu, Pendant Sword Lady, Starshooter Prince… They were all from prestigious clans and sects.

He came from a weak sect near Wooden Sword that no one had heard of before. People would only talk about him, not his sect.

However, he was gifted enough to learn a top saber art, enough to let him roam freely around the world. This was the reason why those with humble beginnings thought so highly of him.

Due to their locations, Liu Yushang had met the princess long ago. He fell in love at first sight, unable to control himself whenever they met.

“You’re that Li Qiye?” He immediately asked. Everyone knew about this legendary guy, the luckiest in the world. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“That’s my name.” Li Qiye smiled.

Yushang had no interest in Li Qiye. He stared at the princess and hesitated: “Your Highness…”

He had heard of the bet before but didn’t pay it any attention. How could a parvenu compare to the princess of Wooden Sword?
