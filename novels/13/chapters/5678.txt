Chapter 5679: Eat You

“Thus, you are wasting time here, I won’t play along with you.” The dark being uttered coldly.

“It seems like you are useless to me then, I must rethink the weapon. A Trinity Sword or a Chaos Hammer?” Li Qiye sat down next to the skeleton and said.

“Do as you please.” The being said.

“I won’t actually do it, you know? There are better choices for a paragon artifact than you. I’m better off using my time to take control of Celestial Court, a heavenly treasure far superior to an artifact made from you.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m afraid you can’t control it. Its mysteries are beyond your grasp.” The being sneered.

“I’m aware. When you visited Celestial Court, you passed its secrets down to your disciple, that is how he became its lord. Otherwise, Primal and Derivation would have killed him long ago, given their hatred towards you.” Li Qiye said.

“My disciple is naturally exceptional.” The being said.

“Sure, but there’s something peculiar. He managed to reign for so long, is it only because he has control over Celestial Court? Or perhaps, he has a good relationship with Primal and the others. After all, you left him all alone with a horde of ravenous hounds, perhaps he befriended them. In terms of seniority, they’re his uncles.” Li Qiye said.

He smiled and continued: “He spent very little time with his master while the other seniors might teach him more. It’s too difficult for a kid to take care of the colossal Celestial Court alone.”

“Your attempt to sow discord and division is useless.” The being chuckled.

“Not at all.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Think about it, what did your favorite disciple do when your son was being hunted and killed? Not a damn thing. On the other hand, your grand-disciple, no, your son’s disciple, Purewood, was completely different. He picked up his master’s corpse and kept the brow bone as a memento. He even started a lineage and never gave up in his quest for vengeance.” [1]

He let out a sigh and said: “Look, your disciple didn’t bother to help despite having a heavenly treasure, he didn’t go to pick up your son’s corpse either and is probably not helping your grand-disciple. So after I present the facts, do you deny the close relationship between your disciple and your son’s killers?”

“Hmph, still not finished?” The being said.

“I’m sure you have the same doubts in your mind. Does your disciple think that you’re dead or does he just prefer to ignore your imprisonment here?” Li Qiye smiled.

“So?” The being said.

“Which one do you prefer? Let’s pretend that your disciple truly loves and admires you, a being of the light. He must have been disappointed after seeing your fallen soul, that is why he didn’t try to save you since you’re not truly his master.” Li Qiye mused.

“But, there’s another explanation.” Li Qiye smirked: “If he is conspiring with Primal’s group, then they want nothing more than your death. Do you prefer this one or the previous?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I am the darkness and care not about the past.” The being said: “Hatred does not spark from what you tell me.”

“I see, my effort is being wasted.” Li Qiye said helplessly.

“You will get nothing here for I have nothing to offer.” The being said.

“Is this the extent of your prejudice against me?” Li Qiye smiled: “They ate your son yet you care not. Your disciple is a potential traitor yet you care not again. But you and I, having no feud, and I traveled so far and spent untold efforts to return your head and blood only to be treated with distrust. No one else in the world is as kind to you as I am now yet why do you forgive your enemies and harbor such a deep bias against me?”

“Because you are the Dark Crow.” The being sneered.

“So being the Dark Crow is a sin? My very existence is a sin?” Li Qiye laughed.

“Dark Crow, there’s no need to feign innocence, I’ve been to Heavenrealm and so have you. We know who each other is and our goals. Primal, Derivation, and the others, are mere turtles retracting their head in fear. The best they can achieve is consuming and prolonging their existence a bit longer...”

The being paused for a second before continuing: “We are different. As long as I continue to exist, killing them is only a matter of time. However, given your treacherous plots, there’s a chance that it is you who will devour me, flesh and bones.”

“Sigh, what a terrifying way to describe me. You know that I do not feast, and I won’t eat you either.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You do not eat, but you have countless methods to make me be eaten. That’s why I will never cooperate with you, someone who has replaced my epoch. Only one can exist between us and I don’t think you’ll spare me even if I’m Trinity Ancestor. When I’m against them, victory is fine. I can’t say the same in the other scenario.” The being said.

“You know that they want me to kill you. Of course, they would do it themselves given the opportunity. They just don’t want to reveal their position and become prey. Moreover, there’s a chance that you will be reborn into the true Trinity Ancestor, not a fallen true soul. It’s suicidal to go against you then.” Li Qiye said.

“Exactly, so why shouldn’t I just observe on the sideline?” The being uttered coldly.

“You don’t have the chance because I can refine you right now, it’s either ashes or turning into my weapon.” Li Qiye smiled.

“As I’ve said, go for it then.” The being answered after a brief silence.

“Why are you giving up already? There’s a clear path to take, we can also negotiate if you wish. I am always a man of my word.” Li Qiye said.

“No need, death is inevitable if the Dark Crow wishes for it. Instead of struggling and living in fear every day, I might as well be refined now. I hope we understand each other at this point.” The being said.

“Sigh, it seems everyone has such a negative impression of me. How lamentable.” Li Qiye complained.

“If it weren’t for the difficulty of entering another time, some in Heavenrealm would be more than happy to descend and cut you to pieces despite the losses.” The being sneered.

“What can I say, I’m simply misunderstood by the whole world.” Li Qiye sighed softly.

1. The lineage is Primal Trinity, or Primal for short. I went back and changed all the Primal to Primal Trinity just because in this case, shortening the name worked against me since the killer was Primal Ancestor. When we have access to the mass-replace tool, I will replace all the Primal Trinity to just Trinity and change the name of the lineage entirely. This was a problem with shortening for readability and the names of some characters being too similar - Divine Ancestor, Primal Ancestor, Trinity Ancestor. Each has four characters, and the literal names would be Supreme Divine Ancestor, Supreme Primal Ancestor, and Trinity Supreme Ancestor. They have characters that can be translated into the same word in English, which adds to the mess here. Not to mention the lack of info and narrative when first throwing out these characters. All in all, just know that Primal in the lower continents is Primal Trinity, and this will be changed to Trinity later. If anyone is confused, throw me a message on Discord and I will elaborate. ?
