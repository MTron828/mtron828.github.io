Chapter 5085: The Lower Continents

Li Qiye looked around and smiled: “Where can you go?” 

With that, he took one step forward and disappeared as well.

A while later, everyone calmed down and started discussing this matter fervently.

“Conceal Conqueror lost and fled.” This news traveled fast across the lower continents.

Those who weren’t there in person couldn’t believe their own ears. This was especially true for those from The Race. It took them some time before accepting this reality.

Conceal Conqueror’s invincibility had been etched in their mind for quite a while now. Everyone agreed that she was the strongest cultivator in the lower continents after she took down her rival - Eight-stallion Dao Lord.

Her image shattered after this defeat. They couldn’t accept how she escaped from battle instead of upholding the reputation of their faction. They preferred a valiant death over this, letting the enemies know that members of The Race would fight to the very end.

Now, how could they face members of The People when their pride had been shattered?

Meanwhile, Li Qiye traveled through numerous lineages as he searched for Conceal Conqueror.

Eventually, he came across a land with temples scattered everywhere, both on the ground and in the air.

Due to his cultivation, he could hear ethereal chants permeating the region. This was Buddhism, one of the twelve lineages. True to its name, the main religion was Buddhism.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Massive statues resembling giants could be seen - a sign of this dao’s power and strong heritage.

Sumeru Emperor was born here. Later on, Dhyana Dao Lord had followers everywhere and started the Dhyana branch. His scripture brought Buddhism to another height for many eras subsequently.

“Amitabha…” Mahayana Buddha inside an ancient temple chanted with his palms together, having noticed Li Qiye passing by.

Of course, the others had no idea of this visitor.

His next destination was a land of light. The moon seemed to be everpresent and radiant here.

This world resembled a fairytale with countless wonders. There was an abundance of immortal aura, giving people a sense of the profound dao. The picturesque mountains and rivers gave them a glimpse of the immortal world desired by all.

This was Immortal Platform, a rather mysterious lineage. Its origin remained unknown, only that it was a subsidiary of Dao Alliance.

Despite having unknown roots, its techniques were second to none. Rumor has it that Nightmoon Conqueror came from here but this was never verified.

Nonetheless, cultivators across the years have found enough clues regarding their relationship. Of course, these were just indirect evidence, nothing concrete.

Li Qiye’s gaze flickered after entering this region. He eventually smiled and said: “Great, this place is blossoming. Seems like anything is possible.”

He took several more steps and went to a different location - Untethered. Instead of an immortal aura, it had a daoist focus. This pervasive dao constantly circulated and evolved, giving birth to numerous capable experts.

This was the strongest lineage of The People, allowing them to survive against the imperious Deity.

It was started by Dao Alliance from the upper continents, not by a single cultivator. When it was established, ancient gods descended and bestowed unparalleled powers to the land.

Inconcealable, Mortal-reversion, Ox-dragon Ancestor, Space Dragon Emperor… All of them were a part of Untethered once.

Throughout millions of years, numerous dao lineages rose and fell in the lower continents. Untethered managed to stand tall until the present. In fact, even Deity was destroyed once; this never happened to Untethered.

There existed a towering mountain with a massive ox-shaped boulder on top. It had endured the ravage of wind and rain for eras now.

In reality, this boulder might actually be older than Untethered. This was the legendary figure known by all as the strongest dragon lord with seven sacred fruits - Stone Ox.

He couldn’t leave the land. Rumor has it that they were one entity now. Because of this, his power far surpassed his cultivation after calling on the land. Some believed that his very existence was the reason for Untethered’s tenacious success.
