Chapter 5166: I Know A Little Bit

Li Qiye flicked the disobedient ginseng’s head as if he was disciplining it.

“Bam!” The ginseng immediately closed its eyes and let out two pitiful cries. It lay in his hand like a well-trained pet.

“What?” She became slack-jawed after seeing this.

According to the scrolls, this type of ginseng was violent. Her master would need to use a special seal in order to imprison it. What was that flick just now?

If it were so docile, no one would need to learn alchemy and special techniques.

“Was that an alchemy technique?” She asked.

“No, just a flick.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“...” She had no response but thought that he didn’t need to lie to her. Plus, it didn’t matter even if it was an alchemy technique since she learned nothing from it.

“Young Noble, are you an alchemist?” She asked with uncertainty, thinking that he was a hidden master.

“No, I just know a little bit about alchemy.” Li Qiye smiled.

Of course, he wasn’t a simple alchemist since he was the one who taught Alchemy Ancestor.

“I see…” She murmured.

“Boom!” Their conversation was interrupted by someone landing from the sky.

He wore a red robe while pulsing with a frightening demonic aura. The vegetation nearby withered due to his presence.

“Crimson Dragon Monarch.” She became alarmed after seeing him.

“Miss Shao Yao? Excuse me.” he politely said.

He was a crimson serpent who later on attained the dao. His venom had slain numerous foes before.

His affiliation was Divine Alliance. As a two-fruit dragon lord, he didn’t need to be polite to a junior like her. However, her background was unique and he might even need to ask her sect for help in the future.

“A one-million-year-old blood ginseng.” He gazed at the ginseng in Li Qiye’s hand.

She didn’t bother correcting his mistake because she made the same one.

“You caught it?” He asked Li Qiye, thinking that the guy got lucky.

“Yep, came across it by chance.” Li Qiye answered.

The monarch didn’t hide the greed in his eyes. This ginseng was extremely nutritious. Eating it might give him a third fruit or at the very least, prolong his life considerably.

“Are you a member of Alchemy Dao?” He hesitated, not wanting to provoke the wrong person since Alchemy Dao’s influence couldn’t be understated. Everyone wanted to please this sect so they would be more than happy to take care of its enemies.

“No.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

The monarch glanced at the saintess, hoping to see the truth.

She shook her head as well since this was the truth.

“Little Brother, I can feel a fateful connection between the ginseng and myself.” The monarch’s greed triumphed after receiving confirmation.

“How so?” Li Qiye asked.

The monarch took out a pot and said: “This is a priceless vessel. Would you like to make a trade?”

He paused for a bit before adding: “It can create a treasure each day for you and will guarantee a lifetime of wealth.”

The saintess thought that this was ridiculous. The monarch must be thinking that he was talking to a naive junior.

He was right about the pot’s effect. It could produce a treasure each day but this was limited to the mortal level. For example, a shining pearl or jade - completely worthless in the eyes of masters.

“I’m not interested in trading it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Little Brother, let me know what you want. How about joining Divine Alliance? I can give you a glowing recommendation.” The monarch insisted.

“No need.” Li Qiye flatly refused.

This infuriated the monarch. If it wasn’t for the saintess’ presence, he might have just taken it already.

“It is meant to be with me.” He repeated.

“Yes, you brought this up already.” Li Qiye nodded.

“So I must have it.” The monarch’s eyes became fierce.

“That’s your issue.” Li Qiye ignored the implication.

“Brat, be smart and hand it over.” The monarch changed his tone and uttered coldly.

“And if I refuse?” Li Qiye smiled.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The monarch was surprised, thinking that there was something wrong with the brat’s brains. Did he not know how to act before a dragon lord?

“Do you know who I am?” He asked.

“Just a nobody.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Hahaha!” The monarch trembled with rage before bursting out in laughter.

The saintess thought that the monarch was indeed relatively famous. However, the guy didn’t even know her master, let alone him.

“Brat, don’t you know your impudence is deserving of death?! Hand the blood ginseng and take the pot right now or I will end your life!” The monarch shouted, still insisting on a trade instead of robbing Li Qiye.

“You really want this blood ginseng?” Li Qiye smirked.

“Yes, hand it over now!” The monarch thought that Li Qiye was finally about to give up.
