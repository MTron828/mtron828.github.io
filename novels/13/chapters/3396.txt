Something happened to the ancestral peak of Divine Black two days after the battle.

“Boom!” Rays emanated from the top; the source resembled a rising sun.

“What’s going on?” The Divine Black members became startled and focused their attention there.

An inscrutable divinity also emerged from within the radiance.

“What is that?” Discussions sprung across the sect.

“A treasure, perhaps?” One quietly speculated.

“Not necessarily, maybe it’s the spirit of our patriarch.” His peer replied.

“I think that’s likely.” Many agreed with this because the ancestral peak was sealed all these years. The spirit of their patriarch returning to meet the descendants became a likely explanation.

However, a few elders and peak lords didn’t think so since they knew about the portal. They had uncertain speculations the moment they saw the radiance.

Unfortunately, no one could climb up there to see the actual event and had to watch from below.

Ping Suoweng had the best guess out of anyone since Li Qiye already told him about it. He watched the waves of light with bated breath.

“Buzz.” The radiance finally made it all the way out and floated above the peak.

When people got a clearer look, they realized that it was an altar full of power. It had numerous dao laws surrounding it in the shape of iron chains.

These laws were still moving in a particular order, seemingly brimming with life. The altar began spinning with the law, creating a magical rhythm. The rotation encompassed the reincarnation cycle along with the yin and yang. Watching this made people feel dizzy.

“Boom!” It instantly poured out a frightening power before the unsuspecting spectators. It surpassed the myriad realms and suppressed the firmaments. An ancient yet matchless imperial aura swept through Eight Desolaces.

“So powerful!” Numerous disciples got down on their knees from the pressure.

“Immortal Emperor Zhan!” Suoweng took a deep breath and understood the owner of the aura.

“Boom!” The altar suddenly broke through space and disappeared. The imperial weakened, allowing the kneeling disciples to stand up.

“What the hell was that?” No one could trace the speed of the altar earlier. Why did it come out of their ancestral peak then leave so quickly?

As for the peak lords and elders, they let out a sigh of relief. This was an amazing development for their sect.

Meanwhile, as the altar crossed through space, numerous mantras were activated. The imperial aura seemingly served as the fuel for the altar while the mantras acted like wings controlling its direction.

It shot out brilliant lights and sparks along the way, illuminating a vast area.

“An imperial aura?!” The top supremes in the northern region took note of this.

Numerous eyes in the ancient sects started opening. These eyes contained the vicissitudes of time.

“Immortal Emperor Zhang?” They knew what the thing shooting through space was right away.

“Finally, the treasure is opening soon!” One voice came from an ancestral ground of a certain sect. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“The treasury of Immortal Emperor Zhan.” One ancestor of an ancient kingdom had nothing but excitement in his eyes.

These beings who have been slumbering for millions of years finally woke up to trace the altar.

“Boom!” Finally, the altar pierced through the final dimension and disappeared from sight.

“Stone Plateau?” These beings have calculated the destination in just a short time.

The news of this began to spread to various sects. “Immortal Emperor Zhan’s treasury will open in Stone Plateau!”

“Order scouts there right now, also, whatever they find will be classified information.” One sect master ordered his best elites to start.

“So we finally know where it is now.” A royal lord personally headed for Stone Plateau.

The altar caused some of the strongest beings in the northern region to wake up.

In a towering peak, what seems to be a large boulder suddenly had a pair of eyes opening. The muddled eyes became bright as they gazed towards the landing spot of the altar.

“Immortal Emperor Zhan’s treasury? Not what I seek. Nonetheless, the ancestral vein of the Golem Race can’t fall to outsiders.” The thing murmured before closing its eyes to look like a regular boulder again.

Afterward, many ancient sects experienced visual phenomena containing an order.

One kingdom had an incredible atmosphere. There existed an area with numerous temples leading to the sky. It seemed to be a place to offer tributes for a supreme ruler.

Deep inside the most secretive hall was a coffin. The lid finally opened and a faint dragon roar could be heard.

“This isn’t a normal treasury. It pertains to an old secret.” An old voice came from the coffin.

The big shots of this kingdom became alarmed right away and immediately traveled to the temple.

“Forefather!” The members of this group all had white hair. They kneeled with respect.

“This might affect the future of the world. I must come out. You all will be the vanguards.” The voice spoke again.

The group became shaken once more. Their kingdom had faced existential crises before but this being never came out. This new development must be extremely pivotal.

“Yes, Forefather.” These big shots immediately carried out the order. Scouts began entering the plateau in order to find more information on this altar.

Clouds suddenly emerged on a sect as old as can be. Inside the clouds was an old palace. A sleeping existence also woke up. His illuminating eyes could see the mysteries of the ages.

“I see.” This existence wasn’t startled after noticing the treasury of the emperor: “A blessing or a disaster? How many people actually know about the legend behind Immortal Emperor Zhan?” A glint of worriness flashed in his eyes.

He had lived long enough to know certain secrets purposely hidden from the rest.
