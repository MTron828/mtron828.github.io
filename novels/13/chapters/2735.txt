Today, the slumbering Li Qiye suddenly woke up and summoned Chen Weizheng.

The sudden call surprised the unaware Weizheng. He immediately dropped all matters and ran over.

“Ancestor, I’m ready for your command.” Weizheng kneeled before Li Qiye.

“We’re taking a trip to Reincarnation Mountain City.” Li Qiye looked at him and ordered.

“To Reincarnation Mountain?” Weizheng didn’t expect this at all.

Though Reincarnation Mountain was still in Immortal Demon System, it was very far away from Mountguard.

“May I ask why do you need to go there? Perhaps I can be of assistance.” Weizheng hurriedly said.

Li Qiye hasn’t moved or got up from his wheelchair after all this time. Weizheng actually thought that Li Qiye’s physical body was done for and he couldn’t walk again.

The journey to Reincarnation Mountain was far and it would be very inconvenient. If possible, he would like to make the trip himself in Li Qiye’s stead.

“Just for a look.” Li Qiye stared at the distant with a strange expression, seemingly in remembrance. Perhaps something far away was summoning him.

After a while, he withdrew his gaze and said: “Not just me, pick seven disciples to take along. The warmth in the house can’t groom exceptional flowers. In order to become a sky-blotting tree, one needs to experience the rains and winds. It’s time for them to see the immensity of the world and train.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Of course, it would be faster for Li Qiye to go alone. However, he wanted to take advantage of this leisure time to train these disciples. He wouldn’t have the chance and the time after crushing the existence in his mind to help them train.

“I understand, I will carry it out right away.” Weizheng became excited and bowed.

He knew that his ancestor was a supreme master. To be escorted by a being like this was the best thing possible, the best opportunity for training. These disciples were lucky to have this chance.

“Ancestor, I’m afraid this will take some time because we don’t have the abilities to go there nor the means to enter the ancient battlefield for training.” He calmed down and thought about something else.

Mountguard no longer had the true stones to support the long journey to Reincarnation Mountain through their dao portal.

“Traveling through this vast world is also training. The dao heart will be polished as well.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand, I will make preparations.” Weizheng bowed.

He went to pick the right disciples and figure out the logistics for the trip.

After finding out about this potential trip, not to mention the youths, even the elders and protectors became excited.

Everyone knew that those heading out will become the future pillars of Mountguard. Most importantly, they would be lucky enough to learn from the ancestor himself. Just one word of advice from him was better than a century of hard training.

Just like that, these elders and protectors rushed to the school master to give him their recommendations, hoping that their most excellent disciple would be able to follow the ancestor.

However, Weizheng deliberately tried to be as partial as possible and only based his selections on certain criteria. Eventually, he picked seven after many rounds.

Of course, Guo Jiahui was the first to be selected. She climbed up the divine mountain on top of being chosen as the sage by Li Qiye. No one was more qualified than her.

Plus, he would have picked her either way because she has always been serving Li Qiye. Most importantly, she was the one who brought him back. This act was a great contribution to the sect.

Next was Zhao Zhiting. She wasn’t the most exceptional disciple either in the sect but her cultivation had improved tremendously, surpassing many peers in the process. Thus, she had boundless potential on top of always being with Li Qiye and Jiahui. She deserved a spot on the roster.

The third was their First Brother, Li Jiankun. This choice was obvious because he had the best talents and cultivation among the young generation. He was more mature and deliberate with his actions as well.

Of course, he was extremely happy and grateful after being selected. He had wanted to kill Li Qiye in the past and offended him in the conference hall once.

However, the ancestor didn’t hold a grudge, having taught him a merit law in the past and now selecting him for this? He felt that this was a truly benevolent act.

Four more excellent disciples were chosen. Among them was the sect’s youngest junior sister.

All were more than happy because they have seen Jiahui’s improvements after being taught by the ancestor. They were aware of the potential lifelong benefits.

Weizheng then reported to Li Qiye after preparing everything.

The group then left Mountguard for Reincarnation Mountain. Weizheng personally led the way at a normal pace.

The juniors were as excited as possible because this was their first long trip away from home. Moreover, with their ancestor around, they felt that everything was possible - the sky’s the limit - and that they were heroes going on a journey.

Unfortunately, this excitement didn’t last long.

It was the second day and Li Qiye stopped near a valley.

“Go, kill your way in. Don’t bother coming back out if you can’t make it to the snake lair.” Li Qiye gave the valley a quick glance before closing his eyes.

The valley was quite large with an ominous aura. Hisses could be heard from the poisonous serpents of varying sizes.

Bones scattered in this place too. Who knows if they belonged to humans or wild beasts?

The group felt their scalp tingling at this scene for it was their first facing such a dangerous location.

“Ancestor, this snake valley is relatively notorious. I don’t think the seven of them can handle it.” Weizheng’s heart skipped a beat.

It wouldn’t be a problem for him at all but these seven couldn’t handle it. Alas, Li Qiye seemed to be asleep in his wheelchair already.

Li Jiankun’s group exchanged glances and shuddered. In the end, Jiahui’s dao heart was the firmest and she wasn’t afraid at all.

“Let’s go, maintain a good formation, not too far but not too close either.” She was the first to come in.

“Come, don’t lose each other.” Jiankun didn’t want to falter behind and commanded.

“Sss!” A serpent naturally lunged towards the invaders.

Jiahui was fearless unlike the rest of the group.

“Kill them.” Her sword cut through this snake with lightning speed.

“Sssss!” More snakes came from all directions.

“Take them down!” Li Jiankun roared and joined his junior sister. Blood started gushing everywhere.

Though these snakes were relatively tough, they weren’t a match for powerful cultivators like the group.

The team heaved a sigh of relief after killing all the snakes.

“Boom!” This feeling didn’t last long. A snake as big as a dragon slithered out from the valley’s depth.

It crushed the trees in its path and made rocks fly everywhere. It towered before the group just like a mountain.
