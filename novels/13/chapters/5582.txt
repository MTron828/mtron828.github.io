Chapter 5583: Peace As Long As The Sage Is Around

A single slash put an end to a dragon lord of the anima level. North Star Grand Saint Wang Teng was considered to be just a few steps behind Supreme.

Most believed that it would only take another century for him to reach his peak state, capable of commanding dao lords and conquerors just like Supreme.

Given his potential, he was considered a better prospect than twelve-fruit dao lords and conquerors. Unfortunately, his life ended in this chapter.

No one caught the actual movement of the throwing star. They only saw a flash and that was it for Wang Teng.

In reality, apex cultivators could also kill Wang Teng by using their best merit law and treasure. It would first be a total suppression then a slow grind against the immortal shell and supreme dao. With those out of the way, the sacred tree and true fate would be exposed.

This took more than a single move. Not even Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan or Light-dragon Conqueror would be able to reduce Wang Teng down to particles in such a short time. This was a testament to the immortal weapon’s incredible potency.

Spectators were afraid and touched their neck instinctively while looking at the throwing star. Although it didn’t exude murderous aggression, it still frightened the hell out of everyone.

Its unbeatable nature became apparent. The most profound merit laws and strongest weapons used by a twelve-fruit dao lord or conqueror still wouldn’t stand a chance.

“Didn’t listen to sincere advice.” Li Qiye commented before caressing the weapon.

Everyone exchanged glances of silence.

“So does anyone else want to tell me who deserves this weapon?” Li QIye looked around and asked casually.

No response came because provoking him now meant losing their head.

“Talking won’t make you hand over the weapon anyway.” Six-finger remarked with a wry smile, aware of how silly he was for even coveting the weapon.

Li Qiye shrugged and said: “Of course, you have to take it by force if you want it.”

“With what force? We’ll lose our head the moment you use that weapon.” Jadesword couldn’t help but complain about the helpless situation.

“As the saying goes, blades do not have eyes. I can’t guarantee that there will be survivors.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I only have one question.” One of the Five Elders asked: “Where did this immortal weapon come from? Who managed to craft it?”

As ancient gods from the previous epoch, they had access to old knowledge.

“Above.” Li Qiye answered.

This caused the crowd to ruminate. The stronger members who had lived long enough found this intriguing and revealing.

“Are there immortals above?” Six-finger asked a key question.

Everyone awaited an answer with bated breath. Their world didn’t have immortals but what about the other realms?

“Depends on your definition of immortal.” Li Qiye had a faint smile as he answered.

Several questions popped up in the listeners’ mind. Most importantly - the origin of the throwing star. What kind of existence was its creator?

“Boom!” Suddenly, a sacred beam erupted from a particular region in Dao Domain, emitting omnipresent rays to even the remotest crevices.

They possessed a holy affinity as if a sage was entering the world. It made everyone feel safe - that there was a powerful and invisible hand protecting them. Of course, it could also change its mind and crush everything beneath in Dao Domain.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Wang Taishou!” Top cultivators became alarmed.

Only one dragon lord possessed this level of power in Dao Domain - Wang Taishou.

Mortals might feel safe beneath this holy affinity but they felt threatened.
