Chapter 3690: Trapped Dogs Will Bite

“Stop messing around. If I say three moves, it’ll be three moves.” Li Qiye ignored their rage and said flatly.

Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi had no words to say despite their anger.

“Brother Li, take one step back.” Li Xiangquan took a deep breath to calm down: “This was my fault so my clan is more than willing to befriend you. Our feud is not to the level of life and death. It’s better to have a friend than an enemy.”

“In the holy ground, you’ll be a tiger with wings with the support of our clans.” Zhang Yunzhi hurriedly added.

The two were as flexible and subservient as can be for survival’s sake.

“I don’t need friends.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

The crowd exchanged glances. The comment was emotionless and arrogant but it felt fine coming from Li Qiye.

Another direct refusal made it worse for the duo. They have repeatedly begged for mercy to no avail, only gaining further humiliation in the process.

“Li Qiye! You won’t be haughty for long! Kill me today and you won’t have anywhere to go in the holy ground even if you run to the end of the world. My clan will hunt you down and take your head!” Zhang Yunzhi saw that begging was of no use and started threatening him.

“Who says I’ll be running? You think too highly of yourself and of your clan.” Li Qiye smiled. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You won’t live for much longer after me. Our great army and members will make sure that you won’t have a grave. Our clan takes care of business!” Li Xiangquan joined in with a serious tone.

These threats would work on others because the Li and the Zhang were indeed influential at the holy ground. Moreover, they weren’t empty threats because these two clans would actually dish out vengeance. Sects and countries might go down as a result.

The crowd wondered if Li Qiye would be deterred.

“It’s useless. Threats don’t work on him or he wouldn’t be Li Qiye.” An expert who understood Li Qiye shook his head.

“Point taken. Now get ready for the next move, stop wasting time.” Li Qiye waved his hand at the two as if he was swatting a fly.

“See, that’s Li Qiye for you.” The expert murmured.

“Li, don’t be ridiculous, you don’t want to be torn apart by our clan member-!” Zhang Yunzhi roared. Who knows if this came from rage or fear?

“I’ll be waiting.” Li Qiye smiled and pointed his saber at the duo.

Zhang Yunzhi stopped shouting right away. The duo felt nothing but fear while looking at the saber. Their eyes narrowed - this saber was scarier than a grim reaper’s scythe.

If they could change their decision, they wouldn’t choose to provoke him. Alas, there was no other choice.

“Screw it!” Zhang Yunzhi roared and released his vitality. He started burning his true blood, resulting in loud explosions. Terrible silver rays emanated from him.

“Raa!” A dragon roar could be heard as he became one with his spear: “Soaring Dragon!”

He turned into a massive dragon and occupied the airspace. It soared forward to deliver a slash with its ferocious claws.

He chose to use his strongest technique while burning his true blood, hoping that this would be enough to reverse the situation.

“Die!” Li Xiangquan shouted.

“Clank!” He pointed his sword at the sky and summoned an ocean of lightning swords. He also burned his true blood without holding back. The blood manifested into violent flames.

Loud metallic ringings echoed continuously as the lightning swords fused together to form a bloody sword.

A vertical slash came next - enough to separate the myriad realms and destroy the soul.

Their last-ditch effort was quite impressive - a silver dragon attack and a vertical slash.

The crowd took a deep breath due to the power of their attack along with their choice to burn their true blood. Nonetheless, this might be their only way out of this fatal predicament.

On the other hand, Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye and still pressed his saber forward.

“Sword Point for the third time!” People were too familiar with this move now. They could imagine it with their eyes closed.

The saber tip immediately jumped out of the spatial constraints. It looked like an ordinary thrust yet the spectators were horrified.

Everything came to a halt right away. The dragon stopped roaring and the bloody sword no longer had vibrating hymns. They were sealed and couldn’t move an inch.

Once time and space started flowing again, the dragon and sword disappeared. Two thuds could be heard from corpses falling onto the ground.

Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan have lost their lives due to a deadly wound on their forehead. Blood was still gushing out.

They tried to escape with their true fate at the last second but the saber managed to destroy their true fate as well.

The spectators shuddered in astonishment. Li Qiye had declared that he would kill them after three moves. Sword Point allowed him to do so.

They stared at the cold corpses in silence, recalling how they ridiculed him prior for this declaration.
