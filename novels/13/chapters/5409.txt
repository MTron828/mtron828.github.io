Chapter 5410: Logic Does Not Apply

Immortal Pagoda Conqueror lost to a single slap. No, to be more exact, his portal and grotto were obliterated as well. The pagoda most likely left him with serious injuries.

Who would ever believe this story? Nonetheless, this was indeed the truth as gazes of fear and awe couldn’t stray from Li Qiye.

Someone had asked if he was still human. What else could he be? An immortal? But immortals did not exist in this world.

Some peerless dragon lords and conquerors realized something. They either cupped their fist or bowed in his direction in silence.

Such a monster was clearly above the “apex” cultivators of the upper continents.

“Clank!” By this time, Seven-star Conqueror was dragged before Li Xian’er. His ashen face showed that he had given up.

“Grant me a swift death.” He didn’t beg for mercy.

“Boom!” Her murderous aura engulfed him, causing him to scream once.

Since his dao fruits and true fate have been sealed, he was immediately reduced to a bloody mist.

The death of a six-fruit conqueror didn’t stir the crowd in the upper continents. After all, the majority of the crowd had experienced several gruesome wars before.

Moreover, they were still intimidated by Li Qiye, not daring to look straight at him.

“Stay here.” Li Qiye told the group before continuing deep into space toward the last destination of Dream Abyss.

The big shots watched his departure with bated breath. They thought that a great battle would ensue soon enough. However, only silence greeted them.

“Something seems off.” A top conqueror said softly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Why isn’t Dream Paradise reacting in the slightest?” A dragon lord gazed deep into the expanse but didn’t notice anything.

They knew that the deepest area of Dream Abyss was not available for entry; one would have to force their way in but this was easier said than done.

In the past, Apricot Dao Lord was incredible. She tried to reach the last area but was met with defeat and grievous injuries. None managed to fare better subsequently.

Despite wanting to find out what was there, they understood that they weren’t as strong as Apricot Dao Lord. Attempting to do so was suicidal.

Today, Li Qiye should have been greeted by an attack. Why was there nothing but silence? Dream Abyss was actually granting him entry?

They watched how he strolled deeper into space as if it were his own garden. The whole thing didn’t make sense.

“This does not make sense.” An ancient ancestor from an old era stood there in a daze.

“We just have to get used to it when dealing with Li Qiye. Logic does not apply to him.” A dragon lord sighed and said.

Meanwhile, Jadecure and the others only got up from bowing after Li Qiye was no longer in sight.

She then took out an old badge, slowly raising it into the air.

“An immortal order of Dream Paradise!” Everyone recognized it right away.

Some became alarmed and prepared to jump into another dimension. They heard how Illumination Conqueror tried to kill everyone with his wish.

What if Jadecure was attempting the same thing? No one would be able to get away.

Fortunately, she earnestly spoke: “Heed my wish, please release Calamity Dao Lord…”

“She wants to save Calamity Dao Lord.” Everyone understood her intention.

“Right, I think Calamity Dao Lord was from Imperial Attendant, it’s been too long.” An ancient ancestor recalled.

The dao lord came from Eight Desolaces and joined Imperial Attendant, becoming an apex cultivator due to his unbreakable defense. Alas, his pride and arrogance got the best of him, resulting in eternal imprisonment.

Later on, Imperial Attendant fell into declination and people forgot that it once had such a powerful cultivator among its ranks.

Jadecure and the other ancient ancestors watched with bated breath. They participated in the auction house that day for this goal alone.

After all, they lacked the ability to actually save him. The dream order was the only way. Once Dream Abyss opened, they came to fulfill this wish, not expecting to be attacked by Seven-star Conqueror. Fortunately, Li Qiye was in the right place and time to save them.

In reality, they had no idea that Li Qiye could save Calamity Dao Lord with a single command. There was no need for them to use the dream order in this manner.

“Crack!” The badge in her hand crumbled into pieces.

“Creak…” The gate slowly opened.

“It’s opening, this is happening!” Everyone became emotional and stared at the other side of the gate, not wanting to miss a single detail. Of course, no one dared to enter that place.

“Hahaha, and here I thought this day would never come!” A domineering voice came from within.
