Chapter 4828: My Turn

“Poof!” Dead Immortal refined this flame using the ten greatest immortal flames from his epoch. He named it “Immortal’s Demise”.

He sent it towards the Corporeal Zone and managed to make that section turn red. Alas, despite his continuous channeling, it didn’t gain any ground.

This flame could have ended an entire epoch but breaking through Corporeal Zone seemed more difficult.

“Activate!” The abyssal lord grew tentacles from all over his body with hands at the end. They attached themselves to Corporeal Zone and began sucking its power.

As he went all out, time and space in Eight Desolaces became chaotic. Everything became trapped and had to follow his momentum. Alas, this ultimate refinement still couldn’t do anything outside of sucking just a little of its power. It was far from being able to take down this defense.

They exchanged glances again and realized that they have miscalculated Corporeal Zone’s endurance.

“How do we force him out?” The alligator lord became impatient.

“Well, there is a simpler way.” Undying Lord said and the others understood instantly.

“Raa!” The alligator lord opened his gigantic mouth and took a deep breath. Clouds in the sky disappeared with haste.

“Rumble!” An oceanic tsunami emerged since the ocean nearby was being sucked dry by him.

“Boom!” Undying Lord released his death energy and turned it into a maelstrom. It was large enough to be seen anywhere on Eight Desolaces.

Dead Immortal suddenly became a liquid and spread out at an insane speed, ready to engulf this realm.

As for Lord of the Deeps, he also turned into an ocean and terrified all living beings.

“They’re starting.” The neutral overlords knew what they were going to do - force Li Qiye out by destroying Eight Desolaces. There was no way the creator would just watch his epoch being devoured.

Poor ancient ancestors and divine monarchs who once thought that they were standing at the apex felt so helpless. The four overlords were overwhelming so they could only tremble in fear.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Boom!” A thunderous blast detonated at this crucial moment. It sounded as if a heavenly tribulation was descending.

This astounded the four attacking overlords along with the hidden ones. The former immediately pulled back and retreated.

“Clank!” They then saw Li Qiye walking out of Corporeal Zone. The blast earlier came from his body.

It seemed that their plan was a resounding success. Li Qiye didn’t wish to see the destruction of Eight Desolaces.

“Boom!” Lightning bolts started leaving Li Qiye and rushed for the heavenly corpse, reducing it to ashes along with the curse.

That corpse and the Death Incantation were frightening but the power of the high heaven was simply on another level.

“Poof!” The last lightning bolt left Li Qiye and his wounds disappeared.

“He’s recovered…” The overlord hiding in space could see that Li Qiye was now back in full strength.

The group of four saw that the situation has deteriorated. They thought that they still had a little more time.

“Looks like this is it.” Li Qiye sighed since he couldn’t wait any longer. He stared at the four and smiled: “Preferring hell over heaven, I see.”

“We are hell, haha!” Triune Alligator Lord laughed thunderously.

These overlords have experienced countless hardships and trials before. They regained their composure right away despite facing a healthy Li Qiye.

“Is that so? Looks like one of my meals tonight will be alligator meat.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“That depends on your ability.” The alligator lord scowled.

“Trident.” Li Qiye commanded and the great trident answered his call.

“Die!” He threw the trident at the alligator lord, twisting the fabrics of reality and the laws of the world along the path.

“Bam!” The alligator lord caught the trident with both hands and staggered several steps backward. The tip was only one foot away from piercing his chest.

“This is Triune Trident! How can my own creation kill…” The alligator lord roared proudly.

“Raa!” Alas, he couldn’t finish his sentence because a kun peng suddenly appeared and helped pushed the trident farther.

“Pluff!” It finally pierced the overlord’s chest.
