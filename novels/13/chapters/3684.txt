Chapter 3685: Sword Point

“Take out your weapon!” Li Xiangquan glared at Li Qiye with lightning bolts flashing in his eyes. No one would dare to question the might of this lightning god.

All eyes turned towards Li Qiye who had performed numerous miracles before. They wanted to see what he could do against these two mighty foes.

Was there a treasure that could turn the tides to his favor?

“What treasure does he have? Didn’t the hug mouse like him? Maybe whatever that thing is, it’ll be enough to decide this battle.” One commenter quietly noted.

The eyes on him became hotter with anticipation. They wanted to see the mouse’s gift.

“An amazing treasure might not be usable right now since it takes time to train and get used to it.” An older expert shook his head. Nonetheless, the crowd’s enthusiasm didn’t diminish.

Li Qiye smiled and said: “I’m used to this thing, let’s use it.” He tapped on the blade hanging by his waist then took it out.

The thing didn’t emit any saber energy or terrible gales. It looked like a regular saber, not precious in the slightest. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Didn’t he use this for chopping wood?” Someone who was there at the mountain range couldn’t help asking.

“Chopping wood?” Many became surprised. They assumed that he would be taking out an amazing artifact, not a daily tool like this.

“Yes, I saw him chopping with it back at Myriad Beast.” The first speaker said with confidence.

In fact, people believed him right away. This saber didn’t look special at all. Using it for chopping wood wasn’t surprising.

“Isn’t this too much? He’s really looking down on his foes.” One cultivator murmured.

“He’s just tired of living.” A student from Duality who was a fan of the duo scowled.

Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan’s expression soured. Li Qiye didn’t take out a treasure and only used this regular blade to fight them? This was blatant contempt.

“You want to use that thing against our artifacts?!” Zhang Yunzhi shouted.

“More than sufficient.” Li Qiye shrugged.

Yunzhi became livid after hearing this response.

“We’ll see about that. Let’s get started then.” If gazes could kill, Li Xiangquan’s current gaze would cut Li Qiye to pieces.

“Sure.” Li Qiye casually pointed his saber at the duo.

“Is this a technique?” The crowd was stunned.

It was one thing to use this saber. Now, he didn’t bother putting up a real stance. This seemed more like a joke to him than a duel.

“Wait a minute... that’s Sword Point.” A Duality student regained his wits and noticed something peculiar.

“You’re right.” His friend took a closer look and confirmed.

“The sword technique left behind by Sword Emperor at your academy?” Other experts nearby joined the conversation.

“Yes, that’s the stance.” An expert who has visited Duality before said with certainty.

Many have seen “Sword Point” before and tried to comprehend it by copying the stance. Unfortunately, they could only imitate the external act, nothing more.

Li Qiye just made this duel a lot more interesting to the spectators.

“So he knows how to use it?” Discussions sprung up.

“No way.” The first reaction was one of denial.

“I haven’t heard of someone truly understanding this technique in history. Maybe only the top sovereigns or skillful swordsmen. A junior like him hasn’t embarked on the sword dao path, let alone trying to understand it.”

“Yes, this move is the essence of the sword dao. Only the wise sword users who spent their whole life learning have a chance.” One expert said.

The top cultivators here have researched this move. They knew that one needed to have high attainment in this dao before attempting to learn it. Li Qiye didn’t fulfill this requirement.

“Using a wood-chopping saber to perform a sword technique? There’s something wrong with his head.” Someone laughed.

It was incoherent and nonsensical to use a crappy saber for the sake of performing a profound sword technique.

“I’ll eat a rock if he can use it.” One Duality student taunted.

“Too bad you won’t have the chance.” The friends nearby burst out in laughter.

They thought that Li Qiye only wanted to copy the stance and had no idea what he was doing.

“Stop bluffing.” Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan didn’t believe it either.

“Let’s go!” They shouted in unison.

“Rumble!” The battle intent of the great army gathered on Zhang Yunzhi as he shouted: “Break!” He thrust his spear downward. It encompassed not only his power but also the force of the great army.

Explosions accompanied the path of the spear. It looked like a silver galaxy was descending. Countless sharp rays wanted to devour Li Qiye.

Li Xiangquan roared as well. The officials behind him also roared and blessed him with their powers. Numerous runes fused with his ocean of lighting.

“Clank!” He thrust his sword forward with a speed faster than lightning. Time seemed to be coming to a halt.

Even the most agile cultivator would be one step slower than this sword thrust. It had both speed and blessings of the officials. Their wills focused at the tip, allowing it to break through both heaven and earth. Nothing could stop its sharpness.

He aimed straight for Li Qiye’s throat. It was impossible to dodge - the crowd thought.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye still had the same pose against the incoming attacks.

“Dodge it!” A cultivator instinctively shouted, not wanting to see the guy die.

Li Qiye seemed to be lost due to the speed of the sword thrust. He must have been afraid or just couldn’t react fast enough. That’s why he looked frozen in the spectators’ eyes.
