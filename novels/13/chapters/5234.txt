Chapter 5235: I’ll Trade

Three competitive bids have been placed and Boss Tang showed interest in them all.

Omniscient Dao Lord representing Cleansing Incense coughed and solemnly took out a box as well. Within was a gem sealing a broken piece of metal smaller than a baby’s fist.

Upon closer inspection, the metal seemed to be wiggling around, capable of communicating and morphing in accordance with its master’s thoughts.

“This thing has an incredible history.” Omniscient Dao Lord introduced.

“What is it?” Skysword Dao Lord asked.

“How should I put this? It is related to Gargantuan Dao Lord but its history goes far deeper, being connected to a certain existence.” Omniscient Dao Lord said.

“Gargantuan Dao Lord.” Everyone had a serious expression after hearing this title.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Rumor has it that she was born with an immortal bone. Her power could crush the myriad dao. She came from Imperial Clan and was destined for greatness from birth.

She truly dominated Dao Alliance during her golden age. Thus, she was considered to be on the same level as Luminous and Heaven Burial Conqueror.

Regular people didn’t see the connection between her and the piece of metal. However, apex cultivators could see that the metal was special.

“What about its deeper history?” Suppression Conqueror asked.

“If immortals exist, let’s say that it was once in the hand of an immortal.” Omniscient Dao Lord said.

“They do not.” Xiao Qingtian said.

“True, but that does not mean that there will not be one in the future.” Omniscient Dao Lord nodded with a smile.

The others didn’t comment since this topic was out of reach.

“So how is it related to Gargantuan Dao Lord?” Ye Fantian couldn’t help but ask. This was her first time seeing such an intriguing piece of metal.

“Perhaps Fellow Daoist Li knows a bit more.” Omniscient Dao Lord stared at Li Zhitian.

The latter answered: “I’m not quite sure, perhaps it is somehow connected to my ancestor’s immortal bone.”

Since he was from the same clan as Gargantuan Conqueror, he felt something peculiar about the metal.

“Everyone believes in the existence of the Nine Heavenly Treasures. This is a remnant piece.” Boss Tang joined the conversation.

“That’s right.” Omniscient Dao Lord couldn’t help but praise: “Boss Tang, your knowledge is incredible but keep in mind that it is more special than just that.”

“Indeed, its value is more than what it is.” Boss Tang understood: “Looks like everyone is here with sincerity.”

He smiled at the participant, happy with the bids. The only ones who haven’t made a bid were Jue Xian’er, Suppression Conqueror, and Celestial Stone Dao Lord.

“Boss Tang, you can take a look at our medicine.” Resplendent Monarch wanted to entice the merchant.

Normally, people would be begging him for a chance to buy these pills. Alas, he was the one in need right now.

He thought that by letting Boss Tang check the grade of the pills, it would improve the chance of success.

He opened the bottle and released the peerless medicinal fragrance. The big shots salivated after smelling this life-saving medicine.

In fact, even Suppression Conqueror wanted to buy some despite their current antagonistic relationship.

“How wonderful, a prime product from Heavenly Sage Yuan.” Boss Tang sniffed as well.

Suddenly, he paused and stared at Resplendent Monarch: “Wait, this is not from your Alchemy Dao.”

Everyone became surprised because which other lineage could concoct such a high-level remedy?

“What makes you say that?” Resplendent Monarch couldn’t believe it either because this was indeed the case.

“The final bottle of finest-grade Nine-form Imperial Remedy made by Heavenly Sage Yuan was sold by me. I kept it for a while and was very familiar with its smell.” Boss Tang said.

“Your knowledge has no bounds. Yes, the cauldron was started by our Panacea Monarch but in the end, we only found success with the help of Young Noble Li.” Resplendent Monarch revealed.

“Young Noble Li.” Skysword Monarch knew who it was right away.

“Young Noble Li?” Boss Tang’s expression changed dramatically after hearing this.

“Haha, good, it’s decided then.” He suddenly laughed and grabbed the bottle: “The order is yours, Resplendent Monarch.”

His sudden decision surprised everyone. Suppression Conqueror hastily said: “We still haven’t bid.”

“Sorry, I just like this medicine bottle too much. Who knows, it might save my life one day.” Boss Tang laughed heartily and handed the dream order over to Resplendent Monarch.

The latter couldn’t believe it because he didn’t have that much confidence in winning against the rich participants.

“I’ll be going then.” After having the order in his hand, he bowed and immediately left.

No one else could interfere or scheme because of the auction’s rules. Boss Tang was not one to trifle with.
