Chapter 4535: Where Is The Grave?

Yu Zun couldn’t answer this and shook his head: “I know very little about Pioneer Ancestor, only that he was a true dragon soaring on the horizon. His vision eluded frogs like us. Hmm, if I have to pick something, it would be that he took several long journeys during his prime.”

Normally, ancestral grounds were immobile. The destruction of the ancestral ground spelled the demise of a sect.

For the Yu, God Vessel was their ancestral ground. It was usually always on the move with no goal in sight.

Because of this, their disciples rarely went out. After all, they were always going out together as a clan. Therefore, a powerful ancestor such as Pioneer normally guarded God Vessel. The ship would take him wherever he wanted.

Thus, it was noted that he left the ship several times. The descendants didn’t know the reason for his departure. Perhaps these journeys gave him the idea of burying himself in Yin Yang Crossing.

“Reincarnation and rebirth are just legends, your ancestor can’t do it.” Jian Ming doubted.

Anyone else would be livid by this comment regarding their ancestor. However, Yu Zun only shook his head and said: “Other ancestors mentioned it, living again was definitely his goal.”

“Such wishful thinking.” Li Qiye, who has been quiet the entire time, finally commented.

“I haven’t heard of a successful case.” Jian Ming said.

“The place is incalculable too. Trying to do so would result in calling the ominous.” The daoist added.

“Your clan had tried before?” Jian Ming stared at the daoist.

“We had ancestors wanting to understand the crossing. Unfortunately, only failure and mysterious death ensued. Because of this, we are told to never seer into that dangerous place.” The daoist answered.

“Dangerous it may be, we still have to go or we won’t be able to get the dao stone.” Wise said helplessly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“We could be walking to the gate of hell or the reincarnation cycle.” Jian Ming found this dreadful.

Wise then asked Yu Zun: “Putting this matter aside, did our ancestral aunt take anything with her for the burial?”

Though they speculated that the dao stone might be with Pioneer Ancestor, Wise still hoped that there might be another possibility, hence the inquiry.

“Well…” Yu zun didn’t have a response.

Normally, it would be improper to ask this about someone else’s ancestor. In this case, she did originally come from the four clans so it seemed fine for Wise to ask.

“I don’t have an answer.” He said: “The ancestral aunt passed away a very long time ago. What I know came from recent ancestors.”

“Can we somehow find her grave?” Wise asked again.

“That’s hard to say. As you know about our custom, the majority of members will be buried on the spot without a memorial tablet or records. Dust to dust, returning to the earth.” Yu Zun sighed and said.

There were reasons for this custom. Firstly, they didn’t have their own territory. Secondly, they didn’t follow the orthodox path, having robbed and stole from numerous great powers. If others were to know that they were buried nearby, the graves would not be safe. This made the omission of memorial tablets and records necessary.

“We might be able to find it, it’ll just take a very long time.” Yu Zun said without any guarantee.

Wise then coughed and mentioned something sensitive: “If we find our ancestral aunt’s grave, would you give us permission to respectfully open it? What about Pioneer Ancestor’s grave?”

He put it rather delicately. In other words, the four clans must open the graves in order to find the dao stone. This, of course, required permission from the Yu.

“Hmm…” Yu Zun smiled awkwardly and then answered: “The truth is that we don’t know the exact location of Pioneer Ancestor’s grave. We couldn’t help at all, the only thing we can do is remember and honor him.”

A fool could tell that Yu Zun was giving implicit permission. If the four clans could actually enter Yin Yang Crossing and find the grave, then the Yu would close their eyes and ignore this matter.

“As for the ancestral aunt, we would have to negotiate after finding the grave. It might take some time too.” He added.

Yu Zun was being reasonable enough because after marriage, the ancestral aunt became a member of the Yu. If her maternal side wished to excavate her grave, they would still need permission.

“We shouldn’t wait for the ancestral aunt’s grave. According to my calculations, the crossing will be actually opening soon.” The daoist told Wise.

“Then we should go to Yin Yang Cross first. It would be problematic if the ancestor is already gone once we’re there.” Wise agreed and stood up.

“Why do you keep saying we? It’s just us, the four clans.” Jian Ming brought up something else: “You’re trying to get close to us and scheming something, aren’t you?”

The daoist gave him a disdainful glare and ignored him.

“So be it, Yin Yang Cross first before Pioneer Ancestor is gone.” Li Qiye stood up and ordered.

Yu Zun got up and cupped his fist: “Young Noble, may I have permission to ask you something?”

“Speak.” Li Qiye said.

He scratched his head and said: “Young Noble, as an ancient ancestor, are you older than Wise Ancestor?”

“Yes, old enough to be forgotten.” Li Qiye glanced at Wise then said.

“My question is regarding our clan.” Yu Zun hesitated before asking: “I heard that during the Chaotic Era, the four clans followed a big shot here. All of them came from the same place. I believe that our clan also had ties with this place?”
