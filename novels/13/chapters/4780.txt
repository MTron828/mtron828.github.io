Chapter 4781: Foolish

The strongest characters of Sky Border have arrived. They have reigned for eras now and continued their domination to the present day.

Six-dao Monarch cultivated the longest under the tutelage of All-things Dao Lord since he was an exceptional disciple. Later on, he took over the administration of the sect and taught fellow disciples in his master’s stead. Therefore, he possessed both monstrous cultivation and other resources.

As for Dao Sanqian, one didn’t need to waste words on his power. Just telling people that he was the teacher of five dao lords was enough or just his title, “Teacher of Lords”.

During his active generation, his energy engulfed Eight Desolaces. With his own abilities and no outside help, he dominated the realms.

After finishing his grand dao, he changed one dao into three thousand and started a sect. His leadership resulted in prosperity for his followers and gave birth to many more capable tributaries. For example, Paramount Gate and many others had deep ties with Three Thousand Dao.

He had too many accomplishments to list but regular cultivators still enjoyed his stories with the dao lords the most. 

He was the dao protector of Eight-stallion, the master of Three-truths since the dao lord’s youth, and once guided Skystone…

Therefore, the top cultivators and supreme geniuses in subsequent generations all addressed him as “teacher” from a distance.

Currently, he stood at the apex after obtaining numerous incredible fortunes and artifacts, not to mention his peerless status and connections.

Some believed that he could serve as a mediator in any conflict. Just one word of his could put an end to wars because dao lords had to give him face.

The appearance of these two lords could shake the world in any era. The biggest problems could be easily solved by them. 

Unfortunately, this was an exception. Instead of kneeling and celebrating in their presence, a strange silence engulfed the crowd.

The man standing opposite them was different. Despite lacking flashiness, he still outshined the radiant duo.

So what if one was the first disciple of a famous dao lord or the teacher of the dao lords? None of this mattered because Li Qiye was the brightest sun. The person the crowd was kneeling to was Li Qiye, not them.

“What a lively day.” Li Qiye smiled and stared at them: “I don’t think the two of you will change anything here.” 

The crowd held their breath. Both Dao Sanqian and Six-dao Monarch clearly couldn’t make Li Qiye serious, the same way as a mortal wouldn’t give two ants another look before stomping them.

“Dao Brother, we bear no malice.” Dao Sanqian calmly said.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye had an amused look.

“You are unique in history who has experienced an eternity longer than my own. How could we have malice toward you? I myself have nothing but respect for your contributions, you are our role model.” Dao Sanqian said earnestly.

The crowd thought that these two would be annoyed by Li Qiye’s disdainful attitude. However, this didn’t seem to be the case. What was Dao Sanqian talking about? Why the respectful tone?

“Seems like you know quite a bit.” Li Qiye responded.

“It is a blessing of three lifetimes to be able to see you, Dao Brother.” Dao Sanqian said.

“Enough flattery, state your intention.” Li Qiye said.

Dao Sanqian and the monarch exchanged glances.

The monarch took over instead and said: “Dao Brother, your recently-obtained heavenly treasure must be Corporeal Zone.”

“See, you do know quite a bit.” Li Qiye chuckled.

Listeners became emotional. The nine treasures’ existence was all but confirmed at this point. Now, they finally learned one of their names and that Li Qiye was in possession of it.

“Corporeal Zone.” They murmured.

Surprisingly enough, one of the greatest treasures in the world didn’t have a grand title. Corporeal Zone seemed rather ordinary. Moreover, they couldn’t speculate what it was or its effects just from the name.

“I have heard of the nine treasures since youth but never got the fortune to see one. Today, your success must mean that you’re chosen by the heaven.” Dao Sanqian praised.

“Chosen by the heaven?” Li Qiye smirked.

“My master said that Corporeal Zone can accommodate the world itself within. Would you broaden our horizon by showing us the treasure?” Six-dao Monarch said.

He spoke without malice, only eager anticipation. All eyes fell on Li Qiye next.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
