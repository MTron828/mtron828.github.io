Chapter 5311: Division

Li Qiye gazed into the distance and said: “The process of crafting a paragon artifact is awfully cruel, usually requiring burying the entire world.”

“The entire world…” Li Zhitian became emotional after hearing this. He imagined the sacrifice needed in order to craft such a weapon.

“True Bones.” The old servant murmured, revealing his rich knowledge of history.

“Impressive.” Li Qiye praised.

“I’ve only heard of it by chance, not strong enough to actually verify it.” He said humbly.

“Well, did Stonesplitter Patriarch craft an epoch artifact?” Zhitian couldn’t help but ask.

“It’s easier said than done. The crafting process requires perfect circumstances. Certain things are forbidden by the villainous heaven, hence abandonment.” Li Qiye smiled.

“The four broken realms were abandoned.” The old servant understood.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Too many evil things have happened in these places so they were buried. However, the great calamity changes the landscape of the world, this hidden history will resurface in due time.” Li Qiye added.

Zhitian learned many new things today regarding the broken realm. This was certainly outside of his expectation.

“What about Ultimate and Perish, what happened there?” He said with a soft tone.

Li Qiye only stared at him and didn’t answer.

“Each realm represents a lord.” The old servant elaborated after gaining insight into these legends.

“That’s indeed the case. It’s just been too long for people to know now.” Li Qiye said.

“So four lords who created the broken realms?” Zhitian asked.

“Epoch lords.” Li Qiye gave a short answer.

Zhitian took a deep breath since these beings were far above dragon lords and conquerors.

“Let’s keep going.” Li Qiye started walking.

“Young Noble, what are we searching for?” Zhitian asked along the way.

“An incomplete product.” Li Qiye said.

“How is it incomplete?” He asked.

“Do you know what the most successful race that has been derived from Reborn is?” Li Qiye asked with a smile.

“Hmm, either the blood or the ghost race.” He thought about it for a bit before answering.

“They are indeed successful and accepted by heaven and earth. However, there’s not much ingenuity or newness there compared to a particular race. They are feared by all and hated by the heaven.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“What is it?” He asked.

Li Qiye’s smile disappeared as he revealed the answer: “The ancient ming.”

“I thought that they are extinct!” The old servant blurted out.

“Yes, that is true.” Li Qiye nodded because he was the one who personally eradicated them.

“According to the legends, Celestial Court had banished them from this land.” Zhitian said.

“Celestial Court likes to embellish their history. Nether and Brilliant’s insignificant abilities couldn’t have banished the ancient ming. In fact, without Purewood’s help, who knows if Celestial Could could have survived?” Li Qiye said.

“I see…” Zhitian smiled wryly because his clan was once a pillar of Celestial Court. He continued: “The ancient ming was that strong?”

After all, Celestial Court has stood strong despite having apex emperors and dao lords as their enemies. Now, Li Qiye listed the ancient ming as a force that could have destroyed them.

“A forbidden race, virtually undying. Their evil is unknown to the present generation.” Li Qiye said.

“Undying?” Zhitian commented.

“Not in the literal sense, but a few races can reproduce rapidly through division.” Li Qiye said.

“So they were derived, but from what abominable combinations?” Zhitian asked.

“Not through combination and reproduction this time.” Li Qiye smiled at him, causing him to have goosebumps.

“But didn’t you say that creation was impossible?” Zhitian asked.

“It’s rather close, hence the heavenly tribulations to punish them.” Li Qiye said.

“How did they come into being?” Zhitian’s curiosity grew.

“If you must know, it’s rather simple.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Simple?” He was sure that the answer would be strange.

“They reproduce with themselves.” Li Qiye said.

“What? How would that work…?” He murmured.

“It is a sinister method, they use other living creatures as nourishment in order to multiply.” Li Qiye said: “Thus, in order for them to survive, they must act as parasites among the other races, growing stronger and multiplying via devouring.”

“Such strange creatures.” He didn’t know the details of the process but this definitely felt evil.

“That’s why the high heaven does not tolerate their existence. Normal means of reproduction are forbidden, so parasitism and division are the only ways.” Li Qiye said: “The various factors turn them into abominations since birth.”

“I don’t understand.” He said: “What is the point of attempting to create these races? Where are the benefits?”

The derivation process was foul and disgusting. Why did someone attempt this?

“There are madmen who compare themselves to the heaven, wanting everyone else to conform to their ways.” Li Qiye responded.

“I see.” He said.

“Only the villainous heaven can create something out of thin air. As for us lowly ones, we must resort to reproduction.” Li Qiye went on.
