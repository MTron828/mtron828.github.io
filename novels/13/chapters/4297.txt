Chapter 4298: Eight Tiger Demon

Vengeance came swiftly. In just two days, Eight Demons came and surrounded Little Diamond.

“Clank! Clank!” The latter’s members became alarmed after hearing the warning gongs.

“They’re here!” The disciples guarding the base blew their horns.

Those who heard the warning immediately dropped their current task and ran to their assigned post.

The elders also moved with urgency. They had been assigned clear responsibilities. Some stayed in the sect while others went to command disciples.

Eight Demons’ force consisted of several hundred disciples, looking rather aggressive and fierce.

“Close the gate!” The fifth elder ordered.

“Creak…” The arched gate at the base slowly closed.

This gate had a rich history and served as one of the toughest defenses of Little Diamond.

Meanwhile, hybrid demons lined up right outside - bulls, serpents, fiery crows… FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

They already had weapons at the ready despite a lack of command - axes, spears, and pagodas…

The two sects weren’t far from each other, only several hundred miles or so. Thus, they arrived in no time at all after hearing about Du Weiwu’s injury.

“Little Diamond, come accept your fate!” He appeared among the demonic horde and roared.

His face twisted with both rage and complacency, ready to exact his revenge.

“Boom!” A massive figure appeared before them.

“Raa!” Its demonic energy and murderous intent forced its own allies back.

The members inside Little Diamond were frightened as well. Their legs trembled as their face turned pale.

“Eight Tiger Demon!” Those from Little Diamond jolted in fear.

This tiger demon had a tall and sturdy physique with the character “king” on his forehead. His eyes shone frighteningly.

He was none other than the sect master of Eight Demons and Du Weiwu’s uncle. Strangely enough, Weiwu was a deer demon while his uncle was a tiger demon.

“Elder, the tiger demon himself is leading.” A disciple from Little Diamond reported this to the first elder.

“Can we stop him?” One elder asked.

“He is at the grand level of the yin yang realm.” The fourth elder became worried.

When their previous sect master was alive, he was about as strong as this tiger demon. Now, only the first elder was in the yin yang realm. Alas, he was only at the minor level.

“Eight Tiger, why are you here?” The fifth elder was in charge of the gate and asked the aggressive demon.

“You already know the answer. You injured my nephew and insulted my clan. We need an answer or we’ll flatten your sect.” Eight Tiger barked back.

The elders naturally knew that Du Weiwu must have embellished the stories to make himself the victim. Thus, this assault wasn’t unexpected at all.

“Eight Tiger, you only heard a one-sided account. We might be a small sect but we know better than to bully a junior. Your nephew’s greed and disrespectful attitude towards our sect master warranted the punishment.” The fifth elder said.

“Lies!” Du Weiwu jumped out and shouted: “I came with sincerity to help your sect but you repaid kindness with malice, going as far as severing my arm! Today, I will have vengeance and watch the downfall of your sect!”

“The truth cannot be hidden forever.” The elder ignored him and spoke with the tiger demon instead: “Eight Tiger, reconsider this, don’t start a war over a junior.”

“Hahaha, I’m afraid this won’t be a war, only a one-sided massacre. This is the end for your sect.” The tiger demon smiled coldly.

“Are you sure about that?” The fifth elder’s tone became serious.

“Fifth, you can’t scare me. Your sect master is dead so no one in your sect can take me on. I alone can sweep this place uncontested. Who’s going to stop me?” The demon said.

Junior members of Little Diamond became anxious after hearing this.

“We’ll see about that, Eight Tiger.” The first elder finally appeared on top of a peak.

The demon stared at him and burst out in laughter: “Hahaha, long time no see, First Elder. You’re only at the minor level and can’t last that long against me. It’s over for your sect once I kill you.”

“You are so sure of victory already.” The elder coldly responded.

Meanwhile, the disciples from Little Diamond crowded near the gate, ready to fight to the death.

They were weaker but had no intention of retreating, ready to die protecting their sect. Thus, Little Diamond had several advantages - defensive position and morale.

“Eighty to ninety percent.” The demon said: “But I do not want needless bloodshed. There is an easy way to make me retreat.”

“We’re listening.” The first elder said with a sarcastic tone.

“Firstly, hand your new sect master over so I can avenge my nephew. Secondly, hand over your merit laws, including the recently obtained one. Lastly, half of your territories will belong to us.” The demon revealed.

The side of Little Diamond trembled with rage. Their hands shook violently since these conditions were too humiliating. They would rather die fighting.

Ultimately, the last two conditions were akin to a complete takeover. Their sect would only exist in name afterward.

“Your demand is ridiculous! We’re not that easily bullied. The outcome is still to be decided.” The first elder shouted back.

“Is that so? I guess since you all are courting death, I will lend you a hand. Well, since I’m so merciful, I will give you three-quarters of an hour first to deliberate. Hmph, if you still won’t concede then, we will attack.” The demon decided.

“Raa!” The demons at the base of the mountain roared after hearing this.

“Sect Master, what should we do?” Elder Hu asked Li Qiye who was only looking at the sky, not caring about the demons.

He finally looked down after being asked for a command.
