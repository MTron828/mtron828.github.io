Chapter 5812: Sowing Discord?

“Dark Crow, your words do not dictate what we do.” Heaven Authority smiled.

“I’m afraid your fate is in my hand.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Hmph.” Devil Bestowment disagreed: “Our Trinity Epoch is far older than your Seven Night Epoch, do you think you can suppress us?”

“You tell me.” Li Qiye smirked.

“The Ancestors from our epoch are still around.” Divine Eternal said.

“Let me see...” Li Qiye said: “Outside of the slain Divine Ancestor and the missing Trinity Ancestor, there are five overlords left from Trinity, not a small number.”

“Yes, and your epoch has you alone.” Heaven Authority said.

“True.” Li Qiye responded: “I do feel a bit inadequate, all this work and it’s only me.”

“Your epoch is still too young, its foundation cannot compare to ours.”

“Sigh, true again, still not enough years.” Li Qiye sighed sentimentally before smiling: “But that’s okay, quality over quantity. I alone am enough to deal with Trinity Epoch.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Don’t be so sure about the outcome.” Devil Bestowment sneered.

“I live, you die. Since Trinity Epoch is in the past, I will flatten it now, no need to continue to exist in this pitiful manner.” Li Qiye said.

“It will never fall.” Heaven Authority asserted.

“So confident in your supreme overlords. I actually have the opposite opinion, your Trinity Epoch might be old but it wasn’t an exceptional one. Now, if Trinity Ancestor were still around, then perhaps it could be competitive. He at his prime would be something to see, quite a good fight. I can’t say the same about the other five overlord turtles.” Li Qiye said.

Meanwhile, listeners were engaged since these secrets had been revealed for the first time.

“If Trinity Ancestor had been around, it wouldn’t be your epoch right now.” Divine Eternal said.

“Tsk tsk, think first before speaking. Trinity Ancestor looked down on your Primal Ancestor, he’s not part of the blood branch. As the messengers, you need to mind your words or your masters won’t be happy and might wring your neck.

Divine Eternal scowled in response.

“Whether my epoch can start with him around is debatable, but I can assure you, you would have no position in Celestial Court. Trinity Ancestor despised your masters, especially a pervert like Lord of Derivation. He’ll chase them off lest they infect Celestial Court with their ignorance.” Li Qiye continued.

“Always sowing discord, Dark Crow.” Heaven Authority said.

“Am I? You all know this better than anyone. Where were you when your guest was besieged and beaten? Hahaha, instead of saving the progenitor of your epoch, you all were probably celebrating, hoping for his death so that you can keep Celestial Court to yourself.” Li Qiye said.

“A wretch has a wretched perspective.” Devil Bestowment rebuked.

“The facts speak for themselves, you turned a blind eye instead of attempting to save him.” Li Qiye said: “I’m curious, were you all quaking with fear when he returned from the expedition?”

“Of course not.” Heaven Authority snorted.

“No? Your supreme overlords conspired with Twilight Hunter’s group to devour Divine Ancestor, you weren’t scared when his father returned?” Li Qiye said.

The trio’s expression became unsightly.

“Although you didn’t participate, don’t pretend like you didn’t know about this. Your Ancestors most likely didn’t dare to breathe loudly upon his return and went into hiding all this time.” Li Qiye chuckled.

Listeners knew little about Trinity Ancestor and his son, Divine Ancestor. So it turned out that the relationship between the overlords of Celestial Court was rather complicated.

Now, Light-dragon and Heaven Burial finally understood some of the events in the past. While their guest was trapped in High Heaven Aegis, did they really go full force against Imperial Field?

It was one thing if the guest was an actual outsider, but he turned out to be Trinity Ancestor who had deep ties with Celestial Court. They should have done everything they could to aid him, the three immortals and the founder included.

Now, it became obvious why things turned out that way.

“Hmph, nonsense.” Heaven Authority said.

“Instead of trying to refute the truth, start thinking about whether your Ancestors will do anything today. After all, they might not want to take the littlest risk and lose everything after being patient for eras.” Li Qiye smiled.
