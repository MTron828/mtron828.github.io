Chapter 5289: Women Only Slow Me Down

Li Qiye preferred the edamame beans while the man focused on eating meat during their conversion.

“What about your younger brother?” Li Qiye asked.

“Let’s not talk about him, too arrogant and looks down on everyone.” The man didn’t like his siblings, especially the younger one.

“I see.” Li Qiye visualized a particular type.

“Always thinking about grand plans and putting up an act.” The man shrugged and added.

“I want to meet him.” Li Qiye smiled.

“He should be in Firmament, I don’t know the exact location because we were separated from birth.” The man said.

“You three brothers are quite interesting.” Li Qiye said.

“Not really, we’re rather different.” The man murmured.

“Have you thought about coming together again?” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

“Why should we? I don’t even want to see them, it’s too uncomfortable being near each other.” The man refused.

“But you’re still blood brothers.” Li Qiye said.

“Who says that blood brothers need to stay together? Staying with my older brother is suffocating. As for the young one? I don’t even want to look at him, always rolling his eyes and giving people looks of disdain.” He said while rolling his eyes upward.

“You should come with me.” Li Qiye finished the last peanuts before patting his hands clean and said.

“No, I’m busy here, no time to…” The man couldn’t finish before Li Qiye pushed a pile of silver ingots across the table.

His eyes lit up while looking at the shiny pile.

“They’re real?” He wondered how the guy got so rich.

“Of course.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

He picked up one of them and bit the corner. Sure enough, the taste was right. He then held one near to his ear as if trying to listen to something. This still wasn’t reassuring enough so he picked one more for another bite.

Li Qiye patiently sat there and sipped some wine, not in a hurry at all.

After confirming the silver ingots, the man pulled the pile closer to him and stared at Li Qiye: “You’re really giving this to me?”

“Yes, this is enough for you to remarry a pretty wife, have three to five kids or whatever.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Bah.” He started putting the ingots into his pocket before spitting on the ground: “Who wants a pretty wife, women and children are annoying and will just slow my cooking down. I’m better off alone.”

Once he got everything off the table, he patted his pocket with satisfaction, looking like someone who had just belched after a great meal.

“I’ll take my tavern and tag along with you, I don’t know how long though. I won’t be close either, I’ll just open shop at a place I like nearby.” The man said.

“That’s not a problem, just not too far.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Then we can head off now, where to?” The man was direct after receiving a handsome tip.

“Firmament.” Li Qiye said.

“... What do you want to do there?” The man had a bad feeling about this.

“Nothing, just going to meet someone.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s fine, you go do that.” The man said without any interest.

“Not a problem at all.” Li Qiye nodded.

The two of them left the tavern and were greeted by the rest.

“We’re going to Firmament.” Li Qiye said.

The man raised his hand and the tavern turned smaller, leaping onto his back like a backpack.

“That’s neat.” Li Zhitian commented, wondering about the tavern. Was it a treasure with a sentient spirit? That would explain the automatic drinks and food.

“Off we go.” Li Qiye started the journey with a new member.

Firmament was an ancient fortress city in Lesser Firmament. Its population consisted of countless cultivators and mortals, enjoying the descending radiance.

The group entered and saw how prosperous and live it was.

“I’m gonna find an open plot to open the tavern. Come let me know when you want to leave Firmament.” The man didn’t want to be around Li Qiye and left without permission.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t try to stop him.

“What a strange fella.” Li Zhitian stared at his departing figure and said softly: “I feel like he’s suffering from some dissociative disorder.”

Li Qiye only chuckled while the old servant responded: “He would be a matchless existence if he has his memories.”

“Why did he forget?” Li Zhitian became curious.

He saw many interesting figures in the dream. However, only this man appeared in the outside world and most importantly, he was absolutely real.

Alas, Li Qiye didn’t wish to divulge while the old servant didn’t know the answer. Nonetheless, he knew that there were great secrets behind this.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, let’s go find someone.” Li Qiye said, aiming to find the younger brother of the tavern owner.

This was easier said than done given the scale of the city. Of course, this wasn’t hard for Li Qiye.

They came across a field with many devout worshippers on their knees. A young man sat at the top, surrounded by celestial radiance.

Three thousand worlds bowed in reverence and even the gods would greet him respectfully. Strangely enough, he was not an accomplished cultivator such as a dao lord or conqueror.

There was just something about the youth’s aura that was transcending. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call him an immortal visiting the lower realm.

His extraordinary nature was evident at first glance - an immortal among the mortal world.
