Chapter 5689: We Do Not Wish To Fight

“Momentous Frontier has an immortal weapon. As long as it is around, the place is indestructible. Celestial Court can’t take it down.” An ancestor murmured.

“You’re right.” Another said.

The survivors talked to those nearby and maintained optimism. This was the last sliver of hope they had left.

Dao Domain had fallen, and one imperial lineage after another couldn’t escape destruction. Even the behemoth known as West Bank went down despite having survived for eras.

Six-finger, Skysplitter, Jadesword Conqueror... these great cultivators fell in battle. The undying War God Dao Lord lost his dao fruits as well, culminating in death.

Anyone who had the power to resist Celestial Court was now dead. Luminous and West Bank Prime Emperor had no choice but to flee to Momentous Frontier.

These two were the pillars of hope for the survivors. As long as they were still around, they would be able to unite powerful members and seize Dao Domain for The People again. Thus, they resorted to prayers.

“Fellow Daoists, please listen.” War Ancient God’s voice echoed inside Momentous Frontier like a gigantic bell.

Mortals trembled as if they were listening to an immortal.

“Celestial Court does not wish to antagonize Momentous Frontier.” He said: “The region is a haven for countless mortals, a true paradise, and Celestial Court has nothing but good wishes.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone heard him clearly, whether it be his armies, the mortals in Momentous Frontier, or the survivors of Dao Domain.

However, no deity appeared to answer him.

“Let the conflicts of the cultivation world be separated from Momentous Frontier. We will not step inside out of reverence for the deities’ selfless goals.” He continued.

Many found his tone and logic agreeable. Momeous Frontier had never participated in worldly affairs, not welcoming any imperial-level cultivator. The neutrality was for the sake of protecting the mortals and their paradise.

They had no relationship with either Immortal Dao City or Celestial Court. The only goal was to protect its population of mortals so what would their next step be?

“Will Momentous Frontier protect West Bank Prime Emperor and Luminous Conqueror?” This became the key question for the survivors.

War Ancient God had announced their stance - respecting Momentous Frontier’s neutrality. Given his status and influence, his words should be taken as truth.

If Momentous Frontier were to refuse haven for the duo, they would have to face the wrath of the armies while being so weakened.

“As I have said, Celestial Court will not interfere with Momentous Frontier’s grand ambition. However, this is based on the premise that you will not participate in any conflict belonging to the cultivation world, always maintaining a state of neutrality. We will not violate the entry rules but please hand over our enemies. Think about the greater good instead.” War repeated.

The deities still didn’t respond while the survivors wondered about their answer.

“Perhaps it is better that they remain neutral.” An ancestor said.

“But that means handing over Luminous Conqueror and West Bank Prime Emperor.” An expert nearby murmured.

“Of course, being neutral means helping neither side, not The People or the Race, not Immortal Dao City or Celestial Court.” The ancestor responded.

“But that would spell the end of Dao Domain and The People’s presence in this region. What’s the point of being neutral then when only Celestial Court reigns supreme.” Someone else disagreed.

“Right, West Bank Prime Emperor and Luminous Conqueror sacrificed everything for The People. Look at the casualties thus far, they deserve to live. Chasing them away is ludicrous.” A younger expert said with indignation.

“Why can’t Momentous Frontier do the littlest thing, just protect them? If The People is wiped out, then what’s the point? The world will belong to The Race alone.” A young genius couldn’t help but blurt.

“That has nothing to do with Momentous Frontier, they’re not on our side. In actuality, most deities came from Eight Desolaces, so it is fine if they choose to not protect us. This is not their responsibility.” The ancestor responded.

“While that might be true, if Celestial Court takes over fully, they will be next.” Someone else shifted the argument.

“Exactly, and mortals have nothing to do with us. When we go down, so will they in due time.” A big shot said.

The majority held the belief that Momentous Frontier should protect them. Why would they view mortals - mere insects - with higher importance?

The land was blessed by the high heaven and possessed enough power to change the dire situation. In the survivors’ opinion, as long as the emperors were still around, they could one day seize and protect this land. Mortals would benefit from this in the future.

“It’s a matter of principle, they have to help The People right now.” Another asserted.
