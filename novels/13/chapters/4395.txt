Chapter 4396: Impressive Might

The frightening Omniscient Eye could render others unconscious even if they weren’t the primary target. Only the strong standing from a safe distance was lucky enough to escape.

This wasn’t the case for Jian Qingzhu despite her two powerful barriers. She was forced out of her hiding spot and started falling down.

At this crucial moment, her saber suddenly turned into countless feathers and wrapped around her like a cocoon.

“Seal!” Celestial Tiger tossed out a treasure net in order to capture the cocoon.

It pushed the cocoon down on the ground and fully sealed it. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Dragoncatcher Net!” A member of Dragon immediately recognized the treasure.

This was a high heaven-level treasure left behind by a top sovereign of Tiger Pond. Escaping once caught would be a difficult task. It seemed that this battle was over with Qingzhu’s defeat.

The crowd exchanged glances and started reflecting on the result.

“The Omniscient Eye is indeed unbeatable.” An outsider said emotionally.

Jian Qingzhu’s saber dao was absolutely fantastic. It easily defeated Celestial Tiger’s spear dao and proved her superiority in terms of dao comprehension.

However, he had a special bone that qualified him to learn a secret dao lord law. This was enough to guarantee his victory.

Those who saw the power of a secret law for the first time became stunned. The dao lords were still unfathomable existences, and so were their techniques.

“First Brother’s eye is enough for him to make a name for himself, no wonder why he defeated the geniuses in Eastern Desolace.” One disciple said softly.

“I don’t think anyone among the young generation can beat this technique.” An older disciple added, aware of their next successor.

It seemed that Celestial Tiger had firmly grasped the successor spot after defeating Jian Qingzhu. No one else could change this.

Some spectators eventually woke up and looked around, realizing that they needed to be farther away. Staring at him left them frightened because of that eye technique. They were completely helpless before it.

Celestial Tiger had all the momentum right now. His spear pulsed brightly in an intimidating manner.

“Your turn.” He glared at Li Qiye, prompting the crowd to stare at him with bated breath.

“This will be over soon.” A member of Dragon quietly said: “It’s time to end this sect master, he has brought too much trouble to our sect. Cutting off his head isn’t unreasonable.”

“We don’t know who will win yet.” Another responded.

“What do you mean? First Brother will win for sure, how can that guy compare to First Brother?” A supporter disagreed right away.

“Not necessarily, Li Qiye defeated Bear King before, also a sovereign.” A senior sister was slightly worried.

“I heard he obtained an amazing artifact in Myriad Sect Mountain, not sure if this is true or not.” A senior brother felt the same way.

Li Qiye glanced at the challenger and smiled: “Go for it if you wish.”

“It’s best if you just surrender and save everyone’s time.” Celestial Tiger uttered coldly.

“You’re quite confident.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Of course.” Celestial Tiger said fiercely: “Be obedient and you won’t suffer needless injuries.”

“Is that so? Hmm, have you ever thought about how you would die? I’m a merciful person and will let you pick.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“You!” Celestial Tiger turned red after hearing this.

“Ridiculous! Show him the might of our sect, First Brother!” One listener was furious.

“That’s right, teach him a lesson!” Others from Dragon chimed in.

Celestial Tiger currently represented the young generation of Dragon. Thus, Li Qiye’s arrogance was unacceptable to the crowd.

Li Qiye stretched and yawned: “I’ve heard these lines so many times already. Space Dragon Emperor left behind a legacy for a bunch of idiots. It seems like the proverb is right, quantity does not trump quality.”

“Fool, you deserve clan extermination for this comment!” Celestial Tiger’s eyes brimmed with murderous intent.

No one enjoyed criticisms about their sect from outsiders, especially a behemoth like Dragon.

“Go, my patience grows thin.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Die!” The furious youth released a dragon with a spear thrust. The sheer power and bloodlust made others shudder.

“Raa!” The dragon left behind deep trails and cracks on the ground along its path. It only took the blink of an eye for Celestial Dragon to appear in front of Li Qiye.

Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at the attack and simply flicked the spear, changing its direction.

Celestial Tiger’s hands were numb from the vibration stemming from the flick. He nearly dropped the spear as a result.

“Whoosh!” Li Qiye grabbed the spear and pulled hard, seizing the spear from his opponent.

He then thrust the spear straight at Celestial Tiger’s chest. It traveled like a venomous serpent lunging at its prey.

Celestial Tiger reacted quickly and performed a movement step to cross through space. He dodged a fatal blow but it still tore his robe and left behind a flesh wound.

Alas, his mental state was affected as he became drenched in cold sweat. He couldn’t stop Li Qiye from taking his spear away and nearly killing him with it.
