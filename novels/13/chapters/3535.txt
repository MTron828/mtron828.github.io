Chapter 3536: Old Information

Ascension was a serious topic, or at least this was the case for juniors like Shi Qingjian and Ye Yaoling right now.

In fact, they were very curious about it. For millions of years, dao lords after finishing their cultivation would go up to the sky and disappear.

The question for regular cultivators became - what kind of world was up there?

Unfortunately, the answer eluded them because dao lords never came back again or sent down messages. That’s why they could only speculate.

“No rush.” Li Qiye smiled and told the basilisk: “I’ll do it when the time is right.”

The basilisk didn’t know when the time was right. However, he was sure that he would be able to witness another incredible ascension from Li Qiye - the second one as far as he knows.

He hesitated for a moment before sighing with envy: “Ascension is the lifelong pursuit of many.”

This was the reason why people wanted to become a dao lord. It was so that they could see the legendary world above. Unfortunately, those who weren’t dao lords would find going up there prohibitively difficult.

Of course, there were exceptions. For example, Space Dragon Emperor made it up there.

“It’s not impossible for you to go up there.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Boss, you want to take me up there?” The basilisk became happy and hurriedly responded; its eyes brightened with eagerness.

During Li Qiye’s coronation, he didn’t go up alone but also brought thousands of people with him. This became one of the greatest legends in the nine worlds. No one has ever been able to surpass this.

“The crux of the issue is that you don’t want to go up. If you did, you wouldn’t be waiting till today.” Li Qiye said.

The basilisk opened his mouth but decided to reflect on this quietly. Back then, his cultivation was weak. Even if Li Qiye had allowed him entry, he wouldn’t have chosen to go up because he would only be holding Li Qiye back. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Today, he was a supreme ancestor. It was no problem going up there. Alas, actually doing it made him hesitate.

“Looks like you can’t go.” Li Qiye could read his mind.

“Maybe I’m too old now, can’t deal with the trouble or my heart is too soft. There are too many things to worry about.” The basilisk shook his head.

It was perfectly fine to ascend with Li Qiye’s protection but what about his race and descendants? Their race and Dragon Phoenix Valley would lose a strong backing.

“I’ve promised Big Sis to take care of them, looks like I can’t go.” He let out a bitter smile.

Venerable Basilisk was even more talented than him. She eventually became the matriarch of the valley but ended up dying before him.

During her last moments, she told him to protect the valley. That’s why no one dared to do anything to the valley in the past.

“Let the children carve out their own path. Otherwise, they’ll be your shackles and chains.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand.” The basilisk said: “I suppose I only said it so easily because I knew I wouldn’t go.”

He was similar to Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang in this regard. They were their sect’s protector but to put it in a different perspective, they were prisoners.

“Rise and fall are normal and inevitable, nothing lasts forever, the same with sects. If your descendants are incapable, just leave them alone. Each person will live differently.” Li Qiye smiled.

“For old people like us, maybe dying is the best result. We come into this world without worries and will leave without any as well.” The basilisk reflected. He suddenly thought that his sister’s death might be a good end for her. She no longer needed to worry about their race and descendants.

“As one grows older, they’ll usually become more emotionless.” Li Qiye said.

“What about you? Can you let go?” The basilisk said.

“I have never been shackled or stopped for anyone. The dao path is still ahead and I’ll keep walking forward.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“True, I lack this mentality. That’s why you’re the boss.” The basilisk fell into silence for a bit before speaking.

“No need to force it. Do what you wish.” Li Qiye said.

The basilisk knew that on the path of the dao, a single thought could change one’s fate and their sect’s fate.

The two of them chatted for a bit while the two girls politely listened.

“Princess showed up once.” The basilisk eventually brought this up.

Numerous shocking things have happened in Li Qiye’s absence but the basilisk didn’t talk about them. However, this made him put on a serious expression.

The girls became curious due to their ancestor’s appearance. Who was this princess?

“I know, sounds about right.” Li Qiye stared at the horizon; his mind drifted back into the past.

“She brought someone with her. Very few knew about this.” The basilisk added.

“A helper is necessary indeed.” Li Qiye eventually responded.

The basilisk knew that in order to be chosen, this helper was extremely capable and worthy of trust.

“Are you not worried at all, Boss?” However, he found Li Qiye’s aloof expression surprising.

“Why should I? A child can’t be a dog with a tiger for a father. Plus, there’s nothing they can’t do in Eight Desolaces.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“You’re right, Boss, I worried for nothing.” The basilisk put on a smile after realizing this. Li Qiye was right not to worry. Plus, the princess was there too. Nothing in Eight Desolaces could trouble them.

To put it bluntly, one word from her alone would summon numerous supreme masters to protect them.

Li Qiye’s prestige and supremacy as the dark crow remained in Eight Desolaces. His invisible hand was still here to grasp the world.

“The burial grounds are gone now.” The basilisk reported.

“Right, now that’s a surprising matter. Even the heaven can’t control everything perfectly.” Li Qiye said softly.

“What is your opinion on this?” The basilisk said.

During the great disaster, the top masters and sects only worried about their own survival. They had no time to care about other matters.

A long time after the event, they found that certain things have vanished into thin air.
