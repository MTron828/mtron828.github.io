Chapter 4872: Divine Dragon Mountain’s Bloodline

“This is just the nature of the dao path, many people and things will disperse like smoke.” Li Qiye said.

“How do you know all of this, Your Highness?” The dragon god asked.

“It’s rather obvious.” Li Qiye smiled.

The dragon god took a deep breath and knew that this wasn’t the truth. Even the dao lord didn’t know his true origin.

He stared at Li Qiye and speculated various possibilities. This “ordinary” cultivator could see through his bloodline despite his cultivation realm. This didn’t make any sense.

“My bloodline is hidden.” He said.

A few might be able to recognize his faint draconic background. However, this wasn’t enough to conclude that he came from Divine Dragon Mountain.

“Of course, your faction isn’t the only one with draconic bloodline. However, yours is different since it has been refined in the stone grotto, not the same as dragons from Demon Lineage.”

“Is there anything you don’t know?!” The dragon god was astounded.

The stone grotto was the oldest secret of their sect. Alas, it was no longer around. Not to mention him, even his ancestors never had the chance to visit it.

Rumor has it that this grotto was once the home to incredible existences with the purest bloodline. Alas, the epoch battle pulled their sect and its experts down.

Divine Dragon Mountain ceased to exist afterward. Its descendants lost their homes and only barely managed to survive in the lower three continents. This was the reason why he was only a sectional leader of a weak sect.

Their secrets became lost with time, especially the matter of the stone grotto. He didn’t even tell his benefactor, Eight-stallion Dao Lord.

“Who are you?” He thought that he was seeing an omniscient ghost.

“I’m just a passerby.” Li Qiye smiled.

“The stone grotto is a relic of the past after the death of our six ancestors, completely forgotten. How do you know about it?” The dragon god remained skeptical about Li Qiye’s identity.

“Others don’t, I do.” Li Qiye smiled.

Nonetheless, he was an experienced cultivator and calmed down after taking a deep breath.

“Your Highness, it seems like your true origin is unfathomable.” The dragon god said.

This finally made sense. The reason why the dao lord didn’t pass the throne down to him or Northern Monarch was because this outsider far surpassed them.

“You absolutely deserve the throne.” He added, completely changing his view on the matter.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

A while ago, he supported Li Qiye to pay the dao lord back. Now, it seemed that his new king was worthy of his service.

“I apologize for my rudeness.” He then bowed deeply.

“It is not your fault that you didn’t know.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Your Highness, what should we do then?” The dragon god sat down and asked.

“Since I have accepted your dao lord’s request, I am reasonable enough to carry out his wish. Plus, this place seems interesting enough so I’ll sit on this throne for a bit.” Li Qiye smiled.

The dragon god smiled wryly. Eight-stallion was absolutely a top dog in the lower continents. Alas, Li Qiye didn’t seem to think much of this highly-coveted position.

“Just pick a good day for the coronation.” Li Qiye said.

“Well…” The dragon god hesitated.

“No?” Li Qiye stared at him.

“A coronation is necessary but it’s just that the timing is bad for one.” The dragon god smiled wryly: “His Majesty has just passed away and the dynasty is being observed by enemies. Not to mention internal problems, Wild Dynasty will not miss the chance to cause trouble at a coronation ceremony. The biggest problem is Wild Dragon, no one can stop him. Other villains joining in will only make it harder.”

He continued: “It’s best to stabilize internally to reach solidarity before announcing a grand ceremony.”

“No need, this is just wasting time. If it’s going to be exciting, let it. I want to invite all the troublemakers.” Li Qiye shook his head: “It’s a rare opportunity for us as well, capturing all our friends at the same time.”

The dragon god didn’t respond. He knew that a full invasion during the coronation might result in the destruction of Eight-stallion.

Li Qiye knew this but he still had absolute confidence. The dragon god wondered what was the source of this confidence.

“Go arrange it, I’m sure it is not difficult.” Li Qiye ordered.

“If this is your will, Your Highness, it shall be done.” The dragon god took a deep breath and agreed.

Once he was gone, Firerage finally relaxed and came inside.

“Your Highness, what did he say?” He worried that the dragon god might have threatened Li Qiye.

“That he’ll prepare the banquet.” Li Qiye smiled.

“No other demands?” Firerage thought that he might set Li Qiye up as a puppet.

“No, he’ll just carry out his duty.” Li Qiye smiled.

Firerage felt much better, albeit still confused. How did Li Qiye get the dragon god to cooperate?
