“So what? I’ll kill your progenitor even if he is here in person.” Li Qiye raised his brow and claimed without any hesitation.

Mu Shaochen’s expression changed into something fierce as he uttered: “No mercy for those who dare to insult my progenitor!”

“Clank!” The gigantic figure instantly took action, combining the arts of the sword and saber into an annihilative judgment. This dual-slash seemed capable of splitting Moneyfall into two halves.

“Get back!” The world returned to chaos to the dismay of the spectators.

Before the slash finished its trajectory, the sharp intents of these weapons assaulted the world.

Weaker cultivators turned to blood instantly. The ancestors nearby had to protect their juniors and retreated.

Li Qiye smiled and said: “You may now witness a true sword dao.”

He spread his palm and raised a tomb without a tablet, only a pinned sword. The entire thing was carved with numerous sword runes.

“Clank.” The tomb opened and out came a peerless sword intent, causing the world to quake. It was as if Sword Saint himself was back; three thousand worlds seemed insignificant before this sword intent.

“Clank!” The reflection of the blade engulfed the area like a fan and easily stopped the dual-slash.

“A Sword Tomb! You, you found one!” Mu Shaochen was astounded.

“That’s right.” Li Qiye smiled: “You only stared at a distance and saw a little bit of its dao.”

Shaochen’s expression became ugly. He also entered that dangerous ground but couldn’t take away the tomb itself, only able to discern some of its dao.

This tomb was the masterpiece of Sword Saint so he naturally knew of its awesome power.

The spectators were shocked. This was the core of Sword Grave, capable of changing size at will and contained the knowledge of Sword Saint.

For some reason, it flew away in the past and heralded the decline of the Ling.

“Sword Tomb...” Tears filled Ling Ximo’s eyes. The thing she dreamed of was before her. It could revitalize her clan.

Shaochen couldn’t obtain the tomb but Li Qiye could, so in this split second, he felt danger.

“Boom!” The majestic figure exuded a mighty force. The mirror in front of his chest unleashed a beam of light across this land, aiming straight for the sword tomb.

Li Qiye wasn’t controlling it. The tomb itself had its own sentience and retaliated with an endless glint of the sword without holding back.

“Boom!” The two beams collided, making the ground and the stars quake. Everyone was scared out of their mind.

“What else do you got?” Li Qiye freely smiled, not paying too much attention.

“Li Qiye, you won’t be laughing for long!” Ironbanner True God and the ancestor from Vermillion attacked.

Ironbanner didn’t waste time and waved his large banner, seemingly sweeping in the entire sky. Several peaks collapsed as a result. The first attack from this ninth-level Ascender was surely impressive.

The ancestor from Vermillion was no slouch either. “Raaa!”

With a loud roar, he chose Lightning Leo as his first move. A flood of lightning with this beast inside lunged forward. Everything felt like paper before its sharp claws.

They knew just how terrifying this foe was so the first move was their very best, not giving Li Qiye an opportunity to resist. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Boom!” Li Qiye simply raised his palm. Numerous worlds and universe were created.

He then slammed his palm down without using any technique, only pure destruction.

“Ooo-” The leo got smashed into pieces; all the lightning bolts instantly disintegrated.

“Crack!” The banner of the other true god was torn apart!

Just one palm strike overwhelmed and dazed the other two combatants. They wished to leave the battlefield with haste, but it was too late.

“Boom!” Li Qiye made a fist. This punch exceeded the temporal limit.

One could be as agile as possible and still couldn’t escape. The strongest defense couldn’t hold up. Nevertheless, they still used their strongest defensive measure.

“Boom! Boom!” The punch pierced through their chest, causing blood to fly everywhere.

The two of them fell on their back with their eyes wide open, not expecting to lose to a single punch.

“...” Shaochen, appalled, began to retreat.

“Clank!” The sword tomb seemed to be unhappy at how effortless Li Qiye defeated his foes. It emitted brighter brilliance before opening completely. The sword pinned on the tomb flew out like a soaring immortal.

No one could stop this supreme sword with its sharp intent.

The majestic figure slashed continuously with its saber and sword to no avail. The two weapons crumbled, unable to stop the soaring sword.

Next, it pierced through the defensive mirror then the figure itself, leaving a gaping hole.

“Boom!” Shaochen’s formation was destroyed and the figure exploded.

This sword paused in the sky then performed a sweeping motion.

“Ah!” Screams of terror haunted the listeners. Rain of blood and decapitated heads began falling down.

The thousands of experts from the various systems were massacred since no one could dodge the horizontal slash. This particular move was the embodiment of death. The sword then returned to the tomb.

People finally realized how mighty this sword left behind by Sword Saint was. No wonder so many years after his departure, the tomb could still fly back to Moneyfall and suppress Ghosthand Ground.

“It’s time to return it to the descendants of Sword Saint.” Li Qiye waved at the tomb and smiled.

“Buzz.” It flew out and landed before Ling Ximo.

She stood there unmovingly for a long period before regaining her wits and reaching forward.

The tomb shrank in size and landed on her trembling hands. She held it tightly - the dream and hope of their clan.

“I heard you have a Paragon Artifact, show me.” Li Qiye seemed to be in a good mood despite the gruesome scene of corpses and the terrible stench of blood.

In fact, he was even scarier than the carnage. People found him to be a devil from hell; just one wave of this monster’s hand could destroy the ages.

As Li Qiye slowly walked closer, Shaochen could sense death.
