After the hearty guffaw, the demon king glared and said: “Very well, a duel to the death. If I were to die and unable to avenge my son, then it would only be my fault for being weak.”

“Good, as you wish then.” Li Qiye smiled. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The members of Divine Black stared at those nearby. This battle was ridiculous in their eyes.

“Is this possible?” One asked.

It’s not that they looked down on Li Qiye. On the contrary, no one dared to do so by this point. It’s just that the power gap was insane.

Li Qiye did the impossible by defeating Zhan Hu and Huang Ning with his Tortoise Fist. This didn’t seem to be on the same level.

“He must have something else up his sleeve, right?” Another murmured.

An air of skepticism and doubt permeated the crowd. They thought that Li Qiye could have ten thousand different methods and it still wouldn’t be enough to make up the gap.

“This might become the biggest miracle in Divine Black, no, in all of the cultivation world. People will sing songs about it years after.” A few protectors and elders were full of anticipation.

They wanted Li Qiye to win just to see a miracle. They had nothing against the demon king nor any personal vendetta.

Just imagine, a Bronze Tendon disciple managing to beat a myriad-form expert. This would definitely become a legend regardless of the process.

“Don’t regret this now since I will kill you.” The demon king suddenly became more open-minded than before.

“There’s nothing to regret. Come.” Li Qiye gestured with his hand, not giving a damn.

“Good! Since you are being so straightforward, let’s do this. If you were to lose, I will deliver a swift death. If I lose, then this is the end of our feud. The tiger clan will not seek you out for more trouble.” The demon king loudly declared.

Li Qiye simply shrugged in response. However, the top members of Divine Black heaved a sigh of relief.

In a way, this comment would solve the problem with the tiger clan and the other demons. It would end with this duel.

“I’ll give you the chance to make your move first.” The demon king said.

“No, you may go first since you won’t have the chance if I were to start, no chance to avenge your son in that case.” Li Qiye refused.

“So conceited! I actually like this part of you!” The demon king’s anger seemed no longer there since a conclusion was in sight: “Let’s see what you can do.”

His vitality and chaos true energy erupted with a touch of grand dao power.

“Rumble!” His already-massive frame became larger. It pulsed with waves of divine light, ready to reach the next level.

“The grand level.” An expert became startled.

Everyone knew that he was a myriad-form cultivator. Now, he revealed himself to be at the grand level of this realm.

“Boom!” The demon king raised his tail high enough to flip the sky vault over. The celestials would need to give it space.

Nine stars appeared on it, looking like treasure drills. They were shiny and majestic, containing boundless strength.

The tail alone was strong enough but with the addition of these stars, it became suffocating and several times stronger.

“Nine Star Iron Tail, a killing move.” An elder knew about its power.

“I see...” Many murmured at this revelation.

“The demon king used this move to beat eight experts from Three Truths at once.” An older elder revealed.

The might of this move suppressed all the junior disciples. They watched carefully, wondering what Li Qiye would do to withstand it.

“Junior, are you ready?” The demon king didn’t attack right away and asked first.

He chose a fair duel and wanted to give Li Qiye ample time to prepare.

“I’m ready.” Li Qiye shrugged while just standing there.

The crowd’s eyes grew bigger from astonishment. Li Qiye didn’t look ready in the slightest while standing on stage.

“Fine, let’s see what you got!” The demon king didn’t like this either and slammed his tail downward.

“Rumble!” The nine stars on the tail released loud explosions and flew straight for Li Qiye.

They looked like nine meteors with the power to destroy the world.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” They smashed and instantly destroyed the stage.

“Boom!” This wasn’t the end either because the tail swipe came afterward, dragging the sky with its momentum.

Heaven fell and the earth crumbled. Mud and debris splashed everywhere. The stage disappeared from sight, replaced by a crater dozens of meters deep.

Some spectators audibly gasped after seeing this. No one on stage could have survived.

“It’s over.” One of them murmured.

“No defense can stop this.” One protector took a deep breath.

“It’ll end like this?” An elder focused his gaze.

This ending would be too disappointing. It had nothing to do with the demon king being too strong, just Li Qiye overestimating himself.

The demon king himself stared at the destroyed stage and suddenly felt something.

More detonations came without warning along with earthquakes as if a divine bull was turning its body.

Something large underground was awakening and everyone could feel its endless power. A source down there has been open and the grand dao power within surged out with unstoppable momentum.

“What the hell is this?!” The crowd became startled.
