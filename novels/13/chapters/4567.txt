Chapter 4568: Pioneer Ancestor

Everlasting Monarch was one of the greatest ancient ancestors in True Immortal’s history. His influence remained despite dying a long time ago.

The descendants had nothing but respect and love for him. Alas, they had no choice but to rob him today. This was both unfilial and irreverent. Unfortunately, they still made this decision since the scented pouch was too important.

They accepted the infamy stemming from this decision - a sign of how important the item was to their sect.

Decapitation Godmonarch, Seven-seal True God, Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor, and the rest of the experts from True Immortal readied their weapons, looking rather aggressive.

“Clank!” As the godmonarch slowly unsheathed his saber, the friction noise was actually pleasant to the ears.

Rumor has it that Decapitation Godmonarch’s saber needed to taste blood before returning to its scabbard.

Once it was fully exposed, it exuded frightening saber rays capable of piercing deep into the bone marrows.

He then held the saber with both hands. Spectators felt as if the next slash would be unstoppable. None would be able to evade it.

Though he didn’t aim it at any member of the crowd, they still felt their scalp tingling and hurting as if they have been lacerated.

Seven-seal True God also released seven seals. They then turned into seven gigantic gods with supreme dao laws pouring downward like waterfalls. They surrounded Everlasting Monarch in order to suppress his power while displaying their suppressive supremacy to the crowd.

Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor joined as well, performing a full seal on the bridge. This made everyone feel as if they were ants being crushed by an invincible boulder, unable to move an inch. He could obliterate the entire crowd with a single thought.

While most had difficulties breathing and standing, one expert took a deep breath and said: “Is this force enough to stop Everlasting Monarch?”

“I don’t think so.” An ancient big shot observed the situation and then answered: “This is Everlasting Monarch we’re talking about. He had taught dao lords before, need I say more?”

No one refuted this statement. In fact, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to consider him an eighth dao lord from True Immortal.

Everyone knew that the incoming battle would be brilliant. However, they were also smart enough to gradually back away from the bridge in order to avoid injuries.

During the calm before the storm, someone else walked out of the cemetery. Of course, no one paid attention to this corpse outside of a selected few.

“Pioneer Ancestor!” Wise Ancestor has been paying attention to the cemetery the entire time. He didn’t care about True Immortal and Everlasting Monarch; his goal was to wait for the Yu’s ancestor. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes!” Jian Ming and the daoist looked over in that direction as well.

Sure enough, a shabbily-dressed old man walked toward the bridge. His clothes had a hard time hiding his muscular frame. It was as if he was carved from an extremely tough boulder. This toughness meant that he could break and excavate anything, hence his title.

“Look, it’s the Lu's dao stone!” Jian Ming noticed something first.

Pioneer Ancestor wore a chain with a pendant. This pendant was none other than the Lu’s dao stone wrapped around by divine metal.

Though he was dead, he still wanted to wear this pendant through the bridge. He must have loved it when he was still alive.

In reality, the dao stone itself was useless to him. After all, it belonged to the four clans and it needed the other three dao stones to be useful.

However, it carried sentimental value because his wife treasured it more than anything. Because of this, he wanted to take it along to the next life so that he would remember his love for her.

“Let’s do this.” Jian Ming pulled up his sleeves.

The group paid no attention to the battle between True Immortal and Everlasting Monarch. The dao stone was of pivotal importance since it could revitalize the four clans.

“This will be hard.” Wise had a serious expression: “Pioneer Ancestor had another title during his golden years, the King of Thieves. He went as far as stealing from the behemoths. His actual power is comparable to any ancient ancestor.”
