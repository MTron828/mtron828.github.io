While everyone was raving about the current events, Li Qiye and Su Yonghuang returned to the True Martial Island. His triumphant return was within Dantai Ruonan’s expectations.

Ruonan smiled and said: “It is one thing if you don’t do anything, but once you do, it will be earth-shattering, Young Master.”

She wasn’t surprised at all about the massacre since she was aware that characters like Zhentian were no big deal to her Young Master; they weren’t worth mentioning.

“Mere child’s play.” Li Qiye revealed a carefree smile: “If Emperor Assailants don’t join in, it can’t even be considered a warm-up. Forget about going all out.”

People would be scared silly if they were to hear this conversation. Massacring Zhentian’s level of character was only child’s play? Then what would going all out look like?

Ruonan joked: “In terms of real assailants, Heaven Spirit actually has three or five. I’m afraid these people have more or less heard about your stories. If you are here, they won’t dare to show their faces even if they were ten times more courageous. As for the other Emperor Assailants, they are merely in title.”

For the world, to be able to fight against an emperor for one to two hundred moves was enough to be considered an Emperor Assailant — this was already invincible enough. The other Godkings wouldn’t be able to contend against this level of opponent.

However, for Li Qiye and Ruonan, they had a different definition for an Emperor Assailant, a much higher standard.

“The Roaring Conch can recruit someone.” Li Qiye smiled casually: “However, it’s no big deal. The sooner they come, the faster we can deal with it. I actually want to slaughter them all, so it won’t be too bad.” Having said that, he stared at the Divine Tree Ridge in the distance.

He was very frivolous with his comment. Ruonan understood that he didn’t really care about them.

She gently asked: “Is there something else troubling you?”

As a long-time confidant, she understood him more than anyone else. Ordinary matters wouldn’t trouble him like this.

Li Qiye eventually laughed and answered: “I had a few aces that I couldn’t use so I’m a bit down.”

“You were waiting for even more shocking characters to come out?” She looked at the ridge in the distance and asked while standing side by side next to him.

He explained: “The remaining ones are no big deal, they can’t reach the apex. I’ll flatten them if they come. I was talking about the ridge, but it looks like that won’t happen. I entered the inner world and took a few things as well as the nine leaves, but the place is still calm.”

Ruonan mused: “Maybe it is in awe of your reputation.”

Li Qiye chuckled and shook his head: “Perhaps, perhaps not. Even though I have played with the Bonesea and the ridge a couple of times already, it isn’t that easy to force them into submission. I came this time with this goal in mind, but they remained silent.”

“They are simply recharging and do not want to fight against you under these circumstances.” Ruonan was aware of the undercurrent.

“Right, this makes it even more clear that the great disaster is approaching.”

She pondered for a bit before replying: “Did you want to flip over the ridge? Or perhaps a straight sweep to the golden palace itself?” [1]

“No.” Li Qiye elaborated: “I just wanted to talk to the ridge, even more so than the Bonesea.”

“That’s not your style though, Young Master.” She was surprised to hear this response.

He chuckled pleasantly: “Ruonan, you make it sound like I love war so much. I do like fighting and all, but there are times when I can happily sit down and talk as well. If certain things are negotiable, why not negotiate? Plus, there’s no harm even if it doesn’t work out.”

She sniggered after hearing this. After a while, she continued: “You aren’t someone who negotiates with others. Plus, you have fought before already, so if you were actually determined, you would have plowed your way to the palace itself.”

“I wouldn’t care if it was for personal reasons. Declaring war is no problem.” Li Qiye gently sighed: “However, I really wanted to talk this time. I have a good understanding of the ridge, but not as much as the Bonesea. When that day comes, a sea of blood will engulf Heaven Spirit. At that point, maybe the charming spirits, treants, and sea demons will have to face genocide.”

Ruonan softly asked: “Are you worried about me?”

Li Qiye smiled and patted her head: “I have never worried about you before. With your power, even if the disaster was present, you could still leave. However, I know that you won’t, especially not during the disaster.”

She didn’t answer because her Young Master was correct.

“The Ruonan I know has always faced challenges boldly without trepidation.” He laughed sentimentally.

“I feel satisfied to be praised like this.” She revealed a beautiful smile.

Li Qiye wryly smiled in response and shook his head again: “I have left behind a few things, some preparations that can be useful for you in the future. It is a shame that I can’t personally help you pave the way and shoulder the sky.”

“No.” She grabbed his hand and solemnly stared at him: “You have done more than enough for me. Although the world thinks that I am very gifted, I wouldn’t have the same achievements today without you. Plus, I don’t blame you at all, this is my own choice. You have already paved the way for me to the point of removing all obstacles towards the throne. The reality is that I have disappointed you by choosing to stay.”

With that, even a strong woman like her felt a strange melancholy.

A very long time ago after the end of Immortal Emperor Min Ren’s generation, Ruonan had many choices because she had severed her bloodline. She could have left Heaven Spirit for good even.

If she chose to become emperor, she would have become one already. With that, she could follow her Young Master above the nine heavens to the world of emperors and gods.

Alas, she ultimately chose to stay in Heaven Spirit instead. This was the most hopeless choice, the path that her father didn’t want to see. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She went on to say: “Young Master, you don’t owe me anything, it is the opposite. I know that you once hoped for me to become emperor and made sufficient preparations for the day when I embark on that path. I have failed to meet your expectations in that regard.”

Li Qiye helplessly spoke while staring at her: “You really don’t owe me anything, it is just a pity that I couldn’t force you. Like the wise sages back at Dongting Lake, they had many choices as well, such as picking other fertile lands in the nine worlds to be their home. Ultimately, just like you, they chose to stay in Heaven Spirit. This is your choice as was theirs. Even though I could have commanded all of you to do otherwise, that would be going against your own pursuit. This is your beloved home so you want to contribute. You don’t want to see the day when it turns into ashes.” He ended with a sigh.

“It’s not just me.” Ruonan gently replied with melancholy: “After great struggles, many people have chosen this path. Immortal Emperors fought on, treefathers used all of their opportunities, and sea gods continued to compromise! Despite being powerless to an extent, they still tried their best to win a glimmer of hope for this land. My father may not have wanted me to stay here, but as his daughter, I should take up this mantle and try my best, whether it is because of my love for this world, the True Martial Island, or the sea demons. If my father was able to face everything, I will not disgrace his lifelong prestige either.”

1. Just to clarify, I’m not sure if golden palace here is an actual place or if the author just made up a phrase that means sweeping to the end. Going to do it in a more literal manner just to be safe. Maybe the ridge has a golden palace or something for the end boss.
