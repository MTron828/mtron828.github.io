Chapter 4110: Money Talks

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The lake had eighteen well-known islands, the strongest of them being Dak Gale. The entire region was under Dark Gale’s rule.

Thus, in order to stay here safely, one must pay Dark Gale enough money and gain their protection. This granted them immunity from being robbed.

To not do so was quite risky. A few disciples from top sects were cocky and confident in their skill. They entered Dark Gale alone and sure enough, the ending of this story was not pretty.

This precedence has been set for eras now. People came to Dark Gale and paid the fee in order to stay alive. They eventually joined the various bandit camps as well.

As time went on, the region became filled with hidden dragons and crouching tigers. There was no lack of powerful cultivators.

There was another reason for its popularity among both the young and the old. The lake also served as an incredible black market without rules. Stolen items were up for sale without any repercussion. Treasures with dubious origins could still be offloaded.

While using a heavenly gaze, one could see the faint outlines of the islands. Some were hidden in the fog and had different physical features.

One could hear the loud marching of a legion from the horizon. Their banners fluttered with the winds while their treasures illuminated the area.

It consisted of tens of thousands of members, the majority being good-looking women. They didn’t have a uniform either. Some wore plates thin and small enough to still show off their curves. Others chose dresses barely thick enough to hide their white skin. A few chose regal dresses and exuded an air of nobility…

Spectators would be captivated by this group since beauties of all types could be seen here - sexy, cold, heroic…

They rode incredible beasts - auspicious breeds, colorful birds, elephants as large as mountains. Their march included loud explosions and earthquakes.

Each banner had the character “Li” engraved on it using golden strings. This resulted in a blinding radiance, making it hard to stare directly at it.

On top of them were flying creatures - massive blood eagles, cloud serpents, lightning birds…

From a distance, this looked like a supreme lord accompanied by countless fairies.

Everyone became slack-jawed because no one in Sword Continent traveled with this level of luxury and extravagance.

The most shocking thing was still the flying citadel in the center.

“Windrider Draconic Carriage… Isn’t this the most expensive carriage for sale in Archaic Style?” One expert’s mouth was agape.

“Yes, and that citadel is named Cloudriding, the most expensive one in the Li’s auction house. It has been for sale for five thousand years now.” Another recognized the flying city.

“Do you see that radiance? It should be coming from the Immortal Monarch Palanquin, one of the best treasures from Immortal River Kingdom, why is it here?” An older cultivator took note of a wondrous light coming from the city.

“That’s not all, take a closer look at the throne.” An ancestor activated his heavenly gaze and said: “That’s an Auspicious Golden Lion laying next to it. I remember its price, one billion and three hundred million…” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I see a Nine-firmament God Hawk perching on that beam too, over there.” One keen-eyed old man saw a hawk pulsing with a divine radiance. Its eyes were as sharp as swords.

“That floating fish around the throne is a Five-element Fish, it’s extremely strong…” One more ancestor reminded.

“Who is this? Don’t tell me it’s one of the Five Overlords?” A young soul asked.

“No, it’s Li Qiye.” An older ancestor responded.

Once the legion got close enough, they saw the man lazily lying on the throne - Li Qiye.

Countless treasures were embedded on his robe - a divine eye, the eye of a devil dragon, a jade with a luster only seen in an immortal realm…

Each of these treasures exuded immense pressure on the spectators.

“Goddamn, isn’t that the Hallowed Jewel Robe? I think the Nine-wheel City Lord thought about buying it before but gave up due to its outrageous price.” One spectator said.

“They’re all nothing compared to what’s on top of his head…” A sacred lord told the crowd.

They finally turned attention to the space right above him and saw floating dao lord weapons…

Galaxy Shift Truncheon, Five-mountain Hammer, Trigram Fiery Mirror…

Their auras could crush the firmaments and make spectators shudder with fear. Just seeing one in person was difficult and rare enough, let alone so many together in one place.
