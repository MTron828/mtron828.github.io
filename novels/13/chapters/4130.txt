Chapter 4131: Void Wheel

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The tongue spewed noble words but the body remained honest. No one would say no to Li Qiye’s offer regardless of their contempt and distaste towards him.

Plenty of top sects didn’t have a single dao lord weapon. Possessing one meant having a mighty foundation for the future.

As for a single cultivator, they might not be able to utilize the dao lord weapon to its fullest potential for many reasons. There were risks involved in having one as well. Nonetheless, they could offer it to their sect and bask in the incredible rewards - a better position and other resources.

“Are you sure you want to go against me with just that? I don’t want to bully you.” Li Qiye repeated while staring at the princess.

She nearly vomited blood from anger for being looked down upon, akin to a phoenix temporarily fallen and suffering misfortunes.

“One is more than enough to kill you.” She uttered coldly.

“Plenty of bravado but forget it, I feel bad using these weapons against your scrap metal.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The princess turned red, nearly breaking her teeth from gritting too hard.

He recalled his dao lord weapon and clapped his hand once: “Okay, I’m sure you wouldn’t be convinced if I win with them.”

The crowd was astonished. He actually had a chance of winning by using all of those dao lord weapons at the same time. This was absolutely the wrong decision.

“What is he doing?” One expert wondered.

“Now his chance of winning is zero.” An elder added.

They knew that he had strange yet magical methods up his sleeve. However, fighting bare-handed was suicidal.

“Remember, outside of treasures, I have plenty of money, more than enough to smash you to death.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You can have trillions and still won’t be able to touch me.” She snorted.

“Don’t need trillions for someone like you, just thirty million is ample.” Li Qiye rubbed his chin and mused.

Having said that, he summoned thirty million Six Dao Sovereign Refined Jades. They loudly fell on the ground.

Eyes lit up after seeing the large pile of refined jades. Each piece exuded ten-colored radiance, looking like a perfect work of art.

“How is he going to smash her with these jades? Throw them at her one by one?” One youth said skeptically.

He might throw one with all of his strength but that’s not even enough to touch her hair, let alone injure her.

“There is one method…” A high elder thought of one possibility while looking at the pile.

“Is this a joke?” The princess had an annoyed expression.

Given her power, she could withstand blows from powerful weapons, let alone refined jades.

This was akin to a serious battle between two masters yet one suddenly put away their weapon and started throwing bricks. She thought that Li Qiye wasn’t taking this seriously in the slightest.

“This is the first time I’ve heard of this.” One cultivator found this ridiculous.

No one has heard of another cultivator being killed by refined jades before.

“Hmm…” Snowcloud Princess ruminated while observing the situation. She heard of a particular legend from long ago. However, this method was lost with time.

“Sigh, it must have been hard on your sect to train such an idiotic disciple to this level. I should show mercy out of consideration.” Li Qiye shrugged and said.

“I’ve changed my mind, I will let you taste a fate worse than death.” Illusory Princess trembled with rage, wanting to tear off his tendons and drink his blood.

“Make your move while you still can.” Li Qiye said.

“Die!” Her face twisted with anger, no longer looking as gorgeous as before.

The treasure in front of her exuded five different colored lights. “Pop!” The space around it peeled off and started rippling forward.

“Careful, she’s refining space.” An ancestor immediately retreated while telling his juniors.

“That’s the power of an Immortal Sovereign treasure.” Others took a deep breath after seeing space melting down.

This meant that Li Qiye, the main target, would be reduced to nothingness as well.

“Buzz.” The princess herself became ethereal, on the verge of disappearing.

“Pop! Pop! Pop!” Circular wheels with metal teeth on the edge suddenly emanated from her, sharp enough to cut through everything. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This turned her offense into a destructive two-pronged attack. The enemy became trapped due to the refining pressure while also having to deal with these spatial wheels.

“Void Wheel, one of the six.” A high elder took a deep breath.

“Yes, a top art of Nine-wheel Citadel. She is talented enough to cultivate a heavenly scripture.” One genius became surprised.

“Die!” She roared and the area around Li Qiye became an inferno. At the same time, the sharp wheels cut through space, ready to eviscerate all enemies.

At the same time, the treasure had sealed Li Qiye so he couldn’t run away.
