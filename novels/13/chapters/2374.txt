The vibration felt across Moneyfall wasn’t deafening yet everyone could feel it in their heart as if something had just exploded.

The knowledge of something terrifying lurking in the shadows overwhelmed them.

“Imperial Demise!” All gazes turned towards this land.

Even those who didn’t know about Imperial Demise turned their head in the right direction because it was the source of this terrible feeling.

“Indeed.” One ancestor murmured: “Maybe the shadow monster in there has awakened, the thing that killed Regalia Ancestor.”

“Who disturbed it?” The big shots turned pale while trembling.

“That’s suicidal, but I suppose the person already seeks death, that’s the only explanation for entering Imperial Demise.” A sect master replied.

Numerous experts were startled. Though they didn’t know who it was, they thought that this person was insane.

“Boom!” The shadow didn’t speak before unleashing a destructive palm strike. Everything returned to the origin by this power. Time and space became nothingness.

Only a progenitor would be able to stop an attack of this level.

Li Qiye became amused: “You are lost, halt and show me the way to the real Moneyfall!”

He was holding a bubbling eye made of water, obtained from Beastcoin City where the Kui underwent a massive change.

“Buzz.” This circular bubble became resplendent, able to illuminate the entire world and expel all the darkness in this land.

The shadow was turned to wisps of black smoke and sucked in by the bubble. It was scared and wanted to run. However, the two things seemed to be one so this fusion was inevitable.

It didn’t take long before the shadow was completely absorbed and placed in the center of the bubble. Now the eye was finally completed. Just a while ago, it was only a white eyeball without the black pupil.

The eye moved around in Li Qiye’s hand in a creepy manner. He took a look and chuckled: “This is your true form. Lead the way.”

It seemed that the eye could understand him. With a buzzing noise, it turned increasingly bright and started to melt in this blinding radiance.

It took a liquid form and became a lake, but in the center was a mass of darkness. This darkness began a stair-like vortex leading to a deeper part of the lake.

Li Qiye began walking on the steps. “Pop!” Space seemed to be melting as well, becoming one with the water. Finally, no one could distinguish between the two affinities any longer.

Meanwhile, he made it farther and finally disappeared into the darkness.

At the same time, divine beams shot out of Vermillion Martial Court and lit up the entire system, affecting the sky of Myriad Lineage.

An invincible aura emerged as a figure soared to the sky. The existences in Vermillion felt the pressure and got on their knees.

“Dracoform Martial God!” People were rightfully horrified.

“Dracoform Martial God is coming into being!” This shocking news swept through the world.

All systems and powerful ancestors became startled.

This number one expert was virtually peerless in Myriad. He hasn’t appeared in a long time so he was more of a legend now. People would only occasionally brought him up during story-time.

An ancestor murmured: “A storm is coming to Myriad. What is actually worth the martial god coming out?”

“Boom!” Someone broke through the spatial fabric of Moneyfall and instantly made it there.

A majestic aura permeated this area and shocked the crowd.

Cloudcrossing Falcon God had appeared, but he didn’t have the same aura as this one.

People looked up towards the horizon and saw an old man approaching.

He wore a gray robe, lacking the same fanfare as other experts. However, each of his steps made the earth tremble.

He appeared experienced, still stately despite his old age. The first impression was that he was an unstoppable martial artist.

His body was perfect, devoid of unnecessary muscles or fat.

“Dracoform Martial God!” One ancestor shouted.

“He’s here...” The crowd became astonished and filled with dread yet they couldn’t avert their eyes.

Dracoform didn’t need to show off his aura; just each step already garnered enough attention. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Martial God...” Wu Bingning knew what was about to happen. She tried to escape but it was too late.

It looked like he was only walking from the horizon, but once she took action, the next step of his allowed him to appear before her.

To him, ten million miles only took a single step to cross.
