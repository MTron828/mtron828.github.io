Chapter 5748: Right Within The River

“Off we go.” Li Qiye glanced at the river and said.

“Where to this time, Sacred Teacher?” Meru asked.

“Upstream ahead until we reach the source.” Li Qiye pointed.

“Very well, we might be able to reach the source with you around, Sacred Teacher.” Meru swung his oar and the boat surged forward with incredible speed, crossing through one dimension after another.

When standing at the first shore, one had a good idea of the celestial river and a particular direction. However, upon entering, they would be lost right away due to its size. There was no way to find the initial shore, the other side, or the source of the river.

This was the reason why the duck egg buyer’s group lost a dozen emperors, having to give up in the end.

Attempting to cross it with an army meant suffering grievous losses, no longer having the strength to fight Celestial Court’s men in waiting.

Meru, on the other hand, possessed a mighty cultivation and had been here for a long time. As long as Li Qiye gave him a direction, he could hold steady without becoming lost.

In the past, some thought they were clever and had tried to stay on shore while walking in either direction, hoping to find the source one day. This was proven to be a futile endeavor.

Therefore, the conclusion drawn was that one must be on the river itself to reach the source. Staying on the shore meant being unable to grasp its mysteries.

Along the way, Li Qiye changed the direction several times and Meru was able to keep up. Alas, only a vast expanse awaited them. Regardless of Meru’s effort and speed, this wasn’t working.

“Sacred Teacher, the river is boundless.” He said while still maintaining the maximum speed, crossing through dimensions.

“There is an end, we just have to find it.” Li Qiye said.

“Amitabha, perhaps you are the only one who can solve this mystery. I have been here for eras and learned very little.” Meru placed his palms together.

Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “I’m not the only one, Celestial Court found many of the mysteries here, they’re still attempting to research and gain all of the treasure’s powers.”

“Right.” Meru said: “I believe the mysterious guest gave them more information, boosting their mastery drastically. In the past, they couldn’t summon people and the blessings were limited. Do you wish to seize this heavenly treasure, Sacred Teacher?”

“No, only its hidden mysteries, not its powers.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Does the mysterious guest know?” Meru asked.

“There is a balance among the Dao and Bloodline branches in Celestial Court, it allows Human Ancestor to maintain control and grasp the mysteries of Celestial Court.” Li Qiye said.

“There are others too, right? Why don’t they seize it?” Meru asked.

“There is only one treasure, who should it go to? Plus, this is their lair and monopoly is not possible. They don’t want to fight to the death either and most importantly, Trinity Ancestor isn’t fully dead, so they don’t want to reveal themselves.” Li Qiye said.

“I see, so that’s why Human Ancestor can stay in charge.” Meru understood.

The organization behind Celestial Court was rather complex. The world only saw characters such as Hao Hai, Nether, and Sword Emperor. They had no idea of the terrifying cultivators beyond.

Human Ancestor was the true identity of its founder, a step above the imperial-level characters. Then there were the three immortals as well. Beyond them were more powerful cultivators, albeit in hiding.

Meru has been here for a long time and only figured out the bare surface, unable to find more information.

“Stop.” Li Qiye shook his head and said: “Looks like we won’t be able to find the source like this.”

Meru obeyed and smiled wryly: “I’ve been trying for a long time now to no avail.”

Li Qiye glanced downward and palmed a handful of water from the celestial river. The liquid seemed to be made from stars, shimmering brightly. Holding the water felt the same as holding innumerable stars.

His eyes became profound, capable of seeing myriad worlds and penetrating all illusions.

“Here.” Li Qiye looked up and made Meru and Bai Jianzhen feel as if he had seen the entire river.

“It’s within the celestial river itself.” Li Qiye concluded. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The two didn’t understand what he meant and heard a buzzing noise stemming from the water in his hand.

It was already shimmering with starlight before but after his derivation, it transformed into a miniature celestial river.
