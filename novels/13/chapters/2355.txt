Everyone gasped after hearing this fierce challenge and glanced at each other. Some ancestors here had unsightly expression while glaring angrily at her.

Boldly calling them hypocrites and pretenders straight to their face? Nevertheless, she spoke with gusto for Longevity Valley had immense influence. It wasn’t impossible for them to invite a True Emperor from Immortal Lineage.

After all, plenty of emperors and progenitors owed them a favor. If they wanted to go all out, anything was possible.

“Sage, that’s too much.” An ancestor from Vermillion Martial Court spoke: “We have no animosity towards your system, our only target is Li Qiye. It’s just that we’re afraid that the villain might be tricking you and hope that you can reconsider. I’m sure that once he is declared a heretic, the world will rise again him, isn’t that right, Untethered?”

He looked over at Untethered, wishing to drag both Longevity Valley and Yang Radiance down the mud. No one was going to leave this storm unscathed.

All eyes turned towards her now. She sat straight with a natural and noble expression: “If Li Qiye had indeed cultivated the blood art to harm others, he deserves persecution from all sides. It also means that Insane Court has violated the agreement and will become a heretical sect. In that case, my system will be the first to do something about it.”

The crowd heaved a sigh of relief after she revealed her thoughts.

“Did you hear that, Sage?” The ancestor turned back and said: “Will your system still protect him after he is exposed? Would you still wish to fight against the rest of the world?”

The sage powerfully responded: “No point in wondering about hypothetical scenarios. I trust in our disciple, he is not a villain that had cultivated in blood arts. As I have said before, we will guarantee his innocence.”

“I’m afraid that won’t do, if your system still considers him to be your First Disciple, then you are not in a position to act as the guarantor. You need to draw the line.” The untethered said.

“Oh, you wish to trouble me as well?” The sage stared straight at her.

She remained calm: “It’s not anything personal, I’m simply stating the truth. You need to remove him as the First Disciple before acting as an impartial guarantor. Otherwise, a conflict of interest exists and that’s not tolerable for something that could affect our entire world.”

“I agree completely. This event might determine the rise and fall of Myriad, we can’t delay making a decision just because of one system’s self-interest.” Many systems chimed in, wishing to oppose Longevity Valley.

Unlike them, the untethered was simply being impartial without prejudice against the valley and Li Qiye.

“Young Lord Mu is here!” A shout disrupted the debate and made the stars tremble.

“Rumble!” A carriage appeared, crushing the spatial sphere around it while emitting a black aura. The birds pulling the carriage looked quite imposing.

Four Ascenders acted as protectors - quite a frightening display.

Young Lord Mu sat on the carriage, looking imperious and still with a beauty on each side. His arrival attracted both attention and annoyance, especially his seemingly debaucherous nature.

“Hmph, what a show-off.” One scowled. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

On the other hand, ancestors from Coiling Dragon, Sword Grave, and Pure Yang System quickly came to greet him. Though the ancestor from Vermillion didn’t come forward, he still stood up for a greeting.

Only characters like the sage and untethered could remain sitting. Of course, not being overly pandering was one thing; they didn’t wish to offend him either.

The most peculiar thing was how subservient the members of Sword Grave were acting. It looked as if they were greeting their own young lord.

“Why are they like that?” This beckoned the question.

“Right, so respectful towards him.” Some felt that this was exaggerated.

“I heard after coming to Moneyfall, Mu Shaochen found them their lost tomb, wanting to return the lost techniques back to them, a great favor. That’s why they are willing to work for him.” One ancestor quietly said.

“I see, he lives up to his reputation.” People were startled.

Mu Shaochen slowly walked down the carriage with swagger and arrogance.

“Seniors, please excuse my tardiness due to personal business.” Mu Shaochen unapologetically said.

“It’s fine, it’s fine, that villain still isn’t here yet.” The ancestors quickly said.

“Those ancestors are still Ascenders, why do they suck up to the Mu so much?” Some youths didn’t like Mu Shaochen, especially the ones who had a crush on Jewelbanner Princess and the daughter of the Ouyang.

“Benefits.” Their ancestor replied: “Some systems aren’t only doing it for the Mu. Just the young lord’s talents alone are worthy of this. He’s peerless and could understand many things from a single glance. Just take a look, anyone close with him had a great harvest. For example, he found the Jewelbanner’s lost arts just by looking at their tablets. The Ouyang Lady’s cultivation soared after being taught amazing laws by him. That’s why these systems want to rely on his talents in order to regain their lost techniques.”

He paused and sighed before continuing: “Such talents would bring about greatness. Look at Sword Grave, they do it so willingly after he found the tomb and the sword dao within for them. It’s just too much temptation.”

The ancestor from Sword Grave personally brought out a royal throne for Mu Shaochen, placed on the highest peak. The youth didn’t show any reservation and sat down, looking to be on the same level as the untethered. People took a deep breath after seeing this. He was acting as if he was leading all of Myriad Lineage.

“Screech!” A falcon cry echoed as the bird blotted out the sun.

It closed its wings and floated in the sky above everyone including the current leaders.

“Cloudcrossing Falcon God.” The appearance of an Eternal stirred the crowd.

However, upon closer inspection, they only saw a beautiful girl up there. She jumped down from its back.

“Cloudcrossing Princess.” Eyes turned brighter, especially the ones who liked her.

She ignored everyone else and only smiled widely after seeing Mu Shaochen.

“Brother Chen, you’re here too?” She came forward and bowed.

“I just got here.” He grabbed her hand; the two of them appeared quite intimate.

All kinds of emotions struck the spectators, mostly negative.

“Is Falcon God here?” Mu Shaochen said with a smile.

“The ancestor is always present, he just needs one step to appear.” She spoke with a gaze full of adoration.

The crowd glanced at the falcon. Its presence meant that he could appear at any moment as well.

An Eternal being available certainly made everyone anxious. They all put on a serious expression. Even the untethered felt this pressure.
