Chapter 3640: Wish Ward

The five divisions were located in Buddha Emperor Plateau. Among them, Metropolis and Buddha Emperor were in the same region.

In reality, Necropolis was rather loosely defined. The border areas, in particular, weren’t strictly allocated to a single division.

Here, dozens of cities or more were connected, hence the name Necropolis.

As for the floating one in the center, this was considered the core of Buddha Emperor Division, home to the court of Vajra Dynasty.

Beneath this giant one were numerous cities connected together - a true example of prosperity.

Officials and nobles from the court lived here along with other clans and sects.

All in all, Necropolis was definitely the most complex division in terms of inhabitants. Cultivators from all over the world came each day, not to mention the billions of mortals currently living here.

Duality Academy seemed quiet compared to this lively place. Plus, it was farther away from the Buddha Emperor Division.

In summary, Necropolis had the highest population, prosperity, and rowdiness out of the five. People usually compared it to the capital of Righteous Sect with regards to the factors above.

Chi Xiaoyue’s carriage slowly stopped on a crowded street.

“Wish Ward is right here, would you like to get out now?” She opened the door for Li Qiye. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Here is fine.” Li Qiye walked down.

“Goodbye for now, Young Master, see you later.” Chi Xiaoyie remained polite during the departure.

Li Qiye acted nonchalantly but Yang Ling kept on thanking Chi Xiaoyue until the latter told her to stop.

“Senior Sister Xiaoyue is definitely the friendliest person I’ve met. She doesn’t put on an act so everyone in the academy likes her.” Yang Ling commented while looking at the departing carriage.

Yang Ling was right. When talking about the five heroes, even Lin Hao with a humble background was prideful. He wouldn’t talk to just anyone.

As for Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi? Nobles like them were even prouder and more arrogant.

This wasn’t the case for Chi Xiaoyue. She was the easiest person to talk to and always treated people with respect.

In fact, her background might be nobler than the others. After all, the Chi was an ancient clan. All of this made her attitude even more amazing.

“She’s a smart girl, who doesn’t like a smart girl?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“You do too?” Yang Ling blinked at him.

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t respond. His focus shifted to the arched door ahead.

The street they were on had a sea of people coming and going. People’s feet were virtually touching; one could easily get lost.

The arched door in front of them had an ancient character carved at the center top - Wish. [1]

This stone door was massive and seemed suitable to be the gate of a city.

“This is the main branch of Wish, I love this place.” Yang Ling spun happily around once and took a deep breath to bask in the lively atmosphere.

Duality was lively as well, just not when compared to this place. Cultivators from all over the world came in large quantities. Even mortals visited. The diversity here was incredible.

Li Qiye also smiled while observing the street.

“This main branch is probably the biggest market in the south, you can buy anything here.” She added, eager to come in.

This was far from being her first time here. However, as a girl, going shopping was quite exciting. There was plenty of merchandise here as long as one had enough money. She had prepared plenty of spending money before leaving.

“Anything?.” Li Qiye chuckled. Other famous auction houses or markets in the past suddenly emerged in his mind. Now, they no longer existed.

“Yes!” Her eyes brimmed with excitement: “As long as you can pay the initial price, even dao lord merit laws are available for purchase. Well, I don’t know if this is true or not since I can’t afford them.”

“Let’s go take a look then.” Li Qiye smiled and entered the front gate with Yang Ling right behind him.

Wish Ward wasn’t just a simple store since it resembled a city more. It occupied more than half of the area of the actual city. All the stores here belonged to Wish Ward.

One had to admit that the atmosphere was impressive - the accumulation of thousands of stores ready to sell. There was an archaic atmosphere wafting about as well.

The streets were paved with granite. After millions of years and constant visitors, the initially coarse granite pebbles became glossy and smooth.

The architectural styles were showing their age as well. The green and white tiles have lost their colors, assuming a state of gray.

From a distance, the ward resembled an old castle that has witnessed generations of lives.

“Young Master, did you know that Wish Ward is actually older than our holy ground? It’s already here before...” Yang Ling told Li Qiye about its history.

Li Qiye quietly listened with a smile while looking at the surroundings.

The founding year of the ward was impossible to figure out. People only knew that it was here way before the holy ground. It had thousands of branches all over the south as well.

In a sense, Wish Ward was an extremely powerful faction, albeit hidden. Some believed that it was equal to or even stronger than Buddha Holy Ground and Righteous Sect.

“Impressive resolution.” Li Qiye nodded and praised during the trip.

One could easily guess the power of Wish Ward just by the fact that it existed inside the territories of Buddha Holy Ground. After all, no one wanted to share a bed with someone else.

“Wish Ward actually has many fun places and interesting stories. For example, the most mythical one is the hug mouse.” She introduced the place.

“Hug mouse?” Li Qiye stopped looking around and asked.

“You haven’t heard of it, it’s a legend here. Anyone who meets it will become rich right away.” She became excited since this was another thing Li Qiye didn’t know.

“Looks like you want to see it.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Of course.” She instantly responded: “I’ll be a wealthy lady right away and then I can buy whatever I want at the ward.” She clenched her fists, seemingly fantasizing.

“Okay, stop daydreaming.” Li Qiye pinched her nose and woke her out of it.

“But the legend is true, the mouse really exists.” Yang Ling said: “I think a student from our academy met it before and became rich afterward.”

“I know.” Li Qiye naturally knew this story.

“What? How?” Yang Ling didn’t expect this since he hasn’t heard of the mouse.

“From the books.” Li Qiye smiled.
