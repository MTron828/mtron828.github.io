Chapter 4454: Energy Blade

The crow has certainly left its mark on the last epoch. Even ancient overlords and the rulers of the burial grounds took it quite seriously.

It was older and more frightening than any Immortal Emperor, training invincible cultivators while destroying monstrous lineages. It was the source of numerous legends, albeit they didn’t explicitly include the crow.

Alas, nothing lasted forever. The greatest cultivators would still eventually be forgotten.

Li Qiye’s recollection started with a young shepherd turning into a crow in Immortal Demon Grotto.

“Old man, looks like you always had this up your sleeve. It has always been here, your death isn’t in vain then.” Li Qiye sentimentally murmured.

Only he understood this sentence. The other person who could understand was no longer alive.

He took a deep breath and channeled a merit law with a mudra. True chaos energy engulfed the area and started deriving the grand dao.

“Buzz.” Black rays emanated from the crow as a result. They have been accumulated through eras and had enough power to pierce the sky vault. Runes appeared within the rays and turned them into chains - tiny yet unbreakable.

A bright radiance appeared on the crow’s forehead. Despite being small, it was actually larger than the nine worlds.

It didn’t contain life but rather - endless time. This was the light of worlds, as eternal as can be. In other words, possessing it meant having eternal life. This wasn’t quite immortality but the owner could live as long as heaven itself.

Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed as he used his immortal energy. He closed his hand and started refining the various affinities, even the elusive power of tribulations. Thus, all powers in history have been condensed into his fingertip.

He created a blade of energy, only three inches long but capable of penetrating everything. Even the laws and cycles of the world wouldn’t be able to endure its destruction.

Now that he had the right weapon, his cutting movement was at the apogee level. Its profundity couldn’t be described by words.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The chains sealing the crow were being cut by a combination of perfect sharpness and precision. They fell apart with no signs of being cut as if the two ends were separated naturally, not by an external force.

As more chains went down, the radiance in the crowd’s forehead became increasingly brighter and larger - the same with the inner world. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He took a deep breath and released a flood of primordial chaos energy. The rays seemed to be of the immortal level. His body became the ruler of the ages and the source of everything. Even planets were tiny in comparison.

If outsiders were somehow here, they would be fully suppressed by his activated state, unable to stop themselves from trembling.

He became the sole true immortal in existence. His one thought could destroy or create an epoch.

He then cut the crow’s forehead with lightning speed. One could even hear a soft sound of bone breaking as he cut through it completely.

“Boom!” Time exploded from the radiance and poured out. It had accumulated for too many years, from the past all the way to the future. Thus, this temporal flood encompassed untold devastation.

It struck Li Qiye’s immortal rays and actually managed to with them. Fortunately, his primordial chaos laws were able to slow down the flood.

“Zzz.” Alas, they were decaying as well.
