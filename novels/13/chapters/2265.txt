“Ah!” Feng Xiaochen swept through the several thousand experts of Silver Dragon, not giving them a chance to start battle formations.

Blood stained the ground of the altar. Not as many corpses because the fallen combatants were blown off the pinnacle.

“Boom!” Finally, the gigantic cauldron aimed for Everlasting Emperor with an unstoppable momentum.

The emperor became serious, not daring to underestimate Xiaochen’s power.

In this split second, a huge palm sealed the area and successfully repelled the cauldron, leaving a palm print behind on the cauldron’s surface.

This person was mighty enough to show his superiority after one exchange.

An old man stood next to the emperor with a supreme divinity in his eyes. Even a True Emperor wouldn’t dare to be careless against him.

“Grandwar Ancestor!” The ancestors in the crowd shuddered all the same.

Cai Dawei, those who knew this name became startled. This was the other great ancestor in the system beside the Pill King.

He was much stronger in comparison - a ninth-level True God, very close to becoming an Eternal. Low-level True Gods were no match for this awesome being.

“Brother Feng, no need to be angry. Let’s not fight with a junior now.” Grandwar stood there like an awe-inspiring, unreachable mountain.

The Pill King enjoyed his status and influence due to his Longevity Pills. In terms of cultivation, he was not a match for Grandwar. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Cai Dawei, it is not wise for you to side with Everlasting. One wrong step will result in infamy.” The Pill King still called out his real name despite being weaker.

“To each their own.” Grandwar said: “Brother Feng, Longevity System has weakened for a long time now, we need an ambitious leader to stop this trend.”

“You are definitely on something. The foundation of the valley is beyond your imagination. A heavy sword might not be sharp but still deadly nonetheless; a lack of action doesn’t imply weakness. As the ages went by, how many systems have disappeared while ours still remained standing strong.”

“I’ve made up my mind.” Grandwar said with a stern expression: “Out of consideration for our friendship, I advise you and your sect to stop siding with the villains. Certain powers are beyond your imagination as well, it is not too late to retreat now lest you want to die.”

“That only makes it more interesting for me. I’ve been alive for so long, not fearing many. Let them come, my sect will always stand together with the valley. Our stance here will be a lesson for future generations of Longevity.”

The crowd was shaken by his powerful and decisive rhetoric.

“There’s nothing I can do then, Brother Feng. We’ll decide this on the battlefield.” Grandwar shook his head and sighed.

The Pill King laughed in response: “That’s perfectly fine. We have different opinions and lords. A fight to the death it is.”

The breathless crowd couldn’t quite explain their feelings right now. These two great ancestors of their system had a good relationship once but shall be battling to the death today.

Most felt that the Pill King wasn’t a match for Grandwar. The former was definitely more influential since Eternals and True Gods have asked him for help before with Longevity Pills. However, Grandwar as a ninth-level True God was much stronger.

“Buzz.” Herb-Plucking Peaks suddenly resonated with something. The sound wasn’t loud but everyone could hear it clearly.

They looked up and saw strands of lights oozing from the peaks and pushing away the clouds.

A girl sitting on top of a boulder sticking out of a hill was revealed. On top was an old pine, the source of these green rays. The rays shone over her, making her look exceptional.

“It’s Senior Sister Miaozhen!” A disciple immediately recognized her.

“You finally show yourself!” Miracle Young Noble opened his eyes and unsheathed his sword. A slash descended like a river of stars. The endless sword energy cut straight for Miaozhen.

“Buzz.” Her glow converged, replaced by fog and clouds as she disappeared. The slash made the clouds dispersed but she was nowhere to be found.

Miracle scowled and instantly locked on another location. Another meteoric slash shattered the void, revealing Miaozhen standing on a different rock.

He thrust forward, one crossing through space while aiming for her chest just like a rainbow over the horizon.

“Quite powerful, especially under the suppression of the peak. He’s probably at the pseudo-True Emperor level.” Someone quietly assessed.

“Buzz.” Miaozhen gathered the clouds and fogs, turning them into a shield to stop the meteoric slash.

“Boom!” The strike successfully broke the shield but she was nowhere to be found after the dust settled.

Just when the crowd thought she had disappeared again, Miracle had enough. Swords soared to the sky and turned into a massive prison, sweeping away all the clouds to reveal her location. She was now trapped in the prison of swords.

“How are you going to run now?! Surrender or die!” Miracle uttered coldly.

“Is that so?” A carefree voice answered instead of Miaozhen.

“Impossible!” The crowd couldn’t believe it. Both the two great ancestors felt the same way.

Li Qiye was actually standing at the top of Herb-plucking, even higher than Miracle. He looked calm as if he was there the entire time and no one noticed him.

People looked back at the altar and didn’t see Li Qiye, realizing that this wasn’t an illusion.

“What’s going on?!” So many powerful ancestors became startled because no one could fly up there or move so quickly, not even Eternals and True Emperors.

Some have tried before using all of their might. This ended with multiple explosions and detonations under the pressure of the peak. They eventually concluded that in order to truly withstand this pressure, one would need to be at the progenitor level.

But now, Li Qiye did it so silently and without any difficulty. This was a miracle of the ages; no one has been able to do so before. Alchemy Immortal would be the only other person capable of this task.
