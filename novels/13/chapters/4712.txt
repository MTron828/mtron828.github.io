Chapter 4713: To Ashes

It felt as if metal was about to drip down from the cauldron’s molten exterior. The escaping strands alone burned the air while leaving large pits on the ground.

As the temperature rose, the vegetation and trees instantly turned to ashes once affected by the radius. This wasn’t a gradual burning process.

Eventually, the clothes of spectators who thought they were safe started burning as well.

“Fuck!” This horrified them and forced them to run away.

“This heat is unbearable.” Someone said.

Keep in mind that they weren’t wearing ordinary clothes found in the mortal world. Their materials were excellent with a nullification effect, shielding them from flames and water. This no longer mattered in this case.

“Something is off.” Sword Dao Paragon’s expression soured.

The other paragons noticed the same thing. This was not their first time using this formation and cauldron. This melting phenomenon never occurred the last time they went all out.

“The dao lord flames inside is that frightening?” One spectator eventually asked.

An ancestor shook his head and became emotional: “I don’t think it's the power of the cauldron, this is not looking good, he’s about to break out.”

“Break out?” An expert didn’t buy it: “Isn’t he refined to ashes already?”

Everyone saw him struggling with palm strikes earlier but he eventually stopped.

“Damn! Watch it!” Sword Dao Paragon shouted and warned the others.

Unfortunately, this realization came too late. The molten cauldron suddenly changed into a human figure. This took everyone by surprise since they thought that Li Qiye was about to blow a wall open.

The liquified cauldron was being absorbed along with its flames and dao lord power. Next came the formation and all relevant profundities…

Li Qiye then appeared before the crowd again with a layer of concentrated liquid surrounding him. In the next moment, he absorbed everything into his body.

This naturally astounded everyone, especially his enemies. Did this guy just absorb this monstrous dao lord cauldron in just one second?

Li Qiye smiled at everyone; the opposite expression surfaced on his enemies’ face.

“Go!” Sword Dao Paragon ordered.

“Boom!” Wild Paragon prepared the strongest defense with his six treasures.

Sword Dao Paragon summoned countless swords to form a majestic fortress.

Sacredscroll Paragon chanted a special mantra. An energy scroll appeared around him and make him one with the dao, forming an impressive defense.

Suddenly, Li Qiye sent back all of the forces he had stolen toward his enemies.

An ocean of flames appeared in front of him. Mountain ranges nearby started burning; the water of a great river evaporated, leaving behind a desert.

The defenses had no chance of stopping the sudden attack, leaving the paragons vulnerable. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Ahhh!” The sixteen sovereigns were the first to fall, unable to slow the flames even for a moment.

The paragons had a better reaction and prepared their strongest defense. Unfortunately, this dao lord-level flame was above their station.

“Ahhh!” Their defenses lasted for a few seconds before going down along with their users.

After incinerating the opponent, the flames receded and dispersed, looking like a devil licking his lips - still not fully satiated.

What’s left behind was scorched earth. The ground became glass after being subjected to an unbearable temperature. If it was aimed at a great power, the latter would disappear in the blink of an eye.

Gusts of wind started blowing ashes away, leaving nothing behind of the twenty combatants. It was as if they had never existed in the first place.

Li Qiye was the only one left, stretching lazily without a single wound despite being trapped in the cauldron earlier.

This naturally left the crowd speechless. Absorbing the cauldron was already insane, but to send that force back to kill twenty top cultivators?
