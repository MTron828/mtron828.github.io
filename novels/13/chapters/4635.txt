Chapter 4636: True Immortal Young Emperor

The driver of the ancient chariot was a beauty with radiant features brighter than the stars. She wore a light-blue dress with golden stitchings exuding a noble aura.

However, the most conspicuous thing about her was neither her beauty and aura but rather, a type of sword energy.

She had a sword tied to her back. Its scabbard couldn’t fully contain its power and had traces of time everywhere. Nonetheless, its material was impeccable. It must have been a part of numerous battles and polished by the grip of an invincible master.

The girl was equally as impressive. Her body seemed to be made from sword energy instead of flesh and blood. The outer shell served as a scabbard. Once unleashed, she would shock the world.

Moreover, she and the sword were in perfect harmony - two separate yet one entity.

Spectators were in awe after witnessing her attainment with the sword dao. Even those who didn’t know her identity or anything about the sword dao could see that she was strong.

“True Immortal Saintess!” Many shouted after recognizing her.

“That’s who it is?!” Those nearby became startled since this was a renowned title. She had no lack of fans and suitors.

“The number one sword user of True Immortal’s young generation.” An expert commented.

“Sword Saintess.” One youth had admiration in his eyes as he said: “She’s the last disciple of True Immortal Sect Master. Two years ago, her master had nothing but praises for her swordsmanship during a dao discussion. She could enter a state of samadhi while using the sword and will certainly be unbeatable later on.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Rumor has it that she became the number one sword user there when she was only fifteen, defeating all the other geniuses.” One fan said.

“Back in Eight-treasure Manor, she defeated the King of Wolves with one sword, killing the Cicada Saint with two slashes, and ended Nine-headed Serpent God with three. That’s about as dominant as it gets.” One genius added.

She was one of the Six Prodigies of True Immortal and the best sword user among them. Other geniuses paled in comparison.

Her background, personal power, and beauty were all top-notch. Therefore, the young spectators couldn’t help but fall for her.

“She’s the driver…” A few big shots noticed this key point, meaning that the person inside must be even more prestigious.

“Rumble!” Once the chariot got close enough and the clouds dispersed, spectators could finally see the person sitting inside - a youth with porcelain skin and features seemingly carved by heaven itself. He was a perfect vessel for the grand dao.

He wore a yellow robe made from the finest draconic silk. Each thread flashed brightly with golden light. There was no embroidery of a five-clawed dragon. Nonetheless, it was well-fitted and showed off his vigorous and tough physique.

Though he sat in a whimsical and lazy fashion, a charismatic aura still exuded from him. He didn’t need to show his strength for others to see his exceptional qualities.

“Boom!” When he opened his eyes wide, an irresistible force invaded everyone’s heart and soul. It didn’t matter whether they were top masters or weak cultivators; their background didn’t matter either. All felt their legs trembling, wanting to kneel down before the youth.

Two characters immediately popped up in their head - young emperor.

“True Immortal Young Emperor!” They all thought of one famous genius right away.

“The young emperor is here…” Astonishment struck the crowd. Many became emotional and took a deep breath. His very existence convinced them of his status - one of the five conquerors and the leader of the Six Prodigies.

According to the legends, visual phenomena accompanied his birth. He was blessed with primal fate palaces - a constitution unavailable to others.

Sure enough, he took full advantage of this - being able to control dao lord weapons at the age of five, beating martial uncles at the age of eight, contending against ancestors at ten, becoming an heir at fifteen and fighting the rest of the world.

Sure enough, he had plenty of female fans. They couldn’t help but become enamored.

“I love you!” Some of them even shouted with hearts in their eyes.

This was a jealousy-inducing scene but it was rather understandable. After all, he was none other than True Immortal Young Emperor.
