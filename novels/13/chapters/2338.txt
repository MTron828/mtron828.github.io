Words couldn’t be heard in this area for the crowd had nothing to say. A few experts prayed for Solitary’s victory against Li Qiye.

The youth didn’t know much about this particular sword user, but the older masters and ancestors truly admired his sword dao. Solitary wouldn’t care about ninth-level True Gods, even those so close to being an Eternal.

His love for the sword made him only train in the sword dao, establishing an incredible foundation - something the other True Gods couldn’t compare to despite training in progenitorial laws.

“So fast.” Solitary said solemnly: “I’ve never seen something like this before, you will be a worthy foe.”

There was no antagonism in his tone, only a simple challenge.

Li Qiye looked at him and said: “Hmm, your sword dao is alright at the complexity to simplicity state, reaching Samadhi with this dao.”

Some were stunned after this comment. It could be said that when strictly speaking about the sword dao, no one in Myriad knew more than him. But now, Li Qiye said that it was only “alright”? Quite an unreasonable and haughty statement.

Nevertheless, Solitary slowly untied the heavy sword behind his back and held it with one hand. He didn’t emit an imposing sword energy, but he himself looked like a sheathed sword, as immovable as Mount Tai.

“Speed is not my forte but after witnessing your slash earlier, I am jubilant. Please, make your move to determine the better between the two of us.” Solitary said. Li Qiye was not an enemy to him, only a worthy foe.

“Quick-draw isn’t my forte either.” Li Qiye chuckled.

The crowd became slack-jawed; some even audibly gasped. Everyone has seen it - when the sword came out, heads will fall. Nothing else in the world could match it.

This was something worthy of pride, yet Li Qiye just said it wasn’t even his forte? If this was the truth, it would be too terrifying. His real skill would be completely dreadful.

Solitary’s eyes narrowed, wishing to see some clues but unable to spot anything.

“May I ask what you are best at?” Solitary asked.

“Killing, that’s all.” Li Qiye freely said.

For some reason, people could smell the stench of blood and become horrified.

“Clank.” Solitary finally unsheathed his sword, very slowly and solemnly. However, not a single exquisite movement was unnecessary.

With a serious expression, he requested: “Please show me your quick-draw.”

“Simplicity and power, the might of a heavy sword user.” Li Qiye said while looking at the heavy sword.

This sword was unadorned, devoid of decorations, just a tool for murder.

“It’s a bit boring if I use quick-draw versus your heavy sword. Let’s settle it with a heavy style as well.” Li Qiye smiled while shaking his head.

“A heavy sword style?” Solitary’s eyes lit up, overwhelmed with excitement.

Just the quick-draw style already stirred him beyond belief. After years of training, his dao became simple, resulting in this heavy style. Each technique no longer needed variation, only weight and power.

He never cared for powerful foes, only opponents skilled in the sword. Unfortunately, they were a rare breed.

So now, when Li Qiye wished to do this contest with his own heavy style, Solitary became thrilled as a master of this dao.

Li Qiye said: “I shall show you the truest form of the sword.”

Having said that, his body started glowing ever so lightly and began to float. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Clank.” The hymn of a sword could be heard, but none was in sight. His body itself was the blade at this moment.

“Incredible!” Solitary couldn’t help but praise even before the enemy made his move: “That’s a sword indeed!”

“Clank!” The heavy sword in his hand resonated without showing great fanfare and radiance. In this split second, it seemed to be alive.

More importantly, he also became an unsheathed sword. It didn’t have sharpness, only an incalculable weight that could crush the firmaments. People couldn’t distinguish between him and his sword for the two have fused into one.

He started floating up and stood directly in front of Li Qiye.

“I’m ready.” Solitary calmly said while being one with the sword.

Suddenly, a colossal sword materialized above. It was large enough for a galaxy to float around it. Just one slash could split the world into two halves. Merit laws and techniques were insignificant in comparison, as brittle as dried branches.

“What is that sword...” People looked up at the sky. One couldn’t see it fully without relying on their heavenly gaze.

“This might be too much.” Li Qiye chuckled and raised his hand. The sword shrank in size, becoming big enough to fall into his grip.

It emitted a bronze luster, simple and ancient. It also carried immense weight. This sword compared to Solitary’s own seemed to be about even.

“Sword existing in the heart.” Solitary sighed and said: “What’s its name?”

“Bronze.” Li Qiye answered before test swinging it once.

“Bronze.” Solitary repeated this ordinary yet memorable name.

Everyone assumed that this name would have an awesome name so they were caught off guard.

“Let us begin.” Solitary initiated.

“You first, so people won’t say that I didn’t give you a chance.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Very well.” Solitary didn’t waste time. His eyes became resplendent as two suns, pouring out a light that could burn everything.
