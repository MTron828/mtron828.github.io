Chapter 3532: Unrestrained Tears

Everyone was kneeling on the ground regardless of who they were, not daring to breathe loudly and disturbing Li Qiye. That would be disrespectful.

No one knew who he was but since Dragon King Commander, Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang, and Shi Zhongtian were kneeling, his background and identity no longer mattered.

Nonetheless, the question still lingered in their mind. Just who was Li Qiye? How heaven-defying could his background be? No one dared to ask, of course.

Some didn’t even have the courage to steal a glance at Li Qiye or it might bring a calamity to their sect.

They knew one thing for certain - that Li Qiye was a supreme existence, one far exceeding dao lords. This was obvious given how those three beings were treating him.

The next question became - what kind of existence is above dao lords? They couldn’t come up with an answer while trembling with fear.

“Can it be...” One or two wisdom masters lived long enough to see clues in the shrouded history. They thought about a few particular lines in the records.

According to the legend, there used to be a master reigning over the eras, a supreme emperor, a monster sweeping through all opponents...

Historians had contrasting opinions on whether these figures were the same person or otherwise.

They didn’t fully understand the vagueness of the records. Rumor has it that someone had disrespected the figure and ended up with total sect destruction. From then on, it became a taboo subject.

Another camp stated that a certain group purposely hid these events from the river of time...

No one knew that exact reason but the forbidden nature made future generations forget.

“It has to be him...” The wisdom master thought about these legends and became overwhelmed. The legends were actually true.

He secretly looked up to see Li Qiye before lowering his head right away, not wanting to be spotted. It was difficult to control his emotions right now. This was truly an honor.

Unfortunately, this was also a curse. He couldn’t share this with anyone else, not even to his juniors. This was a defining moment of his life yet he had to keep it a secret forever.

Ultimately, the ones feeling the full brunt were still those from Yin Yang Gate. They thought that their sovereign was the strongest, not inferior to any dao lord. They were so sure that Li Qiye was a dead man and that they were saved.

Alas, their ancestor was now kneeling in front of Li Qiye to display total subservience. This was beyond their most terrible nightmare. They realized that they have messed with the wrong person, the worst possible man.

The five ancient ancestors couldn’t believe it either, especially the Celestial Trinity.

They have been following Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang for some time. They knew more about him and his supremacy more than anyone else. How could their ancestor bow next to Li Qiye’s feet like this?

It became obvious how much trouble they had brought upon their sect. They were now eternal sinners of Yin Yang Gate.

“Rise.” Li Qiye smiled and gave the command.

Everyone felt as if they have just been pardoned from a serious crime. The commander was an exception.

However, the sovereign and Shi Zhongtian waited until the commander stood up first before they did. The rest of the crowd was smart enough to wait for these three as well.

“Your Excellency.” The commander had tears in his eyes.

Li Qiye also felt a sense of familiarity. He smiled and said: “I thought that turtles live the longest, it looks like you live longer than them.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The listeners felt as if only Li Qiye would dare to compare the great cultivator with a turtle. Anyone else would be trembling with fear when talking with Dragon King Commander.

“It is thanks to your blessing, Your Excellency.” The commander said excitedly.

“You’re old now, no longer the young chicken like before. However, you may still call me Boss.” Li Qiye said.

“Deference is no substitute for obedience, Boss.” The commander happily rubbed his palms together and said.

Ye Yaoling standing nearby felt as if her forefather has become a million years younger, reverting back to being a youth.

The commander was an old friend - the four-eyed basilisk!

He survived the long years and became a supreme ancestor with a cool title. He used to call Li Qiye “Boss” when they were together. Thus, Li Qiye told him to do the same for sentimental reasons.

“You still look the same, always eighteen.” The commander said.

“Time moves so quickly, so many people are gone now.” Li Qiye stared at the commander and said.

The basilisk sighed because loved ones have left him. This included his closest sister, Venerable Basilisk. Only a selected few were alive from his generation.

He didn’t expect to see Li Qiye again. In the past, he saw Li Qiye tear the sky apart and left. Words couldn’t describe his feelings regarding this reunion.

In fact, when Ye Yaoling reported this back to him, he suspected that it might be an imposter. When he actually saw Li Qiye again, he found the guy to be the same. His temperament and style couldn’t be duplicated.
