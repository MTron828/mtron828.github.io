The cauldron gave the demon king an extraordinary aura. He seemed to be blessed by the tiger god.

All became curious regarding the power of this cauldron under his usage.

“Junior, one of us will die today!” The demon king shouted.

He referred to Li Qiye as either “bastard” or “little animal” a while ago. However, he had changed his tone, clearly impressed by Li Qiye’s abilities.

“Let’s go, time to end this.” Li Qiye said frivolously.

“Very well!” The demon king roared and let out his vitality. Divine circles pulsed around him as a domain emerged and stabilized.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The supreme laws from the cauldron coiled tightly around him. The last sound resembled a lock clicking. These laws suddenly became red like molten chains.

“Buzz.” The molten laws then melted into his body, quite a frightening sight since it looked awfully painful. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Boom!” The cauldron finally opened and unleashed a bright radiance, painting the area red. It resembled the color of a ruby, not blood. This crystallized shine gave off a holy and mysterious feeling.

Next came the aura of the tiger god as if he was here in person. The stars were overshadowed as a result.

“Raa!” A roar pushed the winds and clouds away. A bloody tiger flew out of the cauldron with a shiny ruby glow. It wasn’t overly bright but could pierce through anyone’s eyes.

Despite only being the size of a fist, it contained a majestic power. Each step could crush the void and any living beings - even the strongest geniuses.

“The tiger god’s true blood.” An elder shouted and licked his lips.

Just imagine the value of the tiger god’s true blood. Using and turning it into one’s own would greatly boost cultivation. It would benefit the user for a lifetime.

This was especially true for the demon disciples. They viewed it as a sacred treasure.

“Boom!” This true blood slammed into the demon king’s chest and fused with him.

“Raaa!” Rays resembling the glint of a ruby shot out from him. He grew larger until he was the size of a mountain.

This wasn’t a grand avatar and had nothing to do with the myriad-form realm. The blood simply activated inside the demon king’s body, allowing him to assume this empowered state.

“Crack!” Cracks suddenly appeared all over him.

He clearly couldn’t withstand this infusion of power and was on the verge of exploding.

“Clank!” However, the chains that have melted inside him began stabilizing his form to stop the crumbling process.

Many finally understood why the laws melted into him. They were crucial in keeping him together.

“Boom!” The divine circles immediately doubled in size and still continue to grow.

“Clank!” Star lights and grand dao power from the earth began to come out and harmonized. These affinities coiled together around the demon king.

After a loud detonation, his body exuded a sacred aura, capable of shouldering the world and controlling the grand dao. He seemed unsurpassable at this point.

“Grand Dao Sacred Physique!” Everyone became astounded including the protectors and elders.

“It really is the sacred physique realm.” Mountainbearer King felt the same way.

Everyone knew that he was at the grand level of myriad-form. How did he break through the barrier so quickly and without any warning?

“This is because of the pressure from the battle?” One disciple wondered.

This wasn’t impossible. Some geniuses would rise above the pressure in battle and reach the next realm, eventually defeating their foe.

A few believed that this was the case.

“No, it’s only temporary.” Mountainbearer King saw through it and said seriously: “This is due to the true blood of the tiger god. He does wield the power of a sacred physique cultivator right now.”

Nonetheless, everyone thought that this was a miracle. Very few could use external help to make it through one whole realm.

Some started contemplating. No wonder why Iron Whip Demon King dared to oppose Ping Suoweng earlier.

So it turned out that the demon king was confident because he had this ace card up his sleeve. He could really fight against Suoweng with the help of this cauldron.

They took a deep breath. The tiger clan was worthy of their reputation in Divine Black, having so many resources.

“Buzz.” One could hear the harmonization of the myriad beasts as their frightening auras engulfed the area.

Now, the demon king was truly empowered by the tiger god. It was obvious how much stronger he had just gotten.

“On the same level as the sect master?” One disciple asked.

Ping Suoweng was the strongest in Divine Black but the demon king didn’t look inferior with this form of his.
