This sudden development took everyone like a storm. The one reversing the tide wasn’t Soaring Immortal or Li Qiye, it was Gu Zun from Heaven Suppression. Surely no one expected for this to happen.

“Whoosh!” Two ropes shot out and immediately coiled around Li Qiye and the four siblings’ bubbles. Gu Zun wanted to take them with him.

“Clank!” The hymn of a spear resonated as the weapon aimed for Gu Zun. The azure dragon stopped his path and scared the crowd with its intensity.

“Your legion should be focusing on stopping the Ancient Ming.” Gu Zun smiled and said.

“Release the temporal bubbles and I’ll spare your life.” Worldkeeper spoke sternly, leaving no room for negotiation.

Even though Gu Zun was one of the ten eonic geniuses, he couldn’t underestimate someone as powerful as Worldkeeper.

“Unfortunately, your opponent is not me.” Gu Zun still wasn’t afraid at all. He laughed loudly at Soaring Immortal: “If there is no objection, I shall be taking your princes.”

All the experts and ancestors in Soaring Immortal were both livid and scared. They couldn’t do anything to help since their main fighting force had just woken up from the mist. They were busy with stopping Ye Jiuzhou from stealing their most important treasury.

The sect was indeed mighty but Jiuzhou came prepared with many treasures and sieging artifacts. He was simply unstoppable and it took many ancestors before Soaring Immortal managed to hinder his movement.

Thus, they couldn’t spare men to try and save the four princes. As for the people still immersed in the mist, this group was useless.

Gu Zun wasn’t in a rush to escape because Li Qiye and the four princes couldn’t escape from his seal. Azure Dragon Legion was still guarding this area on top of the Black Dragon King looming in the horizon. He was certainly aware of this. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Despite his top middle-aged form, he knew that he alone couldn’t fight both the legion and the Black Dragon King. Thus, he had decided to use his ace card, which is taking advantage of his hostages!

“Boom!” A holy location in Soaring Immortal suddenly cracked open!

There was an old grave in this place. Despite the humble size, it had beautiful sceneries with an abundance of holy rays and imperial auras. There weren’t that many things in the world that could enjoy this treatment. The eternal auspicious rays here showed that this item or person was too important to an emperor.

There was a simple tablet before this grave with the words, “Love of my life”. It was signed by, “Ye Yunzhou.”

People might not know who Ye Yunzhou was but they were certainly familiar with his title, Immortal Emperor Tun Ri, the third emperor of Soaring Immortal.

A woman came out from the grave with a beauty stealing away the splendor of the mountains, rivers, and the stars. She was the culmination of all that is fair and bright in the world. The most admirable feature was her regal aura, making others want to kneel down after sensing it. It was as if she was born to rule the world and give orders.

“Is this Immortal Emperor Tun Ri’s wife?” The experts from Soaring Immortal were stunned to see the woman walking out from the grave.

They knew that this location was extremely holy since it was the burial of the emperor’s beloved wife. After she passed away, he mourned and couldn’t forget. Her grave has always been illuminated by his imperial light.

For many generations, the disciples of Soaring Immortal came to this place in order to worship and remember her meritorious contributions to the sect.

So when this supreme woman came out of nowhere, the disciples all thought that their imperial queen had come back to life.

“That’s not Imperial Queen Tun Ri. It’s Imperial Queen Ren Xian!” An ancestor quickly recognized in astoundment.

Many disciples were shocked to hear this. They didn’t understand what was going on because Imperial Queen Ren Xian was buried very far away in a different location in Soaring Immortal. Why was she buried here in this place?

Many experts knew that Imperial Queen Ren Xian died young and couldn’t enjoy the glory of being a queen. However, due to Immortal Emperor Ren Xian’s contribution to the sect, she was buried in Soaring Immortal as well so that future descendants could worship her.

A few ancestors who were generals under Immortal Emperor Ren Xian became quiet. It seemed that they weren’t too surprised to see this because they knew what was going on. They chose to stand on her side. Otherwise, how could the Ren Xian branch have the ability to make all the decisions right now?

“Boom!” She raised her finger straight at Ye Jiuzhou’s cavalry.

“Ah!” Many experts from Heaven Suppression were instantly killed. Even Ye Jiuzhou was blown away. The opponent was simply too strong and he couldn’t block her first move.

“Whoosh!” She took one step into the battlefield and instantly blocked Gu Zun’s path.

At this moment, Gu Zun, the imperial queen, and the azure dragon formed a triangle. The first to take action would be at a disadvantage.

“Release my children and I shall spare you.” She spoke for the first time with an unquestionable authority. She didn’t care for a monster like Gu Zun at all.

Gu Zun smiled in response and leisurely said: “Imperial queen, I have no hostility towards your sect. This is only a little method to get you to come out. It’s much easier with you here now, I can let the four imperial princes go and dispel the poisonous mist, with just one condition!”

“You’re not qualified to negotiate with me! Release my children now or I shall trample your Heaven Suppression!” Her eyes turned cold with an oppressive glint.

“Imperial queen, don’t waste our time.” Gu Zun smiled and shook his head: “I won’t deny your considerable power. I believe you have the strength of an Emperor Contender right now, no, maybe even the means of an Emperor Rival from the Ancient Ming. But I, Gu Zun, am not afraid of you. I have met people much more terrifying than you before.”

His eyes became serious at this point: “Right now, we are on the same boat. Imperial queen, you’re not a fool and should be able to tell between friends and foes. I only need him, you can have the rest.”

The queen stared at Li Qiye sealed inside the bubble with a murderous glimmer. She knew exactly who this person was! Her lifelong goal was to kill him!

“And if I refuse?” She asked coldly.

“Then, your plan for many generations will go to waste.” He smiled: “Not only will you lose your children, your sect will be massacred as well and turn to ashes. If you want to go hard with me, no problem, I’ll release him and work together with the Azure Dragon Legion.”

He went on: “No need to glare at me like that. That’s right, I want to kill His Excellency and he knows it too. He knew that I had a penchant for treachery since my youth so it’s not surprising for me to betray him at all. Even if I stand by his side, he might still not forgive me and will kill me eventually. But don’t forget, we are strangers while I am still master-disciple with His Excellency. If I have to pick my death, I will definitely pick being killed by him. It will be much more glorious and renowned. Plus, even if I won’t be considered a contributor or an ally after releasing him, at the very least, I’ll still earn a proper death with a grave!”

“So now, do you know the right choice? Stand by my side and stop the Azure Dragon Legion so I can escape. I’ll release the imperial princes from the Temporal Bubble in due time!”

The queen slightly batted her eyes and had to reconsider.

“Not a bad plan.” Worldkeeper said coldly. His legion was watching both Gu Zun and the queen at the same time.

“You’re too kind, True God. This is because His Excellency is such a good mentor.” Gu Zun joked: “As the saying goes, rich and risk go together, so I have to seize success in a time of danger. The truth is that I’m not too confident in success right now because His Excellency had schemed the ages. But regardless of that, I still have to try, don’t you think, True God?”
