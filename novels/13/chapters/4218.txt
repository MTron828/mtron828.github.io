Chapter 4219: Which Spatial Technique?

The bizarre thing was that the blood didn’t gush from Li Qiye’s torso but rather, his enemies.

Though Peace Ocean and Void were far enough away, the thrust still injured them. The sword should have penetrated Li Qiye’s body but somehow, the tip appeared before both Void and Peace Ocean’s chest.

Fortunately, due to their fast reaction time, it wasn’t a full penetration and only left a deep wound with blood gushing out.

This development left the spectators bewildered and lost. The duo’s moves did connect with Li Qiye and should have killed him.

However, he somehow reversed the situation by injuring the enemies via piercing his own body? This was simply unimaginable and illogical.

“What the hell did he do?” Someone shouted.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“How can this be? More sorcery from Li Qiye!” A youth racked his brain and couldn’t come up with an answer.

“Li Qiye has never let us down before, still the son of miracles.” One ancestor commented.

His fans had become disappointed after seeing him fall to the void and sword thrust. Now, this reversal successfully invigorated them.

“Space Reversal?” Void was aghast and blurted out: “No, Space Physique. No, that can’t be either, Space Leap? Time Reversal… No, your cultivation isn’t at this level!”

Many experts have never heard of these names before, let alone understanding them. Nonetheless, they sounded quite impressive and should be top merit laws and secret arts.

“Decent knowledge, albeit superficial. I suppose you have indeed learned from the six wheels.” Li Qiye smiled.

His head was still separated from his body but it didn’t affect him in the slightest.

“This is impossible!” Void shouted. Li Qiye was clearly struck by his technique, evident by his current separated state.

Such spatial mastery was above Li Qiye’s current cultivation. Even their strongest ancestor, Earthraiser Vajra, might not have these abilities.

“Indeed, my cultivation is too low. Isn’t it miraculous?” Li Qiye chuckled.

Void had no idea that the new scriptures came into being thanks to Li Qiye. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was the creator of the six wheels.

Thus, this Void Wheel of his looked like child’s play in Li Qiye’s eyes.

“Why is he doing fine? Look at his limbs…” Many cultivators were surprised that Li Qiye could still speak.

“What else is there to say? Li Qiye simply defies logic.” Someone commented.

“All of those spatial techniques…” A big shot who was adept in spatial manipulation thought about it and said: “Hmm, looks like Li Qiye has learned something comparable to the six wheels.”

Everyone had different thoughts about Li Qiye’s current situation.

“The young noble’s cultivation is so strange, both strong and weak.” Xu Yiyun asked.

“It’s not that.” A’zhi shook his head: “It’s dependent on his wish. If he wants to go all-out, he’ll be unstoppable. Otherwise, he’s as weak as a scholar who can’t catch a chicken.”

“That’s a thing?” Yiyun found this surprising because this seemed to be different from everyone else’s cultivation.

“It’s beyond our understanding. I’m positive that he can become invincible though, at least from what I’ve observed so far.” A’zhi said softly.

The girls didn’t quite understand how he could shift his perceived cultivation and power at will. There must be logic in this but unfortunately, this was above their comprehension.

“Alright, time for me to return the favor.” Li Qiye smiled and successfully intimidated the duo.

Meanwhile, everyone else watched with bated breath.

They still assumed that he would remove the sword from his body and show them a supreme sword art. However, he betrayed expectations by actually thrusting the sword deeper into his body.

They became slack-jawed because he seemed insistent on destroying himself.

Alas, the tip of his sword suddenly appeared half-an-inch away from both Peace Ocean and Void’s throat. Its coldness made them feel pain.

Nonetheless, they were top geniuses and reacted swiftly. Peace Ocean performed a movement technique and leaped backward in an arc, moving a million miles in the blink of an eye.

Void was even more impressive with his spatial steps. He flashed into nothingness and traveled across numerous dimensions.

Their effort was not rewarded. The sword tip somehow kept up with them and was still half-an-inch away.
