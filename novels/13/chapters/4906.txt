Chapter 4907: Why Are Beggars Everywhere?

Bloodsea Blade headed for the forest, fading away like a phantom. His dao path was a solitary one. Nothing in this world could hinder him.

“Young Noble, you’re not returning to Eight-stallion?” Jian Yunyun wanted to leave as well but felt bad about Li Qiye.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She had brought him here and shouldn’t just abandon him. Thus, she asked: “I will be going to the academy, will you come with me?”

“The academy.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Right, the oldest lineage in Chaos. I’m currently enrolled.” She nodded.

“Fine, let’s go take a look.” Li Qiye said.

“Maybe you will like it.” She said: “It is a place filled with young talents, whether it be those from The People or The Race.”

The academy was far older than even Deity or Untethered. Its origin couldn’t be traced at this point.

Moreover, it accepted everyone as well, not picking a side in the eternal conflict. Some believed it to be the leader of Hundred Races - the oldest and most influential branch in this faction.

Jian Yunyun came from Primal and was the successor of the Alliance. However, she still studied at the academy since it didn’t discriminate.

Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand, extinguishing the bonfire.

She heaved a sigh of relief because this was perfect. He would have a place to stay and most importantly, she still had more questions.

“Why are you heading back?” He asked.

“I want to ask someone there a question. I’ve heard that the supreme ancestor came to see this person before disappearing. This might be the last person to have seen her.”

“Supreme ancestor”, in this case, referred to the empress dowager.

“Off we go.” Li Qiye stretched and said.

Jian Yunyun checked the direction first before starting.

However, they suddenly heard a clicking noise, not too loud but still clearly heard by both.

An old man approached from the forest, walking at an orderly pace.

This startled Jian Yunyun because first, it was Ascension Sacred Lord then Illumination Empress Dowager before Bloodsea Blade. This remote region was far from being remote.

He was frail, thin, and dressed in a tattered robe with patchwork that was shoddily done. He was blind, with puffed-out eyelids that only had a tiny gap in the middle, giving him a limited vision. His cheeks were caved in and his bones were visible. Children might cry at his sight.

She thought that he must be freezing due to the thin robe, not to mention the lack of flesh. His bamboo walking stick was worn at the bottom. Who knows how long it has accompanied him?

The old man gripped a battered bowl in his hand. It seemed that the bowl was found on the street and had several cracks, yet he cherished it, as it was spotless, wiped clean every day with the sleeves of his tattered robes. The sound of the five coins rattling in the bowl, in conjunction with the tapping of his bamboo walking stick on the ground, announced his presence.

Why was he here? Was he lost? Yunyun didn’t have time to think because she started shuddering and had to wrap her hands around her body.

The old man stood before Li Qiye and raised his bowl. The sound of the coins hitting each other was akin to a rich man waving his coin pouch in front of a beggar.

However, he was the one begging: “Please give me something to eat.”

Li Qiye only stared at him.

“Please, I can’t remember my last meal…” The old beggar didn’t give up.

Li Qiye still didn’t respond.

Yunyun couldn’t bear to watch this and placed a bottle of nectar and chestnut into his bowl: “Here, this will keep you full for a long time.”

After eating this, a mortal would be satisfied for years to come. He wouldn’t need to beg for food anymore.

“Please, Sir…” The old beggar seemed to not see the food in his bowl, still raising it in front of Li Qiye repeatedly.

Yunyun was surprised at first but she was no fool. She realized that this old man came specifically for Li Qiye alone.

“I got nothing.” Li Qiye shook his head and waved his hand.

“I haven’t eaten anything in a long time…” The old beggar looked miserable and pitiful.

“Then die.” Li Qiye smiled.

Only a bastard would smile like this at a blind beggar - how evil and wretched.

“My little plot of land was so fertile and the crop was almost ready for harvest, now it’s flattened.” The old beggar lamented.

“Oh.” Li Qiye remarked nonchalantly.

“There’s nothing left, I can’t return anymore so please, give me food.” He pitifully said and won Yunyun’s sympathy.

“Nothing left? Not true” Li Qiye chuckled: “I should take one.”

Having said that, he reached into the bowl and took one coin again. This act stunned Yunyun.
