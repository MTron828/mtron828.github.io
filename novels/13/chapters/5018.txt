Chapter 5019: Scram

“Why?” Bloodfly’s voice remained unpleasant and creepy.

His aura differed from Truth Dao Lord. Anyone would want to be around the latter, the same couldn’t be said about him.

“Because you have sucked too much blood, whether it be dragon lords or corpses, sovereigns or evil fiends. The rotten stench is unbearable.” Li Qiye said.

Listeners were astounded by the sheer contempt displayed by him. Top masters couldn’t believe it.

Wild Dragon was domineering and Radiant Monarch was supreme. Alas, neither would dare to be this direct when speaking to Bloodfly. This was akin to a slap to the face.

“Buzz.” Bloodfly’s eyes flashed with a red glow, causing weaker cultivators and demons to feel a sharp pain in their chest.

Nonetheless, Li Qiye was right. He had sucked the blood of numerous beings and didn’t quite discriminate.

Li QIye waved his hand as if chasing a fly and said: “Don’t be angry now. Shadowrider is using your stench to hide. At first, I thought you were Shadowrider but after smelling your stench, there is no way you can be an assassin.”

“Young Noble Li, please choose your words better.” Golden Cicada King raised his voice since his commanding god was being insulted.

“Fine, I’ll leave then. Just know that no one else can solve the tablet.” Li Qiye stood up and said.

“You’re saying that you can solve it?” The angry Bloodfly didn’t expect this.

“Just a simple task.” Li Qiye smiled.

The dragon lords didn’t buy it because they saw the previous attempts.

“Hmph, even the power of the light and the flame of a true dragon couldn’t open it, what are you going to do?” Jun Cuican was the first to speak.

“Insignificant skills can’t open this ancestral power, know one’s limit.” Li Qiye glanced at him and said.

“Fellow Daoist, you seem to not know your own limit.” Radiant Monarch had pride in his holy affinity.

“Hahaha, I want to see what you have that is stronger than my true flames.” Wild Dragon snorted.

“Pure nonsense.” Swordgrasp Venerable already hated Li Qiye and hoped to steer the crowd in the same direction. It would be far easier to kill him then.

“Sigh, a bunch of frogs at the bottom of the well, can’t stop croaking.” Li Qiye said before yawning.

Everyone’s expression became ugly. They have dominated the lower continents for so long; this was a first experience for them.

“Perhaps I should take your head now.” Skystomper God’s bloodthirst intensified as his patience waned.

“Quiet.” Bloodfly said. His words pierced the automatic defense of these masters and forced them to take one step backward.

“You can really open this tablet?” He gazed at Li Qiye and said. This was the only thing on his mind.

“Not even a challenge.” Li Qiye responded.

“Good, do it and the two god sources will be yours. You may roam freely in Demon as well.” Bloodfly said.

“No need for that since I can roam freely right now already.” Li Qiye said: “Where did you get it?”

Bloodfly paused for a moment before answering: “Came across it by chance.”

“I see, I won’t be noisy if you don’t wish to speak. However, I have one condition.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Speak. Everything is on the table as long as you can open the tablet.” Bloodfly said.

Everyone wondered about the secret of the tablet in order to justify his easygoing attitude.

“If I open it, you need to get lost, as far as possible too so that I won’t be distracted by your stench.” Li Qiye said.

No one expected this condition. The demons and beasts glared at him because he was insulting their commanding god.

Bloodfly’s expression soured. He was being chased away like an annoying fly but he remained calm. Nonetheless, this calmness still terrified the crowd.

“Fine, if you open the tablet, I will temporarily leave Golden Cicada.” He actually endured the humiliation and accepted the demand.

This only served to increase everyone’s curiosity regarding the tablet. After all, this prestigious commanding god wasn’t known for his patience.

“There must be something going on.” Tendril King said with a hushed voice.

“I agree.” Radiant Monarch responded.

These top dragon lords couldn’t see the value of this tablet so they were confused.

“It’s a deal then.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It might be better not to open it, this seems ominous.” Ming Shi whispered, recalling what Truth Dao Lord had said.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Nothing’s more ominous than me.” Li Qiye smiled and glanced at Bloodfly while still speaking to Ming Shi: “A few like to think that they have everything under control, that their plan is working perfectly. Unfortunately, things usually go awry, efforts turn out to be in vain and lives are thrown away.”

Bloodfly’s eyes turned cold for a bit but he didn’t say anything.

“Young Noble, please start.” Golden Cicada hurried this along to prevent any potential conflict. He moved the tablet closer to Li Qiye.

Li Qiye gently rubbed it while thinking that it was still the same as before.

All eyes were on him since no one wanted to miss a single action.

Radiant Monarch’s group had tried only to fail. Thus, they were skeptical about his probability of success. There was no way he could perform better than Thousand-faced Sovereign who went all out.
