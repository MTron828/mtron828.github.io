Chapter 5715: Sacred Teacher’s Arrival

A youth appeared on the battlefield and became the center of attention despite his ordinary appearance. All eyes were on him, both combatants and spectators.

The lack of aura from him didn’t diminish the number of gasps. A grand display of power was unnecessary since everyone still got the impression that he was the supreme existence of this world.

“Sacred Teacher!” The defenders were ecstatic to see him, assured of victory regardless of Celestial Court’s plans.

“Sacred Teacher!” On the contrary, members of Celestial Court became startled. Even those who had never seen him before have heard of his terrifying legends.

He was a man with many titles - Sacred Teacher, Dark Hand, Butcher...

The number of people who despised him far outweighed those who appreciated his deeds.

“Buzz.” He released primordial light with his hand, shooting a beam through ten million miles. This immediately destroyed the entire army of specters, reducing them to particles.

The scene stirred the crowd, especially the ones from Celestial Court. Just one beam took down a mighty army.

Li Qiye took one step forward, alarming the horn and causing it to disappear.

Alas, its enigmatic teleportation couldn’t elude him. It didn’t take long before he caught it and destroyed the hidden formation.

“Boom!” The emperors and monarchs in charge of the empowering formation exploded.

“Ahh!” The explosion sent them flying, resulting in numerous injuries and deaths.

Eyes were wide open in astonishment. How could someone possibly be so strong?

Li Qiye gently stroked the horn and said: “I see, the remains of Divine Ancestor. I thought it had been reduced to nothingness back then, seems like someone purposely hid it and even used a heavenly scripture’s technique to turn it into this. Is it out of cruelty or hope?”

The horn was made from the bones of Divine Ancestor, the son of Trinity Ancestor.

When Trinity Ancestor left, Divine Ancestor was hunted down by others - Lord of Derivation, Primal Ancestor, Voracious Leviathan, and many more.

A single supreme overlord couldn’t overcome the odds. Everyone thought that he had been drained entirely, all of his essence robbed.

The only thing known to survive the process was the bone between his brows. His disciple kept it as a memento and a reminder - to seek revenge.

It turned out that someone else had gathered some remnant bones and used a technique belonging to a heavenly scripture to change it into this horn - a weapon capable of summoning the mightiest specters.

Few knew of this. At the very least, Just-once and the others had no idea despite being members of Celestial Court. Perhaps War Ancient God had an idea since he was a trusted member.

“Who gave you this horn? Your lord or the three immortals?” Li Qiye demanded an answer.

No one responded because this was their first time using this horn of death.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye gently channeled primordial light through the horn.

It immediately removed the aura of death. With that done, he forcefully removed the supreme chapter from the horn.

“Rumble!” The chapter issued terrifying dao explosions, creating an image of a heavenly palm capable of destroying all beneath.

It was more than enough to suppress imperial-level characters - a testament to the power of the horn’s creator.

Li Qiye found an answer and glanced at the horizon: “The inhumanity, to refine your son.”

The creator was none other than the mysterious guest of Celestial Court - Trinity Ancestor’s traitorous form. Nevertheless, he was still the father of Divine Ancestor.

When Trinity Ancestor’s inborn soul returned, he didn’t avenge his son. Instead, he found the person who hid these bones and took them to create the horn of death.

The mysterious guest clearly lost his humanity, offering himself to the darkness. He could throw away the epoch for his ambition.

An epoch required love from its creator to stay safe. Either that or the creator possessing an indomitable dao heart. Once this love was gone, that would spell the end of the epoch.

The corrupted form of Trinity Ancestor did something the majority of overlords couldn’t do. There was no returning from this abyss.

“Boom!” The world shook and everyone felt their chest being hit as Li Qiye crushed the supreme chapter with his bare hands.

“Clank!” His primordial laws appeared and coiled around the horn, slowly morphing it back to its original form.

Once he untwisted it and refined it properly, a skeleton appeared before everyone. He infused primordial energy, restoring a sliver of divinity to the bones. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was a glimmer in the darkness, always at risk of extinguishing. Nonetheless, it was also a symbol of hope. Perhaps one day, it would ignite again.
