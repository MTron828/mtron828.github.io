Chapter 4858: The Return Of The King

The old man’s breaths were in tune with the rhythm of heaven and earth. He seemed to be one with the world so when he stood there, he had an ethereal presence - almost untraceable.

Staring at him was akin to staring at the entire world at once, or at least that this was the feeling everyone had.

The boundless grand dao - perhaps this wasn’t describing the grand dao itself but an apex cultivator.

The unknown cultivator’s expression soured after seeing him: “Fellow Daoist, isn’t it time to drop the incessant and unnecessary pursuit?”

“That’s an interesting way of putting it. When I arrived at the treasure ground, I was welcomed by your ambush. Fortunately, I knew how to fight a little and managed to escape. Now I’m the incessant pursuer?”

“This is a misunderstanding that can’t be resolved in a few words. I do apologize.” The cultivator said.

“Tell that to my fist.” The old man said nonchalantly and made a fist.

“Boom!” The world seemed to be shrinking down - small enough to fit inside his fist.

This made those nearby lose balance and fall to the ground. Just this simple movement alone was incredible; no need for an activation of power.

Villains in the shadow gasped at his ability. Bloodsea Blade was astounded, thinking that this old man was unbeatable.

However, he had never met this powerful cultivator before. The guy wasn’t hiding his true appearance either.

First came the mysterious cultivator from the pine forest. Now, another unknown old man?

The first had no interest in fighting and immediately disappeared into the horizon. The latter frowned and wanted to pursue. However, he glanced over at Li Qiye first.

Li Qiye waved his hand and gave him permission to leave. He then took one step forward and gave chase.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The atmosphere calmed down again and the attention returned to Bloodsea Blade. The initiative was his once more since none could contest his saber.

“Death to all transgressors.” He uttered coldly.

No villains responded because they saw what happened to Rat God, Fallen King, and Nether Messenger. Even Mad Pyromancer only managed to flee, albeit with serious injuries.

“Go, hurry.” He told the guards.

“Thank you for your help, Senior. Our dynasty truly appreciates it.” Firerage and his men bowed deeply.

Though they didn’t understand the reason, they could tell that Bloodsea was determined to protect the dao lord’s corpse.

With that, the convoy swiftly coursed to Eight-stallion Dynasty again. Bloodsea was also following them, albeit in secrecy. With his escort, no villains along the way dared to attack.

Eventually, they finally saw the dynasty in a distance and heaved a sigh of relief.

“We did it, mission accomplished.” Firerage said sentimentally.

“Senior, we have arrived. The dynasty will never forget the kindness you have shown today.” Firerage bowed again. He knew that Bloodsea was still following them.

Bloodsea left without saying anything, satisfied with the result.

“Your Majesty, we’re home now.” Firerage came to the coffin and whispered. Tears streamed down his cheeks again.

The other guards felt the same pain. Whenever they traveled with His Majesty, they were always in high spirits, especially after a triumphant return. Memories of the past flashed in their mind, only serving to increase the sorrow.

“Your Highness, here we are.” Firerage told Li Qiye, still not wanting to be apart.

During the journey back, his main responsibility was protecting the coffin. Now, his new target was none other than Li Qiye. The future coronation included numerous perils.

Li Qiye looked up and observed the dynasty. It was rather different, lacking towering walls and palaces.

It was built in the center of nature among the mountain ranges and valleys. Buildings were erected among the ridges and peaks. Some were floating and fixated in place by dao laws.

Waterfalls poured down as if they came from an upper realm. Some mountains were tall enough to be hidden by mists and clouds. Chaos energies and dao laws were in abundance.

A few palaces looked rather special and had auspicious pulses as if immortals were cultivating inside. The cranes were free to roam about. Flood dragons could be seen as well among other wonderful beasts. Thus, Eight-stallion resembled a sect more than a traditional dynasty.

Nonetheless, knowledgeable cultivators who took the time to explore would find ruins everywhere.

In reality, this place used to be ancient ruins. Rumor has it that Eight-stallion Dao Lord came across this place during his conquest. He became excited and started building various temples and palaces here…

As time passed, he gained more followers and decided to start a dynasty, turning this place into a famous location in Chaos.

It was just as lively as any of the other lineage such as Primal, Maddened, or Hundred Races…

The dao lord harbored great ambition, leading many expeditions to expand the border and quell the chaos.

He alone changed the landscape of Chaos, giving it a brand-new atmosphere. Although he couldn’t truly change this lawless land, the dynasty he created became a special pillar of stability and order.

Its fame wasn’t only limited to Chaos. Even those from White Stone and Fragmentation have heard of it before.

Of course, it was also the thorn in the villains’ eyes, especially Wild Dynasty. Unfortunately, Wild couldn’t compete in the past. Now, it was no longer the same.

“His Majesty has returned!” Firerage stood in front of the entrance and roared.

“Your Majesty!” The quietly-waiting members of the dynasty finally got on their knees. They were already dressed in white ceremonial outfits meant for mourning.
