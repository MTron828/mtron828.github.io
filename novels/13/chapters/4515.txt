Chapter 4516: Supreme Black Card

A while ago, people already viewed Alchemy Child’s bid as too aggressive. Now, there was no word to describe Li Qiye’s raise.

“Game’s over.” A big shot from a prestigious clan murmured: “What’s the point in bidding? Just let him make the final bid and get this over with.”

“Seems that way, no point bidding with the brat involved.” A famous character said helplessly.

They all wasted so much time making small bids just for this guy to jump in and give them zero chance of winning.

“30,000,000…” Cloudgrasp and the eastern cultivator smiled wryly and gave up.

Judging by Li Qiye’s nonchalant demeanor, this might only be the starting bid. No one wanted to give it a shot.

What if Li Qiye were to suddenly give up and then they would have to pay the ridiculous price just like Cloudgrasp Elder not long ago?

The only one left still thinking about it was Alchemy Child. In terms of resources, maybe True Immortal would be able to contend.

“30,000,000. You bidding?” Jian Ming gestured provocatively. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Alchemy Child’s expression kept on changing. This was pushing close to his limit.

“31,000,000.” He gritted his teeth and went for it.

“40,000,000.” Li Qiye said without a care in the world.

“40…” The crowd felt as if Li Qiye could crush any of them in terms of sheer financial prowess.

“What kind of auction is this?! He’s just here to cause trouble!” Alchemy Child bellowed.

This made Li Qiye chuckle while Jian Ming stared at the youth with disdain: “Isn’t it obvious by now that there is no rule against a high bid? Plus, having no limit is the whole point of an auction. Just accept that you can’t play this game meant for the rich.”

He was perfectly right. Though this annoyed the crowd, there was nothing they could do.

“This is 40,000,000 dao lord refined jades we’re talking about.” One youth whispered: “He already spent so many heavenly sovereign jades before, can he actually pay the sum? I don’t think many great powers can.”

A few big shots heard this and stared at Li Qiye. The majority didn’t think this was a problem because of the auction’s guarantee.

Alchemy Child had no choice but to latch onto this: “He still needs to have a guarantee or a deposit to make a bid this large. Our sect can put down 20,000,000 dao lord refined jades right now, can he do it? We need to prevent any complications!”

They came prepared with dao lord jades but Li Qiye might not. Some big shots wouldn’t bring currencies along and would just settle with the auction house at a later date.

However, Li Qiye didn’t need to defend himself because the old man from the grotto immediately spoke: “As mentioned previously, Young Noble Li has unlimited credit at our auction house so there is no need to worry. However, since people have still been asking, we will give him our supreme black card.”

Having said that, the old man put down a shiny black card on Li Qiye’s table.

“A black card…” The knowledgeable big shots smiled wryly after seeing this.

This was the ultimate symbol in Grotto Courtyard. The holder would be able to participate in any auction on top of borrowing refined jades up to an agreed limit.

In this case, Li Qiye had unlimited credit meaning that he could use all of the auction house’s resources.

“They only give out a few cards in each era yet Li Qiye has one now?” Someone with knowledge regarding this card said. It was insane how much the auction trusted Li Qiye.

Alchemy Child’s complexion turned red then white, speechless. He had heard about the black cards before because in fact, his sect had one too. It was in the possession of a peerless ancient ancestor, not his master.

Therefore, his argument to stop Li Qiye no longer worked since the guy had a black card now.

“Now can you stop accusing people? There are plenty of rich cultivators in this world outside of your sect.” Jian Ming stared contemptuously at him and said.

“You!” The youth’s face became unsightly.

“40,000,000. Are you going to bid or are you giving up?” Jian Ming went on.

“Is this a challenge to True Immortal?” The youth then asked.
