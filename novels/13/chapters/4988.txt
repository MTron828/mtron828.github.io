Chapter 4989: Chillglare Hawk

No one would believe that Shadowrider came from Demon. After all, humans believed that assassination was a learned art above the capabilities of barbarous demons.

This wasn’t to say that there weren’t stronger demons than Shadowrider. It was just a matter of requiring finesse and skill.

Goldcrest contemplated this matter and came up with numerous ideas. He wondered which branch the assassin came from but then again, this couldn’t be possible.

After all, worshipping a branch meant being stuck in Demon. This place was both a paradise and a prison.

The deity branch was no different than an iron shackle on the neck, always locking the followers inside the mountains.

Goldcrest was aware of two exceptions currently - himself and Wild Dragon. He had a special badge passed down from his ancestors. Rumor has it that it had something to do with the divine nest.

Alas, there was a time limit for him, unlike Wild Dragon.

“Screech!” The group suddenly heard a sharp screech from above, capable of intimidating the most courageous cultivators.

“Rumble!” Weaker demons and beasts nearby fell to the ground, breaking many branches and rocks in the process. A few colossal demons caused violent quakes from their sudden movement, unable to handle the mere screech of this creature.

In fact, some creatures actually died from the pressure.

Ming Shi and Yunyun were powerful but their defenses crumbled. They tumbled backward, nearly falling to the ground. Fortunately for them, Li Qiye exuded rays to protect their mind.

Goldcrest had to activate his faith power. A tiger roar could be heard as its power protected him. Nonetheless, he still staggered three steps backward. The only person unaffected was Li Qiye.

“What an aura…” Ming Shi became frightened.

They have met five-fruit dragon lords before but didn’t feel anything like this.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Chillglare Hawk!” Goldcrest took a deep breath and gazed into the sky.

He saw a massive figure crossing the air like a shooting star, leaving a river of particles behind. After it was long gone, one could see the outline of a hawk. It flew faster than the speed of sound, already long gone before its screech came to the ground.

Weaker beings without innate protection from cultivation were actually pierced by the sonic waves.

“Such a mighty hawk.” Yunyun and Ming Shi took a deep breath.

“Of course, few are stronger than him. He is only second to Peacock Monarch in Feather and might become the next commanding god.”

“No wonder.” Yunyun murmured.

Another series of explosions came, prompting the group to look up once more. They saw a blue wave engulfing the sky and then an inferno right after it.

The first was a refreshing feeling while the latter was nothing but discomfort from the heat.

“Elemental King is here too?” Yunyun became startled after seeing the conflicting elements working together.

“He’s still alive, wow.” Goldcrest added: “I heard he was famous alongside Maddened God. He’s an ancient ancestor from Ice-fire Palace now.” 

“He’s actually stronger.” Yunyun said.

“At least the people from Ice-fire Palace aren’t as crazy as the other branches.” Ming Shi commented.

The public perceived Maddened Dao as a crazy lineage. It didn’t matter how strong they were, all of them would eventually go mad with time.

For example, the founder of Maddened Sacred Ground - Maddened Conqueror - reached a wonderful level after cultivating this dao to the extreme. Alas, he couldn’t escape the accursed fate.

“I agree, the palace is definitely the most normal out of them.” Yunyun said. This aligned with the lower continents’ view.

This dao has been around for a long time, successfully producing many top cultivators. The problem was that all of them would go crazy and violent toward the end.

There was one exception - Coldflame Conqueror who somehow managed to restrain the frenzied flames and went on to create Ice-fire Palace.

Maddened Sacred Ground and Ice-fire Palace were behemoths of their dao lineage. The latter was usually in charge because they could relatively maintain their sanity.

“Whoosh!” The conversation was interrupted by a green vine crossing through the air. It resembled a green vine being drawn masterfully on an empty canvas. On top of the beautiful vine was a cultivator.

“Tendril King!” Yunyun shouted.
