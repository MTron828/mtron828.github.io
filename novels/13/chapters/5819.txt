Chapter 5819: Primal Anima

The limit-breaker road must be taken or one would be stuck as an emperor forever. Although this realm was considered unbeatable in the regular world, apex emperors understood this was merely the beginning.

Today, they had the privilege of witnessing multiple primal animas, dispelling the previous confusion and lighting up the path.

“Boom!” The three immortals’ power erupted and so did their bloodlines’ effects.

Heaven Authority, Divine Eternal, and Devil Bestowment - the bloodlines were named after them. Although they weren’t the source of the bloodlines, they were the first known carriers, hence the naming convention.

Heaven Authority’s effect included suppression. It soared and surrounded Li Qiye, attempting to subjugate his bloodline to weaken his dao power.

Devil Bestowment had a sealing effect, capable of stopping all dao mysteries and profundities. It tried to prevent him from deriving the dao and most importantly, sealing his primordial light.

Divine Eternal assaulted from a temporal perspective, intending to reduce his vitality. Each strand of time had a corrosive nature, encompassing an endless length of time.

Suppression, sealing, and corroding - the combined assault of the bloodlines was unstoppable, not to mention the weapons that came before it.

Spectators had a hard time dealing with this since their bloodlines were affected by the suppression. This internal phenomenon made them feel their legs growing weak, especially those from the three great races who fell to the ground, pale.

All along, they usually did the suppressing to weaker cultivators. In fact, stronger emperors couldn’t make them feel this way either. Alas, the suppression of the bloodline proved too much to endure.

“Rumble!” Li Qiye became increasingly smaller. This was not a matter of size but rather, their plan was effective. He was being pushed into one dimension after another.

They knew that killing him was impossible. Only the five overlords behind them working together had a chance. Therefore, banishing him became the only option.

Of course, his return was only a matter of time given his power. Nevertheless, this would buy Celestial Court more time.

“Rumble!” As time passed, the banishment continued and Li Qiye almost disappeared.

“Are they actually doing it?” Spectators thought that this plan might work.

“Boom!” As they were on the verge of banishing him entirely, he seemingly woke up from the hypnosis and broke free from the suppression.

Putting him to sleep was the only way to imprison him; overpowering was not an option. Unfortunately, his primordial light erupted with his awakening.

He raised his hand, causing violent quakes throughout Elder Galaxy. He was banished through countless dimensions but with one push, he pressed all of them together. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This created a layered wall of unimaginable weight. His target was none other than the three immortals.

Although they have fully activated their primal anima and bloodlines, this still couldn’t stop the wall built by countless dimensions.

“Bam!” This sent them crashing through the ground, blood spraying wildly through the broken bones and pulverized flesh.

They still heard a constant rumble as the wall showed no sign of stopping.

“Watch out!” Their loyal allies shouted in astonishment.

Alas, they had no strength to stop the sheer weight of the dimensional wall.

“Clank!” The sound of a sword echoed through the heavens - a slash severing eternity while appearing so simple and devoid of sword energy.
