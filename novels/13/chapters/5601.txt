Chapter 5602: Incompetent Bunch

“Sacred Teacher, your return is indeed an earth-shattering event. It’s just that this is a different era.” War took a deep breath and said.

“Indeed, but my view on the changes might differ from yours.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What is your view, Sacred Teacher?” War paused for a moment before asking.

“So do you believe Celestial Court will take over now?” Li Qiye answered with a question.

“For certain.” War said: “No one can stop its momentum, not even you, Sacred Teacher. Its light will shine on all races for eternity.”

“Interesting, I have a different opinion though.” Li Qiye said.

“Please elaborate, Sacred Teacher.” War had a serious expression.

“At the very least, your eternal light will not exist because not long from now, I will visit Celestial Court and crush it.” Li Qiye said.

His nonchalant tone still struck listeners like lightning. All eyes were on him. In fact, members of The People didn’t believe him, and this went double for those from Celestial Court.

The latter naturally understood its power since they came from there. Li Qiye was not the first to make this declaration.

The duck egg buyer had led a coalition army against Celestial Court. This ended with total withdrawal. Few in history were stronger than this apex conqueror who was not alone either.

They recalled how Li Qiye sent Sanctity Conqueror flying just now. Would this powerful cultivator be an actual threat?

“Sacred Teacher, your style is still the same.” War laughed and said: “We will be eagerly waiting then, let’s see if you will perish first or us.”

He then bowed and said: “We shall be taking our leave today.”

“Wanting to leave just like that? Nothing in this world comes so easily.” Li Qiye said.

Upon hearing these words, War’s eyes flashed menacingly as he answered: “Sacred Teacher, you wish to single-handedly fight my armies?”

“No.” Li Qiye shook his head: “It’ll be a massacre, not a fight. I’ll start with your bunch first to sharpen my blade.”

Members of the armies had an ugly expression. Although his power was apparent, they didn’t fear him. Given their commanders and potential formations, they could hunt any existence.

“Sacred Teacher, are you sure?!” War roared.

“Don’t worry, I will spare you so that you can deliver a message to the old geezers, tell them to prepare for demise.” Li Qiye said.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Drums! Heavenly descent!” Starseer Conqueror shouted before taking control of a celestial formation.

Bright arrays appeared beneath the feet of his armies.

“Rumble!” Beams descended with the purest concentration of power.

The commanders worked together to create an ocean of stars, connecting all the individual cultivators.

“Boom!” A resplendent giant appeared in the sky, consisting of countless stars and armies.

It grew a total of thirty-six light wings. Various cycles and affinities rotated around this colossal creature.

“Celestial Court’s momentum.” Six-finger and the others gasped.

The armies didn’t need to use this grand formation to rout them earlier. Now, the blessed armies entered the special momentum and became a part of Celestial Court.

“Die!” The winged giant’s roar caused the realms to quake violently. This extended to the rest of the immortal continent.

“Boom!” It placed its palms together to channel an ultimate pulse.

“Celestial Punish!” The momentum seemed to be representing the high heaven itself, exerting judgment upon all living beings.

It had a destructive nature similar to heavenly tribulations. Imperial cultivators trembled in horror, unable to resist.

This pulse was the manifestation of Celestial Court’s will and momentum, empowered by the great armies.

However, Li Qiye didn’t try to dodge the pulse.

“Shall we have some fun?” He smiled at the nearby cloud.

Before it could react, he lifted it directly above his head.

“Boom!” Nothing could withstand this pulse. The fabrics of reality and dao crumbled instantly.

It struck the cloud first and all spectators thought that Li Qiye was finished. Everything was about to be reduced to ashes.

Contrary to their expectation, the cloud somehow withstood the dreadful pulse.
