Chapter 4749: Cosmic Trap Formation

Those who recognized the formation took a deep breath after hearing the name.

“I heard that only dao lords can escape this formation.” A big shot whispered.

“Yes, this is it.” A demon king nodded: “This formation protected True Immortal for many eras. After all, plenty of invincible characters in history were eager to challenge True Immortal. They ended up dying this formation but most importantly, it wasn’t presided over by the five Sky’s End ancestors.”

After its decline, numerous powers coveted their resources, wanting to destroy True Immortal and take their ancestral ground. Unfortunately, the majority either died trying or returned with grievous losses.

In this case, the formation was far more frightening since it was under the control of the Sky’s End ancestors. Everyone thought that only dao lords would be able to survive.

It was created by Worldraiser Dao Lord specifically for his generals. Therefore, its power was truly shown when used by the five ancestors.

Moreover, this cauldron was a patrimony weapon serving as the foundation for the formation. Li Qiye was absolutely facing the Cosmic Trap Formation at its strongest state.

“A little interesting.” Li Qiye glanced around and chuckled while stuck inside.

He clenched his fist and slightly moved the immortal gemstone. It immediately let out a terrifying amount of energy in the form of dao flames. They shone so brightly and resembled two fiery wings.

“Boom!” Everyone felt the emergence of a massive storm.

The gales blew by and terrified them, prompting them to scream.

“Ahh!” Some felt that they were being torn apart.

At the exact moment when Li Qiye initiated the gemstone, the stages of the formation started as well. The celestial maelstrom beneath Li Qiye started rotating and sucking in the dao flames.

The runes and symbols of the formation became brighter as a result. The cauldron held by the five ancestors seemed to be the receiver of this absorbed power.

Sure enough, the fiery wings disappeared right away, looking like a defeated falcon.

“It’s working.” An ancient spectator shuddered.

The crowd saw how the formation instantly absorbed Li Qiye’s power. Therefore, this made it impossible for him to channel enough energy to break free, reducing him to a helpless mortal scholar.

“I can see why it’s so famous.” An expert cheered.

The members of True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao finally saw hope. After all, Li Qiye won every single engagement thus far. The conquerors had no answer for his methods.

This formation was the first thing to work against Li Qiye. Moreover, he had numerous enemies circling him as well.

“This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The formation is top-notch.” An ancient ancestor said with a serious expression.

The alliance members had a relieved expression. As long as the formation could absorb the power of the gemstone, they still had a chance of winning and killing Li Qiye.

“Now!” The spider god and the river demon shouted in unison.

The spider god let out a shrill scream. “Poof!” He released a green mist and suddenly became liquid.

A jade spider melting down looked rather frightening. In the next moment, the liquid expanded like a gushing spring.

“Ocean of Annihilation!” A holy cultivator from the east shouted.

This technique turned the jade spider into an ever-expanding liquid, capable of extinguishing any cultivator.

Rumor has it that he had used it to wipe out a sect in a single night. Not even a little piece of flesh was left behind. It was as if the sect had never existed. Such a dreadful move was rarely used by the spider himself.

As for the river demon, he waved his banner and summoned wailing spirits. They immediately fused with the spider’s ocean. He himself entered the ocean while chanting inscrutable words.

“Rumble!” The sky suddenly turned red as if a calamity was incoming.

“Fiend Curse.” A demon king from the east trembled in fear.

All of this culminated in a shadow behind Li Qiye, seemingly wanting to embrace and assimilate him. A black and fiendish liquid appeared above his back and spread all over him with extreme speed.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
