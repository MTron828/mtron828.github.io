Chapter 5632: Squirming Mass


“Boom!” In a sea far away from Thousand Emperor Island, thunderous bolts descended with a tint of blood.

Black clouds enveloped the sky with flashes of lightning and blood-red flashes. It seemed as if numerous blood vessels were spreading throughout the clouds, extending to the far reaches of heaven and hell.

As the bloody lines continued to spread, it looked like a monster was being born.

“Over there.” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed.

“Lightning Realm has been showing up more often after Grand Dao War. It didn’t look ominous like this before, it seems to be alive with all of these bloody phenomena.” She said.

“A transformation, certainly.” Li Qiye gazed at the black clouds.

“It might have something to do with High Heaven Aegis.” She said softly: “When they built the domain back then, a particular bloodline was very useful. I wonder what changed after the war.”

“A bloodline link causing a disaster.” He saw some clues and commented: “This pertains to an ancient mystery.”

“It is connected to the existence who can create life, right?” She thought about some legends that couldn’t be verified. 

As an apex cultivator, she knew stories and secrets that would frighten others.

“Yes, and the original bloodline as well.” He said.

“Will this cause issues for High Heaven Aegis? The emperors connected into a branch, resulting in a bloodline harmonization.” She frowned in response.

“I’ll take a look.” He said.

“Should I tag along for this?” She asked.

“No, you’ll be needed here.” He shook his head.

“Very well, Your Excellency.” She took a deep breath and stared at him: “I will keep on working hard to not let you down.”

“I know.” He said: “You must try to break through if you are determined to come with me. The current you is not enough, you’ll become food.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Yes.” She promised.

He smiled and hugged her again before crossing the ocean toward Lightning Realm.

Crackles detonated all around him as he entered the gloomy area. This was akin to entering a thunderous underworld. Tiny arcs traveled with a red glow. They flashed and looked like pulsating blood vessels. In a sense, the domain resembled the heart of a colossal creature. 

The ocean below was illuminated by the red glow, looking eerily just like blood. Visitors would get the impression that countless living beings have died here; their souls and blood remained in the sanguine ocean.

Threats of lightning came from above while ghastly hands could reach out of the ocean to pull down victims. 

The realm could sense any intruder and intimidate them with flashing arcs. Instead of blowing someone to smithereens, an invasion ensued next.

Tiny lightning bolts flowed on the visitors and issued faint crackles. The blood affinity on the bolts would try to drill into the body and grow from there.

This happened to Li Qiye as well, becoming fully engulfed by the red lightning currents. They squirmed and trembled, intending to pierce his skin.

They gave the impression of being blood parasites, capable of entering from any part of a living being.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye raised his hand and gathered the invading currents into a single mass.

This mass was terrifying, seemingly made from thin and long blood tendrils being pressed together into a ball.

“Boom!” It suddenly erupted like an exploding planet. Countless lightning pulses aimed straight for Li Qiye.

He placed his palms together and contained the pulses in the center. His suppression easily stopped the rampaging explosion, akin to him reducing an exploding sun down to a deflating ball. 

“Rumble!” Lightning Realm didn’t take this kindly and launched an actual assault.

The sheer number of lightning bolts could make an emperor or monarch tremble in horror, unable to stand straight.

“Buzz.” A primordial light appeared to shield Li Qiye, nullifying the lightning bolts.

The realm seemed to know that it was facing a mighty enemy and the assault intensified. This was enough to drive anyone out of its territory.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye strolled forward while being protected by the primordial barrier.
