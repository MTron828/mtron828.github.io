Li Qiye focused on the grand scheme of things, even the stars above.

There were many solitary peaks in the plateau instead of gathering in one place like a mountain range. One was barren while another might be filled with trees, gurgling streams, and wondrous waterfalls...

They left behind various tales. Most were believed to be golems at the two atavism stages.

The true atavism would turn the golem into a rock sinking into the ground. This entity would then gain the blessing of heaven and earth and become gigantic, eventually emerging as a peak or mountain.

Of course, some refuted this phenomenon. They said that these mountains and peaks were simply created with uncanny workmanship and weren’t actually golems.

All in all, the plateau was filled with mysteries and questions. Li Qiye was staring at one of them, a spectacle named Stonewind Canyon.

It was one of the largest creations in this area, also the largest puzzle. This canyon stretched across the entire plateau. Its source and end were both unclear.

The only consensus here was its incredible, immeasurable size. It was as if some powerful force split the plateau in half, resulting in the canyon. The area below was its own world with lakes and internal valleys, plains and mountain ranges...

Ultimately, people didn’t know how this area was formed.

One speculation stated that it wasn’t there back in the Nine Worlds Epoch. Because of this, some believed that it was created during the great disaster where heavenly corpses rained down from above. One of them smashed into the ground and left behind Stonewind Canyon.

Others disagreed. This group asserted that the canyon used to be an old and magical great vein. Unfortunately, the destruction of the nine worlds tore apart the vein. Its power erupted and created a new landscape.

Another popular belief hypothesized that there used to be an evil land here, sealed. The power of this evil land was stimulated by the overwhelming destruction, creating the canyon. This land could still be here, unaware by all.

Verifying these claims wasn’t possible and didn’t truly matter because the canyon was there. Moreover, every once in a while, some astonishing events would happen here.

“Stonewind Canyon.” Li Qiye sighed while looking at this dragon-like canyon, seemingly an indelible wound left from the great destruction: “What actually happened here?”

He then entered the canyon. The inside wasn’t as barren as one would expect given the tales about this place.

In reality, it was vibrant and brimming with life, consisting of oases and interesting ruins. Even farms and villages could be seen. It looked like life has taken over this area in recent eras.

However, as one delved deeper into the place, they would find something different. The villages in the inner regions have fallen. A few were completely desolate with only statues or rocks left behind. Some were half-buried in the ground.

It was apparent that these villages used to be the abodes of golems. The lack of people meant that the villagers have chosen the path of atavism. They turned into rocks and statues; some fully completed the process and disappeared from the world.

Of course, a decent number of villages still had inhabitants. The villagers were slowly turning into stone; a few body parts here and there. They would only come out to find food but normally, they cultivated the path of atavism.

Very few were actually prosperous with golems. This was a sign of the popularity of atavism.

As a result, the canyon had thousands of villages yet still looked abandoned. In reality, one could treat this place as a miniature study of the entire plateau.

The home of the golems in Eight Desolaces lacked people and prosperity due to their race’s chosen path.

After careful observation, the only thing that every village had was a stone pillar, no exception.

Li Qiye naturally caught this as he strolled through them.

“Golems.” Li Qiye started recalling how amazing this race used to be. It had plenty of Immortal Emperors along with magnificent kingdoms and sects.

Today, they were disappearing from the world. Eventually, one would be hard-pressed to find a single one.

This didn’t mean that this race was heading towards extinction. On the contrary, this was a different path for the sake of survival by hiding from the current situation.

Of course, outsiders couldn’t judge whether atavism was correct or not. The golems themselves chose this path because they thought that it would lead to the best outcome.

Li Qiye continued onward and saw a gurgling creek. At the bottom were many stones gathered here. They must have flown down from upstream. These stones have been washed by the gentle current for millions of years.

He sat down patiently to look at the creek. There was another - a youth standing in the water and choosing stones.

In terms of human age, this golem youth looked around twelve or so, standing as high as an adult’s waist.

He had a rather-round figure not because he was fat but rather because he was transforming into stone. There were no sharp edges and corners, only smooth lines.

This was the case for his arms and legs as well. They were round and fingerless. To be precise, the youth was made from six circular rocks placed together. This resulted in a funny yet cute appearance.

Despite his appearance, he was rather agile and fast as he looked for stones.

He eventually noticed Li Qiye sitting on the shore with his round and black eyes.

“You’re an outsider.” He tilted his head and became curious.

“Yes. What’s your name?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Shi Wawa.” He stared at Li Qiye, a rare guest in these parts. [1]

“Where are the others?” Li Qiye noticed that he had put many stones into his pouch regardless of their quality.

“I’m the only one left in the village.” He wasn’t afraid of strangers and innocently smiled.

A smiling golem at this stage looked strange enough to surprise first-time spectators. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Li Qiye found this to be quite common. Many villages were like this.

“I’m busy right now.” Wawa continued looking for more stones.

1. Shi = stone, Wawa = baby, small child, doll. I thought about translating it as just Baby but maybe it wouldn’t be right. Not sure if this is a nickname or an actual name without context. Pinyin is the safe play here
