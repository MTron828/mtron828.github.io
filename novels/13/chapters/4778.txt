Chapter 4779: Courting Death

“So I should share my heavenly treasure with the rest of the world?” Li Qiye seemed amused by Cosmic Lord’s assertion.

Alas, his smile and casual tone still horrified the crowd.

“It is a type of natural resource. Even if you do not wish to share, at least show it and broaden everyone’s horizon.” Cosmic Lord responded.

Many started sweating for him due to his unparalleled audacity.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, the world shall sing songs of your deed today.” Enveloping Monarch joined in.

The crowd exchanged glances and thought that this couldn’t just be a coincidence. Nonetheless, the ancestors didn’t understand these two’s end goals.

They were mere ants speaking to a supreme existence. Li Qiye could kill them with a single flick. Most importantly, they knew this themselves so why would they continue to provoke him? They didn’t look like they were tired of living.

They carefully thought about it and couldn’t come up with an ace card capable of challenging Li Qiye.

A while ago, people might bring up True Immortal’s monarchs and Three Thousand Dao’s Dao Sanqian.

This would certainly dominate anyone but unfortunately, they were facing the person standing on top of the world - Li Qiye. Their sects weren’t enough since he could wipe them out. Sure, the heavenly treasure was tempting but it had an unbeatable master now.

“Ah, everyone just wants to take a look? Fine, those who wish to do so, come closer.” Li Qiye’s eyes shifted from the two to the rest of the crowd.

Spectators immediately avoided his gaze, completely horrified. Even the ancient ancestors trembled afterward and lowered their head. They didn’t have the courage to look straight at him, let alone come closer.

The two leading cultivators, Cosmic Lord and Enveloping Monarch, weren’t enough to rally the crowd against Li Qiye. They preferred to live instead.

“Seems like you two are mistaken, they’re not interested.” Li Qiye smiled.

The two have expected this scenario so they weren’t caught off guard.

“They do not dare to speak, we are speaking on their behalf.” Cosmic Lord smiled.

“Just who is giving you the courage to provoke me at this point? Don’t tell me you think you are actually qualified to provoke me?” Li Qiye smirked.

Everyone thought that he was merely speaking the truth at this point; this was no longer an issue of arrogance.

“We are merely asking on behalf of the world, this isn’t a provocation, Young Noble.” Cosmic Lord remained calm.

His composure and courage actually impressed the crowd. They could see why he was once the leader of a world alliance.

“I wonder if you possess unmatched courage or just blind confidence for your backers. If it’s the latter, you don’t have long left in this world.”

“Thank you for your praise, Young Noble. I toil for everyone else.” Cosmic Lord bowed slightly.

The once-respected Cosmic Lord was viewed as a plague at this point. None wanted to be involved with him since they didn’t want to die and bring their sect down with them.

They knew that these two weren’t here for their sake. Benevolence and generosity weren’t at play here, only personal goals and motives.

“Seems like you two don’t think I will kill.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Perhaps I should make an example out of you now.”

Having said that, he took one step forward and released an invincible aura while narrowing his eyes.

“Rumble!” Spectators including ancient ancestors helplessly fell to their knees, unable to withstand his aura.
