People assumed Li Qiye was hiding in his room out of fear. Bai Jianchan’s female fans certainly thought so.

They thought it was ridiculous that he would be brought up in the same breath as Bai Jianchan - one was perfect while the other mediocre. One noble daughter said with disdain: “He’s probably ashamed of his inferiority. Meeting someone like Young Lord Bai will destroy his confidence, too humiliating.”

“He’s not leaving his hole after hearing about Young Lord Bai.” Another lady from a prestigious clan added.

On the other hand, a few ancestors had better insight on this matter.

“He’s not afraid of seeing guests, it has to be about cultivation.” One of them mused.

“It could be to understand the treasures too. His cultivation might not be enough to use the imperial weapons but don’t forget about the phoenix’s legacies. He has the right bloodline.” An influential elder said with a serious tone.

“Right, his bloodline is ordinary, that’s an immeasurable advantage. Others might not be able to do anything with those legacies right away but it won’t be hard for him.” An expert who has seen Li Qiye’s power back in Fire Domain said.

Many knew how Li Qiye killed 100,000 men from Yin Yang using the phoenix trueflame without putting in any effort. Thus, these legacies were immensely powerful, definitely not inferior to any dao lord weapon.

If Li Qiye could control these legacies and use them to the limit, he would become quite frightening.

“Hmm, with perfect mastery, a Silver Caparace like him might be able to kill sacred physique cultivators - truly unbelievable.” An ancestor shuddered after thinking about this.

Everyone wanted his treasures but in the case of success, his power would soar. It would be extremely difficult to rob him even outside of Fire Domain. They found that their initial plan became increasingly harder with time.

“Hurry up with the negotiation and go to war.” Numerous ancestors shared this thought. Time was not on their side because Li Qiye was growing stronger.

By afternoon, their anxiety was interrupted by a loud explosion. The entire city quaked to everyone’s astonishment. It seemed to be a palm strike breaking down a rock.

“Good!” Some ancestors celebrated since this seemed to be a bad sign for the negotiation.

“It’s not good, the negotiation between Young Lord Bai and the ancestors was a failure.” This news traveled quickly.

“No, it’s great.” The ancestors became ecstatic akin to finding warm shelter during winter.

“Young Lord Bai and Pearlstone Saintess have a scheduled match.” This news came next.

“What?” The ancestors’ expression changed upon hearing this.

“Young Lord Bai is the one who said it.” The messenger elaborated: “If he were to win, then she’ll have to marry him. A draw or a loss on his part will mean that the two sects no longer have anything to do with each other.”

“Seems like Yin Yang doesn’t want to go all-out.” The ancestors understood. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yin Yang Gate was strong but in a full-scale war, the gains just weren’t there. It would be a pyrrhic victory.

Thus, this request from Bai Jianchan was logical. Of course, the ancestors didn’t wish to see this at all.

“What about Li Qiye?” Most cared about Li Qiye because of the treasures.

“Young Lord Bai’s condition is that if he were to win, Ancestral would have to hand over Li Qiye too but they refused. However, if Li Qiye were to leave on his own, Ancestral would not interfere.”

Bai Jianchan’s goals became clear. First, win the saintess again and lessen the conflict between the two sects. Next, think about how to capture Li Qiye.

“He’s a wily youngster.” The ancestors approved of Jianchan’s plan. This was indeed the best-case scenario for Yin Yang.

However, many female cultivators felt indignation about this matter.

“Hmph, this saintess, why does she keep opposing the young lord?” One of them angrily said.

“She must be blind to pick Li Qiye over Young Lord Bai, it’s throwing away a beautiful marriage.” Another noble daughter said.

“I rather be Young Lord Bai’s concubine or a bed-warming maid than Li Qiye’s wife. Only a fool would pick him. Everyone wants to marry Young Lord Bai, I don’t understand this saintess at all.” A princess joined in.

Female cultivators began denouncing the saintess and Li Qiye. The latter seemed to not be worth a single coin in their eyes.

As for Li Qiye, he had no idea that he had become the public’s target of hate. In the last few days, he has been thinking about the thing left behind by Immortal Assailant Emperor.

After numerous analytical attempts, he finally figured out something. He decided to leave since this wasn’t the right time to act on it.

“Creak.” The tightly-shut door finally opened.

“Young Master, you’re finally out.” Shi Wawa has been keeping an eye out and stood up to greet Li Qiye. The youth was worried about him until now.

“It’s nothing.” Li Qiye stretched and smiled after seeing the youth’s serious expression.

“That’s good to hear.” Shi Wawa revealed an innocent smile. He was pure and cared about anyone who treated him well.

“Hmm, Young Master, that young lord from Yin Yang is here.” He then got to the point.

“And?” Li Qiye looked up at the sun, seemingly enjoying the warm rays.

“I, I heard that Miss Shi will have to fight him. She’ll have to marry him if she loses.” The youth added.

He thought that the saintess should marry Li Qiye because she was too nice to him already. It would be strange if she were to marry anyone else.

“Oh?” Li Qiye smiled.

Shi Qingjian had just heard the news from a fellow disciple and came over right away, looking quite relaxed.

“Greetings, Young Master. I hope you had a fruitful session.” She bowed her head.

“Don’t bother with these boring conventions.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Qingjian heard his command but still bowed.

“I heard you want to fight against the young lord from Yin Yang?” Li Qiye asked.
