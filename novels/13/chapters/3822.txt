Chapter 3823: One Smash

The spectators felt themselves being refined by the terrible murderous strands emanating from the sword tyrant - not the best feeling to have.

They thought that this technique would do more than just kill Li Qiye. The remnant waves would inflict untold damage on the land.

Nonetheless, they still watched with bated breath, wanting to see how Li Qiye would deal with this technique. Most youths weren’t so optimistic.

Only the big shots from the last generations were eager to see Li Qiye’s heaven-defying methods against a top cultivator. Perhaps he would summon a peerless treasure.

“Come.” Li Qiye taunted the swordsman with his hammer: “Just one move is all I need.”

Sword Hero’s complexion turned red as he trembled with rage. He has been holding back all this time but every man had a limit.

The crowd exchanged glances, thinking that no one could stay calm after the repeated insults in a public setting.

“Junior, I will let you experience a fate worse than death.” Sword Hero uttered each word in a menacing manner - a testament to his hatred for Li Qiye.

“Clank!” The massive sword became resplendent with a unique glow. It had a yellow hue as if it was the reflection from the water of the Yellow River.

“Die!” He roared and unleashed the accumulated intents with the force of a tsunami.

The energies with their earth origin began to corrode space itself to the horror of the crowd.

Thousands and thousands of evil swords appeared in the slash, eventually culminating into an inescapable net. The technique broke the chaos, severed the yin and yang, annihilated space, and obliterated the stars.

Muddleness took over as death and darkness descended on the world.

“Incredible!” Both the young and old shouted after seeing the power of this move. They thought that no one should be able to survive it. Ashes would be the only thing left of Li Qiye.

“Watch out!” Experts on Li Qiye’s side roared.

The actual combatant simply smiled and raised his hammer. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Crackle!” A lightning beam suddenly manifested and struck the hammer. It didn’t harm Li Qiye in the slightest.

More crackles ensued before the astounded crowd. An ocean of lightning instantly appeared above the incoming sword slash. Each bolt was as thick as a mountain range and illuminated the realm. The target was still Li Qiye’s hammer.

As the bolts converged on the hammer, they eventually formed a pulse bright enough to temporarily blind the spectators.

“Break!” Li Qiye leaped in the air and smashed the hammer down without holding back.

The ocean of lighting above was pulled downward. The individual bolts looked like an apocalyptic tsunami.

The power of lightning made Sword Hero’s sword technique look trivial in comparison.

The murderous and evil sword strands were instantly overwhelmed by the lightning waves.

The bolts gathered into more pulses and soared forward. Sword Hero assumed a defensive stance with his Sinister Sword Art, sealing the area around him. Unfortunately, this was of no use.

“Boom!” Li Qiye’s hammer smashed the barrier, breaking it in an effortless manner.

The lightning pulses struck the Sword Hero repeatedly, sending him flying for ten million miles.

“Rumble!” He smashed through numerous mountains along the way. Eventually, the last peak managed to hold him back due to a lack of momentum. He became buried in debris - his fate unknown.

The spectators couldn’t close their mouth while watching the exchange. Even Righteous Scion had the same embarrassing expression. Xu Cuimei was mentally prepared but her lips still parted.

Everyone stood there in a daze due to the unexpected result. They were so impressed with the Sinister Sword Art, thinking that it would be the end of Li Qiye.

Alas, this mighty move and its unbeatable master were swiftly beaten by one hammer smash from Li Qiye.
