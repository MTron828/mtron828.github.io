Chapter 4141: Curtain Of Blades

“Clank!” A curtain made out of swords poured down and protected the sword lord. He swung his sword once and the curtain fully surrounded him, once more to fortify his domain.

One layer became two, three, and more… The sword domain seemed to be unbreakable as it filled up space.

“Curtain of Blades, this is his proudest defensive technique.” One ancestor who recognized the move said.

“Boom!” Ninth’s slashes came in an apocalyptic manner, ready to annihilate the entire peak.

“Rumble!” Fiery sparks scattered everywhere, resulting in something akin to an erupting volcano. They shined the night sky just like gorgeous fireworks.

“Rumble!” Though ten thousand slashes struck at the same time, the curtains stood strong like an impregnable fortress.

The crowd clicked their tongue after seeing the sword lord’s calm expression after the first exchange.

“His internal force is incredible, this must have been accumulated after millions of years.” One expert praised.

People became more confident in him after he stopped Lifeless. They thought that he still had a chance.

“Hmm, he can rely on his ample internal power and keep on defending, it might be enough until Ninth is out of strength. That’s a winning strategy.” One youth said.

“He’s right to be proud of this defensive technique. Few contemporaries can break it.” A sect master sighed and commented.

“Clank!” Ninth immediately unleashed another variation. He became resplendent and appeared to be holy just like a saint looking down on the world. He could grasp the stars and push the celestials.

He seemed to be freed from the three worlds and the reincarnation cycle. The holy aura simply wouldn’t disperse.

“Whoosh!” The slash came without showing any mercy, proving the saints were emotionless and all other living beings were mere sacrificial offerings.

Being a saint meant transcending into a greater being and abandoning previous mortal constraints. Spectators saw their own death as a result despite not being struck by it.

“Bam!” The thrust traveled through several layers but still stopped eventually. It was still not enough to take down the sword lord’s defense.

“What a move…” Many felt their palms moistened with sweat. Others were drenched from top to bottom.

“That’s only the sixth slash, Holy. He has three more.” One ancestor said.

“Only the sixth slash?!” Youths shuddered in fear, especially those who were seeing Ninth for the first time.

They couldn't possibly fathom the power of the ninth slash and didn’t dare to imagine it. “Holy” was already unstoppable and could easily kill them.

“The sixth slash was nearly enough to break the barrier, the ninth should be able to kill the sword lord.” Those who felt confident earlier about the sword lord quickly lost their optimism.

“Clank!” The sword lord painted with his sword again. The broken spots on the layers returned to normal. Though some layers were broken, fixing them didn’t seem like it took too much energy from him.

“Activate!” Ninth roared and his hair suddenly fluttered even though there was no wind.

A massive sword with rampaging rays emerged, tearing apart the spatial fabrics. Its boundless energy could devour even the gods.

The spectators became injured as they felt a sharp pain on their chest, seemingly being pierced by thousands of swords.

“That’s terrifying…” They immediately retreated, unable to withstand the energy and the sword intent. If they were to forcefully resist, they might actually be grievously injured.

“Seventh variation, Godless!” Ninth slashed forward. Even gods would wail in lamentation.

A heavenly kingdom and all of its inhabitants would go down before this attack. Their divine corpses would pile up high.

Spectators bellowed, thinking that they had been killed by the move. It could even slay the gods, let alone regular cultivators like them.

“Boom!” The first layer of swords couldn’t stop it, the same with the second layer and the next…

It became abundantly clear that the proud defense of the sword lord wouldn’t be able to stop the seventh variation.

In the past, he had relied on this technique to stop many powerful enemies, even ancestors stronger than him. Today, it finally tasted defeat.

“Be careful!” Ning Zhu shouted while worrying about her master.

In this crucial moment, the pine tree became bright and the sword lord swung his blade with lightning speed, releasing a fiery torrent.

The slash’s majestic dao could seal the sky and separate the myriad realms, not allowing anything to get through.

“Jade Bamboo Rend! A top technique of Jade Bamboo Dao Lord!” An ancestor recognized the move and shouted.

This dao lord slash finally stopped the seventh slash from Ninth, once again putting the crowd at ease. Ning Zhu heaved a sigh of relief because she panicked earlier.

“The sword lord is indeed a top cultivator of this generation.” Both disciples and ancestors were impressed by Pineleaf thus far.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
