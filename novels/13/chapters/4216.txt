Chapter 4217: Void Crush

Both Vastsea and Light of the Worlds were top treasures. On the other hand, Li Qiye had a sword meant for regular cultivators, clearly no match for its opponents.

The crowd attempted to get Li Qiye to change his mind in order to have a real fight. Alas, he ignored all of them and waved his sword playfully with a smile: “This is enough, it’s not like I’m trying to kill a god or an immortal.”

It became hard for people to not take Li Qiye seriously regardless of the ludicrousness of his statements. They have grown used to both his tone and his success.

“Are you sure?” Peace Ocean asked again.

“Of course.” Li Qiye looked as nonchalant as can be.

Peace Ocean and Void exchanged glances and appeared rather austere. They weren’t fools and despite their anger earlier, they have calmed down enough to consider the situation.

Both of them had top weapons even when taking all of Eight Desolaces into account. No one would ever use a normal sword to go against them. This was akin to throwing an egg at a rock but their opponent actually chose to do so without any hesitation.

There were a few possibilities. First, he must be far stronger than them, being in an unreachable cultivation realm right now. Otherwise, he has to be a madman.

Alas, was Li Qiye crazy? No. The guy was arrogant and overbearing but absolutely not mad.

Thus, the answer left them in shock. Unfortunately, they were riding a tiger and couldn’t get down. Accepting defeat was not an option regardless of the circumstances.

To concede without actually fighting would ruin their personal and sect’s reputation. They would no longer be qualified to lead their sect after doing something so disgraceful.

“Incredible.” Void laughed and gathered the courage to say: “We wish to see what you can do then.”

“Blades do not have eyes, leave death up to fate.” Peace Ocean said gravely.

The duo was ready to fight to the death in order to uphold their dignity and prestige. They surrounded Li Qiye with Peace Ocean at the front and Void in the back.

The crowd watched with bated breath, aware that a storm was coming.

“Who is going to win?” One youth asked.

People thought about it and none had a confident answer.

“Common sense says that Li Qiye is a dead man. His cultivation and weapon are clearly inferior.” One ancestor took a deep breath and broke the silence.

Many agreed with this safe speculation. Li Qiye was a clear underdog on paper.

“The problem is, using common sense to gauge Li Qiye is foolish.” He added after a brief pause.

Others also agreed with the second line. Li Qiye had repeatedly destroyed conventional wisdom and logic with such ease. Would he be able to do it again in this battle?

“Just wait, we’ll find out soon enough.” An old school master said.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The outcome of this battle remained unknown. Anything could happen as the spectators’ eyes widened, not wanting to miss a second.

“Excuse me then.” Peace Ocean uttered each word with malice.

Listeners couldn’t help but shudder after feeling his murderous intent. Each word shot in their heart like an arrow.

“We’ll go first.” Void smiled.

“Yes, go first or you won’t have a chance to attack.” Li Qiye said.

The duo didn’t become angry this time since they were completely focused.

“Void Crush!” Void chanted while forming a mudra to perform a top technique. He empowered the treasure floating above him.

“Buzz.” Light of the Worlds vibrated once, forcing all realms to vibrate as well. At this moment, all worlds became subjected to the treasure’s control.

Cultivators nearby became immobilized. Space seemed to have congealed and sealed everyone within. They couldn’t lift a single finger and became frightened.

The treasure then sent out sparkling and translucent rays, nearly indiscernible due to their speed.

The undetectable nature of the rays confused the spectators. They suddenly saw Li Qiye being dismembered. All of his limbs separated from the torso.
