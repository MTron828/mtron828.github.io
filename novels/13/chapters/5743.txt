Chapter 5744: Fight To The End

They knew that without Li Qiye, casualties would be grave. Everyone had a chance of dying including Demon or Ren Xian. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Ladies and gentlemen, the celestial river stops us no longer. Do you wish to continue?” Demon, the grand commander, stepped forward.

“It will be a perilous battle, any of us can fall, including myself. However, I am determined to fight to the very end. Of course, I do not hold it against anyone for backing out now, you all have contributed and fought bravely, that’s how we made it this far.” She continued, giving everyone the freedom to choose.

Given the circumstances, there was a chance of being wiped out entirely by Celestial Court. Nevertheless, they had faced these choices numerous times during their cultivation journey.

During Skysplitter, the celestial river robbed them of this choice. Now, this restriction was no longer present.

Was it time to move forward courageously or stop on the dao path?

In fact, they have done enough after all these years and will be remembered for their valorous deeds. They made it as far as the duck egg buyer during Skysplitter and didn’t let The People down.

“We should end the misery of the hundred races, or at least attempt to.” An emperor broke the silence.

“Celestial Court has been looming above us for eras, we have to face our fear.” A monarch said.

“Fight, we’ve lived long enough, no need to live a borrowed life.” An ancient god gritted her teeth.

Everyone had unique aspirations and insights regarding this matter.

As for Nightmoon Conqueror, she boarded the ship without thinking twice. Others saw this and became emotional.

She had attacked Celestial Court alone and knew how perilous it was. Her determination was worthy of admiration.

“Everyone, perhaps we shall part ways here, but I am willing to fight along your side.” Ren Xian boarded the ship as well.

Chi Ye, Chen Xue, Calamity, Thousand-hand, Halo, and many others followed the two.

As for Demon, she waited for everyone else to make a decision. After all, she was the one who summoned them with the horn.

“We were fearless once, fighting against a thousand enemies. We can’t give up now!” An emperor roared and jumped on the ship.

“Right, no giving up now!” Many others thought carefully and prepared for death.

“Let’s go, comrades! Fight to the end, never surrender!” They felt as if they were back in their youth with boiling blood.

“No return until the fall of Celestial Court!” A fiery passion ignited among the emperors and gods as they boarded the ship.

They recklessly searched for the dao once, hence their current achievement. Of course, talent and luck played a large role but it wouldn’t have been possible without courage and determination.

If they had chosen to retreat once, their dao heart would have been negatively impacted. Some were born in an era with greater geniuses, but they ended up on top.

The key was not yielding and giving up. That’s the only way for them to break through bottlenecks and tribulations.

Thus, the choice today went beyond just attacking Celestial Court. If they were to give up today, they would give up again in the future - spelling the end to their path.

Doing so allowed them to live longer. Alas, their cultivation would also cease to grow, some exceptions aside.

“And we march again.” Demon blew the horn and the ship slowly moved toward the other shore.

“Everyone, we must prepare well for the incoming fight.” Ren Xian spoke before entering a state of meditation.

He felt a resonation earlier with the primordial light. As he channeled his dao, primordial particles began appearing around him.

Everyone else did the same, attempting to resonate with the primordial ship and sense its laws. During the process, they found themselves entering the internal dimension of the ship - a place filled with wonders and mysteries.

They began learning more about the primordial affinity and gained the ability to derive its complex dao.
