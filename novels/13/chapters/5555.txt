Chapter 5556: Never Heard Of It

While initiating the healing process on the ox, he turned his attention back to Wang Chong and grabbed his four sacred fruits.

“What are you doing?!” Wang Chong panicked.

“Isn’t it obvious? This ox is dying and the profundities of the sacred fruits can save it.” Li Qiye casually said.

“You?! Ugh…” Wang Chong turned pale in horror and spat out blood. His cultivation would be destroyed with the fruits gone.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He would be no different from a mortal. Furthermore, given his broken state, he would most likely die afterward.

“M-my clan wo-would not let this go unpunished!” He trembled since a dragon lord still feared the knocks of death.

“Your clan?” Li Qiye decided to entertain him.

“West Bank, th-the greatest clan of Dao Domain! We have six Grand Emperors and twenty-four dragon lords! Nine, nine legions too! Kill me and they, they will exterminate your clan!” Wang Chong didn’t notice the sarcastic smirk on Li Qiye’s face.

“Never heard of it.” Li Qiye answered and grasped the four sacred fruits.

“Nooo!” He found it inconceivable that his clan would fail to intimidate someone given its current power and influence.

Of course, the real reason for its position was due to the ancient emperors not wanting to expand their own factions and clans.

They had lived long enough to see their old sects and loved ones perish with time. There was no reason to start and feel the same pain of separation again. Furthermore, they preferred to join Immortal Dao City. Now, with Immortal Dao City closed off from the rest of the world, West Bank Imperial Clan became the tiger on the mountain.

Unfortunately for Wang Chong, he didn’t survive the removal process. His legs kicked up once as he screamed and started the next journey.

Meanwhile, Qing Baifeng swept through the army with her blade; heads rolled on the ground like watermelons. Although this army was relatively powerful, none could stop a six-fruit dragon lord.

After killing the main commanders, she showed mercy and didn’t pursue the fleeing survivors.

“Pop!” Li Qiye easily crushed the fruits and sealed their essences, initiating a derivation process.

Chaos true energy and dao power turned into a pulsing radiance in his grasp before assuming a liquid form.

It became brilliant like the stars during the night, brimming with life force and the mysteries of the dao. He dripped the liquid on the ox to nourish it.

“Zzz…” The ox’s wounds healed at a visible rate. Once the liquid was expended, the creature became perfectly fine and roared energetically at the sky.

“It’s saved!” Guo Cheng was moved to tears. Baifeng was already strong enough in his eyes, certainly one of the strongest in Momentous Frontier.

He didn’t expect this young man to be more frightening, defeating a dragon lord with a single swat just like a fly. Most importantly, he was able to seize Wang Chong’s four sacred fruits and even crushed them.

This power exceeded Guo Cheng’s imagination, not to mention his healing ability by transforming the essences of the fruits into medicine.

He had speculated the might of emperors and monarchs previously. It never reached Li Qiye’s current level. Thus, he thought that Li Qiye was an actual immortal - one that could be found only in the legends.

“It’s okay…” Baifeng heaved a sigh of relief because with the ox’s death, the Deity of Livestock would have to create a new medium for prayers and worship. That might require several hundreds or thousands of years.

Of course, this period was only a blink of an eye for emperors and monarchs. The same couldn’t be said for mortals whose lifespan was only a century or so.

“Where is your master, Geezer Yu Shou?” Niu Fen patted the ox’s head and said: “How strange, can’t find any of them.”

“Ooo.” The ox let out a cry.

“Looks like there is a problem with the emperors.” Niu Fen shook his head because the ox didn’t have an answer.

“Are they ambushed by that evil entity?” Baifeng said nervously.

“Perhaps, or another dire situation. Otherwise, they’re not the type to ignore what’s going on in Momentous Frontier, they’re certainly in trouble themselves.” Niu Fen stroked his chin in contemplation: “Hmm, strong individually already, not to mention being as one in the frontier. One or two opponents can’t suppress them.”

“Could it be Celestial Court?” Baifeng asked.

Bao:

Happy Holidays, everyone. It will be my eighth year translating Emperor's Domination soon. I truly appreciate everyone for reading and am always happy to see familiar names that have been there commenting since Chapter 1 when we started on WordPress. I do recognize you guys :)

I mean it when I say this because translation has opened many paths for my future when I was lost after graduating. It gave me enough financial support to have and take care of my family.

I don't comment as much because some comments for a polarizing novel like ED can be rough, especially for certain chapters. The messages have gotten better recently, perhaps due to the new WW rules or that only people who enjoy the novels are left at this point. I do specifically read comments for the good chapters and it brings a smile to my face.

I am always available for messages on WW Discord, that's the best way to reach me.

My life has changed drastically during our journey together. I got married in 2019, I think some readers might remember due to my hiatus then. Now, I have one son and a daughter coming in February. My beloved mother passed away in 2022 after a six-month fight against cancer. She was perfect and I couldn't ask for more, except perhaps for more time with her. I hope she is at peace, wherever she is right now, and that I will get to see her again when it is my time.

I suppose I shouldn't be getting so sentimental when it is Christmas. I hope the best for everyone and that you guys will have a year coming ahead.
