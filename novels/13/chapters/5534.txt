Chapter 5535: Brilliant Devil Emperor

The dao inferno seemed endless with a scorching heat, capable of melting time and space.

“Crimson Emperor’s golden flame, truly domineering.” Niu Fen couldn’t help but praise while blocking it.

“Boom!” The inferno continued to head straight for the group, wanting to reduce them to ashes.

Li Qiye simply walked forward; each step resembled a supreme nail of heaven and earth, preventing the inferno from causing damage.

“Clank!” A sword hymn could be heard before a sweeping slash cutting through ten million miles. This could traverse through time and kill top cultivators, pushing away any dao and law in the process.

“Can Long’s sword dao, such a massive area of effect!” Niu Fen couldn’t help but praise, activating dao eludidation for his shell to block the attack.

“Rumble!” The same thing occurred - Li Qiye’s steps were able to freeze the overwhelming slash.

“Zzz…” Up in the sky vault, the power of the light approached like a tsunami, instantly engulfing the region.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

This looked like the sun but instead of being the fire affinity, this was the holy power of light. It could purify all sinners and prevent them from joining the reincarnation cycle - to be subjected to eternal punishment. This seemed more like a curse than anything at this point.

“What a madman, Brilliant resorted to using a curse instead of just fighting normally. I would have crushed him if we were from the same generation.” Niu Fen was annoyed having to deal with this suppressive curse.

The endless curse of light couldn’t hinder Li Qiye’s pace, unable to infiltrate the area around him.

The ancient battlefield was filled with different powers and attacks - remnant marks from the fierce battles between emperors and monarchs in the past.

Bloody marks scattered here and there - the final resting place of the combatants. Near them were lingering shadows. Some shouted or spewed out runes of titanic proportion.

The rarer bloody marks were embedded into space. It seemed that the victims suffered from an explosive attack capable of destroying space. Their blood stained the air instead. Terrifying storms and tornados were formed as well, continuing to devour everything around them.

The aftermath of the carnage was a forbidden and perilous land. The rage and unwillingness of the combatants lingered perpetually. Instead of delivering physical blows, they had a mental effect capable of harming the dao heart.

Weaker visitors could find themselves being twisted by the raging emotions and becoming insane. All of this made it essential for the divine bridge to be built above.

The survivors, dao lords, and conquerors didn’t test themselves here without an essential reason. The risks far outweighed any reward.

Li Qiye and Niu Fen had a first-hand experience witnessing the last emotion of the fallen combatants. Of course, his step continued to freeze them all.

The moment he finished his path, the battlefield became peaceful and silent. Their rage was now contained and became still like an image. One could observe the minute details and changes.

Upon closer inspection, all of Li Qiye’s footprints were connected through time and space, seemingly imbuing a supreme chapter into the battlefield. This had an overarching suppressive effect on the region.

The only things still active were his primordial footsteps. Everything else found a moment of rest.
