Chapter 4168: Legendary Immortal Weapon

She didn’t think that he was putting on an act either. It’s just that she couldn’t read the content.

Eventually, once he finished, the paper boat suddenly caught on fire and turned to ashes in the blink of an eye. They scattered down the river and floated away with the sword energies.

She started wondering about the boat’s origin. There were many things floating on the river - leaves, gems, or something else… At least before the sword energies ate them up.

However, a piece of paper from upstream? This was worth ruminating. Did a big shot leave it behind after making it far up the river? Or was it from the river source?

Both seemed impossible because there was no chance this paper boat could make it this far without being crushed to nothingness. The only things that could survive this river were swords or scrap metals originating from the source.

“Young Noble, what was written on it?” She couldn’t help but ask.

“Nothing much, just where it is from and the places it has been. It’s just a communication medium.” Li Qiye said.

“Where is it from?” Her curiosity rose.

“From its master’s hand.” Li Qiye chuckled and looked back at the river.

This seemed like a non-answer but it told her enough. This meant that its master was someone strong enough to go far upstream. How far? Did he make it to the source? This left her with more questions than before.

“Sigh, there’s nothing good here.” Li Qiye moved his hand around in the water then said: “We won’t find a top sword waiting here.”

“Young Noble, what is your definition of a top sword?” She didn’t think that this was his goal.

“Whichever fits my hand the best.” He answered.

She didn’t expect this answer. Most would talk about dao lord swords or imperial swords… However, his question was just whichever sword fits his hand the best. This seemed to be a ridiculous answer yet it made sense.

“I heard that there is an immortal sword here. Maybe it’ll be a good fit for you, Young Noble.” She suggested.

This wasn’t an attempt at flattering Li Qiye. She simply stated what was on her mind without thinking twice.

“Looks like you have done your share of reading.” He glanced at her.

“One is actually here?” She became emotional after hearing confirmation from a source she deemed trustworthy.

“What is an immortal sword in your opinion?” He asked.

She pondered for a bit. The world talked about an immortal sword here but everyone had a different definition. For example, weak cultivators would consider a relatively strong sword “immortal”.

“There are nine heavenly swords of Finality, only Myriad Era is missing. It is rumored to be the strongest of them all, so if it is here in Sword Burial, I believe it can be considered an immortal sword.” She answered.

“The nine aren’t bad but there is still a way to go before the word ‘immortal’ can be used to describe them.” He replied.

She smiled wryly because this wasn’t a conventional perspective on the nine heavenly swords. Most absolutely considered them to be on the immortal level and would think that Li Qiye was being too arrogant.

“May I hear your definition then, Young Noble?” She asked.

“If I must assign this word to something, then it’ll be added to whichever sword is currently in my hand.” He smiled.

She took a deep breath after hearing this overbearing statement. This affected her greatly since she had such a high evaluation of him, thinking that he was telling the truth.

“There is a notable sword at this burial ground.” He interrupted her stupor.

“Is it Myriad Era?” She regained her composure and asked.

“No. Myriad Era and the other eight aren’t actually from Sword Burial Zone. Some might have been found here but it’s all a matter of circumstances. They do not belong to the zone, unlike the one I mentioned just now.” He elaborated.

She thought about all the possibilities. There were many records mentioning an immortal sword here but they lacked concrete details. Thus, many assumed that they were talking about the heavenly swords.

“So the rumors are still half-right. What kind of sword is it?” She murmured.

“A fine one, quite rare too.” He stared deeper into the region and said: “Unfortunately, it’s still missing a spark to reach the next level.”

“What is it like?” She didn’t give up.

“What weapons are the greatest in this world?”He answered with a question.

“Hmm…” She pondered. Most would instantly bring up dao lord weapons for this answer. However, she disagreed due to her knowledge: “We’ll have to bring up the nine Heavenly Treasures.”

Unfortunately, they only existed in the legends. For millions of years now, no one had seen these treasures.

“Not bad, close.” He smiled. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“So they’re real…” She became shaken again.

“There are epoch paragon artifacts and even more dreadful weapons.” He said.

She has never heard of these titles before and knew that they would be unimaginable.
