Chapter 4088: Sword God Sacred Ground

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The lack of disciples didn’t affect the sect’s prestige in the slightest. In fact, it was notorious across Eight Desolaces.

Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom commanded respect but the sacred ground instilled fear.

The most fitting character to describe the sacred ground was “kill”. This was an ancient lineage that might be older than anything in Sword Continent.

It wasn’t an assassin guild but operated in a similar manner. Rumor has it that it has been around since the last epoch but historians couldn’t pinpoint a particular era. This was rather impressive given its few members.

Some sources talked about its monstrous progenitor - an Immortal Emperor, that his title was used to stop children from crying at night. [1]

Of course, most exploits and tales of this sect have disappeared from the river of time. It also hasn’t produced a dao lord yet during the new epoch but this didn’t make it less intimidating.

Their progenitor created an unstoppable sword art consisting of thirteen variations. All members of the sect were eligible to learn it.

They didn’t use their own name but rather, what stage they were at. For example, those who have learned the first technique would be known as First, the second as Second…

The strongest ancestor of this sect was Thirteenth, a person who successfully learned all the variations.

He fought against the dao lord of his generation - Bone Dao Lord. This battle ended in mutual destruction and shocked the world. This played a large part in the sacred ground’s notoriety.

Bone Dao Lord was exceptional and mighty, using bones as the main dao. However, Thirteenth still managed to kill him. This should be a sign of the sword technique’s destructive potential.

Later on, some believed that Bone Dao Lord was someone who could come back to life. This remained a mystery but it didn’t affect Thirteenth’s fame.

The current successor of the sacred ground was the man ahead. He used to be known as Eighth and disappeared after killing numerous sect masters.

Most thought that he was already dead - either in the last battle or from the grievous injuries.

Today, he showed up again and had become “Ninth”, meaning that he had reached the next step.

Ninth’s eyes swept across the field. Some couldn’t handle his gaze and staggered backward. They felt an unbearable murderous intent. It was as if he was looking at dead corpses even though they were clearly alive and well.

“I have come to fight Sect Master Shi.” He glared at the demon king.

The demon king had met stronger cultivators than Ninth before. However, there was something truly dreadful about this swordsman.

“The sect master is in isolated cultivation, please pick another time.” He took a deep breath and responded.

“He wants to fight Sect Master Shi, his goals are the Six Kings and Six Sect Masters.” People understood why he was here.

“How many will he kill this time?” Even the big shots felt fear.

The members of the sacred ground had similar characteristics and personalities - merciless and solitary. Their blades must taste blood once unsheathed - this must have something to do with their chosen sword technique. The only thing that mattered to them was to prove their dao through killing.

Of course, this didn’t mean that they were mass murderers. They only wanted to kill the right foes - usually powerful cultivators.

After picking their targets, they would challenge and kill them in order to hone their sword dao. The criteria had nothing to do with existing feuds and vendetta. In fact, the targets might even be their friends or benefactors.

As long as the targets were deemed as best for dao improvements, they would be chosen.

Some considered them as assassins and even offered sky-high prices. They never agreed since money didn’t matter.

Today, Ninth was here to fight Shi Yingxue - his chosen target.

This wasn’t surprising because ordinary masters were no longer worthy. Only top fighters could help him become stronger, such as the Six Kings and Six Sect Masters. The next on the list would be the Five Ancestors.

“Would Sect Master Shi agree?” The crowd started talking. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“She’s famous alongside Peace Ocean Sword King. Her power is far above the average ancestor now.” Another replied.

The Six Kings were far stronger than the Ten Prodigies due to the age gap. The crowd wondered about the victor between these two.

“Not in the sect last time, now in isolated cultivation?” Ninth glared at Celestial Ape Demon King.

The demon king felt the same fear as everyone else. He hurriedly responded: “Our sect master is really in one right now, please pick a different date.”

The demon king was imperious no longer, feeling quite nervous while being questioned.

Nonetheless, the sect master was indeed in isolated cultivation. She wasn’t around when Ninth came last time. Now, the moment she returned, the sect told her to do so.

First, it might be an excuse to dodge the challenge. Second, this might improve her cultivation enough to fight him when all else failed. This was a well-thought-out plan.
