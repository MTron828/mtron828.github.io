Chapter 4216: Vastsea Heavenly Sword

Light of the Worlds was the name of this weapon. Its flame-like rays horrified spectators and left them weak in the knees.

“I wonder if Void Saint Child can perform the three strikes.” An expert stared at the weapon and quietly asked.

“Using them is immensely difficult.” An emotional ancestor replied.

“That would make him unbeatable, it’s highly unlikely.” An old king had a serious expression.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Others exchanged glances while thinking about these powerful moves only available to patrimony weapons.

Rumor has it that they contained the full power of a dao lord. Of course, this was a mere estimate by regular cultivators - an indication of how terrifying the three strikes were.

They included Comprehension, Mastery, and Extinction. Alas, using them was easier said than done.

It required the approval of the weapon itself on top of possessing enough cultivation to fuel the attack. Most importantly, the user needed to understand its creator’s dao as well.

Thus, many geniuses were able to use the weapons but couldn’t actually perform the three strikes.

With the weapon floating above him, it looked as if he was the one exuding the dao lord aura. The light added a layer of protection and empowerment, making him look invincible. A hand wave from him could massacre ten thousand cultivators right away.

This impressive appearance of his earned him admiration from spectators. Only a selected few had the privilege of being so powerful at his age. In fact, only Peace Ocean rivaled him on the continent.

“Clank!” Peace Ocean unsheathed his swords and forced all others to hymn in resonation, whether it be the swords belonging to the cultivators and beasts or the ones still hidden in the ocean.

They lit up radiantly with rays shooting in the direction of his own.

“Vastsea!” A big shot was more shocked to see the blade than Light of the Worlds.

“That’s Vastsea!?!” Those nearby shouted in astonishment while feeling the same way.

“Yes, that is Vastsea, a heavenly sword.” A great master carefully gazed at the sword and confirmed.

The emotional crowd became immersed in this rare experience - being in the presence of a heavenly sword.

This was one of the two heavenly swords currently in the possession of Sea Emperor. It was the only lineage in Sword Continent to have two heavenly sword legacies for many eras now.

Words couldn’t describe the current shock coursing through everyone’s mind.

The resplendent weapon appeared to be containing a vast ocean, not just any ocean but one containing countless swords and sword intents. Everyone could sense the various embedded dao - the righteous path, the murderous path, and many other wondrous dao….

“To be able to see a heavenly sword in my lifetime…” One expert trembled with excitement.

“If only I get to touch it for a little bit…” A youth wanted to come closer.

For the common men, just dao lord weapons alone were supreme. Patrimony weapons were even more unreachable. Heavenly Swords? Even the top masters never had a chance to touch them. Therefore, the excitement in the air was palpable.

“This world is so unfair…” A timeworn ancestor said sentimentally.

Though these two were certainly strong, the big shots from the last generation were still stronger than them. For example, ancestors from Virtuous School or Sword Temple.

They definitely had access to dao lord weapons but not the next two levels. In fact, the two sword saints didn’t have patrimony weapons, let alone a heavenly sword.

As for the youth, this was beyond their wildest fantasy - something they didn’t even dare to dream about.

“Why does he have Vastsea?” One youth asked.

Though Sea Emperor had two heavenly swords, this didn’t mean the king was qualified to wield one over the ancient ancestors.

“It looks like the upper echelon of Sea Emperor wishes to groom him to be their next dao lord.” One ancestor suggested.

Others thought about it and found this logical.

“Now, are you sure you want to keep on using that sword?” Peace Ocean became the master of the swords while wielding Vastsea, capable of delivering judgment to anyone. He actually became calmer and nobler in this state, no longer expressing anger and aggressiveness.

All eyes were on Li Qiye and his ordinary sword right now. It looked rather ugly and was completely overshadowed by Vastsea and Light of the Worlds.

They were certain that it would be cut into two pieces upon the first blow with Vastsea. It wasn’t qualified to be muttered in the same sentence. Thus, people wanted him to change weapons.

“Take out a dao lord weapon.” One cultivator advised.

“Yes, that sword will break right away, you won’t be able to compete.” Another hurriedly added.

“It’s not like you don’t have better swords, don’t stick to this one.” A third jumped in.

It wasn’t difficult for Li Qiye to summon a far better weapon in the slightest. They advised him not out of sympathy either. It’s just that the fight would not be worth watching with him using that crappy sword.
