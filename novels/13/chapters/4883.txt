Chapter 4884: Carefree

This made her rather anxious. Though her dao true flame was not comparable to top cultivators such as her father, it was still hot enough to refine metals and mountains.

Alas, the pieces of charcoal would not light up regardless of her effort. This was utterly ineffective.

Even a piece of divine metal would start becoming red under her flame. Alas, the charcoal pieces had the same gray color without any ember forming.

If she couldn’t do something so simple during this coronation, it would devastate the dynasty’s reputation and her father’s prestige.

Thus, she no longer cared about having to do this menial task. The only thing on her mind was getting this lit before bursting into tears.

“The dao can’t be rushed.” Li Qiye spoke: “The Primal Patrimony Fire cannot be lit with dao true flame.”

Others heard this and thought that he was mocking her. Members of the dynasty became even more furious.

A’zhui, on the other hand, was close to crying.

“Use your heart and mind. Ignite it with your Heaven Authority bloodline.” He continued.

The panicking girl heard this and felt as if a light had flashed in her head. She took a deep breath and let her bloodline flow naturally. This helped her feel the charcoal inside the brazier.

It seemed to be summoning her. She actually reached inside the brazier to touch the charcoal, not afraid of it being hot or dirty. Her bloodline and dao started harmonizing with it as a result.

“Poof!” The ignition process was a success.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I did it!” She blurted out in relief for completing the task.

The monument didn’t exude any divinity but simply became one with the world, acting as an eternal lighthouse against the darkness.

“Don’t get so excited over something so little.” Li Qiye said, once again making the members of the dynasty unhappy for picking on their princess.

On the other hand, guests thought that the rift was rather apparent between the new king and the previous branch.

At this time, a disciple ran inside and kneeled: “Commander, Mad Pyromancer of Wild has arrived.”

This caused quite a stir among the crowd. Everyone knew that Wild Dynasty was a home for villains.

Mad Pyromancer was ranked eighth and had two sacred fruits. Wild and Eight-stallion were mortal enemies and had fought countless times within the last one thousand years.

This was absolutely not good news for Eight-stallion with its dao lord gone. Everyone’s first thought was that Wild would take advantage of this coronation to cause trouble.

The guests thought about using this conflict and stealing what they could. Alas, they might be dragged into the mess.

The members of Eight-stallion became tense because the enemies have arrived. Previously, the elites didn’t mind fighting at all but now, their side was obviously weaker.

All eyes turned toward Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God since they had zero expectations of the new king. Only these two would be able to handle this situation.

“What are we waiting for? Invite our guests.” Li Qiye smiled.

Everyone glanced at him since he resembled a young master who was thinking that Pyromancer was here to celebrate.

Thus, they still waited for the dragon god to make a decision.

“Invite them in.” The dragon god said.

The crowd felt that a storm was coming. The villains also prepared themselves for any development.

They watched as Mad Pyromancer walk closer while still holding a torch. This thing never left him even for a second.

Others were rather wary of this since he could start burning at any moment. This wouldn’t be his first time incinerating a dynasty.

“I’ve traveled far under my lord’s command to congratulate your ascension, Your Highness.” He bowed toward everyone and even Li Qiye, acting like a proper big shot.

Of course, despite his notoriety, he was still an accomplished cultivator and knew how to act properly when the time called for it.

“Our lord presents a pearl as a present.” He then opened a box, revealing a pulsing fiery pearl.

This seemed to be a generous present but others thought about the implication. Was Wild saying that they would burn down Eight-stallion?

“Good!” Li Qiye clapped and laughed heartily: “I appreciate your dynasty’s sentiment and you deserve a reward!”

“May I ask what it is?” Pyromancer put on a fake smile.

“It seems like Wild Dragon is a good guy, I like him. My dynasty is boundless and prosperous, state your desired reward!” Li Qiye spoke like someone who had no idea of the situation.

The guests became confused. His own subjects wondered if he was an idiot.
