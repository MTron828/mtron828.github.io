Chapter 4780: Dao Sanqian

“Poof!” Dao flames flooded out of his concentrated gaze, forcing everyone into submission even though he didn’t make an actual move.

Both Enveloping and Cosmic were horrified by the surge of aura.

“Activate!” Enveloping became shrouded in a golden radiance due to the emergence of a divine halo. He focused his eyes and there seemed to be three thousand worlds within. The halo surrounded him and poured down endless dao laws, capable of pushing up the realms and stopping all offenses. It separated him from everything else, proving itself to be unbreakable.

“Golden Halo of Death!” Everyone found this defensive maneuver impressive.

This was an ultimate art of Bones created by a dao lord. It helped the sect compete against many other great powers. Rumor has it that Enveloping’s attainment in this technique was only behind its creator.

“Break!” Cosmic didn’t just sit and wait for death. He summoned a spear pulsing with an immortal light. Each ray brimmed with destruction.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Godkiller!” Many shouted after seeing the spear.

“This was the weapon that he used to crucify Doom Godfiend by the abyss!” Another said.

This victory earned him prestige and the title of Cosmic Lord, implying that the great leader was always in control of everything and capable of reversing the tides.

“Skypiercer!” He roared and threw his spear forward.

“Boom!” The spear made the sky turn dark as if the sun has been struck down. A black hole was created in its path.

The crowd bellowed in astonishment while thinking that Cosmic Lord did indeed live up to his fame.

The two of them were not only powerful but had a sure plan as well. One focused on defense while the other used the strongest attack to catch Li Qiye off guard.

Of course, this had no effect on Li Qiye. The might of his gaze alone sent the spear flying back on top of assaulting the golden halo.

The barrier had countless cracks before crumbling in the next second.

“Bam! Bam!” His gaze then pushed them down to the ground and immobilized them, rendering them helpless.

“This is true invincibility.” The crowd was shocked again, feeling the same emotion they did back in the previous battle when he crushed Shen Juntian’s alliance.

Enveloping Monarch and Cosmic Lord were the strongest ancient ancestors available on top of being historically famous. The former’s golden halo was rumored to be unbreakable while Skypiercer had killed a godfiend before. Now, they couldn’t stop a single focused gaze from Li Qiye.

His name represented invincibility by now. Whenever the crowd heard the name “Li Qiye”, they would immediately think of his unstoppable power and peerless status. Only he was worthy of the greatest fortune and treasures in the world.

“Eternal Cycle of the Six Dao!” A chant interjected this perilous moment.

Cosmic Lord became radiant and a spatial shift saved him from the dao suppression.

On another side, the temporal affinity came to a halt. Everyone felt as if a single second took as long as an era. The strings of time became visible and revealed their beauty. If it was raining, everyone would be able to see each individual raindrop.

A river of time manifested during the stagnation, stretching endlessly through time and attracting everyone’s attention.

“With three thousand dao I am immortal.” A chant could be heard coming from a person walking on time itself, allowing him to traverse an incalculable distance.

“Dao Sanqian!” Everyone knew who he was right away after hearing this.

“Buzz.” Enveloping Monarch who was pushed to the ground by his own halo was swept away by a temporal wind.

“Bam!” A radiant cultivator shrouded in the six dao landed. They took the form of an immortal flame. His eyes appeared to be an endless rotation of the dao. Staring at the pupils might result in being swallowed and refined down into another spark of the cycle.

“Buzz.” The walker on the temporal river has finally arrived. His light illuminated the battlefield.

“Six-dao Immortal Monarch, Dao Sanqian!” The crowd shouted their title.
