Chapter 3753: Heavenly Scripture’s Power

Eleven palaces against eleven palaces; Scarlet Moon Seal versus Divine Goldwhip.

The crowd watched with bated breath. Both sides were evenly matched, whether it be their cultivation or weapon.

“Who will win?” The Duality students became anxious.

Those who were cheering for Chi Xiaoyue earlier stopped. It was impossible to tell the victor right now.

“It’s not quite Righteous versus Buddha, nonetheless, still an amazing spectacle.” One big shot found this fight interesting enough.

At this point, both the young and old, even the ancestors, wanted to watch this high-level fight.

“Miss Xiaoyue, after you.” Liu Huaishi cupped his fist and let Xiaoyue start first.

His attitude made her worry inside. The danger was certainly there but she had no choice but to fight.

“I won’t be reserved then.” Xiaoyue answered. Her eleven palaces issued loud explosions. The true fate became resplendent. Numerous dao laws began to descend like heavenly waterfalls, seemingly covering the entire region.

Her pure vitality churned and rotated at an increasing pace while issuing detonations. The ocean of blood gradually turned into an all-devouring maelstrom.

Once the process finished, the spectators couldn’t look straight at the maelstrom any longer. They became dizzy and lost their balance, feeling awfully nauseous.

“I’m gonna puke if it keeps spinning!” A few young ones couldn’t handle the rotational impact.

Though the maelstrom wasn’t sucking anything in, it was affecting the orders of heaven and earth. This changed everyone’s worldly perceptions as well, being affected by the continuous rotation. By this point, some dropped to the ground; others finally vomited.

This move affected everyone and robbed them of being able to fight back. They would have stood zero chance against her.

“Go!” The seal in her hand activated and released a bloody beam. It looked like a spear piercing through the sky. The next moment was a bright explosion blinding the crowd.

“Boom!” A bloody moon floated up from her ocean of vitality. This was another form of the seal.

The moon dragged up the bloody maelstrom and caused untold destruction to the spatial fabrics.

Both the moon and the maelstrom crushed everything along the way, whether it be spatial-temporal affinities or dao powers. No technique or force could stop this move.

“Blood Moon Ascension, a supreme technique of Scarlet Moon Dao Lord.” One ancestor was horrified.

Others who haven’t heard of this technique before became emotional. This title was apt.

“Can Liu Huaishi stop this?” Many started at Huaishi, wondering what technique he would use.

“Senior Sister Xiaoyue got this.” The younger members of the audience found hope for her victory.

Liu Huaishi made his move as the moon and maelstrom were crushing down on him. His whip moved like a dragon towards the incoming attack.

Strangely enough, the whip didn’t carry the same fanfare as Xiaoyue’s technique. It looked inferior in both momentum and power so the crowd became surprised.

They thought that it was impossible for him to stop Xiaoyue’s technique.

This wasn’t the case. “Bam!” After the whip hit the moon, both the moon and the maelstrom were greatly affected. Their power and momentum fully stagnated.

This was akin to a fire inside a cauldron being temporarily pushed back by a pot of cold water.

People couldn’t believe how effective the whip was. Just a while ago, Blood Moon Ascension displayed such a wondrous and domineering visual phenomenon.

On the other hand, the motion of the whip looked feeble in comparison. Nonetheless, it still stopped Xiaoyue’s move.

“What’s going on?” The youths had no idea why.

“Why is this happening?” They found this extremely bizarre.

Dugu Lan’s eyes flashed brightly before speaking: “Evil Devourer Seven Chapters.”

These words stirred the listeners right away.

“Evil Devourer of the Supreme Four Truths.” An ancestor became frightened after knowing the origin of this move.

Righteous Dao Lord found the Evil Devourer section of the fourth truths during his youth. After finishing his dao, he wrote seven chapters and passed them down to his disciples.

“Supreme Four Truths is a legendary heavenly scripture, others have no chance of seeing, let alone cultivating it.” Dugu Lan went on.

“You think too highly of me, Fairy.” Liu Huaishi shook his head: “It’s embarrassing to say this but I lack the talent to learn it. I barely know the basics of one chapter.”

“Yes, Force Devourer Chapter.” Dugu Lan nodded: “This is far beyond the basics. You have reached grand completion already.”

“I’m not even close compared to the scion.” Liu Huaishi said.

The crowd couldn’t believe it. Dugu Lan said that he was at grand completion yet he claimed to be surpassed by the scion. Just how far did the scion get with this chapter?

“A heavenly scripture...” Others became afraid.

No one doubted the power of Evil Devourer Seven Chapters because their holy ground had one too. Buddha Dao Lord also found one part of the Supreme Four Truths - Buddhamization.
