The four no longer had the urge to voice their frustration. A while ago, they were furious and wanted nothing more than to crush Li Qiye. Now, only whiteness painted their cheeks.

They already knew that he was very strong but didn’t have a good approximation. They truly believed that he was stronger than them in a one-on-one fight, but the four of them together could put up a good fight.

Plus, they still had their hidden moves, confident that they could suppress him no matter what. Alas, this confidence started wavering after the previous exchange. Could these moves actually suppress him?

These moves could absolutely imprison Lucidity King, but only uncertainty remained against Li Qiye.

He was right. They mustered up a lot of courage just to stick around in this place.

From a personal viewpoint, fleeing was the right choice. Run as far away as possible to never see him again.

However, because of honor and their sect’s wellbeing, they had no choice but to fight to the death.

“Get started already, this is your last chance before I make my move.” Li Qiye acted nonchalantly.

The group froze, not used to being treated in this manner. The worst part was that they couldn’t retort at all - truly a moment of despair.

They exchanged glances and finally took a deep breath. They gritted their teeth, ready to fight: “Damn it all!”

They had no other choice. This could only end in their death or his death.

There was no fixing this situation since all pretenses have been broken. Even if they were to run, he would go after them and their sect.

Death would be the outcome either way so they might as well go all out. Maybe there would be a sliver of success. Not all hopes have been extinguished due to their secret moves.

Each of them slowly summoned a weapon with a solemn expression - their final and only hope.

“Buzz.” Lights started to pulse. These rays tore apart the area with their ancient chaos energy.

The olden days seemed to be emerging again.

War King had a halberd; Juezun took out an old bell; Calm Lotus Supreme Ancestor chose a stone seal; Myriad Formation Supreme Ancestor drew a divine saber.

“Boom!” They poured their power into the weapons to wake them up.

Ancestral auras shot to the sky and quaked the entire system to the horror of its inhabitants.

Many around the world felt the urge to kneel and worship their ancestors after sensing these terrible auras. Some actually got on their knees instinctively.

These four weapons emitted a majestic and ancient presence as if four progenitors were awakening.

“Our system still has ancestral weapons, four of them at that!” An ancestor became startled.

Everyone knew that Nine Secrets was one of the oldest systems. Its progenitor was Bao Pu’s disciple. It has experienced rise and fall, even near-destruction. Of course, it persevered through these events.

With Lucidity King, it reached a new age of prosperity, becoming one of the three behemoths in Imperial Lineage.

Its members took pride in this strength. However, many lamented about the lack of an ancestral weapon.

Rumor has it that due to the long years, the system has lost the weapons left behind by its progenitor. Future descendants no longer saw them.

Despite the fame surrounding its strength, many disciples were still nervous and uncertain. After all, the Li and the Mu still had ancestral weapons.

How could their system handle these weapons in the case of future conflicts? It wouldn’t be easy resisting these great weapons.

Thus, the appearance of four ancestral weapons astonished the crowd. Not even in their wildest dreams would they expect their system to still possess these legendary artifacts.

This truly solidified their system’s position among the top three.

“We have ancestral weapons...” People became emotional.

Regardless of the current conflicts, these four weapons still belonged to their system.

“Your Nine Secrets still has ancestral weapons? That’s some resilience and restraints across the years.” Wild Bull’s group found this surprising.

They were confident in taking on War King and the supreme ancestors, but not when these guys have ancestral weapons. These weapons far exceeded ordinary imperial and Eternals’ treasures. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Moreover, the progenitor of Nine Secrets was at the immortal level as well. His creations were superior to regular ancestral weapons.

“This is a given.” Ill Lord said: “How else did they stifle Lucidity King enough to maintain a near-stalemate? Given Lucidity King’s personalities, he wouldn’t have allowed the five supreme ancestors to have any influence or spared the Sacred Cabinet.”

Lucidity King wanted to eliminate all potential threats to his authority. If it wasn’t for the existence of these weapons, he would have flattened the five great powers and the Sacred Cabinet long ago.

Of course, the five powers didn’t wish to see the fall of the cabinet back then as well lest Lucidity King obtain the cabinet’s ancestral weapon. They pressured the king, allowing the cabinet to go into hiding.

“They’re in the same set which makes it impossible for Lucidity King to stop. Of course, his enemies wouldn’t use them unless there was no other way. They’re only strong enough to use these artifacts once. Hmm, the full set isn’t here today, but it is still powerful enough. Just three of them together can stop Lucidity King.” Ill Lord assessed.

“It makes sense why the geezer didn’t destroy the five great powers now.” Golden Dragon murmured.

“What is the potential of the entire set together?” The scholar became curious.

Ill Lord looked at the weapons and said flatly: “It doesn’t matter since the outcome is clear. These ancestral weapons still can’t revert the tide. Their users are not strong enough to stop the young noble. It’s useless even if a progenitor is here in person.”

The group nodded in agreement. In order to fight against Li Qiye, his enemies better have some combatants at the immortal progenitor level.

On the other hand, the crowd had a different opinion than these masters.

“That’s their ace card, there is still a chance.” A few of them murmured.

Ultimately, these weaker cultivators believed that ancestral weapons were invincible, and War King’s group actually had four.

They felt that this was enough to change the situation.

“Can the king handle them?” A youth said with curiosity.
