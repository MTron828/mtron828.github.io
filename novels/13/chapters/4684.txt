Chapter 4685: Still Soaring Dragon

It was surprising for everyone to see the vajra losing the exchange so easily since he had just beaten the sword formation earlier. They doubted his power once more.

Was it because the sect master was too strong? After all, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call him the strongest sect master in the world, capable enough to contend against ancient ancestors.

“Soaring Dragon!” When everyone thought that the match was over, they heard the same battle cry coming from behind the sect master.

The vajra somehow appeared behind his opponent who was caught off guard, delivering a palm strike straight for the back with the immensity of a golden mountain.

“Boom!” It left a dreadful palm print in the air - a testament to its power.

“Enveloping Sword Mountain!” The sect master reacted in this crucial moment with a horizontal swing backward.

“Clank!” Thousands of swords spread out like a peacock’s tail. Each was thick and massive, serving as doors to block the incoming palm strike. His swordsmanship left the crowd in awe, capable of switching between offense and defense in the blink of an eye.

“Bam!” The palm struck the sword mountain and issued a deafening metallic blast, leaving behind another print.

“Soaring Dragon!” The vajra’s voice was then heard in front of him.

“Raa!” Another golden dragon attacked from the other side. Its claws could tear the ground apart as if it was made of paper. It had enough power to take down the sect master despite his mighty physical prowess.

“Just Soaring Dragon?” A spectator said.

They were amazed at his agile movement but hated his despicable fighting style. He had no qualms at all, seemingly having grown used to this. The strangest thing was still his single technique - Soaring Dragon.

“How strange.” Jian Ming murmured, wondering if the vajra only knew a single move.

“He’s just saying that.” Li Qiye chuckled, aware that each golden dragon was completely different. It’s just that in the eyes of regular cultivators, he was using the same move. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the face of the merciless claws, the sect master opened his mouth and spewed out a treasure pagoda.

It grew larger and pulsed brightly with an inviolable divinity, serving as a shield.

“Bam!” The claws struck the pagoda and caused fiery sparks to splash everywhere. This was akin to a meteor smashing into the ground, causing a tsunami.

The dual-pronged attack couldn’t be stopped completely. He vomited blood, staggering for a moment before falling to the ground.

“Master!” The saintess panicked and rushed over to support him.

This shocked everyone because they thought that the sect master would have the upper hand. They felt the so-called number one vagabond had limited abilities, unable to fight a true master.

After all, True Immortal Sect Master’s power has been tested, whether it be during his youth or after his tenure. Plus, if the vajra was so strong, he wouldn’t have acted so subservient before True Immortal and served as an errand boy.

Now, his fighting prowess became abundantly clear. Someone else wouldn’t have been able to injure the sect master despite using a despicable battle method.

“The old geezer is actually this capable?” Jian Ming found this surprising. The vajra had fought against his ancestor before but that was just an act. Now, he managed to defeat True Immortal Sect Master in just a few moves.

“He disguised himself as a pig to eat a tiger.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“He’s the pinnacle of being wretched and despicable, you have a long way to go, brat.” The daoist commented.

“That’s my line.” Jian Ming became annoyed.

Meanwhile, others started talking about the battle as well.

“A reputable cultivator resorting to surprise attacks, how shameless.” One commenter expressed disdain.

“It wasn’t righteous but his power is real, that’s how he won.” A big shot disagreed.

Many agreed with this statement. Though he lacked proper decorums, he was certainly worthy of his fame.

“Hehehe, my apology, Sect Master.” The vajra apologized but certainly didn’t mean it.

True Immortal Sect Master smiled wryly, not expecting this outcome either. The guy pretended to be weak all this time so he truly underestimated the opponent.

“Our little girl really wants this grass, my hands were tied in this matter.” He added before heading for the grass. It tried to escape but couldn’t lose the vajra.

“Boom!” Suddenly, another figure descended with surging true chaos energy. It splashed outward like the waves of a great lake, instantly suffocating the crowd.
