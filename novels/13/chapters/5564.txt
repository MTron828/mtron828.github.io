Chapter 5565: Breaking The Immortal Weapon

The onslaught, albeit relentless, couldn’t break the primordial barrier.

“Boom!” The barrier erupted and repelled the gray aura, sweeping them up into the air.

“Zzz…” Strands were being crushed by the pressure.

However, something strange happened next. The gray aura seemed to be empowered by something. Even the crushed strands gathered together into a group and floated in the air.

An unknown presence started refining the strands, causing them to turn into smoke and disappear. Finally, the entire aura was replaced by a weapon - only a shadow or a manifestation of its power, not the real thing.

It resembled a throwing star with three sharp tips and was made out of light, capable of flying at a great speed and returning to the user. It exuded the gray aura as well after the fusion.

Despite not being the real body, the gleam from the weapon alone could sever the reincarnation cycle. Each ray was made from a million stars - a testament to its prowess.

Bones and the others felt a chill coursing down their spine while thinking that these rays could decapitate them.

Remember, they were apex cultivators who possessed mighty weapons. Their body alone could withstand any attack. Unfortunately, this throwing star’s presence alone made them feel pain all over.

“What the hell is this weapon?” Niu Fen took a deep breath.

Niu Fen’s shell protected The People from Immortal Pagoda Conqueror and many more - a feat that was virtually impossible to duplicate. Alas, he understood that his shell wouldn’t be able to stop a single attack from the star. It would cut through all of his defenses and split his shell into two halves.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

As for Qin Baifeng, her knees buckled and she fell to the ground - unable to fathom the throwing star’s might. Its light alone could dismember her.

“Clank!” A slash came straight for Li Qiye, perhaps capable of killing immortals in the legends.

The others felt a sharp pain as if they were about to be slaughtered like cattle. Li Qiye, on the other hand, scoffed and said: “Even the real one is useless, let alone an image.”

Having said that, he punched the slash without any hesitation. This was a punch reduced to its simplest form, devoid of any flashiness and dao profundities. Nonetheless, it could determine the fate of the cosmos.

It remained a constant regardless of the passage of time. The withering and polishing of the grand dao didn’t affect the punch in the slightest.

“Boom!” He struck the weapon directly and obliterated it with a force that could suppress pseudo-immortals. This was enough to deal with the real weapon, let alone its image.

The power of his fist continued to sweep across Momentous Frontier. The remnants of the weapon had no place to hide. Eventually, its last glint was extinguished.

Mortals naturally couldn’t handle this pressure and were forced to their knees. The only reason why they survived was due to the protection of Momentous Dao. Otherwise, they would have been blown to pieces.

“Boom!” Finally, the strike struck the true weapon hiding in the frontier.

It immediately woke up from hibernation and unleashed a light above anything from the mortal world. This vertical beam caused everyone to feel pain, even those far away from Momentous Frontier.

“Are you seeing this?!” A monarch shouted in astonishment after feeling a sharp prick by his neck.

“Momentous Frontier has an immortal weapon.” Monarchs and emperors realized something after the beam disappeared.

“An immortal weapon?” Juniors found this comment to be unreasonable. Imperial weapons stood at the top of the world, so was this something greater?
