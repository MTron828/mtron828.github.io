Chapter 4799: Not Even One Move

“Perish!” The trio’s strong attacks soared for Li Qiye.

Dao Sanqian stood on a river of time for eternity. Three Thousand Dao existed near him. This wasn’t just an imaginary number but there were indeed three thousand different ones - special fire, ice, void… These majestic dao could crush three thousand worlds without any problem.

“Boom!” They combined together into a single pulse. Three thousand back to one - a destructive combination.

The pulsing ray destroyed everything in its path, capable of mowing through ten great powers.

The crowd became astounded. In history, cultivators shuddered whenever the name Dao Sanqian was brought up. It represented invincibility and tenacity.

Alas, few had the privilege of seeing him in action, let alone an all-out attack.

Sure enough, the ancient ancestors and monarchs found themselves weaker than him after witnessing this attack. There was no chance of them winning in a one-on-one duel.

Unfortunately for him, his opponent was viewed to be on the immortal level while he was merely at the apex of men.

“Boom!” Enveloping summoned energy spears as large as mountain ranges. They rushed down in unison and horrified everyone.

Cosmic Lord also gathered power. His dao in the form of a lightning spear carried the power resembling that of a tribulation. It aimed straight for Li Qiye’s chest, deterring cultivators just like his allies. This made cultivators feel helpless because they feared tribulations the most.

The crowd screamed and thought that this might have been the move Cosmic Lord used to impale Doom Godfiend.

Each of them had ample destructive potential, let alone all three together. Alas, what should have been an unbeatable combination remained the underdog since the target was Li Qiye. The only thing making a difference was Li Qiye’s injury.

“Can he stop it?” A high ancestor was intrigued since Li Qiye couldn’t move an inch.

“Boom!” The three moves struck Li Qiye and emitted a blinding blast.

Many shouted in astonishment but once the particles dissipated, they saw Li Qiye still sitting there, unscathed.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A barrier appeared around him, granting him full protection. Just this thin layer alone stopped the trio’s combination despite their best effort.

It seemed to be the toughest entity in existence, rendering him invulnerable.

“What is this defensive barrier…” A crowd member murmured in a daze.

“The apex of men is still no match for an immortal.” A high ancestor said: “Just one thought from the immortal can kill them.”

The trio exchanged glances, shocked. Their opponent still has yet to activate his terrifying divinity.

“Boom!” The barrier pulsed once and sent the three flying.

They reacted in time, activating their dao defense and raising their weapon. Unfortunately, the pulse still obliterated these defenses and turned them into shooting stars.

They smashed through mountains and valleys before ending in a pit.

The crowd couldn’t believe it. Li Qiye didn’t do a thing outside of trying to recover from the heavenly injuries. Just the barrier’s automatic retaliation repelled these top masters.

Dust and smoke prevented the crowd from seeing whether the three were alive or otherwise.

After a while, they finally pushed the blocks away and crawled out of the pit. Covered in blood from top to bottom, they still vomited some more.

The power gap was rather unreasonable. Li Qiye might be able to kill them and the entire world with a single thought.

“Let’s begin, we have to do this at all costs.” Dao Sanqian told Cosmic Lord.
