Chapter 5862: There Wasn’t A Need

At the same time, the other five found hiding useless. The coordinates of their position always lit up in the blink of an eye. They tried different hideouts only to fail.

“Stop running.” Voracious shouted at these overlords running like headless snakes: “Help us kill him.”

The five exchanged glances and understood the lack of option. Was there a chance of killing Li Qiye with seven overlords?

They nodded and returned to the battlefield, surrounding Li Qiye with Epoch’s End and Voracious Leviathan.

“It’s about time, but one is still missing.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Who?” Epoch’s End asked.

“Who else can it be in this epoch? Just call already.” Li Qiye said.

The dwarf’s eyes narrowed and released a dreadful light capable of killing emperors.

“Go for it already, this is your only chance at surviving, might as well try your best.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Epoch’s End glanced at Voracious first before shifting his gaze toward Primal. The latter shook his head in response.

Imperial Progenitor and Dao Ancestor shrugged as well.

“How did you communicate back then?” Derivation asked Primal.

“There wasn’t a need.” Primal looked frustrated.

“Seems like no one knows. It’s hopeless then.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“As if Twilight Hunter makes that big of a difference.” Epoch’s End commented.

By this point, all of the overlords have shown up except for Twilight Hunter.

“How amusing, the jealousy in your heart didn’t change after all these years, that is your root of darkness.” Li Qiye said.

“Jealous of what? I devoured six epochs while Twilight Hunter is only a rat. Don’t compare him to me.” Epoch’s End sneered and declared proudly.

Twilight Hunter might be more mysterious and elusive than him. The others knew very little or nothing about him. Although he participated in the hunt, there was no line of communication among them.

Epoch’s End was the oldest and only knew of such a cultivator hiding in the shadows, only appearing every once in a while for the hunt.

Voracious took his time devouring his epoch until nothing was left. Such a heinous feat couldn’t be accomplished in a short time.

This applied to Epoch’s End as well. However, he didn’t fully devour the six epochs. For one, he appeared during a time of peace and swallowed as much as possible. Another was during its destruction already, allowing him to eat more than normal.

Due to the lengthy process, the two were more exposed and history knew of them. Twilight Hunter, on the other hand, was not as greedy. His targets were carefully chosen and always one at a time - perhaps the most nutritious existence in the epoch. This elusiveness nature made him more of a mystery than Voracious and Epoch’s End.

They knew that he was there for Divine Ancestor but the rest of his previous targets remained unknown.

Epochs’ End viewed this hunting style as a sign of weakness. The guy was certainly weaker than him, hence the need to always be hiding.

“Well, although you’re despicable, there is logic in what you say. You are definitely the strongest overlord in this world, Twilight Hunter can’t compare to you.” Li Qiye said.

This made the audience unhappy. Voracious snorted and glared at Epoch’s End but didn’t retort. Although he only devoured one epoch, it was a perfect and thorough process. Epoch’s End couldn’t do so for any of the six.

“Plenty of epochs have passed already. If he were truly powerful, he wouldn’t need to hide so much.” Epoch’s End said.

The group of five seemed to agree with this logic. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I think you’re right, Twilight Hunter is just a rat in comparison. In a fight, you will certainly kill him.” Li Qiye said.

Others didn’t know why he changed his tune, seemingly praising his enemy. Of course, they knew that Li Qiye had no love for the dwarf.

They shared the same goal for once, hence their deliberate comments.

Epoch’s End wanted to drag Twilight Hunter into this mess. If the guy were to show up, they would gain another powerful ally.

Li Qiye naturally wanted him to come play as well so that he could catch all the overlords in one go.
