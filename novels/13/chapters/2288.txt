As the old branches of the wutong tree rustled to the wind, the world became eternal, seemingly the same for millions of years. The peacefulness was accompanied by the vibrant force of life.

Longevity System enjoyed this quiet moment as well. After Everlasting was destroyed and Longevity Valley took care of the rest, order returned.

No one dared to say anything at this moment. In the past, a few sects were scheming in the background, wanting to challenge the valley’s authority.

But now, the valley destroyed Everlasting with lightning speed, letting everyone see their true power. That’s why all of the sects killed their ideas.

On this day, paper boats suddenly appeared and broke the serenity.

The sky came together along with spatial fluctuations. A portal with the shape of a black hole appeared. It wasn’t spinning and lacked a sucking force found in black holes; it had a greater resemblance to a black mirror.

Amidst the confusion, ripples appeared on the surface. Tiny boats from the black hole flew out, not made of wood but rather layers of black papers.

These boats started scattering towards different directions with incredible speed. They crossed through one system after another in the blink of an eye.

In just a short time, they filled the entire sky. Many were stunned, especially the young ones.

“Moneyfall!” Someone from the previous generation shouted.

“It’s coming to Myriad Lineage again, this is great news!” The older ones knew the significance behind this.

“Moneyfall is here, go, tell everyone and let’s get ready to go in!” One of them told the rest.

“Moneyfall is here?” An ancestor saw the black paper boat flying in the sky and became excited: “This fortune is finally coming to our world, I didn’t think I could see it during my lifetime!”

“Prepare now, I’ll take you all there.” One sect master told his disciples: “Open the treasury, we want as many true coins as possible.”

This development spread across all of Myriad Lineage and everyone became excited.

“What’s Moneyfall?” A newly debuted cultivator didn’t know what was going on with the boats flying everywhere.

“That’s one of the six great redeeming grounds.” An older expert explained: “With money comes chances. It might make you rich with an abundance of resources.”

“Really?” Skepticism reared its head.

“Of course.” The senior responded instantly: “If you are lucky, just throwing one coin down can get you a supreme treasure, allowing you to sweep through the world.”

“It’s that amazing?” Another junior swallowed his saliva: “Then what are we waiting for? Let’s pack up and go!”

“Stop daydreaming.” The senior smacked his head: “Someone unlucky as you wants to get rich off one coin? The chance is very low. Exchanging one coin might get a devil to come out and devour you.”

“A devil!?” This frightened junior felt his dream being shattered.

“Not necessarily a devil, but other dangerous creatures. Exchanging coins can result in luck and treasure or danger, such as a powerful monster. These monsters will only look for the one who threw the money down. There’s no escaping them.” The senior elaborated.

“Then why the hell are we going?” The juniors lost their excitement right away.

“Idiot. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. If you just want an easy life, then stay home and forget about it. A cultivator lives his life next to the blade.” The senior glared at them: “Plus, the chance for fortune is greater. Moreover, I guess you can try to run as fast as possible from these monsters. A True Emperor once spent a lot of true coins there and then swept through everything to find treasure on top of helping his juniors. This is a chance to leap to the dragon gate, things like this have happened in the past before.”

“Then let’s go, I’ll just follow your master.” Another disciple found hope and blurted out.

“Calm your ass.” The senior playfully smacked this junior too: “First, we need to ask the sect master for true coins. Moneyfall is a place where the more coins you have, the better; it can even save you.”

“Really?” The junior didn’t buy it completely.

“Duh! Of course, I’m serious. This is a world where money talks. Everything is easy with money, but if not, it’s hard to do anything there.” The senior said: “We just need to ask for as many true coins as possible, or we can’t even board the boats.”

“It’s finally our turn, we can’t let Imperial and Immortal Lineage get all the good stuff.” Another added.

Moneyfall was a special place, one of the six redeeming grounds. It would appear randomly without any set of rules.

It could appear once every generation or several, in Myriad, Imperial, or Immortal.

When one dropped coins down in this magical place, it could summon a treasure, immortal weapon, or even a divine beast. Of course, being unlucky would probably mean death. Not only would they lose their coins for nothing, but the summoned danger could also end their lives.

Nevertheless, the appearance of this area brought about excitement each time and people came in droves. Opportunities and danger were together here; so many became rich overnight while many lost their lives.

“How do we go in?” A youth was eager to try.

“Board those black boats, that’s the only way.” One experienced senior cultivator said.

Coincidentally enough, one black boat was actually above them. The youth jumped up and sat down.

“Let’s go to Moneyfall!” The youth shouted.

However, the boat didn’t react and continued flying on its initial trajectory. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Go, to that portal!” The youth tried to change the direction of the boat to no avail.

“Pay the fee or you won’t go anywhere!” His senior immediately shouted after seeing the youth trying to use brute force.

But it was too late, the bottom of the black boat split apart and the junior immediately fell down.

“Boom!” He slammed heavily on the ground, face first to the mud.

Another older expert was well-prepared. He jumped on the boat and immediately dropped some true coins.

“Clank!” With that, this boat immediately turned around and headed for the black portal.

Some youths copied this and successfully changed the course. However, after some distance, these boats suddenly stopped.

“Keep on dropping, the longer the journey, the more coins. One coin alone can’t take you there.” His senior reminded.

“What a scam! We still have to pay after the initial one?” The youth had no choice but to continue dropping his coins. The boat naturally continued towards the portal after receiving the payment.
