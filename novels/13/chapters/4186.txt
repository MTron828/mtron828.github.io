Chapter 4187: Incorrect

“Maybe this is the right way to enter?” One expert’s eyes flashed brightly.

“Yes, just need to toss people in instead of attacking.” Another thought that this was possible.

“If that’s the case, then anyone can enter. No way.” An older elder found this illogical.

“Li Qiye just did it though. He threw Chen Cangsheng inside.” A youth replied.

It was tough to refute this because it unraveled before their eyes. Chen Cangsheng suffered zero damage outside of minor discomfort.

“Why don’t we give it a shot?” A last-gen expert became impatient.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

No one wanted to give up the chance of entering the palace due to the amazing fortunes waiting inside.

“Let me try first. Toss me in.” Another young one asked his senior.

“Right, try now before it’s too late.” Others couldn’t wait and wanted to be the early birds.

This was especially true for those from humble beginnings. Entering the palace might be their opportunity to change their fate. They would become famous with great authority and ample resources. As the saying goes - riches and honor don’t come easily.

“Are you ready?” The senior asked the junior.

“I am, throw me in!” The youth immediately answered.

“Go!” Some experts and elders began grabbing their juniors and disciples’ ankle.

They copied Li Qiye and started the spinning process. Some youths couldn’t help but puke as a result.

“Now!” One expert finally let go.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” Numerous youths flew towards the gate.

“This has to work!” One senior prayed while watching the shooting stars.

‘Raa!” The dragon roared and clawed the incoming youths.

“Ahh!” The victims were reduced to bloody mists from the attack.

“What? Why didn’t that work?” The seniors found this astonishing since they copied Li Qiye exactly.

“Wrong path? Does it have to go above the dragon’s head? That might be the evasive method.” One elder pondered.

“Again.” He called for another junior to give it a shot.

Others followed suit again. Several more juniors were spun around like windmills.

“Go!” They flew above the dragon, wanting to follow Cangsheng’s trajectory.

“Raa!” The dragon clawed upward again and annihilated the juniors.

“Still no? What is the issue here?” The elder wondered.

“We should try something else.” The elder thought carefully about the process and wanted to do more experiments.

“Come here.” He told a junior nearby.

Unfortunately, the junior was scared out of his mind. Other youths staggered backward, wanting to run away.

“Master, I, I don’t need any fortune, I’m perfectly content just hanging around and serving you.” One disciple turned pale and started running.

A moment ago, numerous youths wanted to try but after the second failed attempt, they lost all of their courage and confidence.

After all, being alive was better than any divine sword.

“Can’t defeat the dragon palace that easily.” Nine-sun Sword Saint was disappointed in their foolishness.

“I’m sure you didn’t need to fling him in, Young Noble.” Shi Yingxue smiled at Li Qiye.

Snowcloud Princess agreed. Li Qiye just wanted to mess with Chen Cangsheng. He could have protected the guy and granted him safe passage. Alas, others actually took him seriously.

Li Qiye chuckled and stared at her: “Do you want to go in? It’s not a bad area.”

“I appreciate your kindness, Young Noble, but I have already gotten enough. Plus, I might not gain anything given my lacking aptitude. It would only be a waste of your effort.” She glanced at the palace and made up her mind.

“How wise.” Li Qiye smiled since she managed to resist the temptation of the eighth grave.

Suddenly, splashing noises could be heard all over the outer regions of the burial zone. People looked up and saw numerous tsunamis surging on the horizon. This applied to all regions, whether it be Sword River or Sword Abyss all the way to Sword Grave…

It was as if the dam of the firmaments had broken down. The result was this monstrous event.

“Shit, the flood is here!” Most were scared out of their mind, especially the inexperienced youths.

“Run!” They immediately ran to get away from the flood.

Unfortunately, the water came too quickly and engulfed the entire zone in the blink of an eye.

Everyone was submerged in the water. However, they found it surprising that they weren’t drowning or carried away by the strong current. The water didn’t affect them at all and they could move like normal.

They then saw aquatic creatures swimming around them. These things were ancient and unrecognizable. Even the knowledgeable cultivators had no idea about them.

Some were enormous and intimidating. If they were to open their jaws, they would be able to swallow and devour everyone nearby.
