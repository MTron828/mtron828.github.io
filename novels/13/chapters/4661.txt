Chapter 4662: Old Man

An old man could be seen on a boat anchored in the middle of the lake, fishing. Both his hat and robe were made of straws.

Jian Ming and the daoist found this rather strange. Who would be fishing in Worldbreaker?

Cultivators who wanted to broaden their horizons or seek treasures would always be in a rush, crossing through at top speed. Time was of the essence. Thus, none performed leisure activities such as fishing here.

“What is he doing?” Jian Ming murmured.

“He’s definitely someone special, it is not just fishing.” The daoist whispered and then glanced at Li Qiye.

The two felt that the old man seemed to be waiting specifically for Li Qiye. The latter smiled and headed for the lake. Once Li Qiye got closer, the old man turned around and bowed, gesturing for Li Qiye to board.

The two finally got a good look at the old man - handsome, full of spirit, and noble akin to a pine tree growing on a cliff - unafraid of winds and rain.

He had a unique calmness to him - one that could only be seen by someone who had experienced numerous perilous trials. Now, not even the sky falling down could affect him.

“Sir, the times are indeed changing if you are here.” The old man said.

“To be so accurate, impressive proficiency.” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man took out a wine gourd from his chest pocket and smiled: “Still amateurish. The fist intents here are unending and omnipresent.”

Having said that, he offered it to Li Qiye: “No delicacies in this desolate place so I brewed my own wine. If you would, Sir.”

Li Qiye opened the gourd and the strong smell alone made the duo salivate. They entered a strange state of mind - seemingly floating in space and listening to the sounds of the world. It affected their very heart and soul.

“A fine wine indeed.” Li Qiye took a sip and became radiant.

“Supreme items in Worldbreaker are still just products of an uncultivated land, thank you for being so kind.” The old man said.

“Fermenting seven-rotation divine grains is considered luxurious in any place.” Li Qiye replied.

“You are indeed an immortal in a mortal world.” The old man became sentimental: “Knowing it all after just one sip.”

Li Qiye drank again while the duo swallowed their saliva repeatedly, not daring to ask Li Qiye to share.

Li Qiye took a third sip before throwing the gourd to Jian Ming who became excited and took a big gulp.

“Brat, you’re drinking too fast, save me some!” The daoist became anxious since Jian Ming kept on drinking.

Jian Ming drank several mouthfuls and begrudgingly tossed it to the daoist.

“Did you wait here just to offer me a drink?” Li Qiye ignored the two of them and asked the old man.

“This humble wine can’t please your sophisticated palate. I only wish to ask you a few questions, Sir.” The old man shook his head.

“I might not be able to answer.” Li Qiye said: “Everyone has their own dao and path. A guide can only give guidance, not do the walking itself.”

“Right.” The old man nodded.

“Have you thought about returning?” Li Qiye asked.

“Returning?” The old man gazed into the horizon - the world outside of Worldbreaker where the events and emotions of life never stopped even for a second. He became emotional for only a brief moment before calming down.

“A cacophony of noises that will only distract after a long stay.” The old man smiled.

“That’s how it is.” Li Qiye smiled: “The mortal coil adds constant distractions and things to worry about. Enter it and be as unyielding as a boulder in the river, unmoving against the current.”

“Elaborate.” The old man said.

“The boulder is a mere passerby, only here to observe the ephemeral fundamentals. The current serves as a polishing tool for the heart, allowing one to eventually become a devil or an immortal.” Li Qiye said.

“I see…” The old man carefully pondered and applied it to his own dao.

“I have experienced the warmth and coldness of the world.” He eventually commented.

“Then did you find what you are seeking?” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s what I wish to ask you.” The old man said.

“I have no solution for you then.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Pursuits are different for everyone and they do change over time. Only a few can be exceptions.”

“Ah, the dao heart.” The old man understood.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye nodded.

“If it’s the vicinity, then I have no pursuit.” The old man looked around.

“The only tethering you here is your longevity dao, nothing else.” Li Qiye said.

“You’re right, Sir.” The old man agreed. He paused for a moment and then inquired: “Why do we exist? For others or for the dao?”

“You tell me.” Li Qiye stared at him.

“I do not know.” The old man shook his head: “I’ve thought about it before and the answers were both.”

“The dao will alway be the dao, the inhabitants do not matter. If there is no one in the world, it will still be the same. This is why people say that the dao is emotionless.” Li Qiye said.

“What about people?” The old man absorbed the statement before asking again.

“Harder to answer. Do you live for the sake of everyone or just several, perhaps a single person?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“How many give a damn about the sake of the world?” The old man said: “Hmm, as for several…”

“For a dao walker, the former is the better choice. It is only a speculable number, the rules are lax and profundities can be reached easier.” Li Qiye said: “However, the case of the latter might have a greater result.”

“But it can also end in failure.” The old man said.

Li Qiye nodded in agreement: “Yes, one’s dao might fail if it’s for a single person. It starts with one and ends with one. Your dao heart needs to be indomitable, or both dao hearts while heading for the same place. If this only applies to one side, it often ends tragically.”

The old man pondered in silence.

“This path is arduous yet beautiful and might result in something wondrous.” Li Qiye smiled: “However, because the dao is endless, unexpected changes are inevitable.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Is it possible?” The old man asked.

Li Qiye stared at the horizon and said: “Two hearts at once and walking together for eternity? It doesn’t exist. That would be something so beautiful enough to make immortals envious.”

“The envy of immortals.” The old man murmured.
