Shi Wawa was meticulous in his search just like a mortal mother looking at fruits at a market. He picked up a stone and gently tapped in order to hear the sound. This seemed to be his selection method.

He didn’t leave out a single one while Li Qiye got closer to take a look.

“You’re preparing food?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes, the wind is coming so I need food.” Wawa cutely nodded.

Those who didn’t know about golems would find this shocking. How could one eat rocks and stones?

“This one will definitely be fine.” Li Qiye casually picked up a rock and threw it onto a bigger one in the creek.

“Really?” Wawa remained skeptical after looking at the rock.

“Try and see.” Li Qiye didn’t mind.

Wawa picked up the rock. It was around the size of a watermelon, quite heavy.

He tapped on it before leaning in so that his ear would touch it in order to hear the echo.

“Really now?” He didn’t get a sure conclusion.

“Take a bite.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Oh, you’re right.” He thought that he was stupid and opened his mouth to bite the rock.

Ordinary people would chip a few teeth by doing this. However, Wawa easily got a bite out of the rock. Little pieces fell out.

He could see that it was empty inside from the spot where he bit. He lifted the rock and a clear liquid poured out from a hole. A green grass looking like kelp also flowed out.

“Delicious.” Wawa drank the liquid and ate the grass. He smacked his lips with satisfaction and said: “It’s been a while since I’ve tasted such a good rock. It must be from the source itself.”

He kept on drinking afterward, one gulp after another. There was enough liquid inside to make his stomach look far bigger than before.

“You want some?” He thought that it was impolite to drink alone and came over.

Li Qiye smiled and accepted the rock. He tilted his head upward for a drink. The liquid was refreshing and carried a kelp fragrance, capable of quenching any thirst.

He had several gulps before returning the rock to Wawa.

“You actually know how to pick them, are you a mason?” Wawa became more curious about Li Qiye.

“No, but this isn’t hard. I know what they’re like after a glance.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Really?” Wawa became amazed, his black eyes widened. “Golems like us are born with a strong understanding of rocks but we still need to train. I’ve done this so many times since youth but can’t pick the right one right away from a batch of useless stones.”

“This is far from being difficult for me.” Li Qiye smiled and told the truth.

Alas, others would accuse him of boasting because distinguishing source stones wasn’t easy. Even the best masons couldn’t do so.

“You’re that amazing?” Wawa became surprised and didn’t make fun of Li Qiye. He continued: “Well, take a look, see how many I got right.”

“That one.” Li Qiye pointed at another rock in the creek.

Wawa immediately ran over and took a bite. Sure enough, liquid and kept streamed out of the hole, filling his stomach in the process.

“Over there.” Li Qiye pointed again and Wawa ran over in that direction. Yes, Li Qiye got it right again.

Wawa drank more and was utterly convinced by Li Qiye’s ability: “You’re amazing, you can really tell with one glance. Even mason masters can’t do this.”

“That one too.” Li Qiye helped the youth again.

Wawa picked up the rock. However, he didn’t bite it this time and placed it into his pouch.

“Right in front of your feet.” Li Qiye continued.

Wawa busily followed Li Qiye’s instruction and placed more rocks into his pouch. He found so many by this point but fortunately, his pouch was large enough.

There were thousands and thousands of rocks in this place so it didn’t take long before the pouch was filled. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Okay, okay, this is like several years of food for me, no need for anything else.” Wawa eventually gave up.

Li Qiye smiled and stopped.

Wawa then picked some random rocks and tried his best to push them into his pouch.

“Why do you want them? They’re not source stones.” Li Qiye asked.

“I’ve always liked stones. I might not be a mason and can’t tell them apart but why not collect them?” He smiled wryly.

Li Qiye had no objection to this hobby.

Wawa patted his hands then asked Li Qiye again: “You’re really not a mason master?”

“I’m not.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“That’s even more astonishing, you’re already so good at it so what happens when you become one? You’ll be able to see them all.” Wawa said with admiration and became a fan.

Li Qiye chuckled. This wasn’t really a big deal for him.

“Why are you here in Stonewind Canyon? To find some divine stones? I heard we have one here.” Wawa inquired.

“No. I’m only here to take a look. Stonewind Canyon is supposed to be the most magnificent place in Stone Plateau, right? Can’t miss it then.” Li Qiye replied.

“I see.” Wawa said before looking up at the sky: “You picked the wrong time though. The winds are coming and our area right now is the most dangerous spot.”

“Elaborate.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So when the winds come, the entire canyon will be engulfed by them. They’ll turn everything alive into rocks and stones. It doesn’t matter who it is or what it is or how strong they are, they’ll be petrified. We golems always hide in our village when they come.” Wawa had a frightened expression.

“Mmm, I’ve heard of it before. The petrified victims will shatter into little pieces the next day.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Right.” Wawa went on: “So last year, a group from Yin Yang Gate came and got hit by the winds right outside of my village entrance. They turned into bits the next day.”

“Quite a mighty force.” Li Qiye smiled while staring at the canyon.

This was the reason why the canyon had this name. Every once in a while, the winds would come along with this petrification power. Nothing alive could escape from it without hiding in the right place.

This particular phenomenon frightened many outsiders. However, the golems still chose to stay here.
