Chapter 3836: Incoming Disaster

The phenomenon at Black Tides came and went without warning, forever leaving an impression on the crowd. Some were completely immersed in the experience while others were worried, especially the big shots from the last generation.

“The tidal recession is coming early?” One expert wondered.

In the past, most would dismiss this statement as being ridiculous. It hasn’t been that long since the previous event.

Alas, after tonight, everything seemed possible with this black ocean. This worried the older characters.

Some had personally experienced these attacks before. Just one mistake or misstep would result in an unimaginable disaster.

“Who will be able to stop it this time?” A big shot murmured.

The first name that came up in their mind was Buddha Supreme. Unfortunately, the supreme hasn’t shown himself since the last event. Perhaps only a few had the privilege of seeing him in person.

“Is Buddha Supreme still around?” One ancestor asked.

Due to his disappearance, some thought that he had retired in Sacred Mountain. Others thought that he was dead due to his old age or injuries succumbed during the battles at Black Tides.

Thus, it was difficult to find another capable of shouldering this responsibility.

Nonetheless, some remained optimistic. One said: “This might not be bad because the recession gives plenty of opportunities. If we find a top fortune, our life will change forever.”

“True, I’ll go and take a look, there’ll be good stuff there for sure.” AN expert agreed.

The neutral parties had different views regarding this event. Alas, the Biandu had nothing but pessimism.

Their ancestors convened for a conference lasting the entire night.

“Anyone has an opinion on this?” One of them started.

The others exchanged glances. No one had a definite conclusion.

“A tidal recession is absolutely coming, it’s inevitable.” An erudite historian among them replied.

“Remember, General Wei has brought this up as well.” A different ancestor said.

General Wei here was none other than Wei Qianqing. She had brought up this issue with them but they didn’t believe her due to their own knowledge of Black Tides.

“What should we do in preparation?” Another asked.

The group immediately thought about Buddha Supreme and Sacred Mountain. Though their clan has been in charge of Black Wood Cliff for millions of years, they were still under Sacred Mountain’s jurisdiction.

“We need to report this to Sacred Mountain first.” A high-ranking ancestor said.

“Hmm, what about the supreme? He hasn’t appeared in public since the previous battle.” One ancestor said.

No one responded since this was a sensitive issue. The majority thought that he was no longer in this world. Alas, no one dared to say anything before an official announcement from Sacred Mountain.

This was the case for the Vajra Dynasty as well. Most officials believed that the supreme had died. Nonetheless, the royal clan wasn’t in a position to make this public.

“Well, in the case of a recession, it’s not looking optimistic even if Buddha Supreme himself comes. He needs help.” The historian said gravely.

The atmosphere became heavy right away. Buddha Supreme couldn’t stop the monsters back then until he had the help of Righteous Supreme and Eight Stallion Dao Lord. The trio then lasted long enough for the tides to return.

“The dao lord is definitely no longer here.” The historian continued: “I believe Righteous Supreme is available but without the dao lord, he alone...” He sighed without finishing.

“Should we ask our ancient ancestor for guidance?” One of them said.

Their clan was strong with a deep history. They still had one living ancient ancestor.

“If the cliff goes down, so will our clan.” All of them understood the existential nature of this crisis.

As the Biandu was trying to come up with a plan, there was another sect at a different location in Black Wood - Seer Watch.

A timeworn seer in this sect was observing the stars instead of the black ocean. His soul seemed to be taken by the dark night.

After a while, he regained his wits and said: “We shall commence the heaven observance ceremony tomorrow.”

This command shocked both the disciples and ancestors of this sect.

“Why so sudden? We haven’t prepared anything for it.” Another old seer became startled.

This ceremony was of utmost importance to their sect. It required perfect preparation to avoid any mistakes.

“The Grand Seer is personally presiding over it.” The messenger said.

He and the ancestors nearby took a deep breath after hearing this.

“I see, a major event is unfolding.” The old seer and the disciples hurriedly went to prepare.

This seemed to be a special occasion because normally, the Grand Seer didn’t show up to these ceremonies.

“Ancestor, may I ask why we are suddenly doing this?” A follower of the Grand Seer couldn’t help but ask.

The Grand Seer paused for a bit before revealing: “The son of heaven is coming.”

“The son of heaven? Archaic Sun King from Vajra?” The follower was surprised.

In the holy ground, Archaic Sun King was the most suitable one to have this title. But no, this wasn’t right because his ancestor wouldn’t address the Archaic Sun King in this manner.

“Are you referring to a heavenly genius?” The follower asked again.

“That’s one way to put it.” The Grand Seer glanced at him and said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Hmm...” The follower couldn’t imagine a genius capable of capturing their Grand Seer’s attention. After all, he was an amazing existence.

Back at the inn, Yang Ling watched the entire thing and became worried: “Will the monsters come out tomorrow?”

“Sleep, the sky won’t fall down.” Li Qiye replied and went to bed.

She thought about it and agreed. The young master was here so no need to waste her time thinking about these things.
