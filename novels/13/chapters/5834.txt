Chapter 5834: What Are You Waiting For?!

The world became the home of death as the blood refined everything. Splashing waves and explosions erupted as the blood ocean coiled around Li Qiye.

Lord of Derivation intended to destroy him despite his seemingly indestructible physique. After the ocean took care of everything in the nearby radius, it focused on Li Qiye alone.

First, it reduced the power of dao fruits and heaven’s wills. The momentums and affinities of heaven and earth were next, leaving the target defenseless without their cultivation.

“Not bad!” Li Qiye laughed and a primordial tree appeared behind him.

This wasn’t the tree itself, only an image that grew rapidly. As Li Qiye raised both hands, its primordial light swept across the boundless space.

Although the death blood could melt three thousand worlds, it couldn’t take down his primordial light. The latter swept the ocean backward toward its master.

“Rise!” Derivation roared and two hands sprouted out of his monstrous frame, pushing the death ocean back in Li Qiye’s direction.

“Far from enough.” Li Qiye smiled and channeled more energy, assuming a form capable of looking down on supreme overlords.

Derivation’s epoch power couldn’t push back Li Qiye.

“Activate!” He opened his body and revealed worlds of death gestating inside. Trillions of beings were living within, resembling corpses in a rotten dimension. Blood flowed from them with the power of curses.

He channeled their blood into the same area, creating a second ocean to join with his first. This could be considered an epoch-ending attack, immediately wiping out Eight Desolaces and the six continents.

“There’s no way we can block this.” Demon commented while observing the fight. The blood would melt all of them along with their home.

“This is precisely why Trinity Ancestor looked down on you, you wasted your intelligence and chose this deviant path.” Li Qiye sneered.

“Rumble!” He flipped his palm and sealed the new ocean, suppressing the death blood.

Meanwhile, Derivation continued to send out all the blood he had in his internal worlds. Alas, the primordial suppression proved to be too much.

“I told you, far from enough!” Li Qiye shouted and clasped his hands together.

“Rumble!” The gigantic death ocean started shrinking from the pressure while gushing toward Derivation again.

Eventually, Li Qiye turned the ocean into a seal around the size of a mountain. It became immensely dense; just one drop of vitality from it could destroy a continent and prevent any living creature for eras to come.

Despite mustering all his strength and death blood, Derivation couldn’t destroy this new seal. Being struck by it could have devastating consequences.

“Bastards, what are you waiting for?!” He shouted, calling the other overlords for help.

However, none answered his call.

“If you don’t help me now, I will reveal all of your secrets to this son of a bitch!” He became anxious and shouted again. He had no intention of fighting to the death and needed their help to escape.

“Rumble!” Epoch powers detonated from the four statues in front of Celestial Palace. Rays emanated from them but instead of aiming for Li Qiye, they struck Profound, Sword, Nether, and Hao Hai.

“Ahh!” They bellowed in pain, seemingly being pierced by the resplendent rays. Cracks appeared all over them with epoch light gushing outward.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
