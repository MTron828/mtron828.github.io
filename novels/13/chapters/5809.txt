Chapter 5809: Please Grace Us With Your Presence, Ancestors

Celestial Palace was behind Nether and he couldn’t back off any longer.

“Please grace us with your presence, Ancestors!” He shouted.

Although the majority of the crowd had never seen these ancestral characters, they speculated that these men should be staying in Celestial Palace. After all, this place was the core of Elder Galaxy.

The only reason they remained in this place was due to their confidence in Celestial Court’s true pillars. Even if these four were to lose, they still had five overlords left - an unstoppable force.

“Let’s see if these old turtles will come out of their shell for once to save you.” Li Qiye stopped and smiled.

Everyone took a deep breath. Some once again considered leaving Celestial Court before it was too late.

Morale rose due to the courageous display of Sword and the others. Alas, the situation grew dire by the second.

“What if the Ancestors can’t win?” Someone whispered.

“Then there are the overlords.” A diviner said: “Li Qiye surely can’t defeat five overlords at the same time.”

This opinion made people stick around. The five overlords just needed to defeat or kill Li Qiye and Celestial Court would never fall in this epoch. Being a member meant enjoying immense privileges and benefits.

“What if the overlords can’t win either?” A conqueror said.

Everyone found this inconceivable but the possibility was there.

“What do you think? We’ll all die too with Celestial Court.” An emperor smiled wryly.

The only chance to escape was now. The problem was if they were to copy Titanic Conqueror, would the others attack them then? Removing that bone meant becoming weakened, unable to defend themselves.

Titanic was different in that she already had independence due to her special status. Moreover, her cultivation and treasures were second to none - an immortal bone and an immortal armament.

Thus, they were more wary of their allies than Li Qiye.

“Please grace us with your presence, Ancestors!” Nether was surprised at the lack of response.

Without any reinforcement, he would be the first to die. Should he act like Sword and Profound, ready to fight to the death?

Li Qiye smirked and said: “Maybe you all are abandoned already, is it time to change your mind or do I have to walk over some corpses?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Nether had no more room to walk backward behind him. As the previous lord, he had to set an example for everyone else. If he didn’t have the will to fight, why would others bother?

Alas, the lack of response made him want to run away. Why would he care about Celestial Court if its leaders didn’t?

All eyes were on him, awaiting his decision. This made him break out in cold sweat despite his numerous experiences in life.

“Seems like you’re not ready to die.” Li Qiye smiled at the cultivator with his back against the gate.

Nether’s silence made it clear to the crowd. The member of the main branch who had ruled Celestial Court for eras didn’t wish to fight. Why should they?

He was inferior to Profound, Sword, and Hao Hai who could be considered outsiders.
