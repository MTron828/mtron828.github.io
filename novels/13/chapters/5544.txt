Chapter 5545: Missing Rice Stalk

“Aunt Baifeng, the divine stalk is missing.” The clan master said anxiously.

“What? How could it disappear? Did you lose it or was it stolen?” Baifeng’s eyes narrowed.

“Who would dare to steal such an item, that’s a great act of disrespect. It just suddenly disappeared one day, a member witnessed it with their own eyes.” He said.

“Impossible.” She said.

“This might be the reason for the terrible harvests in the last two years.” He elaborated.

“Hmm, the stalk is the focus of the technique, why is it gone?” Niu Fen murmured.

He had observed the dao of Momentous Frontier before, wanting to understand the methods of the emperors.

“We, we don’t have an answer.” His anxiety grew.

They were mortals and had no understanding of this method. Moreover, they thought that this was a serious matter and didn’t dare to let outsiders know. Otherwise, they might be accused of being sacrilegious.

Thus, they saw a savior in Qin Baifeng - there was nothing their immortal couldn’t solve.

“How strange, we’ve always been devout followers of the Deity of Harvest.” Baifeng pondered.

They had never done anything disrespectful to the deity. Moreover, what could a mortal do to actually insult an Immortal Emperor?

“Aunt Baifeng, please come take a look.” He asked.

“Young Noble, Senior, please rest.” Baifeng couldn’t ignore her clan’s request.

“We’re going too.” Li Qiye smiled and stood up.

“We don’t have anything else to do anyway, let’s see what the geezers are up to.” Niu Fen was interested in this matter as well, curious how far these ancient emperors could go using this path.

The clan master was ecstatic to hear this. Of course, he had no idea of their cultivation, especially Li Qiye who resembled a mortal just like them.

However, his aunt was very respectful toward them. Therefore, it shouldn’t be a problem for these immortals to solve their predicament.

He hurriedly led the way but in reality, Baifeng already knew the way. They crossed through farms and saw their condition - slightly worse than the fields found in the outside world.

This was unacceptable since Momentous Frontier was blessed with year-round perfect weather. Now, it seemed that they had been abandoned by the deity.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The main temple was massive and extravagant because the Qin was a large clan with ample resources, at least in the mortal world.

They saw a statue of the Deity of Harvest inside the temple as well - one far more magnificent than the one seen in the shrine by the village. However, the divine rice stalk was nowhere to be seen.

Mortals considered the stalk to be a symbol of harvest. As for cultivators, they knew that this was part of the technique - a vessel to accumulate faith and worship.

Its absence meant that the clan was no longer being blessed.

“What happened?” She stared at the statue and could see a fading color due to a lack of divinity. This wasn’t because of her clan not taking care of the statue.

As long as there were sincere prayers, Immortal Emperor Di Yu would be able to convert them into divine power. She knew that the clan didn’t abandon their rites and offerings, so this was puzzling.

“Strange.” Niu Fen said: “The dao is still there but not the old geezer’s divinity? Is he just lacking power right now?”

Someone such as Immortal Emperor Di Yu could exert his divinity throughout Momentous Frontier after garnering enough power of faith.

This shouldn’t be happening because this was a dao pact - an exchange of faith for divinity. This was the whole meaning behind the deities’ existence.

“Try bowing.” Li Qiye frowned and said.

Qin Baifeng focused up and tidied her outfit before bowing with reverence. This offering from a six-fruit dragon lord was rather effective.

“Buzz.” Divinity appeared on the statue again and flowed to the side - the location of the missing stalk.

However, a sharp and bright aura resembling a sword manifested into reality. It seemed to be infected by darkness, twisting it into a dark mist.

“Whoosh!” This second presence immediately crushed the gathered divinity.

“What was that?” Niu Fen tried to scan but the thing had disappeared from sight.

He became emotional and said: “This aura isn’t from this place.”

“Is that what destroyed the stalk?” Baifeng had never seen or heard of anything like this before.

Li Qiye extended his hand and pinched two fingers - possessing full control over heaven and earth.

A strand of energy appeared, struggling to break free and seemingly screaming. Alas, this was futile.

“What is this?” Niu Fen came closer for a better look.
