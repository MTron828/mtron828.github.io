Chapter 5134: Please Have A Taste

The young sovereign unsheathed his sword right away and sneered: “Oh? Good, I don’t have to send a message myself then. I’m sure I have made our intention clear, you all need to kneel at the entrance and be ready for our arrival.”

“Such strong words, Heavenly Sword Scion. You have a little fame but that’s not enough to spew those words before us. This is our territory.” The genius responded.

“If you want to argue, go outside. Peace does not participate in this mess.” A villager became unhappy.

“Don’t think you can be neutral for long. Peace will belong to Heaven Alliance soon enough, drop your attitude.” The scion declared.

“Brat, even conquerors are mere visitors to our village, let alone a junior like you. It doesn’t matter that you’re Sword Monarch’s disciple.” Another villager said.

“Hahaha, I know that you villagers are very prideful but let me give you a warning, the Supreme will personally arrive, how will you stop him?” The scion laughed boisterously.

“Supreme!” Not to mention the villagers, even the genius from Windchaser became alarmed.

Supreme was the title of an ultimate cultivator in the upper continents - a dragon lord capable of killing conquerors and dragon lords.

Though Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor started the path, Supreme made it comparable to the other realms.

Heaven Alliance even had conquerors with twelve fruits yet Supreme remained in charge - a testament to this cultivator’s might.

Rumor has it that despite starting later than the two famous legends, Supreme might have created a sacred anima tree earlier.

Though some of the crowd didn’t give a damn about Heavenly Sword and Heaven Alliance, Supreme was a different story.

Their silence pleased Heavenly Sword Scion. Bringing up “Supreme” always had this effect.

“Haha, when the great Supreme comes here in person, we’ll be in charge of handing out the leaves. In fact, we might even move the tree back to Heaven Alliance.” He declared.

“So noisy.” Li Qiye stopped looking at the peak and told the scion.

“What did you say to me?” The scion’s expression changed after hearing this.

“I am feeling calm today, keep your mouth shut or I’ll wring your neck.” Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at him.

“Hahaha, state your name if you dare to oppose Heavenly Sword and…” The scion roared.

“Pop!” Li Qiye sent him flying with a slap; his teeth fell to the ground.

“Senior Brother!” His fellow disciples immediately rushed over to help him up.

“Brat! I’m gonna kill you!” The scion was livid, never having been humiliated like this before.

“Thousand Sword Formation!” He roared and created a sword formation, sending a rain of blades toward Li Qiye.

“Not bad at all.” The crowd hated him but also recognized his power.

“Boom!” Li Qiye waved his hand and destroyed the formation.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ugh…” He grabbed the youth’s neck and lifted him off the ground while still staring at the peak.

“W-what are you… my master is a sword monarch, my master is Soaring Sword…” He shouted in horror.

“Never heard of them.” Li Qiye said.

“I… I am working under… Supreme’s order… your clan will be mas-massacred if you touch a hair of mine.” He screamed.

“Never heard of them.” Li Qiye repeated.

“You…”

“Crack!” Li Qiye wrung his neck and sent him to the afterlife.

Everyone exchanged glances after seeing this.

“I do not wish to be disturbed today, leave.” Li Qiye ignored them and entered the entrance of the stone pathway.

The frightened disciples from Heavenly Sword rushed over to grab the corpse and escaped.

“Creak.” The gate suddenly closed after Li Qiye’s entry.

“What? I’ve never seen it closed before.” The villagers became confused.

“Try going up.” Another said.

There was an invisible force blocking entry - the only possible path was through the gate and the stone pathway.

“Boom!” Something repelled the villagers from approaching.

Other experts didn’t give up and rushed over.

“Boom!” The same thing happened to them.

The villagers understood that this was a special occasion - that the peak was meant for that guest alone.

***

Li Qiye took his time climbing the steps. There were mysteries preventing others from climbing easily but it didn’t matter to Li Qiye.

He made it to the peak and saw the dragon-like tree, always ready to leap into the air and summon winds and rain. Just a few leaves from the tree were enough to grant someone an amazing fortune.

There were stone tables and chairs beneath the trees. Everything had been cleaned spotlessly. A pot of springwater was being boiled with firewood nearby, now simmering.

On top of a table was a scroll held down by a special stone. Li Qiye sat down and read it, “the water is ready, please have a taste. I dare not disturb you.”

The characters brimmed with the dao. Whoever wrote it did so with full sincerity.
