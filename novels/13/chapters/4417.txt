Chapter 4418: Ace Card

Ancestral Coil Banner was a top technique of his clan, capable of trapping everything inside. It was the embodiment of the clan’s mysteries and enlightenment.

Some believed that it was impossible to dodge or oppose this move unless there was a significant power disparity. His clan relied on it to dominate the region and propel its fame.

“What an amazing technique, no wonder why others spoke so highly of it.” One ancestor said. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“A very small number of cultivators in history can escape this trap.” A big shot from the east praised.

“Is it our loss?” One Dragon member murmured.

The youths from Dragon naturally didn’t want to see this humiliating outcome.

“Looks over to me, Celestial Tiger can’t solve this technique.” A high elder observed Celestial Tiger being trapped by the technique.

“Fellow Daoist, you will be reduced to blood in less than ten minutes. You were lucky not meeting me during your conquest.” Shenfan Tianjie couldn’t contain his excitement and gloated.

“We’ll see about that. Activate!” Celestial Tiger remained calm in face of adversity.

“Buzz.” Something seemed to be open and caused space to tremble once. His chest became resplendent and numerous spots emerged.

“Not good!” Ancestors and influential characters from the east certainly felt a sense of danger from the incoming waves of power.

“Boom!” Countless rays shot out from his chest and pierced through the containment, turning the blanket into a sieve and destroying it.

“Omniscient Eye!” Those from the east could tell that something was happening.

They then saw eyes opening on his chest - the sources of the rays.

“A dao lord secret technique.” The power and aura of the dao lord type made this rather obvious.

“I can’t believe how strong it is!” An eastern ancestor shouted.

“Bulwark Banner!” Shenfan Tianjie waved his banner. An ancient spider appeared and spewed out enough spiderwebs to surround the entire battlefield, creating a cocoon around him.

This was enough to stop the incoming rays. Though they did break through several layers, more web came out of the banner and created additional ones.

The defense seemed endless and unbreakable. It didn’t matter how many layers of web went down because more would be erected right afterward.

“Break!” Celestial Tiger was undeterred. He resorted to using his largest eye and released a beam.

The world turned dark as a result. Many cultivators lost their vision and didn’t know what was going on.

This time around, the multi-layered cocoon couldn’t stop the tyrannical beam. It pierced through all of them and struck Shenfan Tianjie’s chest.

“Shit!” Some eastern cultivators bellowed since a dao lord secret technique might be able to kill Shenfan Tianjie.

On the other hand, the members of Dragon cheered loudly after seeing the reversal.

Just when everyone thought that Tianjie was dead, he summoned a treasure and swung it forward to stop the beam.

“Rumble!” A magnificent exchange occurred next.

Celestial Tiger’s main beam and all the other rays focused on a single point. Alas, Tianjie was able to stop it by using a little banner the size of a palm.

It was ancient and embedded with inscrutable runes. It looked rather tattered yet wielded immense power, one capable of shifting the cosmo.

Nonetheless, the concentrated beam didn’t stop from attempting to break through.

“His clan’s ancestral banner!” An eastern ancestor shouted.

Yes, he had summoned his clan’s heirloom. It shouldn’t be underestimated despite its tiny frame. This was the pinnacle of all banners.

Shenfan Tianjie’s own power couldn’t stop Celestial Tiger’s Omniscient Eye. However, this wondrous treasure had no problem doing so.

He had used the Ancestral Coil Banner before but this was only a technique. Now, he took out the real heirloom - one created by a peerless ancestor of his clan.

“Even the Omniscient Eye can’t break it.” One spectator noticed that the beam was being stopped.

“Your eye is impressive but it can’t beat me.” Shenfan Tianjie heaved a sigh of relief, realizing that he would have died without the ancestral banner. Nonetheless, now that he had used it, victory was his for certain.

“We’ll see about that, go!” Celestial Tiger roared crazily and kept on attacking his complacent opponent.
