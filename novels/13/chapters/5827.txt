Chapter 5827: Summon The Ancestors!

Although the three divine rings fused with the punch, sharp arcs still soared in all directions and made spectators feel as if they had been dismembered.

The area of effect encompassed both Eight Desolaces and the six continents, capable of turning it to ashes.

Emperors felt as feeble as paper. The fabrics of reality and other affinities stood no chance against the power of an epoch.

This punch wielded a power beyond anything they had seen before. Not even Three Thousand World Mech came close to this level.

The latter was an inanimate weapon. Its ultimate power was limited. On the other hand, this appeared as if Trinity Ancestor was here in person.

The feeling of being in the presence of a living epoch lord was unbelievable and suffocating.

“Boom!” The punch smashed Li Qiye and drowned him with its power. Everything around Li Qiye was reduced back to the origin.

No one could see through the destruction, not knowing whether he had survived or otherwise.

“Incredible.” Someone said as they stared at the chaos and couldn’t spot him.

“Bam!” Suddenly, the chaos was torn apart along with the epoch power. The latter finally seemed inferior for once as it scattered to nothingness.

They saw Li Qiye standing and blocking the punch with one hand. Primordial rays emanated from him as he survived without a single injury.

The epoch punch earlier could destroy the world while his palm allowed for creation to occur. The primal chaos evolved with a majestic life force, giving room for a new world.

This became a contest between a fist of destruction versus a palm of creation. The shockwaves from the impact could raise the high heaven.

Chaotic flows appeared around them since Elder Galaxy’s internal dimensions had difficulties withstanding the exchange.

The figure of Trinity Ancestor loomed over everything but Li Qiye still pushed upward, eventually bringing the fist near the figure’s head.

“Go!” The founder and the three immortals burned their true blood.

This activated Celestial Palace again and its heavenly rays permeated throughout every corner and crevice. This boosted the punch dramatically.

Unfortunately, this was a futile last-ditch effort. Li Qiye’s palm burst with primordial light and the pseudo-power of creation. The two worlds came together and suppressed Trinity Ancestor again.

“Boom!” Now, Li Qiye was the one pushing down with overwhelming force.

“Rumble!” The figure’s light pulsed feebly, unable to withstand the pressure.

“Crack!” Cracks formed everywhere while the four controllers vomited blood and turned pale. If this figure were to go down, they would be crushed as well.

“We can’t make it!” Devil Bestowment shouted.

Meanwhile, the crowd watched with bated breath. If these four with the heavenly treasure couldn’t stop Li Qiye, this would be the end of Celestial Court.

“Retreat?!” Divine Eternal asked.

“Summon the ancestors!” The founder gritted his teeth and shouted to everyone’s astonishment. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Boom!” They vomited blood again after feeling the pressure.

“Ancestors, please protect Celestial Court!” The three immortals had no choice but to call for help.

“Start the ceremony, quickly!” The founder ordered Immortal Emperor Hao Hai’s group.

“Do it!” The three had no time to think and agreed with this last ace card.

Rays left their forehead and entered Sword, Profound, Nether, and Hao Hai’s head. They glowed with an ancient light, seemingly a seal of permission for the summoning.
