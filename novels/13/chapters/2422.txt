“Hey sexy, want to have some fun with me?” It didn’t take long before Li Qiye found another girl and immediately started his bossy act.

Jiadi could only sigh up and down after seeing this.

“Rumble!” Li Qiye didn’t have much time before being surrounded by riders.

It lacked in numbers but these armored combatants emitted a cold bloodthirst - indicative of their battle experiences.

“It’s the army.” The spectators immediately retreated, not wanting to make a mistake.

Under the rule of Lucidity, the army and cavalry of War Saint were unstoppable. Even though this particular group didn’t belong to Silver Secret Legion, it was still intimidating enough.

People gloated after seeing Li Qiye being surrounded, thinking that this brat was dead for sure. No one dared to oppose War Saint Dynasty in Nine Secrets System. This cavalry certainly represented the dynasty.

“Uncle Luo, that’s him.” A girl coquettishly said.

People looked over and saw that it was Luo Qi who escaped earlier.

There was a middle-aged soldier next to her, adorned in a full suit of armor with a stern aura. He clearly was either a general or had some other high position.

It looked like after escaping, Luo Qi went to ask for help. After all, she was from a military clan and wouldn’t be able to swallow the anger of being harassed in broad daylight. Thus, she cried and asked a city-guard general for help. After hearing this, the uncle became angry and brought troops here.

“Oh, didn’t you run away earlier?” Li Qiye was unaffected by the troops surrounding him and crossed his arms in front of his chest again: “Miss me already? Unfortunately, I’m only interested in other people now, not in some girl that runs back crying.”

It was as if the words, “spoiled young master”, was written on his forehead.

“Clank!” The general raised his hand and the soldiers immediately pointed their spears at Li Qiye, nearly touching his chest.

“Who the hell are you, daring to stir trouble at the capital?” The general uttered coldly with bloodthirst.

“Uncle Luo, kill him.” Luo Qi stared contemptuously at Li Qiye, feeling quite good about the inevitable revenge.

The general said: “Brat, surrender now or we’ll cut you to pieces.”

“To pieces my ass.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively: “Scram to the side or I’ll make you retire and go back to your village.”

His spoiled-rotten act was still perfect and aggressive, not giving a damn about anyone.

“Ignorant fool, die!” General Luo was a war-hardened soldier so he ordered without any mercy.

“Ahem, General Luo.” Jiadi interrupted this.

‘Who are you?! Show yourself, don’t think you can cause trouble here.” The general finally noticed Jiadi and shouted.

“Hmph.” Jiadi snorted in response.

The general looked thunderstruck and turned pale. Though Jiadi had his face hidden, the general could recognize this sound. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“My... my... lor-...” The general was scared out of his mind.

Military Omni-God! Zhang Jiadi! Since General Luo was part of the army, he naturally knew who he was talking to. This was the guard captain of His Majesty, only below Sun Lengying in status.

Keep in mind that Lucidity wasn’t a normal king. When he became unhappy, not to mention a single general, he could even decapitate an ancestor of the dynasty without any hesitation.

The general was afraid the most, thinking about how this brat has the omni-god as a bodyguard.

“I, I didn’t know...” He stammered.

“Alright, my young lord likes her.” Jiadi didn’t want to waste words.

The general became startled and stared at Li Qiye.

How could the guard captain have a young lord? Thinking about this frightened him.

Though the crown prince appointment has yet to be announced, everyone knew that Lucidity didn’t have much time left.

The omni-god who has always been next to the king was now guarding a youth and even calling him young lord? The general could put the pieces of information together for an answer.

“Wel..” He didn’t know what to do because this girl was the jewel of their Luo Clan.

“This is an honor for your clan.” Jiadi uttered coldly.

“Your, your subordinate understands.” With cold sweats running all over, he came next to Luo Qi and whispered.

The general didn’t dare to refuse because inciting the wrath of Lucidity wouldn’t only end in his dismissal. Even his clan would turn to ashes.

Though his clan wasn’t weak, it was nothing before Lucidity.

Moreover, Jiadi was right. Climbing up to the royal family was indeed their honor. This could boost their power and influence to the next level.

Given the status of this youth, so many nobles would want to please him, more than willing to bring their daughters to the door.

Luo Qi turned pale after hearing this. A girl still had her pride and naturally didn’t want to. Earlier, she viewed Li Qiye as trash but now, this trash could change her fate instantly. She couldn’t quite accept this.

Alas, she had no other choice. Not to mention her uncle, her entire clan couldn’t save her!

She shuddered, completely absent-minded like a tiny bird lost in the winter, blown back and forth by the chilling gales.

“Young Lord...” The general brought her before Li Qiye.

She kept her head lowered, no longer having the same air of arrogance like before.

“My niece is still inexperienced, please, take care of her...” The general added.

The only thing he could do was offering his niece to Li Qiye. This was the only way to save their clan and perhaps even bring prosperity to it.

“Not interested.” Li Qiye looked at Luo Qi and said: “I don’t like playing this type of games. Bring her back.” He turned and left.

The general stood there in a daze, not knowing what to do for a long time.

He didn’t know if it was a blessing or a curse. At the very least, their jewel had escaped the evil clutch of this youth. But their clan had also lost the chance to climb up the ladder of power, never being able to rise again.

Luo Qi was frozen as well. In the beginning, having to follow this youth she considered to be trash had shattered her pride. Nevertheless, she still agreed to follow him. But now, his contemptuous refusal was too much for her to take.

“Hey gorgeous, want to play with me?” This question could be heard in the capital in the next several days.

“Ah!” And then the sounds of girls screaming inevitably came next. So many girls were frightened and fled with haste.

“Chaos Hellion is here again!” Chaos invaded Skywrap.

Girls no longer dared to come outside during the day while Li Qiye earned the impressive title of Chaos Hellion.

“Sigh, these people are so bad at titles. I am Fiercest, not Chaos Hellion.” Li Qiye shook his head and said.

He continued strolling the street with hands clasped behind his neck while looking up and whistling - resembling an arrogant crab strutting on the street.

Meanwhile, Jiadi has grown used to this scene recently.

“Jiadi, all the girls are running on sight, this won’t do. Should we go into a noble’s house and take their wives and daughters?” Li Qiye smiled.
