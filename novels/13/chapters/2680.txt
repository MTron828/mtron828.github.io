“Boom!” The seal of a progenitor locked Li Qiye instantly while the one hundred suns came striking along the temporal lines.

They successfully crossed through the various domains to hit him right in the chest, intending on blowing him to smithereens.

“That’s a good plan!” Someone shouted.

The plan was great, same with the execution. The daoist’s technique surpassed physical restraints while the emperor sealed Li Qiye’s surrounding area.

Even if he could escape the seal, it would then be too late for him to dodge the samsara severing.

Time slowed down for the nervous and excited spectators holding their breath. They more or less wanted to see a miracle from the emperor and the daoist.

“Rumble!” Li Qiye still jumped up and spun like a diamond. The seal and the samsara severing technique were useless.

“Boom!” The daoist was the first to react by swiftly retreating while summoning armor plates. Unfortunately, he still got hit all the same.

The armors crumbled as he slammed into the ground and exploded into fleshy bits.

The emperor wasn’t better off either. His rod got knocked out of his hand by a whip-like kick. It didn’t stop there and made him explode into a bloody mist.

The Acorn Dao Fruit was just unblockable. Defensive measures or avoidance were nullified.

Thus, temporal attacks or seals were useless since this dao fruit could take advantage of any openings and flaws.

The world fell into silence again. People clung on to a sliver of hope with these two teaming up together but the result was still the same. They simply weren’t a match for Fiercest.

A miracle didn’t happen today, only the birth of a legend regarding Li Qiye’s invincibility.

“That’s it, gone to the dogs for them.” An ancient ancestor turned pale at this sight.

“Everyone needs to kneel at his sight from now on. Just one glance from him could destroy the world.” Another Eternal murmured.

The crowd all had a bitter smile since they understood Li Qiye was not only fiercest but also the strongest in Imperial Lineage now.

No one could stop him. No, no one could even handle a single move from him.

“He’s right, the world trembles along with the gods and emperors from a single glance of Fiercest.” One ancestor agreed.

They have seen Fiercest in action before but this battle surpassed all the rest. They finally understood that he only played around in the past and that every single thing he said was mere truths. The world was just too blind and ignorant to believe him, thinking that he was being arrogant.

The members of the Mu lost all hope. The powers of their system have fused with the emperor yet that still wasn’t enough.

“Buzz.” A fate palace moved around in the bloody mist and got everyone’s attention.

“Pop!” The figure of the emperor appeared again as if time was flowing backward, allowing his body and vitality to condense together again.

Li Qiye didn’t bother stopping this process at all, seeming very carefree.

“That’s a True Emperor for you, still alive.” One spectator emotionally said.

As stated before, this was an advantage of a True Emperor over an Eternal. At equal power level, an Eternal might not survive a similar amount of damage, unlike an emperor.

“Pop!” Light separated from the bits of flesh on the ground then came together in the air. A gathering of spirit energy and grand dao allowed Solar Daoist to rebuild his body.

This process was much slower compared to the emperor. The daoist was superior in terms of strength but inferior with regards to survivability.

The two quickly returned to life before the crowd.

One expert said: “They’ve reached a level high enough for a rebuild. Anyone else would have died already.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Alas, the two were deathly pale right now for several reasons.

First, the process used a lot of vitality. Second, to put it frankly, they were scared out of their mind right now.

Despite their great abilities, they still couldn’t stop one move from Li Qiye. This has left a seed of fear in them.

“Okay, I’ve had enough.” Li Qiye yawned: “I suppose this is all you can muster up and there’s no reinforcement coming either. It’s time for you two to die along with the Mu.”

The two combatants weren’t the only pale ones. The members of Mu had the same whiteness; some were paralyzed on the ground due to fear.

They understood that this was doomsday for them. Their clan would certainly turn to ashes.

Their despair was palpable to the spectators. Realizing that destruction was imminent yet being too weak to do anything but watch - nothing could be more devastating than this.

“Fusion.” The daoist looked at the emperor and said.

“Fine.” The emperor gritted his teeth and begrudgingly nodded, no longer giving a damn.

They were going to die anyway so might as well go all out just once. He was ready to pay any price just for a chance to save his clan.

“Oh? Still got another trick up your sleeve?” Li Qiye smiled at them: “Lucky for you two that I’m such a charitable person. Go for it, I’m waiting for my favorite pastime is beating down others’ ultimate moves then relish in their despair.”

The two exchanged glances. The emperor made up his mind and retreated to the clan with the daoist right behind him.

Li Qiye calmly stood still and watched.

“What else can they do?” The crowd wondered. They couldn’t come up with anything that the clan could do to oppose Li Qiye’s invincibility.
