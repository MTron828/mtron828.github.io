Chapter 4764: End

“Long time no see, pretty ladies.” Li Qiye showed a rare, sincere smile.

Sky-devourer Grand Immortal was only a recent title. They were Liu Ruyan of Evil Devourer and Zhuo Jianshi of Sacred Spring.

They were still as beautiful as before even after one epoch. The only difference was their new aura of invincibility, far exceeding their past selves.

After all, they were supreme geniuses who encountered a great fortune. Their cultivation soared afterward.

“You still look the same, Young Noble.” Zhuo Jianshi became sentimental.

People came and went during the eras. They never expected to see Li Qiye again.

Meanwhile, the ancestors and monarchs didn’t dare to breathe loudly during this conversation.

“Bam!” Something from the sky smashed a large pit out of the ground and interrupted them.

Everyone looked over and saw that it was none other than the girl who fought Enveloping and Six-dao Monarch earlier.

“What?!” They were shocked to see her being perfectly well.

“Did the two monarchs die?!” One divine monarch shouted in astonishment, implying that the girl was strong enough to slay them.

They were the apex of this world so if this was true, who would be able to beat her outside of Li Qiye?

“No.” An ancient monarch who has been observing the battle said: “They immediately retreated after the start of Li Qiye’s battle.”

So it turned out that the two monarchs were suppressed the moment Li Qiye created the palm despite being dimensions away.

They no longer cared about the fight with Xiao Xuan and did everything to run instead, abandoning the conquerors.

Shen Juntian wanted to fight to the death so Enveloping Monarch accepted this. As for Six-dao Monarch, he didn’t wish to risk his life for the young emperor.

After all, Six-dao considered his life to be far more precious than the young emperor. First, the latter’s defeat was inevitable so he couldn’t become a dao lord. His value plummeted as a result.

The battle wasn’t quite decided yet but it didn’t matter. The girl had proven herself unique to the cultivation world.

“How many more monsters will show up?” A crowd member wondered.

Normally, Enveloping Monarch was already untouchable. Six-dao Monarch was an even rarer sight. Now, a girl who could fight both of them popped out of nowhere. Next came the two immortal ancestors - legends from history.

However, they were still limited to the old power scale - one where a dao lord was at the top. Li Qiye destroyed this after using the palm strike and seized supremacy.

All of these masters felt insignificant while standing before Li Qiye.

“It’s you.” Xiao Xuan returned and seemed aggressive toward the two women.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Little sister, no need to be so mean.” Liu Ruyan smiled and said.

Xiao Xuan didn’t fall for her charming smile and kept her sharp glare. The other two didn’t mind because they were from the same generation.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye chuckled and left.

The two women followed him while Xiao Xuan scowled once before doing the same.

The daoist, Jian Ming, and the emperor also tagged along but they knew to keep a distance. As strong as the emperor was, he was only an ant compared to the three women, let alone Li Qiye. This applied even more to the two juniors.

Once the group was gone, the crowd members finally calmed down and regained their wits. The battle left a permanent mark on everyone’s mind.

Ancestors were normally prideful due to their prestige and power. Now, all of this was shattered since they realized their actual place in the world. They were nothing more than ants competing with other ants. This left them traumatized so some chose to train in isolation henceforth.

“It’s him!” An ancestral monarch thought of a legend that has been buried in the river of time - a forbidden existence whose name shouldn’t be said.

“Yes…” A peer who came to visit shuddered.

They recalled the existence ruling over the previous epoch whose shadow was all-encompassing. Even the mightiest emperors couldn’t escape his shadow.

With spread wings, he obliterated all of his enemies regardless of their might. 

“He has returned.” A terrifying being in Desolate Wild recognized Li Qiye. He was sure that his friends also recognized this.

Li Qiye’s return wasn’t good news at all. This could be a start of a disaster for them.
