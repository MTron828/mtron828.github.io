Chapter 5285: Heartlessness Stems From Weakness

The murderous potential of this blade could take down gods and devils, severing everything along the way. This was the limit of the mortal world, intended on piercing Li Qiye’s chest.

Li Zhitian felt his soul leaving his body. This attack was on a whole new other level compared to the one aimed at him.

“Whoosh!” While infinitely close to meeting its target, it suddenly came to a halt.

This was due to Li Qiye gripping it with his index and middle finger. Dao derivations and the various cycles of the world came to an end including the murderous affinity. He only needed two fingers to stabilize the entire universe.

“Bam!” He snapped the sword into two halves, fully surpassing the weapon’s dreadful ability. With that, he used the broken blade to perform his own move.

This attack encompassed the will of piercing - an eternal aim to take down its foe regardless of any conceivable constraint. His will manifested into the blade and pieced the swordsman’s neck, pinning him down to the boulder.

Fresh blood gushed out of the throat. Some flowed along the broken blade and onto the boulder, resulting in a gruesome scene.

His eye sockets finally showed signs of life and emotions as he lay there motionlessly.

“Killing your wives to prove the dao is nonsense, you were merely a slave to your inner demon. The pinnacle of the sword dao has no limit; its only requirement is determination, which you lack. Forsaking emotions for the sake of the sword is the action of a coward.” Li Qiye said.

“A coward…” The swordsman stared at the sky and could see certain faces popping up.

“Atone for your mistake, then you will find the sword dao you’re looking for. Otherwise, you will continue to suffer here.” Li Qiye stared at him and said coldly.

“A coward…” He didn’t seem to hear Li Qiye for he was immersed in old memories.

Li Qiye had left an everlasting seal on the boulder. True atonement was the only way for the swordsman to break free.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye told the group.

They walked quietly behind him. Although they knew that he would win, the process still shocked them.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After they were long gone, the swordsman finally looked down. Tears seemed to be building up in his eye sockets.

The group saw a magnificent expanse of mountains before them. Rays of light sprinkled down from the sky and enveloped the entire land, looking like a radiant curtain.

They could see an illusory gateway with stone steps leading up to it. Through the gateway was another world with extravagant buildings and majestic sceneries. Everything had an illusory appearance as if they weren’t real.

“Lesser Firmament!” Li Zhitian recognized the area - the reclusive home to many ancient emperors and monarchs. Some were too old to be known by the current generation.

The top cultivators in the four alliances were usually on the move. However, the ones in Lesser Firmament preferred to stay put.

The world had no idea how many emperors were still left in this mystical location. Its actual fighting potential remained unknown.

Rumor has it that these emperors have passed away from old age. Without new conquerors and dao lords to replace them, Lesser Firmament had no choice but to abstain from competing with the alliances.

Of course, some still believed that it remained immensely strong. Nonetheless, time was not on their side. These ancient emperors’ lifespans must be running out.

“Young Noble, is this your destination?” Li Zhitian asked since Li Qiye was gazing at it.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t respond, still walking forward.
