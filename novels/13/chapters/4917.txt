Chapter 4918: Visitors Don’t Come For No ReasonViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yunyun had her own palace in Abroad - truly a special privilege. Ordinary students couldn’t dream of it.

Despite the creed of equality, everyone had their own background and resources. In fact, a top master studying here could have their own palace.

Ming Shi and Goldcrest Young Noble tagged along as well. Yunyun prepared a room for Li Qiye inside her house.

It was no problem accommodating him; she only worried about gossip.

Of course, the biggest source of gossip was none other than Ming Shi who smirked at Goldcrest: “Rooster, seems like you gotta stop. Our Big Sis really has a boyfriend.”

Goldcrest didn’t like this arrangement but still accepted it. After all, they didn’t look like a couple so he wasn’t overly jealous.

The problem was that he was just a friend to Yunyun or even worse, just another student. He had no right to stop her from doing anything. Doing so would have a detrimental effect on their friendship.

As Yunyun was preparing the room, the two found themselves in an awkward situation.

“Rooster, we have to stop bothering them.” Ming Shi pulled him out.

The latter wanted to stick around but had no reason to and begrudgingly accepted.

“Young Noble, where are you from?” He couldn’t help but ask before leaving.

“Want to know who I am?” Li Qiye smiled.

“No, I’m merely curious.” He put on a forced smile.

“Curiosity kills the cat. For example, you’re a tiger-ape yet you cultivate to take the form of a rooster, isn’t there something off about this?” Li Qiye smiled and said.

Goldcrest’s expression became one of astonishment.

“Haha, you got exposed.” Ming Shi laughed and gloated at someone else’s misery: “Should the young noble keep trying? Maybe there are more secrets.”

She didn’t want him to read her secrets but didn’t have a problem when he did it to someone else.

As for Goldcrest, he was truly astounded. Fewer than few knew his cultivation.

He had met numerous big shots and geniuses in Abroad yet none was able to realize this until now.

“No, no, I’m just a little vagabond demon not worth wasting your time on.” Goldcrest was drenched in sweat and bowed toward Li Qiye once before running away.

“Coward.” Ming Shi snorted while watching the guy run for his life.

Li Qiye stared at her and asked: “Do you want me to help? I can read your fortune once.”

“You can do that too?” Ming Shi was skeptical.

“Everything is laid out in books. Reading will teach you a little bit of everything.” Li Qiye said.

“Forget it, I’m not interested.” Ming Shi ran for her life as well, feeling a bit afraid. If Li Qiye were to read her fortune, maybe he would see all of her secrets.

Yunyun was both amused and curious. How did he gain this insightful vision? The reading excuse was clearly nonsense.

“Rest for a few days then we’ll see what the academy looks like now.” Li Qiye laid down and told Yunyun.

“You’ve been to the academy before, Young Noble?” She asked.

“A very, very long time ago.” He said while staring at the ceiling. A while later, he closed his eyes, seemingly asleep.

Yunyun didn’t bother him. She bowed once and took her leave.

During this short break, a guest came to visit Yunyun.

“Brother Bai?” She didn’t expect to see Bai Shaojin.

They were not close and had only seen each other several times. She knew little about him because he didn’t stand out in this sea of students. Nonetheless, his metallic presence did leave an impression on most.

Of course, some in Abroad hid their true origin for various reasons. The nobles didn’t want unnecessary trouble while others might be hiding from pursuers.

All in all, the academy didn’t care for it and let them do as they please.

“Lord Jian.” He bowed to greet her but his eyes shifted around the room.

“Brother Jian, please call me by my name.” She politely said.

“Very well.” Shaojin smiled before looking a bit awkward: “Miss Jian, i-is your friend, that young noble, is he here?”

Yunyun knew that he was here to see Li Qiye. This piqued her interest.

“Looking for me?” Li Qiye walked into the main hall and casually said.

“Greetings, Young Noble Li.” Shaojin immediately cupped his fist and bowed.

Yunyun’s curiosity grew because this guy was particularly strange today.

Li Qiye chuckled and said: “Visitors don’t come for no reason, especially not with a smile. Why are you here?”

“It’s just that I heard you have a special ability, your eyes can see everything, that’s why I’m here to chat a little bit.” Shaojin turned red and smiled wryly.

“Chat about what?” Li Qiye held a cup of tea prepared by Yunyun.

She kept quiet and waited for Shaojin to reveal his intention.

“It’s no big deal.” He looked around a bit before replying: “I was an avid reader for forever now and enjoyed learning about the past.”

“And?” Li Qiye blew on the tea, causing steam to waft away.

Shaojin pondered for a bit before replying: “I heard that in the long distant years, there existed a regal residence built by a majestic emperor.”

“Do you want to hear about the emperor or the residence?” Li Qiye asked.

“So you are truly confident about your historical knowledge, that’s great.” Shaojin thought that he had found the right person and became excited.

“I owe it all to books.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It’s so long ago now so it's unverifiable. I heard that this emperor famous for his benevolence and righteousness embarked on a long journey.” Shaojin went on.

“Go on.” Li Qiye enjoyed the tea and said.

Yunyun patiently waited for Shaojin’s question.

“...” The youth hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth and making up his mind: “I read that the great emperor left something extremely magical before leaving on the journey. Have you heard of it before?”

“An emperor known for his benevolence and righteousness? You’re referring to the vessel titled Benevolence?” Li Qiye stared at him. [1]
