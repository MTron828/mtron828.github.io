Chapter 3576: Inquiry

Most agreed with the marquis regarding the difficulties of getting through these beasts. They didn’t have the means to sneak past them like Golden Cicada Buddhist Child. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“If only Young Noble Li is here, he’ll be able to go there without losing a hair regardless of how many beasts there are.” Yang Ling couldn’t help thinking about Li Qiye and murmured.

Though she was quiet, the senior defender had sharp ears. He immediately turned around and asked her: “Who is Young Noble Li? What is his ability?”

Yang Ling didn’t expect anyone else to hear her. She had to answer: “Young Noble Li is a woodchopper in Myriad Beast Mountains. He lives peacefully together with all the chaos primal beasts here.”

Sir Shang didn’t care much after hearing that the guy was only a woodchopper. That’s not useful to him at all.

“Just a woodchopper.” He said.

“This woodchopper is devilish though.” Someone who has seen Li Qiye before spoke out: “Even a dichromatic ape was friendly towards him and gave him its prized magical gem fruits. It’s unfathomable.”

“Dichromatic ape?” Sir Shang immediately changed his tune and asked this cultivator: “Really now?”

“It’s true, why would we be lying?” This cultivator became annoyed and said: “I’m not the only one who saw it, others who are here did too. He asked the ape to give him fruits and it did.”

The listeners were startled since they didn’t see it in person. The dichromatic ape was famous as a ferocious beast in this region. No one could get close to its magical gem tree.

“It’s a high-level heaven chaos primal beast, no one can control it.” Both Sir Shang and the marquis didn’t believe it.

“The Nightwalker Tribe knows this best.” The one being doubted turned towards the Nightwalkers.

Zhui Xueyun and the elders were present and didn’t appreciate being in the spotlight. Xueyun scowled and turned away. This was utterly humiliating and he didn’t want to bring it up again.

“That woodchopper can order the beasts here?” Sir Shang directly asked the elders.

Xueyun would have acted out if the guy asking wasn’t a big shot.

“The brat is strange indeed. He can live together with the chaos beasts, or at least the dichromatic ape.” An elder didn’t want to antagonize Vajra.

This confirmed the event so both Sir Shang and South Peak Marquis exchanged glances.

In reality, this couldn’t be fabricated since many saw it with their own eyes. It left a deep impression on them.

“Maybe if we let this Li Qiye come here, he’ll be able to talk to them and enter the valley.” One older expert suggested.

“Hmph, so what? It’s not that easy since even Golden Cicada Buddhist Child couldn’t make it through the steps, let alone a woodchopper.” Xueyun finally spoke up.

“Don’t be so sure. Young Noble Li grew up here and knows the place like the back of his hand, maybe he’ll know another path into the valley or the beasts will lead him inside. Isn’t there a world draconic king there? There must be other paths.” Yang Ling defended Li Qiye.

“Hmph. Still only a woodchopper.” To which Xueyun only snorted.

“Where is he staying?” Sir Shang has made up his mind and asked Yang Ling.

“An old temple in...” Yang Ling instinctively answered before realizing that this could cause trouble for Li Qiye. She immediately stopped.

“Where is the exact location?” Sir Shang’s eyes narrowed, looking quite fierce.

“Senior Defender, mind your words. We’re students of Duality, not subjects of the dynasty. We have no obligation to answer your questions.” Teacher Du stepped forward.

This served as a warning to Sir Shang and as a reminder to his students.

Those nearby became excited after seeing a potential conflict between Duality and Vajra.

Vajra was the sun in the current generation. However, Duality has been around for so many years, witnessing one dao lord after another. This was a testament to its power. It had no need to suck up to Vajra so a teacher there could speak to a senior defender in this manner.

“Fellow Daoist Du, you can’t put it that way.” Sir Shang was a fierce general who had killed plenty of people. He strongly responded: “This pertains to the foundation of the holy ground, which is why its current leader, Vajra Dynasty, is being involved. The golden egg can’t fall into evil hands. Everyone should work together and share the responsibility with His Majesty.”

“Sure, that’s true for the officials of Vajra, not the members of Duality.” Teacher Du didn’t give him any face and responded: “That’s why you need to stop interrogating our students.”

He was as clear as can be, not allowing the senior defender to question Yang Ling.

“Duality Academy is quite imperious now.” One spectator commented.

Many powers weren’t under the jurisdiction of Vajra but they still gave it some face, at least on the surface. Duality wasn’t one of them.

“Don’t forget how Duality was built.” An older expert said: “Duality Master creating the academy back then actually affected the foundation of Buddha Holy Ground. The academy was nothing in the past but it still maintained an unyielding attitude. This isn’t something new.”

“Everything belongs to the king, do you dare to not listen...” Sir Shang’s eyes turned cold.

He was part of the Ministry of War so his stance was naturally on the side of the dynasty. He also had the belief that Buddha Holy Ground belonged to Vajra.

“Senior Defender, I don’t agree.” An old teacher immediately shouted back: “Have you forgotten about Sacred Mountain? The holy ground is led by Sacred Mountains and the supreme. The king doesn’t possess everything!”

Sir Shang’s expression changed, realizing that he had carelessly misspoken.

Vajra was current in charge but it was only because Sacred Mountain didn’t want to directly rule the holy ground. The real master of this region was Sacred Moutain and its supreme. Though the latter hasn’t shown up in a long time, he was still the apex existence here.

The strongest in the south weren’t the four grandmasters but the two supremes. One of them was the master of Sacred Mountain.

The holy ground started with Sacred Mountain. The source of Buddhism was also there. Vajra was only a manager of sorts. Sir Shang has overstepped his bounds with the previous comment.

“Ahem.” South Peak Marquis tried to mediate the situation: “Focus on the issue at hand right now which is how to obtain the golden egg by working together. If anyone has a good idea, feel free to say it. For example, that woodchopper mentioned earlier might be one.”

No one else brought up the issue again after this divergence.

“Who’s the first to understand the grand dao, no one else but me...” Suddenly, an ode could be heard from a distance.
