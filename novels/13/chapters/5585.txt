Chapter 5586: No Sense Of Propriety

“Whoosh!” The pulse tore the sky apart along with the incoming horns and its owner.

“Rumble!” The gigantic demon fell backward and destroyed mountains along the way, leaving spectators slack-jawed.

This dragon lord’s sacred tree was significantly larger than Wang Teng’s. He had fought against the generals of Celestial Court previously, rarely tasting defeat.

Today, just a bright pulse from the throwing star alone put an end to him, not giving him a chance to utilize his strongest merit law and sacred tree. He could have put up a fight against apex cultivators for a while, but not today.

His eyes were wide open in astonishment. Never did he think that death would come to him in this pathetic manner.

During his last second, he recalled how he had fought against Heaven Burial Conqueror before. He was the clear underdog and the fight reflected the power gap. Nonetheless, he lasted a long time. What was that flash just now?

He lamented not being able to go down heroically to mirror his life’s achievements.

Tides of blood gushed out of his dismembered corpse but something happened before they could do considerable damage.

The blood started to change along with the corpse, eventually turning into immeasurable radiance. They burst outward like fireworks in the night sky before breaking down into particles. They scattered and enveloped Dao City in its entirety.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The flowers and grass, trees and leaves… every inch of land was touched and nourished by the particles. They have been turned into worldly essences, imbuing divinity to the affected.

His vitality, dao power, and chaos true energy undoubtedly returned to Dao City.

“Look at how the land is flourishing, that’s just one dragon lord. What if there are more, emperors and monarchs too?” A spectator commented.

Mortals didn’t understand this event’s significance, unlike cultivators. The death of one dragon lord released enough energy to gestate this region for generations to come.

The world had no lack of top cultivators. If all of their vitality and energy somehow returned to the world, it could turn the immortal continent into paradise.

He hurriedly closed his mouth, realizing the folly of his speech. If anyone else were to hear this, it would be hell for him.

Meanwhile, others contemplated the outcome of the fight. Sure, the immortal weapon was deadly but what was that aftermath?

The battlefields outside of Dao City served as graves for countless emperors and monarchs. Their death resulted in perilous and forbidden zones - the opposite of what had just occurred.

“How cruel.” Wang Taishou uttered. Others could hear the contained rage in his voice.

Imperial West Bank had suffered grievous losses today. This was an irreconcilable feud.

“Just a few dogs so far, exercise further lack of propriety and I’ll end your clan.” Li Qiye responded.

Listeners felt suffocated after hearing the threat but none thought that he was being outrageous. Given the power of the immortal weapon, he might actually be able to destroy Imperial West Bank.

It seemed unimaginable that the pillar of Dao City might be broken by an unknown cultivator, not Celestial Court. Its collapse would have an astonishing impact on the continent.

“Hahaha, how fierce while holding an unstoppable weapon. Although we might fall to you today, our clan is inferior to none!” West Bank Prime Emperor laughed and admitted the threat of the weapon.

His voice still echoed thunderously with a celestial might, causing others to prostrate in fear.
