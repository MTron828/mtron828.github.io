Chapter 4225: Vastsea Venerable

A hidden wall deeper in the island actually stopped the slash. Alas, both the ocean and the spectators were blown away by the shockwaves. Screams echoed everywhere.

Once the blast subsided and people calmed down, they saw a withered hand catching Vastsea.

It was full of wrinkles and looked like a chicken foot. People instantly knew how old this cultivator was right away.

Despite its feeble appearance, it managed to stop Vastsea. The grip on it was as tight as can be. It seemed that if he pulled the sword up, he would be dragging the rest of the world with it. Spectators became tense right away from the pressure, aware that this being’s hand could easily crush their throat.

“Who is it?” Someone asked in fear while being completely immersed in this new development.

“Fellow Daoist, no need to be angry. If you wish to see Myriad Era, come on in.” An old voice came from the depth and the hand was pulled back.

Even his voice instilled chills and sharp pains for the listeners - another sign of his power.

“So strong!” The crowd thought.

“That’s Vastsea Venerable.” An ancient ancestor took a deep breath and revealed.

“He’s here too?!” Expressions changed after hearing this.

This renowned cultivator immediately captivated the crowd after appearing. They exchanged glances and started talking.

“Both Earthraiser Vajra and Vastsea Venerable are here.” A roused spectator stated.

In reality, the big shots didn’t find this too surprising since Earthraiser Vajra was here as well. They were mentally prepared but still found it incredible.

There were only three active overlords currently and two were here. Moreover, they were on the same side as well.

Just one alone was hard enough to deal with, let alone both. Eyes turned towards Li Qiye, wondering if he would accept the invite.

Of course, this invitation wasn’t for a tea party and idle chat. Li Qiye had declared war on the behemoths. These two cultivators wouldn’t spare him.

“Can Li Qiye handle both at the same time?” A cultivator asked since the situation escalated.

“Li Qiye is as frightening and heaven-defying as can be. But, it does look bad.” Another answered.

After all, these two men represented the apex of Sword Continent. By this point, it would be foolish to ever bet against Li Qiye but the odds were stacked against him.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I actually think he has a chance, more or less, in a one-on-one fight. But both together? No one in our land can win.” A big shot mused.

Others nodded in agreement.

“Perfect.” Li Qiye stretched and accepted the invitation. He climbed up the palanquin and relaxed lazily.

“March.” Xu Yiyun knew what to do and commanded. The legion headed deeper into the sea region.

“Seven Nights Immortal, utterly incomparable!” The beautiful members chanted again - truly a sight for sore eyes.

The chants became louder and louder before the astounded audience. Normally, going against two overlords would make anyone nervous. In fact, their legs might tremble along the way.

Alas, Li Qiye’s group showed no sign of fear. Most came from powerful sects but they still weren’t on the same level as the two behemoths.

In any other scenario, they would be overwhelmed with fear instead of being able to shout ostentatiously in this manner. Today, Li Qiye emboldened them and allowed them to march proudly against two great beings. This was indeed a glorious moment in their life.

Not long ago, the crowd would find this distasteful and pompous. Now, they were impressed by the members’ audacious courage.
