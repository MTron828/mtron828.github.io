Bingchi Hanyu’s comment made everyone stare at Li Qiye. A few held their breath. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“She’s right.” Someone else quietly supported her: “He still thinks of himself as a king instead of becoming smart enough to tuck his tail between his legs. Being arrogant and raising his tail will only result in an early death.”

Li Qiye turned towards Hanyu and smiled: “You’re that princess from the Bingchi? Getting a new lease of life after sending a fake princess instead so you think you’re a noble, a phoenix among women now?”

Hanyu’s expression soured. Everyone knew about the marriage agreement back then and that she should have been the one sent to the palace if it wasn’t for her clan’s deceit.

It wasn’t a proud matter so no one would want to say it in public. That’s why she became a bit awkward right now.

“Self-awareness is a virtue, it will save you from embarrassment.” She found Li Qiye increasingly exasperating.

“I agree with you on that.” Li Qiye said: “An untrustworthy person, bereft of honor, shouldn’t prance around all day, acting all beautiful and such. They would only be throwing away the reputation of their ancestors. Let’s not act noble and show off your bloodline when you can’t even maintain the most fundamental virtue of keeping one’s promise. You’re only besmirching your ancestors by doing so.”

“...” Her expression turned ugly from the verbal slap before everyone.

“Young Noble Li, watch your words!” Bofan shouted with an aggressive glare.

Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at him and casually responded: “You want to teach me how to speak? Tell your master to come instead. He was fortunate enough to be spared last time but I will make a chamber pot out of his head now.”

The crowd gasped after hearing this. Some became frozen while staring at him. They have all heard of this infamous king but it looked like the rumors were all true. This guy would say anything without scruples.

Yang Bofan was ready to kill since Li Qiye publicly insulted his master. How could he swallow this anger and let this nobody run his mouth?

“You don’t know your own limits.” Hanyu snorted.

In the beginning, she didn’t hate him but as time went on, the guy didn’t change and was still as annoying either. He brought everything upon himself with his personality.

Bofan took one step forward and uttered coldly: “My master doesn’t need to do anything since I’m more than enough to handle you! Let’s see what you can do!”

He had nothing but contempt for the guy; his eyes flashed with murderous intent.

The crowd watched with bated breath. Bofan’s power was unquestionable and could kill the king as easily as taking candy from a baby.

Tang Hexiang had a gloating smile. Nothing would be better than if Bofan were to kill Li Qiye.

If he wanted to be emperor, he needed to kill Li Qiye anyway since the guy was the rightful ruler, the successor of Lucidity King. In fact, just abolishing him required more deliberation in the dynasty before it became official.

So, if Li Qiye were to be killed right now, he wouldn’t have to do so himself and bear the infamy of being a kingslayer.

“Gentlemen.” Right before the explosion, Jianyao stood up and said: “It’s rare for all of us to gather, this is a joyous occasion, let’s not ruin it with blood.”

For some reason, intuition told her that something big was going to happen, and her intuition has always been accurate.

Who wouldn’t want to give her face? This was her party, and not giving her any respect was far out of line.

“I’ll listen to you, Fairy Qin.” Bofan cupped his fist towards Jianyao and slightly bowed before glaring one last time at Li Qiye.

“Come, come, drink again.” Tang Hexiang was disappointed and started toasting people.

“Cheers, Fairy Qin, General Tang, everyone!” The atmosphere became lively again with cups being raised.

Hanyu saw that Li Qiye was still there and no longer wanted to stay. She told Jianyao: “I’ve only arrived recently to Nine-linked and have things to do. Please excuse me.”

“I’m sure you’re not used to the area, allow me to see you off.” Jianyao replied.

Hanyu didn’t refuse so the two of them said bye to the rest before leaving the stone forest.

Hanyu’s departure was understandable but Jianyao had her reasons too. She felt that something was amiss and didn’t dare to face Li Qiye. Thus, she took advantage of this and left in order to observe any changes from the sideline.

Li Qiye ignored the crowd and stared at the throne then the statues to the left and right. They stood like guards with spears propped to the ground.

Unfriendly gazes were on him. Yang Bofan and Ma Jinming actually wanted to kill him.

Bofan couldn’t let go of the insult towards his master earlier. As for Ma Jinming, his young cousin was killed by Li Qiye. Moreover, the guy had embarrassed him again and again.

Tang Hexiang was calmer than the rest. He sat there with a smile, seemingly wanting to see a fun show.

A strange atmosphere pervaded because with Jianyao gone, both Bofan and Jinming wanted to do something.

Li Qiye seemed oblivious to the hostility. He started walking up the steps towards the platform with Chuqing next to him.

Everyone was watching, not knowing what he wanted to do.

“What is he doing?” Someone whispered.

“Who the hell knows. No one can read such a ridiculous person.”

“Hmm, now that I think about it, what is that place?” Some started looking at the platform and statues.

“No idea.” Though the party was in the stone forest, no one cleaned the higher steps and platform. Jianyao didn’t dare to do so and chose to stay at the bottom instead.

“I’ve heard of this place.” An older expert watched Li Qiye and said: “This is the Platform of Virtue. Back in the old days, the ancestors of Nine-linked gathered the sages everywhere. This practice ended later on for some unknown reasons.”

People glanced at each other since it was their first time hearing this name.

In fact, Nine-linked was older than any other lineage, including War Saint Dynasty and the other five behemoths. That’s why most of its tales were unknown to outsiders.

He made it to the top of the platform and glanced at the throne. With a simper, he didn’t mind that it was dirty and sat down.

Remember, the platform was carved out of the ridge of the two peaks. When he sat on the throne, he could look down on everyone at the banquet. It looked like he was the king and they were his officials.

“Since so many have gathered here today, it’s time to end this trite show.”

Everyone quieted down just to listen, not because of his amazing prestige but they were curious about his intention.

“I’ll let everyone know right now - the play is over. Time for me to bare my fangs. I don’t care if you’re a dragon or a tiger, you better obediently lie down on the ground or blood shall flow.”

“Hmph, such a big tone.” Jinming said with disdain: “You think the land is still yours?. Are you dreaming right now?”

“It is indeed, just like before. I am still its master, it’s not too late for all of you to kneel.” Li Qiye smiled at Jinming and declared.
