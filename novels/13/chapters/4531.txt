Chapter 4532: The Yu

Li Qiye’s contemptuous attitude towards True Immortal meant a declaration of war.

Listeners took a deep breath. How many cultivators in the world would dare to do the same thing?

“His audacity has no bounds. Does he think he’s unbeatable?” One youth blurted.

“An unbeatable cultivator would still need to think twice before declaring war on True Immortal. The worst-case scenario is clan extermination.” A last-gen cultivator thought that Li Qiye’s words were arrogant and unwise.

“What sect is he from?” A few experts pondered this question.

“It doesn’t matter, even someone from Three Thousand Dao wouldn’t do this carelessly, the same for Dao Sanqian.” Another stated.

No one refuted this fact. Though True Immortal wasn’t as strong as it used to be during Blessed Dao Lord’s era, it was still an untouchable behemoth.

Dao Sanqian, a true master that has tested time itself, wouldn’t go against True Immortal without ample deliberation.

“This is a case of being too ignorant for your own good.” A clan elder shook his head.

Everyone thought that Li Qiye had messed with the beehive. There would be no place for him to stay in Eight Desolaces.

“Boom!” A loud explosion drew everyone’s attention.

They looked up and saw Untethered Vajra and Wise Ancestor performing an ultimate move. This resulted in both of them falling down to the ground.

Untethered Vajra struggled to breathe but nonetheless, he cupped his fist and said: “I cannot defeat the peerless sword art of your clan.”

Those in the know would find this ridiculous because the Wu wasn’t known for their swordsmanship. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wise Ancestor smiled wryly. He didn’t use any power at all; Untethered Vajra did most of the work.

“You’re too kind.” He had no choice but to play along.

“I can’t believe that a weakened clan still has such a mighty ancestor.” One spectator said with admiration after seeing Wise in action.

“How disgraceful of me.” The vajra stared at Alchemy Child’s corpse and then said with regrets: “I was too weak to protect you and couldn’t carry out True Immortal’s request.”

Having said that, he told the disciples from the sect to take Alchemy Child’s corpse away. There was nothing else they could do anyway due to their limited power. They were fortunate enough to survive.

“I’m afraid your future path won’t be easy but I’m sure you will rise above anyway. I feel inadequate in comparison.” The vajra said.

“Inadequate or just lazy?” Li Qiye smirked.

The vajra smiled wryly and said: “A vagabond such as myself has no power to speak of. Even if I had gone all out, it would just be an ant trying to push down a tree.”

“Go.” Li Qiye let him go.

“May we meet again.” The vajra cupped his fist and left.

The spectators also dispersed afterward.

“The guy should be an actor.” Jian Ming commented. He knew how powerful Wise Ancestor was and that the old man didn’t go all out. However, the vajra acted as if he was struggling for his life.

“That’s the only way for him to deal with True Immortal.” Wise shook his head.

“He probably did it on purpose to get rid of that annoying brat. The guy had no idea what the hell happened before dying.” The daoist smiled and said.

Alchemy Child would be screaming in the yellow river if he were to find out the circumstances of his death. He only came seeking the grass because he thought Untethered Vajra would be able to protect him.

“The old man is a crafty one, I better watch out to not become a victim later.” Jian Ming said and added the vajra to his black list.

“There’s a reason why he traveled the world and came out unscathed. It’s not easy being a vagabond and dealing with the great powers.” Wise smiled.

“Might not be a vagabond.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Right, there is a high chance of him being from an ancient sect. It’s either reclusive or too weak to matter now with only a few members.” The daoist nodded.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye didn’t care about this issue.

“Yes, back to the Yu.” Jian Ming led the way again.

“Remember, don’t cause trouble. We’re the ones asking for a favor.” Wise warned again.

Jian Ming only smiled. Since he had such a mighty backer, there was no way the Yu could escape this time.

Eventually, the group stopped by an isolated hill outside the city. Jian Ming looked around and said: “It’s right here, this is where the thieves live.” He then looked up.

There were white clouds stacking each other, looking like a snowy mountain range.

Li Qiye looked up and chuckled.

“I’ll get them out, they can’t hide forever.” Jian Ming took out a puppet and placed it on top of the hill.

“Fire!” He gave the order and the puppet started shooting massive shells.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The explosions made the clouds disperse.

“This is your peaceful measure?” Wise glared at him.

“Haha, I forgot…” Jian Ming smiled awkwardly but didn’t stop the shelling.

“Who is it?!” Figures appeared amidst the cloud and started descending.

Flying wasn’t a big deal for cultivators. Some used swords and treasures to fly. However, these figures moved like monkeys leaping in the forest. Instead of branches, they leaped from one cloud to another.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” Muscular men in tight clothes landed in front of the group.

“Why did you attack us?!” One of them shouted.

“It’s just a misunderstanding, we’re on the same side. Brothers, long time no see.” Jian Ming smiled and said.

The members of the Yu recognized him. The middle-aged man who spoke first said: “Brat, what are you doing?”

It looked like Jian Ming had dealt with them before.

“See, birds of a feather.” The daoist mumbled.

“Our ancestor wants to see Fat Yu, it’s important.” Jian Ming got really close to them, standing shoulder to shoulder.

Of course, the four clans and the Yu could be considered in-laws.
