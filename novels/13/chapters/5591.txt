Chapter 5592: Cleansing The Sinners

The old man’s existence alone suppressed Dao Domain in its entirety, no different from a divine mountain. However large Dao Domain, the metaphorical mountain was the same size.

The chaos he walked out of seemed to be a passage from the river of time. Countless years polished him without leaving significant damage, only improvements.

Top cultivators became frozen after seeing him. His large hands could kill everything in the region.

He possessed enough power to overturn the heavens and flip the earth. They were nothing more than mere objects within his grasp.

His aura exuded an ancient charm, showing his godlike status. In the distant past, his title and legends were whispered with reverence and fear.

The People knew that he was a formidable enemy.

“War Ancient God!” One of them became serious.

“This is War?” The oldest emperors and dao lords were shaken.

Those who rose recently in the immortal continent weren’t familiar with this title. Alas, anyone who had participated in the previous wars knew him all too well.

As for those who had lived during the period of the thirteen continents, they have witnessed his legends previously.

War Ancient God enjoyed a supreme status in Celestial Court, not inferior to Light-dragon or Heaven Burial Conqueror. This applied to the late Crimson Emperor and Immortal Emperor Hao Hai as well.

He served as one of the few leaders of Celestial Court, being the chief commander of its armies. He participated in the main battles during Immemorial Epoch and Grand Dao War.

His presence and the sheer scale of the invasion showed that this had been in the works for a long period. Celestial Court seemed determined to take over Dao Domain.

Putting his military leadership aside, he was an apex cultivator - the second ancient god to possess twelve totems and the killer of many emperors and monarchs. His lethal streak didn’t stop during the subsequent wars either.

The big shots from Dao Domain had an ominous feeling about this sudden invasion.

“Dao Brother, what is the meaning of this?” Luminous asked once more, aware of the unfavorable circumstances. He was not optimistic in the slightest in their odds against Celestial Court this time around.

“Celestial Court oversees the heavenly dao and the world shall change.” War declared sonorously: “Effective immediately, it is time for The People to cleanse the sin of their blood by pledging allegiance to Celestial Court and accepting its light.”

His oppressive divinity enveloped Dao City. None could withstand the pressure. Cultivators and ancestors were mere ants in comparison, dropping down on their knees and losing the will to fight.

Only those at the imperial level could stay relatively calm.

“The People already have a home, Dao City.” Luminous maintained a strong stance despite lacking reinforcement.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

His voice dispelled War’s imperious message, allowing people to breathe again. His light permeated every inch of land, protecting weaker cultivators.

They felt as if he was one with Dao Domain, capable of stopping the monstrous invaders. His matchless presence gave them hope and courage once more.

Their blood boiled, believing that as long as he was still around, Dao Domain would never fall.

“Dao City is our home, we will never yield!” Emperors and monarchs roared thunderously, echoing their support.

“We will never yield!” Others answered the rallying cry and were ignited with passion. They vowed not to retreat, wanting to fight to the very end.

This was not the first existential crisis they had faced due to Celestial Court.
