Chapter 5449: Buddhist Emperor

The dragon lords and conquerors in the group varied in age. However, their auras were full of youthful vigor. This lineage was clearly not as old as the Imperial Clan.

The leader was an ordinary-looking old man yet the rest still treated him with reverence. He hid an impressive physique beneath his plain robe.

His white beard looked rather stiff and prickly to the touch. His broad shoulders and robust hands made him look trustworthy and willing to bear any burden.

“Principle Conqueror and the Lu are here too.” Spectators became even more startled than during the appearance of the Imperial Clan.

“Principle Conqueror is finally making a move?” A dragon lord took a deep breath.

“Are they helping Divine Alliance?” Those on the side of The People didn’t like this development, especially the ones involved in the battle.

The Imperial Clan was powerful but they were no longer in their prime. They lacked an apex cultivator so they posed a limited threat to either side.

The same couldn’t be said about Principle Conqueror and his clan - a force capable of tipping the scales. The Lu was in their prime with many capable cultivators but most importantly, Principle Conqueror was another apex cultivator.

“This is it, potentially the deciding factor.” A dragon lord took a deep breath.

Previously, the Lu was considered the strongest clan in the upper continents. However, Principle Conqueror abdicated and his clan also left Divine Alliance. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

They lived reclusively afterward and everyone thought that they were finished with the conflict. Alas, their sudden appearance could change the outcome of this battle.

Spectators thought that both the Imperial Clan and the Lu were on the side of The Race. Although the Lu had a soured relationship with Divine Alliance, this was still their home for a long period in history. It made sense that they would show up during this existential crisis.

The arrival of these two factions could bring a swift end to the conflict.

“Boom!” A divine beam descended, paving the way for an old man and his legion.

He was massive with a metallic body, looking like an unbreakable pillar. The members of the legion were just as impressive visually.

When he slightly tilted, everyone could see a girl standing on his shoulder. She possessed a timeless presence as if she was the source of an entire race. Everyone could sense a terrifying power oozing from her delicate frame.

“Azure Ancestor, Sentinel Treant…” A neutral conqueror couldn’t believe it.

“Azure Peak is here too.” One dao lord put on a serious expression.

“I can’t believe it, they’re joining this too?” One dragon lord commented in astonishment due to the historical neutrality of Azure Peak. Furthermore, Azure Ancestor had not left Azure Peak for eras now.

“Are they here to help The People?” A dragon lord from The Race wondered.

“Right, they should be with The People.” His friend whispered.

The reason was due to the perceived close relationship between Azure Peak and Dao Alliance. Moreover, Swordsky Dao Lord was a sky spirit as well.

“Who knows? Azure Peak is from Eight Desolaces, it might be here for another reason?” A dao lord from Eight Desolaces shook her head.

Eight Desolaces didn’t have the notion of The People and The Race. This classification was unique to the six continents. Thus, Azure Peak shouldn’t have that many attachments to The People.

Nonetheless, it should be noted that Dao and Imperial Alliance had many dao lords who came from Eight Desolaces. In that sense, Azure Peak would have closer ties to them due to sharing the same background.

“Buzz.” A Buddhist bridge formed on the horizon and landed near the battlefield as well. Buddhist hymns could be heard, painting the images of hallowed beings in everyone’s mind even before their appearance.

“Pure Land too?” Listeners became emotional.

Sure enough, high monks appeared on the bridge. Each of them had totems and images of seven-floor pagodas, inspiring a profound sense of reverence in all spectators.
