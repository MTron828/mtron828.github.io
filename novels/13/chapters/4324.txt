Chapter 4325: Billowing Fog

It has been a long time since the ward had this many visitors. Of course, this was still far from being comparable to its golden years.

The first was personally presided over by the Supreme Monarch. The subsequent ones had the presence of top masters working together. The greatest visual phenomena and auras in the world were seen here.

Nonetheless, this was still a momentous event relative to the conference’s current state.

However, the newfound excitement was interrupted by something strange tonight in Myriad Sect Mountain.

“Boom!” Earthquakes alarmed everyone in the ward.

“What’s going on?!” They woke up and got out of bed, feeling the constant explosions and quakes.

“Something big is happening.” They rushed out of their rooms.

Some personally flew; others rode beasts, treasures, and banners. They wanted to see what was going on deeper into the mountain range.

Everything intensified to its limit before black fog billowed out of the source. One could hear screams and roars along with various noises of battle.

“What the hell?!” The black fog scared the hell out of the spectators. They hurriedly rushed back to the ward.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Warning gongs were struck.

All the buildings in the ward lit up and sent out rays, eventually forming a massive barrier. It served as a dam to stop the billowing fog.

“Boom!” The ward was being affected from within. Something sealed seemed to be awakening deep in the mountain range.

“What is that?” Everyone became startled. The young ones from the smaller sects felt their legs trembling and turned pale from fear.

The ghastly noises from the fog scared the hell out of them. Nonetheless, the presence of so many top cultivators made them feel safe enough not to turn and run. Alas, they didn’t know that these cultivators were frightened as well.

“Don’t be afraid, the Supreme Monarch had left behind a suppressive power at the ward. It has been blessed by countless sages, no evil can get through.” An expert roared, giving himself courage along with everyone else.

This gave the mass enough hope because sure enough, the barrier was stopping the fog from expanding.

“Yes, the Supreme Monarch erected a divine altar here, it will automatically activate against any evil that dares to show itself.” An expert from a great power revealed.

The crowd thought that the barrier must have come from this so-called altar.

“I see, there’s a divine altar here.” Many heaved a sigh of relief.

The Supreme Monarch was the ultimate being in their mind. They believed that her altar could destroy gods and devils regardless of how strong they were.

“But what is it though?” A minor from a small sect still asked while staring at the fog.

“It might be an evil artirfact.” Her sect master whispered.

“They sound like the wailing souls of evil creatures after death.” An expert could hear the cries and speculated.

“Perhaps. There might be darkness buried beneath this land.” A big shot of a great power added.

“Rumor has it that during the great calamity, darkness descended to destroy the world. A mighty cultivator from Heavenguard Mountain retaliated and destroyed this darkness. Unfortunately, the mythical sect went down as well. Could this fog be the previous darkness?” An elder said.

“Didn’t you just say that the darkness was destroyed?” A youth questioned.

“Who knows what actually happened, it’s just a legend. But if we are to believe it, then there might be darkness still buried underground. It’s finally surfacing after countless eras.” The elder shook his head.

“I hope not…” The youth turned pale and said: “Wouldn’t that mean the end of us here? Shouldn’t we start running?”

“Where do we run?” The elder continued: “That darkness wanted to destroy the entire world. Insects like us will die no matter where we are.”

The young ones from the weaker sects were horrified. One of them suggested: “Maybe we should leave the ward first.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Stop being nervous? Look, the barrier stopped the fog already.” A disciple from a great power snorted: “Plus, when the altar of the Supreme Monarch fully activates, it’ll annihilate this thing.”

His confidence successfully put the crowd’s mind at ease.

Nonetheless, it was a sleepless night for many. When they woke up, they saw that the fog was still only billowing deeper in the mountain range, unable to get through the barrier. It seemed that the latter was truly effective.

Another development happened in the morning. This one was favorable.

“The heir has arrived!” Listeners heard this and felt much better.

The heir was obviously powerful and with him here, everything should be fine. Moreover, if the situation were to deteriorate somehow, he could summon many experts from Lion’s Roar.

“Why didn’t we receive any command about a reception?” One youth questioned. No one knew about his arrival at all.

“His Highness is keeping it simple, traveling in a regular outfit.” An elder heard about this from somewhere.

“Really?” This surprised both the members of weak and strong sects.

This was due to the previous precedence - the arrival of the young lord from Dragon. All the sects had to come out and kneeled. He also brought a powerful battalion along too.
