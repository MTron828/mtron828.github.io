Tetra Tribulation True Fate was entirely unique in history and should hypothetically be comparable to a true immortal’s true fate.

If one were to use the perspective of regular cultivators, Li Qiye should be considered a true immortal by this point.

The three immortals themselves couldn’t help admiring his true fate. Just this alone was enough to be invincible, no need for the grand dao and a powerful physique.

As for the top masters in the expanse? They stared at the true fate in awe, having never seen such a thing before. It was simply beyond their imagination, breaking their existing knowledge regarding true fates. Such a true fate shouldn’t be allowed to exist.

“Not an immortal yet above one.” Everyone said with admiration.

“Just seeing this true fate in person is more than one can ask for in life.” One progenitor added.

Everyone else was quite satisfied to witness this apex.

“Time might have limits but not the grand dao.” A member of the Decemvirate felt lost.

Through the years, very few people have reached their level. During their own generation, they thought they had reached the limit of the dao. Just another step would take them to the apex.

Alas, they felt insignificant before Li Qiye’s achievements. They were nothing more than frogs under a well in the past.

They realized that they weren’t close to reaching the limit of the dao at all, far from it. This was akin to the massive expanse stopping them from reaching the other shore.

“The dao is limitless indeed.” The three immortals agreed.

They certainly stood at the top in their world. In fact, they weren’t that intimidated by the dark existences because they were at a similar level.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, shattered all conventional wisdom. They realized that they still had a way to go.

“Immortals, if they exist, still can’t be more powerful than him.” One of the three said.

Because of their height, they were able to get a good gauge on Li Qiye’s current abilities. The only thing Li Qiye was lacking was everlasting life.

“Yo, Villainous Heaven, don’t be so stingy now, it’s just a little tribulation.” Li Qiye looked up at the sky and smirked.

Thunderous detonations and flashes up in the azure answered him. Wrath seemed to be building up there; the high heaven seemingly wanted to send out another blow to destroy Li Qiye.

Alas, nothing came down. The ocean of lighting slowly dispersed and light returned again as if nothing had happened.

Men couldn’t come close to speculating about the heaven’s whims. The new tribulation seemed eager to strike earlier but it simply dispersed.

Li Qiye wasn’t surprised at all to see this, evident by the smile on his face.

Meanwhile, the rest realized that the high heaven had abandoned the idea of destroying Li Qiye. No more tribulations would come.

Perhaps it thought that tribulations were no longer effective? Li Qiye’s grand dao has been perfected to the point where he wouldn’t die to one.

“Anyone else?” Li Qiye turned his focus at the expanse and his eyes swept through the area.

He saw everything clearly, from the swimming fish to the shells at the bottom, the islands, the inhabitants... All were within his grasp. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The top masters regained their wits during this observation process.

“Uncrossable Expanse is normal again now.” One of them said.

“Yes.” The others agreed, feeling quite happy as a result.

It has returned to its previous state before the invasion of darkness. Their anxiety and fear have all but disappeared. The place became a paradise for adventures again.

There were still fierce monsters and evil creatures around along with dangerous areas such as void zones and storms... These things were enough to kill progenitors.

However, they were part of the world. Adventures and conflicts of this type were perfectly fine. Some of them would be more than happy to participate despite the risks.

In fact, a few believed that to go down during an adventure was a type of happiness. Their life would be as brilliant as the fireworks during the night.

On the other hand, succumbing to the darkness? This corruption wasn’t what they wanted.

As Li Qiye continued to search, the progenitors understood that the darkness was no longer around at the expanse.

“Let’s build a supreme kingdom.” One progenitor’s ambition was at an all-time high. He could set sail on a new adventure.

Being a progenitor meant searching and fighting forever. A “safe” expanse became the perfect place.

“We can relax and do what we want now.” Other people started leaving.

The darkness made them tread with caution. Some decided to hide instead of traveling freely in the expanse, especially those who had their own minor dimension or lineage.

They focused on protecting their home and even formed alliances in order to keep watch, afraid of being tempted by the darkness.

Now, they no longer needed to stay around as protectors. They could do whatever they wanted now.

“He saved both Three Immortals and the expanse.” The majority kneeled towards Li Qiye in order to show their gratitude and respect.

These dark years would have gone on for who knows how long? More progenitors would have fallen.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the sun has returned to the expanse once more.

“Buzz.” Suddenly, a bridge materialized from the horizon and connected to this location. It had three separate lights and holy runes. It naturally attracted everyone’s attention due to its immortal aura.
