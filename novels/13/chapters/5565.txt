Chapter 5566: Legendary Immortal Weapons

Nonetheless, the best imperial weapons paled in comparison versus that beam just now. It could cut any of them into two halves.

“An immortal-level weapon or a paragon artifact.” An emperor commented.

“No, even stronger than a paragon artifact.” A stronger cultivator nearby had a gleam in her eyes.

“We must take a look.” Everyone became interested in this development, especially the strong.

Some of these emperors and dao lords had seen paragon weapons before but not something stronger.

After all, few paragon weapons have been seen in history. As for immortal weapons? They only existed in the legends or possessed that classification in an empty manner.

“Momentous Frontier belongs to the mortals, I don’t think we should go.” A dragon lord worried since the deities there didn’t welcome powerful cultivators.

Of course, none wanted to provoke this group either. They were a force to be reckoned with and regular emperors and monarchs weren’t qualified to oppose them.

Because of this, few top cultivators had visited Momentous Frontier, let alone caused any trouble there.

“We’re just going to take a look, not like we’re going to do anything.” An ancient god didn’t stop at all.

Drastic options might be necessary later on but for now, they merely wanted to scout the situation. Momentous Frontier didn’t ban visitors, only troublemakers.

Of course, some remained cautious and ordered their disciples and descendants to go first while they hid in the background.

Just like that, Momentous Frontier became a popular destination for cultivators all over the world.

Top cultivators hid their aura while avoiding mortals during their visit. Nonetheless, this was akin to dragons entering a shallow pond.

Mortals still trembled, aware that something strange was happening. Nevertheless, the protection and blessing of the deities comforted them. As long as their faith and the deities were around, their safety was guaranteed.

Space Dragon Emperor and the others heaved a sigh of relief and wanted to get up. However, Li Qiye gestured for them to continue the meditation.

“Control and become one with it, that is how you will be able to reach the true golden age in perpetuity.” Li Qiye said before commanding the dao in the tablet to crumble.

“Rumble!” This was akin to countless rocks and boulders falling into a lake.

“Zzz…” The runes started splitting and flying toward the various deities, catching them off guard.

The deities calmed down and gazed at the runes surrounding them like water. They understood that Li Qiye was doing them a favor - they could now thoroughly absorb Momentous Dao and become one with it for absolute control.

Given their achievements and experiences, they didn’t need any instruction before opening their palaces and revealing their grand dao along with their true fate.

Their anima started pulsing during the absorption and harmonization procedures. Their breathing became perfectly in tune with the region. The mortals’ breathing also affected the deities, creating a symbiotic cycle.

“We’re leaving.” Li Qiye told Niu Fen and Qin Baifeng.

After they left the area of the tablet, Niu Fen asked: “Young Master, where are we going?”

“Have to find that weapon, cannot let it escape.” Li Qiye said.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Baifeng recalled the slash and the beam prior, nearly chasing the soul out of her body. She shuddered and said: “What is this weapon?”

“A true immortal weapon.” Niu Fen had a serious expression.

“They actually exist in this world?” Baifeng found this hard to believe since there were no immortals.

“Yes, and more than just one.” Niu Fen said.

“More than just one?” Baifeng became even more surprised.

“One back in Black Tides.” Niu Fen said.

“Just a broken one.” Li Qiye responded.

“And I still couldn’t get it.” Niu Fen smiled wryly, having coveted and attempted to seize the weapon in the past.

“It’s not that easy and most importantly, that is also the resting place of its master. The guy didn’t allow anyone to take it.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

The broken weapon itself was monstrous enough but despite being dead, its master still didn’t permit anyone else to get the weapon. This made it impossible for Niu Fen to succeed.

Of course, Li Qiye had taken it away and refined it into Ebon Scythe, leaving it at Duality Academy.

“I heard Duck Egg got the broken gauntlet from Worldbreaker Fist, don’t know how he did it.” Niu Fen said.

“It’s because of his background and origin.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Background and origin… do you mean…” Niu Fen stared at him; his eyes flashed brightly.

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t say anything else.

“Duck Egg Dao Lord?” Qin Baifeng asked curiously: “Celestial Court managed to stop him, right?”

“Not quite, there is a place there that has to be crossed to truly destroy Celestial Court. Few can do so, hence the gongs of retreat.” Niu Fen said: “Everyone had no choice but to leave and then The Race started bragging about defeating the coalition. If it wasn’t for this issue, they would have made it to the three immortals.”

“It’s all one place, to go in there without ample preparation and information is suicidal, like moths surging toward the fire.” Li Qiye said.

“A true treasure indeed, lasting for an eternity.” Niu Fen commented: “Hehe, I know of another treasure, everyone calls it an immortal weapon but adding pseudo to it might be more correct.”

“What is it?” Baifeng asked.

“A sword.” Niu Fen said.
