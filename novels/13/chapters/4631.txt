Chapter 4632: Martial Competition

The news of the martial competition stirred up the crowd and excited the geniuses. Even those with no interest in the marriage alliance wanted to join.

For most great powers, only their successor was chosen to be a candidate, meaning saint childs or princes. Therefore, regular disciples weren’t involved at all. Sending an inadequate candidate would only risk derision and jeers.

This was no longer the case with the martial competition. Confident youths were allowed to fight without any limitation. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many of them. They might not be the last one standing but nonetheless, they were still eager to prove themselves.

It was simple - they just needed to display their brilliance and strength to make a name for themselves. It was rare to have a competition involving so many of their peers.

Because of this, more and more youths traveled to Golden Gate for the sake of fighting. A few were eager to fight members of the behemoth.

If they could have the privilege of fighting True Immortal Young Emperor Tian Feng, they just needed to last three to five moves. In the future, one of them might become a dao lord. Thus, they would then be considered survivors who have successfully challenged this great being. It would be a topic for them to brag about forever.

Meanwhile, a battle stage was erected on top of the main peak in Golden Gate. Mad Fist himself presided over the matter.

It didn’t take long before it was filled with eager combatants. As for the ancestors, they were disappointed to see Mad Fist instead of the emperor.

The youths didn’t care for this and looked around to assess the competitors.

“The saint child of Eight-direction is here too.” Someone said after seeing a radiant youth.

“That’s to be expected. Look over there, even an old prince from Fierce Sun Ravine is here.” Another saw a white-haired youth.

“Isn’t he from the last generation? Is he still eligible to fight?” A listener asked.

“It depends.” A genius responded: “He’s qualified given his age because he was sealed at a young age. He’s about the same age as us but not from this generation.”

“Where are the ones from True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao?” Someone curiously looked around.

“True Immortal Spirit is here right now, he’s strong enough to sweep through the crowd. As for Three Thousand Dao? I heard its current representative is Paramount Scion, I’m unsure of anyone else.” A knowledgeable cultivator responded.

“Hmm, Paramount Scion is strong, Jadedragon Monarch can’t be weaker. Nonetheless, True Immortal Spirit seems to have the advantage if no one else is here.” A last-gen cultivator analyzed.

“It should be interesting if those three don’t hold back.” Another agreed.

Jadedragon Monarch, Paramount Scion, and True Immortal Spirit were top geniuses only second to the five conquerors.

“True Immortal might not win if they don’t mobilize more geniuses.” A youth said.

“Well, if the ones here aren’t enough, maybe even the five conquerors will show up eventually.” A listener boldly speculated.

This made the crowd exchange glances and become emotional. Just the three mentioned prior were intimidating enough.

What about the five conquerors? No one would be able to compete against them on the battle stage.

“It doesn’t have to be the five conquerors. True Immortal has the Six Prodigies, not just True Immortal Young Emperor.” One expert mused.

“It’s about the same for Three Thousand Dao. Their current First Brother can dominate this competition.” An elder from a great power said.

“I hope the five conquerors will show up. They never get to fight each other so maybe we will see them in action. Watching a fight between them will benefit us for a lifetime.” One genius said with anticipation.

This was indeed the case. The five conquerors were rarely in the same place since they were busy with cultivation. Fighting here might be great practice before the actual dao lord competition.

***

When Mad Fist showed up along with the other big shots from Golden Gate, mighty fist energies engulfed the area.

Despite being in the presence of numerous great powers, he had enough prestige to be shown respect by the ancestors.

“I appreciate everyone for coming despite the long journey. Today, we hope to find a suitable groom for our jewel through a martial competition. The winner will be happily married on top of gaining another prize.”

“Another prize?” An ancestor asked right away.

The big shots immediately thought about the treasure obtained by the fist emperor - their true goal for being here.

“It will be known to the victor.” Mad Fist said mysteriously.

Some big shots didn’t like the non-answer but they didn’t protest because the veil of pretension was still there.

“The rules are simple, any young cultivator can participate regardless of their background and sect. The final winner will become our beloved jewel’s groom.” Mad Fist announced.

The big shots exchanged glances. These rules were just as expected. It meant that the stronger sects had a bigger advantage. For example, they could send several geniuses to fatigue a stronger combatant.
