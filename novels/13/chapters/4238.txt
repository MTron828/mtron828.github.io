Chapter 4239: The Nine Paths of Finality

This comment left people pondering in silence. They didn’t respond but the answer was obvious.

Not to mention a Heavenly Sovereign, even regular ancestors wouldn’t care about an ordinary disciple’s feelings. This was doubly true for characters like Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra. Cultivators in the world were nothing more than ants in their eyes.

“Can it be? Li Qiye is far stronger than the two masters?” An expert said with skepticism when comparing the overlords to Li Qiye. It would be something quite unbelievable for Li Qiye to be stronger.

“Just wait and see.” A big shot shook his head.

These big shots and ancestors weren’t sure about this matter. They had no idea about the true extent of Li Qiye’s power.

During Vastsea and Earthraiser’s hesitation, Li Qiye ignored them and took out his heavenly scripture, shouting: “Recall!”

“Buzz.” The scripture in his hand exuded a special runic light. A new world seemed to be opening within this radiance.

It contained boundless possibilities and mysteries. A top genius entering this world would feel themselves being immersed in an endless ocean brimming with lifeforce. There were no shores in sight, meaning that a lifetime wasn’t enough to learn everything here.

The power of the grand dao permeated across the land. The myriad dao under the heaven gathered in this place and released their power.

All weapons resonated loudly with clanks and hums, wanting to fly out of their container. Thus, the frightened owners hurriedly grabbed them.

“What is that?” Many were scared out of their mind while experiencing this incredible phenomenon.

Space started trembling as well. The scripture began absorbing the spatial fabrics around it and turned them into lines.

Next came the runes from the boulders prior in the form of a torrent. Initially, Myriad Era was pinned on top of it with flames serving as protection.

This was a sight to behold. How could that boulder, albeit relatively large, contain so many runes?

Nonetheless, the scripture had the suction force of a great whale. It didn’t take long before it finished absorbing the runes.

“Crack!” Cracks appeared on the depleted boulder. The thing then collapsed into tiny pieces, no longer as special as before.

This astounded the spectators, even Li Qiye’s enemies. They had tried everything before - the runes and flames of that boulder were unbeatable and left them helpless. Now, Li Qiye has taken this power for himself.

The man appeared quite satisfied as he stared at his heavenly scripture.

“Do you know what that is?” All eyes were on the scripture. Though they didn’t know what it was, even a fool understood its heaven-defying nature.

The older big shots became emotional since bold guesses popped up in their mind. The two overlords couldn’t restrain their excitement. Greedy glints flashed in their eyes.

“Fellow Daoist, th-the item in your hand looks familiar.” The vajra tried to squeeze out more information.

“Familiar? I don’t think so. Not to mention you but your seniors and dao lords might not have seen it before.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“There is a legend.” The venerable gazed intensely at the scripture: “One regarding the nine Heavenly Scriptures. They aren’t formless like the dao but rather, have the physical appearance of scrolls.”

“The heavenly scriptures?” Others gasped after hearing this.

“I believe the scroll you’re holding resembles a legendary heavenly scripture.” The vajra got to the point.

Li Qiye smiled and answered: “I need to give you two more credits. Yes, you are correct, it is a heavenly scripture. Ever heard of the nine paths of Finality?”

Li Qiye spoke so casually yet this revelation struck the crowd like thunder. They felt their world spinning as a result.

“This is Finality Scripture…” The venerable gasped despite having mentally prepared himself prior.

“The heavenly scriptures are real… Finality Sword is before us…” The vajra trembled repeatedly.

A clamor erupted among the crowd. Even the big shots stammered due to shock.

“Is-is this actually happening?” It was hard for people to digest this information.

The nine Heavenly Scriptures were familiar yet not for the crowd. This was especially true for the one named Finality Sword in this continent.

It was often brought up and currently, several powers possessed its swords and dao. Nonetheless, the scripture itself was elusive and unknown.

Where did it come from? Where was it now? Not even the dao lords had an answer for this.

“Don’t the heavenly sword dao originate from this scripture? That means the dao lords with one had seen it before.” One expert said.

The crowd remained silent because no dao lords have claimed witness to this scripture before. No sect had possessed it in history either. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Well, if they never saw it, how did they get their sword dao?” Another asked.

This question couldn’t be answered either because the dao lords were reticent about this matter.
