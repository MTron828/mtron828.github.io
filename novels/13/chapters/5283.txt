Chapter 5284: Not That Impressive

The dark swordsman and Li Zhitian fixed gazes. The latter’s opening move had no flaws to speak of, capable of stopping any offense in existence.

“Clank!” The swordsman unsheathed his sword, revealing a blade as thin as an iron sheet. A sword from the mortal world might be thicker.

However, a mortal couldn’t use something so murderous. The intensity came from the initial thought of murder, far before the lifting of the blade.

This split moment stretched infinitely after coming into contact with Li Zhitian’s grand dao - the thrust pierced through countless eras and worlds.

Unfortunately, Zhitian had underestimated the murderous potential of the thrust. After piercing through numerous obstructions, the thinnest sword intent could still kill anything.

“Pluff!” His eyes became wide open after his throat was pierced, rendering him unable to scream.

He clearly saw his domain stopping the thrust, diluting it down to nothingness. Alas, it wasn’t enough.

“Splash!” Blood gushed out of his neck like a spring during his backward fall.

He didn’t hit the ground because Li Qiye came over to support him, infusing him with primordial light directly at the wound. Its mysteries recovered his vitality and life, pulling him back from the brink of death.

“Thank you, Young Noble.” He sat down on the ground and spoke feebly.

“My turn.” The frightening result didn’t deter the old servant.

He assumed the simple defensive stance again. His movement wasn’t swift either, akin to an old man too weak to raise his hands.

Nonetheless, the moment he finished the stance, he became the center of the cosmo. Anything coming close would be subjected to the heaviest pressure - a perfect defense accounting for all directions.

He suddenly became a guardian, no longer the old man with droopy eyes. Who would call him a servant now? He was clearly an apex conqueror.

In spite of this, the swordsman’s expression didn’t change outside of a faint glimmer. His eyes remained cold as if he wasn’t staring at living beings. All were already dead to his blade.

“Clank!” Another thrust began with the initial thought. The physical act of drawing the blade no longer mattered for a swordsman of this level.

Either way, the old servant was prepared for any type of attack - physical or incorporeal.

“Bam!” The dreadful attack was immediately subjected to immense weight, unable to push through with its momentum.

This gave the old man enough time to slam his palms together to catch the blade. This had enough force to unite heaven and earth while being gathered at a single point.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Clank!” The weakened thrust still made it through the defense and pierced the old man’s chest. However, this was merely a flesh wound and the blade stopped.

“You may pass.” The swordsman pulled back and sheathed the sword again.

“Nice!” Li Zhitian cheered loudly after seeing the successful stop.

“Just got lucky.” The old servant said before returning to stand behind Li Qiye.

“Not that impressive.” Li Qiye commented.

“Release me and I will show you another.” The swordsman uttered coldly.

“You still won’t be able to kill me after being released.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Don’t be so sure.” The swordsman responded.

“You are overly confident in using killing as a way to prove your dao. A slanted sword cannot slay me.” Li Qiye elaborated.

The swordsman stared at Li Qiye despite not having eyes. He had no anger, only indifference.

“Without realizing this, your dao will never be complete.” Li Qiye continued.

“The sword must kill, this is the dao.” He argued.

“Your blind trust is pitiful, causing you to fall to your own inner demon. You didn’t become invincible after killing your wife in the nine worlds so you tried again in the thirteen worlds, still didn’t become invincible. You are stuck in a self-inflicted cycle, your sword follows the path but your heart is possessed by demons, how can you ever comprehend the ultimate profundity of this dao?” Li Qiye said.

“I see it already, the dao is complete when everything is dead.” He said.

“Fine, we’ll see which of us will be doing the killing.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand: “Come, one decisive move. If you lose, you will not use the sword again.”

“Very well.” The swordsman suddenly erupted with murderous intent, finally resorting to wielding his true power by becoming one with the peak.

Li Qiye stood casually and didn’t bother putting on any defense; his hands hanging down naturally.

The swordsman actually tried to scan his opponent this time but the guy resembled a mortal full of openings.

After a short while, he decided to perform an ultimate slash capable of piercing dao fruits and true fates.

This sword could deliver anyone to death’s door with no possibility of a return trip.
