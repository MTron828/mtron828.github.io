Chapter 4174: Sword Grave

Sword Grave’s position was third among the five domains. Nonetheless, it was already quite perilous.

The river and the abyss were relatively safe. This was especially true for the latter since one just needed to not be suicidal.

As for the river, refraining from risky endeavors made it safe as well. This didn’t apply to Sword Grave.

The moment cultivators set foot inside, their fate was no longer their own. It was meant as a cemetery for swords.

No one knew who buried these divine swords here. One rumor said that the swords themselves came buried themselves once abandoned by their master.

The graves had varying levels of conspicuousness. Some were obvious; others might not be spotted despite people standing next to them.

Of course, a few were rather notorious due to the plethora of historical texts regarding their danger. These were known as ominous graves.

Each grave should have at least one divine sword beneath. However, one needed to find them on top of being powerful enough to take the divine sword out.

The grave could be a pit or a marsh, even a rock or an old root could serve as a grave. All in all, they were everywhere. A visitor would find one eventually with enough patience or vision.

Li Qiye and Snowcloud Princess stood outside and observed the area. The place had grand geographic features. Unfortunately, there was a lack of life and vegetation due to an abundance of death energy. It gave the impression of being the end of the road for visitors.

It included majestic peaks, deep valleys and caves, floating boulders… The death energy didn’t overwhelm the various sword energies either.

However, the sword energies here were different and didn’t rampage chaotically. Nonetheless, it was still uncomfortable and oppressive.

Ultimately, regardless of how deep the divine swords were buried, they were still mighty and their auras couldn’t be completely hidden.

One particular peak would seize everyone’s attention because it was the highest. While in this area, visitors could always see it by just looking up.

It resembled a massive sword pinned to the ground and possessed wondrous divinity. This could be the patriarch of all swords. It could stay in this pose for epochs to come on top of receiving the worship of all divine swords.

Thus, visitors would absolutely assume that it was a grave containing the strongest divine sword.

“That’s the number one sword grave. There’s a high chance that the immortal sword is buried under there.” Snowcloud Princess told Li Qiye.

“Let’s assume that’s the case, it’s not easy getting it.” Li Qiye stared at the peak and smiled.

“Yes.” The princess agreed: “There is a top ten list for the graves here and it is in the first place. Numerous experts including dao lords have tried only to fail.”

“We’re going in.” Li Qiye chuckled and entered with the princess right behind him.

Meanwhile, others shared a similar conversation.

“Is the immortal sword really there?” One expert asked while staring at the tallest peak.

“That I do not know, what I know is how impossible it is. Space Dragon Emperor, Sword Sea Dao Lord, Sword Queen, War God Dao Lord, Jade Bamboo Dao Lord, they all have tried before.”

“There are plenty of graves here, others in the top ten have been cracked but no this one.” A high elder added.

“So no one has been able to open it before?” A youth asked.

“We weren’t clear enough?” The ancestor gave him the side-eye.

“I absolutely got this!” The youth remained stubborn.

“Got this my ass!” His senior smacked the back of his head and scolded: “You wouldn’t be able to get close, let alone open it. The sword energies there would reduce you to blood.”

“You’re thinking too highly of him.” A different senior shook her head: “Given his meager cultivation, he would drop to his knees while being one thousand miles away. In fact, he should be thanking heaven for still being alive at that distance.”

“Is it really that bad?” The youth became frightened.

“Do you think it’s notorious for no reason? And all those invincible characters merely messed around? They couldn’t open it and yet you consider yourself qualified to try?” The first senior glared at him.

The youth looked like a deflated balloon and no longer dared to speak.

“Don’t think about the first grave. Only Sea Emperor has the ability to try.” A king nearby interjected.

“It’s better to not even try any of those ten graves if people want to survive a little longer. The minor ones will do.” The senior responded.

“Sigh, it’s a shame I wasn’t born during Jade Bamboo Dao Lord’s era. The dao lord planted a branch here and got the rest of the world three thousand years of opportunities.” An expert said wistfully.

Jade Bamboo Dao Lord was from Wooden Sword. Their patriarch died in battle here and for millions of years, no one from this sect could come to take back his corpse.

The dao lord finally picked up the patriarch’s corpse later on and left behind a branch in Sword Grave. It became far easier and safer for visitors to obtain divine swords.

Unfortunately, the branch only lasted three thousand years before being destroyed.

“No need to think so much, just worry about staying alive. Run right away at the first sign of trouble.” An ancestor told his fellow disciples.

He knew that not everyone who entered would be able to come back out.

Sure enough, screams could be heard right away near the entrance. Dozens of victims fell to the ground with blood gushing down from their forehead. Something killed them in the blink of an eye.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Run!” A cowardly cultivator nearby ran out of the cemetery right away.

Snowcloud Princess followed Li Qiye inside. It didn’t take long before she felt danger. Something was shooting for her forehead so she wanted to dodge. However, Li Qiye reacted even faster.
