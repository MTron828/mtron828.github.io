Chapter 5123: A Meal

Li Qiye spent his time in the courtyard relaxing since the departure date drew near. Nothing was more comforting than the warm sun.

Demoness kneeled near him, serving him tea and fruits. She wore a black dress that was as thin as a cicada’s wing. The barely visible curves were full of temptation, making it hard for people to not take another glance.

“You are definitely the best at recognizing the situation in Eight-stallion Dynasty.” He said.

“Serving you is an honor, Young Noble.” Her soft and tender voice made people feel a little fuzzy inside.

In reality, Li Qiye didn’t ask for anyone to serve him. She came of her own volition.

“How will you serve me?” Li Qiye closed his eyes and joked.

“I am willing to be your ox and horse.” She responded.

“Did Eight-stallion Dao Lord know about your true cultivation?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“We had an agreement and my cultivation doesn’t matter. I simply didn’t reveal it.” She said.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Sure thing.” He smiled.

“The same can’t be said for your impeccable insight, Young Noble. You noticed after the first glance.” She said.

“You’re rather interesting, the inheritor of several imperial lineages yet still rather flexible in conduct. Many can’t do the same.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s a tough world out there, I’m not the only one looking for a meal.” She winked charmingly at him.

Unfortunately, this didn’t work on Li Qiye.

“Don’t make it sound so pitiful.” He said: “If you can’t find a meal with the treasures on your ship, the rest of the lower continents are facing a real famine then. Don’t worry, I’m not interested in those treasures.”

“If you desire it, Young Noble, all of Ceaseless can be yours.” She knew what to say to please people.

“You’re smart, aware that I can take whatever I want but now, I would seem like a jerk for doing so.” He said.

“It is an honor to be of service, Young Noble.” She repeated.

“Forget it, don’t try to be seductive because I already appreciate your craftiness and propriety.” He said.

“I am elated to be praised by you.” She said excitedly.

“Sigh, a dragon lord should act properly or people will spurn you.” He said.

“Doesn’t matter to me for I have been praised by you.” She responded.

“Let’s get to the point. I have given out many fortunes here but you didn’t get one. Tell me, I will grant you a fortune.” He waved his hand.

Although she lacked loyalty compared to the others, he appreciated her vision and awareness.

“I wish to stay by your side, Young Noble, is that possible?” She asked eagerly.

“No wonder why those geezers are willing to let you be in charge of Ceaseless, you can indeed shoulder the responsibility.” He smiled at her.

“I am merely speaking from the heart. Staying by your side is the best possible outcome.” She said.

“Yes, it is a supreme fortune. One that can spare you from all disasters.” He nodded.

“Will you take me in, Young Noble?” She winked again.

“Will you be able to leave Ceaseless?” He answered with a question.

“I can let go of everything if I get to be by your side.” She paused for a moment before responding.

“You are someone who can achieve great things.” He couldn’t help but praise.

“You don’t need an idiot and I will try my best to not be one.” She said.

“Yes, and that’s rather hard to find recently.” Li Qiye nodded and thought about it.

After a short moment, he said: “You should still stay here since this world needs you. When the old geezers left behind Ceaseless, they had something in mind. You know this too.”

“I shall follow your order.” She said submissively, looking rather pitiful.

“Okay, don’t be so sad.” He said: “I will bless your Ceaseless.”

She immediately got on the ground and bowed after hearing this: “We will never forget your kindness, Young Noble.” This was her goal in the first place.

“They’ve gone to great lengths to prepare for a calamity.” He said.

“Is it possible to escape, Young Noble?” She looked up and asked.

“Depends on the scale. That’s why Ceaseless needs someone like you to lead it.” He said.

“I understand, it’s just that I wanted to see explore beyond the limits of this world.” She said.

“Then let us see what you can do in the future. Alas, everyone has a limit, it depends on your own effort.” He said.

“Yes.” She understood that following him was impossible.

“What should I do when another calamity comes?” She then asked.

“There is no perfect solution under such dire circumstances. A minor one can be dealt with Ceaseless but as for a serious one? Just run as far away as possible.” He guided.

“Will you come back, Young Noble?” She asked.

“I am heading to the final battle.” Li Qiye said.

“Sometimes, I imagine the places that can be reached with the dao. I feel powerless that I cannot help you on your journey.” She sighed and said.

“Some accept their fate, others don’t.” He elaborated: “If you do, then you’ll be able to live and die at home, that’s not a bad ending. If you do not accept, then prepare for the worst, a death without a burial, far, far away from home.”

“I understand.” She bowed again before staring at him.

“I don’t have flowers on my face.” He smiled.

“Young Noble, what do you think is the hardest thing in the world?” She asked.

“You have an answer?” He responded.

“To see someone away.” She said: “Although our relationship is shallow and short, you are a unique existence in this world, a shimmer of light flashing ephemerally in my life. I won’t be able to see you again after this, the world will no longer see your light.”

“Mmm, it’s even harder being the one leaving.” Li Qiye stared at the horizon and said.

“That’s you, Young Noble.” She murmured.

“Right, you will, at least, still be staying near home.” He said.

“You won’t since you will not stop.” She understood.

“You’re smart, I would have taken you with me in the past.” He smiled.

“It’s not too late to accept me now.” She said.

“Times have changed, I must go alone this time.” He shook his head.

“Sounds rather lonely.” She said softly.

“People didn’t lie when they talked about the loneliness of the dao.” He calmly said: “You who must pretend to be holy and superior, it’s rather cold at the top too. Everyone else are mere ants in comparison, would you feel lonely then?"

She took her time thinking before answering: “That’s why people can’t leave home.”

“It’s difficult and requires resolution, forging a path forward unceasingly until you are the only one left. Any wavering can result in compromises.” He said.

“This is why some can’t make it and fall into the darkness.” She understood.
