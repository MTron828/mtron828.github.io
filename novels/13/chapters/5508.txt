Chapter 5509: Take A Look

“A visitor?” Mu Shaoyun saw Li Qiye and knew that he was an outsider.

“Fellow Daoist, where are you from?” He came over and bowed slightly.

“I’m just passing by.” Li Qiye smiled.

“May I ask who invited you?” Shaoyun found this rather odd.

“No one.” Li Qiye took another sip of tea.

Curiosity turned into confusion because no one could enter their sect without an invitation. Listeners nearby quietly discussed this matter as well.

Why was an uninvited outsider present, especially when the grand ceremony drew near?

Shaoyun contemplated and thought that the ancestors along with his juniors sisters wouldn’t let this go unnoticed.

Nonetheless, since Li Qiye didn’t want to speak, he couldn’t press the issue.

“Fellow Daoist, we apologize for the lack of reception since everyone is busy with the grand ceremony.” He said despite being skeptical.

Skepticism was the biggest difference between him and Sunset Glow Goddess. The former was an outer disciple who had traveled extensively. His heart carried prejudice and doubt since he had seen the world.

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye smiled and ate a piece of snack.

Shaoyun was a little peeved by Li Qiye’s indifferent demeanor. The guy was acting as if this was his home - the others were mere guests.

This was a rather bizarre feeling but Shaoyun dropped the issue.

“First Brother, are you attempting again?” A disciple asked him.

“Yes, a revisit to gain new insight into the scripture.” Shaoyun laughed and had ample confidence in his ability.

After all, he was powerful with four sacred fruits - this was relatively amazing in not just Sunset Glow but the entire continent. He was certainly worthy of the character, “genius”.

“You have such a good grasp on it already and can manifest chapters at will.” Another disciple shared the same sentiment.

“No way, my attainment is still limited.” Shaoyun sat down and began meditating.

Sure enough, the grand dao harmonized with him. Dao laws and runes appeared along with mystical hymns.

“Incredible, that’s why he’s in third place.” Others gathered and talked about his swift comprehension.

“Only someone like First Brother is worthy of our goddess.” Another said.

“Right, if the goddess wishes to pick a consort, it has to be him.” They started gossiping about this matter.

Everyone knew that he had a crush on Sunset Glow Goddess. This was indeed a good match.

However, someone else came into the manor and silenced the crowd. Many bowed in her direction.

“Senior Sister Qin.” Their expression became serious and dignified.

Unlike Mu Shaoyun, Qin Baifeng actually had authority in the sect, capable of delivering judgment and punishments.

Moreover, she wasn’t as lax as Sunset Glow Goddess so many were afraid of her.

“Junior Sister, you’re out too? It’s been a while, let’s have a drink?” Shaoyun stopped meditating and stood up to greet her.

“You’re back, Senior Brother.” Baifeng nodded in return and said. Her eyes then fell upon Li Qiye who was relaxing inside the pavilion.

He poured his own drink and merely observed the painting on the wall.

She started walking over in his direction while everyone else gossiped again.

“Do you know him, Junior Sister?” Shaoyun thought that she might have been the one who invited Li Qiye.

Few in the sect had the authority to invite outsiders; she was one of them. Moreover, since she was from an external clan, she most likely had acquaintances from the outside world.

Alas, she didn’t answer his question, leaving him with a wry smile. This was her style - never giving anyone face or expressing clear emotions. Only the goddess could occasionally make her smile.

“Young Noble, you’re taking a look at the dao here?” She sat near him and asked, further fanning the flames of gossip.

Everyone thought that their cold senior sister might actually have a boyfriend.

“Indeed.” He smiled and only poured his own cup.

She didn’t care for tea or snacks, only curious about his goal. She glanced at the wall and asked: “What do you think about it?”

“Trying to figure out some clues?” He smiled.

“No, I’m just curious about what you think since you’re a first-time visitor.” She said.

“Wow, Junior Sister, since when do you pay this much attention to someone else?” A cloud landed from the sky and a pleasant voice could be heard.

“Senior Sister!” Her appearance excited the crowd.

Sunset Glow Goddess had a better reputation than Qin Baifeng due to her amicable and outgoing nature. She resembled a kind neighbor, not an imperious core disciple.

If they had to pick, they would prefer her over Qin Baifeng despite the two being evenly matched in terms of ability.

Mu Shaoyun’s eyes lit up after seeing her, not hiding his affection in the slightest.

“Long time no see, Junior Sister, how I’ve missed you. You are even more brilliant than before.” He rushed over and greeted her.

“Welcome back, Senior Brother.” She smiled at him before entering the pavilion and sitting down next to Li Qiye as well.

“Young Noble, I’m sure you’re not only here to sightsee.” She winked at Li Qiye.

Shaoyun’s expression soured after seeing this.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
