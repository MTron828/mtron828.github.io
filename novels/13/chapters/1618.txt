Li Qiye answered flatly: “What’s impossible for others can’t restrict me. Don’t forget, I am the Dark Crow, Li Qiye. That’s why it’s in my possession, as simple as that!”

The fowl fell into a long silence. Despite its unwillingness to believe, the truth was right there.

After a long time, it calmed down and said: “Crow, you should know that this is one of a kind. If it ceases to exist, so does the world!”

“I know, that’s why using it to kill the emperors and gods is very wasteful. Only the final battle is worth it. Of course, I won’t be using it unless there is no other choice. I took it out only to send a message.” Li Qiye said.

“If I can take out this thing, is there something else in this world that I can’t get? You think I’m just boasting and posturing? You think I can only bring emperors to battle? To be frank, there is no emperor backing me up right now but if I want to flatten your mine, trust me, I will still do it regardless of how much resources are required! Once I make up my mind, there is nothing I can’t do. I even lived to return from the end of the world, do you think I’m still afraid of anyone? It’s all a trade off game for me. If I’m willing, I can take down anyone, regardless of how strong they are!”

The fowl had no response to this statement since he knew of the Dark Crow’s sheer determination and propensity for success. This was the reason why so many people feared him all this time!

In the eyes of the undyings, this crow was an unkillable cockroach. Even if he were to be defeated and destroyed, he would rear his ugly head again one day and sweep through his enemies! His dao heart was flawless, capable of withstanding all failures and defeats to start again.

He looked at the fowl and said: “So now, take a careful look at my ultimate item, do you think one hundred crystals are fine or not now?”

“Is this an extortion?” The fowl said with a tinge of helplessness.

“You can see it that way. No matter what, my final battle will let you have a glimmer of victory, allowing you to rest.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“But if you lose, darkness will encompass everything! Or the world will no longer exist!” The fowl scowled.

To which Li Qiye responded: “So what? You have never seen the sun ever since you’ve started hiding here. Does it really matter if the darkness captures you? At worst, it’ll only be a bit more troublesome than now. But after the darkness, waiting for a new prosperity, maybe your mine will have a great harvest. That’s why you should be praying for my victory to see dawn again. Wouldn’t that be nice?”

“No one has ever been successful before.” The fowl became weaker in tone: “In each eon, so many have tried but what was the final result? I don’t need to say more about their miserable outcomes.”

“Then wait and see. I know you can live till that day when I will either be dead or successful. Congratulation, you might be able to witness an unprecedented miracle.” He said leisurely.

The fowl took its time before taking a deep breath and looking up at Li Qiye. It solemnly said: “Crow, I can agree to this request but I alone can’t decide this. I need to talk to the others.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“I know you can since you have always been so persuasive in telling them to invest in me with previous transactions. I’m sure it won’t be a problem this time and shall wait for your goods news.”

The fowl grunted and disappeared into the endless cave.

In fact, they didn’t actually have a choice. It was either giving him one hundred crystals or war. In the past, they probably had some confidence in fighting against the crow or at least defend their cave successfully.

But this was no longer the case. The moment it saw the ultimate item, it knew that the initiative was in the crow’s hand, not them.

The crow was right as well. If he could obtain this ultimate item, was there anything else beyond his grasp? They simply couldn’t imagine the type of resources and methods he still had up his sleeves.

As moments passed, the bottomless cave was still silent. Li Qiye quietly waited with patience. In fact, he was completely confident or he wouldn’t have been asking for one hundred crystals.

After a long time, the fowl appeared again with an extremely ancient chest. It stared at Li Qiye and said: “Crow, you win. We agree to give you one hundred immortal crystals.”

Li Qiye wasn’t surprised at all, evident by his smile: “You have always been so amazing at being in charge with great insight. Few can be your match in the cave.”

“Hmph, crow, no need to flatter me. This is an exception, one time only. We hope to not see you again for ten generations.” The fowl unhappily said.

Though Li Qiye didn’t show mercy this time to the chagrin of the nest, they still conceded with this compromise and chose to work with him again.

“So you all still want to work with me? The old agreement is still in effect?” Li Qiye laughed and said.

“Don’t forget, you still owe us crystals from before!” The fowl said with a stern expression.

“I haven’t forgotten but don’t you forget either, the peace that you’re enjoying now is thanks to me. I might owe you some crystals but you haven’t paid this time of peace back to me, so we’re even.”

The fowl chose not to answer. This was the reason why they worked together with the Dark Crow. Others couldn’t offer a time of peace, not even all-powerful Immortal Emperors. This was something only the Dark Crow could do!

“The crystals are yours now. I hope you can always sweep through all of your enemies.” The somber fowl slowly pushed the chest towards Li Qiye.

Li Qiye reached out to pick it up but the fowl suddenly pulled back and stared at him.

“What? I know that you’re not regretting the decision.” Li Qiye wasn’t anxious at all.

“Damned crow, you promised me about finding those guys back then. You still haven’t fulfilled this obligation!” The fowl stared at him and said.

“Pheasant, what kind of news do you want to hear?” A smile appeared on Li Qiye’s face.

The fowl didn’t respond despite slightly opening its mouth.

“I’ll speak for you then.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Pheasant, what do you do outside of sitting here and guard? Let me make a wild guess. Even a tiger might let its guard down at times, but not you. How could the guys have actually run away under your watch? I don’t think that’s possible.”

The fowl answered coldly: “I just want to hear some news.”

“Okay, I’ll tell you two things.” Li Qiye said: “First, they have changed. Even if the villainous heavens have eyes, it still wouldn’t be able to recognize them. Secondly, they are still alive. That’s all.”

The fowl gently sighed and didn’t comment after a brief silence.
