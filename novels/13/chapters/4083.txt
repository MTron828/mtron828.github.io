Chapter 4084: Sky Spirit Starshooter

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The demon king’s setback caught everyone by surprise. It became obvious that Li Qiye had a considerable home-court advantage despite top formation masters being unable to see through the mysteries of the plain.

He seemed capable of defeating Heavenly Sovereigns while staying at the plain.

“The stage is going to get bigger.” An older expert commented.

Both Armament Mountain and Starshooter Kingdom couldn’t concede to Li Qiye. However, he seemed capable enough to stand up for himself. Thus, a fierce battle was inevitable.

“Yes, this show will be brilliant.” Many couldn’t wait to watch.

Some ancestors would prefer a bloodbath so that these two powers would be weakened. They would have more chances for the formation and the treasury in that case.

“Buzz…” Millions of arrows suddenly appeared on the horizon, looking just like meteors.

“What the hell?!” Many spectators ran away, not wanting to be turned into beehives. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The river of arrows left behind long trails, looking like multi-colored rays. It was actually quite beautiful to watch if people weren’t too busy running away.

Once they were pinned on the ground, their light became denser. This culminated in a loud explosion. Once the light dispersed, people saw a bridge connecting the plain to another area.

“That’s in the direction of Starshooter.” An ancestor gazed at the other end of the bridge and saw Starshooter Kingdom.

“Their legion is coming.” Another expert had an easy prediction.

“Boom!” Sure enough, loud rumbles and bright lights came from the other side just like the opening of a treasury.

Of course, this was not the case. A great legion was crossing the bridge in order to arrive at the plain in a short time.

It consisted of a hundred thousand troops or so. Each wore resplendent armors that illuminate the sky above. Most importantly, this upper radiance gathered together to form two defensive wings.

It seemed as if while under their protection, the legion could handle any offense and defeat any enemy.

“Sky Spirit Legion, the royal troops of the kingdom. It’s their strongest.” One cultivator was surprised.

The progenitor of this kingdom was Starshooter Dao Lord who had a sky spirit bloodline. Thus, some descendants in this kingdom also shared this bloodline to a certain extent.

This legion specifically picked members with this bloodline. Not all of them were from the royal branches but still had some connections.

Bright spectacles accompanied this legion, making it seem like they came from above. Others couldn’t help wanting to prostrate.

“Creak.” An ancient chariot could be seen. It was embedded with treasures and dao protections, looking impressive in both defense and offense.

On top of the chariot was an old man sitting in the meditating pose. He wore a dragon robe and an imperial crest.

A bow was placed above his knees. Its aura could surpass the nine firmaments; it possessed enough force to pull the power of the world. The master of this bow should be able to slaughter all of his foes.

“Starshooter King!” Many recognized him right away: “And that’s Sky Spirit Starshooter, a dao lord bow.”

This bow was one of the defining treasures of their kingdom. Though Starshooter Dao Lord was also a sword user, this didn’t lessen his versatility. For example, this bow was also a top weapon of his.

“Both the legion and the bow? The kingdom isn’t playing around, this is almost all of their elites.” An expert murmured.

The king himself led their top legion to battle. He seemed hellbent on taking down Li Qiye.

“Father!” Starshooter Prince shouted with joy after seeing his father. At the very least, his father didn’t abandon him.

The king and the legion stopped outside the plain and saw the current state of the hostages.

This was a public humiliation - a disgrace to their kingdom. These elites could only wash it away with Li Qiye’s blood.

Spectators were smart enough to move to the best spots for observing while maintaining safety. They also needed to be close enough to take advantage of the situation.

“Who will win?” Someone asked.

“Hard to say, Li Qiye has no chance alone but we don’t know how strong this grand formation is.” An old cultivator replied.

This grand formation was unknown to the world so it was tough to evaluate this battle.

“Do you know the consequence of insulting our people?” The king glared at Li Qiye.

“No idea.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

“Death.” To which the king responded.

“Wow, come then, all of you, I’m itching for a warm-up.” Li Qiye smiled.

The crowd exchanged glances, wondering about the source of Li Qiye’s confidence.

The king glared at him; the atmosphere became awfully tense.

Suddenly, the former’s expression relaxed and became friendly. He said: “Youths are always impetuous and headstrong, this is inevitable. If you let them go, I’ll drop everything else.”

His sudden shift in attitude caught everyone off guard.
