Chapter 5224: Such Talent In The Mortal World?

A twelve-fruit dragon lord was as helpless as a child before the eighteen images.

“I can’t believe it.” Xiao Qingtian murmured; Ye Fantian was just as surprised.

“Ahh!” However, Sanctified Bones was still alive. His twelve fruits exerted all of their power, just enough to hold on. Alas, the tempests forming from their maximum potential couldn’t push the images away.

“Even twelve sacred fruits can’t do anything.” Spectators felt a little hopeless and weak while watching this.

They felt as if Li Qiye was a giant playing with an insect, drowning other dragon lords in despair.

“Twelve fruits…” Xiao Qingtian had a wry smile while feeling a chill coursing down his spine.

Sanctified Bones was just as strong as him now but was still being crushed like an insect. The same would have happened to him.

“I will bring you and Imperial Gate down with me!” Sanctified Bones realized the futility of struggling.

Cracks appeared on his twelve fruits and a monstrous power seeped out.

“Shit!” Cultivators shouted and wanted to run.

“Boom!” The twelve fruits exploded, releasing incredible destruction.

“He’s self-destructing!” Everyone thought that it was too late to run, not expecting Sanctified Bones to be so extreme and decisive. This was enough to obliterate Imperial Gate and deal serious damage to the city.

“It’s over!” Some closed their eyes before the blinding blast, accepting their fate.

However, Li Qiye didn’t allow this to happen. He closed his palm and changed the fundamental forms of the images. They became swollen and puffed out like bubbles as the explosive waves pulsed outward, absorbing the blow.

Some of the images popped from the sheer devastation despite being flexible. Nonetheless, they returned again in the same moldable form.

The dao source, controlled by Li Qiye, empowered this regenerative cycle in order to contain the explosion. The images changed continuously in order to keep up with his dao derivation.

“What is going on?!” Powerful cultivators paid attention to this phenomenon and turned their sight toward Imperial Gate.

“This is…?” Suppression Conqueror became alarmed and activated his heavenly gaze.

“Rumble!” Those in Imperial Gate were blinded by the containment; their ears assaulted by deafening blasts.

Once the light dissipated, they witnessed a monumental change - only thirteen images were left.

Nonetheless, powerful dragon lords could tell that despite losing five, the images seemed more profound than before. This was a type of return to simplicity and the source of the dao. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Only thirteen are left now.” Weaker cultivators talked among themselves.

“Just as he said before.” Ye Fantian took a deep breath.

“How did he do it?” Xiao Qingtian opened his eyes wide, talented enough to see the discrete improvements.

“Who is he…?” He murmured in a daze, unable to understand the method.

He clearly saw how Li Qiye used the eighteen images to contain the explosion, nothing after that due to the cacophony of blasts and lights.

Dao reduction wasn’t a new concept. It’s just that the eighteen images were too profound already. Reducing them into something simpler and more efficient required an extreme understanding of the grand dao.

He understood this on a conceptual level and could take thousands of years to perfect the method. However, actually performing the reduction was a different story.

“How can such a devilish talent exist in this world?” He questioned his own ability.

“A monster indeed.” Ye Fantian became emotional as well.
