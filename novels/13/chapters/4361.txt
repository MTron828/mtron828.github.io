Chapter 4362: Malice

They were tense because the saintess was from the Jian Clan of Phoenix Ground. They didn’t know what the other two branches thought about this matter.

Thus, if it wasn’t someone from the Jian, this feast might be anything but celebratory in nature. They instinctively touched their weapon regardless of how futile it would be.

“The three branches are all but the same, we’re all members of Dragon.” The serpent demon put on a friendly appearance.

Elder Hu whispered to Li Qiye: “Sect Master, the monarch is from Dragon Platform.”

There was no doubt that the sect master of Dragon would try to avenge his son and the fallen members of Dragon.

Moreover, he was also from Dragon Platform, one of the three main branches. It looked like this welcoming party wasn’t so friendly after all.

The youths from Little Diamond gazed intensely at the demons and unsheathed their weapons. Of course, this was only met with disdain from the demons.

Though there were several dozens of them, they were weaker than any junior in Dragon. One demon here could crush them like ants.

They understood this as well but even a fish on a chopping board would try to resist, let alone humans.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Li Qiye, on the contrary, remained calm and smiled: “No wonder why there’s a welcoming party already.”

“It is our responsibility to take care of weary guests.” The serpent demon laughed amicably. Alas, when he opened his mouth, it made the youths tremble with fear since they felt like prey.

“We shouldn’t go.” Elder Hu found this situation to be unfavorable.

“You must, don’t let our hospitality go to waste.” The serpent demon insisted.

Elder Hu and the youths would want to try and flee right now. Alas, they needed to wait for Li Qiye’s order.

“Wow, looks like you all insist on taking care of us.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Indeed, we come with full sincerity.” The serpent demon chuckled. The rest of the demons in the back started laughing as well, trying to play the part of a good host.

Unfortunately, this only frightened the youths even more. They thought that they were sheep surrounded by tigers and serpents.

“Ca-can we not go?” One of them felt his knees buckling, not wanting to be eaten by the demons.

“Sect Master, let’s leave.” Another whispered to Li Qiye. Going with these demons was the same as entering the tiger’s lair.

“You insist on holding a party for us?” Li Qiye asked the demons with a smile.

Those who recognized this smile would instantly know what was in store for the demons. It’s just that the youths from Little Diamond have lost their composure and didn’t know Li Qiye that well.

“We brothers have put a lot of effort into this, please don’t let us down.” The serpent demon seemed to enjoy laughing and showing off his gaping mouth.

One youth thought that these demons would have no qualm in killing them. After all, this was a desolate area and no one would know or care. They didn’t find escaping humiliating either since they were from a small sect and their opponents were mighty.

“You’re here already, no need to leave.” A different demon approached the group, seemingly wanting to surround them.

Li Qiye still stood there with a smile on his face while the rest panicked.

“Do-don’t come over here!” A youth couldn’t help but shout.

“Why so nervous? We bear no malice.” The serpent demon remained cordial but who knows what he was actually thinking.

“Serpent King, why is a great demon from Dragon Platform bullying a junior?” A calm voice interrupted in a forceful and penetrating manner.

Everyone turned around and saw another group of demons, one primarily consisting of bird demons - eagles, lightning birds…

The leader was a middle-aged man, handsome and well-dressed. One would think that he was a human if it wasn’t for his resplendently golden bird tail. He also had golden claws instead of human feet.
