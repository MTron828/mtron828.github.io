Why even bother trying to stop this unstoppable slash? Even the strongest cultivator would fall victim.

The slash could slay gods and emperors since it has reached a new plateau.

The spectators felt as if they were victims of the slash just like Li Qiye. During the entire process, their eyes widened in astonishment and helplessness.

They couldn’t move at all so resisting wasn’t possible. Plus, they didn’t have the courage to do so either. Waiting for death was the only option.

Dust and debris scattered downward. The ocean of lightning has been split into two, the same as Li Qiye.

Some saw Li Qiye being split into two. Others even saw Li Qiye’s two halves falling to the ground with sputtering blood.

The emperor pulled back his sword, ending the battle in a decisive manner. Nothing was left after the slash - not the ocean of lightning or the offensive bolts. Li Qiye no longer existed as well.

The world became silent; the spectators were intimidated by the slash and couldn’t calm down. Some felt a jolt of pain all over as if they have been slain as well by the emperor.

“I can’t believe it.” They eventually regained their sanity. A few dropped to the ground and became paralyzed while feeling powerless. Even the strongest Eternals present felt that way.

“That’s the power of a True Emperor. Never miss the chance to follow this path if possible.” One Eternal started reflecting.

Of course, the emperor didn’t fight alone. The other three assisted but he was the primary focus in delivering such a mighty blow. An Eternal was far inferior to a True Emperor and a progenitor.

“Li Qiye’s dead.” People looked around and only saw a clear sky.

“I think so.” They searched and searched yet couldn’t find him: “Only death awaits those who try to stop that slash.”

Since they saw him being dismembered by the slash, they believed that he has been killed.

“Fiercest couldn’t have stopped that combination attack, no one in Imperial can. It had the style of a progenitor just now.” An older expert added.

People glanced at each other and nodded in agreement. That slash earlier looked like one from a progenitor.

Perhaps only Solar Daoist, an Everlasting, would be able to handle such a terrifying move.

“Fiercest is finally dead.” People started to sigh after seeing the aftermath.

For some reason, many started feeling much better. Though they had no problems with Fiercest, his very existence exerted immense pressure on them due to his devilish nature. As long as he was alive, other geniuses and top beings would always be overshadowed by him.

They felt as if colors have returned to the world. There was no need to live under his shadow any longer.

“He courted death.” The ones annoyed by him celebrated and started mocking him: “That’s why one shouldn’t consider themselves to be unbeatable regardless of how strong they are. There is always a stronger man and a higher mountain. He should have expected this for being too arrogant.”

Of course, these people weren’t annoyed because they had feuds with Fiercest, only out of simple jealousy.

Meanwhile, the emperors held the sword with both hands; his eyes shone like two divine lamps illuminating the world. Nothing could hide before his eyes.

“It’s over.” Strangely enough, his comment didn’t carry that much confidence.

Given his power, he could tell that the slash indeed made contact against Li Qiye. No, he was one hundred percent sure about this.

Logically, no one should be able to survive the slash after a clean connection. Alas, their enemy was Fiercest. The four still had lingering doubts and didn’t know if they have killed him or not.

“Indeed, it is time to end this.” A leisure voice sounded.

Everyone looked back and saw Fiercest standing in his old spot as if he didn’t move at all.

It seemed as if he had evaporated from thin air earlier. No one could see the mysteries behind it all.

“Incredible speed.” An old voice came from behind Jade-break True Emperor. He was the only one who saw everything in spite of Li Qiye’s agility, unlike the rest.

“...” Puresword True Emperor staggered backward.

“All beneath the realm of progenitor and Everlasting are mere ants. I simply took one step forward, thinking that your slash will follow me. But no, it stopped at the present.” Li Qiye said.

The emperor turned pale. Actual time traveling across the temporal river... This was beyond temporal simulations and predictions - something that Eternals could do.

When Li Qiye took one step forward earlier, he managed to leave the present. The emperor didn’t know whether he traveled to the past or the present. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He was only channeling a state similar to that of a progenitor and wasn’t an actual one. His slash couldn’t give chase across time.

It seemed like a clean connection and that he had severed Li Qiye into two halves. Alas, this wasn’t the case since Li Qiye existed in a different timeline at that point.

While in the present, one couldn’t cut the past or the future unless their slash could exceed the temporal boundaries.
