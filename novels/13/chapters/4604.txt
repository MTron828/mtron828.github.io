Chapter 4605: Five-sun King

“Come on, now is the best time, don’t wait and miss the opportunity. In fact, have the wedding today.” Xiao Xuan stared at the two.

She was even more direct and dropped the engagement ceremony altogether.

Ye Tingrong didn’t expect her to be so direct, removing some of the formalities.

Even if she wanted to marry Jian Ming, there was still a process to follow through since it involved her sect as well - the proposal, the engagement, and then the wedding ceremony. This was not a joke or a matter to be taken lightly.

“No, no, Lady, please don’t scare her, we’re not forcing anyone to do anything.” Jian Ming waved his hands.

“So what, this is a marriage bestowed by the young noble. Miss this chance and there will be nothing like it happening to you again.” Xiao Xuan said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Haha…” Jian Ming glanced awkwardly over at Li Qiye.

Even if the young noble wanted to pair them together, Jian Ming wasn’t ready for it. This was his first time experiencing something like this. He had only just met her so to decide right now was illogical. It was an issue affecting his entire life.

Of course, Xiao Xuan didn’t care about their feelings. She was only hoping for a fun development, wanting to find opponents. There was no doubt that the ancestors from the behemoths were the best candidates.

Ye Tingrong didn’t say anything since she had the same qualms as Jian Ming. She knew nothing about him and his clan. Moreover, her marriage wasn’t something she could decide either.

Silence took over the room but it didn’t last long. A bit later, loud noises came from outside and attracted everyone’s attention.

It resembled the matching of a great legion - neighs and bestial roars. There seemed to be a big shot arriving near the shop.

A majestic power poured down like an endless ocean of the olden days. This power has been washed and polished by time.

“This is…?” The Improper Four exchanged glances, realizing who was coming.

“Who is it? What a show-off.” Jian Ming and the daoist did the same. They could tell that this power was both powerful and ancient - a sign of an impressive bloodline.

“Hmm..” Ye Tingrong was moved by the presence of this newcomer.

Li Qiye didn’t care at all as he sat there, completely unaffected by the aura.

“Which junior is this?” Xiao Xuan only glanced outside once. Her attention was on pairing Jian Ming and Ye Tingrong together.

Someone finally walked into the store; his presence illuminated the entire room by adding a layer of golden light to everything.

A great man visiting a humble abode was the right phrase to describe this entrance. The oceanic aura became increasingly palpable. Everything else seemed like a grain of salt in comparison. He appeared to be the lord of the myriad dao, demanding submission.

A divinity existed within him, a testament of his ancient and noble bloodline. The beasts and birds would prostrate in his presence.

“Five-sun King.” Jian Ming became startled.

“Five-sun King?” Tingrong felt the same way after hearing this title. After all, virtually everyone has heard of him before - a potential candidate for the dao lord position.

She shuddered because this was obviously not a coincidence. She started thinking about the possibilities.

He didn’t come alone. Behind him were two gorgeous women. One wore a blue dress, looking pure and unreachable like a lily in the valley.

The other was alluring like an enchantress with a sexy figure. Others couldn’t avert their gaze from her curves. This was a ripe fruit inviting others to take a bite.

They were opposite yet still desirable all the same. The contrast only accentuated their attractiveness. Both walked behind the king like two maids, inciting envy and jealousy.

“Snow-realm Princess and Silk Valley Lord. How lucky is he…” Jian Ming recognized both women.

He started fantasizing about their relationship and became jealous. Nonetheless, this was normal due to his status and talent. Only a true dragon among men was deserving of these beauties.

Five-sun King looked around the room. His gaze made others tense up due to his power and reputation. It didn’t matter that he was restraining his aura after entering.

However, he was visibly stirred after seeing the Improper Four, clearly recognizing them.
