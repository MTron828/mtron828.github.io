Chapter 5730: The Dao Is Lonely

“Crack!” The branches then drilled into the ground, acting like roots. Mud and rock also grew on him and reshaped his body, making it the size of a mound.

Upon closer inspection, one would find that he was still alive while being connected to the earth veins down below.

His vitality, dao power, and true fate released dao essences to gestate the land, not stopping for a single second.

This was Li Qiye’s way of amending the suffering of this region. As long as he was alive, his cultivation would only serve the land. An apex conqueror in this special state could still live for a long time. He became a living ginseng, nourishing the living beings and the land.

Luminous watched the whole thing and turned pale, aware of this terrible fate - being imprisoned for an eternity and used as a nourishment.

“Do it.” He faced reality and lifted his head, opened his mouth, and pointed at it: “Pin me down from here.”

“Buzz.” Li Qiye showed no mercy and pierced him with the light.

“Ahh!” He didn’t fare better than West Bank and still screamed. Of course, his screams were different due to being pierced down the throat.

His true fate, vitality, and dao connected with the earth veins below. The essences of the dao fruits began to nourish the land. Soil and rock took over him, turning him into a hill as well.

The previous invasions left devastating damage to the region. Now, the broken areas began to heal.

Full recovery was impossible in a short time but with their nourishment, life would come back in due time. Their dao essences would last for eras. Vegetations and trees came first before precious alchemy materials.

Dao Domain would return to being a paradise suitable for cultivation and prosperity in the future.

The survivors watched in silence. Although they hated the duo, they no longer cursed loudly after seeing the miserable fate of the two apex conquerors.

Li Qiye glanced at the two hills for a second before entering Immortal Dao City, not bothering to comment.

Someone awaited him inside - the regal Genesis Conqueror.

She stared at him in a daze and recalled the past - a place known as Cleansing Incense back in the nine worlds.

He was chosen as her disciple when they first met. After so many years, he still looked the same, as inconspicuous as ever.

However, he was no longer the first disciple of Cleansing Incense but the lord of this world, capable of controlling the fate of emperors and conquerors.

It felt like a dream as she stood before an epoch lord.

“How come you’re not happy to see your disciple?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile.

She came to her senses and glared at him, feeling a bit helpless at how powerful he had become. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He came over for a hug and she returned the gesture. She rested her head on his chest and seemingly returned to the past - when everything was home and not distant like today.

She was none other than the sect master of Cleansing Incense - Su Yonghuang.

She ascended with him to the thirteen continents and continued to train after his departure. After the grand calamity, she saw her deficiencies and decided to start over again - breaking her previous cultivation and starting with the dao of the new epoch.

She became a conqueror with a unique path - using just one dao fruit. They then called her “Genesis” for starting this path.

“I didn’t think I would meet you again.” She hugged him tightly.

Despite saying this, she had never wavered and knew that they would be able to meet again. Eras have passed and he still looked the same as ever.

“Why wouldn’t we?” He smiled: “As long as you keep on moving forward, I can’t bear to not see my sweet master again.”

“Don’t be cheeky.” She said while the feelings of the past returned to warm her heart in this fleeting moment.

Enduring countless years and hardships seemed to be worthwhile now.

“As you already know, the dao is lonely. Can you continue forward?” He smiled while gazing at her eyes.

She glared defiantly back and said: “Why can’t I?”
