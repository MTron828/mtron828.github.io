“Let’s get started.” Semi-sword God stared intensely at Three-eyed Prodigy and uttered coldly with a murderous glint flashing in his eyes.

Three-eyed Prodigy and Spiritheart True Emperor exchanged glances, instantly coming to a mutual understanding without needing to speak.

Semi-sword God’s eyes grew colder while looking at these two; his murderous intent became stronger.

In his opinion, Three-eyed Prodigy must die for sure. He would never let the youth leave this place alive.

“Die!” In this split second, The duo shouted in unison and made their move.

Spiritheart Emperor was one step ahead of Three-eyed Prodigy. The golden wings behind her spread while issuing clanks - each feather resembled a golden saber.

Her wings had golden pulses as if a million sabers were hanging there. The radiance activated her saber intent and in the blink of an eye, the entire world seemingly became engulfed in their might.

“You’re going down!” Spiritheart True Emperor shouted as her wings slashed vertically at the sword god. A seven-palace emperor like her was no slouch. [1]

“Clank!” The two wings slashed down like two sabers - capable of severing the celestials and splitting the grand dao and primordial chaos.

She also exuded her imperial aura, resulting in a loud boom. The aura billowed like a tsunami and gathered around the two sabers, causing them to become more resplendent and domineering.

The sword god snorted in response, clearly not impressed.

“Clank!” He activated his own majestic sword dao. He simply held the sword hilt but everyone felt as if he was gripping the entire world.

One slash cut through the sky and severed the ten directions, easily sealing everything and not allowing others to take half a step forward.

“Boom!” Her golden sabers slammed on his massive sword yet barely moved it. Her move capable of cutting down the sun, moon, and stars couldn’t break through his defensive seal.

“Boom!” He then retaliated by exerting his pressure forward after the successful parry.

Everyone felt the sky turning dark with the descend of his sword. It was as if the entire sky vault was falling down - a feeling of total suffocation.

“Boom!” She blocked his attack but her golden sabers crumbled, forcing her to stagger backward.

However, she wasn’t going to lose that easily and leaped up to the sky. Her left wing inched forward like a large and thick golden shield and smashed straight at the sword god’s blade.

Meanwhile, her right blade-like wing started rotating. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” A golden maelstrom immediately appeared in the sky as her sabers created a perilous storm. They then chop forward without showing any mercy like the endless tides.

“Rumble!” Her shield and slashes struck his sword relentlessly, successfully quaking this world-crushing blade.

“Boom!” She also activated her twelve palaces, seven of which have been lit up.

The worldly essences, power, and grand dao were absorbed by these bright palaces and moved to her golden wings.

The shield and sabers exuded a brilliant radiance and showed no mercy in their onslaught.

“Rumble!” Even someone as powerful as he couldn’t help staggering several steps backward.

“That’s a True Emperor for you, having advantages unavailable to True Gods.” Many praised after seeing this scene.

“Eat this!” The sword god roared after being shaken.

“Boom!” He took one step forward and seemingly crushed the world.

“Clank!” Another slash emerged and ravaged heaven and earth before breaking the firmament.

This vertical slash caused loud booms before actually arriving. Space instantly crumbled beneath its brilliance.

“So strong.” Many people by the lake took a deep breath, thinking that this slash could slay an emperor.

“Boom!” The world trembled with towering waves emanating since the slash nearly penetrated the lake entirely.

She had a hard time resisting this slash and staggered backward again, feeling her inner energy churn.

She was undoubtedly weaker than him in terms of strength.

“Die!” She jumped up again with a sword in hand. Her two wings turned into two swords for a dual slash. This ended up being a three-pronged attack.

“Come!” He rotated his body like a tornado before thrusting his sword straight forward.

The battle raged on. Despite being stronger, he would still need more than a few moves to take her down.

Meanwhile, Three-eyed Prodigy’s figure flashed as he rushed for the lingzhi.

His speed was extremely fast, seemingly crossing through three thousand worlds in a split second and instantly appeared before the lingzhi.

“You need our permission first!” Flying Sword Marvel and Shen Guzhan shouted.

They attacked the youth in unison, one from the left and one from the right.

“Boom!” Shen Guzhan utilized a world-shaking move - a supreme palm domain.

This domain had the blessing of the gods and emperors. It seemed as if these invincible sages were attacking Three-eyed Prodigy with palm strikes.

One could instantly hear the roar of the grand dao under the suppression of these great beings. It didn’t take long before Three-eyed Prodigy’s grand dao became suppressed by Shen Guzhan.

“Clank!” A sword hymn resounded with Flying Sword Marvel joining in. Myriad swords flew to the sky and attacked Three-eyed Prodigy in the form of a sword domain

“It’s not looking good.” One ancestor cried out. Everyone could see that Three-eyed Prodigy was no match for these two.

Next, Three-eyed Prodigy’s figure jolted a bit as if he was making a wrong step.

“Rumble!” Explosions echoed across the area. The entire world seemed to be vibrating.

After this seemingly wrong step from Three-eyed Prodigy, the lava spring suddenly gushed forward like an eruption. Lava waves like a tsunami rushed towards the two attackers.

“Zzz.” The lava rushing to the sky instantly burned the spatial fabric.

The most terrifying thing wasn’t the surging lava itself. “Raa!” One could hear something akin to a dragon roar.

A gigantic fiery dragon also rushed out from the spring as well, raising its claws and aiming straight at Shen Guzhan and Flying Sword Marvel.

This was the manifestation of a progenitorial true fire accumulated in this lava spring after millions of years.

“Poof!” The entire world became trapped in an ocean of fire. “Zzz.” Even space started burning into the void.

“Activate!” The two’s expression soured after seeing this true fire capable of burning everything.

They stopped attacking Three-eyed Prodigy and shifted into a defensive mode instead. A divine border appeared in the sky; the other chose to use her myriad swords for protection to stop the incoming true fire.

“Thanks!” Three-eyed Prodigy laughed and began moving in a strange yet magical manner. He skipped through the lava beneath and instantly appeared before the lingzhi.

He clearly saw through the mysteries of this lava or he wouldn’t have been able to skip and even took advantage of it to stop his foes.

“Buzz.” The lingzhi felt danger the moment he got close and instantly drilled into the lava with extreme speed.

“Halt!” His eyes became bright and spewed out boundless laws that seal the area, forcing the lingzhi to stop.

He grabbed and uprooted it completely before putting it inside a carefully-prepared treasure box.

This was all part of his plan - from those two joining in and utilizing the lava to trapping the lingzhi.

“Not bad, the brat got some schemes.” Many started praising after seeing Three-eyed Prodigy taking the lingzhi in such a skillful manner without risking his life.

“Begin.” At this time, Semi-sword Heavenly God stared carefully at Three-eyed Prodigy and uttered coldly. A murderous glint flashed in his eyes.

At this time, Three-eyed Prodigy and Spiritheart True Emperor stared at each other. In this blink of an eye, the two had an implicit understanding. They didn’t need to speak.

While looking at Three-eyed Prodigy and Spiritheart True Emperor, Semi-sword Heavenly God’s eyes grew colder, his murderous intent became denser.

At this time, in Semi-sword Heavenly God’s opinion, Three-eyed Prodigy must die for sure. He would never let Three-eyed Prodigy leave this place alive.

“Die!” In this split second, Three-eyed Prodigy and Spiritheart True Emperor shouted in unison and their figures flashed.

Spiritheart True Emperor was one step ahead of Three-eyed Prodigy. The wings behind her spread. One could hear clanking sounds as the golden wings behind her opened; each feather resembled golden sabers.

Spiritheart True Emperor’s wings spread and had golden pulses. The two wings seemed to have a million sabers hanging there. When the feathers exuded a golden brilliance, the saber intent intensified. In the blink of an eye, the entire world seemingly became engulfed in a million divine sabers.

“Die!” Spiritheart True Emperor shouted. Her wings slashed downward straight at Semi-sword Heavenly God.

Spiritheart True Emperor was a seven-palace True Emperor so she wasn’t weak at all.

“Clank!” The two wings slashed down with clanking sounds like two sabers slashing down with great sharpness - capable of severing the sun, moon, and the stars along with splitting the grand dao and primordial chaos.

At the same time, Spiritheart True Emperor exuded her True Emperor aura. One could hear a loud boom. This True Emperor aura billowed like a tsunami. The powerful True Emperor aura gathered on the two golden sabers, causing them to become more resplendent and domineering.

Semi-sword Heavenly God snorted in response to the two sabers from Spiritheart True Emperor.

“Clank!” A sound resounded; the sword dao was majestic. He was only holding a sword but everyone felt as if he was gripping the entire world.

One slash cut through the sky and severed the ten directions. When Semi-sword Heavenly God’s slash came out, it easily sealed everything, not allowing others to take half a step forward.

“Boom!” In this split second, Spiritheart True Emperor’s golden sabers struck the massive sword of Semi-sword Heavenly God and barely moved it.

The sabers capable of cutting down the sun, moon, and stars couldn’t break through Semi-sword Heavenly God’s seal.

“Boom!” A loud sound resounded. When Spiritheart True Emperor’s golden saber was stopped, Semi-sword Heavenly God’s massive sword moved and came pressing down in the blink of an eye.

When Semi-sword Heavenly God’s massive sword came pressing down, everyone felt the sky turning dark. This sword pressing down felt like the entire sky vault was falling down, making it hard to breathe.

“Boom!” Spiritheart True Emperor faced Semi-sword Heavenly God’s attack. Her golden sabers collapsed and she staggered several steps backward.

However, Spiritheart True Emperor wasn’t going to lose that easily. She leaped up and in this blink of an eye, her left wing pulled forward like a large and thick golden shield that smashes straight at Semi-sword Heavenly God’s massive sword.

At the same time, Spiritheart True Emperor’s right wing in the form of a million golden sabers rotated.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” A golden maelstrom immediately appeared in the sky. The million golden sabers seemingly created a perilous storm. Next, the million golden sabers cut directly down. Each cut seemed like a massive golden wave showing no mercy.

“Rumble!” Loud detonations were nonstop. Spiritheart True Emperor’s massive golden shield and the waves from the millions of golden sabers struck Semi-sword Heavenly God’s massive sword. The move shook the massive sword capable of crushing the world.

“Boom!” Another loud explosion. In this blink of an eye, Spiritheart True Emperor’s twelve palaces appeared. Seven among them have been lit up.

When the seven palaces became bright, the worldly essences, power, and grand dao were absorbed by these palaces and moved to Spiritheart True Emperor’s golden wings.

At this time, both the golden shield and tidal-like golden sabers exuded a resplendent light. They showed no mercy in attacking Semi-sword Heavenly God’s massive sword.

“Rumble!” Even someone as powerful as Semi-sword Heavenly God couldn’t help staggering several steps backward.

Many praised after seeing this scene: “That’s a True Emperor for you, having advantages unavailable to True Gods.”

“Eat my sword!” Semi-sword Heavenly God roared after being shaken by Spiritheart True Emperor.

“Boom!” Semi-sword Heavenly God took one step forward and seemingly crushed the world.

“Clank!” Semi-sword Heavenly God’s slash emerged and ravaged heaven and earth then broke the firmament.

This vertical slash already caused loud booms before actually arriving. The slash was invincible. In the blink of an eye, space instantly crumbled beneath this heavy sword.

“So strong.” Many people by the lake took a deep breath after seeing this scene. This slash could really kill a True Emperor.

“Boom!” The world trembled. Towering waves emanated from the lake. The entire lake seemed to be pierced completely.

Spiritheart True Emperor had a hard time resisting this slash. She staggered several steps backward; her inner energy churning.

There was no doubt that Spiritheart True Emperor was considerably weaker than Semi-sword True God in terms of strength.

“Die!” She jumped up again with a sword in hand. The two wings turned into two swords for a dual cut. This three-pronged attack headed straight for Semi-sword Heavenly God.

“Come!” Semi-sword Heavenly God rotated his body once like a tornado before personally thrusting straight at Spiritheart True Emperor.

In this split second, Semi-sword Heavenly God and Spiritheart True Emperor fought fiercely. Though Semi-sword Heavenly God was stronger than Spiritheart True Emperor, Spiritheart True Emperor wasn’t a weakling. If Semi-sword Heavenly God wanted to defeat Spiritheart True Emperor, he would need more than a few moves.

While Spiritheart True Emperor was attacking Semi-sword Heavenly God, Three-eyed Prodigy’s figure flashed as he headed for the lingzhi.

His speed was extremely fast, seemingly crossing through three thousand worlds in a split second. He instantly stood before the lingzhi.

“You need our permission first!” Flying Sword Marvel and Shen Guzhan shouted as Three-eyed Prodigy crossed through the lava spring.

They attacked Three-eyed Prodigy in unison, one from the left and one from the right.

“Boom!” A loud explosion shook the world. Shen Guzhan made his move - a supreme palm domain.

This domain had the blessing of the gods and emperors. It seemed as if these invincible sages were attacking Three-eyed Prodigy with palm strikes.

One could instantly hear the roar of the grand dao under the suppression of the gods and emperors. In the blink of an eye, Three-eyed Prodigy’s grand dao seemingly became suppressed by Shen Guzhan.

“Clank!” A sword hymn resounded with Flying Sword Marvel joining in. Myriad swords flew to the sky. Her figure slightly moved and a million swords attacked Three-eyed Prodigy. In this blink of an eye, a sword domain turned into a net. A million swords wanted to kill Three-eyed Prodigy. [1]

“It’s not looking good.” One ancestor cried out after seeing this scene. Everyone could see that Three-eyed Prodigy was no match for these two.

However, in this blink of an eye, Three-eyed Prodigy’s figure jolted a bit as if he was making a wrong step.

“Rumble!” Explosions echoed across the nine heavens and ten earths. The entire world seemed to be vibrating.

After this wrong step from Three-eyed Prodigy, the lava spring suddenly gushed forward, seemingly exploded. Lava waves like a tsunami rushed towards Shen Guzhan and Flying Sword Marvel.

“Zzz.” The lava rushing to the sky instantly burned space.

The most terrifying thing wasn’t the surging lava either. “Raa!” One could hear something akin to a dragon roar.

When the lava spring erupted, a gigantic fiery dragon also rushed out as well. It raised its claws, aiming straight at Shen Guzhan and Flying Sword Marvel.

This wasn’t actually a fire dragon. It was a true fire accumulated in this lava spring after millions of years.

This true fire was at the progenitorial level so it looked like a fire dragon capable of incinerating everything.

“Poof!” The entire world became trapped in an ocean of fire. “Zzz.” Even space started burning into nothingness.

“Activate!” Shen Guzhan and Flying Sword Marvel’s expression soured against the true fire capable of burning everything.

They stopped attacking Three-eyed Prodigy and shifted into a defensive mode instead. A divine border appeared in the sky; the other chose to use her myriad swords for protection to stop the incoming true fire.

“Thanks!” Three-eyed Prodigy laughed and began moving in a strange yet magical manner. He skipped through the lava beneath and instantly appeared before the lingzhi.

Three-eyed Prodigy clearly saw through the mysteries of this lava. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to skip and even took advantage of it to stop Shen Guzhan and Flying Sword Marvel.

“Buzz.” The lingzhi felt danger the moment Three-eyed Prodigy got close and instantly drilled into the lava with extreme speed.

“Halt!” Three-eyed Prodigy’s eyes became bright and spewed out boundless laws. His eyes sealed the area and the lingzhi was forced to stop.

He grabbed and uprooted it completely before putting it inside a carefully-prepared treasure box.

This was all within his plan - from those two joining in and utilizing the lava to trapping the lingzhi.

“Not bad, the brat got some schemes.” Many started praising after seeing Three-eyed Prodigy taking the lingzhi in such a skillful manner without risking his life.
