Chapter 4264: Dao Lords’ Appearance

The burning signaled their intent to die and take Li Qiye down with them. This type of fire spell rendered escaping impossible regardless of one’s power and heaven-defying method.

“Zzz…” Dao laws and other physical affinities were being incinerated by the true flames. Even the cycle of karma was affected. This was all for the sake of killing Li Qiye.

“They really want to kill him.” A big shot turned pale while watching this from a safe distance.

This suicidal method was immensely destructive. Moreover, the users were two top cultivators channeling the power of their sect’s foundation and fellow members.

The foundations have been blessed and empowered by countless masters in the past. Thus, the accumulation of energy there was immense. Thus, the ignition resulted in an incalculable attack - one creating black holes in the air.

“Is it worth it? To go down together with Li Qiye.” A big shot murmured, aware that the two sects were about to pay a shocking price.

“Absolutely for the duo. They want to kill Li Qiye at all cost, that’s the only way to survive.” A high elder said.

No one disagreed because the feud had reached an irreconcilable level.

“They could have saved their sect before by committing suicide. Their pride got in the way.” An ancient ancestor shook his head.

This was indeed the case. Li Qiye gave them a chance but they were too confident in their ace card. They could have used their lives as a token of apology earlier. That might have been enough for Li Qiye to spare their sects.

“Unfortunately, it’s too late for that.” Another expert said: “Li Qiye will destroy their sects if he stays alive.”

“Are you sure? He’s merciless but might not be that extreme. The duo can still give up their life along with many ancestors. The sects then can offer him their resources, that might be enough for him to stop.” The ancient ancestor responded.

The crowd didn’t respond. This scenario was utterly humiliating. Which sect would be willing to go so far?

“That’s no different than sect destruction. They might as well go all out.” A sect master murmured.

The prideful behemoths would never agree to those conditions.

“Yes, it is better to die than live in disgrace.” Someone else added.

“That’s exactly what they’re thinking, still holding on to a sliver of hope. My scenario at least saves their younger members. There is always firewood as long as the verdant hills remain. Otherwise, their sects will be destroyed.” The ancient ancestor chuckled.

“Boom!” The true flames continued to ravage the air and suddenly erupted with a monstrous divinity.

Laws of a dao lord shot vertically upward and blinded the spectators. Incredible figures then appeared in both sects. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Sword Sea Dao Lord!” A spectator recognized one figure.

“Saberlearned, Violet Abyss, Starshooter, Nine-wheel, Immovable Dao Lord…” Spectators shouted in astonishment.

Their suffocating auras began ravaging the firmaments and forced everyone on their knees. No one had ever seen such a magnificent spectacle before, not even the two overlords.

“They summoned all nine…” The hidden masters turned pale after seeing this incredible gathering.

“That’s why their foundations are unbeatable.” A sect master became emotional.

This was the reason why the two behemoths dominated for so long. Their foundation was just superior to every other sect.

“The ancestors have answered our call and will protect us.” Their members prostrated and smacked their forehead on the ground while crying.

They were overwhelmed with emotion after seeing the great sages of their sect. Just seeing the portrait of a dao lord was a great honor, let alone their activated energy form.
