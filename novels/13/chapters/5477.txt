Chapter 5478: Gentle Breezes

Ye Fantian became the center of attention since she had just been offered the ultimate fortune. Her future had limitless potential if she were to accept.

She was already brilliant for cultivating twelve dao fruits at the same time, something that had only been done by Light-dragon and Demon Conqueror. By choosing to follow Li Qiye, she would undoubtedly exceed her predecessors.

Ye Fantian glanced back at Swordsea Dao Lord. Although she had left Divine Alliance, she still didn’t forget about her roots.

“Go, I have nothing more to teach you on this path.” Swordsea was excited for her and said: “I’ll be in isolated cultivation after this for who knows how many years? Being taught by the young noble is a supreme fortune.”

He was her unofficial master but now, she had carved her own path after possessing twelve dao fruits. He didn’t have much to teach her any longer and supported Li Qiye’s decision.

She kneeled before Swordsea and performed a full rite while speaking: “It was a blessing of three lifetimes to have you as a master. Please accept.”

With that, she kowtowed nine times. Everyone understood that she might not return to see Swordsea again, unable to repay his kindness. This gesture was warranted so Swordsea didn’t stop her.

After finishing, she stood up and bowed to those standing behind Swordea: “Seniors, I will not forget your kindness.” They had helped with her training and even protected her.

“The dao is endless but you all will go far.” Li Qiye then turned toward All-things and his allies.

They didn’t have a strong connection with Li Qiye so they didn’t kneel. All-things was the most polite out of them and bowed: “We will cherish your advice, Young Noble, and will not stop progressing.”

Li Qiye nodded and didn’t say anything else.

“Will we meet again?” Xiao Hu ran to the front and looked up at him.

Li Qiye gently stroked his head and smiled: “That depends on your future accomplishments.”

“I will try my best.” The youth clenched his fists and declared before running back to Hallowed Dao Lord.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I should pay Pure Land a visit.” Li Qiye said.

“I’ll accompany you, Young Noble.” Jilin Buddhist Emperor said softly, not expecting to see him again after an epoch of time.

“Return first and wait.” Li Qiye said before gazing into the distance where someone was waving at him.

“We will be waiting, Young Noble.” She bowed.

Li Qiye nodded and floated up into the air, eventually disappearing into the horizon.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief after his departure. The battle today was unforgettable even to the battle-hardened veterans since it changed the direction of the upper continents.

Li Qiye left an indelible mark in their memories. They thought that they had gone far enough on the dao path. Alas, witnessing his power made them wonder whether they had even started cultivating. There was much work to be done, but at the very least, the possibilities of the dao were clearly endless.

An ancient pine coiled like a dragon above a divine peak. The latter towered over the landscape but still seemed tiny compared to the tree.

A woman perched on top of one of its branches, kicking her legs back and forth. She wore a white robe with her hair tied up in a bun, looking like a man at first sight.

Her appearance could only be described as average. Nonetheless, she had no dead angle and one could never get tired of looking at her. Ordinary yet remarkably captivating - words couldn’t describe the juxtaposition.

She had drunk with Li Qiye previously and now, he joined her again on the tree branch.

Gentle breezes caused the pine needles to sway softly and rustle like the waves of the ocean. The world could be seen in its entirety before them.

She glanced at Li Qiye and asked: “So? Did you feel cool playing the high heaven?”

She paused for a moment and had a faint smirk: “Being the high heaven feels pretty good, right?”

“How pointless, just another repetition. What I seek is not to replace but rather, an answer.” He shook his head in response.

“Why not ask me?” She smiled playfully but her suggestion contained strong implications.

“Even if I were to ask you, you don’t know the answer, it is the same yet not.” He said.

“Oh? So you’ve figured it out.” She smiled.

“What I saw before wasn’t like this.” He said: “I didn’t recognize it then.”

“Because I defeated you so thoroughly.” She said before pausing for a bit: “Yes, the same yet not, but in the end, the same origin.”

“Indeed.” He admitted: “From what I can tell, this impossible matter has precedents.”

“It’s different this time, mission-wise.” She shook his head.

“Why does it come?” He stared at her and asked.

She cast a glance at the horizon and didn’t answer. It seemed that all living beings and the lands were within her sight.

After a brief pause, she said slowly: “This world is truly beautiful.”

“There are some ugly aspects but yes, it is beautiful indeed.” He nodded.
