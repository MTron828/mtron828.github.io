Chapter 5422: Illumination’s Fate

“Bam!” Illumination smashed into the spatial fabrics of the grotto, nearly sending it flying.

Supreme landed as well, ready to help Swordsea Dao Lord.

Although the skirmishes inside the grotto raged on, spectators only paid attention to this particular battle between the apex cultivators.

“There’s no salvaging this.” Someone commented.

Illumination couldn’t handle his opponents, not to mention All-things Dao Lord waiting in the background.

“Can’t build a house with a single tree.” A dragon lord murmured.

When Immensity was still around, Illumination had a chance of winning or at least making a safe escape. Now, he was surrounded by equally-capable foes.

“Bam!” Another figure descended next to Supreme and Swordsea Dao Lord.

“Eternal Conqueror!” The big shots became startled.

“Yeah, this is over.” Another said.

“This was inevitable.” All-things sighed and said.

“Brother Illumination, if there is no other reinforcement, this is the end of the road for you.” Supreme said with a charismatic tone, seemingly always in charge of any situation. This was the reason why he was trusted by Celestial Court for so long.

All eyes were on Illumination. Those from The People thought that this was the end for a polarizing figure. He fought Heaven Alliance his entire life and now, his fate was sealed by them.

Illumination was absolutely no savior but to call him a villain wasn’t quite right either. After all, many sympathized with his pitiful background and desire for vengeance.

“Hahaha, seems like there will be a conclusion today.” Illumination laughed heartily.

“We’ll send you on your way now.” Eternal said. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Hahaha, my life has been in vain since The Race shall take over soon enough.” Illumination looked at the sky and shouted.

“All-things, do you see?! This is the consequence of your compromising!” He then shouted at All-things Dao Lord.

“You are delusional, this is what you deserve.” All-things responded.

“What I deserve?! What have I done but attempt to build a world for The People?” Illumination responded.

“Illumination, you speak as if The People would have been turned to ashes in your absence. No, both sides have been around since time antiquity. What you have done is a mix of accomplishments and heinous crimes.” Swordsea coldly uttered.

“I have no guilty conscience for doing what’s best for The People, haha.” Illumination said.

“Truly pitiful, a conqueror gone mad.” Eternal commented.

“Let it go, perhaps there is still a glimmer of hope.” All-things advised.

“Brother All-things might not kill you but I will, you’re not leaving this place alive.” Swordsea disagreed.

At this point, Illumination’s supporters could only watch on the sideline since this was beyond their ability. They felt a deep sorrow in their heart, viewing Illumination as a tragic hero walking on a desperate path of no return.

“I’ve never cared about surviving since I’ve dedicated my life to The People…” Illumination said.

“Enough.” The friendly All-things Dao Lord interrupted him and said: “Brother Swordsea is right, you are lost in self-indulgence, believing that you’re a protector despite your crimes during Emperors War. Your arrogance and misguided judgment resulted in the death of numerous dragon lords and conquerors from The People, so stop attempting to justify your delusion. You are merely blaspheming the wise sages who were actual heroes during the great wars of past. They fought to protect while you were buried by hatred and vengeance. In fact, your actions are no different than that of Celestial Court, perhaps even worse. Do not tarnish the image of conquerors any longer, Illumination.”

All along, All-things rarely revealed his own stance, choosing to be neutral instead. He was viewed as a weak leader due to his tendency to compromise. Alas, he could listen to Illumination’s madness no longer.

“Well said.” Eternal agreed.

Even the supporters of Illumination had no retort after hearing this. After all, there was no erasing the past. Illumination was a true tyrant during Emperors War.

Some from The Race also agreed with the comparison with Celestial Court. This was the reason why their ancestors chose to defect and fought alongside The People instead during Immemorial Epoch War.

“It is alright, Illumination. Your struggle ends today.” Supreme remarked.
