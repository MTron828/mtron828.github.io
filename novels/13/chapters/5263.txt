Chapter 5264: Picking On The Li

Li Qiye and the old man had a “fun” chat. The latter tried to persuade Li Qiye to join his side to no avail.

“Buzz.” Suddenly, a shooting star crossed through the sky, leaving behind loud explosions.

A moon was its companion; the two disappeared into the horizon. Many cultivators in the upper continents saw this phenomenon.

“Did you see that? A treasure from above?” One big shot said.

“From above?” A junior became curious.

“Looks like an old friend of yours? Just returning or dying?” The old man asked with a smile.

Li Qiye sighed and stood up to leave.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Remember to come back soon, the only thing keeping me entertained in this world is you, stubborn bastard.” The old man waved in his direction.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be back.” Li Qiye said with a smile before exiting the door.

“We’re leaving.” He told the old servant and True Bear.

“It appeared in the old battlefield briefly.” The old servant saw the star earlier as well and sighed.

“Let’s go take a look, it’s about time.” Li Qiye said.

The old man didn’t say anything; True Bear let out a soft cry, ready to follow Li Qiye.

The trio left Imperial Attendant City without telling anyone. They stepped into the air and traveled to Lesser Firmament - a lineage even more mysterious than Azure Peak.

Little was known and some of its territories have not been visited by outsiders, not even apex conquerors and dao lords.

Some considered it to be an alliance just like the others. However, it didn’t seem to have a particular goal.

The trio arrived in Lesser Firmament while chasing after the shooting star. For Li Qiye, the star itself only served as a reminder. There was someone he needed to see. Moreover, they needed to do a few things for him.

Among the wilderness was a tavern with the name “Wine” engraved on the swaying curtain. It emitted a sense of festivity and added joy to this desolate area.

Nothing was special about it outside of being a place to chat and have a drink with other travelers.

The trio entered and saw a woman already sitting there, giving off an aura that she was alone in this world.

Dressed in a sleek white attire with hair tied up in a masculine style, she exuded coolness and poise.

She didn’t possess a peerless beauty nor was she hideous - just an unremarkable appearance that would take time for appreciation. One couldn’t grow tired of looking at her regardless of the angle, always left wanting more.

Ordinary at first glance yet extraordinary upon closer inspection. It was hard to pinpoint what exactly made her so unique with just words.

She drank one bowl of wine after another but it felt as if she was just drinking plain water. However, her eyes became misty from intoxication - a great way to get a different perspective regarding life.

“Another.” She slapped the table and shouted. Despite the rudeness, no one would mind since it felt just right coming from her.

Another jar of wine appeared but there was no bartender. She casually tossed a string of precious pearls as payment.

Once again, the pearls disappeared as if a ghost was there to receive them.

The trio came and got a table to themselves. Li Qiye smiled and said: “Bring me one jar and some snacks.”

Sure enough, a jar appeared on the table along with five or so appetizers - salted peanuts, dried green beans, fennel beans… just common snacks to pair with alcohol.

He tossed a treasure into the air as a tip. It disappeared from sight despite no one being there to catch it.

The old servant poured a full bowl for Li Qiye before serving himself and True Bear. True Bear drank and he poured some more, certainly enjoying themselves.

Li Qiye only took a small sip and got a handful of beans. He chewed slowly and didn’t say anything.

“Is your last name Li?” The woman looked over at the group and asked; her vision apparently blurry from the alcohol.

“Does it matter?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I enjoy beating the Lis the most.” She chuckled in response, painting an unforgettable image accompanied by pleasant laughter.

“Well, I wish you the best of luck in finding and beating all of them.” Li Qiye gave her a thumbs-up.

She gave him a look of approval before asking the old servant: “And you?”

The old man finished another bowl before answering: “No.”

“You?” She asked the bear.

True Bear finished the rest of the jar before shaking his head repeatedly.

Li Qiye called for another jar before tossing out another treasure. It magically appeared on the table and the payment was taken.

“Why do you hate this last name?” Li Qiye casually asked while removing the shell of a peanut. He blew it away before savoring the taste.

“No reason, I just don’t like them.” She laughed heartily.

“Dao Alliance has someone with the last name Li.” The old servant suddenly said while having ulterior motives.

Li Qiye chuckled, agreeing with this move.

She scoffed before responding: “Li Er is a coward, not worth mentioning. There is only one Li in the world who is truly worth my time.”

Having said that, she stared intensely at Li Qiye as if trying to discern something about him.

Li Qiye nodded in response: “Yep, it’s quite embarrassing how none of them can fight or achieve anything nowadays.”

“I agree, they’re all cowardly turtles.” She chuckled in response.

“People say that turtles live long because they hide in their shell and ignore everything else until the coast is clear. This is true for all the Lis, just cowardly bastards.” Li Qiye peeled a fennel bean while speaking.

“Haha, perfect comparison.” She burst into laughter.

“As far as I know, the longest-living turtle just happens to have the last name Li. It’s rather frustrating how they just get away with it.” Li Qiye continued.
