Chapter 5179: Still Getting Rid Of Loose Ends After Death

“I do have to say that I admire you for taking care of loose ends even after death. Not even a strand of death energy is running rampant. On the other hand, your brothers are still causing trouble afterward, creating forbidden zones with chaotic energies.” Li Qiye said.

“I have a reputation to maintain, gotta go out in a dignified manner. Since this grave is my eternal home, I have to clean it up since I don’t to lay in filth. That’s where you went wrong, if you kill someone, you have to properly take care of their remains too.” The old man said.

“Who will pick up my corpse then? I got reduced into nothingness, at least you fared a bit better.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“True, it went pretty bad for you.” The old man nodded in agreement for once.

During their conversation, another white-haired old man wearing a blue robe appeared nearby. He had a muscular frame, looking rather tough. His beard looked rugged, most likely prickly to the touch.

Due to his broad shoulders and rough hands, he gave the impression of someone capable of doing physical labor without any complaint.

He crouched in the other corner instead of getting closer, becoming another beggar on this street.

However, Li Qiye and the first beggar didn’t pay attention to him.

“Do you know about those three stones?” The old man asked.

“Yes, I’ve thought about them before.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I see…” The old man shifted his body a bit, seemingly becoming numb from laying in the same position for too long: “He will too, I’m sure you’ll have to deal with it eventually.”

“Why does everyone force me to do things?” Li Qiye asked.

The old man stared at Li Qiye and said: “You have the ticket right now and besides, you’ve been pulling him along too, he knows it.”

“Of course.” Li Qiye agreed.

“You can tell how bored I’ve been after death, spending all my time pondering about this stuff. You will have to face it.” The old man said.

“Why would he take the time?” Li Qiye asked.

“These three stones are different, they might not devour or merge with each other.” The old man said.

“Waiting for me.” Li Qiye said.

The old man nodded: “Since you have the ticket, you must participate. That’s the whole point.”

“And if I don’t?” Li Qiye smirked.

“It’ll be a problem then. If you don’t enter the stage, then he’ll make his move before the villainous heaven.” The old man said while keeping his eyes closed.

“That’s what I want because finding a person is so exhausting. Let him come to me, it’s more convenient that way.” Li Qiye said.

“That depends on the price you’re willing to pay.” The old man revealed a smile that could frighten emperors.

“I might not have to be the one paying.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s different.” The old man said: “You two are simply different. He has nothing to lose, the same can’t be said about you.”

“Is that so?” Li QIye stroked his chin.

“I know that he personifies this phrase - all are mere straw dogs beneath the heaven.” The old man nodded.

“Just the same crap as the villainous heaven, nothing new.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“It’s rather interesting. The two of you both have a chance but your pursuit is different. He might become the second villainous heaven, not you.”

“It would be meaningless and uncreative. Even if one becomes the villainous heaven, there will always be someone else to take the spot.” Li Qiye said lazily.

“That’s why we’re different from you two, we just want to devour.” The old man chuckled.

“You all have gone mad.” Li Qiye commented.

“Indeed, you will become like us once you are no longer able to control your desires.” The old man said.

“It won’t happen to me, I know what I want and what I seek, that’s all there is to it. I do not covet anything else.” Li Qiye said.

“Hence my statement regarding our differences. However, he may be the same as the villainous heaven.” The old man said.

Li Qiye opened his eyes and stared at the sky: “How boring, a fate worse than death.”

“I have no complaints about death right now, feels pretty good.” The old man nodded.

Meanwhile, the old man dressed in blue sitting in the other corner prepared a large piece of paper and wrote something down.

“For sale.” The characters were written crookedly.

He raised the piece of paper, seemingly advertising himself to passersby but most importantly, Li Qiye and the other old man.

Since the two were sunbathing with their eyes closed, they didn’t seem to notice him. Nonetheless, he kept on raising the piece of paper in their direction.

The old man started the conversation again: “Though you have killed all of us, it doesn’t mean that all obstacles are gone. You need to kill more before reaching the villainous heaven.”

“Right beneath.” Li Qiye wasn’t surprised.

“Hahaha.” The old man laughed and said: “The villainous heaven thinks that all realms are within the constant cycle and never gave much thought about what looms right beneath.”

“The shadows down there are challenging indeed. Who doesn’t have a shadow?” Li Qiye commented.

“That’s why you’re needed.” The old man said.

“Not him?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“If I were the villainous heaven, I would be trying to cooperate with you instead of him.” The old man smiled.

“Oh? For what reason?” Li Qiye asked.

“If you need someone to work with, would you seek out someone who is identical to you?” The old man stared at Li Qiye.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I’m unsure, but that makes sense.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Therefore, the villainous heaven will look for you, and that’s when you need to deliver a blow during the negotiation.” The old man said confidently.

“A kind man such as myself never takes advantage of someone during their time of need.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Hahaha, what will you ask for then?” The old man didn’t buy it.

“We’ll just talk for a bit, I don’t have that many demands.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Fucker.” The old man couldn’t help but curse, seemingly on the verge of standing up to smack Li Qiye. However, he exercised restraint and only said: “That’s precisely taking advantage of someone during their time of need.”

“Haha.” Li Qiye seemed a bit embarrassed: “Maybe.”

“I wouldn’t want to negotiate with you if I were in his shoes, you bloodsucker.” The old man said.

“Well, who would you want to be killed by?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hmm…” This question required the old man to take his time.

“Neither.” He eventually answered.

“The villainous heaven is the heaven because he’s exceptional and superior in some aspects. He is certain of victory, hence your eternal defeat.” Li Qiye said.

“True.” The old man admitted.

So many epochs and they couldn’t defeat the villainous heaven, only to be imprisoned and driven crazy by hunger.

“I’m sure it’s interesting for him, watching you all fight to the death.” The old man said.

“Not necessarily.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Don’t tell me you want to team up with him?” The old man stared inquisitively at Li Qiye.

“He wants to join forces with me even more, perhaps.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Definitely plausible.” The old man nodded: “We do not need to restraint our desires but you, on the other hand, are willing to do so.”
