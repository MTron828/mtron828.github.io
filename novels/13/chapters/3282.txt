She had no interest in competing with him in terms of talents or anything else. She simply felt annoyed after being seen by him the previous time. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Mmm, that’s how I have always been, unreasonably confident.” Li Qiye casually responded.

The spectators glared at him, not liking how he was speaking to their goddess.

“So? Here to teach me a lesson?” He smirked at her.

Qianyue got the urge to stomp on him after seeing his smirk. She didn’t know why but there was just something infuriating about it.

However, she knew that he was neither stupid nor insane. Why was he so confident?

The young generation in Divine Black always treated her with reverence. Some didn’t even dare to look at her eye-to-eye or keep their head up straight. Now, this guy seemed completely unaffected; her presence was no different than air. This perplexed her.

Such calmness didn’t belong to a weak disciple.

“Correct, I want to break your annoying face.” She said without holding back despite being in public.

The others became even more excited, thinking that Li Qiye was really done for this time.

“Junior Sister, no need to dirty your hand hitting this worm.” An older disciple came forward and said: “I’ll make him a little bloody...”

He wanted to curry favor but Qianyue showed no appreciation, only a cold glare.

This made him very awkward, needing to swallow his words and turning red. He tried to be clever and ended up with eggs on his face. Strangely enough, he didn’t get mad at her and directed his anger towards Li Qiye instead.

“Feel free to try but I’m afraid you won’t be able to do it.” Li Qiye lazily said.

“Are you asking for a fight?” Qianyue coldly uttered while giving him a death stare.

She was unbeatable among the young generation by this point. Not even Zhan Hu or Huang Ning could take her on. Those two used to be the strongest but a big gap existed now.

Thus, challenging her was asking for humiliation.

“Sure, if you want. I can entertain you a little bit, just don’t cry when you lose.” Li Qiye spoke, seemingly disinterested.

“Asshole, take a look at yourself first and realize your insignificance before talking to Junior Sister Qianyue like this!” The previous admirer lost his cool and started yelling.

“That’s right, Senior Sister can beat you with just one move! Pah!”

Numerous disciples said foul words while glaring at Li Qiye. How could they let him act in this manner before their goddess?

“Silence!” Qianyue frowned and shouted due to the noises.

The group became surprised and immediately shut their mouth. Once again, they diverted their anger towards Li Qiye who was still smiling and lazily lying in his chair.

Qianyue had plenty of questions in her head. This man was certainly clear-headed. Why would he want to fight her?

He was only an Iron Skin at best. This cultivation realm was nothing in Divine Black. She could randomly find plenty of them in the sect.

Everyone knew the gap between Iron Skin and Samadhi Materialization - the difference between heaven and earth. Just comparing the two was silly.

“As you wish then.” She eventually uttered without understanding where he was coming from.

The spectators were stunned. They exchanged glances and had no idea how it got to this point.

The power disparity was simply unfair. Nothing could change the fact that she would be able to annihilate him with one move.

“Good, but just a fight is a little boring. Let’s make it interesting.” He smiled.

“What do you suggest?” Her eyes narrowed.

“If I lose, you can do whatever.” He rubbed his chin and said: “But what if you lose?” He ended with a grin while looking at her up and down in a suggestive manner.

Qianyue instinctively took one step back because she felt naked for some reason. This made her shudder.

She had never felt something like this before because her peers didn’t dare to look straight at her.

“Go on.” She calmed her mind and took a deep breath while feeling something dangerous. Intuition told her so but this didn’t make any sense.

How could an Iron Skin cultivator threaten her in any way?

“If you were to lose...” He continued rubbing his chin while smirking.

Everyone viewed this smile as wretched and nauseating. If gazes could kill, he would have died a thousand times over.

“Pah! A frog wanting to eat swan meat.” One of them mocked.

“As if he can win, maybe in his dream.” Another snorted.

“How dare he have these perverted thoughts? Senior Sister Qianyue can show mercy but I’ll kill him later.” One admirer had murderous thoughts.

They would never forgive Li Qiye for disrespecting their beloved goddess. This was an intolerable offense.
