Chapter 5445: Fixing Deficiencies

The three sat together, discussing the past and present. Azure Ancestor and Sentinel Treant happily told Li Qiye about their experiences in life.

Azure Ancestor, in particular, had a deep emotional connection with Li Qiye. Although he wasn’t her creator, he intervened and blessed her existence, allowing her birth and giving her enough health to survive.

He also asked Sentinel Treant and many other alchemy plants to protect and educate her. Thus, her current achievements and the success of the sky spirits were due to Li Qiye. She viewed him as her creator and a father figure.

By this point, she was an apex existence capable of fighting any dao lord or conqueror. Nonetheless, she reverted back to a little girl who had just reconnected with her father. Casually chatting and asking him questions filled her with joy.

She wanted to tell him about her life and growth in order to make up for the years of absence. It became clear that she had never forgotten about him, that traces of him were present at every moment of her life. His arrival filled the gaps in her life due to never having met him with wonderful colors.

Li Qiye stared at her and said sentimentally: “The sky spirits don’t possess your ancestral physique.”

The sky spirits were truly tiny while Azure Ancestor looked more human, albeit petite. The former could transform but that was not their true form.

“I possess this complete body due to your blessing, Young Noble.” She said: “The other sky spirits are innately flawed at birth.”

“We have tried our best during the birth of a new sky spirit but couldn’t do it as well as you, Young Noble. Thus, there is a concept of an ancestral body for the sky spirits, one that is unreachable.” Sentinel Treant added.

“Perhaps this is the nature of life, a race shouldn’t be perfect.” Li Qiye said: “If the sky spirits were flawless at the start, it could have been a disaster. Your race was a special creation and possessed a natural attunement with life force. If it were to have a perfect physical frame as well, it would reign superior to anything else and that’s a disaster in waiting.”

Their weak frame didn’t matter since their harmony with life forces granted them incredible strength. This was the reason why they preferred to stay in the forests and let the world nourish them. Galaxy was the perfect location for the sky spirits due to its abundant life force.

This innate talent made cultivation easy for them. On the other hand, it wasn’t entirely unbeatable.

For example, humans’ innate gift was their ease of reproduction - allowing them to populate faster than the majority of races. Quantity made up for quality when it came to human cultivators.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Since I am the first of my kind, I’ve been trying to fix this issue.” Azure Ancestor said: “We are so feeble and easily destroyed. Thus, I created Azure Peak. Although older sky spirits can’t be changed, the power of Galaxy might improve the physical constitutions of babies in the future.”

She paused for a second before continuing: “I don’t hope for them to possess the same body as I do, but I do hope they’ll grow a bit stronger. This is one of my lifelong goals.”

“We are getting relative success thanks to the tree and the special zone here.” Sentinel Treant continued: “The young ones are definitely stronger than the previous generations.”

“That’s good, fixing innate deficiencies afterward.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly.

“Young Noble, can you model the ancestral body for the next generation?” Azure Ancestor couldn’t help but ask since he was the one who gave her the gift.

“I can.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Young Noble, I have created the right momentum and fortunes in Azure Peak. Could you guide us so that our newborns can have an ancestral body as well?” She asked softly, feeling responsible for her race. This was the reason why she chose to protect Azure Peak instead of traveling freely like other dao lords and conquerors.

Li Qiye shook his head and explained: “Your ancestral body is a gift of nature. The sky spirit is a new race and with enough effort and time, innate deficiencies can be corrected to an extent. For example, humans can reproduce quickly but their lifespan is short. This is mended through other means, cultivation included.”

He paused for a bit before speaking seriously: “Gifting the ancestral body to your entire race can have disastrous consequences. A calamity, regardless of the form it takes, will descend in time if a new race is superior to everyone else. Extermination is inevitable.”
