Chapter 4653: The Hand’s Power

The value of what Golden Fist Emperor obtained became obvious at this point - something beyond even patrimony weapons.

“Could it be, the ultimate artifact of Worldbreaker?” Someone whispered.

“What do you mean?” An expert asked right away.

Others became interested in this conversation as well.

“The fist scripture, perhaps?” An ancestor mused.

According to the legends, there existed a scripture regarding the fist dao in Worldbreaker hidden in the scripture chamber. It contained the apex of the way of the fist. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In fact, some believed that it might be one of the strongest merit laws in existence. Its strength was comparable to the nine mythical scriptures. Because of this, top masters tried to infiltrate the chamber in order to catch a glimpse. Learning from it meant becoming invincible.

“Impossible.” A high ancestor shook his head: “The scripture can’t be taken away or Duality Master and some others would have taken it away back then.”

Others agreed with this erudite ancestor. Some beings have made it to the chamber before - Puresun and Eight-step Dragon Dao Lord, then Duality Master. The latter had even read the scriptures there.

However, none of them even took it with them, implying an impossibility. Thus, there was no way Golden Fist Emperor would be able to do so.

Though he was certainly strong, he had a long way to go before being on the same level as the dao lords.

“How the hell did he do it?” One big shot questioned.

“Boom!” The emperor was finally struck by the hand amidst the confusion.

It was only a light hit yet the emperor’s light extinguished instantly. The golden dao protecting him shattered so he vomited blood after falling to the ground.

Keep in mind that only ancient ancestors could take him on in a fight. Nonetheless, a touch from the hand nearly ended him. Another cultivator would have been reduced to ashes.

“Perish!” He knew that escaping was impossible so he retaliated instead.

“Boom!” He shot out a beam channeled from his entire body. It had the intensity of an exploding sun and illuminated all of Worldbreaker.

“Incredible!” Spectators were in awe of his full-effort attack.

Though they were about ten million miles away from his actual location, they still felt his fist energy rampaging through. Few in the world have reached this level.

The beam was just the preamble - the final variation included a sky-breaking punch. Unfortunately, his punch didn’t move the gigantic hand in the slightest. It kept on pressing down, wanting to suppress the emperor.

“?!” Many spectators gasped and took a deep breath.

That punch had enough power to wipe out a sect. Alas, it only served to tickle the hand at best.

“How can this be?!” One youth shouted.

The emperor was an unreachable existence in their eyes. They could train for a lifetime and never be able to catch up. Now, he looked like an ant before the might of Worldbreaker. This was an eye-opener for the young cultivators.

“This is Worldbreaker we’re talking about. It is impossible to beat it, only dao lords can even think about this topic.” A big shot sighed and said.

“Rumble!” His fist pulsed with a golden radiance.

Alas, as the hand pressed downward, the light pulsed unstably and became dimmer. His personal barrier was breaking down. He roared and used all of his strength only to find that this was impossible.

“He’s dead for sure.” An expert murmured.

Everyone could tell that the hand was overwhelming. Its victim couldn’t escape the fate of being crushed to death.

They started thinking about the peerless treasure. However, none dared to enter Worldbreaker right now. Provoking that hand meant death since even the emperor was helpless.

They thought about one being who had a chance right now - San Qiandao. Alas, even he felt inadequate when dealing with Worldbreaker.

During this life-or-death moment, the emperor gritted his teeth and decided to take out the gemstone.

“Clank!” Its appearance came with a sharp and clear sound.
