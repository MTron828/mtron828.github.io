The spectators pondered about Zeng Yibin’s intent. The experienced youths shook their heads.

They weren’t empathizing with Li Qiye, just annoyed at Yibin’s gloating demeanor.

When the king still had his kingdom, he probably wouldn’t have dared to let a fart out. Look at him now, acting all high and mighty.

Few in this world would care about the weak, but they didn’t like this gloating act from Yibin either.

During any other day, someone like him was only a minor character, insignificant in the grand scheme of thing. Such arrogance and bossiness earned him the resentment of the crowd.

Of course, the spectators didn’t feel like speaking, let alone helping the king.

Yibin himself might not be a genius, but he was still a member of the Zeng Clan, the grandchild of Ma Mingchun. That’s an impressive background.

Plus, the king was only a dog without a master right now. Who would want to interfere for his sake?

After receiving Yibin’s order, the muscular men behind him surrounded Li Qiye with eyes full of aggression.

They were part of the army and wouldn’t show any mercy the moment Yibin gives them the go-ahead.

“Your Majesty, will you break your legs yourself or do we have to help you?” One of the men smiled and asked.

The scene became quite tense; all spectators held their breath due to the excitement.

Suddenly, loud exhales disrupted the ongoing situation. Yeng Yibin and his men all turned around.

They saw an old man sitting on a boulder nearby with a wood cutter hanging by his waist and a bundle of firewood beneath. He sat on a boulder and enjoyed his smoke.

No one knew when he got there; it was as if he had been there the entire time but no one noticed his existence.

He puffed out a ring of smoke and noticed everyone looking at him. He tapped his pipe to get the ashes out and coughed: “Excuse me, I’m at the wrong place, continue on.”

No one had a clue who he was. Yibin ignored this and ordered: “Start.”

He had no other choice and delaying this matter might create further problems.

“Your Majesty, don’t blame us for being merciless. Blame yourself for being blind.” One man smiled grimly.

Four of the group exchanged glances before shouting: “Let’s go!”

They reached for Li Qiye, each aiming for a different arm and leg - wanting to raise him in the air.

This didn’t look like a simple bone-breaking move, more like dismemberment via running horses.

“Clank!” Suddenly, a snow-white flash appeared.

“Pluff! Pluff! Pluff!” The shade of red emerged.

“Oh no, my wood cutter.” Everyone, still confused, heard the old man shouting and saw him holding his waist.

However, the wood cutter was nowhere to be seen. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In this split second, there was a sharp white blade flying in the air. It severed the arms of the four men from the shoulder down, as easily as cutting tofu.

“Ah!” The men finally realized what had happened after seeing blood gushing out from the wounds and screamed.

This wood cutter hovered in the sky and blood dripped down from its tip, one drop at a time. No one was controlling it; it seemed to have its own mind and moved on its own volition.

“Come back, I need you to stay alive!” The old man anxiously shouted again.

Everyone immediately thought that he was putting up an act.

“Old man, you’re courting death!” The other men immediately turned towards him with a shocked expression.

“Clank!” They took out their saber and sword before lunging for him like tigers and wolves.

“It has nothing to do with me, you got it wrong!” The frightened old man waved his hands in denial.

However, these men wouldn’t listen to him. The wind-cutting howls of their lightning-fast slashes came straight for his neck.

They wouldn’t give the enemy a chance to retaliate at all, not caring who the old man actually was.

“Whoosh!” The hovering cutter suddenly flashed and came for them.

“Watch it!” The men noticed this and turned their blades upward.

“Bang! Bang!” Their sabers and swords crumbled with pieces flying everywhere. Blood came next.

The knife cutter dashed through the air, creating a beautiful white arc before slashing down. More arms dropped to the ground. All became armless men, unable to resist at all.

Their weapons were crushed and gone were their arms.

“Ah!” They let out miserable and heart-wrenching scream.

The spectators were alarmed after seeing the one-sided battle.

“It’s a master.” Everyone could see that the old man was a hidden master.

“Run!” After the initial jolt of pain, the men realized that they needed to ignore the pain and retreat as fast as possible.

“Pluff!” The cutter flew up in the air before descending once more, decapitating the escaping victims.

These poor, headless victims still ran for a while longer without a head. When their head dropped down and rolled on the ground, they could see their body falling to the ground with blood gushing out. They opened their mouth, wanting to scream but no sound would come out. Their blood on the ground flowed together and formed thick streams.

The spectators watched in a daze, shuddering.

The imperious Yibin was frozen. His men were all experts that have survived numerous battlefields. None of them was weak but they were instantly murdered by this old man. The guy’s power was insane.

“Shit!” His wits returned and he decided to run for that was the only option.

Honor, reputation, face? None of them mattered. Nothing was more important than staying alive so he mustered all of his strength to flee.

Unfortunately, the blood-stained cutter unleashed another vertical slash.

“Thump!” Yibin didn’t make it far before his legs got cut off. He immediately rolled on the ground.

“Ah!” Once he stopped rolling, he finally noticed that his legs were missing. The pain and realization made him scream.

“Shit!” The pale youth used his arms to crawl instead, leaving behind two trails of blood.
