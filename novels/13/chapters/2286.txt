Gurgling creeks populated this mysterious area with a tree next to a bigger river. It was quite old with many branches falling down and floating downstream.

Wutong Phoenix Tree - its branches were naturally the famous Alchemy Wood that would eventually go down the waterfalls and into the lake.

Li Qiye meditated beneath the tree while opening his fate palace. His primordial tree became dazzling while the dao fruit swayed with the wind. Its movement filled with the dao forced the myriad worlds to shake along.

The wutong tree poured down a green light filled with life onto the primordial tree, making it even more beautiful.

But this wasn’t a one-sided affair. Li Qiye’s tree exuded a primordial energy to open a pristine world for the wutong tree, granting it all the necessary nutrients and fertilizers. The wutong tree seemingly grew younger by a significant amount.

The dao fruit continued to mature, almost ripe enough to fall to the ground. When it touched the ground, it wouldn’t be strange if a million more new dao come into being. If this were the case, it would be a magnificent scene with many new worlds coming into fruition. Of course, this dao fruit would never fall since it was eternal.

On a different verdant branch close to the tip, a tiny sprout was forming as if another dao flower would come out. This would be the second dao fruit. Alas, the time wasn’t right. This process would be quite smooth and herald an unprecedented transformation.

Who knows how long Li Qiye has been sitting there? He eventually opened his eyes after a long while.

He spread out his hand with an action like turning a knob, seemingly wanting to open space.

“Buzz.” After he turned far enough, a door indeed appeared.

One person came in with her daoist robe fluttering - Longevity Sage. The door disappeared afterward.

She became emotional while standing before the wutong tree: “The legend is true, our progenitor did leave something amazing behind on Herb-plucking. All the ancestors wanted this tree but none were successful.”

In the last few days, the sage was busy with stabilizing the system. She knew Li Qiye hasn’t left so she decided to climb up this mountain to wait for him. In the end, he opened this portal for her.

“It’s because all of you have desires.” Li Qiye leisurely said: “Occasionally, it’s not about what you can gain from it, but what you can do for it. This is the foundation of a sect, built from the accumulation across many generations. If you all want to benefit from it, then even more resources would eventually be depleted. Your progenitor was quite smart, not leaving everything to the valley but spreading it out across the system so that it won’t run out.”

“True...” The sage nodded. Their valley once had True Emperors planning about Herb-plucking. Some of these sages believed in the legends of the tree and wanted to bring the whole place back to the valley.

After all, Alchemy Hut belonged to everyone so there were things outside of their control. This wouldn’t happen if they were to move it back to the valley.

Unfortunately, in spite of their immense power, these ancestors couldn’t find the mysteries of what Alchemy Immortal left behind, let alone finding methods of bringing the tree back here.

“Is it withering?” She noticed signs of withering such as a lack of branches and leaves.

“Right.” Li Qiye nodded: “It has lived for far too long so it’s about that time to die of old age. Of course, it’ll still last a long time compared to cultivators even in this state.”

“Is it salvageable? We have a lot of medicines and materials, maybe they can save it.” She asked.

She was a master alchemist and her sect specialized in longevity. Perhaps they could save the tree due to their great experience.

“Good question.” Li Qiye said: “As I have said, think about what you can do for it. When the opportunity arrives, saving it is not impossible.”

“What should we do?” She humbly asked.

“You all should come up with the answer, not me.” He sat there and shook his head.

The sage only sighed and could only leave it up to fate, true to her favorite quote. If it wasn’t meant to be, trying was only a waste of time.

The sage coolly sat down next to him, hands on knees while resting her head on top and looking at Li Qiye.

“Not bad acting.” Li Qiye stretched and chuckled: “Everlasting, those fools thought their plan had succeeded.”

“It’s not acting.” She chuckled: “I was truly wounded, it is thanks to you that things unraveled in this manner. We simply went along with the flow.”

“It’s fine, it is my responsibility after accepting the role of First Disciple. But I wonder if you all are ready, it is time for the payment.” Li Qiye looked at her and said.

She sighed and knew that there was no free lunch in this world. The guy didn’t care for this position.

“What do you want?” Since she was here, she was well-prepared for whatever absurd demand he wanted. After all, this was a twist of fate for their sect, and it was time to pay up.

“I want the Longevity Root.” Li Qiye calmly said.

“Impossible! We can’t do that.” She instantly jumped up in astonishment!

“Nothing is impossible.” Li Qiye nonchalantly replied.

She couldn’t maintain her perpetual calmness. Her expression kept on changing as she stared at him. In the end, she shook her head: “You surely know how important this root is to us!”

“No, it is only a medicinal root to your sect, you all can’t comprehend and figure out its profundity, it won’t grant you immortality and indestructibility.” Li Qiye elaborated: “You are only wasting it by plucking some leaves to refine nonsensical pills!”

“But it is also our symbol, our defining treasure personally planted by the progenitor. It carries great significance.” She said seriously.

“I know, but so what? It is in essence just a medicinal plant for your sect, but that won’t be the case in my possession.” He shook his head: “It won’t be a Longevity Root there, just a simple plant.”

“If you change your demand, anything is negotiable.” She didn’t know what to do.

Despite being prepared for an outrageous demand, she still didn’t expect for him to ask for their defining treasure. This particular plant was too precious for them.

As he said, it couldn’t grant immortality to their ancestors but something personally cultivated by their progenitor must have an amazing secret behind it. Moreover, the pills refined from its leaves were no joke.

“It is the only thing I want. I don’t care for the rest.” He calmly said.

She felt a bit breathless after hearing this. She thought for a bit before giving a serious answer: “I can’t decide this matter on my own, not the ancestors either. One can even say that no one can because in a certain sense, the root can only change master with the destruction of the valley.”

“I’m aware, that’s why I’m talking to you right now. If I were an unreasonable person, I would have taken it already. You think your sect is capable of stopping me?” He flatly said.
