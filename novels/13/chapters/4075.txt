Chapter 4076: Hundred-blade Noble

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The members of the army found Li Qiye’s arrogant attitude unforgivable. This was nearly the same as him declaring war on Armament Mountain.

However, those who had seen him before didn’t think much of it. He had acted in this manner towards Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom before.

The prince took a deep breath to calm down before glaring at Li Qiye: “Do you know the consequences of your crime?”

“Don’t know and don’t care.” Li Qiye waved his hand and smiled: “But, I’ll kindly remind you of the consequences for trespassing here.”

Spectators thought that Li Qiye had no intention of de-escalating the situation.

“Does he not mind going to war against Armament Mountain?” Someone from another sect murmured.

“Whatever, it’ll be a fun show for us, the richest in the world versus Armament Mountain.” Another couldn’t wait.

“Well, this is Armament Mountain’s territory, is money that useful?” One more uttered coldly.

The excited crowd made it difficult for the prince. He led this army here in order to demand an answer for their dead disciples on top of re-seizing their prestige.

Now, Li Qiye refused to give them face in public, leaving him with tough choices.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

If he didn’t teach Li Qiye a lesson, it would ruin both his and his sect’s reputation. How could he lead Armament Mountain if he failed to take care of one man?

“Your Highness, no need to waste breath on someone like him, let’s teach him a lesson!” A member of Armament shouted.

“Yes, Your Highness, just say the word and we’ll capture him!”

The majority of Armament Mountain’s members here were from God Ape Kingdom. They didn’t appreciate Li Qiye’s attitude towards their prince.

The livid prince glared at Li Qiye and threatened: “This plain might be yours but it is still under our jurisdiction. Therefore, we have the authority to regulate it. Your insistence on being stubborn is nothing but suicidal.”

“The plain has nothing to do with Armament Mountain, it is mine now. Alright, go back since I’ll be nice and won’t hold your ignorance against you. Stop disturbing my peace or I’ll kill you all.” Li Qiye replied.

“Li, stop being an idiot! Hand over the plain and apologize right now before it’s too late!” The prince furiously shouted.

The prince would rather believe in the existence of the treasury than otherwise. Taking it back was playing it safe due to the sudden changes here.

If they were to find something, that would be a great contribution to the sect.

“You’re finally revealing your tail.” Li Qiye smiled: “All of this only to take the plain back. That’s fine, I’m a generous man. Pay me ten billion and you can have it back.”

The crowd exchanged glances after hearing the demand.

“You might as well rob us!” The prince trembled with anger. Li Qiye bought it for one hundred million and now, he wanted ten billion for it?

“It’s just business.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said: “Plus, I’m not asking for dao lord jades either, this is just a tiny sum. Sigh, it sucks dealing with poor plebs. Stop daydreaming and wasting my time. Know your place.”

The members of Armament nearly vomited blood and gritted their teeth after hearing this. Their sect was famous for its power and resources. They took pride in having all the advantages from being a part of this sect. Thus, they didn’t appreciate being called “poor plebs”.

Some of the neutral spectators were left speechless. Only Li Qiye would consider ten billion, albeit not dao lord level, a small amount. Alas, he had the wealth to back it up.

“Li, I guess you want it the hard way. Don’t blame us for cutting you to pieces!” The prince uttered coldly.

“No, that’s showing too much mercy towards a scum like him.” A calm voice interjected.

People turned around and saw two youths walking together. Both had an impressive aura.

One was a familiar character - Starshooter Prince who was taught a lesson by Li Qiye not long ago.

The other was also a member of Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom. He wore an expensive robe and looked quite spirited.

Sword energies surrounded him even though there were no physical swords in sight. Just these sharp rays alone could take down his enemies.

“Hundred-blade Noble.” Someone shouted his title.

He was actually from Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom while Starshooter Prince was only a member of a tributary.

Nonetheless, Starshooter Prince was still considered as part of the main branch just like Hundred-blade Noble. It’s just that the noble had more advantages and a higher status than the prince.

For example, he was a direct disciple of an elder there on top of cultivating a dao lord merit law - Reversion Sword Art.

“Another sword prodigy.” Someone else said.

There were three members of the Ten Sword Prodigies and one Weapon Hero present. This was an impressive and rare gathering at the plain.

“Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom can’t let go either.” Another murmured.

Everyone knew about the feud between Li Qiye and Sea Emperor. Starshooter Prince causing trouble was one thing. However, Hundred-blade Noble’s presence had a great significance.

The former couldn’t represent Sea Emperor while the young noble could due to his background.

“Everyone has the responsibility to get rid of villains.” Starshooter Prince glared at Li Qiye and declared.
