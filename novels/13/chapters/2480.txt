The old man smiled wryly after hearing this and had to reveal his intention: “I do have a tiny request, Your Majesty. When you do take action, please go easy on us. Nine-linked Mountains is just a small place that can’t handle your invincibility. If the mountains were to be destroyed in the process, our disciples will be forced to leave their homes and wander about.”

“This place is small, huh?” Li Qiye gently shook his head: “Vast is the right word, and it has taken the most fertile part of Nine Secrets too.”

“That’s only for regular people.” The old man replied: “For someone such as yourself, Your Majesty, this is a tiny, barren wasteland, not worth mentioning. It can’t handle your full power. If you don’t care about the disciples here, please think about the citizens of the system, just go a little easy and spare us. Otherwise, one punch of yours might penetrate the system completely, signaling its end.”

The old man wasn’t exaggerating. An existence that was, at the very least, an immortal progenitor was a monster. Destroying a system was no problem, perhaps with a single strike.

“I suppose I can’t refuse after you put it this way.” Li Qiye smiled: “Don’t worry, your Nine-linked Mountains will be just fine, it won’t lose an arm or a leg or anything else. I’m a merciful person who always cares for the people.”

“I thank you on behalf of everyone, Your Majesty.” The old man stood up and cupped his fist towards Li Qiye.

Meanwhile, Liu Chuqing sat next to Li Qiye without uttering a word.

“Oh right, how about giving me the plaque at your sect’s entrance?” Li Qiye casually brought this up.

The old man didn’t know how to answer. He awkwardly coughed before replying: “Your Majesty, it’s embarrassing but I can’t make that decision since it was left behind by the great forefather.”

“Is that so?” Li Qiye continued with a smile: “I personally don’t care for most items in the world since they’re worthless, but I like this silly girl. If you wish to pay respects to me, I think it’s about time for a greeting present.”

The man smiled wryly: “Well, I’m afraid that anything I can take out can’t get into your sight. The regular items in this world aren’t worthy as presents to a celestial like The Lady.”

Chuqing became embarrassed again and looked down on the ground, still not used to this particular address.

“Then hand over the nine secrets.” Li Qiye nonchalantly demanded.

She was stunned to hear this. The nine secrets were priceless and no one could gather all of them. Li Qiye spoke as if he was asking the old man to hand over some cabbages.

“Your Majesty, you are messing with me. I’ve only fixed a few things, it’s easier said than done to gather all nine, let alone reaching grand completion.”

“But your Qian is at grand completion.” Li Qiye replied.

“Nothing can hide from your eyes, Your Majesty.” The old man sighed and said: “The truth is that this is the accomplishment after a lifetime of effort. I am slow and inept, probably won’t be able to finish all nine. As far as I know, True Emperor Jiu Ning is the only person who has done so.”

“She has done so successfully, just like the rumors?” Chuqing became curious.

“Yes, as far as I know, My Lady.” The woodcutter nodded: “She studied both Jie and Lie in Calm Lotus, Dou and Zhe at War Saint, and the rest in Nine-linked Mountains, but that’s just starting on all nine. She had a long way to go before reaching perfection for all nine. Who knows what comes of it since she left for Immortal Lineage.” He stared at a particular location in a daze after revealing this.

“I thought Emperor Zheng had also done it.” She asked.

The woodcutter replied: “That’s not the case. The emperor didn’t train in all of them but he definitely could have, given his amazing talents. Maybe it was because of his talents that he opened a new path, resulting in the supreme manual - Lucidity Scripture. This allowed him to jump out of the Nine Secrets System’s boundary.”

“I see. So True Emperor Jiu Ning is the only person after the progenitor.” She murmured to herself.

“That’s true till now, but who knows about the future?” The old man nodded before glancing over at Li Qiye.

“Just the nine secrets, I’m not that interested in them. However, the underground parts or the item beneath this lake, that’s another story.” Li Qiye said.

“You’re joking, Your Majesty!” The woodcutter’s expression changed after hearing this.

“I am not.” Li Qiye calmly said, clearly revealing his stance.

“Your Majesty, please, please leave behind a little bit for our sect.” The woodcutter had a pained expression, virtually begging.

Despite Li Qiye’s nonchalant looks, he could see that the guy was serious. The consequence would be unimaginable and no one could say otherwise.

“I’m already leaving things behind for the sect. Otherwise, I would refine this place and take it as my own.” Li Qiye smiled.

The man knew that Li Qiye was telling the truth. If Li Qiye wanted to, he could refine the entire system, not just Nine-linked.

“Your Majesty, our sect is very barren already.” He kept on trying.

“How about my silly girl right here?” Li Qiye ignored the crying old man and gently stroke Chuqing’s hair. One could see the clear adoration on his face.

“The Lady is a priceless gem yet to be polished with the constitution of a heavenly being.” The old man praised.

Chuqing couldn’t handle the flowery praises: “Senior, you’re too kind.”

“I am not exaggerating.” He explained: “There are plenty of dragons and phoenixes in this world, but few can actually enter His Majesty’s sight yet you can. That’s a testament to you being special, My Lady.”

He wasn’t just flattering the girl. He knew that to earn the grace of a character like Li Qiye was a great fortune, exceedingly rare as well. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Beautiful girls have been viewed as ants by him in the past, such as Qin Jianyao. Liu Chuqing, on the other hand, had a higher standing in his eyes.

Li Qiye said: “Life is a game of chess. Some people believe that they’re the chess players, but in reality, I’m the only one playing.”

“Your Majesty, you mean...” Chuqing didn’t understand this random comment. Of course, she was satisfied just being around him and didn’t care for other matters.

“That’s why all of these items will be returned to your sect in the future, with my permission.” Li Qiye said.

“Your Majesty, you have already made up your mind, it’s not like we have a choice.” The old man smiled wryly.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye said: “Work for me and gain great benefits, or I can be more direct and get straight to the result, what do you think?”

“Please don’t, Your majesty. We’ll just obey all your wishes.” The old man became startled and hastily said.

Li Qiye laughed and stroke her hair again: “This world and its people need to thank my silly girl for bringing mercy here.”

“Why?” She asked for clarification.

Li Qiye gently patted her head and said:” Alright, just keep on focus on comprehension.”

She obediently obeyed and sat down cross-legged to enter a state of meditation - becoming one with heaven and earth.

The old man understood what Li Qiye was trying to convey. The guy didn’t care for Nine Secrets or its people.

The girl ahead was the reason for him to show mercy, leaving behind certain things for this system. Otherwise, it would only be another place along the way in his journey. He wouldn’t care about its prosperity and existence.

“My Lady, you are blessed to have earned His Majesty’s grace.” The woodcutter emotionally said.

“No, one makes their own destiny by following the grand dao - treating promises like gold and possessing a peerless dao heart. Everything else is unnecessary.”
