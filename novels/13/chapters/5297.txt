Chapter 5298: Puresun Dao Lord’s Mastery

The gentle dao lord who always spoke with the grace of a scholar now revealed his bulging muscles and arms as thick as a bowl.

He seemed primed to fight anyone including Supreme and Illumination Conqueror. His strong stance surprised the members on the other side.

Since he no longer represented Dao Alliance, the restrictions were gone. In fact, Eight Desolaces Dao might actually be stronger than Azure School, consisting of dao lords originating from Eight Desolaces.

“They are showing their fangs now.” Someone said.

“Dao Alliance shall be one again.” A dao lord from Eight Desolaces commented while observing the situation.

Recently, Dao Alliance had been falling behind compared to its peers. The biggest reason was due to internal conflicts caused by Illumination Conqueror.

Though he created Dao Alliance initially, many high-ranking members eventually had a different view than him.

In reality, this also occurred in Divine Alliance. Many of its members didn’t share the same prejudice toward The People, harboring no wishes of eradicating their enemies. They preferred to live together in harmony.

The belief in harmony spread from Dao Alliance to Divine Alliance before reaching the rest of the land.

Illumination Conqueror maintained his aggressive stance and garnered numerous followers, starting a ferocious war.

Eventually, Puresun Dao Lord and his sword overwhelmed everyone. Illumination Conqueror’s branch weakened, resulting in his abdication and the creation of Azure School.

The same happened in Divine Alliance. The aggressive branch there also lost the war, giving room for negotiation.

Blessed Dao Lord took charge and created a pact with a focus on peace and harmony.

Today, Illumination Conqueror returned, seemingly wanting to finish what he had started. This infuriated Skysword Conqueror enough for him to discard the mantle of Dao Alliance.

“Not like this…” Those who have been used to peace did not appreciate this potential spark of war.

“Things are different now. Principle Conqueror is gone, Illumination Conqueror is back. The warlike branches are rising once more.” An old dragon lord said sentimentally.

“This is precisely what Heaven Alliance wants.” A big shot said.

This power had always been ambitious and had a strong prejudice against the People. Its members considered themselves to be the rulers of the six continents.

The Pact of Blessed and political circumstances after Emperor War restrained their ambition. However, with peace came recuperation and changes.

All the alliances have been able to grow stronger without losses from war. Moreover, prosperity and harmony between the two factions also accelerated growth.

None expected the recent changes in leadership. Although All-things Dao Lord was still in charge of Dao Alliance, Azure School was making a strong return.

“Is the same thing going to happen to Dao Alliance, All-things Dao Lord being forced to abdicate?” A neutral dragon lord worried for the future.

Some big shots who had lived through the wars had no desire of returning to a similar terrible period. Moreover, they would be forced to pick a side, not to mention being treated as cannon-fodders.

“I think we are being too pessimistic. Remember, we have enjoyed peace together for so long, the grudges aren’t as strong as they used to be. Illumination Conqueror won’t have the same pull.” A powerful ancient ancestor commented.

Meanwhile, Skysword Dao Lord revealed another side of him, looking furious and ready to kill Heaven Hammer and the others.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You want a fight?” He looked around and uttered coldly: “Illumination, Supreme, Swordsea, come here then! Let’s fight to the death!”

No one answered him despite the direct challenge. They didn’t wish to be the ones breaking the pact directly.

This maneuver was an attempt to test the water. Furthermore, they understood the seriousness of war and didn’t want to be the ones starting it without an actual justification. As apex cultivators, they still cared about their reputation.

The support for war must increase even more. The top emperors and conquerors must unanimously express their desire of breaking the pact before taking the next step.

Being the one to start the war meant living in infamy. This subdued their desire of taking out the eternal enemies.

Of course, they also understood that following the pact was just an empty formality right now. There was nothing enforcing its rules.

“Fellow Daoist Skysword, we truly appreciate your sincerity, the same for Eight Desolaces Dao.” Immortal Emperor Guan Feng laughed and said: “It is alright though, we shall entertain our uninvited guests. I do find it strange to see Azure School acting as if they are in charge.”
