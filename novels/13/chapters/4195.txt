Chapter 4196: Abandoned By The Sword

Li Qiye had opened a new page in the Physique Scripture previously and created a new grand dao for the next epoch.

The venerable was in awe. So he has been hugging one of the nine scriptures for so long.

“I might as well be blind.” He said: “The jewel couldn’t shine in my possession.”

The nine scriptures contained the ultimate merit laws. People just needed to learn one of them and would become invincible dao lords.

The entire original version was here with him for millions and millions of years yet he gained nothing from it. He started fantasizing about fully learning the complete grand dao within.

Alas, he knew that his comprehension was lacking. It wasn’t meant to be.

Li Qiye glanced at him and said: “Your Soul Devourer is a top sword already with an impressive dao. Once you fuse with it, you’ll gain a lifetime of benefits so no need to worry about the heavenly scripture. What you seek is already in your stomach. Absorb it and the path towards ascension awaits.”

“Right you are, Great Emperor.” The venerable stopped being obsessed with the heavenly scripture and said: “Greed knows no bounds. I’m sure some would want to learn all the paths too after obtaining this.”

Finality Sword had nine paths. Each path would take the user to a supreme sword dao. Alas, cultivating one was immensely difficult, let alone all nine.

Seeking quantity wasn’t always correct. After all, people had limited talent and time. Being too greedy meant knowing many arts in a superficial manner - something inferior to those who focus on a single dao.

Only the supreme geniuses could learn all the different schools. Otherwise, it would only be a waste of time. The venerable was naturally talented. He just couldn’t compare to the greats.

“Great Emperor, do you know how much longer it’ll take for me to melt it?” He asked with anticipation.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Is there anything you still worry about in this world?” Li Qiye asked.

“Well… no. I have no one left.” He pondered before shaking his head. This sounded rather sad but it was the reality for top masters.

His family and friends passed away eras ago. Even his sect has been reduced to ashes. Thus, he was completely alone.

“Then what’s the point of coming out?” Li Qiye said: “The world is still relatively the same, this was the case a billion years ago and will be so a billion years after. You have no worries or obsession, it’s the same staying here or being reclusive somewhere else.”

The venerable agreed with this logic after thinking about it. Before his lifespan ran low, he was living as a hermit in a reclusive mountain, eating simple meals every day. Today, he was also alone in this ocean. The difference was about the same.

“The problem here is anxiety, you worry that you won’t be able to leave this place. It is a mental chain hindering your mind and heart. This, in turn, slows down your dao progression.” Li Qiye continued: “Have you thought about what you would do after leaving this place? You’ll most likely live reclusively again unless you want to see the world or compete with others.”

“Right, there’s nowhere to go outside. Might as well stay here…” The venerable murmured to himself.

A weight was gone after hearing this. Li Qiye was right. So what if he could fuse with the sword’s grand dao? Where would he go afterward? There were no acquaintances or friends to catch up with. He didn’t have any intention of becoming the number one and taking over the world.

He had tried to do so during his youth and prime. This was no longer part of his wish. It seemed that there was no point in leaving this place for him.

“A mind as free as flowing water; a dao as untethered as nature itself.” Li Qiye said: “Let the sword dao melt on its own, no need to be impatient. Your shackles will break eventually.”

“I understand, Great Emperor. Thank you.” The venerable prostrated.

He was trying too hard to break the shackles in the past. This actually slowed down the process and made it harder for him to digest the divine sword and its dao. Now, he realized that time was on his side. This place wasn’t so bad after all.

“I’m finished here.” Li Qiye put away the heavenly scripture and wanted to leave.

“Farewell, Great Emperor. I hope that I’ll be able to contribute to your cause one day.” The venerable bowed.

Li Qiye accepted his gesture with a smile then left.

After Li Qiye was gone, he reflected on the past. He didn’t expect to see an acquaintance after an epoch. Back in Stone Medicine World, he worked for Ye Qingcheng who was killed by Li Qiye. The latter had left the nine worlds yet they managed to meet again in this place. Mulberry fields have turned into blue seas but certain things still remain.

After Li Qiye left the sinkhole, he met others right away - Daoist Peng and Ningzhu’s group.

“Young Noble, I’ve finally found you!” Daoist Peng seemed elated to see him as if he was a savior.

“Why are you here?” Li Qiye glanced at the old man.

“I…” The daoist rubbed his palms together awkwardly while looking at Li Qiye with puppy eyes.

“Daoist Peng lost his sword.” Ningzhu smiled and helped him out.

“Yes.” The daoist nodded repeatedly like a chicken eating grain. He hurriedly added: “It was so strange but my ancestral sword suddenly flew out one day and I couldn’t catch it. I chased after and eventually saw it flying into this place…”

He paused for a bit before continuing: “I-I’m lucky that everyone here decided to help me get to this place, but I’ve lost sight of the sword…”

He saw A’zhi and Tie Jian along the way and they helped him get inside. Otherwise, he would have died long ago.

Unfortunately, this place was massive and he had no idea where to go to look for his sword. This was a thousand times worse than trying to find a needle in a haystack.

He immediately thought about Li Qiye. The guy was magical on top of having numerous followers. Thus, he decided to look for Li Qiye.

Nonetheless, he knew that they had a shallow relationship, only acquaintances at best. Why would Li Qiye help him find the sword in this dangerous place?

Alas, he had no other option, hence the lack of confidence in his voice: “Young-young Noble, if you can find my ancestral sword, I will give you everything I have as payment.”

This didn’t make sense either since he was talking to the world’s richest. A daoist like him could only muster a few coins.

Moreover, mobilizing his legion to find the sword would require untold expenses. He certainly couldn’t afford this.

“I see.” Li Qiye wasn’t surprised by this. He glanced at the daoist and said: “Fine, I’ll help you out since you’ve managed to find me.”

“Thank you, Young Noble!” The daoist bowed deeply after hearing this.
