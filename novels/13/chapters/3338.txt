No mortals could ever survive in Falcon Stream due to the beasts and miasma found here.

Nonetheless, cultivators from Divine Black or their subsidiaries still visited. It was Liu Fuyou’s last stop in this session.

He knew that it was a great place for the children to train. They were fortunate enough to not meet any dangerous creatures and found plenty of valuable medicines.

The most exciting part was when they saw a 500,000-year-old spirit blood ginseng. Using it as medicine could strengthen one’s constitution, cure injuries, and prolong life.

The children were still fortifying their foundation. This ginseng would be able to add more vitality to their core, allowing their cultivation to improve greatly in the future. Fuyou picked the root and planned to refine them for the children later.

Alas, their excitement was cut short.

Two middle-aged men and their disciples stopped them from leaving.

“We found this blood ginseng first, you’re stealing from us.” They surrounded Fuyou’s group.

The two men led a dozen or so disciples, clearly looking like elites. They brimmed with vitality and energy, far stronger than the children from Liu.

Their uniform was a daoist robe, unique in the color scheme - three colors alternating together.

In fact, anyone in this region would recognize them as disciples from Three Truths Sect.

Their progenitor used to be a daoist who hated evil and slain numerous demons. His sect inherited his style, going even more extreme. Thus, they had no love for Divine Black.

A ceasefire only existed between the two sects several decades ago.

Fuyou found their aggression surprising. Falcon Stream was the border. They were standing on Divine Black’s side right now.

He also recognized these two men. They were division leaders of Three Truths, two brothers - Shu Jinqiao and Shu Youyou. They had some fame because they were in the samadhi realm.

“Dao Brother, watch your words. We found this ginseng first.” Fuyou didn’t accept it despite feeling some dread.

The blood ginseng was precious so he didn’t wish to give it up.

“No, I found this root first and went to call the seniors here. Your group came in the middle and stole it like a bunch of thieves.” A First Brother from Three Truths asserted.

He definitely was a gifted cultivator among the young generation. His name was Chen Chen, the first disciple of the chief protector in Three Truths. The sect considered him an important seed to nurture.

The Liu children were furious since they clearly found the ginseng first. They started arguing and unfriendly words resulted in drawn weapons.

The Shu Brothers didn’t try to stop their juniors at all. In fact, they seemed eager to fight.

Fuyou realized that this could go south and immediately sent a distress signal.

The first to come was Huang Jie since he was very close. Other disciples from Thousand Demons and Furious Tiger came running as well, including Huang Ning and Zhan Hu.

Several hundred members of Divine Black eventually showed up in Falcon Stream. They certainly had the number advantage.

However, this might not be the case for actual fighting potential. The other side had two Samadhi cultivators.

Huang Jie was an enlightened being, the same as Fuyou who had reached this level recently. This was the case for Huang Ning and Zhan Hu as well.

Thus, they were still losing despite outnumbering their opponents.

Because the training this time was still in their territory, Divine Black didn’t send out any powerful cultivator. The strongest were only at the enlightened being realm.

“Are you forgetting about our pact? Is this a declaration of war?!” Huang Jie shouted as his group was being pushed back.

The older Shu Jinqiao smiled with a tinge of aggression: “Of course not. It’s just that this blood ginseng belongs to our sect. Moreover, your bunch tried to steal it and will need to apologize.”

“Bullshit!” Fuyou erupted towards the false narrative: “This is our sect’s territory, don’t push it!”

“Liu Fuyou, the jurisdiction of this place is up for debate, our two sects will decide at the next conference. However, we’ll definitely take this ginseng with us today. Try to stop us and see what’ll happen.” Shu Youyou joined in.

“We found this ginseng first, you can’t take it away!” A child from Liu shouted.

“We can and we will just because we’re stronger than you. Reason belongs to whoever has the bigger fist.” Chen Chen snorted and stared at his opponents with contempt.

The members of Divine Black naturally didn’t like this.

“The rightful owner of the ginseng is up for debate but as for the apology? You’ll need to complain to the higher-ups.” Huang Ning said seriously.

“We’ll definitely not apologize unless you have proof to show that Falcon Stream belongs to your sect.” Zhan Hu nodded. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Fine, we’ll just take the ginseng then. Oh, our sect will definitely tell your sect master about this too.” The two brothers exchanged glances before Shu Jinqiao spoke.

“No!” Huang Jie took the initiative: “I patrol the borders and know the territories full well. This place belongs to Divine Black, every tree and blade of grass here belongs to us, the same with this blood ginseng. Don’t even think about it.”

The two brothers’ expression turned cold after hearing this.

Huang Ning and Zhan Hu briefly glanced at each other. Huang Ning quietly said: “Junior Uncle Huang, let’s take one step back and give them the ginseng for now before coming up with a plan.”

“The situation is unfavorable for us, plus, there’s no need to escalate the conflict between the sects.” Zhan Hu agreed.

Everyone from Divine Black stared at these two. Sure, they were definitely weaker right now. However, handing the ginseng over would be too humiliating. Three Truths’ members were at fault and showed nothing but blatant contempt for them right now.

“We can settle this by force if you want. Just know that your side started this so Divine Black is the one breaking the pact, not us.” Shu Youyou snorted.

“Baseless nonsense!” Fuyou shouted with fiery eyes. Three Truths was being ridiculous this time.

During the last war, both sides suffered heavy losses. Divine Black’s top genius, Su Xu, also died in battle.

Despite the peace agreement, Liu Fuyou has never forgotten about this since they were extremely close.
