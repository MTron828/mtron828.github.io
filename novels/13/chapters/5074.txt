Chapter 5075: Instant Invincibility

The dragon sighed and asked something: “Tell me, did you already plan this when you guided us to the ancestral nest?”

The tiger froze after hearing this since he couldn’t have come up with this suspicion.

“Of course not, I can’t plan that long ahead, it was a whole epoch.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“I don’t believe your bullshit.” Even the gentle dragon couldn’t help but curse.

“Dark Crow!! You played us!” The tiger gritted his teeth.

If seemed that Li Qiye had baited them even when they were being suppressed. This was all part of his plan - leading them to the ancestral nest and letting them grow the remnant epoch.

Li Qiye waved his hand and said: “You’re overthinking it. Let’s put it this way, if we hadn't come to an agreement, would you two have reached atavism and become this strong? No, You two would have been dead.”

The two agreed with this logic. If they had refused, they would have been suppressed in the same place all this time. Someone else might have come and destroyed them.

“That’s why you need to maintain an optimistic mindset, don’t be so cynical. It’s rare to find someone as kind as me nowadays.” Li Qiye said.

The two cursed him in their head - if the Dark Crow was kind, then everyone else in the world were saints.

“Okay, I think we’re done talking here. Let’s get started already, everyone got the point and my time is precious.” He stood up and said, walking closer to the maelstrom.

He stared at it with a serious expression. The maelstrom clearly sensed him as well.

Its size was unimaginable. Perhaps the lower continents could only compare to a single particle here.

“Will you submit or do I have to make you?” Li Qiye asked.

The dragon and the tiger got far away. Despite disliking the situation, they understood that this was the best outcome.

Cosmic Ancestral Dragon - this was a beast stronger than true dragons and phoenixes - the only one left of its kind. They incubated the egg and witnessed the entire process, planning to turn this dragon into an epoch lord.

Alas, they had to watch Li Qiye subdue the dragon now and imprint his mantra. This was rather unbearable but this was the only way to survive. At the very least, they would at least get to live freely in Li Qiye’s epoch.

“Come out, I will give you a chance to attack so that you will understand.” Li Qiye said.

Galaxy bubbles emerged from the maelstrom. Each could destroy a continent once bursted.

“Boom!” A large figure slowly came out from the center of the maelstrom - a dragon that could take up an entire cosmo. Its body was made from the stars, everything from the scales to the claws.

This was still a child yet it had enough power to devour the lower continents. It was virtually unbeatable already; one could only imagine an adult version.

Golden Dragon and Tyrant Tiger watched with bated breath, albeit unwillingly.

“Raa!” The child roared and caused extensive damage to the void. Time and space crumbled before the sonic waves.

This thing was strong enough to devour Immortal Emperors and dao lords already. It could appear right now in the immortal continent and be unbeatable.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Boom!” The young dragon immediately unleashed a devastating inferno. A mighty conqueror would still be reduced to ashes in the blink of an eye.

“Not bad.” Li Qiye leaped into the air and used his Heaven Suppression Fist.

“Boom!” The sheer pressure from the punch suppressed Golden Dragon and Tyrant Tiger, forcing them down to the ground. He was the sole lord and didn’t allow a fragmented epoch to challenge his authority.

Even Immortal Emperor Jin She in a different zone felt this power and couldn’t move an inch.

“Already invincible with the first move.” He couldn’t help but praise.
