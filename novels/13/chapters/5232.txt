Chapter 5233: Eternal Farewell

The first two bids didn’t seem to interest Boss Tang enough. This wasn’t to say that they were not valuable. Unfortunately, Boss Tang had seen the greatest of treasures so his standard was unreasonable.

Of course, Li Zhitian and Omniscient Dao might still be holding back because there were still two more auctions afterward.

“I have a particular seed.” Sentinel Treant finally made his move, summoning a celestial seed with endless life force gushing out in waves.

Those in the city felt as if they were looking at one green planet after another, each filled with life and possibilities.

Others couldn’t help taking deep breaths in order to suck in as much life essence as possible. They felt as if they were gaining days of lifespan after inhaling each time.

“A galactic seed?” Boss Tang was surprised after seeing this: “You actually have one?”

“Two, but one has been used.” Sentinel Treant said.

“Not bad at all, if the seed sprouts and survives enough calamities, it will grow into a divine tree.” Boss Tang stared at the seed and couldn’t avert his gaze.

Possessing a divine tree would guarantee the survival of a sect in any era. Thus, everyone became tempted.

After seeing Boss Tang’s interest in the seed, Immortal Emperor Yao Zu had to join the competition. He took out a box and solemnly said: “I have a particular scroll.”

He opened the box and out came a scholarly musk usually found in libraries. This scroll seemed to have been preserved for numerous auras. The smell alone immersed everyone into an ancient dao before even having the chance to read it.

“What is this?” Someone asked after seeing its magical property.

“This is…” Boss Tang stared at the emperor in astonishment.

“It is related to your Dream Immortal Order. I was in the Dream Paradise for a long time and eventually came across this wordless heavenly scroll.”

The other participants focused their gaze, wanting to take a closer look at the scroll.

“A gift from Dream Paradise?” Boss Tang asked with a serious tone.

“Yes, I would not be taking it out if it wasn’t for my withering lifespan.” The emperor responded.

The older cultivators sympathized with him. Priceless treasures were useless when death was knocking on the door.

When they were younger, they risked their lives and spent all their time trying to obtain peerless treasures. As they grew older, they only cared about having more time or in this case, a chance for reincarnation.

Although this ancient scroll was priceless, the emperor had no use for it now.

“Let me take a quick look?” Boss Tang asked, clearly more interested in the scroll than the galactic seed.

“Yes.” The emperor nodded.

Boss Tang came closer and grabbed the scroll. He gently lifted a corner and celestial radiance filled the air, casting an enchanting glow on everyone.

“Is this another immortal-grade item?” The crowd was fully amazed even though the scroll was yet to be opened entirely.

“Incredible.” Boss Tang was a dependable businessman and didn’t look any further. The emperor was already generous enough to allow this before the conclusion of the deal.

“I’ll take it.” Boss Tang made up his mind and agreed.

The emperor was ecstatic to hear this. His hands trembled as he held the plant.

All eyes were on him - the ultimate alchemist still couldn’t reach everlasting life. In the end, reincarnation was the only path.

Older cultivators were stricken emotionally. After all, they would not be as lucky as him to obtain this special plant.

After dominating their entire life, the last moment was one of helplessness. A particular creed of cultivation was to reseize one’s fate from the heaven. Unfortunately, death remained inevitable regardless of their prior confidence.

“Goodbye forever, everyone.” The emperor put away the plant and said.

The participants stood up to properly greet him. His lifespan was over and the plant wasn’t a foolproof solution. Failure meant being reduced to ashes.

He left first and Sentinel Treant who only came for the plant also bid farewell to everyone.

The group heaved a sigh of relief - two fewer competitors now.

“Okay, I don’t need to waste my time introducing the third item - Dream Immortal Order.” Boss Tang said.

The thing seemed to have been buried underground for a long time and could finally see the sun again now.

“It grants entry to Dream Paradise.” An ancient ancestor swallowed his saliva after seeing this.

“Can you really make any request there?” A big shot had heard of this legend previously.

“What if I ask to become a conqueror?” A youth fantasized.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“It depends on your own talent, brat.” A senior responded: “If you are capable, then the paradise will grant you the opportunity.”

“Can I kill my enemies with it?” Another youth asked.

“Idiot, what enemies are worthy of wasting this order on? Plus, are they entering Dream Paradise with you too?” To which someone nearby responded.
