Chapter 5067: Celestial Court’s Unknown Guest

“I’m afraid I can’t be by your side, Sir.” The youth stared at the happy unicorns and said.

Ming Shi had too much fun playing with the unicorns who weren’t afraid of her at all.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye didn’t mind and closed his eyes to enjoy the breeze. The evils of the world couldn’t reach this place.

“This place is peaceful, no need to chase the light either, everything is natural and innate. The dao and power are there without a need for cultivation.” He added.

“You’re right, Sir.” The youth said.

After the war, Immortal Emperor Jin She chose to be a shepherd for the unicorns instead. This was similar to God Ape Dao Lord taking care of the strange worms.

“Some move forward by circumstances, Immortal Emperors and dao lords included. They could have just turned back.” Li Qiye sighed.

“The same can be said about you, Sir, yet you choose to move forward.” The youth said.

“There’s nothing I can do, I am doomed from the start.” Li Qiye joked.

“Your determination is unmatched.” The youth said: “You emphasized the dao heart to us instead of merit laws and techniques. Alas, some of us have let you down.”

“It is expected for this is life.” Li Qiye said: “If the dao were so easy, who would fall into the darkness? Who would pick a life without sunlight?”

“Yes.” The youth nodded.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything else and enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere along with the occasional waves of laughter from Ming Shi and the unicorns.

After a long while, the youth looked up and told Li Qiye: “There’s something you should know, Sir. An unfamiliar guest visited Celestial Court.”

“Oh, interesting.” Li Qiye opened his eyes and said.

“Not much is known during the war, always elusive.” The youth said.

“That’s not the style of the old geezers.” Li Qiye said.

“This person’s existence was spotted by our side but kept a low profile in Celestial Court. We suspected that there was an attempt to settle it all with a single ambush. It didn’t work so a furious darkness came instead and started the war.” The youth said.

Tendril King was surprised to hear this due to some inconsistencies with the records. The most popular stated that darkness suddenly descended during a disaster and Celestial Court came back to illuminate the world. As the savior, it, later on, declared an inquisition against The People. This started the war.

At first, not all members of The People were branded as sinners. Alas, the strong resistance eventually forced Celestial Court to raise the stakes.

Now, it seemed that there was something else going on before these events. Who was bold enough to attack Celestial Court from the inside?

In the present, Celestial Court was absolutely the strongest lineage in all six continents. They were even stronger during their golden age.

“So what happened?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hard to say, this person was never spotted again during the war. It was difficult to find out more information because of Celestial Court’s defenses.” The youth said.

“Looks like a visit is warranted. Maybe some fish will come out to play.” Li Qiye said.

“But if they don’t?” The youth asked.

“That’s where the problem lies, there’s no solution and they will always be looming in the future.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Do you have a plan, Sir?” The youth asked.

“They will have no choice but to come out when the time comes, that’s when I will perform the final clean-up.” Li Qiye smirked.

“And that is when you will embark on your journey?” The youth inquired.

“Whoever started this war did it for a reason. Something must have changed.” Li Qiye said.

“I see…” The youth was familiar with these higher-level theories. This was a big deal when it came from Li Qiye.

“All parties will lose their patience soon, and that is when I can end it.” Li Qiye said.

“I wish nothing but success for your expedition.” The youth said. Though he no longer cared about the outside world, he still wanted the best for Li Qiye.

“I will succeed.” Li Qiye nodded, telling both the youth and himself.

“Back then, the empress eventually showed up to take care of things. That battle resulted in many top masters falling. She disappeared henceforth after leaving Imperial Field behind.” The youth revealed.

“Imperial Field…” Tendril King murmured. This was one of the three strongest lineages in the immortal continent.

Celestial Court was the oldest. Immortal Dao City came after and Imperial Field was established after the war.

“Imperial Field was built on the blood and flesh of emperors.” The youth told her.

She took a deep breath. Future generations didn’t know who started this lineage but now, she finally got an answer from a survivor.

“Celestial Court still wanted it.” Li Qiye said.

“Many Grand Emperors appeared at the same time but the bone was gone. All three lineages couldn’t find it.” The youth nodded.

“So relentless and greed, I suppose dogs don’t stop eating shit.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“This will lead to you, Sir.” The youth said.

“It saves me the trouble, it’s already happening.” Li Qiye nodded.

After listening to their conversation, Tendril King realized that the duel between Conceal and Li Qiye was not personal.

Celestial Court ordered her to obtain the item, and this might be the reason why Conceal Conqueror stuck around in the lower continents.

Given her current cultivation, she should be ascending. After all, the usual limit was four fruits. Alas, she had a mission to accomplish and now, Li Qiye was in possession of her goal.
