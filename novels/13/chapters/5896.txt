Chapter 5896: No Longer Around

“Although you secretly schemed and saved others, you also took their side.” Li Qiye said.

“Sacred Teacher, I am well aware of my sins, not doing enough while being in a position of power.” The founder kneeled.

“What you have done is due to fear and avoidance, I will not be the arbiter for you shall judge yourself. If I had any intention of punishment, you wouldn’t be standing here right now.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand.” He sighed with a dejected expression.

“The dao is to go against the heaven, seeking balance blindly only made you reap the bitter fruits.” Li Qiye continued.

“Fear drove me back then, not intelligence.” He admitted. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“To be fair, don’t be too harsh on yourself. Trinity Ancestor probably didn’t teach you anything and ran off first. Putting aside the lack of responsibility of an epoch lord, he was also an irresponsible teacher for leaving you with such a big mess.” Li Qiye said.

“I dare not ask for more, it was my own lack of ability.” He lamented.

Trinity Ancestor was undoubtedly one of the greatest beings ever to exist. Trinity Epoch enjoyed peace and prosperity during his reign.

Alas, due to his innate gifts, he never made arrangements for his era or plans for himself, always acting on impulse. When he wanted to embark, he left without any preparation.

Handing such a large epoch to his son and disciple was unreasonable. This gave the other overlords more room for growth.

He was too young and couldn’t handle the responsibility. Others didn’t fear him similarly so their ambition ran rampant. Divine Ancestor tried his best and eventually paid the price.

Nevertheless, he never blamed Trinity Ancestor, only himself for being weak and cowardly.

“It’s a pity, Trinity Ancestor looked down on everything and threw a won match.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“You weren’t there for those days, none came close to matching my master.” He smiled wryly.

“I can’t disagree with that.” Li Qiye laughed and said: “All were ants in comparison so he did as he pleased, it’s understandable.”

The formidable Primal and others were only juniors compared to Trinity Ancestor. Such a great being decided to embark on an expedition early.

Unfortunately, he met someone more powerful and monstrous. This shattered his dao heart, causing a fallen form to return.

The founder respected his master the most for he had witnessed Trinity’s prime. Thus, his disappointment was endless after seeing the fallen form.

“Creak.” He opened a heavy gate and the two entered a different dimension. This resembled Ling’er’s buried location, only lacking starlights in comparison.

However, only someone such as Li Qiye could sense its unique property. It was old enough to be traced back to the untraceable times, older than the start of this world.

It once contained the power of the beginning. This affinity had receded like the tides, leaving an empty shell like a dried-up ocean. Only the fossils at the base told the stories of its majestic days.

The two walked over to a platform with a boulder on top. It looked natural and undecorated with runes, completely unpolished as well.

“No longer here.” Li Qiye touched it and let out a sigh.

“My master talked about an unfathomably powerful affinity here, he didn’t know what it was exactly.” The founder said.

“Few know of it.” Li Qiye took out a rune that was taken from Ling’er’s coffin.

The boulder just happened to have an indentation matching the rune.

“Buzz.” The coarse lines on the boulder lit up once they made contact. The whole area lit up with intertwining fiery beams, painting the whole area.

He had no words to describe the magnificent level of this phenomenon. While being inside, one couldn’t see the outside world. Alas, he still felt as if he stood in the center of the universe and worlds could start from within.

He had the illusion that he could create any affinity, whether it be karma or the yin and yang. Of course, this wasn’t reality.

“Not here for sure, most likely fled long ago.” Li Qiye took away the rune and the light disappeared.

“What are you looking for, Sacred Teacher?” He asked.

“Where is this place?” Li Qiye answered with a question.

“Hmm... Celestial Court.” He hesitated for a moment before answering.

“Right.” Li Qiye nodded: “This is Elder Galaxy, the question is, do you think the treasures are the ultimate manifestations?”

“The nine words.” He murmured before staring at Li Qiye to ask: “Are they real?”

The nine words were the origin of the nine treasures. This belief has been passed down for ages now. He didn’t know the source of this belief since it was around long before his birth.
