Chapter 4497: The Fox Exploiting The Tiger’s Might

Among the audience were dominant cultivators. Some of the hidden existences were not necessarily weaker than Skybreak Monarch.

However, they would never call him a nameless junior. This level of disrespect was unprecedented, especially coming from an ordinary junior.

Though he sat in the position of an ancestor, there was nothing special about him. Other ancestors keeping a low profile still looked impressive. Being invincible was a fundamental part of their being regardless of their attempt at converging their aura and energy.

On the other hand, Li Qiye’s cultivation was out in the open. He didn’t try to hide it at all, revealing the fact that he was only slightly stronger than an ordinary disciple.

In a sense, he should be classified as an expert, far from the ancestral level. This was the reason why the crowd was so confused and frustrated by his rampant arrogance.

Turtle-seeker Ancestor was at a loss for words. He stuck his tongue out and then whispered: “Your ancient ancestor seems… a little…”

He didn’t know what to say. The inscrutable youth was actually an ancient ancestor of the four great clans.

“Skybreak Monarch and Three Thousand Dao aren’t easy to deal with, is your ancient ancestor sure about this?” He worried for his old friends because the four clans stood no chance against Three Thousand Dao.

Wise smiled wryly in response. He didn’t know the full extent of Li Qiye’s power but for some reason, he had blind confidence in him.

“Our young noble knows what he is doing.” He answered.

Cloudgrasp Elder couldn’t believe it. He came representing Skybreak Monarch so this was nothing short of a slap to the face. Unfortunately, it didn’t stop here. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After hearing Li Qiye’s answer, Jian Ming became emboldened and declared: “Did you hear that? Just a nameless junior that our young noble has never heard of. I advise you to save yourself from further embarrassment and be smart. Otherwise, his wrath will cause blood to flow for endless miles. Skybreak? Stick to the ground for that is the right choice. Don’t pick hell instead of heaven…”

Others became nauseous while listening to him, wanting to stomp him like a cockroach. Little did they know that he was only telling the truth.

The big shots exchanged glances. If they had a disciple like that, they would be the first to kick him flying. After all, the brat would only create animosity everywhere.

For example, he had just antagonized Three Thousand Dao and Skybreak Monarch, dragging his own sect through the mud.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, seemed amused and didn’t stop it.

“Slap him.” A disciple standing behind the elder furiously shouted. They had great pride in both the monarch and Three Thousand Dao. Thus, this haughty brat’s insult was unforgivable.

“I’m so scared…” Jian Ming laughed and walked back behind Li Qiye.

Wise Ancestor coughed to remind everyone of his presence. The disciples behind the elder stopped being so aggressive since there was an ancestor around. They could think nothing of Jian Ming but an ancestor was a different story.

“Brat, your tongue is quite sharp.” Cloudgrasp Elder became murderous. Alas, he didn’t want to fight Wise Ancestor so he calmed down.

“Just Lotus’ matter alone is already unforgivable. Looks like you all are tired of living.” He coldly uttered.

He was aware of Lotus Young Noble’s death. Alas, he didn’t plan on avenging the youth.

First, the boy was Elder Mu’s disciple and had nothing to do with him. Second, his goal was to bid on a treasure for Skybreak Monarch. This was not the time for escalation. Therefore, he exercised restraint and didn’t attack the brat.

Failure in obtaining the treasure would make it hard for him to answer to the monarch once he returned.

“What am I ever going to do…” Jian Ming taunted.

The daoist suddenly joined in as well: “Cloudgrasp Elder, I see black lines between the brows for you, this is an ominous sign. If you don’t eliminate this phenomenon, you won’t live for much longer.”
