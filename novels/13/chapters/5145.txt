Chapter 5146: Superior To Blessed and Puresun

It was unfathomable to see two strangers sitting in the Lu’s ancestral ground. More importantly, today was a grand dao day that would only happen once every ten thousand years.

Only the strongest members of the clans were allowed to witness this phenomenon. This was because regular cultivators and young geniuses didn’t have the ability to withstand it. Observing recklessly could result in qi deviation or death.

Dragon lords and conquerors had enough mental fortitude to observe the mysteries of the dao found this place.

Alas, the best spot was already taken by Li Qiye and Jun Landu. This was absurd because dao enlightenment should be silent and ceremonious. In this case, they were just drinking and grilling.

Thus, when ancient ancestors came and saw this scene, they became livid. Dragon lords and conquerors were left speechless.

Their clan was prestigious and had an influential position in Divine Alliance. The sky changed color due to their wrath.

These men dared to take up the best spot and even partied here? They must be tired of living.

“Let’s see who the hell they are.” A conqueror’s eyes activated the yin and yang.

However, a massive palm appeared in the sky and blocked their path, not allowing them to initiate their attack.

“Enough.” An old man emerged afterward.

“Ancestor.” The conquerors and ancient ancestors stopped and respectfully greeted him.

“Ancestor, do you know who they are?” One conqueror asked since they were not allowed to come any closer.

The old man’s eyes became profound as he stared at the cliff, wanting to pierce through time itself in order to find traces of the two men.

“No, but they’re extraordinary.” He eventually concluded.

“How many in this world are stronger than you, Ancestor?” A dragon lord didn’t buy it.

After all, their clan had four conquerors and numerous dragon lords. They could challenge any individual sect, not counting the alliances. Most importantly, their ancestor could fight against the strongest conquerors in the upper continents right now.

“There is always a higher mountain and a greater man.” The old man said: “We all know that our continents aren’t the strongest, there are emperors and conquerors in the immortal continent that have achieved anima.”

The others didn’t say anything because the ones with anima were indeed superior.

“How do they compare to Supreme, All-things? And Sword Queen?” One conqueror became curious.

“Most likely stronger.” The old man said while gazing at Li Qiye and Jun Landu.

The group became emotional since they mentioned the current leaders of the alliances.

“So they have obtained anima.” One conqueror murmured.

The clan had four conquerors but none have been able to reach the truth to obtain anima. Obtaining twelve dao fruits was just the first milestone of their path.

After the twelve fruits, it became about crafting an immortal physique - one capable of crafting and reaching the anima. With anima came the qualification to talk about immortality.

Alas, no one has reached this level yet. Not even Celestial Court and Immortal Dao City had an immortal.

“How about the likes of Luminous, Heaven Burial, Blessed, and Puresun?” By this point, anger was replaced by curiosity.

The titles that were brought up belonged to the strongest beings of all six continents.

“I don’t know, I cannot see through one of them, I don’t think I’ve met him before.” The old man shook his head.

“You cannot analyze him, Ancestor? But you have seen Blessed and Puresun before.” The conquerors and dragon lords couldn’t believe it.

Fire appeared in his eyes as he gazed at Li Qiye: “I see nothing, I’m afraid he is above them too.”

“Impossible!” The juniors were overwhelmed by this speculation.

“Not even Blessed and Puresun, then who?” One conqueror blurted out.

“How about Jiao Heng and Purewood?” Another said.

“I don’t think we have a good analysis of those ancient beings.” A dragon lord said. Purewood Divine Emperor has not shown himself after Skysplitter.

“What about Empress?” A conqueror thought about someone more recent.

“Empress is definitely unbeatable.” A peer took a deep breath and said.

When the great empress appeared, she defeated all her foes and created Imperial Field - a behemoth on the same level as Celestial Court and Immortal Dao City.

“That I do not know since I have not seen Empress.” The old man shook his head.

With that, he went back to focusing on analyzing Li Qiye: “What an indescribable air.”

“What do you mean, Ancestor?” A junior asked because he hasn’t seen this expression from the ancestor yet.

“So close to the heaven, my imagination cannot fathom his very existence.” The ancestor pondered for a moment before answering.

The group glanced up at the sky and didn’t know what to say. Despite being conquerors, heaven was still an abstract concept, far out of their reach.

“I’ve seen someone with a similar presence before.” The ancestor said.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Who?” The juniors blurted out.

“I can’t be sure, I might just be seeing things.” He shook his head and didn’t elaborate.

Nonetheless, this confirmed that this intruder was a monster.

“How come we haven’t seen him before?” A dragon lord asked.

It was one thing for them to be lacking information. However, their ancestor had lived for a very long time now.
