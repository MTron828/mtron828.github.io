Few disciples from the ridge ever roamed the world, hence the surprise to see these experts around.

“Elder Shi.” Wu Zhongtian showed respect towards the old man by bowing and cupping his fist. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The latter responded with a slight nod.

An ancestor found the prior comment very interesting and asked respectfully: “Elder Shi, Fire Domain is truly the home of a phoenix?”

The old man stared deeper into the domain; his eyes moved slightly. “According to the legend, there was indeed a phoenix there. It roamed across the realms and eventually settled in an ancestral vein. It gathered sacred woods and an ultimate immortal spark in order to have rebirth...”

“A phoenix rebirth...” People took a deep breath.

“They really exist?” People were skeptical because divine beasts belonged in myths such as phoenixes and true dragons. Some dragon types might be called true dragons but they weren’t the same thing.

No one has seen a true divine beast before so they didn’t believe in this rebirth story. The old man didn’t elaborate either.

People shifted their attention towards the first prince again. This country should have more records regarding Fire Domain due to its founder.

The prince didn’t say anything while slightly raising his brows. The records were there, just not the reason why their patriarch came here.

“Let me give it a shot.” An ancestor from Yin Yang took one step forward and used his treasure for protection.

It poured down dao laws that coiled around him, culminating in an armor issuing dragon and tiger roars. This blessed him with a bestial power.

“So strong!” The spectators gasped in awe.

He took one step forward and entered Fire Domain, soaring through the sky like a dragon. It didn’t take long before he got near the peak with the dao platform due to his speed.

Thick steam suddenly built up around him. His strength and treasure still couldn’t last for long before the heat.

“Shit!” He roared and flew backward with haste. He managed to get out but there were blisters all over, causing him to scream in pain. His peers applied ointments on the spot and stabilized his wounds.

The crowd took a deep breath. Even a mighty Yin Yang ancestor couldn’t handle this heat. Others had zero chance.

“What should we do?” The trio of geniuses found this unsolvable.

Everyone spent so much effort and time to get here, only to be blocked by Fire Domain. They could only stare and sigh at the imperial treasury.

“People from Divine Stone Ridge are going.” A spectator quietly said.

The old men from there entered the domain. They weren’t fast and chose an indirect path, unlike the others.

The latter wanted to pick the shortest path for flying. These old men walked several steps west then east; one would mistake them for drunkards.

“Why are they okay?” The spectators didn’t understand why this group managed to stay in the domain for so long without being melted.

“Are they not afraid of the heat? How strange, a special treasure, maybe?” They discussed the event.

After walking for a while, the old men stared at the dao platform and shook their head.

They stopped at the foot and dug out a burnt branch around a hundred feet tall. An immortal hymn came after it emerged from the ground, sounding like a phoenix screeching.

“The mythical phoenix roost tree?” Everyone became startled.

While everyone was still surprised, the group decided to leave the domain.

“The treasury of the emperor is meant for the fateful ones. It is not us.” One of them left behind this cryptic line before leaving.

People stared at them, perplexed. They clearly made it inside but chose against entering the portal for the treasury.

“That branch alone is more than enough.” Someone murmured.

One smart cultivator entered the domain and copied the zigzag pattern seen earlier. However, he only remembered the first part and started feeling the heat later on.

“There are shortcuts here.” The crowd came to this realization and entered unharmed.

One made it to a hill and dug the ground to find many precious fire jewels.

Others also excavated the ground. The place became lively with varying results - either finding nothing or huge gains.

Alas, they only remembered a short path so they were limited to the treasures there. Nonetheless, this was still enough for them to dig the entire day.

On the other hand, the big three had no interest in these treasures. They mobilized their armies and formation for the imperial treasury only.

“What about building a bridge?” An extremely pleasant voice sounded as they were stuck.

A phoenix carriage emerged on the horizon, looking as noble as can be. It was embedded with royal jades and had a phoenix emblem. Four jade birds pulled it forward.

A woman in a phoenix dress sat on it, looking beautiful, elegant, and dignified. People couldn’t help lowering their head in her presence, unable to look straight ahead.

“Skylight Princess.” Many recognized her.

“Sister.” The first prince came over to see her right away.

“Your Highness.” Others bowed towards her.

She commanded everyone’s attention the moment she got here - the jewel of Skylight, one of the north’s three beauties, and Bai Jianchan’s fiancee.

Both she and Ancestral City’s Pearlstone Saintess we betrothed to Bai Jianchan. However, she was more popular.

She had cultivation achievements as well, being one of the strongest geniuses. Not only was she loved in her country, but Yin Yang Gate also adored her.

Wu Zhongtian hurriedly came over as well to greet her.

“I’m here to offer my assistance.” The princess said: “I have obtained a dao lord treasure in order to make it through this arduous place.”

The crowd became shaken. It seemed that they must obtain this treasury at all cost.
