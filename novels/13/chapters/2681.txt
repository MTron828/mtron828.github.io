All eyes were on the Mu, wanting to see what the daoist and emperor can conjure up when things have escalated to this point.

Anyone could see that they have fallen into a pit of despair. Their strongest moves still couldn’t stop Li Qiye while he took them down with one move as well.

Thus, everyone believed that the tide couldn’t be turned regardless of their methods. Fiercest has reached the progenitor level, and a high-level one at that - at the very least the imperial level.

On the other hand, the daoist was only a new Everlasting, barely able to fight against a progenitor at the myriad level at best.

Puresword True Emperor had weaker cultivation. Even with the Mu’s full resources and its inhabitants’ dao offering, he was still too weak to fight against a progenitor.

Supreme weapons and heaven-defying methods from those two wouldn’t amount to anything before Fiercest’s absolute might. This was as clear as day.

“Buzz.” The dao source in the depths of the clan lit up again and illuminated the system. The whole place looked like a gigantic diamond now.

“Fusion!” The emperor shouted while standing in the dao source.

The progenitorial laws embedded in him suddenly melted back into runes. The thirty-six elder ancestors glanced at each other before gritting their teeth.

“Buzz.” They became resplendent with crimson rays coming out, almost like the reflection from numerous rubies.

“Pop!” They suddenly exploded into blood mists and caught the crowd off guard.

“What the hell?!” The spectators became startled.

These ancestors were considered the pillars of the Mu so their death was a big loss.

“Whoosh!” The bloody mists started glowing. Tiny and exquisite laws emerged with a primal aura and started heading for the emperor, slowly fusing into his body.

“Clank!” Primal laws in the shape of chains appeared around him.

He slowly sank into the dao source and gradually became one with it. True dao water, progenitorial power, and numerous laws joined with him. The entire dao source was directly fusing with him. His body became gigantic once more because it was absorbing the dao source.

“Rumble!” This lasted a while until cracks appeared all over his body. The primal laws around him broke at the same time, unable to handle the influx of power.

“Boom!” His vitality soared at a rapid rate and the primal laws connected together again in order to keep his body intact.

“That’s insane. He’s using his body to take in the entire dao source. The thirty-six elder ancestors sacrificed themselves to help him.” Everyone understood his intent now.

Remember, the dao source was the foundation of a system. It contained an unreasonable amount of power. No one but progenitors could handle this sudden boost of taking in a dao source.

Even though the emperor was a vessel for the dao right now, it was still impossible for him to take in this dao source without exploding to pieces. That’s why the previous ancestors used their vitality and purest primal laws to protect him, hoping that he could handle this process.

“This is indeed insane, but the clan and the emperor have no other choice. If they can’t do something to stop Fiercest, they’ll die anyway.” One Eternal said.

People agreed with this logic. The clan was facing destruction so they had no choice but to resort to extreme measures.

“Rumble!” As he took in more dao source, he grew bigger and the primal laws around him shattered and reconnected multiple times.

Though he sent his vitality into the chains to aid them, they were becoming ineffective. The collapsing speed exceeded the recovery rate so cracks started appearing on him again.

“Boom!” Finally, the laws collapsed and he broke down like a porcelain vase.

“You must persevere!” The daoist shouted and instantly moved behind the emperor.

“Fusion!” His body immediately blended together with the emperor. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A massive shockwave swept through the world as the daoist showed off the power of the Everlasting level. Their vitality fused together and the daoist began fusing with the dao source as well.

This shouldn’t be possible because the daoist wasn’t a member of the Mu System and didn’t cultivate its merit laws.

However, when the emperor agreed to fuse with him in this manner, the former also gave him permission to join the fusing process.

“Boom!” With the daoist’s help, the emperor’s vitality erupted all the way to the sky and became nearly infinite, augmenting his physical constitution.

“Clank!” The primal laws finally connected again to seal his body. They became thicker and had a color as red as blood.

The daoist’s help at this crucial moment allowed the emperor to defeat this tough trial and fulfill the physical requirements.

The daoist’s body slowly became ethereal as the two were becoming one.

“That’s heaven-defying...” Everyone became slack-jawed by this magnificent scene.

“I didn’t know you can do something like this.” An Eternal never imaged about fusing with the entire dao source before. No one in the past was crazy enough to experiment with this.
