Chapter 4208: The Overlords

Conversations between true masters always interested listeners, especially when the topic involved the unbeatable beings.

“It’s time to withdraw.” A steady voice came from the same barricaded zone: “Sun and Moon Lords no longer interfere with worldly affairs so the outcome is obvious. The show is over, go find fortunes elsewhere.”

It sounded friendly enough to be considered guidance from a senior - three-parts care and seven-parts command. It lacked pressure and oppressiveness. Others didn’t mind at all as if it came from their parents or seniors.

Alas, the old ancestors were still shocked to hear it.

“Senior Vajra is here as well.” Nine-sun Sword Saint grimaced for a split second before cupping his fist towards the island.

“Senior Vajra? Does he mean Earthraiser Vajra?!” A crowd member shouted in astonishment.

“?!” Those nearby felt the same way. They didn’t recognize the voice but certainly knew this title.

He was a member of the Five Overlords and the strongest ancestor of Nine-wheel Citadel. Though he wasn’t near, his majestic figure appeared vividly in everyone’s mind.

“It’s over, we have zero chance. This is impossible.” A king quietly murmured, wanting to give up.

Only the other overlords could compete with the vajra but none was here right now.

Some experts calmed down and looked over at Flame Valley Lord, wanting to get confirmation.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The lords have indeed retired.” He nodded and ended all speculations.

This meant that the couple would never come out with the exception of an existential crisis. They wouldn’t come here to compete for the divine sword.

There were four left among the five overlords then. Since the vajra was here, there was a chance of Vastsea Paragon coming as well to support his ally.

Therefore, Everlasting Sword God and War God had to come as well. Alas, rumor has it that War God was no longer around.

If this was true, the situation didn’t look good for the new coalition. After all, Everlasting Sword God couldn’t win a one-versus-two fight because they were on the same level.

“Senior, is it really Myriad Era?” Terra Sword Saint bowed his head in that direction, unable to contain his curiosity.

The friendly voice paused for a bit before responding: “It should be, and we want it. Just give up now, War God is dead and Everlasting Sword God is all alone.”

This dealt a great blow to the listeners.

“War God is dead?” Various emotions took them like a storm.

The battle over Myriad Era back then shocked the world since it involved the overlords. That battle was devastating, sinking an ocean and destroying mountain ranges. The entire continent suffered violent earthquakes.

No one came close enough to watch due to the rampant sword energies. Thus, the result was unknown. The participants never talked about it either.

Nonetheless, there were still rumors of War God either dying in battle or suffering fatal injuries. The specifics remained unknown. Even the disciples of Daoist Sword Ground didn’t know much, let alone outsiders.

It seemed that the rumor was indeed true - War God was gone now. A change in title was necessary - from five down to four overlords.

All eyes were on the sect master of Daoist Sword Ground now, Ling Jian.

He seemed to be thinking about something for a moment before nodding: “Yes, War God has passed away.”

Those who held on to a sliver of hope earlier finally lost it all. War God was dead and Sun and Moon Lords have retired. There were only three overlords active then.

Pessimism struck the coalition; they lowered their head in dejection. There seemed to be dark clouds above them.

Earthraiser Vajra was here. He alone decided the outcome of this battle. This was before mentioning the six sword gods and five ancient ancestors.

“Well, at least we know that it is Myriad Era in there.” One expert calmed down and brought this up.

“The leader of the nine heavenly swords, it’s about time.” Another murmured.

“I knew it from the start.” One more was both elated and sad.

“Just how strong is the strongest heavenly sword?” A last-gen member wondered.

“Enough to tempt the overlords.” An ancestor smiled wryly.

“So what if it’s Myriad Era, we probably won’t even get to see it.” This topic took them down the sad path again.

It became abundantly clear that Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel have won. No one else could get a piece of the pie now.

“Wow, it’s so lively here.” Another person came as they were about to leave.

“Rumble!” A great force appeared on the horizon.

It included flying banners, expensive carriages and chariots, beautiful maidens wearing costly dresses… Not even the overlords traveled with so much fanfare.

“Li Qiye!” They knew who it was right away after seeing the magnificent entourage.

“He came!” The dejected cultivators became excited again.

“Just in time too.” Brows were raised in delight.

It wasn’t long ago that most found Li Qiye annoying. But now, he was a sight for sore eyes. Only a devilish monster like him could shake up this hopeless situation.
