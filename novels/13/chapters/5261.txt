Chapter 5262: Long Live The Emperor

The simple metal giant floated in the air while being in complete control. Cultivators, regardless of their strength, found themselves feeling like a speck of dust.

As for the apex conquerors and dao lords watching from afar, they had a look of dread due to the power of the giant.

“It seems more powerful than Armor Conqueror during his prime.” One big shot murmured a comparison regarding an apex conqueror who managed to fend off waves of attack to protect Imperial Attendant City. He later passed away due to his grievous injuries.

Now, everyone felt that this giant was far stronger than Armor Conqueror after seeing it in action.

“It would be easy to start an alliance with it.” Li Zhitian and the others talked among themselves.

“No wonder why Celestial Court tried so hard for the giants back then.” An ancient ancestor commented quietly.

Prior to today’s events, everyone already had a high evaluation of the metal giants due to City Lord Zi Yan’s conquest with their help. It seemed that this was grossly erroneous.

This combined transformation resulted in an exponential power increase, enough to start a new power. Suppression Conqueror was correct in his initial assessment regarding the potential of Imperial Attendant City.

“Clank!” The chest of the giant opened. Pieces disassembled and formed a bridge for Li Qiye to reach the throne of the city.

He walked across the metal pathway and sat down on the throne.

“Long live the emperor!” Resplendent Monarch and the others kneeled in his direction. Ancient ancestors and their juniors from the other lineages belonging to the city also did the same.

As for the guests such as Xiao Qingtian and Li Zhitian, they also performed a respectful bow. They couldn’t kneel because they were from the other alliances.

As Li Qiye sat there, he still appeared ordinary and devoid of any special aura. Nonetheless, he was the pilot of the metal giant so no one dared to slight him.

“Rise.” He waved his hand and the others slowly stood up.

He waved again and the metal giant crumbled into pieces that fly back into their original positions - the smaller giants in the courtyard and the shuttle in the center of the main hall.

Imperial Attendant looked the same as before. However, everyone’s gazes were no longer the same. They still couldn’t help recalling the power of the giant armor suit just now.

Li Qiye gestured at Saintess Shao Yao, wanting her to approach the throne.

She looked around in confusion, thinking that he was calling someone else. However, her master and the others were all looking straight at her.

“Go.” Jadecure Conqueror gently pushed her.

The nervous girl obeyed the command. As she walked toward the throne, her legs were trembling and she could feel eyes fixated on her. This moment seemed to last an eternity to her.

Once she got close enough, she kneeled and said softly: “Emperor.” She looked down at her feet, not daring to look straight at him.

“Come here.” Li Qiye waved again, only exacerbating her confusion.

Nonetheless, she obeyed and came up to the throne. Suddenly, he got up and pulled her over, pushing her down on the throne.

Her mind became empty as he tapped her shoulder and said with a smile to the crowd: “From today henceforth, she is the new city lord.”

“New city lord.” Jadecure Conqueror and the others couldn’t believe this development.

First, there were stronger disciples than Saintess Shao Yao. Second, Jadecure Conqueror and the other ancestors were still around.

It didn’t make sense for the saintess to be chosen right now. However, who would dare to question Li Qiye? His words were the law.

“I…” The saintess herself stammered.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Try your best now, don’t let down your ancestors.” Li Qiye gently placed his palm on her head before disappearing from sight.

Silence took over the hall afterward.
