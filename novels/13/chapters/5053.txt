The power of light couldn’t reach Li Qiye and suddenly stagnated around him, forming a bright domain.

This was initially Radiant Monarch’s power but now, it became Li Qiye’s domain to trap his target. The former felt as if there were billions of mountains pushing down on him.

Though he exerted his speed to the limit, he ended up moving at a snail’s pace.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye casually drew a spear on the domain yet it emitted dreadful crackles of tribulation.

He raised the spear and horrified Radiant Monarch who could tell that death was calling again. Alas, he couldn’t run because he was stuck inside the domain.

“Boom!” A halo wielding enough power to bury the heaven descended and created a dark hole at the impact point.

“Skystomper Halo!” A still-awake spectator shouted.

Skystomper God and his two junior brothers poured all of their power into this special wheel. One junior brother had the heaven part while the other was the burying affinity.

The two of them gave Skystomper all of their power. He turned into a god whose shouts could break the stars.

His empowered halo then created the image of a conqueror. Not to mention Demon, even the other regions in the lower continents could feel this halo’s power.

Other dragon lords took note of this and couldn’t believe it.

“Skystomper Halo, who the hell is he facing to warrant going all out?” One of them shouted.

“Boom!” The halo descended and crushed all the dao laws along the way.

These three ancient ancestors had never resorted to a sneak attack before. Alas, they immediately used their best techniques to ambush Li Qiye from behind, wanting to obliterate him instantly.

They mustered every ounce of strength with this attack. The halo struck Li Qiye but was stopped by a holy glow around the target.

Skystomper Halo was a supreme treasure left behind by Heaven Burial Conqueror yet it failed to injure Li Qiye.

He was focused on something else - throwing the spear of light toward Radiant Monarch.

“No!!!” The genius screamed but still summoned a massive wall of light.

“Bam!” The spear pierced through the wall and struck his six sacred fruits, destroying them despite their toughness.

“Ahh!” It ended up flying through his chest again as he screamed during a freefall to the ground, eventually leaving a large pit.

This was the end of a peerless genius, dying to his own cultivation affinity.

Meanwhile, the ambushers saw their attack not working in the slightest and turned to flee. Alas, Li Qiye reached and grabbed the halo before smashing it toward the trio.

“Nooo!” They screamed as well and used other halos in an attempt to stop it.

Their dao-infused halos couldn’t stop the ultimate treasure. Their dao and sacred fruits crumbled before they were reduced to nothing but blood.

Skystomper God’s eyes were wide open. This halo had helped him dominate for many generations now. It protected him against stronger opponents so he thought that he was utterly invincible. Today, this was proven false.

“You’re next.” Li Qiye told Pagoda Guardian and the three giants who were trying to run away from Demon as well but Li Qiye pulled time and space back with his newly-acquired halo.

“Go!” They had no choice but to work together. Twenty-one sacred fruits erupted at the same time and created an immortal pagoda.

It poured down chaos true energy and laws as large as mountain ranges, capable of crushing any living being into dust. Unfortunately, they were facing Li Qiye.

“Boom!” He swung the halo again and destroyed the immortal pagoda without facing any resistance. The four got smashed into blood pools while screaming.

Eight dragon lords went down just like that. Seven didn’t leave corpses behind; Radiant Monarch was lucky in this regard.

“Not bad at all.” Li Qiye smilingly stared at the halo before tossing it over to Jian Yunyun who instinctively caught it.

She stood there in a daze because she was holding an heirloom weapon of Heaven Burial. That sect would go crazy after finding out.

Of course, there was nothing they could do because they had no one left capable of fighting Li Qiye.
