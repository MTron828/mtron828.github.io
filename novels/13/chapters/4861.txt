Chapter 4862: Historical Ruins

Firerage said no right away: “His Highness’ safety is the imperial guard’s responsibility, so I assure you, Civic Deputy, that it will be fine. Worry about your own post.”

“Guard Commander, you’re overstepping your authority.” Monochromatic didn’t relent.

“Enough of this matter, I will stay here.” Li Qiye became bored of this back and forth so he waved his hand: “Civic Deputy, I can see your devotion. The dynasty will require your support.”

He left no room for negotiation despite the casual tone. Monochromatic couldn’t say anything else. He thought that the implications of danger would scare Li Qiye enough to follow his bidding. Alas, the result was the opposite.

“I shall obey.” Despite feeling discontent, he still acted like a loyal subject and left.

Firerage was feeling the same way. As he spent more time with Li Qiye, he gradually thought that there must be a reason why the dao lord picked this person as the successor.

“Your Highness, please be wary of Civic Deputy. Please excuse my many words but he is a treacherous person who shouldn’t be trusted.” Firerage calmed down and told Li Qiye.

“All of you have reached the top of cultivation yet still act like mortals.” Li Qiye shook his head.

Firerage paused for a moment before answering with a wry smile: “This is Chaos, one has to be pragmatic in order to stay alive.” 

“It is a terrible way to live. Chaos wasn’t born chaotic, it’s just that ambitions and desires are left unchecked.” Li Qiye smiled.

Firerage was startled by Li Qiye’s perspective again. Perhaps these profound comments weren’t mere coincidences.

Li Qiye’s palace had a full view of the dynasty. Alas, it resembled more of a sect because Eight-stallion Dao Lord built it as a great sect. It’s just that a dynasty was more fitting in a place like Chaos.

Li Qiye stood above everyone, feeling the beats of this land with his eyes closed.

“Your Highness, the path ahead will be bumpy but we will follow you to the end.” Firerage said, thinking that Li Qiye might be afraid of the incoming turmoils.

A while later, Li Qiye opened his eyes and said: “Let’s go take a look at this dynasty.”

Firerage didn’t know why but he still agreed. He and his men accompanied Li Qiye along the way.

Though his coronation has yet to be announced, the news has traveled fast and most knew about Li Qiye.

Because of this, the members of the dynasty stared at him with confusion. After all, he looked like a regular cultivator but most importantly, a stranger. It was difficult for them to accept him as the next king.

Furthermore, there were those more qualified than him right now. For example, Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s blood daughter, Northern Monarch, or Venerable Dragon God. Even Monochromatic Master was in play.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Despite having doubts, most didn’t comment on the dao lord’s questionable choice. This wasn’t to say that they were law-abiding citizens.

In reality, the dynasty consisted of many villains who have committed evil deeds before joining the dao lord. There was no way for these men to follow Li Qiye.

Nonetheless, the dao lord’s prestige and authority remained after his death. The big shots still haven’t voiced their opinion either. It wasn’t time to speak up.

Another reason was due to Firerage and the imperial guard. Who would dare to criticize Li Qiye in their presence? Those who were close enough actually bowed to their future king, albeit begrudgingly.

During the leisure stroll, he saw old architecture built in the valleys. Some temples floated in the air; cities were seen among the mountains…

The things that attracted his attention the most were actually remnant ruins scattering about. For example, broken walls and bricks that have been tortured by countless drops of rain and winds.

One could see that they were once part of something incredible and grand. Alas, no one could pinpoint a particular sect to these historical pieces.

“His Majesty said that these ruins were around long ago, he liked this place and picked it as his home.” Firerage explained.

“A good choice.” Li Qiye said while touching the cliff wall. They have gone a full circle and were back to the base of his peak.

“You know about it, Your Highness?” Firerage asked.

“A behemoth of a sect used to be here. Saying that it’s ten times larger than Eight-stallion Dynasty would be a massive understatement. All races listened to it back then.” Li Qiye smiled.

“All races? Even the ancient branches of The Race?” Firerage’s eyes became serious.

“You’re referring to the Divine, Heaven, and Devil?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, they are in charge of The Race.” Firerage said.

The Race primarily consisted of members from Celestial Court. They once dominated the hundred races.

Of course, any race loyal to or originating from Celestial Court was considered part of the Race. They didn’t have to be intrinsically linked to the three ancient races.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye stared at the peak and added: “Back in the olden days, Purewood was considered the first Grand Emperor. However, some legends stated that there was someone else before Purewood.”

“Purewood?” Firerage tapped into his knowledge of history before responding: “Purewood… the ultimate Divine Emperor, is that who you’re talking about?”

Purewood Divine Emperor was an unfamiliar title in this era but Firerage had heard of it before.

“Oh? You have heard of him?” Li Qiye was surprised.

“His Majesty had brought this being up before. He learned of this name after entering Immortal City. It must have been part of a legacy.” Firerage became emotional.

“Immortal City.” Li Qiye gazed at the horizon after hearing this.
