Chapter 5574: Blood From The Chest

The eruption of light extinguished everything - time and space, dao laws, yin and yang…

Everything ceased to exist to the horror of Niu Fen and Baifeng. Although the former was an apex dao lord, he could only helplessly watch this development.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, utilized his primordial dao. He became the supreme ruler of the primordial chaos and suppressed the eruption, pushing the light back into the cracks.

“Creak.” The weapon didn’t give up and continued to struggle, wanting to break free.

“You have two choices, I can either reduce you to dust or let me refine you into something different. Pick.” Li Qiye said nonchalantly.

The weapon stopped struggling as if it understood its current predicament. Energy strands stopped leaking outward.

Niu Fen and Baifeng finally relaxed after seeing this. They felt so insignificant earlier during the extinguishing phenomenon.

“That was scary.” Niu Fen patted his chest, thinking that this immortal weapon was truly dreadful.

This was something far beyond the level of dragon lords and dao lords. Only existences at the pseudo level had a chance of wielding this weapon.

The two could finally take a good look at the weapon after it became passive. Of course, they didn’t dare to touch it.

“Look at the cracks, it almost broke down.” Niu Fen murmured: “Well, still in a way better state than the one in Black Tides, that one is finished. I think the gauntlet in Worldbreaker Fist is missing a large part, only the gemstones are still embedded.”

“What damaged this immortal weapon?” Baifeng became emotional. She couldn’t fathom anything that could be stronger than it.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer.

“Young Master, this is your blood, right?” Niu Fen watched as Li Qiye burned the blood off the weapon and realized something.

“Yes, it went straight through my chest.” Li Qiye smiled.

Baifeng heard this and felt suffocated, unable to digest the implications.

“Young Noble, you were the one.” She blurted out.

The weapon pierced his chest and was stained with his blood, eventually falling to this world.

Since the blood and Momentous Dao shared the same origin, the blood sought out this place and used the dao to recover.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The weapon itself didn’t wish to invade Momentous Frontier - his blood did. It had been infected by the weapon’s malicious nature and turned into a gray aura - a symbol of unquenchable hunger.

It wanted to seize Momentous Dao from the deities and take over this land to accelerate its recovery. Since they had the same source, the deities had a hard time stopping it. Losing was only a matter of time. If they were foolish enough to linger around, they would be suppressed and modified as well.

Without his involvement, his twisted blood would have taken over Momentous Frontier and used its dao to become an unfathomable existence.

Baifeng felt something blocking her throat, making it difficult to breathe. She imagined a terrible battle between Li Qiye and the immortal weapon.

She believed that dao lords and conquerors were mere ants or specks of dust in comparison. The destruction must have been unimaginable.

“Poof!” Li Qiye released dao flames from his palm and initiated a refinement process.

“Clank!” Dao laws manifested into reality and served as the framework for a world cauldron. He masterfully limited his power and flames to the incorporeal cauldron alone.

Only someone as strong as Niu Fen could sense the unstoppable forces within. This was absolutely required to refine the throwing star.
