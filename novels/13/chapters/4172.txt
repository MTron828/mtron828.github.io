Chapter 4173: Nine-sun Sword Saint

The appearances of two kings excited the crowd, thinking that the Sword Burial Zone’s event this time would be amazing.

In fact, many from the bigger sects already knew that they were here. It’s just that they chose to keep a low profile prior, avoiding drawing unnecessary attention.

“Rumble!” A carriage traveled with lightning speed through the border of the various domains to reach Sword Grave. Sun rays shot out everywhere from nine suns circling around it.

Though there wasn’t an accompanying army, the phenomenon exuded by the carriage was dazzling and domineering - more than enough to stir the crowd.

“Nine-sun Sword Saint!” The majority knew who was inside right away.

This visual phenomenon was well known in Sword Continent so it was easy to recognize.

“The sword saint is here too?” Discussions began everywhere.

“I think both saints will show up this time.” One expert speculated.

Nine-sun Sword Saint was considered to be the leader of the Six Kings, even stronger than Peace Ocean Sword King and Void Saint Child.

The other two were relatively young geniuses while he was a member of the previous generation. His counterpart was Terra Sword Saint who was the leader of the Six Sect Masters.

Normally, these two rarely showed themselves in public. This might be an event where people could get to see both of them together.

“If there’s an immortal sword, I think even the Five Overlords will be here.” A last-gen expert mused.

“Poof!” Violet energy surged just like a dragon. It zigzagged as it traveled through the river and the abyss, heading straight for the grave.

“What was that?” People couldn’t see the person inside the billowing energy. They noticed red flames in the billowing energy as well and became impressed with its lightning speed.

“The lord of Flame Valley.” A keen-eyed ancestor recognized the existence.

“Three kings were here, now a sect master too. Would all of them show up today?” One youth became emotional, thinking about all the big shots.

“It’s going to be a bloody conflict for this immortal sword.” An old king murmured.

Many could smell the stench of blood already before the incoming storm.

“Let’s go, we’re heading to Sword Grave.” Some lost their patience and wanted to move on.

Who wouldn’t covet the legendary immortal sword? Regardless of what it actually was, obtaining it meant becoming renowned and invincible.

This has been the case for numerous dao lords after obtaining their heavenly sword here. The temptation was irresistible.

“I don’t want to be late to this.” Patience was running short.

“Elder, what are we waiting for?” A youth became agitated.

“No, we’re staying here.” The elder shook his head.

“Why not test our luck? The immortal sword is right there.” The youth didn’t understand.

“The deeper it is, the more dangerous. The Sword Grave isn’t simple, death looms in every corner.” The elder glared at him.

“It’s that scary?” The youth’s naiveness and inexperience made him courageous.

“Your life won’t be in your hand the moment you set foot in there.” The elder elaborated: “If lucky, even a weak cultivator can escape alive. On the other hand, top Heavenly Sovereigns have fallen in there. This has been the case for millions and millions of years now.”

“Top sovereigns still die there?” The youth took a deep breath.

“The character ‘grave’ in Sword Grave isn’t only referring to graves for the swords.” The elder uttered coldly.

The juniors nearby took a deep breath and refrained from bringing up this issue again.

Nonetheless, this wasn’t the case for all groups. Some knew the danger but still entered the grave.

There was a chance that this immortal sword could surpass all nine heavenly swords. This meant that even the behemoths wouldn’t be able to touch its master then. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“We’re leaving.” Li Qiye lost interest in the abyss.

“Are we heading for Sword Grave?” Snowcloud Princess seemed eager to follow Li Qiye.

Earlier, the lord of Flame Valley and Dao Institution has shown up. He was actually her master.

In reality, other experts from her sect have also arrived but she picked Li Qiye instead.

“Sure.” He glanced towards the direction of the grave and smiled.

She walked right behind him. Her goal here was to gain more knowledge, not to obtain the divine swords or even the immortal sword.

Being the successor of both the valley and the institution, she had access to numerous powerful weapons. There was no need to chase after the divine swords. She wasn’t obsessed with the immortal sword either since becoming the strongest wasn’t her goal.

This was one of the seven forbidden zones - a great opportunity to learn more about the world. She thought that following Li Qiye was best for this purpose instead of tagging with her sect.

As they moved onward, they saw thousands of cultivators running along the safe route.
