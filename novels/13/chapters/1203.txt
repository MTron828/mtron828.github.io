Chapter 1204: The World Beneath The Creek

In this broken realm, Teng Jiwen and Ye Tu had different feelings. They couldn’t explain it clearly, but they felt that they were overwhelmed with indescribable emotions.

It was difficult to point out whether this was a happy or sad emotion amidst their confusion. This was especially true for Ye Tu; this sentiment continued to linger within him.

“It is affecting your instincts.” Li Qiye explained while the two were still uncertain. He then looked at Ye Tu and said: “You are a charming spirit, so this is even more intense for you.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ye Tu had to ask: “Is this place really related to our race?”

Though this was his first visit here, he had heard his seniors talking about it before. Their wise sages had made a prediction. Because of this, experts from their race had entered this place many times throughout history. Even their Void Imperfect Three Schools had explored this place, but all left without great results.

Li Qiye maintained his mysterious smile instead of giving an answer. He looked at the horizon and said: “Let’s go, there is a place we must reach.”

With that, he took the first step forward. The two boys quickly gave chase.

The group took their time. Along their journey, many people from all over the world could be seen entering the realm.

The majority of the cultivators here were eager to find treasures or fortunes among the ruins. Because of this, people were digging deep into the ground or using their divine intents to sweep through the mountains and rivers. Some were climbing to higher places while others drilled into the earth in their search.

Because of the legend of Immortal Emperor Gu Chun, knowing that nothing might come of this trip didn’t deter people’s enthusiasm and interest. Everyone dreamed of becoming the second Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.

Cultivators dug one mountain after another and plowed the land to no avail. They didn’t find anything at all, let alone a great fortune. One of them complained: “The Charming Fragmented Realm is truly a wasteland, there is nothing here.”

“How could it be so easy to find a great fortune? It wouldn’t be called a fortune if it was easily found.” His friend smiled and comforted him: “You know, since the start of time, how many people were like Immortal Emperor Gu Chun? He was the only one! The first emperor of the nine worlds! The first Immortal Emperor! If his fortune came so easily, he wouldn’t have been the first emperor.”

After hearing his friend, the cultivator regained his spirits and continued to look for fortunes and treasures.

The legend was a great moving force for these adventurers. They continued to look over and over again without giving up. In their minds was the image of the first emperor of the nine worlds, the pride of the charming spirits — Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.

After seeing the fruitless searches of the other cultivators, Ye Tu asked Li Qiye: “Is this a forsaken land? Did it used to hide a great secret?”

Although Li Qiye had mentioned his progenitor’s success at finding a supreme treasures in this place, the later generations had never heard of someone else who found something, not even a piece of scrap metal.

“Who says a secret realm must have treasures and fortunes?” Li Qiye looked at the youth and smilingly replied: “Must the forefathers bury treasures or leave behind fortunes in this place so that the future generations can come to find them?”

“But, but Immortal Emperor Gu Chun really did receive a fortune in this place.” Ye Tu hesitated a bit before replying.

Li Qiye laughed in response: “Because he is Immortal Emperor Gu Chun. It’s just as these people have been repeating, how many were similar to him since the start of time? Nobody, since only one could become the first emperor.”

Having said that, he pointed at this head and continued: “In this place, items, treasures, and even fortunes — none of these matter. The crucial part is here. If you can understand, you will have a harvest; if you can’t, then there is nothing worth remembering in this place. It will be a wasteland like the people say.”

Ye Tu interjected: “Young Noble, our progenitor found something here as well.”

“Why is it that Immortal Emperor Wu Gou could find something but others can’t?” Li Qiye smiled: “This place is different from the other locations, including the twelve burial grounds. The burial grounds are places with buried treasures, but it would be a huge mistake to use that logic here.”

Teng Jiwen asked: “How is this place different from the others?”

Li Qiye pondered for a moment with a forlorn gaze before answering insipidly: “In a distant age, it supported an entire race. And it’s not just this land, the shuttle that you both call the Seacrossing Shuttle is included as well. It signified endless hope.”

“Endless hope?” Teng Jiwen murmured. This casual sentence from Li Qiye left him with an everlasting aftertaste.

“If you can understand this, then you will become the second Immortal Emperor Gu Chun.” Li Qiye looked at Teng Jiwen who was trying to make sense of this.

Teng Jiwen coughed and said: “Sir, you are messing with me. I am a treant, so I can’t become an Immortal Emperor.”

Li Qiye laughed and replied: “You are right, but understanding the meaning of this place will grant you a lifetime of benefits even if you are a treant.”

The youth shook his head: “Sir, you think too highly of me. As everyone said before, Immortal Emperor Gu Chun is unique. As for me... even though my talents aren’t bad, I am only an insect compared to the emperors. I know my own worth very well.”

Teng Jiwen was telling the truth. As the successor of the Heavenvine Citadel, his talents weren’t bad at all. He wasn’t looking down on himself either, it was just that he knew he was far from being comparable to the emperors.

The group walked for a long time before they reached a waterfall. It was pouring down from a cliff so high that it seemed to be falling from the sky.

Its current flowed along the terrain, but its stream was divided into several smaller creeks even over yonder.

Li Qiye picked a creek and waded into the water with the two youths. The next second, they sank to the bottom.

At this time, he took out a sea clam, the one that he caught at the Bottomless Trench. He threw it into the creek and said: “Go, you can find your way home by yourself.”

Afterwards, he turned towards the duo and warned: “Follow my footsteps closely, do not make the slightest mistake.”

His serious expression made the boys shudder. They didn’t dare to be careless and quickly nodded.

The clam began to move while wiggling at the bottom of the creek. The pearl within emitted a golden light as if it was guiding the way.

It left behind a faint trace of light. Li Qiye followed it step by step in a very meticulous manner. He knew that one misstep would ruin all of his efforts and that he would have to start all over again.

The duo behind Li Qiye was even more careful. They nervously followed right behind Li Qiye and stepped on his footprints without daring to be careless.

At first, they felt that there was nothing special here. The current of the creek continued to flow with fishes and shrimps swimming about.

However, they suddenly realized that the space around them was a mirage. Suddenly this was an ancient path, no longer the simple path of the creek.

This path led all the way to the sky. They walked upward as if this was a process to ascend to deityhood. However, they saw some terrifying scenes.

In this space, they saw unbelievably gigantic warships. They hovered in space like stars and each of them could carry continents spanning millions and millions of miles.

Such warships had been destroyed. Some were split in two while others had huge holes that went straight through them. Others had uneven gaps while more were shattered nearly to the point of being unrecognizable...

Amidst their daze, they saw countless fragments floating in space, the fragments were bits of cracked sabers, broken swords, and fragmented axes...

Furthermore, they saw skeletons. Some of the skeletons were enormous, as if they were huge monsters that still had a golden glow to them...
