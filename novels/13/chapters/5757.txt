Chapter 5758: That’s Not A Bad Life

Meanwhile, the cloud and star observed her with great interest.

Li Qiye took another sip of tea and said: “Don’t worry about them, it’s just karma.”

“Karma?” She asked.

“This karma is not directly related to you, but you can ponder about it since you have the right to know.” He said.

“To know what?” Something was flashing in her mind as she stood there in a daze.

“You can choose to know or otherwise.” He said: “But, life is short, very short.”

Having said that, he let out a sigh - was it because of her or something else?

“Just decades, isn’t that normal?” She stared at him with both hope and worry. Deep down inside, she was afraid of realizing something - the truth. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Yes, a mortal only has decades in their lifetime.” He nodded: “There are places that mortals cannot reach even if they have several lifetimes.”

“I knew you weren’t a mortal, Young Noble.” She said.

“Are you?” He answered with a question.

“I... of course I am.” She didn’t know why she hesitated in answering.

She grew up in this small place and lived peacefully. There was nothing extraordinary about her life, not a hint of excitement.

“Some dreams are not meant for mortals.” He gently touched her hair.

“So they’re just dreams?” She asked with uncertainty.

“You can explore and choose to know. Of course, you can also ignore it since there is nothing wrong with living the way you are now.” He said.

“And if I choose to explore?” She asked with anticipation in her eyes.

“Then life is that short, the price to be paid.” He sighed.

“I will die?” She hesitated when it came to death but deep down, she wasn’t afraid.

A regular girl would find this matter dreadful but not Ling’er - only a sense of struggle and unwillingness.

“It’s a path to remind you of certain forgotten things.” He said.

She had a flash of insight and shivered: “My first memories include being in a cemetery.”

“What cemetery?” He asked.

She tried her best to remember but it was too long ago. Something seemed to erase her memories periodically.

“I’m not sure, I woke up there and then I was taken in by my parents.” She grabbed her head again due to the pain, feeling her skull splitting apart.

He released her more primordial light and alleviated the pain.

“That’s all I remember, just a cemetery, nothing before it, I don’t even remember what my parents look like anymore, not the slightest impression.” She said bitterly.

“Some cease to exist while others might just be in your mind.” He patted her shoulder.

“Where did I come from then?” She was sharp-witted enough to realize that there was something off about her. The primordial influx allowed her to notice inconsistencies.

“Where do you want to come from?” He asked.

“I have a choice?” She asked.

“Yes, how you are born is up to your wish.” He smiled.

She stood there in a daze. After a while, she responded: “Anything is possible?”

“Yes, anything in this world.” He said confidently.

“What do I have to do?” She asked.

“The end starts from the beginning.” He said.

“The end starts from the beginning...” She murmured: “Then I have to go back to that cemetery? That’s my first memory.”

“We can try.” He nodded: “Just know that you can’t change your mind after wanting to find out.”

She hesitated because she didn’t hate her current life. Was the truth worth losing everything?

“I, I’m not sure I can find that place again.” She told him.

Others’ memories started with childhood. She didn’t have the same thing - only remembering how she woke up next to a tomb. The rest of her memories seemed real yet dreamlike.

“So you’re choosing to explore?” He asked.

“But I don’t remember where it is.” She said.

“It’s easy, I can find it right away.” He smiled.

“Will I die?” She asked again - not due to a fear of death but rather, losing her current self.

“Depends on the perspective, it can be considered rebirth.” He said: “But you can stop and continue as you are.”

“The life of a mortal? Nothing extraordinary?” She asked.

“That’s not a bad life.” He chuckled.

“What about yours, Young Noble?” She asked.
