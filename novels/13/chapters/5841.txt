Chapter 5841: Getting Them To Leave Is Harder

Li Qiye stopped Trinity Bloodaxe with one hand and punched Dao Ancestor’s tablet seal with the other.

Stonesplitter saw another chance and Skypiercer soared through space again to reach Li Qiye’s throat. Despite the potentially fatal move, he still hid behind his shield and seemed ready to run at any moment.

Li Qiye didn’t have a third hand to stop the incoming thrust. However, this wasn’t the end of it either.

“Boom!” The sky dimmed as time and space distorted, causing everyone to feel that Elder Galaxy was trapped in a cauldron. Even someone capable of escaping from karmic ties couldn’t leave this boundary.

Spectators saw a cauldron descending to take in everything and heard someone shouting: “Myriad World Smelter!”

Thus, Li Qiye was assaulted from all sides by four overlords. The image of his primordial tree and other measures were taken in by the cauldron and refined, leaving him defenseless.

A maelstrom manifested into reality from the sheer destruction, wishing to refine him into liquid form.

“Refine!” The controller of the cauldron roared. Lights turned into dao flames and the flames fused into an epoch-level refinement.

“Imperial Progenitor of Myriad Realms!” The last overlord finally showed up.

He wore an imperial outfit and had the most dignified appearance out of the five, looking like the leader of the epoch.

Spectators shuddered upon seeing him. Emperors and monarchs felt their grand dao being suppressed, unable to move an inch. This was understandable since their cultivation system came from him. Therefore, their grand dao were automatically suppressed in his presence.

“Rumble!” He channeled all of his energy into the cauldron.

Meanwhile, the others focused on suppressing Li Qiye with their weapons, hoping to give Imperial Progenitor the best chance at refinement.

“Die!” They roared and did not hold back.

All affinities were refined into one mass with Li Qiye at the center. How could anyone possibly survive this?

“What a joke.” Li Qiye’s laughter could be heard as he released primordial rays to repel all the treasures.

“Boom!” Three overlords were sent flying. Once they got up, they staggered a few steps backward from instability.

As for Stonesplitter Patriarch, he was affected the least due to his peerless shield that blocked all the rays. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The image of the great tree emerged once more while releasing rays constantly like a peacock spreading its wings. As Li Qiye stood by its base, the whole world was behind him - the new sovereign.

“Yes!” The People’s members exclaimed after seeing this. They had worried about his chances due to it being a one-on-five situation.

The founder and the three immortals observed intensely as well. Heaven Authority clenched his fists and said: “No one can stop all five ancestors, Celestial Court will rule the future.”

The founder didn’t respond; his eyes gleamed with unknown thoughts.

Few knew of the overlords’ existence in the past, but now, all five have manifested into this world.

The three immortals never saw them together but the founder had a serious expression. The last time this happened was long ago when Trinity and Divine Ancestor were still around.

The five weren’t in charge then due to Trinity’s presence. Despite already being powerful, they still feared him.

If Li Qiye were to lose, the consequences would be unimaginable. The overlords wouldn’t leave for nothing, perhaps they might devour Li Qiye and the world.

Asking them to come was easier than asking them to leave. The founder understood this but he and the world had no other option outside of wishing for the best outcome.

“At last, how I waited.” Li Qiye gazed at the overlords and smiled.
