Chapter 5773: Azure Bulwark

“Boom!” The azure rushed upward with a boundless presence. An entire world was forced within, granting it enough immensity to stop the world-ending slash.

The shockwaves emanating from the impact swept through the domain and sent stars flying.

“Crack!” Cracks appeared on the azure expanse.

“Azure Bulwark!” Ren Xian utilized his noble sword dao.

Hymns of sages could be heard as his anima and heaven’s wills fueled the armor, mending all the cracks.

“Impressive!” Hao Hai praised before raising his blade again. Each slash took immense energy and effort due to the nature of the paragon artifact. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Autumn Wind!” Ren Xian took the initiative and caused Hao Hai to feel a breeze by his chest - the blade's tip.

“Boundless Style!” Hao Hai formed a majestic mini-dimension in front of his chest to prevent injury.

Putting aside their artifacts, their sword dao stood at the apex of this world. A genius could spend a lifetime studying a single variation.

The two didn’t hold back, fully displaying their skills and advantages.

Hao Hai had the ultimate offensive tool, capable of suppressing Ren Xian. Alas, his cultivation wasn’t at the level where he could use it freely. Each variation required immense focus and still had flaws.

Ren Xian’s immortal armament was slightly inferior in terms of material and origin. However, his mastery allowed him to exert its fullest potential.

The battle between Demon and Light-dragon’s forces remained at a stalemate despite fanatic efforts from both sides.

“Again!” Light-dragon and other apex cultivators channeled their power to draw out more blessings from the palace.

Layers of light engulfed them like armor plates, causing their ranks to look like a tsunami of steel that couldn’t be stopped.

Demon and her allies also sang the dao mantra, pulsing with primordial light. The light intensified until the chapter released devastating flames to stop the flood.

They clashed relentlessly, culminating in destructive forces beyond comparison.

“Clank!” A heavenly sword descended during the stalemate, also blessed by the rays of Celestial Palace.

It represented a supreme sword dao and only became stronger with the boost of the heavenly treasure.

“Whoosh!” It sliced a gap open in the supreme chapter and the assailant appeared - a cultivator engulfed in flames.

“Go!” Celestial Court’s armies took advantage of the opening and focused their flood on that single point.

“Again.” The cultivator raised his heavenly sword for another slash.

He was none other than Sword Emperor but this time, his aura had reached a higher level. As the current leader of Celestial Court, he harnessed more power from the palace compared to before.

This gave the impression that he was in charge of Celestial Court - all of its power was for him to use. This seemed enough to take down the supreme chapter from The People.

“Hmph.” Nightmoon appeared before him and declared: “It is time for you to die.” She has been waiting for him the entire time.

“Can you do it?” He stopped the slash and pointed his sword at her.

“You are dead!” A world with a bright moon appeared behind her, sending lunar tides to envelop Sword Emperor.

Tidal Lunar World was her creation - an attempt to ensnare her target at the right opportunity.

“Not bad!” Sword Emperor roared and activated his bloodline.

“Boom!” The rays emanating from him had the shade of blood. A heavenly symbol appeared between his brows, bright enough to illuminate the world.

This bloodline somehow suppressed Nightmoon Conqueror, causing her vitality and energy decrease dramatically. It seemed to be her nemesis.
