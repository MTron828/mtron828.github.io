Chapter 4716: Supreme Grand Dao, Divine Song

Shen Juntian’s style was unique just like Tian Feng. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The latter’s love for battle made others fear him. On the other hand, Juntian commanded respect and admiration.

Cultivators were prideful and this led to easily being jealous of others. Whenever a new genius was considered the heaven’s favorite, some peers would disagree right away - perhaps not vocally. Juntian was an exception due to his excellent qualities.

“Dao Brother, my dao is named Divine Song.” Juntian said.

“Divine Song, I see. Let me see how profound it is then.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I hope to not disappoint.” Juntian gathered his energy and vitality.

Even those from a million miles away could sense this because his vitality was unique. It wasn’t a type of suffocating pressure or an engulfing majestic force.

When Tian Feng or Five-sun King gathered their power, it would create shock waves sweeping through the realm and sending people flying.

As for Juntian, it hovered around him and seemed to be born from heaven and earth. It felt illusory yet everyone could spot this unique phenomenon.

Despite its non-violent nature, it eventually spread across the region. Strangely enough, the crowd felt comfortable while being bathed in his power, akin to enjoying the rays of spring.

“Buzz.” His twelve palaces appeared and lined up above him.

They released starry lights washing his true fate and helping it communicate with the grand dao.

The region seemingly changed - the scorched earth and mountain ranges disappeared from sight. His true fate became the lord of this world, the only living being and its god.

Therefore, those affected by his power suddenly felt their vitality and power being taken by his true fate. They became a part of his power and their lives were in his grasp.

It was too late to resist since they were never on guard due to a lack of unpleasantness. They felt themselves being tiny like insects who have been stuck in his grand net. Escaping was impossible.

“Buzz.” Gods appeared among the stars. One had three heads and six arms, another had stars floating around it…

They each had their own domain. This encompassed a wide area and put everything inside under Juntian’s subjugation.

He started chanting a special hymn and the gods did the same. His echoing voice instilled happiness and joy into listeners instead of fear.

As the gods chanted, they exuded starry rays onto others and purified them. Stronger cultivators felt the urge to get down on their knees while weaker ones actually did so. The feeling of happiness made it harder for them to escape his grasp. They started chanting alongside him as well to harmonize with his grand dao.

The big shots from far away became startled. His power grew considerably after gaining the help of these followers.

“Divine Song.” True Immortal Young Emperor was also watching: “It’s best to run away as fast as possible to avoid becoming a follower of his grand dao.”

“Can you stop it, Senior Brother?” True Immortal Saintess asked. She was so far away and had shielded her mind yet she could still hear the song.

“Not easily.” The young emperor said.

One ancient ancestor also paid attention to this and said: “How heaven-defying, this is the initial structure of a dao lord’s supreme ability. His potential is there.”

“I will have a hard time blocking it.” One old ancestor became frightened.

Five-sun King was another spectator. He became emotional and said: “Here it is again, Divine Song.”

“You’ve seen it before, Your Majesty?” A maid nearby asked.

He nodded in response: “During a previous spar, yes. I would have lost without the Bowl of the World blocking it.”

“Your supreme grand dao wasn’t enough?” Another maid became surprised since their king was unstoppable in their eyes.

“We don’t have anything like his bloodline lineage once activated. This is an unfair advantage belonging only to dao lords’ children.” Five-sun King said solemnly.

The maids then understood why Shen Juntian was a frightening combatant.

The chantings also reached Li Qiye’s ears while the starry rays washed his body. They intended on purifying every inch of his flesh and assimilating his grand dao.
