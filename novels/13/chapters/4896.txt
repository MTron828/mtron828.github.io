Chapter 4897: Blacksmoke Regalia

“Well, because you are wearing Blacksmoke Regalia, I shall let you have an opportunity.” Li Qiye smiled. [1]

“You are aware of it?!” She became startled.

“Of course, it was passed down by a certain someone.” Li Qiye said.

Jian Yunyun became emotional because not even those from Primal Dao knew about it. Only one or two from the Alliance had an idea. She thought that she had found the right person after seeing his knowledge.

“It is one of the few secret treasures that our alliance still has. Fewer than few know about it.” She stared intensely at him.

In Primal, a few ancient ancestors were aware of its existence. However, they didn’t even know its name. Therefore, she became perplexed.

“It is from a distant past, too far away to remember by those from the present.” Li Qiye said while staring at the bonfire.

“It is a supreme treasure left behind by our progenitor, the creator of Primal Dao.” She said.

“Then do you know who this person is?” Li Qiye asked.

“Well…” She couldn’t answer right away.

Primal was one of the twelve supreme lineages in the lower continents. Primal had numerous branches under its jurisdiction. Most of them had a good idea of their history.

Alas, the same couldn’t be said about the first progenitor for both Primal and the Alliance. They lacked a single scroll containing information about this mysterious being.

For example, Hundred Races Dao didn’t have one progenitor but they knew their past. They started from a gathering of great powers after the immemorial epoch war. They were a direct branch of Imperial Alliance from the upper continents.

Since it was made up of various great powers with no initial ties, their sources were also different. This was different for Primal. Illumination, Heavenseal, Ascension, the Alliance, and many others were all connected to a single progenitor.

Their merit laws and old treasures were still related - branches from a single stream. The lack of records regarding such an influential progenitor simply didn’t make sense. No one could answer Li Qiye’s question.

“Who is our progenitor?” She blurted out.

“Is this the only reason why you brought me here?” Li Qiye smiled and asked a question instead.

“I represented Primal to participate in the coronation. I heard that you named the monument Primal Trinity Against the Heaven. Since the characters are similar and are often used by our lineage, I was wondering if it has anything to do with us”. She took a deep breath and inquired.

“That’s it? Is this worth kidnapping me and risking being pursued by Eight-stallion?” Li Qiye chuckled.

She opened her mouth but hesitated. She naturally knew the risks but this matter was important to her.

“It has no relation to your lineage nor its origin. Just think of it as a coincidence.” Li Qiye smiled: “That’s why we should get to the point. Take out whatever you have.”

“... How do you know I have something to show you?” She couldn’t believe it.

“I sense something that I haven’t in a long time.” Li Qiye said: “Yes or no?”

She saw his eyes becoming profound and frightening just like two black holes. She felt herself losing control of her body.

She tried her best to remain calm before solemnly taking out an item. This was her goal in the first place but Eight-stallion Dynasty wasn’t the right place to do so, hence the kidnapping.

This was a small box with numerous blessings and seals. Just the wrapping alone was made from priceless cloth.

She respectfully presented it to him with both hands after moving the cloth. It appeared to be a bone around the size of a fingernail. It no longer had any color or divinity.

Upon first inspection, it seemed to be useless due to old age. Alas, a meticulous pair of eyes would be able to sense something special even though it lacked luster and power - a charm belonging to the olden days.

“This is the ultimate secret of our Alliance known as the ancestral bone. It has been passed down for eras and never revealed to any outsider. I have it with me this time due to an unexpected circumstances and it somehow reacted when you took the charcoal out of the brazier. It exuded heat, only for a split second.” She said.

“So there’s a connection.” Li Qiye stared at the bone for a bit before holding it.

It seemed heavier than any divine metal in spite of its size. The density must be out of this world. He rubbed it and found the surface to be smooth as if it was polished numerous times before. He could tell that something unimaginably sharp had severed it. The required speed must have been brilliant as well.

Most wouldn’t be able to imagine this, only characters of Li Qiye’s level were able to envision the force of that strike.
