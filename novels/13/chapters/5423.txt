Chapter 5424: Faults in All

After taking a closer look, they found that the pool was containing liquified stars. They saw their own reflection while gazing into it.

As they took their time, they suddenly saw a vision of time - a river coursing to the past and then to the future. It resembled an unfurled scroll revealing dreamlike scenes depicting their life and fate.

“Devil dreamwater!” Someone realized what it was - an extremely rare type of material that has similar characteristics to water.

Supreme and the others became startled after seeing this.

“Such a high concentration and quantity.” A conqueror couldn’t believe it.

This “water” only existed in the three illusory realms, only appearing for a split second during a special dawn event on the tip of chosen grasses. It would disappear afterward so cultivators had to time the gathering precisely.

Although far from being on the same level as anima dreamwater, it was still highly coveted. Most importantly, this wasn’t just one drop but rather, an entire pool.

“Why did he gather so much devil dreamwater?” This confused everyone in the audience due to the time requirement to gather the pool.

Illumination gazed at his broken world and fallen brethren, thinking that he regretted nothing. This was for the sake of his grand ambition and lifelong pursuit - a trade he was willing to make.

“My brothers, our timeless epic begins now with this final journey!” He declared unwavering as if he had returned to those years gone by - a hero at the pinnacle whose commands were obeyed by the world.

The small number of survivors inside Illumination Grotto including Devil and Riverwalker saw this and started gathering at the altar.

“What are they doing now?” Spectators had an ominous feeling.

Devil and Riverwalker weren’t as strong as apex cultivators. Nonetheless, they were only one step below.

.

Supreme, Swordsea, and Eternal understood that this could get serious. However, their pride prevented them from stopping the enemies.

The survivors standing near the altar painted a devastating scene for Illumination. His men were either killed in battle or fled after seeing his insanity with the immortal order.

Only the truly devoted followers remained. Some were his sworn brothers and others have been with him since the very start. They were willing to follow him to the very end.

“Brothers, not even death can make us flinch. Shall we start?” Illumination asked loudly.

“We are with you, Brother.” Devil and Riverwalker willingly accepted.

“For The People.” Illumination bowed in their direction.

“For The People!” The survivors shouted back.

“Eternal glory belongs to us!” Illumination rallied the men once more.

“Commence!” The survivors no longer had doubts or fear in their minds.

“They’re all crazy.” By this point, many had a good guess of what they wanted to do. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Poor souls.” Swordsea uttered coldly.

“Truly tragic.” Supreme kept it short.

Eternal gazed at the unfolding scene and added: “Tragic, yes, but that doesn’t absolve them of responsibility nor shield them from?consequences.”

“Buzz.” The altar lit up and exuded rays wielding an ancient force.

They illuminated Devil and the others, immediately coiling around them. Cracks began appearing on their body as the rays seemingly sliced them apart. Their blood naturally flowed down into the altar, staining it red. This also transformed the rays and turned them red as well.
