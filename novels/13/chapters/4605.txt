Chapter 4606: Five-sun King’s Friendship

The members merely nodded to greet him, not bothering to do anything special.

“These four must be from the ancient clans in the east.” Jian Ming murmured to himself.

Five-sun King then noticed Xiao Xuan. His eyes narrowed and became profound as he attempted to learn her identity.

However, she waved her hand and stopped his gaze instantly, sealing him from noticing anything.

He immediately stopped and didn’t pry any further.

“Gentlemen, Miss Ye.” He hid his aura and cupped his fist toward everyone. Nonetheless, his dominating charisma remained.

As a top genius of the young generation, it was impossible for him to lay low and not stand out. Only a few were qualified to be his rivals.

Paramount Scion and Ye Tingrong stood up and returned the gesture toward the famous genius.

“May I ask if what you would like to order?” Puresword came over, looking like a waiter. He didn’t seem to be in awe of Five-sun King.

“Anything will do.” The king said politely before heading for Li Qiye.

“We got a show.” The daoist tapped Jian Ming’s chest.

Paramount Scion and Tingrong also paid full attention to this development.

“Will he risk it all?” Jian Ming whispered. Due to his information network, he had heard about the death of the king’s father.

Therefore, there was an irreconcilable feud between the two. Perhaps the king was here for revenge.

“Fellow Daoist.” Five-sun King slightly bowed toward Li Qiye.

“Sit.” Li Qiye didn’t stand up.

The king sat down and stared intensely at Li Qiye, hoping to find what he was searching for. Li Qiye allowed him and sipped another cup of tea.

“Where are you from, Fellow Daoist?” The king asked.

“From where I should be.” Li Qiye nonchalantly commented as if he was just talking to a random passerby on the street.

“Even farther than Sky Border?” The king asked again.

“Farther.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Then you are a guest, I should carry out my responsibility as the host and offer you the utmost hospitality.” The king smiled back.

Ye Tingrong found this astonishing. Five-sun King was both mighty and had limitless potential. Everyone wanted to befriend him but couldn’t due to the disparity in status.

Normally, they would never have a chance to talk to him. In fact, just speaking to him was the greatest honor, let alone being offered this much respect. Not even last-gen experts and ancestors could enjoy this privilege.

In this case, Li Qiye showed no sign of happiness from the preferential treatment. Outsiders would view his attitude as being arrogant and ignorant.

“What kind of hospitality?” Li Qiye asked.

“When you have time, Fellow Daoist, come visit my Five-sun School?” The king said.

“I see, seems like there is some sincerity here.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

At this point, any outside listeners might yell at Li Qiye for his impudence. Being invited by the king would be the story of a lifetime. The person would brag it to everyone repeatedly but Li Qiye didn’t seem to care.

“We will show you magnificent hospitality.” The king said.

“In what manner?” Li Qiye smiled.

“We will do everything possible to satisfy your needs, Fellow Daoist.” The king went on.

The whole thing was strange since the king was being so cordial to his father’s killer. No one else would do the same given the circumstances. They would have rushed and risked everything to kill Li Qiye while gritting their teeth.

“Something is off about this.” Jian Ming murmured. In his opinion, this invitation wasn’t that simple. This was obviously a treacherous scheme.

“Not necessarily. Maybe his extraordinary patience and toleration are the reasons why many ancient clans in the east support him.” The daoist whispered back.

“True.” Jian Ming said.

In terms of background, Five-sun King was far inferior to True Immortal Young Emperor and Shen Juntian. He was inferior to Tian Feng as well.

After all, Five-sun School stood no chance against Three Thousand Dao or True Immortal.

Nonetheless, he relied on his own power and methods to gain the support of the east. Even a few reclusive clans came out to help him.

Thus, this genius became the de-facto leader of the east. His experiences before reaching this point must have been rich and exceptional.

It required immense self-control to not try and kill his father’s killer right in front of him. Perhaps this had nothing to do with having a tolerant and forgiving personality. It was just that he had a goal and this was more important than anything else.

“I have many needs and wants.” Li Qiye smiled and said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Just say the word and I’ll do everything possible to help you out.” The king spoke generously.
