Chapter 4922: Deity’s Arrogance

By this point, many neutral students had gathered around Jian Yunyun's house, watching the scene unfold and making comments.

In fact, there had been underlying tensions in Abroad for the last two days. Members of Deity had teamed up to spy on their fellow students. The simpler cases had resulted in minor questioning, while others had escalated into full-blown interrogations.

Those from The People sect despised the actions of the members of Deity. However, since they were united and powerful, there was nothing that could be done to stop them.

Therefore, the crowd enjoyed seeing Jian Yunyun standing up to Halo Scion, as he had been repeatedly doing this over the last two days.

Many didn't dare to speak out against him, as he was a formidable cultivator and most importantly, a descendant of the Skystomper God.

“That’s Senior Sister Jian for you, so cool.” One student whispered.

Her fans had nothing but praise for her. One of them said: “Obviously, she’s not weaker than Halo Scion at all, and need I say more about her prestige?”

Halo Scion appeared embarrassed after receiving a stern reaction from Yunyun. He smiled wryly and said: “Miss Yun, this is for your sake just in case there is anything shady going on.”

“No need. Please return, this is Abroad Palace of the academy, not Deity.” She refused.

The group found themselves in a tough position due to her unyielding attitude.

“Miss Jian, you are mistaken here. Abroad has villains and thieves roaming about.” A steady voice answered instead.

Another youth appeared and everyone from Deity bowed toward him.

He donned a dark-green robe, exuding an air of both handsomeness and authority. He resembled a concealed blade, ready to decapitate at a moment’s notice. His stern gaze made others tremble.

“Swordgrasp Young Noble.” Some blurted out his title. Even those who had prejudice toward Deity lowered their head.

“So that’s their backer.” Someone else whispered. Of course, this was obvious given their recent arrogance.

The young noble was an Immortal Sovereign. Only one or two students in Abroad were stronger than him.

His support emboldened them, allowing them to search people and even their dwellings. He naturally came from Swordgrasp - a unique power in Deity since it could communicate directly with Divine and Heaven Alliance.

In a sense, it could control all of Deity. The only thing preventing this was Conceal Conqueror’s strength. Her current sect, Godchaser Palace, served as the current leader of Deity.

Nonetheless, Swordgrasp’s influence remained relatively strong in Deity.

“Who are you? Which sect are you from?” The young noble came over and glared at Li Qiye.

His tone was far more demanding than Halo Scion. The latter was a fan of Jian Yunyun and remained cordial.

“Introduce yourself first before asking someone.” Li Qiye leaned on the door and smiled.

His casual demeanor frustrated the young noble. He was actually considered a supreme genius, half a level above Halo Scion and Jian Yunyun.

“Don’t be suicidal.” His eyes gleamed menacingly.

His aura erupted and made many stagger backward. Weaker students actually fell to the ground.

“Swordgrasp, you don’t get to act unbridled at my place.” Yunyun was furious and activated her power.

“Buzz.” A tree capable of shouldering the heaven appeared behind her. It opened its own domain to stop the incoming aura.

After all, Heavenraiser Tree was a peerless art. She managed to stop a slash from Ascension Sacred Lord, let alone someone from the same generation.

“Miss Jian, harboring thieves will provoke our lineage.” Swordgrasp Young Noble didn’t relent.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Eyes turned toward Li Qiye. Some thought that he might be the thief.

The news of this matter had spread all over the academy. However, the culprit remained at large.

However, after getting a good look at Li Qiye, they didn’t think that he was someone capable of stealing from Deity.

“Deity is rather imperious nowadays. Do you think you’re still special at the academy? Run back to Deity if you want to act cool.” Ming Shi landed next to Yunyun and laughed.

She winked at Li Qiye and said: “Don’t be afraid of them, we got your back.”

“Princess Ming Shi is here.” Students from The People became more confident after seeing her.

She was from Untethered which was stronger than Primal right now. This was the only lineage in the lower continents capable of competing against Deity since it had a seven-fruit dragon lord.

“Ming Shi, you wish to get involved in this matter?” Swordgrasp coldly said.

Meanwhile, Halo Scion quietly told Yunyun: “Miss Yun, abstain from this serious matter. Deity is not messing around this time, ancient ancestors are present.”

Heaven Burial and Deity were on the same side. Alas, he still wanted to help Yunyun.

Others heard this and got chills coursing down their spine. There were ancient ancestors presiding over this matter? This was far beyond their reach then.

“So what? Our lineage can bring ten here right now, you’re not the only one with ancient ancestors.” Ming Shi had no fear, unlike Yunyun. Primal lacked solidarity currently and she was powerless.

“Hell yeah!” A member of The People shouted: “We have ancient ancestors too!”

“Damn right, Deity should know better than barking here.” Another joined in after Untethered’s involvement.
