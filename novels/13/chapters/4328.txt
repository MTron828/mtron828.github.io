Chapter 4329: I’m Here

The crowd exchanged glances of confusion. Jian Qingzhu was the saintess of Dragon and in theory, she should be supporting her senior brother.

Wang Weiqiao was blind enough to oppose the activation of the altar and go against the young lord’s plan. Death was the expected outcome for this insignificant being. It wouldn’t affect anything at all.

Strangely enough, she stopped Gao Qixin and gave the stage to Wang Weiqiao instead.

Despite being confused, the weaker cultivators didn’t dare to comment on this issue. As for the members of the great powers, their curiosity has been piqued.

Some remembered that Li Qiye, the sect master of Little Diamond, had climbed up her branch. This might be the reason why.

“This doesn’t make any sense. Why would the saintess antagonize the young lord over this tiny sect?” One sect master whispered.

The smaller sects themselves understood how valueless they were. She should be focusing on Dragon’s goals instead of helping Little Diamond.

“Yes.” Gao Qixin lowered his head. He naturally wanted to work for the young lord but didn’t want to offend the saintess either.

“You’re too kind, Junior Sister.” The young lord spoke without showing any emotion. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Qingzhu then spoke with a friendly tone: “Fellow Daoist, why do you insist that we mustn’t activate the altar?”

Her amicable attitude earned her a favorable impression from the small sects. They have been oppressed so far and endured disdain. No one from a great power would show them any respect, let alone a saintess like her. Nonetheless, she still addressed Weiqiao respectfully as “fellow daoist”.

“My master is ferrying lost souls in the mountain, he is in total control. He’ll send all of them to the other side eventually so there is no reason to activate the altar. It will only disturb him.” Weiqiao elaborated.

“Are you talking about Young Noble Li?” She asked.

“That’s right.”

“Nonsense.” The young lord uttered coldly: “The darkness is an ominous sign, a disaster. What is this crap about ferrying souls?”

“Yes.” Deer King chimed in right away: “Fellow Daoist Wang, the young lord is toiling for the sake of the world and its inhabitants. Leave now, don’t be unreasonable.”

Weiqiao shook his head and said: “I am not talking rubbish, my master is indeed ferrying the souls. Just wait a bit and they’ll disperse. There is no darkness.”

“Ridiculous!” Deer King raised his voice: “I’m sure this so-called ferrying is nothing more than a ruse. You must have some devious plans with the darkness, that’s why you wish to prevent the young lord from activating the altar.”

“That’s a baseless accusation.” Weiqiao retorted.

“Then why do you insist on stopping us when the darkness is right outside? You’re afraid that when the young lord subdues it, your devious plan will be revealed. I see, your sect must have been the one to summon the darkness in the first place!” Deer King sneered.

“Deer King speaks with logic.” Gao Qixin jumped in: “Myriad Sect Mountain has been fine all these years. I believe that this whole event is because of Little Diamond’s attempt to summon the darkness and borrow its power.”

Some actually thought that Gao Qixin was making some sense. The conferences have been uneventful in the past. Now, black fog came out of nowhere and Wang Weiqiao mentioned his master ferrying lost souls and to not activate the altar? This was too much of a coincidence.

Assuming that Little Diamond was guilty, they would definitely want to prevent an activated altar.

“We need to investigate this just in case some are conspiring with the darkness against Southern Desolace.” The golden daughter of Soaring Feather said seriously.

“Dragon shall protect Southern Desolace at all costs.” The young lord said heroically: “We shall annihilate anyone who dares to harm this land.”

He spoke with righteousness as if he was the leader already. Wang Weiqiao and Little Diamond served as great stepping stones to build up his prestige and reputation.

If Little Diamond was actually conspiring with the darkness, he would be able to lead and destroy it. But on the other hand, even if it wasn’t, he could still destroy it and gain further reputation. This tiny sect could be destroyed without posing any risk.

“I agree.” The young lord of Flow stated his stance.

The other great powers didn’t say anything whether they agreed with him or otherwise. Little Diamond wasn’t worth their effort.

“What evidence do you have? My master is doing no such thing.” Weiqiao strongly denied.

“I’ll capture you first for an interrogation.” Gao Qixin knew just what to do.

“Clank!” He summoned an iron chain and threw one end towards Weiqiao.

The latter’s expression changed. He immediately leaped backward but Gao Qixin was far stronger. The chain flew around him and left him no room to escape.

“Clank!” Suddenly, someone else grasped the chain and pulled hard.

“Ahh!” Qixin bellowed in pain as blood gushed out of him. His arm had been ripped out of the shoulder from the sheer force.

“?!” Deer King and the others shouted.

“The likes of you dare to bully my disciple?” The newcomer spoke.

A person walked out of the black fog - none other than Li Qiye.

“Master!” Weiqiao was glad to see him.

“The new sect master of Little Diamond.” Those from the small sects recognized him.

“That’s him?” Members of the great powers found him to be too ordinary, not a master capable of ferrying lost souls.

“Are you insane?! How dare you harm someone during the conference? Surrender now!” Deer King roared.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye approached the stage with a relaxed demeanor.

“Young Lord, he must be the mastermind behind this! Pl-please, avenge me and exterminate his clan!” Gao Qixin shouted, enraged after losing his arm.

“You deserve death for saying this.” Li Qiye smiled.

“The young lord is right here! He’ll exterminate…” Gao Qixin bellowed.
