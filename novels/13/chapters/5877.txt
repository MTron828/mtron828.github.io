Chapter 5877: The People And The Race Are No More

Li Qiye summoned the emperors after the battle’s conclusion.

“It is finally over, your contributions can’t be overstated so rewards are in order before I depart.” Li Qiye said.

“The biggest reward for us is your presence, Sacred Teacher.” One emperor replied.

“My stay won’t be a present, just a calamity. I must go where I should.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

The emperors by now understood his point, especially World and Sword.

He took out Epoch’s End’s Immortal Hexaplate and gave it to World Emperor: “The Qian had the biggest sacrifice for this battle. It shall be rebuilt.”

“Its spirit lives on.” World accepted the treasure and bowed.

Li Qiye sighed and gently touched Sword’s forehead: “You have endured well, I’m sorry.”

His palm lit up with primordial pulses for a spell. With that done, he gave Imperial Progenitor’s dao sword to him.

“I did what I could for the world. We would have all died without your protection, Sacred Teacher.” Sword prostrated and said.

“I hope you will live well henceforth.” Li Qiye blessed him.

He then took out Trinity Bloodaxe and gave it to Immortal Emperor Hao Hai: “You had limitless potential with the dao yet you still selflessly agreed to the plan. The world is lucky to have you around.”

“I will answer your call should you require my assistance again, Sacred Teacher.” Hao Hai bowed.

Li Qiye nodded and gave the chaos seal from Dao Ancestor to Profound Emperor: “Since you will shoulder Ultimate, this will be useful.”

“I will do my best to research the dao and not let you down, Sacred Teacher.” Profound bowed.

Next to receive a gift was Immortal Emperor Ren Xian - Voracious Leviathan’s epoch scales forged into armor. Immortal Emperor Fan Chen received Lord of Derivation’s drum.

Li Qiye then divided the rest of the treasures from the overlords to the rest of the participants.

“The shackles are no more, you are in control of your cultivation now.” Li Qiye told them.

“We will not let you down, Sacred Teacher.” The group became emotional and bowed.

“I leave Celestial Court to you.” Li Qiye waved his hand and told World Emperor.

“I accept.” World bowed again.

“Are you departing now?” Sword asked.

“It’s about time to leave.” Li Qiye nodded.

All eyes were on him after hearing this. Profound asked: “Are you starting your expedition, Sacred Teacher?”

“It is time to enter Heavenrealm, I’ve been lingering here for too long.” Li Qiye said.

“I wish to follow you.” Hao Hai said.

“You have a long way to go.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I understand.” Hao Hai paused for a moment and said: “I’m a hindrance in Heavenrealm without becoming an overlord first.”

Li Qiye chuckled and said: “I’m going now.”

With that, he disappeared and everyone bowed in his direction one last time.

The news of the battle shocked the world. Emperors and monarchs rejoiced afterward. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Although they speculated this possibility after seeing the heavenly rains, the death of the overlords moved them to tears. The darkness shrouding the epoch was finally removed; the sky became clear again.

“The People and The Race are no more.” A decree came from World Emperor - the new leader of Celestial Court.

“The conflict is over!” Both sides celebrated the changes.

Ordinary cultivators weren’t in control, always being dragged into this eternal conflict. Now, World Emperor removed the divide. His Celestial Court also kept a distance from the rest, no longer exerting its authority.

Most importantly, cultivation entered a new golden age. Everyone focused on absorbing the essences from the rains and their cultivation soared.

Peerless cultivators and capable sects appeared out of nowhere. Alas, they knew little about the sacrifices behind the scenes or the mastermind - Li Qiye.

As time passed, the participants of the war wondered about him.

“Where did Sacred Teacher go?” An emperor asked.

“He must be meditating right now in preparation for his journey to Heavenrealm.” A participant in the battle said.

“Sounds right.” Another agreed.

“So what is this Heavenrealm?” The emperor became curious.

“Perhaps a place with numerous overlords. Primal Ancestor and the others didn’t dare to visit it.” A Grand Emperor mused.

“Fei and Origin went, I wonder what happened to them.” An Immortal Emperor said.

“Min Ren’s group followed Sacred Teacher there before too.” A knowledgeable cultivator said: “I bet they have a stronghold there now.”

“Should we go too?” Someone became eager to test their limit after enjoying the golden age of cultivation. Becoming a supreme overlord was not impossible anymore.

“A battle against the heaven.” An acquaintance of Li Qiye worried about the future.

“He won’t be coming back after this.” A Grand Emperor sighed.

They knew of his preparation for eras now. The road was paved in this epoch and it was time to go.

Ten thousand years passed by in the blink of an eye.

“Crack!” The spatial fabrics of the six continents were torn apart. Heavenly rays descended and engulfed the world.

“Sacred Teacher!” Emperors and monarchs all appeared.

“Boom!” A primordial tree appeared and pushed up against the sky. Li Qiye stood on top, shining the epoch with his primordial rays.

Laws from the tree combined to form a radiant gateway.
