Finally, Elder Sun sighed softly and said: “The sect does not have an Immortal Emperor True Treasure, and it also does not have an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure.”

“Not even one?” Even though Li Qiye was mentally prepared for this, but hearing that there was not even one made him a bit frustrated. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was of Immortal Emperor lineage! Right now, not even one Life Treasure could be found, he could not believe this!

Gu Tieshou softly continued: “It is said that the Patriarch had left behind three Life Treasures and his fate protecting True Treasure; however, at the moment I took this seat, these items were no longer here. At the very least, even during the last sect master’s period, these items were no longer inside the sect.”

Li Qiye asked: “Lost or stolen?”

Immortal Emperor Life Treasures were one thing, but the fate protecting treasure of Min Ren, also a True Treasure, was too important to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!

“This... I’m not too clear regarding this matter.” Gu Tieshou hesitatingly smiled and said: “The Immortal Emperor True Treasure... I am not clear about the exact details. I’m afraid even the previous sect master didn’t know. That year, I heard the martial uncle’s discussion. One uncle said that the True Treasure flew away a long time ago. Another uncle said that during the moment our ancestor, Mu Shaodi, was competing for the Heaven’s Will with Immortal Emperor Ta Kong, he lost our True Treasure in a heaven frightening battle... I’m afraid, the last ten generations of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has not seen an Immortal Emperor True Treasure.”

Li Qiye asked: “What about the three Life Treasures?”

Gu Tieshou contemplated for a moment and then answered: “This, I cannot answer either.”

Here, he glanced at the other four elders, and he continued: “I heard that there was one Life Treasure that could have been taken by ancestor Liu to the ground, and it was buried along with him. Whether this is the truth or not, I do not know.”

Elder Sun explained to Li Qiye: “Ancestor Liu was our sect’s first bulwark; in terms of seniority, he would be the grand disciple of Ancestor Mu. I heard that the battle thirty thousand years ago, against the Heavenly God Sect, was led by him. After our defeat and retreat back to our ancestral ground, Ancestor Liu no longer showed his face. There were many rumors about him. Some seniors said that he died in the battle, and some said that he came back wounded and met his origin within the sect.” [1]

Liu San Jian was rumored to be the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s greatest genius after Mu Shaodi; however, unfortunately, he was not able to protect the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect in the end, causing the collapse of the old kingdom!

At this point, Elder Qian gravely added: “The other Life Treasures could have possibly fallen into the hands of the Heavenly God Sect.”

“Into the hands of the Heavenly God Sect?” Having heard this, Li Qiye’s eyes became serious. This was an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure; this type of item falling into the hands of the Heavenly God Sect was not a good thing for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.

Gu Tieshou dejectedly sighed and said: “This is the thing we are worried about the most. There is no way to verify this matter, but it is almost absolute that this Life Treasure is in the hands of the Heavenly God Sect. In the last battle, our sect lost countless Royal Nobles, Enlightened Beings, and Ancient Saints. In order to protect the kingdom, I heard our ancestors summoned the Immortal Emperor Life Treasure to face the Heavenly God Sect. Afterward, we lost the fight completely, and the entire kingdom fell. Under such chaotic circumstances, the Life Treasure’s whereabouts are unknown.”

Elder Zhou worriedly said: “I worry that the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom would bring this Immortal Emperor Life Treasure to attack our sect.”

If the Heavenly God Sect had a character powerful enough to carry the Life Treasure to attack the sect, then even with the Zither Pavilion, it wouldn’t be able to withstand rounds after rounds of the Life Treasure’s attacks.

Hearing Elder Zhou words, Gu Tieshou’s group lost their colors. This was indeed an extremely dangerous matter, they clearly knew the power of an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure.

“Let them come. It’s time to see how the Immortal Emperor Life Treasure is.” At this point, Li Qiye pleasantly bloomed a smile and said: “When the flood is coming, the dam will block. When the troops are coming, the generals will hold! Our plan does not change. Three days later, behead Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou.”

With a deep voice, Gu Tieshou said: “We’ll do it like that. This is the first battle for our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s revival, and also the beginning our revival.” He was finally determined.

The elders and protectors present all hoped to revive the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and regain the glory of their ancestors, especially Gu Tieshou. He grew up in the sect and considered it as his home. The moment he was leading the sect, how could he not hope for it to become more powerful? However, he could only lament his limited aptitude and lack of power to revive the sect.

Currently, with Li Qiye’s miracle appearance accompanied with the protection of the Patriarch, Gu Tieshou saw a chance for the sect to come back.

The second day, the sect announced Cao Xiong’s conspiracy with outsiders, the betrayal of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and also his execution! This news had been released, and the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was in an uproar. The sect disciples couldn’t help but spit on Cao Xiong’s selfishness. A calamity was befalling the sect, so they should have been working together. Cao Xiong’s actions were reviled by the disciples.

As for the matter of Li Qiye being the chosen person for the resurgence, the sect did not announce it. Only the elders and protectors had the right to know, even sectional leaders were left unaware.

At the same time, the sect the next day sent the news of the public execution of Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou to all of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. This time, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect especially chose an unprecedented bold action like never before. At the time of the execution, the sect had invited many sects from the kingdom to attend.

Many big sects and heavenly gates were moved by this news in the entire Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.

“The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wants to flip the heavens!” Quite a number of sects looked at each other in amazement. Just Dong Shenglong was somewhat acceptable, but who was Lie Zhan Hou? This was a general of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, a generational ferocious man under the Mortal King!

Currently, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wanted to publicly execute both of them, wasn’t this the same as completely destroying the face of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and the Heavenly God Sect!?

A sect master curiously asked with a strange expression: “In the end, what is actually giving the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect such confidence?”

For the last few thousand years, everyone personally witnessed the decline of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but today, this sect dared to publicly execute these two people – this was too bold!

There were many cultivators who observed the battle that night, and many of them clamored. Some felt that the sect had an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, and some assumed that Liu San Jian was still alive!

“Could it be that this time, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has an absolute ace? Otherwise, why would they risk a war with the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, and have to execute these two?”

“Maybe they went crazy?”

Some felt that this was the case and said: “Today, to compare the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to the Heavenly God Sect is like throwing an egg against a rock. Even if the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still has an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, it would still be impossible to rescind the current situation of their decline. In present times, the Heavenly God Sect had countless geniuses and numerous Royal Nobles!"

“This is the sect seeking its own destruction, ah.” An older sect master lamented. He knew the situation inside and shook his head: “The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has no inheritors. They became blindly arrogant; even with an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, it is no longer an important matter for the sect. One has to know, the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect is still alive.”

When it comes to the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect, even powerful sect masters and heavenly lords of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom would become silent. After the Difficult Dao Era, characters like the Heavenly God Sect’s Ancestor became undefeatable – this was a giant high above! The moment a character like him takes action, not to mention the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but even a grand sect or clan would be destroyed by just his fingertip in the blink of an eye!

Referring to the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect, many extremely aged sect masters lost their colors and shivered in fear.

“This ancestor had lived for tens of thousands of years. Unless Mu Shaodi is still alive, otherwise, if he becomes angry, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s existence will become void!” A Royal Noble from the last generation that had seen the monstrous ancestor before gently sighed.

The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect publically declared the execution date for Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou, yet no cultivators or sects dared to become their guests to observe the execution.

Even though everyone wanted to know how this storm would end, but they didn’t dare to show up for this execution. Of course, this did not deter many grand sects and ancient heritages from observing at a distance.

Currently, the Heavenly God Sect was too powerful and controlled an entire gigantic kingdom. Inside the boundary of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, no sects dared to oppose the Heavenly God Sect! Anyone present at this execution would be the same as opposing the Heavenly God Sect, and no one was willing to tease such a giant monster like the Heavenly God Sect.

However, watching from afar secretly, the Heavenly God Sect couldn’t interfere in this and had no reason to send their troops.

So, before the execution date, countless cultivators were watching the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s every move behind the shadows.

During these three days, the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were both excited and nervous. To the sect, the Heavenly God Sect was too powerful. Today, they had the chance to execute Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou, this was an event that motivated the disciples’ hearts.

At the same time, the sect had entered a battle preparation stage. All of the disciples were entering their peak concentrations, ready to enter a battle at any time.

Inside the sect, only one person was at ease – it was Li Qiye. Only Li Qiye was unperturbed like an old god, seemingly as if everything had nothing to do with him.

“You sure are confident!” Seeing Li Qiye’s god-like calm demeanor, even Li Shuangyan was perplexed. This matter, even one little mishap would be a declaration of war with the Heavenly God Sect. Even a heaven’s proud daughter like herself, regarding such a matter that would pierce the heavens, would have to be cautious. However, Li Qiye didn’t even consider this as an issue.

“It’s only a small sect, not enough to reach the apex.”

[1] I took some liberty with the word bulwark here – the literal term used here is “protector sect”, but we already have protectors, and his status is way above them, so I chose the word bulwark instead- sect’s sect protector would sound too awkward.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
