Chapter 4291: Dao Instruction

The elders contemplated while looking around. The first elder was still the first to break the silence: “Sect Master, our sect has no foundation to speak of, I don’t think it’s realistic to talk about revitalization right now. We seek to survive by storing more food and resources, that should be our aim.”

He was afraid of this young sect master being too ambitious and impetuous, wanting to go big from the start with a grand plan.

He lacked experiences compared to others but still had a good idea of the sect’s current situation. In his opinion, having an ambitious sect master might not be a good thing.

First, they lacked resources and any grand scheme could result in bankruptcy. Worst of all, they might risk antagonizing a powerful enemy and that would be the end for them.

The other four listened attentively and agreed with him.

“As long as we can survive and grow a little bit, that is enough to meet the ancestors without shame. We must maintain our long heritage.” The second elder nodded.

They believed that given their current power and resources, expanding was nothing more than a fantasy.

“Survival isn’t difficult.” Li Qiye understood their viewpoint and said: “You all just need to train harder, not to dominate the world but to protect Little Diamond in this tiny region.”

“I’m afraid we’re too old.” The first elder said: “Sect Master, the truth is that this is our limit, we won’t be able to go any further. The future of the sect relies on you.”

“Yes, I believe our improvement will be negligible regardless of how hard we try. We should leave resources to the young ones.” Elder Hu agreed.

Improving their cultivation was easier said than done since they all had a bottleneck. Firstly, they lacked longevity. Secondly, they lacked talent. Thirdly, their sect couldn’t support them.

Reaching the next realm required immense resources, powerful merit laws, and ample pills.

If they were to actually do this, they would take away the opportunities of the young ones who had more potential. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Improving by several realms won’t be an issue.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We appreciate your kind intent, Sect Master. Let’s use me as an example, I would need numerous pills in order to surpass the yin yang realm. It’s a bottomless pit that can’t be filled.” The first elder smiled wryly.

“Right, the future is brightest as long as you can lead the young ones towards the right path.” The fourth elder nodded.

“Who says cultivation requires natural resources and pills? Requiring external means is not the right way.” Li Qiye’s response stunned the elders.

“Sect Master, could you elaborate?” The fifth elder said with hesitation.

“Resources alone can’t let one reach the apex, the arduous dao will make sure of that.” Li Qiye said: “One can only climb successfully while relying on themselves. Otherwise, it’s akin to a fool climbing a tree to catch fish.”

“Sect Master, do you mean…” The first elder remained skeptical. It’s not that he looked down on Li Qiye, the guy simply seemed too young.

“You cultivate the Golden Bell Prison.” Li Qiye stared at the first elder and said: “It has taken you to the yin yang realm but your dao has stagnated, you know that this is the end.”

“Y-you can see it?” The first elder became startled.

The other four felt the same way. They naturally knew the first elder’s condition. However, the juniors in the sect had no idea.

On the other hand, a stranger like Li Qiye was so familiar with his condition.

“The truth is that you won’t have any problem reaching the next realm. Pills aren’t required.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Really?” The first elder became excited yet maintained a certain level of skepticism: “I can still break through to the next realm?”

Ultimately, he still believed that he knew his own condition better than anyone. He had researched and attempted numerous methods before, only to find it hopeless.

“Yes.” Li Qiye calmly elaborated: “Your left meridians are damaged from a reckless attempt of breaking through, resulting in an imbalance. This is due to you lacking foundational merit laws at the start of your dao journey.”

“I… can’t believe you know all of this.” The first elder stood up in disbelief. Even his four brothers weren’t privy to the details of his suffering since he never told them. After all, everyone had their own secret.

“Just one glance is enough to see.” Li Qiye said casually and astounded the listeners.

Nonetheless, he proved himself correct and they had to trust him.

“What should I do then? Please guide me, Sect master?” The first elder bowed his head after calming down.

Sincerity took over. He no longer underestimated Li Qiye due to his age.

“I shall do you a favor. Listen carefully, nourish your vitality with a focus on yang energy. Store them in your dao foundation while adding chaos energy to the mix. The true fate can serve as support, let your dao guide your vitality…”

He went on a long lecture, spewing a deluge of profound information. The first elder became immersed in the learning process.

Once Li Qiye finished, he became emotional and bowed earnestly: “Sect Master, listening to you for a day is more fruitful than cultivating for a thousand years.”

The other four elders found this astonishing as well. The young Li Qiye was actually teaching the first elder how to cultivate.

The lecture was seamless and logical in accordance with the dao. This was unprecedented for them.

“Sect Master, please guide this disciple.” Elder Hu stopped caring about face and bowed sincerely.

“You? You don’t have any big problem, a decent foundation as well. The reason for your sluggish improvement is due to your dao. Cultivate a minor art named Minor Sun and there will be considerable changes, doing less yet gaining more…”
