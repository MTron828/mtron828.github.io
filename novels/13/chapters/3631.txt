Chapter 3632: Ignorantly Fearless

“Senior Brother!” Stallion Silver Spear Zhang Yunzhi’s arrival made Zhang Changyu ecstatic. [1]

Changyu got himself another backer so he became bolder. After all, just Yan Jingxuan wasn’t enough.

Zhang Yunzhi’s status at the academy and his clan’s influence in the holy ground were enough to deal with anyone. People would need to think twice before opposing him.

“Our Duality Academy has plenty of hidden dragons and crouching tigers.” Zhang Yunzhi told Li Qiye: “Your words showed a lack of respect for Duality.”

“I don’t see any true dragon and white tiger here, only a bunch of frightened idiots. Please don’t flatter yourselves as such but in the case that you actually believe it, then I’m afraid that you have a deep misunderstanding of what dragons and tigers are.” Li Qiye started laughing.

His arrogant laughter made the crowd quite unhappy. They believed that just being a student here was a testament to their exceptionalism. Thus, Li Qiye’s assessment was viewed as a blatant provocation. Their wrathful eyes fixated on him said it all.

“You’re out of line.” Zhang Yunzhi furrowed his brows and solemnly said.

“Is that so? The students here claim to be the heaven’s favorites yet they want to chase away a little girl over some rumors. How is this appropriate for members of the famous academy? Only a bunch of frightened children.” Li Qiye replied.

Though many students didn’t outwardly state their concern, most wanted to banish Fan Bai out of the academy. It was better to be safe than sorry.

“She’s not a little girl, just the embodiment of bad luck!” Zhang Changyu coldly uttered: “Why should the school keep someone who is cursed by the heaven around?”

Fan Bai lowered her head again from the pain. This was not the first time she heard it and it still truly affected her each time.

“Oh? You’re not the heaven, how do you know she’s cursed?” Li Qiye snorted.

“Facts proved that she’s cursed. Anyone who helped her all died a terrible death. Even their sects and clans went down. That’s all the proof one needs.” Yan Jingxuan said.

“Right, I personally know two sects that have been reduced to nothingness after being involved with her, that’s why she can’t stay here!” Huang Qibing shouted.

Fan Bai listened to the whole thing and became increasingly distressed. She tried her best to not cry behind Li Qiye.

The students agreed with this notion more. Earlier, they felt bad after listening to Li Qiye since Fan Bai was indeed just a young lady.

Alas, this so-called Foredoomed Star was followed by numerous calamities. No one would be at ease knowing that she was here in Duality.

“That’s right, we can’t let her stay here! Chase her out of Duality, this is for the greater good!” One student shouted.

“I support this decision, misfortunes will come to both the academy and us.” Another friend yelled.

“We’re being nice enough by just asking her to leave. Do it or we’ll teach her a lesson.” One more said furiously.

An overwhelming majority wanted Fan Bai to leave. The neutral party was fewer in number.

Fan Bai who had just gained some confidence quickly lost it. This feeling of helplessness was present every time people chased her away.

She didn’t dare to face the crowd while hiding behind Li Qiye. Meanwhile, Yang Ling was furious.

Unfortunately, she couldn’t say anything because too many others were yelling. The mass was against them.

“We shouldn’t let this source of disaster linger in this world. We should burn her to stop her from inflicting further destruction.” Zhang Changyu shouted with a twisted and fierce expression.

“Bah, you’re not a man, you only pick on people weaker than you!” Yang Ling retorted.

“I’m only thinking for everyone else and the holy ground. She is nothing but trouble, burning her is the only way to get rid of the problem!” Zhang Changyu’s face turned red but he was emboldened by the supporting students.

Fan Bai trembled in horror and leaned closer to Li Qiye.

“All of you, come then, let’s see if your skills are as formidable as your mouths.” Li Qiye smiled at them.

“You’re the one suggesting this.” Zhang Changyu glared at Li Qiye in response.

“Yes, come and do your best now.” Li Qiye gestured provocatively with his hand.

“So bold!” The other side was furious at this total contempt.

“Junior Brother Changyu, teach him a lesson now.” An upperclassman said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Senior Brother.” Changyu stared at Zhang Yunzhi, waiting for instruction.

“A competition is fine, so that outsiders can’t say we’re afraid of a fight.” Zhang Yunzhi smiled.

“Good!” Changyu became confident and shouted: “Li, I’m taking your dog head today!”

“You alone? Seems like a scar is not enough to forget about the pain. You didn’t learn the lesson from last time.” Li Qiye taunted.

“And if I join?” Yan Jingxuan said: “Since you’re challenging all students from Duality, I can’t just stand and watch.”

“Count me in too.” Huang Qibing stood up, ready to avenge his divine bull.

The three of them walked forward and exchanged glances. All three clearly wanted to kill Li Qiye judging by the murderous glint in their eyes.

“Anyone else? Remember, this is to the death.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmph.” Some students scowled in response. They also stared at Yunzhi, clearly waiting for his instruction.

Yunzhi gazed at Li Qiye and said: “Just our three friends here are enough. Fellow Daoist, go all out now, don’t blame them if you were to die from holding back.”

“We’re more than enough to kill you.” Huang Qibing said.

Though he has heard of various rumors about Li Qiye, he didn’t buy that a woodchopper at the conqueror level could be that strong. Moreover, there were three of them. This should be more than enough to kill him.
