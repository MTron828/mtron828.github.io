Chapter 1158: Life Origination

There was quite a stir at Golden Isle due to Li Qiye’s sudden arrival and successful crossing of the one hundred and eight bloodline jade test.

Though the isle had long been prepared for this groom selection, this new bloodline coming out of nowhere caught them off guard. Thus, while the disciple arranged the living quarters for Li Qiye, several ancestors gathered to discuss this matter. Even the isle lord showed up.

After all, the main protagonist this time was his daughter, so he was more attentive to this than anyone else.

The ancestors glanced at each other while one of them spoke: “I don’t think there has ever been a bloodline that passed through all the refined jade surfaces.”

“Outside of our treefathers, the Silver Treefather’s imperial prince did so. I think he also passed all of the tests.” A different ancestor corrected him.

Even though the apex experts of the treants couldn’t become Immortal Emperors, in the eyes of many people, they were equal to Immortal Emperors. In this way, their direct children were also imperial children.

“Perhaps something was wrong with the platform?” Another ancestor questioned the validity of the test.

The Golden Isle Lord gently shook his head: “Ancestor, there was definitely no problem. I have already rechecked the platform and it is fine.”

“It can’t have a problem because it was created by the treefathers. It isn’t something so easily broken.” One of the ancestors was very confident with his sect’s platform.

Another added: “A bloodline of the imperial prince level... This has not appeared in the Heaven Spirit World for a long time.”

The third ancestor elaborated: “At the very least, not for the human race.”

The isle lord mused for a second before stating: “I’m afraid it is not an imperial bloodline of the contemporary generation. It has to be an even older one if our platform cannot analyze his lineage and origin. This means that his original ancestors are even older than our treefathers.”

An ancestor responded: “Such an ancient bloodline is all the more precious due to its greater purity.”

From a certain perspective, the isle lord was correct. Li Qiye’s bloodline had been polished several times. After numerous refinements, it had become very powerful. More importantly, he also refined the true blood of the Blood Progenitor and three Immortal Emperors from the Blood-devil Tribe, resulting in his bloodline becoming even more powerful and ancient.

The second ancestor clapped his hands and said: “Such a bloodline is a perfect match for our princess.”

“Senior Brother, you can’t put it that way.” The third ancestor slightly shook his head: “I’m afraid that when an imperial prince bloodline and an even older one combine, it will lead to conflicts between the bloodlines. This level of bloodline might lead to a descendant with a human bloodline while we want a powerful descendant with our bloodline this time.”

This opinion made the elders and isle lord stare at each other.

The main reason why these lineages liked powerful human bloodlines was because of reproduction. As long as their race’s bloodline was strong enough, the offspring would surely inherit their side.

However, if the groom’s lineage was of an ancient imperial line, then it became a different story. Perhaps the human bloodline would overcome the treefather’s bloodline and the child would be more human instead.

The isle lord asked the ancestor standing in front of him: “What should we do now? Shall we cancel the marriage and give him some compensation then let him leave?”

The first ancestor pondered for a bit before replying: “Nothing is impossible. In principle, we treants don’t need to preserve our blood’s purity. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be marrying humans. This might actually be a good thing. We don’t have to decide to breed our bloodline in this generation.”

With that, he surveyed the rest of the group and continued: “So what if the offspring will have an imperial prince bloodline? This also means that we can multiply this particular bloodline! At the same time, it leaves us with a better bloodline. And it’s not like we can’t have human descendants in our line.”

The other ancestors wondered for a bit before agreeing: “This is indeed understandable. We can postpone passing down our bloodline for now. Even if the future offspring carry an imperial prince lineage, it would only make our sect stronger and enrich our legacies. If we could produce an Immortal Emperor, it could even change the current temperament of our isle.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“An Immortal Emperor from a treant lineage... this will be an amazing experiment.” Even the Golden Isle Lord felt his heart beating faster with excitement.

For both treants and sea demons, their ultimate fate was to be stuck at the Heaven Spirit World. Due to their own powerful bloodlines, it was difficult for them to have offspring with a different bloodline winning out. Thus, they didn’t have Immortal Emperors like the humans and other races.

However, if the lineage itself could produce a human Immortal Emperor, then it would be a new pattern for the treant race.

Li Qiye was staying on one of the islands with verdant and thick foliage. There was only one building. Living alone on this islet while gazing at the beautiful sceneries was indeed a very pleasant lifestyle.

As the future groom, Golden Isle treated him very well, so he was particularly comfortable here.

In fact, the stallions at the big lineages had always enjoyed superb treatment. After all, they needed these powerful bloodlines to produce more offspring. The loss of these stallions was the lineages’ loss.

After the disciple from the isle left, Li Qiye sealed the space around him and began to channel his blood energy while examining his internal condition.

After doing so, he gained a better understanding of his internal injuries thanks to the water beam. With his mastery of alchemy and methods of treatment, these injuries weren’t much and could be healed very quickly.

He understood now that the internal injuries weren’t the problem, the main culprit was the drop of water that he obtained from the maelstrom.

He opened his fate palace and the spring of life emerged. A casual glance wouldn’t yield any results, but with a careful observation, he noticed that the drop of water was still floating in the spring.

There was nothing strange about it since it looked quite similar to the water of life; it was all melting into life. However, with a meticulous gaze, one would find that the majority of the spring water here couldn’t melt this particular drop. Eventually, through sheer effort and repetition, a tiny strand of this drop was finally removed.

Just like that, tiny threads of the bead were melting into the spring. This made the water of life suddenly become heavy and full of vitality. The process of diluting these little threads of essences required a monstrous amount of life water.

It was precisely this incredible drop of water that was making Li Qiye’s spring of life feel unbearable. Due to the shortage of life water, Li Qiye’s vitality and strength were suppressed.

Thus, it appeared as if he was a mortal rather than a cultivator. Even a stronger cultivator wouldn’t be able to tell that something special was happening to his blood energy.

“So amazing, this thing combined with the maelstrom created a unique condition. No wonder why all kind of unbelievable events occurred in the past.” Li Qiye exclaimed in admiration after seeing the essences within a single drop of water since he was aware of its true mysteries.

The great maelstrom was a dreadful place and even more ominous for the charming spirits. Not too many people knew about the secret hidden within.

“Life Origination, I have finally found it.” Li Qiye watched his own life water trying to analyze this bead and murmured: “Just missing one more part. If I can get all four, then the four cores of the fate palaces will open and a profundity understood by no one throughout this entire world will appear.” [1. This fate palace theory was mentioned during the first fifty chapters when they were introduced.]

He couldn’t help but smile at this point. No one had been able to collect all four parts. In fact, Li Qiye had never seen the true appearance of these four parts before. He had only heard a few legends about them.

Of course, only characters like him were eligible to even know about these rumors! He even questioned their existence in the beginning.

It wasn’t until he obtained the Ancient Void Rune that he confirmed that all of them truly existed. After grabbing the Heavenly Dao’s Primal Chapter, he began to see through their mysteries.

The rune, chapter, and now the origination, all of them had unbelievable mysticisms and power. There was no need to talk about other things, focusing purely on the Blood Progenitor, he had truly grasped the mysteries of the Heavenly Dao’s Primal Chapter and even thoroughly maximized its effects.

Because of this, the progenitor was able to establish the matchless Blood Race!

After obtaining the chapter, Li Qiye gained a new idea. He wanted to gather all four items. Only by doing so would he be able to truly grasp their ultimate mysticism.

The truth was that in the last millions of years, he had spent painstaking efforts to learn more about these legends. Alas, it was all for naught, which made him quite suspicious about the claims.

But now, he was more determined than ever to collect all four. At the same time, he understood where to go to find the last piece.

“The ultimate mysticism of the fate palaces...” Li Qiye glanced over all three items and murmured: “Or rather, the mysteries behind the power of this world are hidden within.”
