Chapter 5300: Ruining The Nine Worlds’ Reputation

The rider of the river wore a yellow robe and a hat, looking like someone who guides souls to the underworld.

He appeared outside of Lesser Firmament and didn’t look imposing. He resembled a dilapidated middle-aged man who used to be a laborer.

As he stood there, his physical body seemed to be in another realm and was unreachable. People thought that it was best to stay away from the river due to its death affinity.

“Ming Du.” Yang Sheng gave him the side eye.

“Immortal Emperor Ming Du.” Most recognized this title - a mysterious and powerful ferryman.

“It’s been a while, Brother Guan Feng and Brother Yang Sheng.” Ming Du cupped his fist with a smile.

Although everyone heard frightening tales of his abilities, he looked rather amicable in person.

“The ancient emperors are gathering?” Many big shots conversed among themselves.

“Don’t act familiar now, I don’t know you, an emperor from the nine worlds joining Heaven Alliance. How humiliating.” Yang Sheng said, not giving any face.

Of course, this also insulted everyone else who joined Heaven Alliance, especially the Immortal Emperors.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Everyone has their own path.” Ming Du smiled: “You joined Lesser Firmament and I joined Heaven Alliance, our journey is the same, only the path is different. Brother, you need to be less extreme for life isn’t just black and white.”

Ming Du held a high position in Heaven Alliance but rarely showed himself after joining.

“So what if I look down on Heaven Alliance and Celestial Court? I also look down on you, hound.” Yang Sheng took a sip of wine.

“So be it.” Ming Du shook his head and said: “Feel free to think that way about me, Brother Yang Sheng, but I am here today with sincerity.”

A while ago, Heaven Hammer, Illumination, and many others were visibly annoyed after being insulted. However, Ming Du remained carefree in stark contrast.

“This matter is rather simple to deal with, just let that entity leave Lesser Firmament. Since Azure School and Heaven Alliance wish to kill it, let them do so. Isn’t that better for our nine worlds?” Ming Du said.

This left everyone slack-jawed. Whose side was he on?

In Heaven Alliance, his status was actually higher than Godcloud or Lantern Conqueror. Of course, this directness was also one way to accomplish Heaven Alliance’s goal without needing to fight the ancient emperors.

“Hmph, we don’t care about the sinners or whatever, hand Moon Embrace over and we will leave.” Ferocity was annoyed after being treated like air by the emperors and conquerors.

“Brat, go back to the playground.” Ming Du waved his hand and said with a smile: “The emperors are doing business right now, it’s not your turn to speak.”

Ferocity’s expression darkened after hearing this. Alas, these emperors were all monsters so he didn’t dare to retort.

“Brother Guan Feng and Brother Yang Sheng, what do you think? We should just drink while watching Supreme and Illumination fight to the death. When they’re done, we’ll take care of the aftermath, yes?” Ming Du said, making people question his allegiance again.

“I appreciate your sincerity, Brother Ming Du, but Lesser Firmament will not concede in this matter. Gentlemen, just leave and all will be fine.” Immortal Emperor Guan Feng refused while shaking his head toward Heaven Hammer and Lantern.

“It’s fine if you all won’t scram. We can just fight to the death, let’s see if you conquerors are stronger than us emperors.” Yang Sheng laughed and said.

As the negotiation was breaking down, another figure appeared outside of Lesser Firmament.

“Jue Xian’er!” Both conquerors and emperors were wary of her, not because of her cultivation or ability but rather, her Immortal Piercer.

No one here had absolute confidence in dealing with it.

She looked around with her cold eyes before focusing on Moon Embrace.

“I want it.” She said before immediately using her Immortal Piercer.

“Whoosh!” It pierced through the outer layer of the crystal walls in no time at all and wrapped around Moon Embrace.

“Come!” She pulled back the chain, wanting to drag the set of armor out.

“Boom!” The dark fog noticed this and erupted in power, turning into a gigantic hand and initiating a stronger attack against the seal.

“Focus!” A majestic figure inside shouted. Numerous imperial auras and dao surged upward in order to stop the rampaging fog.

However, this gave enough time for Xue Jian’er to pull Moon Embrace out of the wall.

“Moon Embrace!” The wondrous artifact became the center of attention again.

Although some parties came for the sinners, they also wanted to take Moon Embrace.

“Rumble!” Ferocity and his men channeled their power.
