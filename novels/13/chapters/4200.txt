The scion’s sword dao was immensely profound since it was one of the nine. Dong Ling’s supreme sword dao might be slightly inferior. Nonetheless, it still reached a transcending level, enough to put spectators in a trance.

“Activate!” Dong Ling roared during the climax of the battle, no longer holding back his vitality and energy. Loud explosions detonated as a result of the flooding chaos energy.

Draconic images and roars could be heard from his imperial sword. The silkworms could transform into anything, even the mighty dragons.

“Heaven Silkworm Transformation!” He bellowed. The dragon leaped upward and started splitting into myriad forms - a flood dragon from the northern sea, a horned dragon from the southern sky, a silkworm dragon from the western territory, a crimson dragon from the eastern territory…

“Raa!” Hurricanes and storms came with the horde of dragons. Their draconic aura didn’t go easy on the spatial fabrics.

The area started shaking violently. The core of the world seemed unable to withstand their arrival.

“Damn!” Some turned pale after seeing this.

“It is as mighty as can be.” Even the ancestors became emotional after witnessing this attack.

“Endless Abyss!” The scion was not afraid and used the next variation.

His single sword birthed ten thousand more, serving as an outline for another abyss. It kept on spreading and served as an inescapable prison. Anything stuck inside would never see sunlight again.

Gusts and cries could be heard since the abyss began its offense on the countless dragons.

“This sword dao can devour everything, even the horde of dragons. I’m not sure how long Dong Ling’s sword dao will be able to hold up.” An expert took a deep breath.

“A heavenly sword dao is still too much to take. This ancient imperial dao is obviously brilliant but there is still a gap. Dong Ling’s defeat is assured.” A king sentimentally said.

“Go!” Dong Ling didn’t care at all and entered a berserk state. His vitality rose once more as a bloody aura took over.

“Raa!” His sword dao regained its power as the dragons came back again.

“Break!” He suddenly summoned an old halberd with his left hand. It also released a celestial dao and coiled around him.

“Ascension!” He roared. This dao borrowed the power of the celestials and cosmic lines for its own.

This eventually accumulated into a majestic figure that fuses into him. Dong Ling then created a massive maelstrom - one violent enough to deform the abyss.

“Two dao at the same time?” The fact that Dong Ling could use the sword dao with his right hand and a halberd dao with his left astounded the crowd.

“We’ve far underestimated his talent.” This was too shocking for the young generation.

The scion also felt Dong Ling seizing the upper hand, slowly sucking in his abyss.

“Ascension Martial Dao! This is another top one!” A last-gen expert with knowledge of Heaven Silkworm said.

“Abyss Slash!” The scion dispelled his abyss and recalled all the swords to form a massive blade. Once swung, everything would fall into darkness.

“Clank!” The spectators were horrified by the power of this slash. Numerous dragons were killed as a result.

The berserking Dong Ling didn’t relent and still turned his energy into dragons. They roared and raised their claws against the incoming slash. At the same time, his maelstrom continued to hinder the scion.

Unfortunately, his plentiful vitality and energy weren’t enough. The dragons were killed and the slash was still coming towards him.

The maelstrom became the next target and was being cut down despite its elasticity.

“Shit!” Some shouted because Dong Ling was wide open now after the destruction of the maelstrom. They thought that he would die for sure.

“There’s no stopping this slash.” An old cultivator concluded.

“What a shame.” One big shot said with a tinge of regret. Dong Ling was quite talented. The issue was his inferior grand dao.

“Buzz.” Suddenly, immortal light engulfed him. Silk strings manifested and created a cocoon around him.

“Boom!” The abyss slash was already weakened after going through the dragons and the maelstrom. He wasn't facing the full brunt of the attack.
