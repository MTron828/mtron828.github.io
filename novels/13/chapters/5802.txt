Chapter 5802: From Truth To Origination

Listeners couldn’t help but become enthralled by the revelation despite the grim circumstances.

They knew little about Trinity Ancestor and the extent of his power. Was he strong enough to look down on the supreme overlords?

Of course, the others were far weaker compared to their current prime while Trinity Ancestor was undoubtedly the strongest.

They couldn’t help but imagine this great being, especially the mentioned physique and true soul.

“Sacred Teacher, we’ve had enough of your proofless insults!” Hao Hai raised his voice: “Although you are unbeatable, our Ancestors can’t be inferior. I will overestimate myself and experience your might today!”

“It’s fine if you wish to defend them, but their gifts are far from enough to do anything to me.” Li Qiye said.

“Honor above all.” Hao Hai said: “I will use Divine Beast to exchange one move with you, Sacred Teacher. Please give me pointers.”

He stopped forward and showed no sign of fear. Others admired him for having courage after witnessing Li Qiye’s power. He knew that this meant death but still chose to defend the Ancestors’ honor.

“I appreciate those who show some backbone.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Come, let’s see the invincible treasures your supreme Ancestors have bestowed upon you.”

“Excuse me then, Sacred Teacher.” Hao Hai slowly unsheathed Divine Beast; his aura changed immediately.

The roars of countless beasts erupted as a primal world manifested into reality. Their rampage could stomp everything to pieces while Hao Hai served as their master. It felt as if Hao Hai was grasping a world instead of a sword, capable of releasing beasts to obliterate the enemies.

“Boom!” His twelve wills and palaces emerged, granting him the power to stay in control.

“Rumble!” His anima appeared; its power engulfed the battlefield. Primal strands could be seen within his anima at this point.

“From truth to origination!” Someone shouted. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This was the next step after mastering anima and reaching the limit. Obtaining a primal anima meant becoming an Ancestor.

Hao Hai was now eligible to embark on this next path. If he could break the limit, his anima would evolve to the next level.

“Rumble!” This power coiled around Divine Beast and Hao Hai as he raised the blade.

Everyone watched with bated breath. This was still a paragon artifact, albeit not at grand completion.

Just holding the epoch power could make cultivators explode, let alone use it effectively. This was a testament to his strength - a being who had seen the truth and was eligible to move to the next step.

“Sacred Teacher, here I come!” He roared and myriad divine beasts soared into the air.

They filled up the area and roared, ready to devour the world. Their combined power made spectators feel insignificant and tremble in horror.

Just a single true dragon could claw them to death, and it was just one of the countless hordes. The gluttonous beasts were particularly terrifying with their love for flesh.
