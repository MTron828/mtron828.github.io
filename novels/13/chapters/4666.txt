Chapter 4667: I’m Here

Nonetheless, the guards from True Immortal still immediately stopped them.

“The alliance is conducting official business. Leave.” One of the shouted menacingly.

They naturally recognized Li Qiye but True Immortal has never been afraid of anyone. Furthermore, they had three of the best possible allies.

“I didn’t know Worldbreaker belongs to True Immortal.” Jian Ming spoke on Li Qiye’s behalf.

“This pertains to our official business, please leave.” The disciple insisted.

“That’s a nice way to put it, official business, to hide the daylight robbery of the gemstone.” Jian Ming sneered.

“Hahaha.” The daoist joined in: “It’s sad to see the decline of True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao. Two righteous sects acting as bandits yet refusing to acknowledge it. The hypocrisy at play here.”

“Watch your mouth.” A True Immortal disciple shouted back.

“So you’re allowed to rob but we aren’t allowed to comment on it?” Jian Ming smiled: “Everyone can see that you’re robbing Golden Fist Emperor and ruining your own reputation. The number one sect in the world is nothing more than a den for two-faced wolves.”

“We will not stand for your insults!” A different disciple unsheathed his weapon and bellowed.

“Oh, I’m so scared…” Jian Ming exchanged glances with the daoist before suddenly attacking: “Take this!”

Jian Ming summoned numerous trees shooting forward. The daoist let out a nefarious smile and waved a banner. It released blade-like gales toward the guards.

“Break!” Despite being caught off guard, they reacted fast enough to send back sword and saber waves.

Unfortunately, they were still weaker than the duo.

“Ahh! Ahh!” In just a second, the guards were either killed or grievously injured.

The gales and screams attracted the spectators nearby.

“Li Qiye’s men and True Immortal started fighting.” They exchanged glances.

“The audacity, to go against True Immortal right now is the same as slapping the alliance. This is most unwise.” One cultivator said.

It was abundantly clear that the alliance would not let anyone set foot on this mountain. Provoking them was nothing short of declaring war. This would naturally end with being hunted down by them in due time.

Therefore, though many were unhappy with their overbearing conduct, they still didn’t dare to do a damn thing.

“Others might be afraid but this is Li Qiye we’re talking about.” A fan of his said: “He has already done enough to True Immortal, he doesn’t mind offending Three Thousand Dao and Divine Dragon too.”

“Offending is putting it lightly. He did more than that to everyone back in Golden Gate, showing contempt to all.” An annoyed spectator said.

“I don’t question his ability but I doubt he can keep this arrogant act up forever. The alliance will teach him a lesson.” One genius still felt slighted.

“That’s up for debate. Li Qiye is clearly as strong as a conqueror. Other disciples will just be suiciding. They need an ancient ancestor or other conquerors to stop him.” A big shot played devil’s advocate.

“Them being occupied with each other might give everyone a chance. Plus, the alliance is dealing with the dynasty as well, I wonder how well they’ll be able to keep up.” Someone else wanted to take advantage of the opportunity.

“Boom!” As the duo was rampaging through the ranks, a boundless gale with immense power sent them back several steps.

Two youths landed and blocked the duo’s path - one male, one female.

The former wore a golden robe and was surrounded by the wind affinity. This made his robe flutter even though there was no actual wind. It appeared that anyone who approaches him would get blown away instantly.

The female cultivator was beautiful enough to make flowers wither in shame. Her movements brimmed with nobility. She wore a light yellow dress - making her look magnanimous. Though it was loose, her curvy figure could still be seen.

“Eight-hundred Li Dominator and Princess Sima.” Many youths recognized the two newcomers.

“Two of the Six Prodigies, impressive indeed.” A big shot became envious of True Immortal. It simply had an exceptional young generation.

“They might be a part of True Immortal but they came from the Sima and Eighty-thousand Li Nightsky.” Someone else elaborated. These two powers were tributaries to True Immortal.

Princess Sima’s full name was Sima Hanshan. The clan was no stranger to anyone since it was a dao lord lineage thanks to Worldraiser Dao Lord.

Unfortunately, the dao lord died shortly after becoming one. This remained a mystery.

Eight-hundred Li Dominator hailed from Eighty-thousand Li Nightsky, also known as Eighty-thousand Li Court. It had deep ties with True Immortal since the last disciple of Blessed Dao Lord, Eighty-thousand Li, was its progenitor. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Eighty-thousand Li was brilliant, standing shoulder to shoulder with the dao lord of that generation.

He originated from Sky Hut before joining Blessed Dao Lord. With his godly talent, he managed to master one of the dao lord’s supreme scripture - Blessed Eighty Thousand Li.
