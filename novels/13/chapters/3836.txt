Chapter 3837: Seer Watch

On the second day, it became known that the Seer Watch would start a heaven observance ceremony.

This caused quite a stir because no one expected this. This sect had a history as deep as the Biandu in Black Wood Cliff. In fact, some believed that it has been around for even longer than the holy ground.

However, this sect didn’t have as much authority and power as the Biandu. To a certain extent, it served as a religious symbol for the regional inhabitants.

It only had a single peak and lacked properties. It survived with the help and offerings of its followers.

Nonetheless, it was arguably more influential than the Biandu, especially when taking the wild kingdoms and the holy ground into account.

Its main focus was astrology and divination, not cultivation. Rumor has it that its root could be traced back to a seering clan back in the ancient era. The majority of its members were heart ghosts. This particular race had a unique advantage when it came to divination.

In this region and even the eight kingdoms, everyone knew how important this ceremony was. It included reading the future and the overarching momentum of the world.

Thus, many sects and experts would come to watch the ceremony. They wanted to learn more and prepare for the future.

Due to the importance of the event, the sect would usually announce the date of a ceremony quite early, usually a year or so.

Today, it chose to perform one without any warning. Both outsiders and the locals found this startling.

Only those in the city received this information fast enough. The holy ground and the eight kingdoms were too far away.

“Isn’t this too sudden? Why today?” Numerous small clans and sects became confused.

“The Grand Seer is directing it this time.” The second piece of news shocked people more than the first.

“What?!” Even the Biandu couldn’t believe it.

“What’s the implication behind this?” One ancestor asked.

“The Grand Seer has been reclusive for so many years, why is he taking charge now?” All the big shots at the cliff found this astonishing.

The Grand Seer was nothing short of a legendary character. Rumor has it that he had lived for a long time, possessing a peerless divination ability. He had predicted several important events correctly.

For example, Eight Stallion Dao Lord had the pleasure of meeting him once during his youth. The Seer then used his divination and claimed that he would become the next dao lord. Sure enough, the prophecy came true.

Another example happened with a correct guess of the next tidal recession. Because of this, Buddha Supreme came early and built a defensive line at Black Wood Cliff ahead of time. Otherwise, the damages would have been far worse.

As the Seer grew older, he made fewer appearances and stopped presiding over the ceremony. The juniors took over afterward, hence everyone’s astonishment today.

“A disaster is coming?” One big shot murmured.

They thought about what happened with Black Tides last night and felt something ominous coming. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Fortunately, the third news pertained to the reason for this ceremony - the arrival of a heavenly genius.

Many heaved a sigh of relief. They thought that this ceremony was meant to predict Black Tides’ next move. This didn’t seem to be the case.

Nonetheless, this still took them by surprise.

“What kind of genius is worthy of the Grand Seer’s time?” An expert wondered.

Most found this unbelievable after thinking about it. So the coming of this genius was even more significant than a potential tidal recession?

“Don’t tell me... the Grand Seer is trying to predict the next dao lord just like he did for Eight Stallion Dao Lord.” An ancestor boldly speculated.

What else could be more significant than seeing the world’s future or Black Tides’ next move? Perhaps only the future dao lord.

“Which youth is it? Who will be considered the heaven’s favorite?” A big shot calmly said.

Currently, the locals immediately thought of someone famous in their region - the young lord of the Biandu with the title of Three Slashes.

“Three Slashes’ grand dao is finished, he should be peerless even when compared to the ones in the holy ground. If we’re strictly talking about Black Wood, it has to be him.” An important character predicted.

“You’re right if we’re limiting it to our region. But, the Wild Child of the East and the young lord of Righteous Sect are both brilliant.”An ancestor shook his head.

Because Black Wood was located at the border, it was always late in receiving the newest information from the mainland. The locals had no idea about recent events.

“Let’s go take a look.” Many came to the Seer Watch in order to witness the ceremony.

“What if I’m fortunate enough to be chosen as the heavenly genius? Doesn’t that mean my potential is limitless?” One talented youth started fantasizing. His peers also did the same.

They all knew that their talents and background didn’t matter. Whoever was chosen by the Grand Seer would become the jewel of their sect and clan.

That’s why the youths rushed over, as excited as can be.

“Young Master, rumor has it that this ceremony is extremely magical. Let’s go see what this Grand Seer will say.” Yang Ling couldn’t wait to see the mysterious event.

“The Grand Seer is extraordinary, he is gifted at astrology. Many big shots want to ask him for help only to be refused.” The old servant nodded his head.

“A descendant of the Heaven Calculating Clan?” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Sure, why not?”

He naturally knew about the Heart Ghost Tribe along with the Heaven Calculating Clan. The latter, in particular, had a special connection to Li Qiye.

Others believed that this clan was no longer around.
