Chapter 5789: Lord Of The Ages

“Activate!” Nightmoon mustered everything she could out of her primordial fruit to empower her bronze bottle.

An image of a bronze giant appeared behind her. Although it was not the real thing, its size was nearly comparable to the colossal mech. An immortal liquid rushed out of the bottle and covered the existing defensive lines.

Moon Embrace, Azure Omniplate, and Crystalline Crab Bulwark of Indestructibility alone were unbreakable. However, the liquid condensed them into a single entity, tougher than ever before.

“Simply incredible.” Jiao Heng said before channeling his power, releasing his twelve wills and peerless anima power.

His excitement had no bounds as he recklessly sent power to activate the mech. The three thousand divine rings lit up, fully activated.

They came together as one and coiled around the mech’s arms, fusing into them. The power of an epoch was now contained within its arms.

The world trembled before its awakening even before the attack, unable to endure. Fortunately, Elder Galaxy contained everything within its expanse.

“So this is a true paragon artifact.” Demon and Light-dragon’s forces retreated hastily.

Sword, Nether, and Hao Hai stared at their current weapons. Progenitorial Dao Talisman, Trinity Origination Disk, and Divine Beast were one level lower, mere prototypes in comparison.

“Break!” The mech was ready for another smash and Jiao Heng gave the order.

Images of three thousand worlds appeared for a split second. They then exploded, sending everything back to the origin. The primordial blast temporarily blinded spectators.

Stars in the expanse were pulverized but the combined defense blocked it successfully.

“Again!” Jiao Heng looked like a child addicted to a game, not holding back on channeling more vitality and energy into the mech.

A flurry of smashes eventually left cracks on the empowered heavenly shield, causing the defenders to vomit blood.

“Boom!” A blast destroyed the shield and sent the defenders flying.

The mech didn’t stop there, still attempting to smash them. The sky turned dark as they witnessed the descending hands.

“Damn!” Their expression soured as there was no way out.

“Bam!” Someone appeared and stopped the smash with a single hand imbued with the river of time.

“Sacred Teacher!” The crowd yelled out his title. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Sacred Teacher!” Jiao Heng’s eyes gleamed after seeing him.

“Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng.” Li Qiye smiled.

Everyone held their breath after seeing Li Qiye. Jiao Heng was certainly powerful but they didn’t quite fear him. The paragon artifact was the issue.

Nevertheless, he somehow drew out the full power of the mech - something Light-dragon’s group might not be able to do.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Sacred Teacher and lord of the ages.” Jiao Heng said.

“The pleasure is mine, emperor who has never tasted defeat.” Li Qiye said.

“Haha, everyone says you’re quite an interesting person, we must take advantage of this rare opportunity and spar.” Jiao Heng couldn’t contain his excitement.

“If you insist, I shall entertain you, in which manner do you wish to spar?” Li Qiye smiled.

Jiao Heng appeared and patted the mech: “I’ve seen plenty of divine artifacts in the past but none is as fun as this one, it is unique and fun, I shall use it against you today.”
