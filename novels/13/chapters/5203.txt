Chapter 5204: Take The Coffin Away Already

Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The sudden ambush from the ghost only served as an interlude. The other apex cultivators didn’t bother because they understood that the greatest merchant in the world was not one to be trifled with.

“Haha, didn’t this belong to you?” The old man in the courtyard said without opening his eyes.

Li Qiye smiled while looking at the ship once known as Sea Conch. He had refined it numerous times and turned it into an incredible artifact. Why did the brat have it now?

“Boom!” Deeper into Dao Alliance, a sun rose and illuminated all directions.

Next came a loud blast, resulting in the mark of a sun on one of the thrones.

“Azure School, one spot.” An imposing voice said.

“What? Why aren’t they with Dao Alliance?” Some listeners became confused.

“Azure School is rising thanks to Xiao Qingtian.” An ancient ancestor: “Do they want to rule Dao Alliance again?”

“I don’t see why not.” A big shot from Dao Alliance whispered: “Dao Alliance was started by Illumination Conqueror, it’s just that emperors from Eight Desolaces have taken over.”

There was a hint of indignation in his voice.

“Yes, if we were back in our golden age under Illumination Conqueror, Heaven and Divine Alliance wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant now. We would massacre The Race.” A dragon lord from Dao Alliance agreed.

Dao Alliance was currently under the leadership of All-things Dao Lord. However, he wasn’t its founder.

In a distant era, Illumination Conqueror fought the alliances alone before eventually forming Dao Alliance with allies who shared the same ideology.

Dao Alliance was immensely strong and forced The Race back. However, the conqueror suddenly left Dao Alliance and started Azure School.

Nonetheless, Azure School remained an ally of Dao Alliance. It had led Dao Alliance for some generations as well.

No one understood why Illumination Conqueror left during Dao Alliance’s golden age.

According to the legend, the conqueror’s final phrase before leaving was: “The majority of you have forgotten your aspiration.”

Because of this, most speculated that the conqueror quarreled with the other members, resulting in the separation.

Today, Dao Alliance already had a spot. Why did Azure School take one as well? Wouldn’t this be going against All-things Dao Lord?

Of course, others didn’t dare to comment on this sensitive matter.

“Amitabha.” A Buddhist light appeared in the distant Pure Land. It crossed through the realms and pulsed on top of a throne.

“Pure Land is in too.” Someone commented.

This was another power comparable to the four alliances. Apex Conquerors didn’t dare to be arrogant there.

It didn’t take long before more than half of the spots were taken. No one dared to compete with these behemoths either.

“You’re not joining the fun?” The old man asked with a smile.

“I would just take them if I actually care.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Always so shameless.” The old man said.

“At least I have more grace than you thieves.” Li Qiye commented before adding: “I’ll go outside for a bit.”

“You best hurry and take the coffin out, it’s occupying my grave.” The old man reminded.

“Of course, how can I do something so wretched? I’m just borrowing your grave for a bit.” Li Qiye said.

The old man was helpless or this would have been prevented from the start. He could only watch Li Qiye take over his spot.

“Creak.” Li Qiye opened the door and saw a youth standing outside.

True Bear was standing up and showed his fangs, ready to bite the youth at any moment. As for the old servant, he remained in the corner and didn’t pay attention.

When he saw Li Qiye, he finally made a move and appeared behind Li Qiye. True Bear ran over as well, still looking aggressive.

The youth was surprised to see this scene and scanned the three cultivators. This group of trio didn’t make sense.

“Dao Brother, I apologize for coming unannounced.” He bowed toward Li Qiye and said.

Although he dressed plainly, this exceptionally-handsome youth had eyes like stars and other impeccable features. His aura was strong as well, looking like a towering mountain. Nothing could get through him - a barrier of the cosmos.

“Impressive.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly.

“I forgot to introduce myself, how rude of me. My name is Li Zhitian. I arrived in the city just now and noticed the phenomena here, hence my unwelcome visit. I didn’t expect the door to be locked either.” The youth said.

Li Qiye didn’t react to the name. The same couldn’t be said for others since they would instantly become shocked and perhaps lost in admiration.

He came from Imperial Clan and was one of the three grand geniuses of the upper continents. Imperial was a pillar of Heaven Alliance, created by Crimson Emperor. Later on, it had notable figures such as Titanic Conqueror.

Crimson Emperor was one of the premier leaders of Celestial Court, leading The Race during Immemorial Epoch War.

Titanic Conqueror was impressive as well, defeating Dao Alliance in the upper continents and even attacking Immortal Dao City in the immortal continent.

Now, Li Zhitian was rumored as a genius capable of following in their footsteps. In spite of his age, he already possessed twelve sacred fruits, completely overshadowing his peers.

“I’m a guest as well.” Li Qiye smiled.

Li Zhitian cupped his fist and said: “I cannot imagine the wondrous affinities contained in those phenomena, may I ask who is staying in this courtyard?”

When he first came, he saw the mighty bear which was surprising enough. However, he couldn’t even push the door open - something more startling.
