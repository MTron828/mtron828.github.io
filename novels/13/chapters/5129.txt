Chapter 5130: Swift

“Conqueror, join us, we shall build something great together.” The monarch asked again.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I have no interest in your alliance and definitely no love for your guardian. Come back later when there is someone else in charge.” True Bear laughed.

“I’m afraid you won’t be able to wait until then. If you refuse, True Bear Mountain shall be no more.” The monarch’s tone became threatening.

“Rise and fall are inevitable.” True Bear said: “I will not join Heaven Alliance.”

“So be it, I will send you on your way then.” The monarch uttered coldly.

With that, a sword ray shot into the sky and illuminated the region. From then, it split into numerous strands of sword energy and began striking the mountain range.

“Ahh!” The demon survivors were no longer as lucky.

They tried everything and couldn’t survive the slashes. Gigantic demons were decapitated and dismembered. Blood gushed into the air before raining down and forming rivers.

Though many of these demon monarchs were powerful, they still couldn’t touch a dragon lord and met their demise.

“Raa!” True Bear Conqueror roared and grew larger in size, releasing all of his power. His laws turned into a great barrier in order to stop the rampant sword energies.

Alas, his full power still couldn’t protect his followers from being slaughtered. In fact, due to his larger frame, he was struck the most. Deep gashes could be seen all over his body.

“Activate!” True Bear spewed out a moon. It floated up into the air and became resplendent.

His dao fruit activated like a blossoming lotus to empower the moon, causing it to become several times stronger. The stars in the sky paled in comparison.

“Lunar Salutation!” He utilized his supreme grand dao in order to slow his enemy down.

As the rays of the moon descended, anyone caught would become petrified. Some tried to run; others used their defensive treasures. Alas, no one could stop the petrification process. They turned into statues first before crumbling into pieces.

The sword rays from the monarch were also petrified. However, its master was a six-fruit dragon lord so he wasn’t afraid.

“Soaring Immortal Slash!” The monarch roared and pierced through the conqueror’s laws instantly.

The moonlight capable of slowing down time receded from the battlefield, unable to withstand the trajectory of the sword thrust.

“Boom!” Even the moon itself was pierced through completely. Next was the conqueror’s chest.

The pale conqueror fell to the ground. This was the monarch’s strongest move and he couldn’t stop it.

Nonetheless, he still survived due to his dao fruit - damaged yet still around.

The monarch looked down at the dying demon and said: “It is not too late to surrender.”

“Ha…haha…” The conqueror struggled and got back on his feet. He shouted: “I, True Bear, would rather die than become a hound for Heaven Alliance!”

The monarch’s eyes flashed coldly as he didn’t show any mercy. He tossed his sword in the air and it automatically performed the finishing move.

“Clank!” This was enough to split the conqueror’s dao fruit and body into two halves.

In this crucial moment, Li Qiye smiled and flicked his finger.

“Clank!” The divine sword in the air was repelled by an ultimate force. Soaring Sword Monarch was sent flying as well.

This gave True Bear enough time to run toward the mountain range and disappear from sight.

“We’re leaving!” Soaring Sword Monarch spat out blood and decided to flee instead of pursuing his target.

The survivors from Heavenly Sword flew back to their battleship for a full retreat.

It didn’t take long for peace to return to True Bear Mountain. Alas, the stench of blood remained.

Broken peaks, dismembered corpses, rivers of blood…the magnificent sect was no more.

The surviving demons also ran from their home. Only insignificant and young demons lingered around. They wouldn’t be able to revitalize the sect.

Li Qiye observed the destruction while shaking his head. As he was leaving, a middle-aged swordsman appeared above the region.

“I’m too late, True Bear is finished. Heaven Alliance was swift this time.” He wore a cowl, only revealing his jade-like skin and exceedingly bright eyes.
