The re-created Luminous Master was still the same, a peerless progenitor. He didn’t show signs of pessimism nor dejection after losing. His temperament and style were still as dominating as ever.

Cheers, shouts, and other emotional exclamations could be heard. Some were in awe at the thirteen palaces’ abilities and Fiercest’s magnanimity in this case. Only someone like this was worthy of being considered number one.

“Fiercest has the heart of a peerless progenitor, he’s suitable to take charge.” One ancestor said.

“Well, there are great aspects of him that should be imitated.” Those who didn’t like him before had to admit that he had made a good choice.

Many considered Fiercest to be invincible right now on top of showing mercy and compassion when applicable.

Luminous Master would never kneel to anyone but today was an exception. He got on his knees and said: “My gratitude is boundless since you have given me a second life. If you ever need me or Immortal Bronze Mountain’s help in the future, just say the words.”

Creek King and the members of Immortal Bronze also bowed towards Li Qiye - a magnificent and enviable scene.

A progenitor had pledged his allegiance, the same with his sect - truly a mighty and useful force.

Fiercest alone was unbeatable enough but he had plenty of supporters too - Academy of Light, True Dragon Court, Longevity Hall, and Immortal Bronze as well.

He would have no problem ruling Immortal Lineage and the two other worlds at the moment.

“Three Immortals has a new ruler now.” One spectator quietly said.

The ones here believed that no one would try to stop Li Qiye from taking over. They were powerless anyway.

Fiercest didn’t need to conquer the individual realms because he had become a crownless king with total authority. No one would dare to disobey him.

Back in Sky Pass, many experts and even the ancestors also got on their knees. Those who didn’t like him still lowered their head to show subservience.

Fiercest stood there calmly as others paid their respect. He didn’t exert any pressure on the crowd since it wasn’t necessary.

They wholeheartedly respected an existence with thirteen palaces that can defeat progenitors.

“Rise, no need for this.” Li Qiye glanced around before nodding.

“We can have peace of mind now that there is a master like you in charge of Three Immortals. It’s time to retire for me.” Luminous Master stood up and said, slightly emotional.

The comment garnered decent support. Because Fiercest was so powerful, everyone else in this generation paled in comparison. No wonder why Luminous Master felt an urge to be reclusive.

“I’m only a passerby, coming here in a hurry and will be leaving just as quickly. I won’t leave anything or do anything for this world. It is still yours and it requires your effort and protection.” Li Qiye shook his head. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Dao Brother, this normal world can’t hold you. If there are immortals, ascension is only a matter of time for you.” Luminous Master understood Li Qiye and eventually said.

Some Everlastings jolted after hearing this. It was a topic rarely discussed in public.

There are limits to their growth. What was next after reaching this point? Many sages and progenitors chose to enter Uncrossable Expanse, hoping that there was a path towards ascension. Of course, this was nothing more than mere speculation.

“There are no immortals.” Li Qiye refrained from delving into this topic since there was no need.

The progenitor carefully thought about it before nodding. He let out a sigh and said: “You’re right, this world still needs us.”

“Yes.” Li Qiye smiled. A conversation with a smart man was so easy.

He turned his attention towards the depth of the continent with a gaze profound enough to pierce through the entire thing.

“What kind of artifact is it?” Luminous Master stared in the same direction.

“It came from an ancient age.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “As you said, this thing has a deep connection to your sect. Take a look later. See if you can benefit from it.”

“I’ll try.” Luminous Master didn’t dare to be careless at this mysterious continent.

Li Qiye finally started moving deeper into this place, the master right behind him.

“Fiercest is going to take that immortal artifact.” One spectator enviously said.

“What is it? A grass that can give immortality? Or an immortal fruit?” Discussions sprung up all around.

People surely desired this artifact capable of boosting a progenitor to the next level. However, the competition was Fiercest right now. To provoke him right now meant courting death regardless of one’s backing and power.

“So if this continent has deep ties with Immortal Bronze, it must be extremely old. Immortal Bronze is one of the oldest races in our world, some believe that they were around during the era of the three immortals.” One person speculated.

This made people exchange glances because this era belonged only in myths and speculations.

No one denied that the Immortal Bronze Race was old but the exact timeline remained unknown. The members of this race themselves had no idea.

“I’m so damn curious.” Another said while patiently waiting.

Zhe Long and Creek King became tense as well. They have analyzed and understood this continent more than the others. However, numerous unsolvable mysteries remained.

They couldn’t open certain places, hence the lack of harvest. However, they believed that Li Qiye should know how to unlock these secrets, having absolute confidence in him.

This was especially true for Luminous Master. He watched Li Qiye’s entry and noticed something, slightly raising his brows and his expression became dignified.

Others noticed the change in his expression but didn’t see anything special.
