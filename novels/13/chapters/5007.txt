Chapter 5008: Magnificent Banquet

The scene before them wouldn’t be considered special elsewhere in the lower continents. However, this was Demon.

They saw a succession of towering buildings and grand palaces culminating in the appearance of a great kingdom.

This was not a rare sight even in a place like Chaos. There were still powerful kingdoms and cities in that conflict-stricken realm.

Alas, Demon was inhabited by demons and beasts. The culture of men hasn’t extended this far so this place was a unique exception.

Goldcrest’s Phoenix City was already impressive and rare enough. Alas, it seemed like a village compared to this kingdom.

Most importantly, Phoenix still had traces of wilderness with statues of birds and beasts. Totems could be seen as well. The same didn’t apply to the city before them.

It looked exactly the same as another location in the outside world. It was also filled with human cultivators. They chose to stay for a long period or even started sects here.

“I didn’t know there was a place like this in Demon.” Ming Shi said while observing the palaces. They looked magnificent and civilized.

“This is Golden Cicada City, one of the miracles in the Ten Great Mountains. It is naturally the largest city here.” Goldcrest said with admiration: “This is why everyone respects the king. Not only did he build this great city, he also managed to make the beasts and demon monarchs more civilized. Furthermore, he maintained a strong relationship with the other dao lineages and bring cultivators from the outside here, big shots included.”

“It’s a proper path, a way to help demons prosper.” Yunyun said.

In the Ten Great Mountains, demons and beasts could do as they pleased - a true dog-eat-dog world. There was nothing holding them back from fighting and killing.

Golden Cicada was different. Its king recruited numerous disciples and started an unprecedented civilization in the wilderness.

“Building this city is easy.” Li Qiye assessed the situation: “The difficulty lies in changing the nature of beasts and demons. The Ten Great Mountains are vast and have no lack of natural resources. Powerful demon monarchs and colossal beasts are produced here but without shedding their violent instincts, they will never be able to reach the end of the grand dao and achieve supreme success.”

“When we’re just talking about changing the culture, he might be more accomplished than the commanding gods.” Goldcrest lowered his voice.

This was a disrespectful comment for a worshipper to make. Nonetheless, he thought highly of Golden Cicada King.

Once they entered the city, they became increasingly impressed by its splendor and prosperity. In fact, even humans started inhabiting the city and multiplied for generations now.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

How could this be a part of Demon? There were stores and merchants instead of hungry beasts searching for prey.

“Hmm, there are many outsiders today.” Goldcrest noticed something different.

Cultivators from the other great lineages were present, many of whom were big shots and ancestors.

After talking with some passersby, he found out that there was a banquet at the main palace for important cultivators. They recalled Li Qiye being invited by the king himself but Li Qiye refused.

“I heard Bloodfly God will be here too, this is special because commanding gods seldomly show up.” Goldcrest said.

Ming Shi was excited and left to communicate with her sect members. A while later, she returned with a beaming smile: “Hehehe, I’ll have you all know that this isn’t just a simple banquet. Golden Cicada King has two golden sources and he wants to let everyone else see them.”

“What is his goal?” Yunyun found this rather strange.

“Interesting.” Li Qiye said: “Shadowrider’s traces are blocked by the stench of blood. It looks like I have to see your commanding god then.”

“Bloodfly God…” Goldcrest shuddered while putting on a forced smile: “He’s a little different since he’s in charge of Bug. This deity branch isn’t like the others.”

“How so?” Ming Shi asked.

“Well, I heard that he likes to suck blood. This is just a rumor, I haven’t seen it myself.” Goldcrest said, not wanting to gossip about another commanding god.

“Sounds like a villain.” Ming Shi snorted.

“Let’s go take a look and we’ll find out soon enough as long as Shadowrider is here in Golden Cicada.” Li Qiye smiled.

Goldcrest had no choice but to lead the way for Li Qiye. Alas, he felt that nothing good would come from this for Bloodfly God regardless of his power.

The main palace of Golden Cicada was packed to the brim with demons and cultivators from all over the world.

Famous big shots sat in the main positions. For example, Swordgrasp Venerable, Tendril King, and Jun Cuican…

Cuican never hid his aura and let it roam free. This annoyed some of the guests but they didn’t do anything since he was stronger.

Tendril King, on the other hand, hid her aura. Nonetheless, everyone still kept a distance and only admired her from afar. Her regal presence exceeded all of theirs, hence the need to be subservient.

As for Swordgrasp Venerable, a sword intent was always looming. No one dared to get close because the remnant energy rays could pierce their heart.
