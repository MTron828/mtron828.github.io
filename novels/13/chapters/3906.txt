Chapter 3907: Sword Harmonization Box

Though infuriated by the contempt, both Sword Hero and the Praetor maintained their composure. They had enough experiences on-and-off the battlefield to always stay calm.

Nonetheless, they must kill the two animals in order to keep their reputation and prestige.

“So arrogant.” An expert from Righteous said.

“Like master, like pet. This is to be expected.” His ancestor smiled wryly while shaking his head.

Others agreed because they have seen Li Qiye’s imperious style before. It seemed that he wasn’t the only one. His entire group seemed to share the same characteristic.

“Are the Sacred Lord’s pets from Sacred Mountain too?” Those from the holy ground had no problem with this group’s arrogance.

The Sacred Lord was the ultimate existence in the south. Only Righteous Supreme could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him. Therefore, his attitude couldn’t be considered arrogance.

“I haven’t heard of Sacred Mountain grooming any divine beast. Maybe this is the case, it’s just that we don’t know since we’ve never been there.” An ancestor from a large sect responded.

“Sacred Mountain is the ultimate auspicious ground in our land, the chaos energy there is immensely dense. Having divine beasts there makes sense.” A national teacher said confidently.

Few in the holy ground have visited Sacred Mountain. The four grandmasters were fortunate to do so according to rumors. Some believed that Archaic Sun King before his coronation went there as well. Others included Guan Tianba and Righteous Supreme.

Because of this, though everyone knew about Sacred Mountain, there weren’t many details about this area. The crowd wondered whether Black and Yellow were from there.

“An auspicious place like that should have auspicious beasts.” Most nodded in agreement. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Hmm, they look like king-level chaos primal beasts.” On the other hand, an old ancestor observed the beasts for a while before suggesting, albeit without confidence.

“Show me what you can do then!” Sword Hero shouted but didn’t dare to underestimate Black after seeing its power.

“Boom!” He activated his power and released twelve palaces. Chaos energy engulfed the area around him.

However, the twelve palaces didn’t float above his head. They started spreading towards all four directions.

“My brave warriors! Follow me to hell itself!” Sword Hero roared.

“To hell itself!” The three thousand loyal soldiers shouted with great bloodthirst.

“Rumble!” They all released their fate palaces as well. More than ten thousand palaces floated magnificently in the air.

They started connecting with each other while relying on Sword Hero’s twelve palaces as the cores. A great city came into being.

“Clank!” Sword Hero then took out a sword box. The moment it appeared, numerous sword hymns could be heard.

“Sword Harmonization Box, didn’t Sacred Mountain give this to Vajra?!” A big shot was shocked to see it.

“Right, it is for their administrative contribution.” An ancestor nodded.

This box wasn’t from a dao lord but was still an ancient artifact with incredible power.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The swords belonging to the spectators started ringing and shaking.

Meanwhile, the soldiers behind Sword Hero transformed under the effect of the box. They turned into three thousand divine swords of various colors - blood red, dark red like pills, blue like the ocean...

These swords then fused with the box, causing it to be pulsing with bright rays just like the sun.

“Sword Dao, heed my commands and turn into a citadel!” Sword Hero chanted and released fiery sword rays. The rays could sweep through an army easily. The crowd became frightened and retreated.

He eventually turned into a divine sword himself, looking like the king of the blades. This sword also joined the box like the rest.

“What are they doing?” The spectators became confused.

The box floated into the city made from their palaces and hovered in the center, slowly materializing into a divine sword as well.

Loud sword hymns and bright flashes detonated, giving off a world-ending impression. A derivation of the sword dao initiated and the divine sword started spinning.

Its majestic sword dao became one with the city, empowering the walls with the sword affinity.

“Clank!” The sword citadel had numerous sword dao and sharp energies circling around it. Sword Hero and his soldiers utilized the box to start a supreme sword dao. They relied on their fate palaces to create the physical structures of a city. They then combined the two to form an entity capable of ending the world.

“I’ve never seen this before.” Experts became startled.

“This must be the supreme merit law he created.” A knowledgeable ancestor said.

No one knew the name of this technique since this might be its first appearance.

“Sword Citadel.” Finally, a talent from Vajra with close ties to Sword Hero revealed: “He took one thousand years of meditation to create this merit law.”

This was the fruit of his training after losing the competition for the throne. It seemed that his time wasn’t wasted.

He trained three thousand soldiers and relied on the Sword Harmonization Box for this merit law.

It consisted of Sword Hero’s own power and his soldiers’ fate palaces. The end result was a mighty sword citadel capable of both offense and defense.

They would never lose as long as the citadel remained standing. Moreover, the floating sword dao around the walls were ready to attack at any moment.

Thus, Sword Hero was very pleased with his magnum opus.
