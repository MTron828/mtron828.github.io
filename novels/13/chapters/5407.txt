Chapter 5408: Primordial Dao Fruit

Immortal Pagoda Conqueror immediately displayed his dominance; the crowd had no chance of withstanding the pressure.

Ancient ancestors and lords dropped to their knees. Dragon lords and conquerors’ expressions soured.

The pressure was not aimed directly at them but it still felt as if the pagoda was smashing into them. They roared and activated their dao, realizing the gap in strength.

Of course, they already knew that only the other apex cultivators could stand up to Immortal Pagoda Conqueror. Alas, actually experiencing this grim reality made them lose their confidence.

Naturally, the person bearing the brunt was none other than Li Xian’er. She roared and released her dao and powers upward; her murderous intent manifested into a tsunami of swords.

“Boom!” The pagoda obliterated her dao and immobilized her.

She still tried her best to struggle. Murderous halos pulsed around her as she released her twelve dao fruits.

This still proved to be futile since her strongest state couldn’t push the pagoda back.

“Still as frightening as ever.” Ferocity commented since he had lost to Immortal Pagoda before and had a deep understanding of that treasure’s potential.

He was certainly powerful since he revealed his true power when fighting against Myriad Eye and Five-sun Dao Lord. Unfortunately, the best he could do against the pagoda was survive by running away.

In a real fight, his sacred tree would still not be enough to stop the conqueror. Nonetheless, he was impressed at Li Xian’er for lasting so long versus the pagoda.

Her twelve fruits allowed her to actually survive, albeit fully immobilized. It was only a matter of time before she would be reduced to fleshy bits and then dust specks.

“So this is the power of an apex conqueror with a primordial fruit.” Everyone was amazed.

“That fruit alone is enough to make someone be remembered in history.” A dao lord sighed and said.

Only one thing in the world was harder than dao fruits - a primordial one. Alas, there was no way of obtaining one through cultivation. It required sheer fortune and unknown circumstances.

Known primordial fruit owners included Immortal Pagoda, Luminous, and Nightmoon Conqueror. They themselves had no confidence in duplicating the feat if given a chance to cultivate a second time. Plus, just one primordial fruit was enough for them to contend against those with twelve fruits. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Currently, Immortal Pagoda Conqueror has yet to activate the power of his fruit yet he still has the upper hand against Li Xian’er. Everyone became jealous and envious of his luck.

“Boom!” Her back started bending; her forehead was covered in beads of sweat.

“Looks like it’ll be over soon.” A spectator took a deep breath.

At this crucial moment, someone gently lifted the pagoda up, allowing her enough time to quickly escape the suppressive force.

“Thank you for saving me, Young Noble.” She ran with lightning speed and then bowed toward her savior.

Everyone got a good look at the person stopping the pagoda - the devilish Li Qiye.

“He’s doing it with his bare hands!” An ancient ancestor shouted in astonishment.

This was something no conqueror would do. Just touching that pagoda would result in their hands exploding to bits.

Moreover, he didn’t imbue his hand with dao power and laws either, making it look so easy. Given his relaxed demeanor, the pagoda seemed as light as a feather.
