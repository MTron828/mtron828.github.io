Chapter 5186: Really?

The plant was near maturity and ready for the cauldron. What if it were to be damaged during the digging? The sect master’s cauldron would be delayed afterward.

“What is your nefarious intention in trying to ruin Her Majesty’s plant?” The saint child shouted.

“Your ignorance is raucous.” Li Qiye glanced at him.

The saint child trembled and turned red. As a famous doctor and alchemist, even dragon lords addressed him as “Dao Brother”. This contempt was unacceptable.

“I will not let you leave Alchemy Dao alive!” His eyes brimmed with murderous intent.

“Enough!” Gourdkeeper Monarch shouted at him.

“Junior Uncle, this man is outrageous…” The saint child said.

“If you can’t control your emotion, how will you lead later on?” He said.

The saint child immediately shut up, realizing his impropriety. He restrained his anger despite hating Li Qiye.

“What is your reason for digging up the plant?” The monarch asked Li Qiye.

“My reason? It is the culprit.” Li Qiye said.

“Hmph, more nonsense.” The saint child said: “The plant might be as red as fire but it is of the ice dao. Moreover, it is yet to be sentient and doesn’t have the power to release flames.”

“Yes, it is of the ice affinity while the culprit used true flames. This can’t be it.” The monarch said skeptically.

“The shallow understanding of dao agriculture leads to this. Even your sect master made this mistake.” Li Qiye said.

“How dare you insult Her Majesty?! Do you wish to provoke us?!” The saint child shouted before turning toward the saintess: “Junior Sister, your friend is insulting your master yet you stand there in silence. Your sin is not upholding the prestige of our sect.”

“Pop!” Li Qiye slapped him, knocking out his teeth and leaving his face bloody and swollen like a pig’s head.

“I am showing mercy out of consideration for your founder.” Li Qiye said.

“I’ll kill you!” The maddened saint child summoned a cauldron, wanting to burn Li Qiye to a crisp.

“Stop!” The monarch rushed over to stop the inferno while glaring at him: “If you insist on being out of control, I will send you into isolated reflection.”

“Junior Uncle… he attacked first…” The saint child said indignantly but stopped after seeing the monarch’s glare.

The monarch then spoke to Li Qiye: “You need to watch your words for they were insulting. If there is no good reason, we shall consider it as an act of deliberate contempt and will not let it go.”

The saintess became anxious and winked at Li Qiye. He had indeed insulted their sect and her master so she couldn’t speak up for him. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I am merely speaking the truth.” Li Qiye said: “Do you know why the phoenix’s crest is burning the garden?”

“It can’t be, once again, it is of the ice affinity.” The monarch said.

“Your skill is not refined enough, only aware of one aspect but are ignorant of the rest.” Li Qiye responded.

“I started learning alchemy at the age of eight, controlling a cauldron at sixteen, creating new medicines at twenty. I humbly claim to have learned seventy to eighty percent of our sect’s alchemy dao, whether it be pill refinement, healing, or agriculture. What about you?” The monarch didn’t accept the criticism.

He wasn’t as skilled as Jadecure Conqueror and his first brother, Panacea Monarch. However, he could compete with anyone else in the world.

“The problem is that you all have been focusing on pill refinement and medicines while ignoring agricultural alchemy, resulting in only knowing the bare surface.” Li Qiye said.

The monarch and the other disciples’ expression soured. He was right about the current focus but they were still confident in knowing how to take care of plants and medicines.

“That is a bold claim, I hope you can back it up, for your sake.” The monarch uttered coldly.

“Let me ask you then, when your sect master transplanted the phoenix’s crest, did she immerse the roots in the juice of a sacred mulberry, hundred-art wood, and locking-stone vine for at least ten years first?”

The monarch and saintess exchanged glances. After a brief moment, he shook his head: “No.”

“This is why I mentioned the lacking proficiency of your agricultural dao.” Li Qiye said.

“Do elaborate on the issue then.” The monarch didn’t appreciate the tone but could tell that Li Qiye was an alchemist with a focus on agriculture.

“Ever heard of slumbering flame-worms?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, a type of worm of the fire affinity yet grows in extreme cold climates.” The monarch responded.

“Well, there you go.” Li Qiye said.

“The phoenix’s crest is infected with slumbering flame-worms?” The monarch stared at him and said: “No, we are very meticulous when dealing with worms and insects. The very garden itself would have prevented this from happening.”

All of Alchemy Dao had a unique aura. It prevented worms and insects from entering without their permission. After all, foreign insects could cause devastating damage to the gardens.

“Your sect master brought it in, an amateurish mistake.” Li Qiye said.

The saintess winked at him again. How could he be so blunt toward a renowned conqueror?

“Please choose your words better.” The monarch said with a grave tone.

“Phoenix’s crests and slumbering flame-worms share the same environment. Occasionally, there would be eggs stuck to the roots, waiting for the plant to mature. When these eggs hatch, they will release true flames to the surrounding. Your sect master did not prepare the roots with the proper concoction so the eggs were still alive.”
