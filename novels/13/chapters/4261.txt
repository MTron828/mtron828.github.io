Chapter 4262: Futile

The city and the ancient emperor arrived quickly and left just as fast. The being was summoned by Vastsea Venerable but fled before doing anything.

What was the emperor afraid of? Li Qiye? Some thought that this might be the case. However, the appearance of the supreme beauty might have more to do with it than Li Qiye.

The attention shifted from Li Qiye to the mysterious woman - a being potentially strong enough to frighten an ancient emperor, something truly inconceivable.

An ancient emperor absolutely stood at the apex. Even the two overlords beseeched the emperor’s help.

There were many legends regarding the abilities of the past emperors. Plus, the monstrous aura earlier spoke plenty.

Many thought that this ancient being was comparable to their dao lords. This would imply that the woman just now was even stronger than dao lords.

“Who is she?” Knowledgeable characters examined the clues in history. Alas, they couldn’t come up with a matching female figure.

“If that ancient emperor was afraid of her, it means that she might be stronger than even dao lords.” A king brought this up.

Others exchanged glances and doubted this statement. The invincibility of dao lords was ingrained in their culture and common sense.

Regardless of the period, the dao lord of that generation would be the strongest cultivator. How could there be someone else higher than a dao lord?

Unfortunately, no one had an answer regarding her identity.

“Looks like you’re left disappointed. Your backer isn’t of use.” Li Qiye broke the silence with a casual tone.

People stopped thinking and focused up again. The venerable’s ace card didn’t come into fruition since the emperor fled.

He thought that there was a chance of the emperor being able to kill Li Qiye. This would avenge their fallen disciples on top of getting rid of a nightmare for their sect. Thus, the duo was ready to pay a monstrous price. Now, they were lost in despair after losing again and again.

This was truly vexing since they weren’t used to the taste of defeat. Their dao journey had been too easy and smooth sailing until they reached the top.

In their entire life, setbacks and defeats could be counted with one’s hand. Alas, Li Qiye shattered their confidence today.

As for the spectators, too many twists and turns happened in a short period. They thought that the overlords were going to win for sure when in reality, the opposite happened.

The duo looked dejected. They still had other cards up their sleeve but have decided to give up.

“The winner takes all.” The decrepit vajra emotionally said.

“There is nothing to say for we have lost. Take our heads.” The venerable smiled bitterly.

The two looked hours away from death, no longer domineering like before. The crowd was sympathetic since the old men looked so weak and pathetic. Mighty masters have become losers; no one could remain at the top forever.

“Isn’t it a little too late to come to this realization?” Li Qiye smiled.

The duo’s expression darkened while everyone else was moved. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“The winner takes all” was euphemistic. More often than not, the consequences of losing were extreme.

“What do you want then?!” The venerable roared, looking more pitiful than commanding.

“Hmm, you tell me.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Isn’t it enough that we are accepting defeat and death?” The vajra said.

The lucky survivors from Nine-wheel and Sea Emperor lamented and cried after seeing their mighty ancestors reduced to this pathetic state.

They had never surrendered nor showed despair until today.

“This can’t end with you accepting defeat, you know better than that given your long reign. If I were to lose, would my life alone be enough?” Li Qiye chuckled.

The answer was rather obvious to the crowd. In the case of defeat, even if Li Qiye were to offer his head, it wouldn’t have been enough to appease the two behemoths and their allies.
