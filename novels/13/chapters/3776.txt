Chapter 3777: Buddha's Six Paths

The scion activated his draconic defense, ready to take on his enemy.

“Amitabha.” Golden Cicada placed his palms together and solemnly chanted: “Oh Merciful Buddha.”

After the chant, his kasaya became resplendent and a Buddhist aura enveloped him.

He seemingly disappeared from sight before being replaced by a Buddha. In reality, he was still the same as before. However, his dignified expression and aura made him look like someone else, no longer being the same carefree and unrestrained monk.

Moreover, his kasaya was famous for being dirty and greasy everywhere. Now, the light has washed it clean.

Despite his young face, he still fitted the role of a sacred monk as if he was the reincarnation of Buddha.

The Buddhist light seeped through his skin and into his body. He seemed to no longer be made from flesh and blood, having been turned into a golden statue with a holy aura.

Not to mention the young cultivators, even ancestors were impressed with his current form. In fact, the weaker youths felt their knees buckling, wanting to prostrate and join Buddhism.

The meat-and-wine transgressor was gone, replaced by a dignified monk.

“Nice!” The scion laughed and crossed through space to appear before the monk.

The latter retaliated right away with a finger strike. Buddhist affinity materialized beneath his feet. He seemed to be standing in an ocean of Buddhism now and all of its power channeled through his finger, turning into a supreme grand dao.

“Boom!” He seemed to be pointing out the flaws and mistakes of all living beings. The gods and spirits would follow his lead.

“Creation Point, one of the six paths!” An ancestor shouted in astonishment.

“Boom!” The finger struck the scion and sent him flying, breaking through numerous peaks before creating a pit on the ground.

The crowd became slack-jawed from the first exchange. Some rubbed their eyes or pinched themselves to check that it wasn’t a dream.

“Is this really happening?” Even an older expert thought he was seeing things.

“How... he sent the scion flying with one finger strike...” Another spectator couldn’t believe it.

Their disbelief was understandable due to the perceived power difference. The scion has left a deep impression after taking down Hu Ben’s legion and the fortress.

Both Golden Cicada and Hu Ben were part of the four geniuses. The former was also the youngest so this result didn’t make sense.

“Creation Point is one of Buddha’s Six Paths.” A big shot from the last generation took a deep breath. [1]

The six paths were top merit laws created by the holy ground’s progenitor, Buddha Dao Lord. This art belonged to Sacred Mountain and Golden Cicada shocked everyone by using it.

Even the Vajra Dynasty, the current ruling power, didn’t have these merit laws. On the other hand, Heavenly Dragon Temple taught the youth these great techniques.

“Heavenly Dragon Temple has always been trusted by Sacred Mountain.” An ancestor from another sect became jealous.

No other sects in the holy ground enjoyed this privilege. Alas, it was also understandable. The temple has been absolutely loyal to Sacred Mountain throughout the years, always supporting it regardless of the situation.

“This finger strike is insanely powerful.” Another spectator found it hard to calm down.

A traveler who had been to Myriad Beast Mountains found this strange: “The Buddhist child got stronger way too fast in such a short time.”

He saw the young monk in action back in the valley. However, the guy wasn’t as powerful compared to his current self.

“His cultivation didn’t increase that fast.” A high elder explained: “This is the territory of Heavenly Dragon Temple. It’s brimming with Buddhist affinity and power.”

Everyone agreed with this assessment. Just think about it, the Buddhist child grew up here and cultivated supreme Buddhist laws, being extremely familiar with the affinities present.

Thus, just one wave of his hand could command considerable power from the land.

“No wonder why he said something about favorable conditions earlier.” An expert realized. Having the home-court advantage was quite beneficial.

“Bam!” The scion got out of the rubble.

This wasn’t surprising. People thought that no one in this world could kill him with one finger. They also noticed that his draconic guard wasn’t fully penetrated. Its light flickered for a bit before recovering.

“That defensive technique is exceedingly difficult to break.” An ancestor commented.

He might have lost the exchange earlier but it didn’t mean anything.

“Creation Point is impressive indeed.” The scion praised.

“How embarrassing, I borrowed the power of the land here to make up for my shallow cultivation yet still didn’t accomplish anything.” Golden Cicada calmly answered.

It seemed that the monk wanted to break the draconic guard with the power of the land. Unfortunately, the actual power difference between the two was considerable. He only managed to send the scion flying without inflicting serious injuries. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Because you’re younger than me. Maybe you’ll be even stronger than me when you reach my age.” The scion admitted his opponent’s potential.

The listeners nodded in agreement. Golden Cicada Buddhist Child’s age was the thing holding him back the most.
