Chapter 5267: Can I Change My Last Name?

A stance capable of protecting the world for eternity. The flow of time and other cultivators couldn’t move him an inch.

“I’m starting.” The woman smiled and rushed forward, performing the same sweeping strike again.

“Bam!” He lost his footing but as he nearly touched the ground, he bounced back like a roly-poly toy and assumed the same stance again.

“Yes!” Li Zhitian shouted in jubilation.

The old servant felt the same way, thinking that he was able to stop her technique.

Alas, they celebrated too early because she performed a second variation and smashed him to the ground.

“Ah!” He nearly fainted from the pain and was fully immobilized.

Despite the seemingly-friendly grappling match, he had utilized his most profound dao. Her grappling skill seemed unbeatable.

“Impressive, few in this world are capable of blocking my first move.” The woman praised.

“I’ve embarrassed myself.” He endured the pain and smiled wryly, aware that he had no chance of stopping her.

“Losing to a technique that shouldn’t exist is nothing to be ashamed about. It is an honor to even block one move.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I agree.” He said, still yet to regain control of his body.

Li Qiye squatted down and started hitting and pulling the old man, reaching deep into the muscles. The pain caused the old servant to bellow.

“Thank you, Young Noble.” However, this freed him from the immobilization so he got up and bowed.

“Help me too, Young Noble.” Li Zhitian wasn’t shy and asked for help.

Li Qiye smiled and did the same, causing the youth to scream. Nonetheless, this saved him from being bedridden for a long period.

“You understand my technique?” The woman stared at Li Qiye.

“Just a little bit, after all, a turtle such as myself has lived for a long time.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Now I’m sure your last name is Li.” Her gaze was so intense that others might think that she was wanting to eat him alive.

“Can I choose not to be? Why do you insist on picking on me?” Li Qiye said wistfully.

“Because he’s the only one who understands it.” She seemed eager to reveal Li Qiye’s identity.

Normally, her expression could only be found on men who were staring at a supreme beauty.

“That arrogant guy?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes, the most shameless guy in the world, Li Qiye.” She said: “Enough of this, let’s fight already.”

“I’m trembling right now, let me drink some more first to muster my courage.” Li Qiye said.

The old servant brought a wine jar over. Li Qiye accepted and looked up to drink a mouthful before handing it over to the woman: “Want some?”

“Fine. Drink first before the fight.” She accepted and finished the entire jar herself.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Bam!” She threw the jar to the ground, breaking it into pieces.

“Okay, Li, let’s do this.” She gestured, looking a bit drunk.

“Can we not do this?” He shrugged.

“No, my life goal is beating all the Lis, especially that bastard Li Qiye.” She insisted: “Be a good boy now.”

She tied up her hair, always acting like a big sister regardless of who she was talking to.

“Fine, don’t blame me if you get hurt.” Li Qiye said.

“Rest assured, I’m the one dishing out the beating today.” She said domineeringly.

“I’ve heard this so many times but no one has been able to do it yet, I’m just too strong.” He sighed.

“This will change today.” She declared: “You’re about to be unrecognizable.”

“I suppose as a man, I can’t keep on refusing.” Li Qiye stepped forward.

“You don’t look like much of a man in my eyes.” She never held back with words.

Meanwhile, the spectators watched with bated breath.

Both the old servant and Li Zhitian had experienced her supreme grappling skill. Now, they placed their hope on Li Qiye and understood that this fight would be awfully beneficial for their dao.
