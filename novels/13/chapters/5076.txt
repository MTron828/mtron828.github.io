Chapter 5077: Heaven Summit

Some ancient ancestors that have been reclusive for eras actually showed up to watch this battle.

After all, this was a once-in-a-lifetime battle. Everyone tried to grab the best spot in order to observe the fight.

“Rumble!” A capable battalion appeared on the horizon and took up a vast area.

“Eight Stallion Dynasty’s here.” This prompted whispers among the spectators.

The battalion included big shots such as Venerable Dragon God, Northern Monarch, and even the new king.

This was surprising to some because they didn’t bring this many people to their previous king’s battle. Today, they brought virtually all the top masters of their dynasty to boost Li Qiye’s morale.

“The current Eight-stallion no longer has internal and external threats.” The big shots understood the reason.

Though Eight-stallion Dao Lord was no longer around, the dynasty was actually in a better position.

First, the Ten Monsters have nearly been wiped out by Li Qiye, not to mention the numerous ancient ancestors from the other great powers.

Skystomper God, Guardian Pagoda, Swordgrasp Venerable, Radiant Monarch… All of these five and six-fruit dragon lords have been slain.

Therefore, not many great powers currently could compete with Eight-stallion. The rest maintained neutrality and didn’t have an existing feud with Eight-stallion.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Seeing them made people sentimental. Not long ago, everyone thought that the dynasty was doomed after their king’s death but now, it was stronger than ever.

The reflective atmosphere was interrupted by a large figure manifesting into reality in the air.

Everyone shuddered and bowed in that direction while muttering: “Thousand-faced Sovereign.”

Few were as strong as him now in the present. One known figure was Stone Ox but that was about it.

Surprisingly enough, he wasn’t the strongest spectator because another aura permeated the scene and shocked everyone.

“Truth Dao Lord!” Many kneeled after her arrival to show respect.

Though she wasn’t as peerless as Conceal Conqueror, she was the only remaining conqueror in the lower continents. Thus, she loomed above everyone else.

She had hidden her aura in order to not alarm others. Alas, it still oozed out and alarmed everyone.

Silence took over after their appearance. A while ago, a few great powers might have had ulterior motives for the battle but this was no longer the case due to these mighty spectators.

The night of the full moon was finally here and the silence still remained.

Right at this second, a chilling presence crossed through the region and affected everyone down to their soul.

Venerable Dragon God and Thousand-faced Venerable trembled as well - this was something beyond their current level.

Truth Conqueror let out a sigh of admiration since she knew she was weaker after sensing the aura.

Once people calmed down, they noticed someone standing on top of the pinnacle - Conceal Conqueror.

Most kneeled from the sheer pressure even though she has yet to release her murderous intent. The top dragon lords also bowed their head to show respect; this included Truth Conqueror even though she didn’t need to.

Heaven Summit immediately became the greatest peak in the lower continents due to Conceal Conqueror’s presence.

Alas, as time passed, Li Qiye still didn’t show up. After a long while, some started complaining.

“He’s late, so arrogant!” One spectator mumbled.

As soon as these words were spoken, he felt gazes piercing him and immediately shut his mouth.

The top cultivators had no problem waiting, let alone a junior like him. Complaining now was idiotic.

“Seems like I’m a little late.” Eventually, a lazy voice could be heard.

“Li Qiye’s here.” For some reason, everyone heaved a sigh of relief after seeing him.

They felt the pressure lifted from Conceal Conqueror. The air was no longer as suffocating as before.

He took his time walking up the peak and captured everyone’s attention. Conceal Conqueror didn’t seem to mind his tardiness.
