Chapter 5547: Not Responsible

Sensing Momentous Dao was something beyond the ability of mortals and regular cultivators. Only characters such as Li Qiye and Niu Fen could do so.

The entire frontier was created by this dao; the creators then transformed into deities. The dao alone served as the land and the deities’ foundation. Living beings and the deities were connected through the dao.

This made the land impregnable and fertile; disasters simply didn’t happen here. Of course, there was no free lunch in this world. The payments were faith and prayers - something crucial to fuel this process.

“They knew this wasn’t an easy road yet they still embarked, a heroic feat indeed.” Li Qiye said softly.

In reality, these cultivators didn’t need faith to grow stronger. They had the choice to continue cultivating - the world was their oyster.

Momentous Frontier would become their prison in a sense. Only a few were willing to accomplish such a selfless goal.

Cultivators had protected the world in the past, whether it be the previous epochs or the current. However, they rarely focused on bettering the lives of living beings, especially mortals.

Protectors could always get tired of their task and move on. For example, Immortal Emperors left the nine worlds for the next journey, the same for the dao lords in Eight Desolaces. Immortal Emperor Di Yu and his comrades lacked the same freedom, and this was a conscious decision.

The group followed the extending runes and eventually the remote region full of beautiful forests and majestic mountain ranges. Each grass and tree was brimming with life.

They stopped before a peak with a pinnacle surrounded by fog and clouds.

“Right here.” Li Qiye glanced up and said: “The roots of harvest and the deity’s divinity originate from this place before spreading to the rest of Momentous Frontier.”

“Yes.” Niu Fen also sensed the peak’s majestic power.

“Open up, old geezer!” He shouted before raising his hand and summoning profound dao laws to knock on the peak.

“Boom!” Bright light circulated and took the form of a large gate. It also repelled Niu Fen’s rude knocking back to him since the peak was protected by numerous layers of barriers.

“This is his manor.” Niu Fen said.

“The abode of the Deity of Harvest.” Baifeng murmured.

Although she didn’t have the same devotion as the mortals, she still came from Momentous Frontier. Her family worshipped this deity, so she also had a special love for him.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Alas, the peak became silent and the deity didn’t appear.

“This old geezer is putting up an act.” Niu Fen knocked three more times, causing the entire peak to shake.

Given his power, he could uproot the entire mountain in spite of its barriers. Of course, he exercised restraint.

“Hey! My Young Master is here, come out and greet him already!” He shouted.

The Qin Clan Master’s jaw nearly dropped to the ground. This was his first time seeing something so powerful.

Alas, no one came out to greet them.

“Something’s wrong.” Niu Fen frowned because given the emperor’s power, he would certainly know about the guests and open the entrance.

“Not home.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Where is he then?” Baifeng asked.

“Young Master, would you like me to break down the door so we can take a look?” Niu Fen said eagerly, wanting to try breaking the tough barriers.

“We’re here as guests, not fighters.” Li Qiye shook his head and placed his palm on the entrance. His interference caused the runes of Momentous Dao to surface.

“It’s amazing how far they managed to derive this dao, anyone can cultivate it.” Niu Fen took a look and said.

“Because it’s meant for the mortal world.” Li Qiye said.

“Young Master, does this have any relationship with the Seven Laws of the Golden Age? Can you perform a quick derivation?” Niu Fen asked.

“Two branches of the same thing, derived differently by future generations.” Li Qiye explained: “Those who aim for the dao will see them as the seven laws. As for the ones here who saw the tablet, they established this version instead.”

“I see, then I won’t be the one to bear responsibility. I believe the seven laws started with Duck Egg. Of course, some had done research before him but he was the first to popularize it, and then Blessed. So if there are mistakes and misinterpretation of the original intention, that’s their fault.” Niu Fen chuckled.

He continued on without holding back: “This six continents thing is even more distant from our time. Mistakes lead to more mistakes in interpreting the dao source and now, we have the old geezers coming up with another path with Momentous Dao.”
