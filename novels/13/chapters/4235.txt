Chapter 4236: Vajra Wheel

The cultivator seemed to be made of gold after channeling his power. Even his widened eyes were golden.

He chanted and runes appeared around his fate palaces. They flowed beneath his feet and created a runic land encompassing a large region. They had the same golden luster as the rest.

This magnificent spectacle left the crowd in awe. The ocean was no longer there, replaced by a golden land with a great Buddha.

“Earthraiser Vajra.” Some murmured while realizing the reason for his title.

“That’s the Vajra Wheel.” An ancestor understood this technique and said: “His mastery of this wheel has reached a transcending level.”

Vajra was one of the six wheels from a heavenly scripture. Nine-wheel had access to three of them.

Earthraiser had cultivated this technique at a young age so his mastery was impeccable. This allowed him to become one of the five overlords.

“Impressive.” Hallowed City Lord couldn’t help but praise.

“Make your move, Fellow Daoist.” Earthraiser spoke calmly yet each word still instilled suffocating pressure.

“I’m starting!” Tie Jian roared. His sword erupted with boundless ashen light. This light wasn’t powerful sword energy but rather - a surging battle spirit fused with his vitality. The light eventually became a storm that would accompany the next slash.

The ravaging power of this heavenly sword and dao left everyone trembling with fear - a sense of helplessness while standing before a primal beast with its jaws opened.

The activation of the dao and the empowerment of the sword made Tie Jian seem as if he was possessed by a war god. One slash could take down a billion.

The crowd couldn’t be more amazed. Just the dao alone would be impressive enough. In this case, it was both the heavenly sword and its dao together.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Die!” He unleashed the matchless slash, serving the karmic ties and reincarnation cycles.

The slash circled and entrapped the vajra, wanting to drag him in.

“Vajra Blessing.” Earthraiser chanted quietly and raised his hand. A golden spring materialized in front of him and rushed forward like a tsunami to destroy the blockade.

Tie Jian didn’t relent, truly believing himself to be unbeatable while holding his heavenly sword. He slashed the golden tsunami repeatedly in order to break through.

The crowd took a deep breath. The vajra’s defense held up perfectly against a heavenly sword.

“The Vajra Wheel possesses such mighty defense?” One of them gasped.

“Yes, rumor has it that the other overlords might not be able to get through either.” An ancient big shot said.

“Excuse me.” Hallowed joined the fight as well. His slash resembled the light of a fiery angel with a holy affinity. It struck the golden spring and successfully split in two.

Tie Jian took advantage of this and thrust his heavenly sword through the gap with peerless speed. The target was the vajra’s throat.

“Vajra Flower Pluck!” Earthraiser stopped the tip of the blade with two fingers.

“War Break!” The sword tip suddenly shot out a ray to bypass the block.

“Vajra Finger!” Earthraiser shuddered and leaped backward before flicking the ray. It successfully diverted the attack away from his throat.

“Paramount Holiness!” Hallowed appeared above the vajra and unleashed thousands of rays, wanting to reduce him to mincemeat.

“Vajra Kasaya!” Earthraiser waved his sleeve and blocked the incoming rays.

The trio was extremely fast with their techniques; few spectators could actually keep up. Moreover, most were keeping a far distance due to the destructiveness of the battle.

Earthraiser maintained his composure despite fighting two combatants by himself, proving that he was worthy of being an overlord.

On the other side, Vastsea Venerable and Everlasting Sword God have started as well.

“Lightning Ocean!” Vastsea’s attack was of the lightning affinity in the form of an engulfing ocean.

The lightning bolts inside were as thick as mountain ranges; a rain of swords also poured down from above. This was the ultimate offensive technique.
