Chapter 4569: Offense

The youths began warming up while keeping their focus on Pioneer Ancestor.

“We must get it no matter what.” Jian Ming said resolutely.

Wise also knew that this was their last chance. Failing meant being unable to gather the four stones and all talks of revitalization would be meaningless.

“What should we do, Young Noble?” Jian Ming asked for help.

They were aware that they alone had no chance of seizing the stone from Pioneer Ancestor.

Li Qiye glanced at the ancestor and said: “Let me do it, you all will only be throwing your lives away.”

Pioneer wasn’t as powerful as Everlasting Monarch. Nonetheless, the King of Thieves was not someone the group could handle.

“Yes!” Jian Ming cheered excitedly along with the others.

They knew that the dao stone was basically theirs now. No one could stop Li Qiye, not even Pioneer Ancestor. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the next moment, Li Qiye only took one step and appeared before Pioneer Ancestor. He was so fast that it seemed like he was still in his original position. The group thought that there were actually two of him, and that the one on the bridge was just waiting for the ancestor and was there the entire time. This was truly a strange feeling.

Pioneer Ancestor halted right away, seemingly returning to life. Even his dead eyes started flashing terrible rays that try to drill into Li Qiye’s heart. This ferocious and invasive gaze was no different than a fatal saber slash, showing zero mercy to his foe.

Anyone else would immediately tremble in fear and drop down on their knees for a long time. Pioneer Ancestor’s fame and notoriety were well-deserved.

Alas, Li Qiye was completely unaffected and reached for the pendant. His movement seemed carefree, almost like a mortal plucking fruits off a tree.

“Boom!” Right before Li Qiye could grab it, the ancestor released a billowing aura. Numerous fiery skulls appeared in the air and turned the area into the deepest level of hell.

They immediately rushed downward in order to obliterate Li Qiye. However, he was no longer there and was back in his original position away from the bridge.

This took man words to explain but it all happened in one-billionth of the blink of an eye.

No one caught this because they were preoccupied with watching Everlasting Monarch. However, even ancestors couldn’t keep up with Li Qiye.

When everything was over, some of them became startled.

“What the hell, did someone provoke that dead man?” One expert shouted.

The sudden eruption from Pioneer Ancestor scared the hell out of spectators, especially those standing closer to the bridge.

Alas, Pioneer Ancestor was dead and didn’t have thoughts. He merely attacked because Li Qiye was too close to him. Now, there was no longer a target and he couldn’t pursue anyone beyond the bridge. Therefore, he lowered his hands and dispersed his power.

“Success!” Jian Ming was ecstatic.

“Young Noble, you made it look so easy, this is what being unbeatable is like.” Wise felt the same way. He admired Li Qiye’s unreal speed.

Meanwhile, the crowd went back to watching True Immortal’s battle.

Decapitation Godmonarch’s slash released a deafening hymn. Everyone felt a sharp pain and could see the image of them being decapitated, true to his title.

“Go!” Seven-seal True God activated all seven seals, resulting in a loud explosion.

“Damn!” Spectators felt as if their head had just exploded and their brains scattered on the ground.

“Seal!” Finally, Heavenseal Ancient Ancestor also took charge.

Other ancestors from the great powers had no chance of stopping this seal.

At the same time, the rest of the forces also attacked with their weapons and treasures, hoping to distract Everlasting Monarch.
