Chapter 5790: I Am Just A Mortal

“I do feel like you can withstand its highest activation.” Jiao Heng added.

“That depends on what state you will use, going to call the heaven?” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s a distant matter, I am but a mortal.” Jiao Heng laughed.

“Not necessarily, I can get it to come.” Li Qiye clenched his fists before adding: “It feels wrong for me to thrash you in your current state but I won’t need to hold back if it descends.”

“Sounds like you’ve been suffering a bit and want to seek inspiration from me.” Jiao Heng couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Sounds about right.” Li Qiye said: “Although you are far from your prime, I’m sure I can figure out a few things after beating you to the limit.”

“As you said, I am not in my prime, you will find no inspiration after beating me.” Jiao Heng shook his head: “Your goal lies elsewhere and as for me, I will be me, a mortal, nothing more.”

“A mortal second to none, it’s a comfortable destiny.” Li Qiye nodded with a smile.

“You can do the same thing, you are aware of the problem and can stop now to enjoy the many beauties in this world.” Jiao Heng said.

“Beautiful, yes, but will be reduced to ashes.” Li Qiye shook his head.

Jiao Heng agreed and said: “Indeed, that’s why we’ve tried so hard in the beginning to solve the unwanted calamities.”

“The inevitable will come, we can deal with the waves but there comes a time when we need to face the real problem.” Li Qiye said.

“That is where I am inferior, I believe I have done enough already and will stop now. As for you, rest is not an option.” Jiao Heng said: “Don’t you feel tired?”

“Yes, but I cannot stop for it is my pursuit. Moving forward is the only option.” Li Qiye said earnestly.

“Your dao heart has no limit, but my strength does.” Jiao Heng said.

“You don’t need to be a mortal.” Li Qiye smirked.

Jiao Heng stared at him for a second before responding: “Being a mortal is great, it is my pursuit as well. There is no need to transcend.”

“Why not give it a shot?” Li Qiye cracked his knuckles and said: “I’m sure you have forgotten the feeling of standing as the heaven and dominating.”

“No need to provoke me, Sacred Teacher, I know what I seek.” Jiao Heng refused.

“Is that so? With each breakthrough, you might eventually rediscover the feeling again.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Waiting for that will leave you disappointed.” Jiao Heng said: “The mortal world becomes meaningless without mortals.”

“It’s a constant cycle, perhaps this is just a journey for a passerby.” Li Qiye said.

“Isn’t it the same for you, Sacred Teacher? You can stand above the high heaven as well” Jiao Heng asked.

“Many have imagined this and treated it as the ultimate pursuit, but unfortunately, that is not my dao.” Li Qiye said.

“For what reason do you linger here?” Jiao Heng continued asking.

“Because I was born here, the same can’t be said about you.” Li Qiye answered.

“Right, I am different.” Jiao Heng nodded and said: “Either way, you can still stay this way, being only a few steps away. It’s entirely up to you.”

“When I end everything, the existing cycles will be no more, only a new beginning.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Your ambition knows no bounds and puts me to shame.” Jiao Heng said.

“Who knows? Everything is possible depending on your thoughts.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m aware of your goal, Sacred Teacher.” Jiao Heng said: “But what you seek from me has been nipped entirely, I am just another mortal seeking the dao. Becoming an emperor or an Ancestor is my limit.”

“That is where I disagree, it’s very easy for you to change.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m afraid you don’t understand me.” Jiao Heng said.

“Just a little bit, but ultimately, the heaven tolerates zero humiliation. A single thought started this and the same could end this.” Li Qiye said.

Jiao Heng thought about it and let out a sigh before replying: “Perhaps you are right, but I will not let it happen.”

“Let’s wait and see.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Seems like you are confident in your speculation.” Jiao Heng chuckled.

“I dare not claim to be right, but I do have some insight into this matter. Being a mortal is not easy, being born as a mortal is fate, descending into the mortal world is not.”

“So this isn’t my fate?” Jiao Heng said: “You are trying to disturb my dao heart. If this isn’t my fate, what is it then?”

“Eternity and endless battles.” Li Qiye said meaningfully.

“That’s all in the past, far from the current me.” Jiao Heng responded.

“Being a mortal is difficult, especially for you.” Li Qiye said.

“I agree with the first part, but as a mortal, I shall do what a mortal does.” Jiao Heng said.

“There is an end to what mortals can do.” Li Qiye said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“And I need not worry for you walk before all of us, I just need to enjoy the process.” Jiao Heng said: “We are different, your pursuit at that place is a beginning while it is an end for me.”

“An end indeed.” Li Qiye sighed and agreed with him.

“That is why I do not seek more than the current path of just becoming an emperor or an Ancestor.” Jiao Heng said earnestly.

“Can’t stay a mortal if you keep on breaking through.” Li Qiye said.

“That is indeed an issue but I haven’t thought about it yet.” Jiao Heng said.

“Shouldn’t you start thinking about it? Perhaps it only requires one step and the answer you seek awaits.” Li Qiye said. [1]
