Chapter 5218: Break

It was no secret that Xiao Qingtian was in love with Ye Fantian. After all, they were both peerless, a perfect match.

Who wouldn’t fall in love with a beautiful genius such as ye Fantian? Alas, the majority of geniuses didn’t dare to confess since they felt inferior.

“I believe in you, Brother Qingtian. Crossing the bridge shouldn’t be difficult given your cultivation, the same with the eighteen images.” She smiled and said.

“Your confidence makes me want to try even more, Miss Ye.” Xiao Qingtian couldn’t help feeling good after being praised by his crush. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Young Noble Li, I’ll be going first.” He moved forward regardless of Li Qiye’s permission.

He was clearly peeved by Ye Fantian’s high praises of Li Qiye, perhaps it was even admiration. Thus, he wanted to compete with Li Qiye and amaze Fantian as well.

As he crossed the bridge, he maintained a rapid pace. The suppression of the bridge didn’t stop him.

“That’s one of the three Tians for you.” Spectators couldn’t help but praise.

“Rumble!” explosions could be heard as he made it to the highest part of the bridge. Thunderous bolts descended in response but he activated his twelve fruits to stop them. This allowed him to maintain a cool posture and caused the crowd to applaud.

Members of The People took pride in him. One said: “The inheritor of Illumination Conqueror, he will be a pillar of Dao Alliance in the future.”

“Young Noble Li, are you coming?” He looked down and asked, indirectly challenging Li Qiye.

However, Li Qiye had a different thought altogether. He stared at the bridge and said: “Unacceptable, meddling with Imperial Gate’s territory. Take it down.”

Others became startled. It sounded as if Li Qiye was going to break the bridge instead of crossing it.

“Isn’t this too much? Suppression Conqueror created it himself, it can’t be broken that easily.” One expert doubted his ability.

“At least eleven dao fruits are necessary.” Another said.

“I wonder if his power is as outrageous as his arrogance.” A third expert commented while all eyes were on Li Qiye.

“Bam!” A figure landed before the bridge and released his dragon lord aura.

“Such impudence! State your name!” The person shouted.

Everyone saw a great crocodile demon with shiny golden scales.

“Crocodile the Chosen!” Many recognized him.

“Hundred Dao Sect Master wishes to fight.” Others started whispering.

He was a dragon lord with four sacred fruits, currently serving as the sect master of Hundred Dao. His master was Sanctified Bones, the junior brother of Suppression Conqueror.

“Killing our disciples is deserving of death, insulting my Senior Uncle is a graver offense.” Crocodile roared and his scales pointed outward like blades.

“Raa!” The bear who had been resting next to Li Qiye lunged forward.

“Die!” Crocodile was prepared and released a rain of swords.

The bear related with a mighty palm strike, crushing the scaled swords without difficulty to Crocodile’s astonishment.

“Bloodslash Mountain!” Crocodile was only surprised for a split second before performing a different technique. He spewed a golden saber out of his mouth - this was one of his fangs.

With one slash, an image of a mountain filled with corpses appeared along the trajectory. Wailing souls also engulfed the sky.

True Bear shot out a beam from his mouth and obliterated the souls along with the fang saber.

“!!!” Crocodile realized the futility of the fight and turned to run, only to see an old man hovering above him.

“Down!” The old servant raised his hand and an invisible force dragged the great demon over to Li Qiye, smashing it down before him.

“Crack!” The bear rushed over and chomped down, destroying both the fleeing sacred fruits and true fate.

“Sigh, this is a bit lacking in martial ethics.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The crowd was left speechless - a dragon lord was murdered just like that.

“Boom!” An explosion woke them up from their stupor - they saw the servant swinging a hammer against the bridge.

Xiao Qingtian who was standing at the top jumped up from being frightened.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Cracks appeared with each smash.

“Who are you, Fellow Daoist?!” A figure with a boundless imperial aura appeared.

“Suppression Conqueror!” The weaker members of the crowd dropped down to their knees.

“A divine intent.” One big shot said. The conqueror had left a divine intent here to prevent trouble.

This didn’t stop the servant from trying to break the bridge.

“Activate!” The divine intent roared and attacked with a seal encompassing numerous dao.

This was useless because the next smash obliterated the seal and the divine intent.

“Boom!” The entire bridge collapsed afterward.

***

“Who is this?!” In a different location, the meditating Suppression Conqueror stood up and became startled since his divine intent didn’t have the slightest chance of holding the assailant back.

The servant stomped on the ground once. Dirt and soil came together to form a new bridge.

“The path is ready, My Lord.” He bowed in Li Qiye’s direction.
