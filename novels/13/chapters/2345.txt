Perhaps “Death” should be Li Qiye’s title since he was the embodiment of this affinity.

“That’s the highest of profundity?” One ancestor wondered while trembling.

They have seen brilliant imperial and progenitorial laws, but not something like what Li Qiye had done just now. No need for technique and merit law to drain life from his foes.

“Maybe he’s right, this is on the same level as life creation.” Another chimed in.

Perhaps the high heaven didn’t need anything to directly create life, opposite of Li Qiye’s death method.

“When will I see a worthy foe?” Li Qiye said with disappointment.

He returned to his initial form, no longer as terrifying as before. Alas, his ordinary appearance instilled fear into the crowd now.

He dusted off his collars before looking at Wu Bingning who was healed now: “Let’s go, can’t waste more time.”

The two girls immediately followed him. Bingning fared much better since she had mentally prepared for whatever Li Qiye would do. Ling Ximo also did the same but this was on a scale beyond her reach. He was the strongest existence she had ever seen, and that massacre just now was the worst experience.

Everyone quietly watched his departure, hoping that he would leave sooner. No one dared to do anything, afraid of provoking him.

Once the three were gone from sight, the crowd heaved a sigh of relief. His presence was too terrorizing like a death god with his scythe. The fear made them immobile, not wanting to draw the attention of the scythe.

“That was so scary.” Some people dropped to the ground.

No one would make fun of them because this sentiment pervaded the area. People didn’t follow deeper into the region despite knowing that the amazing items in there compared to other places, whether it be eggs, dao bones, or liquid.

“Those three systems are going to go crazy.” One sect master shook his head. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The crowd agreed. These systems have lost too many ancestors, so peace wasn’t a possibility. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to stay in Myriad.

“I think real Eternals will be coming.” One ancestor speculated: “Nothing below this level can contest against Li Qiye, not even low-level True Emperors, only four-palace and up ones can do something, or they’ll just be suiciding.”

The crowd breathed in - ninth-level True Gods were useless, so they agreed with his assessment of Li Qiye’s abilities.

“He’ll fight against Dracoform Martial God for sure, I can’t wait.” Another True God salivated.

No True Emperors were around in Myriad since none among the young generation had reached this level. The ones from the last generation have already left.

The strongest right now of the gods was Dracoform, the number one expert available.

One excited expert said: “Yes, we’ll find out who is really the number one in Myriad.”

The crowd couldn’t wait for the future. If Li Qiye were to challenge Dracoform, it would be a fight on the same level as emperors going at it.

“Dracoform is quite strong, but don’t forget, Young Lord Mu has an Eternal with him too. This person is also a member of the Mu, acting as the young lord’s protector.” One ancestor revealed.

“He has one with him?! An Eternal from Imperial.” This was the first time some have heard this.

“Yes, very mysterious and cultivation unknown, could be on the same level as Dracoform.” The ancestor spoke with a serious expression.

“Why would an Eternal from Imperial want to go down here? His lifespan will go down.” Some experts couldn’t get it.

For example, someone like Dracoform could ascend to Imperial, perhaps even Immortal. However, he had attachments to this land and wanted to protect this system. Thus, he accepted the corrosion of time.

On the other hand, an Eternal from Imperial? It was one thing that he wouldn’t go up to Immortal; going down to Myriad was simply ridiculous.

Young Lord Mu wasn’t affected as much but this wasn’t the case for an old Eternal. People up in Imperial had a longer lifespan. Going down meant potentially dying earlier.

The actual time lost varied, but even one day was precious to an old Eternal. Thus, this person’s choice of descending perplexed the crowd.

“If Young Lord Mu is only coming down to train, then that Eternal is sacrificing himself needlessly.” One elder added.

“Well, that just goes to show the young lord’s high status.” The ancestor said: “Just think about it, his reason for going down here is inconsequential. Another might have True Gods as companions, but an Eternal willingly accepting this loss? You think an ordinary person would have this treatment?”

The crowd contemplated further. A successor actually wasn’t that big of a deal to a system. An ancestor was far more valuable and influential.

Most importantly, if a successor were to die, there were plenty of other candidates. But for an ancestor who is an Eternal? There was no way of making up for this loss. It would take several eras to groom one again.

This made people wonder - what was so special about Young Lord Mu?

“No wonder why so many systems want to curry favors.” Another connected the dots but realized he had misspoken. Plenty of people here actually sucked up to the young lord before.

“Maybe only someone as fierce as Li Qiye would be able to take care of Young Lord Mu. It’s not a good thing for an outsider to stay in our world.” An ancestor spoke with a profound gaze.

The crowd was moved. No one would believe that the young lord came without a grand plan.
