Chapter 4367: Goldbird’s Rumination

Li Qiye’s comment made Goldbird think about the circumstances.

Dragon had lost many experts along with their sect master’s son in Myriad Sect Mountain. Though Li Qiye didn’t personally kill them, he definitely played a role. This was especially true for the destruction of Peacock Monarch’s divine intent.

Any of the three reasons listed above was enough for Dragon to pursue the matter. On the surface, this seemed like a fight between an elephant and an ant.

Normally, the “ant” would start begging for mercy or even trying to commit suicide in order to save his sect. This time, the ant actually came to their territory despite the animosity and hatred. Moreover, he brought his fellow members with him as well.

Though Jian Qingzhu had invited him, she couldn’t guarantee his safety. He should know this full well too.

Therefore, coming to Dragon was akin to jumping off a cliff or entering a tiger’s lair. Nonetheless, the guy was here right now. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Goldbird could tell that he wasn’t a fool or crazy. Thus, he should have enough sense to never come to Dragon. The only explanation was that he had a strong backer or that he didn’t fear their sect.

Where was this confidence coming from? This was the monarch’s main question.

After a while, he spoke: “Young Noble, your great treasures are indeed enviable.”

His daughter had told him about the treasures obtained by Li Qiye. Thus, he speculated that this was the reason for his arrogance.

He discretely reminded Li Qiye that treasures alone weren’t enough. His sect also had top treasures because they had dao lords and top masters in the past.

“Do you think I need those treasures?” To which Li Qiye responded.

Once again, the monarch felt as if he was being viewed as an idiot by Li Qiye. It was rather frustrating and infuriating. Alas, his daughter’s words echoed again and he remained calm.

If Li Qiye was telling the truth, then what’s the right answer?

Being aware that the mountain is infested with tigers yet still climbs. It couldn’t be mere blustering and most importantly, why the roost?

He came to their city and didn’t talk about the feud with their sect master. His main target seemed to be the roost in the first place.

“I’m afraid it is not up to me, Young Noble. The roost has monumental significance to our sect.” He eventually gave up and smiled wryly.

He wasn’t lying either. Though he had plenty of authority, this was not something he could decide on his own.

“I’m merely letting you know because being smart can be a blessing. Those who aren’t smart, on the other hand…” Li Qiye paused for a moment before continuing: “You and your daughter are a rare breed. Don’t die a stupid death now.”

This left the monarch speechless while the rest of the demons wanted to attack. Alas, they wanted to wait for an order.

He eventually took a deep breath and said: “Young Noble, I will make an exception and start a conference with the elder. I’ll advocate for you to enter but I do not guarantee success. I can only try my best, what do you think?” He then stared at Li Qiye with sincerity, something no other demon monarchs could.

“I can see why your daughter is wise now.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly: “But still missing a little bit. Dragon would be better off with you as the sect master.”

“You’re too funny, Young Noble.” The monarch smiled wryly: “Peacock Monarch is a brilliant genius. Though we are from the same generation, we are merely riding his coattails. I lack decisiveness and cultivation talent compared to him.”

He admitted his inferiority without any qualm. In reality, few in all of Sky Border from that generation could compare to Peacock Monarch. He was strong enough to fight the slumbering ancestors now.

Thus, it was natural for him to become the sect master. The elders all agreed as well. Goldbird wasn’t jealous at all because Peacock lived up to his potential.

“Cultivation and leadership are two different matters.” Li Qiye said: “A sect can rise with a genius but the opposite can happen as well. Disasters often go hand in hand with geniuses.”

“I see…” Goldbird carefully digested the comment.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything else and moved forward.
