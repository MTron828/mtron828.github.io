Everyone stood in a daze before the incoming palms. How many could actually withstand this force?

Even the ancestors felt dread; their sects wouldn’t be able to do anything but turn to ashes.

“Is he a lump of flesh now?” Everyone wanted to confirm Li Qiye’s death.

“Rumble!” A series of explosions interrupted the speculations. Everyone saw the two palms being pushed apart.

“Look, inside!” A keen-eyed spectator instantly spotted Li Qiye.

The crowd saw him pushing out the palms with his bare hands. The process made the world quake.

“Rumble!” Space fluctuated continuously. Everyone could sense this violent feedback.

It was as if he wasn’t only splitting up the palms but also the entire world.

“Amitabha.” A chant resounded with surging Buddhist light. This endless power gathered on the palms, allowing it to push together again in order to put an end to Li Qiye.

“Even if a real Buddha comes, he’ll still kneel before me, not to mention fakers like you.” Li Qiye chuckled while his hands lit up.

“Boom!” They suddenly became colossal, more than enough to grasp the world.

“Boom!” Li Qiye pushed out the Buddhist palms without any effort. He then grabbed and fully immobilized them.

“Not good!” The Vajras became nervous since they couldn’t perform the scripture anymore.

“These are Buddhist Palms? What are they good for? Stir-frying some vegetables? I’ll break a bit off and make some appetizers.” Li Qiye chuckled and twisted his hands.

“Crack!” He actually broke the hands apart.

Everyone was stunned because these invincible hands broke so cleanly as if they were fried dough twists.

“Does it taste good?” Li Qiye began his joke.

“It’s good.” He broke one finger.

“It’s not good.” He broke another with a smile. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“It’s good” and “it’s not good” interchanged for a bit until he broke all ten.

“Ah!” One Vajra fell from the sky after another. Blood gushed out from their body since Li Qiye broke their true form despite their physical toughness.

“Bam! Bam! Bam!” They became meat paste after slamming into the ground.

No one expected for all ten to fall in this manner. These were fierce characters that have swept through the world before but now, they were mangled and mutilated.

Li Qiye then casually threw the fingers away and wiped his hands as if they have been dirtied. He said flatly: “Buddhist Palm Scripture? More like Fried Dough Scripture.”

“The ten Vajras are finished just like that? Killed by a junior?” One old cultivator murmured.

“Okay then, that’s enough power to rival Jade-break and Puresword True Emperor.” Another ancestor took a deep breath.

Everyone felt both fear and admiration towards this young man. He was strong enough to do whatever he wanted wherever.

“Buzz.” The ten warships in the sky suddenly lit up. The various lights gathered and formed ponds of brilliance.

Shadows of the ten Vajras appeared in the ponds.

“What’s going on?” The crowd didn’t expect this.

“Splash! Splash! Splash...” The dead Vajras rushed out of the bright ponds.

They were still as brilliant as before, looking like ten supreme gods.

“How can this be? The dead coming back to life?!” A spectator shouted.

Some started rubbing their eyes, thinking that they were only seeing things. They saw the ten killed by Li Qiye just now, so how did they come back to life?

“Junior, are you in awe? We can’t be killed.” The ten surrounded Li Qiye again while laughing.

Li Qiye looked at them and said: “Nothing to it, babies from Luminous Gold Tribe are born with special metals in their mouth, while these warships are made from them. It just means that as long as these warships are around, you all will be around too, and vice versa.”

“You?!” The ten Vajras were shocked. Few people knew their actual background even though they have been around for so long.

“The legend is true. The Luminous Gold Tribe isn’t extinct.” An old ancestor couldn’t believe it.

“Luminous Gold Tribe? What is that?” His junior asked.

“It used to be a great tribe in Left Bank but was exterminated after losing the political struggle. This tribe was versed in craftsmanship and could create many magical items. People were actually suspecting that Luminous Gold Tribe was still around after seeing these warships. Looks like Hidden Gold Grotto has saved the descendants of this tribe, including the ten Vajras.”

He looked at the ships then the Vajras: “No wonder why these warships are so strong. They have become one with the Vajras, storing these beings’ souls. It meant that even if their bodies were destroyed, as long as these ships were around, they could be rebuilt again. In order to kill them completely, one must destroy the ships as well.”

“Doing both is not easy at all.” A person murmured while staring at the gigantic ships.

“So what if you know? You can only take us down in your dream!” Iron Vajra shouted.

“This is just a special gift of your tribe, not true immortality.” Li Qiye leisurely said: “Very well, since your group has destroyed my wooden house, I will build a palace out of your ships. Not a bad idea at all.”

“Such arrogance!” The other Vajras became furious. Though they weren’t his match, being shown such disdain was still very uncomfortable.

They channeled their energy and became radiant. This divinity swept through the realms as they fused together with their warships.
