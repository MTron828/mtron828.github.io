Chapter 5885: But You Have Offended Me

“I’m not interested in feasting on flesh, drop it.” Stonesplitter shook his head.

“Then I shall eat him and leave, never to bother your world again. It is a promise.” Twilight Hunter said.

This caused others to exchange glances. Stonesplitter himself put on a serious expression.

The outward statement carried karmic implications, meaning that Twilight Hunter would stick to his word. This non-transaction turned out to be a good deal for both sides.

After all, Trinity’s existence didn’t seem necessary in the current epoch. No one recognized or supported him any longer. His death had no actual consequences.

If anything, the emperors considered Trinity to be a potential existential threat. He could become the new ruler in Li Qiye’s absence as Trinity or devour everything as the mysterious guest of Celestial Court. Who was in charge right now?

From a logical perspective, letting Twilight Hunter devour Trinity was not a bad choice. However, in terms of morality and principle, they couldn’t let it happen.

First, Trinity might not be the fallen form right now. If he could remain Trinity, chances of him being a contributor in the future might be high.

“Fool!” Trinity shouted at Stonesplitter: “He is not in his peak form due to hunger, just buy enough time and you will win!”

“Trinity, if life were so easy, you wouldn’t be in this state.” Twilight snorted.

“Release me and I will kill you within three moves even in this weakened form.” Trinity said, being in charge of the body.

The darkness affinity worked well against the mysterious guest, leaving him more afflicted with injuries.

“Your psychological tactic is meaningless. You are broken now and can’t kill me within three hundred moves, let alone three.” Twilight retorted. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Try then!” Trinity shouted.

“You’re already my meal, no need to try.” Twilight responded.

This prompted Trinity to yell at Stonesplitter: “Your shield can do more than just defend, offense and encirclement are possible as well, trap him and seize the initiative!”

“Trinity, why would he listen to you? You are no longer the epoch lord, this isn’t your Trinity Epoch.” Twilight said.

Stonesplitter snorted and didn’t bother responding to either of them. Although Twilight tried to instigate, he also spoke the truth.

During Trinity’s prime, he reigned the epoch and viewed everyone else with disdain. This included the other overlords - the most talented and powerful beings around. He still viewed them as juniors and ordered them as he pleased.

Of course, his arrogance was well-justified since he was indeed the greatest. Just a few casual comments from him were immensely beneficial.

Unfortunately, his greatness robbed him of patience. He didn’t accumulate enough strength and cultivation before embarking on an expedition.

Today, Stonesplitter no longer needed his guidance, especially not when he was in this broken form. He was not qualified to give commands while being suppressed by Twilight.

“Again, Stonesplitter, we are not enemies. Let me feast and I will never offend you.” Twilight didn’t want to waste time.

He never thought about fighting Stonesplitter. This was about eating as fast as possible and leaving since he had zero interest in this world or the current epoch.

Stonesplitter knew that he could defend himself with his shield but what about defeating the opponent?

The emperors watched with bated breath since this was a difficult choice for Stonesplitter.

Twilight waited patiently. He wasn’t afraid of Stonesplitter but taking down his shield was another story.

However, he must devour Trinity and being disrupted or ambushed during this process might prove troublesome. Time was of the essence as well since he didn’t like revealing himself for too long from a risk perspective.

“But you have offended me.” Suddenly, someone answered instead of Stonesplitter.

The crowd was shocked to hear the newcomer’s voice because this person shouldn’t be here right now.

“Dark Crow!” Twilight staggered backward.

Stonesplitter stared at Li Qiye in disbelief - the ordinary youth with no aura to speak of. Even overlords couldn’t sense anything special about him.

“Sacred Teacher!” The emperors were frozen upon seeing him.

The person who couldn’t possibly be here proved otherwise.

Dark Crow, Sacred Teacher, Li Qiye - the name didn’t matter, only that he was here.

Everyone saw Li Qiye’s departure through the special gateway to Heavenrealm. His lack of appearance after several hundred thousand years confirmed this. It seemed impossible to return after traveling to Heavenrealm.

How was he standing before them right now, the real Li Qiye?
