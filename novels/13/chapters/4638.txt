Chapter 4639: Voidburn Saintess

Paramount Scion represented Three Thousand Dao and the other represented True Immortal. Spectators wanted to see their power and various techniques.

“Just fight already, show us which school of techniques is better.” One crowd member murmured.

Paramount Scion became awkward since the spotlight was solely on him.

He waved his hand and smiled wryly: “My abilities and cultivation are insufficient. There is no need to fight since I accept defeat.”

This caused a furor among the crowd. They exchanged glances of confusion.

“Accepting defeat already?” One of them said.

“He’s not taking this seriously enough.” A disciple from a great power added.

Young cultivators, especially geniuses, took their reputation rather seriously. They wished to become world-famous and would never miss an opportunity. They preferred to fight to the very end instead of yielding.

Accepting defeat before trying devalued their lifelong effort. What would be the point of cultivation then?

In their opinion, Paramount Scion had a bright future ahead of him since he was the successor of Paramount.

Therefore, he should hold his status and reputation with utmost importance. Giving up like this would ruin his future.

Moreover, they also knew that these two were even in power and cultivation. No one else would yield given the circumstances. Trying his best and losing was completely acceptable.

“This isn’t a joke.” Speargrasp frowned after hearing this.

Paramount Scion waved his hands helplessly in response: “First Brother, I’m sorry to let you down but I can’t contribute to the sect and Three Thousand Dao in this matter. Please forgive me.”

He looked like a pig accepting its fate of being roasted, not wanting to participate in this marriage competition. Speargrasp couldn’t exactly force the guy to do anything. Moreover, the latter wasn’t an official member of Three Thousand Dao.

“Brother Speargrasp, does Three Thousand Dao have any other disciple interested in participating?” The young emperor spoke. Each word was filled with the rhythm of the grand dao: “It seems that the winner should be from either of our sects.”

He said in a matter-of-fact manner with no intention of intimidating anyone. Nonetheless, the crowd became emotional because his words carried ample clout and truth.

True Immortal Spirit couldn’t make this claim but since the young emperor was here in person, who would be able to defeat him?

“True Immortal wants it so bad, that’s why the young emperor is here.” One expert whispered.

“It’s the same for Three Thousand Dao with Speargrasp here.” A big shot nodded in agreement.

“A decision is already made. True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, you both no longer have any business here.” Everyone suddenly heard a newcomer speaking.

“What?!” They immediately followed the direction of the voice.

“Such audacity, is he tired of living?!” One of them blurted because both the young emperor and Speargrasp were present.

Provoking True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao was far from wise right now.

“It’s Li Qiye.” Many recognized him as he walked closer with Jian Ming and the others.

The crowd immediately made way for the group.

“Does he know what he’s doing?” Someone snorted.

“He’s about to get it since the young emperor and Speargrasp are here.” A youth uttered coldly.

The crowd was feeling nervous due to the presence of these two, let alone daring to provoke and offend the two sects.

Both the duo immediately stared at Li Qiye. However, before they could say anything, another group landed in front of Li Qiye and blocked his path.

They wore crimson armor with fire runes that seem to be alive. This type of metal was both tough and scorching.

The leader was an enchanting beauty, truly a sight to behold. However, she looked aggressive with murderous intent flashing in her eyes. They were as sharp as blades and could cut deep.

“Voidburn Saintess and her fellow sect members.” Many recognized them right away.

“It’s for revenge.” Another stated.

She was none other than Voidburn Godchild’s younger sister and also Tian Feng’s fiancee.

“You’re Li Qiye?” She asked with animosity. Her chilling aura was unbearable for the crowd. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone knew about her brother’s death. Thus, this act of vengeance was expected.

“She’s extremely strong, should be on the same level as Paramount Scion or True Immortal Spirit.” One ancestor said. She was chosen as Tian Feng’s fiancee for a reason.
