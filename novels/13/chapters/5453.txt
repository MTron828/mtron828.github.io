Chapter 5454: Astonishment

Li Zhitian and the members of the Imperial Clan joined the group, also paying their respect to Li Qiye.

Of course, no one had any surprises left to give at this point after witnessing several monsters previously.

Prior to this, they already knew how frightening Li Qiye was - defeating both Immortal Pagoda and Eternal Conqueror with a single move. Illumination Conqueror in his empowered state was swiftly defeated as well.

Nonetheless, a disparity in power didn’t necessitate a subservient display. This was something unprecedented in the upper continents - for a single cultivator to be so prestigious and influential.

Even those who came from Celestial Court didn’t enjoy this treatment. Top cultivators had too much pride to become sycophants.

Alas, everyone could see that Calamity, Jilin Buddhist Emperor, Azure Ancestor, and others truly revered Li Qiye. This changed everything regarding previous speculations of Li Qiye’s identity and background.

“Who is he?” Conquerors and dragon lords shared the same question.

Only a supreme and ancient existence could cause these cultivators to act in this manner.

“Stand up.” Li Qiye waved and gave permission.

The others stood up; Jilin Buddhist Emperor seemed to be the one most affected by this long-awaited meeting. He smiled and gently stroked her hair before entering the battlefield.

Supreme and his peers were shaken mentally to see Li Qiye’s involvement. They involuntarily took one step back.

Other members of Heaven and Divine Alliance felt the same way, thinking that it was harder to breathe.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Li Qiye still appeared unremarkable with no aura or might emanating from him. He looked plain and unassuming, outmatched by any conqueror or dao lord. Nonetheless, there was an inexplicable pressure as if the high heaven itself was pressing down on them.

They would have feared him even without seeing the display of reverence prior. He was clearly someone above the apex.

They recalled Illumination Conqueror in his dream state, borrowing enough power to fight four apex cultivators alone. Alas, Li Qiye still smashed him effortlessly.

They felt tiny and insignificant for once while facing this horrifying foe.

“It is not too late to scatter.” Li Qiye’s eyes scanned the group.

The targets of his gaze trembled as if the glances alone could kill them. They had a solemn expression, aware of a potentially fatal battle.

They had the upper hand with the tower and the hook, capable of killing any conqueror or dao lord with enough time. However, they weren’t sure that this would work on Li Qiye.

“Sir, no one questions your invincibility.” Supreme took a deep breath, still being cool and collected despite facing Li Qiye: “Do you stand with The People now?”

“As I’ve said, I do not care for your conflict. My issue lays with Celestial Court.” Li Qiye responded.

“Please elaborate, Sir. If you are dissatisfied with Celestial Court, I will relay the message.” Supreme bowed.

Despite being a representative of Celestial Court, Supreme didn’t dare to be imperious this time, choosing to be humble instead. This was far, far from the norm.

“Good, here’s the message. Tell the geezers there to wash their neck since I’ll be chopping their head off and flattening their court.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

Since no one thought that Li Qiye’s words were mere empty boasts at this point, they became shocked even more. This was by no means an empty threat; he certainly would carry through with his declaration even if it meant fighting Celestial Court.
