Chapter 4573: Back To The Earth

The crowd stared at Li Qiye but didn’t see any clue from it. His nonchalant expression revealed nothing.

“Didn’t Li Qiye get the pouch?” A big shot looked back at Everlasting Monarch and saw that the pouch was still there.

They contemplated and thought that if the illusion was true, then Li Qiye would be holding the pouch right now.

Remember, the behemoth known as True Immortal mobilized its top masters for the pouch. It paid a heavy price only to fail.

Therefore, the value of this pouch couldn’t be overstated. Fewer than few treasures in the entire world could compare to it.

If Li Qiye had somehow gotten it, he would have opened it right away and taken whatever was inside for himself. Therefore, all of them must be seeing things.

“I’m going crazy.” Jian Ming murmured. He also saw the same thing - Li Qiye obtaining the pouch. Alas, reality told a different tale since no battle ensued.

“You’re not, the young noble was just too fast. His speed is matchless.” Si Jingru said softly.

Jian Ming didn’t doubt her claim at all. The daoist became emotional and asked right away: “Young Noble, what’s inside the pouch?”

The entire group wanted to know the highly-coveted item inside it.

“Not something anyone should have or it’ll cause a disaster.” Li Qiye smiled.

“A disaster…” The group pondered quietly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This simply didn’t make sense because Everlasting Monarch wanted to take it to his next life. Moreover, True Immortal tried its best to obtain it as well. How could it be the source of a disaster?

Li Qiye didn’t elaborate and left it to their imagination.

“Boom!” Meanwhile, the maelstrom at the center of the Yin Wheel has reached its limit. It seemed to be collapsing and made the world shake violently.

“It’s almost over.” A big shot exclaimed.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The emissary summoned a bell in one hand and a divine sign made out of cloth in the other.

The bell seemed to be made from ancient bronze, looking tough and heavy. It had a wooden handle brimming with an archaic aura.

It must have been used for many years now since the handle looked smooth, most likely from being held so often. Time has left marks on the bell but nonetheless, it still persevered and lasted until now.

As for the sign, it became gray from the passage of time, only taken out every once in a while during the crossing.

The emissary glanced at the cemetery and saw that no one else was coming. The cemetery’s entrance then closed.

“It’s time.” A top master whispered: “The dead in the grave have to wait until the next opening or some time later in the future. They don’t believe that their time is right.”

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The emissary shook the bell while chanting an ancient language.

“Dust to dust, return to the earth for there is no way back on the immortal road…” His voice seemed to be coming from a different temporal plane.

He began crossing the bridge toward the Yin Wheel. All the corpses on the bridge also followed along.

As they entered the void, the Yin Wheel shook violently. Deafening detonations could be heard as everything came crumbling down. The maelstrom spun faster, seemingly wanting to destroy all intruders.

“Buzz.” The sign held by the emissary exuded a golden radiance, looking like the reflection from the water in the Yellow River.

They illuminated the corpses and added a golden layer on top. This turned them from corpses to emissaries from the underworld. This calmed the Yin Wheel down and it seemed ready to accept these corpses.

“So the emissary is the reason why the corpses can enter the Yin Wheel. Otherwise, they would have been reduced to dust by that maelstrom.” A first-timer commented.

“Boom!” After the final corpse entered the Yin Wheel, ancient palaces suddenly appeared in the void. Sacred rings of light pulsed from all of them.

They resembled the hall of fortune, granting luck and life to the dead for a chance at reincarnation. Divine stairs appeared before the entrances, covered by mysterious runes of the reincarnation affinity. Each palace awaited a corpse to give them a new chance.

“What are those buildings?” First-time spectators took a deep breath.

Big shots who have been here several times weren’t as surprised. One of them said: “No one knows since only the dead can enter.”

“What about Calamity Dao God?” Someone else brought the sole survivor of the Yin Wheel.

“I don’t know, I don’t think he had said anything about the Yin Wheel after returning.” The big shot shook his head.

The emissary led the dead on top of the stairs. Each step issued a Buddhist melody that could be construed as a greeting for an entirely new life.
