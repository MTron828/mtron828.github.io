Chapter 4856: Must See Blood

His appearance made everyone nervous including Mad Pyromancer. The disparity in power was clear given their ranking.

“Death to those who dare to offend the lord.” He uttered coldly while holding the hilt of his saber.

Firerage and the guards heaved a sigh of relief after seeing this unexpected savior. They initially thought that he was here for the coffin.

Though they didn’t know the reason behind his intent, he was famous for keeping his word. If he had made this declaration, he would escort the coffin to the very end.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Fallen King and Nether Messenger immediately fled after seeing him. A while ago, they didn’t run when Mad Pyromancer showed up because there was still a glimmer of hope. They stuck around to see how things would play out.

Now, there was no point in doing so. Bloodsea Blade was just far stronger and didn’t discriminate in picking his opponents. Pyromancer, on the other hand, normally only picked on the weak and defenseless; Bloodsea was always ready to bite someone stronger.

“Leaving so soon?” Bloodsea’s eyes narrowed and shot out saber intents. 

“Clank!” The saber left the scabbard and a bloody flash could be seen again.

The fleeing Fallen King heard the hymn and felt death coming for him. He roared and gathered all of his wings together to build an ultimate protection. Thousands and thousands of swords circled around him, not allowing anyone to take half a step closer.

“Whoosh!” Each sword was as large as a hill. They created numerous layers around him but the saber still surpassed everything.

“Boom!” It struck his chest after piercing through the defensive sword art.

“Ahh!” He let out a miserable cry before falling backward. Though he dominated for a lifetime, he failed to stop one slash from Bloodsea. He was only a sovereign while Bloodsea had three dao fruits.

As for Nether Messenger, he was far away now. He assumed his specter form once more and created a thousand copies.

Spectators couldn’t tell which one was real but there was one exception - Bloodsea.

“Clank!” He slashed again. The saber energy traveled through space and erupted in a bright flash once more.

‘Ahh!” The slash cut the real one without any problem. Due to his speed, his actual body traveled another thousand miles before separating by the waist. The two halves landed with blood streaming out.

Fallen King’s defense and Nether Messenger’s speed didn’t matter at all to Bloodsea. Killing them only required one slash each.

Bloodsea Blade - the owner of a weapon that demanded to see blood once drawn.

The hidden villains and Mad Pyromancer shuddered while smelling the stench of blood in the air. Bloodsea preferred to kill instead of talk.

“Your turn.” He raised his saber in Pyromancer’s direction.

Pyromancer felt fear and licked his lips nervously. He took joy in burning others and had killed too many to count. However, he only picked on the weak and mortals while his opponent was someone who dared to fight dao lords.

“Bloodsea, you wish to provoke Wild Dynasty? Our lord wants Eight-stallion’s corpse. If you try to stop me, you will make him awfully unhappy.” Pyromancer smiled and said.

There were naturally top dogs among the villains as well. Wild Dynasty was the gathering of evil cultivators. Its founder was Wild Dragon, ranking first among the Ten Monsters.

He was one of the reasons for chaos in the continent, destroying numerous sects and killing ancestors. No one in Chaos could stop him with the exception of the late Eight-stallion Dao Lord.

“Let him come then.” Bloodsea uttered coldly, undeterred.

Pyromancer’s expression soured, not expecting the threat to fail.

“Make your move before I kill you.” Bloodsea repeated.

“Fine!” Pyromancer became livid and shouted: “The outcome isn’t decided yet!”

With that, he raised his torch and summoned a raging inferno with fiery sparks raining down.

He blew on the torch and the inferno turned into a dragon. It grew larger and larger, crushing the mountain nearby.

When the fire dragon landed, the ground melted into flowing lava. A few villains who happened to be nearby couldn’t get away in time. The flames from the dragon reduced them to ashes in the blink of an eye.

“Raa!” The fire dragon raised its claws and lunged toward Bloodsea while also spewing out a fiery beam.

Bloodsea didn’t bat an eye and unsheathed his saber again for another slash.

“Clank!” This was all he needed to split the beam and the dragon from its head all the way down to the tail.

The bloody slash continued forward until the other side of the sky, eventually dispersing into a mere afterimage.
