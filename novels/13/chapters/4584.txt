Chapter 4585: Paramount Scion

A ship silently soared through white clouds. It seemed to be floating in the air with incredible speed, leaving behind a beautiful trail.

The passengers included Li Qiye, Xiao Xuan, Jian Ming, and the daoist. Their destination - Worldbreaker Fist.

Xiao Xuan was in search of an item potentially hidden there. At first, Jian Ming and the daoist didn’t want to tag along until Li Qiye stated his intention.

This wasn’t due to a lack of confidence in Xiao Xuan’s power. In fact, they believed that she could oppose the power of Worldbreaker. The problem here was that they couldn’t trust her.

This girl, for one reason or another, didn’t have a stable mind. This could be due to her current state after the long hibernation. She could randomly become angry or act recklessly. Both of them had no chance of stopping her since her remnant energy waves could annihilate them.

On the other hand, Li Qiye could stabilize her tempestuous nature. Therefore, it should be fine as long as he was around. Moreover, they felt safer traveling to Worldbreaker with him. That’s why along the way, they were whistling and singing as if they were on vacation.

This was a long trip, hence needing a long-distance ship. It traveled ten million miles each day.

“Dao Brother, please wait, take me along for a while!” Suddenly, a clear voice came from the horizon. A youth caught up to their ship and boarded without permission.

He wore a blue robe and a blue hair ribbon meant for scholars. He spoke with grace, resembling a student from a prestigious clan in the mortal world.

However, upon closer inspection, an ethereal blue smoke permeated his pupils, seemingly boundless and always present. It contained a creation affinity, capable of turning into one world and then splitting it into three thousand separate ones.

Those noticing the strange pupils would then find themselves naked. Everything in the world was under their watchful gaze.

The youth bowed politely and said: “Brothers, where to?”

“Worldbreaker Fist.” The daoist responded.

“Perfect, that just happens to be my destination too. Do you mind giving me a ride?” He smiled enthusiastically. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Ming seemed amused and said: “That’s not a big deal but there gotta be something in it for us. Our price is not cheap but of course, the famous Paramount Scion will be able to handle it.”

“I am happy to pay any price you name, Brother Jian.” The youth wasn’t surprised to have his identity exposed.

“You know me?” Jian Ming, on the other hand, didn’t expect this.

“Brother Jian, you are famous in Golden. People there say that when one is in need, you’re the perfect choice.” The youth smiled brightly.

Jian Ming loved being complimented. He laughed heartily and said: “Scion, how knowledgeable and insightful you are to recognize a hero such as myself. Looks like there is no need for a fee since real recognize real.” [1]

“Thanks, I appreciate it, Brother Jian.” The youth bowed slightly.

“It’s cool since you were polite.” Jian Ming was friendly for once after receiving praises.

The daoist stared at him and joked: “As the saying goes, people don’t come bearing gifts for no reason. Just hearing a few nice words makes you forget who you are.”

“Swindler, you better watch your mouth.” Jian Ming glared back at him.

.

“Hmph.” The daoist snorted and then asked the scion: “Seems like a pretty big coincidence boarding our ship and having the same destination.”

His directness made it awkward for the scion. The latter’s face turned red as he bowed: “It is a misunderstanding, Brother. I have no ulterior motive and really am only asking for a ride, albeit shamelessly. Please, don’t kick me off.”

His tone was sincere and cordial.

“Haha, here for us or for our young noble?” Jian Ming smirked at him. He wasn’t an idiot and knew that this was no coincidence.

“I…” The scion had no response. He took a moment before bowing deeply toward Li Qiye and Xiao Xuan.

“Doesn’t look like a good person.” Xiao Xuan casually commented. In reality, she didn’t like anyone so none could earn her grace.

The scion’s expression became more awkward. He smiled wryly and said: “I, I don’t know how to say this but really, I definitely do not bear any malice. I saw everyone along the way and wanted to tag along…”

The more he tried to explain, the more suspicious he became.

“You have a dao lord aura on you but it is not your own, just a trace attached.” Li Qiye stared at him and said.

The youth was astounded to hear this and forgot to respond.

“A dao lord aura?” The duo became surprised.

“Brat, you’ve met a dao lord recently? No, there’s no dao lord right now, impossible.” Jian Ming’s eyes opened wide.

“Not a meeting with a dao lord. He just met someone with a dao lord bloodline, an extremely thick one. It is most likely a direct descendant.” Li Qiye elaborated.

This shocked the youth even more. He stood there frozen like a statue.

“Hmm, direct descendants? Quite rare nowadays.” Jian Ming contemplated.

The daoist thought of someone and commented: “Shen Juntian.”

“Right! Is that who you met?” Jian Ming said: “Ah, not too surprising since your Paramount Gate is very close with Three Thousand. Did he come out of isolated cultivation?”

Paramount Gate was a top lineage that had deep ties with Three Thousand Dao. Its progenitor was Paramount Lord, the senior brother of Dao Sanqian.

Rumor has it that Paramount Lord was even more talented and powerful than his junior brother. However, he died way early on. Some believed that Dao Sanqian would have been in his shadow otherwise.

Nonetheless, his sect still prospered without needing Three Thousand Dao’s protection.

“You’re completely right, Young Noble.” The youth bowed again, completely impressed: “I’ve just met Brother Juntian recently.”

“I see, looks like this will be fun.” Jian Ming murmured.

Shen Juntian was one of the five conquerors, a potential candidate for the dao lord position and a direct disciple of Dao Sanqian.
