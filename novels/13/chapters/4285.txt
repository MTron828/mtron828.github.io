Chapter 4286: Picking A Successor Before Death

The old man sat down on the ground and smiled wryly: “You’re right, I-I’m finished.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The destruction of the true fate signaled death. He was surviving on sheer willpower.

“What a shame…” He looked around with indignation and unwillingness.

“Seems like you still have unfinished business.” Li Qiye calmly said.

“Yes.” The old man grimaced from pain as he tried to reply: “I, I can’t go back to the sect in time.”

“Even gods have regrets. You will die, it’s better to die with your eyes closed than to hold this grudge after passing. Just let go and be at peace.” Li Qiye smiled.

Anyone else would find this questionable. The majority would try to console the dying old man but Li Qiye was telling him to die faster.

“Just let go…” The old man was also surprised. He thought about it and laughed. Unfortunately, this worsened some wounds and caused him to vomit more blood.

Li Qiye didn’t seem to mind the result of his words.

“R-right, I’m dying…” The old man stared at Li Qiye and hesitated for a moment before making a decision: “I-I have something to give to you, Fellow Daoist.”

He didn’t wait for a response before taking out an item in a meticulous manner. It was clearly precious to the old man.

“It pertains to my sect’s prosperity.” He placed it in Li Qiye’s hand while enduring the pain: “Please, bring it back to my sect after reading it. But, it’s alright if you won’t, just keep it then. It’s still better than letting it fall to the hands of those dogs.”

He risked his life for this item and it was extremely pivotal to his sect. He hoped that it would help revitalize the sect.

Alas, death beckoned and he didn’t have anyone else nearby. It had to be Li Qiye.

The world coveted the item. That’s why he hoped that Li Qiye would somehow be kind and bring it back to his sect after learning it. This was an unlikely scenario but he would rather give it to Li Qiye than his enemies.

Li Qiye glanced down and saw an ancient scroll with a seal on the surface. He knew what it was right away after seeing the runes.

“An immortal physique from the past. Indestructible Diamond, mmm, a disorderly edition.” Li Qiye was amused.

“Yo-you can read it?!” The old man was astounded.

“It’s just an immortal physique law, no big deal.” Li Qiye said.

How could he not know the so-called ancient immortal physique laws? They were derived from the Physique Scripture and propagated to the rest of the world. Of course, the current versions were far inferior compared to the real things.

Moreover, the actual Physique Scripture was in Li Qiye’s possession right now. However, it no longer had this name.

“No big deal?” The old man’s pain was alleviated for a moment since he was astonished.

These immortal physique laws were unbeatable. His sect spent generations searching for one and their effort was finally rewarded. Alas, he also lost his life in the process.

“Hahaha.” He laughed heartily and said: “Take it then, do as you wish.”

He then coughed repeatedly and his color changed to a faint yellow. This was the final radiance of a setting sun. He had one step in the grave at this point. It was nothing short of a miracle for someone with his injuries to last so long.

More footsteps could be heard from below. Many pursuers were coming.

“They’re here. G-go!” The old man grabbed the sword hilt tighter and became worried about Li Qiye.

It had nothing to do with Li Qiye himself. However, all would be in vain if Li Qiye were to be captured right now.

Li Qiye stood there with a smile, not listening to the man’s urging.

“Go!” The old man shouted with his remaining strength. Breathing became difficult.

The pursuers finally arrived and surrounded Li Qiye with drawn weapons.

“Sect Master!” They saw the old man and pointed their sword at Li Qiye, thinking that he was the culprit.

The old man was relieved since they were fellow sect members, not the enemies.

“No..” Alas, he was losing control. He pointed his shaking finger at Li Qiye and mustered his last breath: “I, I pass my position to him, he, he is the new sect master…”

The last words required everything he had. After this last command, he vomited more blood and closed his eyes.

“Sect Master!” The group rushed over to him while Li Qiye watched silently.

They lamented and cried but the old man was already dead. Not even an immortal could save him now.

The juniors wept while the older seniors exchanged glances, unsure of what to do because of their sect master’s last wish.

“Sir, may I ask for your name?” An elder of the sect with the last name Hu came over and cupped his fist. He had the highest status here and saw the last words in person.

He was under heavy pressure. Though their sect was small, they still had rules and principles regarding the succession process.

Alas, their previous sect master broke the process by passing it to Li Qiye. They needed to deal with this carefully or it might result in chaos.

“Li Qiye.” Li Qiye wasn’t too interested in this trivial matter.

The sect members were at a loss due to this unexpected development. They had just lost their sect master and now, an outsider has become their new leader.

“Sir, may I ask how did you know our sect master?” Elder Hu inquired.

“I don’t, we’ve just met.” Li Qiye told the truth.

This further perplexed the listeners. Their sect master gave his position to a complete stranger?

“We…” Elder Hu was speechless. They were just a small and inexperienced sect, unequipped to deal with this situation.

“Take this.” Li Qiye handed a scroll over to Elder Hu: “Your sect master traded his life for this merit law and gave it to me. You may have it.”

An ancient immortal physique law was considered priceless by many. Li Qiye was one exception.
