Chapter 5845: I Will Never Show My Face

“Well, an inborn chaos dao physique and an inborn trinity true soul, both can drive others to jealousy indeed.” Li Qiye spoke to Primal Ancestor: “Nothing else is worth mentioning, the trinity peacebringer bloodline can’t compare to the physique, let alone the true soul.”

Primal Ancestor’s expression darkened after hearing this.

“Haha!” The big-mouthed Derivation laughed heartily: “You’re right, Dark Crow, Old Primal was driven to insanity, he was born only a tiny bit after Trinity Ancestor, the circumstances were similar, but in reality, the gap was so different. Trinity Ancestor monopolized all that is good in the world, completely unbeatable. Our Primal here, albeit pretty amazing with a nice bloodline, was always the little brother regardless of his efforts. The true soul simply suppressed him.”

Derivation was the least restrained and the most genuine out of the five. Nothing was taboo to him since he wasn’t afraid of offending anyone.

“Ridiculous.” Primal uttered coldly.

“Then why did you scheme against the brat? Is it only for the inborn chaos dao physique? Let’s not lie to ourselves.” Derivation said: “I’m sure you were excited to see Trinity’s defeat. Yes, I knew how you tried to convince the hairy daoist and Imperial Progenitor to take down Trinity too.”

Primal didn’t like that this was being revealed as well.

“However, they felt a little sentimental and didn’t want to do so. Otherwise, all of you could have potentially dealt with that fallen soul and you might have vented all of your hatred and resentment.” Derivation continued.

Listeners in front of the mirror thought that these overlords didn’t get along at all.

“We did not take part.” Imperial Progenitor said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Yes, I’m sure you weren’t pleased but at the very least, you were different from Primal and still cared about the previous relationship. Hahaha, all of us have asked Trinity for help before. Although his attitude and arrogance were unbearable, he did help us when needed. He never harmed us either, only teaching you how to start the dao path or the hairy daoist how to learn all nine scriptures. If it weren’t for the old bastard’s guidance, you two would have to stumble in the dark for much longer.” Derivation said.

“It’s not like you didn’t benefit from him.” Dao Ancestor said.

“Yes, the old bastard taught me the blood path. Of course, he didn’t forget to ridicule me for choosing the path of a vermin, his words. I despised him, that’s why I ate his son. Nevertheless, it’s a shame that the bloodline left behind disappeared, or I could have created something even more explosive. The old bastard looked down on these types of bloodline experiments and abandoned them eventually, or it would have been incredible, what a shame.” Derivation expressed all of his thoughts.

The other overlords scowled and stared at him with derision.

“Don’t give me that look, thinking that I’m crazy and that my intelligence is wasted? You’re not any better, treacherous dogs, clearly benefiting from his guidance while trying to hide it. Instead of repaying the favor, you all were weighed down by jealousy and wished for his early death. I might be mad but at the very least, I was not a hypocrite. You say one thing but your actions tell a different story.” Derivation insulted the group.

Once upon a time, Trinity Ancestor looked down on them but still helped when necessary. Alas, they never appreciated and believed that if they were to have his physique and soul, their achievements would have exceeded his by a long shot - becoming the greatest epoch lord in history.

They viewed him as an idiot who wasted his flawless talents. Once he left, they started competing against each other.

Primal and Derivation shared the same branch but didn’t like each other. The latter was viewed as a madman who also wasted his intelligence by being obsessed with creation.

Derivation also disliked the other four, viewing them as treacherous hypocrites and mentally twisted bastards.

Perhaps in the group, only Imperial Progenitor and Dao Ancestor had a good relationship. Ultimately, their selfish agendas and similar fighting potential created a delicate balance.

If they had to pick one to eliminate first, the unanimous answer would be Derivation. This turned out to be the case when they tried to kill him earlier.

Under normal circumstances, this would be unfavorable to Primal since they were from the blood branch. The death of Derivation meant losing a capable ally and he would be next. He understood this and endured Derivation’s madness all this time.

“Let bygones be bygones.” Primal said: “We share the same enemy today, let’s get through this first.”

“Yes, unite and overcome this peril.” Imperial Progenitor nodded.

“Feel free to do that, I’m not getting involved after you all tried to kill me earlier. I don’t want to be stabbed again.” Derivation sneered, wanting to leave.

“As if Dark Crow would let you go.” Dao Ancestor uttered coldly.

Eyes shifted toward Li Qiye who was standing there with a smile.

“Dark Crow, there’s no deep-seated animosity and feud between us. I even did you a favor by getting these four to come out. If you let me leave, I will never show my face again as long as you still exist. What do you think?” Derivation offered a truce and surprised everyone.
