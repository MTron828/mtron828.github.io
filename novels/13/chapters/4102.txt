Chapter 4103: Asking For Help

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Their impressive auras made people want to prostrate. Of course, these were only intents left behind by them, not the actual dao lords.

Nonetheless, they were mighty enough to stop the maelstrom from pressing down.

“Boom!” Nothing in the world could withstand the onslaught of the black maelstrom. However, the two figures of the dao lord have surpassed the test of time.

They raised their hands and stopped the maelstrom from destroying Armament Mountain.

“Dao lords are invincible indeed!” Spectators were amazed to see this: “Can you imagine if they were here in person?”

Just these images were impressive enough, let alone a dao lord in person. Their divinity and aura would be unstoppable.

Many never had the fortune of seeing one in person. Nonetheless, seeing the two images was enough to stir them to the core.

The members of Armament were crying. Some prostrated and prayed for protection.

Alas, this moment of joy was short-lived. With poofing noises, disciples started disappearing one by one.

It was as if the ground beneath them was covered in trap pits. They were sucked into the dirt and disappeared from sight.

“Sh*t, the disappearance crap is happening again!” Those still around saw this and became frightened.

It didn’t take long before thousands and thousands were gone. Even their treasuries and palaces also vanished.

“Someone’s robbing us!” Regular disciples and ancestors alike turned pale.

“What should we do?” Even the top cultivators felt helpless since they had never seen anything like it before.

“Can we run? Is it too late to run?” One ancestor wondered.

Things were still disappearing despite being under the protection of dao lords’ blessings. The entire sect seemed to be cursed right now.

Unfortunately, there was no good option for them. Staying might result in suddenly vanishing. Eventually, not a single soul would be left. As for escaping? Armament would eventually collapse and they would become orphans without a home.

“What is happening in there?” Spectators outside were confused.

Due to the images of the two dao lords, heavenly gazes became considerably less effective. Nonetheless, the flickering barrier was obviously weakening.

“Sect Master, what should we do?” An ancestor asked Shi Yingxue.

“Keep it together, I will go seek reinforcement.” She gritted her teeth and left.

Shi Yingxue flew out of Armament and entered the Tang’s plain. She saw Li Qiye and prostrated: “Young Noble, please save Armament Mountain.”

“You’re putting me in a rather difficult position. I’m not one to hold a grudge but Armament is my enemy right now, more or less. If I were to become your savior out of nowhere, that might be too big of a change for me to get used to.” Li Qiye was still relaxing on his chair.

“Our members had eyes but couldn’t see Mount Tai. I will bear all the consequences and punishment without uttering a single word of grievance as long as you show benevolence by saving us.” She begged.

Of course, she had nothing to do with the invasion of the plain. She initially wanted him to help Armament Mountain. However, the moment she got back, she was forced to go under isolated cultivation. The sect was then left to Celestial Ape Demon King.

To a certain extent, with her gone, the God Ape branch took over Armament. Alas, she still wanted to be responsible for the sect despite a lack of fault in the matter. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“How can I refuse when you are being so insincere? It’s not difficult for me to save your sect, but I wonder if you can pay the price.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Everything in Armament can be yours as long as you can save us.” She kept her head near the ground.

There was no point in bartering because destruction was imminent.

“How generous. I still want that peak though.” Li Qiye rubbed his chin and said.

“I will take charge in this matter and accept. It is yours, Young Noble.” She gritted her teeth and said, aware of which peak he was referring to.

The ancestral peak was extremely important to Armament for many reasons. No ancestors dared to use it as a negotiating tool. Alas, this existential crisis forced Yingxue to agree without any hesitation.

She knew the potential consequences even in the case of success. She would become the sinner of the sect for disrespecting the forefathers. In the worst scenario, she would be forfeiting her life. In the best scenario, she would lose the sect master position.

Nonetheless, she needed to be decisive right now in order to save Armament. What was the point of keeping the ancestral peak when the rest of Armament was gone?

“Smart, and I like smart people. I will make an exception this time and help you out.” Li Qiye said.

“Thank you, Young Noble, I will dedicate the rest of my life to serving you.” She was moved to tears after hearing this.

“Rise, I can’t handle tears from a beauty.” He waved his hand.

She stood up and knew that her sect was saved. Others thought that Li Qiye was only a newly rich, not a supreme character like the Five Overlords.

However, intuition told her that he was the only one who could save Armament Mountain.

“Let’s go then.” Li Qiye smiled and activated the earth’s loop again. The loop became resplendent, not with the frightening beam but rather tiny rays.
