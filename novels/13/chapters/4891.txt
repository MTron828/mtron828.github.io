Chapter 4892: Fire On A Cold Day

“Sigh, it is a cold day. I need to warm up.” Li Qiye seemed to be lamenting the situation. He rubbed his palms together before using fire tongs to pick up a piece of charcoal from the brazier.

The moment it was taken out, the embers dissipated.

“Are you cold, little girl?” He asked A’zhui.

Though A’zhui was a dao lord’s daughter, she couldn’t do anything in this perilous moment. She was too weak compared to the enemies.

Alas, she couldn’t run either. As the princess, she was ready to die with the dynasty.

“Run away.” She whispered to Li Qiye, realizing the gravity of the situation.

Li Qiye smiled and glanced at the charcoal: “Okay, feeling a bit warmer.”

He then turned toward the enemies and asked: “Where were we?”

“You are picking death, do not blame me for this.” Monochromatic became annoyed and uttered coldly. He exuded a chilling murderous intent afterward.

All Ten Monsters were ruthless. His eyes caused members of Eight-stallion to shudder as if they were trapped in a layer of ice.

“It is not too late to kneel and beg for forgiveness.” Li Qiye stared at the charcoal as if it was a priceless treasure: “Otherwise, today will be your last.”

“Who is going to kill me, you?” Monochromatic suddenly felt Li Qiye becoming a different person, no longer as naive as before.

“Yes, it is not hard for me to kill a few dogs.” Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye.

This infuriated Toad King and Fire Ape. Others quivered in fear after hearing their title. Some immediately got on their knees upon sight. Being called “dogs” by a nobody was unprecedented.

“Your remark deserves a flaying.” Fire Ape shouted.

“That’s too merciful. Let me marinade and take my time eating him. He’ll feel every bite.” Toad King smiled nefariously.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Fire Ape was terrifying but Toad King was even creepier and nauseating. Of course, both of them had done this before. The latter enjoyed eating humans.

“Appreciate your last seconds then.” Li Qiye said softly.

Listeners found this hilarious. A junior daring to threaten the Ten Monsters?

“Die brat!” Toad King sucked in and his mouth became larger.

“Shit!” Many immediately fled after seeing this.

“Whoosh!” He then spat out a liquid miasma of cyan color.

It brimmed with death energy. Even the palaces nearby turned into fluid; the ground was next.

“Ahh!” Weaker cultivators had festering boils, unable to stop the corrosion regardless of their merit laws and treasures.

“Watch it!” Firerage shouted and unsheathed his saber. He swung it to release six slashes, creating a fiery domain to stop the miasma.

Alas, the saber domain capable of burning everything couldn’t stop the miasma and started melting.

“Zzz…” One particle touched him and his body started corroding right away. He used his dao flame to burn that part to no avail. He then decisively cut off a piece of flesh, finally managing to rid himself of the miasma.

“Your Majesty, retreat!” He could only help Li Qiye run away from these mighty foes.

“Mmm, it’s nothing.” Li Qiye said and blew on the charcoal in the direction of the miasma.

Little fiery sparks blew in that direction and burned all the miasma at an incredible pace.

“Boom!” After a loud explosion, all the miasma in the air and on the ground disappeared from sight.

“Ahh!” The sparks then fell on Toad King, causing an inferno to engulf him.

“Destroy!” He spat out miasma from his mouth and all other potential holes. This poisonous fluid could destroy a kingdom. For example, the domain of an Immortal Sovereign couldn’t stop it earlier.

Therefore, it could extinguish flames as well. Alas, it only intensified the inferno ravaging him. Only one second passed before his physical flesh was reduced to ashes.

“Whoosh!” His true fate protected by the two sacred fruits escaped into the horizon.

Alas, the inferno caught the true fate as well. The dao fruits exuded their power and chaos energy but this was useless.

All three entities became trapped in an ocean of fire.

“Ahhh!” His last screams echoed across the battlefield.

“What is this sorcery?!” Fire Ape was shocked and went on the offensive, spewing out a beam of fire from the head on his chest.

“Maddened Dao!” The entire capital became subjected to unbearable heat.
