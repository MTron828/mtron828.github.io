Chapter 5494: Compassionate And Full Of Love

“The cycle can actually be severed?” Immortal Emperor Mu Zhuo didn’t believe that this was possible.

Others preferred a continuation of their cycle since they would keep their memories and karma. As for him, this would be useless since the world-weary dao would follow him.

Since heaven and earth hated him, his fate was being kicked out of the reincarnation cycle. Natural death would not come, and the same for reincarnation into a different being. True death would only be possible with the thorough destruction of his dao.

Now, Li Qiye was talking about something even greater.

“I have an idea.” Li Qiye said.

“It can’t work, not even if you’re an epoch lord. You might be able to sever the cycle but not bring someone back to life.” He shook his head in disbelief.

Moreover, who would want to do it for someone else? This was akin to creating life - something only available to the villainous heaven.

“No, it is simply impossible.” He concluded.

“Your dao is at the apex. Even if I add you to the cycle for reincarnation, it will still follow you.” Li Qiye said.

He sighed and knew that this was the truth. His damnation seemed to be permanent.

“No matter what the method is, since heaven loathes me, the price will be incalculable…” He said.

“Not necessarily.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“Not even you can break this rule.” He shook his head.

Rebirth was impossible, not to mention rebirth and severing the karmic cycle. Li Qiye’s ability wasn’t the issue here. Why would Li Qiye pay the heavy price for him to live again?

“I can’t do it, but someone else can.” Li Qiye said.

“Who?” He blurted out but knew that there was only one possible answer.

Li Qiye pointed at the sky, causing the emperor to be frozen in astonishment.

The villainous heaven could certainly do this, but why for the sake of an ant?

“I have my methods.” Li Qiye said.

This left him in silence again. Why would Li Qiye do so much for him when they were nothing more than acquaintances if that?

“Why me?” He asked.

If Li Qiye could revive him on top of serving the karmic cycle, he could also do it for someone else. Thus, he should be saving this for whoever he cared the most about.

“No one should have endured such suffering in this world so you deserve another chance. The villainous heaven probably won’t let it end like this either.” Li Qiye said.

He stared at Li Qiye with skepticism, naturally not buying this nonsense.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“That’s just who I am, compassionate and full of love for everyone, don’t you think?” Li Qiye added.

“No.” He answered flatly.

“Sigh, that hurts. Well, if I’m not who I claim to be, would I be here for your corpse?” Li Qiye lamented.

“Sure, collecting my corpse is compassionate and kind-hearted. But as for reviving me, there is certainly an ulterior motive behind this.” He nodded first before disagreeing.

“I’m sad that you think of me this way.” Li Qiye smiled wryly.

“What do you actually want?” He simply didn’t understand Li Qiye’s motive. He was far from being the strongest Immortal Emperor, not to mention his repulsive dao. He was nothing in the eyes of someone like Li Qiye. In fact, he was more of a burden than anything.

“As I stand here enduring your nauseating aura and being infected by it, I have to listen to you doubting me? Tell me, what could I possibly want from you?” Li Qiye appeared sad.

“That’s the part I don’t understand. There’s nothing in it for you.” He shook his head in response.

This wasn’t a matter of self-hate but he truly didn’t have anything worth coveting. The cons far outweighed the pros in this situation. Li Qiye wasn’t someone who was known for taking risks either.

“In all seriousness.” Li Qiye stared at him earnestly and said: “Indeed, you have nothing that I need, neither in your current state nor in the past.”

“What about the future?” Although he was indifferent to everything, this statement actually stirred him because of the implication.
