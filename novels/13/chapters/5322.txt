Chapter 5323: Dreadful?

“How is she dreadful? Is she purposely trying to seduce everyone?” Li Qiye shook his head while smiling.

“Well…” Zhitian only heard about the legends regarding her irresistible charms, nothing else regarding immoral acts.

“These remarks are manifestations of a man’s rage and incompetence, an attempt to shift the blame to women.” Li Qiye said.

“That does make sense.” Zhitian said.

“Your future is boundless since you can become an amazing dragon lord. However, if you were to meet Heaven’s Allure and be lost in infatuation, throwing away your cultivation and only wanting to have her. Your insanity grows with time, unable to possess her. This madness eventually results in a wasted life, committing unnecessary killing and such…” Li Qiye said with a smile.

Meanwhile, Zhitian feared for his future while listening.

“The question is, whose fault is it? Did Heaven’s Allure cause this?” Li Qiye asked.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“She did not.” Zhitian answered.

“You are able to answer confidently right now because your sanity remains. This might not be the case once you’re stuck in the negative mindset, unable to see reality for what it is, unable to accept your own inability. Thus, you blame her for all of your troubles.” Li Qiye said: “Therefore, for the majority of cases, kingdom-toppling beauties were wrongfully blamed by those who have lost their way. It’s easier to shift the blame to others instead of admitting one’s mistakes, then there’s no sense of guilt.” Li Qiye finished.

“Thank you for correcting me, Young Noble, I will keep this to heart.” Zhitian bowed and accepted his mistake.

“The fallen ones all had their excuses. These lords blamed the world, that it was too boring and worthless, nothing worth holding on to…” Li Qiye then stared at the old servant: “But one’s actions come from their heart just like anima, it has nothing to do with the outside world. You just need to maintain this and not be shaken. So what if the world is less than adequate? You are still you, an apex cultivator. As long as your dao heart is there, the darkness won’t be able to reach you and no one can force you to join.”

“Is this the core of cultivation?” The old servant asked.

“That’s one way to put it. The pursuit of cultivation should be to obtain an unshakable dao heart. With this, one can create and use the dao. The former is far more important than the latter. When your dao heart is supreme, so are your techniques and abilities. When your dao heart is weak, your power is nothing more than a tool for darkness, serving to push you deeper into the abyss.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand, only the dao heart can make the darkness recede.” The old servant took a deep breath and bowed.

“Raa!” True Bear let out a roar as well before bowing.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye smiled and stretched before moving onward.

When they came out of the ocean floor, they saw Coldflame and Sword Queen still fighting each other.

“How long is this going to last?” Zhitian asked.

“It’s over when the state of duality is broken.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Who do you think will win, Young Noble?” The old servant was curious as well since he was also an apex cultivator. The outcome of this fight served as a significant reference point.

“Sword Queen will win.” Li Qiye said: “Her sword dao focuses on longevity and her vitality is ample, she can last several more eras.”

“And Coldflame Conqueror?” Zhitian asked. Anyone could see that his talent was impeccable. However, he was still overshadowed by the founder of this dao.

“Coldflame’s dao originates from Maddened.” Li Qiye said: “No matter its current form, the essence is still of the maddened flame. He uses the ice affinity to quell the raging flames but the harmony is only temporary. Imperfections will surface during the constant cycles and that is when he will lose to Sword Queen.”

The two combatants had their own absolute domain, always pushing back and forth. They were in a state of absolute concentration - nothing could bother them.

However, they also heard Li Qiye’s casual remark and Coldflame Conqueror glanced at Li Qiye.

“Sounds like this will still take a while.” Zhitian could see the current state of balance between the two domains.

“This could end much faster, just one sword technique from her.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Really?” Zhitian was surprised.

“This is a hopeless situation for the ice affinity since the maddened flame will resurface in due time. It just needs a precise catalyst.” Li Qiye said.

Sword Queen lost her focus as well while Coldflame could tell that there was logic in the comments.

“Clank!” The everlasting sword domain suddenly receded, no longer trying to take down the ice-fire domain.
