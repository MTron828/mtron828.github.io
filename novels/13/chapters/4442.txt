Chapter 4443: Dangerous Area

“Boom!” This heatwave incinerated all in its path.

The duo had entered a different area with countless volcanos. They spewed out lava and created a fiery ocean.

The temperature here was naturally unbearable to mortals. Even cultivators had a hard time resisting.

The lava here was different from the lava seen in the mortal realm. They had long trails of flames with a violet color, capable of piercing the earth. One would get the impression that they were once the hardest metals before being melted into this form.

Nonetheless, the demon god could still withstand this temperature. He certainly lived up to his fame.

He didn’t dare to underestimate it and activated his energy. “Buzz.” A radiance pulsed around him and numerous halos appeared. Nine fluffy fox tails could also be seen.

Each of them had a different color. Upon closer inspection, instead of fur, they were made of tiny strings of dao chains. They were brimming with power and resembled nine supreme grand dao.

As they fluttered in the air, they seemed like nine spirit veins. Each smashing down could destroy a kingdom.

He created multiple layers of dao protection in no time at all. This wasn’t an attempt to show off his power in front of Li Qiye. He knew that he was merely displaying his slight skill before an expert.

He has been here several times and experienced the broken spatial structure. Thus, he knew better than to be careless even though Li Qiye was here.

As for Li Qiye, he instantly crossed through a large region and then jumped into a surging volcano.

“Boom!” The lava rushed out, seemingly agitated by the intruders, and roared like a primal beast.

The two immediately delved deeper into the volcano. Li Qiye raised his hand and activated his grand dao, fixating the right time and space. Coordinates were forced to show themselves.

He stepped onto the right node and was teleported away. The demon also copied his movement.

When the latter took note of his new location, he saw that they were floating in a boundless space with stars. He couldn’t see the end in sight despite activating his heavenly gaze.

A deathly silence existed as if it was a stationary world. Of course, this wasn’t the case.

From a distance were galaxies flowing and bright starry lights. This flow resembled the changes of a grand dao.

Li Qiye stopped moving, looking like a statue and becoming one with this area. The god observed carefully and noted that Li Qiye was waiting for the right time.

Alas, time didn’t wait for them because after a loud explosion, a spatial storm formed around them with a blinding radiance.

It seemed that there used to be stars hidden around them. However, the moment the duo got here, they started shifting away and releasing countless rays.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the force from their shift could destroy anything. A sect master would be completely helpless and be reduced to dust from a single shift.

At this moment, the duo was facing countless spatial shifts as the main target. If they couldn’t block it, the area around them would turn back to the origin and so would they.

“Activate!” The demon god was prepared for the countless explosive rays.

He became shrouded in radiance as he summoned his totems. One tail released numerous dao waterfalls and turned into a barrier.

“Rumble!” The rays easily pushed through the first barrier.

This didn’t deter him. His second tail swung forward like a divine sword - offense was the best defense.

It created a sharp domain and separated them from the rest of the world, using distance to stop the incoming rays.

Time stagnated during the exchange. The rays from the stars could be seen clearly after entering the domain. At the start, they were slowed down by its effect.

“Boom!” Alas, the suppressed waves came relentlessly and eventually destroyed the domain.

If spectators were present, they would be shocked because the first two defensive lines were immaculate. Alas, they were still not enough to stop the star explosions.

“Go!” The demon god used his third tail for a technique resembling a dragon leaping from the water and leaving a long trail in its wake.

This supreme dao encompassed numerous affinities - celestial, yin and yang… It tried to drag all of the explosions into its path.

He was doing a great job dealing with the explosions. Meanwhile, Li Qiye made it look easy. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The latter casually smacked the incoming ray. Those coming from the right would be sent to the left and vice versa. They didn’t seem destructive at all and were as feeble as tree branches.

Numerous rays from all eight directions came for Li Qiye. Alas, they just started flying out chaotically after reaching him.
