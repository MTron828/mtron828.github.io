Chapter 4425: Five-sun Lotus

The eastern coalition became agitated because the majority of the ancestors in this group worked under Five-sun King.

“His Majesty shall not be sullied by your dirty tongue!” Featherhat Paragon rebuked.

“Today shall be your last day in this world, and it shall be a long day!” The ex-sect master became livid.

His vitality erupted continuously as he was ready to unleash his wrath. His son was everything to him so what Li Qiye had done was unforgivable.

Insulting himself was one thing but to speak ill of his son? He would do anything to make them pay since he cherished his son more than himself.

Li Qiye ignored the threats and pointed the saber forward with the blade slanting horizontally.

“Perish!” The ex-sect master activated his dao halos as well.

“Rumble!” Twelve fate palaces rushed to the sky along with the halos. They circled around each other in harmony - a total of seven.

“Seven-dao Sovereign.” An expert said.

Those nearby weren’t that frightened. For ordinary cultivators, a seven-dao sovereign was an apex existence.

However, the sect master of a great power was only at the seventh level, not even a Golden Sovereign? This was awfully disappointing.

No wonder why he didn’t accomplish much during his rule outside of siring a capable son.

“Boom!” After he fully channeled his dao power, he formed a mudra and summoned a treasure: “Activate!”

Five-colored particle beams shot out from the ground beneath him. They came together to form a five-colored lotus, as radiant as can be.

As more particles rushed out, the flower gradually blossomed and raised him up. The petals resembled indomitable walls; the entire flower served as the safest fortress.

“Five-sun Lotus!” An eastern master shouted.

This was a defensive artifact with petals as tough as divine walls, capable of stopping numerous waves of attack. Some believed that it could stop the majority of offensive techniques in existence.

“Clank!” He summoned a crimson spear with flames coursing through it. It had the intensity of the sun and could incinerate anything.

“Five-sun Spear!” This was another weapon recognized by the eastern coalition.

“Such magnificent pieces of equipment!” An ancestor from a great power murmured.

The two artifacts offered both offense and defense. His possession of them made others feel envious because other ancestors at the seventh level wouldn’t have something similar.

“Junior, come accept death!” He became emboldened after brandishing his artifacts.

Li Qiye chuckled after seeing the awe-inspiring old man and chuckled: “Make your move already, no need to be proud when you’re only at the seventh level.”

The ex-sect master nearly vomited blood again. He then bellowed: “Five Suns Incinerating The Heaven!”

The spear in his hand released numerous spear images with five embedded colors. They also were blessed with incredible heat. This raging inferno swept towards Li Qiye like an ocean, wanting to drown him. Each single spear was deadly sharp, capable of piercing all defenses.

“Quite strong!” Many ancestors were surprised to see this.

The power of this move far exceeded the reach of a seventh-dao sovereign. This was due to his artifacts empowering him.

The young ones, on the other hand, were horrified by the attack. They knew that they would have no chance of blocking it.

“What do you think?” The outcome was still up for debate due to the disparity in cultivation.

“Li Qiye is always unpredictable.” Some were always confident in Li Qiye despite his opponent’s powerful artifacts and technique.

“Not bad.” Li Qiye casually commented and instantly made his move. A gentle saber hymn could be heard.

“He did it!” Everyone gazed intensely at Li Qiye’s saber, the three ancient demons included.

The previous draw was virtually imperceptible. However, this one was disappointing in comparison. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The last flash resulted in a triple decapitation. This time, the swing was awfully simple and slow. In fact, “slow” was an understatement.

Alas, one could actually hear a faint phoenix screech. The divine bird seemed to be flying out, just lacking an actual form and aura.

“This… this is my saber technique…” Jian Qingzhu only took a second to realize something and became shocked.
