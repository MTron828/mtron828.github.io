Chapter 5681: You Fell To The Darkness For Too Long

“Because I came with kindness, they felt it deep in my heart and became willing to accept me. My kindness brought hope to all.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Kindness, right. It ended with them dead and their territories going to you.” The being said with contempt.

“That was due to their internal strife. I pitied the land and had to take good care of it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Say what you must, but I already knew of your true nature way back then.” The being said with conviction.

“Have you thought about where you went wrong? In my opinion, your members wanted to go on an expedition yet you never gave them any help. They wanted to work with you yet you refused from a distance. Was your failure partly due to you losing the heart of the people?” Li Qiye said.

“The heart of the people? Useless in Heavenrealm.” The being sneered.

“That is your opinion, you looked down on newcomers, thinking that they overestimated themselves yet they still managed to thrive under such harsh circumstances and built their own homes. That’s the heart of the people. You stagnated in your stronghold, why? Because you were selfish.” Li Qiye criticized.

“What you call thriving is merely being lucky. If the judgment hadn’t paused, they would have been reduced to ashes.”

“Geezer Zhao and the others? How come when I was around, I didn’t see them come to smash my place at all?” Li Qiye said.

“Deactivate those things outside and we’ll see if they come or not.” The being snorted.

“Oh, so they’re that useful?” Li Qiye stroked his chin and said: “I didn’t know I was at risk at all, looks like I was lucky.”

“After you left, they still wanted to destroy your place, that nest of insects.” The being continued.

“You all really know how to flatter yourselves, what are you then if not a bunch of monsters living a borrowed life? You watched young talents striving and struggling under the sun and called them insects? If they’re insects, then you all are maggots in the dung pit.” Li Qiye retorted.

“Hmph.” The being scowled in response: “Where I stand is the source of light, the celestial pillar.”

“Unfortunately, that’s all in the past.” Li Qiye waved his hand: “Do you see any light coming from you now? Geezer Zhao might be a bastard but at least he holds steady. The same can’t be said about the abomination you have become.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You!” The being was too angry to speak.

“The old you who couldn’t reach Terminus was eligible for judgment. Now, you have lost the chance entirely, being fully disqualified.” Li Qiye struck the dark being’s weak point, leaving him speechless.

He smiled and continued: “Therefore, no matter how you walk around in circles, you will still have to be Trinity Ancestor in the end.”

After a long pause, the being uttered coldly: “You’ve been gone for too long, Heavenrealm is no longer the same. Light and darkness will be redefined and a new era will come.”

“You believe someone can take down the villainous heaven in that attempt? Who? The shadow right beneath?” Li Qiye smiled.

“You know what happened in the nine worlds and Eight Desolaces.” The being said.

“Yes, but I don’t think they will amount to anything. Sure, they will force the villainous heaven to perform a full sweep, but that’s it. They will not be able to kill him.” Li Qiye nodded.

“This is a massive pit that even the villainous heaven might not be able to fill.” The being said.

“You all believe that as long as he jumps in, you’ll be able to bury him, right?” Li Qiye said.

“When that day comes, we will challenge the high heaven.” The being said.

“Don’t you think that the pit might serve as a burial for you all as well?” Li Qiye asked.

The being didn’t respond.

Li Qiye shrugged and said: “Of course you all are aware but it’s best not to think about it to maintain morale and confidence, that everything will be better after getting through this.”

“It depends on who can last longer when the harsh winter comes. It is not necessarily the smallest ones who will freeze to death but the largest.” The being said.

“That I do not deny, it is possible that a few rabbits won’t be the only ones to starve to death, it could be a brown bear as well. Now that the pit is dug, it’s time to wait for them to die while taking cover, waiting for the storm to pass before returning to take care of the aftermath. This is one of the reasons why you wanted to crawl back regardless of the losses.” Li Qiye said.

“Sure, I will not be comfortable, but what about your disciples and followers? They will either freeze to death or become winter food for others.” The being said.

“Such a possibility exists.” Li Qiye smiled: “However, as long as the roots are deep enough, buds will sprout and branches will grow after the winter. We will be able to persevere until the winter is over because I am here, always here, with an eternal will.”

He stared at the being and his voice seemed to drag on for a while as he emphasized: “As for you, when you turn back, you will find that everything has distanced from you or you had already destroyed them. Trinity Ancestor is no more, everything you desire is just a fantasy, all around you will collapse.”

The golden skeleton became resplendent and harmonized with Li Qiye’s words. It suppressed the dark power, causing the being to groan in pain - seemingly weakened.

“Buzz.” However, a natural force emerged from the darkness and stopped the golden light.

This only lasted for the blink of an eye and the dark being regained his power.

“Looks like you have fallen into the darkness for too long and have made up your mind. Your inborn dao chaos physique cannot destroy you.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Don’t forget that I am the inborn trinity true soul, destroying me is easier said than done.” The being said.

“I see, Trinity Ancestor has permanently disappeared and will not come back to life. The most powerful existence with the perfect physique and soul capable of reaching the high heaven is no more. The moment you fell into the darkness, your body and soul separated entirely and cannot merge again. Trinity Ancestor is nothing more than an empty shell with a hollow reputation now.” Li Qiye concluded.

“Provoking me doesn’t work, I will not fuse with this physique again or return to life. I am me now, an inborn trinity true self!”

“Well, let’s say that’s the case. Can you escape from this skeleton?” Li Qiye smirked.
