Chapter 4952: Heaven Suppression Shawl

Demon Conqueror was historically great - gaining twelve dao fruits in one go. Initially, the conqueror hailed from Demon Dao and started the deity system there. He then, for unknown reasons, broke it and turned into a conqueror instead.

His life stories became legends for the six continents. He fought gallantly against both Dao Alliance and Heaven Alliance, making his way to Celestial Court and Immortal City.

He had studied at the academy before and finally, he left behind his peerless treasure during a previous ceremony. Hearts started beating faster in the presence of Immortal Beasts.

Another notable treasure resembled a star with a rhombus shape, far brighter than any celestial body in the sky. Its blinding radiance overshadowed everything else.

Time had no power here; it would always be radiant regardless of the era.

“That’s the one left behind by Luminous Conqueror?” One student brought up a legend.

“Yes, you are looking at Luminous Temporal Star.” An older friend nodded.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This one gained many fans just like the previous top treasures. It was rumored that this particular star had a life-prolongment effect.

It was given to the academy despite being the conqueror’s favorite treasure.

Everyone had heard about his legend before. It started with him being ambushed by Deity due to his overwhelming talent. Despite already having a dao fruit at that point, he still died an early death. Though his dao fruit crumbled, a remnant strand remained. It took root in the ground and grew again, allowing rebirth and revenge.

But what about the journey before the completion of the primordial fruit? His body was as feeble as a mortal so he wisely chose the academy.

It was there for him during his lowest and weakest moments, granting him peace so that he could cultivate again. Therefore, his gift to the academy was his beloved treasure.

On another side of a mountain - nearly reaching the peak - was a piece of cloth resembling a scarf. It was thin and illusory like the mist itself. However, it seemed capable of shielding three thousand worlds and suppressing gods.

This couldn’t possibly be made in the mortal world but rather, a vestige from an immortal world. No living beings in the lower realms were worthy of it.

“Heaven Suppression Shawl…” One student murmured: “Our ancestor’s biggest dream while being a student here was earning its recognition.”

“That’s quite a dream because the shawl is definitely among the top five treasures of this mountain. Students have tried and failed across the eras.” His friend shook his head.

“What if I’m the fateful one who will be deserving of Nightmoon Conqueror’s approval?” The student said.

Heaven Suppression Shawl was Nightmoon Conqueror’s gift to the academy. She was a disciple here from her debut until her ascension.

“I’m not that ambitious, I’ll be satisfied with a treasure from a dragon lord.” Another student joined in. Many shared this same sentiment.

During this special ceremony, all students could enter the divine mountain. As long as the treasures agreed, they would be able to take them away without exchanging anything.

The boundless generosity of the academy was usually paid back in full by grateful alumni. Thus, the mountain never had a lack of treasures since it wasn’t a one-sided event.

Some students truly appreciated the academy and walked up the mountain, leaving behind their precious treasure.

When they pinned the treasures to the ground, a bright flash would occur. Runes hovered around the given treasures and accepted them as part of the mountain. These treasures would stay here, awaiting their future masters.

The event was in full swing. Some climbed up and tried to achieve dao harmonization by activating their merit laws, hoping to take some treasures away.

“I want to try for Skyquake Dao Controller, you guys in?” An ambitious friend walked to the top with his group.

Alas, when they got there, they saw someone already sitting in front of the treasure - Radiant Young Monarch.

He activated his bright dao and phenomena, enveloping the treasure with his aura. He hoped to gain its recognition.

Others desired Heaven Suppression Shawl only to find that someone else got ahead of them - Swordgrasp Young Noble.

He focused his sword dao into a single point, wanting to show the treasure his suppressive affinity as well. Alas, this didn’t seem to be going well.

“Immortal Beasts is occupied as well, Halo Scion.” One student complained.

Halo Scion released his halo, wrapping it around the cane. This was his goal in coming here.

“Whatever, these geniuses want the top treasures, we won’t have a shot.” Students began giving up, not wanting to compete against them.

They thought that it was better to find treasures meant for them, hoping to be on the right side of the mystical “fate”.

Near the bottom of the mountain, students started clamoring and got out of the way. This was because they saw someone with a chilling aura walking up - Bloodsea Blade.

The geniuses near the top got up as well and stared at him cautiously. He had killed three dragon lords from Deity recently, clearly harboring no love for their side. They were afraid that he might suddenly start massacring students from Deity.
