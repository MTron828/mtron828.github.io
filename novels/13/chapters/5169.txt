Chapter 5170: Bring About Longlasting Peace

The rays alone could illuminate three thousand worlds and command respect and attention. How could two mere flowers possess such wonders?

“Soulbearer Cosmic Vessel.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

The name made it sound like a boat but in reality, this was a unique alchemy flower. Li Qiye needed them in order to hold the soul of that corpse.

According to the rumors, the fairies turned into Immortal’s Peak during their wait. In reality, they actually died here and implanted a strand of their soul into the flowers.

They waited and waited but alas, time ran out for them. Nonetheless, their obsession and desire remained; they hoped that the wait could continue even after death. This became possible after they came across this special flower.

“Let’s meet again then.” Li Qiye sighed and woke up the souls.

“Buzz.” The rays turned into waves of light afterward, eventually culminating into an ocean of light with two figures at the center. One was a gentle orchid while the other had the might of a war god.

They were supreme in both physical appearance and temperament, looking to be a perfect pair. As they gazed upon Li Qiye, time reversed back to Dongting Lake of the nine worlds.

Alas, these sweet memories were too short and the last separation was final. In this ephemeral moment, Li Qiye suddenly had a thought of just being a fisherman back at the lake - no soaring through the air or connecting a grand plan.

Working at sunrise and resting at sunset like a mortal, spending time with his loved ones. Even a few short decades were more than enough.

“Everything becomes nothing in due time, no need to worry.” He gently caressed their face.

Although these were soul remnants, they were still sentient and could feel his touch. Tears inadvertently streamed down their cheeks.

The presence of love made life worth living. On the contrary, was it worth living for ages in an icy solitude? That would drive anyone crazy in time.

They became satisfied with the meeting and pointed at the sky.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Boom!” The area suddenly changed and a mirror manifested into reality. It depicted a battle starting with descending emperors.

Emperors and monarchs from The People rushed to meet them, resulting in an earth-shattering clash where blood flowed like rivers. One emperor and monarch fell after another.

Eventually, a loud detonation interrupted the battle and a dark portal opened, making way for a dark hand. It completely obliterated all the emperors standing in its way.

The alliance was overpowered until reinforcement came - a group of female cultivators normally praised as empresses and fairies.

They harnessed the power of a heavenly dao and started a realm of beasts alongside a primordial forest. Even a wheel of time was created for this battle. These various domains empowered and granted them enough power to fight their enemies.

They slew opposing emperors and eventually took down the gigantic dark hand. Alas, images of their death also popped up in the mirror.

Despite persevering and winning the battle, the majority of emperors and empresses exhausted their strength. Some perished from severe injuries while others’ lifespan came to an end.

“A longlasting peace due to their sacrifices.” Li Qiye lamented.

The emperors and monarchs used their power and lifespan to support the various domains, granting both offense and defense to the empresses. The latter exchanged everything and came out victoriously against the dark hand.

The loss in this battle was just as devastating as Immorial Epoch War. The only difference was the relative lack of involvement from Immortal Dao City and Celestial Court.

With that, the mirror disappeared and the stars returned. The two saints then stared at Li Qiye in unison.

Though they wanted this moment to last forever, their soul was on the verge of disappearing.

“Poof!” The light around them dimmed down.

In this split second, the well-prepared Li Qiye utilized a primordial dao. It locked and stabilized their soul fragments.

This was easier said than done. After all, controlling a primordial dao required an immense understanding of life. The two figures remained and didn’t disperse.

“Creak.” Li Qiye slowly opened the coffin of the Qian, revealing the corpse that was immersed in Yin Sever Aqua.

He then took his time understanding the flowers before using an ultimate art to extract its essences.

“Buzz.” With a slight grasp, he released the starry rays down into the aqua.

Stars appeared in this special liquid and started forming their own cosmo. Life conversed and took shape regardless of the tribulations. Even a soul in the afterlife would be able to slowly return to the mortal world.
