Chapter 5047: Surrounded

Two had human forms while the third was a rabbit.

“Bloodfly God, Nightwalker, Lunar Rabbit.” The demons bowed before the commanding gods.

Each had their own unique seal that would only go away at death. Most demons also had their own tablet. However, they chose to keep it secretive for many reasons.

Only the commanding gods had no qualms in displaying theirs. This was a symbol of authority and power.

The crowd took advantage of this moment and analyzed each one.

Bloodfly God was still intimidating as ever; his red eyes instilling pain and fear.

Nightwalker, on the other hand, appeared more reasonable. Nonetheless, he had a serious expression right now given the circumstances. No one would ever connect him with Shadowrider due to his gentle demeanor.

The third maintained its original form - a gray rabbit that looked smooth and shiny as if it was made from jade - smooth and chilly to the touch.

Despite this tiny form, it looked rather inspiring with the image of a moon behind it. The area around the moon rotated the entire time. Its eyes were also different, seemingly made from the darkest jade in the world instead of the regular red.

A lunar rabbit was a rare species, precious and powerful. This one assumed the role of a commanding god, meaning that it was rather frightening.

Two other thrones were present but they were empty.

“Vine God and Dream Monarch aren’t here.” Others whispered among themselves.

Other commanding gods should be here to bid farewell to Peacock Monarch. Their inappropriate absence was duly noted.

“The situation looks bad. They should have been here.” Goldcrest spoke with the group.

“You’re saying that Vine God is really in trouble?” Ming Shi recalled Nightwalker’s warning.

“I hope not.” Goldcrest shook his head. Potentially losing three commanding gods would deal a great blow to Demon’s prestige.

“Boom!” Suddenly, someone appeared above the great tree. People felt as if they had just been stomped on the chest.

Two more figures accompanied him and released their threatening auras.

“Skystomper God!” Everyone recognized the leader and his two junior brothers.

They didn’t have time to think because another mighty aura emerged as well, frightening both humans and demons.

Four more giants landed. They were also dragon lords, far stronger than the majority of cultivators present.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Pagoda Guardian and the three giants too?” Someone else said.

Most could tell that something big was happening. This group definitely didn’t come to bid farewell to Peacock Monarch.

“I am here just in time to pay my respect, Peacock Monarch.” A charismatic voice sounded and light engulfed the forest.

It was none other than Radiant Monarch who had just teleported onto the scene.

“Radiant Monarch too?” Spectators had a bad feeling about this.

“What are they doing?” Ming Shi wondered: “Are they trying to steal the deity spot? Can outsiders do this?”

“It’s impossible, at least in theory.” Goldcrest responded: “It’s just the monarch passing away, the god source isn’t there.”

He found this rather strange as if there was a sinister plan behind it.

“Then why are they here?” Ming Shi asked.

Li Qiye glanced at the sky and said: “We got a show.”

The group consisted of eight dragon lords, three of whom had six sacred fruits. The others all had five. Such a force was enough to sweep through the lower continents.

They clearly had other intentions than just paying respect to the monarch. This was clear with their aggressive entrance.

“Hahaha, the heroes of the world are so kind, to travel so far for a visit before my death.” Peacock Monarch laughed and said.

The dragon lords didn’t answer and stood there patiently.

“Screech!” Chillglare Hawk let out a cry piercing through space. Others trembled in fear but the dragon lords weren’t afraid.
