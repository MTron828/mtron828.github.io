Chapter 5178: Good Dogs Don’t Block The Road

“You got your floating immortal lotus now, it is time to leave.” Li Qiye told her and started leaving.

She didn’t expect him to leave so soon and hesitated for a second before mustering the courage to call out: “Young Noble, where are you going?”

He didn’t stop to answer.

“Will we meet again?” She shouted again, feeling her face turning hot and fearing that she was being too obvious with her intention.

“If it is meant to be.” Li Qiye responded and disappeared.

She stared in his direction in a daze, thinking that she wouldn’t be able to meet him again. After all, they were mere strangers and Li Qiye had done enough for her.

She sighed with disappointment before packing up her belongings to return to Alchemy Dao.

Li Qiye entered a dimensional pathway and appeared outside Imperial Attendant with the next step.

From a distance, this was a magnificent city with a vast imperial aura. It resembled an entity that has not fallen for millions of years now.

This was not a sect yet was superior to one. Supreme existences have resided here and given it their blessing.

The list was long - Heavenly Sage Yuan, Ox-dragon Ancestor, Space Dragon Emperor, and many more…

During its golden age, it served as the center of the world. Even Divine Alliance paled in comparison.

It had an auspicious air with countless visual phenomena looming above - signs of how hard it would be to take down.

As for Li Qiye, he focused on something else entirely - an indiscernible death energy hidden beneath everything.

A frightening existence had died here yet their death energy still remained. If left unchecked, it could turn this place into a forbidden zone with no living beings.

Strangely enough, it has been controlled and actually turned into a foundation for Imperial Attendant.

This method was simply unfathomable and unknown to the rest of the world. Even newer emperors and conquerors didn’t notice this unique phenomenon.

“Wonderful, looks like the old geezer died a clean death.” Li Qiye reflected with a smile before entering the city.

His visit prompted an inconspicuous old man sitting in a corner to open his eyes. Given his tattered robe, everyone would think that he was a beggar. His shriveled and thin frame didn’t help either.

He leaned on a broken wall - one in a terrible state just like him. However, he seemed to be enjoying himself, just basking in the sunlight.

Although he appeared to be barely clinging to life as if he hadn’t eaten anything in three days and three nights, he nearly groaned with pleasure from just basking in the sun. This alone satiated all of his needs.

Thus, he became uncomfortable when someone drew close enough to block the sunlight.

“A good dog does not block the road.” He saw the culprit and commented.

This was none other than Li Qiye who didn’t take offense at the comment. He smiled and sat down next to the old man, leaning on the broken wall as well.

This was a remote region of the city but some passersby still took a look at Li Qiye. It seemed strange because he didn’t look like a beggar. Why was he here with the old man?

“What does death feel like?” Li Qiye was extremely comfortable in this corner as if he was cut off from all the troubles of the world, just laying in the dirt like a worm.

“Feels pretty good, pretty good.” The old man responded. He paused for a second and added: “You should give it a try.”

“Humans and all living beings will die, so I will experience it eventually.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re no human.” The old man said.

“I can say the same about you, still won’t die completely.” Li Qiye retorted.

“You know that there was no glory in your victory.” The old man spoke with a matter-of-fact tone: “If it wasn’t for that bang, you would be the one dead.”

“No, I would have slain you for certain in a one-on-one fight.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“I wouldn’t have given you that opportunity.” The old man said lazily.

“Why didn’t he kill you all?” Li Qiye spoke as if he was talking to an old friend.

The old man revealed a sullen smile: “I didn’t think about this issue since I was too hungry and only wanted to eat. Now, the dead have time to think clearly.”

“What did you come up with?” Li Qiye asked.

“He was most likely waiting for you, that was the entry ticket.” The old man said.

“I wouldn’t have needed it if you all weren’t so ravenous.” Li Qiye said.

“He’s one step ahead and is waiting for you. Of course, to us, being killed by you or him is still the same thing.” The old man said.

“No, it’s better to be killed by him, my dull knife prolongs the agony.” Li Qiye said.

“Not like you had a good time. Your flesh was pretty delicious. I enjoyed it very much.” The old man smiled.

“Want some more?” Li Qiye asked.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I am as dead as can be, even the meat of the villainous heaven can’t please me now. I won’t be able to feel a thing.” The old man shook his head.
