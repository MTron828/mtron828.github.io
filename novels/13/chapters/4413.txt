Chapter 4414: Oppose

One of the two parties decided to oppose the rather favorable marriage alliance.

The crowd stared at her in confusion, especially the various ancestors. Even noble girls would need to make sacrifices for the sake of their sect.

This particular engagement was full of pros and not a single con. In reality, the sect would make the decision here; her opinion was meaningless.

The future of the sect was far more important than the girl’s happiness and consent.

Moreover, an ancient ancestor and Peacock Monarch have publicly agreed. Even if Qingzhu were to oppose, she should have protested in private. To do otherwise meant putting the sect in a tough position.

“Ahem, we’ll talk about this later.” Peacock Monarch cleared his throat.

The ex-sect master smiled and added: “Young one, you can decide later. My son will certainly prove his dao and become a dao lord, he’ll help you embark on the path of immortality.”

This wasn’t a small promise. Five-sun King being a dao lord could certainly prolong Qingzhu’s life and help her on the next path.

Pursuing immortality was one of the core goals for cultivation. This included the weak and the strong.

It seemed that the ex-sect master was very serious about the engagement and valued Qingzhu greatly. Though she wouldn’t be the queen, the promise was still indicative of her status.

“Five-sun King is a unique being nowaday, completely peerless. Marrying such a man means living a life with no regrets. Moreover, he might become a dao lord too, being his wife is an honor, let alone the immortality thing.” A young female cultivator murmured.

“Right? I would love to be his concubine, I don’t even care about becoming immortal.” A female fan added.

“Thank you for considering me, Senior, but I am just a nobody, not a good match for the king. Please take back the request.” Qingzhu cupped her fist.

She spoke calmly yet firmly. This made it difficult for the ex-sect master and Peacock Monarch as well.

“Who the hell does she want to marry then? Hmph, let me marry him instead, does she think she’s a fairy or something?” A saintess from a different sect complained.

A female noble from a clan said: “I would agree right away, this saintess is not making sense.”

“Maybe she has someone she likes already.” One expert speculated.

“Who, that Li Qiye?” Members of Dragon started gossiping.

“That sorcerous fella? Hmph, doesn’t matter, he still can’t compare to a future dao lord. A fool knows the right choice.” A female disciple said.

“My son can become a dao lord, Virtuous Niece. It is a joyous event if you two can get together.” The ex-sect master repeated with a firmer voice.

“It is decided.” Ancient Treant spoke as well. Though his voice wasn’t loud, he had enough authority to deter anyone from speaking up.

All eyes were on Jian Qingzhu. Resistance seemed futile now.

“Ancient Ancestor, thank you for caring but our clan does not need your help on this issue.” An impressive voice came from a distance.

The crowd became tense and stared in that direction. They saw none other than Goldbird Monarch, the leader of the Jian.

“Is Dragon about to split?” This became the main question.

“No, the three branches have always been together.” An expert with a good understanding of Dragon said.

“Brother Goldbird, focus on the grand scheme of things.” Peacock Monarch’s expression darkened: “The youths might be naive but you’re a demon monarch.”

“Goldbird, it has been decided.” Ancient Treant narrowed his eyes and intimidated everyone.

The pressure caused Goldbird to stagger one step back.

“Demon Monarch, Five-sun King is a peerless genius. When this engagement goes through, your name will go down in history because you’ll be a dao lord’s father-in-law. How wonderful.” An old man tried to persuade Goldbird.

Ancestors from the east nodded approvingly after hearing this.

“Featherhat Paragon.” Someone recognized him: “One of the eight paragons, very influential.”

“Let us know why you’re against it. I, Treasure, Myriad Sword, and many others will help solve your issues.” The paragon continued.

“Yes, tell us why you object to this wonderful marriage.” Treasure Ancestor said.

The ancestors from the east began persuading Goldbird as well. It seemed that the upper echelons of Dragon and the east wanted this alliance to happen. Failure was unacceptable. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The crowd believed that Goldbird would cave to the immense pressure. Most wouldn’t be able to handel it.
