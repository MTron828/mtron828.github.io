Chapter 4014: Gathering Of Enemies

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom being provoked in public was a monumental event. That’s why everyone paused and stared at Li Qiye.

The poor guy had offended Sea Emperor instead of just its members. The latter case was fine since it could be interpreted as youthful competition. It didn’t warrant the actual sect’s involvement; the seniors there wouldn’t care enough to participate either.

After all, cultivation was a path filled with grudges and dangers. Death was a common outcome.

Not all sects wished to overly shelter their young disciples. However, their reputation and authority being challenged was a different matter. This could end with a fight until the very last man.

In this case, his opponent was Sea Emperor and worst of all, Sword Continent was their home turf. A good outcome would be him dying alone. The worst consequence would be dragging his sect and clan down with him.

Xu Yiyun smiled wryly after hearing Li Qiye. Few dared to oppose Sea Emperor in this manner. Chen Cangsheng was slack-jawed as well. He wanted to stop Li Qiye but it was already too late.

He has been around long enough to understand how serious this was. Unfortunately, the words have left Li Qiye’s mouth. There was no take back now.

He didn’t expect Li Qiye to be so fierce. He thought that the guy was special back during their first meeting but this still caught him by surprise.

“The brat is actually challenging Sea Emperor Sword King, he’s insane.” An older expert shook his head.

“He’s ignorant of its true power. He’ll be crying and regretting soon enough.” A youth stared at Li Qiye with disdain.

“Where is he going to stay in Sword Continent now?” Another snorted.

The spectators didn’t think highly of Li Qiye. They thought that his future was going to be grim.

“Haha, your audacity is actually impressive.” Starshooter Prince laughed in response: “Fine, I’ll play along with your suicidal tendency. How do you want to die?”

“Stand aside, I don’t want others to think that I’m a bully.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively as if he was swatting a fly.

This infuriated the prince who was already annoyed at Li Qiye’s arrogant attitude thus far.

As a genius of the young generation, he was qualified to be arrogant. Whether he was or otherwise was a separate issue.

Moreover, being a member of Sea Emperor meant that he was superior to everyone else. One shouldn’t forget his noble bloodline either.

Just his title and status alone demanded respect. Even the seniors needed to treat him with respect.

“Brat, I’ll teach you a lesson by sending you to the afterlife.” The prince became murderous, unable to accept being looked down upon by a junior.

Li Qiye scoffed and ignored the youth. Meanwhile, some crowd members could see the prince’s fury.

“He’s dead.” A young one commented.

The atmosphere became tense enough that a fight could break out at any moment.

“Stop, his life is mine.” Someone suddenly interjected.

Everyone looked over and saw a green-dress woman approach with an old man behind her.

“Calm Bamboo Princess?” They recognized her and whispered.

“Your Highness.” The members of Sword Sea bowed towards her right away.

“Your Highness.” Even the proud Starshooter Prince did the same.

These two had an even background. The only thing elevating her status above his was her engagement to Peace Ocean Sword King. Thus, she would be representing the main branch in the future. The prince had no choice but to assume inferiority.

She nodded her head before focusing on Li Qiye.

“Looks like quite a few people want my life. Time to team up then?” Li Qiye smiled at the princess.

“Don’t you know that insulting Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom is punishable by death?” She glared at him.

“Don’t you know that insulting me is punishable by nine-clan exterminations?” Li Qiye retorted. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The crowd erupted in laughter after hearing him.

“Does he think he’s a big shot or something? He must still be drowsy! There should be a limit to bragging.” A youth commented.

“He’s probably arrogant enough to think that it’s the truth.” Another female cultivator sneered.

Lu Qi didn’t share the same thought. Her lord could absolutely say something like this and they wouldn’t dare to utter a single word back.

Li Qiye was actually one step higher - a supreme overlord exceeding all imaginations. Lu Qi thought that Li Qiye’s comment was absolutely correct.

Insulting such a being would result in total annihilation. That’s just common sense.

Xu Yiyun pondered as well. A while ago, she would agree with the crowd but now, she thought about his background.

That line was apt when it came to cultivators similar to the five overlords. However, he wasn’t one of the five and she couldn’t come up with another identity.

Chen Cangsheng was left speechless by Li Qiye’s audacity. This guy dared to talk to the future queen of Sea Emperor in this manner?

The guy’s eccentric style wasn’t an explanation for his haughtiness. Attributing it to insanity didn’t seem right either. Cangsheng simply didn’t get Li Qiye.

“I hope your ability is enough to warrant your confidence, and that it’s not just all empty-talk.” The princess became curious as she stared at Li Qiye.

“RIght now?” Li Qiye stretched lazily and said: “Fine, I don’t have anything to do anyway. I’ll play with you for a bit, a little exercise can’t hurt.”
