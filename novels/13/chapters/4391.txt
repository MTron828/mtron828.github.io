Jian Qingzhu showed zero emotion before the unceasing criticisms. She said: “I’m aware of your kind intent. I shall be responsible for my conduct and will answer when necessary.”

Despite her civility, she clearly had no intention of changing her mind. The crowd didn’t know what to do. Some thought that she had lost her mind and wouldn’t repent.

“She doesn’t appreciate what she has and prefers to be a maid, how disgraceful.” One disciple sneered.

“What a shame, how a genius has fallen.” A neutral member regretted this development.

In reality, Jian Qingzhu was previously well-loved by the members of Dragon. Thus, some found this rather regrettable.

“What is his charm? Does anyone see any?” A senior sister asked after taking a good look at Li Qiye.

The girls thought that Jian Qingzhu had everything already, being the golden daughter of the Jian and the saintess of Dragon. She was also gifted in terms of cultivation a well. Alas, she was throwing all of this away for a man.

Most importantly, there was nothing special about him. His appearance was average; he had no aura and power. He didn’t come from a prestigious clan either… All in all, nothing about him was worth mentioning.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that any random disciple from Dragon would be superior to him, hence the illogicalness of her choice.

“It’s like she’s under a spell, there is no other explanation.” A younger girl murmured.

“Hmph, I have to educate you in the sect’s stead then.” Celestial Tiger scowled thunderously. His eyes could pierce the soul.

“I will try my best to contend against your top arts.” She calmly responded - a stark contrast to his aggressive demeanor.

His eyes became serious. Though he talked about educating her, he didn’t take her lightly at all. He has always considered her a rival, one far stronger than Crystal Dragon Young Lord. He had never given a damn about this guy before.

If it wasn’t for his father, the young lord wouldn’t be qualified to compete with him. This wasn’t the case for Jian Qingzhu. He knew that she was quite capable despite her lack of fame.

“I will try my best as well, Junior Sister. I have heard of your brilliant Spirit Feather Saber Art and can’t wait to see it.” He roared.

“You’re too kind, you have learned the Tyrannical Dragon Spear that is extremely hard to stop. You will surely surpass the previous generations, my saber art is not worth mentioning.” She entered a battle state despite not unsheathing her saber.

He summoned a silver spear with a dazzling glow. The tip was white and resembled a sharp bone ready to pierce the heart.

“Tyrannical Dragon Spear, Senior Brother created it himself.” One disciple commented.

“Right, he found a dao bone of a king-level beast in a dangerous location.” A senior brother from Tiger Pond nodded.

“That’s not all, he learned a special dao there to match the spear, it has twelve variations.” Another youth chimed in.

“How brilliant, creating his weapon and learning his own art.” The crowd was impressed while looking at the soul-devouring spear.

“Ready your weapon.” He told his opponent.

“Clank!” She didn’t dare to underestimate the enemy and revealed her saber. It had blue feathers attached to the hilt while the blade also glowed brilliantly. It seemed sharp enough to cut down the moon without a problem.

“What is this saber?” The crowd hasn’t seen her weapon before.

Celestial Tiger’s spear had an impressive origin. If her saber was inferior, she would lose for sure. Even those from Phoenix Ground haven’t seen it previously.

“Its name is Phoenix Feather.” Holding the blade emboldened her.

“I don’t believe I’ve heard of it before among the weapons of Phoenix Ground.” He stared at the saber and said.

“It is there now.” She didn’t explain.

“So this is what you obtained after visiting the palace, Junior Sister?” His expression suddenly changed.

“?!!!” Both members of Dragon and outsiders became emotional.

“Is he right? A saber from Demon Realm Palace?” One disciple blurted out.

The palace was a place filled with fortunes. Alas, few were qualified to enter and even fewer could get fortunes from it.

In history, geniuses normally comprehended the dao in there. Only a negligible number of cultivators obtained actual rewards. In recent generations, Nine-tailed God was one of them.

If Celestial Tiger was right, then it would be quite a shocking revelation.

“You think too highly of me, Senior Brother.” She shook her head: “I’ve only found the dao bone of a blue luan. It was used to craft this saber and was finished recently.”

The crowd exchanged glances; some even took a deep breath.

“A dao bone of a blue luan, how lucky.” One person became emotional.

Being rewarded by the palace was a huge deal. Those geniuses normally had boundless potential.

“This might be why she was given the saintess position.” An outsider speculated.

Among the three, the young lord was an exception since he had the backing of his father. Jian Qingzhu and Celestial Tiger were considered equals as well.

However, she was given the saintess position by the ancestors while Celestial Tiger didn’t have the saint position.

Now, it seemed that the ancestors had thought very highly of her after being aware of her fortune inside the palace.

“Incredible. This saber must be amazing.” Celestial Tiger showed no sign of fear or jealousy.

He knew that she has benefited from the trip to the palace. Alas, the ancestors didn’t make this public. He assumed that she made progress with the dao there, not actually obtained a treasure.
