Chapter 455: Sweet Shopping

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The more he thought about it, the uglier his face became. He just lied in the room, suppressing his anger!

After a long time, the door was pushed open.

Jasmine had come back from the hospital and was surprised to hear the maid say that Eden was back.

Eden was a workaholic, so it was common for him to work overtime, and he had never come back early.

Did he… miss her?

For so long, Eden had been treating her more and more coldly.

Was it because he had also noticed something, so he wanted to treat her better?

She was full of smiles, and with the shyness of a young girl, she pushed open the door.

Back then, Eden always used to say that he liked her pure and lovely appearance, and it had been a long time since she heard Eden say anything romantic.

To be precise, Eden had been so busy recently that he had not talked to her much.

When she walked in, she saw Eden lying on the bed, looking a little tired.

She leaned over with a gentle smile. “Eden, why are you back so early today?”

Eden’s eyes moved a little.

......

He did not even look at Jasmine as he said, “Get lost!”

Jasmine was stunned, and the smile on his face instantly froze.

For a moment, she thought she had heard wrong.

However, in the next second, she put on a sweet smile again as if she did not hear him. “What’s wrong? Did something bad happen at work?”

She tried to get closer to Eden again as she sat beside Eden and took the initiative to hold Eden’s hand, trying to act coquettishly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When she was dating Eden back then, Eden had never been able to reject her soft whining and pouting. Once she acted coquettishly to him, he would hug her, kiss her, and even sleep with her…

“I don’t want to see you! Don’t you understand?” Eden’s expression was extremely ugly. He pulled a long face, and his attitude toward Jasmine was horrible. “I told you to get lost!”

After that, he flung Jasmine’s hand away and looked at her with disgust.

Jasmine looked at Eden in a daze. Her eyes were wide open, and they turned red immediately, with tears welling in them.

She looked extremely aggrieved.

“Eden, did I do something wrong to offend you? What’s wrong with you?” As she said that, tears streamed down her face.

“What else can you do besides crying? Jasmine, you’re really disgusting!”

“Eden, what do you mean?” Jasmine could not take how Eden talked to her anymore.

Since they got married, besides the first half a month, they have been married for almost three months now. However, his attitude toward her was getting worse and worse, and he was becoming increasingly colder toward her!

What did she do wrong?

She was at home taking care of his daily life and her mother-in-law. What else did he want her to do?

What was wrong with her?

Could a man change so much before and after the marriage?

She looked at Eden with tears in her eyes.

Eden was unmoved by Jasmine’s questioning. In fact, he was even more annoyed by Jasmine’s pitiful look.

Especially at that moment, when he thought of Jeanne’s aggressive aura and her calm, collected appearance at the senior management meeting today, he really felt that the Jasmine in front of him was nothing compared to Jeanne!

Was he blind back then to be bewitched by that woman?

To think he even married the woman!

How could that woman be worthy of him?

She was a daughter of a mistress, and as a woman who could not help him at all in the business world, how could she take the position of the Swans’ eldest young mistress?

He could not believe that he wasted seven years of his youth on that woman.

However, he had to admit that there was a time when he was indeed fawned on by Jasmine.

Jasmine was completely different from Jeanne. Jasmine knew very well how to make men happy and how to use her femininity to make men feel superior. She allowed him to fully experience the thrill of conquering her body, unlike Jeanne, who always saw everyone as inferior to her and he had to give in to her at all times.

Yet now, seeing Jasmine trying to attend to him and flatter him, he only felt bored and annoyed.

He said coldly and mercilessly to Jasmine, “Compared to Jeanne, you’re useless!”

Jasmine’s face instantly sank.

It was fine for Eden to throw a tantrum at her or vent his unhappiness on her.

However, she could not stand Eden comparing her to Jeanne.

Especially with Jeanne’s current development, Jeanne had indeed reduced Jasmine to nothing. Not only was Jeanne shining brightly in her career, but she was also superior to her in marriage.
