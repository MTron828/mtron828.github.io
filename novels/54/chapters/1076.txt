1077 Going To Court: All The Crimes Have Been Proven

In the courtroom, the sound of intense fighting suddenly broke out.

Everyone’s eyes shifted to the door, where they saw Nox hitting Michael crazily.

Michael seemed to want to fight back, but under Nox’s fierce attack, he had no power to resist.

In the end, he was beaten up by Nox on the ground until his face was bruised and swollen beyond recognition.

At that moment, the stir caused the bailiffs to quickly go over and separate them.

The moment Nox was separated, he kicked Michael even hard.

Michael had probably never been beaten like that in his entire life. He looked at Nox with a ferocious face and watched as Nox was dragged out by the bailiffs.

Nox did not resist anymore. Instead, he shouted at Monica, who was in the courtroom, “I’ll leave the rest to you, Monica!”

Monica was still surprised as she did not expect Nox to fight with Michael.

No matter what, that was the courtroom, and Nox would not fight in court. Yet, he fought Michael for her.

In fact, she was also certain that Nox would beat Michael for her regardless of where or what occasion it was.

Monica’s eyes were a little red. Some feelings would still move her, but she quietly swallowed her tears and said, “Alright.”

Next, she would end Michael’s life completely!

Nox was taken away by the bailiffs, whereas Michael was brought to court by the bailiff because he was involved in the case.

Monica just stared at Michael, who no longer had any of his former glory and was even in an extremely sorry state.

Michael had not expected that he would encounter such a huge thing when came to the scene today. If he had known earlier, he would not have come.

He looked at Brie and Monica coldly, probably even with the thought of killing them.

No. Not only did he think of killing them, but he had already made a move on them. He should want to tear them into pieces now!

In the courtroom, under the authority of the judge, the order of the court was restored.

With that, the trial continued. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After listening to Michael and Brie’s recorded conversation, everyone got riled up at Michael. They had no idea that Michael was such a cruel man. Even when his extramarital affair was exposed in public, it only ruined his reputation and image, but not to the point where everyone hated him.

However, Michael, after experiencing so much, could still regain his composure.

In fact, when Michael was beaten up by Nox, he was also wondering about whether he should be knocked unconscious by Nox. If he was really knocked unconscious, at least he would not have to go to court. If he did not go to court and plead guilty, the judge would not try him!

Yet, on second thought, even if he pretended to be unconscious and escaped today’s trial, he would not be able to escape the next one. Having been exposed like that, the Sanders would definitely give up on him completely. Maybe... he would be secretly dealt with by the Sanders before he could be tried.

The only thing he could do now was to save himself, and that was why he turned up in the courtroom.

He looked at everyone shamelessly.

Suddenly, he said calmly, “Since when can crimes in Harken be determined by a recording?! The recording can be forged. There are many talents in Harken who can imitate my voice. Now that Brie has found a recording and said that I was the mastermind behind everything, does that mean I can also record a recording and say that Brie is framing me!”

His words were righteous as he was trying to find an excuse for himself.

It was to prevent the court from using the recording as evidence to sentence him.

Upon hearing Michael’s words, Brie became agitated. She said fiercely to Michael, “It was clearly our conversation, the one where you told me to take the blame. How can you say that I made it up? Michael, you’re despicable!”

“Brie! Don’t you think that there’s already a huge problem with your logic?” Michael questioned Brie, his tone heavy.

“I have no problem with that. Everything I said and gave is true. It’s all the truth!”
