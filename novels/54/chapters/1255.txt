1256 Standing Up For Shelly

At that moment, she did not let go of Nox. Instead, she supported his body and placed him in the wheelchair.

After she put him down, her entire face was scrunched up. She was not good-looking, to begin with, and now, she was even uglier.

Nox looked annoyed and could not help but pull open Shelly’s clothes.

It was obvious that he had touched the part where Shelly seemed to be injured. Moreover, it must be very painful, or Shelly would not have cried out. That woman was actually very tolerant, even at all times.

When Nox rudely pulled open Shelly’s clothes, he saw a large, hideous-looking bruise on her shoulder.

“What happened?” Nox asked coldly.

Shelly did not want to answer.

“What happened?” Nox raised his voice.

“I accidentally fell.”

“How stupid would you be to fall like this?” Nox said sarcastically, clearly not believing her.

Still, Shelly said nothing.

“Are you not going to say it?” Nox raised her brows.

“What can you do even if you know?” Shelly retorted.

Nox was startled.

“So, it doesn’t matter if I tell you or not.” Shelly pushed Nox’s hand away and tidied her clothes.

Nox’s expression darkened.

“Do you need me to push you out?” Shelly asked.

“Get lost!” Nox was furious.

With that, Shelly did not hesitate to leave. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Nox felt that if he could stand up, Shelly would have died ten thousand times! Was that woman trying to please him or was she here to piss him off?

He did not know why he was so angry at Shelly’s cold attitude toward him.

That woman was getting more and more scheming.

She must know that he had seen too many women who took the initiative to curry favor with him and that she had no advantage over those women. After all, she was not good-looking, and that was why she chose to use that method to attract his attention.

In that case, she could dream on!

While thinking about that, Nox got so angry, but he also kept comforting himself.

Suddenly, the phone rang. Nox took a look at the incoming call and calmed himself down. He really felt that he was lowering himself by getting angry at Shelly.

He picked up the call and answered, “Mom.”

“Is Shelly back?”

“She came back long ago,” Nox said bluntly.

“How is she?” Mrs. Winter asked.

“What about her? Isn’t she the same?”

“Can’t you care about Shelly a little more?”

“Why should I care about her?” Nox rolled her eyes.

Nox’s attitude infuriated Mrs. Winter. However, she suppressed her anger and said, “I was called into Shelly’s school today.”

“What?” Nox frowned.

He did not think Shelly was capable of that. He had always thought that she was typically a good student who only knew how to study, so he could not believe it when his mother said she was called into her school today.

“She was sitting at the same table as a boy and got into a fight with him.” Mrs. Winter said, “Shelly doesn’t usually do that kind of thing. Why did she act out of character today? Did something happen? When I was at the teacher’s office, Shelly and that guy didn’t tell me why they fought. Now that I think about it, I’m still a little worried.”

“What are you worried about? She’s fine!” Nox did not care.

The second he said that, he suddenly thought of the red and swollen patch on Shelly’s shoulder.

It turned out she was beaten up by another man!

‘Damn it.’

Nox was suddenly in a bad mood. The thought of Shelly being beaten up by another man gave him the urge to kill someone.

At that moment, he could not help but think that Shelly’s attitude toward him was so bad today because she was beaten up!

“Nox, are you listening to me?” Nox’s mother had said a lot, but she did not hear Nox’s reply, and it made her a little angry.

“I heard you, I heard you. I avenge Shelly for you.”

“What are you trying to do now–”

However, Nox had already hung up and dialed a number.

The person on the other end was extremely respectful. “Young Master Winter.”

“Yes, check which guy Shelly fought with in school today for me. If you find him, bring him out for me. I want to see him alone.”

“Yes,” the person on the other end replied respectfully.

Nox put down his phone.

He was not trying to help Shelly. However, no matter what, Shelly was a member of the Winters. Although she could not be his wife, she was still the face of the Winters, and no one could bully her!
