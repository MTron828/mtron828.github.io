Chapter 436: The Swan Enterprise’s Senior Management Meeting, Confronting Eden Swan

That’s right.

George rarely smiled or laughed.

But at that moment, he smiled cunningly.

When he smiled, he looked just like a child his age.

It turned out that the little brat could also laugh like that.

The corners of Edward’s mouth curled up. “It’s a deal.”

George was stunned.

He did not expect Fourth Master Swan to agree so readily. He had a thought that Edward would be angry.

Whatever. George felt that his revenge was enough.

He jumped down from the sofa and stood up. “I’m going to call my mother down for dinner.”

George was still in a good mood. He felt that he had won a match.

He ran upstairs.

Jeanne had not showered. She only changed into a more comfortable set of clothes. She watched the door as George knocked on it.

......

She had thought it was Edward.

When she saw her son, she asked, “What made you so happy?”

“It’s just that...” George said, “I bullied Fourth Master Swan.”

Jeanne smiled.

‘How could you bully him? You used to be afraid that one day, he would eat you till there’s nothing left of your bones.’

“Right, here’s the things you wanted.” George handed a USB to Jeanne.

Jeanne took it.

She patted George on the head. With George around, it saved her a lot of trouble. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“By the way, it’s time for dinner,” George reminded.

“Alright.” Jeanne nodded.

George turned around and was about to head downstairs.

“George.” Jeanne suddenly called out to him.

He turned around.

“Do you want to get a haircut?”Jeanne asked.

George touched his curly hair. “Does it not look good?”

Jeanne smiled and shook her head. “I just felt that you’ve worn this style for so long now that I wanted to give you a new hairstyle.”

“Oh.” George said. He wasn’t bothered with trivial matters.

“Let’s go downstairs and have dinner.”

George nodded.

The two of them walked toward the living room.

It was just the right time as Teddy motioned them over for dinner.

The three of them sat at the dining table and ate very quietly.

Jeanne suddenly asked Edward, “Is the Old Master’s birthday dinner tomorrow?”

“Yes, it is.” Edward nodded.

“I haven’t prepared a gift yet.”

“Don’t worry about it,” Edward said.

‘Even if you don’t worry, I still do!’ Jeanne thought.

“What does your father like?” Jeanne asked.

“Nothing in particular.”

Jeanne was speechless.

That’s no different than not answering.

After dinner, Jeanne helped George up from the dining table. She saw Edward had started to clean up the dishes on the table.

Jeanne was surprised.

Edward said, “I am more than happy to help my wife and son wash the dishes.”

‘...Did he have a stroke?’ Jeanne mused.

George pouted. He did not like Edward’s cheerful look.

Edward should have looked unwilling like George back then.

Of course, Jeanne did not put so much effort into Edward.

If Edward wanted to wash up, he had to do it on his own.

Jeanne turned around and walked toward the living room.

George did not leave. He stood at the side which made it seem like he was supervising.

Edward was not very good at housework, so he was terrible at washing the dishes.

“There’s dish soap on the side,” George commanded.

Edward did as he said.

“There’s water stains on the floor,” George continued.

Edward did as he was told.

Teddy stood by the side and watched with his mouth agape.

When did Fourth Master Swan become so obedient?

Moreover, it’s words from a little boy.

After washing the dishes, George said, “It’s time to mop the floor.”

“I’ll do it,” Teddy said quickly.

“No need. I’ll do it,” Edward said bluntly. “As a man, I should share the housework with my family.”

Teddy was speechless.

Did Fourth Master hit his head on the door?

When Jeanne looked at the scene, she could not help but smile.

Edward sure was unpredictable.

The villa was huge, so Edward mopped the floor for a very long time.

Jeanne felt a little sleepy.

She saw that Edward was still mopping the floor. She said to him with a yawn, “I’ll go back to my room first.”

“Alright,” Edward said.?“You should get an early rest. Don’t wait for me tonight.”

‘Who’s planning to wait for you?’ Jeanne thought.

She headed straight upstairs as Edward continued his mopping journey. George continued to supervise Edward.

Jeanne turned and took a look seeing Edward and George. She felt a pang in her heart.

Jeanne returned to her room. After taking a shower, she lay on the bed.

The villa was huge. Edward would probably have to continue mopping past midnight.

She had a guess on Edward’s unexpected behavior.

It was probably one of George’s “condition”.

She continued lying in bed though she couldn’t fall asleep.
