Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly looked straight at Benjamin, trying to find the words to respond to what he had said.

How was that possible? How could they agree just like that? She knew how much his parents hated her, and she had never thought that she would get the approval of Benjamin’s parents.

“How did they agree?” Shelly asked, still in disbelief.

“I threatened them.” Benjamin said, “I told them I won’t marry anyone but you.”

“Were they so easy to fool?” Shelly scrutinized Benjamin.

“My parents will come to South Hampton City in two days. When you meet them, you’ll know that I’m not lying,” Benjamin said bluntly.

Shelly pursed her lips and said, “Ben, I think we should calm down first. We’ve been separated for a year.”

“I love you.” Benjamin held Shelly’s hand. “No matter whether we’ve been apart for a year or ten years, the person I love is you. During the year I was abroad, I worked hard to study and improve myself because I wanted to be more capable and give you a better life when I returned to your side. In fact, I left you to go abroad because I didn’t want my parents to make things difficult for us again. I never thought of breaking up with you.”

Shelly shook her head and could not bring herself to think of that much now. To her, she had truly broken up with Benjamin, no matter what he thought.

She admitted that she had feelings for Benjamin, but when she thought about getting back together with him, she started to back down. She did not know what she was afraid of! Was she afraid of his family’s opposition or something else? Even she could not figure it out herself, and it seemed like she did not want to be with him again.

Seeing that Shelly was rejecting his advances, Benjamin calmed himself down and said, “I’m sorry, Shelly. I must’ve frightened you.”

“No.” Shelly shook her head. “I just haven’t decided whether we should start over.”

“I was too hasty.”

“Give me some time to think about it.” Shelly said, “Don’t arrange for me to meet your parents for the time being. I don’t want to cause too much unnecessary trouble.”

“Alright.” Benjamin nodded.

“Why don’t you head back for now?” Shelly urged him. “I’ll contact you once I’ve thought about it.”

“Shelly.” Benjamin looked at her affectionately. “I really love you, and I’ve loved you ever since high school. I’ll definitely give you and Bella a better life.” Shelly smiled as she was touched by Benjamin’s words.

She said, “I’ll think about it.”

With that, Benjamin left reluctantly. He did not want to force Shelly, even though he still loved her very much.

After Benjamin left, Shelly sighed heavily. She felt that her relationship was a mess now. Before she could figure it out, another person came.

Bella, who was watching television at the side, asked in her young voice, “Mommy, are you going to be with Uncle Ben?”

Shelly looked at Bella. “Do you like Uncle Ben?”

“I do.” Bella nodded. “But I like Daddy more.”

Shelly hesitated.

“Mom, can you give Daddy a chance? Don’t be with Uncle Ben. I really want Dad to be with us.” Bella was rather emotional, probably because she did not want Shelly and Benjamin to be together.

Shelly patted Bella’s little head. “Be good. Let me make the decision myself, okay?”

Bella felt aggrieved. She really liked her father very much. Why could not her mother be with her father?

“Mommy, I will make your favorite French toast, okay?” Shelly changed the topic. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She did not want to dwell on that matter with Bella. Bella’s point of view was very clear, and she found it very difficult to agree with Bella’s request. Moreover, Nox had already started searching for a partner again.

She went to the kitchen to make some French toast. As they had just moved in and did not have much food, they decided to eat something simple. Just as two plates of French toast had been served, the phone rang. It was Nox.

After Shelly settled Bella down, she walked to the balcony and answered the phone. “Nox.”

“Mr. Logan said you won’t accept what I gave you. Is that true?” Nox asked calmly.

It was as if they were two strangers talking about work.

“I don’t think you should give me so much.”

“Take it.” Nox’s voice sounded indifferent. “It’s just a small amount of money to me.”

“But to me, it’S a lot of money.”

“All the more reasons you should take it.”

“I really don’t need it-“
