Chapter 206: Furious, and Another Slap in the Face

“No! I did it with my own ability. If you continue to insult my personality like this, I’ll sue you!” Lunetta was so agitated that her eyes were red.

Josiah stood up. “Your Honor, objection. I object that the plaintiff’s attorney is always trying to stimulate others to achieve his own goals!”

“Objection sustained.” The judge was serious. “Attorney of the plaintiff, please provide evidence. Do not use excessive words to speculate and interrogate.”

“Understood,” Judah said respectfully, “Your Honor, please allow my other witness to appear in court.”

“Permission granted.”

After a while, a middle-aged woman appeared.

When Lunetta looked at the woman, her face turned pale.

Adrian was also stunned at that moment.

The woman walked to the designated spot, and Judah walked toward her. His tone was much calmer. “May I know your name, who you are, and who you are related to?”

“I’m Casey Jenkins, Adrian Zimmer’s legal wife. We’ve been married for 20 years.”

“Do you have children?”

“Yes,” Casey replied. “Our child is 18 years old and has just come of age.”

“Is your child in university now?”

“A freshman.”

“Okay.” After Judah finished asking, he went straight to the point. “Do you know this woman in front of you?”

Casey looked at Lunetta.

Lunetta was obviously avoiding Casey’s gaze.

Casey gritted her teeth and said, “Yes, even if she turns into ashes!”

“How do you know her?”

“She seduced my husband for five whole years. How can I not know her?!”

“Casey, what nonsense are you spouting?!” Adrian was furious at this moment. “What nonsense are you spouting?!”

“I’m not spouting nonsense!” Casey was also very agitated at this moment, “You think I don’t know that you’re fooling around outside? I know! I just didn’t say it for the sake of our child! If I wasn’t afraid of affecting our son’s studies, I would’ve fallen out with you!”

“You, you, you!” Adrian was so angry that he could not even speak. After a long while, he said with extreme agitation, “Don’t listen to other people’s gossip. I didn’t do anything to let you down!”

“You think it’s hearsay?!” Casey sneered. “I wish, but I’m not stupid. We sleep on the same bed. Do you think I can’t feel if you’re thinking of someone else?!”

“I’ve already told you that I’m very busy with work. I’m very busy with work, so how can I have the time to deal with you?!”

“It’s nice to use work as an excuse, huh?!” Casey mocked, “Every night, you come home at 1:00 am or 2:00 am—you come home after sleeping with this woman!”

“Casey, shut up and go home now. This isn’t the place for you to act like a shrew!” Adrian could not take it anymore and shouted at his wife.

“I’m a shrew?! In your opinion, I can’t compare to those vixens outside, can I?”

“I told you that I didn’t do anything to let you down. I’ll explain it to you and prove my innocence after I’m done here!” Adrian’s tone was obviously softer. “Go back now.”

“That’s not necessary,” Casey rejected coldly, “I’ve had enough—I’ve had enough of your betrayal. It’s not just Lunetta. I know that you had many women before her. Now that our son is in university, I don’t need to worry anymore. I want to expose all your scandals!”

“Casey, you’re crazy...”

“Mr. Zimmer, please control your emotions,” Judah interrupted and said fiercely.

At this moment, the judge also warned seriously, “Mr. Zimmer, please calm down!”

Adrian could not calm down at all. At this moment, his veins were bulging, and he was extremely ferocious.

Judah looked at Casey and asked, “Ms. Jenkins, do you have any evidence to prove that your husband has been cheating on you?”

“Yes.”

“What evidence?”

“From the moment I discovered that my husband has been cheating on me, I thought of divorcing him. However, our child was too young, and I didn’t want him to think that his family is incomplete, so I endured it. I thought that Adrian was just fooling around for a moment. After fooling around, he would eventually return to his family. That said, I didn’t expect that he would only make things worse. Especially after he met Lunetta, he no longer bothered about me and our son anymore. I knew very well that I wouldn’t be able to continue living like that. After my son’s situation becomes stable, I’ll divorce him. Nonetheless, ever since we got married, I’ve been a housewife and have no financial resources. Therefore, I have to take away Adrian’s property. I’ve asked my lawyer. As long as I can prove that he has an affair during the marriage and that I’m not at fault, I’ll be able to get more compensation. Hence, all these years, I’ve hired a private detective to help me keep an eye on Adrian and take many photos of him having an affair.”

“Please take them out.”

Casey placed the photos in Judah’s hand.

Judah took a few glances.

It seemed like he could not bear to look at them.

His expression was strange. He could not help but take another look at Adrian and Lunetta.

That made everyone present curious about what the photos were about.

Judah presented the photos to the judges and the trial bench.

He asked, “Your Honor, can these photos be used as evidence that Mr. Zimmer and Ms. Walker colluded?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Yes,” the judge said.

Josiah suddenly said, “It can only mean that they have an improper relationship and have little to do with this case.”

“Lawyer Newton,” Judah said to him, “Please use your professional legal knowledge and a normal people’s logic to rearrange the content of this case.”

Josiah looked a little cold.

Judah was such a significant lawyer, yet he dared to mock him like this.

Judah said, appearing to have a plan in mind, “The cause of the case is that Mr. Zimmer reported that my client profited 30 million dollars on the construction project of the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse. She was accused of having worked with the contractor, Mr. Wadler, through a dual contract. However, after going through the case, we clearly know that the person who drew up the dual contract was Ms. Walker. Ms. Walker has nothing to do with my client, but she has a deep relationship with Mr. Zimmer. This is one thing. The second thing is that the contractor, Mr. Wadler, had always been in business with Mr. Zimmer. However, Mr. Wadler has nothing to do with my client. Lawyer Newton, with your years of experience in public prosecution, what do you think this means?!”

Josiah’s expression was obviously unsightly.

The public prosecution cases that he usually dealt with were all cases where the sentences were already going to be confirmed.

It was the first time he had encountered such a reversal.

Judah did not wait for Josiah’s reply. He said straightforwardly, “This means that this case has nothing to do with my client. The person who has the most to do with it is the whistle-blower, Mr. Zimmer!”

His voice was loud and clear, and he had a strong aura in the court.

“Objection!” Josiah said coldly, “This is only your speculation. There’s no evidence to prove it! Even if Mr. Zimmer is related to these people, it doesn’t mean that he framed Ms. Lawrence. You missed a very important part, Lawyer Smith!”

Judah’s eyes narrowed.

“There’s an additional 30 million dollars in Jeanne’s account. The amount is exactly the same as the witness’ testimony and the data on the account list! Could it be that you think that Mr. Zimmer transferred 30 million dollars to Ms. Lawrence? Lawyer Smith, Mr. Zimmer is a high-ranking leader of a listed company. Even if his annual salary is a few million dollars, he wouldn’t be able to casually take out 30 million dollars to do such a thing. Besides, what could his motive be?!”
