1384 Parent-Teacher Conference: You’re My Son!

Therefore, had Teddy been attending George’s parent-teacher conference?

When Candice returned to her room, Edward was not asleep. As soon as she got on the bed, he held her in his arms.

Candice, on the other hand, felt an inexplicable sense of repulsion. It was not that her body was repulsed by him, but she was a little resentful of him.

She did not know why she would blame Edward for George.

Clearly, the child was Edward’s. Edward had a lot of things to deal with, so it was understandable that he could not take care of George.

However, when she thought about how George had been alone all these years, dealing with his mother’s death, his father’s remarriage, and everything alone… her heart ached.

“What’s wrong?” Edward could sense her emotions.

Even if it was just a little, he seemed to know.

“I think you care too little about George,” Candice said bluntly.

Her expression was quite serious, and it sounded like she was blaming him.

Edward seemed to pause for a few seconds before he said, “George is the next successor, so his responsibilities are different from Paige’s. George knows.”

“So, the more sensible a child is, the less he will receive his parents’ love and care. The less he cries, the less he will get their parents’ attention, right?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Edward was rendered speechless by Candice’s words.

“Isn’t George so sensible because he has experienced too much? Why don’t you feel sorry for him? Why do you think it’s natural?” Candice questioned.

Edward was still speechless. However, after a while, he said, “Because I grew up like this too.”

Candice swallowed the words that she was about to say.

Edward said, “I was like that too when I was young. Because I knew the responsibilities I had, I controlled my temper and got rid of my cowardice so as to make myself less expectant of the feelings around me and slowly made myself stronger and stronger.”

Candice could imagine a younger Edward in the same scene she saw George in just now, and her heart ached for him; her heart ached for both Edward and George.

Born in such a family, they had everything from birth but not the happiness of a normal family.

Candice bit her lip lightly. At that moment, she did not know what else to say. It was Edward’s child, so he should decide what education he wanted for him, and she should not have interfered.

She just felt bad for the child, who had to bear everything since he was young, but in reality, there was nothing she could do to change that.

“Candice.” In the darkness, Edward hugged Candice tightly in his arms.

Candice wanted to hug George tightly because she thought George looked too lonely. The more a child did not want candy, the more her heart ached.

“I’ll leave my children in your care, okay?” Edward suddenly said.

Candice looked at Edward, stunned.

Edward said, “I’m usually too busy, so I can’t really care much about them. In fact, you said that I was cold to George, and I know it myself. However, due to time constraints, most of the time I can spare is given to Paige because she’s still young. As for George, the only time I have left is to assess his growth.”

Candice listened quietly. At that moment, she could tell that Edward was explaining to her apologetically why he treated George like that.

Candice did not know why Edward was apologizing to her, but all she could think about was, “I’ll help you take good care of George and Paige.”

She figured that might be Edward’s biggest motive for remarrying anyway.

Previously, she thought that Edward was only trying to get her father on his side. However, after interacting with him, she felt that Edward did not need anyone’s help. Under his control, Harken was indestructible, even though he had only been in office for two years.

Therefore, his motive for remarrying was probably to have a complete family.

She did not know why she had an illusion that Edward was not as strong as he looked. In fact, she felt that he was very lonely sometimes and that he, too, needed a warm embrace.

The next day, when the sun had just risen, Edward woke up.

Before he left, he could not help but plant a kiss on Candice’s lips because he was reluctant to leave her.

That kiss made Candice open her eyes in a daze. “Edward.”
