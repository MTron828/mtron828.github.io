857 Monica’s Extreme Counterattack, a Struggle Between Life and Death

Gary stared at Monica’s back as she left. He was so angry that he was turning red from holding it in.

“You talk about how Monica… your daughter… You say that she’s…” Gary struggled to get his words out coherently.

Ruby took a deep breath and said, “Let her be. She’s our only daughter.”

“It’s because of you that Monica’s like this. You indulged her too much.”

“Yes, it’s all my fault. It’s my fault as well that I married you.” Hearing her husband’s words, Ruby felt even more aggrieved. “I shouldn’t have married you in the first place.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Why are you saying such things again?”

“Isn’t that what you meant? How I didn’t take good care of this family? I shouldn’t have stayed at home, took care of my husband, and raised my children. I shouldn’t have trapped myself in this house for the rest of my life. I shouldn’t have given up on my interests, hobbies, and ambitions back then. All I had to be was a housewife for you, Gary. Isn’t that right?”

“I didn’t mean it that way.” Seeing how angry his wife was, Gary lowered his voice back down.

“Then what did you mean by that? Come on! Tell me!” Ruby said, agitated and her eyes red.

“Yes. It’s all my fault. I’m sorry. I said the wrong thing.” Chi Cheng instantly softened.

He had been bullied by these two women his entire life.

“Then, who do you think is at fault for Monica’s current state?”

“It’s mine. I was too busy with work and didn’t spend time with her as she was growing up. It’s my fault.” Gary had no choice but to admit his mistake.

“Since it’s all your fault, what right do you have to speak ill of Monica?!” Ruby questioned him.

Gary’s eyes almost popped out. How had all the blame been put on him?!

Women… They really were the most unreasonable animal in the world.

…

Monica booked a room with the young hunks at the agreed location. She had even got someone to take a photo of her in bed. However, this time, she did not send it to George.

With news and entertainment websites shut down and the entire country’s netizens reorganized, there was simply nowhere to post it. She did not want to poison George, either. After all, the scale was getting bigger and bigger.

Once the photos had been taken, Monica sent them directly to Michael.

She did not believe that he would not mind. There was just no way that, as a man, he could remain indifferent after seeing those pictures.

However, Michael did not reply. He even hung up on her without saying a word when she called.

Monica gritted her teeth. Michael would not be able to endure it forever.

So it continued for a week.

She found a new young hunk every day and sent different bed photos to Michael each time. She even threatened Michael that she would continue if he did not give up on marrying her. After the country lifted the internet ban, she would still let people post it on the internet every day. She did not believe that Michael could tolerate it.

While he could tolerate her sleeping with other men, he definitely would not be able to tolerate her smearing his name like this. With their current relationship, her indecent media were a personal attack on Michael.

Monica was really pushing herself to the extreme. Even if it would be a struggle between life and death, she was determined to break up with Michael.

It was a new day, which meant a new young hunk and room. The two of them had pretended for the photos and were now preparing to leave.

The young hunk blocked her at the door. “Were you really not planning on sleeping with me tonight?”

“Get out of my way.”

“I can make you feel like you’re drunk.”

“Get lost,” she said. Monica had no time to pay attention to him.

It had been a week, and Michael remained unmoved.

F*ck. Her patience was running thin.

“Believe me. I’ll make it worth your while.” As he spoke, the young hunk approached her.

Monica’s face was full of disgust. She opened the door and prepared to leave.

Seeing that she was about to go, the young hunk hurriedly picked her up and carried her over.

Monica gritted her teeth.

“I’ll cut you if you don’t let me go!” Monica threatened.

“Don’t you think it’s a pity since you’ve spent so much money?” The hunk did not let go of her.

“You want to get your money’s worth, don’t you?!”

“Let go!” Monica shouted.

The young hunks had never dared offend her before.

It was just that he had a good impression of Monica, and he had served rich women for many years. His skills were first-class, and no rich woman had ever given him money and not slept with him. He felt that his self-esteem had been trampled on, so he could not help but ask her to stay. However, seeing Monica’s firm attitude, he did not dare convince her otherwise.
