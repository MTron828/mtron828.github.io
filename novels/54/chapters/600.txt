“It’s alright.”

“Can you deal with it alone?” Edward asked.

“There’s nothing I can’t do.”

“I’m sorry to have let you down.” Edward was very ashamed of not being able to be there for her.

However, Jeanne did not mind.

Of course, it would be better if Edward could come back. At least with his status, she did not have to hear all the gossip.

Even if he did not come back, she would not feel disappointed. She had never thought of relying on anyone anyway.

She said, “It’s late. You should rest early.”

“You too, Jeannie. Only by having more rest and restoring your energy can you perform better.” Edward reminded her.

‘Perform?’ Jeanne smiled, thinking that what Edward said was reasonable.

Then, she said, “Goodbye.”

“Goodbye.”

Jeanne hung up the phone and was not reluctant to part with Edward this time. Unlike every night before, they would stay on the call until she fell asleep.

They were actually rational people. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

No matter how deep their feelings for each other were, they knew what they should do when they encountered something.

Jeanne did not ask him what he did yesterday, and Edward would not tell her.

Between them, as long as they loved each other, everything else… They did not have to care about it.

Jeanne was relieved.

In the end, she did not click on the video. She was afraid that if she clicked on it, the few hours of sleep she could have tonight would be gone.

She closed her eyes and eventually fell asleep.

When she woke up, it was past 9 a.m. in the morning.

She did not think of going to work today, so she turned off the alarm clock and rolled over.

She had to admit that she felt refreshed when she woke up.

Then, she took her time going to the bathroom to wash up and then slowly changed into a decent black dress.

No matter what, she still had to dress modestly to go to Jonathan’s funeral.

She glanced at herself in front of the mirror a few times to make sure there was nothing inappropriate about her. After that, she walked out of the dressing room, picked up her phone from the bedside, and went downstairs.

As she went downstairs, she looked at the messages on her phone.

Great. She had 36 missed calls, most of which were from Monica.

Did Monica not sleep that night?

She was afraid of being disturbed, so she turned her phone to mute that night.

However, seeing all of Monica’s calls did not make her anxious. It was probably because she knew why Monica called her.

As soon as she called back, the person on the other side of the phone cursed, “F*ck. If you didn’t call me back, I would’ve called the police! Why didn’t you pick up the phone? Are you trying to scare me to death?”

“I was asleep.”

“...”

“I was afraid I would be disturbed, so I muted my phone.”

Monica was speechless. Was Jeanne talking about her?

“Is something up?” Jeanne asked.

“Uh...” Monica paused.

Actually, there was nothing important that she had to call Jeanne so many times.

She really had something to tell her at first, but later on, it was clear that she was over worrying.

“Nothing?” Jeanne asked.

“There is.” Monica came back to her senses. “The matter of you and your father fighting at your grandfather’s funeral is on the news. Now, everyone is accusing you of being too cold-blooded.”

Jeanne had guessed so too. Hence, she replied, “Alright. I got it.”

“How can you be so calm? You don’t even know what they’ve written about it! It makes me so angry!” Monica said angrily.

What was there to be angry about?

The one who should be angry was Alexander.

She said, “Is there anything else?”

“No, but what are your plans today? Are you not going to pay respects to your grandfather?” Monica asked her emotionally.

“Of course, I’m going. I’ll go after breakfast.”

“Aren’t you afraid your father will treat you the same again?”

“I’ve never been afraid.”

Monica liked how powerful Jeanne was. She said excitedly, “In that case, I’ll go with you.”

“Don’t you need to sleep?” Jeanne frowned.

“Of course, I do.”

“You only got back at 4 a.m. last night, and now it’s past 9 a.m. Have you been calling me the entire time? Don’t you need to sleep?”

“It was because I was worried about you!”

“Now that you know I’m fine, you should take a good nap.”

“I can’t sleep either.” Monica felt a little helpless. “It’s been like this for a while. Once I wake up, I can’t go back to sleep. I feel like I’m constantly tired.”

“Do you miss Dr. Jones?”
