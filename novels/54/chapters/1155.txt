1156 Edward, I’m Pregnant

When Jeanne arrived at the hospital, it was already very late at night.

She walked along the quiet corridor of the hospital, with Mason and the Sanders’ numerous bodyguards by her side.

Every time she went out now, she carried the poise of the young lady of the Sanders.

She stopped outside the intensive care unit and looked at Monica, who was originally innocent and carefree. After experiencing so much, let herself lie in the ward, pale and weak.

There was a price for growing up, and there was a huge price to pay.

Now, Monica had grown up. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne’s eyes were a little red, and they turned even redder by the second

She had just learned about Monica’s accident, in which she desperately drove and crashed into Finn’s car, allowing Finn to be lucky enough to escape. As for Monica herself, she was lying in the intensive care unit in Finn’s place, her life hanging by a thread.

She did not know whether Monica loved Finn so much that she would rather die. All she knew was that Monica had repaid Finn everything she owed him.

In the future, any choice that Monica made would have nothing to do with Finn.

She stood outside the intensive care unit for a long time.

She was thinking about the fact that Gary was still lying unconscious in the intensive care unit, and now, Monica was lying unconscious in the intensive care unit.

How was Ruby going to live with it?

However, there was no way she could stay here and accompany Ruby now.

She turned around and faced her personal bodyguards. “You guys stay here and protect Monica.”

The bodyguards were surprised.

“Monica has become a key person of our family and needs to be protected. I’m worried that the Duncans will do something to her. Also, keep an eye on Monica’s mother, Ruby, for me. If anything happens her, keep me informed.” Jeanne ordered coldly.

“Yes.” The bodyguards were extremely respectful.

“Mason, let’s go.” Jeanne turned around.

Mason left with Jeanne.

The bodyguards looked at Monica’s back and hurriedly made a phone call to report. “The Third Young Lady has asked us to protect Monica and stay in the hospital.”

“Do as she says.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne got into the car, and Mason drove directly to the higher-class prison.

Along the way, it was extremely quiet in the car.

Mason looked at Jeanne in the backseat through the rearview mirror and said, “It’s only natural for the Sanders to take the initiative to protect Monica. This way, on one hand, it will eliminate the Sanders’ revenge on Monica, and on the other hand, it will avoid the possibility of the Duncans making a move on Monica! After all, no one knows who will be implicated in such a risky battle! At the very least, her safety is guaranteed.”

That was the only good thing about the incident.

If Monica could wake up, she would no longer be in danger.

Jeanne did not answer.

From her tense expression, it was easy to tell that she was in a bad mood.

Although she had achieved her goal, Monica was still lying in the intensive care unit, with her life hanging by a thread. She had no reason to be happy or even glad!

The car arrived at the destination quickly, and Jeanne got out of the car.

She did not have to go through many procedures, probably because Warren had given instructions in advance.

Hence, she walked into the room where Edward was being held.

When the door opened, Edward was lying on a hard bed, and he turned to look in the direction of the door.

He watched as Jeanne appeared in front of him with Mason.

Edward’s throat moved slightly. Then, he got up from the bed and faced her.

They both did not show any emotion; they just looked at each other coldly.

“I want to discuss a condition with you,” Jeanne said straightforwardly, without showing any emotion.

Edward nodded. “Go on.”

“I’ll release everyone in your family, but you have to help me clarify to the public that the Sanders hasn’t imposed any financial control on you.” Jeanne went straight to the point.

Edward seemed to smile.

That period of imprisonment did not seem to have changed him much. At most, his beard had grown a little longer.

He said, “Our family the Sanders…”

His tone was a little sarcastic.

Nevertheless, Jeanne did not react to his comment. Instead, she asked, “Do you agree?”

“I agree.” Edward did not hesitate.

It was because, to him, it was not a loss.

“Tomorrow morning, I will announce to the public that because there’s no concrete evidence to prove that the Swans have been engaging in illegal economic transactions with other countries, in order to not affect the Swans’ business, we will lift the ban on Swan Enterprise. At the same time, we will release everyone in the Swans, including Nox from prison.” Jeanne said, “But before that, I’ll get the reporters to interview you. You need to give the Sanders a statement to defend their good image.”
