1368 The Wedding Night: From Now On, I Will Sleep In

Therefore, she simply stopped struggling and looked at the man sleeping next to her. At that moment, he was still sound asleep.

She figured that it was getting late, so logically speaking, he should already be at work.

Supposedly, he did not rest for 365 days a year. For the sake of the Harken, he would give his all until he died.

She could not imagine how much a person could sacrifice for a great cause.

She just looked at the man who had been sacrificing himself and looked at his relaxed brows. Somehow, there seemed to be a look of satisfaction on his face.

Was he satisfied with everything that happened last night?

Candice blushed but did not look away.

She was really happy to see such a handsome face the moment she opened her eyes. It was a kind of yearning for beautiful things, but she also could not help herself.

Unconsciously, her fingers moved closer to his cheek.

She was just curious how God could create a person to be so beautiful. Was he not afraid that the world would question his favoritism?

Her fingers gently traced the outline of his face. Then, she caressed his facial features, bit by bit, as if… she had missed him a lot.

She caressed his sharp eyebrows, high nose bridge, and… his perfect lips. Those alluring lips had really given her a lot last night…

That was when she realized that not only a man would be tempted by lust. In fact, women could also be seduced.

Instinctively, she took the initiative to kiss his lips, and after the kiss, she wanted to leave. However, her eyes widened. “Oh.”

At that moment, she saw a certain someone suddenly open his eyes. It was clear that he did not just wake up because his eyes were clear and deep, filled with desire.

She could not be familiar with that gaze. Last night, the whole night…

“Oh.” Candice’s body tensed up. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She knew what Edward wanted to do at that moment. After one night, she had learned all of his moves. Hence, she tried her best to push him away.

Alas, Edward had pinned her down.

“I don’t want to.” Candice refused.

Edward’s eyes were still burning with desire.

“I thought you were unsatisfied, my wife.” His voice was clearly extremely low.

‘My wife?’

After a whole night of sex, he had changed the way he addressed her that morning.

However, Candice had no time to think about that because right now, she had to guard against Edward’s… desires.

She quickly said, “I’m satisfied.”

There was no unsatisfied desire. She just wanted to touch his beautiful features just now, and there was no other… meaning to it.

“My wife, are you reassuring me of my performance last night?” Edward chuckled with a deadly charming grin.

Were all men so confident?

“It seems like you’re not satisfied.” Edward came to a conclusion when he did not get an answer from Candice, and the result of that conclusion was…

“I’m satisfied,” Candice quickly said loudly. “I’m very satisfied.”

Edward smiled again, but this time, he could not control his laughter.

Candice felt like she was being bullied by the man.

“Thank you for your compliment, my wife.” A certain someone’s face was clearly filled with pride. “I will continue to work hard.”

He was the dignified Leader of a country, yet he was actually so indecent.

She really wanted to let the entire country see how flirty their Leader was.

“Are you hungry?” Edward asked.

He was in such a good mood that he hugged her tightly in his arms.

Under the blanket, the two people still had their hands to themselves.

“What time is it?” Candice asked.

Edward reached for his phone and glanced at it. “11 a.m.”

“It’s so late!” Candice was surprised.

Her biological alarm clock was usually at 7 a.m.

“Thank you for your last night, my wife.”

Could he stop talking?

“Are you hungry?” Edward asked again.

“I’m not hungry.”

“Do you want to get up?” Edward continued to ask.

“I don’t want to move.”

“In that case, I’ll lie here with you.”

Just like that, he had no intention of getting up.

“Don’t you have to go to work?” Candice asked.

“From now on, I will sleep in.”

Therefore, was she the femme fatale?
