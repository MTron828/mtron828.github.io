1322 Finn Is Jealous

With that, Nox hung up the phone abruptly.

The bystander was more anxious than the person involved it seemed.

Nox put down his phone.

He was hit with an inexplicable feeling of emptiness. It was in the dead of night that he felt inexplicably lonely.

He sat on his balcony and lit a cigarette and stared blankly into the night view of South Hampton. He did not know where his sudden sense of loss came from.

He had clearly just been intimate with Zoe and satisfied his desire as a man. Why was he suddenly feeling so? Why was he so sad?

Could it be that Finn had influenced him? It made him feel sad.

He just sat there, smoking away intensely.

“Nox.” Zoe seemed to have not seen Nox for a long time, so she got up to look for him.

Seeing him sitting on the balcony, her soft body leaned close to him and hugged his neck. She said in a coquettish voice, “Why aren’t you sleeping? You’re smoking here at night.”

“I just talked to Finn on the phone, so I couldn’t fall asleep. I was afraid that it would affect you.”

“Did something happen between Dr. Jones and Monica?”

“Those two never had it easy.”

“I think they’ll break up sooner or later,” Zoe said bluntly.

Nox looked at her.

“I don’t think Dr. Jones is worthy of Monica,” Zoe explained. “Monica is such a strong woman. There will be many people pursuing her. There will always be an outstanding person who will attract Monica.”

“Monica is not the kind of person you’re talking about.”

“But the two of them are from different worlds.” Zoe was certain. “It’s very difficult for people from two different worlds to get together. Anyway, when I look at Dr. Jones and Monica, I feel that they don’t match at all.”

“You’re only looking at the outside…”

“Alright, why are we arguing over other people’s matters? We have to go to work tomorrow. I want you to sleep with me,” Zoe said coquettishly.

She was very good at acting cute. She took Nox’s cigarette.

Nox frowned. He had not even finished puffing.

He then felt Zoe’s soft lips on his. Nox was not someone who could withstand temptation, so he carried Zoe back to the bed.

However, Zoe’s words suddenly appeared in her mind. It was difficult for people from two different worlds to be together.

Different worlds suddenly reminded him of Shelly. He thought of Shelly, who had left the Winter family for three years.

Back then, when he made a bet with his grandfather for a year, he did not have a woman and did not fall in love with Shelly. He had won, so Shelly left.

She was very tactful and actually left the Winter family.

Thereafter, he had also fallen in love with Zoe. He had not even thought of this woman for a long time.

It was as if… she was someone insignificant.

But for some reason, he suddenly thought of her tonight.

In fact, he did not know if Shelly had contacted his family after she left the Winter family. In any case, he had never contacted Shelly once, nor had he met her when he was with his family, let alone heard them mention her again.

Now that he thought about it, with Shelly’s age, she might still be in university.

Perhaps she would still come back after she finished studying.

After all, Shelly grew up in the Winter family. If she did not come back here, where would she go?!

Of course, he would not mind. Other than Shelly wanting to be his wife, he could accept Shelly being in the family.

“Nox.” Zoe’s charming voice was filled with complaints.

Nox came back to his senses.

He was actually distracted in the heat of their intimacy.

This was inexcusable.

He hugged Zoe.

The room was filled with… boundless rays of spring.

…

Under the night sky, Finn returned to his room.

Monica was still playing with her phone. Seeing him return, she did not show much of a reaction and continued to look at her phone.

He went to the bathroom first. He had just smoked, so he went to wash up.

When he came out, Monica had already turned off the lights on her bedside and fallen asleep.

Finn lifted the blanket and got into bed. He turned off the lamp on his side and approached Monica.

Monica did not move at all.

“Monica…”

“I just realized that I’m on my period,” Monica said.

Finn was stunned.

That was not what he meant. Just as he was about to say more, he felt Monica’s body move a little to the side.

She said, “Sleep early.”

Finn said slowly, “Good night.”

...

The room fell into complete silence.

…

On the same night, Candice did not expect that she would still be in Bamboo Garden even though it was almost midnight.

It was not that she did not want to leave, but only a little reluctant to part with Paige.

It was mainly because Paige had been sticking to her for the entire day, making it difficult for her to just leave like that.

Of course, it was not because of this that she did not leave, or because Paige would not let her go.

Once she mentioned that she wanted to go back, Paige’s little face looked aggrieved. Tears filled her eyes. Paige looked at her with big, teary eyes and asked, “Mom doesn’t want Paige anymore? Is there something Paige didn’t do well?”

As soon as she said that, Candice’s heart would melt. She could not fathom how such a cute child could exist in this world. She loved this child so much.

So in the end, that was as far as she got. She left Paige’s room carefully after she fell asleep.

Outside the door, Edward was waiting for her. He must have waited for her for the entire night. He thought he should have sent her home after dinner.

Candice was actually a little embarrassed. She said, “Sorry to keep you waiting.”

...

Edward shook her head and said, “Paige likes you very much.”

“Mm.” Candice’s lips unconsciously curled into a smile.

That was because she had a maternal aura, even if she did not notice it herself.

“It’s so late. Do you want to stay tonight?” Edward asked.

“No, I’d better go back,” Candice quickly rejected.

Even if she could not bear to part with Paige, she still did not want to continue staying here.

She felt that it would be awkward being under the same roof as Edward.

Edward seemed to smile. “I didn’t do anything to you last night.”

“I know,” Candice quickly agreed. “I’m not talking about what you did to me.”

“Does that mean I can do anything to you?”

Candice looked at Edward speechlessly.

Why did she suddenly feel that this stern and tall Chief in front of her was a little flirtatious…

“Let’s go. I’ll send you off.” Edward reached out and naturally pulled her hand into his palm.

It seemed very natural to have intimate contact with her. Candice felt that they had dated like this before.

She followed Edward and left Bamboo Garden. She sat in Edward’s private car. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s already so late, let the driver drive me home,” Candice suggested.

“It’s because it’s already so late that I don’t trust anyone to send you home.”

Candice pursed her lips.

Edward was really good at flirting.

At first, she felt that he was distant, but now… he was clearly a veteran in love.

The car drove toward the Nicholsons’ residence.

In the car, neither of them spoke much but their hands never parted.

They arrived at their destination and Candice moved her hand. She could not get out of the car because she was being held back.

And he had no intention of letting go even though it was really late now.

However, the moment she tried to break free, the man in front of her suddenly tightened his grip on her small hand.

Candice lost her balance and threw herself into Edward’s arms.

She even kissed him on the lips.

It was obvious that Edward did it on purpose!
