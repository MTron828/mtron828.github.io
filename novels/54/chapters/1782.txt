“Alright, thank you.” Brandon took it and said casually, “Do you want to come in and have a seat?”

“Where’s Sarah?” Shelly could not help but ask.

“She’s still asleep,” Brandon said.

“She’s still asleep at this hour?” Shelly was surprised.

She thought she woke up late, but Sarah was still asleep.

“She’s too tired from last night, so I let her sleep a little longer today, ” Brandon blurted out.

After Brandon said it, Shelly felt so awkward. No matter how innocent an adult was, they would know what “tired” meant. As expected, they were just joking around when they said they had broken up.

Brandon also felt a little… embarrassed after he said it out loud. After all, he was not too familiar with Shelly.

The two of them stood in awkward silence for a few seconds before Shelly quickly said, “Since Sarah is still asleep, I won’t disturb her. Just pass her the phone for me, and I’ll head off now.”

“Alright, thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”

Shelly quickly left, feeling extremely awkward. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Brandon looked at Shelly and could not help but smile. He could not believe that Nox, who was such an unrestrained person, would fall in love with an innocent person like Shelly. It made him see Nox in a different light. Then, he returned to the room with his phone.

In the bedroom, Sarah finally opened her eyes in a daze. For a second, she felt her mind go blank as she stared straight at Brandon, who had suddenly pushed open the door and entered.

Seeing that he was wearing her pajamas, she lowered her head and saw that she was naked under the blanket.

“Ahhh!” Sarah shouted.

Brandon frowned. His eardrums were about to burst from Sarah’s shout.

“Haven’t you shouted enough last night?” Brandon asked softly.

Only then did Sarah remember what happened last night.

‘F*ck!’ she cursed secretly. She could not believe that she had slept with Brandon again while she was drunk!

Why could she not control herself when she was drunk? She had clearly broken up with the man.

“Do you remember now?” Brandon smiled.

“So what if I do? I was drunk last night and couldn’t control myself, but so what? Since we’ve broken up, you should leave my house now,” Sarah urged.

“So you don’t plan on taking responsibility for what you did.”

“Take responsibility, my *ss. You’re a grown man. Why should I take responsibility for you? I repeat, I was drunk last night and didn’t know what I was doing. I made a mistake that men and women easily make. It was meaningless to me.” “But I wasn’t drunk,” Brandon said bluntly.

Sarah was stunned.

“So, I knew what I was doing last night.”

‘What exactly do you want?” Sarah looked at him.

He had an expression that said, ‘If worse comes to worst, we’ll perish together.’

“I just want to tell you that everything I did to you was done under circumstances where I was clear-minded and rational. I wasn’t out of my mind.”

“So what?”

“That includes our first time,” Brandon said bluntly.

Sarah was stunned again.

“It’s impossible for a man to… do that when he’s really drunk.” Brandon said, “That’s why I knew what I was doing to you the first time. Although I grew up abroad, I’m not a casual man. To put it bluntly, the last time was your first time, and so was mine.”

She had never thought that Brandon would still be a virgin at his age! She could tell that he had never slept with her cousin, but she did not expect to learn that he had never slept with anyone.

“Sarah, I’m serious about you.” Brandon became much more affectionate. “I’m cold to you not because I don’t like you, but because I’m really busy. I have at least a hundred documents on my phone that need to be approved.”

Sarah pursed her lips when she realized that was why he accused her of being unreasonable.

“I’m not saying you should forgive me because I’m very busy. I’m just telling you that I didn’t mean to be cold to you. I hope you can forgive me.” Brandon said seriously.

He was also looking with such intense affection that Sarah was certain he had been possessed. She thought Brandon was in love with her cousin, so how could he confess to her so affectionately?

The moment she did not react, Brandon suddenly walked over and sat in front of her. Sarah instinctively wrapped herself tightly in the blanket, trying to protect herself. She found the distance between the two of them was too dangerous.

“Sarah, I don’t know if I liked you because of Monica, but I can be sure now that I’ve let go of Monica and fallen in love with you.” Brandon held the back of Sarah’s head. “So, let’s not break up. Let’s start over, okay?”

Sarah was stunned. His sudden confession had caught her off guard, and she could not resist him! In fact, she could feel her heart beating very fast. She had originally planned on cutting all ties with that fellow and go their separate ways. Yet now, they were on the same bed, and she was even being confessed to.

Sarah pursed her lips unconsciously, which made Brandon’s sexy Adam’s apple move. As he really could not take it anymore, he exerted a little strength in his palm, and Sarah leaned forward. Then, their lips touched and developed into a passionate kiss. It was so hot that she felt as if a ball of fire was burning on her body..
