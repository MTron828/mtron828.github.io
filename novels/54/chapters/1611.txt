Misunderstanding, Shelly Laughing Like a Goose

He should have cut ties with his grandfather a long time ago because that old man could really kill him!

“Oh,” Wade replied, and he did not seem to care.

That reply infuriated Nox. To think that he was so respectful and nice to his grandfather! At the thought of all the torture his grandfather had done to him over the years, he really regretted it.

“Since we have nothing to do with each other anymore, don’t come or show up in front of me again. Get out!” Nox drove him away, refusing to see his grandfather for even a minute.

When he saw his grandfather, all he saw was his grandfather looking at him like he was an idiot. Before his grandfather, he would always be the world’s biggest “idiot”!

“Actually, I’m not here to see you,” Wade said bluntly.

‘Since you’re not here to see me, hurry up and leave. Stop talking nonsense. How old are you to still be two-faced?’ Nox thought.

“I’m here to see Shelly,” Wade said calmly.

Nox was stunned for a second. Then, he suddenly remembered that he did run into Shelly in the hospital last night and almost lost control of himself with that woman.

Speaking of which, was Shelly seriously ill? Was that why she was hospitalized? Could it be some terminal illness?

“Shelly will outlive you!” Wade looked at his grandson and knew what he was thinking.

Nox rolled his eyes. As he said, he had never been able to defeat his grandfather since he was young. His grandfather knew everything he was thinking. It was as if a chip had been installed in his brain, and all his thoughts were controlled by his grandfather.

“Shelly’s daughter, Bella, underwent an eardrum repair surgery,” Wade said bluntly.

If his grandfather did not say that, Nox had even thought of a name for Shelly’s tombstone.

“So her daughter’s disability is in her ears,” Nox said indifferently. That was why he thought she looked very normal to be disabled.

“The ward is on the 9th floor, ward 028,” Wade said.

Nox frowned. “Whv are vou telling me that? I’m not going to see her.”

Wade’s face darkened for a second, but in the next second, he turned around and left. For some reason, it felt as if he found Nox hopeless.

Nox, however, did not care what his grandpa thought of him. Anyway, they had already severed all ties!

In the normal ward of the hospital, Shelly was taking care of Bella, who had been in bed ever since the surgery, and that was the first time Shelly saw the little girl so weak.

Seeing Bella like that made Shelly’s heart ache, so she stayed by Bella’s side and told her to be strong. After she was discharged from the hospital, she would be able to hear like a normal child without needing a hearing aid.

Bella had always been a good girl, and she would nod to whatever Shelly said. As such, Shelly had never regretted keeping Bella with her.

At that moment, because she was afraid that Bella would be bored, she took out a book and told Bella fairy tales. Her voice was so gentle and pleasant to the ears that even the child in the next room listened with great interest.

After the story ended, she looked up and saw a familiar person standing at the door. She rubbed her eyes, only to see Wade smiling kindly at her.

If Nox saw that smile, he would faint from anger again. Ever since he was young, no matter how he behaved, that old man had never smiled sincerely at him.

“Grandpa Winter.” Shelly quickly stood up from the bed.

When she saw Wade, she was somehow a little excited as she did not expect him to come to see her.

“Am I disturbing you?” Wade walked into the ward and glanced at Bella, who was lying on the bed.

“No, I was just telling Bella some stories, and I’m a little tired now,” Shelly quickly said,

She then found a chair in the ward and placed it in front of Wade, who did not refuse the offer and sat down.

As Shelly was sitting on the edge of the bed, she was very close to Wade.

“How was the surgery?” Wade asked.

“It went pretty well. The doctor said that everything went well, so she should be discharged from the hospital in a week and would only have to undergo regular check-ups after that. She should be able to recover a certain amount of hearing half a year later. Then, as she grows up and develops further, she should be able to recover the hearing of a normal person before she’s ten years old,” Shelly quickly said.

“That’s good.” Wade nodded.

“Grandpa Winter, why did you come to look for me today?” Shelly asked.

She did not ask him how he found her..
