1149 Monica Risked Her Life To Save Finn

If that continued ...

“Dr. Jones.” The assistant surgeon said, “How about we wait for Dr. West?”

Dr. West was currently the best surgeon in Harken.

Finn did not answer. He just walked away from the operating table and walked to a corner of the operating theater, seemingly to calm himself down.

However, at that moment, his fingers were trembling uncontrollably, and he could not calm down at all.

He simply could not accept Monica’s death…

The atmosphere in the operating theater was a little tense.

Suddenly, the nurse said loudly, “The patient’s heartbeat is accelerating!

Finn looked over and saw that Monica’s heart rate kept going up until it suddenly stopped.

“Prepare the defibrillator!” the assistant surgeon quickly instructed.

Inside the operating theater, they quickly made preparations, and the assistant surgeon began to electric shock Monica’s heart.

Again and again, Monica’s heart was electric-shocked. However, there was no reaction from the heartbeat monitor.

The assistant surgeon was sweating profusely. After repeated failed attempts at defibrillation, he began to have the thought of giving up.

That was when he saw Finn suddenly walk over, took the defibrillator from his hand, and began to rescue Monica.

He put the defibrillator on her heart, which had suddenly stopped, and delivered the shock again and again.

“Dr. Jones...” The assistant surgeon and nurse called out to him.

It had been such a long time. If the heart had yet recovered and started beating again, Monica could be declared… dead.

However, Finn did not seem to hear them as he kept delivering the shock.

“Dr. Jones, she can’t be saved.” The assistant surgeon and the nurse had to remind him.

Even if he continued to try to rescue her, it would be useless because it was really over. Monica’s life had really ended.

However, Finn did not give up.

He could not hear the voices of the doctors and nurses. All he knew was that he wanted to save Monica, and he would risk his life to save her.

At that moment, in the operating theatre, some of the nurses’ eyes were already red. It was because Dr. Jones’s appearance made them feel sorry for him.

Just how much did he love her that he refused to give up? That was why he was so desperate to pull her back from death like crazy. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Everyone did not try to persuade Dr. Jones anymore. Even though everyone knew what the result was, no one said a word because of Finn’s appearance.

They even thought to themselves, ‘What if there’s really a miracle? What if a miracle really happened?’

“Dr. Jones.” As the nurse’s tears blurred her vision, she suddenly screamed, “There’s a number! There’s a number…”

Everyone looked at the surveillance equipment and saw that the heartbeat monitor, which had stopped for at least eight minutes suddenly, had numbers on it. 20, 30, 50, 60, 70... It slowly began to recover.

That was a miracle — the miracle of life.

Finn also glanced over and saw the heart rate steadily rising...

Then, his vision seemed to blur again. He did not know if it was sweat or tears, but it blocked his vision.

“Let’s begin to remove the blood clot,” Finn said.

In those few seconds, he had regained his composure.

The doctors and nurses seemed to have suddenly gained confidence as well. They felt that as long as they did not give up, anything was possible.

With that, the nurse helped Finn wipe his sweat and tears, while Finn picked up the scalpel again before cutting down with it.

If Monica could not make it through the surgery, he would die with her.

If she could survive, no matter what she would become in the future, be it brain dead, paralysis, epilepsy, low intelligence… as long as she was alive, he would be with her for a lifetime!

The surgery lasted for five hours. Little by little, Finn cleaned up all the blood clots in Monica’s brain.

During the entire process, Monica’s heartbeat fluctuated a few times, but she managed to pull through.

In the end, the surgery was a success.

Monica was pushed out of the operating theatre and directly sent to the intensive care unit.

Her life was no longer in danger, but he did not know what kind of side effects she would have after she woke up.

He did not even know if she could wake up.

Without taking off his surgical gown, Finn just stood outside the intensive care unit, looking at her.
