Chapter 326: The Wedding: Announcing It to the World

“Fourth Master, are you sure you don’t want to have dinner together?” Jeanne asked when she saw that Edward was about to get into the car.

Edward stopped in his tracks as he stepped into the car and then turned around.

Jeanne smiled. If he did not prefer to eat at the Lawrences’, she could eat with him somewhere else.

“Compared to having dinner, I’d rather eat... you, Ms. Lawrence.”

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat, and her face blushed red.

“So, I’ll see you,” said the man as he got in his car.

With that, he left, leaving Jeanne standing there in a daze.

When Fourth Master Swan was starting the car just now, she was angry but dared to say anything.

However, she suddenly thought of something and dialed Fourth Master Swan’s number.

The voice on the other end sounded like he was smiling. “If Ms. Lawrence can’t bear to part with me, I can come back immediately.”

“No.” Jeanne refused flatly, which made the other party unhappy.

Jeanne said, “I forgot to tell you something.”

“Ms. Lawrence, please speak.” Her tone was cold.

......

“Are we going to have a wedding ceremony?” Jeanne asked.

She was not sure if there would be a wedding ceremony. She had a feeling that Fourth Master Swan might just drive a car to pick her up, and that was all.

“Is Ms. Lawrence doubting me?”

“No. I said I would be fine with the wedding as long as Fourth Master is happy with it, and I wouldn’t interfere. But what I mean is, if there is a ceremony, can Monica be my bridesmaid?” Jeanne asked.

On the other end of the phone, Edward was surprised. “Why not?”

“...Isn’t it Harken’s rule that married women are not allowed to be bridesmaids?”

“To me, Ms. Lawrence is the rule.” Edward’s magnetic voice echoed in Jeanne’s ears. “Everything and everyone else is insignificant.”

She found that Fourth Master Swan had a way with words.

“Do you have any other needs? I’ll try my best to satisfy them.”

“That’s all.”

“Are you sure that’s all?” Edward asked. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Should she still have more needs? Moreover, why did Fourth Master Swan sound unhappy?

She thought for a moment and said, “There’s still one more.”

“Please speak.” His tone sounded a little lighter.

Should Fourth Master Swan not be someone who hated being troubled?

However, at that moment, why did she feel that Fourth Master Swan was happy for her to trouble him?

She said, “Can you not call me Ms. Lawrence?”

The person on the other end of the phone paused for a moment.

Jeanne bit her lip.

She thought it sounded nice when he called her “Jeannie”.

Besides, they were about to get married, and it was not a good idea for him to treat her as an outsider.

When she said that, the other side suddenly fell silent.

Was she... too controlling?

In fact, it was just a form of address, so it was not important.

The moment she began to feel awkward, she hurriedly opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, Fourth Master Swan said, “Just two more days.”

“Oh?” Jeanne was surprised.

“The form of address. Just two more days.”

Did it mean that Fourth Master Swan was trying to spice things up, or that he still needed time to develop his feelings for her?

Anyway, Jeanne smiled and said, “Actually, it’s just a form of address. You can call me whatever you want, as long as you like it.”

“Okay,” he replied.

“Take care, Fourth Master. I’m hanging up now.”

“Okay.”

After hanging up, Jeanne took a deep breath.

She did not know why, but every time she spoke to the Fourth Master, she felt overwhelmed.

Even though he said he liked her, she still felt like she was trying to play up to him!

She still felt that he was too out of her reach.

After that, Jeanne returned to the hall, where the atmosphere was tense.

Jeanne had expected Alexander to be unhappy because he did not receive any benefits.

However, Jeanne ignored him and went straight upstairs.

“You’re really proud now, huh?” Alexander snapped behind her.

Jeanne sneered and turned her head to look at him. “Shouldn’t you be happy for me for marrying Fourth Master Swan? However, why do I feel that, with that mocking tone of yours, you don’t want me to live a good life?”

“Jeanne!”

“I’m not your biological child, am I?” Jeanne asked.

“That’s enough!” Alexander was furious.

Jeanne could not care less about Alexander’s temper at all.

“Jeanne, you really shouldn’t think too highly of yourself. If a Swans’ wedding can be so abrupt, so much that they don’t even want our dowry, do you think they value this wedding very much? It’s just a formality!”

“Fourth Master said he would give me eight percent of the Swans’ shares.”

“Do you really believe that?” Alexander was being sarcastic. “When the time comes, you’ll see all the additional conditions placed on that eight percent of shares! In name, it’ll be yours, but in reality, it’ll still be the Swans. It is just for show!”
