Chapter 336: Ceremony Ended: What About the Marriage of Convenience We Agreed Upon?

After the president left under everyone’s gaze, the atmosphere in the hall in Universe Garden returned to normal.

Edward and Jeanne greeted Old Master Swan before the wedding ceremony officially began.

At that moment, all the Swans, young and old, started to show up in the hall once the president left.

To be precise, everyone was already waiting for Edward and Jeanne to arrive for the wedding ceremony to start before the president came.

However, the sudden arrival of the president had prompted Old Master Swan to clear the main hall out of respect for the president. Hence, it was only natural for the others to appear and take their seats as soon as the president left.

Everyone looked at the couple in the main hall, dressed in white and down the aisle.

Among the Swans’ guests, Eden and Jasmine were both present.

Jasmine was really jealous, and it was visible on her face. It was not that she did not want to pretend to be friendly and kind, but she just could not keep up the act.

She thought Jeanne’s wedding would only be a formality. Never did she imagine that it would be so grand.

Edward picking Jeanne up with rows of cars filled with various types of flowers had become the hottest topic of the day, making all the women in the Harken jealous of Jeanne.

She could have accepted it if it was just an expensive wedding.

In any case, the Swans family was rich, so spending a lot of money on a wedding was not a big deal. However, she could take the fact that they spent so much money and put so much effort into the wedding.

At the thought of her wedding with Eden back then... It was nothing compared to this. Even on their wedding day, Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan snatched the limelight from her and Eden’s wedding by being on the trending topics.

......

She gritted her teeth as she looked at Jeanne in the luxurious, noble-looking designer gown, and her heart twisted in jealousy.

Wearing that gown was a symbol of status.

She really wanted to lie to herself, but she could not convince herself that Fourth Master Swan did not love Jeanne.

If he did not love her, the wedding would not be so grand, and he would not have put in so much effort.

How did Jeanne seduce Fourth Master Swan? How could she?

Jasmine tried her best to look normal and keep a smile on her face. However, Jasmine was not the only one trying to suppress her emotions.

The man beside her, Eden, was at his limit, trying to hide his emotions.

For today’s wedding, Eden was in charge of greeting the guests at the Swan family’s manor, so he did not go along with picking Jeanne up. If he had not seen the news of Edward picking Jeanne up with rows of cars filled with flowers, he would not have known that his fourth uncle went to such an extent to marry Jeanne! In fact, there had never been a wedding in their family’s history that was of the scale of his fourth uncle’s today!

He thought it would just be a simple ceremony for such an abrupt wedding. He had even thought of how to ridicule Jeanne for thinking too highly of herself.

Now, he secretly gritted his teeth and looked fiercely at Jeanne. All done up for the wedding in the luxurious designer gown, she looked shockingly beautiful.

Even though he was a distance away from her, she caught his eye as soon as his fourth uncle led her into Universe Garden.

He clenched his fists unconsciously.

The woman should have been his. She should have belonged to him!

Yet now, he just watched as she, shyly and charmingly, stood by his fourth uncle’s side.

No. He could not let go just like that!

He suppressed the anger in him and looked at the couple, who were down the aisle, saying their vows.

George was also standing by Jeanne’s side obediently.

Even though he did not speak much throughout the ceremony and was clearly not in a good mood, he would do whatever was asked of him in the end. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The groomsman and bridesmaid handed Jeanne and Edward each a ring.

“Jeanne.” Edward slipped the ring on Jeanne’s finger.

Then, it was Jeanne’s turn to put the ring on Edward’s finger before they both smiled and kissed each other.

After that, they turned to Zachary, whom Jeanne greeted, “Dad.”

That was right. She had to change the way she addressed him, and it was very awkward.

From her grandfather at the beginning, to her uncle, to... her dad?!

The corners of her mouth curled up into a smile. She looked very virtuous and virtuous.

Zachary responded, held the newlyweds’ hands, and said, “I wish you both a long and happy marriage.”
