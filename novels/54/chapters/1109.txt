1110 Edward’s Choice

He should probably be able to figure out that after he had successfully tricked Kingsley and escaped last time, Kingsley would definitely not let him get what he wanted this time. This time, Kingsley would definitely not be deceived by his treachery and would even kill him.

He should be able to predict what would happen to him. Yet, he still called Kingsley over.

They looked at each other under the car’s headlights.

Kingsley said coldly, “Fourth Master Swan, you’re really not afraid of death!”

He had realized at the first moment that there was no one protecting Edward and that Edward had come to see him alone.

“The fact that I could inform you to come here means that I’m prepared to die.” Edward enunciated every word.

That sentence made Jeanne’s heart ache a little, and she bit her lip so hard that it lost all color.

“What do you want?” Kingsley asked.

For Edward to offer himself up, it was definitely not because he wanted to die. He naturally had his own motives.

Edward said, “Send Jeanne away, and don’t ever let her return to Harken.”

Kingsley frowned.

“I know you have the ability to get Jeanne to leave safely!” Edward said bluntly.

“This is your condition for the exchange?” Kingsley asked, “Your death in exchange for Jeanne’s safety?”

“Yes.” Edward agreed.

Kingsley just looked at Edward coldly, as if sizing him up.

“If I’m dead, you’ll have one less threat. If I’m dead, Jeanne wouldn’t be a bargaining chip for the Sanders, and the Sanders won’t keep chasing after her!” Edward had thought everything through.

The Sanders had made use of Jeanne because of their relationship.

Once he died, Jeanne would be useless to the Duncans. Then, Jeanne, that so-called trump card, would be useless!

Kingsley looked at Edward and then at Jeanne, whose face was pale.

He said, “Alright.”

Kingsley immediately agreed.

He had never agreed for Jeanne to be the bait, but he could not find a better way to reject them. After all, he and the Sanders were in a mutually beneficial relationship. However, the Sanders ruled over a country, while he was only a local assassin organization. His power and status were incomparable to them! Once the two sides fell out and he lost the support of the Sanders, the other organizations and even some small countries that had been tempted to attack would attack the Hills without any restraint. Then, the Hills would face a great crisis.

Of course, there was another important point. The reason why the Sanders could take over the Harken was because of the Hills’ contribution. Once the country was taken back by the original ruler, the Hills would naturally become the target of revenge.

In order for the Hills to protect themselves and become even more glorious, Kingsley had to be controlled by Warren.

The only way was to follow the rules of the Sanders and let Jeanne be the one to start the war!

However, the best way for Jeanne to escape unscathed would be Edward’s death.

Kingsley did not expect Edward to be able to figure out everything so quickly. He even made that decision so quickly!

His eyes were fixed on Edward, and he watched as Edward subconsciously tightened his grip on Jeanne’s hand.

Edward should know very well that once he let go, he would be dead.

He turned to look at Jeanne, who was also looking at him.

Meeting each other again this time was not a reunion but a separation.

He said, “Jeannie.”

His voice was still deep and magnetic.

Jeanne’s heart ached. In fact, it had been hurting bit by bit. She had been feeling that way ever since she appeared at the Sanders’ wedding.

The thought of the damage her identity would bring to Edward ... 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She had actually been suppressing the thought of the damage her identity would bring to Edward all along and struggling with it.

That was why she remained silent — to try to hide all his emotions. She did not want Edward to know or want Edward to be soft-hearted toward her.

However, in the end, he still had to sacrifice himself for her.

“I’ve told Finn to pick up George, and Finn will protect George with his life. As long as you leave Harken and contact Finn after things have stabilized, he will send George to you safely,” Edward explained.

It was as if he was saying his last words.

Jeanne’s eyes turned red. Slowly, her eyes filled with tears.

“Promise me that you will never return to Harken. No matter whose regime it becomes, never come back!” Edward said.

As he said that, his eyes seemed to turn red.

Jeanne had never seen Edward cry before, and that was probably the only time in her life that she would be able to see it.

However, it was at the moment of life and death.

“Promise me!” Edward forced Jeanne to answer.

Jeanne bit her lips and refused not let go. She looked at Edward with her eyes red.

However, he would still be in Harken. How could she not come back for the rest of her life?

How could she leave his corpse on this land while she went away?

“Please, promise me.” Edward’s voice was hoarse, and it also trembled.

Tears streamed down Jeanne’s face.

She knew that Edward did not want her to return because Harken was no longer safe for her, because he did not want her to avenge him, and because he wanted her to forget him completely.

She had never been willing to admit her feelings for Edward, and she did not know when she had developed feelings for him.

However, at that moment, she really could not ignore the pain in her heart. It was as if her heart was being torn apart, piece by piece.

...

“Alright.” Jeanne nodded.

The moment she agreed, she even felt that the sky was falling down.

However, Edward smiled. His red eyes and perfect lips curved into a smile that could cause the downfall of a city.

He said nothing more of their relationship, the sadness, the reluctance to part, and everything else.

He did not say anything. Instead, little by little, he let go of her reddened hand and let her go to Kingsley’s side.

Still, Jeanne did not leave. Her vision was so blurry that she could no longer see Edward’s face clearly.

She did not know if Edward was the same as her and could not see her clearly.

Even so, she just kept staring at him.

“Jeanne! Come here!” Kingsley shouted.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly.

Then, she turned around and walked away from Edward.

...

She knew very well what it would mean if she turned around…
