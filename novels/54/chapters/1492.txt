Edward nodded and said, “Send me off.”

It meant to see him off, which Candice did not refuse, and she followed Edward out of the hall.

Chloe looked at them and stomped her feet. Somehow, she had a feeling that she could not break them up no matter what.

How could Edward tolerate Candice so much? He clearly did not love her. If he loved her, he would not have stopped her from getting pregnant.

However, if he did not love her, why was he so nice to Candice? Was it just because of political reasons that he had no choice but to treat her well?

Outside the hall, Candice sent Edward into the car.

The moment Edward got into the car, he said, “Candice, are you very dissatisfied with the way I educate Paige?”

Candice was stunned. She thought that Edward had called her out to tell her that she was too stern with Paige just now. After all, in front of so many people, Edward had also considered her reputation, but she did not expect Edward to suddenly ask her about Paige’s education.

“It’s my first time being a father to such a young child, so I don’t have any experience either. I’m always afraid that I won’t take good care of her, and then…” Edward hesitated.

At that moment, it felt to Candice that he wanted to say he would not be able to answer to Paige’s mother.

“George didn’t grow up by my side. He only came back to me when he was six.” Edward seemed to be explaining why he doted on Paige so much.

“No, I think Paige is wonderful. She has a good personality and a good upbringing. It’s just that she’s too dependent. However, I understand you. After all, it’s very difficult for a single father to be a good father.”

“I’ve already made arrangements for Paige to go to kindergarten. From now on,

I’ll listen to you when it comes to Paige’s education.”

Candice smiled.” Alright.”

She agreed right away. She thought, even though she and Edward could not become a husband and wife who truly loved each other, they could become life partners who trusted each other.

Everyone’s pursuit of marriage and happiness was different. To her, she believed that becoming part of a family was also a kind of happiness, and it did not have to be a passionate love.

“I’m going to work,” Edward said.

“Be careful on the road.” Candice smiled, looking like a good wife and mother.

Candice watched the car disappear from her sight before she turned around and returned to the lobby.

In the hall, Chloe seemed to be blaming herself.

When she saw Candice return, she quickly went up to her. “Sis, did Edward scold you because of me? It was all my fault. If I weren’t so worried about Paige, I wouldn’t have called Edward, and it wouldn’t have caused a conflict between the two of you-”

“Slap!” Candice suddenly gave Chloe a hard slap across her face.

Chloe was stunned. She covered her face and looked at Candice in disbelief. “Sis, why are you venting your anger on me because you and Edward had a conflict? I was just concerned about Paige. Do you have to hit me like this?”

“Slap!” Candice slapped her again.

The deafening sound echoed in the hall.

Chloe’s face was swollen from the slap, and she was also infuriated. She could not believe that Candice actually hit her, and Candice even slapped her twice. She then raised her hand, wanting to slap Candice back.

“Try it!” Candice’s eyes narrowed. Her sharp gaze was lethal.

Chloe’s raised hand froze in mid-air. She was shocked by Candice.

“Those two slaps are for Teddy,” Candice said coldly.

She could hear clearly from the toilet that Chloe slapped Teddy twice.

“You still have three days left, and you’d better restrain yourself. Otherwise, next time, it won’t be as simple as an eye for an eye!” Candice threatened.

Her cold voice sent shivers down Chloe’s spine.

Chloe bit her lips tightly and watched as Candice turned around to leave after saying that. It seemed like Candice did not take her seriously at all. Was it just because she became the Leader’s wife she could be so arrogant?!

All of Chloe’s suppressed emotions erupted at that moment. She shouted at Candice, “Candice, do you really think that you can get carried away just because you’re the Leader’s wife? Let me tell you, Edward only married you because you’re Dad’s daughter. Do you really think Edward loves you?”

Candice stopped in her tracks. She had always known that Edward did not love her. Even if she was confused sometimes, she knew her limits.

She realized from the first time she heard him call out Jeanne’s name after he fell asleep that their marriage was a political marriage and that their happiness only came from helping each other.

“You really want to get pregnant with Edward’s child and secure your position as Leader’s wife, don’t you?” Chloe mocked. “I didn’t want to say it at first because I was afraid of hurting you, but now I think I have to remind you so that you don’t think too highly of yourself!”

Candice frowned.

Then, she heard Chloe enunciate each word from behind her.. “Edward has been giving you birth control pills!”
