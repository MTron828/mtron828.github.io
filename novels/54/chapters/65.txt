Chapter 66: My Master Told You to Keep Warm

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the huge room, Nox said word by word, “Don’t worry, you weren’t cuckolded.”

Edward gave him a look.

Nox calmed down and said, “But it is said that West’s mixed-blood son has been pursuing Ms. Lawrence. Don’t worry, Ms. Lawrence refused. That said, for your happiness, I’ve specially investigated West’s mixed-blood son, Mubier. He’s 22 years old and young. Other than being young and knowing how to flirt with girls, he can’t be compared to you.”

Edward did not have any expression.

Nox smiled smugly. “Don’t you think that I’m great and looked into everything for you?!”

“Are you sure that’s what I wanted to know?” Edward raised his eyebrow slightly.

“Or else?” Nox was a little confused.

He had followed Fourth Master Swan for 25 years.

Yes, from the moment he was born.

So, how could he not know what Fourth Master Swan was thinking?!

“Take down the news,” Edward said bluntly.

Nox was stunned. “What news?”

As he said that, he went over to look at Edward’s phone very naturally.

Edward turned his phone off.

Nox frowned. “What is it?”

“Just do as I say,” Edward said coldly.

Nox was speechless, but he still nodded. “Okay.”

“You can leave now.”

“I still have something to say!” Nox was a little excited, but his expression was still very serious.

Edward looked at Nox.

Nox said, “I just received news from the technology department that the Swans’ real estate industry’s internal firewall has been tampered with.”

Edward frowned slightly. “Weren’t you the one who supervised the firewall? You said that it’s... indestructible? !”

“I went all over the world to look for the world’s top software experts, and they upgraded and maintained it from time to time. I even specially looked for master hackers to crack it. No one has cracked it.”

“Well, the truth is that a flaw has appeared now.”

“It’s not really cracked yet. The technology department is urgently repairing it now.”

“Don’t do anything first.”

“Huh? Aren’t you afraid that the company’s information will be leaked?” Nox was puzzled.

“Let’s see how capable this person is and how far he can crack it. Is there an invisible figure we overlooked and don’t know about? If so, we have to figure out who this person is, and whether he’s an enemy or a friend. So, don’t alert the person and follow the clues,” Edward instructed.

Nox smacked his forehead. “Why didn’t I think of such a thorough plan! Fourth Master Swan, how does your brain work?!”

Edward ignored Nox and said indifferently, “Go back. I’m sleepy.”

“You summon me when you need me, but you chase me away right after you’re done using me,” Nox muttered, “How heartless!”

In the end, he turned around and left.

After he left, Master Fourth Master Swan looked at his phone again.

On the screen, there was a photo of Jeanne being secretly taken by someone.

In the photo, Jeanne’s back was completely bare. Her perfect back curve was not hidden at all. Her long and slender legs were straight and smooth. The moment she looked back with surprise, she was so beautiful.

It was originally a financial news article. The news exposed the relationship between Jeanne and MUK. However, there were many misleading words such as “godfather”. This was not a simple word in many cases. Naturally, it was published as an article by the media.

Nevertheless, most of the comments were not about the bad relationship between Jeanne and West...

[This woman is too beautiful.]

[My nose is bleeding.]

[As a woman, I can only say that my heart is moved…]

[Does Eldest Young Lady Lawrence still need a godfather?]

[At this moment, I suddenly want to Xuan. Were you blind seven years ago? No, you shouldn’t have eyes.]

In fact…

Topics such as #MsLawrencesBack, #MsLawrenceWaist, and #MsLawrenceLongLegs were trending. They were ranked one, two, and three respectively.

Even #EdenWasBlind was the 12th trending topic.

…

The next day, Jeanne was woken up by the ringtone of her phone.

She glanced at the incoming call. “Monica.”

Monica was so energetic that it was scary.

‘Isn’t she tired after a whole day?’

“Where’s your news?” Monica had always been very agitated.

‘News?

‘What news?’

Jeanne sat up from the bed. “What’s wrong?”

“Last night, before I went to bed, I saw that you were on trending topics due to a piece of news. There were quite a few trends, but I saw that other than making you more popular, they didn’t have any negative effect on you, so I didn’t pay too much attention to them. When I woke up this morning, it seemed like I had a dream last night. Your news was handled so cleanly that I couldn’t find it even after searching!”

Jeanne did not seem to mind. “If it’s gone, so be it.”

“How can this be?!” Monica was indignant. “That photo of you yesterday was so beautiful. How can it be gone just like that?! Eden would definitely regret it if he saw it. More importantly, the topic of #EdenWasBlind was even trending. There were countless people who tagged him on Twitter, but they’re all gone now. Damn it!”

Jeanne smiled, “Do you really care so much about making Eden regret?”

“Who asked him to cheat on you? He even did it so matter-of-factly without any remorse. Thinking about how he treated you so well but secretly slept with Jasmine and even shamelessly said bad things about you in front of the media makes me so angry that I’m going to die!” Monica was easily controlled by her emotions.

“There’s nothing to be angry about. A cheating couple won’t end well.” Jeanne’s eyes turned cold. “Besides, you said that there were many people who tagged him last night. How could he not see the news?”

Monica was stunned. “That’s true.”

“On the contrary, I have to thank the person who removed my news. Otherwise, once the Swans’ public relations team makes a move today, do you think that my news will continue to develop in a good direction?” Jeanne could completely imagine how things would turn out.

In the end, it would be like seven years ago, where her reputation would be in tatters.

Her dark and cold gaze carried a hint of cruelty.

“You seem to make sense.” Monica was once again convinced by Jeanne.

“So don’t be conflicted. You slept so late last night and woke up so early this morning? Aren’t you tired?”

Monica suddenly fell silent for a few seconds.

“What’s wrong?”

“Nothing, I’m just planning to go back to sleep.” Monica’s tone was light.

Jeanne kept feeling that Monica was hiding something.

Monica directly hung up the phone.

She lay on her bed.

Could she tell Jeanne that she, who was tired after coming back in the middle of the night last night, did not sleep at all for the whole night?

‘Damn.

‘This is frustrating.’

Jeanne put down her phone and planned to sleep for a while.

It was only 6:00 am, and she had slept late last night.

She had just laid down when someone knocked on the door.

Jeanne got up and opened the door.

A servant stood at the door. “Miss, a gentleman called Teddy is looking for you.”

‘Teddy again?!’

Jeanne went back to her room and changed into a set of clothes. She washed up briefly before going downstairs.

Downstairs, Teddy stood there respectfully and waited for her.

At this moment, other than the servants, no one else in the house had woken up so early.

“Has your master fallen sick again?” Jeanne asked straightforwardly.

‘Who knows?!’

Anyway, Edward had woken Teddy up before dawn.

Teddy said, “Fourth Master asked me to bring you some clothes.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

As he spoke, many people walked in from outside the hall. All of them were carrying bags of clothes in their hands. They stood in rows behind Teddy with an imposing manner.

Jeanne frowned slightly.

“My master said that the weather in South Hampton City is rather cold. He also told you to keep warm, Ms. Lawrence.”

‘Cold?!

‘It’s the middle of f*cking summer now. The weather is 37 to 38 degrees. How is it cold?!’
