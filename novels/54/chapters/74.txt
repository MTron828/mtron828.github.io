Chapter 75: Achieved Her Wish

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Otherwise, I’ll take the blame and resign!” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly.

Everyone looked at her.

She had a calm and collected manner, and she was also domineering!

“Anyone can say such arrogant words! “In the midst of the shock, Winston snorted coldly. “Why should we waste our time and let you do whatever you want here? Why should we let you trifle with the company that we worked so hard to build? Not to mention doubling the volume of business and increasing the share, the fact that you want to win the contract with MUK is simply a joke!”

“Is this the reason the Lawrence Enterprise has been stagnating for so many years?” Jeanne retorted.

Winston’s expression turned even uglier. “What do you mean?!”

“You’ve never accepted anything new! You’ve always chosen to do things step-by-step! In the past, when the Lawrence Enterprise still had a market and everyone believed in the old-fashioned effect, this path was feasible. Now, with the development of information technology, people’s acceptance of things has increased rapidly. Even in the face of our enterprise’s declining market share and volume of business, you’re still so conservative and old-fashioned, President Stone. Is there still hope for the future of the Lawrence Enterprise?”

“Jeanne!” Winston was ridiculed by Jeanne. He slammed the table and stood up. “Don’t think that you can do whatever you want here just because you’re a member of the Lawrences!”

“I never thought that I could do whatever I want just because I’m a Lawrence. On the contrary, because I’m a Lawrence, I have an unshirkable responsibility in the Lawrence Enterprise. That’s why I want to change. I want to change the traditional business model of the Lawrence Enterprise and find a business model that’s more suitable for the masses and more easily accepted by people.” Jeanne looked at Winston. She was not afraid at all, and her aura was still very strong.

“Yes, I admit that the Lawrence Enterprise’s business has indeed fallen behind and can’t keep up with the trend. We also want to change this.” Winston was still very angry. “But you, a little girl with an illegitimate child, don’t even have a good reputation. What ability do you have that’s worth us handing over the responsibility to you!”

“Is a month or two so hard for you to accept?” Jeanne questioned.

“The workplace never does things that waste time. This is irresponsible to nearly 10,000 employees in our enterprise!”

“You speak so grandly. Let me ask you then, President Stone. Do you already have a transformation plan? Is the Lawrence Enterprise already starting to develop in this aspect?”

“We’re already starting the transformation project. If everything goes as expected, there’ll be a huge change in half a year!”

“Half a year?” Jeanne’s lips curled up.

Winston’s expression was very ugly.

He had been in the Lawrence Enterprise for many years, but he was actually humiliated by a little girl at the meeting.

“I said I only need two months, and you need half a year. Isn’t that a waste of time instead?” Jeanne looked at Winston.

“The half a year has been planned out, and it’s not something you say casually. You said that you can make our enterprise completely transform and gain profits in two months. Do you think we’re stupid and believe whatever you say?!”

“What if I achieve it?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow slightly.

“I’ll write my name backward.”

“So you agreed?”

Winston was stunned. “Don’t set me up here. I won’t agree.”

“President Stone, you’re probably worried about having to write your name backward then...”

“Jeanne, that’s enough!” Winston gnashed his teeth in anger.

“Actually, to me, it’s not important at all whether I take on the position of marketing director,” Jeanne suddenly said.

Winston was trembling with anger.

‘This little girl is deliberately going against me, isn’t she?!

‘She was so aggressive just now, but she’s suddenly taking a step back now.’

Jeanne said, “I’ve said it before. I can understand the concerns of all the leaders. Of course, this concern has indeed made me deeply feel the reason the Lawrence Enterprise can’t be transformed...”

“Jeanne, watch your words,” Alexander called out to her.

Jeanne nodded. On such an occasion, she would still give Alexander face. “I don’t want the position of marketing director. I only need the enterprise to give me a project team. The team members will be chosen by me. The goal is very simple, which is to obtain the exclusive rights to MUK and let the Lawrence Enterprise transform into online marketing. In this way, I’ll only manage a small group of people to do a project to overcome the difficulties. It won’t affect the entire operation of the enterprise. If that’s the case, do any of you still have any objections?”

She had reached this point.

If they still refused, they would be deliberately making things difficult for her.

Bryce asked, “Then what if you don’t get the exclusive rights to the MUK partnership?”

“I’ll leave at any time.” Jeanne was very determined. “But, what if I get it?”

Alexander directly said, “I’ll leave the position of marketing director to you. I believe that the others won’t have any objections.”

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

Winston still felt a little uncomfortable in the end. He said, “The Lawrences are still siding with their people. Alexander is already so old, yet he still lets a 20-year-old girl mess around in the company. If it wasn’t for the fact that I’ve been in the enterprise for so many years, I would’ve wanted to find another way out.”

Alexander’s expression changed instantly.

In the Lawrence Enterprise, other than the chairman, Jonathan, he had the most authority as the executive general manager. Despite that, due to his lack of ability in all aspects, he was always suppressed by the senior presidents of other departments. Many times, they did not even give him face, making it very difficult for him to step down.

“President Stone.” Jeanne was very serious, “As the senior president of the Lawrence Enterprise and a member of the board of directors, weren’t you being a little too offensive? You just said that as a member of the Lawrences, it’s understandable for the Lawrence Enterprise to allow their children to be nurtured here. Now, you’re discriminating against us without any reason. Are you deliberately targeting me? Or are you targeting my family?”

“What nonsense are you spouting? I’m just saying that from the company’s standpoint!”

“May I know which part of the company’s interests have been harmed by my appearance?” Jeanne questioned Winston.

Winston was somewhat speechless from being rebuked.

“And according to what I know, didn’t you also recruit your nephew into the company and make him the director of the logistics department of the general affairs department? I seem to have also heard that your nephew once caused a small accident. It is said that he’s light-fingered, but because of your reputation, he wasn’t punished...” Jeanne deliberately raised her voice, “I don’t know how you can be so magnanimous and accept such a matter that affects the interests of the company.”

“You...” Winston was so angry that his face was red.

He never thought that he would be so ugly in public one day.

“Enough!” Alexander’s voice was very loud and full of authority. “This is a dignified meeting. Don’t you have any manners?!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jeanne, Winston, and everyone else fell silent.

Alexander said, “I won’t say anything else. From now on, Jeanne will establish her project team. The members will be chosen by her. The other higher-ups also don’t have any objections. Once Jeanne’s project fails, she’ll leave and never step foot into the enterprise again. However, if she succeeds, the position of a marketing director will belong to her!”

Winston held back his anger and did not say anything more at this moment.

“Today’s meeting ends here. Meeting adjourned!” Alexander said and left in large strides.

The corners of Jeanne’s mouth curled into a smile.

Achieving her wish was as simple as this!
