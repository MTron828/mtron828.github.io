Chapter 180: Took Jeanne Away With Dominance

“Eden, you’re really not afraid of death!” A bloodthirsty voice sounded.

Eden was shocked all of a sudden, and his hair stood on end.

He turned his head abruptly, and the moment he turned his head, he saw his fourth uncle.

‘Why is he suddenly here?

‘Shouldn’t he disappear for at least a week?!’

At this moment.

Melody had also returned.

It was obvious that she had been forced back by Eden’s fourth uncle.

Edward’s aura completely suppressed everyone at this moment. This included Melody, who was supposed to be at her home ground.

Melody seemed to be shocked by Eden’s fourth uncle’s vicious aura at this moment. She just looked straight at Edward and did not let anyone stop him from entering.

Jeanne was also a little surprised.

She did not think that Fourth Master Swan would appear here. She had always thought that the person who would appear would only be Kingsley.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She was to be able to remain calm and face everything calmly.

Edward glared fiercely at Eden.

Eden unconsciously clenched his fists tightly. He was trying his best to calm himself down. He even felt that he would be so frightened by his fourth uncle’s appearance at the next second that his body would tremble.

Edward’s eyes shifted. He no longer looked at the others and walked straight toward Jeanne.

Jeanne’s heart... Throbbed.

It was obvious that she was touched. At this moment, she could not even ignore it.

Not only could she not ignore it, but she also felt that her heart was beating at an unusual rate. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Her heart was beating hard.

She suddenly felt that this scene was somewhat familiar.

It was a familiar scene in her imagination.

Seven years ago, when Jeanne was faced with her father’s cruelty, Eden’s despicable act, as well as everyone’s insults and slurs, she had also thought that if only someone could appear to defend her against everything she was facing…

It turned out that… This was how it would feel.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She was also trying her best to restrain herself.

She did not want to be impulsive.

After all, she was no longer that 18-year-old girl.

If Fourth Master Swan had appeared when she was 18 years old and held her in his arms, perhaps…

There was no ‘perhaps’.

There were also no ‘ifs’.

This world was just so realistic.

“I’m late,” Fourth Master Swan said. It was completely different from the cold-blooded tone he had used on Eden earlier. There was even regret and tenderness in his tone.

Jeanne smiled faintly.

He was indeed late.

He was seven years too late.

Nonetheless, she could play along at this time. “No, it’s just right.”

Edward smiled.

His smile was truly captivating at this time.

He took off his coat and placed it gently on Jeanne’s thin body.

Afterward, he hugged her very naturally in his arms.

At this moment, Jeanne did not push him away. She leaned gently into his arms.

It was such an uncontradictory scene where they looked like a match made in heaven. However, Melody and Eden had an even more ferocious look on their faces.

They seemed to be outsiders while Edward and Jeanne were expressing their love for each other.

Under the pressure of Edward’s aura, Melody forced herself to take the initiative again. She said, “Edward, it’s useless even if you come! The evidence of Jeanne’s crime is conclusive, and she’ll still be punished by the law. I advise you not to interfere at this time, lest you get your feet wet. Your loss will outweigh your gain.”

“Whether or not I want to interfere and if my loss outweighs my gain, that’s my business. Ms. Sanders, you seem to be too controlling.”

“Edward, why are you still obstinate?! Don’t you know who’s the ruler of Harken now? How dare you go against the Sanders? You...”

“If you want to take Jeanne away, you need my permission! If I don’t agree...” Edward suddenly gave off a cold aura, making the others gasp. “Let alone the Sanders, even if it’s the king of heaven, I can kill him!”

Melody was stunned.

At this moment, Eden was so scared that he did not dare to speak. Even his breathing changed.

Edward narrowed his eyes, but he then looked at Jeanne with a gentle gaze.

He asked in a calm tone, “Ms. Sanders, do you understand?”

Melody gritted her teeth.

She would not be threatened by Edward.

The Swans were merely a meritorious contributor to the founding of the country. The Sanders would respect the Swans from the standpoint of humanism, but if the Swans violated the rights of the Sanders, the Sanders would also go against them. As for the Swans, what could they do to counter the Sanders? The Sanders would suffer some economic losses at most, but the Swans would suffer terribly.
