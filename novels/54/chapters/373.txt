Chapter 374: Danger Level Up, Jeanne’s Ability Exposed

She just sat there nervously, waiting for a long time.

There was still no other sound on the island, but she dared not fall asleep.

After all, she was still being chased, and the people chasing her were on the same island as her.

She gritted her teeth, keeping herself alert while waiting for time to pass.

Suddenly, her heart skipped a beat as footsteps sounded in her ears.

However, instead of running, she suddenly hid in the surrounding trees and forests so that she could keep an eye on her surroundings.

While hiding, she could feel a group of people stopping around her.

They stopped for a long time and did not leave, as if they were searching for something.

In the darkness, Jeanne could not see who those people were, so she could only rely on her senses and her luck to gamble.

She called out through gritted teeth, “Nox.”

Her voice was very low.

“Jeanne!” Nox immediately responded to her.

Jeanne heaved a huge sigh of relief as she stood up from the forest.

......

At that moment, Nox had also discovered her location.

In fact, she was not relying on luck but on the fact that the group of people did not move out of the area for a very long time.

It was most probably because the GPS locator on her hand was pointing to her location, which was why they had stopped searching.

In a few steps, Nox was before Jeanne. “Where’s Fourth Master Swan?”

“He lured the others away and disappeared.”

“Damn it!” Nox cursed before he quickly turned around and ordered, “Quickly find him.”

A group of about twenty people left in an instant, but Nox kept five people with him and Jeanne.

A few of them were also walking in front.

As they walked, Nox asked about the situation, “Is Fourth Master Swan injured?”

“No.”

“How many people were after you guys?”

“About ten.”

“Fourth Master Swan versus ten...” Nox’s eyes narrowed.

It was not because they had no chance of victory, but because if the other party had a gun, it would be a little troublesome. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

His footsteps quickened, and Jeanne followed them.

At that moment, it was about 5 a.m. There was some light in the surroundings, and the sky was starting to turn bright.

Jeanne bit her lip and kept following behind Nox, who had been asking his men for updates. However, no one had found any traces of Fourth Master Swan so far.

Suddenly, a group of birds cried out in the sky, followed by gunshot sounds.

Jeanne’s body froze.

Nox was also a little frightened for a moment, but he quickly ran over after that.

Jeanne also ran over until she heard his footsteps suddenly halt.

Nox ordered loudly, “Hide.”

In an instant, countless gunshots rang out in their surroundings, all firing at them as if they wanted to kill them all.

Nox gritted his teeth and immediately shielded Jeanne behind him. “Damn it. We’ve been discovered.”

The person beside Nox asked him in a low voice, “Should we send people over to support us?”

“No need. Let them look for Fourth Master Swan. We’ll handle this ourselves.”

“Yes,” the person beside him replied respectfully.

Jeanne was now behind Nox, who handed her a pistol.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“Do you need me to teach you how to shoot?” Nox asked.

“No need.”

With that, Nox nodded. He knew Jeanne had never been a simple one.

He said, “Now, I’ll bring two people over to attract the other party’s attention. Jeanne, all you need to do is watch out for your own safety.”

“Okay.”

Nox made a prompt decision and brought two people along with him to run out of the forest.

Then, gunshots started firing at Nox and those few people.

While Nox was running, he also shot at a few people at the same time.

In such an intense gunfight, there were casualties on both sides.

At that moment, the sky was much brighter, so their surroundings eventually lit up.

Jeanne had been hiding behind a big tree vigilantly, and Nox was not far from her.

The other party did not know how many people they had, but the other party definitely had more than the ten people that Jeanne had mentioned earlier.

In other words… The other party had sent more people ashore.

Suddenly, everything around them fell terrifyingly silent. Perhaps, in the next second, someone would jump out and shoot everyone to death.

Now, only one person was left by Nox’s side. Including Jeanne, there were a total of three people.

The other party had lost quite a number of people, but they should have more people than Nox’s group.

Both sides were in a stalemate, and no one dared to act so rashly.

The confrontation lasted a long time, until the sky was bright, with birds flying above and past them.

Nox did not seem to want to drag the fight on any longer.
