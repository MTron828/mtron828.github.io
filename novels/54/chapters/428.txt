Chapter 429: Monica’s Confesses Her Love

That night, Finn said he wanted to start over with her.

She rejected him at that time.

It was true. Since she had decided not to be with Finn, she did not want to be entangled with him anymore. In fact, she had her own bottom line to keep.

When she rejected him, she knew how much her heart ached and how hard it was for her.

Hence, that night, she really cried buckets and went to work the next day with her swollen eyes.

However, Finn showed no emotion.

She admitted it. If Finn could be more persistent, or if he said it a few more times, perhaps she would compromise.

Nevertheless, Finn would not. If she was rejected, there was no turning back.

In that case, she did not want to stay any longer. She would never be able to get Finn to give too much to her anyway.

From then on, Monica really accepted Michael, from just saying it to accepting it.

She told herself that she might never meet a man who treated her better than Michael, so she had to learn to cherish him.

Especially after being hurt so badly in her relationship with Finn, she had to cherish that man who loved her selflessly.

She had already made up her mind and given up on Finn.

......

If it were not for that accident and seeing Finn protecting her...

Of course, being moved was one thing, but the reason why she had made up her mind to be with Finn was that she loved her very much.

If Finn really died, she might not see the reason for living anymore.

Since she loved him so much that she could die for him, was she afraid of Finn not loving her enough? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As long as she loved him, that was enough.

Moreover, she could still sense that Finn liked her a little.

Otherwise, why would he protect her like that when they were kidnapped? Why would he risk his life to protect her?

That was it.

Based on what Finn had done for her, she felt she could agree to be with Finn for the rest of her life.

In the ward, Finn had already finished the bowl of soup.

Due to his serious injury, Finn’s appetite was very strictly portioned, so he could only eat that bowl of soup for one meal.

.

However, the doctor said he would eat more meals with smaller portion sizes.

Monica silently put the bowl of soup aside.

Suddenly, the two of them fell silent.

Monica did not seem to know how to express to Finn how she felt all these years.

Besides, she was not someone who liked to dwell on the past. If things were so bad in the past, why would she cling to them?

She believed that as long as she lived well in the present, all was good.

That was why she needed Finn to know that she liked him.

So, at that moment, she said again, “Finn, I really like you.”

Finn looked at her.

“I’ve liked you from the very beginning.” Monica was very sure.

Finn’s eyes moved slightly.

“I admit I was also moved by Michael,” Monica said.

At that, Finn’s expression turned a little ugly.

“But that was all. I definitely didn’t like him. I just thought he could make me forget you temporarily. He could do many things that made me feel happy, but I didn’t like him. I was just moved sometimes.” Monica said to Finn and continued, “But if we can’t be together, I’ll probably be with Michael too.”

Finn glared at her.

“Are you angry?” Monica could sense the change in Finn’s mood.

That meant Finn actually liked her.

“If I can’t be with you, being with anyone else is the same,” Monica suddenly said very seriously.

Finn’s heartbeat skipped a beat.

He had never thought that Monica liked him so much.

He always thought that with Monica’s personality, she would not be so loyal to a relationship. After all, she liked to have fun, and she was so cheerful. It would be very simple for her to choose to give up on a relationship, unlike him, who could not let go no matter how hard he tried.

That year, when he saw Monica and Michael kissing, no one knew how uncomfortable he felt at that moment.

He really had to hold it in. Only then did he leave Monica and Michael and did not look for Monica after that.

In fact, he was also waiting for Monica to call him and for her to explain herself to him.

In the relationship, Monica had always taken the initiative, so if she did not take the initiative, it meant that she had given up on the relationship.

After waiting a long time, he thought she could truly let go if she wanted to.
