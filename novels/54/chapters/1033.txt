1034 The Honey Trap

Monica could not care less and helped Harry to the men’s bathroom, where Harry kneeled in front of a toilet bowl and vomited non-stop. He did not sound too good.

As such, she glanced at him before turning around to go out and wait for him.

Just as she was about to go out, she saw Nox.

With a cigarette in his mouth, Nox was unbuckling his belt and was about to come in to pee. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, when he saw a woman who was Monica, he was so scared that he peed his pants.

“Why are you here?” Nox was surprised.

“Do you think you’re the only one who can go to nightclubs?” Monica was also surprised for a second but quickly calmed herself down.

It was normal to meet Nox in a place like that. After all, when did Nox stop fooling around with women?

“F*ck, this is the men’s washroom!” Nox went out to confirm and then came in to yell at Monica.

“Can’t I prefer the men’s washroom?”

“You sure have a weird taste.” Nox cursed in a low voice.

After that, he walked straight to a men’s urinal and unzipped his pants.

“Why? Do you still want to watch?” Nox raised his brows.

Speechless, Monica stood up and was prepared to leave.

“Girl, help me up.” Harry’s legs were probably weak from kneeling, and that was why he called out to Monica.

Monica was stunned.

Meanwhile, Nox also turned his head to take a look.

“Come here. Help me up…” Harry tried to stand up from the toilet bowl, but he seemed to be in a lot of pain.

Monica did not say anything, but neither did she leave.

“Is he calling you?” Nox looked at Monica.

Monica smiled and replied, “Yes.”

Then, she walked straight to Harry and helped him up with great effort.

“Monica, your taste is really weird!”

Monica pretended not to hear him and helped Harry out of the bathroom.

Nox quickly took out his phone and took a picture of their backs. While peeing, he sent a message to Finn. “Monica has fallen.”

At that moment, Finn was preparing to get off work.

Gary’s condition needed time, and he could not solve much even if he kept watch of Gary. He could only use the conventional treatment method first, and when Gary’s physical condition stabilized a little, he would contact some overseas experts to specially treat Gary’s condition.

Hence, he packed his things and was about to leave the hospital. After all, sleeping in the office was not comfortable.

The moment he got up, he saw a message and a photo from Nox.

In the photo, Monica was with a man. The man’s entire weight was on her, and she seemed to be struggling to help the man leave.

“Judging from his age, I think he should be old enough to be Monica’s father.” Nox continued to text.

Finn just stared at the picture intently.

“Anyway, I think Monica has changed.” Since Nox did not receive a reply from Finn, he kept sending Finn messages.

Finn put down his phone.

He believed that it was Monica’s business, and since he did not like gossip anyway, there was no need to discuss anything with Nox.

…

Monica helped Harry into the car. After making sure that Steve and a bargirl were following her, she was a little more relieved.

In the car, Harry was getting a little impatient.

“Let’s get to the hotel first. The driver’s here…” Monica declined.

She really hated Harry touching her.

However, Harry smiled lewdly and asked, “You’re in this line of work, but why are you so shy?”

“Do you hate it, Harry?” Monica pouted on purpose.

“I like it. I like it very much. That’s why I can’t wait.”

“No…”

It was not easy for Monica to keep herself from being taken advantage of in the car.

Old perverts like that may look like a gentleman on the surface, but deep down, they were promiscuous.

Monica helped Harry to the hotel, and the two checked into a room.

Following behind Monica, Steve also brought the bargirl along and checked into a room.

When he saw Harry’s lecherous actions, he really wanted to take Monica away several times. However, he stopped himself.

After helping Harry into the hotel room, Monica purposely left the door open for them.

Harry was still feeling a little sick from being drunk, so he lay on the bed to rest.

Monica hurriedly came out of the room and asked the bargirl, “Where’s the pill?”

“It’s here,” the bargirl quickly said.

“Is it fast?”

“It’s the fastest,” the bargirl replied.

“Alright.” Monica instructed, “Wait for me at the door for a moment.”
