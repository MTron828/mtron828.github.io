Chapter 94: A Small Victory

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She smiled and said, “Since Mr. Hall doesn’t want to pursue the matter, I don’t think there’s a need to.”

Cameron Hall heaved a sigh of relief.

Although he looked confident, he still felt guilty. He was still afraid that Jeanne Lawrence would cause a ruckus and that he would make a mistake.

Luckily, Eden Swan was smart enough to know that Jeanne would definitely not fall out with him in public. If she did, she would only leave a bad impression on MUK. Jeanne Lawrence was smart enough to tolerate it. Otherwise, MUK wouldn’t choose such an unreasonable person to work with.

If Jeanne Lawrence couldn’t find anything to use against him, the result would always be a crushing defeat no matter how much of a fuss she made.

It was absolutely impossible for Eden Swan to be caught red-handed.

Therefore, Cameron would definitely win today’s proposal.

Thinking up to this point, Cameron Hall’s smile became even brighter.

“With two proposals being so similar, who would Mr. West choose between us?” Jeanne asked West.

West looked at the two proposals. “I haven’t been in Harken for long,” he said. “I don’t know enough about either of your companies. Of course, I’m not going to judge emotionally on who I’ll choose. It’s business, after all.”

That was directed at Jeanne Lawrence.

Jeanne nodded while Cameron chuckled in secret.

“However, the proposals from both companies are evenly matched. It’s very difficult to make a decision. The only thing that I can judge upon is your investment amount. As such, that will be the key to who I’ll choose today,” West said solemnly.

Cameron became even more excited.

Eden Swan had added another 100 million yuan to the original 2 billion yuan proposal to create a gap between the the Lawrences’s proposal and their company’s proposal. Eden was able to hit the nail on the head. He was a formidable man indeed. Cameron would need to work harder to curry favor with him.

With that thought in mind, Cameron Hall heard West say solemnly, “I choose the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“What?!” Cameron Hall could not believe it. He thought he had misheard.

He was no longer confident.

“Lawrence Enterprise.” West repeated again. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Why?” Cameron Hall could not remain calm. “Mr. West, you just said that this is a business decision, but now you’re biased. Isn’t this too much? If Mr. West decided on Lawrence Enterprise and Ms. Lawrence, why did you waste everyone’s time? You should have announced to the public that this project was reserved for Ms. Lawrence. It’s well-known that Mr. West and Ms. Lawrence is involved with each other. Aren’t you just toying with the other companies? As the person in charge of MUK, is this not tasteless?”

“Why do you think I’m siding with Jeanne Lawrence?” West asked, his face darkening.

Cameron Hall angrily picked up Jeanne’s proposal. He had read it casually so he had not read the details. He flipped to the page with the investment amount and pointed at the number and exclaimed, “Lawrence Enterprise’s investment amount is 2.2…”

Cameron Hall was stunned.

‘Wait, 2.2 billion?!

‘Wasn’t it 2 billion? How is it 2.2 billion?’

He looked at the number in disbelief.

At that moment, Cameron was completely stunned and he could not regain his composure for a long time.

Jeanne sneered.

West smiled. “Do you have any objections, Mr. Hall?”

Cameron Hall did not answer for a long time. He was thoroughly embarrassed.

West did not wait for his answer. He said, “I hereby announce that MUK’s e-commerce partner in Harken will be Lawrence Enterprise. The Lawrence Enterprise will enjoy MUK’s exclusive partnership rights in Harken.”

Jeanne Lawrence smiled. “Thank you, Godfather.”

West held out his hand. “Looking forward to working together.”

“Definitely.”

The two of them had successfully reached an agreement.

Meanwhile, Cameron Hall was stuck trying to process the outcome. He was thinking about how he would report this to Eden Swan.

“Mr. Hall, thank you for your participation. I hope we can work together next time,” West said politely.

Cameron forced himself to smile. He muttered a few words and left.

Jeanne looked at Cameron Hall’s back.

She turned to West and said, “I won’t disturb you anymore, Godfather. I’ll go back and prepare our contract.”

West nodded.

With that, Jeanne left with Forrest Jackson.
