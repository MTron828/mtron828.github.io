All she wanted was to help Michael.

Once he got everything he needed, she did not need to feel emotionally burdened.

Finn said, “Monica, let me tell you one more time. If you choose to help Michael in this way, it means you will always be with Michael. Once something happens between you and Michael, the media will not let it go, and you will not be able to leave. You will be with Michael for the rest of your life! If that’s the case, do you still choose to be with Michael?”

“Since Michael promised he would sort out his matters, he will definitely do it. I believe in him, and he will not lie to me!”

“He will not lie to you, huh?” Finn thought it was ironic.

He originally thought Monica really loved him very much, so she would listen to whatever he said.

However, it turned out that no matter how much she loved him, nothing he said could ever compare to Michael.

In her heart, whatever Michael said was true, but not Finn.

“In that case,” Finn said coldly to Monica, “If you choose to be with Michael, our relationship will be over. Do you still want to do it?”

Monica looked at Finn, dumbfounded. Even after a long time, she could not find the words to say.

Finn repeated what he said before. “If you choose to be with Michael, our divorce will be real. I won’t wait for you.”

Monica’s eyes were red.

She bit her lips and looked straight at Finn, saying, “Why do you have to force me?”

Force her? Was he forcing her?

He said, “Yes, I’m forcing you. I’m forcing you to make a decision.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Finn, you have never understood my pain. Agreeing to help Michael also pains me because I know it’s unfair to you, but I’ve been thinking about how to make it fair to you. Yet, have you thought about me at all? Have you ever thought about how much pain I would feel if something happened to Michael because I didn’t help him?”

“Make it fair to me? How are you going to do that? You want me to divorce you, watch you love another man, and wait for you until the end of time? Monica, all you can think about right now is what Michael is going through. But have you ever thought about what will happen to me after you divorce me? Do I have to pretend to be pitiful to gain your sympathy?” The sarcasm in Finn’s tone was obvious. “Are you a saint?”

Monica’s eyes were red as she looked at Finn.

She only wanted to help others. Why was Finn insulting her?

Was it wrong for her to be nice to others?

“Did you say you love me because you sympathize with me? Because I saved you and almost died, so it triggered your saint-like heart? Was that why you said you liked me and wanted to be with me again? Now that someone else needs you to be a saint for them, you won’t hesitate to help him, huh? Monica, how can you be so selfless?”

“Finn, that’s enough!” Monica yelled at Finn as his words had upset her. She did not expect Finn to mock her and hurt her deeply.

She was helping Michael, but why did he have to make her feel ashamed for doing so?

Why was he trampling on her pride like that?

“Monica, I won’t agree to it. As I said, I won’t agree to divorce you and then wait for you until whenever. Either you choose to separate from Michael and not interfere in his affairs, or we can get a real divorce. Then, I will never be together with you again. Even if all the women in the world die, I will never be together with you!” Finn sounded determined.

At that moment, her eyes seemed to have turned scarlet.

“Why do you have to say that, Finn?” Monica was on the verge of breaking down.

In fact, she felt terrible.

“Why do you have to do this? Why won’t you believe me just this once? I said I will return to you, and I will keep my word. Why don’t you believe me?”

“I don’t believe Michael!” Finn shouted, “I refuse to believe he will let you go!”

“Finn, Michael isn’t the person you think he is. Don’t think so badly of him!”

“I’m bad?” Finn said fiercely, “He’s a good person, and I’m the bad one. That’s why I don’t want to help him. That’s why I won’t let you help him this way! No matter what happens to him in the end, that’s his own business. It has nothing to do with me and us!”
