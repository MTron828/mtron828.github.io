1229 Learning To Forget About Each Other

“Have you slept with Monica?” Jeanne guessed correctly.

Although she was not sure, she could tell from Finn’s expression.

“That’s good.” Jeanne smiled faintly.

Monica, that silly girl, had finally found her place.

She reckoned that the two of them should have learned to cherish each other even more after experiencing so much. Now, she did not have to worry about them breaking up again.

“What about Nox?” After showing concern for Monica’s happiness, she had to show some concern for Nox.

Finn was preparing the equipment to draw her blood as he replied, “He’s recovering quite quickly. I went to see him two days ago, and he could stand on his own.”

“So soon?” Jeanne was pleasantly surprised.

At that moment, the corners of her mouth curled up into a big smile.

Edward glanced at her smile. It had been a long time since he had seen Jeanne smile so brightly.

It was not a perfunctory reply but a sincere one.

“Yes, that’s why I believed him when he said he could come running to see me in a month,” Finn said. His chat with Jeanne seemed very natural. “Nox can really create miracles.”

“Indeed, people who are all brawn and no brains are luckier,” Jeanne commented, agreeing with Finn’s point of view.

Finn also nodded. At that moment, he had already prepared the equipment for blood transfusion and walked to Jeanne. “Roll up your sleeves.”

Jeanne did as she was told.

Finn tied a tourniquet around Jeanne’s arm.

“Fourth Master,” Finn suddenly called out to Edward.

“Yes.”

“Come over and help me,” Finn said.

Edward walked over. “With what?”

“Hold Jeanne for me. I’m afraid she’ll faint.”

“I’m not scared of blood,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“That’s hard to say.” Finn said, “Pregnant women are completely different from ordinary women.”

“I’ve drawn blood so many times when I was pregnant, but I didn’t feel nauseated from the sight of blood.”

“Women in the later stage of pregnancy are also different from ordinary pregnant women.”

Jeanne was speechless. He should just say that he wanted to her and Edward to get along.

Was it because Finn’s relationship had been in a good relationship recently that he was acting on impulse?

Jeanne did not say anything else.

She felt that she had to satisfy Finn sometimes. After all, it was rare for Finn to be so proud of himself, so she should not dampen his spirits.

Jeanne remained silent at that moment, which meant that she tacitly agreed.

Only then did Edward really sit beside her. Then, he gently hugged her body.

Finn glanced at them and then began to draw Jeanne’s blood seriously. The moment the needle was inserted into the blood vessel, it still hurt a little.

Jeanne closed her eyes.

Finn said, “I’m more careful when I give you an injection than when I give Monica an injection.”

“As if.” Jeanne did not believe him.

“At most, I’m just as careful.” Finn compromised and then said with a smile, “I don’t want Fourth Master’s heart to ache.”

Jeanne smiled.

In fact, there was no need for that now since they were learning to forget each other.

She was learning to forget about her feelings for him so that she did not miss this world so much in the last moments of her life, and he was learning to forget his feelings for her to make him accept it better and reduce his reluctance to part with her. It would even make him accept another relationship faster.

“It’s done,” Finn finished drawing her blood.

He pressed the cotton swab on Jeanne’s vein, and just as Jeanne was about to take it from him, he said, ” Fourth Master, press on it.”

Edward took the cotton swab and pressed it on the injection site to prevent bleeding.

As Finn kept her blood away, he said, “You’re eight months in now, which means you’re in the later stage of pregnancy. Although very few babies are born in this stage, some premature babies are born at about eight months. So, you have to pay special attention to the baby now.”

“Alright.” Jeanne nodded.

“Do you feel unwell anywhere?” Finn asked.

“I’m fine, but I’ve been going to the toilet more often recently. Sometimes, I’ll get up seven or eight times a night.”

“Because the baby is too big now, it’s normal to have pressure on the bladder. However, you must be careful when you get up at night. Your stomach is big now, and it’s not convenient to get up. Moreover, getting up at night in a daze is very dangerous in itself.” Finn reminded her. Then, he turned to Edward and said, “Fourth Master, try to accompany her to the toilet at night. The hospital has received cases of people falling, which causes preterm labor, and being born prematurely is not good for the baby. It’s best to avoid it if possible.”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
