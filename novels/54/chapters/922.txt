923 Another Accident, Gary’s Illness Acts Up

Lucy did not reply, and Kingsley did not say another word.

When the plane landed on Delta Island, all assassins went back to their places. Melinda remained by Kingsley’s side while Lucy returned to her room.

Lucy turned to look at Jeanne as she walked into Lucy’s room.

Jeanne said, “I think you were a little irrational when you dealt with Melinda’s matter.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jeanne had not said a word on the plane. This was not because she did not want to help Lucy but because she wanted to see Lucy’s attitude toward Melinda.

To be honest, she had never taken little Melinda seriously. She did not think this woman would influence Lucy’s image in the Hills, nor Kingsley’s heart. However, Lucy had let Melinda have her way.

“I’m tired,” Lucy said. She was tired of Kingsley.

“So, you’re just going to let Melinda do whatever she wants?” Jeanne said.

“Isn’t that your uncle’s choice?” Lucy said sarcastically.

In Jeanne’s opinion, Kingsley was only angry because Lucy fell for Melinda’s trick. Kingsley was a cunning old fox. There was no way he could not see through Melinda’s thoughts.

Though he had been helping Melinda because Lucy had indeed crossed the line. Some rules and principles could not be violated in the Hills, and killing assassins was intolerable in the Hills. Moreover, Kingsley also needed to have prestige. This was another reason why Jeanne chose to remain silent regarding Lucy and Melinda.

Everyone knew she was Kingsley’s niece. So she could throw away her identity as an assassin and behave atrociously with him, and no one would feel as if Kingsley’s power was threatened. However, Lucy could not do that. She was an assassin, and an assassin would never have the right to disobey Kingsley and the Hills. The Hills had to have absolute control over them, and she would not disregard Kingsley’s status to protect Lucy.

She also had her own selfish motives. In the end, Kingsley was her uncle, and she would not do anything to threaten him. However, she did not want to see Lucy put up with Melinda.

It was obvious Melinda did not have Lucy’s breadth of mind, nor did not look at the bigger picture. If she stayed by Kingsley’s side, it would be easy for her to ruin the Hills’ plans for personal reasons. Even though Kingsley would not let Melinda be, she selfishly felt that Lucy was more suitable for him.

Moreover, she had a feeling that Kingsley wanted Lucy to return to his side. However, Kingsley was still Kingsley, and as the head of the Hills, his identity and status mattered. He could not put any assassins in a short position. Thus, Lucy had to take the initiative. If not, Kingsley would never ask her to return to his side.

This was the conflict between the two of them. Now, she finally understood what Melinda was trying to do and needed to help Kingsley. Even if Kingsley’s actions at times were truly chilling.

“I don’t think you should suffer like this,” Jeanne said. “Melinda shouldn’t be your match.”

“So what do you think I should do? Take the initiative to express my goodwill to Kingsley?” Lucy sneered. “Kingsley would never have feelings for any woman.”

“He can’t, but can you? Do you have feelings for any man?” Jeanne retorted.

Lucy’s eyes flickered.

“You never know when you’re going to die in the Hills,” Jeanne said indifferently. “Who can really devote their feelings to another? In fact, there have been feelings between assassins. However, in all these years, no assassin in the Hills has made a mistake because of it. Everyone knows that in the face of life and death, feelings are worthless.”

“What are you trying to say?” Lucy looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne said, “I’m just telling you that we’re all living on the edge. That’s a fact no one can change. Rather than sulking until death, it’s better to let oneself live a more comfortable life. To put it bluntly, just because you put up with Melinda doesn’t mean she will do the same with you. I think we both know what kind of person she is after spending so much time together. Do you really want to be played to death by her?”
