1040 Pushed To The Limit

The director was stunned as he did not expect that Monica would suddenly bring that up.

Finn was also a little surprised.

At that moment, Monica was really busy with business.

He did not know how Monica was at work lately, but at that moment, he seemed to have realized something.

“Why? Is it a little difficult for you, director?”

“I won’t hide it from you. Ever since there was a problem with your company’s drugs, the higher-ups have made us use all products from Sunny Pharmaceutical. There are still a lot of products left, and we have everything we need, so it doesn’t make sense for me to ask the procurement department to purchase more. Besides, the hospital has its own standards for purchasing, and I don’t have the final say.” It was an obvious rejection.

However, Monica just stared at the director and did not reply.

Feeling a little embarrassed, the director said, “How about this? I’ll use up Sunny Pharmaceutical’s drugs first, and when I’ve used up a certain amount, I promise to buy Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs. What do you think?”

It was obvious that he was deliberately trying to fool Monica.

The old Monica might have believed him because she did not think that people were evil and that he would do what he had promised.

However, not anymore. She had a prejudiced perception toward everyone.

She said, “No. You need to restock immediately.”

“Aren’t you making things difficult for me?”

“I can give you a discount. We’ll distribute three months’ worth of products to you, and you can settle the payment once a month. I can also give you a 20 percent discount on the purchase price.”

“It’s really not up to me to decide.” The hospital director was out in a difficult position, and he looked like he had no choice.

“If that’s the case, I’ll have to make a big deal out of my father’s matter.”

“Ms. Cardellini.” The director looked helpless.

“I heard that the hospital is conducting an international hospital evaluation recently. According to the current situation, your hospital can enter the top 30 in the world from the top 50 last year. However, I wonder if your hospital will fall out of the top 100 if I expose this hospital’s major medical malpractice to the world evaluation committee.”

“Ms. Cardellini, aren’t you a little too heartless?” The director was clearly a little angry. “This medical accident has little to do with our hospital. To put it in an extreme way, it’s a natural disaster. I’m afraid it’s a little unreasonable of you to push all the blame on our hospital.”

“Whether it’s a natural or man-made disaster, I think it should be the evaluation committee’s decision, not you or me.”

“Ms. Cardellini!”

“This is my condition in exchange for the compensation.” Monica did not want to waste too much time on this. “I’ll give you one day to think about it. If you don’t agree, I’ll really make a big deal out of this matter! If it blows up, will it affect the hospital’s reputation? You’ll have to reevaluate.”

As she spoke, she planned to leave with Steve.

“Ms. Cardellini!” the director called out to her angrily. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Monica turned her head around.

“I need to report this to my superiors. I really can’t make the decision.”

“I know. That’s why I’m giving you a day. I’ll come to you at this time tomorrow.”

After that, she left with Steve.

The moment the office door closed, the director looked at Finn and said, “Can you attribute that incident to a medical accident so that our hospital is not responsible for it?”

“In fact, we are responsible for it. The specialist doctor was hired by our hospital, and during the surgery, it was because he fainted that the surgery failed. If the Cardellinis pursue the matter, our hospital will not be able to shirk from responsibility.”

The director’s expression was visibly much more solemn now.

“There has never been a successful case of heart transplant surgery in our hospital. Now, with medical malpractice, it’ll affect our cardiology department very badly. If the matter gets blown up, I’m afraid it’ll be hard for anyone to choose our cardiology department in the future. I think you can consider Monica’s suggestion.”

“I’d like to consider it too, and I can’t wait to settle this matter, but the higher-ups don’t agree. When they said they wanted to withdraw from purchasing Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs, I actually suggested it. However, their answer was that I had to carry out the orders from the higher-ups. If I were to suggest this to them now, wouldn’t they think that I’m insensible?”

“The situation then was different from now. Just tell them that if we don’t meet Cardellini Enterprise’s requirements, our hospital will face the danger of falling in the world ranking. If they think it’s alright, we won’t have to be threatened by Monica. If they can’t accept it, the higher-ups will tell you what to do.” Finn gave the director a suggestion. “You must report this matter to the superiors. If we delay this issue and anything happens, our hospital won’t be able to bear the consequences.”
