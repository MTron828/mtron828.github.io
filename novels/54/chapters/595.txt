Chapter 596: Jonathan’s Fate, The Cold-blooded Lawrence Family

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne smiled and did not seem to mind.

After that, she chatted for a while longer in Jonathan’s study.

When she left the room, Alexander’s family of three was still in the living room as if they were purposely waiting for her.

Alexander said fiercely to Jeanne, “Jeanne, you’re getting a little lawless now!”

“Isn’t that the power grandpa gave me?”

“You!”

Jeanne walked in front of them casually. “Just now, grandpa agreed with my decision. He even said I’m more courageous than the two of you.”

“What are you so proud of?”

“He said that the Lawrences still need a useful person to support them. But...” Jeanne sized up Alexander and Joshua with a somewhat disdainful gaze. “He’s very disappointed in the two of you.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Having been ridiculed, Alexander raised his arm.

Jeanne looked at him and said, “Are you sure you want to hit me?”

Alexander was stunned by what Jeanne said.

Jeanne sneered. “If you’re incapable, just admit it. If you treat me better, I wouldn’t have to fight with you for anything.”

“So you admit that you want to snatch what’s mine?” Flustered, Joshua suddenly interrupted. At that moment, he was furious.

Jeanne glanced at Joshua. “Snatch what’s yours?”

“That’s right. You want to snatch what’s supposed to be mine!” Joshua said fiercely.

“Do you think you’re worthy of it?” Jeanne was sarcastic.

Under Jeanne’s gaze, Joshua felt that he was useless for a second.

In front of Jeanne, he was useless and could not withstand a single blow.

He was so furious that he lost control, dashing over to Jeanne and wanting to push Jeanne down.

Jeanne dodged it just by moving her body a little. Although she avoided Joshua’s brute force, she still fell to the ground on purpose.

Her eyes watered, and she looked pitiful. “Joshua, what did I do wrong for you to treat me like this? Is it wrong for grandpa to like me now?”

Joshua was confused for a second.

Even though he used all his strength to push her, it was clear that he missed. Yet, why did Jeanne suddenly fall to the ground?

Moreover, the way she fell to the ground was visibly different from her usual arrogant manner.

What tricks was Jeanne playing?

Before he could figure it out, he heard Jonathan’s stern voice from the second floor. “Joshua, are you rebelling against me now?”

Startled, Joshua shuddered as he raised his head and saw his grandfather standing there with a stern expression.

At that moment, Jonathan was getting the maid to push him out of the elevator.

When Joshua saw his grandfather’s serious expression, he could not help but feel afraid.

Hence, he quickly explained, “No, grandpa. Jeanne fell down by herself. I didn’t even touch her–”

“I was standing just fine. Why would I make myself fall? Joshua, can’t you just admit what you’ve done? Are you even a man?” Jeanne complained to Joshua.

By then, Jonathan’s personal servant had stepped forward to help Jeanne up.

Jeanne seemed to be in great pain, and her brows were furrowed tightly.

“I really didn’t. I pushed her, but she dodged. I really didn’t touch her. If you don’t believe me, you can ask my mom and dad if I touched her,” Joshua explained anxiously.

He probably wanted to clear his name.

“Dad and Mother have always been on your side,” Jeanne muttered.

It was that seemingly unintentional sentence that made Jenifer and Alexander, who had planned to defend their son, keep quiet.

Seeing that the two of them did not speak, Joshua became even more nervous. He kept saying, “I really didn’t push Jeanne. She’s putting on a show in front of you to frame me. Jeanne, why are you so evil? Do you want to see our family in shambles?”

“Joshua, you can do whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want. Am I the one putting the family in shambles, or have you guys been ostracizing me? I think I’ve done enough for the Lawrences. What right do you have to say such things about me? Do you really want me to completely break away from the family and cut off all contact with you guys?” Jeanne was extremely aggrieved, “Just now, you even said I stole what belonged to you. What did I steal from you?”

“Stop talking nonsense. When did I say you took my things? It’s clear that you’re deliberately trying to sow discord. Grandpa, I’m innocent. Jeanne’s trying to drive a wedge between us. She doesn’t have good intentions–”
