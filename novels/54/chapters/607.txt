Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It silenced everyone present.

Old Master Evans was utterly stunned by the slap.

He looked at Finn in disbelief that the b*stard, who came out of nowhere, had hit him.

The slap was not too hard.

After all, Old Master Evans was more than 70 years old. If Finn did not control how hard he slapped, he might kill Old Master Evans.

The slap was only meant to embarrass Old Man Evans in front of everyone instead of hurting him.

Old Master Evans was so angry that he could not calm down. At that moment, Old Master Evans’s son and daughter-in-law could no longer sit idly and watch. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

They went forward and wanted to fight with Finn.

Just then, a deep and stern voice echoed in the entire hall!

“Who said George was a b*stard?”

Everyone turned their heads and looked in the direction of the door, only to see Old Master Swan and Wade there!

At least for ten years, no one had ever seen Old Master Swan show up in other public places. Apart from the Swans’ banquets, Old Master Swan had never attended any other events. Now that he suddenly showed up in the Lawrences’ hall, it was pretty surprising.

The Evans’ originally imposing manner was suppressed because of Old Master Swan’s sudden appearance.

When George saw Old Master Swan, he immediately ran over and hugged Old Master Swan’s thigh while crying. “Grandpa, someone hit me.”

Old Master Swan’s expression was cold as he squatted down and looked at George.

“What happened?” Old Master Swan asked George gently.

That made the others tremble in fear.

Those familiar with Old Master Swan knew he had never been so gentle to anyone!

George looked very aggrieved. “That grandpa over there pushed me to the ground, and my butt hurt from the fall.”

Old Master Swan glanced at Old Master Evans. Then, he looked back at George and used his hand to rub George’s little butt. “Here?”

“Yes.” George nodded and said somewhat exaggeratedly, “It’s swollen.”

At that moment, Old Master Swan was amused by George.

The smile, however, made the others even more... shocked.

Old Master Swan touched George’s head before standing up, holding George’s hand, and walking toward Old Master Evans.

Old Master Evans looked at Old Master Swan and was still lacking confidence.

He gritted his teeth. “Old Master Swan, I didn’t want to hit him. He was the one who came forward and bit me out of the blue. Look at my thigh. There are bloody marks from his bite.”

As Old Master Evans spoke, he rolled up his pants, and sure enough, there was a bloody mark.

Yet, Old Master Swan smiled.

Everyone saw it, even if the smile disappeared a second later.

Was it a joke to him?!

Old Master Evans’ expression darkened. “Old Master Swan, George was at fault first. Otherwise, do you think that at my age, I would be haggling with a little brat?”

“Grandpa, I bit him because he scolded my mother and said that my mother was rude!” George complained.

Old Master Swan’s expression turned ugly again. He looked coldly at Old Master Evans, who quickly explained, “Mr. Lawrence just passed away, and Jeanne has been acting unruly at home. I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I stepped forward and said a few words. You don’t know how arrogant Jeanne was just now. I also said a few words from the perspective of an elder.”

“Jeanne is my daughter-in-law. I know very well what kind of character she is. There’s no need for you to teach her a lesson.” Old Master Swan was obviously protecting Jeanne.

Old Master Evans wanted to say something, but he was intimidated by Old Master Swan.

“Even if no one can say anything about your daughter-in-law, the fact that George bit my father is your fault. And even if my father pushed George away, it’s normal. Moreover, my father was slapped by this kid beside him. No matter how highly respected you are, Old Master Swan, you can’t just rely on your own power to do whatever you want!” Old Master Evans’ son, Shane Evans, roared in dissatisfaction.

“So what do you propose?” Old Master Swan was now hostile.

Shane immediately trembled in fear, but he bit the bullet and said, “No matter what, we should at least make George apologize.”

In the end, he was still a coward, afraid of offending the Swans, but he wanted to restore his family’s dignity.

George hugged Old Master Swan’s thigh tightly and said unwillingly, “I won’t apologize. I didn’t do anything wrong. He bullied my mother, so I bit him, and he hit me. My butt is so swollen that I can’t even sit.”

George’s dramatics made Jeanne feel a little…
