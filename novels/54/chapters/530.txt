“Finn, let’s get a divorce,” Monica said seriously. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Finn simply looked at her coldly, and his lack of reaction was scary.

Monica quickly said, “It’s a temporary divorce. Michael’s current situation requires me to help him restore his image. Once outsiders know that we’ve been divorced for a long time and that I’m in a normal relationship with him, he’ll be able to rebuild his image and get everything that belongs to him. As long as he’s on the right track, we’ll be together again.”

Monica explained to Finn seriously, hoping that Finn could understand her.

She believed that it was only a matter of time before she would return to Finn’s side and be together with him.

“Monica, you don’t take me seriously, do you?” Finn asked.

Monica was stunned.

Finn said, “I said you absolutely can’t help Michael by being together with him. Have you forgotten about it so quickly?”

“I just–”

“I don’t agree with it,” Finn answered confidently.

“But I don’t have a choice now. Michael’s mother has told the reporters today that I’m in a relationship with Michael. If I refute them now, it’ll be the end of Michael’s career. The media will even use his mother’s words to slander Michael even more. Finn, if I’m the reason Michael loses his reputation and everything that belongs to him, I will feel very guilty,” Monica said emotionally.

Finn, on the other hand, became even colder. He sneered. “Guilty?”

“Michael is a good person. He shouldn’t have to suffer everything that’s happening to him now.”

“He’s a good person, so I’m that despicable villain, huh?” Finn glared at Monica.

“That’s not what I mean. What I mean is that if I can help Michael, why wouldn’t I help him? If I just let him be, I will never be able to be with you in peace. Even if we were to be together, I wouldn’t be happy. I would still think of Michael–”

“Monica,” Finn interrupted her. “If Michael is considerate of you, he wouldn’t have used such a method to make things difficult for you!”

“He didn’t. I was the one who offered to help him. He had never thought of asking me for help. He wanted to solve it himself, but now, no one else other than me can help him resolve the issue. Finn, with Michael’s ability, it won’t take long for him to regain his position in the political scene. By then, we can be together again. Okay?” Monica asked cautiously, with anticipation written across her face.

She admitted she was selfish, and she knew it was unfair to Finn.

However, she could not let Michael be, especially since she was the only one who could help him. She could not bring herself to turn a blind eye to it.

She actually knew very well that if Michael lost everything because of her, she would never be able to live happily with Finn.

There would always be a knot in her heart that she would never be able to let go of.

Rather than being tormented by her feelings, it was better to settle everything once and for all so that she could be with Finn without any burden.

“Monica, have you thought about how long it would take for Michael to regain his position?” Finn asked her coldly.

“I believe in Michael’s ability.”

“How long will it take?” Finn asked her aggressively. “One year, two years, or ten years? This is the political and not the business scene. Do you understand politics? If you agree to be together with Michael now, the entire country will know that you’re together. Do you think you can separate? Once you do, it’ll hurt his reputation again. It’s an endless cycle. Do you really think that you can really separate from him? As I said, once you compromise, you’ll do it again.”

“I won’t!” Monica told Finn firmly. “I believe in Michael. He promised me that he would settle his matters as quickly as possible, and I believe he will be able to do it!”

“Yes, you believe in him, but you never believe in me.”

Monica was stunned.

“If you believed me, you wouldn’t have agreed to Michael’s request.”

Monica bit her lip.

It was not that she did not believe Finn. She just had no other choice.
