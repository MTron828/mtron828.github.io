854 Monica’s Extreme Counterattack, a Struggle Between Life and Death

Jeanne’s expression darkened.

Melinda explained, “I thought Lucy was dead. Since this room was the closest to Mr. Hill’s, I moved in. It was more convenient for me to take care of him this way, and Mr. Hill agreed.”

The truth was that once, when they were in bed, she had said she wanted to stay in a room closer to him. Even though she did not state it was Lucy’s room she was hoping for, Kingsley had responded with it.

Jeanne really felt that Kingsley was a scumbag. He was the worst scum among men to everyone other than her in this world.

“I’m fine staying anywhere,” Lucy said.

Now that Melinda was taking care of Kingsley’s daily needs, it was understandable she was staying next door to him. She had nothing to fight for anyway. Kingsley was not someone they could snatch.

Jeanne gave Melinda a cold look before helping Lucy to the next empty room.

After assisting Lucy onto the bed, she asked the Hills’ private doctor to treat Lucy’s wounds. As Jeanne watched on from the side, she noticed there were many more traces of blood on her scarred body.

Kingsley really was cruel. How could he hurt Lucy, who had been so loyal to him, to this extent?

Lucy fell into a deep sleep once her wounds had been treated. Perhaps it was because she was too weak.

Jeanne left her room and went straight to Kingsley’s room.

When she knocked on the door and entered, Melinda was in Kingsley’s room, carefully feeding him.

Jeanne took a look and said bluntly, “I took Lucy out.”

“Mm,” Kingsley replied as if he knew.

“If the elders of the Hills want to hold you accountable, I’ll take responsibility.”

“No need,” Kingsley said. “I’ll explain to them.”

“If you were willing to explain, then why were you still torturing Yu Jiayi?!” Jeanne was a little angry.

Clearly, Kingsley could do it. Even though it went against his principles, it would not have been difficult for him. However, he had no feelings for Lucy.

“Jeanne, remember this. We’re a family of assassins. A life is as cheap as grass to us. I don’t have to break my principles for anyone. The reason why I allowed you to bring Lucy out was because we didn’t find any clues even after interrogating her for half a month. So we can now temporarily believe that Lucy didn’t betray us.” Kingsley said indifferently, “It’s not that I’ve turned soft.”

“You really are the greatest leader of the Hills.” Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“Thank you for your high praise.”

Kingsley stared at Jeanne’s back as she turned to leave, his expression still a little unsightly.

Melinda, who stood beside him, chimed in, “Eldest Young Lady seems to be on good terms with Lucy. She even taught me a lesson just now.”

Kingsley’s face turned cold. “If Jeanne wants to teach you a lesson, you’d better listen!”

“I didn’t mean it that way. I only meant…” Melinda was horrified. “I didn’t mean to blame Eldest Young Lady.”

“Get out!” Kingsley did not seem in a good mood.

Melinda gritted her teeth. Now she knew that Jeanne was untouchable. She was clearly Kingsley’s soft spot, and it was the kind that should not be provoked at all.

…

South Hampton City.

Monica felt that she needed to work harder. While the tolerance of the modern population might be very high, there had to be a bottom line. She picked up her phone and dialed a number. “Elsa.”

“What’s wrong? Are you going out again? It just so happens that everyone was left unsatisfied last night. My five young hunks were extremely disappointed after you left yesterday. Shall we continue tonight?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“See you there at 8 p.m. as usual,” Monica promised.

“Alright,” Elsa said excitedly.

Monica hung up the phone. She really had to give her all tonight!

As darkness fell onto the city, Monica and Elsa were drinking in a corner of the hall once more. Elsa had been urging Monica to dance, but Monica ignored her.

“Why are you so quiet today? Go on!” Elsa shouted. “Get on that stage and show them your charm.”

“No thanks.”

“Then what are you here for?” Elsa frowned. “Wasn’t it for someone to expose your dance in front of everyone again? You may not know, but the video of you dancing yesterday has spread throughout Harken. I heard so many people talking about you in the pantry at work today, saying how explosive your body was, or that your body was simply too soft. I swear they even drooled. I think that any man would be very lucky to sleep with you.”
