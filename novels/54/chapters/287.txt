Chapter 288: George Is “Abused”, and Jeanne Returns

Nox was convinced by George at that moment.

No matter how he looked at it, he felt that Edward had suffered a huge loss.

It felt like he had lost everything.

This was awkward! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Nox felt that Fourth Master Swan was extremely awkward at the moment.

He reckoned that Edward had never been tricked like this in his entire life.

Nox looked at Fourth Master Swan.

He was very curious about how he would answer the little brat.

It was silent for a while.

George was a patient person. After he finished talking about his deal, he waited quietly for Edward’s reply.

There was no sound.

While there was a stalemate, Nox’s phone rang again.

He quickly picked it up.

At this moment, he even put it on speakerphone.

Since it was about Jeanne, he did not want to trouble himself to pass on the message afterward.

The person who called was extremely respectful. “Young Master Winter.”

“Speak.”

“Jeanne has boarded the plane.”

“...” Nox turned his head to look at Edward.

So, she really left.

Was it because she was certain that Edward would not do anything to George, or was it just as George had said, where one more or less child would not matter to her?!

“Okay, I got it.”

Nox hung up the phone.

After hanging up the phone, he could not help but say, “She’s really gone.”

Edward’s expression was very ugly.

“I’m guessing that Jeanne was certain that you wouldn’t do anything to George. Perhaps she’s more than happy for you to raise her son for her,” Nox mocked Edward.

Edward gave him a look.

Nox was speaking the truth.

When it came to torturing Fourth Master Swan, Ms. Lawrence could always do it well.

“Fourth Master, please agree to my deal,” George said, “Don’t have any hope for my mom.”

“Alright.” Edward suddenly agreed.

After all, George was still young.

When he heard Edward agree to his deal, he smiled.

He looked quite good when he smiled.

No wonder Jeanne was so sure that Fourth Master Swan would not do anything to George.

Edward could not do anything to such a child even if he wanted to!

“Nox, bring a laptop over,” Edward instructed.

Nox quickly went upstairs to get a laptop.

To be honest, he was also very curious about how talented George was.

The last time Nox heard about George’s ability from the principal of Angerburg Private Elementary School, he was very excited. In the end, he did not remember anything. He only knew that the brat was very powerful. Today, he wanted to see how powerful he was.

Nox quickly carried the laptop downstairs and placed it in front of George.

George knelt on the coffee table in front of him and turned on the laptop.

The laptop was password-protected.

George did not ask for the password at all. He took out a USB flash drive that he carried with him and plugged it into the computer. Then, he tapped on the keyboard a few times and unlocked the laptop.

‘What the f*ck?!

‘This laptop has a firewall! I even hired a world-class IT expert to do it!

‘It was cracked just like that?!

‘This is f*cking unbelievable!’ Nox thought to himself.

George appeared to be unusually calm.

He unlocked the laptop, opened a browser, and entered his hacking system.

Nox still knew some things about computers, but he was still confused by George’s overly complicated codes at this moment.

He just watched as George kept typing on the keyboard.

The degree of flexibility of his fingers... was simply amazing.

Soon, George entered the Swan Group’s internal network.

He entered it just like that, and the system did not even alert that there were outsiders.

Nox was very helpless.

What kind of idlers did he raise with so much money?

He wanted to fire those self-righteous coders.

At this moment, George entered the intranet. All the information was flashing on the screen. It was obvious that everything was automatically transferred to George’s folder. This was a so-called commercial hacker.

The most obvious characteristic of a commercial hacker was that one would steal useful trade secrets without destroying anything. At this moment, all the latest business plans of the Swan Group were in George’s hands.

‘Oh my god.’

Fortunately, George was only 6 years old, so he probably did not know how much the secrets were worth. Otherwise, if they were to be leaked out, the Swan Group would be dealt a heavy blow.

“The reason I can easily enter your firewall and even get all the trade secrets is that a few codes are missing here.” After George put on a magnificent show, he told Edward and Nox the crux of the problem.

Nox moved close to the screen.
