1179 The Cunning Warren, Nox Shows Up

Nox sneered.

“Helping the Duncans’ evil party to go against your leader is a heinous crime!” Warren criticized righteously.

“Your father killed his own leader, so why don’t you say that he’s guilty of the most heinous crime?” Nox was very sarcastic. “it’s just that the tables have turned. That’s all.”

What Warren said just now was clearly just to buy time for himself.

He knew that his reinforcements would be here soon, and once help arrived, he would have a chance to live.

Nox could not be bothered to talk nonsense with Warren either. He said, “Hurry up and hand over your guns. Don’t waste everyone’s time!”

“In your dreams!”

“Whether it’s my dreams or not, you’re done for! Can’t you see? You have one, two, three... Including you, there are six of you altogether, whereas I have at least 60 people here. If I shoot you, you’ll be dead!” Nox said seriously, as if he was trying to persuade Warren. “You’ve enjoyed a high position for so many years. You should be content!”

However, how could Warren be content?

He glared fiercely at Nox, with no intention of surrendering.

Nox was not a patient person either. He had been chasing them for the entire night and was already exhausted.

“If that’s the case, forgive me for being disrespectful and killing you!” Nox’s fingers moved slightly.

All the people surrounding them pulled the trigger.

“Don’t move!” Warren suddenly shackled Jeanne.

Nox’s eyes narrowed.

He did not give any orders, but he was not threatened at all. “Do you think you can threaten me with this woman? You think too much! I can’t wait to shoot her dead. She has used Edward again and again, and you’re still using her as a shield? It’s ridiculous.”

“Nox, I’m pregnant with Edward’s child!” Jeanne said hurriedly.

Nox’s nonchalant face suddenly froze as he looked at Jeanne intently. Clearly, Jeanne’s words had stirred some emotions in him.

“It’s true. Edward knows. If I weren’t pregnant with his child, he wouldn’t have followed me back to the Sanders!” Jeanne said anxiously.

“So what?” Nox’s expression turned cold again. “So what if you’re pregnant with Edward’s child?! There are many women who can bear Edward’s children. You’re not the only one!”

“Edward would never allow another woman to bear his child!” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly. “If he would, he wouldn’t have waited for me for so many years!”

He would not have waited for her for seven years.

“So, you do know how much Edward loves you.” The smile on Nox’s face became even crueler. “Since you know that but still treat Edward like that, how do you think I should treat you? You won’t be satisfied even if I beat you to death, will you?”

“Nox, don’t be rash. I really can’t die. If I die, Edward won’t be able to take it. Trust me.” Jeanne kept trying to persuade Nox.

“Jeanne, are you that afraid of death?” Nox scoffed.

“Yes, I’m afraid of death. I don’t want to die.” Jeanne admitted it. “So, I’m begging you to let me go.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I won’t!” Nox did not have any feelings for Jeanne, to begin with.

Why should he let Jeanne go? Not to mention letting her go under such circumstances, but whenever Jeanne fell into his hands, he would kill her.

“Nox, it’s fine if I die, but the baby in my belly is innocent. She’s only three months old.”

Jeanne’s eyes were red, and she looked really scared!

“Three months is good. The baby won’t have any thoughts. If she dies, so be it.” Nox did not care at all. He said, “Even if Edward doesn’t have any more children with other women, you both still have George. Having George is enough!”

Jeanne bit her lip. She knew that she could not get through to Nox.

Nox should hate her to the core now, so she was only humiliating herself by begging for mercy.

However, she had to do something because she really could not die. She had yet to kill Warren and avenge everyone.

Other than Kingsley and Lucy, she still had her biological parents to avenge.

She just stared at Nox and saw that he was still unmoved. Hence, she gritted her teeth, and at that moment, her eyes narrowed.

Having noticed the change in Jeanne’s eyes, Nox directly fell backward.

At the same time, a grenade was thrown into the crowd, making a loud noise.

Following countless gunshots, the people protecting Warren were all killed to cover Warren’s escape. As for Warren, he managed to escape in the midst of the chaos.

Everything happened so fast that no one could react in time.

No one could not imagine that Warren could still survive in such a desperate situation.

When Jeanne noticed that Warren was secretly getting restless, she was already prepared for him to leave. Therefore, when he made his move, she instantly caught up with him and ran out of the crowd with him.

As a flurry of gunfire sounded behind them, Warren seemed to have been shot. His body trembled a little, but it did not affect him from leaving.

Logically speaking, Warren was nearly 60 years old this year. With his physical fitness, it was impossible for him to have such stamina after a whole night of running around.

It meant that Warren was not simple at all. It even took Jeanne a lot of effort to catch up to Warren and escape into the forest with him.

The people behind them were getting closer and closer.

In the end, Warren hid behind a large rock again. There were many bushes around him, so it would be difficult for their enemy to discover him.

After a series of escapees, the people who would rescue Warren would probably appear in less than five minutes.

No one could say for sure who would win in the end.
