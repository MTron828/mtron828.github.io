1073 Going To Court: Intense Debate

Judah explained, “On November 21st, a child died from being injected with the vaccine at Greenview Vaccine Center. The vaccine was produced by Cardellini Pharmaceutical with the serial number CSYY3299. On November 28th, the quality inspection department released the inspection report of SCY3299, which clearly pointed out that SCY3299 was not completely eliminated of bacteria, causing the child to die after the injection. At the same time, my client produced an autopsy report from the forensic department. The report shows that the child died from an overdose of 80mg of potassium cyanide instead of the vaccine. Furthermore, the same batch of vaccines was administered in public to a 6-year-old child of the same age without any adverse reactions. Therefore, it shows that there is a possibility of error in the quality inspection department’s report. Through the investigation of the director of the quality inspection department, Daniel Cook, and the person in charge of the quality inspection department, it was clear that the report was not an accidental mistake but was deliberately done by someone. The mastermind was Brie Larson, an employee of the quality inspection department. She used her shady relationship with Daniel Cook to threaten Daniel to frame Monica for her.

“In conclusion, Daniel, Brie, and everyone who had participated in the framing of the autopsy had violated the laws and regulations of Harken. We are suing all of the people mentioned above.”

“The lawsuit is established. The plaintiff, please hand over the evidence of the defendant’s crime to the jury,” the judge said.

“Yes.” Judah handed over all the materials he had prepared for the case.

The jury took Judah’s materials and carefully reviewed them.

The scene was silent and solemn.

A long while later, after accepting the jury’s judgment, the judge said to the defendant, “Regarding the evidence and statement of facts provided by the plaintiff, is there anything the defendant needs to add?”

The defendant’s lawyer asked the defendant before replying respectfully, “No. as for the plaintiff’s counsel’s statements, my client pleads guilty to all of them.”

“If the defendant has no objection, the court will adjourn the trial for half an hour. The jury and I will be leaving to make the final decision on this case.” With that, the judge stood up.

Everyone on the jury was also getting up to leave.

At that moment, Monica suddenly said in front of everyone, “I have an objection.”

There was unrest among everyone at the scene as they did not know what Monica was going to do.

Since the facts stated that there was no problem with the Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs and the person who framed her was about to be brought to justice, what other objections did she have?

The judge and the jury stopped in their tracks and looked at Monica.

“Regarding this case, I don’t think Brie is the mastermind. I want to accuse the real mastermind of this case, Michael!” Monica’s clear voice resounded in the court.

In the audience, Michael’s expression changed.

Monica really wanted to kill him!

Of course, he did not think Monica’s accusation would succeed. After all, she was just doing that because she was forced into a corner.

However, being scrutinized by so many gazes still made him furious.

The Sanders had just taken away all of his power the day before. If he had not used the most humble method to express his loyalty to them, coupled with the fact that he was more familiar with the current situation than Chester, the Sanders reluctantly allowed him to stay and help Chester. Otherwise, he would have really lost everything.

He looked at Monica with cold eyes.

All of his attachments to Monica had wholly disappeared. He could not wait to kill Monica immediately to relieve the hatred in his heart.

He gritted his teeth and forced himself to look calm.

He could not afford to make any more mistakes. If he did, the Sanders would completely abandon him.

Moreover, he could not accept that his life would end like that.

In the solemn court, the judge’s face was serious. “If there’s no evidence, the court will not accept the relevant charges.”

“But it’s obvious that Michael was the one who committed the crime.” Monica was not afraid of the judge at all.

Before the judge could speak, Monica said loudly, “Back then, I tore his mask in front of everyone at our wedding, and it affected his future and image. He held a grudge against me, so he colluded with Brie to frame me.”

“Do you have any evidence?” the judge asked.

“Brie has liked Michael for many years. The two of them were childhood sweethearts, and she had been waiting for Michael to change his mind. To put it bluntly, she would do whatever Michael asked her to do.”

“This is just your side of the story. If you don’t have any evidence, I’ll see it as you deliberately affecting the court’s trial. According to Harken’s laws, obstructing the court’s trial is also a crime. The maximum sentence you can get is three years in prison. ” The judge was obviously on Michael’s side.

Nevertheless, Monica was still not threatened. She said loudly, “In Daniel Cook’s confession, he mentioned that he had an improper relationship with Brie. In fact, I too said that Brie is deeply in love with Michael and can’t have sex with any other man. So, I seriously suspect that Daniel fabricated his story! To Daniel, since he has already been exposed and will be punished by the law anyway, no matter what, he will plead guilty. The biggest reason why he didn’t expose Michael was that Michael had promised him something.”

“I didn’t! All my confessions are true,” Daniel, who was in the defendant’s seat, quickly said.

“Is that so? Anyway, Brie isn’t here. You can say whatever you want!” Monica retorted.

Daniel was rendered speechless by Monica’s rebuttal.

“You’re wrong!” Daniel was extremely agitated.

“Are you agitated because you have a guilty conscience?!” Monica questioned.

“I’m only agitated because Michael is a good person. He is diligent in his work and selflessly dedicates himself to his position. Michael is the person I admire the most in my life. I won’t allow you to frame him like this! I can swear that this matter has nothing to do with Michael. It was Brie and I who had planned it!” Daniel said resolutely.

His appearance at that moment could really convince everyone present. Even Monica believed him.

Michael sat in the audience and smiled quietly.

If Monica wanted to go against him, her skills were still far from his.

At that moment, the judge’s face turned cold. “Monica, if you continue to make a ruckus in court, I will kick you out on the charge of contempt of court!”

Monica gritted her teeth.

She had no evidence. Without evidence, no one would believe it, no matter how reasonable it was. However, she refused to give up.

In fact, even if Nox did not remind her to expose Michael in court, she would have done it.

Even if there was a glimmer of hope that would ruin Michael’s reputation, she would do it, at any price!

The court was silent.

The judge enunciated his words solemnly. “Please return to your seat. No more–”

“Who said Monica has no evidence?” In the audience, Nox’s voice suddenly shocked everyone.
