1176 Chester’s Ambition Exposed

Chester was furious when he heard what Warren said, and his veins were popping as he glared at the latter.

“Move!” Warren shouted angrily. He did not care about Chester’s feelings at all.

However, Chester did not move.

“Chester!” Warren threatened, “Don’t make me leave you behind! I’ll count to three. If you don’t move, I’ll kill you right in front of me! One, two, three...”

The moment Warren said the word “three”, Warren’s personal bodyguards, who were standing beside them, raised their guns and pointed them at Warren and Jeanne.

Warren’s expression changed. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, Jeanne could not hide her surprise either. She did not expect Chester to have bribed Warren’s personal bodyguards!

How many people had been plotting against Warren all these years?

“Father! You forced me to do this!” Chester sneered.

From his lack of imposing aura earlier, he now stood like he had won the battle, looking down at Warren condescendingly.

His face was filled with cruelty.

“What are you guys doing?” Warren yelled at his bodyguards.

“What are they doing? Of course, they want to kill you.” Chester laughed hysterically.

As Warren suppressed his emotions, his body trembled.

“You’ve probably forgotten that I’m the one who replaced all these personal bodyguards for you. These people were never yours. They were always mine!” The more Chester spoke, the more smug and arrogant he became!

“Are you crazy? How dare you treat me like this!” Warren looked at his son in disbelief.

He could not believe that one day, his son would point a gun at his head!

“I don’t want to treat you like this either, but you’re not worthy of being my father!” Chester said, “I’ve seen too much of your dark side over the years. I knew that one day, you would be turned over! If you rule a country like this, the Sanders will die in your hands one day, so I have to make plans for my future!”

“Y-Y-You unfilial son!” Warren was so angry that he almost fainted.

“I didn’t expect this day to come so soon! I thought that if you wanted to abdicate, you should, at the very least, help me get rid of the Duncans. I don’t want to fight with the Duncans and ruin my reputation as soon as I take over! However, I didn’t expect you to be so useless and be forced to this point by the Duncans so quickly! If not Jeanne, the Duncans would’ve killed you!”

“Chester, shut up!”

“You should be the one to shut up!” Chester’s expression was fierce. He no longer had any respect for Warren or had to act according to Warren’s wishes. He felt a sense of satisfaction that he had never felt before. “As the defeated opponent, what right do you have to yell at me? Now that I think about it, you actually doubted me and even looked down on me because of Jeanne’s ability! Warren, this is what you get for looking down on me. Are you satisfied?”

Warren’s face was twisted in anger.

“Initially, I wanted to kill you right away when you and Jeanne were doing things behind my back. However, I never found a good opportunity. Now, I can kill you openly now, and no one will know that I did it. This way, I can legitimately inherit my position as the head of the Sanders. With that, I’ll become the leader of the country...” Chester laughed wildly.

It was as if he was the only one in the world.

“If you kill me now, will you be able to deal with the Duncans? Do you really think that you can go against the Duncans with your petty tricks? Stop dreaming! You will be killed by the Duncans before you can really take the position of the leader!” Warren cursed at Chester.

“Isn’t the Duncans surrounded by your people now?!” Chester mocked, “I’ll just sit back and enjoy the fruits of your labor!”

“You!”

“That’s true.” Chester’s face was filled with sarcasm again. “Before you die, you should reflect on why so many people around you want to betray you. Other than me, there are also the Sanders’ guards and officials. Why do they all treat you like this?”

Warren’s expression was grim. At that moment, he wished he could shoot his son to death.

“In fact, the reason is very simple. Other than yourself and your own interests, you don’t care about anyone else. You don’t care about the feelings of your children, your officials, or your security guards. As long as they threaten you a little, you will kill them all. If you do this, who will be willing to be loyal to you? Who will be willing to work for you? Oh, right.” Chester seemed to have suddenly thought of something and said sarcastically, “You were the one who killed your biological brother back then, weren’t you?”

“Chester!” With his bottom line crossed, Warren became even angrier.

“Even though I was still young back then, I knew many things. I heard with my own ears that you plotted against your own brother and then killed him. You knew very well that grandpa liked Uncle Joseph more and that you couldn’t compare to him in terms of ability, so you used the most despicable means to kill him. After so many years, do you really think that no one knows? Do you really think that Uncle Joseph’s death was just an accident? You just pretended not to know because you were afraid you’d get into trouble! You’re so cruel. Once you’re provoked, you start killing. Tell me, how many people in the Sanders’ regime want to see you dead?”
