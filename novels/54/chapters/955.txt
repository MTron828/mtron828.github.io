956 I Can’t Think of a Title Anymore, Let’s See What the Officials Do

“What is it?”

“Dr. Mac says you can go for the skin rejuvenation therapy now. He’s waiting for you in the beauty room.”

“Okay, tell him I’ll be there soon.”

“Yes.”

With that, the servant left respectfully.

“You still need skin rejuvenation therapy?” Jeanne remembered that Lucy’s body had become smooth and tender.

“Oh, there are still scars, so it’ll be better if I do it two more times.”

“It’s true what they saying about a woman wanting to look beautiful for the man she likes.” Jeanne sighed.

“Do you want to come with me?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Forget it.” Jeanne rejected her.

She did not want to show her body to other men for the time being, and Lucy did not force her either.

She put on a silk nightgown and walked to the building at the edge of the manor.

The setup here was so complete that it was jaw-dropping.

In fact, there were no cosmetic services in the beginning, but there were operating theatres because many assassins would get injured. After they get injured, they would come back here for surgery. However, many female assassins needed to complete their missions with their bodies. If they had too many scars on their bodies, it would affect the success or failure of the missions. As such, Kingsley found some cosmetic doctors, but he later found out that they could only do major cosmetic surgeries and were not good at basic skincare. Hence, he arranged for a professional beauty department.

Hence, when the assassins returned, they could enjoy all kinds of skincare treatment here.

In the beginning, only female killers went for beauty treatment, but many male assassins joined later on.

Eventually, professional beauty treatments also came with a lot of massage services.

In short, it was a place where one could relax and enjoy.

When Lucy appeared in the beauty room, she saw Kingsley there as well.

Kingsley was with Millie at the time, and the two most professional masseuses were already waiting there.

“Mr. Thorn,” Lucy called out to him respectfully.

Kingsley glanced at Lucy.

He had been back from South Hampton City for more than half a month, but it seemed to be his first time seeing the woman since then.

However, Lucy was not by his side, so it was normal that he did not see her. Some of the assassins living here would not even see him for a year.

Kingsley and Millie walked into their private room.

In fact, there were different levels of treatment, and assassins were divided into different levels.

A higher-level assassin would enjoy better service, while lower-level assassins could only enjoy some basic services.

Fortunately, Lucy’s status among the assassins was very high. Before Kingsley said anything, no one dared not serve Lucy. Of course, Lucy would not lower her status as well. After all, after enjoying all the high-end services, she would not want anything less.

She watched as Kingsley and Millie left before she walked into her private room.

Each private room was separated by a curtain. Therefore, it was not soundproof, and Lucy’s room just so happened to be right next to Kingsley’s.

She could hear everything on the other side clearly.

Hence, just as Lucy took off her clothes and let the aesthetician laser her scars, she heard Miley’s sexy and enchanting voice from next door.

Lucy’s eyes twitched, and Lucy’s aesthetican smiled.

However, because they were Kingsley’s subordinates, no one dared to say anything.

“How long is it going to take today?” Lucy asked.

“About three hours.” The aesthetician replied, “After you’re done, you can come back one more time for treatment, and you won’t be able to tell at all.”

“Okay.”

“Ms. Harmon, are you cold? Do you need me to turn up the temperature?” The aesthetician asked.

“No, I think it’s fine.”

“Alright.” The aesthetician was very polite to her.

Although assassins risked their lives outside, they could enjoy emperor-like treatment when they returned.

Lucy lay on the bed while the aesthetician repaired her scars.

Then, she heard Millie’s cry.

Of course, it was not that Kingsley and Mi Li doing anything. However, during the massage, it might be a little painful or ticklish, so she could not help but make a little noise.

Millie seemed to be exaggerating.

Fortunately, Kingsley’s massage usually did not last long as he would leave after an hour.

When he was leaving, he stopped at the door to Lucy’s room.

At that time, Lucy was still lying on the bed naked and did not expect the curtain to be suddenly opened.

Ultimately, it was still a little awkward.

She turned around, only to see Kingsley and Millie.

Millie’s face was ruddy. She must have enjoyed the massage.
