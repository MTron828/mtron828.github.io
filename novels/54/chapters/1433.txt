At that moment, Monica seemed to glance at Finn.

Finn said, “You can eat whatever you want. It’s important that your stomach gets what it needs.”

Monica thought for a moment before saying, “Mushroom.”

“Okay, we’ll send it to you right away.”

With that, Monica lay down again.

She had to admit that her stomach was empty as she had not eaten anything since she got off the plane. On second thought, was she not throwing much up because there was nothing in her stomach?

After a while, the nurse delivered a bowl of mushroom soup with bread to the ward. Finn walked over and naturally wanted to feed her, but Monica refused.

Finn did not force it on her. All he did was set up a simple dining table on the bed and placed the mushroom soup on it. “Be careful. It’s hot.”

Monica glanced at him and chose to remain silent. Meanwhile, Finn sat beside her and watched her eat the soup and bread in small bites.

Monica was probably really hungry because she had eaten quite a bit by then. After eating it, she did not feel like she was going to throw it all up. Instead, she felt a warm feeling in her stomach.

While she ate in silence, Finn accompanied her quietly. At that moment, it felt like time passed peacefully.

After a while, Monica had eaten more than half of it, but she could not eat anymore. She put down the spoon and was about to ask the nurse to clean up the dishes. However, Finn had stood up and was helping her to clean it up.

Monica took a look at him but did not say anything. She just turned around and pressed the call button again. “I want to see my attending doctor.”

“Okay, Ms. Cardellini. Dr. West will be there soon,” the other party said respectfully.

It did not take long before the door to the ward was pushed open, and Dr. West walked in. The moment he saw Finn, he greeted him before turning to Monica.

“Ms. Cardellini, are you feeling unwell?” Dr. West asked gently.

“No, I feel much better, so I wanted to ask when I can be discharged.”

“If you feel better, you can be discharged anytime.” Dr. West did not forget to remind her, “But if your nausea or morning sickness is bad, you must seek medical attention in time. Otherwise, it will be very dangerous. However, since

Dr. Jones will be by your side, he will know when you need to see a doctor.” Monica did not speak.

Dr. West did not say much either. All he did was remind her, “Also, Ms. Cardellini, you’re pregnant now, so you have to come for a pregnancy checkup every month. When it’s time for it, our hospital staff will inform you in advance.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded and said, “In that case, I’ll have to trouble you to help me with the discharge procedures, Dr. West.”

Dr. West nodded.

At that time, Monica was also done with the IV drip, and the nurse came in to help Monica with it.

“I’ll do it,” Finn said as he took the disinfectant from the nurse’s hand.

Since all the doctors and nurses in South Hampton City Central Hospital knew Finn, the nurse hurriedly handed the item to Finn.

Actually, Monica did not want his help… However, for some reason, she did not stop him.

Finn’s slender and clean fingers removed the needle on the IV drip nimbly for her. After removing it, he used a moderate amount of strength to press down on her blood vessels.

“I’ll do it myself.” Monica felt a little uncomfortable about it.

“Don’t move. You might bleed.”

Who was he trying to fool?!

In the end, Finn held Monica’s arm down for a long time.

At that time, the nurse also came to inform Monica that the discharge procedures had been completed and she could be discharged.

Monica immediately got up and walked out of the ward with Finn by her side. As she walked out of the hospital’s main entrance to hail a taxi, Finn pulled her back.

“I’ll send you back.”

“No, thanks.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’m only doing this for the babies.”

Monica was at a loss for words, and Finn dragged her into his car, with Monica sitting in the backseat while he sat in the driver’s seat.

Neither of them spoke, but Monica could hear the constant honking behind her.

At a traffic light, Monica could not stand it anymore. “Finn, there are still ten seconds left.”

Ten seconds was definitely enough for him to cross the road. “Safety is more important.”

She knew that Finn always drove slowly, but today, he was too slow.

Usually, it would take at most 20 minutes for her to get home. How did Finn take 40 minutes to get there?

Monica held her emotions in until the car finally arrived at her residential area..
