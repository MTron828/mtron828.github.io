Chapter 70: Jeanne Was Drunk

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At night, Jeanne went out to have dinner with Monica.

George stayed at home. He did not want to go out again.

His personality was rather dull, and he did not like to interact with people. Thinking that she could not avoid drinking at night, Jeanne did not force him.

Jeanne changed into a casual outfit. She wore a white t-shirt, a short fishtail floral skirt, and a pair of white sports shoes. Jeanne casually tied a loose bun on her head, revealing her delicate little face and slender white neck. She was as beautiful as ever.

She drove out and arrived at the high-class restaurant that Monica had mentioned.

Under the guidance of the waiter, Jeanne walked into the private room.

Monica was waiting for her in the private room. When she saw her, she was unusually excited.

“Jeannie, you’re here.”

“What’s wrong with you and Finn?” Jeanne asked straightforwardly.

The smile on Monica’s face was a little stiff. “Can we not talk about him?”

“Isn’t this the reason you called me here?”

“Who said that? I simply asked you to come and drink with me.”

“I’m not a good drinker.”

“What does that have to do with anything? As long as you’re by my side, it’s fine.” Monica hugged Jeanne’s arm intimately, “You don’t even know that during the seven years you’ve been away, I haven’t been able to find anyone to confide in. I don’t even have anyone to accompany me. My parents might seem open-minded, but they don’t know anything about my relationships.”

Actually, it was not only Monica who compromised with Jeanne easily.

Jeanne also compromised with Monica very easily.

Her heart was slightly moved. “I’ll accompany you tonight.”

“I know you’re the best.” Monica smiled unusually... cunningly.

The two of them sat at the dining table.

It was a huge table. There was a lot of food and wine.

Just as the two of them were eating, someone suddenly knocked on the door.

The waiter quickly went forward and opened it.

“Monica.” From the door came a familiar male voice.

Jeanne and Monica turned their heads at the same time.

“Nox, why are you here?!” It was Monica’s somewhat exaggerated scream.

“I accompanied Fourth Master Swan here for a meal. I heard from the front desk that you’re here too, so I came over.”

“Is Fourth Master Swan here too?” Monica asked.

“I’m here.” Following the voice, the person outside the door walked in.

“Since we met by chance, let’s have a meal together?” Monica was very enthusiastic.

The words that were about to come out of Jeanne’s mouth were swallowed just like that.

‘What a terrible friend.’

“Obedience is better than politeness.” Fourth Master Swan agreed immediately.

Monica hurriedly called out, “Come and sit.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Edward very naturally sat next to Jeanne.

Nox sat next to Edward.

After sitting down, Nox took the initiative to look at Jeanne. “Ms. Lawrence, what a coincidence.”

In the end, Jeanne was still a little awkward.

She smiled. “What a coincidence to meet three times in a day.”

“It’s fate.” Nox smiled mischievously.

Jeanne did not reply.

She thought, ‘Ill fate!’

“Where’s Finn?” Nox was not feeling awkward. He asked Monica, pretending that they had only met by chance indeed.

“He doesn’t have time for us now, so don’t ask about him. I’m here to drink tonight! Nox, do you dare not go home without getting drunk?!” Monica directly changed the topic.

“It’s not that I don’t dare. I’m afraid that I’ll still be sober when you’re drunk.”

“Who gave you the courage? How dare you boast so shamelessly?!” Monica was full of fighting spirit.

“Come, I’ll show you what it’s like to be a good drinker!”

“Come, come...”

The two of them started to drink.

They drank like crazy.

Jeanne ate dinner quietly.

Edward also ate his dinner quietly.

“Aren’t you busy?” At the dining table, Fourth Master Swan suddenly spoke.

Jeanne paused for a moment before she said calmly, “Can’t you see I’m busy entertaining Monica?”

Fourth Master Swan smiled and took the initiative to raise his wine glass. “Cheers, Ms. Lawrence?”

Jeanne did not want to drink.

She originally wanted to say that it was inconvenient, but the wine glass in front of her that was filled to the brim by Monica gave her no reason to refuse.

Jeanne raised her wine glass. “Cheers, Fourth Master.”

Then, she downed the wine in one go.

Edward downed the wine in one go as well.

“Ms. Lawrence, you’re a good drinker.” Nox and Monica drank a few rounds. Seeing the way Jeanne drank, they hurriedly raised their wine glasses as well. “I want to have a drink with you too, Ms. Lawrence.”

Jeanne did not refuse.

Tonight, she was here to vent with Monica. She did not want to ruin the atmosphere.

She and Nox drank a few glasses of wine.

Monica saw that Jeanne did not reject anyone. She was a good drinker, so she drank with Jeanne as well.

In the room, everyone drank quite a lot.

Monica was a little drunk.

Jeanne had been drunk for a long time.

Her alcohol tolerance was not very good. She actually did not drink much. It was obvious that she had exceeded her limit tonight.

She went to the washroom.

When she came out, she directly bumped into a man’s embrace. The person’s chest was as hard as iron.

Jeanne stood up straight and rubbed her nose.

She raised her head to look at Fourth Master Swan, who was looking down from above. “Why do you keep haunting me?!”

Edward frowned slightly.

“Move aside. I’m going to accompany Monica.” Jeanne pushed the man in front of her.

The man did not move. “It’s late. I’ll send you back, Ms. Lawrence.”

“No!” Jeanne was very determined. “I agreed to accompany Monica properly tonight. I can’t just leave like this.”

“Nox will accompany her.”

“Nox can’t control his lower body. Letting him accompany her is like letting a wolf into a tiger’s den.”

“Don’t worry. Nox knows his limits.”

“Why should I listen to you? You’re colluding together.” Jeanne reeked of alcohol and was doubtful.

Edward’s gaze was deep as he stared intently at her blushing cheeks. He said, “Is this how you look when you’re drunk?”

Jeanne’s eyes were blurred as she watched the person in front of her suddenly bend over and approach her.

Her rationality still forced her to take a step back in self-protection.

Nevertheless, she was suddenly hugged by someone. He was so strong that she was unable to move.

She looked at Fourth Master Swan angrily.

Fourth Master Swan’s lips were close to her right ear. “If you keep acting like this, I can’t help but...”

His voice after that was so soft that only they could hear what he said.

Jeanne’s face suddenly turned red.

Just as she was about to push him away, Fourth Master Swan lifted her up.

Jeanne instinctively hugged the man’s neck, afraid that she would fall to the ground.

Edward carried Jeanne and left the private room. “Nox, take good care of Ms. Cardellini.”

“Okay.” Nox agreed immediately.

Monica watched helplessly as Jeannie was carried away by Fourth Master Swan.

Many explicit images appeared in her mind. She stood up from the chair and was about to rush out the next second when Nox grabbed her. “What are you doing?”

“I’m going to snatch Jeannie back!” Monica was unusually agitated. “I can’t disregard my sister’s innocence!”

“Have you forgotten that you’re trying to set them up?” Nox reminded her. “As an experienced person, I have to tell you that this method is direct and effective!”

Monica was shaken.

‘Damn.

‘Would I be struck by lightning for tricking my best friend?!’
