Chapter 315: Set a Date for the Wedding

In Bamboo Garden, Nox helped Edward to his bed.

At that moment, Finn was already waiting in Bamboo Garden.

Last night, Nox dialed Finn’s number and told him to come to Bamboo Garden early in the morning as he had expected such an outcome.

Finn asked while treating the wound on Edward’s back, “What happened?” Why was he whipped again?

The Fourth Master seemed to be injured a little too frequently these days.

Nox laughed sinisterly and did not reply.

On the contrary, Edward, who had always been quiet, said, “Finn, I’m getting married.”

His tone sounded indifferent, but if one were to look carefully, one could hear the joy in his voice.

Finn’s hand that was treating the wound paused for a moment. Then, he turned to look at Nox beside him as if to confirm whether it was true.

He found that it was too sudden, so much that he could not accept it. It was just like that year when he suddenly announced that he was getting married, and they, too, found it hard to believe.

“With Jeanne.” Feeling Finn’s gaze on him, Nox added, and when he said the word Jeanne, he gritted his teeth.

Finn was surprised, but he also understood. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He reacted much calmer than Nox and accepted it in an instant. He said, “Congratulations.”

......

The man lying on the bed raised his head and smiled.

Once Finn dressed and bandaged Edward’s back, he packed up his medical kit and told Edward some things to take note of.

Then, he could not help but ask, “When are you getting married?”

Edward replied, “In a few days.”

“...”

Why the hurry?

“Rest well and don’t get yourself hurt again. You’ll be able to recover within a week.” Finn was serious. “It won’t affect your sex life.”

Edward nodded.

“I’ll head off now. I have surgery to attend to this afternoon.” With that, Finn got up.

Nox glanced at Finn’s back as he left, and when he turned around, he saw that Edward had already gotten up from the bed.

He said in a strange tone, “Didn’t Finn say not to get up? Aren’t you afraid that you won’t be able to have sex on your wedding night?”

“Get Teddy over for me.” Edward ignored Nox, who rolled his eyes.

Forget it.

In any case, in this life, Fourth Master Swan had fallen into Jeanne’s hands!

..

Jeanne left the house with George, who would go to school while she went to work at Lawrence Enterprise.

Everything seemed to have returned to square one.

Who would have thought that just yesterday, for a split second, everything here would have become a thing of the past?

She had just been sent to the company when her phone rang.

She took a glance at the incoming call and composed herself before saying, “Fourth Master.”

“Where are you?”

“At work.” The corners of Jeanne’s mouth curled into a smile. “Fourth Master, is there something you need?”

“My father wants to see you.”

Her heart skipped a beat.

“I’ll pick you up from work tonight.”

“...Okay.”

When the other side hung up the phone, Jeanne held the phone in her hand in a daze.

Miles looked at her. “Are you sure you want to marry Fourth Master Swan?”

“Or what?”Jeanne snapped back to her senses and regained her composure.

“Does Mr. Thorn really wants you to marry him?” Ming Lang found it somewhat unbelievable.

“Have you ever seen Kingsley joke around?”

Miles nodded and then sighed.

Jeanne knew what he was sighing about. However, she smiled and said, “I’m leaving.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne got out of the car and walked straight into Lawrence Enterprise. She had not come to work for more than a week, so everyone was a little surprised to see her.

As she walked straight into her office, Amy hurriedly followed her in. “Director Lawrence, I thought you weren’t coming to work.”

“I ran into something, so I took a week off. Did anything big happen this week?” Jeanne asked as she turned on her computer.

“The logistics warehouse project is in full swing, and we’re doing pilot marketing to some areas. The effect isn’t obvious at the moment, but it is going in a good direction,” Amy reported respectfully. “In the company, the transitioning of the senior management role hasn’t been smooth. Although many from the senior management don’t say it, the comments have not been good, which has led to a lot of work being held back.”

“Didn’t the executive general manager do anything about it?”Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“No. I don’t think he asked much, so some work has been delayed.”

“Okay, I got it.” Jeanne nodded.

“Director Lawrence, black coffee without sugar?”

“Thank you.”

With that, Amy turned to leave.

“Call Forrest over for me.”

“Sure.”

Forrest pushed the door open and entered. Then, he sat in front of Jeanne and could not help but say, “I thought you wouldn’t come to work.”

After all, she had disappeared for a week without saying anything.
