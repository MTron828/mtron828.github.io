Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the edge of the cliff, Edward’s agile movements and deft hands quickly locked Jeanne in his arms.

His movements were smooth and unpredictable.

“Don’t shoot!” Edward shouted at Kingsley.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

Mason’s hand, which was about to pull the trigger on Finn and Nox, paused.

With that, Nox and Finn, who had just left, also stopped in their tracks when they heard the sound and turned to look at them.

Seeing Edward standing on the edge of the cliff with Jeanne shackled in his arms, they ran back without a second thought.

At that moment, Kingsley’s gaze was fixed on Edward.

He watched closely as Edward held Jeanne in his arms. She might fall off the cliff if she was not careful.

He asked Jeanne coldly, “This is the person you tried so hard to save just now!”

Jeanne looked at Kingsley and sneered. “Isn’t that so?

Was he not being used by Edward as well?

When she saw that Edward was about to commit suicide, she did not even think twice about it. She instinctively wanted to stop him and did not even consider that her actions just now would lead to her dying with Edward. If Edward really wanted to commit suicide, she could not stop him at all. She would only fall into the abyss with Edward.

Who would have thought that all of Edward’s actions just now were just an act?

He was taking advantage of her sympathy for him, making her think that he was going to commit suicide. Then, when she was defenseless, he turned the situation against her.

Jeanne did not really know what she was feeling now.

Was she disappointed because Edward schemed against her?

However, if Edward had not schemed against her, he would have been dead by now.

She felt conflicted, but she could make herself look indifferent and hide her emotions from anyone.

She had been trained by the Hills for many years. Although she was not as good as other assassins, she was still very good at controlling her expressions and emotions.

“I never thought of doing this to you,” Edward suddenly said in her ear.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

However, she did not respond to him, and he did not seem to expect a response from her.

After that simple explanation, he turned to Kingsley and said, “Let us go. Otherwise, I’ll die with Jeanne.”

Kingsley’s expression was extremely cold.

“Fourth Master Swan, you’re more capable than I thought. I can’t believe that with your current body condition, you can still maintain such skills and even have such a strong judgment to judge that Jeanne would save you because she could not bear to see you dead!” Kingsley said through gritted teeth.

He did not expect Jeanne to come and save him. He was just gambling on his luck since he was about to die anyway.

If Jeanne had not saved him, he would have died.

If Jeanne reached out, he would use her. He had no choice, and he would not hesitate.

“Don’t you think you’re despicable?” Kingsley mocked.

Edward looked at Kingsley and did not react to the latter’s words. To be more precise, it was hard to tell his emotions from his beaten-up face.

He said, “All’s fair in war.”

He did not deny that he was despicable. After all, he had never been a good person.

He had been trained like an animal for a single goal that he had done many outrageous things for, such as killing countless people.

He had never said that he was a good person.

He had many dark sides to him, but from now on, he would slowly reveal themselves to Jeanne.

“If I refuse to let you go, what will you do? Die with Jeanne?” Kingsley asked him coldly, his whole body filled with hostility. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I will.” Edward gave him a definite answer.

Yes, he would sacrifice Jeanne’s life for his own.

He had to live.

In fact, what he said to Finn and Nox just now was to lower Cheng Kaizhi’s guard against him.

He could not die before he achieved his goal.

Some missions did not give him right to choose death.

When Jeanne heard Edward’s resolute and decisive words, no matter how indifferent she could be, she reacted subtly.

She even believed that Edward would really do as he said.

At that moment, she heard Kingsley say, “If you’re willing to, you can die with her. In any case, I won’t let you leave here alive today.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.
