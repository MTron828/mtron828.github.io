1039 Pushed To The Limit

“But he’s still unconscious.” Monica refused to let go of the issue.

The director was a little helpless. “Ms. Cardellini, treatment takes time. Please understand our position. To be honest, we didn’t wish for such an accident to happen either. Dr. Jones has been really busy with your father’s matter. He was just discussing with me to mobilize all our connections and invite an international team to the hospital.”

Monica glanced at Finn at that moment, and Finn looked back at her.

Of course, she could not bring herself to thank him.

She did not blame Finn for the medical accident, but she did not fully understand it.

After all, the one who was hurt in the end was her father, not Finn.

She asked, “How much are you planning to compensate me?”

“We’ve done a preliminary calculation with the insurance company. The compensation for the damage caused to your father in this accident is about 280 thousand dollars,” the director said.

Monica listened, but the director did not think it was a good idea to continue.

Perhaps that was a large sum of money for an ordinary family, but to the Cardellinis, or at least to former Cardellinis, that was not much money at all.

“Of course, our hospital will also compensate you to a certain extent. While your father is being treated in the hospital, we will reduce your father’s medical expenses! I’m currently pitching it to my superior, and I estimate that you’ll have 60 percent off the overall treatment cost.”

Monica did not say anything.

The hospital director quickly added, “Given your father’s condition, long-term treatment is definitely necessary. A 60 percent discount is really not a small sum.”

“I’ll accept the compensation from the insurance company, but I won’t accept the hospital’s compensation,” Monica said bluntly.

“The amount of compensation from the hospital definitely won’t be lower than that of the insurance company. Currently, the medicine your father uses is all imported high-quality medicine, which can’t be reimbursed by medical insurance. On top of that, the medical equipment your father uses now is the best in the hospital. Altogether–”

“It’ll be a lot, but I can’t accept it.” Monica interrupted the director.

The director looked at Monica.

The atmosphere in the office was a little tense.

At that moment, the director might not have expected that a young lady like Monica could have such courage. She was not easy to talk to or fool.

As such, he could not help but glance at Finn.

When Finn received the director’s message, he said, “This is indeed the biggest compensation that the hospital can get for you.”

He was the one who had requested the director to fight for it.

After all, given Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation, it was difficult to guarantee that the Cardellinis would still be able to afford such expensive treatment.

Being able to save some money was definitely not a bad thing.

Moreover, medical malpractice could be considered an accident if it was serious and normal if it was minor.

It was actually very difficult to judge by law.

Sometimes, just to keep things at peace and keep the hospital’s reputation, they would offer compensation!

Monica replied, “I know, but I have another solution.”

Finn looked at her.

Monica said bluntly, “I do find it hard to accept my father’s accident, but it’s not to the point where I’m completely unreasonable. Otherwise, on the day of the accident, I probably would’ve fought with the hospital.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Yes, yes, yes. I have to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this. Thank you for being so understanding of the hospital.” The director quickly complimented Monica.

However, Monica did not appreciate it.

She said, “The reason why I didn’t make a big deal out of it was partly that I didn’t want to have a bad relationship with the hospital. Even if I did make a big deal out of it, I wouldn’t be able to gain any benefits from it. I don’t care if you believe me or not, but although my family is facing bankruptcy, money doesn’t mean to me. I’m not short of it.”

“I believe you,” Finn answered on behalf of the director.

Monica grew up in a privileged environment since she was young, so she really had no concept of money.

In fact, the director also knew about Finn’s relationship with the Cardellinis, and he was very glad that Finn was in charge of the surgery this time. Otherwise, he did not know how far things would have gone.

At that moment, when he heard Finn’s words, he quickly nodded and said, “I believe you, Ms. Cardellini. You’ve lived a good life since you were young, so it’s normal for you to have no concept of money.”

“Therefore, I only have one condition for my father’s accident.”

“Go ahead.” The hospital director was being very proactive.

“I heard that the hospital used to use Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s products, but because our reputation was affected some time ago, all of our products have been returned. Now that the issue with Cardellini Enterprise’s products has been clarified, I wonder whether you’d be getting your sales department to purchase the supply as usual.”
