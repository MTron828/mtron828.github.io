Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“No, once Nox promises something, he will definitely do it. I received 500 thousand dollars from him last night, and after the abortion today, Nox will pay me the other 500 thousand. Don’t worry, Dad,” Zoe replied.

“Do you want us to go with you?”

“No need. Just wait for me at home,” Zoe said bluntly.

“Take care of yourself.” Zoe’s parents reminded her.

“Alright.”

With that, Zoe opened the door and went downstairs. After waiting at the gate for a few minutes, a luxurious black car stopped beside Zoe.

As soon as Zoe opened the car door and got in, the first thing she saw was Nox’s cold face. Hence, she pursed her lips and held her tongue.

The car soon arrived at South Hampton City Central Hospital, and Zoe was directly assigned to a ward for a preoperative examination. Nox sat in the ward with her without saying a word as if the two of them were strangers.

Around 10 a.m., the results of all the tests were out, and the medical staff brought Zoe to the operating theater.

When they were leaving, Zoe could not help but ask Nox, “Will you regret it?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Nox glanced at Zoe. “What do you think?”

“He’s your flesh and blood, after all. Don’t you feel guilty at all?” Zoe gritted her teeth and asked.

She had had enough of Nox’s indifference toward her.

“I don’t think so.” Nox said coldly, “After all, you’re the one who’s carrying my child.”

“Nox, I hope you die with no children!”

Zoe left the ward with the doctor after saying those vicious words. Then, Nox told his subordinates to go with them while he waited in the ward.

What Zoe said about hoping he died without any children kept replaying in his mind, and he felt that Zoe was right. As he took out a cigarette and walked to the balcony to smoke, he realized he was not as indifferent about killing his own flesh and blood as he thought. His hand that was smoking seemed to be trembling slightly.

At 11 a.m., Zoe had yet to return. Did they not say that it would end in half an hour?

Nox could not help but call his subordinate. “Why isn’t it over yet?”

“I just heard from the operating theater that Zoe seems to be suffering from a major hemorrhage. Currently, they need to remove her uterus, but Zoe has refused to sign the papers for her uterus to be removed. I’ve just informed Zoe’s parents to come over and sign it.”

“Damn it!” Nox cursed.

He quickly threw away the cigarette butt and ran to the operating theater. He arrived just as Zoe’s parents arrived as well.

When Zoe’s parents heard that her uterus had to be cut out, they cried in fear. Neither of them dared to sign the paper. However, the doctor said that if the uterus were not removed, Zoe would die. As a last resort, Zoe’s father signed the contract with tears in his eyes.

Once the paper was signed, the doctor quickly went in to perform the surgery.

The only sound in the entire corridor was Zoe’s parents’ heart-wrenching cries. Nox, who was standing at the side, was a little saddened by how the situation had turned out.

The moment Zoe’s father saw Nox, he got so angry that he suddenly stepped forward and threw a punch. Nox did not dodge and took the punch from Zoe’s father.

“Nox, you b*stard! No matter how much Zoe has done to let you down, she shouldn’t be suffering such revenge! You b*stard!” Zoe’s father cursed.

Zoe’s mother was also crying her heart out, but Nox remained silent. Zoe’s father was so angry that he went forward to hit Nox again.

However, Nox’s two subordinates quickly stopped him. “Stop it, or I won’t be polite!”

The two professional bodyguards naturally restrained Zoe’s father.

Nox looked at them coldly.

“I’ll give you another one million dollars!” Nox said coldly, ‘You can take it as my buying Zoe’s womb.”

“You b*stard, how can you say such words? Do you know that a woman without a uterus can never be with child anymore? Nox, you b*stard…” Nox’s expression was indifferent as he listened to Zoe’s father’s insults.

He said to his men, “Let’s go.”

“Aren’t you waiting for Zoe to come out?”

“No need. Her parents can take care of him. From now on, I have nothing to do with Zoe.” With that, Nox left..
