“No need to say anymore,” Finn interrupted her.

Tears welled up in Monica’s eyes. She felt that she had cried more recently than in her entire life.

She heard Finn say, “Since you’ve chosen him, you should be with him properly.”

“I didn’t choose him!” Monica defended loudly, “I’m only helping him. After this, I’ll come back. There’s nothing between him and me. Nothing! Although you asked him to pick me up last night, nothing happened between us. Nothing will happen between us–”

“Finn, why don’t you believe me?” Monica was really anxious. She wanted to explain things clearly to Finn and for him to be able to trust her once.

“Do you believe me?” Finn asked her coldly.

Monica was stunned.

Finn said, “Forget it. It doesn’t matter anymore.”

Monica bit her lips tightly so she would not cry out loud, yet her tears kept falling because her heart hurt like hell.

However, Finn did not seem to feel it.

“Stay away from me in the future,” Finn said. He did not seem to have the patience to talk to Monica anymore.

Hence, he turned around and left.

Monica watched as Finn’s cold silhouette moved further away from her. Seeing that, her tears flowed even harder, and she shouted at Finn, “Finn, do you love me?”

Finn did not stop.

He got into his car and drove past Monica’s side.

Monica squatted down and hugged her body while crying sadly.

She could not remember how many times she had cried for Finn.

Every time she had a conflict with him, she would feel heartbroken. It was as if her entire heart had exploded and shattered to pieces.

She did not know how long she was crying in the car park.

Many cars were coming and going, and those who did not know probably thought she had some terminal illness.

After she cried, she picked up her crutches and left the hospital.

As she sat in the taxi, her face was extremely pale.

The moment the driver saw her appearance, he could not help but comfort her. “Miss, you’re still young. Don’t take it too hard. Any illness can be cured.”

Monica glanced at the driver and forced herself to smile. However, as she smiled, tears flowed out again.

Her illness was very difficult to cure.

When she returned home, she lay on her big bed.

She stared at the ceiling with tears flowing down the corners of her eyes, wetting her pillow.

She thought, ‘I should just cry myself to death and forget it all.’

Just then, her phone rang.

Monica took a look at the incoming call. She did not want to pick it up, but she did anyway.

Then, she heard Michael’s concerned voice. “Are you feeling better?”

Monica did not speak because if she did, he would be able to hear the choking in her voice.

“Monica?” Michael was always very gentle to her.

“Yeah,” Monica replied.

“I didn’t dare to call you because I was afraid I’d disturb your sleep. Are you up now? Have you eaten lunch?” Michael asked her.

“Yes.” Monica tried her best to calm herself down. “You don’t have to worry about me. I’ll take care of myself.”

“The main thing is that you scared me when you were drunk last night. It’s good that you’re fine now.” Michael seemed to be relieved. “By the way, I prepared some honey for you at home. You can mix it with water and drink it. It will make your stomach feel much better.”

“Okay.”

“In that case, have a good rest. I’m hanging up now.”

“Michael,” Monica called out to him.

“Hm?” Michael’s tone was gentle.

“How long... do we need to be together?” Monica asked him.

Michael’s face turned icy cold.

However, his tone was still the same. “Have I put you in a difficult position?”

“I’m afraid Finn will never forgive me again.” Monica did not hide anything from Michael.

She really trusted that man unconditionally.

“Do you want me to explain it to him for you?”

“No need.” Monica quickly rejected him.

Finn definitely would not listen to Michael’s explanation.

“I’m sorry, Monica.” Michael made himself seem very guilty.

“No.” Monica quickly said, “I don’t blame you. I helped you willingly.”

“I can’t agree for us to split immediately because...” Michael wanted to say something but hesitated.
