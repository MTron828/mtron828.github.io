Chapter 1560: Monica Gets Jealous

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“That’s my problem to deal with.”

“Monica—I’

“Finn, since when have you decided to meddle in my affairs?” Monica suddenly lost her temper.

Finn pursed his lips and said, “In that case, I’ll get the hotel to pack some breakfast. You can have it when you’re hungry.”

“I said I don’t want to eat.” Monica was very angry.

Finn did not dare to provoke her. After all, pregnant women were superior. Moreover, he did not have an identity yet.

Seeing Finn silent, Monica’s mood worsened. What did he mean by he had changed? He was still the same; he would not take the initiative at all.

At 10 a.m., Monica and her group arrived at the lobby, where Wendy was waiting for them.

When Wendy saw them, she quickly went forward and greeted them warmly, “Director Cardellini, Mr. Hayes, Mr. Jones, this way please.”

Monica seemed to glance at Wendy, and Wendy noticed it too. However, when she looked back, she thought it was her mind playing tricks on her.

She respectfully invited them into the car. As usual, the bosses were in one car while the secretaries were in another.

After Monica sat in the car, she turned her head to take a look, and her eyes suddenly paused. The person in charge of the other company seemed to have noticed Monica’s gaze as well.

He smiled and said, “It seems like Mr. Jones and Ms. Hansen have quite a good relationship.”

Monica looked away, but Brandon looked out curiously. He saw Finn and Wendy walking together, and instead of getting into the car, they chatted and laughed as they walked to the side.

Brandon could not help but laugh. He even deliberately said, “Mr. Jones is really popular with the ladies.”

Monica glared at Brandon.

The other party’s manager echoed, “He’s so handsome. It’s normal for him to attract young girls.”

“That’s true,” Brandon quickly said.

The car drove steadily down the street. Unexpectedly, after getting on the highway, there was an accident that happened, and the traffic was at a standstill.

The person in charge kept apologizing for the delay.

Monica said nonchalantly, “It’s just an accident. You don’t have to be so polite.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, because she did not eat much in the morning, she was starting to feel hungry. Once she was hungry, she would feel nauseous again. After all, there were still many differences between being pregnant and not being pregnant.

At that moment, Monica could not say it out loud. After all, they were quite a

distance away from the rest stops. If she said it, it would only make the other party feel more guilty and put him in a difficult position.

Just as she planned to endure it, someone suddenly knocked on the car window. Monica turned her head and saw Finn outside the car door.

She winded down the window and saw Finn pass her a pastry and a bottle of milk. “Eat something.”

Monica pursed her lips. Why would Finn have pastries?

“I just went to ask. The traffic should last for another half an hour. Since you didn’t eat much for breakfast, you should fill your stomach first. Otherwise, you’ll feel nauseous again,” Finn said.

Monica took it. After all, she could not starve herself. After Finn gave her the food, he returned to the car behind her while she ate silently.

The person in charge could not help but tease, “Mr. Jones is really good at taking care of people. If you didn’t introduce him as your secretary, I would have thought that he was your…”

He did not say, husband. After all, there were some jokes that could not be made.

The person in charge changed the topic. “No wonder he didn’t get into the car with Ms. Hansen just now. It turns out that he was preparing pastries for me.”

Monica chewed on the pastry and paused for a second. Suddenly, for some reason, a warm feeling filled her heart..
