Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Jeanne, I know your true identity!” Quinn approached Jeanne and whispered.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered as she looked straight at Quinn and tried her best to remain calm.

“All of your identities!” Quinn added.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Quinn did not seem to want a response from Jeanne either, and with a smile on her lips, she left.

Jeanne could not figure out what Quinn did all that for. To show off that she knew a lot of things about her?

Her eyes moved slightly.

In fact, she did not need to care about it because her identity was not something she had to keep secret. It meant nothing to Jeanne that Quinn knew.

The only thing she was unhappy about now was that Kingsley had asked her to accept Quinn.

In the end, she dialed Kingsley’s number.

When the call connected, it was as if he had expected that she would call and interrogate him. “Warren forced me.”

Before Jeanne could ask, Kingsley had confessed the truth.

Jeanne swallowed what she was about to say and forced herself to adjust her emotions. “What’s his intention?”

“He said he wants to help you take control of the Lawrence Enterprise faster because he’s not satisfied with our current progress,” Kingsley said in a cold tone. “But I don’t think that’s the case. He’s doing that because he doesn’t trust us.”

“Is that so?” Jeanne snickered Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Probably.” Kingsley nodded. “But it’s not important.”

Jeanne frowned, thinking, ‘What’s important to Kingsley?’

“After all, Quinn is not your match.”

“You think too highly of me.” Jeanne said sarcastically, “Although I don’t know Quinn very well, I know she’s different from Melody. Melody is competitive, and her desires are all displayed on her face, so dealing with Melody is easy. As long as we trigger her desires, she will do something out of control, and it’s easy to subdue her. As for Quinn, having grown up in the Sanders for so many years, her abilities are obviously astonishing, but she lacks the edge. Did the president keep her hidden because he doesn’t like her, or is she too shrewd?”

Jeanne paused for a moment before coming to a conclusion, “I believe it’s the former.”

“I agree with you.” Kingsley nodded.

“When did you know that Quinn wanted to join Lawrence Enterprise?” Jeanne asked.

“Just now.” Kingsley said bluntly, “If I had known in advance, I wouldn’t have caught you off guard.”

Sometimes, Kingsley could annoy Jeanne with what he said to her, but she never doubted the authenticity of his words!

“Actually, you don’t have to care too much about Quinn. Just do whatever you need to. The purpose of her joining Lawrence Enterprise is, at most, to monitor your every move. As long as we’re on the same page as the Sanders, she won’t make things difficult for you.”

“I know.” Jeanne nodded.

“Are you feeling a little disappointed?” Kingsley suddenly asked.

Jeanne was stunned for a moment.

Then, she smiled. “What do I need to be disappointed about?”

“That Warren doesn’t trust you.”

“I’m not disappointed.” Jeanne said indifferently, “What’s there to care about?”

“You’re more open-minded than I thought.”

“I’m not open-minded. I just understand certain things.”

Over the years, she had understood it all and even knew what she had to do.

“Let’s not talk about it anymore.” Jeanne rubbed her sore shoulders. “I need to continue with the interview.”

“Oh, right. Did you meet K01?”

“I did, and I almost didn’t recognize him,” Jeanne replied. “If I didn’t know his real name, I would have forgotten that he actually looked like this.”

“I sent the best person I have to your side. You should know why.”

Of course, she knew.

It was because there would be a lot of danger.

She said, “You don’t have to protect me. From the moment I stepped into Harken, I never thought I would be able to escape unscathed.”

“Well, I did.” Kingsley suddenly became serious.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

“I’ve thought about having you come back unscathed.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Kingsley had always thought that she had been deeply hurt by her relationships, be it family or love. Hence, he was always afraid that she would be consumed by anger.

In reality, Kingsley had unknowingly given her a lot of warmth.

She said, “Okay.”

She just could not get sentimental about Kingsley because that man was both good and evil.
