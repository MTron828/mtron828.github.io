Chapter 771: Jenifer Exposed, Utterly Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When Nox received Jeanne’s message, he was in the car with Edward, heading to their destination.

He looked at the message and was stunned for half a second before turning back to Edward. “Your wife is looking for me.”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

“She wants me to take Jasmine to Lawrence Enterprise,” Nox said.

“Alright.” Edward nodded, agreeing without any questions.

Nox did not say much either. Anyway, Edward had said it before that he would fulfill all of Jeanne’s requests.

Nox, however, was really afraid that he would one day receive Jeanne’s order to kill Edward.

Nevertheless, he got out of the car.

They had just left the Swan family’s manor, so it would only take him a few minutes to get home by taxi.

He went straight to Purple Pavilion Garden.

Fortunately, it was a working day, so Edward and Eden were not at home. Although Belle was there, it did not make much of a difference.

Seeing Nox’s sudden appearance, Belle was a little puzzled.

“Aren’t you Edward’s men? Why are you here?” Belle said sarcastically.

Nox glanced at Belle.

He did not have time to argue with that woman as Jeanne had just sent him a message asking him to hurry up.

Hence, he asked bluntly, “Where’s Jasmine?”

“Looking for Jasmine? What are you doing here looking for my daughter-in-law? Nox, where are your manners?” Belle did not care about Nox.

Similarly, Nox could not be bothered to argue with Belle, so he went straight upstairs.

“What are you doing? How dare a servant barge into my place? Where do you think this is? Atop him!” Belle ordered the people around her.

The servants immediately stopped Nox.

However, those people were not Nox’s match, and he pried open a way out from him in a few moves.

Seeing how aggressive Nox was, Belle didn’t dare to step forward. She knew Nox’s temper. If he really got angry, he would not even care about his own family, and she did not want to suffer.

She would settle the score with the old man later.

Nox searched Purple Pavilion Garden for a long time before he found Jasmine. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The moment Nox found Jasmine, he was shocked.

He had heard that Jasmine had made Eden a cuckold and knew that Jasmine would not have a good life in the Swans. However, he did not expect that Jasmine would be in such a miserable state. She was locked up in a servant’s room by Eden’s family with nothing inside, and the food in front of her was rancid. The moment he barged in, she started to take off her clothes numbly. Under her ripped clothes, there were hideous bruises on her body.

Nox dragged Jasmine away.

Jasmine staggered two steps and did not resist. It was as if she did not have her own thoughts anyway and followed Nox out.

Having told Teddy to drive a car over for him, Nox then pushed Jasmine into the car and left.

Belle also felt baffled by Nox’s actions.

After some thought, she decided to call her son. “Eden.”

“Yes.” Eden was not at home either.

After leaving Lawrence Enterprise, he started working for a subsidiary company under the Swans but managed by Edward. Of course, he did not hold any important positions. However, the most important thing now was to perform well and regain his grandfather’s confidence in him.

“Nox has suddenly taken Jasmine away–”

“What?” Eden immediately threw a fit. “Why didn’t you stop him?!”

“I-I wanted to stop him, but I couldn’t. You didn’t see Nox was just now, but I was afraid I would be beaten to death if I got close,” Belle quickly explained.

“Why didn’t you call me earlier?”

“It’s just Jasmine. I didn’t think she was important enough to disturb you from your work!

“Mom, you’re going to get me killed!” Flustered and exasperated, Eden asked, “How long has she been gone?”

“She left not long ago.”

Eden gritted his teeth.

By then, he could not catch up. Hence, he hung up the phone abruptly and called Michael.

At that moment, the two of them were watching Jenifer’s live stream. After Joshua’s operation failed last night, the first thing they thought of was to push all the blame onto Jeanne. Therefore, early this morning, while Jeanne was unprepared, they told Jenifer to hold a press conference to denounce Jeanne’s crimes.

Everything was going smoothly.

As long as Joshua insisted that it was Jeanne’s doing, coupled with the fact that Jeanne had a motive for the crime and that Finn and Miles had appeared in the middle of the night, there were reasons to suspect that the matter was related to Jeanne. Then, Jeanne would not be able to escape the blame.

Eden was having a good time.

However, he did not expect his mother to say that Jasmine had been taken away.
