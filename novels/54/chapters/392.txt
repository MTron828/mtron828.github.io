Chapter 393: Finn Awakens, and I Want to Give Him a Child!

In South Hampton City Central Hospital, Monica woke up in a state of shock.

She opened her eyes and looked at the unfamiliar yet familiar surroundings. For a few seconds, she did not react.

“Monica, you’re finally awake.” A familiar voice sounded from beside her.

Monica turned her head and saw her mother and father, Ruby and Gary. Both of them looked at her with extremely concerned eyes. At that moment, they did not dare say anything as they were afraid they would scare her.

Monica’s eyes moved. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Then, the image of Finn’s miserable appearance appeared in her mind.

It was at that moment that her eyes turned red. She tried to hold in it, but her tears eventually fell.

The sight of her crying shocked Ruby and Gary.

Ruby quickly wiped away Monica’s tears. “What’s wrong? What’s wrong? Are you in pain? Is your ankle hurting a lot?”

Her ankle was incredibly swollen.

It was indeed painful, but the pain in her body was nothing compared to the pain in her heart.

She just kept on crying as she looked at her parents’ anxious and heartbroken expressions.

She said, “Mom, is Finn in a vegetative state?”

......

Gary and Ruby were stunned for a second, speechless.

At that moment, they remained silent.

Did that mean he had not woken up?

Monica cried even more.

She did not know any other way to relieve the pain in her heart or how she could accept that fact.

Suddenly, she found herself really useless. Other than crying, she could not seem to find a way to change her fate.

However, her crying frightened Ruby again.

She hurriedly said, “No, no. I saw that Finn had woken up. He’s in the intensive care unit. The doctor said that his injuries are very serious and that he needs to be observed for a few more days.”

Impossible.

Monica did not believe it at all. She thought that her parents were lying to her.

As if having noticed her daughter’s distrust, Ruby quickly explained, “Finn really has woken up. The doctor also said that it was a miracle.”

“Mom,” Monica called out to her.

“I’m here. I’m here,” Ruby quickly replied.

“I want to see Finn,” Monica said bluntly.

She did not have much hope, but she wanted to see him.

Even if he became a vegetable, she still wanted to be with him for the rest of her life not because she owed him anything but because she loved him.

After that, Monica struggled and tried to get up from the bed.

“Hey, be careful.” Ruby quickly supported her. “The doctor said that the degree of your fracture is very serious, so you shouldn’t put weight on it. Once you’re fully awake, let me take you to take an x-ray to see how serious the fracture is.”

“I want to see Finn.” Monica was very sure.

She looked at Ruby with determination.

“Okay, okay, okay. Let’s go see Finn first.” Ruby doted on her daughter.

At that moment, she was afraid that she would hurt her daughter even if she spoke a little louder.

Ruby helped Monica up, with Gary supporting her from the other side. He tried his best to be careful not to hurt her ankle again.

The two of them then put Monica in the wheelchair.

While Ruby pushed Monica to the intensive care unit, Monica was actually very nervous.

She was afraid that Finn did not wake up and that her parents were lying to her.

After a while, she felt relieved. She told herself that it did not matter even if Finn did not wake up. At the very least, he was alive.

Just like that, she tormented herself and endured the suffering in her heart until her parents pushed her to the glass window of the intensive care unit.

Finn was lying inside, still wearing an oxygen mask. His body was still filled with tubes, and he was still not moving.

She knew it.

She knew that would be the case.

With that, her tears fell again.

She looked at Finn, looking all weak and miserable. Even if she was mentally prepared, she still felt upset and heartbroken at how he was lying there motionlessly.

If Finn did not save her, all of that would not have happened.

She was just going to get abused. Why did Finn have to sacrifice her life to protect her?

Her tears kept falling.

Beside her, Ruby’s heart ached.

Monica always said that she did not like Finn. If she really did not like him, would she be so upset?
