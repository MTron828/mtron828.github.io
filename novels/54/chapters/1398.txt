Chapter 1399: Finn Drinking His Sorrow Away

“I didn’t meet Mr. Winter’s requirements, so I’ll resign,” Shelly said frankly.

She knew Nox too well, and Nox had never made things easy for her.

She figured it was her fault for being brought back to the Winters, and that was why Nox had been trying to take revenge on her and torture her all these years.

When Nox heard Shelly’s words, he still felt disgusted. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Shelly never seemed to show him any weakness, and it was the same in the past. Although he had always forced her to do many things, he could tell that she was unwilling to do them. On top of that, she never knew how to please him — not that she could please him anyway.

His dislike for her was deep-rooted. He even knew very well that he was deliberately targeting her today.

However, so what if he was targeting her? She used the money he gave her for studies on plastic surgery! When he saw Shelly’s unrecognizable face, he was furious.

Danny chose to remain silent when he heard what Shelly said, even though he thought it was a pity.

“In that case, I’ll take my leave.” Shelly bowed politely.

Then, she turned around and left without waiting for anyone to agree. She was very calm and composed, as if she would not miss the job.

In reality, Shelly had put a lot of effort into the job. After all, a tour guide would have more freedom in terms of time, and she would not have to leave early and return late like her current part-time job.

Forget it. She did not have much expectations for Nox anyway.

Just like that, Shelly left under everyone’s watchful eyes. It was as if she was not fired by the boss, but she was firing the boss.

Looking at her back, Nox’s expression turned even uglier.

Danny did not even dare to breathe loudly. After interacting with Nox a few times, he knew that Nox was difficult to deal with.

The atmosphere was tense and awkward.

Nox said coldly, “I’m not satisfied with the inspection this time. I’ll come back and check on you again in a week. If the inspection fails, the trial opening will be postponed indefinitely.”

Danny felt helpless.

What the hell did he do wrong? How much did Young Master Winter hate girls with plastic surgery? It was too difficult for him to find a completely natural one in this day and age.

After saying that, Nox left in the speedboat he came. From afar, he saw a speedboat that had left arriving at the shore.

Nox’s expression was extremely ugly. He had not seen Shelly for so many years, yet that woman still made him inexplicably angry. In the future, it was best they did not see each other again. Nox calmed himself down for a few seconds before he took out her phone and dialed a number.

“Zoe.”

He really wanted to find someone to calm himself down.

“Why are you calling me at this hour? What’s wrong? Did you miss me?” The voice on the other end was gentle. “How did you know that I was thinking about you too?”

The coldness on Nox’s face gradually softened. “Let’s have dinner together tonight.”

“Tonight?”

“What’s the matter?” Nox raised his eyebrows.

“I have a company dinner tonight. As the leader of my department, I can’t miss it.” The other party was in a difficult position.

Nox’s expression darkened even more. He hated being rejected the most.

“Can I come over to your place after dinner tonight? Don’t be angry.” Zoe tried to please him. “I’ll be yours for the entire night, okay?”

Nox obviously knew what Zoe was talking about.

He and Zoe had been dating for the sake of marriage, so they had slept together very early on. Although they were not officially living together, they would spend a night together from time to time.

At that thought, it crossed his mind that he had not done it with Zoe for a few days.

He did not know when he had started to get used to having sex once every few days with a woman, but he refused to admit that he was old.

He said, “Alright.”

It turned out he was really at the age where he would not be too willful.

“When you’re home tonight, wash up and wait for me.” Zoe used her gentle voice to say something bold.

Nox smiled faintly. However, because there were people around, he could not say anything flirty. Hence, he said, “I’ll wait for you.”

Of course, Zoe was smart enough to know that Nox was not alone and that was why he did not say much.

The call between the two ended very quickly. After it ended, Zoe’s expression changed slightly.

It was not that she did not like Nox..
