Chapter 345: Madam, Missus, Wife, or Jeannie?

She did not answer, but then she heard him laughing.

What was he laughing at? Was he in such a good mood so early in the morning?

On the contrary, she was not in a good mood because she had insomnia!

She knew she was exhausted when even her toes had no strength. However, she just could not fall asleep. Even if she did fall asleep for a while, she would wake up again.

Only then did she hear the sound of steady breathing coming from the person behind her. It was clear that he had had a good sleep.

Still, she did not speak.

The person behind her hugged her a little tighter and said, “Did it hurt?”

Jeanne was stunned.

“Last night,” he added.

Jeanne did not want to recall anything that happened yesterday at all.

“Turn around,” he called out to her, clearly ordering her.

Jeanne did not move. She, too, had her stubbornness and pride.

“I have many ways to make you–”

......

Before he could finish his sentence, Jeanne suddenly turned around.

She secretly cursed him, ‘Beast!’

Then, she looked at Fourth Master Swan in front of her, at his lazy appearance, his messy hair, his frustratingly good-looking cheeks, and his sexy lips.

Her eyes lingered on his lips…

“What are you looking at?” He raised his eyebrows.

Jeanne closed her eyes. “I’m not looking at anything.”

A few deep laughs sounded from beside her.

“I don’t mind you peeping at me.”

She was not peeping at him!

“Jeannie.” He suddenly opened his mouth and called her by her nickname.

Jeanne shuddered. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Can I call you that?” Edward asked her.

Now, she was a little stumped.

“Didn’t you tell me not to call you Ms. Lawrence?” Edward said with a chuckle.

Ms. Lawrence sounded nice.

She was not used to being suddenly called “Jeannie”.

“You don’t like It?” Seeing that she did not answer, Edward said, “What about Madam?”

She was speechless.

“Missus?”

What was the difference between missus and madam?

“Or do you like...” Edward leaned in closer to her as he said, so close that she could feel his warm breath on her cheek.

“Or do you like me to call you wifey?” Edward asked very seriously, wanting to know her opinion.

However, Jeannie felt as if he was deliberately teasing her.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and said, “Jeanne will do.”

She felt more comfortable with him using the name that everyone called her.

“In that case, I’ll call you Jeannie.”

In that case, why the hell did he ask her?

“Are you going to get up, Jeannie?” He suddenly changed the topic.

The way he said “Jeannie” sounded so natural and nice.

There was no feeling of disharmony.

Jeanne suddenly turned around, with her back facing Fourth Master Swan. At that moment, she covered her head in the blanket and said, “I’m not going to get up. I want to sleep for a while longer.”

She had insomnia for most of last night, so she wanted to sleep for a while more.

“It was my fault last night.”

At that, Jeanne blushed and thought, ‘Who said you could talk about last night’s matter?’

“Well, you can sleep for a while more. I’ll accompany you.”

However, she did not want him to accompany her.

“Jeannie, change your sleeping position.” Fourth Master Swan suddenly requested.

Jeanne was unhappy.

How was she supposed to change to a different position and fall asleep?

“Ah.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“It’s not safe,” Edward whispered in her ear.

He… was a beast in disguise.

No!

He was a wolf, a tiger, and a leopard.

Left with no choice, she could only sleep facing Fourth Master Swan.

She closed her eyes and forced herself to sleep again.

Initially, her entire body was aching, but she was too lazy to move. Still, for some reason, she could not fall asleep.

Her face turned red like a tomato at the thought of everything that happened last night.

On the other hand, Edward simply watched as Jeanne’s expression changed from angry to shy.

Then, his slender fingers caressed her face.

Jeanne’s body stiffened, but she did not open her eyes and pretended to be asleep instead.

His kiss landed on her forehead and gently pulled her into his embrace.

Jeanne desperately wanted to protest as she was not used to being hugged like that. However, she knew very well that it was useless to resist.

She might even get herself into… trouble.

Hence, she just lay quietly in Fourth Master Swan’s embrace, thinking that she would not be able to fall asleep again.

In fact, she just wanted to take a nap because last night was very tiring.

However, the moment she heard his steady, powerful heartbeat and felt a sense of safety from his embrace, she eventually fell asleep in a daze.

When she was asleep, there came the sound of even breathing.
