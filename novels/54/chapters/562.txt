“Shelly.” Nox took Shelly’s phone.

However, Shelly was not angry, whereas Eugene and Yara were.

“Nox, you unfilial son. All you know how to do all day is fool around with women. When will you behave? Why do you... Watch me beat you to death!” Eugene immediately had the maid bring him a stick.

Of course, Nox was not stupid enough to wait for his father to beat him. He quickly stood up from the sofa and ran upstairs to his room.

Eugene was exasperated.

Yara was also so angry that she said to her husband, “We must make Nox stop that act of his. He’s already 26 or 27 years old. If this continues, his life will be wasted.”

“Get him married,” Eugene said. “We must immediately arrange for Shelly and Nox to get married.”

Eugene also thought that plan was feasible, so she turned to Shelly and said in a much gentler tone, “Shelly, are you still willing to get married to Nox?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Shelly nodded.

After all, what was there to be unwilling about?

Back then, she had entered this house with the purpose to marry Nox.

“In the future, if Nox continues to act so recklessly after you both are married, I will definitely break his legs,” Yara promised.

Ever since she was young, she had heard quite a lot from them about teaching Nox a lesson.

However, other than Grandpa Nox, who really knew how to teach Nox a lesson, Nox’s parents had never beaten him before.

Shelly did not expose them at that moment. Instead, she smiled and said, “Thank you, Mom.”

Eugene patted Shelly’s head. “If only Nox was half as obedient as you.”

In fact, she was not obedient either.

She just knew since she was young that if she wanted to live a better life, she had to live at the whim of others.

After that, she stood up from the sofa. “I’m going upstairs to do my homework.”

“Dinner will be ready soon.”

“I’ll be down in a while,” Shelly agreed.

Yara nodded.

With that, Shelly went upstairs, but she was not going to do any homework.

She was going to find Nox.

Although she had been living under the same roof as Nox, they had never interacted. When she was home, he might not be in, or he might be doing sports…

She knocked on Nox’s door.

Seeing that it was Shelly, Nox glared at her. “What’s the matter?”

“Mom said we should get married as soon as possible.”

“In your dreams! I’ll never marry you! Why are you so stubborn?” Nox was irritated by Shelly.

Shelly, on the contrary, was very calm as she could never get angry with Nox. If she did, she would probably die of anger long ago.

She said, “What do you think is wrong with me? I’ll try my best to change.”

“You’re not good-looking, your figure isn’t good, your personality isn’t good, and nothing of you is good.” Nox wore a look of disgust on his face.

“I can get plastic surgery and change my looks to whatever type you like.”

Nox widened his eyes and looked at Shelly, not quite believing what Shelly had said!

Shelly continued, “I can sculpt or shape my body to what you like. I’m on a diet now. If you pay attention, you’ll notice I’ve lost a lot of weight.”

Nox frowned.

It was true. He had never really paid any attention to her.

Looking at her now, the loose t-shirt Shelly was wearing looked loose, her face seemed to have shrunk, and her exposed arms also looked much thinner.

However, who said a woman had to be thin to look good?

He said to Shelly firmly, “I like curvy women, those with big boobs and butts.”

“Okay.” Shelly nodded.

“Okay? Even if your figure is good, I won’t be interested. Shelly, I’m just not interested in you. What don’t you understand?”

“What do you need to be interested in me? To go to bed with you?” Shelly asked.

“...Shelly, can’t you be more reserved? Damn, I’ve watched you grow up, so you’re just a little kid to me. You’re the kind of kid who makes me think I’m a monster for sleeping with you. Do you think I’ll marry you?”

“I’m not young anymore,” Shelly retorted.

“Forget it. I can’t explain it to you clearly.” Nox waved his hand. “In any case, there’s no way we’ll get married. Even if my parents beat me to death, I won’t marry you.”

“But I want to marry you.” Shelly expressed her intention.

“What do you see in me? Do you want me to change my profession?” Now, Nox was furious. “I’m so dirty. I’ve had sex with so many women. Aren’t you afraid of getting a disease!”

Shelly looked at him.

“I can’t be bothered to talk to you.” Nox then slammed the door shut.
