“If he’s just unconscious somewhere, there’s no way for his watch to have lost its GPS signal. The only possibility is…” Nox looked at Finn.

Finn nodded. “That’s right. There’s a 90 percent chance that he was taken away by the Hills.

“Let’s go to the Delta Islands.” Nox made a prompt decision.

“Let’s wait for a moment.” Finn said, “Have you forgotten that we have spies in the Delta Islands? Let’s ask them first if they saw Kingsley return. Don’t act rashly.” Finn reminded Nox.

Nox smacked his forehead. He was a little too excited.

With that, he quickly contacted the other party.

After receiving a reply, he said to Finn, “They said some of the assassins have returned, and they brought back a lot of corpses. However, they didn’t see Edward and Jeanne.”

Finn heaved a sigh of relief.

Although they did not find Edward’s body here, it didn’t mean that he was not taken away by the Hills.

Who knew if Jeanne might have taken Edward’s body away?

Nox continued, “They said Kingsley also hasn’t returned yet.”

Finn frowned.

Logically speaking, Kingsley should have returned by now. If he had not, where did he go?

Was he here?

“Did you think of something?” Nox was a little excited.

“Tell them to keep an eye on when Kingsley returns while we search here first. I think since Kingsley hasn’t returned to the Delta Islands, it’s highly possible that he’s still here. Perhaps something has delayed him.”

Nox nodded. “But where are we going to find them?”

“This place is rather remote, so most people won’t come here. Kingsley couldn’t have left by walking. Let’s go and see if there are any tire marks. If we follow them, it shouldn’t be hard to find them.”

“You’re still the smarter one,” Nox said bluntly.

Finn was just calmer.

Most of the time, Nox would let his emotions get the better of him.

“Order our men to search for Fourth Master. If they find anything, don’t alert the enemy. I suspect that even if the Fourth Master was taken away by the Hills, he might not be safe.” Finn’s expression was serious.

“You mean to say that the Hills didn’t save but kidnapped Edward?”

“Otherwise, Jeanne would have contacted us,” Finn said confidently. “Furthermore, Fourth Master’s watch has disappeared.”

“F*ck.” Nox cursed. “I knew that Edward would be killed by Jeanne one day.”

“Don’t jump to conclusions before we find out the truth. We’ll talk about it after we find him.” Finn did not want to speculate too much for the time being.

As for Jeanne, he really could not figure her out, and he did not want to waste time thinking about it.

Nox was not one to dwell on something, so he quickly ordered everyone to search for Edward.

After that, they returned to the car and left M Underground Organization’s base.

They had just gotten into the car when Finn’s phone suddenly rang.

Finn glanced at the caller ID, and Nox also took a look.

“F*ck. I thought it was that heartless Jeanne,” Nox cursed.

At that moment, she probably really wanted to receive Jeanne’s call. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Finn answered the call, “Director.”

“How’s your recovery?” The other person seemed very friendly.

“Wery good,” he replied.

“Then, you can decide when you want to come back to work at the hospital.” the hospital director said in a friendly tone.

Did that mean the negative press about him previously was considered over?

He said, “I have some personal matters to settle these few days, but I’ll come to work after I’m done.

“How long will it take?” the other party asked.

“About a week.”

“That long?”

“Yes.”

“Oh, alright then.” The other party was also helpless. “In that case, hurry back to work after you’re done. There are many patients waiting for you.” The hospital director did not make things difficult for him.

Moreover, he could not make things difficult for Finn either.

With Finn’s medical skills, he could go anywhere.

“Yes,” Finn responded before he hung up.

At that moment, he opened Whatsapp, thinking there would be some updates about the hospital in the department’s staff group.

Since the hospital director had called him, the department should be pretty busy.

He planned to ask about how they were doing. However, when he saw the group message, he paused.

Having noticed his strange behavior, Nox asked, “What’s wrong? Did something happen at the hospital?”

Finn returned to his senses. “No.”

At that moment, he immediately closed the group chat.

“You have a lot of money, so why do you want to be a doctor? Don’t you find it tiring?” Nox complained.

Finn did not answer.

“I really don’t understand you,” Nox muttered.

Finn looked out of the car window.
