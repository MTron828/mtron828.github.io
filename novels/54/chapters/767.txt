Chapter 768: Jenifer Playing Tricks, An Exciting Fight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The reporter seemed to have been convinced by Jenifer.

“Yesterday, when Joshua was arrested, I went to see him as soon as I heard the news. At first, Joshua was unwilling to admit that Jeanne was the one who ordered him to do it. He gritted his teeth and said that he was possessed and wanted to harass Ms. Sanders. I knelt down and begged him, and only then did he reveal it because he saw that I was devastated. Everyone, take a look at this. This is the bruise on my knee when I knelt down to Joshua yesterday.” As she spoke, Jenifer rolled up her pants, and as expected, it revealed the hideous bruises on her knees.

“I really didn’t want to expose Jeanne, but I’m at my wits ‘end. I have no choice. I can’t watch my son be destroyed. Everyone knows that the Lawrences only have one son, Joshua. If anything were to happen to him, the Lawrences will truly be done for, and I’ll be ashamed to face the Lawrences’ ancestors!”

At that point, she was already sobbing.

It was as sad as it could get.

The reporters at the scene all began to comfort her. They even said that the law was fair and that it would definitely give her justice.

At that moment, the entire press conference was filled with voices of condemnation against Jeanne and pity for Jenifer.

Not only that, but a few live broadcasts were present too.

A large number of ‘righteous people’ instantly appeared on the internet, jointly requesting the review agency to conduct a thorough investigation on Jeanne and to give Jenifer justice.

Jeanne’s cell phone rang several times, and they were all from Monica.

Monica’s greatest pleasure now was probably to read the gossip news, so she probably saw it immediately.

However, Jeanne ended the call as it was more important for her to deal with the matter at hand.

She put down her phone and walked straight to Jenifer.

Amy instinctively tugged at President Lawrence, but she could not, or perhaps she did not dare to stop her. She was a little scared and did not know how President Lawrence was going to deal with the current situation. Of course, she absolutely could not believe that it was President Lawrence’s plan as President Lawrence could never do such a thing!

Amy covered her eyes, afraid to look at the scene.

Jeanne’s sudden appearance had indeed caused a stir in the venue.

Jenifer looked at Jeanne and became even more agitated. For a second, Jenifer almost fainted.

Before Jeanne could speak, a lighter suddenly appeared out of nowhere. However, it did not hit Jeanne, but it landed at her feet probably because it was not aimed properly.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

She did not expect the reporters would be so irrational to throw things at her.

What she did not know was that when she appeared in front of the camera, the live broadcast video had already gone viral. The words “Get Jeanne Out of Lawrence Enterprise and Out of Our Sight. We Only Want To See Her in Prison” were written on the screen.

Jeanne had become the worst woman on the internet. It was so bad that it made one boil with anger.

She looked at the lighter under her feet indifferently. Then, she raised her head and said with an intimidating presence, “I can stand here now because I can tell you confidently that I didn’t do anything Jenifer said!”

She did not know if they all had been brainwashed by Jenifer or that a lot of the reporters here were deliberately hired to stir up trouble.

One of the reporters said, “The truth is right in front of you. What makes you so confident? If you say anything now, you’ll only embarrass yourself.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You’re journalists, and your job is to report the news truthfully and spread it. As for what’s the truth, what’s right or wrong, and who committed the crime, that’s for the judicial authorities to decide. You should do your part!” Jeanne said imposingly.

Due to Jeanne’s words, the venue fell silent for a few minutes.

Even the live stream’s comments stopped for more than ten seconds.

Even though she was still bombarded by attacks, seeing that the reporters had quieted down, Jeanne sat down.

At that moment, Jenifer suddenly knelt on the ground. “Jeanne, I’m begging you to let Joshua go! I’m begging you. Joshua is still so young. He can’t just go to jail like this. Can’t you just admit that you were the one who ordered Joshua to do this? I’ve asked my lawyer. Although Joshua is an accomplice, he’s not the mastermind, so many of his charges can be reduced. Jeanne, I promise to give you all of Joshua’s shares. Can you please stop framing Joshua? From now on, Joshua and I will leave Lawrence Enterprise– no, leave South Hampton City and never appear in front of you again, okay?”
