Chapter 433: Monica’s Affectionate Confession

Monica was actually happy as Mrs. Jones.

“You’re such an outstanding person. Why are you feeling inferior? Is it just because my family has money? That’s nothing to be proud of! Look at Jeanne. She’s the richest woman in South Hampton City. I’m nothing compared to her.” Monica didn’t hold back and spoke her mind.

At that moment, Finn was actually rendered speechless by Monica.

“Although it’s true that I was rather blessed in the physical department,” Monica said to change the topic.

Finn could not look at Monica through the lenses of a normal person.

He stared at her.

Monica got a little annoyed by Finn’s gaze and said, “I wasn’t referring to my face.”

Of course, she was actually rather pretty.

If it wasn’t for Jeanne’s overwhelmingly good looks, she would be a great beauty.

It was just that Jeanne was too gorgeous that her looks overshadowed Monica.

However, Monica was used to that fact as she grew up together with Jeanne.

Moreover, she had an advantage. Her body figure was exceptional in every way.

“Finn Jones, what’s with your gaze?” Monica looked at his nonchalant, unhappy expression.

......

That guy really didn’t know how to appreciate what he has. Her perfect figure was all for his eyes!

“You don’t believe me, do you?” Monica said angrily.

Finn averted his gaze from her immediately.

“Fine, I’ll take off my clothes for you to see!” Monica enunciated each word.

Finn’s body shuddered. He knew very well that Monica was a person of her word.

He turned his head and watched as Monica took off her clothes with urgency.

Finn grabbed her hand.

Monica frowned.

There was still an IV drip attached to his hand, while his other hand was fixed to all sorts of devices.

“Don’t move.” Monica looked at his IV drip nervously.

“Don’t take off your clothes,” Finn said.

“I’m just showing it to you. You’re not required to do anything.” Monica said.

“I don’t need to see it,” replied Finn.

“No, you must,” Monica retorted.

“Monica Cardellini, can’t you be a little more proper?”

“It’s all yours anyway. You have to see it sooner or later, right? Why can’t I show you my body now?”

“...”

Was Monica doing this on purpose?

She’s deliberately seducing him when he can’t do anything.

“Let go of my hand.” Monica pushed Finn away.

Finn’s body was still quite weak so Monica managed to get out of his grasp just like that.

Monica looked at his IV drip and made sure that there was nothing wrong with it. Then, she went back to taking off her clothes.

Finn was in a bad mood. He knew that Monica was anxious.

But she should at least wait until he has recovered.

He said, “There’s no need to take off your clothes. I know.”

Monica paused. She looked up at Finn.

“I said I know. So there’s no need to take off your clothes.” Finn’s voice was louder now and his face turned red.

“Did you peep at me when I showered?”

Finn was about to cough out blood, figuratively speaking.

He calmly said, “It was when I did the laundry at home.”

‘Oh.?That?time.’ Monica recalled.

“Are you sure you got a clear view in such a short time?” Monica asked.

“...”

Finn definitely saw it clearly.

And it wasn’t just that one time.

There was that other time when she was drunk and called Michael Ross’ name.

Finn had helped her remove her clothes then.

His face was red. And now it was an even brighter shade of red.

“Finn, what are you thinking about?” Monica smiled evilly.

Finn didn’t answer.

“Are you thinking about something perverted?”

Finn was rendered speechless by Monica.

She didn’t have the slightest bit of reserve.

He said, “Weren’t you confessing?”

“I was.” Monica seemed to have suddenly remembered. Thinking it over, she felt that something was wrong. “Didn’t I finish my confession? We went on to talk about you.”

“I’m done talking,” Finn replied. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Just one sentence? You think you’re not good enough for me, so that explains all these years of your indifference to me?” Monica looked at Finn.

Finn was still such a hateful man.

“I am sorry,” Finn apologized.

“Don’t be sorry.”

Finn frowned.

“I’d be happier to hear the other three words.” Monica smiled.

Finn’s frown deepened.

Monica had never thought of making things difficult for Finn. He’s the type that won’t be able to say anything mushy even if he was beaten to death.

Actually, Monica felt relieved when she heard Finn had said that he didn’t think he was good enough for her, and that was why he had treated her like that all these years.

It was because he felt he wasn’t good enough that he hid his feelings as he didn’t have the confidence, and that was why he pretended to be cold to her. It was because of these reasons that they grew further and further apart, and not because they didn’t love each other.

Now that they were in love, they could grow closer again.

What should she do?

She wanted to kiss Finn again.

Monica looked at him and her gaze fell on his lips.

She could no longer hold back.

Monica took the initiative and leaned toward him.

She felt that she should make up for everything that they had missed out on during their three years of marriage.

They clearly had feelings for each other.

Yet, they had suppressed it for the past three years.

Her lips pressed against Finn’s lips.

The words that Finn had been mustering to say were blurted out by Monica. And just like that, his lips were roughly sealed by hers.

He was trying to muster up the words to say to Monica, so he was caught off guard by her. The moment he opened his mouth to speak had turned into a deep kiss.

And... They savored the moment.
