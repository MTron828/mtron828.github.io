Chapter 666: The Shareholder Meeting, A Huge Catfight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“But–”

“What I’m worried about is your cousin’s character. If he’s anything like his family, it would be really troublesome.”

“Although my cousin is a distant relative and I haven’t had much contact with him, when they asked me to introduce my cousin to your family, I had a chat with him and also secretly got someone to investigate him. My cousin is different from his family. Having gone through higher education, he’s very sensible. Since he isn’t here to cause trouble today, I think he doesn’t approve of this method, or maybe these people came without my cousin knowing.”

“Since you say so, I believe you.” Monica said, “In that case, I’ll let my father know.”

“Actually, if your father is worried about how capable my cousin is, he can try him out first. If my cousin performs well, he can carry on. But if he doesn’t, it’s my cousin’s fault for not being capable enough, and my second great-uncle’s family will have nothing to say.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

Then, she took her phone and walked to the side.

Michael turned around and looked at Reese for a second. It was obvious that his evil plan had succeeded.

Monica was on the phone for a long while.

She came back, “My father promised your grandson to come to the company tomorrow for an internship. The internship period is one month. If he can meet the company’s requirements within one month, he can continue to stay and become an official employee of the research team. But if he can’t meet the requirements, he will be fired immediately.”

“You’re not lying to me, are you?” The second great-uncle, who was still lying on the ground, asked Monica.

“If I’m lying to you, you can expose Michael by posting the photos. In any way, it won’t be a disadvantage for you.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The second great-uncle thought about it and realized it was true.

“Will you let my son go after a month, no matter how good or bad his performance is?” The uncle questioned, “What if you purposely say you’ll give my son an internship just to prevent us from exposing Michael? In reality, you’ll kick him out when the internship ends.”

“Uncle, our business is to make a profit, and we would love to have someone who can bring profits to our business. Do you think our business is stupid?”

The uncle and aunt pondered for a while.

After that, they felt they had no other choice but to agree.

“In that case, I’ll get my son to report to Cardellini Enterprise tomorrow.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded and looked at her second great-uncle on the ground. “Why isn’t he getting up then?”

The uncle quickly helped his father up.

After getting up, the second great-uncle’s expression changed, “Monica, I know I’ve made a fool of myself today, but I’m doing this for my grandson, and I pity his loving parents. My grandson has always wanted to join your family’s company, and that was why I was being unreasonable. Please don’t take it to heart. When you and Michael get married, I will definitely give you a big gift.”

Monica was really shocked by the speed at which those people changed their behaviors.

Michael, who did not seem to like them either, said, “Since you’ve gotten what you wanted, hurry up and leave.”

The second great-uncle was no longer angry at Michael’s order to leave. He left happily with his son and daughter-in-law.

Reese stared at their backs and turned to look at Monica. “Monica, thank you so much. First, you helped Michael and were forced to divorce Finn, and now you’re helping us again. I really don’t know what to say–”

“Since I’ve chosen to help Michael, I’ll definitely help him to the end. Furthermore, what happened today was actually a piece of cake. Auntie, don’t take it to heart.” Monica felt that Reese’s feelings were a little too overwhelming, which she could not take.

“Monica, you’re really a good girl. I really regret treating you like that back then...”

“It’s all in the past now.” Monica smiled and distanced herself from her. “About that, I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll head back first.”

“You can leave after dinner.”

“There’s no need.”

Reese still wanted to persuade her to stay, but Michael said, “Alright, Mom. I’ll send Monica back.”

Reese nodded reluctantly.

After Michael and Monica left, the expression on Reese’s face changed.

Monica was an idiot. She could not even take a blow in front of the mother and son. If she found out one day that everything they did was just to get Cardellini Enterprise, she would probably go crazy from anger!

By then, Michael probably would not like Monica anymore!

No matter what, even if she was not the princess of the Sanders, Michael could not marry Monica. That woman was not worthy of such an outstanding son of hers!
