Did Shelly know that he had never been slapped by anyone in his life?

Not even his grandfather had slapped him on the face, yet she did. For that, he wanted to strangle that woman to death, so he grabbed Shelly’s neck.

When Shelly felt a sharp pain in her throat, she knew that she had angered Nox. However, she also knew that if she did not resist, she would die in Nox’s hands, and she could not die — not for Nox, or she was afraid that she would not die in peace.

As such, she started fighting with Nox crazily, with both her fists and legs. It looked very intense.

Nox did not expect Shelly to go crazy, so he suddenly let go of her neck. No matter how angry he was, or even if he really wanted to kill her, he could not kill her.

All he wanted was to scare her, but he did not expect the woman to go crazy, like she wanted to bring him down with her. There were many scratches on his body and face.

“Shelly, that’s enough!” Nox calmed down a little.

Shelly, however, could not calm down.

Enough? She wanted to vent all the grievances she had suffered from Nox in her entire life.

“Shelly, that’s enough. If you don’t calm down, I’ll really kill you!” Nox threatened.

He did not even know how badly Shelly had scratched his body and face.

Shelly could not hear what Nox was saying. All she wanted to do was kill him. She had really had enough of him constantly making her life miserable.

“Shelly!” Nox gritted his teeth.

He then wanted to grab Shelly’s hands and shackle them together, but Shelly seemed to have expected it and dodged.

The moment she dodged, Nox grabbed her clothes. With a strong tug, the buttons on her clothes were all pulled open, exposing Shelly’s upper body.

Once exposed, Nox froze when he saw the dense marks on Shelly’s body. It was as terrifying as it could be, like she had been abused! Every part of her skin was covered in bruises.

However, Shelly continued to go crazy as if she did not notice what had happened. Even when she could sense that the person opposite her was not reacting to her hitting and scratching him anymore, she gradually calmed down.

When she calmed down, she saw that Nox’s face and neck were covered in scratch marks, and his clothes were also wrinkled from her pulling. In any case, he looked like a mess.

She bit her lip lightly. She did not know why she had lost control just now because she rarely lost control of herself.

Suddenly, the two of them fell silent. After a fight, both of them seemed to have calmed down.

Shelly said, ‘You can deduct as much as you want. Actually, I didn’t think you would give me money.”

She did not have much hope for Nox, so she would not be disappointed even if he did not give her the 50,000 dollars.

“This was left behind the night before yesterday?” Nox asked while staring straight at her chest.

Shelly lowered her head. Only then did she realize that her clothes had been torn apart. Just now, she was so angry that her heart was about to explode and did not notice anything.

She quickly covered her body with her clothes.

“Do you feel guilty?” Shelly mocked.

Nox did not answer. If he did not feel guilty, would he have let her go on for so long?

“You should be thinking that I brought this on myself, right? That it serves me right for drugging and seducing you.” Shelly did not need Nox to answer to know what he wanted to say.

Nox’s eyes narrowed.

“Don’t worry, I know my limits. I never thought of getting your sympathy, and I won’t threaten you.” Shelly looked straight at Nox. “My only request is that you stay away from me, okay? Don’t give me any more hope. Don’t give me the chance to set you up again. Just let me give up on you completely, okay?”

Nox knew that Shelly said that on purpose to stop him from bothering her.

Was it because Shelly was too good at scheming or… did the night before have nothing to do with Shelly?

Nox’s silence made Shelly break down.

She had said so much to preserve his ego and dignity while putting herself down. What else did he want?

“Shelly, tell me now. Was it you who drugged me that night?” Nox suddenly asked her calmly..
