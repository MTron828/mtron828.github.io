Chapter 400: The End of Monica and Michael’s Relationship Translation

“So, the Sanders will attack the Swans sooner or later,” Jeanne concluded.

“Not necessarily.” Kingsley was sure in his reply.

Jeanne frowned.

“If the Swans aren’t hiding any orphans and only want to establish themselves in Harken, the Sanders might not attack them. As long as the Swans don’t intend to replace the Sanders, the Sanders can accommodate the Swans. The main point is that if the Sanders fight with the Swans now, it might not end well for the Sanders. It was not easy for them to stabilize their power and rule over Harken, so they wouldn’t want to take any risks. At most, they would let the Swans have their absolute position in the business industry. However, if the Swans are really nurturing the orphan and want to help the orphan take back Harken, it would be a real threat to the Sanders’s political power, and the Sanders would choose to kill the Swans regardless of anything.”

“Haven’t the Sanders found out whether the Swans are supporting the orphan?”Jeanne asked.

“No,” Kingsley replied. “While you were in the Balti Islands over the last few days, after a series of investigations, the Sanders locked onto Finn as the orphan.”

Jeanne gripped her phone tightly. She said, “According to the age, this orphan should be slightly older than Finn.”

“Physically, we can’t tell the difference because they’re only one or two years apart. Moreover, Finn is an orphan and has a close relationship with the Swans.”

“I don’t think so,” Jeanne said bluntly.

From the way Finn interacted with Edward and Nox, Finn did not seem to have such an identity.

Moreover, she believed that if the Swans were really hiding that orphan, it would be impossible for him to be discovered so easily.

Therefore, the people around Edward could not be the Duncans’ last survivor.

“It is indeed not. The Sanders have verified it,” Kingsley affirmed.

......

“Verified?” Jeanne’s expression changed immediately.

“While you and Fourth Master Swan were in the Balti Islands, the Sanders sent people to attack Finn.”

Jeanne’s hand that was holding the phone tightened.

“Actually, it’s very easy to verify the identity of the Duncans’ orphan. As long as we test to see if that person is willing to sacrifice his life, we’ll know. If he bore the responsibility of the Duncans’ empire, the person would choose to protect himself under any circumstances. Hence, the Sanders used Monica to test Finn.”

“The Sanders is really despicable.” Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“No one in power has ever been kind.”

Jeanne acknowledged that statement.

Not only was he not kind, but he was also terrifyingly cruel.

“The Sanders kidnapped Finn and Monica, and then they used the method of raping Monica to see what Finn would do.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth, trying to control her emotions.

“Don’t worry. Monica is fine.” As if he could sense Jeanne’s emotions, Kingsley explained, “Finn used his life to protect Monica.”

“Is Finn dead? “Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

Kingsley said, “I heard he woke up.”

He played it down because, to him, he did not see life as valuable.

“So the Sanders did not kill Finn?” Jeanne was still a little surprised.

Regardless of whether Finn’s identity was suspicious, they could still kill him after verification.

“I thought there was no need to kill Finn, so I told Miles to save him,” Kingsley said.

“You sent someone to save him?” Jeanne was even more surprised.

When did Kingsley become so kind-hearted?

.

To think he was kind enough to care about the lives of others.

“There are two purposes for saving Finn.” Kingsley would not hide anything from Jeanne. “First, Finn is one of Fourth Master Swan’s men. If Fourth Master Swan isn’t dead and comes back to find that something happened to Finn, he will definitely investigate and get to the bottom of it. Once he finds out the truth, he will surely trace it to the Sanders, but I just want to ignite this war ahead of time.”

As expected, Kingsley had his own motives for everything he did.

“Secondly, I did it to get your forgiveness.”

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

“I knew you would find out about the matter at the Balti Islands sooner or later, and I didn’t think of hiding it from you. Even if I said my motive was indeed to make you safer by Fourth Master Swan’s side, you might not believe it. In short, I did send people to kill you. However, I’m also very clear about your relationship with Monica, so helping you save Monica and her husband can be considered my compensation to you.”

Jeanne did not speak.

Yes.

She admitted that she did not want Monica to be hurt, so she was somewhat grateful for Kingsley’s series of actions.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
