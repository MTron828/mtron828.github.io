Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However… that was society. If one was not careful, they could without a trace.

It was a cruel society.

Jeanne followed Edward to Chester Sanders, the most popular heir of the Sanders. He was 35 years old and exuded a righteous aura. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Mr. Sanders.” Edward stepped forward.

Chester looked at Edward, neither enthusiastic nor rejecting him. “Fourth Master Swan.”

“Just call me Edward.”

After all, the title ‘Fourth Master’ was just a form of flattery.

“You’re the elder, so I should call you Fourth Master.” Chester was very humble. In front of Edward, he did not put on any airs.

Edward was naturally very polite.

The two of them conversed.

“Is this your wife, Jeanne?” Chester’s gaze landed on Jeanne.

“Hello, Mr. Sanders.” Jeanne extended her hand.

Chester also extended his hand, and the two of them shook hands out of courtesy.

“I’ve only seen Mrs. Swan on the news, ” Chester said. “You’re even prettier in person.”

“Thank you,” Jeanne said and smiled generously and politely.

“It’s no wonder Fourth Master didn’t choose Melody back then. In comparison, Mrs. Swan is indeed more outstanding.” Chester’s tone was neither cold nor indifferent, but there was no emotion in it.

“Mr. Sanders, you flatter me. When the leader attended our wedding, I answered him that I wasn’t outstanding. It was Edward who wasn’t worthy of Ms. Sanders.”

“Mrs. Swan, you’re really good with words. It’s a pity. Melody was still so young…” Chester was clearly still a little upset about it.

“My condolences,”

“I won’t talk about such a sad topic today.” Chester brushed off Melody’s matter and took the initiative to bring up Quinn in the conversation. “How’s my second sister doing at the Lawrence Enterprise? Has she caused you any trouble?”

“Mr. Sanders, you’re too kind. Ms. Sanders is very outstanding and has won many projects for our company. I’m very glad that so many companies in Harken rejected Ms. Sander from joining their company and have, in turn, allowed her to join Lawrence Enterprise. She has really surprised us.” Jeanne did not hide her approval of Quinn.

Chester was happy to hear his sister being acknowledged by others.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, he turned to Stacey and said, “When it’s your time to step into society, you have to learn from your second sister.”

“Yes.” Stacey was exceptionally well-behaved.

Both parties chatted, and they seemed friendly with each other. However, it was probably just an act for others to see.

At least on the surface, no one could see through the current situation between the Sanders and the Swans.

In the back garden, Monica waited for Jeanne for a long time, but Jeanne did not return.

She really admired Jeanne’s ability to tolerate so many business banquets because she really did not want to be at that banquet for a second longer. It was so boring.

She wondered if she should sneak away first.

Her father had a chauffeur to pick him up anyway.

While thinking, she suddenly saw Michael standing in front of her, looking down at her.

Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

They both had not seen each other for a month.

In fact, she had seen Michael in the banquet hall today, but every time Michael looked over, she would look away. Even when she had just left her father’s side, she also saw Michael walking over to them. She really did not want to be entangled with Michael anymore, and she felt inexplicably annoyed.

“Are you tired?” Michael said gently.

Every time Michael opened his mouth, Monica felt that her rejection of him was somewhat evil.

Hence, she forced herself to smile. “I’m not made for this kind of banquet.”

“Do you want me to send you off early?”

“No need. There are so many dignitaries tonight. It’s inconvenient for you to leave.”

“It’s fine.”

“Michael, you don’t have to be so nice to me,” Monica said bluntly.

Michael was stunned.

However, he smiled naturally. “I’m nice to you because you’re nice to me.”

“I did it to help you. After all, helping others is an excellent virtue. However, you being nice to me is a burden to me.”

The smile on Michael’s lips looked a little lonely.

He said, “I’m sorry. I just wanted to thank you.”

Monica did not know what to say.

She did not know when it had started, but she felt a strong sense of rejection toward Michael. It was not because she deliberately kept her distance from Michael, but deep down in her heart, she really did not want Michael to get close to her.

Was it because Reese came to her house and caused a scene?
