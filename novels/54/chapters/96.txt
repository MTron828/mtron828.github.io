Chapter 97: Counter Scheme

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I know,” Jeanne replied.

“You knew, and yet you—”

“In order for a successful negotiation, I think it’s acceptable to make necessary changes. Or do you think it’s more important to abide by the company’s rules and lose out on the contract?”

“Stop trying to change the subject. Why didn’t you report to me when you changed the contract? Instead, you made the decision on your own.”

“It was an emergency. So I didn’t have time to report it. It’s also to prevent anyone from tampering with it.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What do you mean?”

“When I went to the meeting today, Ascension Technology’s proposal was almost the same as ours, and the investment amount was just 100 million yuan more than ours. It’s impossible for this to be a coincidence. Someone must have leaked it.”

Alexander’s expression changed drastically.

“That’s right, our company has a spy.” As she said that, she glanced at Joshua.

Joshua’s heart skipped a beat. His body trembled slightly.

“But since I don’t have any evidence, I can’t confirm who it is for now,” Jeanne Lawrence said bluntly.

“You must find out!” Alexander ordered.

“I will,” Jeanne agreed.

“But even so, you could’ve given me a call to report. How am I going to answer to the board of directors when you increase the investment amount by 200 million yuan?” Alexander Lawrence was still very angry.

“We won’t be the ones paying for the additional 200 million,” Jeanne said calmly.

Alexander frowned.

Joshua retorted, “Are you going to pay for it yourself? Do you have money?”

Jeanne shot Joshua a sidelong glance. She did not think much of him.

She said, “Swanhaven Bank.”

“Who do you think you are?” Joshua was agitated, even more than before.

“Joshua Lawrence, are you targeting me at every turn? It feels like you’re colluding with outsiders in order to make things difficult for me…”

“What nonsense are you spouting?!”

“The contract has just been negotiated with MUK and it hasn’t been announced to the public yet. How did you know that I’ve changed the investment amount on the proposal? Don’t you think your actions are very suspicious?”

“I have a personal relationship with the boss of Ascension Technology. He came to congratulate Lawrence Enterprise immediately. I just found out…”

“A personal relationship? Is it because of you that my proposal was so similar to his?”

“Jeanne Lawrence, you…”

“Enough!” Alexander turned to Joshua. “Shut up!”

Joshua really wanted to strangle Jeanne.

Alexander did not think Joshua would do such a thing. He turned to Jeanne. “So, how do we get Swanhaven Bank to pay?”

Jeanne smiled.

After all, Alexander had been in business for many, many years. He still had foresight when it came to profits.

She said, “When Jasmine and Eden get married, Eden will be the son-in-law of the Lawrences. Should Lawrence Enterprise face financial difficulties, Swanhaven Bank would not refuse to give us a loan.”

“What about paying off the loan? Besides, the interest is high!” Joshua Lawrence could help but add.

“Swanhaven Bank has a three-year interest waiver policy. Although it’s targeted at welfare enterprises, it won’t be hard to find a way to get Eden to approve that policy for Lawrence Enterprise. Once we repaid the loan in three years, the e-commerce project would have made a profit.”

“You wish!” Joshua mocked. “You’re asking the Swans to provide you with free capital to invest and make money. Do you think the the Swans is stupid enough to make such a loss?”

Jeanne Lawrence smiled. “In terms of business, it’s a loss for the Swans to invest 200 million on our behalf. But in the end, Eden Swan will be the son-in-law of the Lawrences. From a relational standpoint, Eden Swan wouldn’t refuse.”

“That’s just plotting against brother-in-law!” Joshua Lawrence said fiercely.

Kingsley had just told Jeanne that Ascension Technology had some business dealings with Swan Enterprise. With that, she was absolutely certain that the person backing Joshua was Eden Swan!

Every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt has its debtor!

Since Eden Swan was the one who made her to fork out the additional 200 million, he should be the one to fund it.

She pondered, how does Eden Swan feel about shooting himself in the foot?
