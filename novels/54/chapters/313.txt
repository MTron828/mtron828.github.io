Chapter 314: Edward Agrees to Get Married

“Old Man Winter!”

“Resistance is futile.”

“Wasn’t I picked up? Why do I have to carry on the family line?” Nox raged on.

However, Wade ignored him and went straight inside, not giving Nox the chance to reject him.

Nox was furious.

D*mn it.

He was not someone who would submit to his fate! The more they wanted him to marry Shelly, the more he would not!

Even if they wanted him to marry someone, Shelly was not his type!

If he had to carry on the family line, he had to marry a decent one!

..

In the tearoom, Edward appeared in front of Zachary.

When it came to Old Master Swan, Edward still treated him with much respect, so he greeted the old man, “Dad.”

“What’s the matter?” Zachary was playing chess by himself at that moment, and he looked very relaxed.

......

“I’m getting married.” He went straight to the point.

He was just that straightforward.

The chess in Zachary’s hands paused for a moment before he put it down slowly.

Without showing any emotion, he asked Edward, “Who’s the other party?”

“Jeanne.”

“Do you think I’ll agree?”

“I’m not asking for your opinion,” Edward said. “I’m just informing you.”

“I’ve wasted all these years of effort on you, haven’t I?” Zachary’s words were not harsh, but they could make people shudder.

“My life is yours, but my heart is not,” Edward said clearly.

“Is there no turning back?” Zachary let go of the chess piece and looked at his son.

“No.” Edward looked into his eyes. “I have to marry her.”

“What if I insist on not agreeing?”

“As I said, my life is yours, and you can beat me to death.” Edward enunciated each word clearly.

Zachary was visibly displeased.

Once he was angry, he could fill the house with a gloomy atmosphere. That was how powerful his presence was.

“Are you threatening me?”

“I’m just expressing my determination.” Edward was still respectful.

Zachary looked at Edward coldly.

He looked at the son he had raised and the resistance he was putting up against him at that moment.

Then, his face darkened. “Wade.”

“Yes?” Wade walked in from outside.

“Send him to the confinement room!”

Wade paused for a moment, and Zachary gave him a look. With no other choice, Wade walked toward Edward respectfully. “Please, Fourth Master Swan.”

With that, Edward turned around and followed Wade out. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was the confinement room again, but the door of the confinement room seemed to have changed.

After all, Finn had smashed the previous one.

As he walked in, there was nothing inside but a gloomy and cold feeling.

After Edward entered, he immediately knelt on the ground as if he was used to it. That was the result when he did not do as he was pleased.

He watched as Wade walked up to him with the whip in his hand.

Wade sighed. “Fourth Master Swan, why do you have to go against your father?”

“I’m not going against him,” Edward said. “I just want a life of my own.”

“I knew you weren’t destined to have one from the moment you were born.”

“That’s why I want to fight for myself.”

Wade still wanted to say something but chose not to in the end.

Once Fourth Master Swan decided on something, nothing could make him change his decision.

Inside the confinement room, only the sound of whipping could be heard, and it went on for almost the entire night.

The next morning, the door of the confinement room was pushed open.

Nox naturally stayed in Universe Garden the whole night.

He knew it would end like that, but Fourth Master Swan still had to do it his way.

What kind of magic power did Jeanne, the Eldest Young Lady Lawrence, have?

As soon as the door opened, Zachary stepped in.

In the confinement room, Edward was kneeling with his back straight. Even though his back was wounded from being whipped, he remained upright.

Nox was used to the scene, so when he saw Edward’s bloody back, he could remain calm.

“Have you thought it through?” Zachary asked Edward.

“I have thought it through very clearly,” Edward said. “I want to marry Jeanne.”

Nox’s heart trembled.

To be honest, he was still afraid of Old Master Swan.

Even though he was held hostage the last time, he was still afraid after he calmed down.

After all, he had grown up under his cruelty since he was young, so it was hard not to be afraid.

However, Nox was considered to be treated quite alright, for Old Master Swan was the cruelest to his own son, Fourth Master Swan.

He felt it was not easy for Fourth Master Swan to have grown up without going crazy.

At those thoughts, Nox trembled with fear.

In the somewhat silent isolation room, Zachary suddenly said, “Bring Jeanne to see me.”

Edward’s eyes moved, and he looked straight at Zachary.

“Since you want to marry her, I have to see who she is!”

Edward pursed her thin lips.

On the other hand, Nox’s eyeballs almost fell out.

Old Master Swan had agreed and so easily at that, which did not make sense.

All he did was give Fourth Master Swan a few whips, albeit still quite bad, but he was not half-dead. To Old Master Swan, that was not considered a punishment.

Yet, he had agreed just like that.

Nox could not keep up with the plot anymore.

He just watched Old Master Swan leave after that speech and then turned around to see Fourth Master Swan standing up from the ground.

Nox quickly went up to support him.

“Are you really going to marry Jeanne?” Nox asked as he helped Edward to walk.

It was really unbelievable.

How could someone, who had never been in a relationship, get married just like that?

It made him feel very embarrassed! He had been through hundreds of relationships and had never thought about starting a family.

Edward did not answer Nox, and there was no need for Nox to continue asking because Nox knew from the smile on Edward’s face.

In this lifetime, Fourth Master Swan would never be able to escape from Jeanne’s grasp!

The marriage was decided.
