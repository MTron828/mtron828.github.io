1302 Monica Brings Candice to the Nightclub

Nox thought he had to study this woman carefully, and so he did. How could he let Fourth Master Swan let her do whatever she wanted and spend so much money on her?

It was really painful.

…

It was a luxurious night in South Hampton.

Monica spent the whole day out having fun with Candice.

In the beginning, she had been spending money in the mall. When she was done, she took Candice to the most expensive restaurant in the city. After eating, he accompanied Candice to check out a few internet famous spots and later to more popular food trucks. In the evening, she took Candice to the mountainside to watch the sunset while having dinner.

Monica was a little exhausted from all the sightseeing. She lay motionless in the car, feeling like she had nothing to live for.

On the other hand, Candice seemed to be in good spirits. She looked out of the window at the night view of South Hampton.

For some reason, many things felt unfamiliar at the Nicholsons’ residence, yet she bore a sense of familiarity with the scenery in South Hampton.

She had no idea what she had lost from those memories. She felt as if someone had hurt her heart.

However, even after much thought, she still could not think of anything.

The car drove slowly on the streets of South Hampton.

Monica got up from her seat. She was curious about what Candice was looking out of the car window.

Then, her eyes suddenly lit up. She quickly called out to the driver, “Stop the car.”

The driver immediately stopped the sedan and pulled to the side of the road.

Candice was also a little surprised by Monica’s sudden agitation. She turned around and looked at Monica. “What’s wrong?”

“I’ve brought you to so many places today. I think there’s a place I want you to experience.” Monica suddenly smiled slyly.

Candice frowned.

Monica got out of the car enthusiastically and even pulled Monica along. She had no idea why Monica did that.

It was obvious that the two of them did not like strangers getting close to them, but they did not feel repulsed by each other’s intimate actions.

They climbed out of the car. Monica held Candice’s hand and walked straight into the dazzling nightclub.

Candice hesitated for a second. It did not seem good for her to appear in such a place.

However, she could not beat Monica’s determination, so she walked in.

The place was bustling with people and deafening screams. The noisy environment made Candice uncomfortable. She was almost certain that she had never been to such a place before.

They sat in the corner and Monica ordered a lot of wine.

Candice looked at Monica’s order. Was she going to drink them to death here?!

Monica was quite excited. It had been a long time since she had come to such a place.

Sometimes, she came to socialize. She had never been so relaxed.

Now that she was sitting here, there was an indescribable passion. It was as if she had found herself.

She initially brought Candice here as a prank. Edward had deliberately angered her to death by having fallen in love with someone else so quickly.

Anyway, he did not tell her that she could not bring Candice to a nightclub. Monica picked up a wine glass and handed one to Candice. “Can you drink?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I don’t know.” She had not had any alcohol since she woke up and had no recollection of her drinking in her memories.

“Then try it now.” Monica smiled.

Candice found it hard to reject Monica’s request. She was just used to complying with Monica. She nodded and then the two of them started drinking.

The more Monica drank, the more excited she became.

Of course, the more Candice drank, the more she felt something was wrong.

It turned out that her alcohol tolerance was indeed poor. No wonder she had no impression of drinking.

“Do you want to go for a dance?” Monica was emboldened after drinking.

“I don’t think I know how to dance.” Candice was already feeling a little dizzy.

“How can you not know if you’ve never tried it before? Come, let’s go, I’ll bring you to dance.” Once Monica let herself loose, she could not stop herself.

Under Monica’s instigation, Candice walked to the center of the dance floor.

As soon as he walked in, Candice saw Monica skillfully swaying her delicate body.

Undeniably, even as a woman, she felt that Monica’s dance was very charming.

After a while, a few men who were dancing closed in.

Candice wanted to leave with Monica.
