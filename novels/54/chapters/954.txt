955 I Can’t Think of a Title Anymore, Let’s See What the Officials Do

Looking at it now, she was inexplicably angry.

Moreover, those hickeys overlapped with the scratch marks from yesterday. People who did not know better would think that she was into some kind of masochism.

She quickly changed her clothes.

Fortunately, her mother was afraid that she would feel cold, so she found a high-collared knitted sweater that covered her entire body.

However, that scratch on her face… It would not ruin her looks, would it?

She stayed in the bathroom for a long time as she did not want to go out and bump into Finn and his group of doctors and nurses again.

She had her pride and was afraid of embarrassment.

Finn and the others also had routine checkups every day, so they did not stay for too long. After the checkup, they left the ward and went to the next ward.

In the corridor, the special assistant doctor, who had always been with Finn for a long time and was a little young, was more casual with Finn. Hence, he whispered to Finn, “So, I see. Your ex-wife is pretty innocent…”

Finn glared at the assistant doctor, who smiled when realized that Dr. Jones’s ears were red.

…

“Come out! They’ve left!” Ruby knocked on the bathroom door.

Monica opened it and stuck his head out. “Are they gone?”

“They’re gone.” Ruby was speechless. “Aren’t you usually very bold? It’s not as if they saw you naked. Why are you so embarrassed?”

“That’s because this bra is pink. If it were leopard print, I could show them!”

Ruby realized she could not have any hope for her daughter.

The moment Ruby turned around, her eyes suddenly paused. “What happened to your face?”

It was too dark last night, so she did not see it, and when she was unpacking the luggage when she arrived, Monica had deliberately covered her face with her hair. Only now did she realize that Monica had a long scratch on her face.

“Did you get into a fight with someone?”

“Who did you fight?” Ruby asked.

“Anyway, it was just a fight. Why do you want to know the details? I wasn’t taken advantage of.”

Ruby was speechless. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Don’t worry. It won’t ruin my looks. The beautiful face you gave me is still intact.”

“How smug.” After that, Ruby did not ask further.

The scratch was not particularly serious, so she did not want to get to the bottom of it and hurt Monica’s pride.

“I’m going to work.” Monica tidied up her clothes and said.

“Aren’t you going to have breakfast?”

“I’ll eat later.”

“Be careful on the road.”

“Alright,” Monica responded and left.

The moment she left, she could not help but look back, where she saw that her mother had sorted herself out and was now accompanying her father.

Monica smiled.

To her, she had never felt happier.

…

Today, in the Delta Islands, the manor was quite lively.

It was Kingsley’s birthday.

In fact, no one really knew how old he was. Not even Jeanne had an idea.

She did not know how old he was. In her memory, he should be very old, but he looked very young. Of course, he was not that young, but it was hard to guess his actual age!

She had never seen Kingsley’s identity card either.

Perhaps Kingsley did not have such a thing since he traveled in his private jet and did not need to show those documents for registration.

In that case, how old was Kingsley? Over 30? Or was he 40?

“What are you thinking so deeply about?” Lucy could not help but ask.

Jeanne snapped back to reality. “I’m thinking about how old Kingsley is.”

“Does it matter?”

“It doesn’t matter. But to celebrate his birthday, we have to know how old he is.”

“He doesn’t even care about it, so why should you?” Lucy asked.

“That’s true.” Jeanne nodded.

Kingsley had never said how old he was. Perhaps he had even forgotten how old he was.

Jeanne rolled her eyes. “How do you plan to seduce Kingsley today?”

Lucy said, “Actually, he doesn’t need to be seduced.”

There was indeed no need. Anyone could be seduced just by being with a woman.

“So how do you plan to deal with that little b*tch Millie?”

“We can’t do it directly. Kingsley won’t allow us assassins to kill each other. It’s not easy for the Hills to train one, and we’ve had so many casualties.” Lucy said, “I can only leave Millie to her own devices.”

“I shall wait and see.” Jeanne looked interested.

A woman who harbored evil intentions from the start should not have a good ending.

“Ms. Harmon.” A servant knocked on the door.
