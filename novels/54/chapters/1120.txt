1121 The Identity of the Duncans’ Descendent Exposed

On the day he returned to South Hampton City, that man had met Warren with him.

The reason why Warren had brought him along was that he wanted to take a sum of money from him and pay the Hills so that the Hills would be willing to work for the Sanders.

However, who would have thought that everything the Sanders had done was under the surveillance of the Duncans?

Their every move was being watched closely by the Duncans.

What Kingsley did not understand was… How could this man hide his identity so well?

Why did the Sanders trust this man so much?

Why did they trust this man... William Gates, the one who had just held a wedding with the Fifth Princess of the Sanders?

“Because I am William.” William seemed to have read Kingsley’s thoughts, so he no longer hid the truth. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

There was nothing to hide now.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

Of course, he did not believe it.

After all, William was indeed the Gates’ eldest son and grandson. Not only had the Sanders investigated it themselves, but Kingsley had also helped the Sanders investigate it. Since they had confirmed William’s identity, the Sanders trusted him without any reservations.

The man in front of her could not possibly be the real William.

“You’re right.” William seemed to have seen through Kingsley’s thoughts again. “I’m not the real William. The real William just died a while ago. It was when Edward picked me up and was almost discovered by your assassin that he died. When I returned to South Hampton City, I came back as William.”

“As for why I’m such a perfect copy of William, deceiving everyone’s eyes, that’s because I’ve been planning my life since I was born, on how I could use a reasonable identity to appear under the Sanders’ eyes. So, I found the Gates, who are extremely powerful and rich.”

“Of course, I’m not cooperating with the Gates. It’s impossible for us to reach an agreement. Once we do, my identity might be exposed, and my death would be accelerated. I just grew up with the Gates’ eldest young master in a different place. We arranged for my Duncans’ loyal men to go to the Gates and record everything about William. Then, I learned, imitated, and even got plastic surgery like him. All these years, the most time I’ve spent was on how to act like William and how to play him perfectly until I can replace him.”

Alex told Kingsley everything he knew.

He spoke neither fast nor slow, and no one could tell his emotions. At that moment, there seemed to be a smile on the corner of his lips.

That expression that came out unconsciously was William, and it was impossible for him to be someone else.

What exactly did he go through to turn someone into a person who was not related to him?

They were completely indistinguishable.

How much willpower and perseverance did a person need to have to turn himself into this?

Kingsley believed that it was the end for the Sanders.

The Sanders could never imagine how big of a game the Duncans were playing, and how many seamless things the Duncans had done in order to regain their power.

“I’m telling you all this so that you can die in peace and make Edward and Nox hate me less.” Alex looked at Edward and said, “You know very well how much the Duncans have done all these years to take back the family that belongs to us. I can’t let down all the people who are loyal to the Duncans for you. I can’t let the Duncans’ great plan go to waste because of you.”

“I know.” Edward nodded.

He knew that he was not that important.

In fact, at this point, it was inevitable.

Alex had been arranged to be closest to the Sanders, so he already had the ability to completely destroy the Sanders. It was only a matter of time.

“Edward, I always thought that you and I would conquer the world hand in hand. However, things are unpredictable. The promise we made to each other ends here. I’m very glad that you appeared in my life, and I will give you a proper burial!”

That was the only thing he could give Edward.

“Alright.” Edward nodded.

It could be considered that she had accepted his kindness, and accepting it meant that he had no complaints.
