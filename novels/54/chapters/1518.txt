Chapter 1519: Side Story: Lucy, I Want You To Like Me

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Were those women who said that Kingsley was cold-blooded in bed spreading rumors? Were their goals to stop other women from seducing Kingsley? Anyway, Lucy’s first time in bed was considered beautiful.

After that, the bed was stained red. Kingsley looked at it for a long time, and it made Lucy feel a little awkward.

“Is this your first time?” Kingsley asked.

Lucy did not know how to answer him. She thought Kingsley did not care about that. After all, he had had so many women, and her being a virgin should not be a problem for him.

She did not even know whether Kingsley preferred a woman who was a virgin or had experience. Her deep-rooted impression of the man was that she could not afford to offend him. Living by his side was like walking on thin ice.

Seeing that Lucy did not answer, Kingsley did not ask any further.

In fact, in order for assassins to achieve a certain goal, they would do a lot of homework, and healing their bodies was one of them. After all, a woman’s first time would lower a man’s guard and make it easier to complete the mission.

In his previous life, he had also seen Lucy bleed for the first time, but it had never crossed his mind in his previous life because he did not care.

When he thought of everything he had done to her in the past… Kingsley pursed his thin lips.

“Yes,” Lucy suddenly answered.

Kingsley’s eyes flickered. He thought that he would not care about it, but at that moment, he suddenly felt a little excited.

“I thought assassinating people with my charm would be my ultimate killing tactic. Of course, Killing ordinary people doesn’t require me to use such a highly-skilled tactic, and I only use it when dealing with big bosses. However, the move that I thought was the most powerful was the one that made me fail,” Lucy said sarcastically.

At that moment, Kingsley suddenly laughed. His smile could not be any more obvious.

She did not know if he was mocking her, but she felt embarrassed. She said, “I won’t use it in the future. I’ll just go straight to the killing.”

What did it mean to go straight to the killing? Who said she would be tasked to kill people in the future?

Lucy followed Kingsley to the Delta Islands.

She had heard of people commenting about the place, that one had to see it to believe it. However, when she saw that luxurious ancient manor, she was still shocked. It gave the vibe of an emperor’s residence, and everything inside was beyond her imagination.

Now she understood why so many assassins wanted to join the Hills. It she Imew that the assassins of the Hills could enjoy such a good life, she would have come over earlier.

She followed beside Kingsley, and upon Kingsley’s return, all the assassins would come out to welcome him. Then, everyone looked at the unfamiliar face that Kingsley had brought back, making Lucy feel a little uncomfortable.

She braced herself and followed behind Kingsley, whom she heard say to everyone, “Lucy will be a member of the Hills from now on.”

He introduced her in public instead of getting her to introduce herself. It was as if he was just announcing her existence to everyone.

After that, he led her directly to the residential area and into a luxurious room. It was obvious that it was Kingsley’s bedroom.

“From now on, you’ll live here,” Kingsley said bluntly.

Lucy was stunned, and she looked at Kingsley in disbelief. It meant that she was going to stay in the same room as him, which was probably not good.

She was just an assassin. If he really had a need, she would satisfy him. Staying in the same room seemed a little inappropriate.

“Do you not want to?” Kingsley saw through her thoughts and asked her. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I’m just afraid that others will misunderstand,” Lucy quickly said.

She had been an assassin for a long time, so her first reaction was how to protect herself.

She was afraid that if she stayed in the same room as Kingsley, she would be envied. Moreover, as she was not familiar with the Hills, she might be assassinated before she knew it.

“No one will misunderstand,” Kingsley said bluntly.

Therefore… was it normal for Kingsley to sleep in the same bed with a woman?

“Alright.” Of course, she did not dare to refuse.

“Come here, let me introduce you to someone.” Kingsley left the room with Lucy.

After living for 25 years and being an assassin for 10 years, that was her first time feeling confused.

Kingsley pushed open a door, and in there lived a woman.

At that moment, she was holding a baby in her arms. The baby, who was only a few months old, looked very well-behaved.

The first thing Lucy thought was that it was Kingsley’s child..
