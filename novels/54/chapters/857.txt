858 Monica’s Extreme Counterattack, a Struggle Between Life and Death

He finally let go of Monica.

“Ah!” screamed Monica as she stood up to leave.

The young hunk was shocked to see her hair hanging on the buttons of his open white shirt.

“Don’t move. Your hair is tangled in my clothes,” the young man said quickly.

“F*ck. Hurry up and get me off.”

“Don’t be anxious.” The young hunk aided her.

It did not help that Monica was afraid of pain. Just a slight pull and she would cry out. So, during the process of the two of them pushing and pulling, they had gotten even more tangled up than before.

The two of them stood at the door, “flirting” for a long time until someone walked past them.

As the door was open, the man could see them in their entangled state. He glanced at them and walked past without a word.

Monica’s heart tightened. She did not expect to meet Finn in such a place. What was he doing here?

“Done.” The young hunk had finally untangled her hair.

Chi Mumu stood up straight and moved her head away from his bare body. She glared at him before exiting the room and walked toward the elevator. Finn was still standing there.

Upon closer inspection, she noticed that he was wearing a white coat. Did he come here to save a patient?

Why was he here alone, then? Were there no other doctors, assistants, or nurses accompanying him?

She pursed her lips tightly and walked over. Finn turned to look, sensing someone beside him.

Although Monica was wearing a windbreaker, the skimpy outfit she wore underneath was still visible, as was the hickey on her neck.

Finn turned his gaze away indifferently and waited for the elevator. Monica did not speak either and stood quietly beside him.

She wondered if she should stand beside him. Would he hate her for it? Before she could think any further, the elevator arrived.

The two of them walked in one after another. At the exact moment that Monica reached out to press the button for the first floor, Finn also reached out his hand.

Their fingers brushed.

The illusion broke as Finn pulled his hand away as quickly as it happened. His movement was very fast as if he had touched something dirty.

Monica pursed her lips.

As the elevator doors started closing, the young hunk who was with Monica suddenly ran over and stopped the elevator from closing using his hand.

“Sister,” he said, still panting. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Monica looked at him. It was so awkward with Finn standing there.

“What is it?”

The young hunk panted. “You forgot your phone. The photos of us in bed are inside. What if someone saw them?”

At that moment, Monica really wanted to vomit blood. She could not believe she had forgotten to take her phone when the purpose of capturing them was to let people see.

She snatched it from him.

“Call me.” The young hunk was very enthusiastic.

Monica really wanted to kick him.

“Take care.” The fresh meat smiled ingratiatingly.

The elevator door finally closed.

It took longer than usual to descend the building. After all, they were on the twenty-ninth floor. Monica wished she could just dig a hole in the ground at this moment. She had secretly glanced at Finn a few times, but he remained indifferent.

Perhaps she was overthinking it. What effect could she have on him? They were two strangers to Finn. At most, in Finn’s mind, she was just a woman who did not know how to behave herself.

When the elevator reached the first floor, Monica rushed to get out, wanting to leave as soon as possible. She could not bear to be in the same space as Finn, especially after the young hunk had said those explicit words.

Due to her messy footsteps, the heel of her high heels became unstable. She instinctively grabbed Finn to prevent herself from falling flat on her face. However, she found herself pushed away by someone.

She would have fallen to the ground if she had not been leaning against the elevator wall. Even at that moment, a loud noise filled the space, and it felt like the elevator was about to fall.

Monica looked at the man in front of her, dazed. Just how much strength had he used to push her away?

He strode away soon after he pushed her off him.

Monica’s chin wobbled. It was not her intention to get close to Finn. Her eyes watered, but she held back her tears.

She stood up, straightened her posture, and headed out. She walked out of the hotel, prepared to take a taxi back. At the entrance, Finn seemed to be waiting for one as well.

While waiting, he made a call. “The patient is temporarily stable. I’m heading back first while Dr. White waits for the ambulance to arrive. There’s a patient in the department whose condition is deteriorating and may need an emergency operation.”

He seemed to be reporting to someone.

After Finn hung up the phone, a sedan car stopped in front of Monica. She was in front of Finn when she heard his phone call that he had to rush to the hospital. She was hesitating about whether or not she should let him have the car first when Finn walked over and opened the door, planning to get in.

Monica did not say anything. She only took two steps back, her meaning obvious.

“Monica.” Finn suddenly called her name.

Monica raised her head and looked at him.

“Do you know what you look like right now?” Finn asked.

Monica was a little surprised. Astonished, she looked at his face full of disdain.

Before Finn could say the word, “Prostitute…”

Monica interrupted, “A b*tch, right?”
