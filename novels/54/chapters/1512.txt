Chapter 1513: Candice Recovers Her Memories, Jeanne Is Alive

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Where’s Candice?” Edward asked.

“She said she was going out with George in the afternoon, so I told the driver, Ben, to accompany them. Are they not back yet?” Teddy was probably busy, so he did not ask further.

Edward placed Paige on the sofa and picked up his phone to call Ben, whose phone was turned off. Hence, he hurriedly called Candice, whose phone was switched off too. In the end, he called George, only to find the latter’s phone switched off as well.

By now, Edward looked flustered, and Paige was a little scared by her father’s appearance. She had never seen her father so flustered. It was as if something huge had happened.

Edward forced himself to remain calm as he called Finn.

“Fourth Master.” The call connected.

“Is it possible that the drug has failed?” Edward was straightforward. It took Finn two seconds to react. “What are you talking about, Fourth Master?” “The pills that Candice takes every day,” Edward said.

Finn suddenly understood. “No. I’ve done clinical trials on them. As long as she takes it every day, her memory will not recover.”

“Is there a possibility of the drug failing?”

“Unless she didn’t take it.” Finn said bluntly, “I’ve given it to Patsy. Usually, after she takes it, a lot of her memories will be blurred. However, once she stops taking the medicine, her memories will slowly recover. If she continues to take the medicine, she will gradually lose her memory until she can’t remember anything at all.”

By the time Edward heard Finn’s words, he had already strode upstairs. He pushed open his room and started looking for the pills that Candice had taken. He then found the box of medicine under the drawer of the bedside table. He quickly opened it and found that the box was full of medicine. Not a single pill was missing.

“Fourth Master?” Finn called Oilt to him-

Edward looked at the pill and stayed silent for a long time.

“Fourth Master, what’s wrong?” Finn kept calling him over the phone. Edward slowly regained his senses. “Candice has regained her memories.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“She didn’t take her medicine?”

“No,” Edward said.

Finn pursed his lips.” Fourth Master, I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing. Actually, it was unfair to hide it from her like that from the beginning.”

That was right. It was indeed unfair to use such a despicable method to get her back to his side.

“Has she left?” Finn asked. “Yes, she has taken George with her.”

“Where’s Paige?”

“With me,” Edward said.

She took George, who belonged to her, but left Paige behind. It was clear and fair, which had always been her way of doing things.

“I think she’ll come back,” Finn comforted him.

“I won’t.” Edward said, “She won’t come back.”

He knew her too well. If she left, she would never come back.

Edward hung up the phone and stared at the bottle of pills in front of him. Actually, he had also expected that such a day would come. For so long, he had never felt at ease for even a second.

As the night deepened, Edward sat in the room for the entire night. Paige had come to call him, but because he did not want Paige to see the state he was in, he did not open the door.

Teddy had also come over to check on him, but he told Teddy not to disturb him. He just sat there alone in the cold and empty room, holding the box of pills.

At 4 a.m., the phone suddenly rang. Edward’s eyes flickered as he looked at the familiar phone number. He watched as his phone rang for a long time and did not pick up. However, the moment the phone was about to stop ringing, he pressed the answer button.

After the call connected, they were silent for a long time. It was as if there was no call and no one was on the other end of the phone. “I’m at the Delta Islands,” the other party suddenly said.

A familiar voice rang in his ears.

Therefore, she regained her memories and went back to the Delta Islands.

“Do you hate me?” Edward asked.

“I don’t know.” The other side replied, “But don’t come looking for me.” Upon hearing that last sentence, Edward’s vision was a little blurry.

He said, “Alright.”

He said it loud and clear, and it did not sound like he was choking up.

Then, the other party hung up.

Candice put down the phone. She was carrying a suitcase and holding George’s hand as they stood at the entrance of the Delta Manor.

The glory of the past was now almost in ruins. Weeds were everywhere, and no one was inside. It was empty, like a cold haunted house.

“Mom,” George called her.

Looking at the scene in front of him, he still could not accept it..
