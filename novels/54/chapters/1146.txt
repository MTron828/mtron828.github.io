1147 Monica Risked Her Life To Save Finn

However, it was as if everything happened had nothing to do with Finn.

He was still punching the car window like a crazy man, and the back of his bloody hands looked hideous.

The bullet did not hit his head because the Duncans’ reinforcements had arrived.

From afar, a sniper directly killed the man holding a pistol behind Finn.

The next moment, another gunshot sounded. The other man was also killed.

Very quickly, the Duncans’ reinforcement appeared beside Finn and even planned to bring him away without hesitation.

Finn knew that it was not good for him to stay there for long. Since the Sanders were here to kill him, they would not give up so quickly. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, the moment the Duncans’ men approached Finn and were about to take him away, he frantically pushed them away.

“Don’t come near me!” Finn said.

His voice was terrifyingly sinister.

At that moment, the Duncans’ men could not help but feel a chill that seemed to come from hell. The man in front of them exuded a vicious aura that made them gasp.

After saying that, Finn punched the car window again and again.

The glass of a premium car was unimaginably sturdy.

When the Duncans’ men behind him saw Finn’s appearance, they did not dare to go forward and had to report to their superior. “Finn won’t let us take him away now! He’s been hitting the window of a car. It seems like he’s trying to save someone.”

“Help him save the person and protect him!” The other party gave the order.

“Yes,” the man said respectfully.

At the same time, the person on the other end of the line dialed another number and ordered coldly, “Go and bring George back.”

“Received.”

Alex put down the phone, and his face darkened.

Edward, Finn, and Nox all had feelings and emotions. Once one was influenced by their feelings, many things could go wrong.

Therefore, he needed to leave himself a greater possibility.

He was not heartless, and he would not sacrifice anyone if it was not necessary. However, he would not be soft-hearted if he had to sacrifice someone.

…

On the streets, the Duncans’ man, who had received the order, ordered everyone to help Finn to knock down the car window as fast as they could.

Finally, the glass cracked. Then, with a little force, the entire piece of glass shattered.

That was when he saw a figure covered in blood and with the airbag wrapped around her tightly, but her face was still bleeding profusely.

Her eyes were closed, and she was motionless. It was as if she was not even breathing.

Finn’s hands, which were covered in blood and wounds, were close to her face, and his trembling fingers gently caressed her pale face.

He did not even know if Monica was still alive at that time as he could not even feel her temperature.

His fingers inched closer to her nose, bit by bit, to feel if she was really... dead.

His eyes were red, and he could not see Monica’s face clearly. However, he forced himself to look at her clearly.

Then, he calmed himself down and tried to feel if she was still breathing.

At that moment, the entire world seemed to have fallen silent. It was so quiet that he could only hear the sound of his heart beating against his chest.

Suddenly, a tear fell from Finn’s eye.

He seemed to have felt the slight warmth in Monica’s breath — the warmth that came from her weak breathing.

She was not dead.

Even if her arms and legs were broken, it was fine. As long as she was alive, anything was fine.

Finn frantically pulled on the car door, and the Duncans’ men were also pulling it open with force.

Finally, they managed to open the car door.

Finn got into the car, opened the airbag, and carried Monica out of the driver’s seat.

Monica’s entire body was covered in blood, but she did not respond or react. She just leaned on him.

Just like that, she lay in his arms, looking as if… she was dead.

Finn quickly carried Monica up and sat in the Duncans’ car.

The Duncans’ men quickly drove to the hospital.

Finn held her tightly in his arms the entire time as if he was afraid that she would die and he wanted to protect her with his life.

However, she was the one who had risked her life to save him.

Finn was overwhelmed with emotions.
