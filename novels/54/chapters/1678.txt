Chapter 1679: The Breakup

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Damn it. Now that I think about how I told Benjamin to pursue you, I realize how f*cking crazy I was and wish I could kill myself for it. If you didn’t leave that year, you wouldn’t be with Benjamin now, and you wouldn’t like him. If only you didn’t like him.

“Even in my dreams, I wish I could go back to that year we spent together. I would’ve definitely treated you right and agree to marry you and have children with you. However, it’s too late now because the person you like is Benjamin, not me.

“After you stopped liking me, I realized I regret it all. Seeing you with Benjamin made me angry, and seeing you smile at Benjamin made me jealous. Even I

couldn’t believe that I could cry.

“But what could I do? Should I watch you be together with another man? No. It’s torturing as hell, and that was why I chose to use such a despicable method to get you.

“Do you know why I forced you to admit that you drugged me in front of the media? It was because I wanted you to admit defeat and return to my side. If you said you didn’t want to do it, I wouldn’t have forced you to do it. However, your attitude was too cold. You even told me that you didn’t want me to come looking for you again if you helped me that time! If I weren’t so angry, I wouldn’t have agreed so quickly.

“I regretted it immediately after agreeing to your condition. However, seeing how determined and cruel you were, I released the video. If I had known that you would be so badly attacked on the internet, I might not have done it. I didn’t expect the netizens to be worse than me and attack you in real life. When I found out, I almost died of anger! But don’t worry, no one will bully you again. I’ve taken care of it.

“With so much being said, all I want to say is that I really love you. I don’t know why I love you, but I think I know why you repulsed me so much all those

years ago. I’ve thought about it carefully, reflected on it, and roughly figured out why. It was because of… my pride. I was embarrassed that you were my companion who would marry me in the future, and that was why you repulsed me and I subconsciously hated you.

“And the reason why my crieria for choosing a wife was so simple was that my pride couldn’t take it. I believed that a person like me should at least have a woman with a good family background and a beautiful figure. Otherwise, I’d feel embarrassed.

“Zoe met all the requirements, so I thought she was the one for me. However, I really don’t know whether I loved her or not. All I know is that when she made a cuckold out of me in front of the entire country, I was only angry, not sad. I was even glad that the wedding was over. I was even glad that it would be possible for me to be with you.

“Shelly, do you know? I really thought that as long as I stretched out my hand, you would return to my side. Didn’t you love me very much all those years ago? Didn’t you say I couldn’t chase you away no matter what I did? But why were you so far away from me when I turned around, in the arms of another man? And I, no matter how hard I tried, couldn’t get you back at all!

“Shelly, I know you hate me now, and I know you don’t love me anymore, but I just can’t bear to let go. I just can’t bear to see you with another man. I’ll die of jealousy.

“Give me a chance, okay? Just once. I’ll change into whoever you want me to be. I’ll learn how to be gentle, considerate, kind, cook, do the laundry, and take care of children. If I don’t, you can hit me, and I won’t fight back.

“So, Shelly, come back to me! I swear, I will only love you for the rest of my life, with all my heart! Woof woof woof!

“Love, Nox.”

After Benjamin read the letter, he tore it into pieces.

He did not want to know if Nox loved Shelly. He did not care if Nox was taking revenge on Shelly or if Nox could not bear to see Shelly have a good life, but he would rather it be a reason for him to persevere with the relationship than knowing how much Nox loved Shelly.

Benjamin left the restaurant and took the subway back to Shelly’s house. On the subway, he watched as people come and go, wondering where his position was in the world..Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
