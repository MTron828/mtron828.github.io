Chapter 1492: Edward Has Been Giving You Birth Control Pills!

“The reason why Paige isn’t so brave is because you protect her too well. It’s just pooping. Which child didn’t poop by themselves?” Candice asked Edward.

Edward pursed his lips.

“Daddy.” Paige looked pitiful.

Edward felt a little sorry for her.

“If you trust me, go out and wait.” Candice was very serious.

“Daddy, don’t go.” Tears rolled down Paige’s eyes.

Edward hesitated for two seconds before he turned around and walked out.

“Daddy…” Paige called out to him loudly.

However, Edward closed the toilet door behind him.

Candice then turned to look at Paige, who looked extremely pitiful, as if she had been abandoned by someone.

Edward must have had great self-restraint to not throw away all his principles after seeing Paige’s expression.

“Now, Daddy is gone too.” Candice forced herself to be cold. “You can only rely on yourself.”

“Mommy, I hate you.” “Paige, listen to Mommy. You must poop on your own.”

“Boohoo…” Paige cried.

“Be good.” Candice held Paige’s hand.

Paige bit her lips and could only try to poop again. She was forcing it out so hard that her face turned red again. She even made the sound of children trying their best to poop.

Candice was actually anxious because she was afraid that Paige would not be able to control her poop at such a young age. However, Paige was doing the right thing.

Paige worked very hard for a long time until finally, she pooped and a lot at that. After Paige pooped, her stomach instantly stopped hurting.

She looked at Candice in surprise. “Mom, my stomach doesn’t hurt anymore.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It’s because you were brave enough to poop the bug out. Without the bug biting your stomach, it won’t hurt anymore.”

“Yes, yes.” Paige was thrilled.

Candice heaved a sigh of relief.

She wiped Paige’s butt clean. “If you still have a stomachache, you must tell me.”

“Alright,” Paige said obediently.

Candice held Paige’s hand as they walked out of the toilet.

“Paige, how are you?” Just as they walked out, Chloe suddenly ran over and hugged Paige.

“I’m fine after I pooped,” Paige quickly said.

“It’s all my fault,” Chloe suddenly cried out loudly, looking extremely remorseful. “I shouldn’t have given Paige ice cream just because she wanted to eat it. If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have given it to her. It’s all my fault for making your stomach hurt…’

Her mood changed really quickly, and it was the first time Teddy witnessed it.

“I’m fine now, Aunt.” Paige was probably shocked by Chloe’s sudden crying.

At that moment, she could not help but lean closer to Candice.

“But seeing you in so much pain, my heart aches for you. Paige, will you forgive me?”

Paige, of course, was not mature enough to care. Hence, when she saw Chloe crying, she quickly nodded. “I’ll forgive you.”

“Paige, you’re such a good child. Come, let me hug you.” As she spoke, Chloe was about to pick Paige up.

However, Candice rejected her directly. “Paige, it’s time to go back to class.”

Chloe secretly gritted her teeth. She knew Candice just could not bear to see her and Paige getting along.

“Mr. Frank, thank you so much,” Candice called out to the teacher who was waiting for her at the side.

“It’s my job,” Teacher Wang quickly agreed. “Paige, let’s go. Let’s continue with the class.”

“Paige just had diarrhea. Doesn’t she need some rest?” Chloe pretended to be a good person.

“No need,” Candice said bluntly.

The teacher was at a loss for words and could not help but glance at Edward, who was standing at the side. Only after seeing Edward nod, he took Paige away.

Chloe was really jealous of how Edward indulged Candice. In fact, she thought that Edward would be angry at Candice for treating Paige like that.

She Imew very well that Edward doted on her daughter very much, whom he treated like a precious treasure. However, she did not expect that he would compromise for Candice.

“Don’t you have to go to work?” Candice asked Edward.

“I called Edward to come back,” Chloe quickly said. “Because I was too worried about Paige, I couldn’t help but inform Edward.”

“It’s okay. You can go back to work. If Paige’s stomach still hurts, I’ll call Finn over..”
