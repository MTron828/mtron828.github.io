Chapter 359: Honeymoon: I Love You, Jeanne

Suddenly, another message came from the other person. “Godmother, thank you.”

Monica looked at the contents of the message and paused.

In fact, a word of thanks was a common word in a civilized society.

However, she did not know why, but when she saw the thank you from George, her heart warmed. She was inexplicably touched by George.

It must not be easy for such an aloof child like George to say such words.

She deleted the half-edited message and said, “Silly, we’re family. You don’t have to thank me.”

No more messages came from the other end. George was still an introvert, after all.

With that, Monica put down her phone, and for some reason, she was pretty happy.

It seemed like her fracture today was not in vain. At least she had gained George, that little brat’s respect.

She was in a good mood and saw that Finn had already driven to the garage.

Her crutches were in the backseat, so she naturally thought that Finn would get them for her after he got out of the car. Then, he would open the car door for her and help her get out.

However, the reality was that after Finn parked the car, he got out and walked to the side.

He had no intention of helping her at all.

That d*uchbag! What was wrong with him again?

However, because he still had to lock the car, he did not turn around and leave immediately. He simply stood at a distance that was neither too far nor too close, looking at her coldly.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She could not insist on asking Finn to do anything, for she did not have that ability yet.

Whenever they were together, Finn would do whatever he wanted. If she asked him to do anything, she would be making a fool out of herself.

She opened the car door and slowly got out.

The doctor said she should not put pressure on her foot for at least a week, so she stood on her tiptoes. It looked difficult and a little funny.

After she got out of the car, she struggled to open the door to the backseat and take out her crutches.

When she left the hospital, it was Finn who carried her, and she just had to hold on to the crutches.

At that moment, she felt numb. It turned out that all the good Finn had done for her was for the sake of outsiders.

Take the hospital, for example. Not only were there many people coming and going, but it was also where he worked. Hence, he was deliberately showing it to others to create the illusion that he, Dr. Jones, dotted on his wife!

What a hypocrite.

Monica cursed in her heart. In the end, she adjusted her crutches and supported herself as she walked toward the elevator step by step.

Then, the car behind her was locked.

Finn did not even look at her before he turned around and walked into the elevator first.

What was worse was that when she was already at the entrance of the elevator, that b*stard Finn pressed the button on the elevator and left.

“F*ck, Finn!” Monica could not help but roar.

She was going crazy.

She almost fell to the ground just so that she could walk faster and not have him wait for her for too long. Yet… She really did f*cking overthink things.

She watched the elevator reach their floor and then slowly come down.

Once Monica walked into the elevator, she pressed the floor angrily.

She must curse Finn, curse that man to spend the rest of his life alone!

The elevator arrived, and Monica walked into the house.

At that moment, Finn was also there. However, when he saw her return, she did not even bat an eyelid at her as he was in the kitchen, seemingly cooking.

It was only then that she realized they were in the hospital at noon and had not even eaten lunch.

Suddenly, she felt hungry.

She rubbed her stomach and walked to the kitchen, where Finn was making instant noodles.

Finn did not really know how to cook. Under normal circumstances, he would make a quick ready-made pasta to fill his stomach.

Monica said, “Make one for me while you’re at it.”

She did not want to go through the hassle of ordering takeout.

Although instant noodles did not sound too good to her, it was still better than not eating.

Without even looking at her, Finn said, “Serve yourself.”

He rejected her immediately.

“Finn, why are you so annoying? You’ve already made some yourself. Why can’t you cook another serving for me?”

“There’s nothing I can do,” Finn said bluntly. “But I’m not obligated to do anything for you.”

Monica was about to explode with anger.

She felt she was embarrassing herself every time she tried to be friendly with Finn.

In fact, there were many times when she was so angry that she did not want to talk to Finn anymore. However, after her anger subsided, she still realized there was no need for her to be upset with Finn. In the end, there was no enmity between them. Even if they were separated, they could still be friends.
