941 Monica Stirring Up Trouble

Most of the members of the board of directors were people with status in South Hampton City, so there was nothing wrong with using their connections to help Cardellini Enterprise.

In fact, he felt that that was a way to solve the Cardellini Enterprise’s current predicament. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Well, I’ve just vented my anger, and now, I’ve almost regained my composure.” Monica said to Steve, “First, let the company’s public relations department consult the quality inspection department about when the test report will be out. We will think and discuss it according to the results.”

Steve nodded. “Alright, I’ll make the arrangements.”

“Also, you mentioned a pharmaceutical company.” Monica could not remember the name.

“Sunny Pharmaceutical,” Steve immediately replied.

Monica hurriedly nodded. “Yes, let me have a look at its basic information. I want to study the background of this pharmaceutical company and what’s so amazing about it that it could cause Cardellini Enterprise to suffer continuous losses.”

“Alright,” Steve said respectfully.

“Mr. Warren, I’ll have to trouble you to work with me for this period of time.”

“It’s my job,”

“I’ll give you a pay raise when the time comes,” Monica quickly promised.

Steve smiled. “Thank you in advance, Ms. Cardellini.”

At that moment, Monica blushed at Steve’s gratitude.

She had probably forgotten how brutal she was when she was scolding them just now!

…

In the Delta Islands, it had now returned to its relatively peaceful days.

The Sanders’ attempt to find the descendant of the Duncans during Monica’s wedding banquet was basically useless because the DNA samples collected by the Sanders were all destroyed in the fire

Needless to say, Edward did it.

At that time, Jeanne did not understand why he would go against the flow of the fire, but she found out later.

In any case, Edward had his own motives for everything he did.

With the samples collected by the Sanders having been destroyed, the samples collected by the Hills were used for testing, and none was a match with the Duncans’ descendant. Moreover, 60 percent of the samples had problems, so it could not be confirmed whether the descendant existed or if the hair had really been switched.

When they heard the news that Kingsley brought back, the Sanders were furious about the wedding banquet.

It caused the Sanders to be a topic of discussion in Harken. After all, the Harken had been peaceful for a long time, and the sudden outbreak of danger caused many people in Harken to panic. The Sanders even had to think of ways to calm them down. On top of that, they did not gain any benefits from that meticulous arrangement, so the Sanders were naturally furious!

However, because they were afraid of causing panic among the people again, they did not dare to act as rashly as they did before. Therefore, the Hills had some time to rest but not for long.

With the existence of the Duncans’ descendant, the Sanders would definitely find that person no matter what!

It was only a matter of time.

Jeanne put out the cigarette butt.

She would often show up in Lucy’s room, sit on her balcony, and chat with her over tea.

The burns on Lucy’s body had completely recovered after two weeks of rest. She had even undergone cosmetic repair, and her skin had begun to look smooth and tender again.

Jeanne looked at her exposed skin outside Lucy’s silk pajamas and watched as the latter poured her another cup of black tea. She looked at her natural womanly charm and said with a smile, “Aren’t you going to put it into action?”

Lucy looked up at Jeanne and said nonchalantly, “There’s no hurry.”

Jeanne laughed. “You’re not in a hurry, but I am.”

Lucy chuckled.

Clearly, she already had her own plan.

She was just waiting for an opportunity.

Lucy had always been mature and steady in her work. She would never let herself make any mistakes in the things that she wanted to do.

“Oh, right. Something seems to have happened to the Cardellinis.” Lucy changed the topic.

She often read news about Harken.

Jeanne nodded.

When she saw that the Cardellinis were in trouble, the first thing she wanted to do was to call Monica and ask her about the situation. However, she endured it in the end.

Monica did not call her, which meant that Monica was not desperate yet.

Therefore, she felt that she could leave some space for Monica to learn and experience it all.

After all, Monica should learn to grow up, bear responsibility, and be independent.
