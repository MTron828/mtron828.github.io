Chapter 704: A Dangerous Fight, the Appearance of a Big Shot

“Okay.” Jeanne said, “I roughly understand the current situation of the retail agents. Next, we need to solve all of their problems.”

“To solve their problem, we need to invest a lot of money. After all, the sales of the physical stores are not of high value to us. If we support them now, we will restore our reputation, but it won’t produce too much economic value. I’m worried that the company’s senior management and shareholders won’t agree with our approach.”

“We can’t forget our roots. You just said those people helped our company to grow, so we shouldn’t burn our bridges with them. However, we’re not a charity enterprise. We can’t make a loss on projects that aren’t profitable. Not to mention Lawrence Enterprise’s senior management and shareholders, I wouldn’t agree to it either. So now we really have to think about how to truly raise the sales volume of the physical stores.” Jeanne said bluntly, “This is a tough one, but the more difficult it is, the more we should do it!”

“Yes.”

“You go out and think about how we can go about this issue with the physical retail stores first. Tomorrow, give me a rough draft, and we’ll discuss the next plan.”

“Yes,” Forrest said respectfully.

Jeanne gave more instructions before Forrest left her office.

Amy served Jeanne black coffee.

Jeanne took a few sips and felt a little down for some reason.

The chain of physical retail stores was started by her mother. Back then... did her mother work day and night to make Lawrence Enterprise better?

In her memory, her mother often did not come home and was mostly on business trips.

She spent her life’s effort on Lawrence Enterprise, only for her to die an untimely death.

Jeanne slowly drank her coffee, trying to adjust her sad mood.

If Kinglsey had not told her that her mother’s death was not a simple car accident, she might not have returned to South Hampton City.

Even though the Lawrences hurt her very badly, she did not hate them so much that she had to kill them.

The corners of her mouth curled into a cold smile.

The people she wanted to take revenge on were still alive, so she did not have the right or the time to reminisce about the past.

…

The dispute between Lawrence Enterprise and its retail agents was soon on the front pages of all the major news.

Once that matter was out, all the senior people had the same opinion. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A rational person would think that it was a result of the survival of the fittest in the industry, so it was unreasonable for the retail agents to kick up a fuss. The development of business had never stayed the same, and there was no such thing as a secured job. Once the business model was not suitable for the mainstream public, it would either transform or go bankrupt. At the end of the day, that was their own business. They could not blame others for their own mismanagement. That was completely unreasonable.

Of course, there were also some people who felt that an enterprise should develop with the various retail chains instead of damaging the retail chains’ interests because of their own development. Lawrence Enterprise’s development in the e-commerce economy clearly had a fatal impact on the real economy, so Lawrence Enterprise should plan ahead for a future of the real economy or a joint transformation. To burn their bridges with the retail agents was a violation of social morality, and such a business development should not be approved and promoted.

Both sides had their own opinions and were quarreling with one another on the internet.

That kind of news did not impact Lawrence Enterprise badly. It even gave them exposure and allow their stock market to increase a little.

However, on the third day after the retail agents kicked up a fuss, a piece of shocking news suddenly appeared.

Something happened to South Hampton City’s biggest agent, Rick. He was lying on a hospital bed and had gathered many reporters to accuse Jeanne of getting someone to threaten him and even beat him up to stop him from causing trouble. Now that his injuries were serious, he wanted to accuse Jeanne of intentional injury and, at the same time, demand an explanation from Lawrence Enterprise.

That afternoon, Jeanne was brought to the police station to be investigated.

However, because Rick’s statement was one-sided, and there was no evidence to prove that the matter had anything to do with Jeanne, the police released Jeanne.

When Jeanne walked out of the police station, a group of reporters swarmed over.

Jeanne did not back away either.

Amy and Forrest followed her to the police station, so they instinctively shielded Jeanne behind them, blocking the reporters from besieging her.

Facing more than a dozen reporters, the two of them were still somewhat powerless.
