Chapter 1714: The Miscarriage

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the other end of the line, Zoe was wailing and crying miserably, probably because she could not accept that fact either.

Nox gripped his phone tightly and said, “I will give you one million as sympathy, but I don’t feel anything for you.”

“Nox!” Zoe screamed, “Don’t you have any conscience? Do you even know the baby was moving when it came out? Do you know that? Why aren’t you dead yet? Why hasn’t God punished you yet?”

Nox thought about it before saying, “If I die, that’s on me, and it has nothing to do with you. I will transfer the money to you immediately. As for what you’ll say to my mother, you best think about it carefully. This is a deal, and a deal is a deal. Any harm you suffer from it has nothing to do with me. It was your own choice.”

“Nox-”

Nox directly hung up on her. He wanted nothing to do with Zoe anymore and would never have sympathy for her. He was cold and heartless to anyone he had no connection to, just like how cruel he was to Shelly back then. It was all his own doing, and he deserved it.

He knocked on Bella’s door with the phone in hand. Shelly opened the door and looked at Nox, who returned her phone with the same expression.

“What happened to Zoe?’ Shelly asked.

Zoe was so agitated just now that she thought something devastating had happened to Zoe. However, seeing Nox calm at that moment, Shelly thought it was just an illusion.

“Nothing I can’t handle,” Nox said, looking as if nothing had happened.

“Okay.” Shelly nodded. “Don’t answer Zoe’s call again.”

“Okay.”

“I’m going to work,” Nox said.

“You’re still going to work?” Shelly asked as she thought he was not going to work after what happened.

“Don’t you want me to?” Nox asked back.

Shelly chuckled and did not reply, so Nox chuckled too, just as a casual remark.

“I’m leaving,” he said.

“Mm.” Shelly nodded again.

Nox chuckled again, but this time, it sounded a little ironic. That ‘mm’ was really smooth.

With that, Nox left the house. Shelly watched Nox leave and took a deep breath. It seemed like she had provoked him!

When Mrs. Winter told Old Master Winter about Zoe’s pregnancy, not only did she not get his support but was also told that it was none of her business. He said it was Nox’s decision to make and her not to interfere!

Old Master Winter and Nox did not usually see eye to eye, so now that they were on the same side, Mrs. Winter was so angry that she could not sleep all night. After thinking about it, she decided to call Nox and confront him. She was determined to get the child in Zoe’s belly no matter what!

With that thought in mind, she called Nox, who was on his way to the company.

When he saw his mother’s call, he frowned before pressing the answer button and saying, “Don’t ask. Zoe’s child has been aborted.”

“What?” Mrs. Winter was so angry that her lungs were about to explode.

“If you don’t believe me, you can go to the hospital and ask her for yourself. Zoe is now in the VIP ward 888!”

After that, Nox hung up the phone abruptly and dialed Zoe’s number. Upon receiving Nox’s call, Zoe broke down again. “What do you want?”

“I’m just letting you know that my mother is coming soon. You know what to say, and if you mess things up, I’ll take back everything I’ve given you!” Nox threatened.

Zoe’s expression was grim. She realized that was Nox’s true character, which was a hundred times more cold-blooded than she had expected. If she had known earlier, she should have controlled herself!

She gritted her teeth and hung up the phone. Although she could not accept the fact that she had lost her uterus, she knew how cruel Nox could be and could only accept Nox’s threat. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zoe waited in the ward for almost half an hour. Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and Mrs. Winter appeared in the ward with an anxious expression.

She asked bluntly, “Where’s the child?”

Zoe gritted her teeth and said, “The child has been aborted.”

“Are you crazy? How could you allow Nox to abort the child? Why didn’t you call me? You knew to inform me yesterday but not today?” Mrs. Winter could not but tear up.

She had been waiting for a grandson for a long time, and now, that opportunity was gone. She was already in her fifties. In a few years, she would be too old to carry her grandchild. Moreover, with Nox’s current attitude, she did not even know if she could have a grandson. How could she let it go like that? “It’s not Nox’s child, so you don’t have to feel sad about it.” Zoe suddenly spoke up.

Stunned, Mrs. Winter looked at Zoe in disbelief.. She thought she had misheard!
