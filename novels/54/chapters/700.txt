“Someone was following you, but he didn’t do anything to you. So, I think you should know that this person was just making sure that something happened. As expected, he probably wanted you to have sex with Sarah. Once you’ve slept with Sarah, that would be the end of your and Monica’s relationship.”

Finn agreed with Jeanne’s logic.

“I think we both know who this person is.”

Yes. They both knew that Michael had ulterior motives.

However, Monica did not believe it.

Hence, Monica would be hurt by Michael in the end, or Michael would give up a lot for Monica, but it was not his problem to consider anymore.

That was Monica’s choice.

“You don’t care if Monica was deceived, right?” Jeanne did not get Finn’s reply, so she asked him.

“That was her choice, and she has to bear the consequences.”

Jeanne did not try to persuade him further because Finn was right.

She always felt that between Finn and Monica, Finn had tried very hard to keep the relationship. Otherwise, he would not change his mind so drastically.

She said, “Alright. I’m just telling you that Michael might do something to you. Be careful.”

“Thank you,” Finn thanked her politely.

Then, Jeanne hung up the phone thoughtfully.

Right now, she really did not want to stir anything between Finn and Monica. What she was worried about was that Monica might not be able to accept the truth when she found out as Monica had not experienced anything difficult.

Outside the room, there was a sudden knock on the door.

Jeanne’s eyes darted to the door. “Come in!”

Amy reported in a hurried voice, “President Lawrence, something bad has happened. Our agents are now openly protesting against you, saying that you deprived them of their hard-earned money and that you forced them into a dead end. Now, all the agents are causing trouble at the entrance of the company, and the media and reporters are coming!”

Jeanne’s expression darkened.

What kind of trouble was it again?

She hurriedly got up and walked out of the office.

Before she could settle one problem, another problem followed. It seemed like some people’s methods were endless!

Together with Amy, she walked directly to the entrance of Lawrence Enterprise’s hall.

At that moment, many people had gathered at the entrance and were making a fuss. They were holding up banners and signs, agitatedly denouncing Lawrence Enterprise for their unkindness and injustice to them. The finger was even pointed directly at Jeanne, saying that she was backing them into a corner and forcing them to die…

Jeanne could hear the curses directed at her from far away at the entrance.

Quite a number of reporters had gathered at the scene and were excitedly conducting interviews.

The security guards at the entrance had been stopping the troublemakers from rushing into the hall. It was a mess.

Jeanne took a deep breath.

“President Lawrence,” Amy called out to her. “If you go over like this–”

“They can’t hurt me,” Jeanne said.

Without any hesitation, she walked straight to the door.

Just as she walked out, the crowd was in an uproar.

“Jeanne, I can’t believe you still have the nerve to come out! You’re the cold-blooded businessman who has destroyed my family!”

“You forced us to a corner and caused us to have nothing. If you don’t give us an explanation today, we won’t leave even if we die!”

“I’ve been with Lawrence Enterprise for 20 years and invested all of my capital into the Lawrence Enterprise, yet this is what becomes of me. I can’t accept this!”

…

Everyone was very agitated.

In reality, Jeanne did not know what they were making a fuss about.

Moreover, who were those people? Lawrence Enterprise’s employees? Employees from other branches?

It did not seem like it, though.

“Jeanne, why aren’t you speaking? Do you think you can dismiss us just because you don’t speak? Dream on! We will be here until we die!” A middle-aged man cursed at Jeanne.

Jeanne glanced at him and said, “Who are you guys?”

“Ha.” Another man laughed out of anger. “She doesn’t know us! No wonder she managed to trick us so badly.”

Jeanne really did not know who they were, but she tried her best to act calm.

She said, “Should I know you guys?”

“I’m the physical store agent of South Hampton City’s largest Lawrence Electrical store. I’m Rick Gordon!” The man introduced himself fiercely.

Then, the few people around him introduced themselves.

“I’m the south region’s general agent, Greg Norton.”

“I’m the western region’s...”

It turned out they were all physical store agents.
