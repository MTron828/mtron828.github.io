1131 The War Has Started: The Battle of Wits Between Jeanne and Edward

“So what should we do now?” Nox asked.

“Strike first and gain the upper hand,” Edward said bluntly.

Nox frowned. He did not have the patience to think about something so deeply.

However, Edward did not answer Nox either. Instead, he picked up the phone and dialed a number. “Finn.”

“Yes, Fourth Master.”

“How’s George?” Edward asked.

“He’s with me. Do you need me to send him back?”

“No need. I’ll get Teddy to come over. He’ll stay with you for the time being.”

“Alright,” he said.

“Did you say that the Sanders was most likely involved in Gary’s surgery?” Edward asked.

“Yes, it’s still under investigation.”

“There’s no need to investigate anymore. Just announce to the world everything that the Sanders has done to the Cardellinis and that they used Michael to do their crimes.”

“What are you planning to do?” Finn frowned.

“Let the war break out!”

“Alright.” Finn agreed immediately.

In fact, as long as it was an order from Edward, he would do it.

“Get everything ready and wait for my good news.”

“Okay.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Edward hung up the phone and said to Nox, “Let the Sanders take care of themselves first.”

Nox really felt that if Edward died, he would be letting the heavens down!

At that moment, he had no choice but to say, “Edward, don’t be soft on Jeanne.”

That woman would not be soft-hearted to him.

“She’ll understand.” Edward was determined.

He believed that Jeanne would understand him, just like how he understood her.

In the face of national interest, they had to make their own choices. Once the dust settled, the winner would be king.

Then, no one would be able to blame anyone!

…

In the Sanders’ residence, Jeanne had returned and was standing in Warren’s study.

Other than Warren, Chester was also in the study.

The two of them acted very well.

Warren asked, “Why are you back so late? Have you had dinner? Is Edward not with you?”

“No,” Jeanne replied.

“Did you have a fight with Edward? Did Edward bully you? I’ll stand up for you.” Warren was very kind.

He could pretend that he did not know anything. He even looked very friendly.

“Father, Edward killed Kingsley,” Jeanne said.

Warren looked very surprised. At that moment, he said in disbelief, “Really? How could this be? Wasn’t everything fine yesterday? Weren’t you fine when you returned back to my side?”

“I want to talk to you about how to take down the Duncans’ power.” Jeanne enunciated every word.

At that moment, Warren had no choice but to remove his disguise.

He glanced at Jeanne and sighed heavily. “So you know.”

Jeanne nodded.

“I didn’t want to involve you in this, but...” Warren was helpless. “I just hope you can understand my difficulties.”

“I understand.” Jeanne said bluntly, “I just want to kill Edward and avenge Kingsley.”

“Alright.” Warren agreed immediately. “I will definitely satisfy your request.”

“Father, have you thought about what to do?” Jeanne asked.

Warren shook his head. “I was just talking to your brother about this. We’re at our wits’ end. You, too, know that I’m the leader of the country, so we can’t do as we please as we have to answer to our citizens. The current situation is that the Swans control the majority of Harken’s economy. If we touch them, it’s very likely that our economy will collapse. That’s one aspect. The other is that the Duncans, which the Swans support, have been stirring up trouble. We still don’t know who the Duncans are. If we knew, we would have just arrested them. But because we don’t know, too many innocent people will be sacrificed, and that is what makes us a little helpless now.”

“That person wasn’t important from the start.” Jeanne was straightforward.

Warren frowned.

Chester was also surprised.

“It’s best if you can find him, but it doesn’t matter if you can’t. After all, as long as we weaken his power, he’ll only be an empty shell. He can only hide for the rest of his life, and he won’t be of any use.”

Warren was shocked by Jeanne’s words.

He did not expect Jeanne to be so imposing.

Yet, he had been obsessed with finding that person.
