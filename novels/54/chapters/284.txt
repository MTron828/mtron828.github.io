Chapter 285: Jeanne Leaves, While George Is Kidnapped

‘Is this alright?!’

Either Jeanne took George with her and left, or she would die in South Hampton City!

Kingsley’s eyes moved slightly.

He had been enduring silently with his veins showing.

The car had been moving rapidly toward the airport.

Even after Jeanne had said this, Kingsley still did not speak.

Kingsley still let the limousine drive toward the airport.

At this moment, Jeanne did not know what to say to move Kingsley. She could not resist as well.

After all...

She could not even defeat Kingsley.

Not to mention, there was also Lucy.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Tears kept rolling in her eyes. They kept rolling but did not flow out.

The atmosphere was tense.

All of a sudden, Jeanne’s phone rang.

Her eyes moved slightly.

She instantly suppressed her emotions.

Jeanne looked at the phone number on the phone screen and saw the string of Arabic numbers.

She just looked.

Kingsley also looked.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and picked up the call.

Fourth Master Swan’s deep voice was heard. “Ms. Lawrence.”

Jeanne had changed her number, but he still knew.

So, it was confirmed that George was with him.

This was because Jeanne had only called Miles on this number.

Once Edward checked Miles’ phone, he would instantly know that this number was hers.

Jeanne said, “Fourth Master.”

“Where did you go?” Edward asked in a deep voice.

“Fourth Master, can I help you?” Jeanne tried hard to suppress her emotions.

She did not sound strange.

Edward lowered his head and looked at the silver-gray tie in his hand.

After leaving the shopping mall, he had been holding it in his hand. He said, “I’m waiting for you to help me tie my tie.”

“There are many people who want to tie your tie for you.”

“But I only need you.”

Jeanne held the phone tightly. At this moment, she could no longer act with Fourth Master Swan. After all, George was still in his hands.

She gritted her teeth. “Where’s George?”

Edward seemed to laugh.

He told her bluntly, “He’s with me.”

Jeanne’s expression instantly turned ugly.

“I saw that George skipped class, so I picked him up to Bamboo Garden,” Edward said casually.

Jeanne gritted her teeth when she heard that. “Don’t you lay your finger on George!”

“Of course, I won’t.” Fourth Master Swan agreed immediately. “Didn’t I tell you that I’ve taken a liking to your son?! How could I do anything to hurt him?! That said...”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

She heard Fourth Master Swan’s tone change, and his tone was cold. “If you don’t want him anymore, I can help groom him into someone like Nox and Finn...”

“Edward!” Jeanne called out his name angrily.

Edward did not seem angry.

Instead, his voice was gentle. “It’s rare for you to call my name, Ms. Lawrence. I’m honored.”

“What’s the point of you taking George away?! You’re the fourth master of the Swans of South Hampton City. Don’t you think it’s despicable of you to treat a child like that?!”

“So your plan to leave me in the mall while I’m changing is not despicable?!” The person on the other end of the call asked.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“What do you want?”

“Nothing much. I just want you to come back,” Edward said bluntly.

Jeanne’s hand trembled as she held her phone.

“I’ll wait for you.” Edward did not seem to be expecting Jeanne’s reply.

After saying that, he hung up the phone.

Jeanne was furious.

She turned her eyes and glared at Kingsley.

Kingsley was also looking at her.

The two of them looked at each other.

Neither of them compromised.

The driver was also very calm as she drove toward the airport.

There was a stalemate for a long time.

Jeanne said, “You definitely won’t let me go back, right?!”

Kingsley’s eyes moved slightly as he nodded.

“Then can you guarantee that you’ll bring George back?!”

“I promise.” Kingsley nodded.

“Kingsley, if George is gone, I won’t be able to live either,” Jeanne said clearly.

“Me neither,” Kingsley responded clearly.

Jeanne bit her lip tightly.

Kingsley had never lied to her.

He had never been unable to do what he promised her.

Jeanne said, “Alright, I believe in you.”

She compromised. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She compromised so quickly.

As Lucy drove, she still could not believe her ears.

She did not expect that Jeanne would be the one to compromise instead of Kingsley.

Based on her understanding of Kingsley, he might have given in if Jeanne was a little more unreasonable.
