1204 It’s A Girl

She had no place to go, so she stayed there for three months, during which Teddy was the only one who had spent the most time with her.

As for Edward, he had finally returned to Alex’s side after a month of stalemate. In fact, he had no other choice. After all, he was Alex’s brother. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She had only found out about Edward and Alex’s identities a long time later.

After verifying Edward and Old Master Swan’s DNA and confirming their father-son identity, she no longer suspected that Edward had anything to do with the Duncans. It was probably that not only her but everyone else no longer suspected Edward’s identity.

However, who would have thought that in order to leave Alex a brother, Alex’s mother would be willing to give birth to Edward with Old Master Swan, a man who was almost twice her age?

It was no wonder that for the sake of the Duncans’ great cause, Edward could risk his life to that extent,

She used to be curious.

After all, the great undertaking of the Duncans was ultimately Old Master Swan’s matter. If Edward was really unwilling to get involved, there was nothing Old Master Swan could do about it. It was only later that she found out that it had always been Edward’s matter too.

Therefore, it was only natural that Edward would compromise.

She remembered that Alex had personally come to take him away that day.

At that time, she was four months pregnant, and her belly was not very obvious. It was almost invisible when she wore loose-fitting clothes.

Hence, Alex took the initiative to ask, “Are you really pregnant?”

He was still suspicious about whether she was lying to Edward on purpose.

She said, “Four months.”

Alex just nodded.

Jeanne could not read his emotions. In fact, she had always felt that Alex’s ruthlessness was inherent.

That night, Edward left with Alex, and it had been two months since then.

In the beginning, they would video call each other, talk on the phone, and send messages, but now… It was as if she had lost all contact with Edward.

In the afternoon, Finn came to Bamboo Garden to give her a prenatal checkup.

Who would have thought that as a cardiologist, he would also have to work part-time as an obstetrician too?

One of the rooms in Bamboo Garden had also been specially converted into an ultrasound room for her.

Jeanne was lying on the bed while Finn gave her an ultrasound that happened once a month.

“The baby is growing well. She’s very proportionate,” Finn said while performing an ultrasound.

“You think so?”

“It’s a girl. I’ve told you that before, right?” Finn said with a smile.

“Yeah.”

“Does Fourth Master know?” Finn asked.

“I don’t know,” Jeanne said. However, she felt that she did not make herself clear enough. “I don’t know if he knows.”

After all, he was so busy.

When she found out that the baby was a girl, she gave Edward a call, but he did not pick up. Then, later on, she sent him a message, but he did not reply either. Hence, she wondered if he was too busy to read her message.

She did not know whether he knew or not.

“Fourth Master should be very busy.” It was always easy for Finn to guess what was on her mind, so he would comfort her.

“Yes.” Jeanne knew.

To be able to do so many things in such a short period of time, such as throw the entire Harken into chaos and control all of this chaos, was not a simple thing.

It was not something ordinary people could do.

“But it should be ending soon.” Finn thought for a moment and said, “Now, all that’s left is for Alex to take the stage successfully. It might happen in a day or two.”

Jeanne thought so too. Therefore, she was in a good mood today.

“Right, how’s Monica?” Jeanne suddenly asked him.

At the mention of Monica, Finn’s expression changed slightly.

In fact, Jeanne did not expect Monica and Finn to get back together again.

One day, when Finn came over to do a prenatal checkup for her, he inadvertently said, “Monica and I are together.”

When he said it, there was even a smile on his lips.

It was… the look of being in love. If not for that look, she would have thought that Finn was joking.

She thought that Monica had really let go of their relationship. However, on second thought, if Monica had let it go, she would not have risked her life to save Finn.

Hence, she accepted the fact that they were back together again very calmly.

“She’s recovering very quickly. She has started working in the company already,” Finn replied.
