Chapter 282: Jeanne Leaves, While George Is Kidnapped

Jeanne smiled and asked, “Is there anything for a man?”

“Ms. Lawrence, are you buying something for Fourth Master?” The assistants here were all smart people, so they could naturally figure it out.

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

The moment she nodded, she clearly saw the man beside her smile.

He smiled without batting an eyelid.

“Ms. Lawrence, this way please.” The assistant quickly invited Jeanne to the men’s area. “We have men’s bags, clothes, shoes, belts, accessories, and perfume. Ms. Lawrence, I can introduce you to whatever you need.”

“I’ll go to the clothing area and take a look.”

“Okay.” The assistant was respectful.

Jeanne picked out the men’s clothes one by one under the assistant’s introduction.

“Ms. Lawrence, this suit is the new style of our designer. It’s 100% handmade, and the details are exquisite. Even the buttons were meticulously polished by our designer,” the assistant introduced.

Jeanne nodded and turned to look at Fourth Master Swan. “Fourth Master, do you like it?”

Edward did not look at it, but he just nodded.

“Can he try it?”

“Of course,” the assistant quickly said.

Next, the assistant got someone to take it down and said to Fourth Master Swan respectfully, “Fourth Master, this way please.”

Edward took a look at Jeanne.

Jeanne said, “I’ll wait for you here.”

Edward nodded.

He turned around and followed the assistant.

“Wait.” Jeanne suddenly called out to him.

Edward turned around.

Jeanne walked to the tie area at the side and picked out a silver-gray tie.

She always felt that Edward suited the color very much.

As such, she let the assistant take it down and said, “Pair it with this.”

“Ms. Lawrence, your taste is really good. This tie is the most exquisite tie we have this season. It doesn’t look outstanding at a glance, but it’s the one that our designer put the most effort into designing,” the assistant complimented her and added with a smile, “It’s also the most expensive one.”

Jeanne smiled and handed the tie to Fourth Master Swan.

Edward took a look at the tie. He suddenly bent down and leaned close to her ear. He said, “When I come out later, help me tie it.”

Jeanne’s heart moved slightly.

Even so, she smiled without changing her expression.

She responded, “Okay.”

At the same time, Fourth Master Swan kissed her ear again.

It was as if they were naturally intimate after they had finished speaking.

Jeanne’s face was slightly red.

After all, they were in public. Especially when she saw the assistant, she turned her head away in embarrassment.

Fortunately, although Fourth Master Swan was a hooligan, he would not go too far in public. After kissing her, he walked into the changing room with the assistant.

They walked into the changing room.

The smile on Jeanne’s face disappeared.

‘Goodbye, Fourth Master.’

Jeanne placed the tie on the sofa at the side and turned around to go to the counter. She used her phone to pay for Fourth Master Swan’s entire set of clothes and tie. Then, she left.

From then on, she left.

The moment Edward changed his clothes and came out, what was waiting for him was not Jeanne, who promised to tie his tie, but an assistant.

She smiled and held the tie respectfully in her hand as if she was waiting for Edward to come out.

She asked, “Fourth Master, do you need me to help you tie your tie?”

Edward’s expression... could not be described.

At that moment, the assistant seemed to have noticed something strange. She quickly explained, “Ms. Lawrence said that she had something to do and left first. However, she has paid for your suit and tie.”

“Did she say anything?”

“She didn’t say anything,” the assistant replied respectfully.

‘She didn’t say anything!

‘Very well.’

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

The sudden cold aura made the assistant swallow the words that were about to come out of her mouth.

…

Jeanne left the mall very smoothly and left in front of Fourth Master Swan in one piece. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She did not know if Fourth Master Swan would come looking for her after he found out that she had left.

Perhaps he would, but it would not be easy to find her.

Jeanne did not leave immediately after she left the mall.

She went to the communications business hall outside the mall and bought a new SIM card.

Jeanne knew very well that given Fourth Master Swan’s ability in the city, it would be very easy for him to locate her through her SIM card. She still had many calls to make, so she could not use her original phone card. It would also take some time for Fourth Master Swan to guess that she had changed the phone card.

At this time, she should have left long ago.
