Chapter 794: Monica Discovers Michael’s Disguise

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The two of them looked crazy.

Michael gritted his teeth. In the end, he stepped forward and grabbed Monica’s hand with all his might.

Monica was in pain.

As soon as Monica let go, Reese escaped Monica’s shackles.

Reese’s face was ferocious, her hair was messy, and there was a mark on her forehead. Her clothes were also torn, and she looked disheveled.

Reese had never been bullied like that before. Hence, she stepped forward, intending to hit Monica again, when Michael pulled her back.

“Enough!”

“Are you just going to let Monica hit me?!” Reese looked at Michael in disbelief.

Since Michael was young, she had always lived a pampered life because of Michael’s father’s protection, and Michael had always been a very filial son. Moreover, she had had a high status in the family all these years, and her son had never resisted her like that before.

However, for the sake of Monica, this unpresentable b*tch…

“How much more do you want to destroy my relationship with Monica?” Michael was filled with anger.

Without caring about his feelings, Reese said bluntly, “Monica isn’t worthy of you. She’s not qualified to be the Rosses’ daughter-in-law–”

“Have you forgotten everything I told you? ” Michael said angrily.

“Even so, we have to teach Monica a lesson and let her know that in our family, she has no right to act as she pleases! She has no right to stir up trouble, ” Reese said fiercely. “If she’s to marry into our family, she’ll have to be obedient to us.”

Monica watched the argument between Reese and Michael coldly before turning around and running away from them.

Michael’s eyes narrowed. Then, he turned around and glared at Monica’s back.

Monica ran out of the restaurant frantically, stopped a taxi, and got into the back seat.

She had had enough of Michael, Reese, and the Rosses. She wanted to break up with Michael now and announce it to the world.

From then on, the Rosses would never show up in her world again.

She clutched her chest in pain.

Everything that had happened today was enough to give her a mental breakdown.

To think her good intentions had been trampled on by Michael. Just how stupid was she to let others trample on her to that extent?

Her tears blurred her vision, and she cried her heart out.

The taxi driver wanted to say something a few times, but he held back when he saw how emotional the passenger was.

Finally, he made up his mind and asked, “Miss, where are you heading to?!”

Monica’s trembling body stopped for a second, and she looked up. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Only then did she realize she was still outside the restaurant and had even forgotten that she had not told the driver where to go.

She laughed sarcastically, which made her look even sadder than when she was crying.

Where else could she go?

Suddenly, she felt that she could not go anywhere.

After being deceived like that, who else could she face?

Before this, she had confidently told everyone that she did not regret helping Michael. She even told everyone that Michael was worth her while…

She suppressed her emotions, and with a choked voice, she told him the address of her apartment.

She could only return to where she was alone as she did not deserve anyone’s sympathy.

The driver started the car and drove to the address Monica gave him.

Monica was looking out of the window, at the dazzling South Hampton City.

In such a prosperous and glorious city, she really felt like a joke.

Ever since she was young, she had never been good at everything. Her grades, hobbies, and work were all bad, but she had never felt inferior because of that. She did not even think there was anything wrong with her because she could live a carefree and happy life…

However, it was only today that she realized she was stupid. She was so stupid that even she looked down on herself.

She tried to stop herself from crying.

At that moment, her eyes suddenly narrowed when she passed by a familiar intersection that could make her heart ache every time she saw it.

She suddenly called out to the driver, “Stop the car.”

The driver was stunned, but he quickly stopped by the side.

Monica took out some money from her bag. “Keep the change.”

The driver watched as Monica opened the door and got out of the car.

It was so late in the night. For getting out of the car mid-journey, was the woman not afraid of running into danger?
