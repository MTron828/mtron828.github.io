Chapter 844 Monica Begins to Fight Back, and Finn Saw Her Wound

George was calm.

“Aren’t you an expert hacker?” Monica could not wait.

She wanted to quickly forget many unhappy things.

“What do you want to do?” George felt his blood run cold.

“I’ll send you some stuff. Can you keep them online and not let them be taken down? ”

“I should be able to,” George answered conservatively.

“Great.” Monica was very happy.

She felt that she had suddenly become smarter.

At home, she had been thinking about how to stop Michael from marrying her. Now that the media was under Michael’s control, she could not expose any news at all. Just as she was at her wit’s end, she had an idea. Was her godson not a great hacker?!

With such huge backing, it would be a waste not to use it.

After that, Monica came to Bamboo Garden in a hurry to find George.

“For the next few days, you’ll listen to my arrangements. I’ll send you some stuff, and you’ll help me make them trending such that they won’t be taken down for a few days, okay?” Monica confirmed again.

“I can try.”

“My son is the most reliable person,” Monica could not help but praise George. “I love you so much.”.

As she said those words, she even hugged George’s face and kissed him.

George’s face turned red.

“George, are you shy?” Monica teased him.

“No, I’m not.”

“You’re blushing,”

“...A man and a woman can’t be too intimate with each other. Stay away from me.” George was exasperated.

“That won’t do. Now that you’re young, I can still take advantage of you. When you grow up, you’ll belong to your wife!”

‘No way,’ George thought to himself.

He would always belong to his mom.

At most, he would let his godmother have a piece of him.

The two of them laughed in the living room.

They seemed very happy.

Finn just stood on the second floor and looked at Monica’s carefree smile.

He was holding a box of anti-inflammatory medicine for her to prevent infection.

He had searched the hall for a while just now but could not find it, so he went upstairs to Fourth Master Swan’s room to get a box of it.

“Do you think that Monica is heartless?” Nox suddenly appeared beside Finn.

Finn took the opportunity to put the box of medicine in his hand into his pocket.

“I thought that Monica would be in great pain after being forced to get married by Michael. When I saw the wound on her wrist just now, I really thought that she was in great pain. I didn’t even dare to score 0 points on my exam when I was young, but Monica was the kind of person who would do that and would still feel good after that. The key is that even when Jeanne scored 100 points and created such a strong contrast between them, Monica’s mentality was still surprisingly good. I always felt that someone like her would never commit suicide unless she was really living in pain, but obviously, I seem to have misjudged her again,” Nox muttered.

Finn did not reply.

Nox continued, “In that case, her suicide might’ve been by impulse. Just like me, she never considers the consequences. In the past, seeing her made me feel like we’re old friends… Forget it. I’m a loyal friend, so I’ll definitely stand on your side.”

‘As for Monica, I’ll let that unsophisticated girl live and die on her own.’

“Dr. Jones, Young Master Winter, lunch is ready,” the chef suddenly called out to Finn and Nox from the main hall.

As Teddy had been accompanying Edward in the room, the chef had to get them himself.

“Alright,” Nox responded.

At this moment, Monica was still playing with George in the living room. She did not expect it to be noon already.

She sensed Finn and Nox coming down from the second floor and hurriedly stood up from the sofa. She patted George’s small head. “I’m going back. Don’t forget our agreement.”

George nodded.

The moment he nodded, he was a little reluctant to part with Monica.

Even so, he would not say it. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Monica smiled at George and waved him goodbye. She left the hall before Finn and Nox came down.

Nox watched Monica leave.

He suddenly felt that she looked lonely, and he felt a little uncomfortable about that.

He did not think too much about it and said indifferently, “Monica still knows her limits. She’s not thick-skinned enough to stay for lunch.”

From the beginning to the end, Finn did not say a word after Nox mentioned Monica.

Monica walked out of the Swans’ courtyard.

The smile on her face also gradually faded away after she left.

She suddenly felt that it was not easy to live alone.

Monica walked far away from the main gate before she managed to hail a taxi and got in.

She looked out of the window at the scenery of South Hampton City.

Monica seemed to be lost in her thoughts frequently during this period of time.

She could not help but look down at her bandaged wrist.

Sometimes, she felt that everything was a luxury.

She felt that it was a luxury to get Finn to get close to her no matter what method she used.

Monica pursed her lips.

She took out her phone.

With one hand, she opened her contact list and made a call.

“Miss Monica, what made you call me?” An excited voice could be heard from the other end. “Aren’t you getting married to Director Ross soon? Are you sending me an invitation?”

“Let’s not talk about the invitation for now. You said that I’m getting married soon, so I should seize my last chance to have fun while I’m still single.”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. What’s your grand plan before your wedding?” The other party could not help but tease her.

“Let’s meet at the usual place tonight. Call all the pretty boys you have over.”

“Monica, you’re not joking with me, right?”

“When did I ever joke?”

“You’re getting married soon. This isn’t good.”

“I only want it since I’m getting married. That’s all. See you there at 8:00 pm tonight.”

“…”

Monica abruptly hung up the phone.

Michael could not possibly marry a woman who did not know how to behave, right?!
