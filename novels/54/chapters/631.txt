Chapter 632: The Identity of Jeanne’s Mother Exposed, Alexander’s Tragic Ending

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He could tell that Jeanne’s mood was low after she came out of the detention center.

It was probably because it was her father, so she would still be somewhat emotional.

However, she was just more tolerant than the average person.

Only after a long time did Jeanne open the car door.

The moment she got out of the car, she said, “Will you be following me for this period of time?”

Finn was startled, but he nodded slowly. “Yes. Fourth Master has told me to take good care of you.”

“Does he really mean that?” Jeanne turned her head to look at Finn.

Both their gazes met, and Finn dodged her gaze.

At that moment, Jeanne’s gaze made him feel a little overwhelmed, and he had a feeling that Jeanne knew a lot of things.

He said, “Fourth Master only told me to take good care of you.”

Jeanne smiled and said, “And keep an eye on me in the meantime.”

Finn pursed his lips.

He was not a person who was good at expressing himself.

There were some things that were hard for him to say, but at that moment, he managed to explain to Jeanne, “Fourth Master loves you very much.”

Jeanne looked at Finn.

“He’s worried about your safety,” Finn added.

Jeanne smiled.

However, he would still be on guard against her.

She said, “Thank you for sending me back. Be careful on your way back.”

With that, Jeanne got out of the car and left without saying anything more.

Finn, on the other hand, stared at Jeanne’s back.

He did not know what kind of relationship Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne had, but he knew very well that Jeanne would never be in danger by Fourth Master Swan’s side.

At least, her life would not be in danger.

It would all depend on Jeanne’s final choice!

…

Jeanne had just left in the detention center when Jenifer brought Joshua to see Alexander.

The moment Alexander saw Jenifer, he began to break down again.

He said, “Have you thought of a way to save me? Have you thought of a good way to save me?”

Although Jeanne had angered him until he was almost driven mad, what he cared about the most now was whether he would be sentenced to death — whether he would die immediately!

However, Jenifer was still putting on an act at this point. Back then, her so-called love for Alexander was only because she wanted to marry into a rich family. She was just greedy for vanity, and in terms of how much she really felt for Alexander... To her, she loved Alexander’s wealth even more! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yet now, she did not want to blow up the “relationship” with Alexander yet. After all, she still wanted Alexander to transfer all of his 5 percent shares to Joshua.

She said, “Don’t worry. I’m already looking for a lawyer to settle it. I’ll think of a way to get the court to deal with it as leniently as possible.”

“You have to think of a way. I can’t die like this!” Alexander ordered.

He could not die and refused to die like that.

He still had to kill Jeanne and avenge himself!

“Okay,” Jenifer agreed immediately and said, “Alexander, I have something important to tell you.”

“What is it?” Alexander looked at Jenifer fiercely.

At the thought of what Jeanne told him just now, he suppressed his anger.

He did not want to believe Jeanne at first, but his thoughts would inevitably guide him that way.

Especially when Jeanne said that with Penelope’s ability, she would have taken Lawrence Enterprise for herself long ago if she wanted to. She would not have held the management rights for so many years and not taken any shares. According to common sense, he could not refute that theory. Thinking back, if it were not for him killing Penelope back then, perhaps it would really be like what Jeanne said. The Lawrences would be able to stand side by side with the Swans now, and he would still have a family with both children!

He would not have ended up where he was now!

His veins were popping in anger, but he held it in at that moment and did not say it out loud.

If he said it out loud, he would only humiliate himself and regret his actions even more.

“Now that Jeanne is threatening our family, I’m afraid she’ll snatch Lawrence Enterprise from us. In that case, you should transfer your shares to Joshua first. Only once Joshua has more shares in his hands and becomes the chairman will he be able to go head to head with Jeanne,” Jenifer said straightforwardly.

“Have you thought of how to deal with Jeanne?” Alexander asked.

“There will always be a way.” Jenifer did not want to explain so much to Alexander now.

He was about to die anyway, so it was useless for her to tell him more.

“You can’t win against Jeanne. Even if I give you all my shares, you can’t win!” Alexander gritted his teeth.

He finally understood why Jasmine and Joshua were so useless!
