Chapter 806: Monica Committed Suicide (Not Dead)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She reached for her phone.

Last night, she announced their breakup on Facebook, so there should be a lot of comments today, and it should have also caused a small sensation.

She had been thinking about how to minimize the impact on Michael after she broke up with him. but now… she did not have to think about anything.

However, when she opened Facebook, she was stunned for a few seconds.

She thought there was something wrong with her account because how could the content she posted on Facebook suddenly disappear?

She was so ??heartbroken last night that she did not care about anything, but she was sure that she had posted the message.

There was no way it would disappear.

She repeatedly logged into her account a few times to make sure that the system was not acting up. Only then did she suddenly realize that there was something fishy about the matter.

Hence, she gritted her teeth and sent another message.

This time, she did not turn off her phone after posting the message. instead, she stared at her phone and waited for the post to explode.

She waited for half an hour, yet no one commented, and even the view count was zero. Could it be that the system had swallowed it up?

How was that possible?

Monica refused to believe it and posted three more posts.

However, the result was the same as the first one — it was swallowed by the system.

Monica then seemed to have realized something and tried to keep calm.

She calmly registered another account and posted a random post on that Facebook account.

There was no problem with it.

Although no one was paying attention to the new account, there were at least a few views, unlike the first post where no one could see it except for her.

She thought for a moment before using her new account to post a message on Facebook saying, “Michael and Monica have broken up.”

Not long after it was posted, the post was automatically deleted.

Monica was so angry that she was about to explode, but she told herself not to panic.

It was impossible for Michael to hide everything, and she refused to believe that her news would not be released.

Hence, she used her alternate account to comment on Facebook. “Michael and Monica have broken up. From now on, the two of them will go their own ways.”

Sure enough, after the announcement, many onlookers instantly started to comment on her comment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

However, it did not take long for the comment to be deleted.

She even wanted to post another comment on her alternate account, but a message popped up saying that her account was at risk of breaking the law and that Facebook had temporarily turned off her comment function.

Monica was so angry that she smashed her phone!

Needless to say, Michael was secretly manipulating it!

She really did not expect that Michael would do such a thing to her one day. She had never thought that the man whom she thought treated her the best would actually do that to her!

No.

She was not someone who would submit to adversity.

With that, she picked up the phone that she had thrown on the bed and started to search for the media’s phone number.

Since she loved gossip, she had added many of the tabloid media’s phone numbers because she wanted to know the inside information at the first moment. Yet now, it finally came in handy.

She made a call.

The other party teased, “Ms. Cardellini, what pleasure do I owe you for this call? We haven’t been in contact for so long that I thought you don’t want any news from me anymore.”

“Mr. Editor, I’m not looking for you for more news today. Instead, I’ve got an exclusive news for you.”

“Oh? What do you have for me today?”

“I’ve broken up with Michael. Do you want the latest insider story?” Monica asked bluntly.

The other party was stunned for a second.

Monica seemed a little excited. “I guarantee that with the latest resources, you’ll easily get a front page.”

“Please don’t joke around, Ms. Cardellini. Stop teasing me. Michael just announced that you’re going to marry him soon, and you’re saying you’ve broken up? Do you want me to broadcast this news and get beaten to death?! Ms. Cardellini, did I do something wrong? Tell me, and I’ll change my ways!”

“What did you just say?” It took Monica a few seconds to react before she realized what she heard on the phone.

“Huh?” The other party was dumbfounded.

“I say, what did you just say? You said Michael and I announced our marriage?” Monica was furious.

“Yeah, haven’t you seen the news? It’s trending now, and it has suppressed the news about Jenifer and Eden for the past two days. By the way, Ms. Cardellini, we’ve known each other for many years. Do you think you can leave some of your news for me? I–”

Monica abruptly hung up the phone.
