Chapter 41: All the Good Things Had Become a Nightmare

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Next time you kiss me, remember to stick out your tongue.” Fourth Master Swan’s deep voice was magnetic.

Jeanne’s entire body exploded.

There was no next time! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

She would also stay far away from him in the future!

Jeanne left in a huff.

The man behind her raised his head, and it was obvious that he was smiling.

Jeanne walked out of Fourth Master Swan’s room.

The place where Fourth Master Swan lived was very big with a typical black and white style. It was very similar to the feeling that he gave people…

No.

It was not similar.

Fourth Master Swan was much showier than these buildings.

Jeanne suppressed her raging fire and returned to the car.

The driver sent Jeanne away.

When she left, she passed through a large bamboo forest.

Under the night sky, the breeze blew, creating a different scene.

Jeanne could not help but ask, “Does Fourth Master like bamboos a lot?”

“Yes,” the chauffeur said respectfully, “Fourth Master planted these bamboos himself. He plants some bamboo every year, and they eventually turned into a bamboo forest.”

“Your master sure has a lot of free time.”

The chauffeur smiled and did not say anything else.

Soon, the car returned to silence.

The chauffeur seemed to want to make the atmosphere less awkward, so he took the initiative to speak again. “Actually, I’ve known you for many years, Ms. Lawrence. Back then, when you and Young Master Swan were dating, I already knew about you.”

“Really?” Jeanne was a little sarcastic. “Back then, I often came to the Swans’ residence to play.”

When she was dating Eden, Eden would also bring her here, but they would always go to the Swans’ Purple Pavilion Garden.

The driver glanced at Jeanne through the rearview mirror.

It was not because Jeanne often came to the Swan Residence. Since the gardens were separated, it was actually very difficult to see her. The driver knew her because there was once when she and Young Master Swan kissed at the main entrance, and he happened to be driving Fourth Master Swan back. Teddy and Young Master Winter were also in the car. At that time, Young Master Winter teased, “Didn’t they say that Jeanne doesn’t even let Eden hold her hand? He kissed her just like that?! Women are all pretentious!”

At that time, Young Master Winter said something bad about Ms. Lawrence and was kicked out of the car by Fourth Master Swan.

Thus, the driver had a deep impression of Ms. Lawrence.

The driver did not explain. After all, saying too much could lead to mistakes.

Especially for servants like them, how would they dare to gossip about their master’s matters?

At this moment, Jeanne sat in the car and felt a little lost.

She watched the car drive out of Bamboo Garden, through the park, and out of the manor.

Jeanne remembered when she was 18 years old, Eden accompanied her through her coming of age. Eden was drunk, so she sent him back. At the entrance, Eden dragged her out of the car and blocked her at the gate, saying that he wanted to give her a kiss no matter what. At that time, Jeanne had rejected him, and no matter how much Eden begged her, she did not give in. She thought at that time that once they got married, she would give him all the good things…

All the good things…

Jeanne sneered.

All the good things had become a nightmare.

In this life, it would be hard for her to fall in love again.

…

One day before Jasmine and Eden got married, more relatives came to visit the Lawrences.

Some were Lawrences, and some were from Jenifer’s family. Jeanne did not know most of them.

Jeanne brought George into the living room.

In the living room, a woman walked over with a child. She said very enthusiastically, “Jeannie, do you still remember me? I’m your aunt.”

Jeanne did not have much of an impression of her.

“You forgot about me. Back then, you and Jasmine came to our city to play. I even brought you to the pond to catch fish,” the person who called herself Jeanne’s aunt quickly said.

Jeanne remembered.

She was about 10 years old back then. One summer vacation, she followed Jasmine to Jenifer’s parents’ house to play. At that time, she did not think much of it. Now that she thought about how she almost drowned in the pond back then, she wondered if it was a conspiracy of this family.

The corners of her mouth curled up into a smile. “Ah, I remember now.”

This woman was Phoebe White, the wife of Jeremy, who was Jenifer’s only younger brother.

“We haven’t seen each other for so many years, and you’ve grown up to be so beautiful,” Phoebe praised repeatedly and quickly introduced, “Oh right, this is my youngest son, Paul. He’s exactly the same age as your son. They can play together.”

Jeanne glanced at Paul.

Phoebe was over 40 years old, but her son was only six years old. Jeanne had heard that in order to make Phoebe give birth to a son, the Fabians had forced her to have countless abortions. Their wish probably came through.

“Hello, Sister.” Paul was obviously very polite.

Jeanne nodded. “Hello.”

“Sister, can I play with George?” Paul asked.

Jeanne was very clear that George did not like to play with people of the same age. At that moment, in order not to cause unnecessary trouble, she squatted down and said to George, “Be good and play with Paul.”

George nodded somewhat reluctantly.

Jeanne patted George’s head.

Paul took the initiative to take George’s hand and left.

Jeanne watched them leave.

“Sister, can you come over and help me pick out wedding photos?” On the sofa in the living room, Jasmine took the initiative to ask.

Jeanne obviously knew that Jasmine was showing off.

At that moment, besides some gossipy old ladies, there were many men and women of the same age surrounding Jasmine. Everyone was giving her all sorts of compliments and flattery.

Jeanne refused, “No, I still have something to do. You and Eden are a perfect match. Any one of the photos will look good.”

As she said that, she walked out of the hall.

Jasmine watched her leave and sneered.

Someone beside her said, “Cousin, she must be jealous of you.”

Jasmine smiled smugly and turned around to choose the wedding photos that would be placed at the wedding venue the next day.

Jeanne walked toward the back garden.

Just now, George and Paul had walked this way.

It was not Jeanne’s fault for suspecting the Fabians. She was just very clear that those who were suddenly courteous must not have good intentions.

She had just taken a few steps when a man suddenly called out to her.

“Jeanne.”

It was as if the man had followed her out of the hall.

Jeanne turned her head.

She looked at the slightly tanned man. He had a buzz cut and was wearing an outdated suit. He looked at her and smiled foolishly.

“Don’t you recognize me? Back then, you came to our city with Jasmine. I brought you and Jasmine out to play. You used to call me Brother Black Bull,” the man introduced himself.

It turned out to be Sam Zimmer, the son of Jenifer’s elder sister, Jade.

His skin was dark since he was young, so he was nicknamed Black Bull.

“I remember.” Jeanne nodded, but she was very unfamiliar with him. “Can I help you?”

“It’s just that I haven’t seen you for a long time, so I wanted to say hello to you.” Sam appeared a little shy.

Jeanne smiled and asked, “How are you doing now?”

“I’m working in our city now, and my job is alright. It’s just that my marriage a few years ago didn’t go well, so I divorced my ex-wife last year.”

“Oh,” Jeanne replied.

“I heard from my aunt that you’re single with your child too...”

“Brother Black Bull, Paul and my son went to the back garden just now. I’m a little worried about the two children. I’ll go take a look.”

“Okay.” Sam quickly agreed.

Jeanne turned around and left.

Sam watched her leave and sneered.

His aunt said that as long as he hooked up with this woman, he would be the son-in-law of the Lawrences in the future. Naturally, he would be rich and powerful!
