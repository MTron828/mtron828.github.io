Chapter 1775: Shelly Gets Drunk

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When Sarah spoke ill of Nox, she found Nox extremely vile and did not think Shelly should not have given herself to Nox just because he had saved Bella once. Nox was not worth it.

On the other hand, when Shelly heard Sarah’s disgust for Nox, she felt a little repulsed. Sarah was right about Nox not being a good man, but from their time together, he did not seem too bad. However, she could not say a good thing about him, so she did not refute Sarah.

After saying what she should, Sarah turned around. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Where are you going?” Shelly called out to her.” You’re drunk. Stop drinking. I’ll send you back.” “I’m not going back so early. I’m going to persevere until the end, just like how I do every time.”

“Sarah, if you keep drinking, your body won’t be able to take it.”

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing. Let me go.”

“Sarah…”

“Hey, I’m here to pee.” Sarah was speechless.

If she did not pee soon, she would pee herself. Hence, Shelly quickly let go of Sarah.

When Sarah went to the toilet, Summer walked out. In fact, there were now much fewer people in the private room with some people gone because they could not hold out anymore. Only a few people were around, singing loudly in the private room, and no one knew what they were singing.

After Sarah came back from the toilet, she started to drink with people in the private room again. Shelly could not understand how Sarah could drink so much and for so long. Fortunately, as soon as the clock struck midnight, Sarah could no longer hold out and lay on the sofa, motionless.

Shelly was also feeling dizzy at that time. She figured that if she had anything to drink, she would pass out. Therefore, she supported Sarah, who could barely walk and staggered out of the club. At that time, Benjamin was close to being drunk, so he was also a little dizzy. However, he insisted on following Shelly and sending her and Sarah off.

A few of them had just walked out of the entrance of the nightclub when they saw a man standing not far away. He was obviously waiting for them. Shelly took a closer look. Her vision was so blurry that it took her a long time to see it was Brandon, Sarah’s boyfriend.

Sarah always complained about Brandon, saying that he did not love her and only loved her cousin. To her, he was with her because he was responsible and forced to be with her after they slept together while they were drunk.

For some reason, Shelly did not think so. She did not think that Brandon was the type to sleep with anyone. Once they slept together, he would be serious about it, so she did not know why Sarah was so insecure.

She helped Sarah to Brandon and said, “Sarah is drunk.”

Brandon looked at Sarah, who could not even stand steadily but looked so valiant.

He said to Shelly, “Leave her to me.”

“Alright.” Shelly handed Sarah to Brandon.

Just as Brandon held Sarah’s arm, she resisted. As drunk people could not control their strength, she pushed Brandon away so abruptly that he almost fell to the floor. As people said.

‘Who are you? Why are you touching me?”

Brandon rolled his eyes. She claimed she was not drunk, but she was deliriously drunk. “I’m Brandon. Stop fooling around. I’ll send you back.” Brandon lowered his voice and said gently. “Brandon?” Sarah mumbled as she stared at the person in front of her, but her eyes were still blurry.

“I’ll send you back.” As he spoke, Brandon dragged her away.

“Don’t touch me.”

“Sarah.”

“Brandon, that big bad guy, knows nothing but bullying me. I hate Brandon. I even broke up with him! We’ve broken up for a long time!” Sarah shouted at Brandon.

Brandon pursed his lips. Although it was late at night, there were still some people coming and going at the entrance of the nightclub. Moreover, Shelly and the other man were looking at them, and it made him a little embarrassed.

“You’re drunk. We’ll talk when you’re sober!”

“I’m not drunk!” Sarah said righteously, “I’m very sober.. I know Brandon is a bad guy who bullies me and throws a tantrum at me! I’ve given up on him! Anyway, there are many fish in the sea-“
