972 How Should She Repay Jeannie?

The forensic pathologist even felt that Jeanne was more professional than him. She would even remind him of things that he had not thought of.

It really made the forensic pathologist mistakenly think that Jeanne used to be in their line of work.

The autopsy lasted from 6:30 p.m. in the afternoon until 3:00 a.m. in the morning.

The forensic pathologist tidied up everything and said to Jeanne, “The preliminary assessment is that the death was caused by drug poisoning. Judging from the reaction of the dead organs, it should be acute drug poisoning. A vaccine reaction may be one of the possibilities, but the final result still needs to go through a laboratory test to know what drug caused the death!”

“When can the results be out?”

“I’ll try to get back to you first thing tomorrow morning.”

“Thank you.” Jeanne was really grateful.

“You’re welcome.” The forensic pathologist said, “Dr. Jones and I have a good relationship. I once owed him a favor, so I will do my best to help him.”

Jeanne nodded and did not say anything case.

“I’ll head back then,” the forensic pathologist said.

“Alright.”

After the forensic pathologist left, Jeanne also left without wasting any more time.

A week was actually short, and she could not afford to waste a second. Moreover, from the looks of the current situation, she did not know if she had a week left.

She had to make all the preparations before the results came out.

The results would be out tomorrow, or to be precise, it should be today.

She walked out of the villa. It was extremely difficult to get a taxi at this time and place, so she had to walk to the main road outside the villa area to get a taxi.

As she walked, she called Monica. “Monica, how are things on your side?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At 3 a.m. in the morning, Monica’s tone was still clear.

She probably had not slept either. After all, it would probably be hard for her to fall asleep.

Along the way, Monica also called her twice, but she told Monica that it was not convenient to talk. Hence, she felt she had to answer some of Monica’s doubts. Today’s matter was a little urgent, and she did not have time to explain many things. She was afraid that Monica would go crazy thinking about it.

Monica was in the ward, sleeping on the accompanying bed with her mother.

When she received Jeanne’s call, she hurriedly got out of bed and walked out of the ward.

Ruby called out to Monica, but Monica said she had something to discuss with Jeanne and told Ruby to go to sleep.

At that time, Ruby was also a bit groggy, so she fell asleep again after wondering about Monica.

Monica was sitting alone in the corridor, talking on the phone. “The boy’s mother fainted because she was too sad, but she woke up after she was sent to the hospital. The doctor said she was fine and that she fainted mainly because she couldn’t accept the death of her child. Her emotions were unstable when she woke up, and I didn’t dare to stay with them for too long as I was afraid that I would piss them off. So, I went straight back to my dad’s ward to accompany him. My dad’s surgery is three days away. I’m afraid…”

Monica held it in for a second.

Jeanne gripped her phone tightly.

Monica changed the topic. It was probably because she did not want to talk too much about her father’s condition. She said, “At about 10 p.m. in the evening, I received a call from the nurse saying that the boy’s parents had been discharged from the hospital. Since the woman felt fine, I didn’t stop them.”

“It’s good to hear that they’re fine. There’s no need to monitor their every move.” Jeanne said, “And Monica, you don’t have to feel too burdened. It’s true that the boy’s death is still somewhat related to Cardellini Enterprise, but as long as it wasn’t intentional, you don’t have to feel guilty. Besides, the most important thing now is to find out the truth. That would be the best explanation for the boy’s innocent death.”

“Yes.” Monica nodded.

Jeanne knew what she was thinking, how to comfort her, and how to make her relax.

“Do you have anything to ask me?” Jeanne asked.

Monica pursed her lips.

Jeanne knew her very well.

Hence, she said, “Did Michael frame us on purpose? It wasn’t an accident that Michael got something on us. Everything was a trap he set up in advance. His goal is to make Cardellini Enterprise go bankrupt and to take revenge on me for exposing his true colors in front of everyone!”

“Not only that,” Jeanne said, “but I suspect that the Sanders is behind this.”

Monica gripped her phone tightly and had to suppress the impulsiveness in her heart.

“You’ll know after you’ve been in the business world for a long time. Right now, Harken’s economy of Harken is in the hands of the people, which means it’s not in the hands of the Sanders’ government. The economy is the lifeline of a country, and the Sanders hasn’t got a hold of that yet, so they want to take some private enterprises for themselves. Since the Sanders can’t do anything to the Swans yet, they can only start with the other families. And since the Cardellinis is second only to the Swans, it’s normal for the Sanders to take a fancy to you.”
