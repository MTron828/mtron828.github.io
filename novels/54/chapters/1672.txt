Chapter 1673: Jeanne Helps Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne felt that Nox was crazy over Shelly.

She said, “Tell me about your situation with Shelly. I’ll help you see if there’s still hope between the two of you.”

“I don’t want to tell you.” Nox refused. “If I tell you, you’ll definitely look down on me”

It meant he knew how bad he really was.

“Just say it. I won’t look down on you.” Jeanne tried to persuade him nicely. “You’re my savior. How would I dare to look down on you? I just want to help you and repay your kindness.”

Just like that, Nox was persuaded.

In fact, he had been very depressed recently. He could not tell anyone about the feelings that he had bottled up within him because he knew that if he said it, everyone would think he was evil. Hence, he would rather lie to himself.

However, Jeanne’s sudden kindness made him let down his guard and tell her everything. He also told her about his extremely vile methods, which he did not feel comfortable with doing, and found himself despicable. Now that he had poured his heart out, he felt much better.

Jeanne, on the other hand, just listened to Nox explain his situation with frustration. The more she listened, the uglier her expression became.

Nox was really making a fool of himself. She had no idea how the dignified young master of the Winters, the most popular person in Harken, would embarrass himself like that! Other than Nox, no one else in this world could do that to himself.

“Now that you’ve heard everything, give me your advice, ” Nox said anxiously.

“I don’t know what advice to give you.” Jeanne chuckled.

If it were anyone else, she would call him a sc*mbag. However, because Nox had saved her life, she could not be disrespectful to her savior. “As a bystander, I would advise you to let go,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Jeanne!” Nox flew off the handle.

“After all, you’re just courting death by doing this. Have you ever thought that even if you destroy Shelly and Benjamin’s relationship, Shelly might not accept you? Not only will she not accept you, but she will also hate you even more,” Jeanne said.

“I’m not afraid of her hating me. I just want to be with her. I can’t bear seeing her with any man.” Nox was exasperated and crushed.

“As long as she comes back to me, it doesn’t matter whether she likes me or not. I just don’t want her to be with another man.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“After you’ve done everything to get her back to your side, you will want her to love you. Humans are insatiable. Once you get what you want, you’ll want more. You’ll never be satisfied, ” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Not me. I’m a simple person; if I like it, I’ll take it for myself. As long as she belongs to me, I won’t ask much of her,” Nox said with certainty.

It was with that thought in mind that he could go against his conscience and use all those despicable methods to get Shelly.

Jeanne had a feeling that Nox would not listen to anything she said now.

Hence, she took a deep breath and asked, “Do you really have to have Shelly?”

“I have to have her no matter what. No one can stop me, not even Edward! Unless you kill me!” Nox enunciated each word firmly.

Jeanne thought about it for a moment. Considering Nox was so determined, she could only go against her conscience and help him. After all, the final result would be the same, and it would be better if… she could help soften the blow.

Jeanne said, “I’ll help you to woo Shelly. Stop using those suicidal methods.” “Did I hear correctly?” Nox raised his eyebrows.

He could not believe that Jeanne would help him. On the contrary, he thought she would curse and lecture him.

“I must return your kindness,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“I suddenly realize that you do have a conscience. No wonder Edward likes you so much,” Nox, who was grouchy just a moment ago, said smugly.

“How do you plan to help me? Shelly doesn’t like me. She even hates me to the core! ”

The man’s self-awareness rendered Jeanne speechless.

“Aren’t you pursuing Shelly now? You can go ahead but don’t use such a stupid method. Instead, write a short essay where you sincerely admit your mistakes, repent, and then write out your feelings for her. Show it to me after you’re done.”

“Damn, I’ve never been good at writing.” Nox broke down.”l’ll find someone to write it for me.”

“Do you think Shelly can’t tell that someone else wrote it? How dare you say you like Shelly when you’re so insincere? To think you have to get someone else to write your confession.”

“But I really can’t write.”

“Then, forget it.” Jeanne said, “I don’t think I need to help someone who only says that he likes me.”

“…I’ll write it!” Nox gritted his teeth.

“Write it out today.”

“Alright.”

“I’ll be waiting for your masterpiece.” Jeanne smiled.

For some reason, Nox felt that Jeanne was tricking him.. However, since he had done so much, he did not care about his image anymore!
