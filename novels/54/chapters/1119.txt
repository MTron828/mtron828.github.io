1120 The Identity of the Duncans’ Descendent Exposed

He said coldly, “You should know about this.”

Edward nodded.

He knew.

“Since you are clear about that, you should know that it’s not easy for the Duncans to get to where they are now. Every step the Duncans take is not easy!” Zachary said emotionlessly. He looked a little too serious and even cold-blooded. “The Duncans will not allow him to make any mistakes. Once he makes a mistake, all his efforts will be in vain.”

Edward was silent.

In fact, he already knew what his father was going to say.

“Since the Duncans have mobilized so many people and caused such a huge commotion, they’re prepared to succeed or die. To put it more clearly, since we’ve already made our move, Kingsley must die!”

Edward’s throat moved.

He had actually figured out that that would be the outcome because he could not become a threat to the Duncans.

Even if the Duncans would not bear to see him die, they would still make sacrifices in the face of the bigger picture.

However, that was the only way he could think of to save Kingsley — with his life.

Obviously, he had lost the bet.

“Alex is really despicable!” Nox suddenly said, his tone sarcastic.

Wade’s face darkened. “Shut up!”

“I’m going to die anyway, so why can’t I say anything?” Nox didn’t listen to his grandfather’s orders at all. He said without holding back, “If Alex doesn’t want to be the bad guy, I’ll let you do it. I’ll let you and Grandpa Swan kill your own son and grandson! I’m guessing that he didn’t give the order to kill us, but he has allowed you to make the decision. He knew that you wouldn’t ruin the Duncans’ great cause for your own selfish desires, so he let you bear the responsibility of being the bad person. You still put justice before family, and Alex is still the noblest person in the entire world.”

The more Nox spoke, the more sarcastic he became.

Wade’s expression also became more and more unsightly.

However, Nox did not care. “You see, the people who want to kill me and Edward are you and Grandpa Swan, not Alex. We don’t even have the right to blame Alex.”

“Nox!” Wade berated.

“I’m not afraid of death either. In any case, from the moment I was born, it was decided that I would die for Duncans’ cause. I just can’t understand why Alex would use such a despicable method. If he comes down now and tells Edward and me that we have to sacrifice our lives, I will die without hesitation. After all, in the face of the country’s justice, feelings are nothing. I’m not that afraid of death. However, the fact that he told you to choose whether we live or die makes him not worthy of my respect. He is not worthy of Edward and me to risk our lives for him!”

Wade rushed toward his grandson and wanted to scold him again.

“Nox is right. I shouldn’t have given Old Master Swan the right to make the decision.” When no one was paying attention, a person suddenly got down from the helicopter.

It was a man.

Everyone looked over and saw the man walking out with his personal bodyguards without any disguise.

Other than Kingsley and Kerby, many other members of the Duncans present had never seen him before as well.

At that moment, he was exposed to everyone, and his exposure meant that Kingsley had to die.

That was because if Kingsley did not die, he would not be able to hide his identity anymore.

Everyone knew that very well, and so did Kingsley.

After all, Old Master Swan’s appearance just now might have given them a chance to turn the situation around as they did hint the Duncans reluctance to part with Fourth Master Swan. However, there was really no way out now.

He just did not expect that the person whom the Sanders had spent so much energy and effort to find would actually be... right beside them.

It was actually someone that Warren had taken the initiative to befriend.

Warren would never have thought that his schemes would end up inviting a wolf into his house.

Perhaps it was really over for the Sanders.

The Duncans could deceive the Sanders and easily get close to them, yet the Sanders wanted to use Jeanne to try to destroy the entire Duncans’ power... He even found the Sanders ridiculous.

“Mr. Thorn.” The man took the initiative to greet him. “We meet again so soon.”
