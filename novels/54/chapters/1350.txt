1351 The Wedding: Last Night As A Bachelor

He was not affected at all by Monica’s disdain for him.

That was right. He did not care, and a truly powerful person would not care about what others said.

Candice went along with Edward and said awkwardly, “Yeah.”

“It’s very nice.” Edward gave her a positive affirmation.

“Thank you.” Candice smiled. “Do you want to try on your suit now?”

“Alright.” Edward agreed immediately.

It was as if he was just doing as she said and not because he was here to try it on.

While watching Edward walk into the changing room, Candice suddenly thought of what Monica had just said about the fact that no woman could reject a good-quality sc*mbag like Edward.

After waiting for a while, she saw him walk out in a gorgeous suit.

The style of the suit was really too formal. As it was the most official wedding in Harken, everything had to be appropriate. Therefore, even if the material was excellent, the style was nothing new. However, it looked good on Edward.

He carried a sense of indescribably noble and magnanimous that gave off the feeling of a noble and unattainable young master.

“Do I look good?” Edward looked into Candice’s eyes and smiled.

Candice came back to her senses. She could not believe that she was stunned for a second just now.

However, she nodded honestly. “It looks good.”

She was not flattering him at all. She honestly thought that no other man in the world could look more stunning than Edward.

When Candice affirmed him, the smile on Edward’s lips widened. Then, he walked up to Candice and suddenly held her hand.

Candice’s eyes flickered. She just could not help herself from feeling moved. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even though she knew that falling in love with him could lead to a bottomless abyss, she knew that she could not reject a good-quality sc*mbag like Edward.

Hence, she just silently allowed Edward to suddenly approach her. In fact, she was anticipating him kissing her.

As the two of them kissed passionately, the staff around him naturally avoided them with flickering eyes.

Candice used to feel uncomfortable when she first started doing that.

She did not know when it started, but even if there were countless people around her, she could forget all her reservations and be unrestrained with Edward.

She did not know whether she had become more thick-skinned or whether Edward’s kissing skills were really… good.

She would follow his rhythm and get into it.

The kiss lasted for a long time, until they were both panting.

Candice was panting because she could not breathe properly. Sometimes, when she was so engrossed in kissing, she would forget to breathe.

Therefore, at that moment, her face was flushed red, and she looked extremely shy.

Edward was panting only because… his desires were not satisfied. However, he had to try his best to control it.

Candice quietly adjusted her breathing in Edward’s embrace, while Edward hugged Candice and tried to control his desires.

The two of them hugged each other in silence until…

“Leader.” Edward’s assistant stepped forward respectfully.

Edward’s eyes flickered.

“It’s almost time. You have a dinner party tonight.” The assistant reminded him.

Edward nodded and let go of Candice.

The moment he let go, Candice looked up and saw the reluctance in Edward’s eyes.

He was reluctant to part with her, but he still let her go. That was probably the unknown sadness of being the leader of a country.

That was, he could not do whatever he wanted. He had to be very self-disciplined and could not act recklessly.

He said, “See you on the day of the wedding.”

Therefore, what he meant was that the next time they met would be on the day of their wedding, and they would not be able to see each other for the next few days.

She had to admit that she was also reluctant to part with him. She really wanted to… spend more time with him.

At that moment, she could only nod. “Alright.”

Edward glanced at Candice again before he turned around and strode away. At the same time, many people followed him and left.

It seemed to her that whenever she saw his back, she felt inexplicably uncomfortable.

It was not limited to the pain of parting with him, but it was as if she had been hurt before. The pain was in her chest, and she felt overwhelmingly sad.

…

The news of Harken’s Leader, Edward, getting married was considered major news in the Harken, and it was broadcasted on all the news platforms.

Tomorrow was the wedding day.

To be honest, when Monica saw the daily countdown of the wedding on the news and saw that only one day was left, she still found it a little hard to accept.
