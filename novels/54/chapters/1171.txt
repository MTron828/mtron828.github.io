1172 The War Has Started: William Gates’s Identity Exposed

“Otherwise, she’ll lose her life or be paralyzed and demented,” the doctor answered.

Warren’s expression was extremely ugly.

They still had not found William yet, so not to mention the few of them, he could not even let a fly go!

He said coldly, “Choose the most conservative way to treat her!”

“But–”

“Go!” Warren scolded.

The doctor did not dare to say anything else and returned to Stacey’s side for basic treatment.

At that moment, Chester could not help but look at Stacey and say, “Father, I think you should take Stacey to the hospital now. We’ll let them go and then arrange for the guards to monitor them the entire time. There shouldn’t be any problems–”

“Are you teaching me how to do things now?” Warren looked at Chester coldly.

“What I’m worried about is that Stacey won’t be able to make it and that she’ll pass the window for treatment–”

“Chester, has all the education I’ve given you all these years been in vain?!” Warren lectured him, “You can’t have any feelings when you’re doing great things! Even if it’s your own family, you should treat them equally! For someone as indecisive as you, who can’t weigh the severity of the situation, should I also consider whether I should make you my successor?”

Chester was embarrassed by Warren’s words.

Especially when he heard that Warren was considering changing his successor, Chester could not control his emotions at all.

Anger was written all over his face.

However, Warren did not care at all. He even scolded Chester, “You’re useless. Don’t stand in front of me. You’re an eyesore!”

Chester clenched his fists, gritted his teeth, and took a few steps back.

At the same time, Jeanne suddenly stepped forward and whispered a few words in Warren’s ear.

In Chester’s eyes, there was only jealousy and anger. What right did Jeanne have to gain all of Warren’s trust?

At that moment, Warren’s eyes lit up when he heard her words. It was his recognition of Jeanne.

After Jeanne finished speaking, Warren hurriedly followed her and led the group of people to the washroom outside the tea room.

The so-called most dangerous place was the safest place.

Jeanne thought about it for a long time. Then, she determined that Edward and William might return here.

In other words, when she had gone outside for a patrol earlier, she felt that Edward and William could not possibly be anywhere else other than this place unless they had really disappeared into thin air. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Warren took a few steps back and had the guards go in front. Then, he made a hand gesture before the guards rushed in.

As the guards rushed in, they saw a figure, who was very fast. In an instant, the guards who rushed in were shackled.

At the same time, he killed the guard at the front with one shot.

Suddenly, a gunshot rang out, and everyone quickly stood in front of Warren to protect him. The guards raised their weapons and aimed at the two people in the bathroom.

One of them was Edward, who had just killed the guards, and the other was William, who was behind Edward and was being blocked by Edward’s body.

The two of them were surrounded by the Sanders’ guards.

Warren pushed away the guards in front of him who were protecting him. He was a little excited.

When he confirmed that it was Edward and William, his face instantly lit up. He said fiercely, “Are you still going to run now?!”
