Chapter 752: Monica and Michael’s Conflict

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanna knew very well that the Sanders held no true feelings for her.

She had a guess as to the true reason Quinn Sanders joined Lawrence Enterprise. Kingsley Thorn had also analyzed the move previously. The reason why Jeanne reminded Quinn not to be conned by Joshua was because she did not want Quinn to cooperate with Joshua Lawrence or Eden Swan. If they colluded, it would make it even more troublesome to deal with them.

Of course, another reason was that she wanted to mislead the Sanders into thinking that though she rejected them, she was still loyal to the Sanders family.

A call suddenly rang in the car.

Jeanne glanced at it and answered. “Yes, Monica?”

“Jeannie, where are you?” Monica would usually only call her that when she needed help or if she was drunk.

When Jeanne heard her voice, she knew that Monica was drunk.

“I’m driving. Are you drinking?”

“Drink some wine...” Monica burped. “It’s boring to drink alone. Can you come and accompany me?”

“Where are you?”

“In... Hic... Charm.”

“Aright. Wait for me.”

Jeanne hung up and headed straight to the destination.

Since her break up, Monica has been quite depressed. From time to time, she would get drunk. After getting drunk, Jeanne would send her back every time. The next day, when the hangovers were unbearable, Monica would swear that she would never drink again. Yet in less than two days, she would be drunk again.

The cycle repeated itself.

Jeanne parked the car quickly when she arrived.

When she walked into the nightclub, Monica was already lying motionless on the bar counter.

“Monica,” Jeanne called out to her.

Monica opened her eyes in a daze. “Jeannie, you’re here. Joining me for a drink?”

“No, it’s time to go home. I’ll send you back.”

“I’m not going back... Ugh...”

Monica was already being dragged away by Jeanne. She was quite strong for her stature.

Monica tried to resist, but it was to no avail.

Jeanne shoved Monica into the limo and drove her back.

Monica sat in the front passenger seat and suddenly became very quiet. She looked pitiful, as if she had been abandoned.

“Don’t drink so much in the future,” Jeanne reminded her.

Monica said nothing.

“Every time you get drunk, you suffer. Why do you do this to yourself?”

“I miss Finn,” Monica said suddenly.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“I miss him, Jeannie.” Monica’s tears fell.

Jeanne felt sorry for her. She said, “Do you need me to call him for you?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Monica shook her head. “He doesn’t like me anymore.”

“Since you know that the break up was final, don’t think about it anymore.”

“But I can’t help it.” Monica’s tears flowed even more.

“Monica...”

“It’s nothing.” Monica was trying very hard to control her emotions. She wiped her tears and stared out the car window. She said, “I’ll live.”

Jeanne didn’t know how to comfort her.

“Time will heal everything. One day, I’ll forget Finn. One day, I will...” Monica said as tears streamed down her face.

After all that’s said, she still loved him very, very much.

That was why she felt so miserable after they separated for good.

Jeanne walked Monica home, helped her wash up and got her into bed before leaving.

When Jeanne returned home, it was already 10 pm. Though it didn’t matter if it was ten o’clock, twelve o’clock, or two o’clock in the morning.

There would be people waiting for her at home.

He sat on the sofa in the living room and was watching a variety show while waiting for Jeanne to return home.

“You’re back.” Edward smiled.

He never asked why she was home late.

Nor has he interfered with her work.

As long as she doesn’t speak of it, he wouldn’t take the initiative to ask her anything.

She changed into slippers and walked directly to Edward Swan.

Edward held her in his arms naturally.

“Have you had dinner?” Edward asked.

“I have.”

“Do you want supper?”

“No, I’m fine.”

“Then go back to your room and sleep.”

“Edward,” Jeanne called to him suddenly.

“Yes?”

“Will you stop liking me one day?” Jeanne asked.

Edward laughed. “Why do you suddenly ask?”

“Monica got drunk again today.”

Edward didn’t respond.

“She misses Finn so much that she can only numb herself with alcohol,” Jeanne said. “I didn’t know that a relationship could be so fickle. That you can just say you are no longer in love, and break up, like Finn.”
