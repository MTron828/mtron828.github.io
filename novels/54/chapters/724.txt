She had many identities, and that was why she worried.

Edward hugged her tightly as if he was afraid that she would really leave. Then, he opened his eyes and looked into hers.

It caught Jeanne off guard as she looked into his eyes.

Before she could conceal the emotions in her eyes, Edward saw them all, and she got nervous.

He said, “It feels like everything in front of me is like a dream and that all the good things in my life during this time are stolen.”

Jeanne did not know if Edward was saying it to please her or... if he meant what he said.

She said, “Isn’t it good… to live in the present?”

Would it not be good to live in the present? After all, who knew what would happen in the future?

Who knew if they would kill each other?

Besides, who would have known that Edward would kill Lucy?

The moment Kingsley told her that Edward was the one who killed Lucy, she knew that they were... irreconcilable enemies.

She lay silently in Edward’s chest.

As to her question, Edward did not reply her.

Between them, it seemed they would always deliberately ignore some problems that they did not want to face.

Anyway, they would see how it went.

After that, Jeanne closed her eyes and fell asleep. Although she slept last night, she did not sleep for long.

She had to admit that Edward was indeed very good in bed last night.

It was as if she would not give up until she got back all the things she had missed while they were separated from each other.

At that moment, she thought she would not be able to fall asleep. Besides, she was merely accompanying Edward to take a nap.

However, after closing her eyes and thinking of many things in a daze, she really did start to fall asleep again.

The moment she fell asleep, she seemed to hear Edward’s voice, saying into her ear, “Not dead.”

Not dead? Who was not dead? Or was she hallucinating that Edward was whispering in her ear?

By the time she woke up again, she was sure that it was already very late.

It was not noon but afternoon, and she was starving to death. It was like her entire stomach was empty.

She protested adamently, “I’m really starving to death.”

“Yes,” Edward replied but did not move after that.

What was the meaning of that?

However, Jeanne could not care anymore. In any case, she had to get up and eat.

With that, she lifted the blanket. As she fell to the ground the last time, she was very careful when she got down this time. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After making sure that her legs could support her weight, she left the bed and went straight to the bathroom to wash up.

She stood in front of the large mirror, naked.

When sleeping with Edward, her clothes were... redundant.

She looked at the redness on her face.

She thought her face would be pale because she was weak from starving. However, who was the woman in the mirror with a ruddy face and was even glowing?

She could not help but bite her lips lightly, but her slightly swollen lips were burning.

How wild was Fourth Master Swan last night?

Not only her lips, but her body had pink-colored marks all over.

One, two, three... Fifteen… That was not accounting for the parts of her body that she could not see.

Suddenly, the bathroom door opened, and Edward walked toward her,

Startled, Jeanne felt that she had no way to escape.

At that moment, she felt her body being hugged from behind, and a head then buried itself in her slender shoulders.

That move was very intimate.

“You’re heavy.” Jeanne resisted.

Edward was like a lump of iron, and she could not even move him no matter what. Moreover, all his weight was on her body, almost flattening her.

Fortunately, Edward only leaned on her body for a while before he casually picked up the bath towel in the bathroom and wrapped her up with it.

Jeanne looked at him.

“Although you have a great body, it’s better not to catch a cold.”

“...”

“The important thing is...” Edward suddenly bent down, leaned close to her ear, and said softly.

Jeanne looked at herself in the mirror. Her face, which was originally rosy, was now even redder. It was like her entire face was about to explode.

Damn it, Edward!

“Wash up.” After Edward said that, he instantly became serious. “Let’s eat together after you wash?up.”

Jeanne brushed her teeth fiercely with her teeth gnashed.
