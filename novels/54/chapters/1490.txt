Her little face was so serious that it was flushed red. She was trying really hard to poop.

“Mommy, it hurts…” Paige was still crying because of the pain in her stomach.

“Don’t cry.”

Paige’s big eyes were filled with grievance.

Candice, on the other hand, was not as cold-blooded as she appeared to be. When she saw how upset Paige was, her heart ached. However, if she did not take it seriously and got her poop on her own, Paige’s stomachache would persist.

Besides, Paige’s personality was different from George’s. Paige had been pampered and had probably never been hurt since she was young, so whenever something happened, she would rely on the people around her.

However, if that continued, it would not be good for Paige’s future growth. Paige needed to slowly understand that there were many things that others could not help her with and that she could only rely on herself.

As crying sounds came from the toilet, Chloe wanted to rush in a few times but was stopped by Teddy.

“Teddy, if anything happens to Paige, can you bear the responsibility?” Chloe shouted at Teddy.

“The Madam is inside. She will take good care of Paige.”

“She isn’t Paige’s biological mother, so she can’t decide what’s best for Paige.”

“In that case, Ms. Nicholson, you have even less right to decide for Paige!” Teddy said with a serious expression.

Chloe gritted her teeth. She was really pissed off by Teddy. She did not understand how a servant could be so arrogant in this household.

“I told you to get out of the way!” Chloe scolded.

“I won’t. ”

“I’ll say it again. Get out of my way!” Chloe threatened fiercely. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Still, Teddy did not move.

“Slan!” Chloe suddenlv slanned Teddv’s face hard.

It was deafening, and Teddy’s expression was a little ugly. However, he could not fight back.

Chloe had been holding her emotions in for a long time, angry at how Teddy was always against her. Hence, she had to take the opportunity to teach him a lesson.

“Are you going to give way or not?” Chloe threatened again.

“I won’t.” Teddy still did not move.

Chloe raised her hand and slapped Teddy’s face again. It was still as hard as the slap before.

“What are you doing?” At the same time, a stern male voice suddenly sounded in the hall.

Chloe was shocked, but in the next second, her eyes reddened.

She quickly ran to Edward’s side and said with an aggrieved expression,” Edward, Paige’s stomach hurts a lot, but for some reason, my sister refuses to send Paige to the hospital. I was very anxious to send Peggy to the hospital, but Teddy kept stopping me. So, I couldn’t help but slap him. Edward, what’s wrong with my sister?”

She made herself sound like the victim. However, Edward did not even look at Chloe as he walked straight to the bathroom.

Half of Teddy’s face was red.

Edward’s eyes turned cold. He asked, ‘What happened?”

“Paige was in class today when she suddenly had a stomachache. Madam just did a simple checkup on Paige and confirmed that she had eaten something bad today,” Teddy reported.

“My sister isn’t a doctor. How can she tell that Paige has a stomachache? What if it’s not?” Chloe stood at the side and deliberately added fuel to the fire.

“Paige should be fine.” Teddy ignored Chloe and continued to report to Edward,

“I can hear her crying inside, but I believe Madam knows her limits.”

Edward nodded and said, “I’ll go in and take a look.”

Teddy stepped aside.

Edward opened the door to the toilet and walked in to see that Paige’s face was red as she tried her best to poop. Candice was by Paige’s side, holding her chubby little hand as if she was helping Paige push.

When Paige saw her father suddenly appear, she burst into tears again.

“Daddy.”

Candice really wanted to throw a fit at that moment. It was not easy to calm Paige down and make her focus on pooping, but she did not expect someone to appear halfway through.

“Daddy, my stomach hurts.”

As Paige spoke, she wanted to get down from the toilet bowl and get Edward to pick her up. However, Candice held Paige down and said to Edward, “Get out first.”

“Paige-”

“Get out first!” Candice’s expression was serious.

“I’ll get Finn to come over,” Edward said.

“You don’t believe my judgment either, do you?” Candice asked Edward. “No, I just think that since Paige is in so much pain, we can help her to poop in other ways..”
