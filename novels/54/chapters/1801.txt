Shelly gripped her phone tightly, not knowing what to say. Was Nox not getting married? Why was he going back on his word and calling her name again?

She had no idea what to say to Jeanne.

“Let me tell you something else.” Jeanne said bluntly, “Do you know why Benjamin received an offer to study abroad out of the blue?”

Shelly was stunned. That thought had never crossed her mind before, but now that Jeanne said it, she was instantly hit by a realization.

“Yes, Nox did it. In order to get you, he wanted to kick Benjamin out of the country, so he used many despicable methods to do so. In fact, I was the one who talked to Benjamin and convinced him to go,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Shelly bit her lip, not knowing whether she should be angry or not! At that time, she really liked Benjamin. If Benjamin had not left Harken, they might still be together.

“Do you want to know how I convince him? I didn’t threaten him.” Jeanne made her stand clear. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jeanne said, “It was a letter from Nox to you that made Benjamin believe that Nox really loves you. You might not have seen that letter as I didn’t tell Nox to pass it to you. I thought you would’ve been annoyed by what he wrote to you because you didn’t like him. However, I think I should show it to you now.”

Shelly remained silent.

“Before I show you the letter, let me tell you something else. Did Benjamin tell you that his parents have agreed to your relationship?”

“Yes,” Shelly replied.

“It was Nox who convinced Benjamin’s parents.” Jeanne said, “He didn’t disappear for nine days just to prepare for the proposal. He also laid out all the backup plans for you, including convincing

Benjamin’s parents and matchmaking you and Benjamin. I don’t know how he did it, but he did.”

Shelly never thought that Nox would do all that for her. Her impression of him was that he was still the big bad guy who did all kinds of evil. However, he was now a little more mature and not as childish.

“I don’t know how to tell you how much Nox loves you. Right now, he’s going crazy from shouting your name, but he won’t come looking for you because he’s afraid of hurting you.” Jeanne left the conversation at that. “I’ll send you the electronic version of the letter. Then, you can think about whether you want to come and see Nox.”

With that, Jeanne hung up. As long as she had made everything clear to Shelly, she had done her duty.

It did not take long for Shelly to receive a document on her phone. She looked at the document and did not open it for a long time. She did not know what she was afraid of, but she was hesitant to open it.

After a while, she eventually opened it. As she read the words Nox had written, her eyes reddened. She did not know how Nox could love her so much yet not make her feel his love for her at all.

Shelly wiped her tears and chuckled sarcastically. She had no idea whether the laugh was directed at her or Nox. Then, she put her phone down, lay silently on the bed, and slept. She still could not seem to muster the courage to meet Nox.

While Nox was drunk in the nightclub, Jeanne, Edward, Monica, and Finn were watching him mutter from the side, “Shelly.”

However, he was motionless on the sofa.

Monica could not help but ask Jeanne, “Have you called?”

“I did.”

“What did Shelly say?”

“Nothing.”

“It’s been an hour.” Monica was getting a little impatient.

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

It meant that Shelly would not be coming.

“Does Shelly really have no feelings for Nox?” Monica was exasperated as she could not understand why Shellt was not moved by everything Nox had done for her.

Jeanne did not know how to answer her question either.

Monica continued, “Didn’t you say Shelly isn’t with Benjamin? Did you call Benjamin to confirm?” “Nope. Shelly rejected Benjamin.”

“Since she has rejected Benjamin, it means she doesn’t like Benjamin. In that case, why doesn’t she accept Nox?”

“Rejecting Benjamin doesn’t mean accepting Nox. What’s more, Shelly would rather be single. If she doesn’t want to be with Nox when she isn’t in a relationship, this is enough to show that she really doesn’t have any feelings for Nox.” Jeanne looked at Nox and said, “There’s no hope..”
