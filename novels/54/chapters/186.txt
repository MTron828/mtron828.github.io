Chapter 187: Kingsley’s Dominance

“I don’t know who Kingsley Thorn is either, but he’s right outside the Swans’ main gate. He said he wants to see Fourth Master.” Teddy was also a little confused.

“Shoo him away.” Nox had an impatient look on his face. “All kinds of scum want to see Fourth Master. Can he be seen so easily?”

“Young Master Winter.” A strange man’s voice suddenly appeared in the hall.

Nox, Finn, and Teddy all turned to look at the door.

A man walked in from the door.

He was wearing a black suit. His hair was slightly long and curly, but it was combed neatly.

He was tall and burly.

The man was over 185cm tall.

He had a strong aura.

Nox frowned.

He quickly stood up from the sofa.

It had been so many years.

No one had dared to trespass into Fourth Master Swan’s residence.

Finn also walked over.

He walked over and looked at the man in front of her.

The man did not look young, but he definitely was not old either. With just a glance, it was difficult to determine his exact age.

“Who are you?!” Nox clenched his fists tightly.

At the next second, he might impulsively start a fight with the other party.

“Kingsley Thorn,” Kingsley answered. At that moment, he even smiled. When he smiled, he did not look friendly. He said, “I’m the scum you were talking about.”

Nox pursed his lips.

After all, it was a little awkward to talk bad about someone else and be heard.

The most important thing was that the man did not look like a scum at all.

Nonetheless, who was he?!

Was there such a person in South Hampton City—no, in Harken?!

Nox glared fiercely at Kingsley. His anger would not be suppressed just like that. “Do you know where you’re trespassing?”

“I’m looking for Fourth Master Swan,” Kingsley said straightforwardly.

He did not feel guilty at all because of this.

“Fourth Master Swan isn’t going to see you!”

“To be precise, I’m looking for Jeanne,” Kingsley enunciated each word clearly.

Nox was stunned.

So, the man was someone who was related to Jeanne.

Jeanne’s strength and the training she had probably received might have come from this man.

Who was this person?!

Many questions appeared in Nox’s mind. While he was a little distracted, he saw that Kingsley was already walking upstairs very calmly.

“Wait!” Nox stepped forward.

He went forward and directly stopped Kingsley.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

He suddenly kicked fiercely on Nox’s stomach.

Nox did not expect it.

He was kicked to the ground by the man.

Nox held his stomach in pain.

Kingsley glanced at Nox and left again.

How could Nox be so easy to get rid of?!

He jumped up from the ground and fiercely punched Kingsley.

Kingsley also felt the threat behind him.

He suddenly turned around and received Nox’s attack with a punch.

With that, the two of them started to fight crazily.

The entire hall was filled with the sounds of fierce fighting.

Nox’s punches and kicks were fatal attacks.

The other party was not willing to be outdone and exchanged blows with him.

Teddy, who was watching from the side, was dumbfounded.

He did not know any martial arts, but he knew that his master and Nox’s martial arts skills were amazing.

Despite that, the strange man’s combat power seemed to be above Nox’s. Even though Nox kept taking the initiative to attack, in the end, he did not hurt the other party.

Of course, the other party did not beat Nox down easily either. The two of them were in a fierce battle.

Finn, who was on the side, was also in a daze.

Nox might not be the greatest fighter in the world, but a world-class killer might not even be as good as him.

That said, at this moment, Nox did not have the upper hand in the battle with Kingsley.

In fact, as they were in a stalemate, his endurance began to decline.

Nox gritted his teeth.

He launched another attack crazily, wanting to quickly defeat the man completely.

It was worth noting that other than Fourth Master Swan, he had never met an opponent when it came to beating people up.

Nox and Kingsley continued to fight intensely.

Teddy was quite curious from watching. Why did it feel like a cruel fight at this moment?!

He was wondering if one of them would die here.

The fight lasted for a long time.

Nox was careless.

Or to put it another way, he could not resist Kingsley’s attack. He was kicked fiercely by Kingsley and was pressed to the ground. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Nox gritted his teeth and squatted on the ground, unable to move.

His veins could be seen. They looked exceptionally hideous as he was at his limit.

“Stop resisting!” Kingsley said straightforwardly. “Although your martial strength is very powerful, you can’t beat me.”

How could Nox listen to such words? It provoked him to burst out again. He broke free from Kingsley’s shackles, and the two of them started fighting again.

Even Finn felt that Nox was a little desperate.

He suddenly went forward and grabbed Nox, instantly blocking in front of Kingsley.

Kingsley quickly stopped kicking.

At that moment, Finn had to admit that this man was very powerful.

Under normal circumstances, once a person made his move, it would be difficult for him to withdraw.

On the other hand, the man controlled his kick freely.

It could only mean that he did not use his full strength at all.

If he had used his full strength, he would not have been able to do it so easily.

Nox was dragged behind by Finn fiercely. His face was full of anger. “Let go of me!”

“Nox!” Finn said, “Calm down. I believe that Mr. Thorn has no ill intentions.”

“No,” Kingsley said straightforwardly, “I’m just here to take Jeanne away.”

“And he says he has no ill intentions! He’s going to take Fourth Master Swan’s wife away!” Nox’s eyes were bloodshot, and he looked very agitated.

“Mr. Thorn must be someone of Jeanne’s, that’s why he wants to take her away.”

“Indeed. Dr. Jones, you’re much more rational than Young Master Winter. No wonder Fourth Master Swan trusts you so much. It’s really not just because of your excellent medical skills.”

“Mr. Thorn, you flatter me.” Finn did not say anything more. “Jeanne is in the innermost room on the second floor.”

“Thank you.” Kingsley nodded slightly.

He turned around and went up directly.

“Finn, how could you let him go up?!” Nox was irritable.

After being beaten up like this, he was in a bad mood.

Moreover, his entire body was in pain.

“You can’t beat him.” Finn let go of Nox.

“I, I, I…!” Nox was infuriated. He could not finish his sentence.

“There’s always someone better than you. It’s best not to act rashly before you know his background.”

“F*ck,” Nox blurted out.

Even so, he did not go after Kingsley.

He probably understood what Finn was saying but just felt a little unhappy.

After all, he did not defeat Kingsley before.

“By the way, Finn!” Nox suddenly gnashed his teeth.

Finn’s eyebrows twitched.

“Were you f*cking watching a show just now?” Nox roared, “You just watched me lose to him and you didn’t even help me! Why are you pretending to be gentle?!”

Finn pursed his lips and said, “After all, I’m a doctor. If I’m beaten up, how can I treat you?”

“...” Nox looked straight at him.

Finn smiled. “Let’s go. I’ll examine your injuries.”

He said it very amiably.

“Finn!” Nox roared, “I finally know why Monica called you a scum. You’re so f*cking sinister!”

“...”

Finn just did not want to suffer unnecessary harm.

Moreover, he could see Kingsley’s every move clearly from the side!

…

On the second floor.

In the room.

Jeanne was sleeping soundly.

Edward was also sleeping soundly.

The two of them hugged each other tightly.

Until...

The door was pushed open.

It was just a slight movement.

The two of them opened their eyes abruptly.

Jeanne turned her head and sat up from the bed.

Edward was injured and was on an IV drip, so he did not move. Even so, he was looking at the door.

At the door…

Jeanne was completely stunned.

She looked straight at Kingsley.

She saw Kingsley appear in front of her just like that.

Her eyes were not blurred.

It was Kingsley, who she thought would be the first to appear in front of her after her accident. He had been late all this while.

What expression did he have at this moment?

“I told you to stay away from Fourth Master Swan, but you gave me such a big surprise!” Kingsley enunciated each word, the anger in his voice could not be concealed.

Jeanne was speechless.

She was obedient at first.

However…

Her eyes moved slightly as she looked at Edward, who was lying down, suddenly sitting up.

She wanted to say something but did not say anything in the end.

Edward sat up and looked straight at Kingsley.

Kingsley also looked at him at this moment.

Their eyes met.

Jeanne could feel their hostility toward each other.

Kingsley asked Fourth Master Swan, “How did you trick Jeanne into bed?”

Jeanne felt very awkward.

She stood up and was about to leave.

Fourth Master Swan grabbed her at this time.

Jeanne’s body tightened.

Kingsley’s eyes moved, and he looked cold!
