Chapter 421: Finn Is Out of the Intensive Care Unit, and Monica Takes the Initiative

“Yes.” Nox nodded.

“On second thought, everything the other party did to me seemed to be testing my identity.”

Nox frowned.

“The way they see it, if I was the person they were looking for, I should be putting my life first instead of choosing to protect others first. So, they used Monica to threaten me!” Finn said.

After thinking it through, they would be able to determine the cause of that incident.

Nox’s expression was cold. “They really can come up with any dirty tricks.”

“After confirming that it’s not me, the other party will definitely make a move to confirm the next one.”

“They’ve been hiding for decades. Do they think they can find out just like that?” Nox sneered.

“It’s very difficult, but we can’t let our guard down.” Finn reminded, “After all, this person really exists, so there will always be some clues. I suspect even if they won’t fight head-on, they will have many other ways to make it impossible for us to guard against them.”

Nox was silent for a few seconds.

Finn looked at him and asked, “What are you thinking about?”

However, with just a glance, he could see through Finn’s thoughts.

In fact, the three of them could tell with just a glance what each other was thinking or doing.

......

“Jeanne.” Nox did not hide it.

Finn pursed her lips.

“Jeanne’s return isn’t as simple as it looks,” Nox said. “I’m really worried that she’s from the Sanders.”

Finn was also worried, and probably Edward was too.

“In fact, if you can think of it, Fourth Master can too. Since he has put Jeanne by his side, he has confidence. He won’t do anything that he’s not confident of.”

“That’s because you don’t know how much Fourth Master Swan likes Jeanne.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Anyone with eyes can see it,” Finn said bluntly.

“I’m not afraid Fourth Master Swan will be blinded by lust, nor am I worried that Jeanne can touch us. The only thing I’m worried about is...” Nox looked at Finn and said, “What I’m worried about is that one day, Fourth Master Swan won’t be able to deal a heavy blow to Jeanne, and Jeanne, that woman, will kill Fourth Master Swan with a single shot!”

“Their feelings are mutual,” Finn consoled Nox.

“I hope so.” Nox did not want to worry too much.

After all, he had never been such an indecisive person!

However, since Fourth Master Swan had chosen to be with Jeanne, he definitely had his reasons.

Be it conspiracy or love, Fourth Master Swan had never done anything he was unsure of.

Who knew if he might really change Jeanne one day?

Moreover, whether Jeanne was part of the Sanders or not was still unknown, so he could not just kill Jeanne like that.

In any case, Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan were a true match — a match made in heaven. What a pity it would be for them to separate.

Nox stayed with Finn in the ward for quite a while before leaving.

After leaving, he came across a woman who was limping and seemingly in a hurry. She then bumped into him.

Monica frowned as she looked up at Nox.

Nox deliberately smiled. “Are you so eager for a hug?”

“Can you not disgust me?” Monica looked disgusted.

“Seeing that you’re still in good spirits, I’m sure you’re fine.” Nox looked Monica up and down.

Monica ignored Nox. At that moment, she only wanted to go in and see Finn.

.

Just now, she had her nurse ask about Finn’s condition. In fact, she would do that many times every day. However, after the nurse went there, she ran back excitedly to tell her that Dr. Jones was out of the intensive care unit.

At that moment, she was so excited that she almost jumped out of bed. She hurriedly asked the nurse to find her a walking stick and was about to go to Finn’s ward. When she went out, she thought she looked a little ugly, so she went back to the ward to make herself look presentable. Without any makeup, she could only wash her face and comb her hair until she could not suppress her excitement anymore and come out.

As soon as she came out, she bumped into Nox.

She was not happy at all!

Clearly, she should be the first person to see Finn when he was out of the intensive care unit, and she could not believe that Nox, that fellow, beat her to it.

“Do I have something on my face? Why are you looking at me like that?” Nox frowned.

That girl, Monica, was acting weird.

Monica, too, felt that Nox was acting weird, so she pushed Nox away. “Don’t stand in my way.”

However, Nox did not move.

Monica frowned. “Why are still you standing here?”
