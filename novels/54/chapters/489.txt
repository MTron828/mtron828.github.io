At that moment, Jasmine felt completely defeated.

Other than “no”, it seemed she could not find any other words to say. However, that word was nothing but an excuse, and it was meaningless.

“To think I’ve been standing on your side today, thinking you would never frame Jeanne. I’ve been blind for so many years!” Alexander roared at Jasmine.

Jasmine looked at Alexander with tears in her eyes. She did not know what to do after Jeanne exposed her.

Hence, she turned her head to look at Jenifer.

Jenifer, however, did not even look at Jasmine and was avoiding Jasmine’s gaze, for she was afraid she would be implicated if she did.

Suddenly, Jasmine laughed sarcastically.

Just now, the pitiful-looking woman with tears in her eyes suddenly burst out laughing. When she laughed, she looked like a crazy and evil woman.

“Ha! Ha! Ha...”

Everyone looked at Jasmine coldly, watching her suddenly go crazy.

She stood up from the coffee table. Her previous weakness was gone. She stood up and said, “How did I become like this? Isn’t it because you guys made me?”

Alexander’s face darkened. “Jasmine!”

“I’m the daughter of a mistress. If I don’t fight for myself, how can I find a place in the upper-class society?” Jasmine said fiercely.

......

At that moment, she had torn off all of her pretenses.

“Jasmine!” Alexander called out to Jasmine. He was furious at what she said.

“Isn’t that right? In upper-class society, I’m considered the daughter of a mistress. How can I stand out? If I want to live a good life, what else can I do but resort to underhanded means?” Jasmine suddenly shouted angrily. It was as if she was venting out everything she had kept to herself all these years.

“H-How can you think like that?” Alexander was so angry that his body was trembling.

“It’s also because of you! My mother taught me this ever since I was young. She told me that I had to snatch skillfully–”

“Jasmine, that’s enough!” Jenifer suddenly gave Jasmine a hard slap on the face.

Jasmine had completely lost her mind, and Jenifer’s face had turned pale from what Jasmine said.

Jasmine looked at Jenifer in a daze.

When she saw Jenifer’s frightened look, she smiled again and said, “Mom, are you afraid of being implicated?”

“What nonsense are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? Y-You! I’m going to take you back and have you reflect on the mistakes you’ve made!” Jenifer quickly said. She was really afraid of Jasmine, who could not care less about anything right now.

She immediately pulled Jasmine up and was going to take her away.

“Mother.” Jeanne called out and did not forget to remind her, “I’m afraid you don’t have the right to take Jasmine away here.”

Jenifer’s body tensed up.

Then, she gritted her teeth and said, “Jasmine is my daughter, and it’s my fault she has done such a disgraceful thing. If I take Jasmine away now, I’ll definitely give the Swans an explanation...”

“Who do you think you are? You’re a lowly mistress. How dare you think you can give us an explanation? Put Jasmine down!” Belle scolded. She did not care about Jenifer at all.

Jenifer suppressed her anger and endured how Belle talked to her. Now that she was threatened, she did not dare to take Jasmine away.

Jenifer did not expect that her daughter, whom she had taught, would let her down one day.

Hence, she just endured all the humiliation she had suffered today.

Jeanne looked at Jenifer and really admired her endurance. Then, she looked at Jasmine and said, “Now, you can tell everyone how you lost your child yesterday?”

“It was you!” Jasmine still insisted it was Jeanne, refusing to admit it no matter what. “You killed the child. It was you!”

“Are you sure you want to be so stubborn?” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. That cold and sinister gaze could make one’s hair stand on end.

Jasmine tried his best to straighten her back so that Jeanne would not frighten her. She said fiercely, “Because you want to take revenge on Eden and me. You just can’t stand to see me having a good life!”

“If I wanted to take revenge on you and Eden, I could’ve exposed you when you and Eden got married. Do you think you would’ve been able to marry into the family and take the position of Young Lady Swan?” Jeanne mocked, “Jasmine, only you think Eden is good, and only you like Eden... So, don’t ruin my relationship with Edward.”
