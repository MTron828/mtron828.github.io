1186 In The Nick of Time, Jeanne and Edward Meet

No, it was Alex Duncan.

The man, who clearly should not be there, had suddenly appeared.

Jeanne looked at him warily and watched as he approached them, step by step, without a care in the world

“Are you curious how I found you so quickly?” Alex snickered.

Jeanne gripped her phone tightly.

“I knew Edward would definitely let you off and might even help you escape. That was why I placed a tracking device on your most trusted assassin, Mason!” Alex looked at Jeanne coldly. “As expected, you almost left!”

Jeanne gritted her teeth and turned to look at Mason.

At that moment, Mason had already started to search for the tracking device on his body.

“Behind you.” Alex said, “I let you go on purpose because I knew you would meet up with Jeanne. So, when you weren’t paying attention, I had someone stick something on your back. It turns out that in a life and death situation, even an assassin can be careless.”

Mason frantically felt his back until he touched a small tracking device. At that moment, he held it in his hand and wished he could crush it!

Mason was furious! It was an emotion that he rarely had as an assassin, but at that moment, anger was written all over his face.

Alex’s face was cold, but he did not become arrogant because his scheme had succeeded. Although he talked as if he had won, he was just stating facts.

It was as if what was done was done, and everything he said was just an explanation.

There was no emotion on that man’s face at all. He was like a living dead, doing things numbly!

He said, “Jeanne, as long as you’re not a member of the Sanders, I won’t kill you for Edward’s sake. And no matter what you do to me, I might still let you go. However, it’s a pity that you’re a member of the Sanders, who is the last person I can allow to exist in my world. So, you must die!”

“If I tell you that I’m not Warren’s daughter, will you let me go?” Jeanne asked him seriously.

Alex seemed stunned for a second. Then, he asked, “In that case, whose daughter are you?”

“Joseph Sanders, Warren’s younger brother. Warren and I also have an irreconcilable enmity!”

“Who can prove it?” Alex asked.

“Nox,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Nox knew, but it was obvious that Alex would not believe it.

He said, “If Nox can do anything for Edward, he can betray me.”

Therefore, Nox could not be her witness.

Jeanne gritted her teeth. “You can test my and Warren’s DNA!”

“Warren’s corpse has been burned. I’ve even fed his ashes to the dogs.”

Jeanne did not expect the man to act so quickly.

She said, “In the Sanders’ residence, where Warren stayed, his DNA will definitely be left behind. For example, his hair, his saliva–”

“I’ve also burned the Sanders’ residence,” Alex interrupted her.

Jeanne looked at him in disbelief. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“In order to destroy evidence of all my crimes, I set the Sanders’ residence on fire. Tomorrow, you’ll see the news that everyone in the Sanders, including you, was killed in the fire.”

It meant that it did not matter whether she was Warren’s daughter or not. As long as the public believed that she was, she was a member of the Sanders.

Even if Alex believed that she was not Warren’s daughter, she would still die as Warren’s daughter.

She had no conditions to negotiate with.

“Is there anything you want me to tell Edward?” Alex asked.

After seeing that she had understood, he asked her for her last words.

Jeanne bit her lip and chose to remain silent.

“If you don’t have one, rest in peace!” Alex did not have much patience.

He immediately gave the order.

The moment his men fired at Jeanne, Mason stood in front of her, and countless bullets hit his body.

Just like that, he protected her under his body, blocking all of Jeanne’s bullets.

“Mason.” Jeanne was shocked.

Even though Mason had been shot several times, he still stood tall in front of her.

He said, “I’ve let Mr. Thorn down and failed to protect you.”

“Mason–”

“I’m sorry–”

Mason collapsed to the ground.

He could not become a target for Jeanne, nor could he take the bullets for her anymore.

Jeanne’s eyes turned red, and she just looked at Mason. Yet another important person had fallen.

She suddenly thought, what was the point of living when she had to watch the people around him die one by one because of her?

As she looked at Mason’s corpse, she suddenly realized that she seemed to have caused the death of many people.

There were Kingsley, Lucy, Mason, and Nox, whose fate was unknown… as well as Monica.

If she had not forced the Duncans and the Sanders to go to war and forced the Sanders to kill Finn, Monica would not be in the intensive care unit, unconscious.

It hit her that if she continued to live like that, more people might die for her, and the first one might be Edward.

Suddenly, she felt tired.

...

She stood up from the ground and looked at Alex, who looked at her in the same way.

He asked, “Are you done remembering him?”

She had just been given some time to remember Mason.

If she was done paying her last respects to him, it was time for her to go.

“Tell Edward that I have never loved him.”

She did not deserve to love anyone.

“I’ll definitely pass on these words,” Alex promised her.

Then, his fingers moved slightly.

Jeanne faced the countless guns in front of her.

“If you kill her, I’ll bury all of the Duncans with her. Do you believe me?!”

Behind Alex, a man’s voice suddenly sounded.

...

In fact, it was a familiar man’s voice.

They had parted at the Sanders’ residence last night, and right now, as dawn had started to break, Jeanne and Edward met.
