Chapter 310: Edward Agrees to Get Married

“Is that so?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

A marriage of convenience?!

“In that case, what if you want to back out of the marriage, Miss Lawrence?” Edward asked.

If she backed out, he would still have to let her go, right?

Jeanne bit her lips and said, “I won’t back out.”

Something in Edward’s eyes shifted.

“You’ll have the final say in this marriage, Fourth Master. If you want to get married or get a divorce, I’ll follow whatever you say.” Jeanne smiled and looked so obedient.

Edward’s tall body suddenly moved closer to Jeanne.

Then, he lowered his head and stared at Jeanne.

The two of them were very close to each other, so close that Jeanne could almost feel Fourth Master Swan’s breathing. His breath on her face was so hot that it felt like an attack.

She subconsciously gritted her teeth and did not dodge or even look away for a second.

She looked very sincere.

Fourth Master Swan lifted her chin, closing the distance between them even more.

......

“When did you become so obedient?” Edward asked her with a pause between each word.

She still could not deceive Fourth Master Swan.

Kingsley’s order to have her marry Fourth Master Swan was not easy at all.

Fourth Master Swan liked her, but the man’s rationality was terrifying. He would not abandon his principles for her sake.

She said, “In that case, I’m sorry to have bothered you, Fourth Master.”

Jeanne pulled herself away from him, and her chin left his slender fingers.

Fourth Master Swan’s eyes moved slightly, but he did not stop her.

With that, Jeanne turned around.

She thought maybe she was too aggressive.

After all, she had just plotted against him, and now she said she wanted to get married to him? Who in the world would be so foolish?

However, as soon as she left…

“Okay.”

Jeanne’s body tensed up as Fourth Master Swan’s voice sounded behind her.

As if in a daze, wondering if she had heard wrongly, she turned her head to look at Fourth Master Swan.

It was impossible to tell his emotions because his face was emotionless.

Therefore, at that moment, she asked with some uncertainty, “Did you agree to our marriage?”

“When do you want to get married?” He did not answer her directly and was already planning the next step.

Jeanne unconsciously bit her lip.

She had to admit that at that moment, her heart was… beating wildly.

Never did she think that Fourth Master Swan would be so forthcoming.

She did not know why he would agree, but she told herself that assassins had no feelings.

The last thing they should have were feelings holding them back

In fact, Kingsley had many assassins under him. Some of them really relied on seduction to complete one difficult mission after another, and after completing it, they would turn around and leave with no feelings attached. No matter what happened to the man who loved her with all his heart, the assassin would just treat him coldly.

She, too, would become a person like that.

She said, “You have the final say, Fourth Master.”

“What kind of wedding do you want?”

“You have the final say.”

“Okay.” Edward did not ask further.

He knew very well that she would not have any expectations for the marriage because she had no feelings for him.

Hence, he said, “Rest well, Miss Lawrence. I will inform you when the date is set.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded obediently.

The next second, Fourth Master Swan closed the door.

The way the two of them talked about marriage was like they were discussing business.

It was fine as long as they finished talking. There was no need to put too many feelings into it.

However, Jeanne still stood at Fourth Master Swan’s door for a very, very long time.

Only after a while did she turn around and leave to the room next door to get George.

Then, she brought George downstairs.

With the marriage confirmed, she did not want to stay here. Since she had to stay, she would have to go back to the Lawrences.

There was still a pile of trash in the Lawrences that needed her to deal with!

She had just gone downstairs when she saw Nox walking over imposingly.

He asked fiercely, “You’re leaving again?”

Jeanne did not answer.

“You didn’t manage to seduce him?” Nox mocked.

Jeanne did not want to answer that question either.

“Jeanne, do you really think our family’s Fourth Master Swan is so easy to seduce? Why would he allow you to play him again after you played him once? You’ve underestimated him!” Nox said proudly.

At that, Jeanne smiled.

Nox continued, “From now on, stay away from Fourth Master Swan. To tell you the truth, I already have plans to introduce a girlfriend to him, and I have a lot of resources on hand. If he doesn’t like this one, he can try the next one. If he doesn’t like the next one, he can try another. If he doesn’t like that one, he can move on. Anyway, I’ve made arrangements for his sex life…”

Nox went on and on.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
