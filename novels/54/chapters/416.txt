Chapter 417: Fourth Master Swan Is Jealous

“Yes.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“We’ll be working overtime again today!” Jeanne said.

“We’ll be ready at any time.” Mandy expressed her stance.

Jeanne smiled. “In that case, let’s split up the workload. Hans, you continue to connect with MUK Group and pass on our current thoughts to them. Let them know that we’re already working on this matter and let them continue with their online operations. We shouldn’t neglect this pilot project because of this incident. For users who want to return their orders, returning their orders unconditionally is more important than our word...”

The meeting was a little long.

After Jeanne had assigned all the work, she returned to the office, where she had Amy make her a cup of black coffee.

She sat in her seat and did not get into work immediately.

She was thinking about the matter. Who was the one behind it?

Alexander probably would not do that. No matter what, he still wanted Lawrence Enterprise to do well, so he would not do something that would harm Lawrence Enterprise’s interests. However, Joshua might not.

Joshua had not taken over Lawrence Enterprise yet, so he was not at the stage where he would think about the overall situation. Therefore, he would do things for his own selfish desires, which were naturally to drive her away because she was a threat to him.

If so, the person who would help Joshua to do that was only Eden.

In fact, she did not even need to think to guess it was Eden.

The only one who did not care about Lawrence Enterprise’s interest and did not want her to have a good time was him!

......

That year, she was indeed blind.

Her eyes moved a little before she focused on her work. Once she was immersed in her work, time passed very quickly.

When Jeanne received the call, the sky was already dark.

She looked at Edward’s call, and only then did she remember that she was married.

For those who were married, they should inform their partner if they could not make it back for dinner.

Hence, she quickly picked up the call. “Edward.”

“Jeannie, are you still at work?”

“I have to deal with some difficult issue and might be working overtime tonight.”

“Alright.”

“You don’t have to wait for me for dinner.”

“Alright.”

“Goodbye.”

“Goodbye.”

After hanging up the call, Jeanne went back to work without thinking too much about it.

In the luxurious black car downstairs Lawrence Enterprise, a certain man quietly put down the phone as well.

The driver did not dare to speak and just obediently waited for instructions.

Much later in the night, Jeanne did a stretch. She was really a little tired, but she was done with the work she had set for herself the day.

With that, she got up, picked up her bag, and left her office.

Everyone on the project team was still working overtime, so Jeanne left without saying much.

However, when she left, she sent a message to Amy telling her to buy everyone extra food and snacks.

Sometimes, she could not be too merciful when it came to work.

She went downstairs, and just as she walked out of the Lawrence Enterprise, her footsteps halted.

She did not expect Edward to wait for her downstairs.

Seemingly having noticed her, Edward opened the car door, got out of the car, and stood in front of her.

Jeanne quickened her pace a little as if she did not want him to wait for her for too long.

“Didn’t I tell you not to wait for me?” Jeanne frowned.

“I just wanted to let you see my new hairstyle,” Edward said bluntly.

Jeanne was speechless. In fact, she had noticed it when she saw him just now.

It was, indeed, cut a little shorter.

No, it was better.

Previously, if his hair was not styled, it would be a little long, almost touching his brows. Yet now, the hair fell at the top of the forehead, so it made him look much younger.

In the past, she always thought Fourth Master Swan looked very old.

Being called Fourth Master already gave the impression that he was older. Coupled with his mature dressing, it made people think he was 30 or 40 years old.

Now, he looked a little younger than his actual age. Moreover, he was very handsome and pure, unlike in the past, when he came across as intimidating.

“Do you like it?” Edward asked.

“I quite like it.” Jeanne touched it with her hand.

Edward’s hair was unusually soft.

“It’s good that you like it.” Edward reached out and held her little hand.

The palms of their hands were filled with each other’s warmth, one that made Jeanne’s heart tremble.

She pursed her lips lightly.

Edward cut his hair to win her favor, yet she wanted him to cut his hair because she had her motives.

While the two of them were in the car, Edward kept holding onto her hand. It was a very intimate gesture.

By the time the car arrived at Bamboo Garden, it was already 10 p.m. at night, and Nox’s voice came from the hall of Bamboo Garden.

In the hall, Nox was sitting next to George.
