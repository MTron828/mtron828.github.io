Chapter 464: Jasmine Inciting Trouble and Seeking Her Own Destruction

Jeanne took the razor from Old Master Swan’s hand and looked at Old Master Swan’s chin seriously. She said, “The shop owner said you don’t even need to use shaving cream to get a clean shave.”

Old Master Swan nodded.

“Does it hurt, dad?” Jeanne’s movements were very gentle.

“No, it doesn’t.”

In front of everyone, Jeanne shaved Old Master Swan’s stubble until it was clean.

Wade, who had been standing beside Old Master Swan the entire time, said openly, “She does a better job than me.”

Old Master Swan touched his clean chin and nodded. “Mm, not bad.”

“I’m glad you like it, dad.” Jeanne smiled faintly.

“Wade, put it away for me,” Old Master Swan instructed.

“Yes, Old Master.” Wade quickly agreed.

At that moment, Jeanne had already started to pack up the razor. Once she had cleaned up the stubble inside, she handed it to Wade, who expressed his gratitude with a smile.

After that, Jeanne returned to Edward’s side, where Edward very naturally hugged Jeanne in his arms as if he was very satisfied with her performance today.

The smile on the corner of Jeanne’s mouth was a little stiff.

......

What she wanted was only Old Master Swan’s beard.

Just like the hair, the beard could also be used for a paternity test.

When she was cleaning up the stubble, she had silently put away what she needed.

Her eyes moved.

Just like that, she made herself look as if nothing had happened.

“Let’s eat,” Old Master Swan ordered.

“Grandfather.” Eden suddenly stepped forward.

Old Master Swan glanced at Eden, and his expression shifted a little.

Eden could also feel it.

At the same time, Henry’s expression was grim. How dare Eden deliberately try to show off and not behave himself at a time like this? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Old Master Swan did not even pursue the matter of what he did in the company, yet he took the initiative to throw himself to the wolves!

He was about to call out to his son when Eden opened his mouth and said, “Grandfather, I have something to report to you.”

“If there’s anything, we’ll talk after the meal.” Old Master Swan did not care if he made Eden look bad.

Eden looked a little embarrassed.

His grandfather treated Jeanne, a person with another family name, much more dearly than he did, so he naturally felt very uncomfortable.

However, he did not dare to say much at that moment, and just like that, he swallowed whatever he wanted to say.

Everyone in the Swans sat around a large dining table.

The entire family ate very quietly.

Occasionally, Elaine would act like a spoiled child and say a few words to Old Master Swan, while the others were mostly quiet.

However, during the meal, they still proposed a few toasts, one from each family.

As the eldest, Henry was naturally the first to stand up.

Then, his whole family stood up and looked at Old Master Swan with great respect. “Father, I wish you a good, long, and happy life!”

Old Master Swan nodded in response.

Henry’s family, who was standing, was about to drink.

“Jasmine.” Eden suddenly called out to her in a low voice. “I’ll drink it for you.”

As he said that, he took Jasmine’s wine cup over.

Jasmine was a little embarrassed.

On the other hand, Henry did not look too happy. “It’s just a glass of wine. This is for your grandfather. What are you drinking on behalf of her? Be a little more polite!”

“It’s not that I don’t respect grandfather, but Jasmine is pregnant.” Eden did not get to announce it just now, but he said it now naturally.

As soon as he said it out loud, everyone was stunned for a second. Henry was a little slow to react.

However, Henry’s wife, Belle, started to get excited. She turned her head to Eden and said, “Did you say Jasmine’s pregnant? With the Swans’ child?”

“Yes.” Eden nodded.

“When and how long have you known? How’s the child?” Belle quickly asked.

“It’s pretty good. She went to the hospital for a check-up today. The doctor said it’s been two months and the baby is developing very well,” Eden replied.

“Thank god.” Belle looked very excited.

At that moment, Henry also looked a little happier. “Okay, okay. In that case, this wine...”

Henry turned his head to look at Old Master Swan.

Old Master Swan did not have much emotion. At that moment, he still said, “The child’s health is more important.”

“Thank you, grandfather,” Eden quickly replied and then drank the glass of wine for Jasmine.

Jasmine looked at Eden shyly.

Following Henry and his family’s toast to Old Master Swan, the others too did it one by one.

After that, the dining table became much quieter.

Jeanne was, in fact, a little absent-minded tonight.

“What’s wrong?” Edward asked her.

He seemed to be able to notice even the slightest change in her.

However, Jeanne covered it up. “It’s nothing. It’s just that eating at your dad’s place is a little intimidating.”
