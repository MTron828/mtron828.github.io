1326 Asking for Hand in Marriage

All of a sudden, the entire Nicholsons’ residence was in a frenzy because of Edward’s sudden announcement of visiting for dinner.

Chloe looked at the excitement in the house. Just like that, her mother was excited, and so was her father.

She felt really upset. Originally, she was happy that the Chief was able to come to her house. However, she could not accept the fact that he was here for Candice.

When she thought about how these honors should have belonged to her and how Candice had snatched away the position of Chief’s wife, she could not take it anymore.

She returned to her room angrily and dressed up.

Actually… Candice was not as good-looking as her.

In the past, Candice had been living in the army all year round. She had been exposed to the harsh environment and her skin was tanned and rough. Every time she returned from the army, she would compare herself with Candice. Although the adults would praise Candice, their appearances were worlds apart. Every time Chloe appeared in front of everyone, she would look like a delicate little princess, while Candice would always look like a tomboy.

Even though the two of them looked similar, their appearances were completely different.

At most, Candice would be described as a heroic and valiant woman who was not inferior to men.

However, Chloe was often praised for being beautiful and cute. She knew very well that men would definitely choose a wife like her. Who would be willing to marry a tomboy?

But then again, Candice had changed a lot after her return.

She had been sleeping on the hospital bed all year round and had not experienced the harsh outside world. Her skin had recovered tremendously, and even her pores were so small that Chloe was jealous. Moreover, it seemed that not only her skin, but even her figure had looked better. Candice was obviously a flat-chested woman in the past, but now she had become very well-endowed. Not only her figure, but she also felt that she had grown taller.

Back then, Candice was clearly about the same height as Chloe. At most, she was one centimeter taller. This time, Candice was clearly more than three centimeters taller than her.

Could it be that she could still grow taller at the age of twenty?!

That made no sense to her.

After all, it was a medical miracle that she could wake up after sleeping for so many years. She had no time to care about this. She only needed to know that even though Candice’s body had changed a lot, she was still not as good-looking as her.

Candice’s facial features were not as exquisite as hers. Candice did not look as sweet as her, who had been pampered since she was young.

Men would definitely not like Candice’s slightly rugged style whereas they would definitely prefer a soft and adorable appearance like hers.

She looked at herself in the mirror. She was all dolled up in a pink dress, had soft long hair, and wore a sweet smile. She would be irresistible to men.

Tonight, she had to think of a way to seduce Edward. It was just a political marriage anyway, so it did not matter who married Edward.

Since her father was biased toward Candice, she would fight for it herself. She must give her father a wake-up call right in the face!

Thinking of this, Chloe felt excited. She really wished that she could see Edward immediately and charm him right away!

…

Right on the dot at six o’clock in the evening, Edward brought his bodyguards and appeared at the Nicholsons’ residence.

Everyone in the family, with Wyatt taking the lead, went to the entrance to welcome him. They looked extremely respectful.

Edward seemed to be used to such treatment. He only exchanged a few words and did not feel any discomfort.

The group walked into the hall. A sumptuous dinner was prepared in the dining room beside the hall.

Wyatt and Claire quickly greeted him warmly and let Edward take the main seat.

After Edward sat down, Wyatt sat beside him. Candice naturally sat on his other side.

Claire sat beside Wyatt while Chloe chose to sit beside Candice.

Candice glanced at the smiling Chloe and saw that she was dressed a little too exquisitely tonight. She paid no mind to it.

After everyone sat down, Wyatt said, “Chief, don’t stand on ceremony. We’ll be family soon. Eat as much as you want.”

“Just call me Edward in private,” Edward said bluntly.

“Oh, yes, sure thing, we’re family now. It’s indeed too courteous for me to call you Chief.” Wyatt hurriedly smiled and added, “Edward, eat whatever you want.”

“Okay.” Edward nodded politely.

He picked up his fork and knife first before the others followed suit.

“Edward, let me help you with a piece of braised beef.” Chloe suddenly stood up and placed a piece of meat on Edward’s plate.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
