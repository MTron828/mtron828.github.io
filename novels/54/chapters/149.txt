Chapter 150: Monica, Finn, and Micheal’s Past

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

With Finn’s status, he was not worthy of the wealthy Monica. Therefore, once he felt that Monica did not love him, he would turn around and leave.

This was the influence that a foster family brought to the child.

From then on, Finn withdrew from Monica’s world.

Even during the period when Micheal pursued Monica, during the period when Monica still clearly loved Finn, Finn never appeared in Monica’s world again.?Therefore, it was not difficult for him to pursue Monica.

As long as he gave her happiness, as long as he made her happy enough to forget Finn, their relationship would last.

They dated for two years.

Finally, his father found out.

His father mercilessly urged them to break up.

At that time, Micheal was deeply in love with Monica. He loved her so much that he even tried to convince his father. Even if he did not marry the daughter of an official, he could rely on his own strength to rise to a higher position. However, his resistance was futile. His father did not listen to any explanation and directly went to find Monica’s father. He used harsh words while he asked Monica’s father to make his daughter break up with Micheal.

The situation had developed beyond his control.

He and Monica both endured the immense pressure from their family. In the end, it was he who chose to let go.

As long as his father did not agree to him being with Monica, he would not be able to be with her. Regardless of whether his father used his power, or Micheal himself did not have the courage to stand in between Monica and his family, they would eventually break up.

However, the final fuse to break up came from an official opportunity given to him by the Chief.

When the matter between him and Monica was getting out of hand, the Chief gave him an opportunity to go abroad to further his studies. That opportunity was something that could only be encountered by chance and not sought after. It was an exchange program between countries, and the last person who had such an opportunity was the Chief himself. One could imagine how valuable this opportunity was.

He knew clearly that he could not refuse.

Therefore, he chose to break up with Monica because he did not want to make things difficult for her again.

He knew that he had let her down in this matter.

His family and his upbringing made it impossible for him to give up his future for a woman.

Monica was probably very sad.

He thought of the heartbreaking breakup between Monica and Finn. He did not know if Monica would be in pain, and he was cruel enough to not find out.

After he left, he heard that Monica and Finn got married.

He was sad, but his political aspirations made him accept it.

He returned to the country recently, and the exchange program was not over yet.

He only returned to the country early because of his father’s illness.

After he returned, the Chief asked him to get Monica back.

Although Harken was currently in the hands of the Sanders, the economy was not under their control. It was all on the Swans. Back then, after Zachary Swan helped the Sanders take over the country, he abandoned politics and went into business. At that time, the Sanders did not have enough resources to control the development of the economy. In addition, the Swans had just come down from the political arena at that time. Their connections and influence were still rather overwhelming, thus they successfully devoted themselves to business. After decades of expansion, they had created the Swan family’s wealth and business status in Harken. Now, the Swans themselves could even influence the economic development of Harken.

Therefore, when the Sanders stabilized in the political arena, they naturally began to feel the crisis in the economic sector. Hence, they had the idea of working with the Swans through arranged marriages, and their goal was to take control of Harken’s economy from the Swans. However, the Swans refused time and time again. Everyone would think that the Swans did not want to return to the political arena. However, only a few people would know that the Swans actually did not want to give the business empire that they had built to the Sanders.

If the Sanders could not form a friendly relationship with the Swans, they would choose another way. Micheal was currently in charge of starting other large enterprises in Harken. He was in charge of other industries that the Swans had no control over, and the Cardellini’s medical materials company was the largest enterprise among the twelve families, aside from the Swans. Naturally, it was the target that the Sanders wanted to rope in or control.

Letting Micheal and Monica be together was to let Micheal take control of the Cardellinis.

Of course, the most urgent thing for the Sanders now was to gain control of the Swans through the marriage alliance. Controlling the Cardellinis was just an auxiliary line. The most important thing now was still the marriage between Fourth Master Swan and Melody. As for him and Monica, they could take it step by step.

After thinking so much, Micheal was also a little tired.

His eyes moved slightly as he looked at Monica’s photo on the computer screen in front of him.

He used her photo as the screensaver.

Actually... he was very grateful for the Sanders’ policy guidance.

At least, he could be together with Monica without his family’s objections and without affecting his official career development.

He liked her.

He really liked her, without the consideration of benefits. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He picked up the phone and dialed.

The call went through. “Micheal.”

“I miss you.”

“...”

At this moment, Monica was at home.

She had just finished talking to Jeanne and was in a good mood.

She remembered that she had to go to the hospital today for her medicine. Even though she had a small problem with her breast, she still had to pay attention to it.

She was just about to leave when she received a call from Micheal.

Actually, the day they came back from her father’s place, she had told Micheal to wait until his parents were really willing to accept them before making their relationship official. They could start dating again, but they would not see each other for the time being.

After all, if they accidentally do something they should not, she would never be able to accept it morally.

After that, they really did not see each other. They did not even call each other often.

Micheal would occasionally send her messages, but they were all simple greetings. It was the first time Micheal had said that he missed her so directly like today.

Her heart was beating a little.

Micheal did not seem to want to make things difficult for her either. He changed the topic and said, “I just finished working overtime and was about to get off work. How about you?”

“I’m at home, taking my medicine.”

“What’s wrong?”

“I have breast hyperplasia. The doctor asked me to take some medicine.”

“Is it serious?”

“It’s not serious. I had a check-up today, and the doctor said that it’s nothing serious.”

“That’s good.” Micheal heaved a sigh of relief.

“By the way, why did you get off work so late?” Monica put the pill into her mouth, took a sip of warm water, and swallowed it.

“Yeah, I was too busy.”

“Have you had dinner yet?”

“I forgot. Do you want to come out and eat with me?”

“Micheal.” Monica bit her lips. “Let’s not meet for the time being.”

The other side chuckled and said in a flat tone, “I’m just kidding.”

“Remember to have dinner.”

“Okay.”

“Then get off work early.”

“Okay.”

“Then I’ll hang up,” Monica said.

“Monica.” The other side called her name and said in a low voice.

“Yes?”

“Will you miss me?” Micheal asked.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

“Miss me?” The other side seemed unyielding.

Monica pursed her lips.

Her heart was beating a little fast...

She said, “Micheal, I miss you.”

Just as she said that, she saw Finn come out of his bedroom.

Finn usually left work very late, but today, just like her, she inexplicably got off work at six o’clock.

The two of them ordered their own takeout dinner and ate their own food as if they were strangers.

After dinner, Finn returned to his bedroom and did not come out again.

She did not expect that he would suddenly appear now.

Worse still, he appeared right in time when she said she misses Micheal.
