However, it still hurt; her heart still hurt.

It hurt so bad that she felt numb, and as Michael pulled her away, she left with him without any resistance.

In the airport, Finn and Nox walked through the special passageway and took a private plane to the South Hampshire region.

Edward had disappeared from that place.

He had not been in contact with them for an entire day. Even the signal source of the GPS on the watch he was wearing had completely disappeared.

Hence, they were going to find him now.

Other than the staff, only Finn and Nox were on the plane. The rest of them would head to their destination through other means and meet up with them there.

On the runway of South Hampton City Airport, the plane was taxiing and preparing to take off.

Nox looked out of the cabin and suddenly asked, “Do you want to get off the plane?”

Finn looked up at Nox, who turned his head. “Monica seems to be under Michael’s control. ”

Although he had mocked Monica just now, he could tell at a glance what was going on between Monica and Michael.

Therefore, if Finn wanted to go back to save Monica, Nox would not stop him.

As for Edward, Nox could go to find him alone.

“No need,” Finn immediately refused.

Nox said, “Don’t you want to help Monica?”

“I have no reason to help her.”

“She called me this morning and asked me to contact Jeanne for her,” Nox said.

Finn did not respond and did not seem interested.

“If no one helps Monica, she and Michael will definitely get married.”

“That’s her business.” Finn said bluntly, “It has nothing to do with me.”

Nox smiled.

He had to admit that Finn was much colder than he and Edward. Perhaps it was because he was an orphan and had never received any love since he was young that he did not expect to be loved or was willing to love in return, which was why she could be so heartless.

In fact, when he saw Monica’s tears falling, he was a little moved. However, because of Finn’s indifference, he left.

Nox felt that he could not compare to Finn in terms of handling relationships.

He was a typical man with a sharp mouth but a soft heart, whereas Finn, who looked harmless, was actually very cruel.

Back then, Old Master Swan probably chose Finn because of Finn’s indifference to things since he was a child and his special physique that allowed him to feel no pain. That was why he became such an important person by Edward’s side.

However, Nox did not think too much about it. After all, the most important thing for them now was to find Edward.

Edward was their everything.

With that, the plane took off.

Meanwhile, Monica was sitting in Michael’s car, watching a plane leaving from a distance in a daze.

She sat in the passenger seat, not crying, not making a fuss, and not saying a word. Even her tears were gone.

Michael also kept quiet as he drove seriously.

When the car stopped at the entrance of Monica’s apartment, Monica turned her head to take a look.

Then, she opened the car door and was about to get out.

“Monica, I don’t want to hurt you.”

Monica could not even bring herself to sneer now, but she did not answer him.

“Finn doesn’t love you.”

Monica still chose to remain silent.

“But I love you very much.”

“For using such a method to obtain love, aren’t you afraid of being struck by lightning?” Monica faced Michael.

Her tone was calm as if nothing phased her anymore.

“For you, I’m not afraid.”

Monica would not feel touched anymore.

It was true. No matter what Michael said, she would think that he was talking nonsense.

The moment she got out of the car, Michael said coldly, “The wedding next month will be held as scheduled. Don’t even think of escaping because you can’t.”

Monica pretended not to hear him as she dragged her luggage and returned to her apartment.

She thought to herself, ‘If I can’t escape… Michael can’t possibly marry my corpse, right?’

She stepped into her house and glanced at the empty room. Then, she put down her luggage and walked to the kitchen.

Fortunately, there were knives. Although she did not cook, the kitchen had everything, and from there, she found a suitable knife.

She heard that she just had to slit her wrist. Hence, she picked up the knife and slit her wrist.

‘Ouch.’ Monica frowned.

Then, she saw blood suddenly appear in front of her, and it was gushing out like crazy, looking very scary.

She was actually frightened by herself. She had never thought that she would one day choose such a method.

She realized that everything could be solved if she was not afraid of death.

However, that was not true. There were things that she could not solve and things that broke her heart so badly that living felt was more painful than dying.

Just as she was starting to feel a little dizzy, her phone suddenly rang.

She did not want to answer it, but she still managed to pick it up with her last bit of strength.

“Dad,” she said.

“Monica, is it true about you and Michael? Why didn’t you tell us that you’re getting married? What are you–”

“Dad, save me…” Monica suddenly said in a weak voice.

Gary was shocked.

At that moment, Monica fell to the ground, her vision getting darker and darker.

It turned out this was what death felt like.

However, she did not want to die. She was afraid that if she died, her parents would not want to live as well.

As expected, she was impulsive, just like how she had divorced Finn to help Michael.

She had never considered the consequences of her actions, and all she knew was regret.
