Mrs. Bacon was so angry that her body was trembling. She glared at Shelly, but under Shelly’s assertiveness, she became far less imposing.

She said, “Shelly, what do we have to do to make you leave Benjamin? Tell me!”

Shelly also calmed herself down. “I told you, I won’t leave him unless Benjamin tells me he wants to break up!”

“Shelly, how can you be so shameless?”

“You’re the shameless one, not me. What right do you have to break Benjamin and me up? Just because you’re his mother, you can limit his freedom? Why?” Shelly’s aura was very intimidating.

Under such intense intimidation, Mrs. Bacon was much less arrogant. She glared at Shelly and did not say a word for a long time.

Shelly said, “If you want us to break up, tell Benjamin to come to me. As long as he says it, I will never pester him again.”

“If Benjamin were willing to break up with you, do you think I would come looking for you?” Mrs. Bacon finally told the truth.

Shelly looked at her. In fact, she had guessed it. If Benjamin were willing to break up with her, his parents would not have had to step in.

“Do you know that you are affecting Benjamin’s future?” Mrs. Bacon asked bluntly.

Shelly frowned slightly.

She had taken up much of his time recently, but she did not pester him and affect his studies just because they were in a relationship. On the contrary, she was even very concerned about his studies and thought that she was being sensible.

“Benjamin even gave up the opportunity to study abroad for you!” When Mrs. Bacon said that, she broke down.

For the past three days, she had been trying to persuade Benjamin to leave Shelly and accept the chance to further his studies abroad, but it was useless. Benjamin refused to listen to anything they said.

There were only four days left before he was supposed to set off. If Benjamin did not accept the offer, he would miss out on that great opportunity. Hence, they had no choice but to look for Shelly, hoping that she would break up with Benjamin and allow him to study abroad.

When Shelly heard Mrs. Bacon’s words, she was a little surprised.

“Don’t you know?” Mrs. Bacon looked at Shelly and asked. “The school has given him an opportunity to study abroad at the University of Celte, one of the top universities in the world. It’s a school that many people dream of entering, yet Benjamin has given it up for you! Don’t you think that you’ve seriously affected his future and dragged him down?”

Shelly really did not know that Benjamin had given up such a good opportunity as he did not even tell her.

“If you don’t break up with Benjamin, he will not go abroad! No matter what, Benjamin’s future is the most important, and I will force you to break up with him!” Mrs. Bacon was determined.

She would rather die than allow her son to give up on such a good opportunity.

In the end, Shelly was moved by Mrs. Bacon’s words. The University of Celte was once her dream school. Back when she knew there was no way she would be with Nox, she had even thought about getting into that university.

Now that Benjamin was given the opportunity to study in such a good school, he had rejected it, and she knew very well that the reason for his rejection was her.

Shelly’s silence made Mrs. Bacon angry again. She said, “Shelly, when two people are together, all they would want is the best for each other. However, you’re doing the opposite and ruining his future!”

“I didn’t drag him down. Everything was his own choice. I didn’t make a decision for him. I didn’t even know that he gave up such a great opportunity for me.” Shelly defended herself.

“Now that you do know, break up with Benjamin immediately!” Mrs. Bacon said righteously.

“Why must we break up? If he goes abroad to study, can’t I wait for him in the country?” Shelly asked her.

She found it really funny sometimes. Why did they have to break up just because Benjamin was studying abroad?

In fact, she supported Benjamin’s departure. However, she did not think that she had to break up with him.. As long as their relationship was stable, she did not think distance mattered!
