Chapter 1524: Side Story: The Birth of Kingsley’s Son

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She might feel more comfortable if they called her by her name. However, Kingsley did not allow it, saying that it sounded just right to him.

How sick was he?

“Have you been a good boy, George?” Lucy picked up George.

At that moment, Jeanne was so tired that she was lying on the sofa, stiff as a corpse.

Although she wanted to become an assassin, it was much harder than she had imagined. However, she had to endure it because she had to rely on herself to take revenge for her mother.

She could not believe that Kingsley, that heartless person, turned a blind eye to his own sister’s death and told her to go back and look for Edward.

What relationship did she have with Edward? It was just a one-night stand, and Edward left the day after the two of them slept together. After that, she was beaten half to death by her father and was sent out of the country to commit suicide.

If Edward had feelings for her, she would not have to live such a miserable life overseas alone. Yet, Kingsley told her to look for him. Would he not be sending her to her death?

How much did Kingsley dislike her and how much did he want her to leave? She had never disturbed Kingsley from spending time with Lucy!

Lucy played with George for a while before returning to her and Kingsley’s room.

She did not know what had gotten into Kingsley lately, but he had quit smoking and sobered up. He was even doing some specialized physical training. His behavior was very strange.

As soon as Lucy pushed open the door, she saw Kingsley doing a fitness exercise under the guidance of the Hills’ healthcare doctor. Hence, she waited for him at the side for a while.

After he was done, the doctor left, and Kingsley took a pill, which Lucy found even stranger.

She had a feeling that Kingsley was seriously ill. After all, if a man suddenly cared about his health, he was usually sick.

“How was Jeanne’s training today?” Kingsley asked.

Sometimes, she felt that Kingsley was a little indifferent to Jeanne. However, most of the time, she could still feel Kingsley’s concern for Jeanne, and it was more than he would usually for other people.

Sometimes, when Jeanne was about to break down from training, she would yell at Kingsley. However, Kingsley would just keep a cold face without losing his temper.

“It’s getting better and better by the day. Probably because she’s a Hill, her patience and talent are stronger than ordinary people,” Lucy said bluntly.

Kingsley nodded as if he had expected it.

Having been with Kingsley for so long, Lucy always felt that Kingsley knew a lot of things that they did not know.

“Time to shower.” Kingsley stretched out his arm and pulled Lucy into his arms.

Kingsley was still covered in sweat after exercising.

In the beginning, she was not used to Kingsley’s intimacy, but now… she was used to everything.

The two of them lay in a huge bathtub, and Kingsley would do many intimate things for her. It made Lucy feel that if he continued to do that, she might not be able to take care of herself anymore.

“Kingsley, are you sick?” Lucy finally could not help but ask.

If he was really going to die, she had to be mentally prepared. He had been so good that she had developed a great dependency on him.

At that moment, the man who was helping her bathe suddenly looked up at her with a puzzled expression. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“You don’t smoke or drink, and you’re doing fitness exercises that aren’t too intense but can strengthen your physique. Are you sick? If you tell me, I’ll swear I won’t tell anyone. I just have to be mentally prepared.”

“Prepare for what?” Kingsley raised his eyebrows.

“If you die, I have to make plans for myself.”

“What plan?”

Of course, it was a plan for her to live well alone.

“To find another man, huh?” Kingsley asked.

She had not thought that far ahead. Even before she met Kingsley, she had always thought that she would be single for the rest of her life.

There were only two types of assassins — one would be killed and the other would die alone. There was no such thing as a so-called family.

“Don’t worry, I can live to a hundred years old. If you want to find another man, I advise you not to even think about it!” Kingsley threatened.

Lucy believed something was very wrong with the man’s brain.

“Are you really not sick?” Lucy asked to confirm.

“Do you want me to die?” Kingsley asked with a grim expression.

Lucy pursed her lips.

She had fallen in love with him, so why would she want him to die? In fact, she was afraid that he would die..
