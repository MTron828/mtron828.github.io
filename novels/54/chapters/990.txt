991 Live Press Conference, Intense Confrontation!

Moreover, her confidence was infectious.

“This time, I’ll show my dad how great I am!” Monica smiled.

Then, she strode toward the press conference in the quality inspection department.

Steve paused for a second before he caught up with Monica. He felt like the world had been dominated by the young.

The two of them arrived at the hall of the quality inspection department.

As they had communicated in advance, the people from the quality inspection department had specially arranged for both of them to sit in the front, which was carefully distanced from the reporters.

They had done their job well.

Monica remained calm and waited for the event to begin.

To be honest, she thought she would be nervous. Last night, she hid in the toilet and practiced silently. She also had dreams the entire night, which made her feel a little dazed. However, when she sat down here today, she suddenly was not nervous anymore.

It was probably because she accepted that she would have to rely on herself in the future!

Her eyes moved slightly as she looked at the few people who were walking in from the outside of the hall.

They were the newly appointed director of the quality inspection department, Daniel Cook, and other important personnel in the quality inspection department.

After those few people entered, the entire place fell silent.

The reporters kept flashing their cameras at them.

“Thank you, my media friends, for coming to the press conference regarding Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s vaccine quality inspection report. On behalf of the quality inspection department, I thank you for coming!” The sonorous and powerful voice came from Daniel Cook.

He held the script and stood on the podium, giving an opening speech to everyone.

Due to the fact that it was not an ordinary press conference, the atmosphere was quite serious.

“Now, I will officially announce the test report of Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine incident to everyone here and those watching the live stream.” After a grand opening, Daniel Cook went straight to the point. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At that moment, the person beside Daniel Cook quickly handed him an unopened envelope.

In front of everyone, Daniel Cook opened the seal and took out the test report that was stamped with the quality inspection department’s seal.

However, Daniel Cook’s expression seemed to change a little as he read the contents.

Such a change made all the reporters present nervous. They were not worried about the outcome, but they were aware of the value of the news.

Daniel Cook cleared his throat and read out the test report, “Through test sampling the batch of CSYY3299 vaccines from Cardellini Pharmaceutical, we found that the same batch of vaccine had not been completely eliminated of toxins, resulting in the possible death of the child after the vaccination.”

As soon as he said that, the crowd went into an uproar.

A reporter quickly asked, “Does this mean there’s a problem with Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s vaccine?”

“Yes. We’ve put all the batches of vaccines under control, and all children who have previously been injected with this type of vaccine will undergo physical examinations to ensure their health.”

“Why are there no problems with so many children who have been injected, but only one child has ended in death?” a reporter asked curiously.

“The incomplete elimination of the toxins doesn’t completely lead to the death of the child. It’s just a matter of probability. After all, the reaction of the toxin in the child’s body is different according to the physical condition of each child. In theory, this batch of problematic vaccines from Cardellini Enterprise shouldn’t cause the death of the child. However, through the investigation of the dead child, we found that the child had slight fever symptoms on the day of the vaccine. It was the combination of the body’s own immune system and the toxin of the vaccine that led to the immediate death of the child,” Daniel Cook explained.

“In other words, it’s Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine that caused the child’s death.” The reporter confirmed.

“You can say that!” Daniel Cook gave an affirmative answer.

“I never thought Cardellini Pharmaceutical would have such a problem. I originally believed that the incident was purely caused by the individual’s immunity!”

“Me too. All the medicine we have at home is produced by Cardellini Enterprise. Now, I’ll have to clear everything out. I will never dare to use their medicine again.”

There was a heated discussion going on at the scene.

The quality inspection department did not send anyone to silence the reporters, so the matter started to turn sour.

“As the person in charge of Cardellini Pharmaceutical, can I give everyone a positive reply to the quality inspection department’s results? ” Monica’s voice rang out in the noisy press conference.

His deep and steady voice silenced the crowd.
