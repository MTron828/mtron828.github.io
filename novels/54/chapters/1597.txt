“In that case, let the nurse take care of you.” Finn was very cold. “Let’s go, Fourth Master.”

Edward glanced at Nox. Seeing that the latter was in good spirits, he nodded and said, “Let’s go.”

‘F*ck!’ Nox cursed in his heart.

Nox lay on the hospital bed, suddenly feeling as if he had been abandoned by the whole world. In fact, he was still a little drunk, and even though he was lying on the bed, he felt dizzy.

At the same time, he was wondering how he got himself so drunk. He may have been able to deceive others, but he could not lie to himself.

He had gotten very drunk tonight, but why did he want to get so drunk? It was clear that tomorrow would be his happiest moment. Why did he want to court his own death?

Finn and Monica took a taxi back, while Edward and Jeanne also left with a convoy.

In the taxi, Monica felt a little sleepy as she usually went to bed early and it was way past her bedtime tonight. Hence, she leaned against Finn and closed her eyes. Finn made sure to hold her so that she could sleep peacefully.

As Monica was falling asleep, she could hear Finn say to the driver, “Go slower. I’ll double the fare.”

Monica wanted to laugh at how careful Finn was. When he said slow, he meant extremely slow, so slow that the taxi driver might have a mental breakdown.

After they arrived at the entrance of the neighborhood, Finn paid the driver and carried Monica back. Monica was now nearly four months pregnant and had only gained two pounds, so it was not difficult for Finn at all.

He gently placed Monica on the bed. As soon as Monica touched the bed, she fell asleep comfortably. Then, Finn took off Monica’s clothes for her and wiped her body clean while she slept peacefully. After everything, Finn tucked Monica in the blanket and then looked at her delicate face.

As she was pregnant, she rarely put on makeup, and without makeup, Monica looked less aggressive but more innocent and cute. For a moment, she was still the 19-year-old girl who pursued him eagerly. She was so lively and outgoing.

Finn could not help but lower his head and kiss Monica on the lips. That uncontrollable action made Monica frown and lick her lips.

Upon seeing that, Finn’s entire body froze. Monica’s subconscious action left him defenseless! He could not help but deepen the kiss, waking Monica up.

When she opened her eyes, she saw Finn’s face up close, taking advantage of her. He was even very engrossed in the act.

“Finn…” Monica pushed him away as she was almost suffocated by his kiss.

Only then did Finn react, and he even blushed.

Monica cursed in her heart. ‘F*ck. Why is he acting all innocent when he was clearly enjoying himself just now? Even my clothes are all twisted.’

“Go to sleep. It’s late.” Finn forced himself to calm down, but his voice was hoarse.

“Do you really want it?” Monica asked.

“Not really,” Finn denied.

Then, Monica glanced at his lower body.

Finn said, “It’s just that… It’s been a while, so…”

Monica could not help but laugh. She found Finn’s embarrassment at that moment funny. Was it not normal for husband and wife to do what a normal couple would do? Why was he so embarrassed? She said, “I heard that we can do it after four months.”

“Not with twins,” Finn quickly said.

Monica pursed her lips, and after thinking about it for a moment, she said, “Then, I…

She gestured a motion with her hand, which made Finn’s face turn even redder.

He said, “No need. I’ll just take a shower.”

“Hurry up and go to sleep. We have Nox’s wedding to attend tomorrow

morning,” Finn urged.

Then, she saw Finn running into the bathroom.

Monica’s eyes flickered. Was she that scary? She should be the one afraid here instead!

Nevertheless, Monica turned over and did not think much about it. She closed her eyes and fell asleep again. After all, she was extremely sleepy. If Finn had not woken her up with a kiss, she would have fallen asleep already.

However, before she was asleep, it crossed her mind that Finn’s kissing skills and his skills in bed were not great, and she wondered if he could… teach himself some skills..
