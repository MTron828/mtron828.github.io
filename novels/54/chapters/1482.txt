Chapter 1483: George Outwits Chloe

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When George heard Chloe’s voice, he placed Paige on his uninjured leg and said calmly, “That’s why it hurts to beat someone up.”

Chloe felt embarrassed. She could clearly feel George’s unfriendliness toward her.

If she had not seen the interaction between Candice and George, she would have thought that George was difficult to get along with. Now, it was clear that he was deliberately targeting her.

She smiled, trying to give herself a way out. “I didn’t know you knew how to joke, George.”

“I never joke. So…” George looked at Chloe. “Don’t provoke me.”

“How could I offend you? You’re my sister’s stepson. I can’t even wait to curry favor with you,” Chloe quickly said.

That “stepson” seemed unintentional, but it did not sound nice.

“Stepson? What stepson?” Paige seemed to have heard an unfamiliar word, so she asked Chloe as she blinked

“It’s-I’ nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

George glared at Chloe, and she swallowed the words that she was about to say.

It felt like George was really going to beat her up. However, knowing that she could not afford to offend George, she endured it and smiled. “You’ll know when you grow up.”

Paige, however, was not satisfied with the answer.

“Paige, come to me.” Candice picked Paige up.

Paige obediently stayed in Candice’s arms.

Then, Candice hugged Paige with one hand and touched George with the other. “It’s time for breakfast.”

As she spoke, she carried Paige to the dining table, with George following behind them. When he walked past Chloe, he said, “Don’t push your luck.” Chloe shuddered.

George was only 10 years old. How could he have so much effect on someone? Just a glance and a sentence could make her subconsciously afraid.

What made her even more unhappy was that George was actually siding with Candice. Should he not hate his stepmother?! She had previously planned to use that relationship to rope in George, but it seemed like she had really underestimated Candice.

At the dining table, everyone sat together.

“Paige, do you want me to feed you?” Chloe started to put on an act again.

“Paige is three years old. She can eat on her own,” George said bluntly.

Paige was about to nod when she lowered her head and ate her food. At that, Candice could not help but laugh.

Actually, when she saw Paige eating by herself, she wanted to feed her too. However, seeing how obedient Paige was, she thought she should listen to George.

Chloe smiled awkwardly. “George, you’re such a good brother. Paige, you have to eat obediently.”

“Alright.” Paige nodded.

“You should talk less when you’re eating,” said George. “Or you’ll seem uneducated.’

Chloe’s embarrassed face turned red. ‘George, this brat, is doing it on purpose, isn’t he?’

Chloe’s face darkened as she lowered her head to eat. She was so angry that her lungs were about to explode.

Candice, on the other hand, was in a good mood. She wondered if George was having breakfast with them today to help her beat up the mistress! That little brat may say he hated her, but his actions spoke louder than words.

After breakfast, Paige went to class.

George did not go back to his room immediately. Instead, he suddenly said, “I want to take a walk in the back garden.”

“Do you need me to push you out?” Candice asked.

“No, I want her to push me.” George looked at Chloe.

Chloe frowned, and her gut told her that George was up to no good.

“If you don’t want to, forget it.” George pushed the wheelchair and was about to walk out.

“It’s not that I don’t want to. I just thought you didn’t like me,” Chloe quickly said.

“I don’t target people.” George said, “You’re overthinking it.”

“That’s good. I was worried I might’ve offended you. I’ll push you out for a walk immediately,” Chloe said excitedly.

One of her hands was injured, so she used the other hand to push George to the back garden with some difficulty.

“George, where do you want to go?” Chloe asked gently.

“Let’s go over there and take a look.” George pointed in the direction of the pool.

Chloe frowned. She was not stupid to know that George did not like her, and there must be something wrong for him to call her out at that moment.

Now, he wanted her to push him to the pool? Could it be… Did George want to do something to her?
