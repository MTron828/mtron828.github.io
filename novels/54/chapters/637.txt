As she walked out of the room, Kingsley’s cold voice came from inside the room. “I heard you and K06 have been very close lately.”

Lucy stopped in her steps.

“You know what happens to assassins who have feelings for each other,” Kingsley reminded her.

Of course, she knew.

Once they had feelings for each other, they would definitely die.

Kingsley had dealt with quite a number of such assassins.

Once Lucy left, she called the rookie assassin, Millie, to Kingsley’s room.

She actually did not know why she would have feelings for him.

She even found it ironic!

…

In Harken, Monica looked at her phone in a daze.

She had just attended Jonathan’s funeral today, and now, it was suddenly revealed that Alexander had committed suicide by biting his tongue in prison.

So many things had happened to the Lawrences lately.

When Jeannie found out about this news, was she sad?

However, Monica did not dare to disturb her now.

She was actually the last few people to leave the cemetery. Harken had an unwritten rule that on the day of the deceased’s burial, one could not greet the owner and would leave after the burial. She had originally wanted to accompany Jeanne more. After all, she thought Jeanne was part of the Lawrences no matter what, so Jeanne would still be somewhat emotional about the death of a family member. However, because Michael had come with her and told her to leave, she went with him in the end.

When she left, she could not resist a glance at Jeanne. At the same time, she also saw Finn not far away.

Finn seemed to have been by Jeanne’s side over the last few days.

She knew it must be Fourth Master Swan’s orders, but she wondered how Finn’s body was recovering.

It had not been long since he had been discharged from the hospital, and the doctor had specifically instructed him to rest well, especially in bed. However, he seemed fine.

At the thought of Finn, Monica could feel her heart aching again.

She remembered how cold Finn had been to her that night — how he threw her out of the car and left.

She, too, had been going to Jonathan’s funeral from time to time over the last few days, so she saw Finn every time. However, Finn had never so much as spare a glance at her.

It made her feel miserable.

In fact, she hoped Finn could understand for once that she had no choice but to make that decision.

Why could he not trust her?

Her throat bobbed, and she wanted to cry again.

Finn was too indifferent to her, and it gave her a feeling that it would be difficult for her to reconcile with Finn in the future. She was really afraid that Finn would part ways with her just like that!

However, she could not give up halfway with Michael.

Michael had finally managed to get on the right track. If she left him now, the media might think they were just acting, which would naturally make it worse for Michael.

She thought about it. Their “relationship” would last for at least half a year.

However, would Finn still be there half a year later?

She felt a lump in her throat.

The thing she found most difficult in her life was probably relationships.

She took a deep breath and glanced at the phone that was ringing.

She forced herself to adjust her emotions and answered the call.

“Monica, where are you?” A friend’s excited voice came from the other end of the phone.

“What’s the matter?” Monica answered with a lack of interest.

“You haven’t gone on a night out with your girlfriends for a long time, and we miss you. We’re having a drinking party tonight. Come out and have some fun.”

“I’m not interested.” Monica refused flatly.

“What’s the matter? Has spending time with Director Ross tired you out?” her friend teased.

“What are you talking about?” Monica started to get angry.

There was nothing going on between Michael and her.

In fact, she was angry that people were teasing her like that.

“Okay, okay, okay. I won’t say anymore. I know you’re embarrassed. But seriously, Monica, you’ve been going to nightclubs for many years, but you’ve always kept yourself clean. For that, all of us think you’re a legend. Look at us. Which one of us hasn’t done something stupid in secret?” Her friend continued to tease.

It was not that she did not want to do it, but she had never been single.

She was either with Finn or Michael.

She had never been single before, so she could not do something like have an affair.

“Come on, let’s go out and let loose. Everyone has been quite busy recently with their own lives. It’s been a long time since we’ve gathered.” Her friend tried persuading her.

Monica was actually not very interested.

However, when she thought about how she had been suffering from insomnia lately, she felt she should indulge herself. Should she really numb herself with alcohol?
