1385 Parent-Teacher Conference: You’re My Son!

“It’s still early. Go back to sleep.”

“Are you leaving?” Candice asked.

“I’ll be back tonight.”

“Alright.” Although Candice was still unconscious, she was a little reluctant to part with him.

Edward was reluctant too, but with great power comes great responsibility. Hence, he could only give himself one full day of private time and had to return to his responsibilities a day later.

Candice rolled over and fell asleep again.

She had slept too late last night. After chatting with Edward, she thought about many things. For example, since Edward had asked her to take care of George and Paige for him, she should really take good care of them.

When Candice woke up again, she felt something on her face that made her itch. She opened her eyes only to see a young and cute face with pouting lips, which was kissing her at that moment.

Candice’s heart softened. Seeing how obedient Paige was, her heart almost melted.

She hugged Paige. “Good morning, Paige.”

“Mom, you’re awake.” Paige was excited.

“Yes.”

“So Snow White’s story is true,” Paige said happily.

“What story?”

“It means that the prince can wake up the princess by kissing her. I just kissed you, and you really woke up,” Paige said innocently.

Candice could not help but laugh. In a child’s world, everything was good.

She sat up on the bed and stroked Paige’s silky bob-cut hair. “Thank you, Prince Paige, for kissing me and waking me up.”

“I’ll come and kiss you every day.” Paige was even happier after being praised.

“Alright.” Candice agreed immediately.

She did not even notice the doting tone and motherly care in her voice. It was as if it came naturally.

Then, she lifted the blanket and got out of bed. When she went to the bathroom to wash up, there was a little tail following her closely. It was as if she would suddenly run away and Paige had to watch her closely.

Once Candice had washed up, she went downstairs with Paige in her arms.

Downstairs, Teddy had prepared breakfast. When he saw them appear together, he hurriedly went forward and said respectfully, ” Madam, you can eat breakfast now. ”

“Thank you.”

Candice was polite and sat down at the dining table with Paige in her arms.

“Teddy, what time does George usually go to school in the morning?” Candice asked Teddy as she fed Paige breakfast. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In her memory, she had never held a child before, let alone feed a child. Yet now, it was as if it was instinctive, and she did it with ease. She could also distract herself and chat with others.

“He has to get to school by 8 a.m. But the school isn’t too far away, so we usually leave at 7:40 a.m.,” Teddy replied.

“What time does George get up?”

“Because he studies ’til late at night, he won’t get up too early in the morning. He’ll wake up by 7 a.m.”

7 a.m. was still quite early.

Nevertheless, Candice remained calm and asked, “Do you usually send him to school?”

“I don’t. George has a chauffeur to drop him off and pick him up. I only take care of his breakfast every morning.”

Candice nodded.

Following that, Teddy looked at the time and said, “Madam, you and Miss Paige can take your time with breakfast. I have to prepare for George’s parent-teacher conference. ”

“Are there a lot of things to prepare for the parent-teacher conference?” Candice asked.

“Oh, no.” Teddy quickly replied, “There’s no need to prepare anything for George’s parent-teacher conference. The teachers are all very friendly to George. You can just sit there and wait to be praised. I just need to leave Bamboo Garden for two hours to do my task.”

“That’s good.” Candice heaved a sigh of relief.

She had never attended a parent-teacher conference, so she was afraid that she would not know anything.

“In that case, I’ll go and get busy,” Teddy said respectfully.

Candice nodded.

“Mom, I’m full,” Paige said loudly.

“Are you really full?” Candice asked with a doting expression.

“Yes, I’m really full.” As she spoke, she even puffed up her chubby little tummy.

Seeing how cute Paige was, Candice said, “Paige, can I discuss something with you?”

“Alright.” Paige nodded obediently.

She might not even know what it meant to discuss things and simply agreed.

She said, “I’m going to attend your brother’s parent-teacher meeting later. Can I leave you alone for a while?”

“You can’t.” Paige refused unhappily.

“Don’t you love your brother, Paige?”
