Chapter 61: Business Dinner

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At night, the Lawrences sat in the dining room and had dinner.

Jeremy and his family were forcibly chased away by Jenifer. When they left, they cried their hearts out. They said that Jenifer did not care about their lives anymore, which made Jenifer feel very awkward in front of all the servants. Naturally, the matter did not end well.

Nonetheless, Jenifer was still smart. Before Alexander came back from work, she had already dealt with everything that needed to be dealt with.

At this moment, there were not many people at the dining table. Jasmine had also become a Swan.

“What’s going on with George?” Alexander suddenly asked seriously.

Jeanne raised her head and looked at Alexander. “What do you mean?”

“The interview for elementary school today.” Alexander’s expression was very ugly. “Today, countless people called to congratulate me, saying that I have a genius grandson. After so long, I still don’t know anything.”

“Did you ask?” Jeanne sneered.

“Do you have to go against me?” Alexander suddenly put down his cutleries.

The atmosphere became very serious.

Jenifer and Joshua did not dare to move their cutleries.

On the other hand, Jeanne was very calm as she took some food for George.

After all, George needed to grow.

“Jeanne!” Alexander saw that Jeann ignored him, so his expression became even uglier.

Jeanne said nonchalantly, “It’s not a big deal. He’s just a little smarter than the average person. What’s there to talk about?”

“You...” Alexander was speechless by Jeanne’s words.

“Let’s eat. If the food gets cold, they won’t taste good.” Jenifer was the best at acting as a good person. When she knew that Alexander was feeling a little awkward at this moment, she quickly eased the atmosphere. She took some food and placed it on Alexander’s plate. “You’re tired after working all day. Eat more.”

Alexander glared at Jeanne and turned to ask Jenifer, “How’s Paul?”

“That child didn’t perform well and wasn’t selected,” Jenifer said nonchalantly, “It’s also because he hasn’t seen much of the world since he was young. Thinking about it, there are indeed differences between South Hampton City and the small place I came from. I think that rather than letting you spend all your effort to send Paul to an elite school, if he can’t keep up in the end, it’s better for him to just find a good school in my hometown. It might be even better.”

Jenifer’s words were very pleasant to hear.

On one hand, she did not belittle her nephew’s incompetence. On the other hand, she gave Alexander a lot of face. At least, it would not make people think that Alexander was not capable enough to send Paul to the best school. It was because Paul was not suitable for it.

Jeanne could not help but look at Jenifer. She felt that after these years, this woman’s conduct had risen to another level.

Now that Jeanne thought about it, the reason Jenifer had chased her younger brother’s family away so early was that she was afraid that Jeremy’s family would cause trouble and embarrass Alexander. If Alexander was embarrassed because of Jenifer’s family, she would not have a good time either.

Jeanne pursed her lips lightly and continued to eat quietly.

Alexander listened to Jenifer’s words and nodded slightly. “An expensive school isn’t necessarily good. It has to be suitable for the child.”

Jenifer quickly agreed.

At the dining table, everything returned to normal.

Alexander suddenly thought of something and said, “Oh right. Tomorrow evening, you’ll dress up and attend a business dinner with me.”

“What dinner?” Jenifer asked.

“Do you still remember MUK?”

“The e-commerce company that the Lockes wanted to cooperate with last time?” Jenifer asked.

Alexander nodded. “The CEO of MUK has sent out an invitation to a dinner, inviting most of the upper-class companies in South Hampton City to attend. Inside Information says that MUK may still find a local company to cooperate with, so we’ll be going to pay them a visit tomorrow. There may even be a chance for us to cooperate.”

“I’ll dress well.”

“I’ll also bring Joshua with me tomorrow. Help us prepare the suits for the banquet before 5:00 pm.”

“Okay. “Jenifer nodded quickly and asked again, “Will Eden and Jasmine Go?”

“Of course,” Alexander said immediately, “How could they not be included for such a gathering of the upper class?”

“That’s true.” Jenifer’s tone was a little smug.

“Speaking of Jasmine, when you see her tomorrow, tell her to have a child with Eden as soon as possible. She can only have a foothold in that big family after she has a child.”

“Don’t worry, I’ve told Jasmine about this. She has been smart since she was young and knows what to do.”

“Okay,” Alexander answered.

He knew Jenifer would be considerate in this aspect, so there was no need to say anything more.

Jeanne and George just quietly ate their dinner.

Other than the unpleasant incident just now, this family never took the initiative to mention them anymore.

Not to mention… bringing them to the high-class banquet.

Alexander probably thought that only Joshua and Jasmine had the right to go socialize with him.

…

The next day.

In the afternoon, Jeanne slowly changed into a gown and put on makeup.

While applying mascara, she asked George, “Are you coming with me this evening?”

“No.”

“Are you afraid of being alone here?”

“No.”

“Alright then.” Jeanne put down her mascara.

She had always respected her son.

Previously, Jeanne had always brought him along because she was afraid that he would not be used to being alone. Now that they had returned for a month, he had gotten used to what he needed to get used to. If he was not used to it, he would not be able to get used to it no matter what.

Jeanne carefully picked out a large red lipstick and applied it skillfully. Then, she put on a pair of exaggerated diamond fringed earrings. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After that, she put down her hair, and her long curly hair was casually draped over her shoulders.

She was done dressing up.

Jeanne stood up from the makeup mirror.

She was wearing a black dress with a sling with little fabric, where a few straps criss-crossed on her back, revealing her perfect waist line. The skirt only reached the middle of her thighs, and if she was not careful, she would have a panty flash. The rest of her legs that were not covered were smooth and fair. She wore a pair of black sequined stilettos. Under the reflection of the light, her straight legs seemed to sparkle.

Jeanne was the kind of woman who would seem like a kept woman even if she wore her clothes properly, not to mention a dress with little fabric. She looked so alluring that it would make people commit a crime.

She walked to George’s side and gently touched his head. She said, “Be good at home.”

George nodded.

Jeanne casually picked up a white feather shawl that was placed at the side. The shawl could hide part of her sexiness, making her look less aggressive and more gentle and moving.

She walked out of the room and went downstairs.

At this moment, Alexander brought Jenifer and Joshua out of the door as well. They sat in the special car of the Lawrences and left.

Jeanne casually went to the garage to drive her car and then slowly drove out of the Lawrence family’s home.

She did not lie to Monica. She really did not like driving.

To her, it was meaningless to drive if she did not race.

In the end, she was still patient and drove the sports car to the destination at a normal speed.

Nox’s reminder was right. She still had to abide by the traffic regulations. She was still worried about whether she had been punished yesterday.

At this moment, in the Swan family’s Bamboo Garden.

Teddy held a traffic ticket and looked at it. His eyes almost popped out!

‘Why did I have 12 points deducted, fined 3,000 dollars, and even had my driver’s license impounded?!

‘Am I... sleepwalking?!’
