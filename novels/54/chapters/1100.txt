1101 Announcing Jeanne’s Identity As The Princess of the Sanders

Her emotions had also returned to normal, and nothing about her seemed out of the ordinary as she was still very respectful to him.

After three days, Kingsley had also returned to his most cold-blooded state.

It seemed like the unhappiness that happened between the two of them three days ago was gone.

The assassins took Kingsley’s private jet and rushed to South Hampton City.

Jeanne looked out of the window at the white clouds outside the cabin and was a little lost in thought.

Yu Jiayi sat down beside her and just looked at her conflicted expression. It was obvious that Jeanne would have to abandon all of her worries this time.

This time, Jeanne would not have a choice of her own!

…

On Wednesday, the news of the Sanders’ wedding spread like wildfire in South Hampton City, and the attention finally shifted away from Cardellini Pharmaceutical.

That was probably why the Sanders’ marriage was a little rushed.

Logically speaking, a wedding of such a large scale like the Sanders’ should have been announced half a year in advance. It was rare to hold a wedding ceremony only a week after the announcement.

However, it had to be said that the Sanders’ actions had attracted everyone’s attention.

It was also because they did not want too many people to focus on Cardellini Pharmaceutical as it would be harmful to them.

After all, they had suffered a huge setback due to Cardellini Enterprise.

However, if there was another chance next time, they would still take Cardellini Enterprise for themselves. It was only a matter of time.

At that moment, Monica was sitting in her office, also reading some news about the Sanders’ wedding.

She used to love to gossip, but now, it was not as fun anymore.

She put down her phone and continued with her work aimlessly.

…

In Bamboo Garden in the Swans’ residence, Edward was dressed very formally.

Nox had also arrived.

The two of them were prepared to set off to the Sanders’ residence to attend Stacey and William Gates’s wedding.

When it was time to leave, Edward turned to George, whom he deliberately did not allow to go to school today, and said, “I will bring your mother back tonight.”

George did not believe him. He had a feeling that his mother would not come back.

“So be good at home.”

However, George did not refute Edward. He always felt that his father felt even more uneasy than he was when it came to his mother.

Edward patted George’s head before leaving with Nox.

Today, there would definitely be a bloodbath. The Sanders would definitely not be able to hold back.

Edward and Nox sat in the car, and the both of them were a little too serious.

Nox was not someone who could keep things to himself. Hence, he turned to Edward and asked, “Isn’t the old master going?”

He was asking about Zachary Swan.

After all, the invitation had made it very clear to invite both Old Master Yan and Edward to Stacey’s wedding.

If Old Master Swan did not go, would he not be disrespecting the Sanders?

“Would you still want to go up the mountain knowing that there’s a tiger there?” Edward replied coldly, “The only reason I’m attending the wedding is to start a war.”

He had no thoughts about dealing with the Sanders again.

In fact, it was time it ended.

Nox did not say anything more. In any case, he only needed to carry out Edward’s orders unconditionally.

“By the way.” Nox suddenly thought of something. “Will Jeanne will be there today?”

“She should be.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“She would probably be there to kill you,” Nox said bluntly.

“I know,” Edward replied, “but she can’t do it.”

“How can you be so sure?” Nox looked at Edward.

He was really afraid that the guy would not die in the hands of the Sanders but in the hands of Jeanne.

“I believe in Jeanne.”

“...I don’t. ” Nox enunciated each word. “So, if she really threatens your life, I won’t go soft on her.”

To Nox, his mission in life was to protect Edward. No matter who it was, he could not allow her to threaten Edward’s life.

“She won’t,” Edward confirmed.

Tonight, he was determined to bring Jeanne back to his side no matter what. Never again would he be away from her.

The car slowly drove into the Sanders’ residence.

At the door, the Sanders’ security guards stood in a row. Everyone who entered the Sanders’ residence would be thoroughly searched.

Moreover, those whose names were not on the invitation card were not allowed to enter. Thus, Nox could only wait outside.

Edward walked into the Sanders’ residence alone.

There were not many wedding decorations inside, and it did not look too grand. It was obvious that the Sanders wanted to keep a low profile in that aspect.
