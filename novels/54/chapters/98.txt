Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the Lawrences’ restaurant.

Everyone gathered around the luxurious table for dinner.

Jasmine seemed to be putting effort into it. She acted like a family pet, warming up to Alexander, Jenifer, and Eden.

In reality, everything she did was on purpose. It was to make Jeanne jealous.

Of course, Jeanne wasn’t jealous. She even thought that Jasmine was stupid.

Hence, she ate dinner with her son calmly and ignored Jasmine.

In Jasmine’s eyes, she was sure that Jeanne was acting cold on purpose. In fact, Jeanne must be jealous of everything she had now.

Not only her status in the Lawrences, but also her love with Eden.

Jasmine felt a little smug.

At the dining table.

Alexander suddenly said, “Eden, how have you been doing after taking over Swanhaven Bank?”

“It’s been good,” Eden replied. “It was a little tricky at first, but I’ve gotten the hang of it.”

“That’s good.” Alexander nodded. “Young people should prioritize their careers.”

“Yes.” Eden said respectfully.

To outsiders, Eden Swan was an ambitious, polite, humble, and hardworking person. He would make others think that he was very well-mannered. Among the arrogant and conceited young heirs in the upper-class society, he was as refreshing as spring water and was highly regarded by the elders.

“Eat more.” Alexander said to Eden.

“Thanks, Dad.”

The two of them chatted casually.

It seemed unusually harmonious.

Jasmine glanced at Jeanne from time to time, her eyes smug.

Jeanne pretended not to notice. Some people were born stupid.

After dinner.

Alexander asked Eden to have tea with him in the tea room.

Jasmine accompanied Eden affectionately.

What made Jasmine unhappy was that Alexander also called Jeanne.

Naturally, Joshua was there as well. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Alexander took a sip of tea and finally went straight to the point. “Eden, do you know that the Lawrence Enterprise has been negotiating with MUK?”

“I’ve heard of it,” Eden replied. “But because the Swans had no plans to invest in the external businesses, I don’t know much about it.”

Alexander Lawrence nodded. “The Swan Enterprise already owns many businesses. If the group expands further, there would be imbalances in the market.”

“Yes, that’s why we at Swan Enterprise hasn’t had much contact with other companies.”

“Eden, I won’t beat around the bush. I need your help with something.”

“Please go ahead, Dad.” Although he appeared enthusiastic, Eden was already planning his answer.

Alexander sighed and looked a little solemn. He said, “I won’t hide it from you. The Lawrence Enterprise and MUK have agreed on a contract today.”

“That’s a good thing. Congratulations, Dad.” Eden knew how to flatter someone.

“I heard that many in MUK wanted to collaborate with us. Now that they have chosen Lawrence Enterprise, it proves that our company is better than the competition!” Jasmine quickly flattered.

“Jeanne was the one who secured it.”

“…” Jasmine’s expression changed visibly.

She turned and glared at Jeanne who was sipping her tea calmly.

Jasmine gritted her teeth, unhappy.

“The contract has been negotiated, but Lawrence Enterprise is short on funds. Eden, you should know that the Lawrence Enterprise has invested a lot in this period of time for our restructuring. In a situation where funding is already very difficult, we have resorted to using our reserve funds to negotiate the contract with MUK. However, because of something that came up at the last minute, the original investment amount increased by 200 million yuan. 200 million is not a lot but at this critical juncture, it has stumped me.”

“Dad, do you mean you want to take a loan from Swanhaven Bank?” Eden was smart to begin with. Moreover, Alexander had already made it so clear, so he couldn’t play dumb.

However, he felt a little uncomfortable.

Eden was already unhappy that he did not get this project, and now Alexander was asking him for help?

“That’s right.” Alexander Lawrence nodded.

“I will get the staff to come to Lawrence Enterprise tomorrow to do the calculations for the loan. I will try my best to settle the loan amount of 200 million yuan. As for the interest, I will do my best to give you the best rates.” Eden Swan had his poker face on.

“Eden,” Alexander said. “I heard that Swanhaven Bank has a three-year, interest-free loan.”

Eden’s expression changed slightly.

“Give me the three-year loan,” Alexander said matter-of-factly.
