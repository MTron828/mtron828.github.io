Chapter 219: Monica, You Really Don’t Treat Me as a Man, Do You?!

Finn left the Swans’ manor only after treating Fourth Master Swan’s wounds.

He had a day off today.

He did not receive any emergency calls.

After some thought, he went straight home.

It was not the weekend. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Technically, Monica should not be at home.

Finn seemed to have deliberately kept a distance from Monica during this period.

It seemed to be intentional. Even if they were living under the same roof, they did not want to see each other.

Nonetheless, the moment Finn pushed open the door.

He was suddenly stunned.

Finn saw Monica.

He also saw Monica running around the living room naked.

Monica seemed to have heard the sound of the door being opened. While being naked, she quickly ran to the sofa in the living room and hid under it. She shouted at Finn, “Don’t come over!”

Finn pursed his lips.

Sometimes, he felt that Monica was too energetic.

He did not know what was wrong with her today.

“Why are you back? Aren’t you at work?” Monica asked him loudly, her face full of displeasure.

“I have a day off today,” Finn said coldly.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were coming back?!” Monica complained.

‘Do I need her permission to enter this house?!’

Finn did not answer Monica.

He walked in directly from the main door.

Monica heard his footsteps and became nervous again. “Finn, I told you not to come over. Are you a monster? Get out first!”

Finn pretended not to hear it, and his footsteps were getting closer.

“Finn, I told you not to come over. C-can you not be so rude? You know that I’m not wearing any clothes. I told you not to come over. Ah—” Monica screamed.

At this moment, it sounded like the footsteps were getting further away from her.

Next, there was a clang.

The door was slammed shut.

Monica was stunned.

She peeked her head out from the sofa and looked at Finn’s room, which was tightly shut.

‘F*ck!’

Monica was suddenly unhappy again.

She just did not know why she was so unhappy.

Monica was angry that Finn did not care about her condition and did not act like a gentleman at all. Despite that, when she saw that he was not interested in her body at all, she had some indescribable emotions.

She lowered her head to look at her figure.

‘I’m so hot and curvy.

‘Finn must be a f*cking eunuch!

‘Did he really have sex with Patsy?!

‘Ugh.’

Monica suddenly felt a sharp pain in her heart.

Every time she thought of Patsy lying naked on Finn’s bed, she would still feel a little stifled.

She would never be able to…

Monica reckoned that even if she married Micheal and had a happy life after this, she would not be able to get over Finn having cheated on her!

Every time she thought about it, it was like a fishbone stuck in her throat. She could neither swallow it nor spit it out!

Monica stood up from the sofa.

In any case, Finn was not interested in her body, so she did not have to avoid him.

She went to the laundry room to look for clothes.

Monica had just come back to take a shower and planned to take a nap. However, after taking a shower, she realized that her towel was not in the bathroom.

Usually, it was the housekeeper who prepared it for her.

Monica basically could not find such daily necessities. Occasionally when the housekeeper came to clean her room, the housekeeper would bring used clothes to the laundry room to wash them. Monica guessed that the housekeeper might have forgotten to bring them back this time, so she did not think too much about it and walked out naked.

Moreover...

She did not expect Finn to return so suddenly.

Monica was almost scared to death the moment she heard the sound of the door.

She rummaged through the laundry room.

Although the housekeeper had folded everything neatly, she did not see her bath towel. She rummaged through the stuff again and again but found a lot of men’s underwear instead.

‘Are these Finn’s?!

‘Would a man like him let others wash his underwear?!’

Monica pursed her lips.

She threw the underwear away.

They were deliberately thrown to the ground.

It was as if she was venting on purpose.

Monica wrapped herself in her towel and stepped on Finn’s underwear, preparing to leave.

At that moment, she suddenly saw Finn appear at the door of the laundry room.

Monica’s expression changed slightly.

She was still a little embarrassed.

After all, she was still stepping on Finn’s underwear under her bare feet.

It was obvious that Finn had seen it.

He saw it clearly.

Monica felt like she wanted to bury her head in the ground.
