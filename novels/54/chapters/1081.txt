1082 Going To Court: All The Crimes Have Been Proven

The judge looked at the jury, who exchanged opinions among each other before giving the judge a clear answer.

The judge said, “From the current evidence and the facts at the scene, we can determine that Brie wasn’t the mastermind behind this.”

“In that case, we can be sure that Wally’s confession statement was also fabricated and cannot be used as a legal basis.”

“The plaintiff’s argument stands.” The judge affirmed.

“Since Wally has concealed the truth of this incident, I have some questions for him.”

“Permission granted.” The judge agreed.

Monica faced Wally, who also looked at Monica without much change in his mood.

Monica said, “You said you were instructed by Brie and that she gave you the potassium cyanide?”

Wally did not answer.

“May I ask how Brie gave it to you?”

However, Wally still did not answer.

Monica’s eyes narrowed. “According to Harken’s law, if the defendant knows the truth and doesn’t answer, we can assume that the relevant facts stated by the plaintiff are true. Is that right, Mr. Smith?”

Judah was stunned. He did not expect Monica to be so familiar with the law.

He quickly replied, “Yes.”

“In that case, the truth of my statement is that Wally’s potassium cyanide was provided by Michael. He was instructed by Michael to inject the child with the vaccine and then shift the blame to Cardellini Pharmaceutical.”

“I object! I object to Monica framing me like this! Just because Wally didn’t answer doesn’t mean that I gave it to him. That is not true!” Michael was flustered.

“I’m going to tell Wally the truth now. She should be the one to answer, not you.” Monica paused after every word.

Michael gritted his teeth.

Monica looked at Wally again, “If you don’t answer, it means that the facts of my statement are true. Once established, it can be used as evidence against Michael!”

“No,” Wally said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Monica sneered. “If not, who gave it to you?”

“Brie,” Wally insisted.

Michael sneered. Monica had really underestimated him.

Wally would rather lie than fulfill Monica’s wish because Michael had bribed Wally, and the latter would never betray him.

“If the defendant is obviously lying, we can also conclude that the plaintiff’s statement is true.” Monica enunciated each word clearly.

Michael’s face turned pale.

When did Monica become so powerful that she even knew the laws of Harken?

Wally was starting to panic.

Like Daniel, he probably did not expect such a thing to happen, so he had not prepared any countermeasures.

He could not betray Michael. According to their rules, he could not expose his employer. If he did, he would have to face something a hundred times more painful than a normal death!

With that, he looked straight at Monica, who said, “You can choose not to answer, or you can choose to lie, but it won’t help you in hiding Michael’s crime. I’ll give you two minutes to think about it. If you answer truthfully, I can plead with the judge to give you a lighter sentence. But if you insist on doing it your way, I won’t force you.”

After saying that, Monica calmly waited for Wally’s answer.

As time passed, Michael was also very nervous.

Regardless of whether Wally admitted it or not, once it was determined that Wally was lying, the court would use the plaintiff’s statement of facts as a basis. Most importantly, he could not find any evidence to clear his suspicion.

He really did not expect that he would fall into Monica’s hands one day.

He originally thought that even if he admitted to the crime of instigating the quality inspection department to issue a false report, he would only be sentenced to three to five years in prison. As long as he was alive, he could still make a comeback!

However, it was obvious that Monica wanted to exterminate him!

After two minutes, Monica said again, “I’ll ask you one more time. Did Michael instruct you to do everything?”

Wally looked at Monica and remained silent for a while. Then, he said, “I only have one request.”

“Go ahead.”

Michael was on the brink of losing control of his emotions!

“I hope I can be executed immediately,” Wally said.

Shocked, Monica looked at Judah.

Judah quickly said, “According to the laws of Harken, regardless of whether the mastermind or the instigator, as long as that person directly caused the death of a person, and it is a foul deed, they can be sentenced to death immediately. Wally’s crimes fulfill the above conditions.”

Having gotten his answer, Wally said, “Yes, it was Michael who told me to do so. I signed a life-and-death agreement with him. He paid me 5 million dollars, and I have a transaction record.”

“Please show me your transaction record.” Judah was getting a little excited.

Although Michael’s conviction was obvious, it still gave people a sense of accomplishment after the truth was revealed. At least, there would be no gossip, and the court’s decision would be firmer.

“My account...” Wally gave him the account number. “It’s not my name, but I’ve been using it. Michael first transferred 2.5 million as a deposit, and after the job was done, he transferred another 2.5 million. Now, both payments are already in my account, and I haven’t embezzled them yet.”

“Your Honor, please confirm.”

The judge arranged for the bank to verify it, and the bank staff came to the court to confirm that Wally’s designated account had received a transfer record of 5 million dollars, but it was not from Michael’s account. Nevertheless, that account had multiple transfer records with Michael’s own account.

In that way, it could be determined that the transaction between Michael and Wally existed, which was enough to prove that Michael had deliberately swapped the vaccine.

At that moment, all of Michael’s crimes were proven!
