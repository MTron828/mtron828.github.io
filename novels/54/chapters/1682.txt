Shelly stared at Katie coldly and sarcastically.

After Katie said that, she was also a little embarrassed. She, too, knew that she had not raised Bella in all the years and was ashamed to say that she wanted Bella back now.

The two of them stood at the entrance for a while, with Shelly not responding to Katie. For one, she felt that Katie was not worth her time, and she even thought she had heard a joke.

Three years ago, Katie said she would leave the child to her. Yet, three years later, she wanted Bella back. There were no free lunches in this world.

“Shelly, I’m sorry. I know this might be unfair to you, but…” Katie mustered her courage and said when she saw that Shelly did not respond. Shelly interrupted her, “You can save it. I won’t agree.”

Katie looked at Shelly in a daze.

With Bella in her arms, Shelly walked straight into the neighborhood. “Don’t come looking for me again. I won’t agree to it.”

Katie quickly pulled Shelly back and said anxiously, “Shelly, I have my reasons. I really had no choice. Can you listen to what I have to say? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“There’s nothing much for you to say.” Shelly was cold. “There are some things I don’t want to say in front of Bella, but I’m sure you know your place. So, don’t appear in front of me again.”

Not wanting to waste any more time with Katie, Shelly pushed Katie’s hand away and left with Bella in her arms.

“Shelly, it’s so late. Can you take me in?” Katie suddenly said, “I came all the way here and waited for you all night. I haven’t even eaten dinner. Can you at least let me stay for one night?” Katie said.

Shelly pursed her lips.

Katie continued, “Shelly, I’m begging you. Can you just let me and Bella stay under the same roof for one night?”

Shelly looked at Katie, who was only three years older than her but got married early in their hometown. Not many of them would go to university, so they would get married and have children after graduating from high school. Katie was one of them.

Most of the women in their hometown were really uncultured, ignorant, and old-looking. Katie was 24 years old, but she looked at least 30 years old right now.

In the end, Shelly’s heart softened, AND She said, “Yes.”

Katie quickly smiled and kept thanking Shelly. “Shelly, thank you. Thank you.”

Shelly did not want to be so cold to Katie either. Otherwise, Katie might take Bella away. With that, Shelly brought Katie into her house.

As Katie followed Shelly in, she could not help but sigh. “Shelly, is this your home?”

Shelly nodded. “Yes.”

“The last time I came to see you, you didn’t even have a house of your own. You’re really capable to have a house in just a few years! Unlike me, who takes care of my children, husband, and mother-in-law at home every day without any income. I really envy you for being able to have your own house in such a big city like South Hampton City,” Katie said sincerely.

Instead of replying to that, Shelly said, “Katie, you can stay in Bella’s room tonight, and Bella will sleep with me.”

Katie was stunned for two seconds before she looked at Bella. When Bella met Katie’s gaze, she quickly dodged and hid behind Shelly. It was obvious that she was afraid of the person in front of her.

“As you can see, Bella is very afraid of you.” Shelly said, “Why don’t you go take a shower first? Did you bring a change of clothes?”

“Yes,” Katie quickly said.

“Go ahead.”

Katie nodded, not daring to say anything else.

Shelly watched as Katie walked into the bathroom and said to Bella, “I will send her away tomorrow. Don’t be afraid. You’ll be sleeping with me tonight.”

“Alright,” Bella replied in her innocent voice.

“Good girl,” Shelly praised Bella.

After that, she made Bella watch television on the sofa while she went to the kitchen to prepare noodles for Katie.

She had heard Katie say that she had not eaten anything all night, so since there were only oats and fruits at home, she made some porridge. When Katie came out of the shower, Shelly said, “Come and eat.” Katie was a little touched as she walked over and saw a bowl of porridge.

“Eat,” Shelly said coldly. “I’ll give Bella a shower..”
