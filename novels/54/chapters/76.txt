Chapter 77: Roping in Confidants

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Next, no matter what, you have to think of a way to place a few of your confidants into Jeanne’s project team. Once Jeanne has any movements, you’ll know. You won’t have to be afraid that she’ll unknowingly cause trouble.” Eden “suggested some strategies” unhurriedly.

“Okay.” Joshua quickly nodded.

“Lastly, go and secretly investigate the preferences of West, MUK’s person in charge. Rumor has it that Jeanne is West’s lover, right? Find a woman to eliminate Jeanne. When that happens, how do you think Jeanne can work with MUK? Men like a novelty.”

“I got it!” Joshua appeared to be unusually excited.

At first, he was confused and did not know how to stop Jeanne’s development. After hearing what Eden said, he was suddenly full of confidence.

“If you have any problems, look for me. However, let me get straight to the point. If I tell you these things and you reveal them to a third person, don’t expect me to help you in the future,” Eden threatened.

“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone no matter what,” Joshua promised.

Eden did not say anything more and hung up the phone.

He was sitting in his large office. He stood up, lit a cigarette, and walked toward the French window.

Swanhaven Bank under the Swan Enterprise was located in the most luxurious area of South Hampton City. It was the tallest office building. As Eden smoked, he looked down at the entire city, and the corner of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

Jeanne could forget about escaping from him!

Not even his fourth uncle could have her!

…

At the Lawrence Enterprise.

Jeanne seriously and carefully looked at the resumes submitted by her secretary.

It was indeed not an easy task to select ten people out of more than 200 people.

She picked up the phone and said, “Amy, during the meeting earlier, I asked all the supervisors to come to report to me about their work. Remind them that those who are prepared can come earlier.”

“Yes,” the secretary said respectfully. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jeanne lowered her head again and briefly picked some that she felt she could consider. As for who she wanted to pick, she needed others to help her make the decision. After all, she was not familiar with the internal department of the company.

After a while, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in.”

The secretary stood at the door, hesitating to speak.

“Just say what you want to say.”

“Deputy Director Lawrence has been in a meeting with all the supervisors, so they can’t come to report their work. As for how long it’ll take for the meeting to be over, I don’t know yet...” The secretary said awkwardly.

Jeanne sneered.

Of course, she knew what Joshua was going to do.

It was just to stop her from developing.

Nonetheless, based on her understanding of Joshua, he should not have acted so quickly.

In the end, she did not care. She said, “Since the deputy director has work arrangements, don’t disturb them. Come in. I want to ask you something.”

“Okay.” Amy walked in and closed the door.

Jeanne was straightforward. “How many years have you been in the company? Which department did you work in before? What did you do specifically?”

“I’ve been in the company for three years. Before that, I was in the secretarial room of the general affairs department. This morning, I was transferred here to become your secretary,” Amy answered quickly.

“Do you have much contact with the people in the company?”Jeanne asked.

“I have more contact with the people in the general affairs department. I only contact very few people from other departments. After all, we’re not all on the same floor. The nature of their work is also different, so it’s very difficult to have contact with them.”

“Can I say that you don’t know most of the people in the company? Especially the people from other departments other than the general affairs department?”

“Yes.”

Jeanne nodded slightly. “Okay, I got it.”

Amy was a little confused by the question.

Jeanne said, “Call Forrest Jackson in for me. He’s not a supervisor, so he shouldn’t be in the meeting.”

“Okay, I’ll call him right away,” Amy said quickly.

Soon, a man about 35 years old appeared at the door of Jeanne’s office and knocked on the door. “Director Lawrence, you’re looking for me.”

“You don’t have to call me Director Lawrence. You should’ve heard that I wasn’t appointed. You can call me Team Leader Lawrence.”

“Team Leader Lawrence.”

“Sit.” Jeanne let Forrest sit in front of her.

“May I know why you’re looking for me?”

“I’ve seen your resume in the enterprise.” Jeanne pulled out a sheet of information from the thick pile and placed it in front of Forrest.

Forrest took a look and sneered. “A new broom sweeps clean. If you want to fire me, then fire me. Anyway, I’ve had enough of staying in such a company where I can’t see the future.”

Jeanne did not seem to hear what he said and said straightforwardly, “You’ve been in the company for ten years. In the first seven years, you were excellent and even served as the supervisor of the channel development department, but you started to decline in the eighth year. From last year to this year, your monthly performances were only passing. I just want to ask what made you decline like this?”

“Are you mocking me, Team Leader Lawrence?” Forrest did not look too good.

“No, I just want to know whether it’s because of your personal reasons, the company’s system, or because of someone in the company that has led to your lack of enthusiasm for work.” Jeanne looked at him, “Don’t worry, I don’t have any intention of firing you, nor do I have any intention of looking down on you. In my opinion, you’re a talent and shouldn’t be buried just like that.”

“Since you put it so nicely, I’ll tell you frankly. I’m especially dissatisfied with the Lawrence Enterprise. Other than being dissatisfied with the enterprise’s unchanging attitude and lack of responsibility, I’m also extremely dissatisfied with the deputy director, who’s your younger brother. I just don’t understand how such an incompetent person can be so arrogant and bossy in the company. You’re right. My monthly performances from last year to this year were all thanks to your younger brother.”

‘As expected.’

Jeanne smiled faintly. It was just as she had expected.

“You must be curious why I didn’t resign, right?” Forrest said to Jeanne, “To put it in another way, why should I resign? I dedicated my youth to the Lawrence Enterprise. I feel sorry for myself for leaving just like that. Of course, you can fire me and compensate me with a high amount of pension. I’ll gladly accept it and leave immediately.”

“How can there be such a good thing in this world? How can you leave just because you want to?”

Forrest did not look good.

“Not only can you not leave, but you must also stay and become one of my project members.” Jeanne was serious, then she smiled. “Congratulations, you’ve become the first member of my project team.”

Forrest frowned as if he did not know what Jeanne was thinking.

“Joshua and I don’t get along,” Jeanne suddenly explained.

Forrest was a little surprised.

“Are you curious about why I would tell you so directly? However, if you really know my family, you’d know that Joshua and I are extremely at odds, so the person who has a grudge against him is the person I can trust the most. Right now, you’re the only person among so many people that I can be sure of this, and I need you to help me pick out nine people I can trust,” Jeanne enunciated each word.

There was no chance for Forrest to refuse.
