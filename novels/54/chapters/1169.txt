Chester had always had a good relationship with Stacey. After all, she was his youngest sister. Hence, there was no competition between them, and they had a certain level of affection for each other. Now that he was seeing her on her last breath and feeling his father’s indifference, he naturally felt a little upset.

The atmosphere was a little tense.

The guard who had just left the bathroom ceiling came back and reported, “Leader, the ceiling leads to the back garden of the tea room. Mr. Gates should have left from there!”

“Go and find him!” Warren was furious.

Never did he expect that William would slip away from right under his nose, and he definitely could not let that happen.

“Leader.”

At that moment, the staff member who was in charge of the DNA testing appeared in the hall.

“Are the results out yet?” Warren asked coldly.

“It’s out. We’ve run a DNA test on everyone, and Mr. William’s DNA is a complete match with the sample you gave us,” the staff member reported.

Upon hearing the result, Warren, who was sitting on a mahogany chair in the hall, kicked the coffee table in front of him, and it flipped it over!

Everyone was so frightened that they did not even dare to breathe loudly.

After confirming William’s identity, Warren was furious. He had never thought that it would be William!

It was all his fault!

To think that he trusted William so much and did not hide anything from the latter. He even thought that he could borrow some of William’s power abroad, as well as the wealth William had, to help him take down the remaining Duncans Little did he know that he had been used and schemed against by William the entire time!

He gritted his teeth and could not control his anger.

Suddenly, his eyes narrowed, and he looked at the antique vase in the hall. The vase was a gift from William.

At that moment, it was ironic to put it there!

He stepped forward and grabbed it before smashing it on the ground madly.

A loud noise sounded, and the atmosphere in the hall was so oppressive that no one dared to even breathe.

“Once we catch William, I’ll definitely tear his corpse into ten thousand pieces!” Warren said fiercely.

It was not just about his identity as a descendant of the Duncans, but it was also because William had played him like a fool.

In order to let William quickly gain a foothold in Harken, he had even used his identity to introduce her to many of the Sanders’ officials. Now, who knew how many officials and politicians William had already hooked up with in secret! How much had he been scheming against him in secret?

He thought about how he had shot himself in the foot. In fact, if not for Jeanne’s reminder, he would have continued to help William develop a career in his regime and even tried to make him the next Michael. After all, with Michael’s departure, he would have to nurture another talent. He had always thought highly of William, thinking that he could become the minister who would support the Sanders!

He did not expect himself to have long fallen into William’s trap and be used! Not only that, but William was even benefitting from using him.

What a disgrace!

To Warren, it was a great humiliation to be schemed against to that extent!

At that moment, he really felt as if his vision had turned black. He was so angry that he almost fainted.

He wished that he could peel off William’s skin and eat his flesh; he wished he could chop William into minced meat.

However, he did not have an outlet to release his anger!

“Have you found him?” Warren lost his patience and suddenly shouted.

He rushed to the hall and asked fiercely.

A few guards at the door who were in charge of reporting hurriedly came in. “Leader, we’re still searching! According to the news from the front, no one has left the Sanders’ residence so far, so they must still be here. If we send more people to search for them carefully, we will definitely find them.”

“Cut the cr*p. Hurry up and find it for me!” Warren flew into a rage.

“Yes.” The guards quickly left.

After a short while, a group of doctors rushed to the main hall.

Everyone was respectful toward Warren.

“Go and see how my daughter is doing!” Warren suppressed his anger and ordered.

“Yes.” The doctor hurried over.

A few doctors quickly took out their medical equipment and started to treat Stacey.

The atmosphere in the hall was still tense.

Jeanne looked at the time in the hall. Half an hour had passed since William left, yet the men still had not found them.

Why did she find it a little strange? No matter how she looked at it, she felt that something was amiss.

She took the initiative to walk to Warren’s side. “Father, I want to go out and take a look.”
