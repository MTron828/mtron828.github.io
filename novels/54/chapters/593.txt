Chapter 594: Jonathan’s Fate, The Cold-blooded Lawrence Family

She really could not treat him as a good person, so she could not be grateful to him.

As soon as he hung up the call, Jeanne returned to the interview room, and the interviews lasted a whole day.

After interviewing 100 people seriously, the interviewer summarized the interview scores and decided on the final five names.

One of them was Mason.

When he confirmed Quinn, the interviewer still had some objections. “Are you sure you want to use her?”

“Can we go back on our word?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

The interviewer wanted to say something, but Jeanne interrupted him. “Since we don’t have a choice, there’s no point struggling over it.”

Upon hearing what Jeanne said, all the interviewers shut up.

Jeanne was not one to drag her feet. She ordered, “Announce the successful candidates for this interview. They are required to complete the onboarding procedures by tomorrow and officially start work next Monday.”

“Yes.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“The meeting is adjourned.” With that, Jeanne stood up and left.

By the time she returned to her office, it was already past the end of the working day.

She stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window in her office and looked at Harken, lit up by bright lights.

In fact, it had been a long time since she took in her surroundings and enjoyed the view. Sometimes, she felt she was living in a state of numbness, living to fulfill her purpose only.

Suddenly, she looked at the phone on her desk that was ringing and walked over unhurriedly.

She thought it would be Edward.

After all, he had called her almost every day over the last few days he was away. He would, without fail, call her when she returned home late.

Since she would be home late again today, she thought he had come to “question” her.

However, it was not Edward but Alexander.

Jeanne picked up the phone and heard Alexander roaring, “Jeanne, are you crazy? How can you let Quinn, the second princess of the Sanders, join our company? What on earth are you thinking? If you want to suck up to Quinn so shamelessly, what right do you have to use our Lawrence Enterprise as a scapegoat? Why didn’t you ask my opinion before making such a decision? Do you think that you can fool everyone just because of your power in Lawrence Enterprise?”

Alexander’s voice reverberated from the other end of the phone.

Jeanne really did not want to explain it to Alexander. She felt nothing other than disgust for him.

Moreover, letting Quinn into the company was indeed her personal decision, so she did not have much reason. Since there was no reason, she just chose to ignore it.

She hung up the phone and could imagine how furious Alexander was, but she could not care less about him.

Then, she took out a cigarette and took a drag on it.

Actually, nothing much went on today. She just suddenly felt a little emotional and wanted to be alone.

After all, Kingsley’s actions were becoming more and more radical, which meant that more and more things were going to happen.

She, too, felt a little uneasy about that.

Suddenly, the phone rang again.

Jeanne looked at the incoming call, but it was not Edward. This time, it was Jonathan.

He must have thought her decision was wrong, so he had come to question her.

She took a deep breath. At the thought that Jonathan would not be alive for long, she decided she could be a little nicer to him.

Her tone was gentle. “Grandpa.”

“What’s going on with Quinn?” Jonathan asked.

“I can’t refuse, but of course, I have my reasons.”

Jonathan frowned.

Just as Jeanne was going to explain her reasoning, she heard him say, “Come back home. I want to hear your reasons.”

Jeanne agreed immediately. “Okay.”

Once she hung up the phone, she put out her cigarette and tidied her things before picking up her bag and leaving.

Somehow, she felt a strange knot in her heart.

By right, Edward should have called her by now.

Jeanne sat in Miles’s car while Miles drove her to the Lawrence family’s manor.

Jeanne had a lot on her mind.

Miles looked at her through the rearview mirror and said, “I heard you met K01.”

Jeanne came back to her senses. “Yes. I didn’t expect Kingsley to send him here.”

“Mr. Thorn also sent many of his capable assassins here,” Miles said sincerely. “He actually treats you very well.”

“No, he’s just afraid that the mission will fail.”

Miles was not a talkative person, to begin with.

Even if he did not agree with Jeanne’s point of view, he chose to remain silent after being refuted.

The car stopped at the Lawrence family’s manor.

When Jeanne went in, all the Lawrences were there.

Alexander looked at Jeanne walking in with an extremely ugly expression.

Just as Alexander was about to throw a fit at Jeanne, she had already walked to the second floor, not giving Alexander the chance to lash out at her.
