1173 A Turn of Events

Edward and William were surrounded by the Sanders.

Warren was overjoyed. He could not hide his joy and even laughed out loud.

All this time, the words “Duncans’ descendant” were stuck in his throat, but finally, he could get the person today.

He was so happy that he forgot himself. At that moment, he even forgot that he was the leader of a country. He did not care about his children or his subordinates’ presence and released all his emotions.

He said, “Are you still going to run now?!”

Where else could they run to?

Edward looked coldly at Warren’s smug and overly excited expression.

“You’ve been hiding by my side for so long. Do you really think you can hide it from me?! He’s too bold!” Warren’s voice sounded more and more furious.

All the grievances he felt before seemed to be released at that moment. Finally, he could vent his anger.

When he did not get any response from them, he sneered at Edward and William, “Do you regret it?”

He just wanted to show off his ability and be smug for a little longer now that everything had settled.

He was also eager to see Edward and William, the so-called descendant of the Duncans, in a sorry state in front of him.

At the thought about how he had been fooled by those two people, he really wanted to torture them to death.

“Do you regret sending yourself to me and courting your own death?!” Warren was so amused by himself that he could not shake himself out of it.

At that moment, he was mocking their defeat, at how stupid they both and the Duncans were.

“That’s true,” Warren said deliberately with a triumphant smile. “All of this is thanks to Jeanne. If Jeanne had not planned everything and guessed that you both were hiding here, I would’ve been fooled by the two of you tonight! Jeanne, you’re a great contributor to the family. In the future, you can do whatever you want in the family! Your authority is only below mine, and everyone else has to be respectful to you!”

Finding Warren’s words difficult to swallow, Chester clenched his fists, trying to suppress his anger.

“Jeannie, I promised you that I would reward you if you capture the descendant of the Duncans. Now, tell me. What do you want? I’ll satisfy you!” Warren held Jeanne’s hand tightly in his.

It was a display of his love for her.

Jeanne turned to look at Warren before slowly turning to look at Edward, who had no way out.

When their eyes met, Edward asked her, “Did you design all of this?”

Jeanne nodded.

“You discovered William’s identity long ago?” Edward raised his eyebrows. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“No, I didn’t. It was just speculation.” Jeanne said, “I didn’t think he was really one. I just thought that we should check the people around us. I didn’t expect... that after spending so much effort to find this person, he would be so close to us.”

Edward’s throat moved as if he was suppressing his emotions.

“Edward.” Jeanne made it clear to him by saying, “I’m a member of the Sanders, and I will only do things for the Sanders. If there’s a conflict with the Sanders, I’ll only stand on their side.”

Edward looked at her coldly.

The two of them had been separated so many times, and she had used him so many times, but that was the first time Edward’s gaze was like a knife, cutting through her.

However, she just ignored him.

“Father.” Jeanne immediately shifted her gaze.

“Go ahead.” Warren’s smile was still on his face.

“I want to kill Edward with my own hands.” Jeanne went straight to the point.

Warren was stunned.

“It’s because he killed Kingsley, and I want to avenge Kingsley,” Jeanne said cruelly.

“Alright.” Warren agreed.

The next second, Warren told the guards to hand Jeanne a gun, a black one.

What he meant was that she should kill Edward now.

Jeanne held the heavy gun, and she walked toward Edward, step by step.

Standing not too far away from Edward, Jeanne said, “I’ll give birth to the child.”

Edward looked at her coldly.

“I will raise both of them.” That was her last promise to him.

However, Edward did not respond. Instead, he just kept looking at her as if he wanted to remember how cruel she was.

Jeanne thought, ‘So be it.’
