Chapter 349: Madam, Missus, Wifey, or Jeannie?

“Good night,” Jeanne said and left.

The moment she left, George suddenly called out to her, “Mom.”

“Hm?”

“You won’t leave me behind again, right?”

It seemed like he was now traumatized.

She said, “Of course.”

No matter who she left behind, it would never be him.

With that, Jeanne closed the door.

It was getting late. Although she had slept all day and was not sleepy, she should return to the room.

When she was at the door to Edward’s room, she still felt a little unsettled.

However, she gritted her teeth and pushed open the door, only to see that Edward had returned to the room. He had even showered and was lying on the huge bed, reading a book.

Jeanne frowned. ‘Wasn’t he watching TV downstairs?’

Now, they were in a closed room again…

......

She quietly composed herself and walked straight into the bathroom.

Edward looked at Jeanne, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a faint smile.

She did not take too long in the shower today, probably because she did not feel as conflicted as she was last night.

She came out wearing a set of reserved pajamas, climbed into Edward’s bed, and sat beside him. They were not too far away from each other.

Edward glanced at her as she took out her phone and started going through some of the messages on it.

Then, he turned around and focused his attention back on the book.

Suddenly, the two of them looked like an old couple who had lived together for many years. The scene looked very harmonious.

Jeanne was not sleepy and did not want to disturb Edward’s reading. That was why she sat beside him and looked at her phone.

There were some messages from her project team staff congratulating her.

She replied “thank you” to them one by one.

After that, she opened the news app.

She had not looked at her phone since yesterday, so she did not know how big of a thing Edward and her wedding was.

Her eyes moved when she saw the headline, [Rows of Cars Filled With Flowers — Jeannie, My Heart!]

The big headline was obviously about their wedding.

She took a deep breath, adjusted her somewhat uncontrollable emotions, and clicked open the content, which was a detailed description of the wedding.

Her eyes were fixed on the spectacular scenery of the vehicles outside her house to pick her up. Seeing an aerial photo of it, it really did take her aback. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It turned out that was what Monica meant when she said “rows of cars filled with flowers”.

Edward had really done so much for her.

At that moment, she saw hundreds of thousands of comments below, all of them filled with the words “jealousy”, “envy”, and “hate”.

From what she experienced yesterday, she could tell that the wedding was grand. However, when she saw a picture of the rows of cars filled with flowers, she was shocked again!

Her eyes were fixed on the screen. For a long time, she was so immersed in her own world that she did not even notice the man beside her was staring straight at her.

Not until…

“Is the news better looking than me?” The sudden male voice startled Jeanne.

Instinctively, Jeanne closed the news app.

“You’ve been staring at it for ten minutes now.” A certain someone sounded dissatisfied.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Edward said, “Are you touched?”

Jeanne looked up.

Some people really were very arrogant.

She said, “No, I was calculating how much money you used.”

Speechless, Edward’s mouth twitched.

“If it were money, I might have liked it more,” Jeanne said on purpose.

“I see.” Edward nodded as if he finally understood something.

Then, he turned around and extended his long arm to the drawer beside the bed.

Jeanne frowned.

At that moment, she saw Edward take a document out from the drawer before handing it to her.

Jeanne looked at him.

In the end, she took it and opened the folder. When she saw “The Original Shares Transfer of the Swan Enterprise”, her heart skipped a beat.

The wedding gift that Edward mentioned earlier… She had forgotten all about it, and she did not want it at all.

“Look at the content first and then sign it.” As Edward said that, he gave her a pen.

Jeanne pursed her lips and focused her attention on the document.

She thought the shares would come with lots of terms on it. However, there was none.

It was an unconditional transfer.

It even stated clearly that once the shares were transferred, they would be exclusive to Jeanne and would not be included in the marital assets.

It meant that if they were divorced, that eight percent of the original shares would still be hers.

She stared at Edward.

“Is there a problem?” Edward asked.

“Aren’t you afraid that I will abscond with the money?” Jeanne was very serious.

“I’m not,” Edward said straightforwardly.

Jeanne frowned.

“I’m sure you won’t be able to escape.”

“I’m... more powerful than you think,” Jeanne reminded.

“I know.” Edward nodded.

If he knew, why would he still give her the shares unconditionally?

“I know you will fall in love with me,” Edward added.

Jeanne looked at him.

“Sooner or later.”

She did not refute because she could not.

As Jeanne took the pen from Edward’s hand, she said, “Sometimes, feelings are worthless.”

Yes. In the face of benefits, feelings were worthless, and that was why she accepted Edward’s gift.

Edward looked at her and watched as she signed her name.

Just like that, the transfer was effective.

After signing it, the two of them went to sleep, with some distance between them.

Their backs were facing each other at first, but Jeanne suddenly turned around toward Edward.

She stared at his broad back.

In the dark night sky, she felt that he looked lonely…

Her small hands tugged on his pajamas.

A certain person’s body moved.

“I want to thank you.”

Edward did not move.

“I don’t think I can ever repay you with all those shares.”

Hence, she wanted to give herself to him in return.

Edward turned around and looked at her.

He said, “If I knew this would happen, I would have taken out the document last night.”

If so, she would not have rejected him, right?

As he leaned closer to her body, she was clearly a little nervous.

He said, “But, more than anything, I hope you would repay me with your... love.”

Jeanne was stunned.

After that, the man hugging her was still.

Very late at night, before Jeanne felt sleepy, she muttered, “Was it not enough last night?”

A certain someone was at a loss for words.

Then, they went at it all night.
