Chapter 495: Jasmine’s Tragic Downfall

Eden clenched his teeth and his fists tightly. Since it was related to his dignity as a man, he definitely could not live with himself if word got out.

“There’s no reason for you to divorce Jasmine. Now that you’ve been kicked out of Swan Enterprise, if news of your divorce spreads, do you want to make it so that you won’t be able to get back up on your feet for the rest of your life?” Henry asked fiercely.

“In that case, should I keep this woman with me? Dad, if it were you, would you tolerate it?” Eden asked.

“As I said, keeping her alive is worse than killing her! There are many ways to take revenge on her. There’s no need for you to lose your reputation.” Henry said through gritted teeth, “I won’t let you tolerate it either, but just don’t act rashly until you find a more reasonable reason.”

Eden gritted his teeth in anger, but he still listened to his father’s opinion.

Right now, a divorce would do more harm than good, and he could not mess up the big plan because of something trivial.

“I believe your grandfather won’t be so indifferent to you. Although he has been on Edward’s side today, at least after learning what Jasmine did, he didn’t say or do anything. In the end, he’s my father and your grandfather. There’s always a way to turn things around,” Henry comforted Eden.

“Okay.” Eden nodded.

He had known since he was young that being born into such a family meant he had to be patient.

“I’m also very pissed off today.” Henry said angrily, “I will now go back to my room to rest.”

Belle was also tired after being tortured for half a day, so she scolded Jasmine fiercely, “B*tch.”

Then, she followed Henry back to her room.

In the hall, only Eden and Jasmine were left.

......

However, Jasmine was laying on the ground, on the verge of death.

Eden really wanted to kill that woman, but he suppressed his anger and turned to the servant. “Wayne, throw her into the confinement room for me.”

“Yes, Eldest Young Master.”

“You can fool around with her as well,” Eden added.

Wayne was dumbfounded.

“As long as you don’t kill her.” After that, Eden left without looking at Jasmine again.

The remaining servants, Wayne and Jeff, looked at each other.

In the end, the two of them dragged Jasmine to the confinement room.

When Wayne was about to leave, Jeff asked excitedly, “Wayne, the Eldest Young Master said we could fool around with her. Does that mean–”

“Are you crazy? She’s the Eldest Young Mistress, after all,” Wayne berated.

“For the Eldest Young Master to beat her to such a state, she must have provoked him. He might be eager for us to torture her!”

“We are still servants, after all. Do your duty and leave!” Wayne ordered.

“I’m not leaving. I’ve been wanting to sleep with this woman for a long time. I serve the Eldest Young Master and hear the cries of this woman in bed from time to time. I don’t care. Anyway, the Eldest Young Master just said...” As Jeff said that, he took off his pants and went over.

Wayne wanted to stop him, but when he thought of what the Eldest Young Master just said, he fell silent again.

A burst of heart-wrenching and miserable cries came from the confinement room.

…

In Bamboo Garden, Jeanne and Edward had returned.

The two of them sat on the sofa in silence. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

At that moment, George was also in the living room, sitting beside Jeanne.

In fact, he had also discovered something, but his calmness did not match his age. He did not ask a single question.

The atmosphere in the room was somewhat tense.

Suddenly, Jeanne took a deep breath and looked at George. “Edward is your father.”

George still could not quite accept it, so he stared at Jeanne with his eyes wide open and did not look at Edward.

Edward was sitting at the side. At that moment, he felt restless, but he moved a little, making himself look calm.

“Didn’t you say that my father is dead?” George questioned.

“Isn’t he a living corpse?” Jeanne smiled.

Edward was speechless.

Teddy, at the side, also wanted to laugh.

Jeanne said, “Aren’t you afraid of becoming an orphan? Now that you have a biological father and mother, you won’t become an orphan in the future, no?”

“That’s true, but the problem is, I don’t like this biological father.” George was merciless.

A certain someone’s heart was stabbed.

Teddy could not help but chuckle. He never thought that his high and mighty master would also be disliked one day.

The moment Edward glanced at Teddy, he immediately became serious.

“He’s actually pretty good.” Jeanne comforted George.

Only then did George raise his little face and look at Edward.

“For example, he’s rich, powerful, handsome, and has a good figure.”

“I’m not choosing a husband.” George really had a way with words.

Jeanne was embarrassed.

Teddy could not help but burst out laughing, and this time, Edward joined in.

After all, being praised by others was also a very pleasant feeling.

“You can choose your husband, but you can’t with your dad,” he said.
