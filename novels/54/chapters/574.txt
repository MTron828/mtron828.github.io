Chapter 575: Don’t Show Up in Front of Me, I Think You’re Disgusting

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jonathan was only trying to persuade Alexander to accept Jeanne. His goal was to use Jeanne to develop Lawrence Enterprise to greater heights.

However, to Alexander, it sounded like Jonathan wanted Jeanne to manage the entire Lawrence Enterprise.

Once Jeanne was a little more capable, Jonathan might hand Lawrence Enterprise over to Jeanne.

Even if Alexander did not want to admit it, he had to say Jeanne was much more capable than he and Joshua combined.

Moreover, he knew very well how much his father valued Lawrence Enterprise, the family business that had been passed down for generations.

Jonathan could be ruthless toward Jeanne’s mother because Jeanne’s mother did not have blood relations with the Lawrences. If Jeanne’s mother were to take control of Lawrence Enterprise, Jonathan would definitely not be able to accept that the Lawrences had fallen into the hands of an outsider. Hence, when Jeanne’s mother was at her peak managing Lawrence Enterprise, he used an extreme method to end Jeanne’s mother’s life, allowing Lawrence Enterprise to return to the family’s control.

Moreover, Jeanne’s mother’s domineering attitude back then was an insult to Jonathan in the company. As Jonathan disliked Jeanne’s mother, it made him dislike Jeanne even more. After all, Jeanne was still young back then and had not shown her outstanding abilities, so Jonathan did not discover how brilliant Jeanne was.

However, things were completely different now.

Everyone could see how capable Jeanne was, and it was only natural that Jonathan viewed Jeanne in a different light. Furthermore, Jeanne was still a Lawrence, so Jonathan could hand the company over to Jeanne because he valued her so much.

When Alexander thought of that, he became even more uneasy.

However, in front of Jonathan, he did not dare to refute his father. It was as if he had become a boy again, and he did not say a word.

As such, Jonathan thought Alexander did not think much about it. Moreover, he had always found Alexander to be obedient to him, so there was no need for him to explain too much.

In any case, he was only using Jeanne, and in the end, he would hand over everything in the Lawrences to Alexander and Joshua. It was just that, over the next few years, he would use Jeanne to help develop the company a little more. Once the Lawrences rose to another level, Jeanne would be useless.

Then, all he had to do was be a little extreme in his methods and make Jeanne follow in her mother’s footsteps.

In fact, Jonathan had told Alexander about his thoughts many times in the past and thought Alexander understood him.

At that moment, he did not want to go on about it anymore. “You don’t have to care about anything else. Just follow my arrangements.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Alexander wanted to say something, but seeing Jonathan’s impatient expression, he held his tongue and did not say anything else.

“I’ll head back to my room.”

Jonathan nodded.

After Alexander left, his expression turned unsightly as he returned to his room.

Jenifer was also filled with anger. At the thought of how Jeanne had wronged her today, she was furious.

However, seeing that Alexander had returned, she could only suppress her emotions and try to please him.

“Alexander, what did you say to Dad? What are his thoughts toward Jeanne now?” Jenifer asked anxiously.

Alexander glanced at Jenifer. “What else? He wants us to go along with whatever Jeanne says!”

“Has he really accepted Jeanne?”

“Jeanne is a Lawrence, after all. Since she is capable, my dad will naturally accept her. What’s so strange about that?” Alexander vented all his anger on Jenifer.

“That’s not what I meant.” Jenifer quickly explained, “What I meant was, what about Joshua’s future?”

“Let’s not talk about Joshua. I don’t even know what to do about him!” Alexander said furiously

“Will Jeanne take charge of the family in the future?” Jenifer deliberately fanned the flames. “Do we all have to lower our heads to her in the future?”

“She’s not brave enough to make me bow down to her yet!” Alexander flew into a rage.

Jenifer looked at him. “Seeing Jeanne acting so arrogantly today, it seems like all of us will have to listen to her one day. Everything else is fine, and I don’t mind suffering a little in front of Jeanne. However, if father gave the company to Jeanne, I’m afraid we will be chased out of the family in the end.”

“How dare she?”

“What’s there for her to be afraid of?” Jenifer sighed, “When has Jeanne ever shown us respect?”
