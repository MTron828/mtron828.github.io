Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Besides, Bella was sick, and she was in a hurry to go back.

“Shelly, don’t be so ungrateful!” Nox could not stand it anymore.

He felt that Shelly had no conscience at all. His mother had done everything for Shelly’s sake, yet Shelly treated his mother like that. He really wanted to strangle that woman to death.

“1 don’t know what’s good for me, so don’t try to curry favor with me anymore. I don’t think you’re good to me at all. In fact, I think you’re emotionally blackmailing me! ”

“Shelly, when did you become like this?” Mrs. Winter still could not accept Shelly’s drastic change.

Even when Shelly left, Shelly was respectful to her and would never say such harsh words. She had always thought that Shelly was a good child, so she had expectations for her.

“I’ve always been like this. All the obedience I show in front of you was just an act.”

Mrs. Winter was really hurt by Shelly. To her, she was really doing it for Shelly’s own good, yet Shelly was treating her like that.

Shelly could tell that Mrs. Winter was disappointed in her. She said, “I’m sorry for making you feel bad. I’ll try my best not to appear in front of you in the future. I also hope that you won’t take the initiative to look for me again. My life is quite good now, so you don’t have to worry. I’ll be leaving first.”

As she spoke, she nodded at them with a smile. After working as a waiter for a long time, she had learned to be respectful to others. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Shelly!” Nox gritted his teeth.

He felt disgusted by the current Shelly, who made him very unhappy. It was as if she really did not want to have anything to do with the Winters anymore. What did the Winters do wrong to her that she had to make such a gesture?

“Forget it, Nox.” Mrs. Winter did not seem to want to dwell on Shelly’s matter anymore. Since that was Shelly’s choice, she would fulfill it.

Nox gritted his teeth.

“Let’s go back.” Mrs. Winter left with the support of someone else.

The others followed Mrs. Winter. Nox, on the other hand, looked at Shelly coldly. In the end, he turned around and left.

As the group of people walked further and further away from Shelly, tears started to flow out of her eyes. This time, she had probably broken the hearts of the Winters. Nevertheless, she wiped her tears. After all, she could no longer go back to the Winters after she lost her relationship with Nox.

They said she could be their daughter, but could she really be their daughter? Her existence in their family would be awkward. Nox would not like her, Nox’s wife would also hate her, and the elders of the Winters felt guilty about her. Everything about it would just hurt her.

With that, Shelly turned around, hailed a taxi, and went back. She wondered whether Nox would think that she wanted to marry him again in the future! However, Zoe should have believed her too.

Now, she had finally gotten rid of Nox, the huge pain in her *ss!

Nox first sent Zoe’s parents back before returning to the Winters’ residence and going straight to his mother’s room.

Mrs. Winter was pretty sad today. After coming back to take a shower, she lay on the bed and planned to get some rest, only to look at her son in surprise.

“Why are you back here today?”

Nox rarely came back because he always felt that he would be disciplined once he came back, so he would rather not come back. However, he was back tonight because… Yes, it was because of Shelly’s matter.

He had a feeling that his mother was hiding a lot about Shelly, and Shelly’s current behavior had a lot to do with what she had experienced.

“Mom, I want to ask about what happened to Shelly back then. I still find it strange as to why Shelly stopped studying and had a daughter!” Nox did not beat around the bush and asked directly, “Also, she wanted to return to the Winters but was rejected by you?”

Mrs. Winter sighed. It had been such a long time, and she did not want to talk about it anymore.

Now that Nox asked, she hesitated for a moment before saying, “Shelly’s daughter isn’t Shelly’s but Shelly’s biological sister’s. Because her daughter is disabled, her biological sister abandoned her and gave her to Shelly. Shelly, as innocent as she was, decided to raise the child and stopped going to school, so she went to work at a young age to raise the child. After that, Shelly probably couldn’t hold on anymore, so she came to me, saying that she wanted to come back to the Winters with the child.”

Nox frowned..
