1382 Getting Along and George’s Rejection

The charity banquet that she held previously was to let everyone know about her so that her wedding with Edward would not be too abrupt. It was not to pave the way for her in the business world. The business world would be left to Chloe in the end. After all, it was the business of her mother’s family, the Moores. Claire had always doted on Chloe, so it was impossible for Claire to leave the business world to her.

“That’s great,” Paige cheered.

Candice smiled. Looking at how happy Paige was, she felt that it would not be too difficult to live with that little cutie. On the contrary, she was looking forward to it.

“Can we go back to the room and sleep now?” Edward asked.

“Sure, but I want Mommy to bathe me. I don’t want Paula to bathe me.” Paige made a request.

Paula was a nanny who had accompanied Paige and taken care of him since she was young.

It was said that she had been taking care of Paige since the latter was born and had always abided by her duties. Other than taking care of Paige, she did not have much of a presence in their lives.

“Alright.” Before Edward could reply, Candice agreed and picked Paige up from the ground.

Paige giggled brightly. She kept saying, “I love Mommy. I love Mommy the most.”

What kind of fate was it that made her and Paige hit it off so well?

Candice carried Paige upstairs.

“Mom, aren’t you pregnant? I thought you couldn’t carry me?” Paige’s face was filled with worry.

Candice smiled. “It takes a long time to get pregnant.”

“How long?” Paige asked seriously.

“A long time.” Even Candice did not know how long it would take.

Some people could conceive overnight, but some might not even conceive for a year or two. Hence, she could not give Paige an accurate time.

“Is two days okay?” Paige asked.

She looked very serious. It was as if she was saying, ‘If one day isn’t enough, two days should be enough.’

Amused by Paige, Candice said, “It’s not a matter of one or two days–”

“Three days.” Paige said loudly, “Three days and no more.”

Candice was really blown away by little Paige’s adorable expression. It was obvious that the little one had no patience to wait any longer.

Therefore, she said, “Can’t you give Mommy a chance to spend more time with you?”

Paige blinked at Candice. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“With a sister, you’ll definitely like to play with her more, but I want to play with you too.” Candice tricked him.

It was obvious that Paige had fallen for it.

“So, can you spend more time with Mommy first and then have a sister after a while?”

“Are you jealous, Mommy?” Paige asked.

What did a three-year-old know about jealousy?

“Yes, I am.” Candice smiled.

“Well… Okay.” Paige agreed with much difficulty. “In that case, I don’t want a sister for now. I’ll play with Mommy first.”

“Okay.” Candice kissed Paige on the cheek.

She just could not help but kiss and be intimate with Paige, who hugged her back tightly. Then, the two of them walked into her and Edward’s bedroom and went to take a shower.

They were in a huge bathtub together. Children were naturally fond of bubbles, and Paige was playing with bubbles in the bathtub. Her little face was flushed red, and she was extremely cute.

“Mommy.” After playing for a while, Paige suddenly looked at Candice’s body and asked in surprise, “Why are you red and purple here?”

Candice blushed. How was she going to explain the marks on her body?

It was the marks… Edward left behind last night. If she had known earlier, she would not have taken a bath with Paige.

However, there was just something that made her want to get close to Paige.

“Did someone hit you, Mommy?” Paige’s eyes turned red.

The next second, she burst into tears and was crying heart-wrenchingly.

Candice panicked. She finally understood that a child’s mood could change easily with little things. One moment, everything was fine, and the skies were blue; then, a storm suddenly hit…

The bathroom door was pushed open. Edward had clearly heard Paige’s cries and rushed in. When Paige saw her father arrive, she quickly climbed out of the bathtub.

Candice was originally planning to comfort Paige. However, with Paige gone, she was left… naked.

She wanted to coax Paige, but she was naked.
