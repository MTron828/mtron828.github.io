Chapter 1717: The Conflict Between Shelly and Nox Broke Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly quickly closed the door to the room. She knew that sooner or later, Nox would revert to his old self. In fact, it might not take long before his patience with her would run out as well.

Shelly spent a long time in the room calming Bella down before letting her watch TV in the room while she left. However, when she left the room, Nox was no longer home. Seeing that the chair in the dining room was still overturned, she went over to lift the chair, reheated the cold food, and fed Bella. She also ate a little.

By 9 p.m., she had put Bella to bed, and Nox was not back yet. Instead of thinking of calling Nox, Shelly washed up and then went back to the room to sleep.

She roughly understood why Nox was so indifferent to her back then. Whatever he did not like, he would be indifferent to, and since she did not like Nox, she did not care about him.

Yet, that night, she could not fall asleep. It could be because it had been a long time since Nox had not been so angry, and she felt troubled by it. After all, it was her fault, and she was still afraid after being traumatized the last time.

At 1 a.m., Shelly could hear that Nox was back when he pushed the door open a little too hard. As soon as he came in, he made a clattering sound, probably bumping into things here and there. Shelly smelled a strong smell of alcohol from him and instantly knew that Nox was drunk.

Drunk, he went straight to the bathroom, then came the gut-wrenching sound of vomiting. Shelly hesitated momentarily but still got up to pour a glass of water for Nox and placed it in front of him. Nox felt like he was throwing up everything in his system.

Seeing the glass of water in front of him, Nox hesitated for a moment but took it and took a sip in the end.

“Are you feeling better?” Shelly asked.

“Are you concerned about me?” Nox asked.

“No,” Shelly replied. “I just don’t want you to make too much noise.”

“Why aren’t you pretending anymore?” Nox sat on the ground and turned to look at Shelly.

His vision was blurred, but he could see Shelly’s features clearly.

“I’ve never pretended. I’ve never said I care about you or even like you,” Shelly said bluntly. “I’ve thought about it a lot tonight, and I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to continue this relationship. Your mother really wants a grandson, but I can’t help you with that, so why don’t we break up now?”

“Ha!” Nox laughed in a self-deprecating manner. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He chose to drink himself to death rather than come back to provoke her tonight, only to hear the word ‘breakup’ in the end.

“Nox, I don’t know what kind of feelings you have for me or whether you do like me. In any case, I’ve never liked you. In fact, I find you annoying; I feel inexplicably irritable around you, but I have to endure it. I even wish you did not speak to me or show me kindness. I’ll be with you for half a year and use my body to repay you, but that is all.”

Therefore, to Shelly, she was selling her body and was hoping that Nox, her sugar daddy, would not ask her anything or affect her life. Just pure mating would do.

‘When I went to the police station to close Bella’s case, they told me that you almost died in the hands of a criminal gang to save her. Hence, I’m grateful to you, but that’s all. I think we’re dragging each other down by being together, which I’m fine with since I’ve never thought about marrying anyone or having a good future. However, you’re different; you’re the eldest son and heir of the Winters and must carry on your family line. You’re just wasting your time by being with me, so we should break up early.” Shelly was talking to Nox seriously.

Tonight, her insomnia tonight was caused by all the thinking she had done, and she realized that her relationship with Nox was dragging him down. In any case, she still owed the Winters a favor and did not want to be ungrateful.

‘Who said you’re dragging me down?” Nox sneered.

Shelly stared at Nox.

“Do you really think I have to be with you, Shelly? Do you really think I can’t have a child if you don’t have one with me? You think too highly of yourself! I can have a son even without you! There are lots of women outside who are willing to have my child!” Nox’s voice grew louder..
