“Do you like her?” Old Master Winter asked.

Nox was taken aback by the question.

Old Master Winter said again, “If you don’t like her, why are you marrying her?”

“Feelings can be nurtured. Since I have a good impression of her at first sight, we can slowly nurture our relationship after we get married. What’s wrong with that?”

“Nox, marriage is not child’s play.” Old Master Winter was serious. “Since you don’t like her, don’t hurt her.”

“Grandfather, marriage doesn’t necessarily mean love. I am at a certain age now where I would have to start a family and have children. As to whether I like her or not, the marriage would eventually develop kinship. Even if I don’t like her, it won’t be as bad as you think.”

“You can think for yourself.” Old Master Winter did not dwell on the topic. “Anyway, you know yourself the best, and it’s up to you to decide whether you’re happy with your life or not.”

Nox pursed his lips. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You may leave.” Old Master Winter waved his hand.

With that, Nox turned around and left. The moment he left, he could not help but turn back to look at his grandfather, who was breathing heavily and looked especially tired.

He suddenly had the urge to ask, “Grandpa, what kind of person was Grandma?”

From as early as he could remember, he had never seen her grandmother.

Old Master Winter looked at his grandson and said slowly, “The person I love deeply.”

Nox was stunned. He did not expect his grandfather to answer him with that. In fact, he had never thought that his grandfather would reveal his feelings.

After that, he did not ask any more questions. If it were not for love, he did not think his grandfather would remain single for so many years after his grandmother passed away. It seemed like some people could still be happy even though their relationships were broken halfway, but what about him?

Nox left the house at 8:30 a.m. in the morning, and there were many rules that Mrs. Winter reminded him of again and again.

Nox looked at the bouquet of flowers in his hand and watched as the resplendent sunlight shone in through the car window and on his bouquet. It was a sunny day. However, Nox felt gloomy.

The car stopped every now and then until the best man said, “We’re almost there.”

The best man was actually one of the staff. Due to the tight timing, Nox did nothing and left all the planning to the event company.

As Nox listened, he started to reject the idea of getting married. As he watched the car get closer and closer to the venue, he felt more and more repulsed. His grandfather’s words echoed in his mind. If he did not like her, why was he marrying her? At the same time, he was reminded of Jeanne’s words, that he could run away.

Fine. He admitted that he regretted being so impulsive. He should not have agreed to marry someone else just because he lost Shelly. Marriage was not a game, and he should not be hurting himself and others.

Upon realizing that he regretted his decision, he suddenly called out to the driver, “Stop the car!”

The urgency in his voice started the driver, who quickly stepped on the brake to stop. The people in the car were shocked by the sudden brake.

As soon as the car stopped, Nox unbuckled his seatbelt, opened the car door, and ran out.

“Young Master Winter!” the best man called him from behind.

“I’m not getting married anymore!” Nox answered as he ran in front.

The best man was dumbfounded. Was it a joke that the groom was running away while they were on the way to the wedding?

The best man watched as Nox hailed a taxi and left. A long fleet of wedding cars had to stop on the side of the street, and it disrupted the flow of the traffic. The people in the car also got out of the car and watched as Nox disappear in front of them in confusion.

When Nox got into the taxi, he shouted at the driver, “To the airport.” “Sir, what are you doing?” The driver was shocked by Nox.

“Running away from my wedding! Can’t you tell I’m running away?” Nox sounded excited.

“I’ve heard of a runaway bride but never a runaway groom.” The driver sighed.

“Don’t be surprised! Drive faster, or I’ll be finished if I’m caught.” “Oh.” The driver quickly sped up.

Feeling inexplicably excited, Nox called Jeanne. “I ran away.”

Jeanne, who was on her way to the wedding, was at a loss for words.

Beside her, Edward looked at her expression and asked, “What’s wrong?” “Nox called and said that he ran away.”

“Oh.” Edward reacted indifferently as if he had known beforehand.

“Why are you so calm?” Jeanne asked Edward..
