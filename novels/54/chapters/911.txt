912 The Sudden Fire Rescue

Ruby heard Sarah’s voice and quickly turned around to see her niece still in the hall as well. She hurried over, patting the sparks off her body. Gary also took off his suit jacket and did the same.

Finally, the fire on her body was extinguished, but it had taken some time. The fire around her had grown, and the smoke was even more suffocating now.

“Auntie.” Sarah was frightened. She hugged Ruby and cried her heart out. He had never experienced anything like this before. This was the first time she felt despair.

Ruby was afraid too, but to reassure Sarah and Monica, she could only comfort them and say, “Let’s get out quickly.”

The group hurried out, with Gary supporting Ruby while Monica and Sarah held hands. Their footsteps were quick. The air inside was thinning, the smoke was getting thicker, and fire debris kept falling from above.

“Ah!” Monica and Sarah suddenly sat on the ground.

Huge fire debris had fallen from the sky, and they moved back to avoid it, causing the two of them to fall to the ground uncontrollably.

Gary and Ruby had been walking ahead of them. When they heard the sound, they quickly turned around.

“You guys go first!” Monica and Sarah were now blocked by the flames, making it difficult for them to escape.

“Monica!” Gary rushed back to save her without thinking.

Monica said loudly, “Dad, head out with mom first. I can’t leave this way, so I’ll use the other exit. Leave. Quickly!”

“Monica!” Gary went over towards Monica.

“Dad, take mom and leave. We can’t let our family end here like this. I’ll take Xiao Xi out through the other exit. Take good care of mom!” Monica said loudly. She really did not want her father to rush into the fire to save her.

Gary’s eyes watered.

Monica got up from the ground and helped Sarah up. Without giving her parents any chance to hesitate, she ran to the other side.

Both Gary and Ruby’s eyes turned red. Neither of them could accept that their daughter was still in the fire.

“Hurry up and leave!” Just as the two of them were about to rush in, the guards inside discovered Gary and Ruby’s existence and quickly led them out.

“My daughter and niece are still inside. Please save them! I beg you!” Ruby cried when she saw the guards.

Gary also kept saying, “Please go in and save my daughter. She’s still inside. Please save her. We’ll thank you. We’ll thank you…”

However, the security guards were like robots and could not hear their pleas. They just led them coldly out of the banquet hall, with no chance to go back. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Monica and Sarah, who were currently trapped in the wedding banquet hall, struggled with every step. They were surrounded by fire and could not even get to the few exits. The air in the wedding hall was extremely thin, and the smoke was so thick that it had them both choking.

Monica and Sarah were both crawling on the ground. They had even taken off their heels, but because of the fire, the soles of their feet were scalded.

Sarah cried uncontrollably. “Monica, I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die.”

Monica did not want to die either. While she had the courage to commit suicide before, now that she was facing death, she was afraid.

Monica suppressed the fear in her heart and pulled Sarah to a table. She found a bottle of soda and helped Sarah wet her clothes. “Cover your mouth. Don’t breathe in too much smoke.”

Sarah did as she was told, but she could not stop crying.

“Don’t cry. Save your strength. Someone will come and save us.” Monica comforted her.

Though she was half scared to death and just really wanted to cry, Sarah was her sister. In times of real danger, she could only act as an older figure to protect and comfort her.

Sarah looked at Monica eagerly. Monica had no choice but to wet her skirt and cover her mouth and nose with the hem of her skirt. The two of them squatted down due to the sinking air under the fire as Monica calmly observed a way for them to escape.
