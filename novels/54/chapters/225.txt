Chapter 226: Compared to Jeanne, All of You Are No Different From Trash!

When a woman was ruthless, she would do anything!

Joshua was so angry that he gritted his teeth.

Jenifer, on the other hand, heaved a sigh of relief at that moment.

Joshua had only slept with a woman.

It was fine if that was the case. As long as he promised not to do it again and that he did not do anything to harm the interests of the Lawrences, everything was fine.

Jenifer quickly said, “Dad, I’ll teach Joshua a good lesson. I promise he won’t be so reckless in the future! If he dares to do that, I’ll break his legs!”

“Hmph.” Jonathan sneered. “Do you think that’s all he did? Would I be so uptight if that’s the case?! Ask him who the woman is!”

Jenifer felt a knot in her heart.

She knew Jonathan would not be like this just because Joshua was fooling around with a woman.

Jenifer turned her head to look at Joshua.

Joshua did not speak for a long time.

“Joshua!” Jenifer looked very stern.

“Answer!” Jonathan’s face became much colder at this moment.

“It’s Luna.”

“Who exactly is she?!” Jonathan enunciated each word.

“Lunetta Walker, the secretary-general of the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“Finish your sentence!” Jonathan pressed Joshua.

Joshua gritted his teeth. “It’s the person related to the dual contract of the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse.”

Jenifer was shocked.

‘No way…’

She glared at Joshua.

Alexander also sensed something at this moment.

He was furious.

In the end, the instigator of the matter was the son that he had wholeheartedly nurtured!

“However, the matter of the dual contract has nothing to do with me! I was simply seduced by this woman. I didn’t know that she would do those things behind Adrian’s back. I was shocked when I found out. To think that I usually treat her well, but she betrayed me!” Joshua said with righteous indignation. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As expected, Joshua had probably discussed the details with Eden. He spoke so fluently.

If it was not for Jonathan asking Joshua to come back, they might have still been discussing how to make Adrian and the others confess!

Jeanne said unhurriedly, “I heard that you and Adrian have a good relationship. Luna was introduced to you by Adrian.”

“As a Lawrence, I have to manage the enterprise. Of course, I have to have a good relationship with the higher-ups,” Joshua said as if it was a matter of course. At that moment, he even tried to bite back at Jeanne. “Are you deliberately trying to sow discord? You just want to ruin the peace in our family!”

“Joshua. Do you know that you’re being used by others now?” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly.

“What nonsense are you spouting?!”

“I know you’re not the mastermind of the case, but if you refuse to admit it now, you’ll become the scapegoat.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about!” Joshua still refused to admit it.

“On account of our family, I don’t want to pursue this any further. Joshua, are you really trying to make us go to court?!”

“I didn’t do it. You can say whatever you want!”

“Joshua!” Jonathan said coldly, “You’d better think it through clearly. If you did this and were exposed in court, you’ll be going to jail! I can tell you that once you’re convicted, you’ll never be able to return to his family again!”

Joshua was frightened.

Even so, he did not admit it.

Jeanne said, “Joshua, if you can guarantee that you won’t be exposed by Adrian and are confident that he didn’t leave any evidence behind so that you won’t be caught, you can do whatever you want. However, if you’re not so absolute, I advise you to confess what you did. After all, I’ll pursue this matter to the end!”

Jeanne’s words made Joshua’s hair stand on end at that moment.

He had to admit that Jeanne’s ability had caught him off guard.

Joshua did not know if Jeanne would have evidence to accuse him if she continued to investigate the matter.

Moreover, he could not guarantee that Adrian did not leave behind any evidence.

“By the way, let me remind you that Adrian being the mastermind and him being instigated are two different crimes. The former is much more serious! What benefits do you think you can give Adrian so that he can confess?!”

Joshua’s face was pale.

At this moment, he could not say a word.

“You’d better think it over carefully. If you didn’t do it, or if you’re sure that you won’t be accused, you can ignore me today. If not...” Jeanne’s eyes tensed up, “I’ll only give you one chance for Grandpa’s sake. After today, I’ll definitely pursue this matter to the end!”

The words she said were a threat to Joshua.

He started to tremble.

Just before this, he was indeed discussing with Eden how to make Adrian take the blame.

Before they came to a conclusion, he was suddenly called back.

Joshua was not sure that Eden could find a better way. Or rather, he was afraid that their perfect scheme had been seen through by Jeanne. He was worried that even if they found a way, Jeanne would also be able to expose them easily.

The others in the study confirmed the fact due to Joshua’s silence.

At this moment, Jenifer wanted to beat her son to death.

How many times had she told him not to do anything that would harm the Lawrences’ interests?

How could he be so stupid? Could he not tell the severity of the matter?!

“I’m very sleepy. I’ve used a lot of energy on this case. I’ll give you ten seconds to think. Ten, nine, eight...” Jeanne counted down slowly, and her tone was cold. “Three, two...”

“If I admit it, can you guarantee that I won’t be charged? How can you guarantee that Adrian won’t testify against me?! You also said that being the mastermind and being instigated are two crimes of different degrees!” Joshua suddenly said.

It was a disguised admission.

At this moment, Alexander was furious.

He suddenly kicked hard on Joshua’s body.

As such, Joshua was knocked over.

He suddenly fell to the ground and grimaced in pain.

Jenifer looked at her son who was suddenly kicked. Although she was mad, her heart ached.

She did not dare to go up and persuade Alexander.

Alexander’s body was trembling. “You b*stard, I want to beat you to death! I want to beat you to death!”

As he said that, he stepped forward and kicked Joshua a few more times.

He was probably infuriated.

“Dad, Dad, don’t hit me, don’t hit me. I know I’m wrong, I know I’m wrong. I didn’t want to do it. I just couldn’t stand seeing Jeanne bullying our family like this. I just wanted to teach her a lesson. I know I’m wrong. Wah...” Joshua was an adult, yet he cried out without any sense of propriety.

Alexander beat him for a long time. He only stopped after he was out of breath.

He sat on the chair in the study. He was so enraged that his face turned red.

Joshua cried out in pain on the ground.

Jonathan looked at Alexander coldly. “This is the child you raised. As expected, he’s as useless as you!”

Alexander was made ugly by Jonathan.

Having said that, he could not refute Jonathan because of Joshua’s mistake this time.

“Compared to Jeanne, all of you are no different from trash!” Jonathan said fiercely.

Alexander was suppressing the extreme anger in his heart.

This time, he was slapped hard in the face.

He had once looked down on Jeanne. He was even certain that the scandal from the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse was done by Jeanne. He had never thought that she was not the one behind it. Instead, it was Joshua, whom he had personally groomed. If word got out, he would truly lose all his face!
