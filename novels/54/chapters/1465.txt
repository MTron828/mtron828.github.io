Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox dragged Shelly into the private room and let go of her arm angrily.

Shelly did not leave either. Anyway, she could not escape. At most, she would just take it as if the dog in front of him had gone crazy.

“Eat this first,” Nox ordered.

Shelly glanced at the medicine and a glass of water on the coffee table.

“Why? You want to marry me by having my son?” Nox raised his eyebrows.

Shelly sneered. Then, she picked up the pill in front of her and swallowed it without hesitation. Even though she had taken a birth control pill early in the morning, she would never bear Nox’s child in her entire life.

Nox felt a little displeased when he saw that Shelly did not hesitate. He was ready for Shelly to find an excuse not to eat the pill, but he did not expect her to eat it in one bite!

He felt like something was stuck in his throat, making him panic.

“Anything else?” Shelly asked him after she ate the pill.

Nox’s throat moved, and he said, “Tell me. What do you want for setting me up last night?!”

Did Nox think that she drugged him last night? It really proved how stupid Nox was. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Shelly, what’s with the smile on your face?!” Nox was furious again.

Was she mocking him? What right did she have to laugh at him?

“Do you feel a great sense of accomplishment because you managed to set me up in bed again? Do you feel good that you fooled me?!” Nox was furious. “Nox, did I force you to sleep with me last time?” Shelly suddenly asked him.

Nox was stunned.

Last time, when his legs had yet recovered and Shelly was taking care of him, they had slept together once. He admitted that he had drunk a little that time.

He remembered he had told the boy who liked Shelly to pursue Shelly and had even given him financial assistance. He had thought that if Shelly fell in love with someone else, he could openly break off the engagement with her.

During that period of time, that boy was indeed very close to Shelly, and Nox had also arranged for his men to follow the two of them.

Once, his men gave him a few photos of the boy kissing Shelly, but how did he feel at that time? He felt that Shelly was just like any other girl. She said she liked him and wanted to marry him, yet she still could not resist the temptation of others… and cheated on him.

Even though he had planned everything, he was still so angry that night that he lost his mind. Therefore, he drank some wine to make himself feel better.

He did not know why he wanted to get over it. Anyway, he did not want to dwell too much on Shelly’s matter, so he decided to pass the time with alcohol. In fact, he was not drunk but tipsy. Once he was tipsy, it was easy for him to lose control of himself.

That night, when Shelly helped him shower, sleep, and massaged his legs as usual, he had sex with her. After having sex with her, he regretted it so much that he wanted to bang his head against the wall.

Why did he sleep with Shelly?! He did not even dare to think about the scene of him sleeping with her because it was simply humiliating.

Shelly, on the other hand, was very calm about it. “I’ll tell Grandpa Winter.”

No way! Once she told his grandfather, he would really have to marry Shelly, and he could never marry her. For some reason, there was a voice telling him that he absolutely could not marry her.

As such, before Shelly informed his family, he gave the photo of Shelly kissing the boy to his family. He said that Shelly was an indecent woman who slept with him and was entangled with other men. That way, even if he slept with Shelly, his family would not force him to marry her.

The day he gave his family the photo, Nox’s mother came to look for Shelly alone. He did not know what they talked about, but when Nox’s mother left, she looked a little helpless.

Nox understood the look in his mum’s eyes, that she felt helpless that he and Shelly could not get married.

Due to what he did, he thought Shelly would cause a scene with him. After all, he was a little too petty, so he thought he would let Shelly do whatever she wanted in front of him.

However, Shelly did not react to the situation at all and was studying hard..
