Chapter 234: Fourth Master Swan Was Teased by Jeanne

In the dining room, two rows of people were confronting each other.

Edward was staring intently at Jeanne, who was being carried by Kingsley.

Jeanne’s face was rosy and she was nestled in Kingsley’s embrace. She was leaning against his chest, and they looked very intimate.

Nox could feel Edward’s anger.

Even though Edward was still expressionless, Nox could feel his imposing manner.

Kingsley glanced at Edward.

He just looked at Edward and walked past him while carrying Jeanne.

Edward pursed his lips.

Next, he reached out and grabbed Jeanne’s hand on Kingsley’s arm.

He did it with force.

Kingsley stopped for a moment.

At this moment, Kingsley gave Miles a look.

Miles suddenly kicked.

It was an accurate and ruthless kick at Fourth Master Swan’s arm.

Nox was quick to react. He used his leg to block it fiercely.

As such, Miles kicked Nox’s leg instead.

At that moment, Nox had a feeling that Fourth Master Swan might not even let go of Jeanne’s hand even if his arm was broken.

Just like that, Nox and Miles started to fight.

There were punches and kicks, and the fight was very fierce.

At this moment, West hurriedly shielded George behind him and moved a little further away.

The commotion in the restaurant was very big.

Even so, none of the staff dared to go forward.

“Let go!” Kingsley said coldly.

Edward looked at Kingsley. “I won’t let go.”

Kingsley’s face darkened.

He hugged Jeanne tightly and planned to fight with Fourth Master Swan.

At this moment, Jeanne suddenly opened her eyes.

When she opened her eyes, she saw Fourth Master Swan in front of her.

Her eyes moved.

Before Kingsley made a move, Jeanne suddenly stretched out her hand and used her other hand to touch Fourth Master Swan’s face.

Fourth Master Swan was stunned.

Kingsley was also dumbfounded.

Jeanne held Fourth Master Swan’s face. Her fingers even moved closer to his lips. It seemed like she was teasing him…

Fourth Master Swan looked down to watch Jeanne’s actions.

Kingsley also watched.

Jeanne touched Edward’s lips for a long time. After a long time, she said, “They look so cold and hard. Why do they feel so soft?”

“...” Fourth Master Swan’s eyes moved slightly.

At this moment, Nox, who was fighting at the side, felt that it was interesting. Therefore, when Miles approached again, he gestured for Miles to pause and look over there.

Miles took a look and also felt that... it was quite a novel scene.

Hence, the two people who were fighting suddenly became quiet and looked over there in unison.

Jeanne’s fingers left Edward’s lips but did not leave his body. Instead, she moved her fingers down and touched his Adam’s apple. She could feel it moving up and down.

She seemed to find it very funny and even used her finger to poke it gently.

After that, she also poked Edward’s chest. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Edward obviously could not hold it in any longer.

“How can your figure be so good?” Jeanne touched and even pinched his chest.

Nox wanted to burst out laughing.

‘Is Fourth Master Swan being teased?!

‘Oh my god.’

‘If she continues to touch him like that, I’m afraid that his hand would be crippled tonight.’

Nox just stared wide-eyed at the scene of Jeanne teasing Fourth Master Swan in front of everyone. He watched with relish.

However, Kingsley suddenly carried Jeanne a few steps further away at this time.

It was as if he suddenly reacted, and his expression was extremely ugly.

The touch on Jeanne’s hand disappeared, and she was a little dissatisfied. “Kingsley, I haven’t f*cking had a man for a long time. I want one too!”

“...” Kingsley was about to explode with anger.

He carried Jeanne and left directly.

It was obvious that Jeanne was twisting in his arms as if she was protesting.

As for the man who was teased, he was suddenly frozen, and he could only watch as Jeanne was carried away.

Once Kingsley and Jeanne left, Miles naturally followed quickly. West hurriedly carried George and chased after them.

After that, only Edward and Nox were left.

Nox looked in the direction that the group of people had left and turned around to look at Edward. “Ms. Lawrence seems to be dissatisfied. Fourth Master Swan, have you not satisfied her—”

Edward gave him a look.

Nox shrugged.

He pretended that he did not say anything.

Edward turned around and left as well.

He had come on purpose after he heard that Jeanne was dining here. Now that she had left, of course, he would also leave.

Nox accompanied Edward back to the car.

Their journey back was silent.

They arrived at the Swans’ compound.

Edward got out of the car.

Nox could not help but say, “Fourth Master Swan, take it easy tonight. Don’t cripple your hand!”
