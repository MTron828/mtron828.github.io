Chapter 289: George Is “Abused”, and Jeanne Returns

“I know you’ve long discovered that someone has breached your intranet, but you never knew where the loophole is. I saw that your technicians have been maintaining and repairing a code. In fact, I deliberately left a mark there to let them think that that’s the entry point I used.”

‘F*ck.

‘He’s so young, but he knows how to create a diversion,’ Nox wondered.

No wonder his technicians kept saying that they had fixed the firewall, but for some reason, the other party was still able to hack into their system easily.

After hacking into their system, the hacker left a small bomb, causing the technicians to work overtime for some time.

“Here,” George said, “Only three codes are missing.”

George got to the point.

The moment when he was editing the code, he turned to look at Fourth Master Swan. “Fourth Master Swan, will you let me go after I fix it?”

He did not forget to confirm this.

Edward nodded.

George did not ask any more questions. He looked pure and innocent.

It gave people a feeling that if they lied to him, they would be struck by lightning.

George tapped on the screen.

A miracle was born.

The moment George pressed the enter key, all of his things were withdrawn.

In an instant, the entire screen showed a red alarm light, indicating that George had been ejected by the system.

Just like that, the system was repaired.

Nox was completely stunned.

His phone suddenly rang at that moment.

Nox took a look and picked up.

“Mr. Winter.”

“Speak.”

“Our intranet has somehow repaired itself.” The person on the other end was very excited.

‘Somehow my *ss.’

“You people only know how to scam my money. Pack your things and leave tomorrow!” To think that he had spent so much money to raise a bunch of trash.

“...”

Nox hung up the phone.

At that moment, he could not help but look at the laptop in front of George again.

This kid was not simple.

George did not feel proud at all. He got up from the ground and said to Fourth Master Swan, “Can I go now?”

“Where do you plan to go?” Edward asked him.

He did not say that he would stop him.

“Fourth Master, you don’t have to worry about it.”

“Are you six years old this year?”

“Yes.”

“You still need a guardian.”

George frowned.

“Of course, I’ll keep my word,” Edward said. “Call your mom, and I’ll send you back to her.”

George looked at Edward with a displeased look on his face.

Nox, who was at the side, was shocked by Edward’s shameless words.

‘Isn’t it obvious that he has tricked little George?!’

George helped Edward fix the loophole in his business, but Edward was asking him to bring him to see his mom!

A pro!

Nox could only say that Fourth Master Swan was the real pro.

George had been wrong from the start when he wanted to make a deal with Fourth Master Swan!

Nox felt that George was about to cry from being bullied by Fourth Master Swan.

Even so, Fourth Master Swan was indifferent.

He was indifferent and waited for George’s reaction.

George bit his lip and said, “I finally know why my mom doesn’t like you.”

Edward raised his eyebrow slightly.

“My mom doesn’t like old and cunning people!”

“...”

Nox burst out laughing.

George even knew that he had been tricked.

His IQ was superior to that of ordinary people.

Edward did not seem to care about George’s accusation.

Though there were still some subtle changes in his expression.

He suddenly stood up from the sofa.

When he stood up, George seemed really short.

Edward said, “Think about it carefully. Once you’re done, call your mom. I’ll send you back to her. I’ve never gone back on my word.”

‘He still has the nerve to say that he has never gone back on his word.

‘Fourth Master Swan, don’t lose your face just like that!’ Nox thought to himself.

Edward left just like that.

He left in a carefree manner. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

George stood there in a huff.

Perhaps it was due to his high IQ, he did not make a big fuss about it.

He just watched Fourth Master Swan leave and looked extremely aggrieved.

Nox could not stand it any longer. He went over to comfort George out of kindness. “Don’t be angry. Many people have been schemed against by Fourth Master Swan. You’re not the only one.”

“That’s because your IQ is low.”

“...”

‘F*ck.’

Nox felt that he was being kind for nothing.

He suddenly felt that George’s personality was exactly the same as Edward’s, who would abandon people upon achieving his goal!

…

In the international airport of South Hampton City.

Kingsley sent Jeanne directly to the plane.

Jeanne sat on the plane and looked at the scenery of South Hampton City.
