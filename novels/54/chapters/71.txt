Chapter 72: Ms. Lawrence, Do You Want to Go to My Place?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn dragged Monica back.

His actions were really rude.

Monica resisted a few times, but because she was drunk and could not exert her strength, she was still dragged by Finn. She staggered along the way.

“Can you not drag me?” Monica complained.

‘This son of a b*tch.

‘Can’t he be gentler to me?’

Finn pressed the button on the elevator and held her hand even tighter.

Ten minutes ago, he received a call from Nox, who said that Monica had come home drunk alone and asked him to pick her up... Then, he bumped into her and Michael.

When the elevator arrived, Finn brought Monica into the house and brought her to her room.

Monica struggled to break free from Finn. She did not take off her clothes or shoes and directly laid down. Then, she pretended to be a corpse.

Finn looked at Monica for a long time..

In the end, he went over to help her take off her high heels. Then, he went to the bathroom and wrung a wet towel for her to wipe the makeup on her face. Just as he was about to leave, he saw Monica clutching her skirt uncomfortably. She was not ladylike at all.

Monica was wearing a tight-fitting blue dress tonight. It was very easy for her... to have a panty flash.

Finn gulped slightly. He squatted down again and moved her hands away. Then, he helped her to unzip the zipper on her back.

After he was done, he turned around and left.

“Finn,” Monica suddenly called out to him. Finn’s body was a little stiff.

“You’re leaving just like that?” Monica asked with a seductive smile on her lips.

Finn pursed her lips. He turned around and looked at Monica.

He looked at the loose dress on her body that did not fall off, but it seemed to be faintly discernible.

“Are you a man or not?!” Monica’s voice was quite loud.

At this moment, she had a severe headache, but she also seemed to be unwilling to give up!

‘Am I not charming to him at all?

‘Back then, did he only agree to date me just to deal with my pestering?!’

“What are you looking forward to?” The corners of Finn’s lips curled up.

Monica suddenly got down from the bed.

Her dress hung improperly on her body.

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

Monica stood barefoot in front of him, her fair arms wrapped around his neck.

She said, “Do you dare to sleep with me?”

Finn gulped.

“I dare,” Monica said.

After saying that, she tiptoed and approached Finn.

Her lips were pressed against his.

Once might not believe it.

This was their first kiss.

They did not have any intimate contact during their passionate love that year. Even when the priest said that they could kiss at the wedding ceremony, Finn only lightly kissed her on the cheek.

Monica felt inexplicably aggrieved.

She closed her eyes, wanting to deepen the kiss..

“Ah!” At home, there was a sudden scream.

Monica paused.

Finn pushed her away.

Monica’s body was unstable, and she fell to the ground.

Finn did not seem to expect it. He wanted to carry Monica up right away.

“Ah...” The scream was even more panicked.

Finn gritted his teeth and turned to walk out.

“Finn!” Monica sat on the ground and called out to him.

Finn was stunned for a while.

“What exactly is our relationship?” Monica asked him in a ridiculous manner.

“What is your relationship with Michael?” Finn asked back.

Monica bit her lip.

The words Michael said earlier suddenly appeared in her mind. He said... that he had always loved her.

“Since you haven’t let go of him, what right do you have to talk about a relationship with me?”

Finn left after saying that.

The door was slammed shut.

Monica sat on the floor and watched Finn leave. He left to look for his old lover.

The corners of Monica’s mouth suddenly curled up into a smile.

A teardrop fell from her eye.

She had taken the initiative to chase after Finn back then, so she should unconditionally endure all of Finn’s... disdain for her!

…

At the same time, under the same dark sky.

Edward sent the drunk Jeanne back to the entrance of the Lawrence family’s courtyard.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly. She was a little slow and wanted to open the car door and leave.

At that moment, her body was suddenly pulled by someone.

Jeanne lost her balance and fell directly into someone’s firm chest.

She twisted her body.

Jeanne twisted her body on someone’s body, trying to break free.

“Ms. Lawrence,” the person said in a low voice.

Jeanne raised her head and looked at the man in front of her.

“Who am I?” He asked.

Sometimes, no, most of the time, Jeanne felt that this man was crazy.

Her lips parted slightly. “Fourth Mast— Hng.”

Jeanne widened her eyes.

Before she could finish, Edward had kissed her fiercely.

In fact, because she had opened her mouth to answer his question, her lips were open, so…

Jeanne pounded on Edward.

Nonetheless, she did not have any strength.

Alcohol was indeed not a good thing. She would not drink it again until she died.

She was holding back her anger.

After a long time, the man who kissed her finally let go of her red and swollen lips.

He let go of her lips but did not let go of her body.

His face was buried in the middle of her neck, emitting hot air.

Jeanne started to twist her body again, resisting.

In the next second…

“Ah...” Jeanne cried.

Her neck was in pain as she was bitten by someone.

After biting her, the person asked shamelessly, “Ms. Lawrence, do you want to go to my place?”

If Jeanne had the strength at this moment, she would cripple this fellow.

She said, “I don’t want to go! Let me go! I want to get off!”

“Wait for me for a while. I’ll send you back.” The man did not force her, but his voice was unusually hoarse. “However, at this moment, I’m not in the condition for anyone to see me.”

“Why?” Jeanne was baffled.

Edward raised his head slightly and leaned close to her ear.

He whispered a few words into her ear with a hot breath.

Jeanne’s face, which was already red from being drunk, was completely hot.

‘Isn’t he cold and abstinent?!

‘It was a f*cking lie!’

Jeanne pushed Edward away in exasperation.

At that moment, Edward conveniently let go of her.

Then, he took a deep breath, opened the car door, and got out of the car.

Outside the car, the cool night breeze blew.

Fourth Master Swan seemed to have adjusted his emotions. He walked to Jeanne’s car door and opened it for her. Then, he bent down and carried her up.

Jeanne protested. “I can walk on my own.”

“But I want to carry you.”

“...”

Edward carried Jeanne and walked straight into the Lawrence family’s courtyard.

It was very late at night. Other than the servants, everyone else had returned to their rooms.

Edward carried Jeanne and walked straight into her room. The door was pushed open.

George was sitting in front of the computer, waiting for Jeanne. When he saw the door open, he quickly turned his head. When he saw Fourth Master Swan carrying his mother, he frowned.

Edward placed Jeanne on the bed.

George ran to Jeanne’s side and looked at Fourth Master Swan warily. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Jeanne’s back was also facing Fourth Master Swan. It was obvious that she wanted to distance herself from him.

Edward did not care. He said to George, “Do you know how to take care of people?”

“Yes,” George said immediately.

“Take good care of her,” Edward said.

“I don’t need you to remind me.” George’s tone was not good.

Fourth Master Swan smiled.

At that moment, he even reached out and touched George’s little head.

The action was very intimate.

George did not like Fourth Master Swan treating him like this. He showed it on his face.

Fourth Master Swan pretended not to see it. He turned around and left. When he left, he seemed to glance at the computer screen in the room. He did not say anything and left.
