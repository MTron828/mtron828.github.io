Chapter 734: Warmth: Do You Know Why We Raise Pigs?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

If she were to get angry at him now, she would feel that it was her fault.

“Come, let me feed you.” There was no way she could reject Edward’s magnetic voice and gentle expression.

That was the first time she understood the meaning of the word “evildoer”.

She forced herself to sit up, and at that moment, the blanket fell off.

Jeanne followed Edward’s line of sight…

Then, she gritted her teeth and pulled the mattress up.

“Does it hurt?” he asked her.

It was obvious that he saw the dense bruises on her body.

“If I say it hurts, will you stop?” Jeanne asked.

Edward took two seconds to do some serious thinking.

“No.”

In that case, why did he ask?

“Open your mouth.” Edward’s guilt only lasted for a second.

He picked up some eggs with his fork and placed them beside Jeanne’s mouth, coaxing her to open her mouth.

Jeanne, however, did not have an appetite. Who would want to eat right after they woke up from their sleep?

Despite that, she could not reject Edward’s initiative. It was as if it would hurt him greatly once she rejected him.

How many faces did that man have?

In the end, she opened her mouth and ate the eggs by the side of her mouth. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

She chewed twice and was surprised that it tasted not bad as she did not have much hope at first.

After all, Edward was not the type to cook.

“Is it good?” Edward observed Jeanne’s expression and asked.

“It’s not bad.” Jeanne nodded.

“If you like it, I will feed it to you every day.”

Jeanne was at a loss for words, indicating that she did not want to eat it.

Edward laughed out loud. “Jeannie, you’ve learned to be bad.”

Damn it! If he did not think of it, how would he know that she had learned to be bad?

“Be good and open your mouth again.” Edward continued to feed her.

Jeanne sat at the head of the bed and ate eggs on toast that Edward fed her mouthful by mouthful.

The room of the two of them.

Under the rippling autumn sunlight, the room with the two of them was filled with love.

It turned out happiness could really be that simple, as simple as a plate of eggs on toast that he personally made.

“Do you still want more?” Edward asked.

At that moment, Jeanne realized that she had finished the plate of eggs on toast and seemed to want more.

“Would you still like more?” Edward confirmed again.

“I’m not a pig,” Jeanne refused.

She did not want to trouble Edward anymore.

Moreover, she was indeed full. However, it was delicious, and someone was serving her, so she was a little greedy.

“How can a pig be as cute as you?” Edward looked at her dotingly.

Could he not compare her to a pig?

“Are you sure that’s enough?” Edward repeated to confirm.

Was he really afraid that she would not be full?

“That’s enough for me,” Jeanne replied positively. “I want to continue sleeping– Mm.”

Before she could lie down, someone kissed her.

Did she have sugar on her lips? Otherwise, why would he want her all the time?

This guy’s superb kissing skills could really make her lose herself in his world.

She was panting and thought he had had enough of that kiss. Unexpectedly, he suddenly climbed onto the bed.

“Edward, you–”

“Do you know why we raise pigs?” Edward interrupted her.

Jeanne looked at him with a guarded expression.

“To fatten them up for some good meat.”

“...”

She cursed, thinking that if she died one day, she would probably be murdered.

…

Nox and George came back after breakfast, but they did not see Edward anywhere downstairs.

That was when Nox knew that the guy would not go to Old Master Swan’s place today.

He did not understand. What fun was there in a woman? Should a group of women not be more fun?

“How long would it take for them to eat breakfast?” George seemed to be a little displeased as he muttered.

How long would it take to some eggs on toast?

He and Nox had already eaten breakfast outside, yet they had not come downstairs.

“That will depend on your father’s ability,” Nox answered casually.

“Huh?” George was baffled.

What kind of Martian language were the adults speaking?

“You’re still young, so you don’t understand. You’ll know when you grow up.” Nox smiled pensively.

“Only people with low IQ will deliberately show off!”

Nox was confused as to who George was criticizing.

As George scuffled up the stairs, Nox looked at George’s back speechlessly.

That kid really did not know how to be grateful.

Fortunately, Nox was not a calculative person. Moreover, he would not lower himself and argue with a young kid.

He was just a little sad that Edward was often disobeying Old Master Swan for Jeanne.

He wondered…
