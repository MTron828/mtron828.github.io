Chapter 609: Alexander Exposed, Revenge Feels Great

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The obedient George was actually pretty cute.

“Old Master Swan, you can’t pamper George like this. George is still young and can still be corrected. If he grows up to become unruly, it will be the Swans’ misfortune.” Shane kept fanning the flames. “Moreover, George has never been a Swan, to begin with. You don’t have to protect him like this. In the end, it’s not the Swans’ fault that he’s unruly. You can blame it on George not having a father since he was young–”

“Who said I don’t have a father?” George was enraged.

At that moment, he let go of Old Master Swan’s thigh and walked up to Shane. He said fiercely, “Fourth Master Swan is my father. He’s my biological father, the kind that I can’t choose!”

“I don’t know if this is a white lie that the Swans told George, but I personally think that lying to him under the circumstances where everyone knows that George isn’t a Swan isn’t good for him,” Shane said righteously.

The others obviously did not believe that George was Fourth Master Swan’s son either.

George said through gritted teeth, “As I said, Fourth Master Swan is my biological father.”

Little George almost wanted to swear.

It was the first time he wanted to let people know that his father was Fourth Master Swan, but no one believed him.

Old Master Evans laughed sarcastically. “Any Tom, Dick, and Harry can marry rich and join the upper-class society–”

“George is indeed the son of the Swans,” Old Master Swan said firmly.

The entire hall was in an uproar.

They did not believe it at first, but because of Old Master Swan’s confident tone, they had no choice but to believe it.

“George, take off your glasses,” Old Master Swan said.

George was still wearing his glasses.

Jeanne said that when children were outside, they had to learn how to protect themselves. If they were too good-looking, they would be more prone to getting kidnapped, and after being kidnapped, they would become orphans.

George was most afraid of becoming an orphan, so Jeanne tricked him.

Upon hearing Old Master Swan’s instructions, George hurriedly took off his black-rimmed glasses, exposing his face that was identical to Edward’s to everyone.

Alexander and his family knew about it. Hence, they did not say a word at that moment.

Moreover, their spirits were crushed. After all, exposing George’s identity to the public was to flatter Jeanne. The more smug Jeanne was, the more jealous the Lawrences became.

The scene fell quiet for a few seconds because of George’s appearance.

Monica actually did not know because no one had told her.

Hence, when she saw George’s appearance, she could not help but swear, “F*ck! He really did sleep with you seven years ago!”

Jeanne was a little speechless, thinking, ‘Can Monica not be so tactless at a moment like this?’

Others also echoed, “He looks like Fourth Master Swan.”

“He’s carved out of the same mold. Why didn’t I realize it before?”

“He’s Fourth Master Swan’s son.”

In an instant, the hall was abuzz.

Everyone was discussing George’s identity.

Old Master Swan said to Shane, “Do you see it now?”

Shane gritted his teeth and did not say anything more.

Everyone now understood why the Swans favored Jeanne so much. It turned out that Jeanne had given birth to a son for the Swans.

Previously, they thought that Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan were just in a marriage of convenience. Even now, there were people saying that Fourth Master Swan could not get an erection. That was why he got married to disguise himself and be a father. Now that they knew the truth, they could no longer offend Jeanne.

Seeing that Shane did not say anything, Old Master Swan opened his mouth and spoke with a rather authoritative tone, “There’s both right and wrong in what happened today. But at Mr. Lawrence’s funeral, let’s not say anymore.”

“Dad.” Jeanne stepped forward respectfully.

“What else would you like to say, Jeannie?” Old Master Swan was in a good mood.

“Regarding my grandfather’s death, I think we need to clarify something,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

Old Master Swan nodded. “Go ahead.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“...”

He had just said not to say anymore.

Old Master Swan was too obvious in protecting Jeanne.

However, no one dared to speak out even though they were angry.

After all, who would dare to resist Old Master Swan if he wanted to protect someone?

However, the whole thing had let everyone know that Jeanne’s status in the Swans was not low.

Jeanne smiled gratefully at Old Master Swan before turning around to face everyone.

By then, Finn had also retreated behind Jeanne, silently keeping his presence to a minimum.

Monica still glanced at Finn even though he did not look at her.
