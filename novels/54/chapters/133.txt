Chapter 134: I’m Not as Easy to Deal With as Before

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Lawrence Enterprise, at the Marketing Department Director’s office.

Jeanne lit up a cigarette.

Since she had been working overtime these two days, the frequency of her smoking was obviously more than before.

She had just taken two puffs when her phone rang.

She glanced at the incoming call and slowly picked it up. “General Manager.”

“Come up!”

As soon as this phrase was basically spitted at her, the call was cut off.

Jeanne took a deep breath.

She put out the remaining half of the cigarette butt and went straight to Alexander’s office.

Anyway, she could not avoid it.

She could only force her way in.

She walked to Alexander’s office and knocked on the door.

“Come in!”

Jeanne pushed the door open and entered.

Other than Alexander who had an extremely ugly expression on his face, Joshua was also in the office.

Of course, Joshua could only be there to fan the flames.

Jeanne did not mind. She walked toward Alexander and appeared to be very respectful. “Why is the General Manager looking for me?”

“Don’t call me the General Manager. I don’t have as much power as you right now. Should I call you the General Manager instead?” Alexander mocked.

Jeanne was very clear about what Alexander was so sour about. After all, she had asked Jonathan Lawrence to restrict his power.

She did not explain further and said straightforwardly, “I can solve this matter. I just need you to give me more time.”

“How do you want to solve it?” Alexander was extremely sarcastic, “Yesterday afternoon, you told me not to let the outside world think that the Sanders are targeting us. What are you doing now? You are exposing the news yourself and letting everyone know that the Sanders are targeting us? Jeanne, what on earth are you thinking?!”

“Everything is constantly changing. Yesterday afternoon, I thought that the Sanders incident was just a coincidence, so I could not let everyone else misunderstand us. But now that I have understood the entire situation, I realize that this is the truth. Since this is the truth, we need to face the resistance head-on!”

“Are you crazy? You are going to fight against the Sanders? Don’t you know who is in control of Harken? Don’t you know that the Harken is a Constitutional Monarchy, and all the power is in the hands of the Sanders? Do you think that our family has not suffered enough losses yet? Will you only be satisfied if the Lawrences really go bankrupt?” Alexander was furious and his appearance was extremely ferocious.

“I am saving the Lawrences,” Jeanne said firmly.

“Don’t talk nonsense here...”

“If you can listen to my explanation now, then listen. If you don’t want to, then shut up!” Jeanne’s aura was very strong.

Her appearance made Alexander, who was in a fit of anger, pause.

He was instantly crushed under Jeanne’s demeanor.

“Yes, I admit that I made grandfather control you. It’s not for any personal reason, it’s just because you might drag me down.”

Alexander was really triggered by Jeanne’s tone.

He raised his hand, but Jeanne caught it.

Alexander moved his arm, but he could not move.

Joshua saw that Jeanne had made a move on Alexander, so he quickly intended to take this opportunity and teach Jeanne a lesson. He thought to himself that if he did not hit this woman properly today, she would really think she could be in charge of the Lawrences.

He wanted to give Jeanne a hard slap on the face.

Jeanne’s eyes and hands were quick. When Joshua was getting closer, she kicked Joshua’s stomach.

Joshua only felt an intense pain in his body.

The next second, when he reacted, he had already been on the ground. He had even retreated quite a distance.

When Alexander saw that, he was completely shocked.

Joshua was kicked to the ground. He was in so much pain that he could not even get up.

At this moment, Jeanne suddenly let go of Alexander’s arm.

Alexander only felt a wave of pain in his wrist.

He looked fiercely at Jeanne.

Jeanne coldly said, “Dad, I’m not as easy to deal with as before.”

After saying that, she directly left.

The door was slammed shut.

The slam indicated how angry the person who closed the door was.

Alexander looked in the direction of the door. It was obvious that he had been suppressed by Jeanne. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He turned his head to look at Joshua, who was on the ground. He then unconsciously moved his wrist.

Jeanne, was she the same daughter that he could casually hit and scold back then?

“Dad.” Joshua was lying on the ground. He was in so much pain that he could not speak. “I want to sue Jeanne. I want to sue her for intentional harm... Dad… It’s so painful…”

Alexander gritted his teeth.

He could never let Jeanne ride on his head.

…

Jeanne returned to the office.

She suppressed her anger.

She actually did not expect herself to lose control today.

She probably did not want to experience the beating she got seven years ago again, so when Alexander and Joshua were about to lay their hands on her, she retaliated.
