“I understand,” Jeanne agreed.

She had always listened to Kingsley’s orders.

“I’ll give you two pieces of advice. First, Fourth Master Swan will definitely protect such an important person in a place he can best do so, so you must carefully observe everyone around Fourth Master Swan. Don’t let a single person go. Secondly, as I said earlier, Lucy must have left a mark on the other party. The more suspicious the person around Fourth Master Swan is, the more likely he is to be injured. Once you find this person, report to me immediately. I will think of a way to probe him.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Alright.”

“Fourth Master Swan should be back tomorrow. Take care of your own safety. If you sense that Fourth Master Swan has the intention to kill you, evacuate immediately. Mason and Miles will be the first to escort you away,” Kingsley instructed.

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded and asked, “Is that all?”

“Do you have something to say to me?” Kingsley asked.

“Can I say something about my teacher’s death?” Jeanne asked bluntly.

Kingsley’s expression changed. “What do you want to say?”

“Aren’t you sad about her death?” Jeanne asked.

“I spent a lot of money to nurture this assassin, so it is indeed a pity that she’s dead.”

“Is it just a pity?”

“Jeanne.” Kingsley said seriously, “As a member of the Hills, do you think I will feel guilty or even sad because of the death of an assassin?”

Kingsley’s voice was cold. “The Hills have tens of thousands of assassins and tens of thousands of deaths. Do you think I will be emotional because of the death of a person I’m used to having around?”

“In your heart, Lucy is no different from other killers.”

“There’s no difference.” Kingsley was resolute with his answer.

“Okay, I understand.” Jeanne did not say anything more.

She just felt a little upset for Lucy, who loved a man so much but did not receive a shred of pity from him.

“Jeanne,” Kingsley suddenly called out to her.

The moment Jeanne was about to hang up the phone, Kingsley asked, “Are you in love with Fourth Master Swan?”

Jeanne did not answer.

“You’d best be clear about your relationship with Fourth Master Swan. He’s is loyal to the Duncans, and the Hills personally killed the Duncans! At any time, no matter what identity you use, you and Fourth Master Swan are irreconcilable enemies. If you are really in love with him, the person who will end up dying will be you.”

“I know. I don’t need you to remind me time and time again.”

“Think of a way to send George back.”

“No, I think George is safer with the Swans now.” Jeanne refused flatly.

Kingsley’s face darkened.

For the first time, he felt Jeanne’s distrust toward him.

“Before the outcome of the battle has been decided, George will not take any side, and that is for his protection.”

“Think it through yourself.” Kingsley did not say much either as the conversation between them both this time was not pleasant one.

After Kingsley put down the phone, the woman who had been by his side for the past few days, Millie, hugged his waist from behind. “Are you in a bad mood?”

If Lucy was the woman who was closest to Kingsley, the legendary female assassin named Jeanne was someone important to Kingsley. Jeanne could do whatever she wanted in front of him.

Apparently, Jeanne was the only person who was not afraid of Kingsley and could even challenge him in public.

With her, Kingsley had no bottom line.

At that moment, it was obvious that Kingsley was on the phone with Jeanne, or at least that was what Millie speculated.

“You’re only responsible for accompanying me to bed and listening to my orders. As for other things, don’t ask.” Kingsley said coldly, “The more an assassin knows, the faster he or she will die.”

Those words frightened Millie, and naturally, she did not dare to speak anymore.

All she did was reach her hand into Kingsley’s clothes to seduce him. In fact, she had been seducing him like that for the past few days.

However, Kingsley suddenly pushed Millie away.

Millie stumbled back a few steps, a little surprised at his refusal.

It was clear that he had been infatuated with her body for the past few days.

“Mr. Thorn–”

“Don’t come into my room if I don’t summon you in the future. Get out!” Kingsley ordered harshly

Millie did not dare to resist or stay for a second longer, so she left in a hurry.

When she was leaving, she thought that as she expected, that woman called Jeanne was not someone she could offend.

Lucy was only rumored to be very important to Mr. Thorn, but he was, in fact, indifferent to Lucy’s death.

However, Jeanne’s phone call immediately put Mr. Thorn in a bad mood.

Millie left fearfully.

She suddenly thought she was lucky that Mr. Thorn did not agree to let her carry out the mission when Lucy came yesterday. If he had agreed, the one dead would have been her!
