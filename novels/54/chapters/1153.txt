1154 The War Has Started: Edward’s True Identity Is Exposed

“So, you chose George.”

“I told Teddy to take George away, but I don’t know where they went. In that short and critical period of time, I couldn’t have thought of how to get Teddy to take George away and where to hide him. Alex, you think too highly of me,” Finn said furiously.

Alex’s eyes were cold, and he was silent. He seemed to be thinking about whether Finn was telling the truth.

Finn’s expression was calm.

“But in the end, you were the one who hid George.”

Therefore, it was still Finn’s fault.

Finn’s veins were popping, and he tried his best to hold his anger in.

“I’ll give you a chance.” Alex said, “Give Teddy a call and ask him where he is!”

Finn looked at Alex coldly.

However, Alex remained emotionless in the face of Finn’s emotional outburst.

“My time is limited. It’s not easy for me to take the time to see you,” Alex urged.

Finn gritted his teeth and took Alex’s cell phone.

He knew that if he did not do as he was told, Alex would definitely hurt Monica.

That was the way it was. If it was not necessary, they would not kill easily, but if it was, they would definitely kill.

He suppressed his anger and dialed Teddy’s number.

“Beep, beep…”

As the beeping sound went on, Finn’s face tensed up.

His first fear was that the other party would pick up the phone, so he hoped that the other party could not pick up.

However, the call went through.

Just like that, he heard Teddy’s voice, “Dr. Jones.”

Finn’s throat moved slightly as he held his phone and did not say a word. In fact, he was hesitating on whether to hang up or not.

“Dr. Jones,” Teddy called out to him again.

“Yes, Teddy.” Finn said, “I’m fine.”

“That’s great to hear.” The other party seemed to heave a sigh of relief.

“Take good care of George.”

“Alright.” Teddy agreed.

“Don’t let anyone find you. Don’t tell anyone where you are, not even me–” Finn’s phone was suddenly snatched by Alex!

At the same time, the phone was smashed into pieces.

Alex released his anger on the phone, while Finn calmly faced Alex’s intimidating anger.

After some time, or maybe it was one or two seconds later, Alex regained his calm.

The rage Alex was displaying a second ago and the coldness right now made Finn feel like he was looking at two different people.

One was Alex, and the other might be William, who had become one with Alex.

“I’ll bring you Monica’s corpse tomorrow,” he said coldly.

With that, he turned around and was about to leave.

“If she dies, I will die too.” Finn stared at Alex’s back. “I know I’m not important to you, but at least I’m still useful to you now.”

Alex stopped in his tracks.

“I’m the only witness to the Sanders’ underhanded operation. Otherwise, everything will just be a groundless rumor,” Finn reminded Alex.

Alex’s throat moved up and down as he said, “Finn, being too smart isn’t necessarily a good thing.”

“But it’s not a bad thing,” Finn said neither humbly nor arrogantly.

Upon hearing that comment, Alex left in anger.

Finn did not know if Alex would really kill Monica, but even if Alex did, there was nothing Finn could do.

Anyway, as long as Monica was alive, he would try his best to stay alive. However, if Monica was dead, he would accompany her.

Having seen through everything, life and death were no longer important anymore!

…

In the Sanders’ residence, Warren had overturned the desk in front of him. The ink and banknotes on it were all scattered on the ground.

Chester stood in the room, not daring to move.

He, too, did not expect that Finn would escape right under his nose in the end. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Since Michael had fought with Finn once before, he knew about Finn’s ability from Michael. Therefore, he specially selected special security guards with outstanding abilities, not expecting that it would end in failure!

When he reported the results to his father, he was naturally faced with his father’s wrath.

However, his father was not the only one who was angry. In fact, he was also extremely angry. He really did not think that killing Finn would be difficult.

Back then, Michael purposely did not kill Finn because he wanted to verify whether Finn was a descendant of the Duncans. If they really wanted to kill him, Finn would have been killed in the car accident. This time, he thought that as long as he gave the order to kill, Finn would definitely die.
