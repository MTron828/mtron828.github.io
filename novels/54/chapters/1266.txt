1267 The Birth of Paige

Jeanne was actually still in a somewhat dazed state.

She literally froze for several seconds when she looked at the puddle of water underneath her.

Her first reaction was that she was leaking urine.

The second reaction was…that her water had broken.

Her water broke meant that she was going into labor.

She was caught off guard, but felt that it was only right.

After all, the baby was full term.

After thinking clearly, she did not know what she felt, she put on her pants and tried to bring herself calmly out of the bathroom. She opened the door to her room and watched as Edward waited for her at the entrance to her room.

Every night had been the same. She would get up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet and he would help her up. After taking her to the bathroom, only then will go to the door to wait for her.

When she finished using the toilet, he would return to bed with her.

At this moment, she opened the bathroom door, and as usual, Edward was ready to help her back to bed.

Then he heard Jeanne say, “Edward, I’m going to give birth.”

Edward’s hand, which was holding her, visibly trembled for a moment.

She looked at his face, at his mixed expression, and seemed unable to react for a long time.

“Edward.” Jeanne called his name, trying to pull him back to his senses, “Please go and call the doctor.”

She was going into labor.

The doctor’s help was needed.

It was only at this moment that Edward seemed to return to his senses.

Looking back at Jeanne, he looked at her face full of calmness.

He nodded slightly and took Jeanne’s hand, letting her sit on the edge of the bed first before saying, “You rest for a while, don’t be afraid, I’ll go call the doctor right away.”

“I’m not scared.” Jeanne could not help but laugh a little.

The person who was trembling with fright did not know who it was.

Jeanne waited in the room for a while.

Edward returned to the room and picked her up directly after he crossed the room.

Jeanne hurriedly wrapped her arms around Edward’s neck because she was too heavy and she was afraid that Edward would not be able to hold her steady.

After the medical staff arrived, they made a special room to wait for delivery.

Both natural birth and C-section were prepared.

Jeanne was actually thankful.

At least Edward had the capability to convert his villa into a small hospital.

She could then give birth to the baby smoothly without any danger.

She was placed on the delivery bed by Edward, and the medical staff was all ready at this moment.

Even at three in the morning, they were still neatly in the waiting room, waiting for her.

After Edward put Jeanne down, he did not seem to have any intention of leaving.

Jeanne had let go of Edward’s neck at this moment, because only her amniotic fluid was broken and she did not feel any pain, so she was in good spirits.

She said, “Edward, go wait for me outside.”

Edward looked at her.

“The process of giving birth is rather unsightly, you’d better go wait for me outside.”

Edward’s throat moved slightly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He just looked at Jeanne’s smile.

He only looked at the faint smile she was trying to muster.

He said, “Okay.”

Good.

He promised her everything she wanted.

The only thing he could still do for her in this life was this.

Edward walked out of the delivery room.

He stood outside the door and stood there quietly.

He made a phone call to Dr. Jones.

At that time, Dr. Jones was obviously sleeping.

When he heard the phone call, he literally jolted up.

For those who had no idea, they would have thought his father died.

Monica just watched Finn leave so quickly in a daze, at which the speed of him leaving could surpass the world record.

She wondered.

With his dedication to his job and work, even when they were in bed, he would probably just pull away and leave.

She rolled over and continued to sleep.

...

When Dr. Jones arrived at Bamboo Garden in a hurry, Edward was standing alone at the entrance of the room.

He raised his eyes for a moment, still quiet as ever.

Dr. Jones took a deep breath and walked over, “How is Jeannie?”

“I don’t know. She went in for a while, still no response.”

“Giving birth won’t be so fast.” Dr. Jones offered comfort.

Edward nodded.

In fact, Dr. Jones had no idea how to comfort Edward.

He did not even know whether Edward wanted Jeanne to give birth sooner, so she could suffer less after all, or whether he wanted Jeanne to give birth later.

A later birth.

Just a little later…to leave.

A quiet night.

...

A piece of tranquility.

With no idea how much time had passed, Jeanne’s scream was suddenly heard from the room.

Edward’s body trembled.

Dr. Jones turned his eyes to look at him.

He always felt that the slightest movement now can frighten him.
