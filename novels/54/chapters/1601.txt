Chapter 1602: Grand Wedding, Zoe Gets Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Zoe was amused by Nox’s words. In fact, she had let herself go too much last night that she, too, was in low spirits now. However, she could not show how badly she wanted to find a bed and sleep on it.

After the car arrived at the wedding venue, Nox and Zoe went to change into their wedding suit and gown. At 12:00 p.m., the wedding banquet officially began.

The huge and beautiful wedding hall had been exposed by the on-site photographers before the wedding. At that moment, the light blue and pinkish purple romantic-looking hall was beautiful and breathtaking. It was not the most unique wedding, but considering how much money was put into that wedding, its decoration was simply incomparable.

Following the host’s introduction, Nox appeared in the middle of the stage in a white suit. In front of him was a long red carpet with flower petals. At the end of the red carpet, there was a beautiful small muslin-covered palace, where Zoe was standing inside, ready to walk toward him.

“Nox is quite handsome when he’s serious.” Monica was sitting in the audience seats and looking at Nox’s appearance while conversing with Jeanne.

Jeanne nodded. “He’s indeed quite handsome. He looks really different from the

Nox I remember.’

“Look at the smile on this guy’s face. He’s really blessed. Although I wasn’t there to pick up the bride with him, after watching the live broadcast, I have to admit that Nox really loves Zoe.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Nox wouldn’t treat marriage as child’s play. If he didn’t like Zoe, he wouldn’t marry her. In this aspect, Nox has his own sense of decency,” Jeanne commented.

In fact, she had an overall good impression of Nox. Coupled with the fact that Nox had risked his life to save her, her impression of Nox had increased.

“Forget it, I won’t worry about him anymore. I’d better give my blessings to this idiot.” Monica took a deep breath and said.

She still seemed slightly upset about Shelly, but now, she had to put down her prejudice and sincerely wish him well. After all, only the couple involved would know their relationship the best. Seeing Nox, that idiot, smiling from ear to ear, she could not bear to question his feelings anymore.

After Nox’s introduction, the host announced the bride’s entrance. Then, the sound of the wedding march rang out throughout the entire process.

Zoe held Mr. Sullivan’s arm and walked on the long carpet filled with petals. At the same time, rose petals were also scattered about in the air. The scene was so beautiful that it left everyone in awe, and everyone’s eyes were on the couple.

Mr. Sullivan then handed Zoe’s hand to Nox and patted Nox’s shoulder solemnly. Nox nodded respectfully as if he was making a promise. Such a simple gesture touched the crowd, and some in the comments were praising Nox.

Nox held Zoe’s hand and walked to the center of the stage, where the host said a lot of emotional stuff to prepare the atmosphere.

“Before the wedding, the most important person to the groom has a gift for him. I have to admit that I, too, haven’t seen it as this gift was just delivered to me. Are the bride and groom looking forward to it?” The host tried to build up suspense.

He had not seen the contents of the gift, but he assumed it was a gift that could cause a stir in the audience, so he wanted to liven the atmosphere. “Who sent it?” Nox was anxious.

Just a moment ago, his expression was calm, but now, his true self was revealed again.

The host looked at the red USB in his hand and said, “It’s an anonymous gift.’

Nox was curious as he loved that kind of surprise the most.

“Can the groom figure out who sent it?”

Nox was very cooperative with the host and did not put on airs as the richest man in the country. He thought for a while before asking, “Edward?” The Edward he mentioned was naturally the Leader of Harken.

At that moment, the lights in the venue were going around, as if they were trying to locate Edward. In an instant, a spotlight stopped, and Edward suddenly appeared on the screen of the live broadcast.

The comment section on the live broadcast was about to explode. Looking at Edward’s devastatingly beautiful face and him dressed elegantly in a suit, no matter how many times they saw the man, she would still be stunned by his looks..
