1218 Finn, What’s Our Relationship?

Finn had already guessed that Monica would leave. After all, no one would be able to accept the news of Edward suddenly announcing his marriage to someone else.

In fact, Finn was shocked too, but when he thought about it later, he believed Edward must have his reasons for doing that. Therefore, he quickly accepted it after a moment of shock. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, Monica would not. Monica would leave impulsively.

In the past, she might have rushed forward emotionally. Now, in order to not cause any trouble, she chose to leave.

“I’ve left,” Monica replied.

Finn stood at the main entrance with a bitter expression on his face. As expected, he was still a step too late.

He said, “If you’re not feeling well, go back and rest early.”

He knew that she was actually just looking for an excuse.

He, of course, would not expose her, but as a doctor, he should ask a few questions regarding her simple excuse. However, he did not ask her anything.

Therefore, at that moment, she asked, “Finn, what’s our relationship now?”

Finn was stunned. In fact, he did not quite understand what Monica was talking about.

“I thought we were dating.”

“What’s wrong?” Finn was a little surprised.

At that moment, he was even a little panicked. Was their relationship not going well?

“It’s nothing. I’m just a little sleepy.” Monica’s tone was light. “You should go back and rest early.

“Monica.” Finn called out to her, “Are you going home now?”

“Yes.”

“I’m coming to you.”

“No need.”

I don’t know if I’ve made you misunderstand something, but I’ll come to your house to look for you. Let’s have a talk.” Finn sounded a little flustered.

“No, it’s just that Fourth Master Swan’s actions today have come as a shock to me. I need to calm down.”

“I’ll be right there,” Finn said firmly.

“Finn, I said there’s no need!” Monica’s tone suddenly became a little violent.

Finn was stunned.

“I’m really not in a good mood today,” Monica explained.

“I know.” Finn said, “I just wanted to tell you in person what our relationship is. Since you don’t want to see me, I’ll tell you over the phone that we can get married–”

“Finn, sleep with me,” Monica suddenly interrupted him.

Finn froze again.

“Actually, if you want to prove that we’re in a relationship, you just have to sleep with me.” Monica’s tone was really very light and indifferent.

He could not hear much emotion from it, but it made Finn silent for a long time.

“Come find me again when you’ve thought it through.”

Monica immediately hung up the phone and sneered.

As expected, Finn was unwilling. Thinking back to the time they had sex, his reaction after he woke up was still fresh in her mind.

What had gotten into her to make her ask him to sleep with her again?

She leaned against the car seat and looked out of the window of South Hampton City.

She figured she was in a bad mood today, and that was why she had said so much to Finn in a fit of anger. However, she really was thinking about whether she and Finn should continue like that.

She really felt a little tired.

At that moment, she suddenly took a deep breath.

She told herself she would do whatever came to mind. Otherwise, she would not be able to make up her mind in the next second.

She picked up her phone and typed a message for Finn’s Whatsapp. “Finn, let’s not date…”

“Do you want to go to my place or the hotel?”

Before she could send a message, a message suddenly popped up in their chat box.

Monica’s eyes flickered. Should she send the unfinished text message?

“Let’s go to my house. I’ll wait for you there.”

While she hesitated, Finn sent another message.

Monica gritted her teeth and deleted all the messages that she had composed. Then, she typed one word. “Okay.”

Whether they should continue or end it, they would find out soon.
