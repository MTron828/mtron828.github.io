“I really don’t have any money. No matter how much trouble you cause here, I don’t have any money.” Shelly made it very clear to Zoe.

Zoe’s eyes were red as she probably really wanted to kill Shelly.

“You can leave,” Shelly ordered.

“I’m not leaving!” Zoe refused immediately, and it looked like she would never leave. “I’m not going anywhere until you give me the money! Shelly, if you don’t return the money to me, I won’t go anywhere!”

Shelly narrowed her eyes.

“Anyway, I have nothing now. If I don’t get the money back, my parents will beat me to death. Not only will they beat me to death, but our family of three will starve to death,” Zoe said fiercely to Shelly, looking hopeless.

Shelly looked at Zoe coldly. She knew what Zoe had gone through, but she did not sympathize with her. Everything was Zoe’s fault, and she should bear the consequences herself.

It was true that she had taken 200 thousand dollars from Zoe, but Zoe had given it to her willingly. She had not extorted or blackmailed Zoe. Moreover, she had also been implicated in the matter between Nox and Zoe, so she did not feel guilty about the 200 thousand dollars.

Then, when she heard that Zoe was going to pester her, she went forward and pushed Zoe away, forcing Zoe to leave.

Zoe almost fell to the ground from Shelly’s sudden push. However, Shelly opened the door and kept pushing Zoe out with all her might. Zoe did not react in time at first, but when she did, she started fighting with Shelly.

Just like that, the two women started fighting crazily, and no one showed mercy. The two of them tugged at each other’s hair and clawed each other’s bodies, wishing they could beat each other to death.

“Shelly, you b*tch! Let go of me!” Shelly was grabbing Zoe’s hair so hard that Zoe felt that her scalp was about to fall off.

In fact, Zoe was also doing the same to Shelly. There were countless scratches on Shelly’s face and body, all left by Zoe’s long nails.

“If you leave, I’ll let you go. Leave my house!”

“If you don’t give me the money, I won’t leave. You’ll suffer, and we’ll all suffer together! Ah!” Zoe screamed because Shelly was pulling at her hair. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Shelly also screamed because Zoe was doing the same to her. However, neither of them showed weakness and neither of them let go of each other.

Just as Shelly thought that she and Zoe might really die… a male voice suddenly sounded.

“Let go of Shelly!” Benjamin roared.

He really did not expect to see the two women hitting each other desperately when he came to see Shelly. At that moment, he realized that he could not underestimate the power a woman could unleash when she was angry.

“Let go of Shelly.” Benjamin stepped forward and grabbed Zoe’s hand with a lot of strength.

Zoe let go in pain, and Shelly suddenly pushed Zoe away, causing Zoe to take a few steps back. The two of them were in a sorry state, with their hair messy and their faces and bodies covered in scratches.

“Shelly, are you okay?” Benjamin did not even look at Zoe as he asked Shelly with concern.

He had seen the bleeding scratches on Shelly’s face and neck.

“It’s nothing.” Shelly said, “Please help me get this woman away.”

With that, she turned around and wanted to leave. She really did not want to see Zoe for even a second.

“Shelly, I said I won’t leave. I won’t leave even if I die. I won’t leave until you return my money!” Zoe shouted crazily.

Shelly gnashed her teeth and went forward to push Zoe away. At the same time, Zoe pushed Shelly away with all her might. Seeing that the two of them might start fighting again, Benjamin quickly protected Shelly and pushed Zoe

away.

Since there was a huge difference between a man’s strength and a woman’s, Benjamin made Zoe fall to the ground with one push when Shelly could not even push Zoe away no matter how hard she tried.

The moment Zoe fell to the ground, her expression changed, and the pain made her lie on the floor. She suddenly clutched her stomach and felt a heart-wrenching pain that almost made her faint.

Neither Benjamin nor Shelly noticed Zoe’s abnormality. At that moment, Benjamin even pulled Zoe up from the ground roughly and tried to push her out of Shelly’s house..
