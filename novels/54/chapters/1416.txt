Finn was so angry that she turned red.

“You can take it as me,” Monica responded indifferently.

Finn suddenly sneered. Did that mean whatever he said to Monica was useless?

“Monica, let’s not argue and fuss about who’s right or wrong, okay?!” Finn was so angry that he was about to explode, so he forced himself to calm down.

He said, “Let’s start anew. I promise that I will never ignore your feelings again and that I will be a competent boyfriend, a competent husband, and even a competent father-”

“I don’t care!” Monica rejected him.

It was as if his words had provoked her, and she suddenly became very agitated.

Finn’s heart was in so much pain that it felt numb.

She roared, “I don’t care about you or love you anymore! Stay away from me. I beg you, stay away from me!”

As Finn was trying his best to suppress his emotions, he thought, ‘How did I hurt her so badly?’

“Brandon, let’s go.” Monica tried her best to pull the car door open, but Finn was pushing on the door so hard that she could not pull it open at all.

Brandon was also trying his best to help Monica, but the door would not budge. Finn’s strength was truly astonishing.

Monica, who had been suppressing her emotions, was starting to crumble. She said, “Finn, will you give up if I have a boyfriend?”

Finn’s expression was extremely cold, and his bloodshot eyes were fixed on Monica.

“Yes, Brandon and I are together.” Monica suddenly admitted.

Her voice was very calm, as if she was stating a fact.

Finn’s hand that was pressing against the car door seemed to be trembling. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I didn’t want to tell you because I didn’t want it to be awkward between us. But since you’ve forced my hand, I’ll tell you frankly that Brandon and I are dating, and we’re going on a trip overseas. Now, do you understand why I was so keen on breaking up with you? Do you know now that whatever you do is useless to me? It’s because I’ve fallen in love with another man!” Monica’s voice grew louder and louder as she spoke.

By then, Finn’s expression was grim.

Brandon, on the other hand, froze because of what Monica said.

“Is that enough, Finn? If it’s not enough…” Monica suddenly reached out and wrapped her arms around Brandon’s neck.

Then, she stood on her toes and planted a kiss on Brandon’s lips.

Finn suddenly laughed, and a tear fell from his eyes. He said, “Monica, what was our relationship to you?”

Monica’s heart felt like it was being pricked by needles.

She looked at Finn and said, “It was never precious to me. After all, we were just forcing it on each other.”

What kind of relationship could last ten years if it was forced?

Finn looked at Monica, who said coldly, “I never thought there was any conflict between us. I thought that as long as we loved each other, we could break free from everything. However, only now do I know that’s not the case. The difference in family upbringing and background will make it difficult for two people to get along. I’m tired, and I’ve had enough. Right now, I just want someone who is of equal social status and knows me well so that I can live a simple and ordinary life. Brandon fulfills all the requirements I have for my other half.” Brandon met all her criteria while he was nothing to her.

Monica took the initiative and held Brandon’s hand with their fingers interlocked. Then, with her other hand, she pulled open the car door that Finn had already let go of.

“What was it that made you lose all hope in me?” Finn asked her.

Monica’s throat moved slightly.

“Was it that I was cruel to you after the divorce or that you couldn’t feel my love for you after we got back together?” Finn asked her.

However, Monica did not reply, trying to keep her emotions controlled.

“You have to let me know what I did wrong.” Finn looked at Monica.

By then, his vision was blurry..
