At that moment, Shelly was not afraid. In fact, she was angry at how evil Nox

was.

She said, “Do you want to watch the video?”

“Shelly!” Nox really wanted to strangle her.

Who did Shelly think she was? How dare she threaten him like that? “I’ll ask you one more time. Do you want to watch the video?”

“No!” Nox shouted back at her.

“It’s fine if you don’t want to watch it.” Shelly said bluntly, “If you don’t watch it, it means that you’ve tacitly approved of this video, and I’ve done what I promised you. From now on, whether it’s because you’re dissatisfied with this video and want me to re-record it or for any other reason, I won’t agree to it.

Don’t forget what you promised me.”

After saying that, Shelly turned around and left.

As Nox watched as Shelly walk away with such determination, he suddenly stepped forward and slammed the door that Shelly had opened shut. For a second, Shelly really wanted to kill Nox and take him down with her.

“Shelly, are you really not going to beg me?” Nox asked coldly.

He had given her so much time, but was she not going to beg him? Did she know how much of an impact it would have on her if the recording was exposed?

No one would think that her sudden clarification of the matter was a manifestation of her moral character. On the contrary, it would only attract the insults of the entire nation.

Did she know the consequences of doing that? Yet, she could accept it so calmly.

“What should I beg you for?” Shelly asked.

Nox really wanted to kill Shelly. Even though he was being scolded by the entire country, nothing could make him as angry as how cold Shelly was to him right now.

“So what if I beg you? If I do, will you not post this recording?” Shelly sneered, “It will only satisfy your evil intentions and the pleasure of having someone submit to you, Young Master Winter. It won’t change the outcome at all!”

“In your eyes, am I that bad of a person?” Nox asked her through gritted teeth.

He really wished he could bite her to death. Why right did Shelly have to look down on him?

“Unbearably bad!” Shelly enunciated each word.

Nox clenched his fists so tightly that even his bones seemed to be cracking. However, just when Shelly thought that Nox was going to beat her up, he suddenly let go of her.

Shelly looked at Nox, who seemed to be trying to calm himself down as he suddenly did not look agitated at all.

He said to the man in the room, “Since you think it’s okay, just put it up on the Internet.”

The man was stunned. For a second, he thought that Mr. Winter did not want to post the video at all. That was why the latter had not watched the video and had forced Shelly to beg him. It made the man wonder whether it was all too much of a blow for Nox or if was it because his pride could not take it.

“Are you deaf?” Nox was furious.

Frightened, the man quickly said, “Okay, I’ll arrange it immediately.”

As he spoke, he quickly took out his phone to make a call.

Nox’s throat moved slightly, and he turned around, only to see that Shelly had left the moment he let her go. There was no reluctance. It was as if what was going to happen next had nothing to do with her.

Nox clenched his fists again. Since Shelly did not mind, he had nothing to worry about, and since Shelly could be so shameless, there was no need for him to feel guilty!

Half an hour later, Shelly’s video was on the Internet. The plot twist again caused an uproar on the internet.

Recently, Nox’s popularity had far surpassed the top celebrities in the entertainment industry as everyone was talking about Nox.

The moment that video was released, Nox’s name was cleared, but Zoe had to bear the infamy. This time, it included Shelly, who was scolded as badly as Zoe!

Someone even read Nox’s fortune out of kindness and said that he was not suitable to be with any woman in his life.. He was suited to be alone until the day he died!
