1009 You Probably Wouldn’t Remember Me If I Didn’t Take the Initiative to Come To You

“Yes, I’ll make the arrangements immediately.”

Michael put down his phone and smiled sinisterly.

Ever since Monica agreed to let him introduce someone to Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and development department, he had already obtained the information of everyone in the Department. After the incident, he immediately started to bribe them, and now he had bribed more than half of them.

More than half of them were enough to ruin Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and development team.

A pharmaceutical company without a research and development team was like a pool of dead water. Even if Cardellini Pharmaceutical proved its innocence, it would not help the situation because no other hospital or pharmaceutical company would cooperate with them!

They would still go bankrupt when the time came!

It was still too early for Monica to kill him, and if she could not kill him, he would make her die a difficult death!

His eyes moved as he looked at his phone, which suddenly rang.

It was 2 a.m. at the moment, and Warren was calling him.

He picked up the call. “Leader.”

“Have you settled the matter?” Warren asked.

Cardellini Enterprise’s incident this time seemed to have really bothered him.

“Brie will be the instigator of this incident. Tomorrow morning, the evidence of her crime will be handed over to the police, and I just received news that Brie has been secretly dealt with. Since the police can’t find her, they’ll abscond and close the case. The other relevant personnel has already matched their statements,” Michael reported.

“Just because you saved yourself doesn’t mean I’m not biased against you.”

“I know that this was my mistake, so I’ll make up for it by making Cardellini Pharmaceutical go bankrupt immediately.”

“I hope nothing goes wrong this time.”

“Leader.” Michael’s tone was heavy.

“Is there anything else?”

“Monica can’t be that smart. She can’t possibly think of everything so thoroughly, and she can’t have changed into a different person so suddenly.”

“What are you trying to say?” Warren said sarcastically.

He thought that Michael was still trying to pitch him another idea.

“Someone is secretly helping Monica.” Michael paused for a moment before saying bluntly, “This person is Jeanne.”

He might not have been sure before, but from Monica’s performance today, he was 100 percent sure that someone was secretly helping Monica.

Otherwise, even if Monica could think of everything, she would never have thought to tell the Sanders to pay attention to this matter.

Jeanne was the only one who could come up with such a strategy. After all, Finn’s current attitude toward Monica was to stand by and do nothing. Hence, it could only be Jeanne.

On the other hand, when the other party heard Jeanne’s name, he fell silent for two seconds.

Michael continued, “I’ve mentioned it before, but you don’t seem to want me to talk about her, and I don’t want to make things difficult for you either. However, she has ruined all my plans. With her helping Monica, all my plans have failed again and again. If she’s not controlled, I’m worried that she’ll ruin my plan again.”

“I’ll handle it.” Warren agreed. “But Michael, this is not an excuse for your failure every time. I can help you this time, but if you fail again, I won’t give you any more chances!”

“If I fail this time, I’ll resign!” Michael promised.

The person on the other end of the line hung up abruptly!

Michael looked at the words “call ended” and sneered.

Without Jeanne around, Monica would not be able to withstand even a single blow

…

At 8 a.m. in the morning the next day, Jeanne left the hotel.

Gary’s surgery was today, so she wanted to go over earlier to accompany Monica.

Fortunately, a certain someone did not stay last night. Otherwise, with a certain someone’s nature, she might have to crawl to the hospital.

She walked into the hotel’s underground parking lot and directly walked toward the car that she had driven away from Monica.

Just as she walked over, she could feel something was off. Without even stopping, she turned around and wanted to leave in the opposite direction.

She had just taken two steps when two men in black suits appeared in front of her, blocking her way.

With that, she took two steps back and planned to leave in another direction. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, ten people walked out from her surroundings and surrounded her.

Jeanne pursed her lips tightly and looked at these people warily.

A man in the lead walked up to Jeanne and bowed, appearing extremely respectful. “Third Young Lady, the leader is looking for you.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

That meant they were Warren’s men.

She asked, “Must I go?”

“Yes,” the man replied coldly.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“This way please, Third Young Lady.” Without her permission, the man bent down slightly and pointed at a black car next to him.

At that moment, in front of the car door, another man in a black suit opened the door for her respectfully.

“I need to make a phone call,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Yes.” The man waited respectfully.

Jeanne dialed a number.

The other party quickly picked up. “Jeannie.”

“Monica, I can’t accompany you anymore.”

Monica was a little disappointed. “Don’t you leave in a week?”

“Change of plans.”

Monica did not say anything.

“I don’t know when we’ll meet again after we leave this time.” Jeanne said bluntly, “But remember, you’re all grown up now. You must learn to take on anything that comes your way.”

“Yes.” Monica nodded.

“You can do anything. You have to believe in yourself!”

“Jeannie.” Monica choked up.

“Yes?”

“Will I be able to see you again?” Monica asked.

Would they be able to see each other again in this life?

“Maybe.” Jeanne did not give her a definite answer because she was not sure.

Instead, she said, “Monica, goodbye.”

“We must meet again,” Monica said urgently.

Jeanne said yes, but she said it in her heart.

After ending the call, Jeanne turned around and followed the man in the black suit into the car!
