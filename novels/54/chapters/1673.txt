Chapter 1674: Jeanne Makes Her Move

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It took all of Nox’s brain cells to work for him to finally come up with an affectionate confession essay.

For someone like him who did not know how to write and found writing torturing, he wrote quite a bit in the end. Although the sentences did not make sense sometimes, he still expressed what needed to be expressed.

Jeanne read it for a while, and Nox waited for Jeanne’s reaction on the phone. For some reason, he was very nervous, just like when he was young and waiting for his teacher to mark his homework. He could not believe courting a woman could make him feel that way!

“So?” Nox was getting so anxious that he could not calm down. After reading it, Jeanne said, “Sure.”

“Really?” Nox was shocked. He did not expect it to pass in one draft.

He thought that according to Jeanne’s strict standards, he would have to make at least 10 drafts, so he found it hard to believe that it was passed in one draft.

“Really.” Jeanne said bluntly, “It’s not bad. It’s much better than I expected.”

Nox instantly smiled. That man was very easy to satisfy, and he even said smugly, “I can’t help it. I’m just that talented.”

Jeanne could not be bothered to burst his bubble and tell him that it was not talent but rather, true feelings. His words may be simple, but because he wrote with his true feelings, it was touching. That was also the reason why Jeanne was reading it for a long time.

In reality, Jeanne had told Nox to write it not only because she wanted to use it, but also because she wanted to know if Nox truly liked Shelly. After all, Nox had too many records. If it were just for fun, there was no need for her to help Nox break up a couple. She, too, would feel guilty. However, if he truly liked her, even if it was a little immoral, she could convince herself to understand it because it was true love.

“Should we post it now?” Nox asked enthusiastically. After getting Jeanne’s approval, Nox was on cloud nice.

“No.” Jeanne rejected him directly.

“No? If I don’t post it, how am I going to let Shelly know that I like her?” Nox did not understand what Jeanne wanted to do.

“No matter what you write now, you’ll never convince Shelly that you like her. Instead, she’ll think that you’re deliberately making things difficult for her and be more disgusted by your actions.” Jeanne explained it clearly. “I didn’t tell you to write the essay for Shelly.”

“That was not what you said to me just now!” Nox threw a fit again.

He had used up everything in him to write that essay, but it turned out that Jeanne was toying with him!

“If I didn’t say it was for Shelly, would you have written it?”

“In that case, who are you showing it to? Damn it, don’t tell me it’s just to satisfy your evil interests!” Nox questioned.

Jeanne rolled her eyes and said, “You don’t have to worry about it. I’ll try my best to help you.” “What exactly are you trying to do?”

“I won’t tell you yet.”

‘Why?”

“It’s too despicable. I don’t want a single soul to know.”

Nox was speechless.

“Anyway, just wait for my news.” Jeanne immediately hung up the phone, not wasting any more time.

After hanging up, she quickly gave Edward a call. “Ed.”

“Jeannie, it’s rare for you to think of me.”

She pursed her lips and said, “I’m going out tonight, so I won’t be eating at home. I’ll leave the two children to you.”

Edward was unhappy.

“I’ll try my best to come back early.” Jeanne could also sense Edward’s emotions.

That man could be really petty sometimes. “What are you doing out at night?” Edward asked.

“To do something big.”

“Huh?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

“For Nox.” Jeanne was also speechless.

“What are you going to do for him?”

“Is Nox your friend? Didn’t you see the news about him?”

“Oh, I did,” Edward replied.

It was clear that he had seen it but did not take it to heart. She felt sorry for Nox for how indifferent Edward was to him. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After all, Nox would do anything for Edward, but Edward, on the other hand… If she were Nox, she would be so angry at him.

“You can tell that Nox is having a hard time.” Jeanne said, “That’s why I’m helping him..”
