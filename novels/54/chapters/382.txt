Chapter 383: I Won’t Let You Be Abused

In this life, she would probably never be able to escape from Finn’s shadow.

She reached out to open the door to the warehouse. However, just as she opened it, she screamed, “Ah!”

Someone suddenly grabbed her hand roughly, and the warehouse door slammed shut again.

Monica looked at the man in front of her.

It was one of the men who was supposed to be fighting and had suddenly come over to shackle her.

At that moment, Finn also noticed it and pulled back his fist.

The moment he pulled back his fist, he took a punch. However, he did not seem to feel it at all. Instead, he rushed to Monica’s side and kicked the man who shackled Monica in the face. As a result, the man lost his balance and fell to the ground.

Finn reacted quickly.

He quickly opened the door to the warehouse and used all his strength to push Monica out.

The moment he pushed her out, Finn slammed the door shut again. Then, he pressed his body against the door and blocked them from chasing after Monica.

The bearded man walked to Finn, his face stained with blood.

After that, he reached out and punched Finn’s face.

Finn did not fight back. Instead, he just pushed himself against the door and used all his strength to block the door so that they could not go out.

......

“You really aren’t afraid of death!” The bearded man punched Finn’s face again.

Finn’s face was covered in blood, and his eyes were bleeding, but he still did not move.

The bearded man’s face darkened.

With a look from him, the two men at the side quickly grabbed Finn’s body and dragged him to the side.

However, no matter how hard they tried or hit him, Finn did not budge.

No matter what they did, he would not let go of the door before him.

“Damn it! You have guts!” The bearded man was so furious that he went forward and frantically pulled Finn’s body away from the door.

At the same time, the two men next to him used all their strength to pull Finn’s hand away from the handle of the warehouse door.

Only with three of their strengths did they manage to throw Finn to the ground.

Just like that, Finn fell and was bleeding profusely.

He reckoned that Monica should be quite far away now. Since it was dark, it might not be easy for those people to chase after her.

That was his limit.

Monica was really his limit.

After Finn was thrown to the ground, the bearded man had his two subordinates quickly chase after her.

The bearded man’s expression was grim. He had been in the mercenary business for so long and had never failed before. More importantly, this was a mission that did not require murdering, yet he messed it up. How was he going to get a job in the future?

He suppressed his anger and waited for a long while until the two men returned.

At that, the bearded man’s expression darkened. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The man said respectfully, “Boss, we didn’t see anyone!”

“Trash!” The bearded man punched one of the men in the face. “How far can a woman run?”

“It’s too dark outside. I don’t even know which direction she ran in,” the man explained.

“Damn it!” The bearded man also knew that, but he just wanted to vent his emotions.

Then, he turned his head and glared at Finn, who was abnormally still on the ground.

At that moment, it really did look as if he was dead.

Finn, indeed, had no strength to resist, and he had also overheard them saying that Monica was nowhere to be found.

Therefore, Monica was safe.

“Kid.” The bearded man squatted down and approached Finn.

Finn was lying on the ground with his eyes closed.

“You really impressed me.” The bearded man reached out and grabbed Finn’s neck.

Finn felt a suffocating pain.

Instinctively, he opened his eyes. They were blood red.

“I didn’t want to kill you.” The bearded man kept applying force to his hand.

However, Finn did not resist or have the strength to resist anymore. He simply looked at the bearded man ferociously and into the murderous intent in his eyes.

“But you made me mess up my mission. If I don’t vent a little, I won’t be able to take this lying down,” the bearded man said.

As he spoke, his grip tightened and tightened.

By then, Finn had given up struggling.

He had silently accepted the fact that the air was feeling thinner and thinner. Perhaps in the next second, he would leave this world.

Suddenly, the warehouse door was pushed open.
