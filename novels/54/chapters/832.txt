The leaves around were swept off the ground.

They danced in the sky.

“Put Jeanne down!” Kingsley looked at Edward coldly.

Edward did not let go and brought Jeanne closer to the helicopter.

“I said, let go of Jeanne!” Kingsley spoke coldly in a cold tone.

He glared at Edward with bloodthirsty eyes.

“If you don’t want to get to the point where we die together, let me go!” Jeanne spoke, reminding Edward.

She knew very well.

Kingsley would not be threatened all the time.

He would also have his limits.

Once his limits were breached, he would not even care about his own life, let alone others.

Edward’s hand, which was holding the gun, clearly froze.

“We can’t go back to how we were before.” Jeanne’s tone was cold.

They could not go back to the past. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Therefore, there was no need to take her away.

Edward had a cold look, and his Adam’s apple kept moving up and down.

“I don’t want to die. Let me go,” Jeanne uttered word by word.

At this moment, she even began to twist her body to resist.

Edward had been suppressing his emotions. He said, “Jeanne, take care of yourself.”

‘Take care of myself?!

‘So.

‘In order to live.

‘He’ll still choose to let go.’

It was true.

Jeanne had never thought of going back with Edward.

It was true.

They could not go back to how things were.

Even so…

Even so…

Edward still let her go.

In order to live.

For each other’s sake.

Kingsley was right.

Being on opposing sides meant that they would not have a good ending.

Either Jeanne died, or Edward.

Or, they would die together.

Jeanne did not respond to Edward.

It was no longer suitable to talk about feelings between them.

They would have to die if they did.

Jeanne said, “The grudge between us has nothing to do with George.”

George was still in South Hampton City, and he was still with Edward.

Jeanne did not want George to be involved.

Furthermore, she could not take George away, and she did not think that Edward would send him back to her.

Despite that, she felt that George would be safe by Edward’s side.

As long as Edward promised her that he would not hurt George.

“George is my son.” Edward gave her an affirmative answer.

Jeanne nodded.

All she wanted was a promise from Edward.

It could be considered his way of compensating her for being saved by her even after scheming against her.

Jeanne could feel Edward slowly letting go of her.

Finn had gotten into the helicopter at this moment.

Edward brought her to the door and let go of her completely.

Next, Edward quickly boarded the helicopter.

The hatch closed, and the helicopter slowly took off.

The strong wind caused Jeanne to lose her balance.

However, she did not leave at that moment.

She just watched the helicopter get further and further away from her.

After this, the next time they met, they would be enemies.

They would be complete enemies.

Kingsley walked to Jeanne’s side. She turned to look at him.

Jeanne turned to look at Kingsley.

She did not know what else to say to Kingsley.

Jeanne let Edward go and did not know the whereabouts of the Duncans’ descendant. She did not know how Kingsley would explain this to the Sanders.

She said, “I’m sorry.”

‘I’m sorry, Kingsley.’

Jeanne had always disappointed him.

Kingsley just looked at her.

He just looked.

In the end, he did not say anything.

He was probably so disappointed that he could not say a word to Jeanne.

Kingsley turned around and walked in front.

They drove through the forest and left Harkens’ border.

In the future, it would probably be very difficult for them to come back.

…

The helicopter hovered in the sky.

Edward looked down at Jeanne, watching her get smaller and further away from him.

There was still not much emotion on his face.

He still did not show much emotion.

Edward seemed to have gotten used to keeping everything to himself, and all outsiders could see was his indifference.

His eyes moved slightly.

Finn was examining Edward’s body at the moment. He found the first aid kit on the helicopter and began to treat Edward’s wounds.

Jeanne had treated Edward last night, but the bandages had now been drenched in blood. If they were not dealt with, he would get infected easily.

However, the most important thing at this time was to remove the bullet in his thigh.

Finn cut open Edward’s pants and looked at the bullet that had penetrated his thigh. He saw that there was pus coming out of the flesh that was penetrated.

He said, “I couldn’t find any anesthetic.”

Edward responded to him.

Jeanne had explained it to him yesterday.

Killers never used anesthetics.
