When she went to wake Bella up, Bella opened her eyes in a daze. “Mommy, I want to sleep.”

“Be good. Let’s get up and eat breakfast.” Shelly coaxed Bella.

Although Bella was unwilling, she agreed obediently.

Shelly carried Bella to wash up and help her get dressed before they walked out of the bedroom. By then, Katie had made porridge and placed it on the dining table.

“Shelly, Bella, come over and have breakfast.” Katie was very enthusiastic.

Shelly carried Bella over. Seeing the three bowls of porridge on the dining table, Bella wrinkled her little nose, not very happy.

Katie asked, “Shelly, where’s the honey?”

Shelly had a vivid memory from her childhood that back in their hometown, breakfast was usually porridge with honey.

At that, she said, “There’s none at home. I’ll go down to get some and buy some buns while I’m at it.”

“Alright,” Katie replied.

Then, Shelly said to Bella, “Bella, be good and eat the porridge first. I will buy you your favorite milk buns.”

“Alright.” Bella nodded obediently.

As Shelly walked to the door, she said to Katie, “Keep an eye on Bella for me.” “Don’t worry.” Katie quickly nodded.

Shelly did not think too much about it either. Just like that, she walked out of the house and went downstairs to buy some honey and milk buns.

At the thought that Katie might not have had milk buns in the countryside before, she bought quite a few, hoping that Katie would eat more. Hence, she went home with a few more milk buns in her hands.

However, as soon as she returned home, she was stunned! There was no one at home, not Bella or Katie.

She hurriedly ran into the bedroom. “Bella! Bella!”

When no one responded, she rushed into the room where Katie had slept last night. Seeing that Katie’s clothes were no longer in the room, she suddenly had a bad premonition about it.

She whipped out her phone and dialed a number. At that moment, even her fingers were trembling. She quickly and anxiously dialed Katie’s number, but a mechanical voice came from the other end of the phone, saying that it was switched off.

Then, she hurriedly ran out of the house. However, there was no sign of Bella or Katie in the entire neighborhood or at the entrance. Her eyes were red from the panic, and she was on the verge of breaking down.

She knew very well that Katie had left with Bella, but she could not let Katie take Bella away. Hence, she told herself to calm down. Since Katie had taken Bella back to her hometown, she would follow them to her hometown now.

With that thought in mind, she quickly returned home to get her wallet with her identity card and bank cards. She did not even bring a change of clothes before she left the house, hailed a taxi, and went straight to the train station.

She knew that Katie would definitely catch the train and not take a flight. However, when she went to the train station, she could not find them anywhere. Left with no choice, she gritted her teeth and took a taxi to the airport.

The train ride would take 12 hours, whereas a flight would only take four hours. If she took a flight, she could just go straight to the train station there and wait for Katie to show up.

She thought about it and quickly bought a return ticket back to the city. Including the waiting time to board the plane, it took Shelly six hours to get to the airport and another hour to get to the train station.

She calculated the time and figured out that Katie would arrive in six hours by train at the earliest. Therefore, she waited at the exit, not letting anyone off.

At the seven-hour mark, the trucks from South Hampton City had made several trips, but Katie was still nowhere to be seen. She kept calling Katie until her phone was almost out of battery.

However, she did not dare to go to the train station to rent a power bank as she was afraid that she would miss Katie if she turned around. Knowing that Katie would definitely take the train back, she told herself to calm down.

She kept waiting, and 12 hours later, Shelly finally saw Katie coming out of the train station at 3 a.m. She was so excited that she hurried over and grabbed Katie, who was coming out of the station. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Katie jumped in fright, and when she saw Shelly clearly, she was shocked.

“Why are you here?” Katie asked in horror.

“Where’s Bella? Where’s Bella?” Shelly asked directly, not wasting any more time with Katie.

Katie’s eyes flickered, and she did not answer for a long time.

“I’m asking you, where is Bella?” Shelly roared, her expression ugly.

Shocked, Katie quickly said, “Isn’t Bella with you? Why are you here now- Ah!”
