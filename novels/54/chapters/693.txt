Chapter 694: Letting Go: Sorry I Made You Feel Disgusted

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Suddenly, her heart began to race as she seemed to have felt the person on her moving.

She unconsciously gripped the blanket tightly.

She knew Finn was about to wake up and hoped that he would wake up, but she was afraid at the same time…

In the end, she bit her lips, trying to calm herself down and watching Finn open his eyes.

She looked straight at him, and when he did not react for a long time, she thought she was hallucinating.

In fact, Finn did not seem to be aware of what he was doing last night. All he did was relieve himself from the side effects of the drug, so he probably did not know who the woman he slept with was. It was even possible that he did not know what he did last night.

Otherwise, she would not feel so panicked at that moment, so much that she could not believe what she was seeing in front of her.

Monica was hurt by Finn’s appearance because it looked as if he had touched something dirty, and she could see him breaking down!

“Finn, last night we really– Ah...” Monica shouted.

Before she could say the word “did it”, Monica felt a pain in her neck.

The moment she thought they could get back together, Finn’s hand gripped her neck tightly, suffocating her.

She looked straight at Finn and his ferocious appearance with his veins popping out. She also saw the intense killing intent in his bloodthirsty eyes.

He would not reconcile with her even after they slept together.

He would really kill her like he once said he would if she got close to him again. Therefore, it was not a lie.

“Let go of me... Oh, Finn. Let go of me...” Monica felt a pain in her neck as she struggled to get rid of Finn’s grip.

She even felt that it was getting more and more difficult for her to breathe. It made her so frightened that tears started to flow out of her eyes.

As it was getting harder and harder for her to breathe, she looked at Finn’s cruel face, which did not look like he had any intention to hold himself back.

He looked cold-blooded and heartless, with only killing intent in his eyes.

Monica’s tears blurred her vision. It turned out that all her fantasies were just wishful thinking.

Reality always failed her.

The moment she thought Finn would strangle her to death, he suddenly let go of her.

“Cough, cough, cough...” Monica could not stop her body from trembling and herself from crying and being terrified.

For the first time, death was so close to her that she could touch it.

She breathed heavily and kept coughing.

However, Finn did not even look at her. All he did was lift the blanket and get up from Monica’s body.

The moment he got up, he saw the bruises on Monica’s body... As he looked at it, he suddenly rushed into the bathroom.

From the bathroom came sounds of Finn’s heart-wrenching vomiting, and bursts of retching sound rang out ferociously in the room.

Just like that, Monica listened to Finn vomiting in the bathroom.

All her expectations were shattered the moment Finn wanted to kill her, and all the happy memories were shattered by Finn’s disgusting vomiting.

To Finn, was having sex with her so unforgivable? Was having sex with her so disgusting?

Why did she feel so happy last night? Her heart hurt, and she felt disappointed.

After some time, the vomiting in the bathroom stopped.

Finn sat next to the toilet and just sat there. His face was pale, and his fists were clenched tightly.

Last night… He could not recall what he did last night!

When he opened his eyes, he saw Monica naked…

“Bam!”

Finn punched the wall beside him fiercely.

There was a sudden sound, and even the bathroom door and windows shook a few times!

At that moment, he even saw... a faint blood stain on the white floor of the bathroom that kept magnifying before his eyes and triggering his nerves!

“Am I that disgusting to you?” A familiar female voice came from the bathroom door.

Finn’s eyes moved.

He looked at her with his bloodshot eyes and saw her standing in front of him in a bathrobe.

“Get lost,” Finn said.

His words stabbed Monica’s heart.

No. Actually, she could not feel pain anymore.

From the moment he wanted to kill her, she no longer felt pain.

She shouted at Finn, “Finn, if it weren’t for me last night, you would’ve died! What right do you have to treat me like this–”
