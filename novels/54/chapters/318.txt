Chapter 319: Set a Date for the Wedding

Therefore, she had no concept of money.

If she knew she would be sent abroad, and if she knew she would be so miserable, perhaps she would not have refused.

Then, she would have been dismissed by Old Master Swan in a few sentences.

The sentence she remembered the most was, “Edward is also a Swan, and he will help the Swans. Don’t embarrass yourself.”

That was what Old Master Swan told Jeanne when he kicked her out of the family.

After that, she gave up.

She gave up the struggle.

She gave up on making meaningless struggles.

She admitted that she was too weak to fight against anyone. Hence, when the Lawrences gave her a plane ticket to leave South Hampton City, she left.

From then on, she buried what happened with Fourth Master Swan in her memories.

She even remembered a lot of things but not that she slept with Fourth Master Swan.

No matter what, Eden cheated on her, she was maliciously slandered by the media, and she even resisted like crazy because she was unwilling to accept it. However, seducing Fourth Master Swan was her initiative, and she felt stupid for doing so.

When she returned to the country seven years later, she did not think she and Fourth Master Swan would cross paths again.

......

Whether it was the pride in her or Kingsley’s instruction, all she wanted was to keep a distance from Fourth Master Swan.

However, she was about to get married now.

She looked at Old Master Swan, and when she saw his expressionless face, she was speechless.

In any case… in everyone’s eyes, she was seducing Fourth Master Swan, and she did not want to explain herself anymore.

For a moment, the room was pin-drop silent.

Suddenly, Zachary said, “I don’t want Edward to know about what happened seven years ago. Ms. Lawrence, you should know what I mean.”

Of course, she understood.

She was not as thoughtless as to destroy the father and son relationship. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Today is my first time seeing you here,” Jeanne expressed her stance.

Zachary nodded as he, too, knew that Jeanne was a sensible person. Then, he said, “It’s better to call me uncle.”

Jeanne was stunned, but eventually, she said, “Uncle Zachary.”

“Yes,” Zachary replied. “It’s getting late. You should head back and get some rest.”

Jeanne turned around.

“Edward likes you very much. Don’t let him down.”

Behind her, Old Master Swan’s deep and heavy voice sounded.

Jeanne hummed in response when in reality, she did not know. She did not know what would happen in the end!

With that, Jeanne walked out of the tea room.

Edward was waiting for her in the main room, so she walked straight toward Edward and smiled. “Let’s go.”

Edward’s eyes moved a little as if he was sizing her up. He probably wanted to know what Old Master Swan said to her.

Nevertheless, she took the initiative to hold Fourth Master Swan’s hand and pulled him away.

The two of them walked out of Universe Garden, which was about a ten-minute walk to Bamboo Garden.

The two walked hand in hand in the Swans’ huge garden.

The first time Jeanne came to the Swans, she felt that the Swans... was too overbearing.

When she was dating Eden back then, she thought if she were to live in a place like that in the future, she would probably get lost.

Now, she was really going to move in.

“What did my dad say to you?” Edward suddenly asked.

Jeanne smiled. “Do you want to know?”

“Yes.”

“Actually, he didn’t say much.”

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

“He wants me to treat you better.”

Edward did not believe it.

Jeanne said, “Your dad said that you like me very much and told me not to let you down.”

Edward began to feel emotional.

“I used to think that Old Master Swan was invincible, that he’s the kind of person who doesn’t recognize his own kin, and that his existence is beyond mortals. But today, I suddenly feel that he is just an ordinary father who treats you pretty well.”

Edward seemed to have hummed in agreement, but he did not say anything else.

Jeanne did not want to be so emotional. She changed the topic. “I might not be able to pay for such an expensive dowry.”

Edward was stunned. He did not expect Jeanne to change the topic so quickly.

Jeanne said, “Most of my money is actually from Kingsley, and what’s mine is probably only a fraction of that.”

A fraction of that was only a few billion.

Even if she went bankrupt, it would not be able to match the wedding gifts that Fourth Master Swan gave her.

“Do you think I want your money?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

“I don’t need money. George is enough,” Edward suddenly said.

Jeanne was stunned.

“I’m very happy with your son,” Edward said straightforwardly. “So, I don’t need anything else. Just bring George with you when you marry me.”

“Fourth Master, actually...” Jeanne wanted to say something but hesitated.

Edward waited for her next words.

“It’s better not to be too confident.”

Edward chucked and did not care too much about it.
