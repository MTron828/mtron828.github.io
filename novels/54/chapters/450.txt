Chapter 451: Eden Humiliated, With No Place To Hide

Edward’s eyes were cold.

However, Henry could not care less either.

As he made a call, Edward looked at him coldly.

Meanwhile, everyone was silent.

Henry picked up the phone. “Dad, there’s something I need to report to you.”

“Okay,” the person on the other end of the phone answered.

“It’s like this. Because of Jasmine, Eden made a small mistake, which may have caused some losses to the company. However, Eden realized his mistake and promised not to do it again. But now, Edward and his wife are not showing Eden any mercy and want to send him to prison. If that happens, Eden’s life will be ruined–”

“The company has been handed over to Edward, so he will handle anything work-related.”

After saying that, the call disconnected.

Henry’s entire body froze.

He originally wanted to ask Old Master Swan to help save him from humiliation. After all, Eden was the son of Old Master Swan’s eldest son. Old Master Swan may not treat Eden very well, but he still valued him, and there was no way he would ignore Eden. However, at that moment…

Henry’s hand that was holding his phone trembled.

The senior management meeting room was pin-drop silent.

......

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She glanced at her phone and saw a pop-up message on the phone that she had turned to silent mode. After that, she looked at Henry again.

Everyone seemed to be waiting for an answer from Henry. However, he did not say a single word for a long time.

At that moment, Eden was starting to be afraid.

If his grandfather wanted to help him, his father would not have that expression on his face. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

No.

He could not go to jail, not even if he was dead. He was the young master of the Swans. How could he go to jail?

After that, how could he gain a foothold in South Hampton City? How could he look the others in the eye?

He looked at his father in panic. “Father, what did grandfather say? Is he going to come over now?”

That was his only hope. He knew very well that if Jeanne wanted to be vicious, she would really send him to jail.

Meanwhile, Henry was trying hard to hold back his anger. Then, he suddenly turned around and punched Eden hard in the face.

Caught off guard, Eden was almost knocked off his feat.

However, as if Henry still had not vented all his anger, he punched Eden fiercely, again and again.

Everyone in the room was stunned.

After a while, someone came forward to stop Henry.

Elaine pulled Henry back while Richard protected Eden.

“Henry, calm down,” Richard called out to him.

“Calm down? How can I calm down knowing Eden did such a thing? Instead of sending him to prison and disgracing the Swans, I might as well kill him right now! A life for a life. I will die with him!”

As he said that, he was about to rush over and beat Eden up again.

Eden was in an extremely pathetic state, and he had never in his life been humiliated like that.

What was more, he had fallen from grace in front of so many of Swan Enterprise’s senior management.

“Henry! Henry! Calm down...” Richard and Elaine kept trying to persuade him.

The scene was chaotic.

“Actually, we don’t have to send Eden to prison.” Among the chaos, a clear female voice suddenly sounded.

Henry was still raising her fist to hit Eden. However, when he heard Jeanne, he stopped.

Jeanne said, “Although Eden made a mistake, he doesn’t have to be sent to prison if he can learn from his mistakes and make up for the losses.”

Henry glared fiercely at Jeanne.

Eden was also looking at her, not knowing what kind of tricks that woman was playing.

Faced with their doubts, Jeanne was very calm. “Eden is a first-time offender, and I also got to know that Eden is very capable in Swan Enterprise. Even though the Swans should be responsible for the tens of thousands of Swan Enterprise’s employees and get equal treatment if they did something wrong, I have to say that letting Eden go straight to prison will also be a loss for the company. Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons, Eden can choose another way to resolve this matter.”

Jeanne was the one who said he should be sent to prison, and now, she was also the one who said he could resolve the matter in another way.

It seemed like she had the final say in everything.

Eden suppressed his anger. At this moment, he did not dare to refute Jeanne’s words for fear that the woman would suddenly go back on her word.

“How do we resolve this?” Henry quickly asked.

As long as Eden did not have to go to prison, everything would be fine.

“Eden should make up for all the losses he caused,” Jeanne said.
