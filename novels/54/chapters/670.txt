Chapter 671: Conspiracy Theory: She Can Only Belong To Him!

He gritted his teeth and said fiercely to Joshua, “Give me the deputy position.”

Joshua was a little unresponsive as his attention was all on Jeanne. Seeing her acting so arrogantly, he really wanted to strangle her to death.

However, Joshua was not the only one who felt that way. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jenifer, who had accompanied Joshua, was also shocked by everyone’s support for Jeanne.

Before this, she did not know about the internal situation of the Lawrence Enterprise. She thought that no matter what, Alexander’s presence in Lawrence Enterprise would not have allowed Jeanne to thrive, and even if she did, she would not have thrived so much. However, she did not expect all the shareholders would vote for Jeanne.

Voting for Jeanne could only mean that all the years Alexander had been in Lawrence Enterprise could not compare to Jeanne’s three months!

After all, everyone knew that Jeanne and Alexander did not get along, so anyone who supported Alexander would choose to support Joshua!

Jenifer tried to suppress her emotions.

“Joshua!” Eden called out to Joshua from the other end of the phone.

Only then did Joshua come back to his senses.

“The Lawrence Enterprise is currently in a period of turmoil, so I’m requesting an additional deputy position.” Eden enunciated each word with a pause in between, and he said it through his gritted teeth!

That way, Jeanne would be his superior, and he had to work under Jeanne.

If word got out about that, he would be utterly humiliated. However, to get himself into Lawrence Enterprise, he could only bear the humiliation.

Joshua listened to Eden’s orders and hurriedly said to everyone, “Since everyone recognizes Jeanne’s talent, I will naturally follow everyone’s opinion.”

Jeanne smiled.

His words sounded nice, but there was nothing he could do about it.

“However, because of the matter between my grandfather and my father, the Lawrence Enterprise is in great turmoil. Jeanne may be capable, but under such circumstances, I don’t trust fully that Jeanne alone can turn the tide. So, it is still my hope that Eden joins our company to help us get through this critical period.” Joshua said to everyone, “My idea is that Jeanne will be appointed as Lawrence Enterprise’s executive general manager and hire Eden as the deputy general manager. That way, two capable people can manage the Lawrence Enterprise together and ensure the development of the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“Your proposal is good, but is Eden willing to do that? He’s the dignified Eldest Young Master Swan. Is he willing to take up a deputy role in Lawrence Enterprise?” a shareholder asked.

“Eden is not who you think he is. All he wants is to help our company develop. After all, he’s also the son-in-law of Lawrence Enterprise. If something happens to Lawrence Enterprise, he will naturally be the first to come to our help. He won’t care so much about his reputation and status, unlike some people.” Joshua was deliberately mocking Jeanne.

However, Jeanne did not take Joshua seriously.

What crossed her mind now was that Eden had really thought of every possible way to get himself into Lawrence Enterprise.

Did he really think that Lawrence Enterprise would belong to him if he entered Lawrence Enterprise?

He might have been able to previously, but now, she had changed up most of the company’s senior management. If he wanted to interfere with Lawrence Enterprise’s affairs, he would be making a fool of himself.

“If that’s the case...” The shareholders looked at each other. “Of course, that’ll be best.”

“How about this? I’ll call Eden right now and ask him in front of all of you shareholders. If he’s willing, it’s fine, but if he’s not, we won’t make things difficult for him,” Joshua suggested.

“Okay,” the shareholders agreed.

Joshua quickly took out his cell phone, dialed the number, and put the call on speakerphone.

“Eden.” The call went through, and Joshua called out to Eden.

“Joshua.” Eden’s gentle and steady voice came through the phone.

“It’s like this. Didn’t you say you want to help Lawrence Enterprise get through this difficult time? I originally proposed at the shareholders’ meeting today that you come work as the executive general manager. However, considering that Jeanne is more familiar with the internal working of the company, she will take over. However, do you think you can come work as the deputy general manager and help Jeanne manage the Lawrence Enterprise together?”

“Of course,” Eden agreed immediately.

The shareholders were surprised by his quick reply.

As for Jeanne, she knew very well what kind of show that family was putting on.

“In that case, it’s decided.”

“Okay.” Eden nodded. “The position is not important. As the son-in-law of the Lawrences, I’m obliged to help the family through the difficult times.”

“Thank you, Eden.” Joshua looked very happy.

“You’re welcome. When can I come to work?”

“Today.”

“I’ll take care of my work first and come to the company after that.”

“Sure.”

After that, Joshua hung up the phone and said to Jeanne in particular, “I told you, Eden is different from some people.”
