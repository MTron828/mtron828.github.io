Chapter 332: The Wedding: Jeanne, My Heart!

In the first half, Jeanne thought that Monica was going on the right track, but in the second half…

She had thought too much of Monica in the first half.

Seemingly very satisfied with Jeanne’s getup today, the corners of Edward’s mouth lifted into a smile.

Then, he walked over. Just as he was about to pick up Jeanne and leave, Monica suddenly jumped in front of Edward.

“How could it be so easy?” Monica stood between them with lots of envelopes in her hands.

“Ms. Cardellini, do you have any other requests?”

“Monica, it’s getting late. We must be at the Swan family’s manor at 11:18 am. If we don’t, we’ll be late!” Nox reminded her.

“I know. I know what to do.” Monica glanced at Nox unhappily.

Nox did not even know how such a mature Jeanne had Monica as her best friend. No matter how he saw it, he found Monica like a monkey and completely incompatible with Jeanne’s personality.

He could not understand it.

However, what he could not understand more was how Monica had subdued Finn too.

Was Monica poisonous?

Monica was not in the mood to deal with Nox’s nonsensical thought, so she looked at Edward and said, “Kasan.”

......

Monica suddenly called out to a staff member in the room.

She had discussed it with the staff member when Jeanne was putting on her makeup.

“Ms. Cardellini.” Kasan quickly walked to them with a plate of candies in hand.

Monica took one of the candies from the plate.

There was a rope on the candy, so it was obvious that she had something in mind.

She smiled cunningly. “The two of you, eat this piece of candy together, and you have to finish it.”

Jeanne frowned.

At that moment, she saw Monica hold the rope and place the candy in front of the two of them, next to their lips. It was as if…

Jeanne glanced at Edward. She thought that if he did not like it, they did not have to do it. Unexpectedly, Edward bent down and leaned over, wanting to eat the candy.

Monica was quick-witted and quickly held the candy up.

Then, Edward’s lips were pressed directly onto Jeanne’s lips.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat, and she looked at Fourth Master Swan, who was so close to her, looking at him looking at her in the same way.

They both looked at each other with their lips pressed tightly together.

After a long while…

“Fourth Master, is Jeannie’s mouth sweeter than candy?” Monica could not help but tease.

They both had been kissing each other for too long that it made Jeanne a little embarrassed.

She moved slightly and parted with Fourth Master Swan’s lips.

Suddenly, Fourth Master Swan pursed his lips and even used his tongue to lick his lips after.

Monica was standing very close to them, so she saw it all.

Fourth Master Swan was really f*cking perverted and seductive. If her heart did not belong to someone else, and if Fourth Master Swan was not Jeannie’s man, she might have been seduced. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She just watched as Jeannie was teased until her little face was completely red, which contrasted with her white gown.

“The taste isn’t bad,” Fourth Master Swan said pensively.

The moment he said it, even Monica’s face turned red.

Jeanne was doomed!

Monica could not help but secretly sigh. Jeannie would definitely fall into Fourth Master Swan’s hands for her entire life.

Speaking of which… who the hell said that Fourth Master Swan was cold and abstinent?

At that moment, she looked at Jeannie, who looked like she was... about to erupt!

She snapped back to her senses.

“Hey, I told you guys to eat candy. Who said you could eat each other’s mouths?” Monica said bluntly.

The moment she said it, everyone laughed, and Jeanne laughed even more awkwardly.

“Go on.” Monica placed the candies in front of the two of them again.

This time, Edward’s eyes narrowed, and he took a bite out of it the next second.

“Ah!” Monica was shocked.

How was the fellow so accurate? She had not had enough fun yet!

By then, the candy was already in Edward’s mouth, and he pulled the rope out of her mouth to eat the candy.

“Is there any more?” Fourth Master Swan asked.

Nope.

That was all she had prepared. At first, she thought they would have to leave even before they completed everything she had prepared, not expecting that Fourth Master Swan would complete it so quickly.

She was, in fact, a little unhappy when suddenly, an idea struck her. Stars shone in her eyes.

When Jeanne saw Monica’s eyes, she knew something was off again.

On the other hand, Edward was calm.

Monica said, “Fourth Master, although you and Jeannie have been secretly dating for a long time, we don’t know how long it has been. From our point of view, the two of you have just started dating. Since you have just started dating and are already getting married, you must show us how sincere you are toward Jeannie!”
