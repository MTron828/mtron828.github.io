916 Have You Really Let Go of Finn?

The doctor suggested that he stay in the hospital as his burns were quite serious. Finn refused, saying he was a doctor and knew his physical condition well. So, the doctor did not say anything else.

After Finn had dealt with his burns, he returned to his department, changed into a spare set of clothes, and left to go to the burn department. He went straight to the VIP section and stopped outside a ward.

In the ward, Monica was wrapped up like a mummy, with her parents by her side.

“Mom, don’t cry.” Monica could not stand it anymore. Her mother had never been so fragile in the past.

“It’s not like I want to. However, I can’t help but feel afraid every time I think about how you let your father and I go and how you and Sarah were trapped inside! Your dad and I were so worried when we got out,” Ruby said, her tears flowing.

Monica could not move at all. There were many burns, but fortunately, they were not too deep. The doctor said they were all superficial wounds and would recover in a week. If there happened to be any marks on the skin later, they could be recovered through cosmetic surgery. In short, one should definitely feel blessed after surviving a disaster.

“I’m fine, aren’t I?” Monica consoled.

“Thank god that you’re fine. Otherwise, your dad and I would have died with you!” Ruby said angrily.

Monica was speechless. She reckoned that her actions this time had indeed frightened her mother.

“How’s Sarah?” Monica changed the subject. She really did not want her mother to keep harping on her.

In fact, when she asked her parents to leave the burning wedding hall first, she had been prepared to die inside. Naturally, she did not want her parents to die with her.

“I went over to take a look just now and asked the doctor. Her condition is similar to yours. She’s wrapped like a dumpling but not as serious as yours,” Ruby said. “After all, she came out first.”

That’s right. Sarah had been rescued by Finn first.

There was a faint smile on her lips, and not a trace of emotion could be seen. She said, “That’s good. I was afraid something would happen to Sarah. Uncle and auntie would kill me.”

“What are you talking about? Your uncle isn’t that unreasonable.”

“You can’t win against auntie,” Monica exposed her.

“Say, my child…” Ruby was quite protective. They were always good to Sarah’s family.

“Alright. I won’t say anymore. I’d like to rest for a while and sleep! You guys should also lie down for a quick nap on the accompanying beds. Aren’t you all tired after what happened today?” Monica urged.

Gary and Ruby heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Monica in good spirits, and the doctor had said it was only superficial wounds. Afraid of disturbing Monica’s rest, the two left her bed and slept on the accompanying bed next to her.

Monica closed her eyes and tried her best to fall asleep. She could still picture Finn’s determined figure in the fire and Jeanne leaving.

How did Jeanne change so much all of a sudden How could she move so easily through the fire? It seemed like it was no effort at all for her to carry Monica. Moreover, why did she turn into another person to attend her wedding? Did Jeanne have something to do with what happened at the wedding?

Though, she would not blame Jeanne. She was just worried about how Jeanne was living now. What exactly was Jeanne going through? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

These thoughts clouded her head. Even though she was extremely sleepy, she could not fall asleep. However, she was so quiet that it made others believe she had fallen asleep.

She heard her parents discussing softly on the accompanying bed, “I heard that Finn saved Sarah.”

“Yep. I just heard your brother and sister-in-law say that it was Finn who carried Sarah out,” Gary sighed. “Sarah should have been with Monica then.”

“That means Finn abandoned Monica and saved Sarah first,” Ruby also sighed.

“I can understand.” Gary was reasonable. “He’s dating Sarah now. It’s only natural that he saves her first.”

“That’s true, but…” Ruby was more emotional.

It did not necessarily mean she would be happier if Monica had been saved first. In her heart, Sarah was as important as Monica. She just had an indescribable feeling in her heart.
