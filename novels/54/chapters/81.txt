Chapter 82: Need a Helper

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The next day, Jeanne took George to have breakfast.

At the breakfast table, Alexander, Joshua, and Jenifer were all there.

Jenifer had been taking good care of Alexander.

In the Lawrences, Alexander enjoyed the treatment of a king.

It was not strange that Alexander liked Jenifer so much. Jenifer’s methods of coaxing a man were still first-class.

Jeanne sat over, and the servants brought breakfast.

She said casually, “Little Mother, the driver didn’t pick George up from school yesterday. Did you know?”

Jenifer looked a little surprised. “How can that be? Isn’t George home?”

Jeanne sneered. “George was just sent back last night. I’m afraid you’re taking George too seriously.”

“I was too busy yesterday. I had a friend who had something to do in the afternoon, so I went out. I really didn’t know,” Jenifer explained, looking very sincere.

“The driver didn’t tell you?”Jeanne asked.

“No, really,” Jenifer kept explaining.

She just looked like she did not know anything.

“Then it’s the responsibility of the driver,” Jeanne said indifferently.

“I’ll punish him properly later.”

“How are you going to punish him, Little Mother?” Jeanne asked.

“There should be a lesson. His salary will be deducted.”

“I’m afraid you’re too biased,” Jeanne said sarcastically, “If George was taken away by bad guys yesterday, who would bear the responsibility?”

Jenifer was a little embarrassed.

“Such a driver has to be fired,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

Jenifer was momentarily speechless.

The driver was a distant relative of hers.

“Dad, what do you think?” Jeanne did not seek Jenifer’s opinion at this moment and turned to Alexander.

Alexander put down his cutleries and wiped his mouth. “You don’t have to report to me if you’re just firing a servant.”

“Firing the driver is a small matter, but if he’s fired, who will send and pick up George?” Jenifer played dumb. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Can’t you hire another one?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

“It takes time.”

“During this period, I’ll have to trouble you then, Little Mother,” Jeanne said very naturally.

Jenifer could not find the words to reject her at this moment.

If she rejected, it would be obvious that she was targeting Jeanne, or that she did not care about George.

The two crimes were disadvantageous to her.

Jenifer smiled, trying to swallow her anger. She said, “I have nothing to do at home anyway. I’ll send him and pick him up.”

“Thank you, Little Mother.” Jeanne smiled very nicely.

Jenifer suppressed her anger.

Jeanne was really getting more and more unreasonable.

Jeanne’s motive was obviously not just to deliberately anger Jenifer. More importantly, Jenifer personally picking up George would ensure his safety. Even if Jenifer was putting on a show, she would not let anything happen to George. If anything happened to George, she would be the first to be implicated.

After the incident of George being “kidnapped” by Fourth Master Swan, Jeanne suddenly felt that she needed a helper.

After breakfast, Jeanne drove to the company by herself.

Alexander still brought Joshua to the company.

At 10:00 am, Jeanne had the meeting on time. Everyone reported on the work that was arranged yesterday.

Jeanne listened attentively.

After the meeting ended, she assigned a bunch of tasks.

Jeanne also returned to her office. She sat down and picked up the phone to make a call.

The call was quickly picked up. “Are you used to your work?”

“Is it important?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

“Can you not ignore my concern every time?”

“Because you’re always talking nonsense.”

“...” The person was a little unhappy. “Why are you looking for me?”

“I need a helper,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

Kingsley was stunned for a moment. “You can’t handle it?”

“It’s not me, it’s George.” Jeanne told him about how George had been “kidnapped” by Fourth Master Swan yesterday.

Kingsley agreed immediately. “I’ll arrange it for you right away.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

“Do you want to send George back instead?” Kingsley suggested.

Jeanne said, “He has to follow me.”

“Okay.” Kingsley compromised.

It was possible to discuss anything with Jeanne, but with George, there was no room for discussion.

Jeanne hung up the phone.

She just did not want George to feel that she had abandoned him.

Jeanne was deeply hurt by her family. She knew what it felt like, and she would not let George experience it.

Her eyes turned slightly, and she focused on her work.

At this moment, she was getting her team members to write a draft proposal on how to obtain the MUK cooperation rights, and she was already writing a direction for the Lawrence Enterprise’s transformation after working with MUK.

If she wanted to save the enterprise, she could only start from the root.

Of course, she was not doing it to help the Lawrences.

She was only doing it for revenge.

A week of busy and routine work passed just like that.

MUK announced that they would find a partner to open up the e-commerce market in Harken. There were a lot of active companies at the moment, and many of them had started negotiations as soon as they received the news!

Jeanne did not seem particularly active.

Due to Jeanne’s attitude, Alexander even called her to his office and scolded her.

At this moment, in Joshua’s office.

Joshua was gloating over Jeanne’s misfortune as he made a call. “I think Jeanne might not be that great.”

Eden frowned slightly. “What did you discover?”

“Right now, the MUK Group has started discussing the collaboration with some enterprises, but Jeanne is still unmoved. Today, she was even scolded by my dad. She probably feels that she doesn’t have the ability to negotiate this collaboration.”

“We can’t let our guard down,” Eden reminded, “Who knows what Jeanne is going to do? Since she promised to take down the MUK cooperation right in front of the board of directors, she definitely has her abilities. She wouldn’t be so stupid as to slap her face like this.”

“What you mean is that she’s only pretending now and trying to create a smokescreen?”

“It’s very likely,” Eden said, “Oh right, have you bribed the person I told you to?”

“It’s done.” Joshua’s smile was especially sinister. “Money can make the devil move. I only gave some money, and the other party couldn’t resist the temptation.”

“Very good.” Eden nodded. “Have him report to you at any time about the situation of Jeanne’s project. Remember, you must be careful not to let Jeanne find out. Otherwise, not only will you not be able to monitor her in the future, but you’ll also be caught by her and won’t be able to stay out!”

“Don’t worry, I know what to do.”

“Call me if there are any updates.”

“Okay.”

Joshua hung up the phone. The corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

At this point, Jeanne came out of Alexander’s office and held an emergency meeting.

Jeanne said, “Tomorrow, I need a complete MUK cooperation plan. The morning after tomorrow, I’ll meet with the MUK partner to discuss the cooperation. A few areas need to be revised for the proposal that you gave me before. I hope that everyone will work overtime tonight to complete it.”

“Understood.”

After the meeting, Jeanne returned to her office and was also working overtime to finish the proposal.

Jeanne knew very well that there were many people who did not want her to succeed in the cooperation. She wanted to ensure that nothing went wrong.

She worked all the way until 9:00 pm.

Jeanne saved her own proposal.

She stretched and stood up from her office chair, intending to get off work.

Her phone rang.

To be honest, she was afraid to receive a call from Monica at such a late hour.

She hesitated for a moment before picking up. “Monica.”

“Hurry and come to King-T.” Monica sounded like she was in a hurry.

“What’s wrong?”

“Something big has happened. Hurry and come!”

“...”

‘Does Monica go crazy every once in a while?!’
