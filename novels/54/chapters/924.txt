925 Another Accident, Gary’s Illness Acts Up

She laid on the bed, thinking of Edward. She thought of George and Monica as well. She did not know how long such days would last. In the end, would she really get what she hoped for?

…

South Hampton City.

Monica and Sarah were discharged a week later. Their burn wounds were much better, but the skin was still tender and could not be touched. Other than that, they were fine.

After she was discharged, Sarah did not go home but went straight to Monica’s house. Ruby was worried about Sarah’s parents taking care of her. After all, Sarah’s parents were busy with work. Since Ruby was staying at home full-time and taking care of Monica, it was no trouble for her to take care of another too. So Sarah happily followed Monica’s family back to their house.

Monica had disliked Sarah since she was young. Every time she was around, she would be chided by her parents. Now, Monica had all the more reason not to like her. She actually tried to steal her man and was, more importantly, successful!

Monica counted all the times over the years she had been humiliated in front of Sarah, and the more she thought about it, the angrier she got. Sarah got what she wanted every time.

F*ck. She must have owed this woman something in her past life and was here to collect her debt.

Monica laid on her bed, feeling uneasy. She was so bored.

Over the past week, the news of her wedding had been trending. Breaking off her engagement on the spot, exposing Michael’s true colors, and then a fire… It was huge news. Even the Sanders came forward to explain the various incidents which happened during the wedding.

As she was so bored, Monica had read all the news about her wedding banquet. In addition to paying attention to the incident, most of the onlookers were still filled with righteous indignation at Michael’s hypocritical image. The internet was full of Michael’s scolding, including Ruby. Monica could not bear to read those vicious words.

Even though she had expected such a result, she still felt it was a big blow to Michael. Her guilt was even more obvious, especially on the third day after the wedding banquet, when the news of Michael being dismissed from his position as the head of the Quality Inspection Hall spread like wildfire. However, she had no regrets or empathy toward him. It was self-defense. The consequences were Michael’s responsibility to bear, not hers.

Michael had not called her these past few days. She did not know what Michael was thinking or if he had given up struggling. In Monica’s world, she and Michael had nothing to do with each other anymore.

How Michael lived in the future was his business. She would just live out the rest of her years and let herself live well.

She thought how ordinary life would be now that Michael, Finn, nor Jeanne was no longer by her side. She was prepared to stay home and accompany her parents for the rest of her life until something happened.

The day went by as usual, with Ruby taking care of Monica and Sarah’s daily needs. It had been a week since they had returned from the hospital. Monica felt she had put on a lot of weight from staying home every day, waiting for death.

Sarah said she did not look good if she put on weight, but she still could not refuse Ruby’s meticulous meal. The two of them complained as they swept the floor.

Facing the empty plates, Monica and Sarah were both a little sad.

“Why aren’t you back in school yet?” Monica looked at Sarah unhappily.

She had almost recovered, so why was she not at school? Was senior year that easy?

If Sarah were not around, she probably would not have been able to eat so much.

“The doctor told me to rest at home for two weeks before going to school. I have to go to the hospital for a check-up too,” Sarah retorted.

“You don’t want to go to college, do you?”

“I’m not going to college. I’m going to nursing school,” Sarah said bluntly.

Monica was a little surprised. “Aren’t you afraid of what your parents might say?”

Back then, Monica’s grades were not good. In order not to be beaten to death by her parents, she worked hard during her final year. After that, she received an average bachelor’s degree, which was considered next to nothing. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Sarah was even more ambitious than her.

“I’m going to be a nurse. I’ve already set my sights on that major,” Sarah quickly said. “I’ve asked my teacher. My grades are more than enough to get in, so don’t worry.”
