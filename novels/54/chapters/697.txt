What was he to Monica? Was he a person she liked very much?

She liked him so much, yet she never trusted him and never gave him any sense of security.

Even though she liked him so much, he was still nothing to her compared to Michael.

He finally gave up hope after trying time and time again.

Finn did not say anything more at that moment and was about to hang up the phone when Michael’s cold voice came from the other end of the phone. “Finn, Monica is taking a shower.”

Finn was indifferent to it.

“After she washes up, I will help her forget everything you left on her last night.”

“That’s your business,” Finn said indifferently. “It has nothing to do with me.”

Without saying another word, Finn hung up the phone.

Michael looked at the words “end of call”, and his expression turned ugly.

One day, he would make Finn lose everything!

He put down his phone and went out to the pharmacy downstairs, where he bought an emergency contraceptive pill.

When he returned, Monica was still in the bathroom.

Michael knocked on Monica’s bathroom door worriedly.

“Monica.”

There was no response from inside.

“Monica.” Michael’s voice grew louder.

However, there was still no response, and Michael started to get a little nervous.

It had never crossed his mind that Monica would commit suicide for Finn. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

His heartbeat quickened. “Monica, if you don’t say anything, I’ll barge in–”

“I’m fine.” Monica’s cold voice came from inside.

Michael stood at the door, worried that Monica would do something stupid. However, when he heard Monica’s voice, his expression darkened.

Monica was still rejecting him.

Even after getting into that mess with Finn, had she not thought about starting over with him?

Otherwise, she would not have stopped him the moment he said he was going to barge in, which meant that she was still rejecting him.

Despite that, he did not show it. In front of Monica, he was the best man in the world.

He said, “Don’t stay in there for too long. You might get lightheaded.”

“Okay,” Monica replied.

He could still hear sobbing sounds in between breaths.

Was Monica crying her heart out in the bathroom? For Finn, whom she had completely let go of?

After a long time, Monica finally walked out of the bathroom and changed into her home clothes.

At that moment, Michael was cooking in the open kitchen.

Monica saw Michael’s house-husband look as soon as she came out, and it warmed her heart.

She asked herself what she liked about Finn. Did she have masochistic tendencies? Was she sick for not wanting such a good man?

“Are you done washing up?” Michael smiled gently. “I don’t know how to cook, so I prepared a bowl of mac and cheese for you. I don’t know how it tastes, but you can try it later.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

“Go wait on the sofa. It’ll be ready soon.”

With that, Monica sat on the sofa.

Michael said casually while cooking, “You can decide if you want to take the medicine on the coffee table.”

Monica was surprised.

That was when she saw an emergency birth control pill on the coffee table and a cup of warm water beside it.

Her throat moved.

She had actually thought about it last night, whether she would have their child after sleeping with each other.

Last night, she had imagined many scenes of them reconciling, but in the end, it was all ruined.

“Thank you, Michael.” Monica picked up the contraceptive pill and opened it.

Of course, she would eat it.

If she did not, could she use the kid to reconcile with Finn?

That was impossible because Finn would only cause her to miscarry.

He would not tolerate her in any way, and that was how much of a cold-blooded person he was.

Once he was certain of something, she would not be able to change him even if she died.

“It was Finn who called and asked me to buy it for you.” Michael’s voice was a little soft as if he was afraid that she would be sad.

Monica took out the pill from the packaging.

Suddenly, she laughed.

Was Finn still afraid that she would pester him?

“Michael, can I use your phone? I left my phone at the hotel,” Monica said.

Michael quickly handed the phone he had on him to her.

Monica thanked him after taking it. Then, she took a few photos of the birth control pill and a selfie of herself taking the pill.

She sent the photos to Finn.

“Don’t worry. I won’t disgust you,” she said.
