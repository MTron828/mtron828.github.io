Chapter 303: Plot Twist: Fourth Master, Do You Want to Get Married?

A certain person’s expression changed slightly.

Jeanne, on the other hand, was calm and composed. In fact, she was stating a fact.

She said, “George is still young, and there is a limit to what rides he can go on. He can’t go on rollercoasters, drop towers, pirate ships, and so on. If you’re interested, I can accompany you, Fourth Master, and George can wait for us outside—”

“No need. Just pick the rides George can go on,” Edward said straightforwardly.

“In that case, let’s go to the children’s area. The rides there are mostly for children.”

Edward hummed in response.

With that, they reached an agreement.

Jeanne walked to the front and looked at the amusement park’s signboard. By following it, they soon arrived at the children’s area.

There were carousels, bumper cars, lower high-altitude rides, children’s rollercoasters, children’s drop towers, and so on.

George was against it.

He was against every ride, but he still reluctantly went to all of them.

On the contrary, Jeanne was the one who had fun the entire time.

Although it was not as thrilling, it had been a while since she had been to a place like that. She even missed it a little.

......

They had gone on every single ride in the children’s section.

“Do you want to ride the Ferris Wheel?” Jeanne pointed at the large Ferris wheel far away and asked.

Edward nodded.

However, George did not want to go.

He could see that the Ferris wheel was still far away, so he did not want to go.

He felt he had walked more today than he had over the past six years.

Jeanne could naturally tell that he refused to go.

Therefore, she smiled and said to George, “The Ferris wheel is something every woman can’t say no to in an amusement park. Can you keep me company?”

George was not happy, but he listened to her obediently and then nodded.

Seeing that George had agreed, Jeanne dragged George toward the direction of the Ferris wheel.

Just as they were about to leave, someone suddenly lifted George into the air.

Jeanne was slightly startled as she watched Fourth Master Swan pick George up from the ground.

George was not young anymore. He was six years old and did not need to be carried.

However, Fourth Master Swan was too tall. On him, George looked tiny, so tiny that it did not seem out of place.

Jeanne remained silent.

Seeing Fourth Master Swan carrying George from behind had stirred up some emotions in her.

Yet, she pursed her lips and caught up to them.

George was actually a little embarrassed.

After all, he was not young anymore, and in his memory, he had barely been carried like that.

At that moment, being carried by Fourth Master Swan like that...

Fine.

He was really too tired and did not want to walk anymore.

Besides, Fourth Master Swan’s body made him feel very safe.

He struggled internally for quite a while, and that struggle was written all over his face. Yet, in the end, he gave in and lay on Fourth Master Swan’s shoulder.

Jeanne thought that George would at least resist or show signs of resistance.

However, she did not expect he would lie on Fourth Master Swan just like that.

He even took the initiative to hug Fourth Master Swan’s neck and put his head on Fourth Master Swan’s shoulder.

As for the man who was being hugged tightly, his body tensed up.

Jeanne could not see his expression because he was walking in front of her. However, she... was moved by his gesture.

After walking for about twenty minutes, they finally arrived before a huge Ferris wheel.

As it was not yet nighttime and there were not many people, they could get on the ride without queueing up.

Jeanne and George sat on one side, while Master Yan sat alone on the other side.

The Ferris wheel slowly rose, continuously rising.

George was leaning on the glass of the Ferris wheel, looking at the scenery outside. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was probably his first time sitting on it, so his childlike curiosity was activated.

At that moment, Edward and Jeanne were also looking outside the glass. It was very quiet inside the small Ferris wheel.

Amidst the quietness, they could feel the Ferris wheel slowly rising.

“Has Eldest Young Lady Lawrence and Eden been on a Ferris wheel before?” Edward suddenly asked.

Jeanne was stunned.

Nonsense.

Among those in a relationship, only a few and far between had never been on the Ferris wheel before.

Jeanne did not answer his question.

In fact, Edward was well aware of that.

“I seem to have missed out on a lot of life,” Edward said softly.

Jeanne looked at him. “Fourth Master, you did not miss out on life. It was just brilliant. After all, no one could catch up to you.”

“Is that so?” Edward said calmly.

However, there was no emotion in his voice.

“You might not know, but the truth is that none of us dare to get close to you because we feel like you were born superior to us.” Jeanne was telling the truth.

For a long time, she felt that Fourth Master Swan was unapproachable.

Edward did not respond.

As such, Jeanne continued to speak, “I first saw you at my mother’s funeral, and you left a deep impression on me. I thought you were too high and mighty and worlds apart from me. However, I don’t think you remember me. You probably didn’t even see me at that time.”
