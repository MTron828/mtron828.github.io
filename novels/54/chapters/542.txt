Chapter 543: We Really Got A Divorce

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She believed Finn would understand when the time came.

After they got into the car, they went straight to the press conference.

They had set up a meeting with the reporters at 10 a.m. that morning to explain everything regarding Michael.

When they were in the car, Monica’s phone rang, and she glanced at the incoming call, which she had expected.

She gritted her teeth and answered the call. “Dad.”

“Monica, what the hell are you doing?” Gary sounded angry.

Monica bit her lips.

“What’s going on between you and Michael? Why are you on the news again? Last time, when your mother and I called to ask about the news about you and Michael, you told me that you had nothing to do with him, that it was the paparazzi’s doing, and that you and Jianqin were good. Now, tell me, what’s this with this picture of you at Michael’s house? What’s going on?”

Monica was stunned. ‘What house?’

While trying to figure it out, she heard her father throwing a fit again. “Monica, I’ll get the driver to come and pick you up right now!”

“Dad–”

“Let Finn know because I can’t get through to him. He might not have heard it,” Gary told her.

It was not that Finn did not hear him. In fact, Finn probably refused to pick up.

She said, “Dad, I have some matters to attend to and can’t come back right now. Once I’m done, I’ll come back and explain it to you in person. It’s not convenient for me to tell you over the phone.”

“What matters do you have to attend to? Tell me!” Gary was furious.

“I have matters to attend to.”

“Where’s Finn?” Gary asked.

“Him? I don’t know.”

“Did you both argue again?”

“We’ll talk about it later.” Monica did not want to explain the situation over the phone.

That made Gary even more furious. “Monica, if you have anything to do with Michael, I’ll break your leg!”

“One of my legs is already broken.”

“I meant both your legs.”

Monica was speechless.

“Come back soon. Your mother and I will cook yours and Finn’s favorite dishes and wait for you.” In the end, Gary was still no match for his daughter.

Although his tone was fierce, he could not hide how much he cared for her.

As Monica hung up the phone, she wondered if her father would die of anger if he found out that she and Finn were divorced.

Michael, who was beside her, saw her in distress and said, “I can explain it to your father.”

Monica shook her head. “We’ll see when the time comes.”

When the time came, she would see what her father’s attitude was.

The car arrived at the press conference venue with plenty of time left.

Michael said, “I’ve prepared a makeup artist. Do you think it’s necessary? I know you like to look pretty–”

“Thank you.” Monica thanked him.

To her, Michael was always so thoughtful.

She had cried the whole of last night, so her eyes were swollen today. Moreover, she had to wake up so early in the morning in the hotel and did not have time to put on makeup. If she were to go to the media looking like that, she might as well kill herself.

With that, Michael brought Monica to the dressing room.

While Monica had her makeup done, she received a lot of messages.

It turned out she had a lot of fair-weathered friends.

Hence, when her news flooded the Internet, countless people sent messages to ask if she was really with Michael again and if she and Finn were divorced.

Her friends actually wanted her to be with Michael since Michael was better than Finn in all aspects.

In the eyes of her friends, Finn was just a poor doctor. Although his skills and expertise were decent, at the end of the day, he was just a doctor. Moreover, Monica kept badmouthing Finn, and everyone found Finn unforgivable. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

At that moment, when they saw the news that her old relationship with Michael had rekindled, everyone congratulated her.

However, she just read all the messages silently without replying.

After that, she looked at the news again, and that was when she saw the gossip about her and Michael on the news.

She frowned.

Having been by her side the entire time, Michael saw her expression and lowered his eyes to glance at her phone screen. He explained, “I didn’t know my house was being monitored too.”

Monica pursed her lips.

It was no wonder everyone was certain she was back together with Michael.

From the photo, they looked very intimate, sitting together on the sofa in the living room.

Michael mocked himself, “Now, we really can’t convince them otherwise.”

Monica nodded silently.

“Monica, I really didn’t think it would implicate you like this–”

“It’s okay. I believe you can resolve it quickly.” Monica smiled faintly.

She believed that Michael could resolve it quickly, and then she could leave unscathed.
