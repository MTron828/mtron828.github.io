1134 She Meant It When She Said She Didn’t Like Him Anymore

Harken’s high-class prison was not as dark and humid as a normal prison. Moreover, it was much cleaner and drier.

Edward raised his head and saw Warren walking in with Chester and Jeanne.

In the end, Jeanne returned to the Sanders.

Edward did not show any emotions, and neither did Jeanne.

In fact, when he was arrested by the Sanders for false charges, he had already guessed that Jeanne was behind it all.

The Sanders had not been able to think of a way to restrain him for such a long time, but suddenly, they came up with something as if they had an inspiration. No matter what, he found it very suspicious.

The only suspicious person was Jeanne.

Edward pondered over the situation.

“Edward, I never thought that we would meet in such a way. In my heart, the Swans have always been an important existence! I remember telling you that we’ve always treated the Swans as loyal, yet you guys have betrayed my trust.” Warren spoke in a neutral voice.

Edward looked at him. “I don’t know how I betrayed your trust. I don’t even know why you would detain me. I only remember you giving me an important task during Ms. Stacey’s wedding. I really don’t understand why you’ve suddenly changed your mind after only two days.”

Both of them had already come to this point, yet they were still putting on an act with each other.

Jeanne stood behind Warren without saying a word.

Edward’s line of sight was no longer on her.

They seemed to have a tacit understanding that their relationship had ended.

“Change my mind?” Warren sneered, “I didn’t change my mind. It was you who didn’t keep your promise.”

“Why do you say that, Leader?” Edward continued to give a perfunctory answer.

“Edward, we’re all smart people, so I won’t beat around the bush. It’ll be a waste of everyone’s time if I do that.” Warren asked, “Where is the Duncans’ descendant?”

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

Did that mean Warren was not putting up an act anymore?

He said, “I’ve already told you before that I don’t know of this person’s existence. All I know is that you’ve entrusted me to find this person’s whereabouts. However, I’m just an ordinary person. I’m not God. How can I accomplish something that you couldn’t in such a short time? Leader, you really think too highly of me.”

“Edward, I don’t want to use any underhanded means on you.” Warren’s face darkened.

It was obvious that he was not happy with Edward’s answer.

Edward sneered. “Do you think that your current methods are good?”

Warren was embarrassed by Edward’s jab.

“You’re imprisoning me on a false charge just to find the so-called descendant from me. As the leader of a country, don’t you think that your actions are despicable?”

“Enough!” Warren was visibly angry.

As the head of the Sanders, he had never been looked down upon like that in all his years.

Warren said, “I don’t want to waste any more time with you. Just tell me, who is the Duncans’ descendant? Otherwise...”

Otherwise, would it end badly for Edward?

Edward replied indifferently, “I told you, I really don’t know who the so-called descendant of the Duncans is! Leader, if you’re willing to give me some time, I can help you to investigate it. But if you insist on me giving you an answer now, I can only tell you that my ability is limited and I can’t meet your requirements.”

“So there’s no room for negotiation, huh?” Warren was obviously getting impatient.

Edward did not reply, and his silence was considered a tacit agreement.

“Chester,” Warren ordered coldly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Yes,” Chester replied respectfully.

In the next second, he walked to Edward and took out a high-grade taser.

There would be no wounds or deaths, but it would make people suffer so much that they would wish they were dead.

That was an unwritten but legal method of interrogation for criminals when one was afraid of leaving evidence behind. It was a very popular method in the Sanders’ regime.

Basically, no one could take it.

In the end, they would all plead guilty.

Chester walked up to Edward and gave a look to his bodyguards, who then stepped forward and restrained Edward.

Edward’s eyes were cold.

He watched as Chester walked closer to him, and the moment he reached out, Jeanne suddenly said, “Brother.”

Chester turned to look at Jeanne with a frown.

Warren also looked at Jeanne in the same way.
