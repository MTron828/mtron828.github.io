872 Accumulating Power, Return to South Hampton City

Jeanne listened to Monica’s seemingly heartless words.

This girl had never expressed her discomfort and always made others think she did not care much about many things. In reality, she just did not want others to worry about her.

Jeanne’s heart ached a little but did not expose her.

She said, “Monica, it’s not just about scheming Michael.”

“What do you mean?” Most of the time, Monica was not good at guessing other people’s emotions, so she was a little surprised.

“Anyone who has a close relationship with him can become one of Michael’s scandals and a legitimate reason for you to break off the engagement,” Jeanne said. “For example, with how Reese treated you. If you expose her malice and viciousness, you can also use it to force Michael’s hand. Besides, I don’t think you want to be bullied by Reese again, do you?”

“Of course not.” Monica was furious. She was still fuming at the thought of Reese’s slap today.

As she was pampered by her parents since young, she had never suffered such a great grievance. While Michael did lie to her, he did not hurt her physically.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.

“Then we must use all the resources we can think of. From now on, just do as I say.” Jeanne explained the next step of the plan to Monica very serious.

Monica was still a little confused. However, she was trying her best to understand and accept it.

The two of them talked for a long time.

“If you encounter anything unexpected that you can’t solve or aren’t confident about, you must give me a call. Don’t let your emotions affect your decisions and act rashly.” After Jeanne finished speaking, she did not forget to remind her, “Otherwise, if we’re not careful, our efforts will be in vain. Michael may be smarter than we think.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded heavily.

She trusted Jeanne unconditionally. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Oh, right.” Monica asked Jeanne, “Where are you now? When are you coming back? I’d be more at ease if you’re with me.”

“I won’t be back for a long time,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“What are you up to?” Monica was a little angry.

Jeanne had always been elusive. However, the current Jeanne was too far away from her. She did not seem to be leading a normal life, either. What exactly happened in the seven years since she left?

Jeanne said, “There are many things that I can’t tell you at the moment. It’s not that I’m deliberately hiding them from you, but it’ll only do us both harm if I told you.”

The more Monica knew, the more danger she would be in. She did not want to bring Monica into her dangerous world. So the only thing she could do now was to do her best to help Monica overcome the difficulties in her life.

“I feel like you’re getting further and further away from me, Jeanne…” Monica muttered. She was still a little upset about Jeanne’s concealment.

Jeanne did not want to lie to Monica, so she chose to remain silent.

Silence meant consent.

Her living environment was completely different from Monica’s, and she would also not drag Monica into this.

She said, “Actually, I think it’ll be good for you to have me not with you at the moment.”

Jeanne tried her best to find a reason that would comfort Monica. It was very clear Monica needed someone to rely on and accompany her.

With Monica’s personality, she would definitely not tell her parents about her sadness. So, although it seemed she had lived a happy life since childhood, when she encountered something that made her really sad, she would bear it alone.

“Why not?” It was obvious Monica did not believe Jeanne’s excuse.

“Michael should still be afraid of me,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Although she had not found any concrete evidence to prove that Melody, Eden, and the others she had fought with had Michael’s support, she was almost certain. She had been winning all these times. Michael must have his own scale.

It just so happened that she was not in South Hampton City. Now that she had disappeared temporarily, Michael would not be so guarded against Monica. It would also make their plan more successful.

“You mean, Michael won’t suspect me too much because he doesn’t think I’m a great strategist?”

“Yeah.”

However, Monica was not stupid.

“That’s why we need to seize the opportunity. If we miss it, there won’t be a next time,” Jeanne reminded her sternly.
