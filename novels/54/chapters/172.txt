Chapter 173: Everything Happened Because of Fourth Master Swan

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Gary was also a little surprised.

‘Wasn’t Jeanne fine a few days ago?’

A few days ago, he even saw how capable Jeannie was and had the urge to beat Monica to death. As Jeannie had a good relationship with Monica and Jeannie’s mother passed away early, he also treated Jeannie as his daughter. Seeing Jeannie return and develop so well, he was mostly relieved.

Now that something suddenly happened…

Gary said, “Don’t be anxious. I’ll ask about the situation.”

Monica nodded like a chick pecking on rice, looking at her dad with anticipation.

Gary called his friend in the prosecution hall.

Monica did not know what the other party had said to her dad. She felt that her dad’s expression was especially grave as if something big had happened.

Could it be…

Could it be that Jeannie was going to be sentenced to death?!

At the thought of this, Monica was scared to death.

Fortunately, Gary had hung up the phone.

Monica went forward and grabbed her dad’s arm. “Dad, how is it? Will Jeannie die?!”

Gary Glanced at Monica. “According to Harken’s law, one will only pay with one’s life if they took someone’s life. Those who commit other crimes won’t be sentenced to death. Can you have some common sense?”

Monica was stunned.

She was anxious and flustered.

She was just afraid that something would happen to Jeannie.

“However, it is indeed very serious.” Gary did not hide the truth from Monica, “Jeannie signed a dual contract and took a personal gain of 30 million dollars. Now, the evidence is conclusive, and she’s currently not allowed to be released on bail pending trial. She’s being detained in the detention center. According to Harken’s law, pocketing such a huge sum of money without permission will result in a sentence of at least 10 years.”

“What?!” Monica widened her eyes.

“Not only that...” Gary seemed to hesitate for a moment.

Monica looked straight at her dad, extremely nervous.

“Did Jeannie offend anyone during this time?” Gary asked Monica. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Monica frowned.

How would she know?!

Jeannie was so busy during this period that she did not even have time to hang with her.

Whenever Monica called Jeannie, Jeannie hung up after saying a few words.

Monica could not think of who Jeannie had offended during this time.

Gary said with concern, “They said that Jeannie’s case will be judged the fastest and that it was already assigned to someone. Other than the people in charge of the specific circumstances of the case, no one else is clear about it. They also said that the internal political angle on her case has increased to a very high level. Usually, this only occurs when a higher-up specially gave the instruction.”

“Jeannie has just returned. Who can she offend?!” Monica was clueless.

“A famous person attracts criticism. It could be anyone,” Gary said straightforwardly.

“Then what do we do now? What about Jeannie?” Monica looked at her dad anxiously.

“I originally wanted to use my connections to meet Jeannie. At the very least, I could find out the reason for the matter from Jeannie. However, the other party directly rejected me, saying that no one within their ranks dared to interfere in her case. If they crossed the line, not only will they be fired, but they’ll also be held accountable. I can’t make things difficult for the other party.”

“How could this be?!” Monica was on the verge of breaking down.

“I’ll think of a way to find out about Jeannie’s situation. That said, from the other party’s tone, she should’ve committed an economic crime. Hence, even if I find out anything, it might not be of much help to her. The only way is to make up for the 30 million dollars that she obtained for her private interests, together with the interest, and try to make up for her mistakes as much as possible. Plead with the judge and reduce her sentence as much as possible.”

“Jeannie wouldn’t commit a crime—definitely not.” Monica could not accept this.

“I also believe that Jeannie wouldn’t do such a thing, but this is the current situation.” Gary was helpless, “I’ll go prepare the funds for Jeannie now to ensure that she can successfully repay the 30 million dollars that she gained. I’ll also arrange for the people handling her case so that she won’t suffer any grievances there.”

Monica still wanted to say something.

Gary said, “Right now, this is the only way to help Jeannie.”

Monica bit her lip.

She knew that even if she cried herself to death, this was all her dad could do.

Nevertheless, she could not accept the fact that Jeannie would go to jail.

No.

She had to see Jeannie. She had to know the truth!

If Jeanne was framed, even if she had to go bankrupt, she had to win the case for Jeannie and get justice.

When Monica returned to the office, she did not hesitate anymore and called Micheal.

During this period, she had obviously kept a distance from Micheal.

However, for Jeannie’s sake, she could not care too much.

Micheal picked up. His voice was always warm. He called Monica’s name very warmly, “Monica.”

“Micheal, Jeannie is in trouble,” Monica said. Her eyes were red.

“Yes, I heard about it,” Micheal replied.

“My dad said that Jeannie’s condition is very bad now. It’s even difficult for us to see her, but I...” Monica wanted to say something but hesitated.

It was because she did not want to make things difficult for Micheal.

Since her dad said that no one dared to interfere in Jeannie’s matter at the moment, if Micheal interfered, she was also worried that it would affect him.

“You want to see her, right?” Micheal asked straightforwardly.

Monica’s heart warmed.

Micheal always knew what she wanted.

“I’ll think of a way. Give me some time.” Micheal agreed without thinking.

“Micheal, thank you,” Monica said sincerely.

“Silly.” Micheal smiled dotingly and promised, “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely let you meet Jeannie.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded hard.

At this moment, she was truly moved.

She was deeply moved by Micheal.

She always felt that Micheal treated her very well.

“Wait for my news,” Micheal said.

After he said that, he hung up the phone.

Following that, the gentleness on his face slowly faded away.

His expression was stiff and cold. He was thinking about something.

Micheal would definitely do whatever Monica asked him to do so that he could move her even more. He did not know if she had rekindled the old relationship with Finn over the past few years. He only knew very well that she had fallen deep in love with Finn back then. If he did not hold Monica tightly in his hands, it was highly possible that she would return to Finn’s side and everything he had done would be in vain.

Despite that, Melody was clearly targeting Jeanne at this moment.

How could Micheal have the best of both worlds? On one hand, he had to satisfy Monica’s request. On the other hand, he could not let Melody think that he had forgotten his loyalty and would affect his future official career.

Micheal pondered.

After a long time, he picked up the phone and dialed Melody’s number. “Mel.”

“What is it?”

“Monica wants to see Jeanne,” Micheal said straightforwardly.

He thought about it a lot, and in the end, he felt that being direct was the best way to gain the other party’s trust and acceptance.

It would be the biggest taboo if he were to bring Monica to meet Jeanne behind Melody’s back at this time.

Nonetheless, this method was obviously not too good either.

At this moment, Melody was completely silent. Micheal could faintly feel that she was angry.

He explained, “I’m currently pursuing Monica again, and the best way to get her back is to move her. Don’t worry, Monica has a relatively simple personality. Even if she meets Jeanne, it won’t be of any help to her case. I promise.”

Melody still did not say anything.

Micheal continued, “The most important thing is that yesterday, Chief specifically instructed me to take down the Cardellini Enterprise through Monica as soon as possible. I don’t want to let him down.”

“Micheal,” Melody finally spoke.

Micheal said straightforwardly, “If you feel troubled, then forget it. I know that you spent a lot of effort to get Jeanne arrested.”

“I don’t feel troubled, and I also believe in you. I believe that Monica has a simple personality and that she won’t be of much use in this case,” Melody said. “I’m just afraid that you like her too much.”

“I admit that I like her, but the prerequisite for liking her is that she won’t affect my development.” Micheal’s eyes turned cold.
