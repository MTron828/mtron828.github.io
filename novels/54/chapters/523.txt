Chapter 524: Finn, Let’s Get A Divorce

“Monica.” Finn’s cold voice sounded in the corridor.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

For a second, she was so moved by Reese that she almost agreed to it. After all, it was really difficult for her to reject such a request.

She bit her lip and turned around to look at Reese’s pained expression. She could not help but feel uneasy.

She had no idea whether what Michael was going through had anything to do with her, but if it did…

What she was most afraid of was feeling guilty.

She looked at Reese in front of her in a daze and remained silent.

As Finn walked up to her, Monica raised her head to look at him.

Finn said, “We’re leaving.”

Monica did not want to leave because Michael was still in the emergency room, and she wanted to know how Michael was doing!

She felt that she owed Michael a lot.

Finn looked at her, and his expression turned colder. He said, “The doctor said I can be discharged from the hospital. Let’s pack up to go home.”

Monica looked at Finn.

She did not want to reject Finn, but she did not want to leave just yet either.

Reese was still kneeling on the ground in front of her. She cried even more sadly. “Monica, just wait for Michael with me, okay? Wait for Michael. I’m afraid he might do something to hurt himself again if he doesn’t see you when he comes out. I-I’m begging you...”

Monica’s heart softened.

However, Just as she was prepared to agree, Finn walked over and held her hand.

Monica was stunned.

Finn said, “Let’s go.”

Monica looked at him and his determined expression.

“Finn, I want to–”

“What did you promise me?” Finn’s expression darkened. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Monica bit her lip.

“You promised me that you would never interact with Michael again,” Finn reminded her, which made Monica feel bad.

“You’ve already broken up,” Finn reminded her again. “And now, you’re with me.”

She knew all of that, but she just wanted to be friends.

“Come with me.” Finn pulled Monica away with some force, not giving Monica any time to think.

With her crutches, Monica left with Finn.

Reese, on the other hand, stared at Monica’s back coldly.

She did not expect that woman to be so cold-blooded.

Reese was still kneeling on the ground, yet Monica left with another man, leaving her son behind!

A cruel expression appeared on Reese’s face. To think her son went to such an extent to do all that for the woman. What’s more, all the wounds on his body were real. She could not believe how ungrateful that woman was!

Her eyes narrowed.

Anyway, her son said that he would be with Monica.

When that time came, she would make Monica suffer more and in a worse way!

…

Finn dragged Monica back to their ward.

Throughout the journey, Monica remained silent. Every time the image of Michael’s appearance popped up in her mind, she would feel bad.

She had been dating Michael for so many years, but she had never seen Michael self-harm before.

She always thought Michael was a positive and cheerful person, so how could he become like that after suffering a setback?

Monica was overwhelmed by a mix of emotions, and Finn saw it all.

“Monica,” Finn said, to which Monica raised her head and looked at him.

“Once you compromise, you will compromise again and again. Since you have chosen to be with me and not Michael, don’t give in. Michael becoming like this has nothing to do with you. Don’t lose your principles just because of this. Once you do, it’ll be very difficult for you to pick them back up.” Finn looked serious as he expressed his thoughts to Monica. “You should learn to reject people. If you had rejected Michael’s kiss back then, we wouldn’t be here now.”

Monica nodded.

She thought that Finn was right.

If she had not accepted Michael’s kiss back then and pushed Michael away, she might not have broken up with Finn or had any interaction with Michael.

It was her, and she was too kind.

Michael’s matter had nothing to do with her.
