At that moment, the knife in his hand that he was using to peel the garlic suddenly cut into his hand, and blood oozed out.

Nox immediately covered it up as he did not want Shelly to see it. After all, Shelly had just complained that he either had bad knife skills or was prone to cut his finger. Now, he had cut his finger again.

“Is it bleeding?” Shelly asked.

“It’s nothing. It’s just a small injury. I used to get injured a lot, so it’s nothing,” Nox quickly said.

“Let me bandage it for you.”

“There’s no need to bandage such a small injury. It’ll be fine in a while.”

“Nox. ”

“I’m fine. Don’t worry about me,” Nox urged, not wanting Shelly to look down on him.

Shelly was a little speechless. “In that case, clean the wound. If the garlic touches the wound, it will hurt even more.”

“I said it doesn’t hurt anymore, so go do your own thing.” Nox was starting to get impatient.

Shelly was used to Nox’s temper and also knew that no one could change his mind.

Hence, she stood up from the ground and said, “In that case, you clean your wound yourself. ”

“Alright.”

When Nox saw that Shelly had walked away and was doing her own thing, he stood up and cleaned the wound himself under the tap water.

Shelly glanced over. In the end, she could not bear to see him struggle anymore and went to the first aid kit to find a band-aid.

After Nox cleaned the wound and wiped it dry, she handed Nox a band-aid. “Put it on.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Nox glanced at Shelly and slowly took it. After Shelly went back to her work, Nox lowered his head and started putting on the band-aid, which was inconvenient to put on with one hand.

Shelly went over again and took the band-aid. “Give me your finger.”

Under Shelly’s insistence, Nox extended his finger, and Shelly carefully put on the band-aid on Nox’s finger. Meanwhile, Nox kept looking at Shelly, watching her serious expression.

He said, “I don’t seem to be able to do anything right.”

Shelly paused for a moment before saying, “Everyone has their own strengths. You don’t have to do everything well. At the very least, you’re very good at doing business, and many people can’t compare to you when it comes to that.” “Are you trying to comfort me?”

“I’m telling the truth.” Shelly said as she held the band-aid, “Take me, for example. I won’t know how to work in a company, but I can be a waitress.”

Shelly’s tone was normal, but Nox felt an indescribable sense of guilt when he heard it. If Shelly had been able to pass the college entrance examination and llnivareit-xr

He could not help but ask, “Back then, your car accident… I’m talking about the car accident that happened on the day of your college entrance examination. Were your injuries serious?

Shelly did not know why Nox was suddenly bringing up the car accident. At that time, Nox would rather die than visit her in the hospital, and she figured that was when she had completely given up on Nox.

When she was lying on the hospital bed, the doctor told her that she had a miscarriage, even before she knew about the existence of the child. He also told her that she was disfigured. Since she was not good-looking, to begin with, she would probably not be able to be in public anymore with her disfigured face. That time was the lowest point of her life.

In fact, she had hoped that Nox would come to see her and agree to be with her, even if it was because he felt sorry for her. However, in the end. Nox was not that kind. As the days passed and Nox was nowhere to be seen, she was left utterly disappointed.

Later, she heard from Mrs. Winter that Nox had gotten into a fight with Grandpa Winter because he did not want to see her and was beaten half to death by Grandpa Winter. Seeing that Mrs. Winter had told her to spare Nox’s life, she let him go.

After taking Nox’s money, she wanted to never see Nox again, and she did indeed keep her dignity. Even though there was a time when she compromised because of Bella, she still managed to pull through it.

Just when she thought she had gotten used to her current life, Nox suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and she did not know how many more years she would have to endure.

She put on the band-aid and said to Nox, “It’s done.”

Seeing that she did not answer his question, he gulped and swallowed the words he wanted to say..
