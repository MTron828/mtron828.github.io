1015 Identity Exposed: Jeanne Is the Sanders’ Third Princess!

Was it because she was stupid?

Was she so stupid that even the heavens wanted to punish her?

“Monica.” Ruby was also shocked by Monica’s reaction, and she hurriedly pulled her back. “Monica, don’t panic. Nothing will happen. Your father will be fine.”

Monica’s tears were rolling down her cheeks.

She tried her best to control her emotions and suppress them. However, it felt terrible.

Soon, a few doctors in white coats appeared in the corridor. They were all a little old.

A doctor walked over and said to Ruby and Monica with great guilt, “I’m the director of this hospital. I’m very sorry that the attending doctor fainted during the surgery because of an unexpected accident and caused some difficulties in the surgery. Now, we have urgently contacted our hospital’s prestigious cardiology doctor to support this surgery, and he’ll be here soon. Please rest assured. We will consider whether to continue or stop the operation according to the progress of the surgery. We will do our best to ensure the patient’s safety. Please trust us!”

“What else can I do but trust you guys?” Monica’s tears kept flowing. “Other than trusting you, what else can we do…”

She was already choking with sobs.

At that moment, the door of the operating theatre suddenly opened.

Monica turned around and saw Finn suddenly walking out of the operating theatre. Her vision was blurry at the time, so she thought she was seeing things.

However, when she could see him clearly, she was so frightened that she almost fainted.

Finn had come out with the attending doctor who fainted.

Did it mean that her father had already…

“I’ll do my best to perform the heart transplant on uncle. The surgery will take a long time, so please be patient,” Finn said quickly and anxiously.

Monica stared blankly at Finn.

Did he mean that her father could still be saved?

After saying that, Finn turned around and went in.

He could not afford to waste a single second. It was clearly an emergency, yet he had come out personally to assure her of her dad’s safety.

However, with no time to consider that much, Monica shouted behind Finn’s back, “Finn, you must save my father.”

Finn did not turn around or stop, but he raised his hand and gestured an “ok” with his hand before disappearing from her sight.

That was the most glorious and greatest back view Monica had ever seen.

She tried to calm herself down. At the same time, she looked at her mother, who was also scared out of her wits.

It seemed like Finn’s sudden appearance had given them some reassurance because Ruby had also calmed down.

Then, the two of them sat down in their chairs again.

A doctor entered halfway, and after that, no one came out.

Monica was also in no mood to care about Cardellini Enterprise’s affairs. To her, her father’s surgery was more important than anything else.

The surgery took a long time. It was even longer than what was suggested in theory.

It started at 9:30 a.m. in the morning, and it was now 9:30 p.m. in the evening. It had been a full 12 hours, but why was it not over yet?

However, the corridor was still quiet, and everyone was waiting quietly.

Other than Monica and Ruby, Sarah, who had just finished her class, had also arrived. Her parents were also waiting quietly in the corridor.

They waited anxiously until finally, the lights of the operating theatre went out. The door opened slowly, and a doctor in scrubs walked out. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, it was not Finn. It was one of the cardiologists who entered later in the surgery.

Monica stood up from her chair. The moment she stood up, she felt his body go limp.

Sarah held onto Monica.

Ruby did not dare to ask the doctor anything. She just looked straight at him and watched as the doctor walked over with an exhausted expression.

Monica tried her best to straighten her back.

She told herself that nothing would happen and that her father would be fine.

At that moment, the doctor said in a low voice, “The surgery wasn’t a success.”

Monica’s eyes instantly turned red, and she clenched her fists while facing the doctor.

“At the most critical moment of the heart transplant, the specialist suddenly fainted, causing the heart transplant to be delayed. However, it also caused problems with the patient’s blood circulation during the surgery, resulting in insufficient blood supply to the brain. After Dr. Jones’s emergency treatment, he barely managed to save the patient’s life, but it still caused a certain degree of brain damage. At that time, the patient’s original heart had already been removed, so there was no way to stop the surgery to deal with the brain damage first. The surgery could only continue. The heart transplant surgery is a success, but we can’t determine if the brain damage suffered during the surgery has any impact on the patient. The worst outcome is that the patient will never wake up again.”
