Chapter 214: Uncover the Truth While a Sudden Accident Happens

Of course, Jeanne did not think it was that simple.

She turned to Adrian and asked, “Now that Tenda has admitted it, do you have anything else to say, Chief Engineer Zimmer?”

Adrian gritted his teeth and did not say anything.

“Chief Engineer Zimmer, I have to remind you of something. If you admit that the whole thing was planned by you, your sentence will be increased by at least five years on top of the original sentence! Not only that, but you’ll also have to compensate for all the expenses incurred in this case, including the loss of profits in the dual contract and all the legal fees incurred in this court. I’m guessing that you’ll lose everything!”

Adrian was obviously threatened.

He stared at Jeanne.

Jeanne did not rush him and gave him time to think.

Adrian looked away and seemed to be glancing at Lunetta at that moment.

It was just one glance.

Jeanne could basically conclude that Lunetta must have played a lot of roles in this case, such as giving advice and planning. Moreover, Adrian probably trusted Lunetta very much.

All of a sudden, Lunetta unexpectedly collapsed to the ground.

Without any warning, she suddenly collapsed to the ground.

Everyone was shocked.

After a few seconds of shock, a staff member quickly went forward and carried Lunetta away.

At this moment, Adrian suddenly became extremely agitated.

He looked very abnormal as if he had suddenly gone crazy. He kept screaming and repeatedly hitting the table. He looked very terrifying.

The scene was in chaos.

The police officers in the court rushed forward to restrain Adrian. Adrian’s veins were bulging, and his emotions were out of control.

In the end, they took him away from the court.

As a result, the case could not go to trial.

Jeanne sneered.

These people made things a little trickier for her.

After a long while, it was calm again.

Monica had cursed 10,000 times from her seat!

The climax ended abruptly.

What kind of script was this?!

At this moment, Eden and Joshua could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

If they were given more time, there would be more possible outcomes.

Joshua thought that he was dead for sure.

He thought that Adrian would definitely give him up.

“Due to the sudden loss of control of the defendant’s emotions and the fact that someone passed out at the scene, the case has been adjourned. The trial date will be announced again when it is confirmed,” the judge announced, “The court is adjourned!”

The judge and the trial bench left first.

Next, the others also left one after another.

Jeanne also followed Judah, her lawyer, out of the court.

Just as she walked to the entrance of the court, she saw Fourth Master Swan standing there from afar.

It seemed that he was waiting for her.

Not far from Fourth Master Swan, Kingsley and George were also waiting for her.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Did she have to do this?!

In the end, Jeanne walked toward Kingsley.

Kingsley smiled.

He seemed to be provoking Edward on purpose.

Jeanne could not help but roll her eyes.

‘Does he have to be so childish?’

Jeanne followed Kingsley and walked out of the court.

At the same time, she was being watched closely from behind. It made her... feel uncomfortable.

Monica was also with Fourth Master Swan. At this moment, when she saw Jeanne leaving with another man, she was stunned for two seconds. Next, she said, “Fourth Master, your wife ran away!”

Then, she chased after Jeanne.

Edward’s expression finally changed.

Nox laughed gloatingly.

Fourth Master Swan was finally heartlessly abandoned by a woman.

Back then, Fourth Master Swan did not even lay his eyes on any woman. None of the women who wanted to seduce him could get close to him. In fact, they were scared to death by his cold aura!

Now, he was getting his karma!

Monica panted and caught up to Jeanne. “Jeannie, you damn rich woman. Why are you walking so fast?!”

Jeanne stopped and turned around to smile at Monica. “I thought you’d leave with Dr. Jones.”

“Don’t associate me with that b*stard. We’re going to get a divorce soon,” Monica said righteously.

Under such circumstances, Jeanne could not say much.

“Oh right, who’s this? I’ve never seen him before...” Monica looked at Kingsley with a face full of curiosity.

At this time, a group of reporters suddenly swarmed over.

They surrounded them all.

Monica hated this group of busybodies the most.

“Ms. Lawrence, you won your lawsuit this time. You were falsely accused and were acquitted as a result. May I know how you’re feeling now?”

“Ms. Lawrence, I heard that you revealed at the scene of the court that your personal assets were 53 billion dollars in total. Is that true?”

“Ms. Lawrence, may I ask if the 53 billion dollars belong to you? If It’s true, you’ll be the person with the most personal assets in Harken apart from Zachary Swan. In other words, you’re the richest woman in Harken.”

“Ms. Lawrence...”

Jeanne and her people were blocked by the reporters.

Although the questions were very annoying, she had no choice but to answer them.

Jeanne said, “The acquittal is only a legal fact. I don’t have too many emotions. After all, I knew this was going to be the end result.”

She sounded magnanimous.

It was as though this was a matter of course and was not worth being excited about.

“Then the 53 billion dollars that you have...”

“That is also a fact. As long as the money was earned properly, it’ll be my private property. I don’t feel that I need to explain anything to everyone,” Jeanne briefly answered. As such, the reporters did not know what else to say.

“What about the relationship between you and Fourth Master Swan?” A reporter pressed again.

“If the timing is right, we’ll announce it to the public.”

“Ms. Lawrence, can you elaborate? What do you mean by the right timing? Before going to court, Fourth Master Swan publicly said that the two of you are dating.”

Jeanne pursed her lips. At that moment, she was also somewhat dumbfounded by the reporter’s question.

She did not want to admit her relationship with Fourth Master Swan. If she did, Kingsley would probably beat her to death.

Despite that, she could not embarrass Fourth Master Swan in front of everyone at this moment as well.

Caught in a tricky situation, Monica made herself useful. “What’s the point of being concerned about the relationship between Fourth Master Swan and Jeannie? Will that make your article look good? At this moment, you should be concerned about whether Eden was regretful or not when he cheated on Jeanne and chose Jasmine back then!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The eyes of the reporters lit up when Monica reminded them.

“The people in question are over there. It’s best to seize your opportunity to question them properly. Ask Eden if he ever thought that Jeannie would return with great glory after he abandoned her back then. Oh, remember to also ask Jasmine if she had ever thought that there would be such a big gap between her and Jeanne one day!” Monica said excitedly.

In fact, these were all things that she wanted to know.

As bystanders, the others also naturally wanted to know what she wanted to know.

The reporters immediately left Jeanne and rushed toward Eden.

They also knew that they could not get much from Jeanne. What they could know was already mentioned in court.

At this moment, Eden had just come out of the court and heard what Monica told the reporters.

His face was extremely dark.

He had never thought of leaving at this time too. He knew that there would be reporters waiting outside. Despite that, since his fourth uncle had asked him to leave with him, he could only bite the bullet and bring Jasmine out. As soon as he walked out, he was surrounded by reporters.

At this moment, Eden wondered if his fourth uncle did it on purpose.

Edward deliberately made him look so embarrassed.

Eden gritted his teeth.

In front of so many reporters and cameras, he could only force a smile.
