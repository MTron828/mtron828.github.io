1263 A Sudden Heartwarming Moment, My Sister Will Be Named Paige

It was not obvious at first, and George thought he was mistaken. However, at that moment, he was pleasantly surprised.

“Mom, my sister is really greeting me.” George’s eyes were filled with stars.

It was the kind of excitement that only a child would have.

Jeanne’s lips curled into a faint smile. The moment George touched her stomach, she touched his hand as well.

That was when George returned to his senses. He could not believe he had been bribed so quickly, and it made him a little angry, but he did not refuse her touch.

“George, you should name your sister,” Jeanne suddenly said.

George’s attention was once again diverted by Jeanne, and the wheels in his head were turning.

“But let’s eat first,” Jeanne reminded him.

Only then did George sit down at the dining table reluctantly. He told himself that he was only following his mother’s instructions because he wanted to name his sister.

He obediently picked at the food on his plate, and as he ate, he was thinking about it seriously.

In fact, he was not looking forward to that sister of his. He had always felt that he was not well-liked in his family, so if he had a sibling, would he lose his status in life?

However, having felt his sister move in his palm somehow warmed his heart. He could not describe the feeling, but he just really liked it when she greeted him like that.

“Paige,” he said.

Edward and Jeanne were eating lunch when they were stunned by George’s excited voice. Both of them turned to look at George together.

Under their gaze, George felt a little shy. He said, “I’m George and she’ll be Paige. Is that okay?”

His face was filled with anticipation.

Jeanne smiled. “Alright.”

That would make them a family of four.

A bright smile was plastered on George’s face when he got Jeanne’s approval. It was obvious how happy he was.

Jeanne looked at her seven-year-old son’s innocence. Her throat moved, but she lowered his head and continued eating her lunch.

Edward, too, was eating silently, and it was a rare sight to see their family so harmonious.

After lunch, Edward got changed. Seeing that he was about to go out, Jeanne did not ask further. Since she had chosen to spend the last two months with him, she would really be with him.

He said, “I’ll send George off.”

“Alright.” Jeanne smiled.

She knew that if it were not for Old Master Swan’s passing, George would not be able to come back so often. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Edward seemed to take a few more glances at her before leaving with George.

“George,” Jeanne suddenly called out to him.

George had no expectations of his mother saying goodbye to him at first, but because he heard his mother’s voice, he looked forward to it.

Jeanne walked to George and said, “Take care of yourself.”

George nodded. In the face of his mother’s tenderness, he could not bring himself to push her away at all.

“Why don’t you feel your sister, Paige, one more time?” Jeanne smiled.

George’s little hand was once again placed on Jeanne’s round belly. After he put his hand there, Paige moved again in his palm, and the movement was obvious.

“Mom, Paige is greeting me again.” George had a big, surprised smile on his face.

“Paige seems to like you a lot.”

“Really?”

“It’s true. Sometimes, no matter how I call her, she won’t respond to me. But whenever you touch her, she wants to say hello to you.” Jeanne laughed.

“I like Paige, too.” It was rare for George to express his feelings so readily.

“In the future...” Jeanne said with a smile and gently stroked George’s head. “You have to become stronger and take good care of your sister.

“Yes.” George nodded.

He would definitely protect his sister well and not allow any harm to come to her.

“Be good and go with your dad.” Jeanne let go of George.

George reluctantly pulled away from his mother’s belly and looked up at her smiling. It was as if they had returned to the past, the days when they had to depend on each other in the Delta Islands.

He actually missed the Delta Islands and Kingsley very much, but he would not say it out loud. The only thing on his mind was that when he grew up, he must become a man who could protect his mother and sister.

With that, George left with Edward.

The moment he left, he could not help but turn back. He turned around and saw that his mother’s eyes were filled with tears. Little did George know at the time that her glance was farewell!
