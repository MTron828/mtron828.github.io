However, he was extremely jealous of Benjamin.

“When did you get together?” Nox asked calmly.

Just when Shelly felt that Nox was a ticking time bomb, he suddenly asked her in a very calm voice, and it made Shelly frown.

She looked back at Benjamin and saw him standing there with his wet clothes. He was obviously worried that Nox would do something to her.

Then, she turned to look back at Nox. “What does it have to do with you?”

She wanted to cut off all ties with Nox, so there was no need to answer any of his questions directly.

“Have you slept together?” Nox asked again when Shelly did not answer.

As Shelly really did not want to talk to Nox, she did not answer his question. “What do you want?”

Nox suddenly laughed, thinking how f*cking ironic it was! Just when he thought that Shelly would shed tears of gratitude and be with him without hesitation because he had fallen in love with her, she had gotten together with another man. She was even living with the man, and he had to see them together!

Nox’s sudden smile made Shelly’s expression turn ugly. She did not know what he was laughing about, but she felt that any of his actions and expressions would make her instinctively hate and reject him.

“Can’t you restrain yourself a little? Can’t you be a little less impatient?” Nox asked her with a sneer.

Shelly had no idea what Nox was talking about, nor did she want to ask.

Instead, she looked at Nox coldly and believed that Nox had gone crazy today!

“Why do you have to have a man so quickly? Why do you have to live together so quickly? Shelly, how can you be so cheap?” Nox gritted his teeth.

‘How could you trample on my feelings for you? I had just mustered up the courage to ask you to come back to my side. How could you end up getting together with another man?’ Nox screamed in his heart.

“I don’t know what you want to say today, but are you possessed? Nox, I don’t need to explain my matters to you, nor do I need your permission! You have no right to tell me what to do in my life. We have nothing to do with each other!” Shelly made it clear.

She did not know if Nox would listen to her. However, she had to remind Nox that they had nothing to do with each other so that he would not come looking for trouble with her on purpose again.

“We have nothing to do with each other?” Nox laughed sarcastically.

Shelly’s face turned ugly.

“I f*cking deserve to be trampled on by you!” he suddenly roared and lost control. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It gave Shelly a fright, and because of Nox’s sudden rage, Benjamin instinctively shielded Shelly behind him to protect her.

Nox did not understand why Benjamin could protect Shelly like how a boyfriend should do when he, in all his years of loving a woman, had never been able to treat a woman like that.

Furious, Nox punched Benjamin hard in the face. After being punched, Benjamin’s vision went black for a second, and he was in so much pain that he almost fainted.

At that moment, Shelly was shocked as she did not expect Nox to be so evil that he would hit someone. She had always thought that Nox was just sharp-tongued, but she could not believe that he would take it so far.

Shelly immediately wanted to push Nox away, but Nox kicked Benjamin hard in the stomach. Since Benjamin was not a strong man, to begin with, he immediately fell to the ground.

Shellshocked, Shelly screamed, “Nox, are you crazy?

Her disgust for Nox had reached its peak. However, it was as if Nox could not hear her. He was filled with so much anger that he had to release it.

He strode to Benjamin and kicked him hard a few more times. Benjamin did not even have the strength to resist before Nox punched and kicked him again

and again.

Shelly was frightened by Nox. She gritted her teeth and pulled Nox away, wanting him to stop. Just as she grabbed his arm, Nox pushed her away, and Shelly almost fell to the ground..
