Chapter 159: I’ll Never Sleep With the Woman I Don’t Like

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“F*ck.” Nox cursed.

He even especially wanted to come over and give Fourth Master Swan some pointers. He wondered if he was worrying too much.

He once suspected that Edward did not sleep with Ms.Lawrence last time, which resulted in Ms.Lawrence ignoring him.

As expected.

Edward was good at everything he did!

…

In the black car.

Eden sent Melody back. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Melody’s eyes were still red, and her emotions were on the verge of exploding.

Eden was also angry at this moment, but he did not dare to show it in front of Melody.

It was extremely quiet in the car.

They arrived at the Sanders mansion.

Eden was ready to open the car door and get out.

“Eden,” Melody suddenly called out to him.

At this moment, he was no longer as mad as before, and he had become incomparably cold-blooded.

“Ms.Sanders.”

“As long as you can kill Jeanne, I will agree to whatever you want!”

Eden was stunned.

Melody’s face was filled with malevolence, “Kill Jeanne!”

Eden was stunned by Melody’s sudden outburst and he forgot to reply.

Melody directly opened the car door and got out of the car.

She only gave Eden an order and did not even consider his consent.

She walked into the Sanders mansion and picked up the phone. “Send my order. Tomorrow, the planning department is not allowed to agree to Klaus’ transportation plan for the construction of the Lawrence Enterprise’s Logistics Warehouse.”

“But...” the other side seemed to be in a difficult position.

The news they had received before was obviously to accept Klaus’ design.

“To protect the safety of the territory’s resources, Harken does not accept outsiders interfering in the country’s internal affairs, so tactfully rejects his help.”

“This seems a little too far-fetched,” the other side said weakly.

“I will be responsible for the consequences. You follow my instructions!” Melody said coldly.

The other side did not dare to say anything more.

Melody fiercely hung up the phone, and a trace of cruelty flashed in her eyes.

She would never let Jeanne off.

She was willing to do anything, even if it meant she might lose more in the end.

…

Bamboo Garden.

Nox waited on the sofa for a long time before he heard a sound from the stairs.

He quickly walked over and watched Edward come down the stairs.

He did not expect it.

It had been so long.

Nox’s smile was very evil.

Edward glanced at him and walked past him.

“Is Ms.Lawrence still resting?” Nox asked on purpose.

Edward ignored him.

Nox wanted to say something more when he saw Jeanne coming down from upstairs.

Jeanne had already changed into the new clothes that Fourth Master Swan had bought for her.

From the inside out, the measurements of the clothes were so accurate that it made her shy.

“Ms.Lawrence doesn’t sleep much...” Nox smiled.

His teasing voice was forcefully suppressed by a gaze.

Nox swallowed his saliva.

Alright, he was superfluous.

He shut his mouth.

Jeanne did not bother with Nox. She walked towards Fourth Master Swan and said, “I’m leaving.”

“I’ll send you off after lunch.”

Jeanne still wanted to say something when Teddy stepped forward respectfully and said, “Fourth Master, Ms.Lawrence, lunch is ready.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

In the end, she still followed Fourth Master Swan to the western dining table outside the balcony.

There were already many dishes on the dining table.

Teddy said respectfully, “Since Ms.Lawrence is not picky about food, we have randomly prepared some.”

Fourth Master Swan nodded slightly. “You may leave first.”

“Yes.”

Teddy hurriedly left.

Only the two of them were left on the dining table.

At this moment, Fourth Master Swan did not take his utensils, so Jeanne was too embarrassed to make the first move.

She just waited like this. Instead of the utensils, Fourth Master Swan suddenly held her hand.

Jeanne pursed her lips and looked at him.

A kiss was imprinted on her palm.

The warm breath made her... heart skip a beat.

His magnetic voice said, “You worked hard just now.”

“...”

“This is a thank you gift,” he said seriously to her palm.
