1130 The War Has Started: The Battle of Wits Between Jeanne and Edward

At that moment, Nox saw Edward suddenly stand up and leave.

Just like that, Nox immediately jumped up from the sofa and quickly chased after him.

He grabbed Edward, who was about to get into the car. “Where are you going?!”

It was not safe outside.

After Kingsley’s death and the Duncans’ existence were exposed, the Sanders must have started to make a move on the Swans. There must be people everywhere who wanted to kill Edward!

“Edward, calm down.” Nox grabbed his hand tightly and did not let go.

However, Edward did not calm down.

He suddenly pushed Nox away.

Nox did not even think twice. In the next second, he stepped forward and crazily tried to restrain Edward.

The two of them started fighting, and the fight was intense.

Nox was, of course, no match for Edward, but he was very resilient.

Even when Edward had been beaten to the ground, he was still clinging onto Edward’s leg, not letting him go no matter what. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Nox!”

“I won’t let you go out and court your own death! I know what you’re going to do now. You’re going to find Alex! There’s no way Alex would meet you alone, especially at this time. Once the Sanders find out that you’re meeting someone alone, that person will definitely become a suspect. Alex would rather you be shot to death by the Sanders than meet you!” Nox said fiercely.

In fact, he was not stupid and could figure out anything.

However, he just did not want to think too much most of the time as he felt that being like Edward was too tiring for him.

Edward clenched his fists.

“Edward, you should calm down and think about what we should do next!” Nox kept hugging Edward’s thigh and reminded him.

Edward and Nox were in a stalemate for a long time.

He had never lost control of himself like this before, no matter what kind of life-and-death situation he was in.

If not for Nox’s reminder, he might have really done something that could not be undone.

Suddenly, he calmed down. In fact, it might have taken him less than ten minutes to calm down.

He said, “Nox, let me go.”

At that moment, Nox seemed to relax, but he also hugged Edward even tighter.

“I’m very calm,” Edward said bluntly.

Once he said he was calm, he would not do anything abrupt again. Even when he was calm and he did something abrupt, it would definitely be something he had thought about carefully.

Therefore, Nox let him go.

Edward pulled Nox up from the ground and brought him back to the main hall.

Teddy was really shocked by the Fourth Master.

“Teddy, you may leave,” Edward ordered.

Teddy quickly left. He was afraid that even a second of delay would cost him his life.

Edward said, “Nox, you’re right. We should think about what we should do next.”

The point was… There was no way Alex would meet him.

Once he had that idea, he might be killed by random gunfire on his way to meet Alex.

Just now, he even wanted to discuss things with Alex from an emotional standpoint.

However, in the face of national affairs, there was no place for emotions to exist.

Nox endured the pain all over his body and hurriedly nodded. “Since the situation has developed to this point, I think that the best way is for us, the Duncans, the entire Harken, and even for Jeanne, who you’re most worried about, to end it quickly.”

Edward agreed. “That’s why we should be thinking about how to speed up the outbreak of this war.”

“Yes.” Nox nodded.

He felt that Edward had calmed down or rather forced himself to calm down.

Edward said, “The Sanders obviously know about the existence of the Duncans, but they can’t find out where the descendant is. The only thing they can be sure of is that the Swans are under the power of the Duncans. Yesterday, I was able to escape unscathed from the Sanders’ wedding only because the Sanders still had Jeanne as their trump card. Now, my relationship with Jeanne is ruined, so the first thing he’s going to do is to figure out how to get rid of the Swans.”

“Previously, Warren didn’t dare to act rashly without concrete evidence because he was afraid of causing internal conflicts in Harken. But now that he knows that the Swans are a force that opposes him, even if he takes a risk, he will kill our family!” Edward looked at Nox. “But Warren is the leader of this country, so he can’t do so many things openly. Other than using the remaining assassins of the Hills to help him carry out the assassination, it’s very likely that he will find a false charge and convict us!”
