Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In just five minutes, Shelly closed her eyes and repeated it twice. After confirming that there were no problems, she said to the man, “I’m ready.”

“Are you sure?” The man was shocked again that she could memorize it in five minutes.

“Yes.”

“I hope you can say it word for word and not paraphrase. After all, many of the words in it were thought out by our team after careful consideration, and you can’t make a single mistake. If you do, people might misunderstand it all.” The man was very serious. “I hope we don’t waste too much of everyone’s time.” “I can recite it word for word.” Shelly was very sure.

The man still did not seem to believe her, so Shelly handed the script to the man for him to read. Then, she recited everything she had just memorized word for word.

After reciting it, the man was still a little shocked. Not a single word was wrong, and it was very smooth.

The man cleared his throat and said, “You’ve memorized it very well, but your tone is wrong. Come here, I’ll read it out for you so you know what it should sound like when you’re in front of the camera later.”

Shelly nodded cooperatively while Nox sat on the sofa with his legs crossed, watching Shelly pay close attention to the man’s instructions. She did not make a fuss, and in fact, she seemed very enthusiastic about it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, Nox’s expression was grim as he had not had a good day. He just looked at Shelly coldly, wondering how heartless Shelly was. He had read the public relations drafts, and anyone else would not have accepted it, but Shelly did not react at all.

He rolled his eyes, took out his phone, and suddenly started a game. As the saying went, out of sight, out of mind.

Shelly listened to the man for about half an hour when the man nodded and said, “That’s about it. Let’s try it out first.”

“Alright.”

Shelly sat in front of the camera and looked at the camera, waiting for the man’s instructions. When the man gave her a hand signal, Shelly nodded.

Then, she said to the camera, “I’m Shelly, and I’m also the female lead in the video that Zoe exposed Nox’s affair yesterday. I’m not trying to attract attention at this time or gain popularity. It’s just that Zoe exposed the video of me and Nox, and as the person involved, I think I should clarify a fact for everyone.”

The first paragraph was good, and the man gave Shelly an ‘OK’ gesture.

Shelly continued, “Some people might know about my relationship with Nox. When I was young, I was the companion the Winters brought back for Nox. Ever since I joined the Winters, I had always wanted to marry Nox. However, even after many years, Nox had no feelings for me. In fact, I had tried many times, but in the end, Nox rejected me, and I had no choice but to give up. After giving up, I left the Winters and lived alone.

“At first, I thought that I would never interact with Nox again in my life, but because I was working at the nightclub, I happened to bump into Nox and Zoe at the nightclub for a drink that day. It had been many years since we last met, and I thought I had no feelings for Nox. But when I saw Nox and Zoe being so intimate and loving in front of me, I was crazy jealous.

“That night, Nox and Zoe drank a lot. When they were both drunk, I secretly drugged Nox and made Nox sleep with me. I wanted to use the video to break Nox and Zoe up, but when I gave the video to Zoe and told her to leave Nox, Zoe said she did not mind. She said that she believed Nox wouldn’t do anything to hurt him and that she wouldn’t be threatened by me. I also threatened Nox with the video, and Nox was even less threatened by me. In fact, that wasn’t the first time I used this method to scheme against Nox. Before I left the Winters, I climbed into Nox’s bed when he was drunk, but because Nox didn’t like me, it was useless.

“Knowing that I couldn’t destroy their relationship, I thought of extortion. I got 50 thousand dollars and 200 thousand dollars from Nox and Zoe respectively and then gave the video to them. I thought this matter would be over and that I would be living well with their money, but because Zoe suddenly exposed the video and framed Nox, I had no choice but to stand up and explain the matter. As for why I’m standing up and getting myself involved in this mess instead of taking the money and living a good life, firstly, Nox came to look for me. He hoped that I could tell the truth.

“Secondly, I was the one who caused this matter, so I have to tell the truth, or my conscience will be uneasy..”
