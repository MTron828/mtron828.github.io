Chapter 166: The Night Between Edward and Jeanne Seven Years Ago

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan in a daze.

At that moment when she looked at him, she was even smiling.

There was silence between the two of them.

“This is for you,” Edward said.

As he spoke, he handed over the flowers.

He handed over the huge bouquet with one hand.

It was as if he was giving Jeanne a piece of candy.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She accepted it with both hands. “Thank you.”

“Let’s go eat,” Edward said.

Jeanne hesitated for a second.

She then got into Fourth Master Swan’s car.

Such a huge bouquet was eye-catching.

Although the car was very spacious, Jeanne still had some difficulty hugging it.

As for Fourth Master Swan, who was sitting next to her, he seemed to be very at ease.

He could not tell that Jeanne was finding it difficult hugging such a huge bouquet. He was probably feeling good about what he did. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The car arrived at Chez Jeanne.

Edward got out of the car and opened the car door for Jeanne.

Jeanne felt that it was neither right to leave the bouquet in the car nor take it with her.

In the end, she still held it in her arms and followed Fourth Master Swan into the restaurant.

‘Has the whole restaurant been booked?!’

Other than a few waiters, there were no other customers.

Nevertheless, Edward and Jeanne still walked into the familiar private room.

After the two of them sat down, Jeanne finally put down the bouquet.

To be honest, she felt silly holding it in her arms.

“What do you like to eat, Ms. Lawrence?” Edward asked while he was ordering.

“Didn’t Teddy tell you already? I can eat anything.”

“You’re so easy to take care of?” The corners of Edward’s mouth curled up.

Jeanne did not reply.

After Edward ordered the dishes, the two of them sat quietly.

“Ms. Lawrence, do you know what day it is today?” Edward took the initiative to ask.

Jeanne frowned.

She looked at Edward and asked, “Your birthday?”

Edward’s expression changed slightly.

It seemed that Jeanne had guessed wrongly.

It was not her birthday either.

What day was it then?

“It seems that you’ve forgotten, Ms. Lawrence.” Edward was indifferent. No emotions could be seen on his face.

Jeanne did not want to know either.

To her, it was not important.

The atmosphere was somewhat awkward.

Fortunately, at this moment, the waiters began to serve their food.

Edward stood up. He took the wine decanter with red wine in it and poured a glass of red wine for Jeanne.

Jeanne opened her mouth but did not say anything in the end.

She picked up her cutlery and lowered her head to eat her food.

She ate silently.

“Are you starving?” Edward asked.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She raised her head and put down her cutlery.

Afterward, she raised her wine glass. “Fourth Master, here’s to you.”

As soon as she finished, she downed the wine in one go.

Edward looked at Jeanne.

He pursed his lips slowly. “It’s very expensive, Ms. Lawrence. It’s better to savor it.”

“I’m in a hurry,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Edward looked at her. “Do you have something else to do?”

“Fourth Master.” Jeanne wiped the corner of her mouth. “There’s something I want to say to you.”

“Go ahead.” Edward’s expression did not change.

In fact, Jeanne always felt that this man had seen through everything.

Perhaps he knew what she wanted to say.

Jeanne secretly took a deep breath and said, “My deal with you ends here.”

Edward did not speak.

One could never know his emotions by looking at his expression.

Jeanne did not know whether he was angry at this moment or... Well, she did not care.

She continued, “I’m not capable enough to defeat the Sanders. If you still want to use this method to reject the marriage, please find someone else.”

“Do you still think that I’m using you?” Edward asked nonchalantly.

“To me, it is not important whether you’re using me or not. What is important is that I want to distance myself from you.”

“Is that so?” Edward’s thin lips moved slightly.

Although he did not show any emotion, at this moment, Jeanne felt that his aura was very strong.

Jeanne said straightforwardly, “I hope you’ll fulfill my wish.”

“What if I say no?” Fourth Master Swan stared deeply at her.

“Nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable.”

“Whether it’s agreeable or not, you don’t need to tell me.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“Have you been threatened by someone these past two days?” Edward raised his eyebrow and spoke in a light tone.

He seemed to be able to see through Jeanne’s heart with one look.

“There are many people who have threatened me. I just feel that being entangled with you is a waste of our time.”

“A waste of time...” Edward muttered. He looked straight at Jeanne. “Are all women so fickle?”

Jeanne was stunned.

“I thought you had feelings for me.”

“No.”

“I thought you helped me with my body’s needs because you like me.”

“I don’t like you.” Jeanne was very sure.

“Who threatened you?” Edward’s eyes turned cold.

At this moment, Jeanne sensed his strong and undisguised aura.
