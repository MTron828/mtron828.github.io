Chapter 60: I’ve Taken a Liking to... Your Son!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“So...” The female principal’s expression was serious. Looking at everyone present, she enunciated each word and asked, “Any objections?”

The entire hall was silent.

No one had expected that the seemingly unremarkable George would be so amazing!

They disdained George just now, but they were now stupefied.

Phoebe was the one who suffered the most. She had always looked down on George and had always thought that her son was a hundred times better than George. She had never expected this to happen.

She stood there with embarrassment, jealousy, and anger.

It made her look twisted!

Edward, who was sitting below, looked at George with a smile.

Nox, who was next to him, was also surprised by George.

He had a feeling that with George was not too bad, but he had never expected that the brat was so amazing!

In the hall, no one said another word!

The female principal seemed to have expected this result. She announced solemnly, “Since there are no objections, today’s interview is over. Thank you for your participation. Goodbye.”

Then, she turned around and left.

George also returned to Jeanne’s side.

While everyone was still in a state of shock, Jeanne held George’s hand and took the lead to leave.

Just as they walked out of the hall…

“Ms. Lawrence.” A familiar male voice came from behind.

Jeanne stopped in her tracks.

She turned around.

Fourth Master Swan brought his nephew and stood there with Nox by his side.

Jeanne forced herself to smile. “Fourth Master, can I help you?”

“I’ve taken a liking to… your son!” Fourth Master Swan’s thin lips moved slightly.

‘Is this fella really crazy?!’

Jeanne looked straight at Fourth Master Swan. He left after saying that.

‘F*ck!

‘He’s crazy!’

Jeanne held her son’s hand and returned to the small car.

George was still sitting in the back seat.

Jeanne was driving at a normal speed. She looked at George through the rearview mirror. “Do you want a reward?”

“No.” George was calm.

He was very calm from the beginning to the end.

Actually, Jeanne felt a little happy during the whole process.

“But I don’t like Fourth Master Swan,” George added.

“Am I right to say that your reward is to keep Fourth Master Swan away from us?” Jeanne asked.

George nodded. “Yes.”

“Alright.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

She felt that this kind of reward was very easy to achieve.

Little did she know…

That someone could be so shameless!

Jeanne brought George back to the Lawrences family’s manor.

At this moment, Phoebe had also returned.

Phoebe was crying in the hall while Paul was also crying next to her as if he had suffered a great grievance.

Jenifer was also a little angry. Firstly, Paul, who had always given her hope, was not selected. Secondly, she heard that George was actually a genius. She had always hated to see others being good, so she naturally had all sorts of twisted thoughts.

At this moment, Jenifer raised her head and saw Jeanne and George walking in. They walked past them as if no one was around.

“Jeanne.” Jenifer’s tone was very cold.

Phoebe saw that Jeanne had returned and cried even harder.

At this moment, Alexander was not around either.

Jeanne glanced at Jenifer. “What’s wrong with Little Mother?”

“What do you mean by what you did today?!” Jenifer did not pretend anymore. She stood up from the sofa and looked a little aggressive.

“What did I do?” Jeanne pretended to be stupid.

“Why didn’t you tell us that George is a genius?! By doing this today, are you deliberately embarrassing my nephew?!” Jenifer said fiercely.

“She did it on purpose,” Phoebe complained while crying, “Sis, you don’t know how embarrassed Paul and I were at the scene. From now on, I don’t dare to bring Paul out anymore...”

After saying that, she cried even louder.

Jeanne was very calm. She said, “Is it hereditary for your family members to always complain first whenever something happens?”

“Jeanne, how can you say that?!” Jenifer used the topic as an excuse and said “No matter what, she’s still your elder, and I’m also your elder. Are you so disrespectful to your elders?”

“It depends on whether you learn to respect yourself.”

“Jeanne!”

“If you hadn’t disdained George in front of everyone, would you have been slapped his face so miserably?!” Jeanne sneered.

“I wasn’t looking down on George; I was just telling the truth...”

“To say the least, we’re still relatives. You said George was useless in front of so many people. If George was really useless, would he still be able to hold his head up high in the future?” Jeanne questioned, “At least I didn’t say that Paul is useless! Although compared to George, he really didn’t have any strengths.”

“Jeanne, that’s enough!” Jenifer’s voice was sharp, “This is the Lawrence family’s manor. We can’t tolerate you being so lawless!”

“You know this is the Lawrence family’s manor?” Jeanne mocked, “As an outsider, shouldn’t you have some self-awareness and shut up?”

“You!” Jenifer was furious.

Jeanne smiled. “Many wrongdoings lead to self-destruction. This saying is meant for you.”

“Your lesson from seven years ago wasn’t enough, was it?” Jenifer did not pretend anymore and asked Jeanne through gritted teeth.

“It was enough.” Jeanne’s expression turned cold. “That’s why I’m going to make you pay!”

Her last few words made people shudder.

Jenifer’s heart froze.

Jeanne had turned around and lazily said, “I’ve never felt that George is a genius, let alone that there are no geniuses in this world. There are only comparisons. After all, there are always people better than you, so there’s nothing to show off about. Unlike some people... who like to be arrogant.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Jeanne!” Phoebe heard the sarcasm in Jeanne’s words and raged.

Jeanne did not bother with them anymore. It was a waste of time.

She held onto George’s hand and went upstairs to her room.

Phoebe was crying so hard that her heart was tearing apart. It was as if Jeanne had done something serious. “Sister, Sister, look at Jeanne. She doesn’t even see us as a threat. Look at her smug face...”

“Enough!” Jenifer scolded angrily.

Phoebe looked at Jenifer in shock.

“In the end, it’s your son who isn’t capable enough. What’s the use of crying and making a scene? Who can you blame if your son isn’t capable enough?!” Jenifer said fiercely.

Phoebe saw that Jenifer was angry, so she swallowed her anger and did not dare to say anything else.

“Pack your things and leave now.”

“Sister, Sister, don’t you care about your nephew anymore? Don’t you care about the only son of the Fabians?” Phoebe asked in a panic.

Jeremy, who had not been able to say anything, was also anxious. “Sister, you can’t do this. It wasn’t easy for the Fabians to have such a son! Can you please ask your husband to help us pull some strings!”

Jeremy and his wife did not know the inside story, but Jenifer knew very well that the Lawrences did not have the face to ask Angerburg to accept Paul.

She said coldly, “Don’t stay here and humiliate yourself! Go back to your hometown and find another school. I don’t want to see you again!”

After saying this, Jenifer went upstairs as well.

“Sis, Sis...”

Jeremy and his wife never thought that they would be kicked out in the end!
