Chapter 1698: How ‘Sweet’ Nox and Shelly Are

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When Bella saw that Nox was injured, she leaned over, looking concerned. “Uncle Nox, does it hurt?”

Nox shook his head. “It doesn’t hurt.”

However, the moment he saw Shelly, he quickly said, “It hurts so much.” “I’ll make it hurt less, okay?” Bella moved closer to Nox’s finger.

Then, she pouted and tried to blow on the cut to help Nox relieve the pain.

Nox really did not like children because he found them troublesome. He was fine with children like George, who could play on his own and take care of himself. However, if the child was like Paige, he would not be able to take it.

Moreover, all little girls seemed the same, and Bella gave him the feeling that she was the kind of girl who was soft and cute and needed to be taken care of. Since he was not patient, to begin with, he did not like to interact with children. Yet now, seeing Bella… made him think that he wanted a daughter.

“Bella, make way for me.” Shelly walked out with the first aid kit. Bella hurriedly stepped aside, still looking at Nox with concern.

“I’ll help you disinfect it and bandage it,” Shelly said.

“Alright.” Nox nodded.

Shelly cleaned the wound and stopped the bleeding first.

Nox frowned. “Be gentle.”

Shelly’s movements immediately became gentler. She also leaned over and blew on Nox’s finger, seemingly relieving his pain. Nox, on the other hand, stared at Shelly’s serious expression the entire time and could feel his heart melting.

Was that what it felt like to like someone? Would he feel happy whenever he saw her, and would her words fill his heart with warmth?

At that moment, he could not help but smile and say, “Shelly, why don’t we get married

Shelly’s hand, which was cleaning Nox’s finger, paused.

Without looking up, she said, “I don’t want to get married so soon.”

“Why?” Nox was a little displeased. “I don’t think I’m not old enough to get married.”

“How old are you again?” Nox asked.

He could not remember how old Shelly was, but in his memory, she should not be too young. Besides, the child was old enough now.

“21,” Shelly replied.

“You’re only 21 years old?” Nox was obviously shocked.

He thought that Shelly was at least 25 or 26 years old. Now that he thought about it more carefully, she did seem to have just taken the college entrance examination, and the child gave him the illusion that she was not young anymore.

“Yes.” Shelly nodded.

They had grown up together, but Nox did not remember her age.

“21 years old is indeed quite young,” Nox muttered.

However, he was already 30 years old; he was not young anymore.

“How old do you want to get married?” Nox asked. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jeanne said that he had to respect Shelly, so he could not force it on her.

“25 or 26 years old,” Shelly answered perfunctorily.

“I’ll be 34 or 35 by then!” Nox almost collapsed.

That was the first time he could not accept getting married and having a child of his own at such an old age. He even wanted to have a daughter with Shelly right now, or a son was fine too. He was fine with anything.

Shelly, however, chose to remain silent and would not relent. After all, Nox was probably just fooling around with her, and if they got married soon, getting a divorce later would be troublesome. If it was just a breakup, it would be much easier.

When Nox saw Shelly’s firm attitude, he kept quiet. In fact, not many women would get married at the age of 21, but it was normal for those who were 25 or 26 years old.

He said, “In that case, I’ll wait.”

“Alright,” Shelly replied.

She also secretly heaved a sigh of relief. She was afraid that if Nox forced it on her, she would not be able to accept it.

She carefully bandaged Nox’s wound and said, “I’m going to cook, and you can rest on the sofa. Don’t come in and try to help.”

Nox looked at his fingers and nodded helplessly.

Once Shelly put the first aid kit away, she returned to the kitchen. Just as she was about to turn on the stove, Nox suddenly hugged her from behind, causing her to purse her lips.

Nox said, “If I can’t help you, can I watch you cook?”

“Sure.” Shelly nodded, knowing she could not dissuade Nox otherwise anyway.

Just like that, Nox happily hugged Shelly and watched her cook.

“Aren’t you afraid of oil splattering on you?” Nox asked.

Even he found it a little terrifying, and he had undergone all kinds of cruel training. Yet, when the oil hit his body, it still hurt.

“You’ll get used to it,” Shelly replied faintly. “If you’re scared, you can hide behind me,” Nox said. “Who’s going to cook if I hide behind you?” Shelly asked.

“I’ll do it. You can teach me.”

“Forget it.” Shelly refused.

Nox was no help at all. If he could cut his finger while chopping an eggplant, would he chop off his hand if he were to shred the potatoes?

After grilling the beef, Shelly plated it and was about to serve it on the table when Nox eagerly took it and ran to the dining room. “I’ll do it.”

Shelly stared at Nox’s back and could not describe what she was feeling. She wondered how long Nox’s passion for her would last. Would it be one week, one month, or one year?

She looked away and did not think it would be long before he was bored of her!
