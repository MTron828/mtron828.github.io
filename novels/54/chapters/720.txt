“What do you mean?” Eden’s attention was instantly drawn to Michael.

He thought the man was mighty and could think of many things he could not.

“It’s very simple. Take advantage of your Fourth Uncle’s threat to you this time and compromise. Let your Fourth Uncle and Jeanne think that you’re threatened and don’t dare to fight with them anymore,” Michael explained clearly.

“I don’t think they’ll believe me so easily.”

“They won’t believe you so easily because you didn’t do it right.” Michael’s eyes narrowed. “If you can lower your self-esteem, Jeanne will treat you like Monica treats me. I can control Monica to do anything.”

When it came to Monica, Eden really admired Michael.

Even though Monica was stupid, just how big of a trick did he have to use to make a woman who did not like him sacrifice herself to such an extent?

“Monica isn’t stupid.” Michael seemed to have guessed what Eden was thinking. “Everything she did was because of her trust in me.”

“But Jeanne isn’t so easy to fool.”

“Of course, she’s not so easy to fool now, especially after all that you’ve done,” Michael said straightforwardly.

Eden’s expression was a little ugly.

That meant he had been asking for it — for Jeanne to not trust him.

“But if you compromise, Jeanne and your Fourth Uncle would, at least, be less guarded. Once they’re less guarded, you can do many things in secret. The first thing is... to take down Quinn.”

“How?” Eden was still unwilling to be suppressed just like that.

“It’s very simple.” Michael smiled coldly.

He then told Eden his plan.

After Eden heard it, he was still a little hesitant. “Can it really be done?”

“Absolutely. Anyway, if it doesn’t succeed, Joshua will be the one to take the blame, not you.”

“Okay, I’ll listen to you.” Eden agreed immediately.

With that, the call ended.

Eden calmed himself down a little before he drove the car to Lawrence Enterprise and went straight to the chairman’s office to look for Joshua.

Joshua was still angry at the moment. At the thought of Eden punching him, he would become infuriated.

When he saw Eden’s sudden return, he snapped and directly went forward to punch Eden. However, instead of dodging, Eden forcefully caught it.

After Joshua threw out his punch, he was actually a little scared. What was even more unexpected was that Eden did not react to his punch.

He glared fiercely at Eden, not wanting Eden to discover his fear. He said, “Why did you come back? How do you still have the nerve to come back? From today onward, you’re fired from Lawrence Enterprise. Get lost!”

“I will leave Lawrence Enterprise,” Eden said, his tone much calmer than before.

Joshua frowned. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“But before I leave, there are some things I need to explain to you clearly.”

“What do you want to say?” Joshua looked wary.

Eden went straight to the point. “It’s true. I can’t help you much with Lawrence Enterprise, and it can’t be denied that Jeanne is very capable now. She knows very well that I came with ill intentions, so she’ll give me a hard time, and whatever I do may not have any effect on Jeanne.”

Joshua sneered, “Oh? You suddenly aware of it, huh?”

“That’s why I will leave Lawrence Enterprise, but that doesn’t mean you’ll be able to kick Jeanne out of Lawrence Enterprise either.”

“Are you insulting me?”

“I’m telling you what’s the best way to deal with Jeanne.”

Joshua seemed skeptical of what Eden said.

Eden cut to the chase and said bluntly, “Use Quinn.”

“What did you say?” Joshua was agitated. “Use Quinn? Do you want me to die?”

“I’m helping you.” Eden’s tone sounded serious. “Quinn is the princess of the Sanders, and she’s the only one that Jeanne would not dare to lay a hand on. And if Quinn wants to help you, kicking Jeanne out would be easy.”

“Why should she help me?”

“If you become her man, why shouldn’t she help you?”

“Are you crazy? Quinn has a fiancé, and I know very well how I fair. How can I become her man?”

“Do you know the saying of what’s done cannot be undone?” Eden asked.

“What do you mean?”

“What is the thing that women with status are most afraid of? It’s when her own scandal is exposed.” Eden said, “As long as you think of a way to sleep with Quinn and take nude photos of her at the same time, do you think you can’t threaten her?”
