928 Out of Danger, Cardellini Enterprise’s Emergency

Ruby forced herself to nod. She steadied her body and walked to Gary, who had just come out of the operating room.

Monica, who had been trailing behind her mother, saw her father’s pale face was pale. She looked at him. His eyes closed with no reaction to the outside world. What if he never woke up? Monica’s eyes reddened, and her vision blurred at the thought of it.

They followed the medical staff as they pushed Gary to the ward. Finn looked at their figures and could not help but tighten his hand that had just supported Ruby.

In the ward, the doctors and nurses placed Gary on the bed, where various devices were monitoring Gary’s physical condition.

The doctors, nurses, and even Finn had left. Now, only a few of them remained. Ruby stayed silently by Gary’s side with Monica and Sarah, their eyes red and swollen. Gary’s assistant did not leave either. He was also waiting anxiously.

“Mom, talk to dad. Tell him not to sleep.” Monica could not help but say. Finn had told them to try and wake her father up, and he had to awaken today.

Ruby nodded. She suppressed the pain in her heart and said, “Dear, wake up.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Gary did not react at all.

“If you don’t wake up, what will happen to me, Monica, and our family? We can’t live without you.” Ruby’s tears fell once more. She did not dare to get too excited. However, she could not control the sadness in her heart.

“Dear, I’ve been married to you for twenty-eight years. When we got married, you said that you would take care of me for the rest of my life. Now, my life hasn’t ended yet. How could you… How could you go back on your word? How could you just collapse like that…?”

Monica felt that perhaps they should not be in the room while her mother was this way. So she said to Sarah and the assistant, “Let’s head out first.”

The three of them left the room and waited outside.

“Cousin, I’m really worried about uncle. Auntie loves him so much. If uncle...” Sarah’s tears fell.

Monica knew. She was also very afraid. She was afraid her father would succumb to his illness and her mother would not be able to support herself.

No. Her father would wake up.

The assistant, Mr. Warren, suddenly sighed. Monica and Sarah both looked at him.

He looked back at them and said helplessly, “If it weren’t for the incident today, the chairman would never have had a heart attack and a stroke!”

“What happened?” Monica asked. Only then did she find out why her father had a heart attack.

“This morning, the chairman was in a high-level meeting introducing our new product to the market. He was discussing which hospitals should pilot it for free when the door of the meeting room suddenly pushed open. An employee came with the bad news that a batch of children’s vaccines we produced had problems and had already killed a child. When the chairman heard the news, he didn’t have time to instruct how to deal with it before he collapsed.” Mr. Warren recalled the situation of her father fainting in the morning and felt a little uncomfortable.

“How could there be a problem? Hasn’t our medicine always been safe? It goes through multiple tests before trial, and the production process is strictly followed. In terms of quality inspection, my dad has always been very strict. So how could there be a problem with the vaccine?!” Monica could not believe that such a medical mishap would happen in Cardellini Medical Technology.

She had worked at the company with her father before and observed the production process of medications. The production was so harsh that such an accident could not have happened.

“Yeah. We also thought it strange. Our drug production is famous for being standardized, so it’s impossible for there to be a problem with the vaccine! Though now, there’s an accident.” Mr. Warren seemed helpless and a little out of his wits.

“Could it be a normal rejection phenomenon? Some children have a certain probability of rejection towards vaccines,” Monica asked.

“I’m not sure about the exact situation yet, as I sent the chairman directly to the hospital,” Steve replied.

“There shouldn’t be a problem with our vaccine.” Monica was certain her father would never cut corners in the production of the drugs. “Though, my father is not someone who has never seen the world. Why would he have a heart attack because of such an incident?”
