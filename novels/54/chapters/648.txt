Her tears had probably dried up from all her crying recently.

She did not know when she fell asleep.

During the night, she picked up the phone several times and tried to call Finn with tears in her eyes, but she forced herself to put it down.

She repeated that over and over again until she finally fell asleep.

Then, she woke up hungry because she did not have dinner last night. Her heart was in so much pain that she could not bring herself to eat anything.

When she returned home, she would not stop crying. It was like she was going crazy.

Toward the end, she felt miserable, like the whole world had abandoned her.

She got up from the bed.

“Sob...” Monica could not help but cry out.

Yesterday, she fell on her butt, and at that time, she did not feel much pain because her heart was probably focused on Finn. However, when she woke up today, she saw her knees were injured, and there was a layer of scab that hurt whenever she moved. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She also did not know why she kept getting injured recently.

Ever since she participated in George’s sports day, her body had not felt any better.

She forced herself to endure for a while before using her crutches to go to the bathroom.

She did not know if her ankle was okay after running yesterday.

After using the toilet, she washed her face and brushed her teeth.

At the same time, her phone in the bedroom was ringing.

After Monica finished washing up, she went back to the bedroom and grabbed the phone. “Jeannie, I’m flattered that you’re calling me so early in the morning.”

Jeanne paused for a moment.

Compared to how Monica treated her, was she not a little too cold toward Monica?

When she had nothing to do, it was difficult for her to take the initiative to look for Monica.

That was because she always felt that she had a lot of things to do this time she was back, and she could not waste too much time on other things. As such, she seemed to have neglected Monica a lot, even though Monica was her best friend.

She said, “You, Michael, and Dr. Jones have been trending.”

“What?” Monica screamed in disbelief and was about to explode.

“Did Dr. Jones beat up Michael yesterday?” Jeanne asked.

“How do you know?” Monica could not hold herself together anymore.

By then, she had put Jeanne on speaker and was flipping through the news.

Jeanne said, “I said you guys have been trending. It’s about Finn beating up Michael.”

Monica saw the news.

The headline was “Finn Couldn’t Take It Anymore. He Finally Exploded and Took Revenge On Michael”!

Monica was fuming and speechless upon seeing such a headline.

“Monica?” Jeanne called out to her.

“It’s not true! The media is writing nonsense.” Monica snapped back to her senses and broke down.

“I know.” Jeanne knew full well it was not true.

Although she was not close to Finn, she knew what kind of person he was.

She said, “The media has exposed it, so even if it’s not true, everyone thinks it is.”

“I want to go to the media to clarify this and tell them it isn’t true!” Monica appeared very agitated.

“Calm down first. What’s the point of you going to clarify now?” Jeanne was speechless. She was also a little worried about the panic-stricken state Monica was currently in. “If you clarify to them now, how do you think the media will view the relationship between the three of you? No matter what, in the eyes of outsiders, you and Michael are a couple, and Dr. Jones has nothing to do with you anymore. If you protect Dr. Jones at all costs, you’re going to make it worse!”

“Then what should we do? Just let the news brew and have everyone misunderstand Finn? No!” Monica’s eyes reddened again. “Finn is already very hurt by the matter between Michael and me. I can’t let him continue to be hurt.”

“Now that you know Dr. Jones is deeply hurt, why didn’t you think about what kind of trouble you would bring him after leaving him?”

“I… I…” Monica bit her lips, not knowing how to explain herself.

“Do you know, Monica, that once you choose to be with Michael, the whole world will tie you and Michael together? As long as there is any conflict between the three of you, the person who will be slandered will be Dr. Jones.” Jeanne made it very clear.

Tears kept rolling in Monica’s eyes.

She did not think so far at that time. She just thought she could help Michael.
