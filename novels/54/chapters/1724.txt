“I refuse to push!” Monica refused.

She was in so much pain, whereas those people were all standing there, so it was easy for them to say!

“Finn, arrange a C-section for me immediately. I want a C-section immediately! Don’t stop me!” Monica resisted.

Instead of using all her strength to push, it was all spent on quarreling.

The midwife shook her head at Finn. It meant that with the effort Monica was putting in, she would not be able to give birth to the children in time.

Finn turned to look at Monica, whose face was red as she said, “Ahhhh! Finn, hurry up and give me a C-section. I can’t hold on any longer-”

“Even if you can’t, you have to persevere.” Finn’s voice suddenly became stern.

Monica was stunned. She looked straight at Finn and wondered how someone so gentle just a moment ago could suddenly turn heartless.

“Every woman has to go into labor, not just you. When Jeanne was in labor, it took her all day and a night to give birth to Paige, but look at you! You’re less than two hours in, and you’re screaming the place down. Can’t you be a little braver?”

“Finn, how dare you yell at me!” Monica looked at him with a face full of grievance, and tears were about to stream down her face.

What right did Finn have to scold her when she had worked so hard and painfully to give birth to his children?

“Hurry up and give birth to the babies! I won’t let you have a C-section!”

“Finn!” Monica was fuming. “How can you do this? Y-Y-You… If you hadn’t gotten me pregnant back then, would I be suffering now? How could you stand at the side and make such nasty remarks?”

Finn was indeed a little embarrassed.

Meanwhile, the doctors and nurses at the side listened and tried to hold back their laughter. Then, they put on a serious face and pretended they did not hear it.

“How could you mock me at a time like that? Finn, do you have a conscience? Besides, Jeanne only had to give birth to one at a time, while I have to give birth to two at once! What gives you the right to do this to me? My stomach is as big as a ball now, and I don’t know if I’ll have to live with this ball after giving birth. You’ve ruined my figure… Ahh!”

Monica cursed in pain. If she could get up now, she would fight Finn to the death.

“Mrs. Jones, if you put all your effort into pushing, you’ll be able to do it. Look, you were dilated six centimeters just now, but now it’s seven. Soon, you’ll be able to meet your babies!”

“I don’t want to meet my babies!” Monica screamed. “I don’t want to give birth to this sc*mbag’s children!”

Everyone was speechless when they heard Monica call Dr. Jones, their hospital’s Prince Charming who had resigned and was irreplaceable, a sc*mbag!

“I don’t want to do this anymore! Even if it means I have to die, I won’t do it! I want to go back!” Monica cried out in despair.

“Do you think it will stop hurting if we go back?” Finn asked, “If we do go back, I’ll be the only one delivering the baby, and didn’t you refuse to let me deliver the babies? If you don’t take this seriously, I’ll deliver the babies…”

“No!” Monica shouted. “I’d rather kill myself than have you deliver my babies.”

“Actually, Dr. Jones can deliver your babies.” The midwife said, “There’s a superstition in the Obstetrics Department that the father of the child can quicken the delivery of the child because of a tacit understanding between the

child and the father. Since you’re in so much pain, why don’t you give it a try?”

“No!” Monica shouted frantically.

“Why? Give it a try, Mrs. Jones?”

“No! I heard that if a husband helps with his wife’s delivery, the husband will become impotent. I can’t let these two smelly brats ruin my s*x life!” Monica said righteously.

The doctors and nurses could not help but laugh. If Monica could consider all that at a time like this, it did not seem like she was in too much pain.

“Don’t you hate me? Why are you still thinking about s*x?” Finn’s voice was much gentler as he approached Monica.

“Hmph!” Monica ignored Finn.

Even if he tried to please her, she would never forgive him.

“Be good and put more effort into pushing. I’ll make sure to take good care of you in the future.” There was a hint of seduction in Finn’s deep voice.

All the doctors and nurses in the room shuddered when they heard him. It made them wonder who commented that Dr. Jones was aloof when he was so affectionate to Mrs. Jones..
