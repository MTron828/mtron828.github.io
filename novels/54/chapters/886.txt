887 While the Wedding Was Going On

Every time Monica thought of Finn, her heart would still ache.

…

The next day, the sky was slightly bright.

Monica had been woken up by the staff to do her makeup.

She estimated that she had only slept for an hour.

Perhaps it was less than an hour.

When the makeup artist saw Monica’s swollen eyes, she could not help but exclaim, “Miss Cardellini, your eyes are too swollen. Did you… Cry last night?”

Even if she only drank water, her eyes would not be so swollen.

Monica ignored the makeup artist.

If she remained cool, they could still get along happily.

The makeup artist could sense Monica’s emotions and did not dare to offend her. She quickly said, “I’ll give you a cold compress. Let’s help you change into your wedding dress and do your hair first.”

Monica nodded slightly.

She leaned back comfortably in her chair after changing her clothes. There was something cold over her eyes. She was thinking that the bridesmaids had not arrived yet.

Was there… A delay?!

Monica told herself not to show any emotion. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Everything she did was just self-defense. There was no need to feel guilty.

The bride’s makeup was complicated, especially Monica’s swollen eyes. The makeup artist took a long time to cover them up. Fortunately, her skills were not bad. After putting on makeup, it was almost impossible to see the abnormality in Monica’s eyes. After she was done, Brie arrived at her villa and said apologetically, “I’m sorry. I was drunk last night and woke up late. I’ll change my clothes immediately.”

“It’s fine. It’s still early.” Monica glanced at Brie.

No emotion could be seen on Brie’s face.

Last night, when Brie slept with Michael, she was clearly not like this…

No wonder Michael valued her so much.

As expected, the two of them knew how to disguise themselves.

It was impossible to see through their emotions.

Brie quickly changed into her bridesmaid outfit. She hurriedly put on makeup and did her hair.

Monica saw some hickeys on Brie’s breasts. Brie had asked the makeup artist to help her with them.

Brie felt Monica’s gaze on her.

She quickly said, “I’m sorry. My boyfriend was here last night. They’ll be dealt with.”

“Really?” Monica smiled. “I didn’t even know you had a boyfriend, Miss Larson.”

“We’re usually too busy with work, so we don’t have much time together.” Brie played dumb.

Monica did not ask further.

Brie finished dressing up very quickly.

It was about time.

According to the wedding process, Michael should be here in half an hour.

At this moment, many relatives had also come to the Cardellinis’ villa.

The villa looked very lively.

“Cousin.” Sarah ran into Monica’s room. She was wearing a pink gown today. It was obvious that she had dressed up meticulously. She looked very lively. “You’re too beautiful.”

Monica’s attitude toward Sarah…

Forget it.

They were all relatives.

Even though Monica did not like Sarah, it was not to the point where she wanted to cut off all ties with her.

“Has your leg recovered?” Monica asked.

“Yeah, in order to attend your wedding, I specially removed all the stents. The doctor also said that as long as it’s not too strenuous, there’s basically no problem,” Sarah replied, looking happy.

Monica reckoned that after she got married, Sarah would be able to chase after Finn even more freely.

‘Finn…’

Monica’s heart ached.

She did not want to think too much about it.

At this moment, Monica was sitting on the bed, waiting for Michael to pick her up.

She used her phone beside her to pass the time.

Sarah was used to her cousin’s coldness toward her. She sat beside Monica and played with her phone.

Monica randomly clicked on a news app and saw the most eye-catching article. It was about her and Michael’s wedding.

She had not planned to open it.

She only clicked on it after seeing Reese’s photo.

It was an interview video.

Reese was wearing a wine-red cheongsam, and her hair was tied into a bun. She looked dignified and elegant, and her makeup was slightly festive. It was obvious that there was a happy event in the family.

“Thank you for your concern about my son’s wedding. Michael is too busy today to thank you in person, so I can only attend on his behalf,” Reese said enthusiastically.

Upon closer inspection, the interview had probably taken place at the entrance of the Ross residence.

“Today’s wedding won’t be open to the public. Dear friends from the media, you don’t have to wait outside the wedding. After the wedding, we’ll send some photos and videos of the wedding venue to everyone. Please cooperate. Thank you,” Reese explained the wedding arrangements.
