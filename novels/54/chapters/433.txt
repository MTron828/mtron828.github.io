Chapter 434: The Swan Enterprise’s Senior Management Meeting, Confronting Eden Swan

They remained glued to one another in the ward.

No one knew how long it had been before they separated.

After they separated, Monica kept looking at Finn. She gazed at him for a long time.

Finn was speechless at Monica’s gaze.

“Monica, stop looking,” Finn said to her.

“Call me ‘Moni’.” Monica still looked at him in earnest.

“...” Finn pursed his lips.

“Scrape that. We are husband and wife. Call me wife.” Monica looked serious.

Finn ignored Monica.

It was difficult for him to call her that, at least for now.

He didn’t know how Monica could be so... open.

“Hubby,” Monica suddenly said.

Finn’s heart skipped a beat.

......

His lips, which were slightly swollen after the passionate kiss, were now curved in a beautiful manner.

Monica smiled.

Looking at Finn’s expression, she said, “Do you want me to call you that?”

Finn glanced at Monica and said, “No.”

“Your expression betrays you.”

“Hubby,” Monica called out to him again.

Finn didn’t respond.

“Hubby,” Monica called out to him again.

He was overjoyed to hear that.

“You look so handsome when you smile,” Monica said sincerely.

Finn really couldn’t handle Monica.

He said, “I need to go to the toilet.”

“Oh, let me help you.” Monica quickly got up and wanted to help him get off the bed.

“It’s fine. Get the nurse to come.” Finn’s tone was determined this time. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“No!” Monica refused immediately.

“Monica Cardellini.”

“No.”

“Monica.”

“No.”

“Honey,” Finn suddenly said.

“Okay.” Monica agreed immediately.

“But I have one condition.”

Finn frowned.

Monica said, “The nurse can’t watch you pee.”

‘...Monica Cardellini, what’s in your head?’ Finn thought and rolled his eyes at Monica.

“If you say yes, I won’t agree.” Monica was very determined.

Except for her, no one else should ever see Finn’s body.

She hasn’t even looked at his naked body, so how could she let another woman see that?

“The nurse won’t look! “Finn said.

“Alright then.” Monica said happily. She held her crutch and called for the nurse to come in.

The real reason why Finn didn’t let Monica help was as her leg hadn’t recovered, and neither of them could afford to fall.

After using the washroom, Finn came out.

“Hubby,” Monica called out to him again.

She said it naturally.

“Yes?” Finn responded.

Monica said, “I want to move in and stay with you.”

Finn looked at her.

“I want to be in the same ward as you,” Monica said.

“We can’t. We’re not under the same department.” Finn lied. There’s no such rule at the hospital.

“I don’t care. I want to be here with you.”

“Monica...”

“I want to sleep in the same bed as you.” Monica continued.

“Be good now.” Finn said.

“I won’t.”

“Wife.”

“It’s useless to convince me.” Monica said with determination. “I’ll stay with you at all times!”

Finn was really helpless against Monica.

Monica said, “I’ll stick with you until I’ve savored every last bit of you.”

Finn was left speechless.

With that, Monica transferred to stay in the same ward as Finn and they even slept on the same bed.

The news spread quickly in the hospital.

It was said that for the first time, Dr. Jones used his privilege in the hospital and personally appealed to the hospital director to stay in the same ward as his wife.

Dr. Jones, who had always been a serious person, ended up just like the rumors. He was deeply in love with Mrs. Jones.

...

Jeanne was sitting in her office at the Lawrence Enterprise. She looked at the message sent by Edward.

“Tomorrow, the Swan Enterprise’s senior management meeting will be at 10 sharp.”

Edward was much more efficient than she had expected.

In just half an hour, he had given her a clear reply.

She sent a message to George.

At that very moment, George had just finished a class. When he saw his mother’s message, he called her.

“I was just done with a class.”

“Take the afternoon off from the teacher. I need you back to help me with something.”

George frowned. “I’ve been skipping classes often.”

“...”

“But yesterday’s quiz result came out today. I’m number one in the entire school.”

‘Was he showing off?’ Jeanne thought and congratulated him. “That’s great, George!”

George didn’t really care about the result though. He said, “Are you in a hurry?”

“Yeah, it’s urgent.” That was because the meeting was scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow.

And the reason she was in such a hurry was because the project couldn’t be delayed.
