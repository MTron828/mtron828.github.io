Chapter 76: Eden’s Viciousness

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Everyone left the high-level meeting room.

Jeanne went to Alexander’s office and knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

Jeanne pushed the door open and entered. “Dad, I have something to discuss with you.”

Alexander was in a good mood.

In many meetings, although he held the highest position, he was always suppressed. Today was a rare occasion where he was so carefree. Seeing Winston, that self-righteous person, constantly being defeated made him feel good.

He nodded slightly. “Have a seat.”

Jeanne sat down obediently in front of Alexander.

Alexander still showed his sternness. He said, “In the company, you have to have rules. In the future, you can’t be so unreasonable and not respect the higher-ups.”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded obediently and did not refute.

Alexander was still very proud.

Jeanne said, “Dad, I hope that you can take on the position of marketing director.”

Alexander raised his eyebrow and seemed a little unwilling.

“There are three reasons. Firstly, the position of marketing director is currently vacant. It’s impossible to leave it there. The marketing department must have a leader, but you’re the only one suitable for the position. Everyone knows about the bet I made with the higher-ups. Once I win, whoever takes on the position will leave in an awkward position. Only you can happily retreat. Secondly, even though you agreed to give me a team, I still need to rely on the marketing department for a lot of things. If it were someone else, it would be inevitable that there’ll be conflicts of authority. When that happens, due to these unnecessary small things, everyone will be unhappy, and the losses will outweigh the gains. Thirdly, as the highest leader of the company, if you take over as the director of the marketing department, I feel that you’ll become the role model for the Lawrence Enterprise,” Jeanne said clearly. She did not give the other party any reason to reject her.

Alexander looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne’s words had moved him indeed.

Alexander knew very well that his abilities in the business world were not enough. Over the years, he had made many big decisions but with the help of his father. At this moment, when he was being encouraged by Jeanne, it gave him the idea of wanting to perform well in the company and even make people look at him in a new light.

He said calmly without batting an eyelid, “You were appointed by your grandfather to the company. I can’t go against his wishes, and I also hope that you can make a difference in the company. Since you just entered the company, you’ll need me to go to the marketing department to help you, so I’ll agree to it.”

“Thank you, Dad.” Jeanne looked very excited.

No matter what, if Alexander was the director of the marketing department, she would not have to worry about other people with intentions making things difficult for her.

“Don’t be happy too early. If you can’t keep your promises, you’ll have to leave. I won’t plead on your behalf.”

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

“Go and work hard,” Alexander ordered her to leave.

Jeanne left respectfully.

She walked into the elevator and returned to her floor.

Jeanne’s phone rang at this time.

She looked at the incoming call and picked it up. “Monica.”

“What are you doing?” Monica’s lazy voice was heard coming from the other side.

“I’m working,” Jeanne answered and added, “At the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“You really went?” Monica was a little doubtful.

“Or else?” Jeanne just had a huge battle before this!

“Why do you always fight with the Lawrences? What is it about them that makes them worthy of your attention?” Monica was very unhappy.

“I’m paying attention to them to take back what belongs to me,” Jeanne said coldly.

“What?” Monica did not hear her clearly.

“Why are you looking for me?” Jeanne directly changed the topic.

“I just want to ask how you’re doing today. When you were drunk last night, did you do something with Fourth Master…?” Monica had a gossipy look on her face.

Jeanne was speechless. “Stop thinking about it. Nothing happened.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Really?” Monica did not believe her. “Fourth Master Swan isn’t the kind of person who won’t do anything.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

‘Indeed, he’s not.’

“Are you hiding something from me?” Monica sensed Jeanne’s silence and quickly asked.

“No, I just don’t have anything to say.” Jeanne seemed to be a little impatient. “I’m going to work, bye.”

“Hey!” Monica shouted.

Jeanne had hung up the phone.

She got out of the elevator and returned to her office.

In any case, there was no one sitting in the director’s office. Alexander would not come here. Hence, for the time being, she had not thought of changing offices.

Joshua’s office was next to hers.

Joshua came back earlier than Jeanne. At this moment, he closed the door and was making a call. “Eden, Jeanne went on a killing spree at the general manager’s meeting today. Several high-level leaders were rendered speechless by her words.”

“Is that so?” Eden held the phone, and his face was a little gloomy. “In that case, Jeanne is indeed more powerful than we thought.”

“In any case, I don’t think she’s a rookie.”

“So what do you want me to do for you?” Eden asked.

It was clear that he had asked Joshua to monitor Jeanne’s every move and report to him. Now, it was Joshua who did not want Jeanne to have a good time.

Joshua naturally did not think too much and quickly said, “Of course, I don’t want her to stay in the Lawrence Enterprise. This is mine to begin with. If she’s here, wouldn’t she be fighting with me on purpose?”

“So you want to get rid of Jeanne?”

“I want to get rid of Jeanne. Looking at her awe-inspiring manner in the meeting today, I even felt that my father was looking at her in a different light. Eden, you must help me. I can’t let Jeanne steal my things. Besides, if she really takes over the Lawrence Enterprise, not to mention me, my sister won’t be able to get any benefits from the Lawrences. Naturally, you won’t be able to get any either.”

“I don’t think much of the Lawrences’ small favors,” Eden said with some sarcasm.

Joshua suddenly felt a little embarrassed.

“Well, I’m with your sister, and your sister doesn’t get along with Jeanne. I can’t let Jeanne continue to strut around like this. If she’s bullying you, she’s bullying your sister. She should be taught a lesson.”

“So what should I do? Right now, I feel that both my grandfather and father are on her side. If she achieves results, I’m afraid that the consequences will be unbearable.” The more Joshua spoke, the more worried he became.

“Then don’t let her achieve anything,” Eden enunciated each word clearly and continued, “You just told me that Jeanne promised to win the cooperation rights of the MUK Group at the meeting, right?”

“Yes, she said that she’ll do it within a month, or she’ll take the blame and resign.”

“Isn’t that easy to handle? As long as she doesn’t win the cooperation rights, it’s fine.”

“But I feel that she has a plan in mind...”

“Do as I say. First of all, the Lawrence Enterprise is currently lacking a marketing director. The position of this director can only be taken by someone you trust, or you can take the initiative to volunteer for the position. No matter what, Jeanne’s project team will require the support of the marketing department in many areas. Once you take control of the marketing department, Jeanne won’t be able to develop.”

Joshua was stunned. How could he not have thought of this?!
