The person on the other end of the call also admired Michael’s calmness. The fact that Michael could achieve that at such a young age impressed him and gave him high expectations of Michael.

He said, “Take back the management rights of Cardellini Enterprise and place it under the Sanders’ control.”

Michael was stunned.

He did not expect the president would ask him to make a move on the Cardellinis so soon.

He tried his best to appear normal and said, “Monica and I aren’t in a stable relationship yet. We haven’t even received the approval of her parents yet.”

“I believe you can. I’ll give you three months, which is more than enough time.”

Michael kept silent for a few seconds.

“What? Is there a problem?” The president sounded a little displeased.

“No, I was just thinking whether there is a better way to obtain Cardellini Enterprise’s management rights. Should we take Cardellini Enterprise back into our control, or should we quickly reinstate one of Cardellini Enterprise’s pharmaceutical companies and replace Cardellini Enterprise?”

The president seemed surprised by Michael’s reaction.

Michael said, “As to taking control of Cardellini Enterprise, I personally think it’s a little inhumane. Once people find out that the government is interfering with Cardellini Enterprise, it will be a huge problem for your reputation. However, according to commercial competition, if another pharmaceutical company seized all of Cardellini Enterprise’s markets, the final result would be the same. We can even avoid suspicion, and it won’t ruin our reputation.”

“You are indeed much smarter than I thought. I support your idea, but there’s something I have to remind you.” The leader approved of Michael’s idea. “The reason why Cardellini Enterprise can continue to develop is that they have a professional pharmaceutical research team. Moreover, many of Cardellini Enterprise’s medicines have been patented. The formulas are highly confidential and have never been leaked. Many pharmaceutical research institutions and even official pharmaceutical teams will follow the trend and conduct research and development when Cardellini Enterprise comes out with new products. If the results are not satisfactory, not only can they not put their price as low as Cardellini Enterprise’s, but the medicinal properties also differ significantly.”

“Yes, I heard about that.” Michael nodded.

“If you want another pharmaceutical company to replace Cardellini Enterprise, you have to first ensure that everyone in Cardellini Enterprise’s research and development team is willing to work for you. I can tell you that those people are very loyal to Cardellini Enterprise because Cardellini Enterprise treats them well!”

Michael hummed in reply.

“Cardellini Enterprise has practically monopolized Harken’s civilian drug market for the past few years, so it won’t be an easy task to get the other drug factories to stop working with Cardellini Enterprise. You’d better be prepared.” After that, the president decided to keep quiet.

“I’ve thought of what to do.” Michael was confident.

The president smiled. “You really do surprise me.”

“Thank you, President.”

“After you take down Cardellini Enterprise, I will use a reasonable excuse to put you back in the most important position by my side. Then, I will announce the news of your father’s death to the public so that he can rest in peace.”

“I definitely won’t let you down.”

After that, the president hung up the call.

Michael also silently put down his phone, and his expression was a little ugly.

One of the reasons he and Monica got back together was to obtain Cardellini Enterprise. However, he did not expect the president would be so anxious to give him such an arduous task when he was still trying to hold his ground. His father had just passed away, and his family was still in turmoil, yet he was not even given a chance to catch his breath.

He gritted his teeth and calmed himself down.

Replacing Cardellini Enterprise with other companies was the best way for him to get back together with Monica.

As long as Monica did not know that he was the trader of the other company, he could continue to be with Monica!

In any case, it was much safer than him personally purchasing Cardellini Enterprise.

After all, he would not want to give up on love while securing his career.

…

In the marketing director’s office in Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne was busy, but she still saw the news about Monica and Michael that was trending.

Michael successfully got the position of the quality inspection department’s director, but that was not the focus of the news. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The main focus was that Michael and Monica were hugging each other at the scene.

Monica had even kissed Michael.

Jeanne felt a little upset when she saw the news, let alone Finn.

With that, Monica’s thought of returning after Michael was done sorting out his career would be gone.

She frowned.
