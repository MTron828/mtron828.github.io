Chapter 444: Humiliating Eden In Public

Jeanne’s expression turned cold.

“Because of your unhappiness with Eden back, you’re deliberately trying to take revenge against Eden now–”

“Director Henry, Eden didn’t abandon me back then,” Jeanne reminded him.

This time, Henry’s expression darkened.

“Back then, when Eden cheated on me, I was the one who broke up with him. As Eden’s father, you should be very clear about all of it, and now you’re trying to slander me? Are you deliberately trying to smear my name? Can I also suspect that because of my current identity, you father and son are jealous–”

“Jeanne!” Henry was really angered.

He slammed his hands on the conference table in front of him fiercely.

“In the company, I think it’s better for you to call me Director Lawrence, Director Henry,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Henry was so angry that his body was trembling.

However, Jeanne did not care at all. She did not even look at Henry as she turned to look at the others and said, “I have to say that the conversation with Director Henry just now did delay all of your time, and I apologize to everyone here.”

The underlying meaning was that Henry had said a lot of nonsense today.

Henry suppressed his anger.

Elaine tugged at his big brother’s clothes and gestured for him to sit down.

......

After all, Edward had been indulging Jeanne all along, and now that Edward was in charge of the entire Swan Enterprise, they could not win against her.

With that, Henry sat down in anger.

“Before I bring out the evidence, I will first state that I’m not here today to flaunt my identity. I am not that childish. I’m here because I’m now a member of the Swans, and I have the responsibility and obligation to expose the financial losses to Swan Enterprise. Then, I will try my best to stop the losses.”

No one said anything else.

After all, if it was useless for Henry to make a fuss, let alone the others.

“President, can I borrow your projection?”

“Madam, please.” Edward gave a look to the staff member, who went forward respectfully.

Jeanne gave a few simple instructions and passed the USB to the staff member.

At the same time, a huge projector wined down from above. On the projector, the internal loan information of Swanhaven Bank appeared.

Eden’s expression immediately changed.

How did Jeanne get her hands on Swanhaven Bank’s loan information?

He looked at her without batting an eyelid. Then, he started getting a little nervous.

Although he had already rearranged it, if things really got to a point where he had to hand over the loan information, handing it over voluntarily and passively were two completely different things. He did not even know how Jeanne got it!

He looked coldly at the data on the screen.

“Excuse me, but where is the 264 million?” Henry was deliberately mocking her.

Jeanne glanced at Henry as if she could not be bothered with him anymore.

She turned her head to the screen and used a pointer to point at the data on the screen. She said, “Here, here, here, here, here, and finally here!”

She marked a few places on the screen. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Jeanne said, “It adds up to exactly 270 million.”

At that moment, Eden’s face sank.

He had indeed split up that sum of money into a few batches and made a non-reimbursable loan.

He looked at Jeanne in disbelief.

“I’ve checked. These six sums of money were transferred to six different charity undertakings, and then, they all ended up in one place.” Jeanne looked up and said, “In the public accounts of the Minze District’s Chamber of Commerce.”

As Eden’s face tensed, his body also tensed unconsciously.

He looked coldly at Jeanne. At that moment, she looked so nonchalant, as if she was waiting for him to make a fool of himself.

Jeanne said, “The six charity organizations all have a deep relationship with Swanhaven Bank. I’ve looked into it and verified the fact that Swan Enterprise has never concealed the fact that we do charity. I have to say, Swan Enterprise really has done a lot of charity in the past few years. We’ve invested in many charity projects and donated a lot of money. 80 percent of the charity organizations in Harken have a relationship with the Swans. With that relationship, Eden, as the general manager of Swanhaven Bank, is responsible for all the loans of the Swanhaven Bank, including the charity funding, so it’s natural for him to have a good relationship with these merchants. Therefore, it’s a piece of cake for Eden to find a few charity organizations to transfer the funds.”

“How can you say that I was the one who transferred the funds?” Eden stood up and looked at Jeanne. “Swan Enterprise is to do charity with these charity organizations, so it’s normal for me to donate money to them. If you look at more than just the data, you will realize that when these charity organizations needed funds, the Swan Enterprise will always allocate them some. This is a very common donation project, and the amount doesn’t exceed 50 million. Since it’s a long-term charity project, there’s no problem for me to approve the funds!”
