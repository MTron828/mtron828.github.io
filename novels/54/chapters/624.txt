Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Now that Eden had shown his utmost sincerity, there was no reason for her to refuse.

She said, “No matter what, I married my daughter to you. Whether there is any conflict between the two of you, we’re all family, so I trust you.”

“Yes.” Eden appeared to be very respectful.

“We must never let Jeanne succeed!” Jenifer said fiercely.

“Of course,” Eden said in a bloodthirsty way.

Those few people were discussing how to make Jeanne lose everything, and the person involved, Jeanne, had no interest in their schemes and tricks.

After all, even if she wanted to defend herself against them harming her, she could not do so with those people.

Since they were coming at her, she might as well take things as they came. She would wait for them to seek their own death!

She looked out of the window.

By then, Finn’s car had entered the city.

Jeanne said, “Send me to the police station. It’s time to deal with Alexander’s matter.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Okay,” Finn replied.

The car was quiet for most of the journey.

Jeanne looked away and leaned against the back seat of the car. Then, she said casually, “Have you contacted Edward?”

Finn tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

He said, “Occasionally.”

“When will he be back?”

“Probably in a few days or a few more days after that.” Finn did not lie to Jeanne.

It was indeed around that time, and there was no specific answer.

“Did something happen?” Jeanne’s tone was calm.

It was hard to tell from her tone whether she was concerned about Edward.

Finn nodded. “Something happened.”

“Is it dangerous?”

“It’s dangerous.”

Jeanne’s expression visibly shifted.

Finn turned to look at her and said, “But he should be back alive.”

Jeanne smiled at the word ‘should’. How should she interpret that word?

Edward did not mention anything to her. She even had to find out about his safety from someone else.

Jeanne did not say anything more, and neither did Finn.

Silence filled the car again until they arrived at the police station.

Jeanne went to look for the police officer who handled Alexander’s case. After that, she sat in the interrogation room and answered the police officer’s questions.

“Where did the video come from?” the police officer asked.

“I installed the surveillance camera.”

“Why did you install the camera in advance? Did you know Alexander had the intention to murder Jonathan?”

“My grandfather told me to install it. I didn’t realize it, but my grandfather did. He was afraid he would die in vain, so he told me to install the surveillance camera in secret for him. I didn’t think it would be useful, but the accident was so sudden that I went to check out the video recording and discovered my father’s criminal doing,” Jeanne said the statement that she had prepared earlier.

The police noted her statement before asking again, “Since your grandfather already reminded you to install the camera, didn’t you think of taking precautions against your father?”

“Who would suspect that their father would do such a thing?” Jeanne said bluntly. “It didn’t even cross my mind.”

The police thought about it and was somewhat convinced by Jeanne.

He continued to ask, “How is the relationship between Jonathan and his personal caregiver?”

“Are you suspecting that the personal caregiver is an accomplice?” Jeanne immediately understood.

“We speculate there is such a possibility. Usually, Jonathan’s personal caregiver takes care of him. But that night, Jonathan was wheeled out by Alexander, but the personal caregiver didn’t even notice it. It doesn’t make sense.”

“I don’t think so.” Jeanne gave her opinion. “The personal caregiver and my grandfather have been together for many years. My grandfather trusts him a lot and treats him well. Moreover, with my grandfather’s power, it would not be easy to bribe the people around him. So, I suspect the personal nurse might have been put on sleeping pills or something similar. When something happened to my grandfather, the personal nurse said he was so sleepy that he fell asleep as soon as he lay on the bed.”

“So you think Alexander might’ve drugged him with sleeping pills,” the police officer repeated her statement to confirm it.

“You can investigate it.”

The police officer nodded. “That’s all the questions we have for you for now, but you might need to come to the police station again in the future, Ms. Lawrence. Please don’t leave South Harken City for the time being until Alexander’s case has been concluded.”

“Alright,” Jeanne agreed immediately. After thinking for a moment, she asked, “It’s evident that my father has committed a crime, right? !”

“The fact that Alexander committed a crime has been established. What we need to know now is whether or not there was an accomplice. If we eliminate all other possibilities and confirm that Alexander was the only one who did it, his case will be dealt with very quickly.”
