Chapter 1752: Shelly’s Change of Heart Towards Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After bandaging NOX’S knee, Shelly found some bruise relief cream and applied it to NOX’S inner thigh.

Looking at the scarily swollen area, Shelly could not help but ask, “Do you want to go to the hospital?”

“No, it’s fine. My bones aren’t broken, and I don’t need stitches. If I go to the hospital, I’ll just be prescribed some medicine to treat my bruises, and it won’t have much effect. I’ll be fine in two days,” Nox said calmly.

Shelly also knew that Nox was right, so she did not insist and gently applied the cream to Nox. Although her movement was gentle, it still hurt when it touched his bruised inner side, and his expression changed.

Shelly also noticed it, but of course, she did not expose him. Instead, she asked, “Nox, did you get into an accident today because you were in a hurry and drove too fast?”

“No. One of the motorcycles violated the traffic rules, and the driver couldn’t react in time, so the car hit the railing. It was really a small accident. The driver was sent to the hospital because he had a concussion, but I’m fine. I just a little bruise on my leg.” Nox said nonchalantly.

He spoke as if car accidents were very common and his accident was nothing compared to the rest. “Did you have pastry because you were in a hurry?” Shelly asked, “Didn’t you have lunch?”

“The food in the cafeteria isn’t good. I’ve been asking them to improve, but it’s still the same. I didn’t know it was so difficult to find a good chef!” Nox said frustratedly. “So, before they improve, I didn’t like to eat in the cafeteria. That was why I bought the pastries.”

“You don’t like pastry.” Shelly exposed him.

Compared to the food in the cafeteria, he probably hated pastry more. Moreover, she seemed to have read a post once saying that the Winter Enterprise’s cafeteria was famous for its delicious food. Apparently, it was because their president, Mr. Winter, was very picky.

“It’s not bad to eat it occasionally.”

“But you have a lot left.”

“That’s because I bought a lot.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Shelly looked up at Nox, who was stunned by Shelly’s sudden gaze. He did not know when it started, but he started to fear Shelly. Even a casual look from her could make him panic and wonder what he had done to make her unhappy or even disgusted.

“Nox, no matter what, thank you.” Shelly stopped putting him on the spot.

She knew Nox has his own ego too. After all, that man had always been a victim of his pride.

Nox gulped, not expecting Shelly to thank him and so sincerely at that.

Nox was so nervous that he stuttered, “N-N-No need to thank me. I promised Bella I would go, so I would definitely keep my word. I’m just fulfilling my promise.”

“Yes.” Shelly nodded.

In the end, she still found that Nox had changed a lot. In the past, nothing Nox said could be trusted, but now he had suddenly become so trustworthy.

Shelly applied the cream to Nox’s bruised and swollen areas before going to the closet to find a set of pajamas for Nox. “Change into pajamas before you go to bed, especially pants. You must put one on.”

She knew that Nox usually only wore boxers to sleep. However, that way, he would easily rub against the wound and rub the medicine off.

“Yes,” Nox replied.

“Sleep for a while. I’ll wake you up when it’s time for dinner.”

“Alright.”

Shelly walked out and closed the door for Nox.

Nox watched as Shelly left. Somehow, he felt that Shelly seemed a little gentler to him, but he did not dare to believe it. He was afraid that the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.

Nox changed into the pajamas that Shelly gave him and lay on the bed, feeling a little emotional. Even if Shelly smiled at him, he would feel extremely excited.

As he lay on the bed and stared blankly at the ceiling above his head, his heart was beating irregularly. He eventually fell asleep after a long time because he had overexerted himself today.

In his dreams, he thought he felt Shelly come in and stay by his side, accompanying him. Even if it was a dream, it felt like bliss.

By the time Nox woke up, the sky was very dark. He did not know how long he had slept, but in any case, it should be getting late. Hence, Nox picked up the phone on the coffee table and glanced at it..
