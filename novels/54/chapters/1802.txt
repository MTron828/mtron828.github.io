Chapter 1803: The Start of Their Happy Ending (End of the Series)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There was indeed no hope.

Lying on the sofa, Nox heard their conversation loud and clear. He was actually prepared to lose Shelly, but he was still hopeful because he loved her too much.

Nox suddenly sat up from the sofa, and the other four people just looked at him, watching his abnormal behavior.

He said, “I’m going back.”

“Are you finally ready to go back?” Monica asked.

“I’m getting married tomorrow. If I don’t go back now, I won’t be able to attend the wedding.” Nox burped.

Even Monica thought the current Nox was a little pitiful. It was clearly not the wedding he wanted, but he still had to force himself to go through it, mainly to let go of Shelly and himself.

Just as Nox stood up from the sofa, he lost his balance. Edward supported him. “Are you sure you want to go back?” “Yes.” Nox nodded.

Every time he was with Edward, he was as obedient as a little lamb.

“Let’s go. I’ll send you back.” With that, Edward dragged Nox away.

His actions were a little rough, and Jeanne found it a little hard to watch. Could he be gentler knowing that Nox was heartbroken?

After Edward stuffed Nox into the car, he held Jeanne’s hand and said to Monica and Finn, “I’ll send Nox back. You guys should head back early too.” “Is Nox okay?” Monica was still a little worried.

“He’ll live. Rest assured, it’s not a big problem,” Edward said bluntly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne was speechless at how unsympathetic Edward was to Nox, who seemed to have given up all hope in this world.

As Edward dragged Jeanne into the car, Nox leaned back in his chair and looked out the window.

Seeing how lonely he looked, Jeanne could not help but comfort him. “Nox, you don’t have to be in such a hurry to get married. Marriage isn’t child’s play. Give yourself some time to think about it.”

“There’s no need to think about it.” Nox said faintly, “If it’s not Shelly, it can be anyone.”

“Perhaps you’ll think differently after some time.”

“No.” Nox shook his head. In this life, he loved no one else but Shelly.

Jeanne turned to look at Edward, hoping that he could persuade Nox to not just marry anyone or he might regret it.

“Let him make his own decision.” Edward, however, did not object to Nox’s decision. “He’s an adult. He can make his own judgment.”

Jeanne was speechless because she had never seen Edward trust Nox so much!

When the car arrived at the Winters’ residence, Edward got out of the car and helped the drunk Nox inside, with Jeanne following beside them. It was not easy for them to help Nox onto the bed. As soon as Nox’s body hit the bed, he turned over and fell asleep with the blanket in his arms.

Just as Edward held Jeanne’s hand and was about to leave, Jeanne asked, “Are we going to ignore him?”

“Don’t worry about it.”

“Aren’t you going to change his clothes or take off his shoes?” Jeanne did not think Edward was a good friend. “He can do it himself.” “He’s drunk.”

“He’ll wake up in a while.”

“Is he your best friend?”

“Why does it seem like you care more about him than me?” Edward suddenly changed the topic.

That sudden question stunned Jeanne. In her defense, she thought Nox seemed pretty miserable alone.

“Jeanne, I can get jealous too!” Edward’s tone was stern.

“Don’t be so petty!”

“I’ve never been magnanimous when it comes to you.”

Jeanne was speechless. In any case, she could never outspeak Edward.

“You can’t show concern about other men in the future,” Edward instructed.

However, Jeanne did not say anything in response to that, clearly angry.

Edward, on the other hand, looked at Jeanne’s angry expression and instantly felt a little emotional. He could not help but cup Jeanne’s face and plant a kiss on it.

Jeanne blushed. The man’s ability to be aroused anywhere shocked her.

She was about to resist when the person on the bed suddenly sat up. “Can you give me a break?”

Jeanne blushed even more, but Edward pulled Jeanne into her arms and looked at Nox.

“If you want to flirt with each other, can you stay away from me? How could you provoke me like that when I’m about to die of sadness?” Nox was furious.

How could they treat him like that when he was in this state? “Nox, are you awake?” Jeanne asked with concern..
