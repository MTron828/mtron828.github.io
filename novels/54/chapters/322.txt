Chapter 323: The Wedding: Announcing It to the World

Jeanne was stunned.

She thought Monica would say that the wedding was too fast and that there was no time to prepare.

“Look, Finn and I are planning to get a divorce, so obviously, that idea is a bad omen.”

“You’re overthinking it with all these omens!” Jeanne was speechless. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“In short, you and Fourth Master Swan must stay together. Don’t follow mine and Finn’s footsteps. I regret meeting Finn and even taking the initiative to pursue him.I’ve never felt so humiliated in my life!”

‘Do you have to be so dramatic?’ Jeanne thought

Jeanne was a little speechless while holding her phone.

At that moment, there was a knock on her door. “Director Lawrence, the person in charge of MUK Group has arrived.”

Jeanne nodded.

She said into her phone, “Monica, I have a meeting. I’ll talk to you later.”

“You’re still at work at a time like this? Shouldn’t you be resting, doing your beauty treatments, and preparing for the wedding?”

Ahem. She was very busy.

Moreover, the Fourth Master did not seem to have asked her to prepare anything.

......

She said, “I’ll talk to you later.”

After that, she hung up the call.

Monica looked at the words ‘end of call’ and felt a little displeased.

When she got married back then, even though she was really heartbroken to marry Finn, in the end, in order to make herself the center of attention, she had to prepare more than half a month in advance. On the other hand, Jeannie was too calm.

Could it be that she was forced to get married?!

Forced to get married by Fourth Master Swan?

On second thought, no matter what, she had always found Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne a perfect match.

With that, she sat in her office and took out her phone to read the gossip, which was filled with the news of Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan getting married.

It was trending everywhere.

Looking at the comments and joining them, she was in a good mood.

However, while a few families were happy, a few were worried.

The Lawrences were shocked to find out that Jeanne was going to marry Fourth Master Swan.

When Jenifer saw the news, she did not react at all.

She thought, ‘How could it be?’

How could Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne get married for real?

Were they not just in a physical relationship?

Was Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne not together so that he did not have to be related to the Sanders by marriage?

How could they get married?

She could not take it anymore and called Jasmine, who was also devastated.

Jasmine, too, found out through the news that Jeanne was going to get married to Fourth Master Swan.

How could Jeanne have seduced Fourth Master Swan?

Jasmine could not accept it.

“Jasmine, you’ve married into the Snow family, but what exactly are you doing? I told you to help the Lawrences, but you couldn’t do it and didn’t bring us any benefits. Now you can’t even send us a message! Why on earth did you marry into the Snow family? Fourth Master Swan is marrying Jeanne, yet you don’t even know!” Jenifer was so angry that her voice was trembling.

All of Jeanne’s previous achievements aside, Jeanne was now marrying Fourth Master Swan, which she could not accept.

If Jeanne really got together with Fourth Master Swan, Jeanne’s background would be even stronger.

Then, it would be even harder for them to go against Jeanne. Moreover, would Old Master Lawrence, who always put interests first, hand over the Lawrence Enterprise to Jeanne just as she feared?

No!

She had worked hard all her life just for herself and her children to become true celebrities in upper-class society.

She had finally become part of the Lawrences, and the label of being a mistress had disappeared. Now, she just hoped Jasmine and Joshua could have their own status in the upper-class society. Then, their family would be a real upper-class! At first, she was satisfied with Jasmine’s development as marrying the Eldest Young Master Swan could be considered a great leap. Although Joshua was not a good-for-nothing, as the only son of the Lawrences, he would definitely inherit the Lawrences’ assets sooner or later, so there was no need to worry too much in the future.

Yet now, Jeanne has popped up out of the blue and distributed her plan.

She even believed that Jeanne’s return this time was not a simple one. Jeanne was back just to take revenge, and once she got everything she wanted, she would kill all of them!

No!

She had worked hard her entire life. She definitely could not let it go to waste.

The scowl on Jenifer’s face was visible.

Jasmine, on the other end of the phone, was having a breakdown. “I really don’t know how Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne got together! There wasn’t even a whisper about it, and suddenly, they announced they were getting married. I have asked Eden before too. He always said that used goods like Jeanne could never marry his uncle, whose father would never agree to this marriage, so I didn’t take it to heart. Moreover, I always thought Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne only got together to stop the Sanders. I didn’t expect that they would really...”
