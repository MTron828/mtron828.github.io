1058 Finn Gets Angry And Nox Attacks

It took a long time for the call to connect. “Finn, are you crazy? It’s the middle of the night, I just fell asleep–”

Finn looked at the document in his hand and said, “Nox, I have something that I need your help with.”

Nox was at a loss for words.

Finn would rarely take the initiative to ask for help unless it was really serious.

…

When Monica left Finn’s office, she wrapped herself in her trench coat and went to the intensive care unit instead of her mother’s ward.

In the intensive care ward, her mother had left. It must have been because her uncle persuaded her to.

Besides, it was really late now, and everyone was resting.

However, she was not sleepy at all.

She just stared at the person on the other side of the glass window and watched as he lay there, motionless.

She asked, “Dad, will you wake up again?”

In fact, he could not hear her.

The glass of the intensive care unit was very thick, so he could not hear anything from the outside world at all.

“Finn said your heart went into brief shock. Is it ... Is it because our hearts are connected as father and daughter? I also wanted to leave this world for a moment there. Did you want to accompany me too?” Monica asked him.

The moment she asked him, her tears kept falling.

She was really tired, so tired that she wanted to give up.

However, she knew very well that once she gave up, she would not only give up their family’s wealth but also their happy lives.

Michael would never let her go. Once she lost everything, Michael could think of ten thousand ways to torture her.

Therefore, she did not dare to give up.

She did not want to be trampled on, nor did she want the people closest to her to see her being trampled on.

She said, “Dad, I’ll do my best. If I still fail, I’ll accept my fate. Don’t blame me when the time comes!”

Monica laughed so hard that her vision was blurry.

After that, she turned around and returned to her mother’s ward.

In the ward, Ruby and Sarah were on the same bed, while Ron was on another. They all seemed to be asleep.

Monica carefully laid down on the sofa and lay there quietly.

Suddenly, there was some movement beside her. Hence, she opened her eyes, only to see her mother in front of her.

Her throat moved slightly as she called out softly, “Mom.”

Ruby suddenly hugged her tightly.

Monica still got emotional because of her mother’s emotions and her warmth.

“I’m sorry, Monica.” Ruby’s tears fell.

“What’s wrong?”

“I was too agitated just now. I really don’t blame you. I was just too afraid of losing your father, so I couldn’t help but lash out at you. I’m sorry, Monica…”

Monica knew, so she did not take it to heart. After all, when people were forced into a corner, they would naturally act out a little.

“Mom, don’t cry. I know you don’t blame me.” Monica sat up from the sofa.

Ruby sat beside her daughter.

She, too, had lost a lot of weight because she had been worrying about her husband recently.

Monica said, “Don’t worry about me. I’m a big girl now.”

“Monica...”

“It’s true. I can accept and face anything.” Monica held her mother’s hand. “Believe me, I’m all grown up now.”

“I really didn’t expect that we would end up like this one day. I can’t stop thinking back to when your father was still fine. At that time, the three of us were really, really happy...”

“Yes, me too.” Monica smiled. “That’s why we should live well for the sake of the people who are important to us, okay?”

“I used to be the one protecting you. I was always afraid that you wouldn’t be able to take the blow. But now, I’m letting you take on everything. I’m really not a good mother.”

“You’ve already protected me so much when I was growing up. Now that you’re old and I’ve grown up, shouldn’t I be the one to protect you?” Monica smiled and wiped her mother’s tears. “Don’t cry. We’re not as weak as we think. One day, everything will pass.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ruby nodded.

That night, Monica chatted with her mother for the whole night, with little to no sleep.

She knew that her mother was afraid that her father would suddenly go into cardiac shock again. She was scared that if she closed her eyes, her father would really leave this world.
