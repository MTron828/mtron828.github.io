Chapter 371: Danger Level Up, Jeanne’s Ability Exposed

In Balti Islands.

On the vast sea, Jeanne and Edward were on the yacht, feeling the tranquillity of the world.

Leaving behind the hustle and bustle of the city, the intrigue, and the hatred and revenge, they could actually live such a leisurely life.

Jeanne was thinking about whether such a day would come when she could live such a peaceful life.

As her thoughts wavered, the man beside her hugged her tightly.

After applying sunscreen on each other, they hugged each other on the sofa on the deck, watching the waves rise and fall in front of them.

Jeanne actually enjoyed that moment very much.

At first, she rejected coming here with Edward because, for one, they were in a marriage of convenience, and she did not think there was a need for a honeymoon trip; secondly, she thought Edward was holding her up from her work as she had many things to do.

However, at that moment, she admitted that she had fallen in love with the idea.

She was a little reluctant to part with such a day. She suddenly wanted to indulge…

Just as she was lost in her thoughts, someone’s embrace around her tightened. Then, Edward immediately picked Jeanne up from the yacht and jumped into the sea.

“Oh... Edward...” Jeanne was caught off guard.

As she and Edward fell into the sea together, Jeanne quickly closed her mouth and held her breath.

......

After the two of them jumped into the sea, Jeanne wanted to struggle to get out. However, at that moment, Edward pulled her down fiercely to stay below the surface and quickly swam further away.

Jeanne stared at Edward, stunned.

At that moment, she could also feel that something was not right.

Above sea level, she seemed to hear the sound of an engine. It was getting closer and closer and then further and further away.

Then…

With a bang, a violent explosion sounded behind them.

Jeanne’s body tensed up, and she turned around, only to see that their speedboat had shattered into pieces in the sea.

Obviously, it had been blown up by a bomb!

She gritted her teeth.

Edward was still dragging her along with him as they swam further away.

They swam quite a distance until Jeanne was sure she could no longer hold her breath, so she gestured for Edward to go up.

Upon noticing that she was barely holding on, Edward nodded and dragged Jeanne up.

The two of them revealed their heads on the surface of the sea. The first thing they did when they went up was to take a deep breath and observe their surroundings at the same time.

The helicopter above them was still hovering in the sky.

As the two of them were a little far from the speedboat, the helicopter did not notice their presence on the vast sea surface. Moreover, the people on the helicopter were probably only focusing their attention on the speedboat that they had blown up.

At that moment, a few people in diving suits came down from the hovering helicopter.

Edward grabbed Jeanne’s hand and made a prompt decision. “Let’s go.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

The two of them dived back into the bottom of the sea and swam further away together.

No one was following them for the time being, probably because the people on the helicopter were still searching for their “bodies”, not expecting that they had already left.

The two of them swam for a long time and came to an uninhabited island in the Balti Islands.

It was not the island that they lived on.

In fact, it was another archipelago that seemed like it had yet been developed.

The two of them panted as they lay on the beach. They were both physically and mentally exhausted.

Jeanne looked at the sky above her, where the sun had already set.

She and Edward had been in the sea for almost a day. Hence, the two of them were now taking a break to recover their strength.

After a long time, Edward suddenly sat up and went over to pick Jeanne up.

“I can do it myself.” Jeanne also got up from the beach.

At that, Edward nodded.

Jeanne said, “Why don’t we return to our small island?”

“If the other party couldn’t find my body, the first place they would go would be our small island. So, we can only stay on this island for now. I have already sent a message to Nox. He will come to pick us up.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Jeanne furrowed her brows. “When did you send the message?”

Edward smiled and waved his watch.

Jeanne was stunned. It turned out that Edward’s watch was different.

“It has a location and a call function,” Edward explained, “so Nox will find us very soon.”

It was as if he was comforting her.

Jeanne nodded and asked, “Do you know who’s trying to kill us?”

Edward stayed silent for a few seconds, which made Jeanne frown.

Edward said, “I’m afraid I’ll scare you if I tell you.”

Jeanne frowned even more.

Edward said, “In any case, believe me.”
