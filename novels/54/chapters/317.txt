Chapter 318: Set a Date for the Wedding

Zachary then glanced at Edward, and Jeanne also did the same.

Was that a joke?!

From saying yes to the wedding yesterday to the wedding day only took four days. Could four days be enough to prepare for a wedding?

On second thought, maybe it would be a simple wedding, so she accepted it.

In any case, Fourth Master Swan had the final say.

“Have you thought about the wedding gift?” Zachary asked Edward. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It seemed that he had accepted it too.

“I have thought about it,” Edward replied. “I will transfer all the original shares of Swan Enterprise to Jeanne.”

Stunned, Jeanne turned her head to look at Edward.

Zachary also looked at him in the same way.

Edward said, “Not much. Only eight percent.”

According to Swan Enterprise’s current assets, which were worth 100 billion yuan, eight percent were worth just over 10 billion yuan.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

......

“It’s not much. Compared to Ms. Lawrence’s assets, it’s just a small amount.” Zachary nodded.

Could she say that the money in her account was not hers?!

In her head, she was still trying to figure out how much money she had, how much money she had to prepare for a dowry for herself, and whether she could afford the wedding gift.

“Wade,” Zachary called out to the person beside him.

Jeanne was still in a daze when she saw Wade handing Zachary a box, which looked like an old jewelry box.

He took it out and handed it to Edward. “This is a small token of my appreciation.”

Edward froze for a moment before raising his head to look at his father.

Jeanne did not know why Fourth Master Swan suddenly fell silent, but she could tell that the gift was very valuable.

Then, she saw Edward receive it silently. “Thank you, dad.”

Zachary nodded and did not say anything more.

Edward placed the box beside her and did not give it to Jeanne or take it out for her to see what it was.

In any case, Jeanne thought that the gift was not a simple one.

After dinner, Edward left the table with Jeanne.

Jeanne did not expect that dinner with Old Master Swans would be so easy. She had always thought she would be made difficult or something. She even made preparations to face death calmly. However, everything was peaceful, and nothing happened.

It was just a simple meeting with a parent.

Just as the two of them were about to leave,Old Master Swan suddenly said, “Ms. Lawrence, come with me to the tea room.”

Edward tightened his grip on Jeanne’s hand.

“Marriage is your own matter, and I won’t interfere. I just want to have a simple chat with Ms. Lawrence.” Zachary could see through his son’s thoughts at a glance.

However, Edward did not let go of Jeanne.

On the contrary, Jeanne was very calm, and she called out to him, “Fourth Master.”

It was as if she was telling him to let go.

Edward kept silent for a few seconds before letting go of her.

Just like that, Jeanne followed Old Master Swan into the tea room.

To be honest, it was better to talk things out so that she would not have to guess what those people were thinking.

She sat opposite Old Master Swan while Old Master Swan took a sip of tea and said, “I didn’t think you would still come back.”

Jeanne pursed her lips, not knowing what to say.

That year... she actually came to look for Fourth Master Swan.

It was not the night she slept with him, but it was when Alexander had beaten her up so badly that she was sent to the hospital. After she came out of the hospital, she endured all the injuries on her body and went to look for Fourth Master Swan at the Swans’ residence.

She knew Fourth Master Swan would not take the initiative to look for her, but he was her last hope — her only hope.

At that time, she really needed someone, someone she could rely on to help her recuperate and take revenge!

When she showed up at the Swans, she did not see Fourth Master Swan. Instead, she saw Old Master Swan.

Old Master Swan brought her into Universe Garden, and if she remembered correctly, it was the same house.

At that time, he told her bluntly, “Jeanne, you’re not good enough for my son.”

She was 18 years old that year.

At 18 years old, it was her first time facing a person alone. In her eyes, he was an unapproachable big shot.

Deep down, she was scared, but she mustered up her courage and said to Old Master Swan, “I know, but I just need Fourth Master Swan’s help.”

“He won’t help you,” he said bluntly and indifferently.

“We’ve slept together.”

“That doesn’t mean anything,” Old Master Swan said cruelly. “It only means that you’re frivolous.”

Jeanne bit her lip.

At that moment, she was very embarrassed to be told that.

“I’ll give you a sum of money as a reward for sleeping with you.” Old Master Swan tried to send her away by offering her money.

Back then, Jeanne had never been short of money before.
