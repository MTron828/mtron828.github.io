1266 Jeanne Goes Into Labor

As soon as she started writing, she lost track of time again.

When she noticed the time, it was already past 11 o’clock in the evening.

She stretched her back.

The baby inside her belly was reminding her that it was time to rest.

She slowly got up from the chair and left George’s room.

Just as she stepped out of the room, she saw that Edward had returned from outside.

Seeing that she was still awake, he was a little surprised, “Still up?”

“I was waiting for you.” Jeanne smiled slightly.

Edward was obviously stunned for a moment.

“How is Susan’s father?” Jeanne walked to him.

It seems very intimate.

Of course Edward did not refuse.

He took Jeanne’s hand, went back to the room with her, and said, “So far he’s out of the woods, but because of the damage to the brain, he needs to rest in the hospital for a few more days.”

“That’s good.” Jeanne looked very composed, “Then these days, will you go to the hospital often?”

“Yeah.” Edward nodded.

Jeanne did not show any emotions either.

Two of them walked into the room.

Jeanne went to take a shower.

Edward also went to take a bath.

Jeanne looked at him, “Do you want to go together?”

“Okay.” Edward agreed.

Jeanne was speechless.

She was asking if he wants to get in together, and not as an invitation.

All right then.

After all, the two of them took a bath together before.

They lay on the bed after taking a shower and slept.

They hugged each other and slept.

Jeanne thought that since time was running out, she should cherish the remaining time with him.

“Jeannie.” In the quiet room, Edward suddenly called her.

“Hmm?” Jeanne was already a little confused at that time.

She usually fell asleep very quickly.

Once sleepy, she would fall asleep right when she lay on the bed.

“Have you ever regretted it?” Edward asked.

“Huh?” Jeanne’s drowsiness gradually diminished.

“Have you ever regretted being with me?” Edward whispered in her ear.

“I don’t regret it.” Jeanne affirmed.

There was nothing to regret.

When she chose this path, she had already made all the preparations.

Nothing to regret.

However…

She murmured, “If I were given another choice, I would not come to you.”

Because it hurt too much.

It hurt too much for the both of them.

She actually thought about it.

If she had not climbed onto Edward’s bed back then, if she had not used Edward to achieve her wish later, if they had not fallen in love.

Even if they died.

Then let it be.

There won’t be as much sadness.

She turned over and turned her back to Edward, she said, “Rest early.”

“Good night.” Edward hugged her in his arms.

All the words seemed to be swallowed.

The two fell asleep slowly.

...

For the next few days.

...

Edward would leave the villa from time to time.

Occasionally, he would be seen on the news, but Edward would actually take the initiative to tell her where he was going.

Most of the time, he was out to accompany Susan and visit Susan’s father.

Jeanne also found her own thing to do at home every day.

She wrote to George.

Eventually, she wrote a lot.

She thought that if she could not grow up with George, she could at least give him some warmth.

Such days—warm and peaceful days.

It had been a month.

Jeanne was nine months pregnant.

Dr. Jones came again to give a prenatal checkup, and he could not help but praise, “The baby is growing very well this month, and it already weighs 6.6 pounds.”

...

“Yeah?”

“Generally, thirty-eight weeks is considered a full term. In other words, there are still two weeks left, and the baby may be born at any time.” Dr. Jones said while helping her with the prenatal checkup.

“Um.”

“Fourth Master isn’t that busy these days, is he?” Dr. Jones asked Edward who was beside him.

“Not busy.”

“If you’re not busy, it’s best to stay by Jeanne’s side 24 hours a day. The last month is very important. Once there is a sign of contraction, she must be ready to give birth at any time,” Dr. Jones reminded.

“Okay.” Edward agreed.

“Will you help me deliver the baby?” Jeanne was suddenly curious.

Dr. Jones blushed instantly.

C-section was fine.

He could still do it.

However, as for a natural birth…

He turned his head and glanced at Edward.

“No, Alex has a team of doctors, and he will personally send someone to help you deliver the baby.” Edward said bluntly.

So, everything is ready.

When she gave birth to the baby safely, her life would be over.

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

Some sensitive topics should be brushed aside.

The checkup was over.

Dr. Jones reminded them of some precautions and left without much delay.

Jeanne and Edward were on the sofa in the living room, and Jeanne was looking at Dr. Jones’s medical advice.

“Do you want to bring George back?” Edward asked suddenly.

“No.” Jeanne shook her head.

It’s better not to see him.

Seeing George might be harder on Jeanne.

Edward nodded, “Okay.”

“Don’t you need to go out today?” Jeanne asked.

A few days ago, it was because of Susan’s father. He basically accompanied Susan to visit every day.

Later, it seemed that Alex was looking for him for something, and he was busy for many days after.

Jeanne was flattered to suddenly have Edward not going anywhere today.

“I won’t go out anymore. In the last month, I will be with you 24 hours a day.” Edward promised.

Jeanne just listened to his promise.

Because many times, it was not that he did not want to fulfil his promise but he could not.

Even so, the day after the promise was made, Edward went out.

In the next few days, people went out one after another.

It was hard to be with her all day.

At thirty-eight weeks, Dr. Jones came for another medical examination. He said that the baby was very calm and would not come out until forty weeks.

Jeanne did not panic too much.

Even so, she could not help but hope the baby would stay in the womb a little longer.

A little longer in the womb meant she could live a little longer.

At thirty-nine weeks, Dr. Jones came to check again. He said that there was no sign of delivery.

He told her to just keep a lookout on it every day, and she did just that.

Edward was also paying attention.

Whenever he could stay home, he would. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At thirty-nine weeks and three days, Jeanne and Edward saw that there were more people at home when they came back from a walk in the back garden.

There were some medical staff.

Everyone was respectful when they saw Edward, “Fourth Master, we are here to deliver Ms. Lawrence’s baby.”

They called her Miss Lawrence, and not Madam.

Of course, Jeanne was not bothered either.

After all, she belonged to Alex, and in Alex’s mind, she was probably already a dead person.

After that day, there were many more people in Bamboo Garden.

In addition to the medical staff, there were also more guards.

Probably because Edward could not do anything to prevent her from giving birth.

At thirty-nine weeks and five days, Jeanne got up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet.

Then…

Her water broke.
