Chapter 198: Don’t Be Afraid, I’ll Always Be With You

At the entrance of the court, Jeanne’s heart moved.

After she heard Fourth Master Swan say those words, before the reporters could react, she added, “Eden, you should know your place. The matters of the elders aren’t something that you can interfere in, nor is it something that you have the right to interfere in. Don’t lose the Swans’ upbringing!”

She talked quite a bit.

Eden was probably embarrassed.

There was even a second of awkwardness at the scene.

Eden pursed his lips tightly. Being taught a lesson in public by his fourth uncle so bluntly made him super embarrassed.

Due to Fourth Master Swan’s words, the reporters suddenly did not know how to smooth things over.

There was a moment of stalemate.

When Jeanne heard what Edward said, she had to admit that it was very warm to be protected by others sometimes.

Even so, she did not let herself think too much.

She lifted her feet and left.

In fact, she was still thinking about how she would probably be scolded by Kingsley again if he knew Fourth Master Swan spoke up for her in public.

Speaking of which, what did she do wrong between her and Fourth Master Swan?

It was clearly Fourth Master Swan’s wishful thinking, so why did it become a matter between the two of them in the end?

The two of them were apparently “having an affair”.

Jeanne did not expect things to turn out like this.

She could even imagine how the media would publicize it if Fourth Master Swan stood up for her today.

Jeanne would not be able to clear her name no matter what.

Thinking of this, she left.

She had just taken two steps when someone suddenly pulled her back.

Her body froze.

It was that one second when her heart felt like it had been struck, even if she had allowed herself to ignore it.

Jeanne turned her head.

She turned her head and saw Fourth Master Swan appear behind her.

The reporters behind also caught up and asked while panting, “Fourth Master, what’s your relationship with Jeanne?”

“Fourth Master, do you like Jeanne?”

“You spoke up for Jeanne. Is it true that you’re dating as the rumors say?”

“Fourth Master, Jeanne has experienced so much and was once your nephew’s girlfriend. Are you not afraid of awkwardness when you’re with her?”

Edward tugged at Jeanne’s arm.

He turned his head and faced all the reporters. “Yes, Jeanne and I are dating.”

“...” Jeanne wanted to bang her head against the stone pillar at the entrance of the court.

Especially when she saw Kingsley at this moment.

He was standing at a distance. As no one knew him, naturally, he did not attract too much attention.

Beside him was George.

The two of them were looking at her from afar.

“I don’t think I need to explain the details of our relationship to you guys!” Edward narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

The reporters did not dare to ask anymore at this moment.

No one dared to ask what was on the tip of their tongue.

They could only watch helplessly as the interaction between Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne continued.

Then, clicking sounds could be heard continuously.

Jeanne wanted to leave as soon as possible.

Nevertheless, she was held back by Fourth Master Swan at this time.

Moreover, Fourth Master Swan had publicly “admitted” their relationship. What could she do…?!

She just watched as Fourth Master Swan suddenly reached out his hand to her cheek.

Jeanne’s heartbeat quickened. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Seriously, she was really afraid that this man in front of her would kiss her in public.

For a second, she was waiting for his move as if she was facing death.

Then, she heard his deep and gentle voice. “Don’t be afraid, I’ll always be with you.”

“...” What was she afraid of?

Despite that, Jeanne forced herself to smile.

It was just a sweet smile in response to him.

At least at this moment, she could not ruin Fourth Master Swan’s reputation.

Jeanne said, “Okay.”

Then, she gently moved her arm.

Edward let go of her.

“Fourth Master, I’ll go in first.”

Edward nodded slightly.

Jeanne turned around and left.

The moment she left, she could clearly feel the intense gaze of the people behind her. It even made her feel that her back was burning.

Only when Jeanne walked into the court did Edward retract his gaze.

He looked to the side and saw Kingsley walking past him coldly.

Nox and Finn, who were standing next to Edward, saw it too.

Nox was somewhat gloating over Kingsley’s misfortune.

Looking at Kingsley’s cold expression, one could tell that he must have been angered to death.

Nox felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart.

Fourth Master Swan was more skillful.

Edward did not stay any longer. He brought Nox and Finn into the court.

On the other hand, Eden was so angry that his face turned hideous. He stood there motionlessly.

He gritted his teeth and forced himself to remain calm. At least, he did not want the media to see his true emotions.
