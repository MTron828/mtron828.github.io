Chapter 549: Edward’s Identity Revealed (Back To The Main Story)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Even if I fail the college entrance exam, there are other schools I can go to. Even if there isn’t one, Aunt said she would support me for the rest of my life.” Sarah did not seem to care about her college entrance exam. All she was interested in… was Finn.

Monica rolled her eyes and ignored Sarah.

“Monica,” Sarah said from behind Monica. “Since you and Finn are divorced, I’m going after him. Please don’t be angry.”

However, Monica did not take it to heart because to her, Sarah was still a child.

She did not think Sarah would be serious, nor did she think Finn would fall for her.

There were many things that she did not expect. For example, the fact that Finn had given up on her completely.

…

In the marketing director’s office at Lawrence Enterprise’s headquarters, Jeanne had just finished a meeting.

After that, she went back to her office, picked up her phone, and saw a news pop up on her screen.

It was the news about Monica and Michael.

She looked at it and could feel her blood boiling. It even made her think how infuriated Dr. Jones must be when he saw it.

Dr. Jones was so protective of Monica, yet she gave it all to another man. If she were Dr. Jones, she would not have any more feelings for Monica.

Jeanne was filled with righteous indignation. She wanted to ring Monica up and scold her, but she controlled herself.

After all, Monica had her reasons for doing so.

She could tell that the reason Monica was so protective of Michael in front of the media was to help Michael solidify his position in the political scene as soon as possible. Once Michael had his career, Monica would be able to leave unscathed. All she wanted was to leave as soon as possible, and that was why she could be so absolute in doing that. However, little did she know that the more she rushed it, the more she was distancing herself from Dr. Jones.

Fortunately, Michael was a good person. If Monica could eventually be together with Michael and even fall in love with Michael, it would be good.

Otherwise…

It was hard for her to imagine how Monica would be able to live on after this “suicide”.

Right now, Jeanne could only pray that Michael was not too bad of a person.

She looked at the news for a while until her phone suddenly rang.

Jeanne looked at the incoming call, but for some reason, she felt a little nervous. Although it was just a call from Kingsley, she was terrified.

Nevertheless, she took a deep breath and picked up the call.

“At work?” the person on the other end of the phone asked. His tone was very casual, and it sounded no different from usual.

“Yes,” Jeanne replied.

“The DNA analysis of Fourth Master Swan and Old Master Swan is out,” Kingsley said.

Jeanne held her phone tightly.

It had been three days since George gave the hair to Miles, so by right, the results should have been a long time ago.

However, she did not ask, and Kingsley did not tell her either. She thought perhaps Kingsley would not tell her, but now, he had given her a call.

Jeanne kept quiet.

“You don’t want to know?” Kingsley asked. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“When did you become so good at keeping secrets?” Jeanne appeared to be very calm.

Kingsley chuckled. “I just want to know what you’re feeling right now.”

“I’m very calm.”

“I heard you admitted that George is Fourth Master Swan’s son.” Kingsley raised his eyebrows.

“I did.” Jeanne did not hide it since George would tell Kingsley everything.

In this world, besides her, Kingsley was the other person whom George trusted the most, and she did not want to drive a wedge between George and Kingsley.

“In the end, you still got yourself more involved with Fourth Master Swan.”

“From the moment you made me get married, isn’t everything within your expectations? If I said I had nothing with Fourth Master Swan, would you believe me?” Jeanne said somewhat sarcastically, “And the reason why I let Fourth Master Swan know that George is his son is to protect George. At least when you give me orders to do something, the Swans will not be ruthless toward George.”

“You’ve thought it through,” Kingsley commented.

Jeanne did not give him a reply.

Kingsley continued, “I won’t have you attack the Swans for the time being.”

In response, Jeanne furrowed her brows.

“It’s been tested. Fourth Master Swan and Old Master Swan are biological father and son.” Kingsley revealed the answer.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat, and for some reason, it started speeding up.

She did not know why her heart would race the moment she knew the answer.

It was a nervous feeling, and there was even some lingering fear.
