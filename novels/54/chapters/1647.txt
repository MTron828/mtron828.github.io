In fact, having someone care about her was more than she could ask for.

She avoided the topic and said, “I’ll leave Bella to you. Thank you.”

“Alright.”

After Shelly hung up, Benjamin’s guilty expression appeared in her mind, and her heart skipped a beat. She knew very well that her feelings for Benjamin were not as strong as sne put lt. However, sne COOK a aeep Dreatn ana told herself not to overthink it.

When she returned to the ward, Nox was lying on the bed like a boss. It made Shelly wonder how there could be so much difference between men. Why was she so… disgusted when it came to Nox?

Nevertheless, she could endure it very well. At least for today, she could endure it.

“Have you arranged it?” Nox looked at her and asked.

“Yes.” Shelly nodded.

“Then, peel a fruit for me,” Nox ordered.

Shelly knew how torturous Nox could be. After all, she had taken care of him before, and the year when his legs were crippled had really exhausted all her patience for him.

She secretly adjusted her emotions and said, “I’ll go buy it.” “Ten minutes.” Nox set the time.

Shelly nodded before she ran out and then ran back, panting.

Nox felt inexplicably happy because he thought Shelly could not bear to leave him, which was why she left and came back in such a hurry.

“I bought cherries and mangoes.” Shelly took out the fruits and said, “This is the best fruit around the hospital.”

She was afraid that Nox would be picky, so she bought the imported ones. It was so expensive that her heart ached. Ever since leaving the Winters, she had not eaten any of them. Sometimes, she would buy some for Bella, but they were all very ordinary breeds.

Nox did not say anything, which meant that he was satisfied.

Shelly washed the cherries and placed them in front of Nox. “You can eat them now. ”

“I want to play games. Feed me.” Nox took out his phone and entered the game interface.

Shelly pursed her lips, telling herself that it would only be for a day. Once he was discharged, she would not have to deal with him anymore. As such, she took out a cherry and put it by Nox’s mouth.

Nox ate the cherries calmly and then spat the seeds on Shelly’s hand. Just like that, Shelly fed Nox fruits while Nox played games. When all the cherries were finished, Shelly stood up and was about to leave.

“Where are you going?” Nox grabbed her hand.

“If you’re done eating, I’ll go throw the trash away,” Shelly said bluntly.

Only then did Nox let her go. However, after that, he kept looking at Shelly and suddenly lost interest in gaming.

Having felt Nox’s gaze, Shelly turned around and looked at him. “What else do you want?”

Nox returned to his senses and felt embarrassed that he had been staring at Shelly a lot recently. Even if he did not see her, his mind was filled with her. He said, “I’m not feeling well. Give me a massage.”

With that, he lay on the bed. As Shelly was used to it, she walked to Nox’s side emotionlessly and massaged him.

“Haven’t you eaten? Harder!” Nox ordered.

Shelly increased her strength, and Nox enjoyed it very much. He suddenly recalled the time when Shelly took care of him and was trying to seduce him. While Nox thought about it, he eventually fell asleep. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Shelly only stopped massaging after she was sure Nox was asleep. By then, her arms were tired, and she stood up and left the ward.

As she had not have lunch yet after spending the whole afternoon with Nox, she was so hungry that her stomach hurt. Hence, she decided to go out and eat something.

She had just ordered a plate of tacos at a small restaurant next to the hospital. However, before she could eat, Nox’s call came in. “Shelly, where the f*ck are you?”

He was furious.

Shelly tried to calm herself down. “I’ll be back soon.” “Come back right now!”

Shelly gritted her teeth and then said, “Okay!”

Looking at the tacos in front of her, she suddenly lost her appetite, so she paid for the food and went back to the ward.

In the ward, Nox’s face was red. “I just lay down for a while, and you were gone. Is this what you mean by taking care of me?”

Instead of answering Nox’s question, Shelly asked, “What do you need me to
