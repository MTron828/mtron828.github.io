Chapter 610: Alexander Exposed, Revenge Feels Great

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Michael noticed Monica’s gaze, and his expression turned ugly.

In Monica’s mind, the scene of Finn stepping forward to help Jeanne had clearly formed a stark contrast.

He admitted that his purpose in coming here today was to prevent Monica from doing anything out of the ordinary — to stop her every word and action.

However, he did not want Monica to find Finn better than him.

Besides, the reason why he could get Monica to help him to that extent was that Monica thought he treated her the best — that he was the kind of person who treated her unconditionally and selflessly.

He secretly gritted his teeth and acted as if nothing happened.

At that moment, Jeanne opened her mouth and said calmly, “My grandfather’s death was so sudden that I don’t think it was an accident. There were two reasons. Firstly, I didn’t have any arguments with my grandfather yesterday, so the accusation of me pissing him off so badly that he couldn’t sleep and accidentally fell down the stairs doesn’t stand. Secondly, when my grandfather fell from the stairs, it should have been very loud, but no one came out to check what happened. Even if the soundproofing in the house were great, the servants accompanying my grandfather would have been able to sense that my grandfather had woken up. They wouldn’t allow my grandfather to roam around in his wheelchair without them accompanying him.”

Jeanne’s words did make people suspicious.

Everyone was lamenting about Jonathan’s accidental fall, but none of them had thought about why he would suddenly fall.

Hence, upon hearing what Jeanne said, they also found it strange.

Logically speaking, they had many people in the house. There was no way no one would not know that Jonathan fell.

Moreover, Jonathan had a personal servant.

It was impossible for such an accident to happen.

“Miss, I did oversleep last night.” Jonathan’s personal servant looked haggard. He was probably feeling extremely guilty. “I’ve never slept so soundly before. After I washed master up and sent him to bed, I felt so sleepy. I didn’t even know when I fell asleep on the bed. When I woke up, it was already 12 a.m. Only then did I realize that the master in the next room was not there. That was when I hurriedly went downstairs and saw the master lying on the ground covered in blood...”

As soon as he said it, he started to sob.

“Did my grandfather call for you in the middle of the night?” Jeanne asked.

“No, I didn’t hear it.”

“Then does my grandfather usually need your help to get into his wheelchair?” Jeanne continued to ask.

“Yes. Usually, I would have to carry the master into the wheelchair. He hasn’t sat in the wheelchair by himself for a few years.”

Jeanne nodded and turned to Alexander. “Dad, don’t you think this matter is strange? Grandpa couldn’t even sit in the wheelchair himself. So, how did he get up in the middle of the night and fall down the stairs?”

Alexander was a little nervous, but on the surface, he looked calm.

“I told you. It was because you pissed him off so badly that he couldn’t sleep and got up in the middle of the night. As for how he got onto his wheelchair and why his servant didn’t help him... Didn’t his servant make it clear just now? He was so sound asleep that your grandfather couldn’t wake him up, so your grandfather could only get onto the wheelchair by himself.” Alexander was starting to get a little impatient. “You just want to clear your own name, and that’s why you’re deliberately trying to sow discord.”

“We both know whether it’s you or me who’s trying to sow discord.” Jeanne sneered. “In fact, I asked all those questions to tell everyone that my grandfather’s death wasn’t an accident. It was intentional.”

“What nonsense are you spouting? What kind of people do you think we, the Lawrences, are?” Alexander was furious.

Perhaps he had such a huge reaction because Jeanne was spot on about the accident being intentional.

Jeanne looked at him coldly before turning around and walking toward the huge LCD television hanging on the wall in the hall.

Alexander looked at Jeanne and felt panicky for some reason.

It was because he did not know what tricks Jeanne was playing.

While Jeanne turned on the television, everyone looked at her. They did not know what she was going to do, but they were somehow looking forward to it.

The hall was pin-drop silent.

After Jeanne turned on the television, she turned on her phone and started to make a wireless connection. Then, a video appeared on the television.

Jeanne said, “Everyone, please come over and take a look. I’m afraid you won’t be able to see it clearly if you stand too far.”

The moment she said that, the others walked over.

Alexander’s heart started to pound against his chest.

He could not seem to control his body as well. At that moment, he even wanted to stop Jeanne from doing whatever she was about to do.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
