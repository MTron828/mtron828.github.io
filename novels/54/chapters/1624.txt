“Don’t you think I’m greedy?”

“You must’ve had a reason for taking the money,” Benjamin praised.

Shelly could not help but laugh. She, too, would feel happy from getting validation sometimes.

“Do you want to have lunch at home?” Benjamin changed the topic.

“I don’t think there’s anything in the fridge.” Shelly remembered that she had emptied the fridge before she left because she was afraid that it would be rotten when she came back.

“I’ll go buy lunch.” Benjamin volunteered. “What would you like to eat?” “No need. Just keep an eye on Bella for me, and I’ll go buy lunch.”

“How can Bella be separated from you?” Benjamin was certain. “Just tell me what you like to eat, and I’ll buy it.”

Shelly saw that Benjamin had already walked out of the door.

“There’s a supermarket in the neighborhood.”

“I know. I saw it when we came in.” With that, Benjamin smiled and left.

Shelly stared at Benjamin as he left.

“Mommy, why are you so happy?” Bella looked at Shelly and asked curiously. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At that moment, Shelly came back to her senses and stopped smiling. “I’m happy because you’ve been discharged from the hospital in good health.”

“I thought it was because Mommy liked Uncle Ben,” Bella said innocently. “That was why you smiled when you were looking at him.”

“Little kid, watch what you say,” Shelly joked and patted Bella’s head. “Go watch TV on the sofa. I’ll cook for you.”

“Alright.” Bella ran over to the sofa and obediently watched cartoons.

Benjamin spent about 20 minutes buying groceries. By then, Shelly had cleaned the room and boiled some pasta.

“I didn’t know what you and Bella liked to eat, so I bought ingredients for a few recipes that I’m good at,” Benjamin said as he took out the groceries.

“Can you cook?”

“As someone from a poor family, I had to take care of my family at an early age.” Benjamin smiled. Shelly thought it made sense.

“Try my cooking,” Benjamin said.

Shelly hesitated for a few seconds before nodding. “Okay.” “In that case, go sit over there. I’ll call you when I’m done.”

“Let me help you. I can be your assistant or something,” Shelly said.

“That works too.” Benjamin nodded.

Shelly found an apron for Benjamin. Seeing that it was pink, Benjamin laughed.

“I don’t have another for men, so you’ll have to make do with it.”

“Fortunately, you don’t have one for a man,” Benjamin said.

Shelly pursed her lips and did not answer. Benjamin, on the other hand, did not say anything else either.

Just like that, the two of them made lunch together as a team. They did not talk much, but it was very heartwarming. In the end, they made a salad, mushroom soup, some steak, and some pasta.

“Bella, come and eat,” Shelly called out.

Bella hurriedly turned off the television and ran over with her short legs. She looked at the table full of food and said, “It smells so good. I really want to eat it.”

“Wash your hands first,” Shelly said and was about to carry Bella to the bathroom.

However, Benjamin had already taken off his apron and picked Bella up. “I’ll go.”

Shelly watched the interaction between Benjamin and Bella and then looked away, not allowing herself to overthink it.

After Benjamin washed Bella’s hands, he carried her back to the dining table. Bella had been able to eat by herself since she was three years old. Hence, she held a fork and began to eat by herself.

As she ate, she praised, “Uncle Ben’s steak is delicious.”

“If you like it, have more.” Benjamin gently caressed Bella’s head, taking care of him.

“Please eat. Bella can eat on her own,” Shelly told Benjamin.

“Alright.” Benjamin nodded and looked up at Shelly. “Do you like it?”

Shelly nodded. “It’s quite delicious.”

“That’s good.” Benjamin smiled brightly.

Shelly looked at his smile, but in the end, she made herself look away.

After lunch, Shelly habitually cleaned up the dishes and went to wash them when Benjamin said, “I’ll do it.”

“You made the food, so I’ll do the dishes.”

“Since I’m the one who cooked, I should do the dishes. Of course, I have to do the whole thing and not give up halfway.”

Shelly could not win against Benjamin, who had put on the apron again. Since Bella needed to go to the washroom at that moment, Shelly carried Bella to the washroom.

Suddenly, a knock came from the door. As such, Benjamin put down the plate and went to open the door. The moment he opened the door, he saw Nox, who looked anxious, as if something big had happened..
