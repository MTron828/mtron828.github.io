Edward frowned as he looked at Kingsley.

“But I never thought of working with you.”

“I can help you to destroy M Underground Organization,” Edward said.

Kingsley stopped in his tracks.

“M Underground Organization has been growing in recent years. Shouldn’t the Hills feel threatened?” Edward asked.

“There will always be other forces on the rise. The Hills aren’t the only force in the world, and we can’t stop them.” Kingsley was unmoved.

“If I remember correctly, the Hills once killed the sister of the leader of M Underground Organization. I believe they will not let this matter rest. Even if the Hills can tolerate the existence of other organizations, you won’t tolerate the existence of an organization that wants to destroy the Hills, right?”

“You know everything.” Kingsley’s face darkened.

“Otherwise, how would I have the confidence to save Jeanne?”

“Since you’re so determined, I’ll work with you this once.” Kingsley’s cold looked bloodthirsty. “Tonight, we’ll go to M Underground Organization and flatten that place!”

Edward looked at Kingsley with his eyes narrowed. “Alright.”

To save Jeanne, the sooner the better.

With that, Edward followed Kingsley. However, the moment he entered the helicopter, Kingsley said bluntly, “You come alone.”

Edward was surprised.

He had brought very few people with him because his goal was to gain Kingsley’s trust. However, with so little manpower…

In the end, Edward turned around and said, “You guys can leave.”

The three subordinates could only be respectful of his orders.

After they left, a few figures appeared from the dark and quickly caught up with Kingsley.

Edward’s expression changed.

If he had not reached an agreement with Kingsley today, the latter would very likely have sent assassins to hide in the dark and kill them.

“The Hills have killed countless people. There’s no need to keep useless people alive.” Kingsley could tell that Edward could guess everything, so he said bluntly, “Jeanne got into trouble when she was by your side.”

To Kingsley, Edward was a useless person, and he would take revenge for Jeanne. Thus, Kingsley’s invitation today was not to work with Edward but to kill him.

If it were not for the fact that they had reached an agreement, or rather, if Kingsley did not think that he was not completely useless, Kingsley would not want to use him to deal with M Underground Organization.

Edward knew everything.

However, because their interests were the same, he would still go with Kingsley even if he knew Kingsley’s motives were not pure.

The helicopter quickly hovered over Harken and headed for their destination.

Everyone in the cabin was silent, except for Miles, who did not know Edward or the others.

Since Kingsley naturally would not introduce them, the entire journey was quiet.

The helicopter traveled for half an hour before arriving at South Hampton City Airport. The group of people entered Kingsley’s private plane and flew directly to the South Hampshire region where M Underground Organization was located. Their territory was on the border between Harken and other countries. They mainly relied on smuggling illegal goods to make a fortune, and because they were ambitious, they developed very quickly.

When they arrived in South Hampshire, they drove a few black cars and two large trucks. The trucks were filled with assassins trained by the Hills. There were no less than 40 people, and including the people in the cars, there were at least 50 people in the team. They all went straight to the base of M Underground Organization.

Edward, who was in the same car as Kingsley, said, “Let’s discuss our strategy.”

Kingsley turned to look at him.

“When we’re fighting against the enemy, someone must sneak in to rescue Jeanne first. Otherwise, Jeanne will be in danger.”

Kingsley had already made arrangements. “I’ve arranged for K01 to do that.”

Edward frowned as he was sure he did not see K01.

At that moment, the man in the front passenger seat turned around. “That’s me.”

Edward looked up.

It turned out that the face that was exposed to everyone previously was not K01’s true face.

However, Edward did not have the time to dwell on it. Hence, he said, “I’ll go with you.”

Kingsley looked at Edward coldly.

“I won’t be reassured with anyone else going,” Edward said.

“I’m not used to working with others.” Mason refused.

“We can split up.” Edward was determined to go with Mason.

Kingsley fell silent for a few seconds. “K01, give Fourth Master Swan the internal map of M Underground Organization.”

Mason’s expression darkened, but in the end, he passed a mini-map to Edward.

Edward took it and lowered his head to study it.

It was a map of M Underground Organization’s precise geographical distribution, and he could even see where the guards were. That could only mean that the Hills had long wanted to take action against M Underground Organization, but they lacked a good opportunity or a reasonable reason to do so.

Edward looked at it seriously.

“Do you need me to explain it to you?” Kingsley asked.

“No need.”

Kingsley nodded and said, “I’ll give you five minutes to memorize the key areas. After five minutes, return this map to K01. ”

Edward did not refuse and nodded.

He studied while memorizing it.

Five minutes later, the black car stopped, and Edward returned the map to K01.

Kingsley glanced at Edward and then gave K01 a look. Then, K01 opened the door and got out of the car.

Edward also opened the car door and got out.

At that moment, they had to part ways and work together from the inside. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After Edward and K01 got out of the car, the car left them, and K01 disappeared into the night.

With that, Edward picked a direction and left quickly.

A battle was about to break out.
