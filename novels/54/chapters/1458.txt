Chapter 1459: Tortured by Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Zoe was originally a little drunk, but because of what she had to do, she instantly sobered up.

When she returned to the private room, Cody was downing drink after drink with Nox, who did not reject him. In any case, he could drink with anyone.

Zoe also knew that Nox had a good tolerance for alcohol and liked to drink, but she had not seen him drink like that with outsiders in a long time. He would usually only indulge like that with Edward and Finn. It was rare for him to indulge himself like that when he was alone.

It felt as if Nox was deliberately getting drunk today, and he did not seem to be in a good mood. To be precise, Nox had been in a bad mood over the last few days. The two of them were talking about the wedding. Although he was the one who brought it up, she sometimes felt that he seemed passive about it.

Anyway, it was very strange. It made Zoe wonder if Nox also had a phobia of marriage but was just getting himself to overcome it.

She returned to Nox’s side and intimately pressed her entire body against Nox’s. Nox also took the opportunity to hug Zoe, making the two of them look very intimate.

Shelly, on the other hand, just looked at him indifferently. In fact, she felt pretty good.

In the beginning, she thought she would be a good person and let Nox know what kind of person Zoe was. Now, she suddenly found it quite satisfying to not be a good person.

She watched as Zoe played Nox like a fool. She even thought that if Nox found out one day, she would piss him off on purpose. Just thinking about that scene made her very happy.

“Waitress,” Zoe suddenly called out to her.

Shelly was a little distracted, and at that moment, she could not hide the smile on her face. Just the thought of certain scenes made her smile happily.

Nox, on the other hand, was glaring at her. He thought, ‘That woman is crazy. Why is she laughing out of the blue?’

Had she lost her mind because she was too shocked? Was he too intimate with Zoe that caused Shelly to be bewitched?

However, in the next second, he felt that he had nothing to do with Shelly. Why did her jealousy have to do with him? Why should he care about her feelings?

At that thought, he hugged Zoe tighter and even planted a kiss on Zoe’s face.

Feeling Nox’s affection for her tonight, Zoe was a little hesitant. Should she do it? Would she hurt Nox if she did that? No matter how she looked at the situation, she believed Nox loved her deeply.

As the two of them flirted in front of everyone, Zoe seemed to have forgotten that she was calling Shelly.

Shelly, on the other hand, was distracted and did not hear Zoe. Now, seeing the interaction between the two of them… Shelly’s smile became even more obvious.

She had always found the two of them to be a match made in heaven, so she had to resist the urge to be a good person and separate them.

The night deepened, but no one had the intention of leaving.

Shelly looked at the time. It was past 1 a.m. Every time she worked the night shift, it would seriously affect her sleep. How much longer were those people going to drink?

“Waitress,” Zoe suddenly called out to Shelly.

Shelly was not distracted this time. In fact, she was hoping those people would leave immediately.

Hence, she quickly went over and knelt on the ground. That was how they were supposed to treat their high-level VIPs. In such an expensive private room, all the waitresses would kneel as they served the customers.

Nox looked at Shelly’s humble behavior.

“Get me a glass of water,” Zoe ordered.

“Yes,” Shelly said respectfully.

She could not help but feel a little disappointed as she thought that Zoe would tell her to get the bill.

Nox, however, saw everything in her eyes. He could tell that Shelly was in a bad mood tonight, but he… had no obligation to care about how she felt.

After Shelly stood up and left, Nox continued to be intimate with Zoe and drank with the others. The atmosphere in the room was great.

Nox, probably having drank a little too much, leaned close to Zoe’s ear. “I’m going to the washroom.”

“I’ll go with you.”

“No need. I’m not drunk yet.”

“Um, alright.”

Nox stood up and walked out of the private room. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

There was a washroom in the room, but Zoe was not surprised to see Nox walk out. She assumed Nox was going to sober up. After all, he had drunk a lot tonight..
