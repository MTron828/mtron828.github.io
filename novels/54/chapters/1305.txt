1306 Drunk and Sleepy, Meeting Paige

Anyway, both of them… had unspeakable feelings.

There was a knock on the door.

Monica put down her phone and even forgot to hang up.

She thought that Finn would end the call too.

She quickly opened the door and saw that Brandon had appeared at the door with a glass of fruit juice.

“Won’t the waiter bring it over?”

“In order to make myself feel less guilty, I decided to come personally.”

Monica did not really care. It was normal for people to lose control when they were drunk.

“Give it to me,” Monica decided.

“It’s a little cold. Let me bring it in for you.”

“Okay, thanks.”

Brandon carefully placed the glass by Monica’s bedside. “There’s also aloe vera bits in the fruit juice. It’s good for your face. Drink up and go to bed early.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded. “You should rest early too.”

“See you tomorrow.”

“See you tomorrow.”

Brandon left.

Monica climbed onto the bed and drank her juice.

She did not realize that the phone on the bed was still on the line.

For an unsure amount of time, only then did he really hang up.

…

The next morning, Candice got out of bed.

She wondered what time it was. She was hit with the sudden need to faint again.

It was as if she had returned to the time when she had just regained consciousness. Everything was unfamiliar. Her memory was a clean slate.

She did not even know where or who she was.

“Are you awake?” A man’s voice suddenly sounded beside her ear.

Candice turned her head abruptly.

She saw a man in a dark blue housecoat smoking on the balcony outside the room.

She panicked.

It was the first time she had such huge emotional distress since she regained consciousness.

Why was she in the same room as Edward?!

Why was he here?!

She went to the nightclub with Monica last night and the two of them drank.

She could not handle the alcohol and was soon drunk.

She was slipping between two states of drunkenness and sobriety. She could still remember that she and Monica had gone to the stage to dance.

Though, she could no longer remember how long she was dancing.

She could not remember if she had danced or not.

How did she end up here when she woke up?!

She turned to look at Edward blankly.

She had no idea that she had blacked out after getting drunk.

If she had known, she would rather die than get drunk.

Edward saw her panic. He put out his cigarette and walked in from outside.

Candice was a little nervous. Her heart was racing. She even lowered her head to look at her clothes. Seeing that they were still the same clothes she had worn yesterday, she calmed down a little.

“If you’re awake, wash up and go downstairs for breakfast.” Edward did not approach her.

He was reminding her. He kept a distance from her and did not put her under too much pressure.

“Oh, okay.” Candice nodded.

She could not help but ask.

“Last night, I…”

“Quite well-behaved,” Edward replied.

She vaguely saw a smile in Edward’s eyes.

What did he mean? Well-behaved?!

How was she supposed to perceive his words?

“I’ll wait for you downstairs,” Edward said and left.

He left without giving her any answer.

Candice felt that this man could be very… bad at times!

...

Without delay, she lifted the blanket and got out of bed.

She still reeked of alcohol. She figured that it should not be a problem for her to take a shower and wash up.

She unzipped her dress and prepared to go to the bathroom.

“Oh right.” The person who had left outside the door suddenly walked back.

Candice’s back was open and her dress was hanging on her arm. In the next second, she might…

She suddenly turned around and hugged her clothes, staring straight at Edward, who had clearly left.

She watched as he suddenly came in and saw this scene.

He seemed to be stunned for a few seconds.

Slowly, he shifted his gaze.

Candice quickly ran into the bathroom.

Sometimes, the awkwardness between a man and a woman could be really… awkward.

...

“What I meant to say was that you could take a shower when you’re up. There are clean clothes in the bathroom,” Edward said.

“Alright.” Candice tried her best to remain calm.

That was what she planned to do.

“The clothes are all new,” Edward said again.

Candice paused. Did he tell her that to say that the clothes he prepared for her were not from his previous two wives?!

Candice did not know what to say. She took a deep breath and decided not to think too much.

She was about to marry Edward. The two of them would be skin-to-skin anyway, and sooner or later, she needed to accept Edward’s marriage history.

She quickly took a shower and changed her clothes. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The size of the clothes was really just right, even the inner wears were extremely accurate.

Candice was still a little shy at that moment.

She looked at herself in the mirror. It was rare for her to blush.

She could not help but look at her chest.

She was wondering, what kind of hurt did he suffer to make his heart so calm?

The moment she opened the bathroom door, Candice had already composed herself.

She walked out of the room as if she had the instinct to know which way to go and which way to go downstairs.

There was even an inexplicable sense of familiarity.

It was as if she had… been here before.

It must be an illusion.

She had checked that before this, she had no interaction with Edward at all.

She walked to the staircase and saw Edward holding a little girl at the dining table from afar. He seemed to be feeding her breakfast.

This was the first time she had seen Edward looking so homey.

What she saw on the news and television was him in a suit and leather shoes with a serious expression.

She glanced at the little girl in his arms as she could not see her face with his head lowered.

For some reason, she had the urge to see what she looked like.

She was rarely interested in anything but right now, she could not even control herself.

She walked over and looked at Edward and the little girl’s closeness.

The little girl seemed to have sensed someone approaching. She raised her head and looked at her.

“Mommy.” A clear, melodious, childish voice resounded in the hall.

Candice was lost for words. She felt that her world seemed to have changed.

She could clearly feel her heart. It was beating like mad.
