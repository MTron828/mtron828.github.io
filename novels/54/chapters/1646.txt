Chapter 1647: Nox’s Heartfelt Confession

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox’s accusation made Shelly hold her tongue.

Although Nox had a point, she disagreed. However, since she did not want to waste time talking nonsense with Nox, she chose to remain silent.

Seeing that Shelly remained quiet for a long time, Nox was so angry that his lungs were about to explode. He felt that if he died one day, it would definitely be because of Shelly.

He said, “Shelly, believe it or not, I’ll sue you for intentional assault!”

“Go ahead.” Shelly was very calm about it.

It had crossed her mind that Nox would do that, and that was why she looked calm.

On the contrary, when Nox heard Shelly’s words, he was so angry that he almost jumped up from the bed. He said fiercely, “Don’t think I’m scaring you!”

“I don’t think you’re scaring me!” Shelly said bluntly, ‘When have you ever shown mercy to me?”

Nox’s heart suddenly ached. It was as if something had hit him.

“If you want to sue me, go ahead. I don’t care. Anyway, I was the one who injured you,” Shelly said calmly.

Nox looked straight at Shelly and glared at her fiercely. For a second, Shelly felt that Nox really wanted to strangle her.

Then, she heard Nox say through gritted teeth, “Is it so difficult for you to show weakness to me?”

Shelly’s eyes flickered. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Will it kill you to beg me?” Nox broke down.

He just wanted Shelly to be a little more proactive and less resistant to him. Why was it so difficult? Why was it so difficult for Shelly to give him a way out so that he can say they could be together again?

“Is there any use in begging you?” Shelly asked.

She felt that she would be making a fool of herself if she begged Nox. She knew very well how much Nox hated her, so she did not want to waste her feelings on Nox. It was useless.

“How do you know it’s useless if you haven’t tried it?” Nox asked her fiercely.

He did not know how clear he had to make himself for that woman to understand what he meant.

Shelly looked at Nox. For a second, she really believed that Nox would let her go.

“Hurry up!” Nox urged.

He was losing his patience. Besides, he also felt like a coward for forcing her to beg him. He could not believe he had to teach Shelly how to ask for his forgiveness after she beat him up. In this world, there was no one more tragic than him!

“I’m sorry.” Shelly suddenly compromised.

She believed Nox. After all, if there was no need to go to jail, no one would be willing to go to jail. Besides, if she went to jail, what would happen to Bella?

Therefore, she apologized and said, “Please don’t sue me.”

Nox looked at Shelly, who had finally relented, and said, “If you treat me better, I won’t sue you.”

Shelly frowned.

“For the two days I’ll be hospitalized, shouldn’t you at least stay with me and take care of me? Besides, you can’t afford for me to stay in a high-class ward, and no one is here to take care of me. Shouldn’t you take care of me?” Nox was angry again because of Shelly’s expression.

“Alright.” Shelly agreed.

It was because she found Nox’s request reasonable. After all, without anyone to take care of him, a young master like Nox would not be able to not take care of himself.

After getting Shelly’s agreement, Nox’s bad temper suddenly subsided, and he seemed to be in a good mood.

“I’ll call to make arrangements for Bella first, ” Shelly said.

Without Nox’s permission, she left the ward with her phone and gave Benjamin a call.

Benjamin quickly picked up the call and asked with concern, “Shelly, how is Nox?”

“He’s not dead. It’s just some superficial injuries. However, the doctor is afraid he’d have a concussion, so he wants Nox to stay in the hospital for a day for observation. While I take care of him in the hospital for a day, can you help me take care of Bella?”

“Sure, but if you’re with Nox…” Benjamin voiced his worries

“It’s fine. I’ll protect myself.”

“I’m sorry.” Benjamin suddenly apologized.

Shelly’s heart ached. She actually knew what Benjamin meant by his apology — he was blaming himself for not having the power to protect her.

“It’s not your fault, and it has nothing to do with you.” Shelly said seriously,

“Don’t overthink it.”

“I really hope that one day, I can protect you from any harm,” Benjamin said with some discomfort.

Shelly smiled..
