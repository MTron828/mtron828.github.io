“In addition, Bella’s bedtime is before 8:30 pm. It’s fine if you don’t bathe Bella tomorrow since I’ll be doing it tonight. However, you’ll have to wash her face and feet and remind Bella to brush her teeth. She always forgets.”

“Alright.” Nox nodded.

“Bella listens to bedtime stories before she goes to bed and usually falls asleep before the story finishes. You can find many fairy tale books in her room.”

“Got it.’

“Shelly, you’re only leaving for a night, not a month. There’s no need to explain so much,” Nox interrupted her.

It seemed as though Shelly would never stop nagging.

After all, he had watched Shelly do it so many times every day that he could recite the process of coaxing Bella to sleep.

Sensing Nox’s impatience, Shelly said nothing more.

She lowered her head to look at the time before saying, “Bella, it’s time for your shower.”

Though Bella was a little reluctant to part, she still got off the sofa and followed Shelly to her room.

As per schedule, Shelly first bathed Bella, told her a bedtime story, then coaxed Bella to sleep before 8:30 pm.

After gently closing the door for Bella, Shelly went straight back to her room.

She did not even greet Nox, who was still on the sofa.

Nox watched as Shelly left, feeling extremely bitter.

Shelly probably would not care about his existence for the rest of her life.

He put down his phone and followed her into the room.

‘Since she would not see him, he would try to make his presence known in front of her,’ Nox thought.

Inside the room, Shelly had already started showering.

Through the matte glass door of the bathroom, he could vaguely see a figure inside.

Nox suddenly took off his clothes and went in. After all, he was not someone reserved and would not hide his desire.

Pondering the fact that it was the last month, he would sleep with her as many times as he could in case he would not be able to in the future.

Shelly did not expect Nox to come in just like that and quickly covered her body in shock.

Nox laughed.

What was there to be shy about?

“Nox, what are you doing here?!” “What do you think?”

“Can’t you wait for me to finish?” “It saves time to shower together.”

“Are you in a hurry?”

“Yes.”

“Are you going out tonight?”

“Nope.”

“Then why are you in a hurry?” Shelly was a little angry. “I don’t want to waste even a second with you.” Shelly was speechless.

How could Nox say such mushy words?

“Shelly, I…” Nox pursed his lips, the words about to come out of his mouth remaining unspoken.

Since he probably would not be able to say “I love you” again, he decided to express it through his actions.

Shelly was used to Nox’s surprise. So, even if it was her first time, she still accepted it!

It was late at night.

Shelly lay on the bed, paralyzed. Did Nox take something today?!

It was endless. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Until now, she still did not want to move her toes, only to stay there quietly.

Nox, who was beside her, had fallen asleep. Satisfied, he slept soundly.

She sighed softly.

Suddenly, she remembered that she only had a month left with Nox.

However, Nox was still able to act as if nothing had happened. He did not even have the slightest bit of anxiety or reluctance.

Sometimes, she really could not understand Nox. If he really loved her, he would not be able to be so carefree and unrestrained!

Shelly turned over with difficulty and fell asleep with her back to Nox.

She did not know how long it had been before she seemingly fell asleep. In her dreams, she felt a warm body hug her tightly. Obviously, he did not want to be apart for even a second.

When she woke up the next day, Nox was no longer in bed.

Usually, she would wake first.

However, she was too tired last night and overslept.

As she got up, her entire body was sore and weak.

Nox had been too extreme last night, and it took Shelly a long time to get up and walk into the bathroom to wash up.

When she opened the door, she saw Nox playing with Bella in the living room.

In the past, Bella would not wake up so early. She was the one who took the initiative to wake her and send her to kindergarten..
