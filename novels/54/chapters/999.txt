1000 Monica’s First Victory, Michael’s First Defeat

“The leader just called me and told me to sort this matter out. If I can’t resolve it, I’ll have to die.” Michael said, “If I die, you won’t live either. There are many people involved in this matter. As long as I am brought to justice, the Sanders will root out those in the quality inspection department! The quality inspection department’s quality inspectors that we bribed, as well as you and Daniel, will all suffer.

“Based on the current situation, I can’t avoid the death penalty. As the primary accomplice, you will either be sentenced to life imprisonment or a suspended death sentence. Instead of us dying together, I’ve thought of a way to get the best of both worlds.”

Brie still did not say anything.

If Jeanne had not come to look for her earlier, she might really believe him.

She heard Michael say, “My idea is that you should take the blame for this. You have the motive to take revenge on Monica and the ability to fabricate the incident to frame her. Once you’re determined to be the instigator of this incident, I can clear my name.”

“So, I should die in your place.” Brie sneered.

“I won’t let you die,” Michael replied firmly.

Brie looked at him coldly.

“Before your crimes are exposed, I’ll send you abroad secretly to take refuge. After I settle Cardellini Pharmaceutical and stabilize my power in the Sanders, I will find a way to bring you back.”

“I’m a sinner. Can I still return to Harken?” Brie asked him.

“As long as I still have power, I can think of a way. But even if I can’t think of a way, at the very least, you can stay abroad, and I’ll come over to accompany you regularly.” Michael revealed his plan.

Brie looked at him. “Then, what am I?”

“What do you want?” Michael enunciated each word clearly.

“The identity of your wife.”

“Alright,” Michael agreed immediately.

It was so straightforward that Brie could not believe it.

Michael was just trying to trick her.

“You don’t want Monica anymore?” However, she still could not help but ask.

“Do you think I still have feelings for Monica? I’ll only torture her to death!” The viciousness in Michael’s eyes was definitely not an act.

Monica had probably provoked Michael. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

If Michael was provoked, he could be so cruel that he would not even recognize his friends and family!

“Alright.” Brie nodded. “I promise you, but I’m very curious how you can make me the initiator of this incident! No matter how much power I have, I can’t bribe the director of the quality inspection department to listen to my arrangements.”

“You can.” Michael said, “As long as you fake an affair with Daniel, the head of the quality inspection department, he will be threatened by you and have to help you with your work.”

Brie just stared at Michael, admiring his ability.

She was truly impressed because he could think of anything. However, at the same time, she was afraid of his cruelty.

In order to achieve his goal, he could use any means, including disregarding her image!

“Will Daniel agree to help you cover up your crime?” Brie suppressed all the pain in her heart and asked him.

“He’s a smart person. He knew very well that regardless of whether he did it or not, the punishment he would receive would be the same. He would still be an accomplice, and that fact would not change! But if I still have power, at least after he’s sentenced, I can find a way to reduce his punishment, and he can leave himself an out,” Michael said logically.

It made people have no choice but to be convinced.

“Brie,” Michael called out to her.

It was probably the first time in her life that she had heard him speak with emotion.

“I know this will make you feel wronged, but this is indeed the best way to protect the two of us. I don’t want to die, and I believe you don’t want to stay in prison for the rest of your life either. We can still achieve great things, and I promise that I’ll never abandon you when I’m successful. I’ll definitely remember everything you’ve done for me today,” Michael said affectionately.

Everything was clear to Brie, but she was emotionless at the moment. She said indifferently, “I have one more request.”

She promise him to take the blame, but she had a request.

“Go ahead,” Michael looked like he would agree to anything she said.

“Kill Monica,” Brie said.

Michael’s expression stiffened.
