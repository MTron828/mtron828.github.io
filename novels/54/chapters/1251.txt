1252 Nox’s Accusation Against Jeanne

Monica rushed out with a bag in her hand.

She had a lunch appointment today. Although she still had time to spare, at some point, she had become more strict about being on time. She absolutely could not be late and allowed herself to delay the meeting!

In fact, she was also thinking about whether becoming such a career-focused, independent, and self-disciplined woman was what she wanted.

After thinking about it, whether she wanted it or did not matter anymore and she had no other choice.

Her only obsession now was to live well and for her family to live well.

…

When Nox returned home, he suddenly felt a little empty and lonely.

Regardless of Edward and Finn’s respective relationship, at least they had a relationship. However, he was still alone. No matter what, he felt that something was missing.

Could it be that he had reached a certain age and really wanted to settle down with a woman?

At that moment, Shelley’s face appeared in his mind.

The moment he thought of Shelley, Nox quivered. His entire body was covered in cold sweat.

Even if he wanted to find a woman to settle down with, it would have to be a lady from upper-class society with a beautiful and enchanting figure. It definitely could not be Shelley!

He had to admit that he already despised Shelley the first day she entered the house. It was a deep-rooted dislike. He despised her for being ugly, for being uncouth, and for making his friends laugh at him because of her.

In this life, he would marry anyone but Shelley. However, he had made a bet with his grandfather that he could not have a woman for a year. It had only been a few months, but he felt that he could not hold on any longer.

What made him break down even more was that he had a wet dream a few days ago! When he woke up in the morning, he realized that his boxer was wet.

One had to know that from the first time he slept with a woman, he had never had one again! Yet now, because of Shelley, he had to go through such a traumatizing experience again.

He gritted his teeth. At that moment, he had inexplicably vented all his anger on Shelley.

If not for that woman, would he have to live such a miserable life? If not for that woman, he would be surrounded by beautiful women now, waiting on him.

With that thought in mind, Nox immediately dialed Shelley’s number. “Where are you?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I’m at school.” When Shelley received the call, she really thought that Nox was going crazy again.

“What school? Come back immediately! I have something to tell you!” Nox roared.

After that, he hung up the phone.

Shelley looked at the words “call ended” and held her emotions in.

It happened to be a break between classes, and she was solving a math problem when she was interrupted halfway through.

She packed up her homework and prepared to leave.

“Shelley.” A boy sitting at the same table suddenly called out to her.

Shelley turned around. “What?”

“Don’t you think you’re living a lowly life?” The boy mocked.

“That’s my business. It has nothing to do with you!”

“I’ve heard people talk about Nox. They say he’s a playboy and that he gets horny when he sees a woman. Seeing how you’re in such a hurry now, are you planning to solve his sexual desire?” the boy said sarcastically, deliberately using unpleasant words to mock her.

Shelley looked at him coldly.

The boy lowered his head and did his homework. It was as if what he just said was a joke, and he looked very calm.

He continued, “A woman should always strive for self-improvement. If I were you, I would choose to study hard and get into a good university. I would rely on my own ability to survive but not on a man and live such a cheap life!”

“Swish!” Shelley threw a stack of books at the boy’s head.

The sudden sound caused a stir in the class, and everyone looked at them in unison.

The boy was naturally a little angry. “Are you crazy?”

Shelley did not waste her breath with the boy and started fighting with him.

The boy’s eyes turned red in anger from Shelley’s beating, and he started fighting with Shelley, not caring about the rule that a man should not fight with a woman.

The teacher was alarmed, and naturally, his parents were also alarmed!
