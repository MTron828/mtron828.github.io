1159 Edward, I’m Pregnant

The others were also shocked by this news.

This was big news. Breaking news.

There had already been rumors that Edward and Jeanne were not on good terms and were rarely seen in the same frame. No news of Jeanne had emerged for a long time either. There was even talk that Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan had been living separately for a long time. However, now, it was suddenly revealed that Jeanne was pregnant. If this was not considered explosive news, what was?

“I’ll let everyone know when I have good news.” Jeanne played dumb.

“Do you also believe Fourth Master did not have any illegal dealings with other countries?”

“I believe in him,” Jeanne said with certainty.

“Are you unhappy with your father’s imprisonment of Edward?”

“I have the same opinion as Edward. What my father did was naturally what he should do as the leader. He would not be worthy of the title of King if he played favorites. Most importantly, this was the only way to prove Edward’s innocence. I don’t want Edward to be misunderstood!” Jeanne defended the Sanders and Edward at the same time.

Her answer was textbook, and the reporters could not find any fault.

“Third Miss...”

“Thank you, everyone, for your concern for Edward and me. It’s getting late, and we have to leave. Excuse me.” Jeanne stopped the reporter from asking any questions. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She held Edward’s hand affectionately and left through the special passageway.

The moment she left, Jeanne suddenly covered her mouth.

It was a nauseating action.

The camera’s flash continuously captured this wonderful moment.

It had been confirmed. She was pregnant.

Edward and Jeanne left in a car together. As it drove onto the wide street, no one took the initiative to speak, and it was extremely quiet.

Everything that had just been shown to the outside world seemed to be an illusion. In private, where no one could see, they instantly returned to their real mode of getting along.

“Where are we going?” Edward asked Jeanne.

“To the Sanders’ mansion,” Jeanne replied.

“That’s not how you negotiated with me yesterday.” Edward’s eyes turned cold.

“Yes. I broke my promise.”

Edward looked at her.

“If you tell me who Alex is, I might let you go.” Jeanne returned his gaze.

Edward chose to remain silent, and the car fell into silence again.

“There’s a car following us,” Mason, who was driving, suddenly said.

Jeanne glanced behind her.

It was not just one. Of course, Jeanne would not be the only one traveling with him.

“Your people?” Jeanne asked.

“Nox,” Edward replied.

Nox left the prison first. He should be here to pick him up now.

Jeanne suddenly stepped forward and grabbed Edward’s hand.

Edward’s fingers twitched. He looked at Jeanne, who suddenly moved closer to him.

“Jeanne, you can come with me.” Edward pushed her away. “I can’t go with you, though.”

She had been rejected.

Now that she had thought it through, it was useless to use the honey trap.

While Edward could not let her go, he would not lose his mind for her. If he did, they would not be at odds with each other like this.

That was why she had never thought that her honey trap would work. It was just a cover for Warren.

Of course, she had another way to try and make Edward stay. She said, “Edward, I really am pregnant.”

Edward was stunned.

“How?” He asked.

They were away more than they were together. It had been so long since they had slept together that he had forgotten the last time they had done it.

“Monica and Michael’s wedding,” Jeanne reminded him.

Edward pursed his lips.

They had not been safe.

Edward unconsciously clenched his fists.

“It’s been three months,” Jeanne said.

Edward was silent for a long time.

“I won’t let you go. I promised Warren that I would use you to threaten the Duncans. That’s why I have to make you stay. While I can’t guarantee that I can beat you or the people Warren gave me could go up against Nox’s people, I will use my life and the baby’s life as the stakes!”

Edward’s cold face turned dark.

Jeanne did not wait for Edward’s reply. Instead, she instructed Mason, “Get rid of the cars behind us as fast as you can.”
