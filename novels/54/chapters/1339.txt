1340 Let’s Break Up, Finn

Monica brought Brandon to the hospital.

The doctor examined Brandon. After confirming that it was only a superficial wound, Monica heaved a sigh of relief.

Then, she saw that Brandon was still feeling very uncomfortable because he was drunk, so he asked the doctor to give him some water to ease his drunkenness.

She stayed in the hospital to accompany Brandon.

Brandon had been vomiting all night. When he finally felt better, it was already past four in the morning. By then, Brandon had already fallen asleep.

Monica stared at Brandon. Slowly, she got up and left the ward.

There was a nurse in the room. Monica left after giving a few instructions.

She walked out of the hospital and took a long time to finally get a taxi.

Then… it hit her that she had nowhere to go.

Would it be strange for her to pack her things the moment she returned to Finn’s house?

Where was she going after packing her things?!

Back to her parents?!

She was afraid that she would scare her parents to death so early in the morning.

“Miss, where are you going?” The taxi driver asked.

Monica looked at the deserted street and had zero clue where she should go.

She had no friends, and now no lover either.

She did not want to worry her family.

How had she been living her life all these while?

She picked up the phone and dialed a number. “Sarah.”

This was the only person she could think of who still could be of use.

Sarah was in a daze. “Cousin, are you possessed?!”

“I’m coming to your house now.”

“I—”

Monica had already hung up. Then, she gave the driver the address.

Sarah was in her third year of university and was studying nursing. She still chose nursing, even though she had given up on Finn.

Since her third year in university, Sarah had been interning in the hospital. Because of this, she felt that she was an adult and insisted on moving out to live by herself. Therefore, now that she was living in a high-class bachelor pad, she could still put up with Monica for half a day. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The driver quickly arrived at the entrance of Sarah’s neighborhood. Monica paid and walked in. She then knocked on Sarah’s door.

Sarah looked at her in her pajamas. “I thought you were sleepwalking. You’re really here.”

Sarah was surprised.

“Mm,” Monica replied.

She did not offer any explanation. Even so, Sarah knew what was wrong with her cousin. She asked straightforwardly, “Did you and Finn quarrel?”

It was not an argument, and neither would they quarrel.

It was just a matter of time.

However, she did not want to tell Sarah more. Sarah was chattering non-stop, and it was rare for Monica to answer her questions anyway.

Monica said bluntly, “Help me find a set of pajamas. I’m going to take a shower.”

Sarah endured it. She returned to her room to get a set of pajamas for Monica. When she came out, she could not help but ask, “Monica, what happened between you and Finn? What did he do to you, or what did you do to him?”

Obviously, Sarah was not so easy to fool.

“Nothing.” Monica took Sarah’s pajamas and prepared to go to the bathroom.

“Monica…”

In another room of the apartment, the door was suddenly opened.

Although it was an apartment for one, the place was huge. Back then, it was Ruby who chose it for Sarah. She was afraid that it would not be good for her to stay alone, so she chose the best boutique apartment in South Hampton. The place was more than a thousand four hundred square feet.

Monica looked at the woman in the room for a long time.

“Monica.” The woman smiled and called her.

Monica scrutinized her for a while. “Sherry?”

“Uh, yes.” Sherry nodded.

“Why are you here?” Monica was a little surprised.

“I don’t have a place to stay for the time being. Coincidentally, I bumped into Sarah at the hospital that day, so Sarah asked me to stay with her. She said that she was staying alone, so I came over.”

“Where have you been all these years?” Monica could not help but ask, “Have you not returned to the Winter family?”

“No,” Sherry said. “I took a sum of money from Nox and promised him that I wouldn’t go back.”

“That damn Nox.”

“Actually, it doesn’t matter. If I return to the Winter family, I’ll be in an awkward position.”

“I think the Winter family treats you like a daughter too,” Monica said bluntly.

“But in the end, I’m not,” Sherry said calmly, neither haughty nor humble.

It was as if she had really let go.

...

“Based on my understanding of Nox, he probably gave you money to make up for his guilt toward you, not to make you leave the Winter family.” Monica still knew what kind of person Nox was. “So, even if you go back to the Winter family now, Nox won’t do anything.”

“I didn’t do anything to deserve it,” Sherry said calmly. “Previously, I came to the Winter family to be their daughter-in-law. Now that I can’t be that, I don’t have any value in the Winter family. I don’t want to. After taking advantage of the Winter family so much, I feel uneasy.”

It was her inner uneasiness. Or… because she was injured and did not want to go back.

Either way, Monica would not expose her either.

That was enough.

She said, “I’m disturbing your rest. Go back to sleep. It’s still early.”

“I’m not disturbing you. I’m about to get up,” Sherry quickly said.

“Why are you up so early?! Is it such a tough time studying in university nowadays?”

“I’m not going to university,” Sherry explained. “I’ll be heading to work.”

“What?!” Monica was a little surprised.

“I didn’t go to college.”

...

“Weren’t your results very good?” Monica could not believe it.

Back then, she heard from Sarah that Sherry’s grades were one of the best in school.

“I didn’t take the college entrance examination back then. Later on, I wanted to repeat for a year, but… Anyway, all roads lead to Rome,” Sherry said. “There’s nothing wrong with getting into society earlier.”

“Then what kind of work are you doing now?” Monica frowned.

“I’ll do anything,” Sherry said. “I’ll do anything to earn money!”

Monica wanted to ask something else. Suddenly, she saw a little girl walking out of Sherry’s room.

She rubbed her sleepy eyes and looked like she was still half-asleep.

She hugged Sherry and Sherry picked her up and coaxed her gently. It was obvious that she was telling her to sleep.

Monica was really stunned at this moment.

Her eyes widened. “Don’t tell me it’s Nox’s?!”

The little girl looked like she was two or three years old. That was when Sherry was taking care of Nox…

Sherry could not help but laugh. “Why would I?! I can’t afford to act like Cinderella, running away from the ball and whatnot.”
