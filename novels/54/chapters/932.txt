933 Monica Enters the Company, Unexpectedly Domineering

Monica stood at the door of Finn’s office for a few seconds.

Seeing that Finn had already sat down at his desk very naturally, she walked over and then sat in the chair opposite his desk.

“What’s the matter?” Finn asked while facing the computer and typing on the keyboard with his slender fingers.

“Now that my father is awake, does that mean that he’s no longer in critical condition?” Monica asked.

“No,” Finn said bluntly.

Monica looked at him nervously.

Finn lifted both his hands off the keyboard and turned his chair to look at her. “Your father’s condition isn’t great right now. Usually, when a heart attack relapses, especially after a heart bypass surgery, the aftereffects will be very obvious. He might be staying in the hospital for observation, but if he doesn’t reach the physical standards of a normal person during the observation period, I’ll suggest that he undergo a heart transplant.”

“What?” Monica did not expect it to be so serious.

She had always thought that her father was out of critical condition now that he was awake and had recovered.

Yet now, Finn was suddenly talking about a heart transplant.

“I’ve started contacting heart donors for your father. Just in case, I’ll prepare them in advance.”

“Is it that serious?” Monica’s eyes reddened again. “But he just told me to call his assistant to the hospital to deal with work matters. I thought he had recovered quite a bit.”

“Maybe he just doesn’t want you to worry too much. Let’s put it this way. If one of the tubes inserted into your father’s body is not there, your dad will most likely die.”

Monica stared at Finn with her mouth agape. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“But fortunately, your father is awake now, and at least there’s no risk of him being in a vegetative state. I just did a basic body screening for your father, and we can rule out the possibility of paralysis for the time being. The only thing we can monitor is your father’s recovery. If he doesn’t recover well, I’ll suggest a heart transplant.”

“Is the risk high?” Monica asked.

“According to the current medical standards of our country, it’s relatively high.”

Monica’s heart ached.

Finn continued, “Based on my experience, apart from external stimuli, the biggest possibility of your dad’s heart attack this time is that he overworked himself, which is the biggest no-no for people with weak hearts. I’ve reminded your father many times, but he doesn’t seem to take it to heart.”

“About my dad telling me to call his personal assistant over, should I still do that?” Monica asked.

“From a doctor’s point of view, I suggest not.” Finn said, “Your father’s current situation is caused by overworking, and he’s currently in recovery period. What he needs the most is to recuperate. If he’s tired again or suffers any stimulation, I can’t guarantee that nothing will happen to him.”

“In that case, what should we do? The company seems to be facing a lot of problems now,” Monica said worriedly.

Seeing that her father had been telling her to look for his assistant, it was definitely not a small matter.

Finn did not answer her. Other than her father’s illness, nothing else was within his jurisdiction.

Monica knew that too, but she was at a lost as to what to do.

She just hoped that someone could give her some advice.

She watched as Finn turned his attention back to his computer screen. Their conversation was over after he explained her father’s situation to her in a business-like manner.

Monica knew that she should not have any expectations for Finn either.

She then stood up from the office chair opposite Finn and said gratefully, “Thank you.”

They had become so polite to each other.

With that, Monica turned around and left.

Finn raised his head and looked at her back.

The moment she pulled open the door and was about to go out, Finn suddenly said, “If I were you, I would be thinking about how to help your father solve his current problems instead of asking others what you should do!”

Monica turned around and looked at him.

In fact, she knew that too, but she was not capable enough.

She did not know anything and was a complete fool. What could she do to help her father?

“As a doctor, I have to be responsible for my patients, so I don’t want anything bad to happen to him and disturb his recovery.”

“Are you saying you don’t my dad to interfere in any work matters?” Monica asked him.
