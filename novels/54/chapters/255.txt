Chapter 256: Staying Alive

“Didn’t your dad tell you who I am?!” Jeanne asked Melody coldly.

Melody was stunned.

She looked at Jeanne fiercely.

Her heart suddenly trembled.

‘What does she mean by that?!

‘What does she mean by who she is?!

‘She’s just a lowly commoner!

‘Who could she be?!’

Even so, Melody’s dad had indeed sternly told her not to go against Jeanne.

She had always thought that her dad only wanted her to not bring trouble to the Sanders. She had never considered what kind of status Jeanne would have.

At most, Jeanne was only a little lucky and worked hard such that she had some achievements abroad before coming home to develop.

‘Isn’t she just the daughter of a business? What status could she have?!’

Melody’s eyes were fixed on Jeanne.

She looked at her with a cold smile.

‘No.

‘Jeanne is a very smart woman.

‘She’s threatening me on purpose.

‘She must’ve thought that if she used her privilege to target me, Dad would definitely control me. She must’ve said those words to deliberately disrupt my thoughts.

‘How ridiculous.

‘Am I, Melody, so easily convinced by others?!’

Melody suddenly fiercely slapped Jeanne’s face.

She used all her strength.

Jeanne’s cheeks instantly had a few red finger marks. Even the corner of her mouth was scratched by the friction against her teeth.

Jeanne did not cry out.

She just looked at Melody coldly.

She was cold and gave off a vicious aura.

At this moment, she looked a little scary.

Even so, Melody did not care.

To her, Jeanne was now a waste. She could do whatever she wanted to her.

She said sinisterly, “Jeanne, do you think that I’ll be threatened by you? Do you think that I’ll listen to a single word from you?! At this point, even if you’re somebody, you’ll only die! Once you die, go ahead and tell the king of hell who you are!”

Jeanne’s eyes were cold.

She knew that Melody had reached the point where she would not listen to anything she said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne knew that Melody would make her die a tragic death even if she had to sacrifice herself.

She looked at Melody coldly.

Jeanne did not know how long she had been unconscious.

Nonetheless, given that they moved from the outskirts to another place, it was obvious that this was not a random place. They must have taken some time to find this place!

Such a long time had passed.

She did not know how long it would take for Fourth Master Swan and the others to find her!

Or…

She would not make herself despair.

Until the last moment, she would not make herself despair.

“Jeanne,” Melody called out to her coldly. At this moment, her smile was very ferocious, “Let my subordinates have a good time first. After that, I’ll ruin your face. Then, I’ll cut your throat and let you bleed to death. Finally, I’ll throw your naked body onto the most luxurious street in the city so that everyone can see your enchanting body but miserable face. What do you think?!”

Jeanne gritted her teeth and looked at Melody.

No matter how calm she was, she was enraged at this moment.

How could a person…?

How could a woman be so cruel to this extent?

Melody was very satisfied with Jeanne’s reaction.

She just wanted to see Jeanne angry but was unable to resist.

She wanted to let Jeanne experience what it meant to live a life worse than death before she died!

Her eyes moved as she said, “All of you, do it together!”

As Melody finished, Jeanne felt the clothes on her body being torn apart.

She was wearing an evening gown.

It was very thin, to begin with.

The gown was torn into two halves, leaving only the nude undergarments on Jeanne’s body.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At this time, an astonishing power suddenly erupted from within her.

The two burly men who were originally seizing her were suddenly pushed away.

At this moment, she instantly started fighting with the people in front of her.

Jeanne’s combat power that erupted at her limits stunned the few bodyguards in front of her.

They probably did not expect that she could still fight given that she had such serious injuries.

Melody was also a little surprised.

She stood a little far away.

She looked at Jeanne from afar and watched as she suddenly broke free from her shackles even though she was still surrounded by her men.

Melody’s eyes narrowed.

‘This woman is really not simple.’

She gave an order, “Beat her up and beat her to death. Just make sure that she still has her last breath so that you can have fun with her before she dies!”

Once she finished, the eight bodyguards in front of her attacked Jeanne together.

Only two of Melody’s personal bodyguards stayed by her side.
