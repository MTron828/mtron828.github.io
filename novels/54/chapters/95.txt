Chapter 96: A Small Victory

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Forrest Jackson was stunned.

He clearly remembered that when they decided on the proposal, it was 2 billion yuan. He thought that they would definitely lose, so he did not expect it to turn around like this.

The reversal was extremely satisfying.

None of Cameron Hall’s arrogance remained when he left.

It was the first time Forrest felt overjoyed at having witnessed such a scene. It was a slap in Cameron’s face.

Forrest followed Jeanne into the car.

He could not help but ask, “When did Team Leader Lawrence change the investment amount?”

“Before I came here.”

“Did you know that our proposal was stolen?”

It was obvious that Cameron Hall had copied their proposal. Who the hell would believe Cameron Hall’s lies?

“It was just a hunch,” Jeanne Lawrence said indifferently.

When Cameron Hall left, the grown man had almost cried.

“By the way, is there a mole in our project team?”

“I believe so.”

“Who is it?”

“I don’t know yet. But I’ll find out sooner or later.”

“But why did they give the proposal to Cameron Hall? Cameron Hall owns a small company. How could he have the guts to go toe to toe with Lawrence Enterprise?”

No matter how bad the Lawrence Enterprise’s financials have been in recent years, it was still one of the twelve family enterprises in Harken. There was a huge gap between its status and assets compared to an ordinary enterprise.

“Someone must be backing him, of course.”

“Who?” Forrest Jackson asked nervously.

“It’s someone who doesn’t want me to do well in the company.” She knew this person very well.

Forrest Jackson thought about it and blurted out, “Could it be… Deputy Director Lawrence?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Yes.” Jeanne Lawrence gave an affirmative answer.

Forrest Jackson was her first confidant. There was no need for her to hide anything from him.

“What the f*ck?” Forrest Jackson could not help but exclaim, “Isn’t the Lawrence Enterprise your family’s business? Deputy Director Lawrence actually used such despicable means to oust you. If it really succeeds, how much money will Lawrence Enterprise have lost?”

Jeanne sneered.

Joshua was indeed that stupid.

“However, based on my understanding of Deputy Director Lawrence, he doesn’t seem to have access to external resources. Plus, he doesn’t know how to socialize. It’s impossible for him to have known someone like Cameron Hall.” Forrest Jackson was puzzled.

Jeanne smiled again.

There was someone backing Joshua Lawrence.

That person… was most likely Eden Swan!

She wondered if she was blind to have fallen in love with such a dark and vengeful man!

…

After Cameron Hall left West’s hotel, he hurriedly called Eden Swan.

Eden Swan tightened his grip on his phone, his expression turned dark.

How did he fail?

He gritted his teeth. “I told you to record the entire negotiation process. Did you?”

“Yes, Mr. Swan. I’ll send it to you now,” Cameron Hall said hurriedly.

Eden Swan hung up.

He had never thought that this matter would fail. He only had Cameron Hall record the meeting as he was afraid that Jeanne Lawrence and West would pull something underhanded behind the scenes. If there was, he would release the recording. He also wanted to hear Jeanne Lawrence breakdown with his own ears.

In fact, he even imagined how happy he would be.

He gritted his teeth and clicked on the recording and listened to the recorded conversation.

Everything Cameron Hall did was according to his request. There was no mistake. The negotiation process was not a failure, nor was there any underhanded manipulation. In the end, it was only because of the investment amount.

2 billion yuan?! How did it suddenly become 2 billion yuan?!

Had he been fooled by Jeanne Lawrence?

He could not accept it!
