Chapter 153: Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne Are Official?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the streets with heavy traffic.

Jeanne’s crazy racing had caused the cars on the streets to be constantly in danger.

She looked at the intersection in front of her.

She gritted her teeth.

She suddenly turned her steering wheel, and the sound of the car drifting could be heard. It was extremely ear-piercing.

She quickly rushed towards East Street.

Cars from all directions rushed toward her.

She held the steering wheel tightly with both hands and concentrated.

The only thing she was glad about was that the other party did not tamper with her car. They were not that smart, after all. Or perhaps, they did not expect her to have such strong control over the car.

Otherwise.

She would definitely be dead by now.

She remained calm throughout the whole process and saw a familiar black car from afar.

The car was parked there with Fourth Master Swan standing beside it.

He... was indeed there.

At that second, Jeanne felt a sense of relief.

After a thrilling moment, she suddenly felt calm.

Her eyes narrowed.

She stepped on the brakes and fiercely stopped beside the black car, stopping beside Fourth Master Swan’s feet. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She took a deep breath.

The car door was opened by Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne adjusted her seatbelt.

Fourth Master Swan directly carried her out of the car.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Teddy had already opened the car door for them, and Fourth Master Swan carried her into the car.

At this moment, the surrounding cars were also parked not far away.

Once Jeanne got into Fourth Master Swan’s car, everyone suddenly stopped their crazy chase.

Eden sat in his office, waiting for the result.

Actually, he had never thought of exterminating them.

He had originally wanted to create a car accident and never thought that he would have to kill the two people in the car. However, after Jeanne kept escaping, he gave a death order out of desperation.

His eyes narrowed as he looked at the incoming call.

He picked it up fiercely. “How is it?”

“Jeanne got into Fourth Master Swan’s car!”

“What?!”

“We don’t know whether we should chase after her or not.” The other party reported.

Eden’s hand, which was holding the phone, was trembling.

Uncle Edward!

It was Uncle Edward again!

He looked extremely ferocious.

“Mr. Swan...” the other party did not get a reply and asked again.

“Wait for my notification!”

“Also,” the other side said quickly, “Klaus is no longer in Jeanne’s car.”

“What?!” Eden roared angrily. At this moment, he was so angry that his veins were popping.

“I’m sure that I only saw Jeanne get into Master Swan’s car. Her car is now parked by the street, but Klaus is not there.”

“Meaning, Klaus is no longer in the car?”

“Yes.”

“Didn’t you guys follow her all the time? You don’t even know when she let go of Klaus?” Eden was furious.

“We did follow her all the time, I promise that during the time I followed her, Jeanne didn’t have time to let go of Klaus. The only possibility is that something happened at the Inner Ring Highway.”

“Damn it!” Eden cursed fiercely.

Eden hung up abruptly and dialed Micheal’s number. “Jeanne is now in Uncle Edward’s car.”

No matter how calm he was, Micheal could not hide his surprise. “Your uncle intervened?”

“Yes,” Eden said through gritted teeth.

“I will inform Melody.”

“The important thing is that Klaus is no longer in Jeanne’s car. So even if he dares to chase after my uncle’s car now, it will be useless.” Eden suppressed his emotions and told the truth.

Micheal’s expression changed drastically.

Eden sensed Micheal’s silence and said again, “I never thought that Jeanne’s driving skills would be this good. The Jeanne I know is very bad-tempered and useless. She really doesn’t have such abilities! If I had known earlier, I would have directly asked someone to tamper with her car.”

“Jeanne has indeed exceeded our expectations.” Micheal forcefully suppressed his temper and said, “Let’s end this for now. Melody and I will discuss what to do next.”

“Okay.”

Eden did not say anything more. He knew that he had messed up this matter.

No matter what happened, the outcome of this matter would directly affect the Sanders’ view of him. It was very likely that it would cut off his progress.

At this moment, he really wanted to slice Jeanne into a thousand pieces!

…

The streets of South Hampton City finally returned to normal.

Jeanne looked out of the window.

Ever since she got into the Fourth Master Swan’s car, the danger around her had automatically disappeared.

So, would the Sanders not go against Fourth Master Swan, or did they give up on chasing after her?

After all, Klaus was no longer in her car.

She turned her head and looked at the man sitting beside her, who was now silent.
