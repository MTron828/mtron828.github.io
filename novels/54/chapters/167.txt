Chapter 168: The Night Between Edward and Jeanne Seven Years Ago

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne tried her best to tiptoe.

She tried her best to kiss Fourth Master Swan’s lips.

And then…

She was carried back to Fourth Master Swan’s room.

Jeanne was carried back to his room and did... A big thing in her life.

She had never thought that her precious first time would end so quickly.

Jeanne could no longer remember what she had experienced that night.

Perhaps it was beautiful, perhaps it was cruel.

Many years had passed, and she was choosing to forget.

She only remembered clearly that when she opened her eyes the next morning, the man who had slept next to her was already gone.

The person who stayed was Nox.

He brought her some warm water.

Afterward, he sent her back to the Lawrences’ manor.

As for Fourth Master Swan... Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He did not leave anything behind.

Later on...

Fourth Master Swan did not go to find Jeanne.

It was as if he had forgotten her.

After Jeanne had truly calmed down, she did not dare to provoke the famous Fourth Master Swan in South Hampton City.

Therefore...

Jeanne also chose to forget.

She took it as an erotic dream!

Even though Jeanne felt unresigned to the outcome, she was the one who took the initiative, after all.

She could not blame anyone.

That said, when Jeanne was once again cornered by the media that forced to interview her, she raged.

She shouted at the media, “I’ll sleep with Fourth Master Swan and make Eden address me as his fourth aunt when he sees me!”

This was hyped up by the media later on.

Angry curses and taunts were hurled at her.

The news of Eden and Jeanne breaking up trended.

It stayed that way for a long time!

Perhaps the Swans and the Lawrences did not expect a small break-up to end up like this.

The news spread throughout the country, causing the Swans and the Lawrences to lose face.

As such, Jeanne became the culprit.

Jeanne was beaten half to death by her father.

That was the first time Jeanne truly felt the cruelty of human nature.

Even though Eden had committed a series of despicable acts after his affair, Jeanne was only disgusted.

On the other hand, Jeanne’s dad let her experience the ruthlessness, indifference, and cruelty of this world!

She was sent out of the country by the Lawrences.

When she arrived abroad, she was penniless.

For a long period of time, she barely survived by sleeping and performing on the streets.

Later, Jeanne met a man from Harken who was working as a migrant worker. He took her to work in a restaurant in Sontar. Only then did she get a regular job, though she was still living a lowly life.

By the time Jeanne knew she was pregnant, she had had George for more than five months. Due to her experience abroad, she lost a lot of weight, so there was no sign of pregnancy at all. Her belly bulged only after more than five months, and she felt George’s kicking in her stomach.

At that time, Jeanne panicked.

Nonetheless, she chose to keep the child because she did not have enough money for an abortion.

Jeanne had no medical insurance abroad. A trip to the hospital could bankrupt an average person, not to mention she had no money at all.

She thought that she would never tell George that the only reason he was able to come to this world was that she was too poor.

Fortunately, the foreign country was an open country.

Even though Jeanne was unmarried and pregnant, she was not despised by many people.

At that time, most people thought that the father of the child was the migrant worker.

Jeanne did not explain.

Neither did the man.

Jeanne knew very well that the man liked her.

Perhaps he had been waiting for her to accept his feelings.

In actuality, Jeanne had been worn down by reality at that time. She even thought that after giving birth to George, she would stay with that extremely ordinary man, whom she might not have even been interested in in the past.

Jeanne was simply in so much despair that it was just good to be alive.

It was just an instinctive desire to survive, nothing else.
