Chapter 58: George’s Interview for Elementary School

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The next morning.

Jeanne changed George into a slightly formal suit and brought him out.

At the same time, Phoebe and her husband, Jeremy, brought Paul out. Jenifer personally arranged for them to sit in a black car of the Lawrences.

Jeanne brought George and sat in the red sports car that Monica gave her.

The car drove very slowly on the highway.

George sat in the back seat and looked out of the window in a daze.

Jeanne looked at George through the rearview mirror. “Do you need me to cheer you up?”

George turned around.

“For example, make your heart beat a little.” Jeanne smiled, deliberately trying to liven up the atmosphere.

She knew George was absent-minded not because he was worried that he would not pass the interview, but because he just did not want to go to school.

Jeanne suddenly stepped on the accelerator.

George suddenly grabbed the handrail beside him.

A red sports car was speeding through the streets at lightning speed.

When they passed a luxurious black car, Nox, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, suddenly looked at the red light that flashed past him. He could not help but shout, “F*ck, that was awesome!”

Edward glanced at him from the back seat. “12 points will be deducted.”

“...”

‘He’s no fun.’

…

Jeanne made a perfect drift.

The car stopped at the entrance of Angerburg Private Elementary School, then Jeanne slowly drove into the school parking lot.

There were many cars, and the line was very long.

Jeanne parked the car after a long time. The moment she opened the car door and got out, she directly bumped into Fourth Master Swan, who did not need to wait in line.

She was slightly stunned.

Nox, who was standing next to Fourth Master Swan, could not help but laugh. He finally understood why Fourth Master Swan had called him here so early in the morning.

For a moment, Nox thought that Fourth Master Swan had a change of heart and had personally brought his nephew here for his interview. It turned out that that was not his true intention.

Nox took the initiative to greet Jeanne, “Ms. Lawrence, good driving skills.”

Jeanne smiled faintly.

“But did you know that according to the traffic laws of Harken, the maximum penalty for speeding is 12 points?” Nox said on purpose.

Edward said bluntly, “I’ve never heard of that law.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“...”

‘Fourth Master, does your face hurt?!’

Jeanne said, “I was afraid of being late, so I drove a little faster.”

‘How was that a little faster?’

George was about to vomit.

Jeanne said, “We’ll be late. I’ll go in first.”

Then, she held George’s hand and left.

Edward just watched her leave. He lowered his head and looked at Quinton. “Follow me.”

“...” The six-year-old Quinton expressed that he was very confused.

‘Did I do something wrong?! Why did Fourth Uncle come and torture me like this?!’

...

At the interview venue of the Angerburg Private Elementary School.

In a huge waiting hall, everyone sat in the seats arranged in advance and waited.

The hall was originally very quiet until a surprised voice was heard. “George, why are you here?”

It was Phoebe’s voice.

Jeanne looked up and saw Phoebe walking past her while holding Paul’s hand as if she was looking for a seat.

She responded indifferently, “George is also here for the interview.”

“Can he pass the interview?” Phoebe blurted disdainfully.

“We’ll know after he tries.”

Phoebe still wanted to say something, but a staff member who was maintaining order said, “Please find your seat and sit down. Keep quiet.”

As such, Phoebe endured it and sat in her seat with Jeremy and Paul.

After sitting down, she could not help but send a text message. [Sis, do you know who I saw here? I saw Jeanne bringing George for an interview! I’m not afraid of having another person to compete with. I’m just afraid that the Lawrences will be laughed at. Putting aside George’s abilities, just the fact that he’s an illegitimate child will make him fail the interview. Who doesn’t know that the interview in Angerburg is not only for the children but also for their parents?! What is she thinking?!]

Jenifer was waiting for the news at home. When she saw the message, she was very angry.

‘What kind of trick is Jeanne up to?’

She quickly called Alexander.

Alexander was also very angry. After hanging up, he called Jeanne.

Jeanne looked at the call and hung up.

After a while, countless voice messages were sent to her.

Jeanne ignored them.

Many more text messages were sent to her.

[Jeanne, come back immediately!]

[Did I let you go and embarrass yourself like this?]

[George is an illegitimate child. How can you have the nerve to bring him for an interview? Aren’t you ashamed?!]

[Bring him back!]

Jeanne immediately turned off her phone.

At this moment in the hall, since Jeanne had brought her child here alone, she attracted the attention of countless people.

The other children were with their parents, except for George.

Of course, there was also Fourth Master Swan.

Everyone knew Fourth Master Swan!

In fact, most of the people who could come here to study were people from the upper class, so they knew that he had come to help his nephew. It was not surprising.

On the other hand, Jeanne was different. She bringing George here alone was asking for humiliation.

More and more people entered the hall, and more and more people came out.

Jeanne lined up at the back.

It was almost the turn of the last few people.

Jeanne heard George’s name and brought him in.

In the interview hall, Jeanne and George sat at the interview table. The few interviewers in front of them appeared very formal.

When one of the interviewers was about to speak, another female interviewer said bluntly, “I don’t think there’s anything worth interviewing for. We don’t consider single-parent families, so there’s no need to waste our time. Next!”

“Wait,” Jeanne said, “The interview information for Angerburg didn’t explicitly say that children from single-parent families can’t come for the interview.”

The interviewer frowned slightly. She glanced at Jeanne impatiently, showing a superior attitude. “I’m the principal of Angerburg. I’m making it clear now.”

“Are the rules of an international first-class elementary school so casual?” Jeanne sneered. “My son failed the interview that he had prepared for so long just because of your words?! Is this the so-called ‘people-oriented’ cultural system in your school?!”

The interviewer’s face darkened slightly as she said coldly, “Children who grow up in single families are born with a lack of kinship compared to other children. This is incomplete for the children themselves! Angerburg is a first-class noble school. We don’t accept children who have flaws. We also don’t want this kind of flaw to affect the growth of other children!”

“My son has no flaws!”

“It’s not up to you to decide!”

“It’s not up to you to decide either!” Jeanne enunciated each word.

The interviewer looked at Jeanne coldly.

“Since you didn’t make it clear before that children from single-parent families can’t be interviewed, you don’t have the right to reject my son’s interview!” Jeanne said again with an imposing manner.

At that moment, the interviewer seemed to be stunned by Jeanne’s imposing manner.

She calmed down and said coldly, “10 minutes. Tell me all of your son’s strengths! I don’t want to waste too much of my time!”
