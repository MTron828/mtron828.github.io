He said. “Will vou marrv me?”

He looked up at her, waiting for her answer.

Monica was somewhat silent. As she stared at Finn, who loved her deeply, her throat moved slightly, and her vision blurred.

She suddenly recalled a lot of memories of them being together. It was true that they were rarely happy, and their time together was mostly painful.

However, she nodded in agreement.

She said, “Alright.”

The moment she said that word, both of them burst into tears because they were so happy.

It turned out that it had never been that she did not love him. It was just that she did not dare to love him because she was afraid and hurt.

Finn reached out and held Monica’s hand. Then, he put the engagement ring on Monica’s ring finger seriously. After putting it on, he lowered his head and kissed the back of her hand deeply, as if he was kissing the entire world.

Monica was so touched by Finn’s actions that tears streamed down her face like a waterfall.

Finn stood up from the ground and looked down at her. He said, “Monica, thank you.”

Monica smiled through her tears, which she just could not control.

‘Thank you for giving me another chance to love you,’ Finn wanted to say.

As Finn got closer to Monica and lifted her chin to kiss her, Monica closed her eyes, accepting Finn’s kiss, which felt careful and loving. For the first time, she felt blissful.

Outside the square, the sound of fireworks suddenly rang out, and fireworks filled the sky, signifying a joyous occasion.

Brandon, on the other hand, sat in the car beside them and watched as the romantic and beautiful scene play out.

From the moment Finn took the initiative, he knew he had lost. Thank goodness that he was prepared, or the pain would have killed him. However, it still hurt, and he was not as generous as he thought.

With that, he drove the car that was parked by the roadside away. In any case, he did not need them to remind him that he was single.

The news of Finn’s successful proposal to Monica spread quickly in South Hampton City.

The proposal video from last night was so widely circulated that it started trending on the internet. It was as if it had become a guidebook to proposals, and everyone wanted to watch it once.

Monica was lying in bed, watching the news. As she thought about what happened last night, she still found it surreal.

If she had not watched the video over and over again, she would not have believed that Finn would do such a thing. She thought she would never experience such romance in her life.

“Are you awake?” The person behind her hugged her and asked.

She had woken up long ago, but she did not want to tell Finn that. She did not want him to know that she was very… excited, so excited that she could not sleep much last night and woke up early that morning. “I’ll carry you to the bathroom to wash up.”

“I don’t want to.” Monica twisted her body and refused.

“Be good. We’re going to the hospital for your first pregnancy checkup in three months,” Finn said lovingly.

Monica turned to look at Finn, who added, “I’ve already made an appointment with the doctor.”

“What pregnancy checkup is it?”

“You’ll know when you get there.”

“Does it involve getting an injection?” Monica asked.

“It won’t hurt.”

“You lied to me.”

“I’ll go with you.” “Well, you’re not the one in pain.”

“My heart will hurt.”

“Finn, when did you become so glib… Oh…” A certain someone kissed her passionately.

F*ck. Could he let her finish her sentence? Did Finn have to be so overbearing?

The next moment, she was bewitched by him and kissed him back. They kissed so passionately that it was hard for them to part, which led to…

The two of them got up, washed up, ate, and went to the hospital. They were more than two hours late to the appointment.

When they arrived at the hospital, Finn and the doctor talked in professional medical terms. Monica did not quite understand what they were saying, so she just waited silently at the side.

At that moment, she saw the young nurse beside her looking at her from time to time. She wanted to say something but did not dare to, which made Monica feel a little awkward.

“Do you have something you want to say to me?” Monica could not help but ask the nurse.

“I-I-I just wanted to congratulate you. I saw Mr. Jones’s successful proposal yesterday, so I was a little excited to see you in person today. I just…” The young nurse even blushed.

It made Monica a little shy. She could not understand why Finn had to make the proposal so big. Now, she felt embarrassed too.

“Ms. Cardellini, congratulations. You both are a perfect match. You’ve become the ideal couple for us single people.” The young nurse mustered up her courage and said.

Monica nodded awkwardly. “Uh, thank you.”

“You must give Mr. Jones the love he deserves.” The young nurse did not forget to remind her.

Monica was somewhat speechless. Did she not love Finn enough?

“After all, Mr. Jones loves you so much.” The young nurse seemed to be recalling the scene from yesterday and looked like she longed for a proposal like that.

Monica could not take it anymore. The little nurse in front of her was too corny.

“Monica.” Finn walked to her side.

Monica felt that she was saved. If the conversation continued, she would not be able to talk to the nurse happily. With that, she followed Finn out of the doctor’s office and went to the ultrasound room.

When Monica was lying on the bed, Finn immediately used a device to do an ultrasound on her.

“Do you know how to use it?” Monica asked.

Did all doctors not have their own specialties?

“Of course,” Finn said confidently. It sounded very convincing.

“I did an ultrasound for you once before,” Finn said as he performed the ultrasound seriously.

“When?” Monica was surprised.

Why did she not remember that?

“A few years ago, when you did a checkup on your breast. The doctor who performed the ultrasound was me,” Finn said bluntly.

Monica scanned her memories for a long time before she remembered. Then, her face turned red.

“Finn, how could you do that? We had no feelings for each other back then! Aren’t you ashamed of looking at my body like that?” Monica was suddenly agitated.

The female assistant doctor beside them could not help but laugh.

A little embarrassed, Finn said,” Be quiet. I want to see how the baby is doing.”

Monica forced herself to calm down, but deep down, she still felt indignant. At the thought of that doctor… That was why she thought the doctor was acting weird at that time, and she was confused as to why the doctor had to examine her so carefully.

It turned out it was Finn who was secretly taking advantage of her.

“I don’t think we can see the gender of the baby yet.” The assistant doctor could not help but chuckle.

Finn pursed his lips. Still feeling a little embarrassed, he moved his seat away.

After a series of checkups and confirming that the two babies were healthy,

Finn put down the device and said, “It’s done.”

He cleaned the couplant gel off Monica and helped her up.

“How are the babies?” Monica asked.

“They’re good. They look just like you.”

Monica was speechless. Who was Finn trying to lie to? The babies were just a lump of meat now.

“Let’s go for the next checkup.” “Does that involve needles?” “I just need to draw some blood.” “I’m afraid it’ll hurt.”

“It won’t hurt. I’ll do it for you.”

Would he not be stabbing her if he drew blood from her?

In the end, Monica still did all the tests. The reports that were out stated that everything was normal, but they had to wait for those that were not out yet.

Finn drove away from the hospital at the same speed as always — the speed of a turtle. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Monica looked out of the window in a daze. She could not believe that she was pregnant and with twins at that.. Did she really agree to remarry Finn as well? How could she feel… so blissful?
