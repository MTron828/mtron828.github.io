Chapter 324: The Wedding: Announcing It to the World

When Jasmine said it, her eyes turned red with anger.

If Jeanne did marry Fourth Master Swan, her seniority would be lower than Jeanne’s.

More importantly, although they were married to a Swan, Jeanne would be married to the current man holding the power in the Swans. In that case, Jeanne’s status would naturally be higher than hers in the family. At that thought, she was infuriated!

What kind of ability did a woman like Jeanne have to seduce Fourth Master Swan?

Who did she think she was?

“Jasmine, I’m really disappointed in you!” Jenifer said fiercely, “You better do something in the Swans and think about how to make it hard for Jeanne to stay in the Swans!”

“Mom, can you think of a way to get Jeanne not to marry Fourth Master Swan? I don’t want her to marry him. If she marries him, my pride...”

“Pride? Are you talking to me about pride? My pride has been ruined! Look at what the media has written. They’re saying the Lawrences have put all our attention on you when, in fact, Jeanne is the dark horse. They even said that I’m the one causing trouble. In other words, I’m the evil stepmother! I want to kill Jeanne now!”

Jasmine had also seen the news.

She bit her lips, gnashing her teeth in pain.

“But there are still three days left. I can’t think of a way to stop Jeanne from getting married!” Jenifer said, “I’m afraid that if I do something now, people will say that I deliberately destroyed Jeanne’s marriage. For now, I’ll swallow my anger!”

In the face of such an important event, she still knew her limits.

Jasmine knew her mother was more considerate than them, so she could only listen to her.

......

“You best act happy in front of outsiders. No matter how we feel about it, we have to give Jeanne our blessings. Do you understand?”

Jasmine did not want to agree to it.

“I’m really furious now.” Jenifer said fiercely, “Goodbye.”

Then, she hung up the call, but even after that, her expression was extremely ugly.

That woman, Jeanne, was getting more and more out of hand!

…

Jeanne was, in fact, a little busy.

She would never waste a second on work matters, and if she could make the fastest progress with her work, she would choose the fastest way.

Yet now, she looked at the message on her phone.

[Ed: I’m waiting for you downstairs. ]

He really was a stumbling block in her life.

Jeanne took a deep breath and picked up the phone. “Amy, the meeting in ten minutes is canceled. I’ll be off work now. Tell the project team to prepare all the materials according to my requirements.”

“Yes,” Amy said respectfully. “Director Lawrence, will you be working overtime tonight?”

“It depends. You don’t have to wait for me.”

“Alright.”

With that, Jeanne picked up her bag and left the office.

She had planned her work until the eve of her wedding. However, it seemed that it was too difficult now.

By the time she went downstairs, it was still time to get off work, so a lot of people were coming and going. Many people saw Fourth Master Swan standing there with a bouquet of roses in his arms.

At the sight of her, the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile. At that moment, she heard people exclaim all around her.

With that, she quickly ran over, took the initiative to hold Fourth Master Swan’s hand, and sat in the small car. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

She had always found the man too eye-catching.

That was why she had to... hide.

Fourth Master Swan seemed to be in a good mood, especially with Jeanne’s small hand holding his tightly.

“Fourth Master, where are we going?” Jeanne asked.

They had already met his father last night. What were they going to do tonight?

“To yours,” Edward said straightforwardly.

Jeanne was stunned.

“I’m going to ask for their approval.”

Jeanne was speechless. He had already announced the marriage, yet he still wanted to ask for their approval?

Was he trying to piss Alexander off?

However, Jeanne did not stop him.

Just like that, she and Fourth Master Swan returned to the Lawrences’ family manor.

To be honest, when she saw Alexander at the company today, he did not look too happy. He probably did not expect that she would really marry Fourth Master Swan. In his heart, he probably thought she could, at most, be Fourth Master Swan’s secret lover.

Then, out of the blue, she was the Swans’ Fourth Madam. He would most definitely lose his pride in front of her!

The two of them walked into the hall together.

In the hall, Alexander was already in a bad mood, so when he saw Fourth Master Swan with Jeanne, the expression on his face instantly changed for the worst.
