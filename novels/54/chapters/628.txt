Of course, he only ever thought of killing her, but he never dared to act on it. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, he heard someone in the company talking badly about him again. It pissed him off so badly that he shot his mouth off in front of Jonathan, saying he wished he could kill Jeanne’s mother. That was when he got Jonathan’s sudden approval, and Jonathan told him, “In that case, kill her!”

When he heard those words, the blood in his entire body went crazy.

Jeanne’s mother had made him suppress himself for so many years! If she died, he could release all the grievances he had suffered all those years.

Only after he obtained his father’s approval did he realize how much he wanted to kill Jeanne’s mother.

Later on, he really did kill her.

When he saw Jeanne’s mother’s unrecognizable appearance, he felt a sense of joy. After so many years, she finally died in his hands; it was the ending she deserved.

After Jeanne’s mother died, he allowed Jenifer to enter their Lawrences’ as his legitimate wife.

Jenifer had given birth to a son and daughter for him a long time ago, so he did not care much for Jeanne. On top of how alike Jeanne looked to her mother, he did not have the so-called fatherly love for her. If it were not for Eden suddenly becoming very close to Jeanne — and Jonathan advising him to wait and see if Jeanne could really play up to the Swans when she grew up — Jeanne might not have had a good time in the Lawrences in her earlier years.

It was also because of his lack of care for Jeanne that he was so cruel to her when she broke up with Eden seven years ago.

However, sending Jeanne away was never his intention. He only thought he would make Jeanne’s life miserable in the future. It was Eden’s father from the Swans who came to him personally to ask him to send Jeanne away, or it would affect the relationship between Eden and Jasmine. That was why he sent Jeanne out of the country in the end.

After sending her out of the country, he was never concerned as to whether Jeanne was dead or alive.

He did not care much for Jeanne in the first place anyway.

If it were not because he wanted to form a marriage alliance with the Lockes so that Lawrence Enterprise could get more funds, they would not have asked Jeanne to come back.

If they did not ask Jeanne to come back, none of this would have happened, and he would not have fallen from grace.

Alexander probably regretted it now.

Jeanne looked at Alexander’s appearance and could see through Alexander’s thoughts.

However, she was very calm now.

After all, she was not one of the Lawrences.

How Alexander, Jonathan, and Jasmine treated her... Back when she thought she was part of the family, it would pain her. However, once she knew she had nothing to do with those people with evil intentions, she was calm.

“Jeannie, I know what I say is useless now, and you won’t forgive me. But...” Alexander’s eyes suddenly turned red.

He was starting to play the emotional card again.

“But I am still your dad. I know I was wrong, so Jeannie, please save me. As long as you keep me alive, I will never do anything to let you down again. I will definitely... treat you well in the future.” Alexander held Jeanne’s hand and said painfully, “It was all my fault in the past. It was my fault–”

“If you did something wrong, you should be punished.” Jeanne broke free from Alexander’s grip.

She was still indifferent to his current state.

Alexander looked at Jeanne.

Seeing that she had never thought of saving him, he could not continue to pretend and was angry at Jeanne. “Jeanne! You know if you do this, karma will get back at you! Yes, I killed my father. I’m unforgivable, and I deserve retribution. But you? I am your father. For treating me like this, you will also suffer retribution! Sooner or later, the heavens will strike you down sooner or later!”

Jeanne looked at Alexander ironically.

The drama was over, and now it was a threat.

She had initially planned to leave as she thought it was best to leave Alexander with some of his dignity.

After all, he was going to die soon.

Since he knew what he had done throughout his life, and although reluctant, he would not die with too much regret. Yet now, she suddenly felt that she was still too merciful to this family.

She said, “Dad, do you know I’m not your biological daughter?”

Alexander was shocked and looked at Jeanne fiercely. That information was obviously too big of a blow to him.
