1050 I Think You’ll Attack Me In This Chapter

She said, “My father rarely praises people. I’ve also heard him mention you several times. He said that when your business was failing, he even made an exception and supported you by giving you the cost price so that you could develop again at the lowest point of your life.”

Richie’s expression changed when he heard what Monica said.

Michael smiled coldly at the side.

Monica had indeed changed a lot. If she had not met him, Cardellini Enterprise might have had to struggle a little.

Unfortunately, he was the first person Monica met on her path of growth, and Monica was destined to have a tragic life.

“If my dad didn’t admire you, I don’t think he would’ve helped you so much. So, let me toast to you.” Monica picked up her wine glass.

She used her father’s affirmation of Richie to remind him that he should not forget his roots.

Everyone in the business world was smart.

Naturally, Richie understood her intention immediately. What was more, he already knew Monica’s purpose for coming today.

“Here’s a toast to you, to thank old Gary for his help back then,” Richie chimed in. “I wanted to visit him at the hospital as soon as I arrived, but I have been so busy and can’t spare the time. I’ll definitely visit him tomorrow when I have the time.”

“I know you’re busy, Mr. Sanchez. My dad is in the hospital and won’t be discharged for a while, so you don’t have to worry. Business is more important.”

“Thank you for your understanding,” he said.

Then, he had a few more drinks with Monica, and that continued for an entire night.

Monica had really drunk a lot. If not for her amazing alcohol tolerance, she would have collapsed on the table.

Now, after three rounds of drinking, Monica did not want to beat around the bush with Richie anymore.

She said bluntly, “Mr. Sanchez, I believe you’re well aware of Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation.”

“I heard.” Richie hurriedly said, “I really didn’t expect Cardellini Enterprise to face a crisis as soon as Gary fell ill. I felt terrible when I heard this news.”

“No one can avoid getting sick.”

“I didn’t think you’d be able to understand that at such a young age. It’s been hard on you,” Richie said with the attitude of an elder.

“It’s a little tough, but as long as I can get Cardellini Enterprise to tide over this crisis, it’s nothing.”

“That’s true.”

“To tell you the truth, Cardellini Enterprise is heavily stocked with drugs now, and we urgently need a drug distributor to take it from us. Mr. Sanchez, you’re really Cardellini Enterprise’s savior for coming to South Hampton City.”

At that moment, Richie did not reply.

Monica also knew that it would not be so easy to convince him, but she still revealed her motive to him. “Since my dad gave you a chance to develop your business again back then, I don’t think you’ll leave him in the lurch, will you?”

“Of course not.” Richie quickly agreed, but the next second, he looked troubled. “It’s just that I’ve just discussed a collaboration with Sunny Pharmaceutical, and there’s nothing I can do to help you.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was also Monica’s first time seeing Wilson Sonny, Sunny Pharmaceutical’s general manager.

Naturally, they were also present at the table tonight.

Wilson Sonny felt Monica’s gaze and hurriedly said, “Chairman Cardellini, I thank you first.”

However, Monica ignored Wilson Sonny and said, “Didn’t Mr. Ross say that the contract is still being negotiated?”

Michael smiled.

He did not drink much tonight so that he could watch Monica perform.

Michael said, “You might’ve misunderstood me, Ms. Cardellini. I said we’ve already discussed it, but you can sit down and have a meal with us. Although we’re all competitors, we can still compete fairly in the future.”

Monica had no limit for Michael’s despicable behavior. She felt that no matter how bad he was, she could accept it.

She continued to say to Richie, “Mr. Sanchez, it doesn’t matter if you have signed the contract with Sunny Pharmaceutical because Cardellini Enterprise will not compete with them. As I said just now, Cardellini Enterprise has a lot of drugs in stock, and instead of keeping them in our warehouse, I think it’s better to distribute the goods to Mr. Sanchez. You can sell them and get a 20 percent discount on the purchase price. What do you think?”

Richie was put in a difficult position.

“I don’t want to pressure you, Mr. Sanchez, but there’s no way you can’t help us out with such a small favor, right?” Monica smiled and poured him another glass of wine.

She was trying to persuade Richie to take the deal.

Just as Richie was about to refuse, Michael said, “Since Ms. Cardellini has said that, it would be too impolite for you to refuse, Mr. Sanchez. After all, Ms. Cardellini’s father did help you back then. You can’t be so ungrateful.”
