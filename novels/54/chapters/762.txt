Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne narrowed her eyes.

Joshua was indeed bold.

She struggled to get up from Edward’s body.

She asked, “Can I borrow Dr. Jones for a while?”

“What?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

Jeanne did not hide anything from Edward and showed him the text message that Miles just sent her.

Edward understood immediately.

He said, “Just call Finn.”

“Will he listen to me?”

“He will.” Edward was certain.

Jeanne did not seem to believe him.

“Finn and Nox will listen to you.”

Was she picking up on something within that sentence? However, she stopped herself from thinking too much.

At that moment, she picked up the phone and called Finn directly. “Dr. Jones, it’s me.”

Finn was probably asleep.

Even though he did not sound asleep, it rang a few times before the call was connected. In that case, he probably fell asleep some time ago.

Jeanne could not help but secretly sigh.

Although Monica’s approach was absolutely wrong when it came to Michael, Monica and Finn shared the same feelings for each other. However, after the divorce, Monica would go to sleep drunk every day while Finn could still live a normal life.

It still made Jeanne feel a little upset.

“What’s the matter?”

“I remember I was once drugged, and you gave me a medicine that instantly made me feel much better,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Finn’s hand that was holding the phone tightened.

Yes, he had that medicine.

The first experiment on Jeanne was basically a success.

However, the medicine did not help him because he was drugged when he slept with Monica.

“Do you need it?” Finn asked, his tone naturally calm.

“I’ll send you a location. Please bring the pill to a friend of mine. I’ve also sent you his phone number.” Jeanne said, “While you’re at it, help my friend. His name is Miles. I’m getting him to help me with something that he might not be able to do alone.”

“Alright.” Finn really did agree.

On top of that, he did not question her.

She turned to look at Edward, who seemed to have expected that as he was not surprised.

“Thank you,” Jeanne expressed her gratitude.

Finn acknowledged in response before Jeanne hung up the phone and turned to look at Edward.

The two of them suddenly fell silent. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“How did you know Joshua was going to make a move on Quinn? ” Edward broke the silence.

“I guessed it,” Jeanne said bluntly.

However, it was obvious that she was right.

“You’re smarter than I thought.” Edward was smiling.

Jeanne did not know if there was a hint of cruelty hidden in his smile.

She wondered if the more impressive her performance was, the more guarded he would be against her.

Nevertheless, she leaned into his arms again and said, “Can you help me investigate Michael?”

Edward frowned.

It was because Jeanne had suddenly changed the topic.

“Monica has been investigating him for a long time, but she hasn’t found anything.” Jeanne said frankly, “But I have a feeling that he has ulterior motives toward Monica.”

“I’ve been investigating him for a long time.” Edward did not hide it from Jeanne.

Jeanne looked up at him.

“I know the background of everyone who is a threat to me. However, I’m sorry to tell you that I haven’t found any clues about him yet.” Edward said, “But Michael isn’t a good person.”

Jeanne agreed.

“This kind of person is only temporarily hiding his ambitions, so he’s very careful. Once he shows his ambitions, it’s easy to catch him in the act.”

“So, you think the best way to deal with Michael now is to sit and wait.”

“Yes.” Edward nodded. “But if you want to speed it up, I can get Nox to help you.”

“Forget it,” Jeanne rejected him. “The worst has happened. Monica already believes that Michael, and she has chosen to divorce Finn, so there’s no rush.

Edward nodded and did not say much.

It did not take long before the car arrived at Bamboo Garden.

The two of them then returned to their room and washed up.

As soon as Jeanne lay down, her phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID before answering the call.

Edward got up and left the bed. On his way to the balcony, he grabbed a pack of cigarettes.

They seemed to have a tacit understanding not to invade each other’s privacy. Rather than respect, it was more like they were keeping a distance.

If they did not get too involved in each other’s affairs, he wouldn’t be too involved with each other.

Jeanne glanced at Edward’s back and regained her senses. “Quinn.”

“Thank you for tonight.”

“How are you?” Jeanne asked.

“I’m much better now, thanks to your friend.”

“Go back and get some rest.”

“How did you know they were going to attack me?”

“I warned you,” Jeanne said.

“But I didn’t expect him to be so bold.” No matter how much Quinn endured, she could not conceal her anger.

Hence, she did not take Jeanne’s words to heart.

“Joshua isn’t that bold, but Eden is. To be more precise…” Jeanne paused. “Perhaps someone is supporting him from behind.

“Who is it?” Quinn asked.

“I don’t have any evidence, so I can’t tell you now.”

“You mean the people around me?” Quinn could think of it immediately.

Jeanne did not answer, and Quinn did not force her to answer either.

“I’ve already called the police, and Joshua is being detained,” Quinn suddenly said.

“You’re the one who’s hurt. I’ll go with your arrangements.” Jeanne did not want to interfere in their affairs.

To her, chasing Joshua away and obtaining all of Lawrence Enterprise’s shares was her goal.

As for how miserable Joshua’s fate would be, that was his own business.

“I owe you a favor,” Quinn said at the end of the call.

Jeanne’s lips curled into a smile.

It was killing two birds with one stone, which was not a bad thing at all.
