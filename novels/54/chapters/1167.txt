“Everyone, sit down and don’t move. Someone will come and cut off a single hair on your head,” Warren ordered.

“Yes,” everyone replied respectfully.

Although they could not understand Warren’s actions, they could only accept them because they could not resist.

The staff at the scene collected the hair of everyone present.

Once the collection was completed, Warren said, “The DNA matching time can be controlled to be at least six hours. It was now 6 p.m. in the evening, and the results would be out at around 12 a.m. During this time, everyone will stay here until the results are out.”

“Yes.”

“Let’s eat.” Warren greeted.

Then, he picked up his utensils, and the others also started to eat.

During the meal, the atmosphere was a little too serious as no one spoke rashly. After all, the atmosphere tonight was completely different from the usual.

At 7 p.m. after dinner, everyone was in the tea room, playing chess with Warren and Chester.

There were many guards standing in the tea room and stationed in the entire Sanders’ residence. The security was so tight that not even a fly could fly out.

After two games, which was 8 p.m., Justin moved his body and got up, ready to leave the tea room.

Just as he was at the door, two guards stood in front of him.

Justin frowned.

“Where are you going? ” Warren asked while playing chess.

“I’m going to the toilet,” Justin replied.

“Bring them along,” Warren ordered.

Justin’s expression changed slightly.

As he did not expect it to be so serious, he could not help but say, “Father, are you suspecting me? Didn’t I grow up by your side?”

“I don’t suspect anyone now. I suspect everyone.” Warren’s tone was cold.

Justin wanted to say something, but Jeanne got up and pulled him back. She whispered in his ear, “You have to understand where father is coming from.”

With that, Justin endured it and left with two guards by his side.

Jeanne sat back down on the sofa.

“It’s your turn,” Warren urged Chester.

Chester returned to his senses.

He had just taken a look at the interaction between Jeanne and Justin. Obviously, the two of them… did not have a simple friendship.

Nevertheless, he continued playing chess.

After a while, although Justin was a little upset when he returned, he did not dare to say anything.

The atmosphere in the tea room seemed to have become even gloomier.

By 10 p.m., Warren was a little tired. He said, “I’m not playing anymore.”

While Chester kept the chessboard away, Warren called a guard in. “Ask how long it will take.”

“Yes.”

After the guards left, they quickly returned. “The fattest will take an hour to be completed. The final manual comparison is being made.”

Warren nodded before turning to the servant beside him and said, “Bring in another pot of tea.”

“Yes, leader.” The servant left.

Just like that, another half an hour passed.

At 10:30 am., William stood up from the sofa. “Father, I need to go to the washroom.”

“Go on.” Warren agreed.

“I’ll go with you.” Stacey quickly said, “I want to move around too.”

Without asking for permission, she pulled on William’s arm and left.

The room was quiet and filled with silence.

At that moment, Edward suddenly stood up. “I need to use the washroom too.”

Warren frowned. “Wait for a while. We’ll go when William comes back.”

“I’m really in a hurry.” Edward looked troubled.

“Go and urge William.” Warren gave the order to one of the guards in the tea room.

“Yes.”

The guards quickly left.

With that, Edward stood up and walked around as if he was holding back his body’s needs.

After waiting for a while, Warren’s expression turned grim. “Why isn’t he back yet?”

At that moment, Edward could not hold it in anymore. “I really can’t take it anymore.”

After that, he walked out, not caring if he got approval to do so or not.

“Stop right there!” Warren’s face darkened.

However, Edward did not listen, and he was walking a little fast.

“Edward!” Warren called out to him.

...

Edward did not stop and walked straight out.

“Stop him!” Warren ordered the guards.

The guards immediately left, but the moment they went up, Edward kicked one of the guards, sending him flying.

Warren’s expression changed.

Not just Warren, but the other members of the Sanders were also shocked by Edward’s sudden resistance.

Jeanne was the same.

Did that mean Edward was covering for someone?
