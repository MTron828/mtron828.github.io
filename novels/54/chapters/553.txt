Chapter 554: Sowing Discord Between The Lawrences

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I heard from your father that George is Edward’s son?” Jonathan asked.

“Yes. Seven years ago, I slept with Edward because of a mistake and accidentally got pregnant with his child.”

“Why didn’t you tell Edward you were pregnant?” Jonathan asked.

“Edward wasn’t kind to me after I slept with him, and I didn’t want to embarrass myself, so I kept the child and raised him,” Jeanne said casually.

“I’m afraid it’s not as simple as that,” Jonathan speculated. “I’m sure you kept the child as a way out for yourself.”

She really did not think of it that way. However, to convince Jonathan of her story, she nodded and said, “I did think about it. After all, a mother is only respected if she has a son.”

“You really are smarter than Jasmine. Jasmine has really disappointed me. I thought that by going to the Swans, she would be able to coax the Swans and give us some benefits, but in reality, she had so little power in the family. Not only did she not have a place in the Swans, but she even put you in the limelight and made it into an internal conflict!”

“Jasmine is unlucky to have met someone like Eden. I’m sure you could tell from what happened between Eden and me back then that Eden is not a man of responsibility.”

Jonathan agreed with Jeanne. “On the surface, Eden may seem like he’s a good person and that he’s everyone’s first choice for a son-in-law, but in actual fact, it is the Swans who have made him seem that way.”

“That’s why it’s not entirely Jasmine’s fault. I think Jasmine has probably learned her lesson by now. If you think of her as family, you should think of a way to get her out of there. After what she did, she will not have a good life living with the Swans.”

“Are you showing consideration for Jasmine?” Jonathan was stunned.

“When Jasmine was first exposed, I did want my revenge. But after seeing how miserable she is, I think teaching her a lesson is good enough. After all, we’re family, and I’ve never thought of killing her. As long as Jasmine knows her mistake, I’m fine with it.”

“Jeanne, you’re much more open-minded than I thought.”

“I just know what I want. Besides, I’ve returned the blow that Jasmine gave me all those years ago back to her, so we’re even now. The only thing I want to do is grow Lawrence Enterprise. If possible...”

Jonathan was captivated by Jeanne’s words, yet Jeanne deliberately stopped herself from saying more to let Jonathan figure it out himself.

In fact, Jonathan could figure it out, but he would not say it out loud.

He just asked indirectly, “How’s your relationship with Edward?”

“It’s alright. It’s not great, but it’s not bad either.”

“I heard people say Edward treats you very well, though.”

“Not everything people say can be trusted. However, Edward doesn’t treat me badly. As you know, Edward is a cold person, and it’s impossible for him to pour his heart out to anyone.”

“Then, he took the initiative to marry you–”

“It’s probably because of George.” Jeanne said, “Only after getting to know Edward more have I realized he’s very indifferent to matters between men and women. Probably being with me is just for show to the public.”

After saying that, Jeanne could not help but twitch.

Edward? Indifferent to matters between men and women?

How did she come up with that reason?

She felt that it was a slap in the face.

“In that case, how did you two sleep together seven years ago?”

“Because I was slandered so badly by the public at that time, I wanted to find someone to help me, and the only person I could think of was Edward. So, I went to his house to wait for him. Edward happened to be drunk that night, and since he was a little muddle-headed, I took the initiative. However, after having sex, Edward was very cold to me. He also made it clear that he would not be responsible, so I did not dare to say anything to anyone.” Jeanne made up a lie to gain Jonathan’s trust.

Jonathan did not seem suspicious of her story.

After all, the fact that Edward and Jeanne got married so suddenly was already odd in itself.

Now that Jeanne had told him the story, he finally understood the situation. However, he understood more now that Jeanne was more ambitious than he thought. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Jeanne did not have her eye on Lawrence Enterprise but Swan Enterprise.

At that moment, he felt that if Jeanne wanted, she could split up Swans Enterprise. After all, she had gained tens of billions in a short seven years all by herself, so perhaps she could create a miracle, which he could get a share of…
