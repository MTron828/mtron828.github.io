Chapter 731: Warmth: Do You Know Why We Raise Pigs?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Edward washed George’s hair.

This time, the water and soap did not flow into his eyes.

Edward said while washing George’s hair, “Actually, I often cried when I was young.”

“Huh?” George was stunned.

“At your age, or maybe a little older,” Edward said.

“Why did you cry?”

“It felt like there were many things I couldn’t do, so I cried to vent out those frustrations,” Edward replied.

“But it’s useless to cry.” At that moment, George seemed very mature.

“That was why I stopped crying,” Edward said. “But everyone can cry. There’s no need to hold it in when you’re unhappy.”

Then, Edward picked George, who had been rinsed clean, up and used the towel to wipe George’s eyes before drying his hair briefly.

After that, she bathed George’s small body.

George was not used to that treatment.

He had learned to bathe by himself since he was very young, but he could not refuse Fourth Master Swan anyway.

“In the future, don’t keep everything to yourself,” Edward said.

He did not want his son to be like him when he was younger.

“At any time, you have me.” Edward’s tone was normal.

He was not deliberately trying to imply anything. He just wanted to tell George that he could rely on his father.

Since young, George had been much more mature than the average child. Therefore, he understood the meaning behind Edward’s words, and he felt touched by it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Alright. It was all Teddy’s fault for forcing him to watch so many father-son reunion movies and making him think that Fourth Master Swan loved him like he was his life.

Just then, he heard Fourth Master Swan say, “Of course, except for the matter of stealing your mother.”

In that case, what Fourth Master Swan said was all bullshit.

George gritted his teeth and looked at Edward.

“I didn’t expect you to be so dirty.” Edward suddenly changed the topic.

George was surprised.

“Take a look for yourself.” Edward rubbed George’s small body until it was red, and there were indeed some stains on his reddened body.

It made George extremely embarrassed.

“Don’t you think it’s not all bad to have a father?” Edward continued to scrub him.

George would never admit it.

“You should be embarrassed if your mother knew how dirty you were.”

“Don’t tell her.” George was very angry.

He was very young and still could not bathe himself. Therefore, he would only quickly shower himself with soap every day. He did not know that it was not good to take a quick shower and that there would be so many stains on his body.

“Okay.” Edward smiled. “Men should have their secrets too.”

Who the hell wanted to share secrets with Edward?

“Do you need me to help you here?”

“No need.” George covered himself with his hands.

“In that case, bathe yourself.”

George took a look at Edward and obediently lathered soap on his body. Then, he washed it off carefully.

As he rinsed himself off, George’s face started to redden.

It was because he thought of what he saw when Fourth Master Swan bathed him the last time.

It was obvious that Fourth Master Swan was only bathing him and did not have any intention to bathe with him.

“Do you have something to say?” Edward seemed to have read George’s mind.

George gritted his teeth. “Why do you look like that?”

“Like what?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

George looked down at him.

Only then did Edward suddenly understand, and he smiled. “When you grow up, you will also look like that.”

“I don’t want to. It doesn’t look good at all.” George’s face was full of disdain.

Helpless, Edward said, “If your mother hears this, she will faint in the toilet.”

George was dumbfounded.

Jeanne expressed.

She was also in a difficult position.

At that moment, she was outside George’s bathroom.

She did not know if Edward would bully George again, so she followed him. Then, she heard the sound of a shower coming from the bathroom, as well as the conversation between the father and son.

It was so explicit… Was that the conversation men had with each other?

After that, she turned around and was about to leave.

After all, their interaction was not going as bad as she thought. It seemed that without her presence, Edward and George would get along more happily.

She had just lifted her feet when she heard Edward’s voice from the bathroom.

“Because your mother likes it very much.”

‘What bullsh*t!’

Jeanne’s entire face turned red.

Could Edward be any more outspoken?

However, she started to understand what Edward meant — that she would be very worried if George did not grow up well and healthy in all aspects of development.

In fact, that was every mother’s worry.

Though, never in a million years did not expect Edward to say such dirty words…
