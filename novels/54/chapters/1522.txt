Chapter 1523: Side Story: The Birth of Kingsley’s Son

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Lucy thought Kingsley was possessed because there was no way he would like her. How could he like her so much?

The truth was, he was really good to her, unlike how he treated everyone else.

What she was initially nervous about became a matter of course. It was really easy for people to fall.

She stayed by Kingsley’s side almost every day and did… many things in bed with him. His dependence on her was much deeper than she wanted to admit. Sometimes, the two of them would be together for an entire day.

At first, she thought that it might be because she was new to him and that he was only in love with her body. However, they had been together for too long for him just to be in love with her body.

A year had passed, and everyone in the industry knew that Kingsley of the Hills had a woman he liked. He loved her so much that he could not bear to part with her. He simply doted on her to the core.

At first, some people thought it was just a rumor. After all, how could the cold-blooded and cruel Kingsley, who killed for a living, fall in love with anyone so easily?

However, seeing was believing. When everyone saw Kingsley and Lucy together, they had to admit that Kingsley was really in love, and it was the kind that could not be stopped.

Of course, Kingsley had not only found love that year. He also did something unimaginable.

Nobody knew if Kingsley had gone crazy, but he had suddenly established an assassin association from the assassin organizations that were originally unrelated to each other. He wanted the assassin organizations to unite and set rules to keep each other in check and become stronger together.

Things did not go well in the beginning, but later, under the influence of Kingsley’s violence, the assassin organization had no choice but to listen to him.

In just a year, Kingsley of the Hills had become the Kingsley of all the assassin organizations He no longer ruled just the Hills but all the assassin organizations, making him even more terrifying.

Lucy, however, did not understand why Kingsley had to do that. It was not that Kingsley was not deserving of the position, but the Hills were just as strong on their own without needing to form alliances with other assassin organizations. Moreover, it was said that the Hills had a lot of invisible power. Anyway, no one dared to provoke them.

Kingsley told her that, in this life, he wanted to live for himself. As for avenging his sister, he would leave it to Jeanne. He even said that Jeanne had a husband who could help her.

Most importantly, where was Jeanne’s husband? Who was it? She had been in the Hills for a year but had never heard anyone mention it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Sometimes, she even wondered if Jeanne’s husband was just a random guy on the street. After all, from Jeanne’s behavior, she did not seem to have any feelings for her husband.

Of course, Kingsley did not ignore Jeanne. He found the best assassin to train her, allowing her to gradually gain the ability of a top-notch assassin. On top of that, he also found the best business genius to nurture her, making her a business elite. All of that was to pave a path for Jeanne to take revenge.

However, he told Jeanne clearly that he was only paving the way for her and that she had to rely on herself to take revenge.

Jeanne did not complain, and just like that, she brought George up quietly in the Hills.

Lucy would occasionally go watch Jeanne’s training. She felt that if she continued to be dispirited, she might not be as skilled as Jeanne. After all, she had not even seen a weapon since she had been in Hills for a year.

Did he not say that he wanted her to come back and be an assassin?

Lucy watched as Jeanne finished her day’s training, which had drained Jeanne of all her strength. Hence, she helped Jeanne back to her room.

The one-year-old George was cuter than the one-month-old George. He could talk, walk, and even do some amazing things. In short, he became very likable.

Seeing that she and Jeanne had returned, he hurriedly ran over and called out to them warmly, “Mommy, Grandaunt.”

Every time Lucy heard George call her “Grandaunt”, she felt a little uncomfortable. She was only 26 years old, yet she already had such a big grandson.

Most importantly, George had always called Kingsley by his name, yet he had to call her grandaunt.

Later, she found out that Kingsley had told Jeanne and George to call him by his name, but they had to address her respectfully. Actually, she did not want them to address her so formally..
