“Zoe.” Mrs. Sullivan nudged her daughter, a little displeased. “Mrs. Winter is talking to you. What are you thinking about?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Zoe quickly came back to her senses and apologized. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Winter. I was thinking about something at work. The company encountered a tricky matter today, so I was thinking about it for a second. Please don’t mind me.” “It’s fine. Nox’s lucky to have such a motivated woman as his wife.”

“It’s because Nox is doing so well that I want to do better. I’m afraid I’m not worthy of him.” Zoe was very good with her words.

Her simple words expressed to others t his hard work and praised Nox.

Upon hearing that, Mrs. Winter’s heart warmed. She could not help but sigh in her heart. Shelly was indeed nowhere near Zoe. No wonder Nox was unwilling to be with Shelly.

“Um, I’m going to make a call to settle some work. I’ll be back in a while.” Zoe found an excuse to leave the private room.

After leaving the private room, her expression sank. It struck her that the waitress was the one she schemed again Nox with last time! She recognized Shelly at a glance, but she did not know that she was actually Shelly.

The name Shelly was quite popular in the upper-class society, but very few people had seen her before Moreover, all the people who had seen Shelly before had said that she was not good-looking and was a little old-fashioned. As a result, no one was interested in her. It was only because she was Nox’s companion that people would occasionally talk about her.

Zoe did not think much of Shelly, so she did not even try to understand who Shelly was as a person. When she was dating Nox, Shelly left on her own accord, and she did not care about such a weak woman. However, she did not expect to make the mistake of allowing Nox to sleep with Shelly.

At that moment, she felt disgusted. Now, she was pissed off by the lousy idea Cody gave her back then! The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.

Of course, she was not angry because Nox had slept with Shelly. What she cared about the most was that Shelly knew everything about her.

She had never concealed herself in the nightclub, and Shelly had also served her. At that moment, she even remembered that she and Cody had behaved intimately in another high-class restaurant, and it seemed that Shelly was their…

A chill ran down her spine. Was it a coincidence or did that woman do it on purpose? She had heard it was Nox who rejected Shelly back then and Shelly was kicked out of the house.

A woman like Shelly would definitely want to marry into the Winter family. After all, the status and wealth that the Winters could give were something that no woman could refuse or even chase after. Perhaps… Shelly was looking for an opportunity to marry Nox.

The more Zoe thought about it, the uglier her expression became. She had also come out to look for Shelly as there were some things she needed to clarify with Shelly. She could not allow Shelly to ruin her marriage.

With that, she walked to the receptionist. “I’m looking for the waitress named Shelly?”

“May I ask if there’s something you need-”

“I said I’m looking for her. What’s with all the questions?” Her tone was rather unpleasant.

The receptionist did not dare to offend the guests, so even though she felt wronged, she didn’t dare to resist. She said into the walkie-talkie, “Shelly, come to the front desk. There’s a guest looking for you.”

Shelly was serving the guests at another room at the moment, and it was not easy for her to request the change. However, as expected, Nox would not let her off so easily.

In Nox’s heart, he must think that she was seducing him on purpose. Sometimes, nothing she did could prove her innocence, so she agreed and walked to the front desk.

Surprisingly, the person who was looking for her was not Nox but Zoe. Almost instantly, she knew why Zoe was looking for her.

Zoe probably did not know that she was Shelly or her relationship with Nox, and that was why Zoe did all the shameful things at the places she worked at. Now, Zoe was probably here to threaten her not to tell anyone.

In fact, she was well aware of the usual tactics of upper-class women. As such, she thought about it and figured she could even extort money from Zoe.

At that thought, Shelly walked over happily. She even appeared very respectful. “Ms.. Sullivan, you were looking for me?”
