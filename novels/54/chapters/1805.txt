“I expected it.” Edward said bluntly, “That was why I told you not to waste your breath last night. He’s not going to get married anyway.”

“How did you know he wouldn’t get married?”

“I’ve known him for 30 years.”

‘Fine, you win!’ However, instead of saying that, Jeanne put down her phone and asked, “What do we do now? Should we turn back?”

“What else?”

Edward then told the chauffeur to turn around.

At the same time. Jeanne received a call. She looked at the caller ID and picked it up. “Shelly?”

Edward frowned but could not hear what the other party said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jeanne hung up the phone and said, “There’s no need to turn around. The wedding will proceed.”

“What do you mean?” Edward frowned.

“What do you think?” Jeanne smiled brightly.

It meant Nox was a lucky b*starrd.

When Nox arrived at the airport, he called his assistant. “I’m here. How long will it take you to get here with my passport?” “About 20 minutes,” the other side quickly said.

“Hurry up. Any later and I’ll be caught by my mother!”

“Mr. Winter, I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to run away like that. Your last wedding ended up a joke, and it’ll also end up a joke again this time. Aren’t you afraid that would be laughed at in the future?”

“Shut up!” Nox’s face darkened. ‘I don’t live for others. As long as I’m fine with it, who cares?’

“I’m waiting for you at the international terminal. Come over quickly.”

“Yes,” the other party said respectfully.

Nox walked to the international terminal, trying to figure out where he should fly to! He thought about it for a while, and after confirming his destination, he urged his assistant again.

The assistant ran up to him, panting. “Mr. Winter, your passport.”

“Alright.” Nox took it and went straight to the ticket counter. “The flight that is at the nearest gate.”

Once the staff had helped him with the procedures, there were 20 minutes left before boarding time. Hence, Nox went through security check first.

“Mr. Winter, are you leaving just like that?” the assistant asked.

“F*ck, don’t look so bitter. I’m not leaving for good. You make it seem like you’re mourning me already. I’ll be back in a month at most.” “I don’t think it’s a good idea that you’re leaving.”

“If you keep talking, I’ll fire you immediately!” Nox threatened.

The assistant did not dare to speak. He watched helplessly as Nox went straight to the security checkpoint without any luggage. As it was a first-class cabin, there was no need to queue. However, when he was about to enter the security check, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.

He was not afraid of the consequences of being a runaway groom. In any case, the whole country already knew that he had been cheated on, so there was nothing that he could not handle. On the contrary, he was a little reluctant to part with someone.

He took a deep breath and thought he was being a little melodramatic. Even if he did not want to leave, it did not matter whether he was in Harken or South Hampton City because he would not be able to see her either.

As he walked straight to the security checkpoint, a familiar voice suddenly came from behind.

“Daddy!”

Nox paused for a moment. After thinking it through, he did not think it was directed at him. After all, there were so many fathers, and all little kids’ voices sounded similar.

“Daddy!”

The crisp voice rang out again.

Nox paused for a moment but did not turn around as he did not think it was directed at him.

“Daddy! Daddy, don’t go!” This time, it sounded like the little kid was crying.

It made Nox think that the father was a little cruel. However, the airport was a place filled with sorrow and joy. If it were his child calling him like that, he would not leave no matter what. Unfortunately, he was single.

“Daddy… Boohoo…” The child behind him cried miserably.

Assuming that the little kid’s father had left, Nox started to go through the security check calmly.

“Nox!” Suddenly, someone called him.

Nox was stunned. Was he hallucinating? He seemed to have heard Shelly’s voice. Did he miss her so much that he was going crazy?

“Nox!” The voice called out to him again.

Nox began to suspect that he was not hallucinating.

“Nox, don’t go! ” There was a hint of urgency in her voice, and she sounded like she was crying.

Nox turned around abruptly and saw a woman in a white wedding dress standing there with tears in her eyes.

‘Is it an illusion or is it not an illusion? What is it?’

Nox’s vision blurred. Was he dreaming right now? Was God playing tricks on him? He was afraid that he would not be able to take it if he opened his eyes..
