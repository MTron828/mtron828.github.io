1065 Finn, I Killed Someone

“If it were not for the Swans, I wouldn’t have been forced to this point by Monica.” Michael said with certainty, “Leader, you know how rich the Swans are. If they really took out some money, we wouldn’t be able to win. I’m even wondering whether the Swans are helping Monica or deliberately targeting you. After all, the Swans have been in business for so many years. They wouldn’t really make a loss just because of friendship. If they didn’t have other motives, they definitely wouldn’t have taken it so far.”

Michael was deliberately creating other conflicts to clear his name.

Warren’s expression was extremely ugly.

Did the Swans really want to go against him so openly?! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He said coldly, “Michael, even if Monica has the Swans’ support, you have mine. I’ve even used so much of my power to support you. Do you think I can’t compare to the Swans?!”

Michael was embarrassed by Warren’s words.

He had only wanted to reduce his responsibility, but he did not expect Warren to misunderstand.

Of course, he did not dare to say that the Sanders could not compare to the Swans, so he could not say a word at that moment.

Warren no longer showed Michael respect. “Whether the Swans are helping Monica or not, I will judge that for myself. But Michael, you have now exhausted all my trust in you. I’ll decide whether or not the company needs more funds. Just wait and see!”

After saying that, Warren hung up the phone.

Michael was so angry that he wanted to throw his phone away.

He really wanted to kill Monica now.

He had originally thought that she was innocent and even stupid, but he never expected that she would become such a huge obstacle in his path to success!

His eyes suddenly narrowed.

‘Monica, don’t blame me for being cruel and merciless. You’re really asking for it.’

He sat down fiercely in his office with a very ugly expression.

At that moment, there was another knock on the door again.

Michael took a drag on his cigarette and shouted in a frighteningly cold voice, “What is it?!”

The assistant reported from outside, “The pharmacies we’re working with want to return the products. Moreover, it’s not just one company. They’ve teamed up with a few other companies and even threatened that they will make a big deal out of it if we don’t allow returns!”

“Let them be! They won’t gain anything even if they make a scene anyway!” Michael did not care.

“But...” The assistant was a little worried.

“Tell them that once they return the products, all of Sunny Pharmaceutical’s products will no longer be supplied to them! Cardellini Pharmaceutical will be finished sooner or later, so let them weigh it out themselves!” Michael instructed coldly.

“Yes.”

With that, the assistant left.

Having calmed down a little at that moment, Michael put out the cigarette.

He really could not mess up his part just because of Monica, and he would not be suppressed by Monica!

He took a deep breath and was ready to pick up the phone to make the call when the phone suddenly rang again.

Michael looked at the incoming call and quickly picked it up. “Leader.”

He thought that Warren had thought it through and would give him the funds.

After all, without the funds, the Sanders would lose three billion dollars, and they could not possibly pay for that.

However, as soon as he received the call, he heard Warren’s scolding. “Michael, I must have been blind to invest so much in you, to trust you so much with doing things for me. I even wanted to wait for the limelight to pass and support you again. However, you’re useless.”

Michael’s face turned red from Warren’s scolding.

He had no idea what he had done to deserve such a scolding from Warren.

“I’ve just asked someone to check. The Swans didn’t take out a single cent. They didn’t give any money in their account to Monica!” Warren said angrily, “If it were not for the fact that I no longer trust you and wanted to verify it, I would have been fooled by you again.”

Michael gripped his phone tightly and gritted his teeth. “If not for the Swans, no one would have Monica. I’m 100 percent sure that it’s the Swans. It’s definitely them!”

“Are you doubting me?!” Warren’s tone became solemn.

“No, I just think–”

“There’s nothing to think about! The truth is the truth, and the truth is that you can’t even deal with Monica, that useless woman, yet you still want me to give you power, status, and honor! Let me tell you, Michael. From now on, get out of my sight. I will never use you again!”
