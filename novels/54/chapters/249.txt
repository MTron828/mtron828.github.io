Monica left Fourth Master Swan’s Bamboo Garden in a frenzy.

In fact, at that moment, she wanted to thank God for his mercy!

At least, Fourth Master Swan had not left South Hampton City.

As long as he did not leave the city, there was still a glimmer of hope.

It would not make her despair!

Monica got into Micheal’s car, and he drove to the Swans’s main courtyard, Universe Garden.

This was the Swans’ old master’s place.

Normally, no one dared to come here directly. In fact, many people were afraid of this place.

Not only outsiders, but even members of the Swans would feel pressured when they appeared here.

At this moment, Eden was feeling a little uneasy. It was as if he had taken in a huge breath of cold air and could not breathe out. Even breathing was a little difficult for him.

In the Swans, Eden’s fourth uncle was very prestigious. Every time he saw his fourth uncle, he would feel a little frightened. However, his grandfather was the upgraded version of his fourth uncle. Other than his fourth uncle, most people in the Swans did not dare to provoke his grandfather.

At this moment, Monica did not care about her life and wanted to force her way in.

Eden gritted his teeth and was against it.

In the next second, he saw that Monica was really not afraid of death and directly rushed in.

She rushed into the hall of the Universe Garden.

The Universe Garden was a typical design of an ancient building. Everything was antique, and there was a bookish atmosphere. Every corner inside was filled with priceless antiques even if they looked like an unremarkable teacup or a fan.

Therefore, whenever the Swans were summoned here, they had to be careful. They had to be careful not to break the old master’s antiques. Even the youngest child in the family, Quinton, did not dare to make a ruckus here.

The hall was extremely quiet.

Monica had never been here before. She did not know what this place looked like.

She only felt that it was very gloomy in the middle of the night.

It was just like those old houses that were seen in TV dramas. Due to the dim light at night, it felt like a haunted house.

Of course, Monica was not in the mood to care about that at this time.

She could not help but shout loudly, “Grandpa Zachary!”

Eden was so scared that her heart was trembling.

Monica was not afraid of death!

Even after she shouted, Old Master Swan did not come out. Grandpa Wade, who had been serving by Old Master Swan’s side, came out instead.

Grandpa Wade was Nox’s grandfather, Wade Winter.

After Old Master Swan abandoned politics and went into business, Wade also left court politics and helped the Swans to conquer the business empire. Later, after Wade handed over some businesses to his son, he returned to Old Master Swan’s side and stayed with him.

Old Master Swan seemed to only trust Wade.

Except for Wade, no one could get close to Old Master Swan.

Of course, except for Old Madam Swan.

However, Old Madam Swan had passed away a few years ago, so the only person who could get close to Old Master Swan now was Wade.

Wade looked at the person and turned on the lights a little. “Why did you come here in the middle of the night to cause trouble?!”

“Grandpa Wade, I’m Monica, the daughter of Gary Cardellini,” Monica quickly introduced herself.

She knew Grandpa Wade. After all, he was Nox’s grandfather. Although Old Master Swan did not attend any business banquets or public events, nor did Grandpa Wade, she had seen him a few years ago on random occasions.

Monica had also seen him at Eden’s wedding the last time.

“The little daughter of the Cardellinis,” Wade replied indifferently, “What are you doing here so late at night?”

“I’m looking for Grandfather Zachary.”

“The old master is asleep. Come and look for him tomorrow instead.”

“Tomorrow will be too late. Grandpa Wade, I beg you, please let me see Grandfather Zachary. I really have something important to tell him!” Monica’s eyes were red.

Tears fell down her cheeks.

Wade was a little speechless.

This little girl cried the moment she arrived.

It made him a little overwhelmed.

He asked, “What is it?”

“Teddy said that Grandpa Zachary has locked up Fourth Master. I’m looking for Fourth Master and want to ask Grandpa Zachary to let him go...”

“No way!” Wade refused immediately. His expression instantly became serious.

How could Monica care so much? She went forward and tugged at Wade, “Grandpa Wade, I’m begging you. I only came to look for Fourth Master Swan because I encountered a big problem. If I can’t find him tonight, I’m really going to die!”

Wade looked at Monica speechlessly.

She indeed looked very miserable. It seemed that something had happened.
