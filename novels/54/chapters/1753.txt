Chapter 1754: Shelly’s Change of Heart Towards Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The thought of that disgusted him.

At the dining table, the two of them ate dinner quietly. Nox finished his share very quickly because he was starving, so Shelly went to get him a second serving. After Nox gobbled it all up, Shelly went to get him a third serving.

Just as Nox was about to wolf down the food, Shelly stopped him.” Nox, slow down. You’ll get a stomachache if you eat like this.”

She had a feeling that Nox swallowed his food without chewing.

Nox held himself back. Did he lose his image just now? He was trying hard to restrain himself, but he was really hungry, so much so that he could not control himself.

Moreover, Shelly’s cooking was really to his liking. Other than the two vegetables that he was not interested in, the grilled chicken and potatoes were his favorites.

“Eat slowly. Nobody will take it from you,” Shelly reminded.

Nox slowed down, and even though he was slower, he still ate a lot. After eating that plate of chicken, Nox handed the plate to Shelly.

Shelly looked at the empty plate. “You still want more?”

“Can’t I?” Nox asked, looking a little hurt. “I’m afraid you’ll overeat.”

“I’m just hungry.” Nox looked sad and aggrieved.

It made Shelly feel like she was abusing Nox by not giving him any more food. As such, she got up and went to get another serving of chicken for Nox. Just like that, Nox had emptied a huge tray of grilled chicken.

Shelly thought to herself, ‘Have I underestimated Nox’s appetite?’

Nox took the plate and lowered his head to eat again. He ate with relish. It was as if the dishes in front of him were not home-cooked dishes but delicacies. That was the first time she wondered whether her cooking skills were that good!

Nox finished his fourth serving. Although he felt full, he still wanted to eat more. After hesitating for two seconds, he handed the plate to Shelly. “More?” Shelly’s eyes almost popped out.

“I can eat,” Nox said tactfully.

“You’ve eaten four plates of chicken.” Shelly knew very well that she filled every plate for him.

“Yes.” Nox nodded as if to say, ‘Yes, I can eat more.’ “There’s no chicken left,” Shelly said bluntly.

Nox stared at Shelly.

“I cooked more than usual today because I thought you might eat more when you were hungry, but I didn’t think you could eat so much,” Shelly explained.

Nox felt a little embarrassed. In fact, he did not expect him to eat so much as well.

He said, “In that case, I’ll eat the potatoes.”

“Are you still hungry?” Shelly asked him seriously. “Do you want me to cook more for you? Or should I

make you some frozen sausages?”

“I’m not hungry anymore. I just felt like eating more.” Nox quickly said, “It’s too delicious.” Shelly’s heart skipped a beat. It was obvious that her mood had changed because of Nox?s praise.

She said, “Then have more food.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Nox was already eating the potatoes with relish.

Shelly watched him eat for a long time. She was afraid that he would get tired of just eating potatoes, so she said, “Nox, I still have some chicken. Do you want them? I’m not hungry. I snacked on some biscuits while waiting for you.”

Nox looked at the chicken on Shelly’s plate.

Shelly said, “If you don’t want it, forget it…”

“I don’t mind.” Nox quickly said, “I’m afraid you haven’t eaten your fill.”

“I’m full.” Shelly said, “If you don’t eat it, I’ll throw it away.”

Then, Nox took Shelly’s bowl without hesitation. Shelly only wanted to give Nox the chicken, but she did not expect Nox to take her entire plate.

She pursed her lips lightly, not knowing what she was feeling. Anyway, she did not dislike him for it.

Nox took Shelly’s plate and started eating again. It was as if he had not eaten food for hundreds of years. Finally, Nox finished eating. Not only did he finish his food, but he even ate all the vegetables in front of him.

“Are you full?” Shelly asked carefully.

Nox burped loudly in response, and Shelly could not help but laugh. Sometimes, she found Nox quite cute..
