Chapter 527: Finn, Let’s Get A Divorce

The scene suddenly fell silent.

Reese’s words shocked everyone, including Monica, who turned to look at Reese.

When she saw how emotional Reese was, something flashed in her eyes.

All she wanted was to explain things clearly instead of making the misunderstanding worse.

She turned to look at Finn, who was standing at the side, and saw him looking at her coldly.

However, she lowered her eyes and chose to help Michael get through the current situation.

“Mrs. Ross, is what you said true?” The reporter suddenly reacted.

“It’s true!” Reese said resolutely and then looked at Monica with anticipation. “Monica, tell the reporter. You and Finn got divorced a long time ago, right?”

Monica bit her lip, not knowing what to answer.

If she answered no now, Michael’s career would probably be dommed. However, if she had to answer yes, she did not know how she would face Finn.

“Monica, don’t be afraid. Tell the reporters that you and Michael aren’t having an affair. You’re a free woman and in a normal relationship with Michael,” Reese pleaded.

Monica bit her lip and nodded silently.

She knew what would happen if she nodded, but she could not refuse at that moment.

She was afraid that if she said no, Michael’s life would be over.

Before this, she could have cast aside their friendship and said that what Michael was facing now had nothing to do with her. However, if she exposed Reese’s lies now, everything Michael was facing would be tied to her. In that case, she would never be able to live in peace in the future and be with Finn.

Seeing Monica nod, Reese secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Then, she hurriedly said to the reporters, “If not for Michael’s father falling sick, Monica and Michael would have announced their engagement long ago. It’s only because of everything going on at home that they haven’t had the time to announce their relationship, and we didn’t expect you guys to make such a big deal out of it either.”

“But if the two of you are together, why didn’t you say so earlier? Why didn’t you say anything when Michael’s image was damaged?” the reporter asked.

“As I said, a lot of things have been going on at home, and Michael hasn’t had the time to deal with his personal matters. He also got into a car accident due to overwork today, and he hasn’t even had time to recuperate. What’s more, he still has a lot of things to do. But since you guys managed to catch us today, we might as well clarify things,” Reese explained imposingly.

She turned to Michael and said, “Michael, you need rest. Let’s go.”

Michael turned to look at Monica, and the guilt was visible in his eyes.

At the same time, Reese pulled Monica along. “Monica, get in the car.”

What she meant was that she had to leave with them.

Monica was a little hesitant, but she eventually followed them into Michael’s car.

The entire time, Finn looked at them coldly, watching as Monica walked into Michael’s car and left.

There were so many reporters, but none of them seemed to notice him. In fact, did they not notice him, or were they pretending not to?

After Michael’s car left, the group of reporters quickly left as well.

On the other hand, Finn continued to look in the direction the car was driving.

The chauffeur did not dare to interrupt and could only wait quietly by the side.

After a while, Finn looked back, opened the car door, and sat down.

On the surface, he looked calm.

…

Reese drove the car while Monica and Michael sat in the back.

However, Reese did not speak as if knowing that she had said something that she should not have. Hence, she kept quiet.

Michael did not speak either, and the same with Monica.

All she could think about was Finn, wondering if he was upset to see her leave with Michael.

However, she did not have the courage to call Finn and send him a message now as she did not know how to explain herself to Finn.

She even thought that she was a mess.

The car stopped at Michael’s apartment.

Michael did not live in the Ross family’s manor. After returning to China, he bought a house near his workplace.
