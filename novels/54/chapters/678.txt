Even though he seemed stern with her since she was young, as soon as Monica was hurt, Gary would unconditionally agree to all of her requests.

Ever since she was young, Monica was very much in control of that weakness of her fathers.

Gary said with an unpleasant tone, “How do you want me to help you?”

“Get Finn to come home tonight. Tell him you’re not feeling well and ask him to come over to take a look at you. I want to talk to him alone.”

“You’re tricking me!”

“What’s wrong with you sacrificing yourself for your daughter’s happiness? Anyway, even if Finn knows you lied to him, he can’t do anything to you because you’re his elder who brought him up.”

“You’re going to make me look bad!” Gary roared angrily.

“Well, you can’t look good forever.”

“Monica, why are you doing this to me?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Well, you’re my father. You should be grateful–”

“I dare you to say that again!” Gary threatened.

“Whether it succeeds or not, whether Finn and I can get back together will depend on you.”

Then, Monica hung up the call abruptly for fear that her father would go back on his word.

After hanging up the phone, her heart was still beating very fast, and all she had done was get Finn to her house.

In that case, how could she seduce Finn into her bed? Seducing him would be too difficult.

However, if she drugged him… Finn might beat her to death.

She hesitated for a moment, but in the end, she called a friend at the nightclub. “Wendy.”

“Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today? I can’t believe you’re finally calling me” The other party teased.

“When did I stop calling you? It’s just that my leg has been injured, and I can’t go to the nightclub anymore! Besides, you bunch of heartless people left me alone at the nightclub the last time. I almost couldn’t get home!”

The person on the other end of the call knew she was in the wrong and received Monica’s scolding.

“Forget it. I’m not a calculative person. The reason I called you today is to ask you if you...” Monica wanted to say something but hesitated. Then, she mustered up her courage and said, “Have you ever got someone to buy drugs for you before?”

“Drugs? What drugs?” The other person was surprised.

“The people who linger around at nightclubs? Don’t you know what I’m talking about?” Monica was flustered, and her face was red.

“Oh.” The person on the other side instantly understood. “What’s the matter? Do you want to cheer Director Ross up?”

“Don’t ask. Can you help me get it?”

“Yes, but there are many types of drugs. Which one do you want?”

“The kind that can make a man lose control.”

“Let me ask my friend.”

“Okay.”

Monica thought she would just prepare some. Whether she would use it or not, she would see how it goes later tonight.

With that, she spent the whole day preparing herself.

When nighttime came, her father also replied, saying that he would have Finn come to the house at around 9 p.m. and let her seize the opportunity herself. He would only help her this once.

By then, Wendy had sent her the drugs, saying it would be no problem for her to have sex with a man seven times in one night.

She also changed into the red lingerie Michael mentioned. She put on the sexy red halter-neck silk dress inside and wore a khaki trench coat over it.

Fortunately, it was already late autumn, and with Harken starting to get cold, she could hide her beauty inside.

Then, she would show everything to Finn.

She looked at the time. It was 8 p.m. in the evening and just the right time to go back now.

When she was in the taxi, her heart was beating very fast. However, at the thought of what would happen tonight, her heart beat even faster.

She was so nervous that it was written all over her face.

The driver looked at Monica through the rearview mirror and felt a little embarrassed. He said, “Miss, please relax. I’ve been driving for many years. It’s safe.”

Monica came back to her senses, wondering if she was that obvious.

Nevertheless, she silently told herself to calm down.

While trying to calm down, she saw her phone screen light up.

It was a message from Michael. “How is it? Is it going well?”

“I’m still on the way home. I’m nervous,” Monica replied.

“I’ll be waiting for your good news tonight.”

“Okay.”

Hopefully, it was good news.

The taxi arrived at the villa.

When Monica walked in, Finn had not arrived yet.

Her father gave her an attitude and even threatened her that this was the last time he would do that for her.

She figured that if she did not succeed this time, she would not be so thick-skinned as to do it again.

After saying that, her father returned to his room with her mother.
