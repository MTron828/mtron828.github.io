913 The Sudden Fire Rescue

There were three exits in the front, left, and right of them. The right side was blocked, as they had taken it earlier. The front exit was too far away, so it would be impossible to get out that way. They could only go left. However, the flames on the left side seemed to be very big. If this continued, it was very likely that they would be burned alive.

She did not expect that her wedding, one she had not anticipated, would end in such a situation. She could not imagine how so many things had happened.

Marriage was just a scandal at most. How could so many earth-shattering things happen?

If she died, Michael would definitely jump for joy. Was this retribution for exposing Michael?

“Cousin, I’m so scared. I’m so scared.” Sarah watched as the flames got angrier and angrier, with no sign of someone coming in to save them.

The wedding banquet hall seemed on the verge of collapsing. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Let’s go that way.” Monica felt that instead of waiting here, where no one could come in to save them, it was better to give herself a chance. Maybe she could find a way out.

They covered their mouths with their wet clothes with one hand and held each other’s hands with the other. Then, they half-squatted and walked out of the door on the left.

“Ah!” Sarah kept screaming.

The fire debris above their heads was falling more and more frequently. If they were not careful, they would fall on them. Monica kept walking, dragging Sarah with her.

“Ah!” Sarah and Monica were suddenly hit hard by fire debris. The two of them let go of each other’s hands, patting off the sparks on their bodies.

Fortunately, as their clothes were wet from the soda, the fire could not ignite. The two of them rolled on the ground until the fire was extinguished.

Monica’s body was in an even sorrier state now. She gritted her teeth and got up from the ground, even though she was already starting to despair. After all, with such a big fire, it was impossible to get out. The people outside could no longer enter either. However, she still wanted to give herself a glimmer of hope. Just in case a miracle happened.

She finally got up from the ground to help Sarah. Sarah, who was also covered in wounds, was almost out of breath from crying. She probably really thought she was going to die.

When Monica went over, she saw a figure appear through the flames. He was also drenched, probably from soda water. He had a large coat on, and some sparks were burning on it.

He walked over and seemed to glance at her. Then, he squatted down and picked Sarah up. Before he left, he threw the coat at her.

Monica’s eyes were still red, and her vision was blurry.

Had Finn come back to save… Sarah? Should she be grateful that he had at least been kind enough to give her a coat?

Her skin was now red from the heat of the wedding hall. There were even many blisters from burns, which looked very scary.

Though, she had nothing to fuss about. She did not have a relationship with Finn anymore, so it was only natural that he saved Sarah.

She crawled over and put on the coat that Finn had thrown at her. Then, she tried her best to walk out. She kept telling herself that she could not give up. If she did not give up, there might still be a trace of hope.

She walked on for a long time. However, it seemed that no matter how hard she tried, she could not reach the exit. Even her breathing had become weaker. She did not think she was going to make it. She laid on the ground, tears falling from her eyes.

She did not want to die. She really did not want to die...

She bit her lip and watched helplessly as a huge piece of fire debris fell from above, about to burn her body. She closed her eyes and chose to accept death.

Suddenly, her body was pulled up from the ground. Then, she rolled a few times to avoid the fire that was falling from above.

She looked up at the person in front of her.

“Don’t fall asleep!” She said.

The voice was very familiar, as was the face. Monica just stared at the person in front of her. There were several times when she nearly fell unconscious, but she forced herself to stay awake.
