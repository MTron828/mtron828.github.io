Chapter 728: The Family of Three

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Damn it.

What happened to Edward? He was not the same as the previous Fourth Master Swan!

George caught sight of Jeanne’s smile, and his face, which was scrunched up form the smell of carrots just a moment ago, disappeared when he saw his mother laughing.

He did not know why, but he had a feeling that his mother’s smile was genuine… happiness.

The family of three had a rather late but happy lunch.

Most importantly, they finished the carrots.

It was like Edward and George were competing with each other, not wanting to be outdone, and ate all the carrots. In fact, Jeanne liked carrots, but when she saw the two of them finishing them all, she did not know whether to laugh or cry.

After the meal, Jeanne cleaned up the table and washed the dishes.

Edward followed behind her, not leaving her side.

George was speechless at how clingy a grown man could be. Even he was not attached to his mother anymore!

Then, Edward hugged Jeanne from behind.

Jeanne was speechless.

“Help me put the dishes into the dishwasher.” Jeanne had to instruct Edward to do the work as she could not stand it anymore.

Edward hurriedly took the plates and utensils that Jeanne had rinsed and placed them into the dishwasher one by one.

The two of them cooperated rather happily while George sat on the sofa and just looked at them showing off their love for each other.

Once the plates and utensils were cleaned, Jeanne was about to leave the kitchen when someone stood in her way.

Jeanne frowned.

“Aren’t you going to praise me?” Edward asked.

‘Praise, my *ss!’ Jeanne thought.

At that moment, she saw Edward bend down.

Edward was really shameless. He had done such a small thing, yet he still had the cheek to ask for a reward!

The next second, she felt his lips on her lips, and the two of them kissed passionately.

George left the sofa in a huff.

He ran upstairs with his short legs and made a loud noise on purpose.

When Jeanne heard that, she immediately wanted to break free from Edward’s embrace.

She was so distracted by Fourth Master Swan... that she had forgotten that her own son was angry at her!

However, her actions were met with strong resistance from Fourth Master Swan.

He hugged Jeanne tightly and then pressed her on the counter in the kitchen, going deeper into the kiss.

Jeanne could only mumble and stammer.

Damn it. She did not know how she should face George now.

Edward only seemed satisfied after a long time and let go of her.

Jeanne stared at him angrily, but she had a bashful look on her face. She looked at Edward and threatened, “Try kissing me again.”

Edward endured it.

“Can you take into consideration George’s feelings? Is he even your biological son?” Jeanne was fuming.

Edward said, “He was just an accident.”

Jeanne was beyond speechless. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You’re my true love.”

After he finished his sentence, a kiss landed on her lips again.

Jeanne really wanted to beat Edward to death.

…

George finally understood that they had never been a family of three. Fourth Master Swan only cared about his mother!

Those father-son reunions on TV were all lies.

Lately, Teddy had painstakingly found many father-son reunion movies for him to watch. However, they were all bullshit!

George looked at Fourth Master Swan, watching as the latter cut the steak seriously.

Tonight’s dinner was three steaks, one for each person.

Fourth Master Swan cooked them, and it was he who pestered his mother to teach him how to cook.

Rather than saying it was to share the household chores, it was to pester his mother!

It was so that George could not get close to her for even a second.

“Am I handsome?” Edward suddenly said.

George was stunned.

Jeanne, who was eating the steak with her head lowered, also raised her head in surprise.

“There’s no need to be jealous.” Edward was cutting the steak slowly. “You look like me.”

“I’m not jealous, and I don’t want to look like you. I look like my mother!” George was infuriated.

He hated Edward so much that he did not want to look like the latter.

“If you have a younger sister, she’ll look like your mother,” Edward said naturally.

“I don’t want a sister,” George refused immediately.

“Oh, I’m not asking for your opinion,” Edward said. “I’m asking for your mother’s opinion.”

George was really pissed off by Fourth Master Swan.

They said that children were the heart and soul of parents, but he was nothing to Fourth Master Swan!

Jeanne could not stand it anymore. She touched George’s angry head and said to Edward, “You won’t have a daughter.”

Not only did George not like it, but most importantly, she had never thought of giving birth to another of Edward’s children!

In fact, she had never thought of having another child again.

“Oh,” Edward replied.

There was no emotion in his voice.

George felt that he had won, so his mood was much better.

Then, he cut the steak with great effort as it was a little hard to cut.

To him, it was still a little difficult to hold a knife and fork, especially with the steak today, which was a little too well done.

It was all because of Fourth Master Swan’s poor cooking skills.

George cut the steak fiercely.

“Can’t cut it?” Edward raised his head and glanced at George.

“No.” George tried to force himself to cut it.

“I’ve cut it,” Edward said.

As he spoke, he picked up his plate of beef, which had already been cut into small pieces.

George stared at Edward, who said, “But it’s not for you.”

Then, he placed the cut steak in front of Jeanne and took Jeanne’s plate for himself.

Jeanne was stunned.

Edward smiled. “Eat up.”

Jeanne pursed her lips and turned to look at George.

She could feel that at that moment, George was very close to killing Edward.

Jeanne did not understand why Edward would always try to anger George on purpose.

Could it be that Edward did not know how to get along with children?

While she was in her thoughts, Edward suddenly took the steak in front of George and cut it for him.

However, George did not accept it. “I can do it myself.”

“Your mother is the most important,” Edward said.

He meant that he would help her cut it first.

George bit his lip.

“Moreover, ladies first.” Edward quickly cut the steak and gave it to George. “Eat up.”

George seemed convinced by Edward.

Then, he lowered his head and ate the steak obediently.

As he ate, he raised his head. Before he could say “thank you”, he saw Fourth Master Swan take a piece of steak from his mother’s plate and feed it to his mother.

Even if his mother refused, she still had to eat it.

George knew that he should not have expected anything from Fourth Master Swan. The latter was just trying to snatch his mother away. He was just…

Yes, his birth was just an accident.
