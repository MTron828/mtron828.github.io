Chapter 667: The Shareholder Meeting, Huge Catfight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Michael drove Monica back.

When Monica got out of the car, Michael expressed how grateful he was to her again.

Monica smiled in response. Compared to her divorce from Finn to help Michael, that was nothing.

With that, she said a few polite words in return and walked into the neighborhood.

Michael looked at Monica’s back, and the smile on his face disappeared instantly. As he drove, he made a call. “Investigate Monica’s cousin for me.”

“Yes.”

“Find out if she really likes Finn and how much she likes him!”

“Yes.”

After giving his instructions, Michael hung up the phone.

The only way to make Monica give up on Finn was if Finn was already with another woman.

He could not let Monica resent him, so he could not rush it with Monica. Moreover, he knew very well that Monica had Jeanne by her side, whom he could not figure out, and Jeanne had Fourth Master Swan by her side. Therefore, it should not be difficult for Jeanne to discover his malicious intentions. On top of that, Monica had a deep relationship with Jeanne. If Jeanne asked Monica to do something, Monica would definitely do it. If he were not extra careful, he would immediately be exposed.

He had hesitated for a long time on the news this morning, but in the end, he chose to remove it immediately.

He was worried that Monica might be testing him.

He had a feeling that Jeanne would not sit idly by and do nothing about Monica’s matter. Who knows if she might have already begun to make her move?

After all, he could not get Monica by breaking Monica and Finn up. Instead, he had to make Finn distance himself from Monica. Once Monica knew it was impossible for her and Finn to be together, she would take the initiative to return to his embrace.

Therefore, Monica’s cousin might be useful!

…

In Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne was holding a senior management meeting.

During this time, because of the deaths of Jonathan and Alexander, Lawrence Enterprise had been on a repeated downfall. The stock market was currently fluctuating, and with the new blood in the senior management, everyone started to feel anxious.

Jeanne now needed to appease the people.

Halfway through the meeting, the conference room’s door was suddenly pushed open.

Jeanne’s eyes moved, and she saw Jenifer and Joshua at the conference room’s door. Then, she watched them enter the conference room without permission and walk in front of her.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

Joshua said, “I’m the chairman of Lawrence Enterprise. Shouldn’t you know your place, Director Lawrence?”

Jeanne sneered.

It seemed like Joshua was now using his identity as the chairman of Lawrence Enterprise to show off in the company.

Despite that, Jeanne stood up from her seat and gave up her seat. Anyway, Joshua would not be able to show off for long.

However, although she stood up, Joshua did not sit down. Instead, he said bluntly, “I don’t like to sit where others have sat.”

Jeanne looked at Joshua coldly.

It was the killing intent in her eyes that made Joshua feel a little terrified at that moment.

Then, at the thought that he had the most shares in the company, Joshua toughened up.

“So, what does Chairman Lawrence want?” Jeanne deliberately emphasized the word ‘chairman’ with obvious sarcasm.

Joshua pretended he did not hear it and said, “The shareholder meeting is making me anxious. This senior management meeting of yours... can be put on hold for a while.”

Jeanne’s expression was a little ugly.

“The meeting will start in five minutes, and I don’t want anyone to be late.” After that, Joshua and Jenifer left in a domineering manner.

Joshua had never been so tough in front of so many people before.

It was Eden who taught him those words and how to carry himself.

He felt that everyone in the room looked at him with admiration, and it was exhilarating!

Once Joshua left, Jeanne endured it and said, “Today’s meeting will end here. As for the specific work and arrangements, all of you can come up with your own plans first. After you’re done, I’ll meet with you one-on-one. Today, I just wanted to let everyone know that although many things have happened to the company lately, as long as I’m around, nothing will happen to Lawrence Enterprise. Please rest assured!”

“Yes.” The other senior management directors quickly agreed.

Most of the senior management directors were chosen by Jeanne, so naturally, they were loyal to her.

As Jeanne left the meeting room, the other senior management directors also left one after another.

Mason looked at Jeanne’s back and seemed deep in thought, while Quinn looked like she was watching a drama unfold. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

To be honest, she did not come to the Lawrence Enterprise to work because of the reason she gave when she applied for the job. She just wanted to know how powerful Jeanne was for her father to praise her!
