1225 George Breaks Down

“Dad likes you. He doesn’t like that woman at all!” George’s eyes were red as he told Jeanne loudly.

Jeanne was surprised by George’s reaction.

Ever since George was young, he had never disobeyed any of her requests. In fact, she rarely asked George for anything, but once she made a request, he would never refuse.

Today, he was probably angry.

From George’s tone, she could also hear his disappointment in her. However, she could not find any words to refute or persuade George at that moment.

It was true that Edward liked her. If he did not like her, he would not have done so much and to the extent that he forced himself into a desperate situation.

Now, how was she going to explain to George their helplessness?

If she said too much, she was afraid that George would hate Edward and that he would not be able to accept the reality of the world even though he would have to face more brutal things when he grew up.

Of course, she did not want George to be hostile in the family.

She hoped that her departure would not affect George’s development in this family.

She believed that Edward would not be prejudiced against George. Even if Edward and Susan had a child, she believed that Edward would treat George and the daughter in her belly equally. She was only worried that George would not be able to integrate himself.

On the contrary, she was not worried about the baby in her stomach. After all, the baby would be with Edward and Susan from the moment she was born. No one would tell her who her biological mother was, and she would not know who her biological mother was. Hence, she would live a good life.

Only George was the one she was afraid would bear a grudge against this family because of her and choose to be alone.

She had to admit that she was actually very grateful to Alex for telling her the plan in advance because then, she knew what she should do for this family for the next three precious months.

On top of that, she had to admit that Alex was smart. He was smart enough to know what kind of person she was and that she would do anything for George, the baby in her stomach, and even for Edward!

That way, at least when she was dead, everything would be under control.

She would make her own sacrifices for the sake of the living.

“Mom, you should have a good talk with dad.” When he did not get a response from Jeanne, George could not help but say, “When you were away, dad and I were dependent on each other. In fact, he really missed you, just like how I missed you. Sometimes, he would stare at your picture on his phone in a daze and tell me firmly that he would bring you back to us. I didn’t believe it. I always felt that you left, but his determination made me think that you would come back. In the end, you really did come back, and I thought you two were the most loving couple in the world. Although I was often jealous, I realized that I was actually very happy. I was actually very happy that you two could love each other, I–”

George was not someone who was good at expressing himself, but at that moment, he had said so much for her.

His eyes were filled with tears. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He was so young. He was only a seven-year-old child, but he was really worried about his parents.

Jeanne reached out to wipe his tears. However, at that moment, she decided otherwise because one day, he would have to wipe his own tears.

She said, “George, adults’ affairs are not as simple as you think. Edward and I have been through a lot, and we can’t be together anymore. I’m sorry I can’t give you a complete family, but I hope that you won’t be disappointed in this family because of my withdrawal. In fact, your dad really loves you.”

“I know he loves me.” George nodded hard. “I also know that you love me very much. I even know that you love each other. What I don’t know is why you guys have to do this now. Why do you want to leave when you both finally got together?”

“I told you–”

“I refuse to accept what you said. I don’t know why adults’ affairs are complicated. All I know is that all the children in the world can live with their parents, but why can’t I?” George was a little emotional.
