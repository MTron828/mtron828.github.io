Chapter 197: Fourth Master Swan Stands up for His ‘Wife’ on Court Day

Jeanne and Kingsley were on the phone.

Jeanne continued, “It’s not difficult to find evidence of Luna and Adrian colluding. Find Adrian’s wife. From what I know, Adrian and Luna have been colluding for many years. After so many years, I don’t believe that his wife didn’t find out. Women are more sensitive than Sherlock Holmes when it comes to men’s affairs. Adrian’s wife can be an effective witness to prove that he and Luna are colluding.”

“Okay.” Kingsley agreed immediately. “I’ll go and talk to Adrian’s wife.”

Jeanne said to Kingsley, “After everything is done, it can only prove that this matter is related to Adrian and Luna. I can’t completely get myself out of it. If Adrian insists that he is not on good terms with me anymore and sued me as a result, I won’t be able to escape unscathed. Moreover, I can’t let these two people end this matter just like that. Obviously, Adrian and Luna have no grudge against me. They wouldn’t frame me. There must be someone behind this.”

“So...” Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

“We have to find out who Adrian is receiving orders from. Actually, I know very well who it is. It’s Joshua.” Jeanne was very certain.

“The Lawrences are really disgusting.” Kingsley sneered.

“Joshua must’ve given Adrian some benefits for him to listen to him. Given Joshua’s IQ, he would definitely leave behind traces or transfer records. In fact, Adrian might have left evidence that would be beneficial to him in order to protect himself.”

“Alright, I’ll go and look for it.” Kingsley nodded.

“Well, this whole thing wasn’t instigated by Joshua.” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. “Joshua isn’t so smart to think of such a perfect plan. The person behind him is Eden, and the person supporting Eden is obviously Melody.”

“So you want to use this opportunity to get rid of Eden and… Melody!!”

“It might be very difficult,” Jeanne said, “Eden is much more sinister and cunning than Joshua. He might not leave behind any evidence against him. Joshua also couldn’t think of leaving behind any evidence for himself. Of course, before the matter is over, we can’t jump to conclusions so quickly. Who knows, we might find some evidence of a crime.”

Kingsley nodded. “Okay, I understand.”

“I still have four days,” Jeanne reminded.

“Since you know that your time is tight, why did you still hook up with Fourth Master Swan?!” Kingsley seemed to be unable to get over the relationship between her and Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

‘Did you think I wanted to do it?!

‘I was forced.’

“Alright, I’ll try my best to hurry up. I’ll call you when I have news.” Kingsley also seemed to be telling himself not to fuss over it.

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone.

This was all she could think of.

In order not to alert the enemy, she left everything to Kingsley to handle.

At least no one in Harken knew who Kingsley was.

…

At the Lawrence Enterprise, in Joshua’s office.

Joshua was calling Eden.

Eden immediately asked, “Did Jeanne go to the office yesterday?”

“Yes, she did. She came and gave me a hard time. Just thinking about it makes me angry!”

“Why did she go?” Eden was not worried about Joshua’s emotions at all. What he was worried about was whether Jeanne found any evidence during the few days that she was out.

“She went to the general affairs department to look for the contract. I asked, but she didn’t find anything and left dejectedly.”

“Did she do anything after that?”

“No.” Joshua was very certain. “She stayed at home with her son all the time. Other than eating time, she basically didn’t go out. I’m guessing that she wants to spend more time with her son now. Maybe she won’t be able to spend time with him in a few days.”

“Don’t let your guard down. If Jeanne makes any movements, you have to tell me immediately.”

“Okay.” Joshua agreed.

“Learn about Adrian’s movements and keep an eye on him.”

“Are you worried that Adrian will be threatened by Jeanne?”

“It’s not impossible.”

“Don’t worry, Adrian is an old man in the workplace. Doesn’t he know what’s more important?! Besides, if he admits that he framed Jeanne, wouldn’t that be a crime?!”

“Anyway, don’t make any mistakes. If we can’t take down Jeanne this time, don’t even think about it next time!”

“Brother-in-law, everything has been done so perfectly. Jeanne is definitely dead! You’re worrying too much. There are still three days left. Let’s just wait for Jeanne to be sentenced! When that happens, I want to see if she can still be arrogant!”

Eden still wanted to say something.

However, he felt that since this matter had reached this stage, nothing serious could happen.

He said, “In any case, call me if there’s anything.”

“Okay.”

After hanging up the phone, Eden’s lips curled into a cold smile.

He was also very eager to see Jeanne’s fate.

A tragic fate!

…

Four days passed in a flash.

In the morning on court day.

The headlines in South Hampton City were about Jeanne going to court today, and the news spread all over the city. Many people paid attention to it, and the news spread like wildfire.

Jeanne sat in Miles’s car and arrived at South Hampton City Court.

There were already many reporters gathered at the entrance of the court, and they all wanted to know the latest news.

Jeanne opened the car door and just got out.

The sharp-eyed reporters immediately saw her. In an instant, they swarmed over.

Miles stood in front to help Jeanne block the reporters.

Jeanne and Judah Smith, the lawyer Kingsley found, walked behind. Kingsley did not appear. With that, the three of them walked into the court with some difficulty.

“Ms. Lawrence, I heard that the facts of your crime are very obvious. Have you thought about how long you’ll be sentenced?”

“Ms. Lawrence, you’re known as a dark horse in the business industry. Now, for the sake of 30 million dollars, you have to bear this consequence. Do you regret it?”

“Ms. Lawrence, I heard that you were bailed by Fourth Master Swan to await trial. What’s the relationship between you and Fourth Master Swan?”

...

Jeanne did not want to answer and continued to walk forward with the lawyer.

The reporters were unyielding.

It was until someone suddenly called out, “Young Master Swan is here.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

‘Did Eden want to come to see my end?’

After all, Jeanne had not left her house for the past few days, so Eden was certain that she did not have any evidence!

At this moment, the reporters suddenly ran over from Jeanne’s side.

“Young Master Swan, are you here to observe Jeanne’s lawsuit?”

“Are you also worried about Jeanne?”

“What’s the relationship between your fourth uncle and Jeanne now?”

Eden was polite. He said, “My father-in-law has been unwell for the past two days and my mother-in-law is taking care of him at home. Hence, they asked Jasmine and me to come to observe Jeanne’s lawsuit and hope for a good outcome.”

“Young Master Swan, what do you think of Jeanne’s lawsuit?” The reporter asked.

“I believe that the law is fair. We’ll accept the verdict of the law.” Eden was smart enough not to express his personal opinion. He did not want any of his words to be misinterpreted by the media.

“I heard that your fourth uncle and Jeanne have a close relationship. Is that true?” A reporter asked impatiently. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Eden seemed to be a little silent. At that moment, he seemed to sigh helplessly and held Jasmine’s hand tightly.

Jasmine smiled at Eden, appearing very sweet.

The relationship between the husband and wife looked extremely good.

A reporter quickly flattered, “You look so sweet together.”

The other reporters also quickly echoed.

Eden said, “If Jeanne wasn’t so strong-willed, she wouldn’t have to face all this now. As for my fourth uncle and Jeanne, as a junior, I don’t have the right to say anything. Of course, I really don’t know what relationship they have.”

He first made his stance clear.

Then, he continued, “If Jeanne has some self-awareness, she should keep a distance from my fourth uncle. No matter what, my fourth uncle isn’t someone she can climb up to. I don’t even know what Jeanne has become abroad all these years. She became such a self-deprecating woman. I feel a little guilty about it. Back then, when I had a falling out with Jeanne, it caused her to give up on herself.”

He sounded regretful.

The reporters were even moved by Eden, who was acting like a good person at the moment.

Jeanne stood at the front steps for a while. She had also heard Eden’s words. At that moment, she could only sneer.

Some acts had gone too far and could no longer be stopped.

Jeanne stood up and prepared to leave. She did not want to hear Eden say anything hypocritical anymore.

All of a sudden, she heard a familiar voice behind her. The person said coldly, “Whether Jeanne is worthy of me or not, that’s something for me to tell the whole world, not you!”
