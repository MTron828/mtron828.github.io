Chapter 1401: Finn Drinking His Sorrow Away

Finn was speechless.

“Have you wooed Monica? Why are you worrying about me?”

Finn stopped talking and said to the waiter who had just walked in, “Open a bottle of red wine for us.”

“Why red wine? It’ll take so long to get drunk. By the time you’re getting a little tipsy, you’ll have finished your meal. How are you still in the mood to get drunk then?” Nox said bluntly, “Give me a bottle of tequila, the purest one you have. If the restaurant doesn’t have it, you can buy it at the convenience stores outside. It’s everywhere…”

Nox suddenly went quiet, seemingly shocked by something.

Finn, too, was surprised as he fixed his eyes on the waitress in front of him.

Although her looks had changed a lot, he recognized at a glance that the person in front of him was Shelly. He did not expect her to have had plastic surgery.

Shelly was also speechless. What kind of ill-fated relationship did they have to meet again?

She had originally planned to resign from her job as a waitress in the restaurant. If she had a fixed income as a tour guide, she could support her and Bella’s daily expenses. Fortunately, quitting beforehand gave her no sense of security, and before things were stable, she would not make a decision so easily.

At that moment, she was still glad that even though she had lost her job as a tour guide, she could still keep her previous job. However, she figured that if Nox still disliked her now, she would lose this job again.

She looked at Nox, who was looking back at her, and their eyes met.

Shelly asked, “Sir, is there anything else I can do for you?” No matter what, she still had basic professional ethics. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“That’s it.” Nox’s tone did not sound pleasant.

Shelly naturally did not say anything else and left respectfully. The moment she left the room, she could not help but take a deep breath.

She had no choice but to prepare herself to lose her job again.

Shelly walked to the front desk. “The guest in VIP room three wants a bottle of tequila.”

“Alright, I’ll get someone to get it immediately.” The receptionist quickly noted it down.

Just as Shelly was about to turn around to serve the dishes, she suddenly stopped in her tracks. “Can you put me in charge of another table?”

“What’s the matter?”

“I have some conflicts with the customers at the table I’m serving. I’m afraid it will affect our restaurant’s reputation.”

“I see.” The receptionist thought for a moment. “Wait a moment. I’ll change it for you.”

“Thank you.” Shelly was grateful.

The receptionist lowered her head and checked the current situation of the restaurant on the computer.

As if she had confirmed it, she picked up the microphone and said, “Jane, you and Shelly will switch tables.”

“Alright.” The other party did not refuse.

Then, the receptionist said to Shelly, “You and Jane will take over each other’s tables.”

“Thank you.” Shelly thanked the receptionist again.

After a brief handover with Jane, Shelly walked into another private room. Normally, if there were no special requests, full services would be provided in such a luxurious private room.

With that, Shelly pushed open the door and entered. However, the moment she entered, she was a little stunned again.

How bad was her luck? She had been living alone for so long, and during this period of time, she had met Nox and his fiancée, Zoe, frequently.

Most importantly, Zoe was having dinner with another man, and they were behaving intimately. To say that there was nothing between them… would be an understatement.

“Pour us some wine,” the man said.

Only then did Shelly come back to her senses. She hurried over and poured the red wine into the man’s and Zoe’s glasses.

Rich people were used to being served, so neither of them looked at Shelly. Meanwhile, Shelly stood behind them obediently, ready to serve them at any time.

“What have you been busy with recently? It took so long to ask you out on a date,” the man asked as he drank.

“I’ve been busy with work. What else do you think I’m busy with?”

“I thought you were busy dating other men.” The man smiled lewdly.

“Come on, with my current relationship with Nox, I don’t have time to date other men. It’s hard for me to even find time to see you.” Zoe was very straightforward. She did not have the nobility of a rich young lady at all. “You don’t know how strong Nox is in that aspect.”

“Stronger than me?” the man asked unhappily.

“He’s the kind that I think about every day,” Zoe explained.

“Nonsense. Don’t you know what kind of man Nox used to be? When he was a playboy, even I have to bow down to him.”.
