Chapter 59: George Slaps Everyone in the Face

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the interview hall.

Jeanne only spent ten minutes indeed.

After that, for a long time, no one said a word.

The female principal was obviously shocked and speechless.

After a long time, the female principal pushed her glasses and let herself look very calm as she said, “Not bad.”

The corners of Jeanne’s mouth lifted slightly.

“Go out and wait for your notice.”

Jeanne did not say much.

She held George’s hand and walked out.

“Wait.” The female principal called out to them.

Jeanne turned around.

“Do you think you can play the role of a mother and a father by yourself?”

“Of course.”

The female principal nodded. She was trying to find a way out for herself.

Jeanne held George’s hand and returned to the hall to wait.

Phoebe looked at them with disdain. They came out after entering for a short while. They were obviously here to humiliate themselves.

About two hours later, the female principal came out to announce the results in public.

At this time, the venue was very quiet. Most of the people were nervous.

The female principal read out the name list one by one in a serious manner. “Quinton Swan, Charles James, Sherry Baker...”

Phoebe was very nervous.

Only 30 students would be accepted for this batch, and there were more than 100 people in the hall.

Phoebe’s heart was beating very fast.

In the end, Paul’s name was still not announced.

After the female principal finished reading out a long list, she took a deep breath and said, “The last quota...”

The entire hall became even more nervous.

After all, most of the children here had not had their names announced.

Phoebe had a look of anticipation…

“George Lawrence.”

The entire hall was in an uproar.

Everyone’s gaze turned to Jeanne and George.

In an instant, they became the focus of attention.

The female principal appeared very serious as she continued to say, “Congratulations to the students whose names have been called for admission to our school. The school semester starts next Monday. Before admission, you need to complete the admission procedures. The staff of our school will inform you one-on-one about the relevant matters. Thank you for your participation. Goodbye.”

After saying that, she turned around and was about to leave.

“This is unfair!” A person suddenly shouted in the hall.

The female principal turned around and stopped.

“I seriously doubt the results of the interview at Angerburg are fair!” A man suddenly stood up in the hall and said fiercely.

The female principal’s expression was unsightly. “Since the founding of our school, we’ve always upheld fairness. Do you have any objections?”

“How can an illegitimate child from a single family be selected?! Is there some underhanded operation in Angerburg?!” The man was extremely sarcastic. It was obvious that he was saying that George had pulled some strings.

The other people who were not selected also started to agree. “That’s right. How can someone like that be chosen? How can my son not be chosen?!”

“If you don’t give us an explanation, none of us will leave!”

The scene was a little chaotic.

Phoebe was also among the crowd, and her voice was unusually loud, “The key is that he’s useless. Why is he allowed to enter Angerburg instead of my son?! I’m not convinced!”

Not only those who did not pass the interview but some who did also said, “If you let my daughter and that illegitimate child be classmates. I’m afraid that her character will be ruined!”

In the noisy hall, Jeanne and George, who were being questioned, were very calm.

Edward, who was sitting not far away, was also very calm.

On the other hand, Nox could not sit still any longer.

Edward’s “wife” was being bullied, yet he was actually so indifferent.

At the scene, the female principal’s face darkened, and she shouted, “Silence!”

The entire place fell silent.

“Angerburg is an international first-class school. Even if the children of Harken’s imperial family enter the school, they’ll be treated equally!” The female principal said coldly, “Regarding George’s admission, we’ve followed the proper procedures to select him...”

“What right does he have to be selected?” Phoebe was very agitated. “He doesn’t know anything. What isn’t my son selected when he’s skilled at everything?!”

The female principal glanced at Phoebe.

Jeanne also glanced at her.

Phoebe could still pretend that they were all relatives in the Lawrence family’s manor, but when it involved her own interests, her greedy face was revealed.

“To be honest, I live with George now. I know him very well. He reads children’s books and plays games on his phone every day. I’ve never seen him study hard. When my son was preparing for the interview, George was just playing!” Phoebe said loudly, “If such a person can go to Angerburg, why can’t the rest of us?!”

“Such a person...” The female principal’s eyes narrowed under her glasses. “Are you sure George doesn’t know anything? !”

“He doesn’t know anything!” Phoebe said fiercely, “It’s a joke that he came for the interview. Now, Angerburg actually accepted him. Does this mean that Angerburg, a prestigious school, is just a joke? And the rest of us working so hard to prepare for this school is also a joke...”

“Enough!” The female principal could not listen any further. She looked at Phoebe coldly and asked, “How many languages does your son know?”

Phoebe was stunned for a moment before she answered loudly, “He has been learning another language since he was young. He can now converse smoothly in that language.”

“George knows five languages.”

“Impossible...”

“What level is your son’s piano?”

Phoebe quickly answered, “My son’s violin is currently at level 5.”

“George is a level 10 professional.”

Phoebe had heard that George was very good at playing the piano. “Angerburg isn’t an art school. Knowing how to play a musical instrument is just a bonus but not mandatory.”

“Can your son write code?”

“Code?”

“George just used two minutes to hack the internal network of Angerburg.”

“...” Phoebe did not know what to say.

“Does your son know how to solve advanced math problems? Not simple math problems, but a research-level math problem that hasn’t been solved by anyone from Angerburg even after years of training. George solved it.”

“...”

“Do you know what photographic memory is?” The female principal looked at Phoebe coldly. “Let me show you.”

The female principal asked her assistant to take out a few books.

She said to George, “George, come up.”

George looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne nodded.

George walked up.

The female principal placed the books in front of everyone. “Three dictionaries from different countries. For fairness, in case you suspect any underhanded operation of Angerburg, come up.”

She pointed at Phoebe. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Phoebe gritted her teeth and went up.

“You can flip through three pages of each dictionary,” the female principal ordered.

Phoebe did as she was told.

“George, take a look,” the female principal said.

George took a few looks at each of the dictionaries, and he really just took a few looks. It was as if he only glanced through.

“Are you done?” The female principal looked at George.

George nodded.

“Listen carefully!” The female principal looked at Phoebe and then turned to George. “Recite it.”

George recited everything he had just seen in three languages to everyone without missing a single word. One of them had a note that was written, and he also recited it.

Everyone was shocked.

Phoebe could not believe it at that moment.

“By the way, does everyone know about the Mensa organization?” The female principal was very calm. After all, she had just been slapped in the face. She said, “It’s a global high IQ club and has an entry requirement of 148 IQ and above. George is one of the members, and he’s ranked eighth. So far, he’s the only underage member in the world to be on the top ten list of Mensa! So... any objections?!”
