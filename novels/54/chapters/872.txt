873 Accumulating Power, Return to South Hampton City

“Alright,” Monica said with a firm attitude.

Jeanne was worried and gave Monica a lot of instructions before finally putting down her phone. She was still in Lucy’s room on the Delta island.

Lucy sat on the balcony and looked at Jeanne with a faint smile full of charm. After Jeanne ended the call, sat down in front of Lucy.

She had been spending a lot of time with Lucy recently. The assassins of the Delta had changed a lot. Many of the people that Jeanne was once familiar with had become new faces.

She was not used to it.

“I look forward to your daily phone calls to hear how Monica slaps Michael in the face,” Lucy joked.

With that, she made Jeanne a cup of black tea. In the Hills, they could still enjoy everything that they should.

There were some low-level assassins here. However, if they still could not reach the standard of a typical assassin even after training, they would be brought to the Hills’ to be servants. The assassins would fight to the death outside, but once they returned here, they could enjoy heaven on earth. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This was probably the reason why there were so many assassins, but almost none escaped. Of course, the price of sneaking away was also very high, and few assassins dared to try.

Jeanne took a sip of the tea from Lucy. She felt that these peaceful days would not last for long.

It was always calm in the eye of the hurricane.

“Eldest Young Lady, Miss Harmon.” A servant knocked on the door respectfully.

Jeanne’s lips curled into a smile as she sipped her tea. Many things were about to happen.

Lucy responded.

“Mr. Hill wants to see you in his room.”

“Alright.”

Lucy put her teacup down and looked at Jeanne’s nonchalant expression.

“Let’s go,” she said.

Jeanne stood up, and the two of them walked into Kingsley’s room.

The person following Kingsley was none other than Melinda. She stood behind Kingsley, looking very respectful.

Kingsley went straight to the point. “I’ve found some clues regarding the Duncans’ descendant.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. Lucy looked very serious as well.

“Do you remember when I told you that Finn disappeared for two hours?” Kingsley asked Jeanne.

She nodded.

“Through the analysis and elimination of the big data, we can finally confirm where Finn had disappeared to then.”

Jeanne stared at Kingsley intently.

“A private villa in the southern suburbs,” Kingsley said. “When we got there, there was no descendant of the Duncans in the villa. However, we found a strand of his hair. He had left his DNA on the scene.”

Jeanne and Lucy listened in silence. They were waiting for Kingsley’s instructions.

“With his DNA, it will be easier to find this person,” Kingsley made clear. “On the 15th of next month, Michael’s wedding will be held.”

Jeanne’s expression changed slightly.

“The Sanders suspect that the Duncans’ descendant will appear, so they asked us to investigate them one by one,” Kingsley said.

“What do you mean?” Jeanne could not help but ask.

She didn’t want anything to disrupt her and Monica’s plan.

“For the Duncans’ descendant to be able to return to South Hampton City so quietly without leaving any traces behind, the Sanders felt this person did not appear and disappear out of thin air but rather replaced someone’s position. To put it bluntly, this person may have already been around even before the Duncans’ descendant appeared. After the Duncans’ descendant appeared, they immediately banned him. This way, no matter how we investigate, we would not be able to find this person.”

Jeanne frowned.

The possibility of this was indeed very high. After all, the human skin mask had already been developed to a near-perfect state. It had even allowed Mason to deceive everyone.

“What I meant was, we’re going to investigate them one by one to see who the descendant of the Duncans banned.”

Jeanne understood what he meant. It was to dig out everyone in South Hampton City and search for them one by one. Even though the workload was a lot and the difficulty level was high, this was probably the only way the Sanders could think of. The Duncans had really pushed the Sanders to the extreme.

Kingsley nodded his head slightly. “Let’s investigate the upper-class society first, which means those who have come into contact with Fourth Master Swan. Since the descendant of the Duncans chose to come back, he must have had some achievements. I don’t think they would hide him as a small fry, so we will first investigate the famous. Most people from the political and business world will be attending Michael’s wedding. It’ll be the best way to save our time since everyone will be gathered together at once, so we’re all going back.”
