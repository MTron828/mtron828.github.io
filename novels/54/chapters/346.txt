Chapter 347: Madam, Missus, Wife, or Jeannie?

Seeing them come down at that moment, George looked even more displeased. He turned his head arrogantly and ignored them.

Jeanne, too, felt a little guilty because she had not been with George all of yesterday and today.

She had even thrown him aside.

Therefore, she went over and sat beside George, who maintained his silence and appeared very cold.

When Teddy saw them, he quickly stood up. “Fourth Master, Madam.”

From Ms. Lawrence, it became Madam. However, Jeanne remained calm.

Teddy said respectfully, “The food is ready. Would you like to eat now?”

“Yes.” Edward nodded.

With that, Teddy left.

Jeanne focused her attention on George, who was obviously a little angry. She smiled. “Did you sleep well last night?”

George’s little face twisted a little in response. It seemed he did not sleep well at all.

His tender voice sounded unhappy. “Why did you send me away?”

She was not the one who sent him away.

......

“You promised that even if you married Fourth Master Swan, you would not abandon me.” George questioned, “Why did you send me away on the first night?!”

“I’m sorry,” Jeanne apologized.

George’s small brows furrowed.

“It won’t happen again,” Jeanne said with an expectant look in her eyes, hoping for forgiveness.

George, who was very angry, thought he would ignore Jeanne the entire day today. However, seeing Jeanne’s sudden show of weakness, he compromised.

He bit his small lips stubbornly.

Jeanne said, “Last night...”

She did not know how to explain it to George, but she had to promise him. “It won’t happen again.”

Even so, George still did not relent.

At that moment, Edward, who was sitting next to Jeanne, suddenly said, “You have to understand your mother.”

“Why should I understand her?” George threw a tantrum.

He was fine with Jeanne, but he was really angry with Fourth Master Swan.

However, Edward did not seem to mind.

Instead, he said by enunciating each word clearly, “Because your mother and I are going to give you a little sister.”

Jeanne was speechless. When did she say she was going to give him a little sister?

George’s eyes widened.

At that moment, he was clearly shocked.

“Don’t you want a little sister?” Edward seduced him.

George did not speak.

“She’ll be very cute and soft. She’ll even call you big brother in her baby voice,” Edward continued.

It was obvious that he was looking forward to it.

George shook his head and rejected him coldly. “I don’t like little brats.”

Edward smiled. He was not angry at all and even looked good when he smiled.

“It’s alright. I like it,” Edward replied.

George thought, ‘What does that have to do with me?’

He did not like Fourth Master Swan to begin with, and now he did not like him even more.

“Otherwise, why do you think I like you so much?” Edward said in a gentle tone.

George was stunned, and the next second, his face turned red.

The redness on his small face was very obvious, but he still looked good.

Edward touched George’s small head and said, “Of course, the person I like the most is still your mother.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

How could Fourth Master Swan flirt so naturally?

Fortunately, Teddy came over at that time.

Otherwise, Jeanne had a feeling that she, too, would blush. Was the guy planning to kill all of them, young or old?

Teddy said respectfully, “Fourth Master, Madam, the food is ready.”

Edward held Jeanne’s hand and stood up.

“I didn’t know when Fourth Master and Madam would wake up, so the Young Master and I went ahead and ate first.”

“Okay.” Edward nodded.

Then, he walked toward the dining room while holding Jeanne’s hand.

Teddy wanted to follow, but Edward suddenly said, “Teddy, take good care of the Young Master.”

It meant that he should not follow them.

“Yes.” Teddy immediately stopped in his tracks.

Jeanne turned her eyes to the side to look at Edward.

Seeing that Fourth Master Swan was now calling George Young Master, it seemed he had really accepted George and her.

They sat at the dining table, both famished.

On the day of their wedding yesterday, they ate very little because they were too busy. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, they had consumed a lot of energy last night in bed… and they slept for an entire day today.

Jeanne was so hungry that she buried her head in her food, gobbling it all down.

She did not want to hide her hunger either.

Then, she felt a burning gaze staring at her and paused.

She put down her chopsticks, took a napkin, and wiped the corner of her mouth elegantly. Her civilized and polite look was a drastic change from her gobbling down her food just now.

She wiped the corner of her mouth and looked up. “Fourth Master, what are you looking at?”

“Ed,” he said.

“Huh?” Jeanne startled.
