Chapter 251: Finn Shows up Amidst Many Obstacles

At this moment, Monica was crying as if the sky was falling.

Wade asked, “Why are you looking for Fourth Master Swan?”

“Can you let me see him? I want to tell him in person.”

Monica had a feeling that if she told these people that Jeanne was in trouble, they would be indifferent.

Only Fourth Master Swan would go all out to save Jeanne.

Thinking of this, Monica became even more agitated. “Grandpa Wade, I beg you to let me see Fourth Master, okay? I’m begging you. I really have something very important to tell him...”

Monica cried as she spoke.

It made Wade waver a little.

However, at the end of the day…

Edward was being punished by the family tonight, so Wade would not let Monica see him just like that.

Principles were always more important than feelings!

Wade remained silent and indifferent.

Monica was on the verge of breaking down.

She saw that Grandpa Wade had no intention of letting her see Fourth Master Swan, so she directly rushed into the hall without thinking. She did not know where Fourth Master Swan was, but he was definitely here. She searched room by room and believed that she would eventually find him.

Monica’s impulsiveness scared Eden to death.

He shouted, “Monica, don’t act recklessly!”

How could Monica listen to him?

Right now, she only wanted to find Fourth Master Swan.

Nonetheless, just as she headed toward the bedrooms, she was suppressed by a powerful aura.

It was the kind of aura that was not visible but threatening.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

She looked at the old man who was standing not far away.

Monica looked at his cold face as he stood there silently and stared at her.

She took a deep breath and felt that the person in front of her was giving her a death stare.

It made her feel numb all over.

She did not care anymore and just went straight over.

Eden looked at his grandpa standing in the corridor from afar. He did not dare to breathe loudly nor approach him.

“Grandpa Zachary, I’m looking for Fourth Master Swan. Let me see him.”

“No!” Old Master Swan’s deep voice was strong.

“Grandpa Zachary...”

“Wade, send the guest off,” Old Master Swan ordered.

Without any hesitation, he turned around and left.

“Grandpa Zachary.” Monica grabbed Old Master Swan.

Just as her hand approached, Old Master Swan waved his hand.

Monica was sent flying a few steps.

She was stunned.

Zachary was already so old, so where did he get such strength?

Monica looked straight at Old Master Swan.

Old Master Swan’s face was cold.

He was scary enough even when he was expressionless, not to mention that his expression was quite unsightly at the moment.

Eden really wanted to leave.

Micheal was also a little anxious at this moment.

He had never seen Old Master Swan before.

Old Master Swan was like a myth in their generation.

When Micheal saw him occasionally, he would look at him from afar. He had never been so close to him before.

Due to Old Master Swan’s legend, everyone was afraid of him and did not dare to act rashly.

Only Monica.

It was unknown whether Monica was simply too naive or just too anxious to care about anything. After Old Master Swan pushed her away, she pounced on him again.

This time, she was very smart. She did not pull Old Master Swan’s hand. Instead, she pounced on the ground and hugged his calf.

Everyone was stunned.

This was a funny scene.

Old Master Swan’s expression was obviously even uglier.

Even so, Monica hugged Old Master Swan’s leg tightly and refused to let go. “Grandpa Zachary, if you don’t let me see Fourth Master Swan, I’ll continue to pester you. I’ll continue to pester you so that you won’t be able to go anywhere.”

Old Master Swan’s face darkened.

To show her determination, Monica hugged his leg even tighter.

At this moment, there was a sudden stalemate for a few seconds.

When no one knew what would happen next, they heard Old Master Wade say coldly, “Wade, drag her away!”

Wade was also dumbfounded by the scene.

He had followed Old Master Swan for decades, but no one had dared to get so close to Old Master Swan.

Fourth Master Swan was the closest person to Old Master Swan among so many people. Despite that, when he faced Old Master Swan, he was also respectful and kept a distance.

“Wade!” Old Master Swan’s face turned ugly again.

Wade came back to his senses.

He quickly went over and squatted down to pry Monica’s arm away.

“Grandpa Wade, go away. I won’t let go of Grandpa Zachary even if I die. Go away...”

Old Master Swan’s face turned completely dark.

This was the first time he was being pestered like this.

What was more, Monica was a junior. Otherwise, he would have kicked her away long ago.

“Little girl, let go, let go. Let’s talk nicely,” Wade advised.

He was worried that if Old Master Swan were furious, Monica’s body would not be able to take it.

“I won’t let go. If you don’t let me see Fourth Master Swan, I won’t let go even if I die!” Monica was like a sloth, hugging Old Master Swan’s calf tightly.

Old Master Swan even moved a little, but Monica hugged him tightly and was dragged away by him.

Wade could clearly feel his old master’s growing anger.

“Little girl, listen to me and quickly let go!” Wade advised kindly!

“I won’t let go!” Monica would not let go even if she died.

She looked like she was ready to die.

“Wade! Are you weak?!” Old Master Swan was mad.

Wade was also speechless. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The old master did not want to help the little girl and made him the villain instead.

Wade was helpless.

He did not dare to disobey his master’s order.

Wade’s eyes narrowed.

He suddenly tightened his grip on Monica’s wrist.

“Ah!” Monica screamed.

It hurt so much that tears flowed down her face.

She suddenly let go of Old Master Swan.

At this moment, her wrist seemed to have lost all its strength and fell naturally.

Micheal quickly went forward to protect Monica. “Monica.”

Monica cried as she shouted at Old Master Swan’s departing figure, “Grandpa Zachary, if you don’t let me see Fourth Master Swan, I won’t leave tonight. I’ll make it so that you can’t sleep nor rest...”

“Wade, throw her out!” With that, Old Master Swan left.

He did it neatly.

Before Monica could react, she felt her arm suddenly pulled by Grandpa Wade. He pulled her up and walked out.

Micheal paused. At this moment, he just let Wade drag Monica out.

“Grandpa Wade, let me go! Let me go!” Monica could not move as Wade was restricting her.

Her arms seemed to have no strength, and she could not resist at all.

“Old man, let me go, let me go. You’re so old, yet you still dare to bully a child like me. Do you have any shame? Let me go—ah!” Monica was so angry that she did not know what to say.

Wade was rendered speechless by Monica’s words.

He pulled Monica out of the hall and forcefully threw her out.

Monica lost her balance.

She almost fell to the ground.

Micheal hurriedly went over and reached out to catch Monica.

A man suddenly appeared behind Monica and hugged her in his arms.

Monica was shocked.

She knew who it was before she even saw him.

It was clear that the two of them had not been in close contact for a long time, but she still knew.

Monica’s eyes twitched.

She turned around and saw Finn suddenly appear in front of her!

Just now, when she needed him the most…

What was he doing here now?!

He had not even changed out of his surgical gown and appeared here just like that!
