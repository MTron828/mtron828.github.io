Chapter 217: She and Fourth Master Swan Won’t Be Together

“Then send me back first,” Monica said

“Okay.”

Jeanne nodded.

“Speaking of which, when we eat together, Kingsley will be there, right?” Monica’s face was full of anticipation.

Jeanne was speechless.

‘Is Kingsley that charming?!’

Not to mention that he attracted both men and women.

It seemed that anyone from the age of 8 to 80 could not help but have a good impression of Kingsley.

“Before I leave, I’ll take the initiative to invite you to have dinner with me, Monica.” Kingsley smiled. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Kingsley was just like that. When he smiled, it was as if there were stars in his eyes. He was old, but he could make a woman’s heart flutter. Those who did not truly understand him would never know that behind his gentle and elegant charm, he was cold-blooded when he killed people.

“You’d better not be seduced by him,” Jeanne reminded Monica.

Monica was stunned. She said seriously, “Am I such a flirtatious woman? I have someone I like.”

“Oh, I’m just reminding you,” Jeanne said. “After all, Kingsley’s woman...”

Monica looked at Jeanne.

Her face was full of curiosity.

“Forget it. You won’t know her anyway.” Jeanne smiled faintly.

Monica was tickled by Jeanne’s words.

What exactly did Jeanne experience all those years abroad?

Monica always felt that Jeanne had become very deep.

It was as if Jeanne had hidden many secrets.

It made Monica feel that Jeanne’s life at the moment was different from that of an ordinary person.

Monica still wanted to say something, but the car had arrived at her house.

She endured it and finally got out of the car.

Jeanne watched Monica leave.

She turned around and let Miles drive away.

There were many things that she did not want to involve Monica in.

Monica should be protected.

Jeanne could not drag Monica into terror.

The car drove toward the hotel where Kingsley was staying.

Once Monica left, the atmosphere in the car was obviously much stiffer.

George was usually quiet.

He had seen too many things since he was young, so he was not surprised when things happened.

“What do you plan to do next?” Kingsley asked.

He asked Jeanne seriously.

He was completely different from the gentleman he was earlier.

Kingsley was still kind and amiable most of the time. He was rarely so harsh.

For instance, he would only be harsh toward Jeanne.

As long as she did not meet his requirements, he would reveal his true nature.

Fortunately, Jeanne had gotten used to it after all these years.

She looked out of the window and leaned against her seat. She said calmly, “I’ll have a showdown with the Lawrences.”

“How?” Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

“This time, the matter of the logistics warehouse is definitely related to Joshua. We have all the evidence. We only need Adrian to admit it. However, undeniably, as it wasn’t exposed in court, a lot of things will happen later. Of course, I don’t think that Adrian can be completely threatened by them. That said, I don’t want to waste time on these unimportant matters. After all, I can take Joshua down anytime I want. I’m not in a hurry.

“So, I plan to use Joshua to exchange shares with Jonathan in private,” Jeanne said, “To me, the most important thing is to take down the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“You just have to think it through.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

The car arrived at the hotel.

Kingsley turned his head. “Are you going to the Lawrences’ manor now?”

“I don’t want to keep thinking about it,” Jeanne replied.

“Okay.”

“When are you leaving?” Jeanne asked.

“In these two days.”

“Let’s have dinner together tomorrow night. I’ll ask Godfather to join us. No matter what, I still have to do my part as the host now that you’re here in South Hampton City.”

Kingsley finally smiled.

He said, “You’re still quite sensible.”

With that, he got out of the car and left.

The car left again and headed to the Lawrences’ manor.

George sat next to Jeanne. At this moment, he could not help but ask, “Mom, when can we leave this place?”

“You want to leave?” Jeanne asked.

“Yes.” George nodded. “I want to leave with Kingsley. I still think it’s better to live with Kingsley.”

“I think so too.” Although Jeanne had a lot of opinions about Kingsley, wherever he was seemed to be where they belonged, “But there are still a lot of things that haven’t been settled yet. If you feel unhappy staying here, you can go back with Kingsley this time. I’ll go back once I’m done with things here...”

“Forget it then.” George refused her outright.

Jeanne frowned.
