Chapter 335: The Wedding: Jeanne, My Heart!

She was also looking at Fourth Master Swan at that moment.

Today, he was in a white suit. The workmanship and embroidery were exquisite, but the most important thing was that they matched hers.

It was also her first time seeing him wearing full white, which suited him very well. In fact, it made him look even more handsome and his already eye-catching presence a little more ostentatious.

She did not know how to describe his good looks. However, she felt that, at that moment, Edward was the most handsome man in the country.

“If you like it, you should express it.” Nox, who was in the passenger seat, suddenly teased.

The two people, who were having a moment, were disturbed again.

Nox did it on purpose as he found the two too reserved.

To be honest, any man would want to sleep with Jeanne tonight, especially with her getup today.

She looked graceful and elegant, dignified and beautiful, with a hint of charm that made men want to pounce on her.

He did not know how Fourth Master Swan could be so patient.

If it were him, he might have started the moment he got into the car…

Yes. It was inappropriate for children, so he could not say much.

After all, that brat George was still around.

......

He had stayed by Jeanne’s side quietly the entire time, and at that moment, he was also sitting beside Jeanne without saying much.

The atmosphere in the car was unusually quiet.

Jeanne glanced at Nox, who pretended not to see her.

Edward said, “Ms. Lawrence, don’t move.”

“Huh?”

Jeanne was stunned. Was the makeup on her face smudged?

Suddenly, Edward leaned in toward her.

As his face got closer, Jeanne’s heart began to race. It seemed especially easy today for her heartbeat to accelerate.

The next second, she felt Fourth Master Swan’s kiss on her lips, and at that moment, her heartbeat was pounding.

However, George was still around.

Putting aside Monica’s prank just now, which was mostly for fun, this was… not. Still, her body refused to listen to her commands, not allowing her to dodge or push away.

In fact, the moment Edward leaned in toward Jeanne, his other hand covered Jeanne’s eyes, and he kissed Jeanne’s soft lips without holding back.

Nox took a look behind him and then turned back, placing his hand on the back of his head.

Fourth Master Swan had really fallen in love with Jeanne!

He did not know if it was true, but it was worth celebrating.

…

Soon, the car soon arrived at the Swan family’s manor, where many people had gathered.

Compared to Eden’s and Jasmine’s wedding, there were a lot more people.

As soon as the wedding car arrived at Universe Garden, Edward pulled Jeanne out of the car, and George followed by their side.

Edward whispered in Jeanne’s ear, “Let’s greet the Old Master first.”

Jeanne nodded and walked in while holding George’s hand.

George was a little unhappy. After all, for the entire morning, that was the only time she held his hand. He just knew that Fourth Master Swan was going to snatch his mother away from him.

With that, the two of them walked into the main hall, where Old Master Swan was sitting in the middle seat.

However, what surprised them was the other person sitting beside him.

Jeanne’s eyes paused for a moment.

Having noticed it, Edward tightened his grip on Jeanne’s hand as if he was giving her something to lean on and telling her not to be nervous.

Edward walked in front of them and said to the person beside his father, “Mr. President.”

Indeed. That was the president of Harken, Warren Sanders.

She did not expect that the president would show up at their wedding.

As she bit her lips and told herself to relax, she said respectfully, “Mr. President.”

“Both of you don’t need to be so polite. Today, I am here as a guest to attend your wedding banquet. Just be casual,” the president said, and his tone sounded very amiable.

However, Jeanne knew very well that he could hold his current position so well not because he seemed amiable.

“Yes,” Edward replied.

The president nodded and turned his head to look at Jeanne, who met his gaze.

“Your reputation really does precede you, Ms. Lawrence. You are indeed different from the rest, and it’s no wonder Fourth Master Swan chose you. I don’t think even my daughter is outstanding enough compared to you,” the president said in a tone that was neither angry nor friendly.

In fact, trying to figure out a leader’s thoughts was not easy at all, especially when he was one they were unacquainted with and leading the country.

However, since the president mentioned Melody and Fourth Master Swan in a situation like that, he was definitely hung up over the matter. If he did not explain himself at that moment, he would definitely come across as rude.

Jeanne smiled. “President, you flatter me. Actually, the Third Princess is outstanding. In fact, she’s too outstanding for Edward to be worthy of her.”

It was obvious that she was pandering to the president.

On one hand, she affirmed Melody’s excellence, and on the other, she also explained the reason why Fourth Master Swan did not get together with Ms. Sanders. It was because Fourth Master Swan was not worthy of her. That way, it would give the president a good excuse.

By the looks of the president’s reaction, he did not seem to reject that answer.

He nodded and suddenly called out to his personal guard, “Leon.”

The guard named Leon stood respectfully beside the president.

“I’m just here to congratulate Old Master Swan. It’s getting late, and I still have a lot of official business to attend to, so I’ll take my leave now.”

“I’ll send you off.” Zachary quickly went forward.

“No need.” The president waved his hand and stopped him. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After that, he left immediately.

Everyone’s gaze was on him.

In fact, except for on the television, that was also the first time Jeanne had seen the president in person.

The corners of her mouth curled into a cold smile, a very cold one.
