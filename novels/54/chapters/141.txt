In the Doppler Ultrasound room.

Finn replied calmly, “I just wanted to see if I got rusty in my imaging skills.”

“Dr.Jones is indeed a versatile person.” The imaging specialist sighed.

“You flatter me. I just happened to learn it when I was in school.”

It probably did not just “happen”.

When Finn just entered the hospital, he met a patient who did not have any problems on the ultrasound. However, based on Finn’s medical experience, he felt that there was definitely something wrong, so he personally operated on the patient. He then found a small tumor that was very subtle and difficult to find. It was diagnosed as malignant, but because the surgery was done earlier, the patient had undergone regular follow-up surgery and was basically fine.

For this reason, the patient specially bought a silk banner for Finn. At that time, this story was also widely spread in the hospital. In order to make a name for itself, the hospital also published this news in various major media outlets. In a short period of time, Finn became famous in the South Hampton City’s medical world.

Back then, he was only 26 years old.

“Do you want to practice again? There are still a lot of patients waiting in line.” The imaging specialist joked.

“No, I still have something to do in the department. I’ll go back first,” Finn rejected him with a smile. He was also very polite. “Thank you for your help earlier.”

He would not act superior just because of his position in the hospital. Therefore, even though he did not take the initiative to socialize, he had a good relationship with many doctors and nurses.

Finn left the ultrasound room.

The nurse in the ultrasound room sighed. “Dr. Jones is so handsome, and his personality is also gentle. Everyone says that he is the brand of our hospital. The most important thing is his looks. It’s better to see him than to hear about him. He is really good-looking.”

“Don’t think about it. He has a wife.” The imaging specialist broke her fantasy. “And you’ve seen his wife. She’s beautiful. I heard that she’s the daughter of a wealthy family.”

“I know. I’m just saying. Humans always yearn for beautiful things.” The nurse was a little unhappy, but she could not help but say, “By the way, Dr.Jones treats his wife so well. He actually personally examined his wife’s breast. Do you think he did that because he doesn’t want you to see his wife’s body...”

It was not too far from the truth.

That’s right.

Monica received the examination report.

She took a look.

The diagnosis was breast hyperplasia.

Fortunately.

Fortunately, Finn was wrong this time.

She took the report to the doctor’s office.

Suddenly, a voice rang in her ear, “Dr.Jones.”

Monica turned her head instinctively and looked toward the voice. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She really saw Finn not far ahead.

Finn was stopped by a nurse. The two of them were talking about something.

The nurse was smiling brightly at him. Finn had a faint smile on his lips as well. He was listening to her speech very seriously, giving off an especially gentle demeanor.

Monica saw Finn standing there in his white coat.

He had a tall figure and a refined appearance.

Monica really did not want to use any good words to describe Finn. However, at this moment, the impression Finn gave off was of a kind doctor that could only be seen on television. It was the image of a leading doctor.

In the real world, it was really hard to see.

She retracted her gaze.

She suddenly walked past Finn.

No matter how good-looking he was or how elegant he was, he was still just a s*umbag to her.

Finn’s eyes moved slightly as he glanced at the person who walked past him.

The corners of his lips that were raised slightly stiffened for a few seconds.

…

Lawrence Enterprise, executive meeting room.

Jeanne appeared in the meeting room.

All the executives and senior directors were present in the meeting room. They looked at Jeanne with a face full of sarcasm.

It was especially obvious from Bryce Hoffman.

After all, he used to have a very high position in the Lawrence Enterprise, and he would occasionally mock Alexander. Now, because of Jeanne’s arrival, he had suffered a few setbacks and was a little unhappy in his heart. At this moment, when he saw Jeanne, he immediately said out loud, “Aren’t you the brave one? You even went against the Sanders and asked them to come out and solve your problems. Now, the administration office only said a few words and you’re backing down?”

The words were not at all pleasant.

Something flashed across Jeanne’s eyes as she glanced at Bryce. “Director Hoffman, the matter hasn’t reached the final step yet. You’d better not make a conclusion for now.”

“You’re still so arrogant even at this time. Ms. Lawrence, can you restrain your self-righteous personality? Do you really think that this is a place for you to have fun, or did you take this as a place where you can throw a tantrum and date whoever you want?” Bryce sneered.

Jeanne’s expression was also very cold.

At that moment, she really did not want to waste her breath on these people.

Bryce saw that Jeanne did not speak and thought that she had nothing to say, so he became even more arrogant. He said to Alexander, “President Lawrence, I think this matter will cause such a huge impact. Jeanne has to bear full responsibility. Right now, although the administrative office said in front of the entire country that they will help us get through this difficult time, we have made the Sanders look bad this time. They may not let us off so easily.”
