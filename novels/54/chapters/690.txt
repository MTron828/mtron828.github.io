Chapter 691: Letting Go: Sorry I Made You Feel Disgusted

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After the elevator arrived at that particular floor, they walked to the room together, and Monica swiped the keycard at the door to open it.

There was no sound in the room or any sign of Finn on the big bed.

“Finn!” Sarah called his name.

Monica was also scared, so she looked around and rushed into the bathroom.

In the bathroom, a man was lying on the ground, his body shaking non-stop.

His blood vessels were pumping, his veins were exposed, and his expression was ferocious. He looked very terrifying.

Moreover, the tap was running in the bathroom. The water had soaked his entire body, and his clothes were stuck to his body, making his muscles obvious.

His lips were bitten until they were stained with blood, his hands were clenched tightly, and his joints were pale.

How could Finn hold it in for so long?

He was clearly uncomfortable. How could he not make a sound?

What had he experienced to allow himself to be tortured to such an extent without doing something about it?

Monica’s eyes were red. Without hesitating, she squatted down and hugged the trembling Finn.

Even though he had pushed her away cruelly earlier, she still could not control herself from moving closer to him.

She asked him nervously, “Finn, what’s wrong?”

Her soft body was pressed against his body which was as stiff and hot as an iron.

Then, the man who had been enduring the endless torture suddenly reacted violently. His eyes were bloodshot as he looked at the woman in front of him.

Monica also looked into his bloodshot eyes, wondering if blood would ooze out in the next second.

If he was suffering so badly, why did he not make a sound? Was it because he could not feel pain? Did that mean he did not know how uncomfortable he was feeling?

However, at that moment, he looked very uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that his body seemed like it was about to explode.

“Ugh...” Monica’s thoughts stopped abruptly.

She widened her eyes only to see Finn’s face right in front of her and him kissing her fiercely. She even thought she tasted blood.

“Finn... Um...” Monica’s words were sealed by Finn’s kiss. Hence, she stammered.

At the same time, Sarah and the others had arrived at the bathroom.

As soon as they entered, they saw Finn kissing Monica crazily.

After all, they were only 18 years old and had not experienced much. Even if they had secretly watched explicit videos, such a steamy scene still made them feel a little shy. Hence, at that moment, all of their faces were red, and they quickly averted their gazes, except for Sarah.

Sarah’s eyes were red as she watched her cousin and Finn kiss each other crazily and how impatient, eager, and rude Finn was.

He clearly was not in control of himself. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She, too, had hugged him just now, but he immediately threw her out.

At that, her tears fell, and her heart ached.

On the contrary, Shelly’s face turned as red as a tomato.

She found Sarah’s hand and held it. “Let’s go.”

However, Sarah did not move. She just looked at them indistinctly.

“Sarah, let’s go,” Shelly called out to her again.

Sarah shook her head.

She did not want to go, she did not want her cousin to have sex with Finn, and she did not want…

Shelly gritted her teeth, pulled a little harder, and dragged Sarah out of the bathroom with some force.

Lizzy and James also walked out of the bathroom. Once Shelly dragged Sarah away, they even closed the bathroom door.

Sarah’s heart was aching in pain.

She did not think that after all she had done, she would end up helping Finn and her cousin instead while she just watched them get together.

Shelly could feel the pain Sarah was feeling.

She did not love Nox, but she did not like it when she saw him sleeping with another woman, let alone Sarah, who had liked Finn for so many years. She had waited so long for Finn’s divorce, thinking that it was finally her moment, but she did not expect that the bird had flown.

She said, “Sarah, why don’t we leave?”

All Sarah did was cry, not wanting to leave.

“You saw it yourself. Finn would rather die than touch you, but when your cousin came, he lost control...” Shelly wanted to say something but stopped herself.

She did not know how to comfort Sarah, who probably was feeling nothing but pain.
