Chapter 1548: Jeanne Tells Monica Her Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica said she would be Jeanne’s mother from now on since Jeanne’s mother had passed away. Unexpectedly, Jeanne had been taking care of her since she was young. If anything happened, Jeanne would always rush in front of her, and she had always doted on her.

At that moment, Monica broke down and threw herself into Jeanne’s arms. As she hugged Jeanne tightly, she cried even harder.

Jeanne felt a little helpless. If Monica continued to cry like that, the fetus would be affected. Then, how was she going to explain that to Finn?

“Don’t cry.” Jeanne also hugged Monica tightly.

Their friendship was… pure and unconditional.

The two of them hugged each other and cried for a long time, and toward the end, Monica’s voice was hoarse.

When the two of them returned to the dining table, Monica was still sobbing. She sobbed and looked at Jeanne without blinking. It still felt surreal seeing her.

“You should eat something.” Jeanne picked up some food for Monica.

Monica was still staring at her.

“Monica.” Jeanne frowned.

She was getting a little angry. She could not believe Monica still did not know how to take care of herself at that age. Did she not know that she was pregnant and that pregnant women needed nutrition?

“I was thinking, other people undergo plastic surgery to make themselves look better. Take Shelly for example. After plastic surgery, Shelly looks really good. But you, don’t you think it’s a loss?” Monica said bluntly.

Jeanne knew that she could not have much hope for Monica. Her focus would never be on the same level as ordinary people.

“Eat something.” Jeanne urged, not answering Monica’s question.

Monica quickly picked up her utensils and started eating. She had really touched a sore spot.

Did Monica think she wanted to do it willingly? She was also very upset with that face of hers. However, she still had to thank the owner of that face. If it were not for her, Jeanne probably would not have been able to live so easily.

Back then, Edward could avoid Alex’s eyes and allow her to live openly all thanks to the owner of that face. As for the owner of that face… she was indeed dead.

On the eve of the announcement of her death, Edward went to look for Wyatt alone and persuaded him to let her live on as Candice. To Wyatt, allowing that would be a way to remember his daughter. At the very least, his daughter’s face would live in this world.

“Now that you remember everything, will you still be with Fourth Master Swan?” Monica asked as she ate.

A second ago, she was crying her heart out, but the next second, she seemed to have forgotten what she was crying about.

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

Monica looked at her and thought that it was unlike Jeanne’s character.

Considering she had been schemed against, she should at least be a little angry.

A few days ago, Finn said that Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan had a fight. Could it be that Jeanne suddenly remembered her identity and left? How many days had it been and she was back?

“Although Fourth Master Swan is really good to you, I have to remind you that when you lost your memory, Fourth Master Swan and Susan had a daughter, Paige. Aren’t you disgusted by that?”

It was said that they should persuade peace and not separation. However, Monica was just a woman who liked to go against the norm.

“Paige is my daughter,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Stunned, Monica widened her eyes and looked at Jeanne. “Paige is your daughter? How was that possible? You were already dead when Paige was born!”

Jeanne was speechless.

“What I mean is, at that time, they’ve announced your death to the public.” Monica quickly corrected herself.

“You said it yourself.”

“So, when they announced to the public that I was dead, I was actually in Bamboo Garden, waiting for my labor.”

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Monica was furious.

Since she was not dead at that time, why did she not tell her? Did Jeanne not know how upset she was at that time? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Because I thought that I would die after giving birth to Paige, and since I was going to die, I didn’t want to give you any hope,” Jeanne explained.

“In that case, how did you give birth to Paige? Did you give birth to her in Bamboo Garden? Didn’t you give birth to George by C-section? Didn’t they say that if you did a C-section for the first child, you would have to do a C-section for the second?” Monica asked emotionally.

“No, I chose to give birth naturally for my second child because Finn said that the fetal position was right.”

“Finn?”

“Finn was my obstetrician when I was pregnant with Paige.”

Monica was at a loss for words. Therefore, Finn knew everything from the start, but he kept it from her.

“If you think about it carefully, you should be able to recall that there was a period of time when Finn would leave suddenly in the middle of the night.

Most of the time, it should be because I didn’t feel well.”

Monica thought about it and realized there was a period of time when Finn would receive a phone call and leave at lightning speed. At that time, she thought that Finn only cared about his work and did not care about her at all. However, it turned out it was all because of Jeanne.

“Was Finn in labor with you?” Monica asked.

Jeanne smiled. “Are you jealous?”

“Why would I be jealous?” Monica did not care. “Finn is a doctor and has seen countless women’s bodies. If I’m jealous, I would be jealous all the time. Besides, I don’t even like Finn anymore. I don’t care who Finn helps in labor, and it’s none of my business. I’m just curious how you gave birth to Paige.” Jeanne looked at Monica. It was obvious that she did not believe Monica.

“It’s true. I’m not jealous!” Monica explained again, “Let’s not talk about Finn delivering your baby. If you like him, I’ll give you my blessings even if you get together with Finn. As long as it’s something you want, I won’t snatch him from you.”

Jeanne could not stand how silly Monica was, but it was also very touching. She said, “No, Finn is very careful in this aspect.”

In the end, Monica still got a little emotional.

She would never admit that it was because she did not want to see Finn with another woman. No matter what the reason was, she just felt that… it would be awkward with someone whom she would meet every day.

“It must be because Fourth Master Swan doesn’t want to.” Monica found an excuse, “A person like Fourth Master Swan should be extremely possessive. He definitely doesn’t want you to be seen by other men.”

“Both.” Jeanne did not deny it. “But ultimately, although Finn doesn’t know how to express it, he’s absolutely loyal to you.”

“Shouldn’t loyalty exist between a couple? Am I supposed to be moved by this?” Monica’s rejection of Finn was apparent in her words.

At that moment, Jeanne felt like giving up on convincing Monica of Finn.

“By the way, does that mean you’re the only woman in Fourth Master Swan’s life?” Monica quickly asked.

She seemed to have finally understood the situation.

Jeanne nodded silently. The moment she nodded, the corners of her mouth curled up into a blissful smile.

Monica looked at Jeanne’s expression and finally understood why Jeanne would really let bygones be bygones. She would never bear to be cruel to a man who loved her so much..
