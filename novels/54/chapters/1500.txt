She was also extremely happy that she could come up with such a plan with Edward tonight.

She admitted that she was waiting for Edward on purpose. Knowing that he would be back late, she had stayed up waiting for him.

She had two days left, and she could not let it go to waste like that. She should at least fight for a chance for herself. Otherwise, she would not be satisfied when she left. However, she had never expected to be given a huge surprise tonight.

When she was waiting for him in the living room, she saw that Edward did not return to his room immediately after she returned. Instead, he sat at the bar counter and started drinking!

If he was drunk, could they have sex after? At the thought of that, her heart began to beat faster.

Previously, she found that Edward was really difficult to get close to, but now, she suddenly found it was a piece of cake.

Tonight would be an opportunity — an excellent opportunity. Hence, she did not hesitate to go over and drink with Edward. Even though she could not wait for him to get drunk, she would act as if she was deeply in love with him.

Edward drank a lot, whereas Chloe accompanied him and only took a few sips. Toward the end, Edward leaned against the bar counter, obviously drunk.

Chloe suppressed the excitement in her heart. She did not expect Edward’s alcohol tolerance to be so bad. In fact, she was prepared for Edward to drink for a long time.

She used her hand to push Edward. “Edward, wake up. Wake up…

Edward did not move.

“It’s easy for you to catch a cold if you sleep here. Edward, shall I send you back to your room?” Chloe asked.

Still, Edward did not reply. It seemed like he was drunk.

Not in the mood to think about why Edward was different from usual tonight, Chloe immediately tried to help Edward up from the bar counter. Then, she let his body lean on her as she helped Edward up the stairs.

Chloe walked carefully, afraid that she would accidentally drop Edward.

Fortunately, she managed to use all her strength to help Edward into her room.

That was right. It was her room, not Edward and Candice’s room. After all, how could she miss such a great opportunity?

When Edward woke up tomorrow, they would have slept together, and she would accuse him of forcing it on her. She would like to see how Edward was going to explain himself to her and her parents.

Then, she thought about what was going to happen next and became even more excited, so she hurriedly went to take off Edward’s clothes. Looking at the strong muscles on Edward’s body and that perfect outline…

He had the best figure among all the men she had seen. His looks were also the best. How could that woman, Candice, take advantage of such a good man like him? Even if she did not get what she wanted tomorrow, she felt that everything would be worth it as long as she could sleep with that man.

After taking off Edward’s shirt, she started to take off Edward’s pants when Edward moved, seemingly uncomfortable. Chloe was shocked as she thought Edward had woken up, but unexpectedly, all he did was turn around.

She thought about it for a moment and decided not to take the rest of Edward’s clothes off. Instead, she stripped herself naked before approaching Edward.

She was actually a little nervous and trembling. After all, it would be her first time sleeping with a man — and a drunk man at that. However, it also made her excited, and she leaned over to kiss Edward’s lips.

She had been looking forward to that day for a long time. She had always felt that such perfect lips would be very sensual to kiss. For that, Candice was really lucky.

Chloe’s lips were only less than one centimeter away from Edward’s lips when the door was kicked open. Chloe was so shocked that she screamed. She had no idea what was going on.

In the next second, she quickly took the blanket to cover her body and could only watch as several men in black suits appeared in her room, looking very imposing.

“You… Who are you? How could you barge in here? Do you know this is where the Leader lives? You’ll be shot!” Chloe shouted in fear.

She was on the verge of having a mental breakdown.

In the villa, because of the loud noise, Candice, who had not fallen asleep, got up from the bed. She followed the direction of the voice and arrived at Chloe’s room, where she saw Chloe trying her best to cover her naked body with the blanket.

Then, she saw a naked man sitting up on Chloe’s bed. The lower half of his body was under the same blanket as Chloe, and the upper half of his body was completely naked. Candice looked at the scene in front of her and immediately understood what it meant.

She had reminded Chloe not to provoke Edward because neither Chloe nor the Nicholsons could afford to offend him. However, Chloe was still so stupid.

Candice just stood there and watched the scene unfold.

“Edward, who are they? I’m so scared. You have to protect me. Boohoo…” When Chloe saw that Edward had woken up, she quickly made herself seem pitiful.

She continued to lean against Edward’s body, looking like she was so frightened that she did not know what to do. However, at that moment,

Edward suddenly pushed her away, lifted the blanket, and got out of bed.

Outside the door, Candice’s eyes flickered instinctively as she was afraid she would see something inappropriate. Even though she had seen it many times, fortunately, his pants were still on. Therefore, it meant that Chloe’s attempt had failed.

“Edward…” Chloe watched him leave in disbelief.

The men in the black suit treated Edward with respect, and Edward said to one of them, “Did you record it?”

“Yes.” One of the men in the black suit answered and handed over a black phone with both hands.

Edward took the phone and watched the replay of the surveillance footage on the phone.

He said, “Put her in the detention center first.”

“Yes,” the man in the black suit replied.

Chloe was still dumbfounded. ‘Detention center? What’s going on? Who are they going to put in the detention center? Moreover, isn’t Edward drunk? Why is he suddenly so clear-headed? What’s going on?’

At that moment, she saw a man in a black suit approaching her.

His face was cold as he said, “Ms. Nicholson, are you going to put on your clothes and leave with us, or are we going to have to take you away by force?”

“Are you crazy?” Chloe immediately came back to her senses, and at that moment, she started to break down.

She could not believe what was happening. She was just sleeping with Edward. Why was she getting detained?

What right did they have to detain her? She was the daughter of the dignified minister, Mr. Nicholson. How could they do whatever they wanted to her?

“What crime have I committed for you to detain me? What crime have I committed?” Chloe screamed.

She could not accept what was happening to her.

The man in the black suit’s eyes darkened, and he said coldly, ‘You sexually harassed the Leader of the Harken. According to the laws of Harken, you have harassed the Leader of Harken and caused physical and mental harm to him.

This crime is punishable by death..”
