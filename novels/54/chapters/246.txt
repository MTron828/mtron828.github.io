Chapter 247: Jeanne Saves Herself and Waits for Edward

Jeanne did not dare to stop at all.

After getting out of the car, she did not have the time to check her injuries and did not know where she was at the moment. She chose a direction and ran forward.

She was very fast.

The people behind her were chasing her very closely.

Nonetheless, Jeannie felt that it would not be difficult to find a place to hide in the dark.

She felt that as long as she could stall for time, someone would come to save her.

Jeanne ran for a long distance.

Just when she thought she had slightly shaken off the people behind her, she suddenly heard the sound of motorcycle engines.

She looked back.

In the dark, many lights were crisscrossing non-stop. These lights were all from the motorcycles that were crazily driving toward her.

In this place where cars could not travel, the other party actually prepared to use other means of transportation. This time, they were going all-out to kill her!

The motorcycles sped over.

No matter how fast Jeanne was, it was useless.

In an instant, she was surrounded by a few motorcycles, unable to advance or retreat.

Jeanne was covered in blood as she stood under the lights of the motorcycles.

She looked at the motorcycles in front of her vigilantly.

There were a total of four of them.

It was one against four.

Jeanne did not know if she had any chance of winning.

Moreover, there were probably many people behind her.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Before the other party could make a move, Jeanne suddenly approached a motorcycle. Her actions were fast and ruthless. She kicked the motorcyclist’s body ruthlessly. The man did not seem to be able to react in time and was kicked over by Jeanne.

Jeanne flipped over abruptly and sat on the motorbike.

The moment she was about to leave on the motorbike, the other three motorbikes approached her rapidly and were charging at her madly, knocking her directly to the ground.

Once Jeanne fell to the ground, she flipped over and avoided being crushed by another motorbike.

The next second, she was hit by another motorbike.

Jeanne kept dodging the three motorbikes, but in the end…

No matter how agile she was, she could not escape unscathed in such a situation.

At this moment, just when she finally could not dodge anymore, her body suddenly jerked.

She was fiercely knocked to the ground by a motorbike.

Jeanne felt as if her body was shattered.

There was even a second when she was unable to get up.

She just fell to the ground.

Jeanne’s body was covered in blood.

Her body was covered in blood as she lay there motionless.

The people in front of her saw that she had completely collapsed and did not come any closer. Instead, they all got down from their motorcycles and looked at her vigilantly as if they were waiting for someone to come.

Jeanne secretly gritted her teeth.

She admitted that her body was at its limit, but it was not at the point where she needed to give up.

Fortunately, she had made the right bet.

Once she collapsed, the other party would not attack anymore. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

They probably had to keep her alive.

After all, Melody had suffered such a huge loss from Jeanne. She had to vent her anger, so how could she let Jeanne die just like that?

Jeanne lay on the ground motionlessly.

At this moment, she was also trying her best to recover her strength.

She knew she could not fight head-on in this situation.

Just like that, under the somewhat quiet night sky in a deserted countryside, footsteps were heard after some time.

It was obvious that Melody had arrived.

Melody had arrived. She stood in front of Jeanne and looked down from above.

She looked at Jeanne lying in a pool of blood, not moving at all.

Melody sneered.

She thought that Jeanne had great abilities. Was Jeanne not lying in front of her, bowing to her at this moment?!

How ridiculous.

Melody asked coldly, “How do you feel?!”

Jeanne did not answer. She just lay on the ground, not moving at all.

“Aren’t you quite proud? Didn’t you seduce my man and flaunt your power? Why aren’t you saying anything now? Are you lying on the ground and pretending to be dead?!”

As Melody said that, she stepped fiercely on Jeanne’s wounded body.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

A piercing pain filled her body.

“You can still endure it. You’re not even screaming!” Melody said cruelly. As she spoke, the strength on her feet became stronger.

At this moment, the high heels seemed to have already penetrated deep into the flesh on Jeanne’s back.

Jeanne clenched her fists so tightly that her eyes were filled with malevolence.

Even so, she did not make a sound.

“Ha.” Melody sneered.

It seemed that she did not expect Jeanne to still endure it at this point.

Melody stopped and squatted down. She lifted Jeanne’s face, which was covered in blood. She grabbed Jeanne’s chin and forced Jeanne to look at her.

Melody’s cold voice was heard. “Edward must like your face. You look like a vixen.”

Jeanne looked at Melody coldly.

Her eyes were bloodshot.

“Before you die, I want Edward to see that your face is beyond recognition,” Melody said sinisterly, “Bring me the knife!”

The bodyguard beside her quickly handed over a Swiss army knife.

Melody held the knife. Under the lights of the motorcycle, she swayed the knife in front of Jeanne.

She asked, “Will Edward still like you if you’re disfigured?!”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Melody seemed to have had enough of Jeanne’s silence. She pinched Jeanne’s chin hard. “Speak!”

Jeanne still looked at her coldly.

“You’re not going to talk?! Are you still being stubborn? Let’s see if you or the knife in my hand is more stubborn!” Melody smiled cruelly. She aimed the knife at Jeanne’s mouth.

Her face was full of malevolence.

Jeanne’s gaze suddenly changed, and killing intent instantly appeared in her eyes.

Melody seemed to have noticed Jeanne’s strange behavior at this moment.

Jeanne, who was originally on the verge of death, seemed to have suddenly become a person full of strength. By the time Melody noticed it, Jeanne had made a backhand move. Her speed was fast, and she snatched Melody’s knife from her hand. Next, she aimed it directly at Melody’s neck.

The entire process was accurate and fast, completed in one go.

It seemed that no one had expected it.

Melody was shocked.

She had never thought that Jeanne would still have the ability to fight at this time.

Melody had always thought that Jeanne had reached her limit and was waiting to be slaughtered, so she was not on guard at all.

She looked straight at Jeanne and felt that the knife in Jeanne’s hand had cut the skin on her neck.

Jeanne did not want to waste any more time with Melody. “Let me go, or we’ll die together!”

This was the greatest chance for her to survive.

She had expected Melody to deliberately torture her, so she could only pretend to be on her last breath to let Melody let her guard down. She had also guessed that Melody did not have any martial prowess, so it would not be difficult for her to restrain Melody.

Melody had indeed been plotted against by Jeanne.

She had never thought that Jeanne would still be able to treat her like this at this point.

Her eyes were cold as she looked at Jeanne. She watched as Jeanne held the knife and aimed it at her throat.

Jeanne might cut her throat, and she would die immediately.

The anger in her eyes was obvious.

It was probably because she was so angry that her heart was beating fast, and her eyes were bloodshot.

Melody could not accept it at all.

She could not accept that she would still be seized by Jeanne.

The two of them were in a stalemate for two seconds.

Perhaps it was only one second.

Jeanne suddenly felt a pain at the back of her head.

At this moment, Melody’s body was suddenly pulled by the person behind her. A man’s hand quickly appeared on her neck. It was obvious that he was trying to block Jeanne’s knife. Jeanne’s knife stabbed the man’s hand and directly pierced through it but it did not injure Melody.

Next, Jeanne fainted.

After being ruthlessly hit on the back of the head, she could not control herself and fainted.

When she fainted, she saw Melody’s sinister and cunning smile.

Jeanne knew if no one came to save her… If Fourth Master Swan did not come...

She would die without a doubt.

Jeanne had failed to fight for her last chance of survival.

The reason for her failure was that Melody was also prepared to die with her.

Otherwise, her bodyguards would not have taken the risk. When they knew that Melody’s life might be in danger, they did not care and used such an extreme method to save her.

If something went wrong—if Jeanne still had the strength to stab the knife deeper before she fainted—Melody’s blood vessels would be cut. In less than a minute, she would bleed to death!

Melody knew that would be the outcome, but her bodyguards still did it!

Jeanne knew it was Melody’s order.

Before Melody came, she had given her bodyguards a death order.

No matter what happened, even if Melody had to lose her life, Jeanne must die!

She must let Jeanne die!
