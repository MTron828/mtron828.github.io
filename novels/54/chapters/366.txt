Chapter 367: The Accident Is Just the Start

Moreover, judging from his daughter’s tone at that moment, she was already at her limit.

Otherwise, she would not have broken down after just three years.

“Get yourself to the company first.” Gary did not agree immediately, but his tone was much softer.

Monica did not want to go on talking to him anymore, so she directly ended the call. Then, she picked up the crutches next to her and left.

Suddenly, someone grabbed her arm.

Monica, who was already angry, burst out like a volcano. “Let go of me!”

However, Finn did not let go.

“Let go of me!” Monica raised her voice even more.

Finn still did not let go of her.

In fact, he was about to speak when Monica cursed, “Damn it.”

After that, she bit Finn’s hand hard.

Finn frowned furiously.

Monica bit down with all her strength as if she really wanted to kill Finn. Even her body was trembling, and she tasted a trace of blood.

......

“Monica!” Finn looked at her like she was crazy and pushed her away.

Monica took two steps back, but because a bar counter was behind her, she would not fall.

Finn glanced at the bite mark on his hand, which was bleeding. It did not hurt that much, but he could still feel how hard she was biting.

Just how much did Monica hate him to bite him so hard?

He even had a feeling that if he had not pushed her away, Monica would bite off his flesh.

“Ha.” Monica looked at Finn’s scarlet bite marks and sneered. “Does it hurt? Do you want to strangle me to death?!”

Finn did not say anything.

“Well, I f*cking want to strangle you to death now! Really, Finn, no one in my entire life has made me so angry that I want to kill them. I’m serious. Stay away from me. I beg you. I need to calm down by myself. Otherwise, I’m afraid that I’ll really kill you!” Monica was so angry that she was about to break down.

It was true. Finn, that b*stard, could really make her lose her mind.

With that, she leaned on her crutches and left in a rage.

Finn watched her from behind, looking at how fast she was walking as if she could not wait to leave.

However, the more anxious she was, the more unsteady she became.

All of a sudden, she fell down again without bumping into anything. As she fell to the ground, her crutches slid further away.

Finn clenched his fists tightly and watched as Monica fell to the ground, her spirits crushed.

She hit the floor to vent her anger. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She did not know how she could be so stupid.

How could it be? From the moment she woke up in the morning until now, she had been falling non-stop!

Could she not take good care of herself and not be such a wreck?

Monica was so angry that her eyes were red.

At that moment, not only was her body in pain but she was also driven to extreme madness.

Then, she began to cry heart-wrenchingly. It was as if the sky was about to collapse and she was about to die.

Finn looked at Monica crying so miserably for no reason, and suddenly, the anger in his heart that he had been suppressing disappeared.

He loosened his fists and walked toward Monica, who was crying like mad, not caring whether Finn was there or not.

“You just fell a few times. Do you have to cry like this?” Finn’s voice was much gentler now. Seeing that she had all that energy to cry, he reckoned she was not hurt.

Monica could not and did not want to hear anything.

All she wanted to do now was cry, and she could cry herself to death.

“Are you a child?” Finn was speechless.

He had never seen an adult cry so miserably for such a trivial matter.

“Leave me alone,” Monica yelled at Finn while crying.

“I’ll send you to the hospital.”

“I told you to leave me alone... Ah...” Monica screamed because Finn suddenly picked her up from the ground.

Monica resisted by writhing and struggling.

In Finn’s arms, she was restless.

“Monica! If you keep this up, I’ll really throw you down the stairs!” Finn said fiercely with a dark face.

Monica looked at him with tears in her eyes.

“23 floors!” Finn added.

Monica’s eyes were red. She was blind to have fallen in love with that man back then.

Feeling that Monica had suddenly calmed down, Finn carried her out of the house again.

When they were at the underground garage, Finn put her in the passenger seat.
