1360 The Wedding: I Never Agreed to the Breakup

Even this time when Monica said she wanted to break up, he thought that Monica was speaking out of anger.

Even though Monica and Brandon’s interaction made him angry, deep down, he did not think Brandon was a threat. Therefore, he tacitly allowed Monica to leave.

He thought that with a little change in him, Monica would feel that he valued her and return to his side. They needed some time to adjust their relationship. They loved each other anyway, and as long as they resolved the misunderstanding between them, they would be together again.

It never crossed his mind that Monica would say she did not love him that much or that Monica risked her life for him because she was depressed and did not want to live anymore. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He thought about it carefully. Monica did show signs of depression back then. She had hurt herself, been depressed, and felt hopeless about the world.

Her depression only improved after the accident. After getting better, she seemed to have forgotten that she once suffered from that mental illness and a pretty serious one at that.

Finn did not say a word, and Monica also saw it. Presumably, any man who heard that would react to it, even if it was Finn, who was calm most of the time.

After all, why else would a woman give up her life for a man if it was not because she loved him very much?

No one would have thought that she reacted that way back then because she was not afraid of death and…

She said, “Because you saved me once, I wanted to return what I owed you when I didn’t want to live anymore.”

That was why she was so desperate to stop the collision for him.

After so many years, she finally said it. She knew that once she said it, their relationship would be over.

If a man like Finn, who had such strong self-esteem, found out that she did not love him, he would immediately distance himself from her.

He would not take the initiative to do anything for their relationship. Only if the other party loved him very much would he love her. Then, once he stopped loving her, he would choose to end the relationship.

Of course, she did not blame Finn.

After being together for so many years, she knew and even understood why Finn had such a personality. As an orphan, he had no sense of security in this world. The pain of being abandoned by his parents was so traumatic that he could not trust his heart, devote himself to someone, and give his heart to her.

Some trauma would follow a person for a lifetime. It was not that he wanted to be like that, but he could not change it.

Therefore, she did not blame Finn. She just wanted to make everything clear. After that, their relationship would truly be over.

In fact, she had left some leeway for herself before this. When they were breaking up, she did not say anything about that even after she moved out of Finn’s house, because she thought that perhaps their relationship would turn for the better.

She admitted that even at that point, she was still wondering if Finn would change for her and love her without reservation. However, at that moment, she suddenly felt that she did not want that.

It was really difficult to change a person, and she was afraid that she would be disappointed again and again. She was really afraid that she would fall into complete despair in the end, and she did not want to become depressed again.

She had to live for the sake of her parents, so she chose to tell Finn the truth.

Well, if Finn could let go of her back then, she could do the same. As long as Finn stopped harassing her, she could slowly forget him.

Then, when she thought about him many years later, she might even be able to smile in relief and take it as her a part of her life. In any case, a person had to go through a lot in life, and as time passed, Finn would become her past.

As the night deepened, Finn did not say a word. He just stared at her, with a mix of emotions in his eyes. Even she could not tell what was going on.

Based on her understanding of Finn, he was probably suppressing his emotions at that moment because he would never let anyone see him in a sorry state.

Then, he would readjust his emotions as soon as possible and build up a wall so that no one could hurt him, making himself invincible.
