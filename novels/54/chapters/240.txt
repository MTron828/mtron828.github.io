Chapter 241: The “Married Couple” Sweetly Feeds Each Other

Fourth Master Swan’s eyes moved slightly.

‘Doesn’t he just want to show how affectionate we are with each other in front of everyone?!

‘I’ll fulfill his wish!’ Jeanne thought.

In any case, there would be a day when she would disappear from South Hampton City.

She would act with Edward.

“Aren’t you going to eat it?” Jeanne looked at him.

Fourth Master Swan opened his mouth and ate the cake that Jeanne had fed him.

“How does it taste?” Jeanne looked at him.

It was to make the two of them seem less awkward.

She was not used to being so intimate with Fourth Master Swan.

Fourth Master Swan chewed but did not answer.

“Do you want more?”

Fourth Master Swan seemed to have swallowed the cake. He slowly said, “Ms. Lawrence.”

“Hm?” Jeanne forked another piece and placed it next to Fourth Master Swan’s mouth.

“I heard that George is allergic to chocolate,” Fourth Master Swan said.

Jeanne frowned. “How did you know?”

“Teddy said so.”

Jeanne only just remembered that the last time she went to Fourth Master Swan’s Bamboo Garden for a meal, Teddy seemed to have noted that down.

She did not expect that Teddy would still report such a small matter to Fourth Master Swan.

“You know, genes can be very strong sometimes.” Fourth Master Swan stared straight at Jeanne.

Jeanne’s heart froze.

At this moment, she seemed to have discovered something.

She heard Fourth Master Swan say word by word, “I’m also allergic to chocolate.”

After he finished, he still opened his mouth and ate the chocolate cake that Jeanne had fed him.

He smiled as he ate it.

Jeanne stared straight at Fourth Master Swan.

‘Why are you eating it when you’re allergic to it?!

‘Is something wrong with you?!’

Even so, Jeanne was also thinking of something else.

The two of them suddenly fell silent.

Nox walked over with an apologetic look on his face. “I didn’t want to disturb your wonderful feeding time, but I need to speak to you, Fourth Master Swan.”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

Nox leaned close to Edward’s ear and said in a low voice, “Old Master Swan wants you to go back immediately. His tone was quite bad.”

Edward pursed his lips.

“This isn’t good,” Nox added.

Edward nodded slightly.

Nox smiled at Jeanne. “Lend me Fourth Master Swan, but don’t worry. I’m taking him away, but his body and mind are yours.”

Jeanne did not reply to him.

Edward suddenly leaned closer to Jeanne.

Jeanne instinctively flinched, but her heartbeat somehow accelerated.

Edward whispered in her ear, “The cakes were as delicious as you.”

He seemed to be answering her question about whether the cake was delicious or not.

Nonetheless...

Jeanne’s face turned red.

She was blushing.

Given that Fourth Master Swan was the one who said it, it could mean many different things!

Edward kissed Jeanne’s ear.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

Edward seemed to like kissing her earlobe very much. What kind of weird habit was that?!

Afterward, Edward let go of Jeanne and looked at her. He slowly turned around and left.

Nox hurriedly followed.

The two of them walked out of the banquet hall and returned to the small car.

Nox’s expression became a little more serious.

Edward’s expression was also very serious.

“Just now, Old Master called me and asked you to go to the study to look for him in ten minutes. I reckon that he has started to pursue the matter of you returning early last time! After all, your body has basically recovered now. It’s time for your old master to make a move.” Nox speculated. Thinking about what might happen next, he was afraid.

“Not only that.” Edward was calmer than Nox.

“What?” Nox asked.

“He’s probably also pursuing the matter between Jeanne and me.”

“...” This would be a bloody road.

“Go buy an allergy medicine first,” Edward suddenly said.

“What’s wrong?” Nox asked.

“I just ate chocolate.”

“... You’re willing to kill yourself over a relationship.” Nox was speechless.

He did not even need to think to know that Jeanne must have fed him chocolate just now.

He reckoned that Edward would drink even poison fed by Jeanne, let alone chocolate.

…

At the banquet, Fourth Master Swan’s sudden departure surprised everyone.

What was even more surprising was whether Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne... were really together!

It was clear that the news was spreading like wildfire in South Hampton City. Fourth Master Swan had also openly stated their relationship in the media, but for some reason, no one felt that it was true.

Many people felt that a person like Fourth Master Swan should not be together with Jeanne.

To be more precise, they were used to Fourth Master Swan not letting women get close to him. They could not accept that he would suddenly be together with a woman.

Perhaps everyone would think that it was an illusion until the day they got married.

Jeanne did not care about other people’s opinions.

After Fourth Master Swan left, she slowly finished eating the pastries.

Chocolate was so delicious. How could anyone be allergic to it?!

What was more, more than one person she knew was allergic to it.

After Jeanne finished eating, she gently wiped her lips and made sure that there was not any chocolate cake on her lips and that her lipstick was not smudged. Then, she returned to the banquet hall.

At this moment, Monica was holding onto Finn’s arm and entertaining a lot of people.

Jeanne did not go over to look for Monica either. Instead, she took the initiative to join in the conversation of others.

She might look cold at other banquets, but she could not ruin Uncle Gary’s image on his birthday.

Jeanne’s initiative surprised many people in the business world.

Compared to Alexander, Jeanne was clearly more popular at this moment.

Due to Jeanne’s initiative, many people started to actively fawn over her.

Jeanne was no longer the same as when she was kicked out back then.

On the contrary, nobody cared about Jasmine, the woman who had once stolen Jeanne’s man, caused her reputation to be ruined, and was once very famous in society.

Even her husband had left her side.

Jasmine could only stand alone in the corner, looking coldly at Jeanne being surrounded by people.

She was jealous.

She was extremely jealous!

‘How could Jeanne show off in front of me?!

‘I should be the center of attention!’

…

In the banquet hall where people came and went.

Monica could not hold on any longer.

She pulled Finn to the side. “I can’t take it anymore. I need to rest for a while. My legs are about to break from standing.”

“Okay.” Finn nodded.

“If my dad is looking for me, just tell him that I accidentally sprained my ankle. I can’t walk now.”

“...”

Monica let go of Finn and walked toward the banquet lounge.

Finn watched her leave and saw that she was really limping as she walked.

His eyes moved slightly as he looked at the pair of thin and tall high heels.

“Finn.” A figure suddenly blocked his line of sight.

He turned around.

“Did Monica leave you behind again?” Sarah asked Finn with a bright smile on her face.

“She’s not feeling well, so she’s going to rest first.”

“Really? Then I’ll accompany you.” As she said this, she was very bold as she tried to hold Finn’s arm.

Finn raised his arm and avoided her.

Sarah was unhappy.

Finn said, “There are a lot of desserts over there. You can eat more.”

“I’m not a child anymore.” Sarah looked unhappy. “Look carefully, how am I like a child?”

Sarah stuck out her chest.

She was wearing a pink dress with a flat chest design. She looked very sweet. If one looked carefully, one would see her impressive bust.

Nonetheless, Finn did not even look at her chest.

He turned around and walked away.

He was really cold.

Shelly watched as Sarah failed to please Finn. Then, she walked over. “Was that your prince charming?”

“Is he handsome?” Sarah composed herself from her sadness and asked with a smile.

“He doesn’t like you,” Shelly said bluntly.

‘Are we even friends?!’

“And he’s married,” Shelly continued.

“...” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Forget it,” Shelly advised Sarah.

Even so, Sarah did not want to.

Anyway, her cousin was going to divorce her husband soon.

Once the divorce was over, Sarah would make her move.

At worst, she would use the moves that her cousin had used in the past.

She did not believe that she could not score Finn!
