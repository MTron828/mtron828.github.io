“However, Finn disappeared for two hours.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

In fact, when Kingsley called to tell her that Edward had brought the descendant of the Duncans had been brought back to South Hampton City and told her to find him, she was a little confused. How was she supposed to find that person? How could she verify that person’s identity with Edward by her side?

It turned out that her worries were necessary.

At the very least, in the two days since Edward’s return, she had not been able to find any trace of that person.

At the same time, she was also worried that she would make it too obvious and that Edward would find out.

Besides, he might already know her identity.

Since he knew her identity, he would not allow her to find any loopholes in him.

Edward was a very strict person. After getting to know him for a while, she knew that it was impossible for her to find someone by his side.

However, a mission was a mission, and she had no right to refuse. She could only bite the bullet and do her best.

As for the result, she did not think the result would be good.

Jeanne listened to Kingsley quietly.

He continued, “However, no matter how hard we tried, we couldn’t find out where he went in the two hours he disappeared. He disappeared and reappeared out of thin air. We checked all the traffic cameras in South Hampton City, but we couldn’t find him. He was definitely prepared in advance and hid his tracks under the traffic cameras’ blind spots.”

“You mean, the two hours that Finn disappeared was most likely to see the Duncans’ descendant?”

“Didn’t I tell you that the Duncans’ descendant was injured? Lucy would definitely have left a wound on the other party, and as a doctor, the reason for Finn’s disappearance is clear. He went to treat him.” Kingsley was certain about that fact.

Jeanne also expressed her agreement, but the problem was…

Even Kingsley could not find out where Finn went. To be precise, in Harken and South Hampton City, if the Sanders, the ruling family of the country, could not find Finn’s tracks, how could she?

In some way, she had to admit that the Swans’ development in South Hampton City was more impressive than they imagined.

The Sanders were in charge of all the transportation hubs and surveillance cameras, but the Swans could easily avoid these cameras and disappear from under their noses. The Swans had probably been planning that for a long time, but the Sanders only realized it now.

She did not dare to guess how big of a scheme the Swans had set up. She was not even sure who would win in the end.

“I’m telling you this to show you that the Swans are more powerful than we think. You have to be careful.”

“I know,” Jeanne nodded.

“From now on, you will continue to bide your time and observe Edward’s every move. Then, try your best to find this descendant, but don’t force yourself. Now that the Sanders has changed their view of you, they no longer require you to obtain too much information about the Swans. The Sanders… need you to kill Edward when necessary.”

Jeanne bit her lip.

“You can’t do it?” Kingsley asked. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I don’t know.” Jeanne did not deny it.

She did not know if she would be able to do it when the time came.

“You must remember that for the country’s justice, love is worthless.” Kingsley enunciated every word. “If you don’t kill him, he’ll kill you.”

Jeanne did not know if Edward would kill her.

In fact, she was a little confused as to what was going on between her and Edward.

They both knew that the other was dangerous, but they still lived in peace and pretended to be in love.

She said, “Don’t worry. I know when to do what I need to do.”

“If possible, I really don’t want you to stay in South Hampton City. I don’t want you to be involved in this political struggle.”

However, there was no ‘if’ because that was her own choice.

That was right.

When she left, Kingsley wanted her to return to the Delta Islands, but in the end, she was stopped by the leader’s men and was told to marry Edward. The entire thing was planned by her and Kingsley. The purpose was to make people believe that she was really willing to leave. She had never wanted to stay in South Hampton City, but it was to make people misunderstand that she did not want to be involved in Harken’s political struggle.

Actually, there were still many secrets between her and Kingsley.

“Call me if there’s anything.” Kingsley did not say anything more.
