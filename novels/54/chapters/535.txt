Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn would eventually understand.

Hence, she held onto her crutches, walked straight toward the door, and opened it.

Just as she was about to leave, the person sitting on the sofa suddenly held her and pushed her against the wall beside her. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Monica looked at Finn, who was agitated but was trying to suppress his emotions.

He said, “Once you walk out this door, we will have nothing to do with each other anymore.”

Monica’s heart hurt.

She could not understand why Finn had to use such a method to force her to make a decision.

She said, “Finn, if you can understand, please understand. But if you can’t, anything I say now will be useless. I can’t just leave Michael alone when I can help him. I can’t–”

“I love you,” Finn said suddenly and seriously.

Finn’s confession suddenly made Monica speechless.

She looked at Finn.

“Because I love you so much, I can’t accept seeing you with another man. Because I love you so much, I want to keep you by my side. Because I love you so much...” Finn’s eyes were red.

Monica’s eyes were also red as she said, “Finn, do you have to make me feel so bad?”

Finn could not believe it.

It turned out his confession was now a torment to her.

“You know I’ve made up my mind to help Michael, so why are you using such a method to stop me? Do you want me to die of sadness? Why are you so sad? How can you be so despicable?”

“Because I don’t want you to leave. I really don’t.” Finn enunciated each word as he said, “I’ve kept it to myself for many years, and you’re right. I am an orphan. I don’t have a sense of security. Unlike you, I don’t dare to give unconditionally because I’m always afraid of being abandoned, so I always pretend to be cold to you. I admit that it was my fault when we broke up back then. I should’ve trusted you more and fought for you more. If I had been braver, you and Michael wouldn’t be together...”

Monica could not stop crying.

In fact, she had already let go of the past.

“Now, I want to be brave for once to confess my love for you and fight for you to stay with me. Monica, don’t leave me!” Finn hugged her tightly in his arms.

However, that only made Monica feel even worse.

Why did Finn have to tell her those things at a time like that?

Why did he have to make it so hard for her to leave?

Despite that, she pushed him away and said, “Finn, I love you very much too. I do, but I have no choice but to leave now! I know it’s useless for me to say anything because you won’t understand why I’m helping Michael. However, I’ll show you. I’ll make you understand that I’m not the kind of person who abandons her principles. I know what I’m doing, and I’m not fooling around. Michael isn’t the kind of person you think he is. Since he said he would let me go, he’ll definitely do it–”

“Clang!” Finn punched the glass on the wall beside Monica, and the glass instantly shattered.

Shocked, Monica turned to look at Finn’s fist, which was covered in blood from the glass shards.

She said, “Finn, are you crazy?”

“So, because you trust Michael, I deserve to be abandoned by you, time and time again?” Finn asked furiously.

“I’m not abandoning you. I said–”

“If you’re not abandoning me, why do you have to leave me time and time again? Why? Monica, do you have to be so cruel? You give me hope every time, only to kill it in the end!” Finn was suppressing the rage boiling in him by punching the broken glass beside him.

He was already at his boiling point, so he had to vent his anger.

Monica looked at Finn, and her body trembled.

She did not understand why Finn could not understand her.

She said, “You can’t feel pain anyway!”

He would not feel pain anyway, so no matter how violent he became or hurt himself, she would not do anything to help him.
