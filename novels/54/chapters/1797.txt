Chapter 1798: The Failed Proposal

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Little kids won’t understand the adults’ affairs. The reason why I accepted Nox was because I wanted you to be happy in a complete family, not because I loved Nox. Bella, you’re still young, so please listen to me, okay?” Shelly coaxed Bella.

Bella did not want to agree with her mother, but as she looked into her mother’s sincere eyes, she could not refuse. Yet, when she thought of her father, she felt extremely sad. Hence, she looked at Shelly with red eyes, looking aggrieved.

Shelly kissed Bella’s little face and coaxed her again. “Be good. Listen to me.”

Bella bit her little lip and did not refute. She had always known that it was hard for her mother to take care of her, so she could not make her mother unhappy.

Shelly patted Bella’s little head and continued to pack her things up. Just as she was about to call a moving company, her phone suddenly rang. It was a call from Benjamin.

Shelly hesitated for a moment before picking up. “Ben.”

“Shelly, where are you?”

“What’s wrong?”

“There’s something I want to tell you in person.” Shelly looked at the messy room and said, “Do it tomorrow. I’m moving today.”

“Move? Where to?” Benjamin was surprised.

“To my own house.”

“Did you break up with Nox?” Benjamin asked. His tone indicated that he was certain.

“Yes.”

“Let me help you.”

“No need. I’ll get the moving company to move it.”

“I’ll be right there.” Benjamin hung up the phone, ignoring what Shelly said.

Shelly felt helpless. She thought she did not have much, so it was a little over the top to call it a moving company. However, she did not have a car. If she had a car, she would be able to move her things in one car.

She waited at Nox’s house for a while before the doorbell rang. Shelly opened the door and saw Benjamin.

Benjamin said, “Is everything packed?”

“Yes.” Shelly nodded.

“Then, let’s go.” Benjamin carried the two big bags that had been packed in the room.

“I can do it myself…”

“It’s nothing. You don’t have to be polite,” Benjamin said calmly.

As he carried the two big bags and went out, Shelly stared at Benjamin’s back, thought for a while, and agreed. They moved back and forth two or three times, almost filling up Benjamin’s trunk and backseat. Hence, Shelly had to squeeze into the backseat with Bella in her arms.

After that, Benjamin drove them away. When they left, Shelly could not help but glance at the luxurious neighborhood behind her. She was not reluctant but sad to leave it. Nevertheless, she sighed and forced herself not to think too much about it.

When the car left, what they did not notice was a figure standing at the entrance of the neighborhood, watching them as they drove further and further away.

Nox looked away and returned to his house indifferently. He looked at the house that was clean and tidy. Shelly would usually keep the house clean and tidy at all times, and it was when she moved out.

In fact, Shelly did not have much, and the house still looked the same after she moved out. The only difference was that it felt a lot less familiar. It was as if the luxurious house had been drained of its soul, leaving only an empty shell.

Nox looked down at the document in his hand. He thought he could give it to Shelly in person, but in the end, he could not muster the courage.

He called his lawyer. “Give Shelly the documents for the transfer of properties and assets that we previously agreed on.”

“Mr. Winter, aren’t you going to pass it to her yourself?” “No, I have many important things to attend to.”

“Alright.”

“Give me a reply when you’re done.”

After that, Nox put down his phone and tapped on multiple missed calls from the same number. “Mom, where are you?”

“Why didn’t you answer my call? We’re waiting for you.”

“I just fell asleep. Send me the address.”

“I specially picked this girl for you, and you will definitely like her. Now that you’ve broken up with Shelly, you’d better keep yourself in check and stop being picky. I’m looking forward to holding my grandson and you having a family. Don’t let me down, okay?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Got it,” Nox replied lazily.

He hung up and looked at the address on his phone. He thought to himself that, from then on, Shelly had walked out of his world..
