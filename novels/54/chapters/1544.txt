Chapter 1545: Jeanne Tells Monica Her Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica did not know how Nox would react when he heard those words. He might think Shelly was deeply in love with him and that she probably left the Winters because she loved them too much.

Monica had thought so too, but as expected, no woman would really like a man like Nox. Perhaps Zoe was only with him for fame, money, and status.

“Isn’t your child Nox’s?” Jeanne suddenly asked.

“It really isn’t,” Shelly answered, looking very serious. “I’m not that great to be pregnant with Nox’s child and to want to take care of her all by myself. If it’s Nox’s child, even if I can’t be with Nox, I’ll at least ask for child support.

However, it’s not Nox’s child, and that’s why I can’t return to the Winters.”

Jeanne nodded and believed her.

“Well, I won’t waste any more of your time. If you need anything, you can press the service bell. I’ll be outside.” Shelly smiled.

“Do you want to eat with us?” Monica suddenly invited her.

Somehow, she felt that she had a connection with Shelly, not because of the relationship between Nox and Shelly, but because Shelly was the one who informed her about Finn’s being drugged a few years ago.

Regardless of the process or outcome, they had helped each other before, so it was normal for them to have a meal together. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I can’t. I can’t eat with guests during my shift.” Shelly quickly refused.

Monica did not insist.

“Enjoy.” Shelly then left respectfully.

When the door closed, Monica said helplessly, “I actually quite like Shelly. I’ve always felt that she’s more real than Nox’s current fiancée, Zoe.”

Jeanne nodded, tacitly agreeing to Monica’s comment.

“I have a feeling that Zoe is not a simple woman. I don’t mean that she could hurt Nox, but I think Nox has been deceived by her.” Monica said seriously to Candice, “I saw Zoe having dinner with another man before. Although Nox doesn’t care, a woman’s sixth sense is strong, and Zoe strikes me as an indecent woman.”

Monica did not know why she wanted to tell Candice everything. Such a private thing should be kept a secret. However, she could not control her mouth or her thoughts when she sat with the woman.

“Can’t you investigate her?” Jeanne said bluntly.

“I do want to help Nox with investigating her, but as you know, it’s

inappropriate for others to interfere in one’s relationship. Perhaps Nox knows something about Zoe but doesn’t care because they’re on good terms now. If I find out the truth and tell Nox, how do you think Nox would react? If he stays with Zoe, he would feel embarrassed. If he broke up with her, he would feel sad. Forget it.” Monica sighed, “He should handle his relationship matters himself. He deserves to be cuckolded since he has fooled around with many women in his life.”

Jeanne looked at Monica and believed Monica had grown up a lot, considering she knew how to consider things from someone else’s perspective.

If it were in the past, Monica would definitely aggressively expose everything in the name of justice. Although she had good intentions, it might embarrass others.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Jeanne’s gaze made Monica feel a little uncomfortable. “Is there something on my face? Or do you disagree with my point of view?”

“No, I agree with you. Nox should solve his relationship matters by himself. If bystanders interfered, he would suspect us of destroying his relationship.”

Jeanne agreed. “It suddenly seems to me that you’ve matured.”

“I’ve always been very mature, okay?” Monica looked very unhappy.

Candice spoke as if she was very familiar with her.

However, Jeanne smiled. “Let’s eat.”

Monica picked up her utensils and was a little shocked. The dishes on the table were all her favorite.

Finn must have told Candice. If Finn could tell Candice that she had a mole on her thigh, he could definitely tell her what she liked. To bribe her like that, Candice was indeed too shrewd.

“How’s your pregnancy?” Jeanne asked.

“It’s pretty good. I don’t have morning sickness anymore, and I feel alright, ”

Monica replied..
