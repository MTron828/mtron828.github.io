Chapter 222: Yes, Finn Was Just a Mistake

In the not-so-spacious laundry room.

Finn pressed Monica firmly under his body, making her unable to move at all.

His cold words seemed to be steaming hot at the same time as he threatened her, “Monica, you really don’t treat me as a man, do you?”

Monica suddenly felt the danger. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She looked at Finn warily.

Monica felt that Finn had suddenly become... aggressive.

They were very close to each other.

Their faces were very close to each other.

At that moment, Monica felt that if she pouted her lips slightly, their lips would touch.

Her heart beat suddenly.

It started to race.

Monica did not know why, but her whole body was tense. Her face was rosy, and her heart was beating wildly.

At that moment, her gaze was fixed on Finn’s lips. She could not move her gaze away.

It was as if there was magic…

It was as if there was magic, and she wanted to get close.

Monica pursed her lips.

She pursed her lips as she was trying to calm herself down.

She must not be seduced by a man like Finn.

She must not!

If she took the initiative to do something to Finn, Finn would look at her with disdain again.

Monica would not humiliate herself like that.

Yes.

If Monica fantasized about Finn, she would only humiliate herself.

She did not do it.

At this time, Monica was using her breathing to adjust her emotions.

Who knew, she would only bring trouble upon herself if she breathed so heavily.

Finn clenched his fists tightly. All he could see was Monica’s flushed face and her undulating chest due to her breathing…

“Monica, you brought this on yourself!” Finn said through gritted teeth as if he was suppressing his lust.

He suddenly reached out and pulled Monica’s bathrobe off.

Monica felt a chill. Next, she felt Finn’s passionate kiss on her lips.

She even felt that she was looking forward to him getting closer to her

“Ah!” In the room, a scream was suddenly heard.

That scream made the two of them come back to their senses!

It was like a scorching flame that was extinguished by a basin of cold water.

Finn was the first to react.

When he came back to her senses, the desire in his eyes disappeared at a visible speed.

Monica saw it clearly.

He covered her body with the bathrobe and got up.

Monica bit her lips.

She could still feel Finn’s touch on her lips, but not a trace of him was left behind.

It was because the time was too short.

Monica quietly got up from the ground.

At this moment, she heard the housekeeper explain very apologetically, “I didn’t do it on purpose. I just... I had something to do yesterday, so I went back to my hometown. My dad fell, so I went to check on his condition and didn’t come to clean the house yesterday. I thought that I was going to come at night if my dad’s condition isn’t serious, but there was a car accident and traffic control in my hometown. That’s why I just came back to clean the house. I didn’t mean to disturb you...”

The housekeeper felt guilty.

‘Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones didn’t have a good relationship, to begin with.

‘I’ve never seen them being intimate, let alone sleeping in the same room. Even though I’m not around 24 hours a day, I know they sleep in separate rooms. Now that they’re finally being so intimate, I saw them in action…’

Most importantly, the housekeeper could not help but scream at that time.

She wanted to hide at this moment.

Just as the housekeeper was feeling extremely guilty, Finn suddenly said, “There’s some foam on the ground. One might slip and fall easily. Make sure to clean it up.”

“Understood,” the housekeeper quickly responded.

Finn bent down and picked up the underwear on the ground. Then, he threw it into the trash can in the laundry room.

Monica’s eyes twitched.

She watched Finn leave just like that after he threw the underwear away.

Monica was unable to vent her anger.

The housekeeper did not dare to say anything at that moment and quickly picked up a mop to clean up the water and foam on the floor.

Monica was so angry that she did not move at all.

She did not even know what she was angry about!

She felt like she wanted to kill someone!

She stood there.

The housekeeper was also doing her thing and did not dare to say anything.

Despite that, when the housekeeper saw the washed clothes, she was a little surprised and muttered in surprise, “I don’t remember washing these...”

Monica turned her head.

The housekeeper looked at Monica. “Mrs. Jones, did you wash them?”

How was that possible?!

Monica could not use the washing machine no matter how hard she tried.

“Then it must’ve been Dr. Jones who washed them,” the housekeeper said with certainty. “Dr. Jones never asked me to wash his underwear. Since I wasn’t around yesterday, he probably washed the other stuff as well.”

“...” Monica was a little speechless.

‘These were washed by Finn?!’

Well, her bathrobe was not in the bathroom, so it was possible that it was not the housekeeper who washed the clothes.

After all, the housekeeper always put it back where it was so that she could use it easily.

On the other hand...

Was Finn very bored?!

Not only did he wash his clothes, but he also helped Monica wash hers?!

It was worth noting that…

Monica had never washed her undergarments.

Finn was the one who washed her bras and panties…

Monica suddenly flushed.

It was because she imagined the scene of Finn washing these clothes.

No matter what, she felt that it was very erotic.

“Mrs. Jiang, Mr. Jones is quite a nice person. If the two of you can be together well, I think he’ll surely be a good man.” The housekeeper noticed that Monica had not left yet and was still in a daze, so she could not help but comment a little.

Monica came back to her senses.

To outsiders, Finn was always a good person.

She had always been the willful and unruly one.

Monica was too lazy to explain to the housekeeper. She said, “Next time, if you have something up, tell me in advance so that I can get someone else from the Cardellinis to come over and help.”

The housekeeper quickly apologized, “Okay. I’m really sorry, Mrs. Jiang.”

“How’s your dad?” Monica suddenly asked.

The housekeeper was startled. “It’s nothing serious. He didn’t hurt his bones. It’s just that when old people fall, we tend to worry that something will go wrong. Fortunately, the doctor said that it’s nothing serious, so he can be discharged after two days of observation in the hospital.”

Monica nodded.

She walked out of the laundry room and went straight to her room.

She did not have the habit of wearing a bathrobe to sleep. She just did not like to wipe her body after taking a shower, so she used the bathrobe to dry her body.

At this moment, Monica went to the cloakroom and took off her bathrobe. She picked up her pajamas and was about to put them on when she saw her body in front of the large floor-to-ceiling mirror.

Her chest, her waist, and her butt.

The most important thing was that her legs were straight and long.

Sometimes, Monica was seduced by her body.

How could Finn be so indifferent?!

He was not completely indifferent, was he…?

Monica seemed to have felt something unusual just now.

When she was pressed under Finn’s body, the feeling was very obvious.

Monica bit her lip.

If it was not for the housekeeper…

Would something have happened between her and Finn?!

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

At the same time, her phone in the room suddenly rang.

Monica quickly came back to her senses. She put on her pajamas, walked out of the cloakroom, and picked up her phone.

When she saw the name “Micheal” on her phone...

Her heart tensed up a little.

At this moment, it was as if she had been struck by lightning.

She could not come back to her senses at all.

Her mind was a mess, and she instantly felt guilty.

Just now…

Monica had completely forgotten about Micheal.

She had completely forgotten that she had promised him to date.

Was she cheating on him spiritually?!

Monica hated that the most. Was it going to happen to her?!

She felt very irritable.

That feeling that she was filthy made her feel like she was about to break down.

Monica’s phone continued to ring.

She gritted her teeth and picked up the phone.

After forcing herself to calm down, she said. “Micheal.”

“Monica, I’ve only looked at you from afar today. I didn’t even talk to you. I miss you so much now.”

“...” Monica’s guilt intensified.

She and Micheal were the ones in a romantic relationship.

On the other hand, she and Finn were just strangers waiting for a divorce.

“Monica?”

“Um, I’m here. I just took a shower,” Monica said, “I’m going to sleep for a while.”

“Aren’t you going to work?”

“I’m skipping work today. My dad can’t control me anyway.”

“Okay. As long as you’re happy. Even if you don’t go to work in the future, I’ll take care of you,” Micheal said gently.

“...” Monica felt that she had let Micheal down.

Micheal had been working hard for them to get back together.

As for her…

She was having an affair spiritually. She even almost had a real affair.

Monica asked, “Micheal, why don’t we have dinner together tonight?”

“Why are you suddenly asking me? I’m flattered.” Micheal was obviously excited.

Monica said, “After all, I miss you too.”

Right.

After all, she and Micheal were truly in love.

Finn was just a mistake!
