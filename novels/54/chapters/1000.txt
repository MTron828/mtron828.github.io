1001 Monica’s First Victory, Michael’s First Defeat Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I hate her.” Brie said bluntly, “You don’t like me because of her, and it’s because of her that we’re in this state. So, I want you to kill her with your own hands.”

“Now is not the time.” Michael rejected her request.

“If now is not the right time, it won’t be the right time in the future either.” Brie sneered, “Michael, you just can’t bear to kill her.”

“I told you. I no longer have any feelings for her.”

“That’s what you said, but what you’re doing is completely different,” Brie was not shy to expose his innermost thoughts. “I can help you do anything, but Michael, I don’t want to end up as cannon fodder. I don’t want to put in all my efforts, only to help you and Monica in the end. Perhaps I’m selfish, and I admit that I’m selfish, so selfish that I can’t accept you getting snatched away by any woman, especially Monica!”

Michael looked at Brie and her determined eyes coldly.

He knew Brie’s personality very well. If he did not fulfil her request, she would not agree to his arrangement.

At that, he could not help but clench his fists.

Even though Brie would die sooner or later, he had no choice but to obey her at that moment. Otherwise, if they fell out, he would not be able to clean up the mess.

He said, “Alright!”

Brie was still a little surprised by Michael’s sudden agreement.

“You’re right.” Michael said, “I can’t bear to part with Monica. I really can’t bear to see her die. Perhaps I really do still have feelings for her, and this feeling will not only hurt you, but it will also harm me! If it weren’t for my soft-heartedness toward Monica back then, Cardellini Enterprise would have long been reduced to ashes. I won’t allow such a woman, who is a great threat to my existence and has even made me suffer setbacks twice, to remain in this world.”

“Today. I want to see her die today!” Brie said.

Michael’s eyes narrowed.

“Once she dies, I’ll listen to your arrangements and leave Harken immediately. I’ll wait for you overseas.”

“Alright.” Michael did not even try to negotiate with Brie.

He agreed just like that.

Brie said, “In that case, I’ll go back and wait for your good news.”

“Yes.” Michael nodded.

Brie looked at Michael deep in the eyes before she left. The moment she left, her expression changed.

She smiled evilly.

Even if she was going to die, she would drag Monica down with her.

Besides, if Michael did not kill her but killed Monica with his own hands instead, that would also be a form of revenge against Michael!

She wanted Michael to regret treating her like that!

…

When Brie left, Michael’s expression was also extremely ugly.

He did not expect Brie’s condition would be to kill Monica. He had thought that her only condition was for him and her to be together.

Michael’s eyes turned cold!

However, that condition of hers was fine too. Monica was going to die anyway, but now, she would just die a little earlier than he had planned.

He had originally wanted to torture her, but Brie was forcing him to make that decision.

He picked up his phone and ordered coldly, “Find out where Monica is now!”

“Yes.” The other party was extremely respectful.

After a while, the other party replied, “Monica is now at the house of the little boy who died in the accident.”

“Did you drive there?”

“I saw her car parked by the side of the road.”

“Tamper with her brakes.”

“Yes.” The other party did not even need to ask why. They would only carry out orders numbly.

Michael hung up the phone.

Whether Monica would die or not depended on her own luck.

…

Monica left the little boy’s parents’ house.

Today’s news was huge, so the little boy’s parents had also watched the entire live broadcast and knew that the little boy’s direct death had nothing to do with Cardellini Enterprise.

However, from another perspective, if Cardellini Enterprise had not gotten into trouble, their child would not have become a scapegoat. No matter what, Cardellini Enterprise was responsible for the child’s death in some way.

Therefore, Monica went to apologize sincerely. It was inevitable that it was mostly acting before, but this time, it was with sincerity.

Although she had not been forgiven, she gave everything she thought she could to the middle-aged couple.

They were given 10 million in compensation, as well as the free use of all the drugs under the Cardellini Enterprise for life. No matter the price, as long as they used it, it was free.

It had to be said that as a businessman, such compensation was a huge loss.

However, she believed her father would approve of her compensation method.

Her family was most afraid of was having emotional debts.
