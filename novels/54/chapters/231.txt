Chapter 232: Jeanne Is Drunk

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone and picked up her bag to get off work.

As she got off work, she dialed again, “Godfather, I’ll see you at Chez Jeanne in a while. I’ll go pick up Kingsley now.”

“Okay, I’ll go over right away,” West quickly said, “Have you booked a private room?”

“Yes. You can just say my name.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne put down her phone and sat in the car parked at the door.

Miles drove to the hotel.

George asked, “Is Kingsley leaving tomorrow?”

“Are you sad?” Jeanne asked.

George shook his head.

Jeanne said, “Don’t worry, we’ll be able to leave soon.”

“Okay.” George smiled obediently.

Jeanne smiled as well.

She turned her head to look at the streets of South Hampton City.

It seemed that George did not like this place.

The car arrived at the hotel.

Kingsley opened the car door and got into the car.

The car drove toward Chez Jeanne again.

“Do you still need me to find some manpower for you?” Kingsley suddenly asked.

Jeanne shook her head. “That’s not necessary.”

“I’ll be leaving early tomorrow morning,” Kingsley said and asked George, “Do you want to leave with me?”

“No,” George refused flatly.

Kingsley was obviously a little hurt.

George said, “I’m afraid that if I leave, Fourth Master Swan would take Mom away.”

“...” Jeanne was a little speechless.

Kingsley smiled. “Then watch over your mom so that she won’t get taken away. I’ll leave it to you.”

“Okay.” George agreed immediately.

Jeanne rolled her eyes.

‘Am I so untrustworthy?!’

Kingsley and George chatted until they reached Chez Jeanne.

Everyone got out of the car. The moment Kingsley saw the name of the restaurant, he casually said, “The Swans’ business.”

“...” Jeanne turned to look at Kingsley.

She did not know.

Nonetheless, Kingsley had never been to South Hampton City before. How did he know so much about the businesses in South Hampton City?!

“Why don’t we go somewhere else?” Jeanne asked bluntly.

She knew very well that Kingsley hated the Swans very much.

Kingsley rejected her, “No thanks. I heard that this restaurant has the best home-cooked food in South Hampton City. I can taste them now.” He walked in with big strides.

Jeanne sometimes did not know what Kingsley’s standpoint was.

The group of people walked into the private room.

West was already waiting in the private room. When he saw Kingsley, he quickly went forward with enthusiasm. “Mr. Thorn, you came to South Hampton City.”

“It’s all because someone made me worried.” Kingsley glanced at Jeanne.

“Jeannie is capable enough,” West spoke up for Jeanne, “The case has implicated the Sanders of South Hampton City. Jeannie’s amazing to have been able to retreat unscathed.”

Kingsley smiled. “That’s true.”

Jeanne glanced at Kingsley.

Kingsley rarely praised her.

She had always felt that Kingsley had a prejudice against her.

As such, she was flattered at this moment.

“Sit down and eat. The food here is really good. I’ve been here a few times,” West said.

Kingsley nodded.

The group sat down.

A table full of food was served.

During the meal, West ordered some wine.

Kingsley and West drank.

Jeanne said, “I want to drink some.”

Kingsley looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne said bluntly, “I haven’t drunk in a long time.”

“Weren’t you drunk the last time?” Kingsley raised his eyebrow.

The last time was with Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne was unhappy. “It’s been a long time since the last time.”

“Look how alcoholic you are! Who did you take after?” Kingsley was helpless. He picked up a bottle of red wine and prepared to pour it for her.

“I want white wine,” Jeanne refused.

“...” Kingsley looked at her.

“Red wine is meaningless,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

“You can’t hold your liquor well.”

“But I like it.”

“You’re as stubborn as your mother.” Kingsley was speechless.

In the end, he got the waiter to bring Jeanne a local white wine.

The waiter poured Jeanne some.

Jeanne took a sip.

It was spicy, but it was very refreshing.

She drank a lot.

Kingsley also let Jeanne be.

In fact, Jeanne could only let her guard down and drink in front of Kingsley.

The last time she drank with Fourth Master Swan and the others did not count.

She admitted that she drank a little too much that night, but it was not to the extent of being completely drunk.

Moreover, it was not satisfying.

It was not satisfying at all.

“Have some food.” Kingsley took some food for Jeanne. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He took some pork ribs for her. They were famous in this city

Jeanne looked at the ribs then at Kingsley.

In actuality, Kingsley treated her very well.
