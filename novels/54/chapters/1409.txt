Chapter 1410: The Failed Birthday Surprise

Thank you readers!

Suddenly, Candice called out to him, “George.”

George stopped in his tracks.

“Happy birthday,” Candice said.

At that moment, a confetti cannon suddenly sounded in the room. It was released by Nox and Finn, and it made the atmosphere very lively.

Paige shouted excitedly as she looked at the confetti. However, the main character, George, was unusually cold. He bit his lip lightly, and before he could speak, he saw Candice walking out with a birthday cake.

There were ten candles on the birthday cake as it was his tenth birthday. With the cake in front of him, he became the center of attention and was surrounded by everyone.

“This is the first time I’m celebrating your birthday with you. I thought about it a lot and wanted to give you a big surprise, but in the end, I chose the most ordinary method to celebrate with you. Because in my opinion, the interaction between families can be ordinary but also heartwarming.” Candice looked at the cold George and said sincerely, “I don’t know how good I’ll be at guiding you through anything in life, but I can guarantee that I will do my best to take care of you and Paige.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone listened to Candice, including Monica, who was actually a little touched.

Perhaps Candice was just trying to please Edward. After all, Edward’s status was so high that any woman would want to be in his life, and that was why she would always think of ways to gain Edward’s favor and please Edward’s child.

Even so, Monica was moved by Candice’s sincerity. She believed that Candice sincerely wanted to treat George well and integrate herself into the family.

Not only Monica but everyone else in the room believed her.

It was at that moment that Nox seemed to understand why Edward had fallen for another woman other than Jeanne so quickly. Edward was probably moved.

In his opinion, the person who always sacrificed in Edward and Jeanne’s relationship was Edward. However, in Edward and Candice’s relationship, he saw Candice’s efforts.

For a moment there, he actually thought it was good that Edward, that lonely man, finally found someone he deserved.

In the quiet hall, George kept quiet. Despite that, Candice did not feel embarrassed. It was as if she knew that George would behave like that and that was why she did not choose to do a huge birthday celebration.

She was not afraid that she would be embarrassed. On the contrary, she was afraid that she would put George in a difficult position.

She smiled calmly. “Make a wish.”

That was all she said because she believed that her sincerity would show, and George would be able to feel it one day. There was no need to rush.

“I don’t celebrate my birthday.” George stared straight at Candice.

George had always been sensible and would not voice his dislikes as he was used to enduring them. However, he was so against Candice’s actions at that moment.

Candice’s throat moved slightly. Even though she had made all the preparations, she still felt a little upset because of George’s rejection.

“My mother gave birth to me on my birthday.” George’s voice, the voice of a ten-year-old boy, was too low and cold. “So, only she can spend it with me. Since she’s dead, I will never celebrate it. ”

Candice bit her lip. She, too, was touched by the relationship George had with his mother.

As expected, she had crossed his boundaries.

“I’m sorry.” Candice smiled faintly to hide the awkwardness between them.

George looked at Candice’s suppressed smile and the disappointment in her eyes before turning around and leaving coldly. He went straight upstairs, leaving everyone in silence.

Edward got up and planned to follow him upstairs.

“I’ll go.” Monica immediately stopped Edward. Edward stopped in his tracks and tacitly agreed.

Candice said to Edward, “It’s alright.”

It really did not matter. She was not upset because George did not give her an out, but because she did not know what else she could do to make George feel her sincerity.

“Let’s eat.” Candice changed the topic.

At that moment, Nox quickly echoed, “Yes, yes, yes. Let’s eat. I’m starving.”

Edward nodded. Then, he held Candice’s hand and walked to the dining table together. His grip on her hand was a little tight.

Candice felt helpless. She was really fine, and Edward did not need to be so worried about her..
