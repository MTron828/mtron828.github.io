Chapter 33: Fourth Master Swan Spoke up for Jeanne

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne ended the video call with Kingsley.

She turned her head to look at George, who was sitting in front of the computer and seemed to be doing something very seriously.

Jeanne stood up and walked toward him.

George stopped typing on the keyboard.

Jeanne said, “George, I’m not afraid of anyone. It’s just that I need to endure it sometimes.”

“I...” George bit his lip. “I don’t want to see you get hurt.”

That was why he had complained to Kingsley.

Jeanne patted George’s little head. “When the time is right, I’ll take even more drastic measures to get it back.”

“Okay.” George nodded hard.

Jeanne did not say anything more. She did not want to waste time on unnecessary things. She looked at George’s computer screen. “How long will the Lockes’ loan be due?”

“Tomorrow.”

“Okay.” The corners of Jeanne’s mouth curled up.

It was time for the Lockes to end!

Jeanne turned around and was about to take out her phone when she realized that her phone had been smashed by Thedus.

She was not used to not having a phone.

At this moment, someone suddenly knocked on the door. “Eldest Young Lady.”

Jeanne opened the door.

“Eldest Young Lady, Master wants you and Little Master to go downstairs for dinner,” the servant said respectfully.

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

The servant left.

Jeanne returned to her room. As she changed, she said to George, “Let’s go downstairs for dinner.”

“But...” George looked at her. He was probably worried that what happened just now would happen again.

“Don’t worry. With the Swans around, nothing will happen.”

Jeanne knew it too well. If it was not for the Swans, Alexander would never have asked the servant to call her for dinner. Therefore, tonight’s dinner would be very peaceful.

She changed into a set of clothes and went downstairs with George.

In the hall downstairs, she could hear Alexander and Eden’s father, Henry, talking and laughing from afar. They seemed unusually harmonious.

Jeanne held George’s hand and went over.

At this moment, Alexander also called out to the Swans, “In-laws, Fourth Master Swan, let’s have a casual meal together.”

Jeanne was not quite sure why Fourth Master Swan was still here. In fact, it had nothing to do with her. She was just a little surprised. It was rumored that Fourth Master Swan hated social events the most. Even so, in the past few days... Fourth Master Swan seemed to be very free.

Everyone walked into the luxurious hall of the Lawrence Residence.

The seats of honor were naturally for Henry and Alexander. Edward sat next to his big brother. Eden sat next to Edward. Beside Edward was Jasmine, followed by Joshua, Jeanne, and George. Beside Alexander sat Jenifer, followed by Henry’s wife, Belle. As it was a round table, Belle was next to George.

During the meal, Alexander and Henry were still chatting and laughing. Occasionally, Alexander would deliberately find a topic to chat with Edward. Naturally, the others did not say much. Eden and the others would occasionally chime in at the right time. Only Jeanne and George were eating dinner seriously.

“Oh right, the matter between Jeanne and the Lockes today...” Henry suddenly took the initiative to bring it up.

Alexander’s expression turned a little unsightly at that moment.

He forced a smile and said, “Thedus did such an outrageous thing. I can’t possibly let Jeanne marry him.”

“That’s true.” Henry agreed. “We watched Jeannie grow up as well. She should find a good man. I originally thought that the second son of the Lockes would be disciplined after a lesson. I didn’t expect him to still be like that.”

“I also didn’t expect Thedus to be so unrepentant,” Alexander said with some anger.

“This marriage was supposedly good. It’s a pity that it has become like this,” Henry said, “I heard that the Lockes and MUK have been talking about collaborating recently. If the deal is successful, the Lawrences and the Lockes together can seize Harken’s e-commerce market in just a matter of time.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Alexander was a little embarrassed at this moment.

The people at the table were all business savvy, so how could they not tell what Henry was trying to say? He was obviously unhappy with the fact that the marriage between the Lawrences and the Lockes was broken off.

To the Swans, the Lawrences were already of a lower class than them. If the Lawrences could reach a higher class, it would be even better. Moreover, if the Lawrences and the Lockes cooperated with the MUK this time, the Swans could help them and also gain benefits in the e-commerce market.

“I know too. It’s just that things are unpredictable...” Alexander tried to explain.

Fourth Master Swan suddenly said, “The Lockes won’t be successful. If the Lawrences were to cooperate with them, it would be the Lawrences’ loss.”

Henry turned his head and looked at his fourth brother.

Edward was 20 years younger than him. He was born when Old Master Swan was 45 years old while Old Madam Swan was 43 years old. Due to his outstanding IQ, Old Master Swan valued Edward very much.

It was worth noting that Edward had been groomed differently from other people since he was young. Given his high IQ, he was naturally much more outstanding than the average person. Once he reached adulthood, Old Master Swan entrusted all the matters of the Swans to him to take care of. Of course, this caused the other brothers to be dissatisfied, but because of Edward’s ability, they had no choice but to accept it. In these years, although he was the youngest, he was the one who had the most say in the family apart from Old Master Swan.

“No matter how capable Damian is, his thoughts are stubborn and old-fashioned. He can’t keep up with the development of the current market. Of his two sons, his eldest son is mediocre and only muddles along. His second son is a scumbag. He knows nothing but how to play with women. Sooner or later, something will happen to the Lockes. If the Lawrences and the Lockes become in-laws, once something happens, the Lawrences will be implicated.” Edward’s tone was neither slow nor hurried. There was a kind of majesty that could not be refuted. “Jeanne made the right move by taking advantage of this incident to reasonably break off the engagement with the Lockes..”

“I think so too.” Alexander quickly followed Edward’s words and gave himself a way out.

He was also afraid that any disturbance would affect the marriage between Jasmine and Eden. To the Lawrences, the most important thing at this moment was this marriage with the Swans. He did not dare to make any mistakes at all.

Seeing that Edward had said so, Henry did not bring it up again.

In any case, if the old master were to ask, it would be Edward who would explain the matter. The others did not have much of a say, to begin with.

“Since that’s the case, don’t think too much about it. That said, Jeannie isn’t young anymore. It’s better to find someone to marry her as soon as possible,” Henry remarked.

“Jeannie has a child with her, so her situation is quite special. As her father, of course, I’ll try my best to find a good man for her.”

“Parents tend to worry about their children indeed...” Henry echoed.

…

The meal was rather enjoyable.

After dinner, the Swans were not in a hurry to leave. They drank some wine during dinner, so Alexander served them some tea after that.

Jeanne took George for a walk in the back garden.

Usually, George spent too much time in the room. When he had the time, she would drag him out to exercise more, even if he did not like it.

They walked a few rounds in the small garden that was a little dim.

Their footsteps suddenly stopped.

Jeanne looked at the man in front of her who deliberately blocked her path.
