Chapter 161: Fourth Master Swan, Enough Is Enough

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He just could not accept that Edward is doting on his lover so much.

Edward was very calm about Nox’s excitement.

Actually, it was not Jeanne.

Jeanne was avoiding him now and would not provoke him.

He said, “If she likes it, then let her be.”

“...” Nox slapped his forehead.

There was no hope.

Edward was completely hopeless.

…

Jeanne sat in the car and returned to the Lawrence family’s manor.

She lowered her head and kept watching the news.

At the moment, the news was normal and there were no other unexpected situations.

The video that Klaus posted on the internet was shared and liked by many people in South Hampton City.

Jeanne exited the news app.

Only Tomorrow, Klaus and the people from the planning bureau of the administrative office would discuss the traffic planning plan.

It was a success.

This matter could come to an end.

She did not want to waste too much time on one thing.

To be precise.

She did not want to stay in South Hampton city for too long.

It was not that she was afraid of this city, but that she had provoked Fourth Master Swan.

She did not want to confront him directly, so she wanted to leave as soon as possible.

“Ms.Lawrence,” Teddy suddenly said from the passenger seat.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

She looked at Teddy. “Yes, Mr. Dollite?”

“Actually, the Fourth Master is quite a good man,” Teddy said.

Jeanne pursed her lips. “Why do you say that, Mr. Dolittle?”

“Other than you, he has never brought any other woman to the Bamboo Garden. Today, Ms.Sanders has come uninvited.”

“Is that so?”

“He has always let any woman get close to him. Not even within a meter.”

“...”

“He has never smiled at any woman, only at Ms.Lawrence.”

“...”

“He is also very handsome, has a good figure, is rich and powerful...”

“Mr. Dolittle.” Jeanne interrupted him, “What are you saying?”

She really did not want to hear too much about the so-called merits of Fourth Master Swan.

Teddy said, “He really likes you.”

Jeanne looked at Teddy.

She smiled lightly. “Mr. Dolittle is really thoughtful regarding the matter between Fourth Master and me, but...”

“I know that I can’t be of any use between the two of you. I just want to tell Ms.Lawrence that it’s not easy for him to like someone. He’s actually not as arrogant as others may think. He hides a lot of unknown and cruel experiences. If Ms.Lawrence can, I hope that you can give him some warmth.” Teddy said very seriously to Jeanne, “He needs warmth.”

‘No, Teddy. He only needed someone to accompany him to bed.’ Jeanne thought.

Jeanne did not change her expression and smiled. “I understand what you mean. It’s just that you may have a misunderstanding about the matter between me and Fourth Master Swan.”

“Misunderstanding?” Teddy’s face was full of confusion.

“Fourth Master Swan doesn’t like me. He just wants me to help him get rid of Melody’s entanglement.”

“That’s not it...” Teddy retorted.

“He clearly knew that Melody would take revenge on me, yet he still announced our relationship to the public without permission. Isn’t that just to let Melody take revenge on Me?” Jeanne said calmly, “Mr. Dolittle, you’ve been by Fourth Master Swan’s side for so many years. You should be very clear about his thoughts.”

“I clearly told you that the Fourth Master likes you.”

“Help me tell him this – I won’t go back on my promise. I also hope that the Fourth Master can do what he promised me.”

“...” Did Ms.Lawrence have a heart of stone?

Edward Swan loved her so much.

Could she really not see it?

Did she deliberately choose to ignore it?

The car arrived at the Lawrence family manor.

Jeanne got out of the car.

She smiled politely. “Thank you for the ride, Mr. Dollite. Take care.”

Teddy pursed his lips.

He felt that it would not be easy for Edward to chase after Ms.Lawrence.

Jeanne walked into the manor and went straight to her room.

In the room, George was typing on the keyboard. His entire little face was distorted.

Jeanne walked towards her son. “What’s wrong?”

“Mom, you’re back.”

“Yes.”

“Are you injured?” George noticed the wound on Jeanne’s forehead.

“It’s just a small wound.” Jeanne did not care. “What are you doing?”

“Huff.” George took a deep breath. “Master asked me to work on the blueprint.”

“...”

“I don’t like it.”

“After all, he’s your master. Just listen to him.”

“He forced me to take him as my master.”

“...”

He was too intelligent and had many troubles.

For example, he was liked by too many people.

Jeanne rubbed George’s soft curly hair. “Be good.”

George pursed his lips.

What else could he do if he was not good?

Jeanne saw that George was once again immersed in the design with a bitter expression on his face. She turned around and lay on the bed.

After tormenting herself for half a day, she was actually a little tired.

She wanted to sleep for a while.

On Fourth Master Swan’s bed, she could not fall asleep for even a second.

She changed out of the clothes that Fourth Master Swan had prepared for her, put on her pajamas, and lay on the bed.

Kingsley called.

She picked it up. “Hello.”

“I heard that you were injured.” Someone asked from the other side.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

George was astonishingly fast in spreading the news.

“I won’t die.”

“Are you sure you want to continue like this with the Sanders? Are you sure you don’t need me to make a move?” Kingsley raised his eyebrows.

Jeanne said, “I can handle it.”

“I know you’re unhappy with the Sanders, but you have to have a limit,” Kingsley reminded.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“I don’t want to see you get hurt, and I don’t want you to be too harsh with the Sanders. You should know what I mean.”

Jeanne did not answer.

Her expression was rather twisted.

“Jeanne, I did not force you back then. But since you have chosen this path, you have to know your own identity.”

“Did the Sanders say anything to you?” Jeanne asked.

“Melody had almost gone mad because of you.!”

“That was not me, it was the Fourth Master Swan.”

“Jeanne, enough is enough.”

Jeanne held her phone tightly.

“Melody ordered the administrative office to stop Klaus’ planning and design regardless of the overall situation. This matter had a great impact on the internal management of the Sanders. In a fit of anger, Warren Sanders placed Melody under house arrest. You have to know that Melody is Warren’s favorite daughter.”

Jeanne bit her lip.

She really did not expect Melody to do this.

Did she not care about the consequences?

“Tomorrow, Klaus and the planning department will come to an agreement on the transportation plan. The construction of the Lawrence Enterprise logistics warehouse will proceed smoothly. Because of this project, you have already made a name for yourself in South Hampton City and have already displayed your abilities within the Lawrence Enterprise. And because of you, Melody has also received a lesson. In the end, you won a big victory.” Kingsley was very serious, “So, it ends here.”

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

Since she had already achieved her goal, there was no need for her to waste her energy dealing with some unimportant people.

“And the matters with Fourth Master Swan end here as well,” Kingsley added.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She said bluntly, “I’m afraid that won’t work.”

“Jeanne.” It was rare for Kingsley to lose his temper.

“Unless you can make the Sanders give up the idea of a marriage alliance with Fourth Master Swan.”

“This is not something that you should concern yourself with.”

“In fact, I have already gotten myself involved. To put it bluntly, I have already become Fourth Master Swan’s cover to reject the Sanders. If the Sanders doesn’t let go, I won’t be able to escape unscathed.”

“I shouldn’t have let you come back.”

Jeanne’s eyes turned cold.

“I shouldn’t have let you come back for revenge! I can make you give up right now.” Kingsley added.

Jeanne’s expression was dark and cold. At that moment, she gripped her phone tightly and did not say a word.

“Think carefully about what to do next. Don’t let me really stop you from avenging your mother.”

Kingsley enunciated each word clearly.
