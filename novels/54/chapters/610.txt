Chapter 611: Alexander Exposed, Revenge Feels Great

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, under everyone’s gazes, Alexander held himself together. He told himself that Jeanne was just bluffing and that she did not have anything.

With that, he braced himself and walked over to look at the huge television screen.

On the screen displayed the main hall of the Lawrence family’s manor.

It looked like it was filmed from above.

Alexander’s expression instantly changed.

There were no surveillance cameras installed in the house. They were all installed in the garden or at the main entrance for security purposes. To ensure everyone’s privacy, they had never installed surveillance cameras in the house, so how could there be one now?

If there were… His face turned pale.

He wanted to go forward and stop Jeanne from playing the video when the screen suddenly showed the scene of him pushing Jonathan out of the room.

Alexander was utterly stunned, whereas others were watching the video very seriously.

In the video, Alexander pushed Jonathan and stopped at the stairwell on the second floor.

Jonathan seemed a little confused as he said sternly to Alexander, “It’s so late. Why are you pushing me out?”

“I haven’t talked to you for a long time, so I thought of taking a walk with you in the garden.”

“What’s there to talk about at this time of night? Let’s talk about it tomorrow!” Jonathan was visibly a little impatient.

Alexander’s cold expression could be seen clearly on the screen. “Tomorrow? I’m afraid we can’t talk about it tomorrow.”

“What do you mean?” Jonathan roared.

It seemed like, at that moment, Jonathan could sense something strange going on. Hence, he pushed the wheelchair with his own hand and was about to return to the bedroom.

However, Alexander stopped him.

“Alexander, what are you trying to do?”

“What do you think I’m going to do?” Alexander pushed Jonathan’s wheelchair fiercely as if he was going to push him down the stairs.

Jonathan roared, “How dare you!”

“What’s there to be afraid of? Didn’t you teach me to do whatever it takes to achieve my goal?”

“I can’t believe you want to kill me!” Jonathan was smart, so he immediately thought of it.

“If I don’t kill you, how can I inherit Lawrence Enterprise!”

“Are you crazy?”

“I’m not crazy, I know what I’m doing. Before you change your will and give the Lawrences to Jeanne, I will inherit your inheritance. I’ve consulted the lawyer. Once you die, I will be the first successor, and all your shares in Lawrence Enterprise will be mine!” Alexander looked cruel.

The people watching the video gasped as they were all frightened by Alexander’s expression.

On the other hand, Alexander seemed to have stiffened up.

‘No, how could Jeanne have that clip? How could she have the entire clip of me killing Jonathan?’

“Alexander, when did I say I would give the Lawrence Enterprise to Jeanne? I’m just using Jeanne’s ability to grow the company! How can you be so stupid!”

“Don’t lie to me. Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing with Jeanne. You’re deliberately scheming against me to make me voluntarily give my shares to Jeanne. Dad, I’ve seen a lot of your schemes over the years! If I listen to your lies now, my life would really be in vain.”

“Alexander!”

“Dad, I think you have lived enough of this life. Your control over my life has come to an end. Now die!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Alex–”

In the video, Alexander mercilessly pushed Jonathan down the second floor.

“Ah!” The people watched in horror as Jonathan rolled down the second floor, and when he stopped at the end of the stairs, he was covered in blood.

Alexander stood there with a cold expression and even a cruel smile on his lips. He did not sympathize with his father, who had just fallen down the stairs.

Even when he saw Jonathan not moving after the fall, he walked down the stairs with a calm expression on his face and looked at Jonathan bleeding out from above.

However, Jonathan was not yet dead.

He looked up as if wanting Alexander to save him, but Alexander did not.

Not only did Alexander not have a shred of pity, but he also squatted down and approached Jonathan. Then, he even grabbed Jonathan’s head and kept hitting it on the ground to kill him once and for all.

Jonathan was already covered in injuries from falling down the stairs anyway, so a few more would not hurt.
