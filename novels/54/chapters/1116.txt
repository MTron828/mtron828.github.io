1117 Edward and Kingsley’s Alliance

He should run to keep himself alive for a while longer, and it would give Kingsley a little more chance to escape.

The assassin was moved by Lucy’s actions.

As an assassin, he should not have any emotions except for carrying out orders.

In the face of life and death, the fact that Lucy was willing to do so much for Kingsley... Who could say that it was not because she loved him too deeply?

The assassin left quickly after Lucy pushed him away.

At that moment, he was escaping only for Lucy because he did not want to disappoint her in the end.

When he left, Lucy slumped to the ground, with her face, body, and internal organs bleeding. Her consciousness was slipping, as well as everything else.

She looked straight up at the white clouds in front of her and watched as they become more blurry.

Suddenly, an image appeared in her mind. It was a scene that still stayed in her mind after so many years.

She saw Kingsley the first time she met him.

She was on a mission, which was to assassinate him, and the best way to assassinate Kingsley was to seduce him.

That was the first time she used a skill she had never used before on Kingsley.

At that time, she and Kingsley had done it. When she thought that Kingsley was not paying attention, she hid a very, very thin wire in her mouth in an attempt to strangle him.

However, Kingsley saw through it with one glance.

In an instant, she was shackled by Kingsley.

That was the first time she failed a mission since she became an assassin.

She had originally thought that after that time, she would take a sum of money and leave the business to wander the world.

In the end, she failed, and failure meant she would die.

She had already made all the necessary preparations, but at that moment, she heard Kingsley say, “I like you.”

Lucy looked at him in disbelief.

“You’re pretty good in bed,” Kingsley said.

Lucy pursed her lips. She did not think that was a reason for him to keep her.

“Follow me from now on.” Kingsley did not give her any reason to refuse.

Besides, she could not refuse because rejection meant death. However, betrayal would also lead to death.

“Don’t worry. You and I will destroy your organization.” Kingsley was a man of his word.

It only took them a week to kill every single member of the organization that had once controlled her.

From then on, she would not allow anyone to threaten her life because of her betrayal.

From then on, she knew that she owed Kingsley her life because he saved her.

Later on, she found out that Kingsley had only kept her because the most important person in his life, Jeanne, had appeared.

He needed a top-notch female assassin to train Jeanne, and it was obvious that she was the only one at that time!

Nevertheless, she still decided to be loyal to him. She was even glad that he had brought her back to the Hills.

It finally made her understand what it meant to be valued, and it allowed her to find back the feelings she had lost.

Yet now, she suddenly regretted it.

It was not that she regretted dying, but what she regretted was that she should not have agreed to Kingsley. If she had not agreed, Kingsley would not have shown any mercy, and she might not have had to go through so much.

Perhaps she would not have to experience so many things that she felt were crueler than death.

If there was a next life, she hoped that she would not go on that mission. Even if she went on that mission, she hoped that Kingsley would not... let her live.

Her heart had been hurt too badly, and she did not want to experience it again.

Then, her vision went dark.

‘Goodbye, Kingsley.’

They would never see each other again.

…

As the sound of gunfire continued to ring out, the group quickly left in the opposite direction of the gunshots.

Amidst the footsteps, Kerby suddenly fell down.

Everyone turned around to look at him.

There was no time to waste.

Once the other party realized that it was not Kingsley, they would immediately give chase, and it would be even more difficult for them to escape.

However, at that moment, Kingsley did not blame Kerby.

All he saw was Kerby’s red eyes filled with tears.

That was an emotion that an assassin should not have. However, because of Lucy’s death, she still cried.

Although they had gone their separate ways in two different directions, the assassins had walkie-talkies with them.

The distance between the two parties was not far enough for the walkie-talkies to lose signal, so they could hear the conversation between Lucy and the assassin clearly.

They could even hear the gunshots clearly.

That sentence of her pleading for him to leave was said with her last bit of strength, and it should be a farewell.

Lucy was dead, and she had died for Kingsley. Before she died, she was still trying to buy more time for Kingsley to live.

...

That woman who had always been silent and extremely tenacious...

“Kerby!” Kingsley pulled him up.

Kerby did not fall on purpose and did not want to waste time.

However, at that moment, he was really upset. In the face of such a dangerous situation, he did not even have the right to feel upset.

He saw Kingsley, who did not have that right either.

Kingsley had also heard Lucy’s entire conversation, but he did not respond. There was not a single trace of emotion on his face.

Kerby did feel sorry for Lucy. She should have been like the assassin who left with Lucy. It was necessary to follow orders, but there was no need to risk her life for the man who had abandoned her.

It was really not worth it.

Kerby controlled his emotions and continued to leave with Kingsley.

After walking for a distance, Edward stopped in his tracks.

Nox naturally followed Edward.

...

Edward said, “Kingsley, I’ll stop here. Next–”

Kingsley nodded.

Before Edward could say anything, he already knew what Edward was going to say.

The reason why Edward stopped talking was that he saw a tear fall from Kingsley’s eye.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
