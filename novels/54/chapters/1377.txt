1378 Do I Have To Dig My Heart Out For You To See It?

However, only now did he realize that he was wrong.

Monica did not believe that he was sincere and would not give him the chance to take the initiative to reconcile. She had really let it go, and he was very familiar with letting go of someone.

That year, when Monica abandoned him, he also felt the same. If not for the fact that Monica almost died for him, he would never give himself the chance to accept her.

Then, they would never be in each other’s lives anymore and would drift further and further apart.

“You don’t need time.” Monica’s eyes were blurred with tears, but her voice was calm.

Finn looked at her and saw the tears streaming down her face, but there was no trace of sadness on her face. It was as if… tears were not a product of sadness but a natural reaction of the body.

She said, “You don’t need time. You’ll do just fine.”

She, on the other hand, needed a lot of time to let go of her feelings for Finn.

She admitted that she was very selfish as she had been ready to break up with Finn for almost a year now. Although she had spent a year forgetting about Finn, she did not tell Finn about it, nor did she let him prepare to break up with her like she did.

That was because she knew Finn could take good care of himself and that he would do just fine.

“Finn.” Monica said, “I hope that the next woman in your life will make you understand what love is.”

“There won’t be another one.”

Monica’s eyes flickered.

“You’re the only one in my life.”

Monica smiled and remained indifferent to Finn’s confession. Her hard work over the past year of keeping herself indifferent to Finn was not in vain.

She said, “I won’t be.”

She was certain that Finn would have another woman in his life. He might be alone for a long time, but when he felt lonely and needed a family, he would find a woman to build a family with him.

He was very good at taking care of himself and he knew what was best for him, so she did not have to worry that he would not be doing well.

She stretched out her hand and forcefully pried Finn’s hand away from the elevator door.

At that moment, the elevator was already ringing. It was a warning.

She pried Finn’s fingers apart, one by one. It was as if she was slowly cutting off her relationship with Finn.

Finn watched as the elevator doors closed as if his entire world had been shut off, and a teardrop fell from his eyes.

Inside the elevator, Monica’s tears were streaming down her face, and she could not stop it. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As expected, she was not as strong as she thought. She did not think that her long-planned breakup would hurt her so much.

“Do you want to go back?” Brandon looked at Monica.

In the beginning, he really thought that if Monica and Finn broke up, so be it.

Since Finn did not love Monica that much and Monica did not love Finn that much, their relationship should have ended long ago.

However, at that moment, he suddenly felt that that was not true. Finn loved Monica more than he thought, and Monica was not as heartless as she thought.

“No,” Monica said.

She did not want to repeat the same mistake again. She no longer wanted to hold onto any expectations or give herself any hope.

She and Finn were over. Even if she missed him one day, she would never regret it.
