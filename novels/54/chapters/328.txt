Chapter 329: The Wedding: Jeanne, My Heart!

“Fourth Master Swan is here to pick up the bride!” Nox’s voice rang out in the Lawrence family manor.

Jeanne’s heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Her heartbeat was irregular and somewhat crazy.

She did not know what she was looking forward to at that moment, but she felt strangely excited. Before she could react, Monica suddenly stood up. Completely ignoring the fact that she was wearing three-inch high heels on her feet, she rushed to the door and quickly closed it.

Jeanne was stunned by Monica’s sudden action.

By then, George had already woken up. He was wearing a custom-made white suit that possessed many similarities to Jeanne’s gown. Not to mention the color, the embroidery was incredibly exquisite. It was clearly just formal attire for a child, but the workmanship was shocking. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Wearing it, George really did look like a noble young master from a prestigious family.

At that moment, everyone in the room, including more than ten makeup artists and staff members, instantly turned their attention to Monica.

Monica did not care about her image at all, or to put it bluntly, she did not have any. She put herself against the door, and her expression was particularly exaggerated.

She did not look like a rich young lady at all.

She said excitedly, “Jeannie, you can’t give yourself to him so easily.”

Without even thinking about it, Jeanne knew that the girl must have a plan.

Just at the right time, knocking sounds came from outside the door, followed by Nox’s somewhat exaggerated voice. “Bride, open the door. The groom is here to pick you up!”

......

Monica yelled from inside, “Who said that we have to hand the bride over when the groom is here? There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch!”

“Monica, I just knew you would be the worst! Tell me. What do you want us to do!” Nox looked as if he had already mentally prepared himself.

Monica said loudly, “How about this? I’ll give you two three-year-old brain teasers. If you answer correctly, I’ll open the door.”

“This is an insult to my intelligence. Tell me now!”

“What five-letter word becomes shorter when you add five letters to it?” Monica asked loudly.

When she asked the question, not only were the people outside guessing, but the people inside were also guessing.

There was some noise outside but no answer.

“I’ll give you ten seconds to answer,” Monica said loudly. The countdown had not yet started.

“Short.” Finn’s voice came from outside the door.

Monica gritted her teeth.

When the answer was revealed, the people inside exclaimed in realization.

“Is that right?” Nox asked.

“Next!” Monica said again, “What does an elephant’s ear look like?”

“A fan!” Nox answered almost without thinking.

Monica laughed out loud. “Wrong! Nox, you’re no smarter than a three-year-old child.”

Nox began cursing outside.

“I’ll give you one more chance. What does an elephant’s ear look like?” Monica looked as if she had succeeded.

“It looks like the other ear.” Finn’s voice sounded again.

Monica was completely stunned.

F*ck. How did that b*stard Finn know?

Outside the door, Nox was also a little surprised too. He sighed at Finn. “Brother, you’re pretty amazing!”

Finn smiled in response.

Last night, a certain woman at home was probably more excited than today’s bride. She made a lot of noise, saying that she would not allow the Fourth Master to marry Jeannie so smoothly tomorrow. Hence, she spent the whole night coming up with something at home, and he accidentally saw the brain teasers on a piece of paper. However, he did not know what questions she had prepared, so he memorized them before going to bed last night.

As expected, Monica only remembered the simplest ones.

“Are you done?” Nox asked.

“No! You only answered two questions that three-year-old children can answer, and you want to take our bride away?”

“If you have any other requests, tell us now, and we will satisfy all of them.” Nox’s tone was a bit sloppy, but it was better to liven up the atmosphere on such an occasion.

“I don’t want you to fulfill them! Go to your side!” Monica shouted towards the door, “Where’s the groom?”

“Here.” Edward’s magnetic voice sounded.

It was just one word, but it made Jeanne, who was sitting in the room and already a little nervous, feel her heart skip a few beats.

Something in her eyes moved as she stared at the door intently.

Her gown was too extravagant, so she sat on the edge of the bed the entire time, from after putting on her clothes to putting on her makeup. The white hem of her gown was spread all over the floor.
