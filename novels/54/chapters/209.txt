Chapter 210: Jeanne’s Identity as a Rich Person Was Exposed in Public

“If 30 million dollars is just a drop in the bucket for my client, do you still think that my client would do something for personal gain?!” Judah stared at Josiah and asked.

Josiah was stunned. “What do you mean?!”

Judah completely ignored Josiah.

He turned around and walked to the middle of the court, closer to the judges and the trial bench.

Judah asked, “Your Honor, can I ask you a few questions?”

“Sure.”

“Your Honor, how many years have you been a judge?”

“15 years.”

“Have you adjudicated many cases?”

“My preliminary estimate is close to a thousand cases.”

“So, Your Honor, you have a lot of experience in adjudicating cases.”

“Please get to the point,” the judge said with a cold face.

It seemed that he was not that approachable, nor was he that easy to please.

“Understood,” Judah said respectfully, “Your Honor, logically, if a person has 50,000 dollars, would she do something illegal for 3 dollars?”

The judge said bluntly, “No.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Then if she has 5 million dollars, would she do something obviously illegal for 3,000 dollars?”

“No,” the judge continued to answer.

“If it was 50 billion dollars, would she do something illegal for 30 million dollars?” Judah continued to ask.

The judge frowned.

“Your honor, logically, would she do that?”

“No! “The judge was very sure.

“Thank you for your answer, Your Honor.” Judah turned his head and faced everyone in the audience.

Everyone seemed to be surprised that Judah suddenly asked those questions.

Judah said, “I believe that everyone has heard it clearly just now. If a person has 50 billion dollars in assets, it’s impossible for her to do something illegal for a mere 30 million dollars. As long as the person can think straight, it’s impossible for her to do it. So...”

The courtroom was silent.

It was as if everyone was waiting for an answer from Judah.

“So, my client, Ms. Lawrence, has 53 billion dollars worth of assets in her private account, which is three times more than the Lawrence Enterprise’s 18 billion dollars worth of assets. Do you think that she needs to make such a small profit through the enterprise?”

Judah enunciated each word, causing everyone present to be in an uproar.

It was breaking news indeed. Everyone was in disbelief.

In the midst of the shock, Judah took out a USB flash drive and had a staff reveal one of Jeanne’s account information on the spot.

On the big screen, it could be seen that Jeanne had many foreign exchange banks. After converting, the total was equivalent to 53 billion dollars.

“These are my client’s bank cards. There are a total of ten foreign exchange banks. I’ll hand it to the judge. Your Honor, I hope you can verify the amount again.” Judah took out a stack of bank cards and passed them to a staff member.

The staff member quickly passed them to the judge.

Next, the judge ordered people to verify them.

At this moment, the courtroom was extremely quiet.

No one believed it.

It was not just Joshua, Eden, and Melody who were unwilling to believe it.

Monica was irritable.

‘Isn’t Jeanne supposed to be very poor?!

‘Wasn’t she living a miserable life abroad with George?!

‘F*ck.

‘Who exactly is Jeanne?!’

In less than ten minutes, the staff returned and reported the results of the verification to the judge.

The judge nodded.

Then, he said to everyone, “After verification, we confirmed that Jeanne has a total of 53 billion dollars!”

Everyone was once again in an uproar.

Monica could not hold it in anymore. She said loudly, “Jeanne, you d*mn rich woman. You lied to me!”

She looked as if she had suffered a great injustice.

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

She had not lied to Monica.

The person who insisted on buying her a car back then was not her either.

Nox, who was next to Monica, could not remain calm either.

He counted with his fingers and seemed to be unable to count. He could not help but curse in a low voice, “F*ck.”

53 billion dollars.

Even Fourth Master Swan did not have so many personal assets.

Although the Swans definitely had much more than that, the assets belonged to the Swans. To put it bluntly, they belonged to Old Master Swan. Fourth Master Swan was just a worker. The assets could or could not belong to him.

‘F*ck.’

Nox suddenly felt that Fourth Master Swan’s eyes were sharp.

‘He took a liking to such a potential stock at a glance.

‘No, no, no.

‘Jeanne is a high-risk stock.’

The entire courtroom was noisy.

Eden’s expression was extremely ugly.

Melody, who was sitting in the corner, was so angry that her face was twisted.

Joshua could not help but ask, “53 billion dollars? How much is that?”

Eden glared at Joshua.

Joshua shut up and did not dare to speak.

In the courtroom,?the judge said solemnly, “Silence.”

Only then did the scene slowly quieten down.

Judah said, “Lawyer Newton, do you have any doubts regarding the fact that my client didn’t participate in the dual contract for personal gain?”

Josiah was somewhat embarrassed by Judah’s question.

It was clear that as long as any one of Jeanne’s accounts was shown during the case, it would be able to explain a lot of the facts. There was no need for such a long process.

At this moment, Josiah felt like he had been played.

He said coldly, “Not at the moment.”

“Okay.” Judah deliberately appeared to be modest. “Thank you for your approval.”

Josiah’s face was cold, and he did not answer.

Judah turned to the judge again. “Your Honor, this is the end of the plea for my client’s acquittal. Please pass judgment on my client’s case.”

“Please return to your seat, counsel for the plaintiff.”

“Understood.”

Judah returned to his seat.

The judge said seriously, “The court will adjourn for half an hour. I and the other judges will make a final discussion and pass judgment on this case.”

With that said, the judge led the people on the trial bench and left.

The moment the judge left, the scene started to become noisy.

Everyone was discussing the matter of Jeanne’s personal assets of 53 billion dollars.

This was simply breaking news. Everyone was more curious about this than the case itself.

Eden’s face was extremely dark.

Joshua and Jasmine did not dare to breathe loudly beside him.

At that moment, Jasmine also wished that she could kill Jeanne.

She had never imagined that Jeanne would have so many assets!

How could she have so many assets!

How could she have so much money?!

The amount was more than the total assets of the Lawrence Enterprise.

Jasmine gritted her teeth.

Jealousy made her even more twisted.

At this moment, Melody was also twisted like her.

Melody looked ferocious. Although she was wearing sunglasses, it was obvious.

Micheal, on the other hand, appeared much calmer.

He had expected that Jeanne would not be caught in the act so easily. Moreover, with Fourth Master Swan’s help, Jeanne would not be finished just like that. Although he was also hoping for a fluke and hoped that Jeanne could be taken down like this. After all, Jeanne was not simple. As long as she was not one of them, she was a threat.

However, at this moment, Micheal was still a little shocked.

Who exactly was Jeanne?!

Why did she suddenly become so powerful and appear so uncontrollably?

What was her motive for appearing?!

Micheal pondered silently.

At that moment, he saw Monica sitting on the other side, seemingly agitated.

She was so agitated that she seemed to be talking to someone beside her.

It was not Finn, but Fourth Master Swan.

Micheal’s eyes narrowed.

The relationship between Monica and Jeanne…

He did not seem to change his expression.

At that moment, Monica was indeed very agitated. She was teasing Fourth Master Swan. She said, “Fourth Master, I suddenly feel that it’s not that Jeannie isn’t good enough for you, but that you’re not good enough for her.”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

From the beginning to the end, his gaze was on Jeanne. At this moment, he withdrew his gaze because of Monica’s words.

Edward replied faintly, “So I’m improving myself.”

He had said it long ago.

What should he do to be good enough for Jeanne?

It seemed that he had to work even harder.

Monica laughed exaggeratedly. She said, “Fourth Master, you’re still the better one. Look at your nephew, he’s so angry that his face is red!”

Of course, Edward was not as gossipy as Monica.

Monica said, “I think Eden, that b*stard, must be regretting his decision. Fourth Master, you can’t let Eden take Jeannie away!”

Edward’s eyes narrowed. “He doesn’t have the ability to do that.”

“I think so too.” Monica echoed.

She was so excited.

At this moment, the judge and the trial bench returned to the courtroom.

Everyone instantly fell silent.

The judge sat down.

Everyone looked very serious.

“Regarding the case of Jeanne’s dual contract for personal gain, Harken’s Supreme Court in South Hampton City will now officially announce the verdict.” The judge was incomparably solemn. He uttered firmly, “All rise!”

Everyone at the scene stood up.

They were waiting for the final verdict!
