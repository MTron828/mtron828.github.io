No wonder they were so angry.

Ever since Lawrence Enterprise’s online project started, the results had been remarkable.

Currently, online transactions were much more than offline transactions, and online transactions were Lawrence Enterprise’s direct operations. Retail store agents had no benefits to speak of, so they were starting to make trouble.

According to common sense, even if those people wanted to make trouble, they should have come to her first rather than making it known to the entire city. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It was to garner public attention, and someone was behind it.

Jeanne’s expression did not change. Anyway, she would be able to know who was secretly causing all that trouble.

However, this was good too.

She was still trying to figure out how to get Eden out of Lawrence Enterprise, and if there was no solution to the issue, some people would take the initiative to send themselves to their graves.

She said, “So you guys are Lawrence Enterprise’s business partner. I’m sorry. I just returned to Lawrence Enterprise, so I might not be familiar with everyone. That was why I didn’t recognize you.”

“Cut the crap!” Rick did not appreciate it at all, “Lawrence Enterprise is doing so well now. In terms of the sales of electrical appliances in the country, you guys are almost catching up to the first place. According to the current trend, I think you will be able to catch up with the previous foreign brands and return to the top position in the electrical appliance market! You guys are in such a hurry, but have you thought about the life and death of us brick-and-mortar shop owners? Our business has been slow, to begin with. Now that you’ve established an e-commerce platform, you want us, agents, who have been with Lawrence Enterprise for so many years to declare bankruptcy?”

Jeanne really did not consider the profits of the brick-and-mortar agents.

After all, when she returned to the Lawrence Enterprise, the real economy was already very weak. In fact, many of the agents had already begun to transition because they knew that if Lawrence Enterprise continued on that way, they would be doomed. Hence, some of the larger agents acted as agents for many other electrical appliance brands at the same time. Moreover, due to the fact that Lawrence Enterprise’s sales were declining year by year, the original exclusive agreement with the agents had also become a decoration. The senior management was afraid to anger those large agents, and once those agents give up on carrying Lawrence Electrical’s products, Lawrence Enterprise’s market share would drop lower and lower. Therefore, they let the issue slide for fear of offending the agents.

However, Jeanne could also understand that as a businessman, the agents would definitely look at the profits.

Lawrence Enterprise may have developed anew, but being in the real economy, the agents did not receive any benefits. Since it upset the balance of the situation, issues would arise once anyone advocated for it.

Although Jeanne did not expect those people to come and cause trouble, she was not surprised they did.

She said calmly, “The Lawrence Enterprise’s e-commerce project reform follows the trend of the times. I believe everyone knows very well that if Lawrence Enterprise continues to use the traditional sales model, we will die without a doubt. However, the transformation of the company has indeed neglected our various partners. Even if we, Lawrence Enterprise and you agents, are only in a partnership. We do not have labor relations. However, as one of the enterprises in Harken, Lawrence Enterprise will fulfill its corporate social responsibility. They will assess everyone’s losses and, at the same time, find a better way to cooperate offline.”

Her words successfully clarified the relationship between the Lawrence Enterprise and its agents. It was just a business collaboration and there was no so-called labor responsibility. Therefore, the Lawrence Enterprise could have ignored those people. Even so, the Lawrence Enterprise still chose to take responsibility to create a positive social image of the Lawrence Enterprise.

To put it more bluntly, all the people who came to cause trouble today were being unreasonable.

Lawrence Enterprise was taking a humanistic point of view and was willing to step forward to solve their problem.

The media naturally understood the underlying meaning in a second, and so did the agents.

However, Rick was unconvinced. He shouted at Jeanne, “What do you mean? Do you mean Lawrence Enterprise has nothing to do with this? You don’t need to be responsible for us?”

“Legally, we don’t have to,” Jeanne said bluntly, her tone threatening.

Rick was angry but could not find the words to refute her.

Jeanne said, “However, I just said that Lawrence Enterprise will fulfill their social responsibility and find a better way for us to work together to solve your current problems. I hope you’ll give us some time, and I believe that we will give you a perfect answer soon.”

“You’re clearly brushing us off!” Rick did not accept Jeanne’s proposal at all.

“You were the ones who suddenly appeared and accused our company of wrongdoing without giving me any time. Do you think that I should have thought of a solution in advance?” Jeanne asked in return.

Rick was stunned.

“Mr. Gordon, by using such an extreme method to achieve your goals, what kind of answer do you want me to give you now?” Jeanne’s sarcasm could not be more obvious.

The media understood what she meant as well.

One of the reporters could not help but ask out loud, “President Lawrence, do you mean that instead of going to you in private, these people directly came to the company to make a fuss?”

“Yes.” Jeanne replied, “That’s why I can’t give them a clear answer.”

The reporter hurriedly asked Rick beside him, “Why didn’t you choose to communicate with President Lawrence first and instead chose this method to make a fuss?”

“Because… Because...” Rick was a little speechless.

Hence, Greg quickly said, “We were also forced into a corner. We always thought that Lawrence Enterprise treated us, partners, well. Hence, when we saw our sales getting worse while Lawrence Enterprise was growing bigger, and they didn’t seem to want to solve our problems after a long time, we had no choice but to use such an extreme method.”

Jeanne naturally did not believe them.

However, in order to calm things down at that moment, she said, “I understand, but I also hope you can understand my situation. Please give me some time to deal with your matters. As I said, I will give you a satisfactory reply.”

Since Jeanne had said that, Rick had nothing more to say.

Rick was the leader, and if he had nothing to say, Greg did not say anything more either.

“In that case, may I’ll ask everyone to return first? Once we have settled the matter, I’ll inform everyone.”

“A week’s time.” Rick said, “We can’t exceed a week’s time. We can’t continue to suffer losses like this.”

“Alright.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

Finally, the matter was temporarily resolved, and the troublemakers left. The hall at Lawrence Enterprise returned to normal.

On the high-rise building, Eden watched the scene downstairs and sneered.

Jeanne’s ability to settle the matter was really beyond his imagination.

She chased those people away so quickly, but, of course, the matter was not over.

This time, he would definitely kick Jeanne out of Lawrence Enterprise!
