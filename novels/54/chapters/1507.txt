Chapter 1508: Chloe’s End: True Colors Revealed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Candice, you’re just jealous of me! You’ve been jealous of me since we were young!” Chloe refused to let the matter go.

She refused to admit that men were not attracted to her.

“Why would I be jealous of you? Am I jealous that I’m not good-looking or that my figure isn’t good enough? Am I jealous of your lack of culture, morals, and self-awareness? Am I jealous of you because you can seduce men or that you failed to seduce a man?” Candice said calmly.

Chloe was completely exposed, but she did not believe that she was as embarrassing and useless as Candice described. What right did Candice have to say that about her?

“Who do you think you are? Do you think you have what it takes?” Chloe roared.

She was no longer putting on an act, and all her emotions erupted.

“I’ve never thought of myself as superior, nor do I think I’m superior, but I know my limits. I know who I can’t mess with and who I can’t get. Unlike you, who thinks too highly of yourself.”

“Candice!” Chloe was so angry that she wanted to fight Candice to the death.

No one had ever said that to her in her life. She had been the one to bully Candice since she was young, and Candice had never bullied her, so she could not accept Candice treating her like that. She would never admit what Candice had said either — she was certain that Candice was jealous of her.

She pointed her finger at Candice’s face. “Let me tell you, Candice, if I can’t seduce a man, you can’t either! If Edward doesn’t like me, he definitely won’t like you. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have given you birth control pills! Candice, so what if you’re the Leader’s wife? It’s just for show. Don’t be smug and act like you’re superior here. One day, you’ll end up the same-”

Just as Candice was about to speak, a familiar male voice suddenly sounded from the door. “Do you have the final say in who I like?”

The cold voice sounded angry.

Candice turned her head, and so did everyone else. They looked in the direction of the door and saw that Edward had suddenly appeared.

Candice bit her lip lightly. She and Chloe had been brazenly arguing just now, and their voices were so loud that she did not know how much he had heard.

“Do you think you have the final say in my matters?” Edward stood in front of Chloe and questioned her.

At that moment, Chloe was so frightened by Edward’s aura that she could not say a word for a long time. The others naturally felt the same, and the atmosphere in the room was tense.

Claire suddenly said with tears in her eyes, “Edward, Chloe is young and insensible. If she has done anything to offend you, please forgive her and don’t hold it against her, alright? She’s actually a kind-hearted person. She’s just a little willful because she’s been spoiled by us. On account that we’re family, can you let it go?”

Edward turned to look at Claire. He did not care about what she said.

His cold voice rang out loud and clear in the enclosed space again. “Would a kind-hearted person be so cruel to her own sister?”

“Chloe and Candice were just quarreling, like how two sisters would. It’s not what you think. They’ve been like this since they were young. They’ll be fine after a quarrel. Otherwise, it’d affect their relationship.” Claire quickly put in a good word for Chloe.

“What I’m talking about is that nine years ago, when Chloe tricked Candice into drinking a drug that made Candice unconscious, causing Candice to have an accident during the drill.” Edward enunciated each word. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Chloe’s face turned pale in panic, and she looked at Edward in disbelief.

How did he know? At that time, Edward was not even in politics. They were in different worlds, so how could Edward know?

“Impossible.” Claire insisted, “Chloe would never do such a thing.”

At that moment, she was still a little agitated because of what Edward had said.

Candice was surprisingly calm. It was as if she was not the victim of this incident and had nothing to do with it.

However, if that was the truth, it could explain why she suddenly had an accident during the drill. Apparently, her skills were perfect, and there was no way she could have made such a careless mistake..
