Chapter 249: Seek Help From Fourth Master Swan

Monica told herself that she absolutely could not give up.

Once she gave up, Jeanne might really... have no chance of survival.

She bit her lip hard, trying to calm herself down.

Monica could not panic.

She could not be flustered and lose her mind just because of a little thing.

At this time, she held back her tears and came up with an idea out of desperation.

She suddenly called Eden.

The phone rang.

After a long while, the call was finally connected. “Monica, it’s so late—”

“I’m at your front gate. Tell your guards to let me in!” Monica was yelling!

“What are you doing at my house in the middle of the night?” Eden’s tone was not very good. “Are you mad?”

In reality, Eden’s heart could not help but beat faster.

‘Could it be that Monica has discovered something?!

‘That’s impossible.

‘Monica is clearly just a heartless and super playful young lady. She couldn’t possibly have Jeanne’s wisdom and shrewdness, so it’s impossible for her to have noticed anything!’

Monica was about to yell at Eden again.

Micheal took Monica’s phone and said, “Eden, this is Micheal. Ask the guards to open the gate. We have something important to do!”

“Micheal.” Eden’s eyes narrowed.

‘Micheal is with Monica!

‘Could it be that Micheal told Monica…?’

“We’re here to look for Fourth Master Swan. Please help us out. Your guards aren’t letting us go in. They said it’s too late and the Swans have an entrance restriction for outsiders!” Micheal explained.

It was a simple explanation, but he was sending a message to Eden.

He was sending a message to tell Eden that Monica did not know anything and that they were only here to look for help.

Eden immediately understood.

He said, “I’ll go out to pick you guys up.”

Micheal nodded. “Thank you.”

He hung up the phone.

Micheal returned the phone to Monica.

When he saw Monica’s anxious face, he remained silent.

Around five to six minutes later, Eden appeared at the gate and asked the guards to open the gate.

After opening it, Eden walked out directly.

Monica wanted to rush in but was stopped by Eden.

He said, “My fourth uncle isn’t free tonight. You can look for him tomorrow.”

Monica pushed Eden away directly. “Tomorrow will be too late. Get out of my way!”

Eden was forced to take a few steps back by Monica’s brute force.

His eyes narrowed.

The moment he met Micheal’s gaze, he endured it and did not stop Monica.

Monica ran into the Swans’ manor in a frenzy.

She was not even wearing her shoes.

Her 12-centimeter high heels had disappeared without a trace the moment she jumped out of the car.

Micheal glanced at Monica and gave Eden a look.

Eden followed Micheal into the car.

Micheal sat in the driver’s seat and deliberately used some time to light the fire.

It was just so he could speak to Eden alone. “Jeanne is now being kidnapped by Melody. No matter what happens to Jeanne in the end, whether she’ll be killed by Melody or not, it’s best that you don’t appear. Even if Melody asks you to do so, don’t go. Not to mention the others, if your fourth uncle knows that you’re involved, you wouldn’t be able to live!”

Eden was shocked. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He could completely imagine that if his fourth uncle found out, given his fourth uncle’s personality, he might really be killed.

“If you want to take revenge on someone, the best way is to use someone else to kill them,” Micheal said coldly and cruelly.

Eden pursed his lips and nodded slightly.

Originally, Melody had said that once Jeanne was seized by her, she would send someone to pick Eden up and torture Jeanne crazily.

At this moment, Eden suddenly felt that Micheal’s reminder was very right.

He could not completely lose his mind and do something that might cause him to die just for the sake of showing off for a moment.

As for torturing Jeanne…

Death would be the greatest torture to her!

‘That self-righteous woman would finally not hinder my sight. She won’t get to show off in front of me anymore!’

Eden was also certain that given Melody’s personality, before Jeanne died, she would definitely experience a life worse than death.

Though Eden felt a little regretful that he would not be able to witness it.

As long as he knew that would not have an easy time, it was enough!

Therefore, Eden did not need to be there in person.

He nodded and said affirmatively, “Alright, I got it.”

Micheal nodded.

He said, “Monica wants Fourth Master Swan to save Jeanne now. I have no choice but to come with her. I can’t let Monica know that I don’t want to save Jeanne. It’ll destroy our relationship...”

“Don’t worry, my fourth uncle can’t save Jeanne tonight.” Eden sneered.

Micheal looked at Eden.

Fourth Master Swan did not pick up the phone, nor did Nox. Micheal had found this a little strange.

“I won’t hide it from you. It was indeed me and Melody who planned to kill Jeanne tonight. “The reason I chose tonight was that I went to talk to my grandpa about work that day and accidentally heard him say that he wants to punish my fourth uncle! I don’t know what my fourth uncle did to offend my grandpa, but once my grandpa decides to punish my fourth uncle, he won’t be able to leave home. So I asked around and found out that my fourth uncle would be taught a lesson by my grandpa tonight, so Melody and I chose to make a move against Jeanne today.”

“Mm.” Micheal nodded. “Let’s first accompany Monica to finish her act.”

“Okay.” Eden instantly understood.

Micheal drove at a somewhat fast speed.

Monica ran barefoot in the Swans’ manor.

At this moment, she was so nervous that she had forgotten that the Swans’ manor was very big. There was only one thought in her mind—she had to find Fourth Master Swan.

She had to find Fourth Master Swan to save Jeanne.

Micheal stepped on the accelerator and stopped beside Monica. “Monica, get in the car.”

Monica was stunned.

She hurriedly opened the car door and got in.

Micheal drove very quickly to the Bamboo Garden.

It was quiet there.

As soon as the car stopped, Monica opened the car door and rushed in.

The huge building was empty. There was no one inside.

Monica rushed to the second floor and went to Fourth Master Swan’s room.

She pushed the door open and found that it was empty.

It was impossible.

It was impossible that Fourth Master Swan was gone.

He even attended the banquet tonight.

Although he left early, Monica did not believe that he had left South Hampton City.

She could not accept it.

Monica was on the verge of collapse.

This was because her last straw seemed to have disappeared in an instant.

She stood at the door of Fourth Master Swan’s bedroom. It was as if she had lost her breath. She stood there without moving.

“Monica,” Micheal called out to her from behind.

At this moment, Teddy heard the noise and came out of his room.

When he came out, he saw Monica standing at the door of his master’s bedroom. He was shocked.

When Monica heard the noise, she suddenly seemed to have come to life.

She looked straight at Teddy and quickly walked over.

Teddy was so scared by Monica’s appearance that he involuntarily took two steps back.

‘She isn’t sleepwalking, is he?’

“Teddy, where’s Fourth Master Swan? Where did he go?!” Monica grabbed Teddy’s arms with both hands and asked him fiercely.

Teddy was stunned for two seconds.

Monica had come here to look for Fourth Master last time.

However, she was clearly not as flustered as she was this time.

At this moment, it was as if something big had happened and that she needed Fourth Master Swan’s help.

Teddy was frightened by Monica’s appearance. He said nervously, “Fourth Master was summoned by the old master tonight and didn’t come back. We were told that nobody is allowed to disturb them—”

Before he could finish, he saw Monica run away as if she had gone mad.

Upon closer inspection, he found that her gown was in tatters and that there were many serious scratches on her body.

It looked like a big accident had happened!
