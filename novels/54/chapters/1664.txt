Chapter 1665: Utterly Despicable

Due to the economy right now, he could only buy a bouquet of flowers as a

parting gift. However, in the future, he would give Shelly a better life.

With that thought in mind, Benjamin walked into Shelly’s neighborhood with the flowers he had personally picked. The moment he walked in, he felt that there was something strange about the neighborhood. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As he went deeper, he heard a familiar man’s voice shouting through a

loudspeaker in the neighborhood. “Shelly, I like you! Do you hear me?”

Benjamin’s expression changed slightly, and he strode over to see Nox standing in the courtyard of the neighborhood, shouting in the direction of Shelly’s house. At that moment, there were many onlookers, and people were also filming Nox.

However, Nox did not seem to care. He just shouted through the loudspeaker, “Shelly, I know I’ve hurt you a lot in the past, but I regret it now. I regret how I treated you and want to be with you again. Please, can you give me a chance?”

Almost all the windows were open, except for Shelly’s, which was tightly shut.

At home, Shelly did not know what was going on with Nox! She thought she had made herself clear and that Nox would never come looking for him again after the last time, yet what was he up to now? She really wanted to kill Nox.

“Shelly!” Downstairs, the loud noise from the loudspeaker sounded again.

Shelly covered her ears, but Bella, on the other hand, was rather curious. She looked out the window and said, “Mommy, is someone calling you?”

Shelly did not want to hear it.

“Mommy, someone is calling for you outside.”

“Don’t worry about him. He’s a lunatic,” Shelly said bluntly.

Bella looked at Shelly in a daze, clearly frightened.

Speechless at Nox’s behavior, Shelly gritted her teeth and suddenly took out her phone to call the police. “Hello, is this the police? I’m being harassed by someone. Please come over and deal with it.”

“What’s the exact situation?” The other party was serious.

Shelly described the situation. “We’ll be there in ten minutes.”

“Thank you. ”

With that, Shelly hung up. She was not to be blamed for treating Nox like that. Since he was so shameless, why should she care?

Ten minutes later, Nox shouted from below, “Damn it, Shelly, I can’t believe you called the police to arrest me? I’m deeply in love with you, and you called the police on me? Hey, stop dragging me away. I’m confessing my love. F*ck..”

Gradually, the sound disappeared, and only then did Shelly let out a sigh of relief.

At the same time, the door suddenly swung open. Shelly was shocked, but she then saw Benjamin at the door with a bouquet of flowers.

“It’s you.” Shelly tried to recover from her shock.

She was really afraid of Nox. However, Nox did not have her keys.

“I just saw Nox being dragged away by the police,” Benjamin said with a smile.

“Yes, I called the police.”

“Why did he suddenly come looking for you again?

“Who knows what’s wrong with him? Maybe something is wrong with his brain.” Shelly was furious.

Although Benjamin was smiling, deep down, he still felt a little disgusted.

“Did you buy me flowers?” Shelly did not want to talk about Nox anymore, so she changed the topic.

“Yeah, do you like it?” As he spoke, Benjamin handed the bouquet to Shelly.

Before Shelly could take it, someone suddenly knocked on the door.

“Ms. Carter, we’re the property managers,” the person outside quickly said.

Shelly opened the door, thinking that the managers were there to apologize. After all, Nox had seriously affected her life. However, she did not expect to see the manager holding a large bouquet of flowers when she opened the door.

Benjamin’s bouquet had nine roses, but the bouquet in the manager’s hand had at least 999 roses.

“Mr. Winter has told us to pass this to you.”

“I don’t want it. Take it away!” Shelly’s expression changed.

She could not understand what Nox was up to this time!

“Mr. Winter has not only gifted you flowers but a lot of things as well.” As the manager spoke, he moved aside slightly.

That was when she saw a neat row of people in uniforms outside the door. At a glance, she could tell they were the employees of various luxury goods. At that moment, everyone was carrying a few bags in their hands, and they looked extremely respectful.

“Hello, Ms. Carter,” everyone greeted Shelly in unison.

Shelly pursed her lips tightly. However, before she could reject him, the manager sent the flowers to Shelly’s home. All the shop assistants also proceeded to follow the manager and place the goods inside Shelly’s home.

Shelly’s home was not big, to begin with, so the gifts took up more than half of her living room. Seeing that, Shelly tried to hold her emotions in.

After putting the goods away, everyone left respectfully. The property manager even politely closed the door for her.

Shelly looked at the goods, and so did Benjamin. With so many luxury items, Benjamin felt that his flowers were… out of place.

Shelly pursed her lips and gave Nox a call.

“Do you like it?” Nox, on the other end of the phone, seemed very happy.

“What exactly do you want?” Shelly gritted her teeth.

He had disappeared for a month, and just when she thought her days were peaceful again, he was going crazy again!

“I want to woo you over!”

“Nox, that’s enough!” Shelly could not conceal her anger. “How clear do you want me to make myself?”

“You don’t have to explain yourself. I know you dislike me, but just because you dislike me doesn’t mean I can’t like you! And the more you dislike me, the more I like you!”

“Are you a pervert?” Shelly was so angry that her lungs were about to explode!

How shameless could he be?
