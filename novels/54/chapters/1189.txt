1190 Nox’s Mental Breakdown and Finn’s Counseling

“I’ll leave Nox to you.”

“Don’t worry.”

Finn hung up the phone and looked at Nox, who was lying on the hospital bed and looked like he had nothing to live for after knowing that her legs were crippled. Then, Finn walked over, took the needle and IV drip from the nurse, and walked to Nox’s side. He said, “Be good. The IV drip is ready.”

Nox pretended not to hear him or anything at all and did not allow anyone to approach him.

Without waiting for Nox to agree, Finn walked over and picked up the back of Nox’s hand.

Nox pushed him away, but Finn forcefully pressed his hand down.

“Finn, don’t touch me!” Nox roared.

It had been three days since the surgery. However, Finn was still as uncooperative with treatment as ever.

“Just let me die!” Nox said fiercely.

“I spent the entire night saving you, and this is how you treat me?!” Finn looked at him.

“Who told you to save me?”

“Weren’t you quite mighty when you were playing the hero? And now, you regret it?”

“I don’t regret it!” Nox’s eyes were red. “I just don’t want to live anymore! I’d rather f*cking die than be like this. I don’t want to be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. I f*cking–”

“You’re f*cking amazing!” Finn suddenly got angry as well.

Finn, who had never lost his temper, suddenly flew into a rage.

The nurse beside him was shocked by his sudden rage.

“Do you know how much I admired you when I found out that you risked your life to save Jeanne?” Finn’s veins were popping. “I always thought that you’d be the one among the three of us who needed to be protected because you’re impulsive and don’t consider the consequences. You’ve always needed us to clean up after you! But in reality, you’re always the one who saves everyone at critical moments! If not for you, Jeanne would’ve died. Then, do you think Edward would still be alive? Not only would he not want to live, but he would also take revenge on the entire world. He might even screw Alex over. If that happened, all of us would go down with him! Do you know that Jeanne wasn’t the only one you saved? You saved all of us!”

Nox was somewhat stunned by Finn’s words.

“Yes, you’ve lost both your legs, and you won’t be able to stand up in the future! But so what? In my heart, Edward’s heart, Jeanne’s heart, and everyone’s heart, you’re a real man, who can risk your life for your friends and your responsibilities! In this world, I don’t think I can find another person who’s greater than you!” Finn said emotionally.

His sudden outburst of emotions shocked Nox.

Nox had never seen Finn so angry in his life. He had seen Edward’s outburst before, but he had never seen Finn like that.

He had always thought that Finn did not have a temper, but now, Finn was mad at him.

F*ck! Did Finn not know that he was suffering from a major drawback? Why was Finn shouting at him?

For some reason, Nox’s eyes reddened.

He really felt terrible. When he found out that he could not move his legs, he really wanted to die.

He was the dignified young master of the Winters. If he were to be confined to a wheelchair in the future, how could he go out in the future? How could he have the cheek to claim superior among his friends?

The more he thought about it, the more upset he was…

Nox gritted his teeth and tried hard not to cry. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“If you want to cry, cry.” Finn suddenly calmed down.

He could not bear to see Nox like that.

In fact, anyone who encountered Nox’s situation would wish they could die. He just… did not want Nox to give up on himself.

In his heart, Nox should be the man who was fearless and would always press forward. The word ‘defeat’ or ‘knocked down’ should not exist in his world.

However, since Nox was knocked down for the time being, he had to get Nox to accept reality.

“Who said I wanted to cry? Do I look like a f*cking person who cries for no reason?” Nox roared.

However, after being scolded by Finn, he returned to his usual self.

“Are you sure you won’t cry?” Finn looked at him.

“Do you think I’m a child?!”

Finn could not help but smile.

As Nox was younger than them, he often cried when they were younger. Hence, they would occasionally mock Nox. After that, Nox never cried even if he was beaten to death.

Finn sighed and suddenly said in a heavy tone, “Nox, you’re no longer that little brat who followed behind us.”

Nox looked straight at Finn.

Was Finn acknowledging something about him?

“Give me your hand,” Finn suddenly ordered.

Nox obediently stretched out his hand. The next second, he roared, “F*ck, did I say you could give me an injection?”

Finn, that old fox, was always scheming against him.

“Cooperate with the treatment. I don’t think you’ll be in a wheelchair for the rest of your life.” Finn made sure to enunciate his words.

Nox looked at Finn in surprise.

Did the doctor not say that he would never be able to stand up again?

The doctor said something about osteonecrosis and that he would never be able to stand again in the future.

“Anyone can fall and not get up, including Fourth Master, but not you.” Finn looked at Nox with determination in his eyes.

Nox was suddenly touched by Finn’s gaze. It was a feeling of being acknowledged by a friend who believed in him.

Nox turned his face away to avoid Finn’s gaze.

He felt that the guy was lying to him.

However, he had to believe it and remain calm.

...

“Believe in yourself.” Finn said in a gentle voice, “I will do my best to help you recover.”
