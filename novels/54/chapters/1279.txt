1280 Edward Attends a Charity Banquet

Candice Nicholson’s sudden appearance in the banquet hall instantly caused a stir among the people present.

Her cheat-death life was fleeting, making countless people feel sorry for her. After a few years, she could appear in front of everyone again. It was more or less unexpected.

As such, it naturally attracted everyone’s attention.

At that moment, even Monica felt that the pastries were a little boring. She really wanted to go and take a look.

The countless highlights of Candice’s in the media included her appearance.

Some media outlets said that Candice had a beauty different from traditional beauty. Her beauty also carried a heroic spirit. She exuded determination right to her bones and was valiant and heroic.

So this woman was… a tomboy.

However, when she looked at her from afar and saw her walking through the crowd in a light golden evening gown, she felt that her steps and bearing were elegant.

‘Never mind.’

Monica stopped speculating.

She put down the pastry and decided to take a look.

For some reason, she felt that the person in the distance had a magical power that made her want to see what was going on.

She looked down at George. “Let’s go. I’ll show you what’s fun.”

“I’m not going,” George refused directly.

“Why not?” Monica was surprised.

“I don’t like it.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You don’t like socializing, or you don’t like anyone?” Monica smiled.

Sometimes, George was very mature. He could think from an adult’s point of view, which shocked people.

Other times, he was still childish and even a child would have a temper.

“I don’t like that woman.” George pointed at Candice.

What did Candice do to make George dislike her!

Monica was baffled.

George turned around and left.

Monica was even more shocked.

Could George be related to Candice?!

But no matter how he looked at it, the two of them were not related at all!

Monica decided not to think about it anymore.

She tidied up her appearance and walked into the crowd of the banquet.

Everyone’s eyes were still on Candice. She was surrounded by many people. Monica could not see her face at all and she was already extending her neck for a better view.

“Are you that curious about that woman?” Nox suddenly appeared beside Monica.

Monica was shocked.

She came back to her senses. “Don’t you know that people are like this? The more mysterious someone is, the more they can’t help but want to find out. I just feel that Candice has been alive and even got up after so many years. It’s rather inspirational, so I want to get to know her. Besides, don’t you think that this woman gives off a sense of familiarity?”

The main point was…

Familiarity.

With just a glance, Monica felt her heart beating wildly.

The familiarity that followed made her unable to remain calm.

Logically speaking, she had never interacted with Candice at all, so it was impossible for her to have a familiar feeling.

“I don’t think so.” Nox threw cold water on Monica. “I, Young Master Winter, have been in the business for so many years and have seen many women. I’m sure I’ve never seen or interacted with a woman like Candice Nicholson.”

“Why? Judging from your tone, you’ve fallen in love with someone else so quickly?!” Monica raised her eyebrows.

“Pure admiration, you know?!” Nox was a little excited.

Monica smiled. “You really like Zoe, don’t you?”

Otherwise, why would he be in such a hurry to clear his name?

Nox rolled his eyes. “Of course.”

“Shelly can’t be any lesser in significance to you,” Monica said indifferently, looking a little sarcastic.

When Nox heard Shelly’s name, his expression changed slightly. “Do you have nothing better to do every day? Why don’t you just think about your relationship with Dr. Jones? Don’t you think the two of you get along very strangely? I’ve never seen a couple who doesn’t need each other that much.”

“Am I not showing it to you now?” Monica smiled calmly.

“Monica, tell me honestly, are you deceiving Dr. Jones’s feelings again?!” Nox looked serious.

Monica frowned.

“You don’t like Dr. Jones at all, right?” Nox was aggressive.

Monica was silent for a few seconds.

Speaking of liking him…

She did not know how much she liked him.

There did not seem to be any special kind of joy when they were together, nor was there any special longing when they were apart.

To say that she did not like him…
