1367 The Wedding Night: From Now On, I Will Sleep In

It was as if she killed his happiness.

She bit her lip lightly. She wanted to explain, but she could not seem to say it.

It was just their first night as a married couple, and she did not know what she was doing. She was prepared to sleep with him, but at that moment, she wanted to escape.

The temperature in the room was slowly cooling down, and no one spoke.

Candice could barely hold on in the tense atmosphere. Just as she was about to speak, she heard Edward say, “I won’t force you.”

Stunned, Candice turned to look at Edward.

Seeing that Edward had finally regained his composure and gained control of his emotions, he said calmly, “We still have a long way to go.”

He also said it jokingly to give her a way out. It was to ease her embarrassment and the guilt in her heart.

Candice bit her lip and chose to remain silent.

Edward said, “You can sleep in this room, and I’ll sleep in the next.”

When Candice looked at him again, the disappointment in his eyes was gone, and there was no sign of anger on his face. He was not angry because of her rejection.

He said, “Goodnight.

After that, he got up, and just as he was about to leave, someone tugged on his clothes.

Edward was slightly startled and he stared straight at Candice. It was as if he was trying to confirm what she meant and whether it was what he understood.

Was it…

Candice said, “Don’t go.”

Edward could feel that his heart was beating uncontrollably.

“I can do it,” Candice said, with her entire face and neck flushed red.

Was she really that shy?

At that moment, Edward was shocked, and his tightly clenched fists were turning white at the knuckles.

“Since we’re married, we’re husband and wife. On the night of the wedding, we should go to bed as husband and wife.” Candice lowered her eyes and said quietly.

She really did not dare to look at Edward’s face. If she did, she would find out that Edward’s current appearance was even more unsettled than hers.

After she finished speaking, she did not receive a reply from Edward for a long time.

It had been a long time since he received a reply from Edward, who had not left but did not approach her either.

The moment she thought that she was overthinking things, she heard Edward say, “Will you regret it?”

Regret? Why would she regret it?

Since she had decided to marry him, she would really marry him. She had never thought of running away halfway.

Before she could answer, she felt Edward’s broad body hugging her tightly in his embrace.

His body suddenly tensed up.

It was clearly a little painful, but more than that, she felt the sense of security he gave her. It was very assuring.

“Even if you regret it, you can’t go back on your word,” Edward said.

Candice’s heart was racing.

“Because this is my limit.”

He could not control himself anymore and let go of her, pushing her onto the bed. Under the light, Edward’s deep eyes were filled with desire and affection.

That was when she started to feel a little frightened by his appearance. She even had a feeling that he would devour her whole.

Her body was under his body.

“Oh.”

His hot lips kissed hers. It was completely different from the feeling when they gently touched each other just now.

This time, he was so determined that there was no room for resistance.

That night, the moon shone brightly outside the window.

…

The next day, Candice opened her eyes tiredly.

She had finally seen the difference between men and women, which was huge. Not only was there a difference in their body structure but also… many things.

After one night, she was so tired that she did not even want to move her toes. Yet, he could go on all night.

Candice recalled the scene from last night, and her face turned red.

The relationship between a man and a woman that she thought of was completely different from the relationship between a man and a woman that she had actually experienced.

It was… completely different.

As she moved her body, it felt as if she had been crushed by thousands of mountains, and she did not have any strength left.

It made her wonder how long the man beside her had held it in for, considering how crazy he went on their first night.

At that moment, she could not even move. Even if her entire body was sore and she just wanted to lie there forever.
