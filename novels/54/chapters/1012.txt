1013 Identity Exposed: Jeanne Is the Sanders’ Third Princess!

However, he kept his feelings to himself and did not show them.

“There’s still a chance next time.” Edward patted George’s head. “I’ll keep my promise.”

George looked at Edward, who was comforting him with a smile, and suddenly reached out to hold Edward’s hand.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

George rarely took the initiative with him, but there was no denying that George no longer rejected him.

“I’ll be with you,” George said.

A trace of surprise flashed in Edward’s eyes.

“I’ll be with you from now on,” George said with certainty.

Edward chuckled. “Are you afraid that if your mother doesn’t want you anymore, I don’t want you either?”

George’s little face turned red.

He knew that Fourth Master Swan was not worthy of sympathy.

“Don’t worry, I won’t abandon you.” Edward ruffled George’s hair.

Then, he left as he did not want to show too much of his emotions.

George stood rooted to the ground, looking at Edward’s tall back.

His father actually... really missed his mother!

…

At South Hampton City Central Hospital, Gary was sent to the operating theatre.

Before he went in, Ruby kept holding Gary’s hand.

Monica also stayed by her father’s side the whole time and kept telling him, “Dad, mom and I will be waiting for you out here.”

“Dad, don’t be afraid. The surgery will be very successful.”

“Dad, we’ll be waiting for you out here.”

With that, Gary was pushed into the operating room. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Monica and Ruby’s eyes were red as they watched the door of the operating theatre close.

The two of them stared at the door for a long time and did not move until they heard a few more footsteps in the corridor.

Monica and Ruby turned their heads.

When they saw it was Finn with a foreign doctor, they quickly walked over.

Finn said, “Don’t worry. Just leave it to us.”

“I’m really counting on you, Finn.” Ruby’s vision was blurry.

“Alright.” Finn gave her a determined look.

For some reason, that made Monica and Ruby much calmer.

Finn did not stay for long as he had to bring the foreign specialist doctor into the operating theatre.

After the door of the operating theatre closed again, Monica helped Ruby to the chair beside her.

Then, there was a long wait. It was a very, very long wait.

The surgery was scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. in the morning. Now, two hours had passed, and there was still no news from inside.

In fact, they already knew before the surgery that a heart transplant surgery would take a long time. It usually took more than six hours.

Therefore, there was no hurry.

Monica took out her mobile phone and tried to distract herself through the internet.

The moment she opened the news app, she saw the headline. “Cardellini Pharmaceutical has disbanded internally. The research and development team has joined Sunny Pharmaceutical.”

Monica could not believe what she just saw.

She hurriedly clicked on the news and read it. “According to an insider, the Cardellini Enterprise’s internal management has long been in a mess because of this vaccine incident. Faced with the fact that new products can’t be launched and old products are being continuously returned, the Cardellini Enterprise is facing a very serious shortage of funds. Some employees have plans to jump ship, but the one that has the biggest impact on Cardellini Enterprise is the core department — the research and development team. It was said that Sunny Pharmaceutical took advantage of Cardellini Enterprise’s incident and spent a huge sum of money to poach the entire research and development team. From informed sources, the research and development team did not leave just because of the turmoil caused by the vaccine issue in Cardellini Enterprise. The main reason was the sudden change of leader in Cardellini Enterprise. According to sources, the former chairman of Cardellini Enterprise, Gary, is critically ill. Gary’s only daughter has announced internally that Gary will no longer be in charge of Cardellini Enterprise, and Monica will take over her father’s position.”

Monica suppressed her emotions and kept reading.

“Although Monica has displayed amazing ability in the confrontation with the quality inspection department, a single victory doesn’t mean that she is a qualified businessman. Not only within Cardellini Enterprise, but most of the public is not optimistic about Monica taking over her father’s position. Especially under the circumstances where the Cardellini Enterprise is greatly affected, it is impossible for Monica to bring Cardellini Pharmaceutical back to life. According to a series of analyses, most experts believe that it is highly possible for the research and development team of Cardellini Pharmaceutical to leave Cardellini Enterprise and join Sunny Pharmaceutical, which was currently in full swing. Of course, whether this is the case or not remains to be confirmed.”
