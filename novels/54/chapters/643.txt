Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Oh, right.” After the nurse cursed Monica for a long time, she suddenly said, “Someone posted Dr. Jones’s photo in the group today. Did you see it?”

“I did. He’s still so handsome.”

“I mean, did you see the hickey on his neck?”

“What?” The nurse was surprised.

“And you say he’s your Prince Charming? How could you be so careless with him? Take a look for yourself. Here.” The nurse took out her phone and showed the picture to another nurse.

After the photo was enlarged, the nurse screamed.

“It really is a hickey. So, does Dr. Jones has a new girlfriend?”

“Probably.” The nurse echoed, “I hope our Dr. Jones can find another girlfriend as soon as possible and never get together with that horrible woman, Monica, again!”

“That’s right.”

The elevator arrived, and the two nurses went out first.

Monica bit her lip.

That was her first time hearing someone badmouthing her, her first time not fighting with the other party directly, her first time choosing to remain silent with a guilty conscience, and her first time feeling so guilty that she even wanted to disappear immediately.

She watched as everyone exited the large elevator, leaving only Finn and Monica awkwardly with each other.

Monica should have gotten out of the elevator when she reached the first floor, but she was forced to go down to the underground car park.

When the elevator opened, Finn was the first to go out.

Monica did not know why, but she impulsively grabbed Finn’s arm.

Finn pushed her away, and it was a really strong push.

Caught off guard, Monica fell backward.

Fortunately, the elevator was behind her, so she did not fall to the ground and hurt herself.

However, her heart hurt so badly.

The way Finn acted just now, it was as if he had touched something dirty.

Despite that, she gritted her teeth, supported herself with her crutches, and followed Finn.

Finn seemed to be planning to leave the hospital, so he was heading toward his car.

Monica struggled to catch up with him.

She said, “Finn, I just want to say a few words.”

Finn pretended not to hear her.

“Finn.”

He still pretended not to hear her.

In fact, his footsteps were getting faster and faster.

Monica gritted her teeth and threw her walking stick on the ground before running toward Finn and stopping in front of him. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Finn looked at her coldly.

“Do you have to do this to me?” Monica asked him.

“Is that what you wanted to say to me?” Finn raised his eyebrows. Her expression was ice-cold.

“No,” Monica denied.

She did not think she needed an answer from Finn because she knew how Finn would answer her.

Instead, she asked, “Were you the one who sent me back last night?”

“What do you want to say?”

“Did I leave that hickey on your neck?” Monica looked at the mark that was no longer as obvious as before.

Finn’s expression darkened.

It turned out she had no idea what she did last night or who she had done it to.

He came to the hospital to report to work today but would officially start work tomorrow. However, he had forgotten about the mark on his neck when he went out Otherwise, he would have covered it.

Finn had yet to speak when Monica suddenly felt guilty. “I was too drunk last night, and I don’t know what I did last night–”

“It has nothing to do with you,” Finn interrupted Monica.

Monica stared at him with wide eyes.

“I said, it has nothing to do with you,” Finn repeated, word by word.

Monica simply looked at Finn without saying a word for a long time, and Finn did not have any patience for her.

Hence, he turned around and left.

“Finn, can you not be so cold to me?” Monica shouted at him.

Finn’s footsteps halted.

Monica said with tears in her eyes, “It scares me.”

‘It really scares me that you’ll leave me.’

However, Finn did not reply to her, but he did not leave either.

“I really didn’t think I would bring so much harm to you. When I chose to help Michael, all I could think about was what Michael had to go through because of me. I never thought you would suffer from it. Only after hearing what the nurses in your hospital said today do I realize all the harm and criticism I’ve brought you. I always thought that as long as I liked you, we would be able to get back together after I helped Michael. I...”
