Chapter 557: Sowing Discord Between The Lawrences

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The main point was that Jeanne looked too charming, so if Monica had no makeup, she would instantly turn into dust.

She, too, had her dignity to uphold.

After making herself look presentable, she left the room in good spirits.

In the meantime, Jeanne also returned to Bamboo Garden.

In the hall, George was playing dominoes on the floor at one of the corners after school. He was so immersed in it, and a lot of them were on the floor, looking a little complicated.

Jeanne went over to take a look, but she was careful. She was afraid that if she touched it, her son would kill her.

She squatted down. “Why are you suddenly playing this?”

“Otherwise, I wouldn’t have anything else to play.”

Jeanne felt a little hurt.

Ever since she returned to South Hampton, it seemed she had been spending less and less time with George.

She touched George’s head, feeling a little guilty.

However, George did not mind as he continued to place the dominoes carefully.

Jeanne went upstairs and decided she would take a shower first before changing into some comfortable clothes. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After all, she knew when Nox would be able to come, and a shower would not take long anyway.

She returned to the bedroom and took off the tight business attire on her body when suddenly, someone hugged her into his embrace.

Jeanne was speechless.

“Jeannie, when have you been so proactive?” Edward’s deep male voice rang in her ear, and it sounded a little lustful.

“Why are you back so early?”

“Because I miss you.” His magnetic voice was alluring.

‘Don’t mess around,’ Jeanne thought. Then, she tried to wriggle herself out of his body. “I’m going to take a shower.”

“I’ll go with you.”

“Edward, I have an appointment with Nox.” Jeanne was flustered and exasperated.

However, at that moment, Edward picked her up horizontally.

“I won’t do anything.”

Who would believe him?!

“Have I heard of the story about the boy who cried wolf?” Jeanne frowned.

“Do you like it?”

‘Like, my *ss! Edward, you stud!’

Downstairs in the living room, Nox sat on the sofa and waited for quite a while, which made him think how long Jeanne needed to take to change her clothes.

As he was a little bored, he walked toward George, who placed the dominoes down seriously and did not even bat an eyelid at Nox.

Nox squatted down and said, “I heard you’re Edward’s son.”

George’s hand that was holding the dominoes paused for a moment.

“Have I touched a nerve?” Nox deliberately asked

He deliberately attacked George because he felt the brat needed someone to teach him a lesson.

George gently placed the domino down and said, “Why are you so smug about me being Fourth Master Swan’s son?”

Nox was stunned.

Suddenly, he was rendered a little speechless by George’s words.

On second thought, why was he showing off?

He was just reminding himself again and again that he was still single. Even so, he could not lose his cool.

He said, “I’m not smug. I am just gloating. From what I heard, you really hate Edward. Who would have thought that Edward would be your father huh? Are you upset about it? Uncomfortable? Unhappy? If you tell me, I can enlighten you.”

George raised his head and looked at Nox.

Unhappiness was written all over his small face as he found the man childish.

However, he had to admit that every sentence hurt his heart. Although he had calmly accepted the fact that Fourth Master Swan was his biological father, the thought of it made him frustrated.

He really never thought that his biological father was still alive, much less that his biological father was Fourth Master Swan.

He clearly did not like the man, but now, the man had become his biological father — one that he could not choose.

George stared at Nox. “Actually, there’s nothing bad about it.”

“Compromising so quickly isn’t your style at all! You should be so angry that you hack Swan Enterprise’s internal network and make it fail to operate normally for a week. You could be a little more ruthless by posting Swan Enterprise’s trade secrets on the black market–”

“Are you and Fourth Master Swan fake friends?” George’s childish voice sounded very mature.

Nox was stunned at how the kid knew that slang!

“But even if there are two of you, you can’t beat Fourth Master Swan.”

“You brat!” Nox was furious.

George did not care that Nox was angry. He just lowered his head and laid out the dominoes seriously again.

At that moment, he did not forget to add insult to injury. “There’s nothing wrong with being Fourth Master Swan’s son! At the very least, I used to call you uncle, but now I don’t have to.”

That brat really hit the nail on the head. What George said was like a knife stabbing into his heart, and he could not even pull it out.

Nox was so exasperated.

Edward must have given birth to a little monster!

He stared at George, and when he saw the serious look on George’s face, an evil thought came to him. Suddenly, he reached his hand out.
