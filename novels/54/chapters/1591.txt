Benjamin saved it and said, “I’ll call you the next time there’s a class reunion.”

Shelly nodded. In fact, she might not go. Giving Benjamin her number was just… She did not know why she gave it to him. In any case, she had given it to him.

Benjamin saved her number. “Do you want me to send you back? I just finished my IV transfusion and am going back to school.”

“What’s wrong with you?” Shelly asked casually.

“I caught a cold. Isn’t it flu season right now?” Benjamin quickly put on his mask again, afraid of infecting others. “I was afraid of spreading it to my roommates, so I came to see the doctor to get it treated earlier.”

“Oh, okay.” Shelly nodded, seemingly not interested in what he was saying. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Let’s go. I’ll drive you.” Benjamin wanted to leave with Shelly.

“No need. My house is not far from here. I’ll take a taxi back myself.”

“You’re a woman with a child. It’s quite dangerous-”

“There’s no danger.” Shelly refused his offer. “There hasn’t been any danger for many years. ”

With that, Shelly carried Bella and strode away.

Benjamin stared at Shelly’s slender back. He remembered that when he first met Shelly in high school, she was still chubby. Her body was round, and there was baby fat on her face. Her skin was probably the best in their class, and everyone liked to describe Shelly as white and fat.

Yet, after a year, Shelly had suddenly become so thin. In fact, Shelly had lost weight when she was in her third year of high school. However, she did not seem to have lost that much weight.

Looking at Shelly from afar, she looked heartbreakingly skinny. Was it because of aesthetics or… had life been too hard for her?

What she said about not being in danger for many years just now… Did that mean Shelly was always alone with her daughter? Did she divorce her husband? Or was it because her husband did not treat her well enough?

Benjamin thought about it a lot as he watched Shelly get into a taxi and disappear from his sight. He really did not expect to see Shelly again after so many years.

When Shelly carried Bella home, Sarah had already fallen asleep, and, of course, Shelly would not disturb Sarah.

She carried Bella, who was already half-asleep, to the room. Then, she placed Bella on the bed and went to pour a glass of water for Bella to take her medicine.

“Bella, take your medicine,” Shelly coaxed her.

Bella had been very obedient since she was young. She probably knew that it was very hard for Shelly to take care of her, so she did as she was told.

The medicine was actually a little bitter, and Bella was having a hard time swallowing it. However, she ate it all in the end.

Shelly’s heart ached when she saw that. She gave her some water before taking off Bella’s clothes and letting her sleep.

Then, she touched Bella’s forehead. Only after realizing that her fever had subsided that Shelly felt slightly more at ease and lay down beside Bella.

Just as she was about to fall asleep, she heard the sound of a text message notification. Shelly quickly got up and prepared to turn off the silent mode of her phone when she saw a string of numbers from her bank.

It took her a long time to read it, but she counted 200 thousand dollars. She did not expect Zoe to really give her money! Moreover, Zoe was so proactive. Zoe must be so rich that 200 thousand dollars was nothing to her.

What she was surprised about, though, was that Zoe still gave her 200 million dollars even atter knowing it was impossible between her and Nox. It it were her, she might not give that sum of money to herself because it was just a waste!

Nevertheless, she did not refuse as there was no harm in having more money. She was so poor now, so to her, whoever gave her money was her savior.

If Zoe had not sent her a photo, she would have thought Zoe was a good person. However, she looked at the photo of Zoe and Nox lying together.

Nox was asleep while Zoe was not. She was taking a selfie with the camera. They were both covered with blankets, but the parts of their arms and collarbones that were not covered with blankets were bare. In other words, they were not wearing anything under the blanket.

When Shelly saw the picture, she smiled. She thought as she deleted it. ‘Is there a need for Zoe to show that she’s superior like that? For a man like Nox, there’s no reason for him not to have sex with someone else..’
