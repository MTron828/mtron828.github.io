1171 The War Has Started: William Gates’s Identity Exposed

Warren looked at her.

“I think it’s been too long. Logically speaking, the Sanders’ residence is only so big. No matter what, we should be able to find them after searching for so long,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Warren nodded. “Alright, go and take a look.”

“Father!” Chester suddenly walked over. “I want to go with her.”

Warren frowned.

“I’m worried about Jeannie being alone,” Chester said bluntly. “I’m not being paranoid, but it’s just that Jeannie clearly let Edward go earlier. No matter what, they’re husband and wife, and they’re about to have two children soon. She might be soft-hearted.”

Chester really knew how to make use of every opportunity.

“I didn’t let Edward go on purpose. If I had let him go, I wouldn’t have brought him back here! All my attention is on William. Compared to Edward, William is more important,” Jeanne retorted.

“I don’t know who’s more important, but the current situation is that we haven’t found either of them! I request to go out with Jeanne to look for her!” Chester was very determined.

The situation was visibly tense.

“Stop arguing!” Warren’s expression was serious. “I won’t be biased toward anyone. Since you both want to take the initiative to find Edward and William, you two should go together. If the other party tries to play any tricks, you two can take care of each other!”

“Yes,” Jeanne and Chester replied in unison.

The two of them walked out of the hall without wasting any more time.

Outside the main hall but within the Sanders’ residence, there were many guards, and all of them were out looking for the two people.

As soon as Jeanne and Chester walked out of the main entrance, they saw that the guards were all assassins from the Hills.

They formed multiple security layers and had the place surrounded. On top of that, Edward and William’s mobile phones had been confiscated, and they could not get out. There was no way to send out a signal to the outside world, and they could not get any help. It was really impossible for the two of them to escape tonight!

Jeanne and Chester shuttled through the corners of the Sanders’ residence. They asked everyone who was patrolling, but none found anything unusual.

“Should we split up and search?” Jeanne asked Chester.

“What are you trying to do?” Chester was very hostile to Jeanne.

Before Jeanne returned to the Sanders, Warren would discuss everything with him and tell him everything. Now that Jeanne was here, he was not involved in everything anymore. He did not even know anything about tonight’s incident!

From the looks of it, it was all Jeanne’s act.

He had to admit that if not for William’s cunning escape, Jeanne’s act would have really done the Sanders a great service.

Then, Jeanne’s status in the Sanders would be higher than the rest.

Chester could not bear the thought of the blow he had suffered from Jeanne over the past few days.

He was following Jeanne now not because he did not trust her. Since Jeanne had already done so much for them, he had no choice but to believe her. However, he just did not want Jeanne to take all the credit.

If they really caught Edward and William, in any case, they would both take the credit.

Jeanne did not want to waste time with Chester. As she examined everything in the Sanders’ residence, she was also thinking about where two people could hide.

Just like that, they spent nearly an hour walking around the Sanders’ residence, but William and Edward seemed to have disappeared into thin air.

Not a single shadow could be seen.

When Jeanne and Chester returned to the main hall, Warren asked, “How did it go?”

“We found nothing,” Chester replied.

“The Sanders’ residence is so big, yet you can’t even find two people. Are you all useless?!” Warren flew into a rage again.

In fact, Jeanne also found it unbelievable. How was it possible that they really could not find those two people?

As long as they did not leave, which it was obvious that they had not, she would definitely be able to find him.

However, where were they hiding now?

Jeanne and Chester accepted the scolding and did not dare to speak.

The moment Warren was about to lose his temper again, a doctor hurriedly walked over from a corner of the hall. “Leader, Ms. Stacey is seriously injured. We suspect that there is internal bleeding in her head, so we need to do a CT scan of her brain to confirm her condition. If necessary, we will choose to perform a craniotomy on her. Therefore, we need to apply to bring her to the hospital for a systematic examination and treatment. Otherwise–”

“Otherwise, what will happen?!” Warren asked fiercely.
