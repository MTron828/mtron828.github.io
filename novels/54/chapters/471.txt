Alexander’s expression was grim.

In the face of Fourth Master Swan, Alexander was still afraid of him, regardless of whether he was his son-in-law.

He looked at Edward and put down his hand angrily. He said, “Jeanne, you’ve always been competitive since you were young, so you can’t stand to see Jasmine being better than you! Haven’t the lessons from seven years ago taught you the truth? Yet, you could still set your sister up. You made me feel that raising a dog would’ve been better than raising you!”

Raising a dog would have been better than raising her, huh?

Jeanne looked at Alexander coldly. If she was worse than a dog, he was not even qualified to raise a dog!

Jeanne’s eyes turned cold. “I can make Jasmine suffer any time. Would I have needed to use such despicable methods? The only person who would use such methods is Jasmine!”

“Sister, I’ve never treated you badly. Ever since we were young, I have always listened to you. Other than the matter with Eden, I have never done anything to you. Everyone around us knows I always followed behind you when we were kids. Whatever you wanted me to do, I would do it. What else do you want me to do? All I did was snatch Eden away! If you had said back then that you loved Eden very much and that you wanted to be together with him, I wouldn’t have snatched him away from you even if I loved Eden terribly.”

“The only person I love is you. There’s no way I would be together with Jeanne,” Eden quickly added.

At that moment, he held Jasmine in his arms again, showing his deep affection for her.

Jeanne looked at them coldly. In her mind, she was only thinking about how stupid she was back then to treat Jasmine as her sister, and that was why Jasmine liked Eden.

How stupid was she back then?

At that moment, she regulated her emotions, wondering what she had to do to make the two of them suffer for what they did.

However, her silence at that moment made people assume she was powerless to refute.

......

As such, Belle took the opportunity to say, “Jeanne, you don’t have anything to say, do you? You have no reasons to justify yourself anymore! Jeanne, how can you be so mean to use a fetus to take revenge?”

“Sister-in-law, bad people can do all kinds of bad, let alone a fetus. If Jasmine gave birth to a boy, Jeanne might even strangle the child to death!” Elaine fanned the flames.

Jeanne still did not react because she was still thinking about some things — methods that could humiliate those people completely.

Seeing that Jeanne did not say anything, Elaine pushed her luck. “Actually, this matter is very simple. Jeanne has always been brooding over Eden and Jasmine. However, it’s not because Jeanne still likes Eden. In fact, Jeanne might not like Eden anymore. After all, with Edward in the picture, she probably wouldn’t be interested in Eden anymore. But even though she isn’t interested in Eden, it doesn’t mean she can forgive him for what happened back then. Think about it. Jeanne was quite pitiful back then because of Eden and Jasmine.”

Elaine explained that matter as a bystander, which in a short time, allowed more people to believe her.

Elaine continued saying, “Back then, because Jeanne couldn’t accept Eden and Jasmine being together and because she didn’t know better, she caused the entire South Hampton City to be in an uproar. When it got out of hand, and the truth of the matter came to light, Jeanne’s unreasonable behavior became known to all, ruining her reputation. Later on, because the Lawrences couldn’t withstand the pressure, they sent Jeanne out of the country. At that time, Jeanne was only 18 years old. At 18 years old, she was living abroad alone, and I’m sure life for her wasn’t easy. Apparently...” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Elaine paused for a moment as if she did not want to make Jeanne look bad.

She turned her head and looked at Jeanne. “Jeanne, I’m just analyzing this matter from a bystander’s point of view. Please don’t take it to heart.”

“Please go on, sister. I’m listening.” Jeanne was unmoved.

She was giving them time to perform.

Elaine was rather surprised by Jeanne’s indifference. Hence, she did not think too much at that moment. Other than the Swans, she looked down on everyone else. She said, “Apparently, George was born to a man whom Jeanne randomly found to play up to. I also heard that later on, in order to live a better life, you found more men to help you. Otherwise, where would you have gotten your assets of more than 50 billion dollars? Thinking about it this way, Edward also gave you his shares, which are worth a few billion in the market, hence increasing your assets. However, I’m also a little curious. How did you make men willingly throw money at you? That’s not the point, of course, and I don’t want to take it in the wrong direction.”
