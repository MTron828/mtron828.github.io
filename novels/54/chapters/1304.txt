1305 Drunk and Sleepy, Meeting Paige

She lay on the bed for a while, looking at her phone.

She wondered if someone had taken photos of her bringing Candice to the nightclub today and posted them online. She had no news value, but Candice was now a popular topic in the media. They could not wait to conduct a special interview with her. If someone took photos of her and sold them to the reporters, she would be in big trouble. Most importantly, Edward had come last night. If someone took photos of Edward coming to the nightclub…

No matter what, she felt that she had overplayed her hand tonight.

The more she thought about it, the more afraid she became.

It had been so many years since she had done something so impulsive. She had been provoked by Candice.

She thought about it and decided to give Finn a call. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was actually a little late now and she really did not want to disturb him at this hour.

She suddenly remembered that Finn had left the city today. However, he had never told her his whereabouts and she had forgotten to ask him about it.

When the phone rang, Finn’s sleepy voice could be heard, “Monica, it’s so late. Why aren’t you asleep?”

“Let me tell you something. So help me find out what Edward said.” Monica was a little anxious.

“Okay, go ahead.” On the other side, Finn was quite patient.

The two of them had been together for the past few years.

They were both… accommodating to each other.

Monica told Finn about what happened today.

Finn smiled, “Why did you bring Candice to the nightclub then?”

“I just wanted Candice to see more of the world!” Monica found an excuse.

Obviously, Finn did not believe her.

“Alright, alright. I’m just trying to get back at Edward. Who asked him to fall in love with someone else so quickly? I just wanted to bring Candice to the nightclub to anger Edward. No matter what, men care a lot about women coming to such a place to have fun,” Monica added, still feeling a little guilty. “I completely forgot about Edward’s and Candice’s identities. If the media finds out anything and there’s any negative news, I don’t think I’ll live past this year!”

“Don’t worry, Fourth Master has already thought of the things that you can think of.” Finn did not even need to confirm to be sure that Monica’s so-called worries would not happen.

“You’re saying Edward will handle it himself?”

“Mm.” Finn nodded.

“Really?”

“Yes,” Finn answered affirmatively.

To Monica, Finn was trustworthy.

She could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

“But be careful next time. After all, he’s now the Chief of Harken. The negative news will affect him greatly,” Finn reminded.

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

She would never dare do it again.

This time, she was already frightened when she thought about it. How could there be a next time?

“By the way, how do you feel after hanging out with Candice all day?” It was rare for Finn to take the initiative to show his concern for her.

Monica changed her sleeping posture and did not hide anything. “I just accompanied her for a day. This person is not too difficult to get along with. It’s just that…”

“Are you rejecting her psychologically?” Finn smiled.

“If she wasn’t related to Edward and wasn’t going to become her wife, I really think I could be friends with this person. Who asked her to snatch Jeanne’s position?” Monica had never been able to forgive and forget when it came to Jeanne.

Finn said, “I think you can get along well with her.”

“No way! The next time Edward asks me to spend time with her, I’ll reject,” Monica said righteously.

“You won’t.” Finn was certain.

“Did you also realize that I’m b*tching about Edward? Are you looking down on me too?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

“No.” Finn paused for a moment, “You will understand in the future.”

Monica felt that Finn was hiding something.

“Actually, Sir has never fallen in love with anyone else,” Finn said.

“Yes, he’s always liked Jeanne. I can tell that he likes her. But he’s cold-blooded. He’s doing this for his own power. He can abandon anyone and make use of anyone! Forget it, let’s not talk about it. I’m afraid I won’t be able to control my fury.”

Finn smiled helplessly.

There were some things that he really could not tell her.

“Don’t think too much. Go to bed early.”

“Okay, bye.” Monica did not say anything else.

Neither did she ask Finn about his business trip, nor did Finn tell her how he was doing.
