998 Monica’s First Victory, Michael’s First Defeat

Steve was also dumbfounded.

Seeing Monica leave, he quickly chased after her.

When he caught up with her, he saw that after Monica had left the sight of the reporters and cameras, she was running like a rabbit. She did look like a domineering CEO at all. From a distance, she still looked like a young lady, but that young lady could surprisingly use her charm to convince the audience!

Steve caught up with her in a few steps.

Meanwhile, Monica had run straight to her small car.

Steve quickly knocked on the door of her passenger seat and sat in the passenger seat.

Monica glanced at Steve, took a deep breath, stepped on the accelerator, and left.

“Why are you running so fast?” Steve asked while panting.

“If I don’t run faster, I’ll be annoyed to death by those reporters! So, of course, I have to run before they react.” Monica let out a sigh of relief and said as if it was a matter of course, “I was so domineering just now. I will definitely become their hot topic. I have to leave.”

No one could be so confident, but he had to admit that Monica had made people look at her in a new light.

“Oh no!” Monica suddenly braked.

Steve lost his balance and bumped his head.

He looked at Monica in shock, thinking, ‘She really can’t be praised too much. Look at what happened in the next second!”

“I forgot to take my godson with me! F*ck! If Fourth Master Swan, finds out that I left his son behind, I think he would beat me to death.” With that, Monica immediately turned around.

“Are you talking about George?” Steve asked as he rubbed his head.

Monica nodded.

“When I was chasing after you, I saw him leaving with another man and went to another black car, which was parked right next to you.”

“Why didn’t I see him?” Monica tried to recall.

“Miss, weren’t you busy running for your life?”

“I’ll call and ask.” Monica did not turn around, but still worried, she gave George a call.

After making sure that George had returned safely, he heaved a sigh of relief and drove to the hospital.

“Where would you like to go?” Monica asked while driving.

“I can go and see the chairman too.”

“It’s better if you don’t. If you go, I’m afraid my dad will talk about work again. You can get off at the intersection ahead and go directly to the company.” Monica was not afraid to turn Steve down.

“Alright.” Since the boss had spoken, Steve did not dare to refuse.

Monica parked the car by the side of the road.

Steve opened the car door. The moment he got out of the car, he turned around and said, “Ms. Cardellini, you did very well today.”

Monica’s face turned red. To be praised so openly, she would be embarrassed too. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She cleared her throat and pretended to be calm. “You’re too kind.”

“I wish the chairman a smooth surgery tomorrow.”

“Of course.” Monica was very determined.

Steve then got out of the car, not wasting more of Monica’s time.

Monica quickly drove the car to the hospital.

She did not know why, but she was a little excited. She just wanted to share the results of today’s work with her father so that he could undergo the surgery in peace.

However, before she went to the hospital, she felt that there was something she had to do.

She suddenly turned the steering wheel and sped in the other direction.

…

Since Monica won the first round, someone else would suffer the defeat.

Michael threw the phone in front of him, which was playing the video, to the ground and smashed it.

However, before he could vent his emotions, his commonly used phone rang.

He suppressed his emotions and looked at his phone. However, that one glance made him feel even more depressed.

He closed his eyes and gave himself a second to recover before picking up the phone. “Leader.”

“Michael, what the hell are you doing?” The other party did not disguise his anger.

Michael gritted his teeth, unable to refute.

If it were the first time when Monica schemed against him and destroyed his marriage in public, he could say that he was unprepared for Monica. However, this time, he could not find any reason to explain why he had fallen into Monica’s hands again.

At that moment, he even wanted to take revenge on himself for his negligence toward Monica, which allowed her to show off in front of him again and again.
