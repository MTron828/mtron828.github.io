1161 The War Has Started: Igniting the War

In the bathroom, Jeanne was very serious as she helped Edward shave his beard. Though, ultimately, he still had one or two scratches.

Jeanne washed him with clean water, cleaning him bit by bit.

“I’m sorry,” Jeanne said. Her voice was low, and her eyes fixed on the small wound on his jaw.

“It’s okay,” Edward replied.

Jeanne was not just apologizing for this tiny scratch, and it seemed Edward understood. After everything she had done to him, including forcing him to come here today, he forgave her.

The two suddenly fell silent.

Their eyes met.

There were so many emotions, but it was as if there were none.

They looked into each other’s eyes, which were familiar yet strange.

Jeanne closed her eyes.

A kiss was planted on her lips.

They touched each other gently, trying to feel each other’s warmth. There was still some left.

Slowly, the lips on hers started to mold hers.

The temperature in the bathroom was rising.

Edward carried Jeanne out of the bathroom and kissed her. He placed her on the big bed and pressed his body on top of hers.

Mason was still in the room. During this period, he had not left Jeanne’s side. They even slept in the same room. Though, Jeanne would sleep on the bed while he slept on the sofa.

He saw the two passionate people. Should he go?

A long time passed.

In the end, Mason did not leave.

To him, protecting Jeanne was the most important thing, and Edward was likely to threaten her life. So, he could only stand in the room and watch as they kissed.

“Still not leaving?” A deep male voice suddenly rang out in the room.

Mason’s eyes moved slightly. He knew that Edward was talking about him.

He looked at Jeanne and her flushed cheeks. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jeanne said, “I won’t leave.”

Edward looked at Jeanne. She was lying under him. Her clothes were wrinkled, and the lust on her face was obvious.

“Don’t you care about being exposed?” Edward asked her.

Jeanne did not answer, signifying a silent agreement.

Edward seemed to smile. When he did, he was still extremely charming.

At that moment, she felt a heart-penetrating coldness.

The next second, he kissed her again.

It was different from his eagerness just now. Now, he seemed to be a little ruthless.

The movement was so big that it hurt Jeanne a little.

She no longer cared about the presence of another man in the room. Under such circumstances...

“Edward.” Jeanne grabbed his hand. Her lips left his.

Edward’s eyes were filled with anger. No... It was lust.

He was venting.

“Don’t be like this,” Jeanne said. “I’m pregnant.”

Edward looked at her intently. He probably did not believe it.

Even if he had been threatened by her to come here, he probably still would not have fully believed she was pregnant. After all, they had been in a hurry that day and had only done it once.

They never did it again after that, and It could not be such a coincidence that she got pregnant on the first try. However, she really did get pregnant.

“It’s true. I’m not lying to you, “Jeanne told him seriously.

Edward clutched the bedsheets tightly as if he was trying to restrain himself. He had to control his emotions.

“I admit that I thought about not wanting her,” Jeanne said. “When I first found out that I was pregnant at Delta Island, my first thought was to abort it because I felt it was not the right time. However, I decided to keep it because I couldn’t bear to.”

Edward’s adam’s apple bobbed.

“I gave birth to George because I didn’t have the means to get rid of the child. However, I can’t bear to part with this child. This is… a child born from love, and I won’t abandon it. Mm.” Jeanne’s lips were, once again, sealed by Edward.

It seemed he did not want to listen anymore.

She felt his lips on hers, and they were pressed so tight that not even a single drop of air could pass through.

It was as if he was making sure of her existence.

Until...

They panted heavily.

Edward moved away from Jeanne. He calmed himself down and lay down beside her.
