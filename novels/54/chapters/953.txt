954 I Can’t Think of a Title Anymore, Let’s See What the Officials Do

He spoke in a very weak voice, and after he finished speaking, he was panting.

Monica laughed as well.

It was not that she understand him but that she was really afraid of losing him.

That night, Monica kept chatting with her father until they both fell asleep.

Early the next morning, Ruby walked into the ward, probably still worried about her husband.

However, Monica and Gary both decided not to tell her about what happened last night.

Now, her mother was their family’s treasure, and they had to take good care of her.

When Ruby walked into the ward and saw that Monica had already gotten up and even washed up, she was still a little surprised.

Usually, Monica would be lazing in bed.

It was only 7 a.m. in the morning, and Sarah was still sleeping at home.

Of course, she did not disturb Sarah. Ruby was the kind of person who really doted on children.

“Monica, you’re up early.” Ruby was a little surprised.

“I’m now the backbone of our family, and I have to act like one!

Ruby was speechless at her daughter’s words.

However, she smiled dotingly. “Yes, yes, yes. You’re the backbone of the family. How was your dad last night?”

“Very well,” Monica replied.

Then, she deliberately glanced at her father and stuck out her little tongue mischievously.

Gary also smiled faintly.

At that moment, she realized that family was more important than anything else.

“Oh, right. Where’s Sarah? Did she bring my clothes?” Monica asked.

“Sarah is still sleeping. Let her sleep a little longer. It must have been hard on her to stay with me in the hospital over the last two days. I brought you your clothes.” As Ruby spoke, she opened a suitcase that she had brought.

Monica watched as her mother unpacked the luggage while looking for her clothes.

“Mom, are you planning to have a holiday here? You brought so many things!” Monica looked at the daily necessities in her mother’s suitcase.

“I’m still worried about leaving your dad here alone, and that’s why I brought everything. I’ll ask the maid to send the bed sheets over later. It should help me get used to the bed here.”

“Alright, I know. You just can’t leave dad alone.”

“You child!” Ruby pretended to be angry.

Monica smiled. “Mom, didn’t you bring me a bra?”

“I did.” Ruby replied, “Let me look for it. I’m sure I did, but where did I put it?”

Ruby searched the suitcase.

In the meantime, Monica hugged her clothes and waited for a long time.

When Ruby finally found it, she handed it to Monica, who looked at the pink bra in disdain. “Mom, I don’t like this one.”

“What’s there to dislike about pink?”

“In this world, only children and old women like pink.”

Ruby was stunned for a second, but the next moment, she said angrily, “Are you itching for a beating? ”

Monica smiled brightly.

In this house, Monica would always be the one to light up the family.

Everyone was questioning their family’s decision to raise such an unruly child, but only they themselves knew how great and adorable their child was.

Monica pretended to be disgusted and took the bra from her mother’s hand. She even shook it a few times in her hand.

Just as she was about to say that she was going to change, the door of the ward was pushed open.

Then, Finn and a group of doctors and nurses walked in.

It was probably a routine ward round.

Then, everyone saw Monica’s bra shaking in her hands, and the cup size looked a little big. It made those who did not want to look at her, look.

At that moment, the situation was… a little awkward. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Monica was being stared at by at least a dozen pairs of eyes, and her face instantly turned red.

At that moment, she was so helpless that he did not know what to do next.

“Ahem.” Finn, who was standing at the front, cleared his throat.

Monica suddenly came back to her senses. Then, she turned around and rushed into the bathroom.

She was embarrassed every day.

Monica looked at herself in the mirror. Her face was as red as a tomato.

How was she going to face the doctors and nurses in the cardiology department in the future?

Most importantly…

She looked down at the pink bra, which was not her style at all. Would that not be misleading?

However, she washed her face and tried to calm herself down.

That was when she saw some hickeys on her neck.

She did not wear the hospital gown from last night as she had found a new set to change into. On top of that, her hair was quite long, so the hickeys were barely noticeable. Clearly, her mother did not notice.
