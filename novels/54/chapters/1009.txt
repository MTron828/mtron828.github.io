1010 Identity Exposed: Jeanne Is the Sanders’ Third Princess!

The black car drove straight into the Sanders’ residence, where the leader of Harken lived.

It was located in the middle of the southernmost area of South Hampton City, separated from the tallest buildings in South Hampton City by a moat.

The Sanders’ residence was located in the south and faced the north. In front of it was a solemn and mighty gate, where four National Guards stood guard. As the car drove through the gate and past a large courtyard, there were also several guards standing guard in the courtyard at a distance. The overall feeling was too solemn and oppressive.

The car stopped at the innermost courtyard.

The entrance to the courtyard was guarded by eight guards.

At that moment, a guard stepped forward and respectfully opened the car door for Jeanne.

As Jeanne got out of the car, the guards standing there saluted in unison, showing great respect to her.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She then followed one of the guards, crossed an arched bridge over a stream, and stepped into a tall gate.

Inside, the leader of Harken, Warren Sanders, was sitting in the middle.

On his left sat Chester, who was Warren’s eldest son and the most popular candidate among the current leader’s heirs.

Next to Chester was Justin, Warren’s fourth son.

Quinn, Warren’s second daughter, was sitting on Warren’s right.

The seat next to Quinn was empty, and next to that seat was Stacey, Warren’s younger daughter.

As for Warren’s wife, Chester’s wife, and Quinn’s fiancé, none of them was there.

It seemed like only those with the surname Sanders were present for this occasion.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

“Leader,” she said respectfully.

“You’re still calling me that, huh?” Warren smiled.

His smile was bright and very affable.

However, Jeanne remained silent.

Warren did not force her. Instead, he said calmly, “I sent everyone else away today, except for my family. Don’t be shy. Sit.”

Of course, Jeanne saw the empty space between Quinn and Stacey, which should have been Melody’s.

However, because Melody was already dead, they left it empty for her.

Jeanne walked over and sat down.

The moment she sat down, the rest of the Sanders flashed her a friendly smile.

Even so, Jeanne pursed her lips and did not respond.

“It’s been hard on you all these years.” Warren’s voice was gentle as he spoke to Jeanne.

“No,” Jeanne replied, “I’m fine.”

“If Kingsley hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t have known that I had a daughter among the common folk. Back then, your mother and I…” Warren sighed.

Jeanne did not reply.

“I thought it was just a fling, and I didn’t expect that she would give birth to a child for me. Before I could thank her, she had already passed away.” Warren was a little sad as if he was recalling Jeanne’s mother.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly as she said, “She might have had her own reasons for not telling you.”

“She didn’t want to put me in a difficult position. After all, I have a family.” Warren said with a hint of helplessness and self-deprecation, “Who would have thought that as the leader of a country, I would make the mistake that all men would make?”

“Jeanne’s mother was beautiful. Any man’s heart would be moved by her, so it’s understandable for you to have fallen for her, father. Moreover, mother has already forgiven you for your mistake back then and has accepted the existence of our third sister.” Chester’s words gave Warren a way out.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered as she glanced at the man sitting opposite her.

The third in the “third sister” that he mentioned and the “Third Young Lady” the man in the black suit respectfully referred to her as were all because of her age. Coincidentally, Melody was dead, so that ranking seemed to make sense.

Jeanne remained silent and did not interrupt.

She had no feelings for those people and would never feel for them.

Fortunately, Warren did not mention anything else. After all, his goal today was not to reminisce about the past!

He began to talk about his daily life and asked Jeanne, “When did you come back to South Hampton City?”

“A few days ago.”

“I thought Kingsley took you to the Delta Islands and that you’ve been there the whole time. He said you’d be the safest by his side.” It was as if he was asking why Kingsley did not want to keep her here.

At the end of the day, she also had the identity of the Hills’ eldest daughter. She was not just the Third Princess of the Sanders. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She replied, “I came back because of some matters.”

“The Cardellinis’ matter,” Warren said. He was finally getting to the point.

Jeanne looked up at Warren. She had no reason to lie, so she nodded and said, “Yes.”
