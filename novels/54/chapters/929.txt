930 Out of Danger, Cardellini Enterprise’s Emergency

“Alright,” Monica agreed.

Finn left the ward after leaving his instructions.

In the ward, Ruby was still crying.

“Mom, don’t cry. Dad will feel terrible if you do.” Monica suppressed her emotions and comforted her mother.

“If he feels terrible about it, he should wake up. He should wake up…” Ruby was on the verge of a mental breakdown and was finding it hard to calm down.

Monica did not know what to say.

“He knows how important he is to me, but he’s still asleep. Monica… I’m really scared that this will be it for your father.” Ruby was heartbroken.

Only when she was extremely sad would she show all her vulnerability.

Monica hugged Ruby. “Mom, it won’t happen. Dad will definitely wake up. Finn said that we still have one more night. We can wake him up.”

Ruby against Monica and cried painfully.

However, not many miracles existed in the world.

That night, they called out to Gary for the entire night, but he still did not wake up. He just lay on the bed without any reaction. He did not even have an expression on his face.

Ruby passed out from crying, and Monica quickly told Sarah to inform Finn.

Finn immediately rushed to the ward and did a physical examination on Ruby. After confirming that she had just fallen asleep due to excessive sadness, he told Ruby to rest. After all, Ruby was already 50 years old, and her body could not withstand the torment of staying up a whole day and night. Moreover, in situations where one was really sad, fainting was also a way to calm them down and give them some rest.

Once Monica was certain that her mother was fine, Monica thanked Finn.

Finn did not reply, and Monica did not react to it as well.

In fact, when she saw how dedicated Finn was to save her father, she was already so grateful that she did not dare to make any requests of him.

Even though Finn’s professional ethics might be the same for any of his patients, she was still grateful.

“Monica, what should we do? Aunt has fainted, but uncle is still unconscious.” Sarah asked worriedly.

It was already 6 a.m. in the morning. Finn said that if her dad did not wake up before 8 a.m., his chances of waking up would be slim.

That meant there were only two hours left.

Even so, she did not want to give up.

She said, “Sarah, you should get some sleep too.”

Sarah shook her head. “No, I want to stay with all of you.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

That night, Sarah almost fell asleep a few times.

“Be good. If you faint, I’ll have to take care of you too.” Monica’s tone was a little serious.

“But… I really want to stay with you…”

“I’m talking to my dad.” Monica said, “I’m afraid I won’t be able to say it with you around.”

Sarah looked at Monica in a daze.

“Let’s go to my lounge.” Finn suddenly said.

At that moment, Finn did not leave immediately after checking on her mother’s condition.

Sarah turned to look at Finn in disbelief.

“There’s not enough room for you to sleep here,” Finn said.

There was only one accompanying bed in the high-class ward.

Although there was also a sofa, and it was fine for her to squeeze in, who would want his girlfriend to sleep like that?

Finn had changed.

Monica remembered that she used to come to Finn’s office to look for him from time to time, especially when her father was undergoing a physical examination and she was the one who accompanied him. Occasionally, when she got bored from waiting, she would also want to go to the private lounge in Finn’s office to lie down for a while. However, Finn would chase her out every time.

It was no doubt that he treated Sarah differently.

She felt Finn and Sarah leave and did not turn to look at them as they left because she was afraid that she would be sad.

She had to let him go even though she was still a little sad.

Her eyes moved slightly as she looked at her father lying on the bed as if he was dead.

His face was pale and his body was motionless.

“Dad,” Monica called out to him in a very gentle voice.

“I haven’t told you, have I? I actually love you very much.” Monica said with tears in her eyes, “When I was young, I was a naughty child and would always make you unhappy. Every time I made a mistake, you would be so angry that you would glare at me. But every time, you still couldn’t bear to hit or scold me. As long as I cried, you would lose all your principles. Whether it was my rebellious behavior or my stubbornness in love when I grew up, I have done many things that hurt you and my mother, but you still love me unconditionally and selflessly. I really don’t know what I did in my past life to deserve the best parents in the world…”
