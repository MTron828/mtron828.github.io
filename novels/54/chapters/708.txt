He arrived at his destination on his motorcycle in no time, and what awaited him was a black car.

Seeing him arrive, the people in the car quickly got out.

Edward stopped the motorcycle.

The person who got out was old, but at that moment, he was extremely respectful to Edward. “Young Master.”

Edward nodded as he walked over to the back seat of the car.

Then, the car door opened, revealing a man sitting in the back seat.

Under the night sky, the figure was blurry and could not be made out clearly.

His voice was cold. “You’re here.”

“Yes.” Edward appeared respectful.

“Let’s go.” With that, the man got down from the car and stood in front of Edward.

At a close distance, Edward could see the black mask on the man’s face. It covered everything below his eyes, and there was a cap on his head that covered his forehead. Edward could only vaguely see his deep, calm eyes.

The man walked in front, and Edward followed behind him.

“Young Master.” An old voice sounded from behind.

Edward turned his head around.

“I’ll leave the Eldest Young Master to you.” The old man entrusted Edward with the man.

“Okay.” Edward agreed solemnly.

After that, he sat on the motorcycle while the man sat behind him.

Then, they left on the motorcycle.

The old man looked at their backs and watched them disappear into the crowd. He sighed and said, “Things in Harken are about to change again!”

In the dark night, the motorcycle was traveling at lightning speed. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

No one spoke on the way until Edward’s phone rang.

He looked at the incoming call and connected it to his Bluetooth. “Nox.”

“I only have one person on my side.”

Edward frowned.

“If I’m not mistaken, there should be six people. However, we’ve only taken out five of them. In other words, one of them has been caught.” Nox went straight to the point. “That one person might have followed you here, or they might have escaped themselves.”

“It can’t be the second one.” Assassins would never give up halfway. Otherwise, they would die if they went back.

“If they followed you here, they would have found out our purpose for coming here,” Nox said bluntly. “Have you picked him up?”

“Yes.”

“In that case, what should we do now?”

“Find them and kill them!”

“I’ll come and pick you up.” Nox did not say much.

“Okay.”

As soon as Edward hung up the phone, the person behind him asked, “Have you been found out?”

“I can solve it,” Edward replied.

The person behind him did not say anything else.

With that, Edward continued on with the motorcycle.

Lucy was indeed in Edward’s vicinity at that moment.

She was chasing after Edward’s motorcycle. Of course, her walking speed was much slower than Edward’s motorcycle, but she had a feeling that Edward was not leaving on the motorcycle. In fact, he had another purpose, and since he was escaping, he would definitely come back.

Therefore, as she chased, she was also waiting.

Lucy became the number one assassin back then not only because of her strong skills but also because of her amazing logical reasoning ability. That was also the reason why Kingsley kept her by his side. She was indeed very useful.

When she saw the motorcycle appear again, she could vaguely see that Edward was not alone.

Suddenly, her heart started beating a little faster.

Even an assassin would instinctively feel nervous when he or she discovered new information at that moment.

She raised her pistol and aimed it at the motorcycle.

To be able to make Fourth Master Swan spend so much effort and set up such an extensive scheme to rescue him, his identity was definitely not simple.

If her guess was correct, that person should be the person they were looking for now.

She pointed at the motorcycle, and suddenly, a gunshot rang out.

The motorcycle’s tires were instantly blown off. Following that, the speeding motorcycle fell, and the two of them immediately fell to the ground.

When they fell, one of them was obviously protecting the other under his body.

As they both rolled on the ground several times, Lucy ran over quickly without even stopping for half a second.

This time, her goal was not to kill but to determine who the other man was.

After all, Kingsley had been tracking them for so long, and now they were finally close.

When Lucy got closer, the two people were seriously injured and had fallen unconscious.

She squatted down to check on the man that Edward was protecting. It was only at a close distance that she could see that the man’s face was covered by a black mask, which made it impossible to see who it was.

While Lucy took out her phone and was prepared to take a photo, she reached out to remove the man’s mask…

“Ah!” Pain shot through Lucy’s body.

At that moment, someone kicked her away ruthlessly.

At the moment of the kick, Lucy’s hand tore open the man’s mask and scratched the man’s cheek. However, she did not see his face.

That was because Edward’s hand blocked her line of sight the second his mask fell off.

In the next second, they started fighting crazily.

Lucy and Fourth Master Swan exchanged a few blows with their bare hands.

Lucy knew very well that she was no match for Fourth Master Swan. She could hold on for a while but not for long.

Moreover, she also heard the sound of a sedan from afar. It was likely that Fourth Master Swan’s men had arrived, which meant that she had even less of a chance of winning.

She made a prompt decision and immediately retreated from the fight by turning around and leaving quickly.

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

He picked up the pistol that had fallen to the ground, aimed at the figure that had left in the darkness, and shot it accurately on that person’s back.

Lucy suddenly fell to the ground.

The moment she fell, she could hear the sound of footsteps approaching her.

Then, an ice-cold black muzzle was aimed at Lucy’s head.

“Fourth Master Swan,” Lucy called his name. “I’m Lucy!”

The hand that pulled the trigger paused.
