The way Shelly saw it, a man like Nox would never look for her again.

“I just wanted to say…” Shelly bit her lip. “If you don’t mind my past with Nox and that I have Bella, let’s date.”

Benjamin thought he had misheard. He had prepared himself for the possibility that he could not be with Shelly or even for Shelly to reconcile with Nox after tonight. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

In fact, Shelly may not be able to tell, but as a bystander, he could tell that Nox did not deliberately pick a fight to make Shelly sad. He just liked Shelly but could not find a way to express it. That was why he chose such a childish method.

He thought that Nox would confess. Considering that Shelly wanted to marry NOX DaCK tnen, It NOX contessea, sne11Y nmgnt return to NOX’S side. Even It ne could not see Shelly’s love for Nox, anyone could compromise when it came to money.

Moreover, he did not want to force Shelly to be with him because he was not capable enough. Shelly had been through so much, and other than keeping her company, there seemed to be nothing else he could do.

That was the difference in status. In that aspect, he could never compare to Nox, and he would not stop Shelly from pursuing happiness. Therefore, when Shelly came back today, he planned to leave quietly.

Sometimes, he felt that as long as Shelly was happy, he was fine with his decision. Besides, when one like someone, all they wanted was to make the other party happy.

However, he had never expected Shelly suddenly to suggest they started dating. He really could not believe it.

Shelly looked at Benjamin’s sudden silence and said calmly, “Think about it. You don’t have to give me an answer now, or you don’t have to give me an answer at all.”

After all, any man would care about her innocence and whether she would be a burden.

The moment Shelly turned to leave, Benjamin suddenly hugged her tightly as if he was afraid that she would run away, and that sudden action made her heart flutter.

Just like that, the two of them hugged for a long time before Benjamin said, “Shelly, did I hear wrongly?”

Shelly pursed her lips tightly.

“Did I hear wrongly? Are you willing to go out with me?” Benjamin asked her.

Shelly nodded shyly.

“I don’t mind. In fact, I’m very excited. I didn’t expect you to agree to date me. I…” Benjamin was so excited that he could not articulate his thoughts.

For the first time, Shelly felt happy to be loved and held so tightly.

Benjamin finally let go of Shelly after a long time.

When their eyes met, Benjamin said, “Shelly, I can’t promise you anything right now, but I’ll definitely work hard. I’ll earn money to support you and Bella in the future. I’ll treat you very, very well.”

Shelly nodded silently. Although she did not need Benjamin to support her, she was very happy that Benjamin wanted to do so.

As Benjamin’s hand caressed Shelly’s flushed cheeks and lifted her chin, Shelly closed her eyes, looking forward to the moment with the person she liked. Then, she felt Benjamin’s lips on hers, and their lips melted into each other’s.

While the two of them were kissing passionately, they did not notice that the elevator door behind them had suddenly opened, and Nox was standing inside.

He clearly wanted to make Shelly regret and take the initiative to look for him. However, the moment the nurse told him to leave the hospital, he could not help but come to look for Shelly in exasperation!

Why did that woman leave him at the hospital without saying a word? Was he so easily abandoned? The answer was yes! He was left behind and abandoned by Shelly!

Seeing them kissing and how Shelly was enjoying herself so much… He could not understand why she look disgusted when he kissed her but so happy when Benjamin kissed her.

In his mind, he screamed, ‘Damn it, Shelly! You forced me to do this! You f*cking forced me to do everything!’

Nox pressed the elevator button frantically, and the elevator closed. When it opened again on the first floor, he took out his phone and walked out while saying, “Make sure Benjamin loses everything!” After that, he abruptly hung up the phone.

The person who received the order was dumbfounded..
