Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What do you want to do?”

“I’m just reminding you that there’s no such thing as a secret in this world. The fact that you cheated on Nox behind his back will be exposed one day.” “Are you threatening me?” Zoe’s expression darkened.

“Can you not think of me as such a despicable person? I’m just trying to help you.”

“What do you mean?” Zoe frowned.

“What I mean is, if one day you’re exposed for cheating on Nox while you’re dating him, you’d better get evidence that Nox was also cheating on you.”

“Do you think Nox is still the same as he was before? Ever since he got together with me, he hasn’t had any improper relationships with other women.”

“That’s why I’m telling you to create evidence!”

“Can you just say what you want to say?” Zoe’s expression was grim.

“Alright, I’ll be straightforward.” Cody looked at Zoe. “You must’ve noticed Nox’s strange gaze when he looked at the waitress in our private room. Through careful observation, I noticed that the waitress is indeed good-looking and has an inexplicable innocence to her. In a place like a nightclub, she naturally stands out.”

“Is she that good-looking?” Zoe was naturally unhappy that the man was judging other women like that.

“Of course, her beauty is nothing like yours, ” Cody quickly added.

“Nothing a man says can be trusted.”

“Alright, don’t be jealous. Let’s get to the point.”

“Tell me.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Take this opportunity to let Nox sleep with the waitress. When the time comes, take a video of them sleeping together. Once you’re exposed, you can use this as an exchange and leverage with Nox.”

“Are you crazy? Why would I let my man sleep with someone else?” Zoe naturally could not accept it.

“Calm down and think about the benefits of doing this. Don’t forget that other than your relationship with Nox, your family still has to rely on Nox for support. If Nox really finds out that you cheated on him, won’t your family go bankrupt?” Cody said, “I also think that we should get along and I can give you some advice. ‘

“But you’re thinking of getting Nox to sleep with another woman—”

“Why? You’re allowed to be with other men, but Nox isn’t allowed to be with other women? Are you women so selfish?” Zoe pursed her lips.

In any case, she found it a little unacceptable.

“Actually, it’s no big deal for Nox to sleep with a waitress because he would never marry a waitress. Even if Nox slept with her, she wouldn’t threaten your status as the Winters’ eldest young mistress.”

“In that case, why don’t I find an ugly woman to sleep with Nox?”

“If the woman’s too ugly, what can you do with the video? If Nox insists he was drunk, what can you say then? Just find someone better-looking and make it hard for him to defend himself!”

Zoe was still hesitant about the idea.

“You have a good opportunity today. If you want me to get someone to get it for you immediately, there are a lot of drugs in the nightclub. But if you have enough confidence in yourself, do whatever you want. I’m just giving you advice from the perspective of an observer.” Cody did not force the idea on her.

“I’ll head out first.’

“Wait a minute,” Zoe suddenly called out to him.

Cody turned around.

“We’ll do as you say.” Zoe gritted her teeth.

She had to give herself some protection. If Nox really found out about her, she would be bankrupt, and she could not accept that result..
