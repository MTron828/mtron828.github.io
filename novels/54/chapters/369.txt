Chapter 370: The Accident Is Just the Start

“Put me on speaker.”

Monica did as she was told.

The call connected.

“Nox, it’s me–” Finn had just opened his mouth.

However, Nox quickly and anxiously interrupted him, “Finn, something happened to Fourth Master Swan overseas.”

Finn tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

“He said he took Jeanne out to sea, and the speedboat suddenly exploded. I’m rushing over now to check on the situation.”

“How’s Jeanne?!” Monica was so frightened that she was on the verge of breaking down.

“I’ll know when I see her.” Nox tried his best to remain calm. “Alright. I’m boarding the plane now. Wait for my news.”

Finn and Monica tacitly did not mention their current situation.

When the other party hung up the call, Monica’s hand that was holding the phone trembled.

Was Jeanne not overseas for her honeymoon? Why would something happen all of a sudden?

“Ah!” Monica suddenly hit her head on the side of the car.

......

Finn said, “Hold on to the handrail!”

Monica quickly grabbed the handrail.

Then, she looked at Finn and his unusually serious expression. She asked, “What should we do now– Ah! Be careful!”

Monica shouted when she saw the car in front of them suddenly dash toward them.

Just as they were about to collide, Finn suddenly stepped on the brakes and reversed backward.

The series of actions were surprisingly fast.

Monica watched as Finn reversed at an even faster speed than she was normally used to.

She was really, really afraid of death.

She did even dare to ask him what she should do!

She was afraid that if she disturbed Finn with his current speed and their current situation, they would really die in a car accident.

Finn held the steering wheel tightly while observing the back. Still, he did not slow down.

The car that he had shaken off was also moving toward them as they reversed.

Suddenly, Finn stepped on the brakes, turned the steering wheel sharply, and drove into an alley on the street.

The car behind, which had been stopped by another car, did not manage to drive in.

With that, Finn frantically stepped on the accelerator.

Now, they could only rely on themselves to shake off those people.

With something happening to Edward overseas, and now he was being chased by people… No matter how he looked at it, he believed that the two incidents were not as simple as they seemed.

As he drove out of the alley, he found a direction and sped up.

When Monica did not see the car chasing them anymore, she heaved a sigh of relief.

She said, “Should I call the police?”

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

He felt that the Sanders was involved in this matter.

To be able to attack the Swans so brazenly, no one else in Harken besides the Sanders could do it!

“Finn, be careful,” Monica warned loudly.

That was when they saw the black car again.

As if knowing their trajectory, the other party chose a shortcut and caught up with them in an instant.

Finn also noticed it, and he was almost certain that their car was currently under surveillance.

After all, there were so many traffic cameras in Harken. As long as somebody wanted to monitor them, going anywhere in the city was useless.

As a matter of fact, Finn was right.

Michael was sitting on the big monitor screen, watching Finn’s car driving crazily on the road.

He had to admit that the man was a bit of a bad*ss, and the latter’s ability to operate a vehicle really surprised him.

His eyes narrowed.

As he was about to give the order, an image of Monica suddenly flashed across the screen.

Seeing Monica sitting in the passenger seat with a pale face made him pause.

“Mr. Ross,” the person next to him called him respectfully. “Should we add more manpower? It doesn’t look like one car is enough to take Finn down.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Michael’s gaze turned solemn, and he said, “Add another three cars.”

“Yes.”

The people around him quickly gave the order.

In an instant, on top of the black car behind them, Finn could feel the threats coming from all directions.

As expected, his idea of driving the car out of the city to a place with fewer surveillance cameras was not a good way out. Once there were more people, it would be difficult for them to escape.

He gritted his teeth, for he knew those people were coming for him.

Therefore, he said, “Monica, get ready to jump out of the car.”

“What?!” Monica turned her head and looked at Finn in disbelief.

“Get ready to jump out of the car!” Finn ordered coldly.

Monica looked at Finn.

“Just like how you jumped out of Jeanne’s car last time.”

His attitude was cold, as if he did not want to say too much.

Monica gritted her teeth and stared at Finn.

“You will drag me down!” Finn enunciated each word.

Yes. In any case, she was just that useless. She already knew.

She said, “Alright. You decide when it’s appropriate, and I’ll jump right away.”

Even if her leg was broken, she would jump.

Finn was focusing all his attention on his surroundings, so he could not sense Monica’s emotions at that moment.

At an intersection, he instantly switched his direction.

However, a car rushed over, obviously wanting to crash into them.

Finn was quick to spin the car around in an instant and drove in another direction.

At the same time, Monica saw that in the direction Finn turned, another black car was also driving toward them. Moreover, it was coming at them at a very fast speed.

No matter how skilled Finn was, he could not avoid it.

Monica watched as the car got closer and closer to her.

This time… they would not be so lucky.

Finn would not be skilled enough to dodge it at that point. Even God could not do it.

She thought the thing she regretted most in her life was not having divorced Finn yet before she died.

She had yet to separate her name from Finn’s.

She watched helplessly as the car approached.

With a bang, the car was sent flying.
