Chapter 724: The Family of Three

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Edward seemed to be able to sense her sudden change in emotion.

There was no expression on her face, but he was able to capture all the signs in a minute.

At that moment, Edward raised her chin and made her look into his eyes.

Who would have thought that Fourth Master Swan, who made people afraid to approach him, had a pair of eyes that were like stars?

She initially thought that there was no longer any sparkle in his eyes — only numbness toward the cold world. Yet now, that pair of eyes was like a vast universe, filled with starlight.

Jeanne closed her eyes.

Slowly, a kiss landed on her lips.

The best way for the two of them to work out was... to not take their feelings for each other seriously.

However, other than that deep and tender kiss, Jeanne did not feel a single trace of lust from Edward. It was as if he only had love, affection, and deep fondness for her…

Sometimes, Edward would make her feel temporarily lost.

“Jeannie.” Edward’s lips moved from her lips to her ear.

He seemed to have a special liking for her ear. That man really had a kink.

“Don’t seduce me,” he said as if to remind her.

Jeanne was stunned.

Immediately after, the hands under the sheets seemed to move…

She always thought that men were instinctive, but it turned out women were too.

Edward was amused by Jeanne’s expression.

He seemed to laugh a lot in front of her, and when he laughed, he was charming and seductive.

That man... was hard to control.

Jeanne said, “I’m hungry.”

She changed the topic because she did not want to be in the same bed with that man anymore.

She was afraid... that she did not have enough willpower.

However, a certain someone did not reply to her for a long time. With that, Jeanne frowned and looked straight at Edward.

Looking at his face, it was clear... that there was a deeper meaning behind it.

“Edward, what are you thinking about?” Jeanne was flustered and exasperated.

In an instant, she knew what he was thinking about!

“What are you thinking about? I’m thinking about what I’m thinking about,” Edward replied.

“I’m not.”

“I’m not either.”

“If you’re not, why don’t you get up?” Jeanne got a little angry.

“I can’t bear to.”

Jeanne would always be tempted by Edward’s words. Sometimes, even a normal sentence could make her blush.

It was a very normal sentence, but it was the tone of his attractive voice that made her think of something else.

It made her… heart race.

She turned over, for she could not be seduced by Edward like that. As such, she lifted the blanket and was about to get off the bed.

Just as her toes touched the ground, a loud noise sounded, and Jeanne knelt on the ground weakly.

At that moment, she was stunned by the fall.

How could her legs be so weak?

As for the culprit, he simply supported himself with his arms as if he was very satisfied with his masterpiece.

He did not even have the intention to pull her up.

Jeanne raised her head and glared at Edward.

“You look so good even when you fall!” Edward commented.

Look good? F*ck you!

Jeanne got up from the ground and barely managed to stand up. She was about to go to the bathroom to wash up when a certain someone stretched out his long arm and hugged her slender waist.

Then, in the next second, she returned to his embrace and hugged her tightly.

‘Edward, you b*stard!’ Jeanne cursed.

“Sleep with me for a while more.”

“I’m hungry,” Jeanne said. The moment she said it, she was a little angry. “My tummy is growling.”

“I know,” Edward replied.

What the hell did he know? All he knew was to act like a pervert.

Edward hugged her in his arms and pressed his body tightly against hers.

Jeanne looked at Edward, who closed his eyes as if he was really sleeping.

Although she did not see the time, she knew from looking at the sky that it was late in the morning. How could he sleep with the sun already up?

“Last night... I didn’t sleep at all.” Someone seemed to have seen through her doubts.

“Are you trying to prove that you’re very good?” Jeanne retorted.

Edward simply closed his eyes and smiled.

“Jeannie, if you insist on saying that, I will also accept your compliment.”

How could someone be so shameless?

“I can’t bear to sleep,” Edward suddenly muttered in his magnetic voice.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

Sometimes, Edward’s simple words could make her heartbeat race.

He continued, “I was afraid that if I fell asleep, you wouldn’t be around anymore.”

Jeanne did not know how to reply to him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She always felt that with Edward’s strength, he already knew her identity.
