Chapter 73: First Day at the Lawrence Enterprise

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The next morning, Jeanne had a splitting headache.

She did not remember what she had experienced last night. When she woke up, she was in a complete breakdown.

Jeanne struggled to get up. She rubbed her aching temples and went to the bathroom to wash up.

It was her first day at the Lawrence Enterprise, so she could not be late.

She braced herself and washed up.

Her phone rang.

Jeanne had the habit of keeping her phone by her side at all times. At this moment, she looked at the incoming call on the screen and pressed the speakerphone.

“I heard that you were drunk last night.” It was Kingsley.

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

“You clearly know that your martial prowess is basically zero after drinking, let alone getting yourself drunk.” Kingsley was somewhat reprimanding her. “Without me by your side, do you not know how to take care of yourself? What if someone takes the opportunity to violate you?”

‘Violate…’

Jeanne’s hand that was brushing her teeth stopped for a moment.

Some bad scenes from last night suddenly appeared in her mind.

‘Damn it.’

Her hand that was brushing her teeth tightened again.

“Why aren’t you talking?”

“I’m brushing my teeth.” Jeanne’s words were a little unclear.

“Don’t drink anymore in the future. Do you hear me? If you want to drink, you can only do it in front of me, understand?” Kingsley was very serious.

“Okay,” Jeanne replied.

“You’re going to the Lawrence Enterprise to work today?” Kingsley saw that Jeanne had agreed and then got to the point.

“Yes.”

“Is half a year enough?”

“It’s enough,” Jeanne answered casually.

“You’re not bargaining with me?”

“You’re already showing the Lawrences favor by giving them half a year,” Jeanne said sarcastically. “If everything goes as expected, three months will be enough.”

“So, was your mom blind back then?” Kingsley asked seriously.

“The dead are dead, so be kind.”

Kingsley did not say anything else. He reminded her, “Don’t force yourself. If anything happens, look for me.”

“There’s just one thing that I need your help with.” Jeanne finished rinsing her mouth and washing her face.

“What is it?”

“It’s Mubier. He came to South Hampton City.” Jeanne wiped her face. “I don’t want to see him.”

“Actually, I think that he’s not bad. Although his aptitude is a little bad, it’s good that he’s devoted and obsessed with you...”

“Are you sure you’ll allow me to fall in love?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

“Mubier will disappear from South Hampton City soon.”

Jeanne smiled.

She hung up the phone and walked out of the bathroom. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

George was rather lazy. He usually slept until he woke up naturally in the morning. Nonetheless, Jeanne had no choice but to wake him up for school today.

He rubbed his eyes in a daze. Jeanne kissed his forehead. “Be good. It’s the first day of school today.”

George forced himself to get up and staggered to the bathroom.

Jeanne put on some simple makeup and changed into a white slim-fit professional shirt with a nude-colored skirt and a pair of white high heels. She tied her hair into a neat ponytail and looked very professional. Even so, it still could not hide her sexiness.

She was ready, and so was George.

Jeanne held George’s hand as they went downstairs. Breakfast was prepared downstairs.

At this moment, Alexander, Jenifer, and Joshua were having their breakfast. Jeanne brought George over as well.

Everyone sat at the same table and ate their breakfast.

Jeanne said, “George needs a designated driver.”

Alexander looked up at Jeanne.

“Once I go to work, I won’t have time to pick up George.”

“Okay,” Alexander replied.

Jenifer hurriedly said, “Don’t worry. I’ll get the driver to pick up George. You can just go to work at ease.”

Jeanne glanced at Jenifer and faintly said, “Thank you.”

After eating breakfast, Jeanne sent George into the private car. After giving him a few reminders, she followed Alexander and got into Alexander’s private car with Joshua.

In the car, Alexander said coldly, “Don’t think that just because you’re my daughter, you can go to the company and do whatever you want. You’re a newcomer. Although your grandfather asked me to arrange a high position for you, it doesn’t mean that you can do whatever you want.”

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed indifferently.

Along the way, Alexander kept lecturing, and he made himself sound like he was in a very high position.

They arrived at the Lawrence Enterprise.

Before Alexander got out of the car, he instructed Jeanne, “After Joshua and I leave, you can get out of the car. I don’t want others to misunderstand! In the company, I’ve always treated everyone equally.”

Jeanne sneered.

‘So there’s no misunderstanding if he leaves with Joshua? He treats everyone equally?’

She still nodded.

Alexander and Joshua walked for quite a while before Jeanne got out of the car and walked into the Lawrence Enterprise.

She first went to the human resources department to report herself. Then, under the arrangements of the department, she went to her office as the marketing director of the Lawrence Enterprise.

Joshua was the deputy director and had always been. The previous director had been temporarily sent to another branch office yesterday to be the general manager.

Jeanne sat in her seat.

The door was knocked and opened. “Director, hello, I’m your secretary. My name is Amy.”

Jeanne nodded slightly.

“In the future, if you need anything, just tell me. I’ll try my best to fulfill your request.”

“In ten minutes, call everyone above the department head for a meeting.” Some people’s imposing manner would be revealed as soon as they spoke.

Jeanne was one of them.

“Understood.” The secretary was extremely respectful.

“While you’re at it, help me make a cup of coffee without sugar.”

“Got it.”

The secretary left.

Jeanne turned on her computer and went on the company’s intranet to familiarize herself with the internal culture of the Lawrence Enterprise.

After a while, the secretary placed a cup of coffee in front of Jeanne and reported, “I’ve gathered everyone above the department head to wait for you in the marketing department’s meeting room.”

“Alright.”

Jeanne took a sip of the coffee and stood up to walk toward the meeting room.

The meeting room was a little noisy. When everyone saw Jeanne appear, they quickly shut their mouths.

In fact, it was not strange for everyone to be curious.

In one night, their leader had changed just like that.

Jeanne sat in the middle and looked at the dozen people below. She asked casually, “Where’s the deputy director?”

“He went to attend the general manager’s meeting,” the secretary said quickly.

So, Joshua went to attend a meeting between the higher-ups, but Jeanne was not informed.

Jeanne did not care. She said to everyone calmly, “Hello Eeveryone, I’m Jeanne Lawrence, the new director of the marketing department. I’ve gathered everyone for a meeting today to get to know each other. We’ll be working together a lot in the future. I hope you’ll support me.”

Everyone looked at the young director. They were still a little surprised when they saw the aura that she emitted.

The previous director was over 40 years old. Although the deputy director was only 23 years old, everyone knew he was not in charge of anything.

“I won’t take up too much of your time. I’ll use 20 minutes to give you a short meeting and give you a few tasks.” Jeanne was calm and serious. It was hard to tell that she was young and inexperienced. “Firstly, since this was sudden, the previous director and I didn’t have a detailed handover of work, so I need everyone present to sort out some of the work on your hands and report to me. I need to know all the current work of the marketing department, as well as the next plan. Before getting off work this afternoon, all the supervisors will report to me.”

“Understood,” the supervisors quickly responded in unison.

“Secondly, I need a detailed list of the people in the marketing department. The list includes the specific duties of the people, the time they’ve been in the company, and their results of the past three years,” Jeanne instructed. “Amy will provide this to me.”

“Yes, Director,” the secretary quickly responded.

“Thirdly—”

Someone suddenly knocked on the door.

Everyone turned their heads.

An employee said, “Director Lawrence, you were asked to go to the general manager’s meeting room.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

At first, she was not asked to go. Now, she was called halfway... They must be hiding evil intentions!
