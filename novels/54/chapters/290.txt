Chapter 291: George Is “Abused”, and Jeanne Returns

“Pow!” A slap landed directly on Lucy’s face.

Lucy pursed her lips.

Her face was instantly swollen.

Even so, pain was something that people like her were used to.

So she did not feel anything.

Lucy just accepted Kingsley’s outburst of anger.

“It’s reasonable?! That’s not something you should say!” Kingsley lectured her.

“Understood,” Lucy replied respectfully.

Kingsley picked up his phone and dialed.

Jeanne had run out of the airport and taken the airport patrol car.

She looked at the incoming call and gritted her teeth as she answered it.

“Jeanne, come back!” Kingsley’s angry voice was heard.

“I’ll bring George back with me!”

“Come back now!”

“I’ll bring George back with me!” Jeanne’s temper was also very bad.

In this world, Jeanne was probably the only one who could do whatever she wanted in front of Kingsley.

“I’ll ask you one more time—are you really going back?”

“Yes.” Jeanne was resolute and decisive.

Regarding George’s matter, there was no need to hesitate.

She had only compromised with Kingsley just now because she knew she could not resist.

Once she could resist...

She would not be threatened by anyone.

“Alright,” Kingsley said coldly, “You better take care of yourself in the future!”

The moment he finished, he hung up the phone.

Afterward, he ordered the captain, “Take off.”

The captain was stunned.

Lucy also looked at Kingsley.

In the end, no one dared to say anything.

No one dared to interrupt him while he was raging.

The plane glided again.

Then, it took off and left.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly. She watched as the plane in the distance left. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

There were some indescribable emotions in her heart.

She knew that she had disappointed Kingsley.

Nevertheless, she did not regret it.

Moreover, she had thought it through very clearly.

Once she rescued George from Fourth Master Swan, she would take George with her and leave.

They would leave South Hampton City together. They would follow Kingsley’s instructions and never come back.

With this thought in mind, the guilt in Jeanne’s heart eased slightly.

At this moment, the patrol car had returned to the airport hall.

Jeanne got out of the car and left the airport quickly without hesitation.

…

Bamboo Garden.

George sat on the sofa in the hall. He was neither crying nor laughing, and he did not say a word.

He was probably in a bad mood because he had been set up.

Nox had done all he could but was still unable to persuade George to have lunch.

He was on the verge of a breakdown.

He was the great young master of the Winters. Was he here to serve a child?!

When he was about to explode, Edward came down from upstairs.

Nox could not take it anymore. He said to Edward, “You brought him back. Why did you leave him to me?!”

Edward took a look at Nox and then at George.

He said, “George.”

George turned to look at Edward.

“Come over for lunch.” His voice was very low.

He neither threatened nor bribed George. It was just a simple order.

George followed him.

‘F*ck.’

Nox was furious.

George simply treated him lightly.

In the dining room.

Edward was sitting at the dining table.

George also obediently sat next to Fourth Master Swan.

Nox sat down angrily.

He thought about the things he had never said in his entire life. They were simply nonsense.

He picked up his cutleries and started eating, ignoring the others.

Edward was used to Nox’s temper.

He said to George, “Eat.”

George did not start eating.

“Didn’t your mom tell you that the most important thing at any time is to ensure your health?” Edward started eating slowly.

His movements were quite elegant.

George took a look at Edward. Next, he picked up his cutleries and began to eat silently.

The dining table was very quiet.

Teddy was waiting at the side.

He did not really understand. It was Ms. Lawrence who was previously here. Why was George here instead at this moment?

‘Forget it. I better not ask.

‘If I know too much, I’ll be chased away again.’

“My informant called just now and said that the plane has taken off,” Nox said as he ate.

Edward, who was eating elegantly, had a stiff look on his face for a second.

Nox said to George mischievously, “Your mom really left you behind.”

George glanced at Nox.

He ignored Nox.

He felt that Nox was very childish.

Nox looked at George’s expression and felt that the kid was looking at him as if he was an idiot.
