1284 Edward Attends a Charity Banquet

It also cost a lot of money.

Therefore, Nox was a classic example of pot calling the kettle black.

The charity auction was coming to an end.

Usually, the final product would be the highlight of the night. Sometimes, it would even be so intense that blood would spill on scene.

“The last item to be auctioned is a jade bracelet. I won’t go back too much to the luster of the bracelet and its long history, lest everyone thinks that I’m exaggerating. I’ll just tell them the origin of this jade bracelet,” the host said excitedly. “This bracelet was donated for free by our leader. The bracelet was left behind by his mother-in-law, and it has been passed down from generation to generation. To put it bluntly, this is the Chief’s family heirloom. Now that the Chief has donated it for free to support our charity, I once again thank you on behalf of charity.”

With that, there was another round of applause.

Monica stared straight at the bracelet that the staff was carefully displaying.

At first glance, Monica felt that it was a little familiar.

Now that the host had mentioned it, she was completely certain that Jeanne had worn this bracelet before.

She remembered that Edward married Jeanne in ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown, with a 25-foot train and a 153 yards tulle veil. She had put on the phoenix coronet and ceremonial robe and the family bracelet for her. Now, things had really changed.

She looked at the host in front of her as the host spoke with saliva spitting out of her mouth everywhere.

After a long time, the bidding began. “The starting bid is five million. Each increase is a hundred thousand. Let the bidding begin!”

“Six million.”

“Seven million.”

“Ten million.”

“Eleven million.”

“Fifteen million.”

The auction was incomparably intense.

One had to know that bidding for this bracelet was not only to support charity, but also to promote the company and curry favor with the Chief of Harken.

“Twenty-five million.” The price had already been raised five times.

However, everyone present was still excited.

“Thirty million.” A female spoke suddenly.

Everyone turned to look at Candice.

Unexpectedly, the organizer, Candice, also joined the auction.

However, the moment she opened her mouth, everyone turned silent.

They were probably a little shocked, besides showing her some respect.

After all, they had to give Minister Nicholson face.

“Forty million.” Monica suddenly raised her card.

Beside him, Nox’s eyes widened.

How could such a lousy bracelet be so popular?!

It could not be that popular right?

However, Monica did not want any other woman to wear something that belonged to Jeanne.

She called out her bid.

Obviously, it put Candice in a difficult position.

No matter what, Minister Nicholson was in politics. It was said that she also had some business activities, but in order to avoid suspicion, she definitely did not dare to spend money recklessly. Thirty million was the limit for her. If she called the bid higher, it would really be too ostentatious.

Silence ensued.

It was obvious that Candice had given up.

The host seemed to have just finally reacted. He quickly said, “Forty million going once, twice…”

“Fifty million.” A deep male voice suddenly resounded beside her.

Monica turned to look at Edward.

To be honest, from the moment the bracelet was displayed, all her good impression of him was gone—something Monica had no choice but to admit. Now, his actions made her feel a little puzzled.

Edward shocked everyone.

The host asked with a trembling voice, “Chief, are you bidding?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Mm,” Edward replied.

He was not joking.

As soon as Edward spoke, the others naturally did not dare to say at all.

The host did not even want to close the bid. He instead wanted to just sell off the bracelet.

“Sixty million.” Monica suddenly raised her hand again.

“Seventy million.”

“Eighty million.”

“Ninety…” Nox grabbed Monica.

His heart was about to burst.

Monica actually dared to go against Fourth Master Swan so brazenly.

One had to know that he was a fearless person but he did not dare to be disrespectful to Fourth Master Swan in front of outsiders. Did this woman really want to die?!

...

Did she know that accompanying one’s sovereign is likened to accompanying a tiger?!

Monica looked at Nox coldly.

Looking at Nox’s actions, the host hurriedly said, “Eighty million going once, going twice, going thrice. Sold!”

His mouth was really shockingly fast.

He was afraid that something would happen again.

Monica was speechless.

She put down the bid and looked a little uncomfortable.

She was just unhappy that Edward had put Jeanne’s things up for auction.

She had a feeling that if there was a first time, there would definitely be a second time. There would definitely be countless more times!

She could not accept that Jeanne had been abandoned by Edward!
