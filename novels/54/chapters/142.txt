Chapter 143: A Direct Counterattack Against the Lawrence Enterprise’s Higher-ups

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Alexander’s expression was also extremely ugly.

He was initially showing off because of Jeanne, but now he could not say a single word because of her.

Bryce added, “President Lawrence, this matter can not be allowed to pass just like this. Jeanne is not sensible, but it doesn’t mean that the senior executives of our company are also not sensible. Although the Sanders seems to be very friendly now, in fact, no one knows what attitude they will have towards our company in the future. The Sanders are in charge of Harken, so what right does our company have to offend them?”

“DIrector Hoffman, if you have something to say, just say it,” Alexander said coldly.

“Then I’ll say it directly.” Bryce stood up from his seat, looking even more imposing, “I think the most important thing for us now is to get the Sanders’s forgiveness. No matter what their attitude toward us is, we have to take the initiative to express our goodwill to them. We have to apologize for our irrational behavior this time. At the very least, we can let the Sanders feel our sincerity and try our best to mitigate the possibility that the Sanders is deliberately targeting us.”

“So, what’s your suggestion?” Alexander raised his eyebrows.

“It’s very simple. There’s a reason for everything. Whoever caused the trouble should be responsible. This matter was caused by Jeanne, and Jeanne should take full responsibility. So I think that we should fire Jeanne to give the Sanders an explanation.”

Jeanne’s eyes turned colder.

Alexander’s expression also changed slightly.

Joshua was at the side, smiling very insidiously.

“Director Hoffman,” Jeanne said.

When it was quiet, or when everyone thought that Bryce’s suggestion was very good, she took the initiative to speak up.

Bryce glanced at Jeanne. “Are you still going to defend yourself?”

“I’m not going to defend myself,” Jeanne replied with a firm tone.

“It’s best if you don’t defend yourself. We’re all people with status. Once we shed all pretenses and start saying what we want to, this wouldn’t look good.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I’m just telling Director Hoffman not to jump to conclusions before the matter is over. Don’t be too proactive either, or you’ll be easily slapped in the face.”

“What do you mean by jumping to conclusions yet? Do you really think that the Sanders will help you solve your current difficulties? It’s just an excuse from them! Based on my many years of experience in the business world, I’m telling you clearly that the current logistics warehouse project of Lawrence Enterprise is finished. The investment has gone down the drain and we have lost more than a billion dollars. You have even offended the Sanders. In the future, the Lawrences will not be able to develop. As the party involved, you have caused so much trouble for us. If it weren’t for the fact that you are a member of Lawrence, do you really think that it would be as simple as being chased out of the Lawrence Enterprise?” Bryce said with extreme anger.

Jeanne looked at him but did not move.

Her indifference agitated Bryce further.

He said fiercely, “In any case, the Lawrence Enterprise will either have her or me. I can’t accept the fact that the Lawrence Enterprise is being led around by a little girl! This is simply an insult to me!”

Bryce’s anger also provoked fierce resistance from the other higher-ups.

Everyone at the scene stood on Bryce’s side and even forced Alexander to immediately give the order for Jeanne to leave the Lawrence Enterprise.

Alexander was forced into a corner by everyone.

After all, Jeanne was his daughter, and he was embarrassed.

He gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, and said, “Everyone, be quiet!”

Only then did everyone quieten down a little.

“Jeanne did indeed have a huge problem with this incident...”

Herself.

Therefore, Alexander had also distanced himself from the relationship.

“I agree with the opinions of all the higher-ups and have decided to expel Jeanne...”

Before he could finish his sentence, the door of the executive meeting room was pushed open.

Everyone turned their heads and saw Jonathan Lawrence appear in the meeting room all of a sudden.

He was sitting in a wheelchair, but he still looked energetic and sharp.

At that moment, the office was silent.

The next second, everyone in the meeting room stood up and said respectfully to Jonathan, “Chairman.”

Jonathan did not look at anyone. He only let his personal assistant push him toward Alexander.

Alexander quickly gave up his seat.

“All of you, sit down,” Jonathan instructed.

Only then did everyone sit down.

Due to Jonathan’s authoritative demeanor, no one took the initiative to speak.

Jonathan swept a glance at everyone and said, “Jeanne, come over to grandpa’s side.”

Jeanne was originally standing, but when she heard Jonathan’s words, she walked over to his side.
