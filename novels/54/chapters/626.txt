Chapter 627: The Identity of Jeanne’s Mother Exposed, Alexander’s Tragic Ending

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the detention center, Jeanne looked coldly at Alexander, who spoke of her mother’s past with incomparable grief.

Of course, Alexander was not grieving for her mother. He was only grieving for himself, for what he went through and what he was about to face.

He said, “Your mother was only after the Lawrences’ wealth. She didn’t like me at all!”

“Is that so?” A trace of cruelty was revealed in Jeanne’s cold eyes.

Her mother did not care about that little wealth the Lawrences had!

“After we got married, your mother and I only slept together once! Now that I think about it...” Alexander gritted his teeth as if it was a great humiliation. However, he could not hide it anymore as he said fiercely, “Other than the wedding night, your mother never let me touch her again! I also have my pride as a man. Since your mother didn’t let me touch her, I had many women waiting for me out there. That was why I had an affair with Jenifer! Jeanne, if I had an affair, your mother was responsible for me cheating!”

Jeanne pursed her lips tightly.

To think he already had an affair when her mother was still pregnant, he was probably too impatient!

She looked at Alexander, who looked like he was still angry. “I wanted to be with your mother back then. It was your mother who pushed me away time and time again, and it was only then that I realized how good Jenifer was to me. It was only then that my feelings for your mother became weaker and weaker. On top of that, your mother started to rely on her status as the young mistress in the company to climb to the top. She tried to take over the entire Lawrence Enterprise. It was her ambition that killed her! Jeanne, your mother’s death was her fault. No one can be blamed for it. She overestimated herself!”

Jeanne sneered, “It’s all her fault for helping you guys develop Lawrence Enterprise.”

It was all because she was gaining more power.

Yet, it was her fault.

“I admit that if it weren’t for your mother, Lawrence Enterprise might have declined like the other family businesses. But even so, even if your mother contributed to the company, she didn’t have the power to take away what belongs to our family!”

“My mother never wanted what belongs to the Lawrences!” Otherwise, it would not take her so many years to do it. Other than the control of the Lawrences, she did not have any of the Lawrences’ shares.

It was because of Alexander and Jonathan’s incompetence and jealousy that led to her mother’s tragic outcome!

Jeanne’s eyes were bloodshot.

She was forcing herself to suppress her emotions so that she would not lose control and kill Alexander.

“If she didn’t want what belonged to the family, why did she marry me? If she didn’t like me, why did she marry me? She even knew about my relationship with Jenifer, but she was indifferent about it! Jeanne, tell me. Why did your mother get together with me?” Alexander was getting very emotional.

Maybe back then, Alexander did like his mother. Yet, he could still bring himself to kill her.

Jeanne looked at Alexander and did not tell him that her mother only wanted to live a different life and stay alive.

Instead, she said, “So you and my grandfather killed my mother because she threatened your interests? That was why you wanted to kill her?”

“It wasn’t me.” Alexander denied it. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

It seemed he still knew how to defend himself at a time like that.

He said, “It was all your grandfather’s doing. It was all his doing. Even though your mother’s cold attitude towards me all those years back and her performance in the company humiliated me, I didn’t intend to kill your mother. It was your grandfather who felt that your mother threatened his power in the Lawrences. That was why he wanted to kill her. He arranged for your mother to attend a dinner party and deliberately messed with the brakes on her car. Then, he arranged for a car to kill your mother. It wasn’t me, Jeanne. It really wasn’t!”

Alexander kept on explaining himself

However, Jeanne looked at him coldly.

If it was not him, how did he know all the details?

In fact, it was not important anymore.

She had heard a lot about what had happened back then to her mother from Kingsley. Now, she just wanted confirmation from Alexander.

She admitted that she was afraid Kingsley would lie to her — that he was just using her.

“Jeanne, your grandfather killed your mother. He was the murderer. Now that I killed your grandfather, if you see it from another perspective, I have avenged your mother. You should be grateful to me for finally killing the culprit that killed your mother.” Alexander looked at Jeanne, his face was filled with anticipation. He said anxiously, “Please help me. I don’t want to be shot to death.”
