Chapter 500: Father and Son “Reunited”

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Did you pursue me only because I gave birth to your son?” Jeanne asked.

“I must admit I’m more than happy with this son of mine,” Edward said bluntly.

Jeanne pursed her lips, clearly unhappy about it.

Fourth Master Swan had already told her that he had taken a liking to her son.

If it were not because of George, he probably would not be so persistent in wanting to be together with her.

After all, no one wanted their son to call someone else ‘father’.

“But that is not the reason why I pursued you. I pursued you because I have liked you for many years.” Edward repeated.

“You’ve liked me for many years, but weren’t Eden and I dating back then?” Jeanne retorted.

In the end, it was because she had given birth to his child that he was so determined to marry her.

“It makes me think that if nothing happened between Eden and me back then, would you have quietly watched me and Eden get married and have children...”

“Maybe,” Edward muttered.

“So you’re only with me because of George,” Jeanne concluded.

It did not matter whether Edward liked her or not.

......

No matter what reason he had to suppress his feelings for her, the result was that if it were not for George, Edward would not have pursued her.

“No, it’s because you’ve slept with me.” Edward made sure to enunciate his words.

Jeanne was stunned.

“I don’t deny it. If nothing happened between you and Eden that year, I wouldn’t have taken the initiative to approach you. I would have watched you get married and... watch you live your life together.” He did not mention “having children”, which showed that he was bothered by it.

He continued, “But after you slept with me, I didn’t want you to be someone else’s woman anymore.”

“My skills aren’t that good either. How did I manage to capture your heart?” Jeanne asked him seriously.

Back then, she did not even know what to do. All she knew how to do was to hug him, so how could he not get her out of his mind?

“If your skills aren’t good, you can learn.” Edward smiled.

That sudden smile made Jeanne feel... a lingering fear.

She looked at him with a guarded expression and could see the excitement in his eyes.

They were on a serious topic. What was that fellow thinking now?

She just watched as he approached her and pressed her under his body. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Could he be any more shameless?

She pushed against his body. “I’m talking about serious business.”

“I’m also doing serious business.”

“Edward!”

“To make up for last night.”

“I haven’t taken a shower yet.”

“I don’t mind.”

“I do.”

“No, you don’t mind.”

“...”

The atmosphere in the room became steamy. In a split second, everything exploded!

In a different mansion in the Swan family’s manor, Purple Pavilion Garden, the deadly atmosphere was the opposite of the steamy atmosphere over there!

Eden lay on his bed with an unsightly expression, still filled with anger.

He could not believe that that b*tch, Jasmine, cheated on him. Thinking about what Jasmine and the other man had done, he really wanted to kill that b*tch with his own hands. However, even now that he was angry, all he thought about was Jeanne.

He could not get that woman, who had never made his life easy, out of his mind.

He was even imagining what that woman looked like under his Fourth Uncle. Was she overbearing and aloof, or was she soft like a pool of warm water…

At that thought, his expression turned grim. He clenched his fists tightly, and the veins on his face bulged.

He must get his hands on Jeanne and make her his!

Hence, he gritted his teeth as he tried his best to control his emotions.

He knew full well that now was not the time to be angry at himself. He had to think of a way to get back on his feet.

He could not be put down like that.

In the future, the entire Swans had to be his!

He had never had such a strong desire to take over the family back then, or perhaps it was not that he did not have it. He knew he was not as capable as his Fourth Uncle, so he would accept whatever his Fourth Uncle gave him. Yet now, he could no longer accept it because Jeanne had caused him to suffer all kinds of humiliation. She had trampled on his dignity as a man, and he had to rely on himself to reclaim his dignity.

He had to do everything he could to get it back!

With that, he picked up the phone, and while suppressing his emotions, he dialed a number.

The call went through. “Eden.”

“Michael, I’m in a bit of trouble.”

“Huh?” The person on the other end of the phone frowned.
