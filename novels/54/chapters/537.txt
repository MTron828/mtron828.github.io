Chapter 538: We Really Got A Divorce

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Once Finn was ready, he walked out of the bedroom.

Monica paused for two seconds before she followed behind him with her crutches.

The two of them walked out of the house together, entered the elevator, and went to the underground garage.

From the start to the end, Finn did not say another word. He was so indifferent to Monica that she had nothing to say.

In fact, Monica cried the entire night yesterday.

Especially at the thought of how Finn had put his ego down and begged her not to leave, she could not help but cry. She thought she could talk to him and comfort him today, but Finn’s coldness made it hard for her to speak.

Every time she had a conflict with Finn, she seemed to be the one struggling and suffering. Finn, on the other end, could make it seem like nothing happened after the night.

Monica bit her lip.

Seeing that Finn could regulate his emotions so quickly, there was no need for her to dwell on it and make herself feel worse anymore.

At the garage, Michael was waiting for them in a car.

Finn walked over without any expression.

As Michael’s chauffeur opened the car door for Finn and Monica, Finn sat in it, and Monica followed.

The two of them sat in the back seat while Michael sat in the passenger seat.

After that, the car drove to the civil affairs bureau.

It was still early, but the workers in South Hampton City had already started to go to work, and the number of cars on the street was gradually increasing.

In the car, it was extremely quiet.

Finn’s eyes were fixed on the street outside the car, and the same with Monica’s. Occasionally, she would turn her head to look at Finn, but she saw the back of his cold head every time.

Michael was also tactful, knowing not to speak, so the car moved quietly on the street.

Suddenly, Monica’s phone rang.

Monica took a glance at the incoming call and pursed her lips before answering the call. “Jeannie–”

“Where are you?” Jeanne’s tone was a little harsh.

Monica’s eyes moved slightly. “In the car.”

‘On the way to get a divorce.’

“What’s going on between you and Michael?” Jeanne went straight to the point.

“It’s just...” Monica looked at Michael in the front row and then at Finn beside her. She said, “Why are you asking me that?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I saw the news.” Jeanne got up and went to the bathroom.

Out of habit, she read the news on her phone as she sat on the toilet. That was when she saw Monica and Michael’s news in the headline about Monica accompanying Michael when he was discharged from the hospital and taking good care of him at his home after.

The news also said that the two of them were suspected to be in an official relationship since Monica and Finn’s marriage had ended long ago.

When she saw the news, she was a little surprised.

She had always thought that no matter how heartless Monica was, she would not be so inconsiderate.

“News?” Monica was stunned.

What news?

Oh. Was it the news about Michael being surrounded by reporters and her helping Michael out when he was discharged from the hospital yesterday?

She, too, was a little surprised.

She thought it would have been out yesterday, but unexpectedly, it was only out today.

Whatever.

It did not matter when it came out because the result would be the same anyway, and she did not want to explain anymore.

She said, “I plan to divorce Finn.”

One sentence was enough to make Jeanne on the other end of the call choke.

It took her quite a while to calm herself down and say, “Have you thought it through?”

“I have thought it through very clearly.” Monica, on the contrary, was calm. “Right now, Michael needs me the most. I can’t just ignore him.”

“There should be a limit to your sympathy.” Jeanne’s voice was a little loud as she was angered by Monica’s actions.

“I know what I’m doing.”

“Do you like Michael or Finn?” Jeanne asked.

Monica bit her lip and turned to look at Finn, whose cold back was facing her.

She did not answer.

“It’s Finn, right?” Jeanne knew it.

“Yes.” Monica nodded.

“Since it’s him, don’t divorce him. I also know a little about Michael’s situation. Indeed, his current situation isn’t great, but it has nothing to do with you. This is the result of a political struggle. You can’t sacrifice your happiness for him!”

Monica bit her lips.

She was not sacrificing her happiness. She just thought that she could get it back after she helped Michael.
