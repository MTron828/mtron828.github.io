In Harken, dawn had just broken in Bamboo Garden when Jeanne was woken up by her phone ringing.

Jeanne picked up her phone and looked at Kingsley’s call. She picked it up. “Hello.”

“Lucy is dead,” Kingsley said.

His tone sounded neither sad nor indifferent.

Jeanne held the phone tightly. She was shocked.

“Fourth Master Swan killed her,” Kingsley added.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly. She was silent, and her vision was blurry.

“I received news yesterday that Fourth Master Swan had a gun deal with an underground organization led by Locke. The location was in a remote area near the border of Harken. The Sanders wanted us to follow Fourth Master Swan to see if he was up to something else, so Lucy went,” Kingsley explained why Edward killed Lucy.

“Did Lucy discover anything?” Jeanne held herself together and asked.

“She discovered the existence of the Duncans’ descendant,” Kingsley said straightforwardly.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Kingsley said, “The Sanders have been investigating the whereabouts of the Duncans’ descendants, and some time ago, they found some clues. They found that the personal butler of the former head of the Duncans was being protected by some unknown forces. But after a thorough investigation, they found that those forces were not protecting the butler but someone else. With that information, they speculated that this person should be a descendant of the Duncans. However, because they had alerted the enemy before the Sanders could take any action, those people suddenly disappeared right under the Sanders’ nose without leaving any traces behind! However, we can be 100 percent sure now that the descendants of the Duncans do exist.”

Jeanne maintained her silence, silently listening to Kingsley recount the incident to her.

“The Sanders are sure that this person exists. The Duncans’ descendant must have known that their identity was exposed, so they had to hide it again and even choose to fight back. And at this time, Fourth Master Swan suddenly went to the border. It’s definitely not a coincidence, so the Sanders told us to follow Fourth Master Swan to see if he was playing any tricks.” Kingsley’s tone had always been very cold when he was calmly explaining something. “Before Lucy died, she reported to me that Fourth Master Swan’s deal had failed. The other party suddenly broke the deal, and Fourth Master Swan and Nox escaped. After that, Fourth Master Swan and Nox parted ways, with Nox luring everyone away. That was when Lucy discovered that something was wrong, so she chased after Fourth Master Swan and discovered that Fourth Master Swan, who had disappeared, had an additional person by his side. If I’m not wrong, that person is the Duncans’ only descendant.”

“I told Lucy to think of a way to get a clear look at that person’s appearance. For so long, everyone only knew the existence of that person but not who that person was. Once we had a clear look at that person’s face, it would be much easier to find that person.” Kingsley continued, “Lucy carried out my orders and went to fight Fourth Master Swan and that person. In the end... the news of her death came.”

Jeanne held her phone tightly, and her hand was trembling.

That meant Edward killed her teacher.

“I’ve fought with Fourth Master Swan before. Although he was injured at that time, I know the level of his skills. Lucy may not have been able to beat him, but with Lucy’s skills, injuring him shouldn’t be difficult. Moreover, Lucy was smarter than all the assassins under me. Before she died, she would definitely have left a clue for us to find that person. I’m guessing there must be traces of injuries on that person’s body.” Kingsley analyzed, saying, “Fourth Master Swan has spent so much effort to hide the fact that he took away the Duncans’ descendants. Based on my personal analysis, he will bring them back to South Hampton City without anyone noticing. The so-called most dangerous place is the safest place. On top of that, the Swans are currently very powerful, so the Sanders dare not touch them so easily. Furthermore, I suspect that the Duncans’ descendant is getting impatient. They will return to South Hampton City and seize back the Duncans’ power. This is what will happen next, and what we need to do now is to kill the Duncans’ descendant before anything happens.”

“So, you want me to find this person and kill them?” Jeanne understood what he meant.

Kingsley did not deny it. He said, “Right now, my assassins at the border have been completely annihilated. News about Fourth Master Swan stopped the moment Lucy died, and I have lost traces of Fourth Master Swan’s group. Even if I were to send people over again, there would be nothing I could do with Fourth Master Swan’s strength. We’ve failed our mission this time by letting the Duncans’ descendant go without doing anything. We didn’t even get any useful clues, and for that, we have to bear the responsibility. At the moment, you’re the only one who is closest to Fourth Master Swan, so you are the best person to probe the people around him.”
