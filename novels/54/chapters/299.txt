Chapter 300: Jeanne Stays, and Fourth Master Swan Confesses

“I thought that you wouldn’t suffer from insomnia like me, Ms. Lawrence.” Edward picked up a dry towel at the side and dried his slightly long hair.

Edward’s hair was usually slicked back.

It looked very imposing.

Once it was wet, his hair would naturally fall on his forehead. It looked less aggressive, but he seemed to be more handsome.

Jeanne’s eyes turned slightly.

Edward did not wait for Jeanne’s reply.

He walked toward the hall by himself.

Jeanne watched him leave.

She had a feeling that she could not understand this man.

She would never know what his point was.

She would never know why he made her stay for a week.

Was it to... spend a few more days with George?!

After all, Fourth Master Swan had spent all his energy on George these few days even though it was a little... ‘brutal’.

Jeanne’s heart moved.

There were some things that they would never talk about even if they knew very well.

Jeanne sat by the pool for quite a while before she got up and returned to the hall.

In the hall, the lights were very bright.

She watched from afar as the Fourth Master Swan sat at the bar counter in a corner of the hall, drinking.

The smell of alcohol was very strong.

Even from so far away, Jeanne seemed to have smelled it.

She did not have much emotion and directly walked upstairs.

“Ms. Lawrence,” Fourth Master Swan suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne paused.

“Let’s drink together.” He was inviting her.

Jeanne did not have a good tolerance for alcohol.

Most of the time, she would even get drunk as soon as she drank.

In front of outsiders, she rarely drank.

At this moment, she still went over.

Jeanne went over and sat on the bar seat opposite Fourth Master Swan.

She did not know how much Fourth Master Swan had drunk.

The smell of alcohol on him was very strong, but he did not look drunk at all.

Fourth Master Swan poured half a cup of alcohol for Jeanne.

Jeanne took it and drank a mouthful of it.

It tasted really good.

Even though Jeanne could not hold her liquor well, she was still good at tasting wine.

“Fourth Master, why did you suddenly think of drinking alone?” Jeanne asked casually.

She felt that it would be a little awkward if it was just two of them

Due to Fourth Master Swan’s performance these few days, or more accurately, his lack of performance, Jeanne lowered her guard.

“It wasn’t sudden.” Edward sipped on his alcohol. “I drink every night. It’s just that you don’t know about it.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

At this moment, she did not know what to say. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Edward changed the topic. “How’s your alcohol tolerance?”

“Not good,” Jeanne said, “Actually, I get drunk as soon as I drink.”

“Do you get drunk from one glass?” Edward asked.

“One glass of this is fine,” Jeanne responded, “But I’ll get drunk after two glasses.”

Edward nodded.

Jeanne finished half of her glass. She put down her glass. “I won’t bother you anymore.”

“I heard that you haven’t had a man for a long time,” Edward suddenly said.

Jeanne’s expression was a little stiff.

“Last time when you were drunk, you said it while you were in Kingsley’s arms,” Edward reminded her.

He did not reveal any emotions.

Jeanne bit her lip.

She knew.

George had kindly reminded her of it.

Jeanne smiled. “I was probably blabbering as I was drunk. Fourth Master, don’t take it to heart.”

“So it hasn’t been a long time since you had a man?” Fourth Master Swan asked.

Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan.

She did not know if seven years was considered long.

She did not answer.

Some topics were not suitable for deep discussion.

Jeanne stood up and prepared to leave.

At this moment, she heard Fourth Master Swan say, “It’s been seven years for me.”

Jeanne frowned.

She did not react.

Edward said to her, “It’s been seven years since I’ve had a woman.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Her heart was beating uncontrollably.

‘Seven years ago…

‘Is he referring to me?!’

Jeanne had heard that Fourth Master Swan was cold and that no woman could get close to him. However, ever since she easily climbed into his bed seven years ago, she had started to doubt the authenticity of the rumors. Perhaps it was because of his noble status that outsiders felt that he had never had a relationship with a woman.

In fact, all men had needs.

Jeanne had confirmed that Fourth Master Swan had no problem in that aspect, so she felt that even if no woman had ever gotten close to him in public, someone might have gotten close to him in private.

It was not her fault for misunderstanding men.

Kingsley had told her so.

He said that he did not need to get married in his lifetime, but it was impossible for him to not have women.

Kingsley had a lot of women.

They were all young ladies who threw themselves at him.

Foreign countries were more open-minded. The women there were not as reserved as the women in Harken. Therefore, Kingsley had a lot of relationships with many women.

Sometimes, Jeanne always wondered if Lucy would be jealous… or if she could only endure it.

Jeanne’s thoughts seemed to have drifted far away.

It was not her fault for always thinking of Kingsley.

After all, Kingsley gave her a ray of hope to live on during her most difficult time.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She just looked at Fourth Master Swan in front of her.

He did not say anything else.

It was as if he was telling her a fact.

It made her not leave immediately.

Jeanne just looked at him and watched as he poured another glass of wine.

A full bottle of wine was finished just like that.

Jeanne knew that the alcohol content of foreign wine was not as high as that of the white wine in South Hampton City, but she had only helped Edward drink half a glass from that bottle. Edward still had too much of it.

She watched as Fourth Master Swan drank his last glass of wine.

“Fourth Master.” Jeanne suddenly held his hand.

She stopped him from drinking.

Fourth Master Swan looked at her.

“Do you want me to sleep with you?” Jeanne asked.

Fourth Master Swan’s eyes moved slightly.

“I’ve told you that whether you want money or my body, I’ll give it all,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

She admitted that she felt somewhat guilty toward Fourth Master Swan

If she could repay him with her body, she felt that it was reasonable.
