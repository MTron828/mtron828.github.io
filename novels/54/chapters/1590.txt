As usual, she gave him a leg massage with essential oil and prepared to leave. However, Nox suddenly pulled her over and pressed her under him.

Shelly was disgusted. She had always hated it when Nox touched her, but that night, she seemed even more disgusted.

Even when Nox wanted to kiss her, she kept rejecting him. Even if Nox wanted her to help him release his desires, she was rejected. In fact, because Nox could not have a woman for a year, she had helped him many times…

She admitted that she did not want to do it anymore because it was disgusting. Perhaps it was because she had provoked his ego as a man, but Nox sleep with her that night. Then, after doing it, Nox also kicked her off the bed and threatened that if she dared to tell his grandfather, he would really kill her.

That was the first time Shelly had seen Nox break down like that, and it made her wonder who should be the one breaking down instead. Just when she thought she could leave him, Nox had sex with her. Who should be one who could not accept it?

However, she knew that Nox meant what he said, and she could not afford to offend him. That was why she did not tell the Winters, and due to her relauonsmp witn INOX, sne still cnose co reject BenJamm. ?rmmqng aoouc now, it was really ironic.

After allowing Benjamin to kiss her, she revealed their relationship the next day and exposed the private agreement between Benjamin and Nox. Benjamin was so embarrassed that he had no choice but to give up on her.

Shelly also hoped that Nox would finally find his conscience and be with her. Unexpectedly, on the day of the college entrance examination, she got into a car accident. Then, Nox’s rebelled against the Winters and resisted their insistence on marrying him.

Under Mrs. Winter’s persuasion, she left Nox un. For Shelly, letting go of Nox was not difficult. However, being rejected by Mrs. Winter when she brought Bella along did make her sad for a period of time.

Fortunately, after a few years, everything was in the past. If she had not met

Benjamin again, she would have forgotten that the person was once in her life.

The meeting at that moment was really awkward. After all, their “breakup” was not friendly, and Shelly had always thought they would never see each other again. It was just like how she treated Nox. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Is this you and Nox’s daughter?” Benjamin, however, did not think it was awkward at all.

Shelly shook her head. “No, I’m no longer with Nox.”

“You broke up?” Benjamin was surprised.

Shelly suddenly smiled. “Shouldn’t you be surprised if we’re together? Isn’t it natural that we’re not together? After all, Nox doesn’t like me.”

“I thought Nox would be moved by you.”

“I can’t move him,” Shelly said bluntly.

It seemed like she did not want to talk about Nox, and Benjamin was tactful to stop asking questions.

He said, “Back then, you got into a car accident during your college entrance examination, and I heard that you were disfigured. Was it because you were disfigured that you went for facial surgery?”

“Uh, yes.” Shelly nodded. “But it can’t be denied that everyone loves beauty.”

“You’re much more beautiful than before. I was looking at you for a long time just now, but I didn’t dare to come up and say hi.”

Shelly smiled politely. There was a distance between her and Benjamin, and she maintained that distance.

“By the way, are you still in school?” Benjamin asked. He was just trying his best to chat with Shelly. “No, I’m not,” Shelly replied.

Should it not be obvious since she was holding Bella?

“You used to have good grades.” Benjamin pitied her.

“That’s all in the past.”

“Speaking of which, the child’s father…” Benjamin was still curious.

If not Nox, who else could make Shelly give birth to his child without hesitation?

“It’s getting late, and my daughter has a high fever. I have to take her back to rest.” Shelly obviously did not want to answer that question.

However, Benjamin did not ask further either.

He said, “Shelly, leave me your contact information. I haven’t been able to contact you for the past few years. Our classmates even said that you suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth. Now that I can contact you, I’ll give them an answer.”

Shelly hesitated for a moment, but she still gave her phone number to Benjamin..
