Chapter 746: She Couldn’t Please Him

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“And you’ll die alone.”

“Aren’t you supposed to be on my side?” Monica feigned anger.

Jeanne smiled. “I just didn’t think you’d really get over it.”

“You have to get over it even if you don’t want to unless I no longer want to live. And I still have my parents. If I’m dead, do you think they’d have the will to live?”

“Wow, that’s much more mature than I thought,” Jeanne commented.

“You think that I’m still the same immature girl from years ago. But in truth, there’s many things I understand better than you.”

Jeanne didn’t argue.

Monica always had an impulsive streak, but she knew very well what and why she did certain things?

She wasn’t just doing it out of pure impulse.

Even when it came to helping Michael, it wasn’t that she didn’t consider the consequences. She just chose to help Michael because she felt it was worth it.

The relationship between Monica and Michael was something that others had no right to comment on.

Michael was able to gain Monica’s trust which could only mean that he was very skilled. It wasn’t Monica’s fault.

Monica was just doing what she thought was right.

“By the way.” Monica suddenly thought of something. After confiding in Jeanne, Monica changed the topic and said, “Do you know about Nox Winter’s child bride?”

“What?” Jeanne thought for a moment. “Yeah, I’ve heard a little about it.”

Many years ago, before she was chased out by The Lawrences and went abroad, she heard that the Winters had a child bride. At that time, it was widely circulated and mocked by those in the upper-class society. She also heard that Nox had fought with his peers over the issue.

However, since her return she had been in contact with Nox Winter. Edward Swan and Nox’s relationship aside, she heard nothing about the child bride. She naturally thought that Nox had finally put the issue to rest after so many years.

Now that Monica mentioned it, she was a little curious.

“Her name is Shelly Carter. Sometimes, she attends events with the Winters. She does look...” Monica seemed to be looking for the right word. “Anyway, for someone like Nox Winter, she wouldn’t be considered attractive to him.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I remembered that the child bride was eight years younger than Nox. So she must have only reached adulthood now. A girl will change drastically when she grows up. She should’ve grown into a decent looking woman since she lived with the Winters.”

“Perhaps.” Monica nodded. “But it’s definitely not to Nox Winter’s liking.”

“Why are you suddenly mentioning her?” Jeanne said, surprised.

“Oh.” Monica seemed to have just realized why she was talking about Shelly Carter. “She went to school with Sarah Harrison. They seemed to be close. She was the one who told me to find Finn that night. I owe her a favor.”

Jeanne smiled. “So you’re still glad you ended up sleeping with Finn instead of your cousin.”

Monica was rendered speechless. Jeanne was exceptional at hitting the nail on the head.

“Alright, no more chatting.” Jeanne checked the time. Time flies whenever she’s caught up in a conversation with Monica.

Already, half an hour had passed. And Jeanne had a lot to do.

“How are you so busy every day? I don’t get it. Edward Swan’s insanely rich, so why are you tormenting yourself like this?”

That’s because Edward’s money had nothing to do with her.

While Monica wanted to continue fuming over the matter, she decided to end the call.

She stayed in bed for a while.

After some thought, Monica got up.

‘Guess I’d better get to work,’ she thought.

After all, life goes on.

She washed up and put on her makeup.

Dressing up always made her feel presentable.

She left the house and took a taxi to the Cardellini Medical Technology.

Halfway there, her mother called. “Are you up yet?”

“Am I a pig?”

“Since you’re up, do me a favor.” The other party got to the point immediately.

“What’s the matter? I plan to go to work. Dad called countless times this morning.”

“It’s already past 10. You’re only going to work now? It’ll be lunch time after turning on your computer. You might as well go in after lunch.”
