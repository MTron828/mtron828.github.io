992 Live Press Conference, Intense Confrontation!

Monica stood up from her seat, and the spotlight was on her.

She had already taken off her khaki-colored coat, and her business suit made her look very impressive.

“Ms. Cardellini, what are you trying to say? The test report is out. Are you still going to deny it?” a reporter shouted.

Monica pretended not to hear him.

She walked straight to the stage and up to the head of the quality inspection department, Daniel Cook. She said, “Director Cook, may I take a look at the report?”

Daniel did not expect Monica to go on stage, but he said, “Of course, you can.”

He handed the report to Monica.

Monica looked at it seriously for a long time before asking, “Is this the quality inspection department’s result for Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s vaccine?”

“Yes.”

“Is it real?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

“Of course!” Daniel Cook’s expression sank. “There’s no such thing as favoritism in the quality inspection department! This is the final result for Cardellini Pharmaceutical.”

“In other words, the content of this report is the quality inspection department’s official conclusion. It’s true and valid, right?”

“That’s right!” Daniel said firmly. “If you have any objections, you can appeal through the official channels. However, the report in your hands now is a legally-binding report issued by the quality inspection department.”

“It’s legal.” Monica’s lips suddenly curved into a smile.

That smile made everyone’s hair stand on end.

They did not know why Monica was smiling at that moment.

Monica said, “Coincidentally, I also have a legal report with me. Director Cook, do you want to take a look?”

“The quality inspection department can’t privately produce any test report to an individual or company. No matter what report you have, I can guarantee that it’s fake!” Daniel said righteously.

Before Monica could open her mouth, she was ridiculed by the reporters.

“Monica, do you think this is an act? And that you can act however you want to?”

“The report issued by the quality inspection department is the official result with legal effect. Do you think you can clear your name by simply making another report? Do you think this is child’s play?”

“If your father weren’t sick and in the hospital, I wouldn’t want to see you here spouting nonsense! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Get down from there!” one of the reporters shouted.

It was obvious that they despised Monica.

Today’s press conference was also live-broadcasted, and the screen was filled with countless insults directed at Monica.

To the morally-upright netizens, they were very happy about the result of the Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine being problematic.

With the result released, they could unscrupulously express their righteous opinions on the Internet to satisfy their sense of justice and vanity.

Even the so-called legal team began to ride on the popularity and started a special topic on the Internet to analyze the penal code that the Cardellini Enterprise would face with the vaccine problem.

Now, after her explanation, Monica was being bashed even more on the Internet!

Michael was also looking at the phone screen with a sinister and cunning smile on his lips.

In fact, he had expected that Monica would go up on stage impulsively to question the result. However, what was the use of questioning it? The quality inspection department was the official authority. Whatever Monica said would only be an excuse, and it would only worsen her reputation.

Now that things had come to this, he could not be blamed for being too ruthless.

In the face of power, love was insignificant.

Besides, Monica was still trying to go against him, so he had to teach her a lesson! He would make Monica suffer a life worse than death!

A hint of malice flashed across his eyes.

Michael had never failed to get what he wanted, including women. He would make Monica kneel and beg him to sleep with her!

The expression on Michael’s face became more and more ferocious.

Meanwhile, at the press conference, Monica maintained her calm and accepted everyone’s insults at her.

Steve, however, could not stand it anymore.

Although he was doubtful about the issue of Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine, because it was an official report from the quality inspection department, he could not refute it. However, Monica went on stage so impulsively. Was she not embarrassing herself even more?

Steve gritted his teeth and prepared to take Monica away.

Monica suddenly spoke again, “If your report is official and even legally binding, does that mean that the autopsy report issued by the forensics department is official and even legally binding too?”

As soon as she said that, the entire place suddenly fell silent.

Everyone looked at Monica and watched as she calmly took out an autopsy report and presented it to everyone at the scene.

The reporters immediately became restless because the report was too small and they could not see it clearly.

Monica said to everyone, “This is the autopsy report of the child who died from the vaccine injection. The results show that the child died from a high concentration of potassium cyanide, rather than the toxins and bacteria in the vaccine!

Everyone at the scene was shocked.

At that moment, Daniel was also a little flustered, but he pretended to be calm. “Who produced the autopsy report? Are there any stamps from the forensics department? Did you forge it?”

“Director Cook, you can take a look at it.” Monica handed the autopsy report to Daniel Cook. “If you don’t believe the report in my hand, I’ve invited the forensic examiner, Dr. Jacob Green, to the scene to personally interpret the autopsy report. Please tell the staff to open the door.”

All the staff members standing at the entrance looked at Daniel, waiting for his instructions.

At that moment, the reporters at the press conference were filled with anticipation.

Regardless of whether it was true or not, it was definitely breaking newsworthy, so everyone was waiting.

Daniel had no choice but to tell his men to open the door.

If he did not open it, it would be obvious that he was guilty, and he would not be able to explain himself to the public.

He gritted his teeth, nodded, and gave instructions to the staff.

When the staff opened the door, Jacob Green walked up to Monica in his work uniform.

“Dr. Green, I’m sorry to trouble you,” Monica said politely.

“As a forensic examiner, it’s my duty to speak for the dead and to restore the truth to him. It’s my duty to stand here and tell everyone on behalf of the deceased that the cause of his death was an intake of 80mg of potassium cyanide and not because the vaccine was not completely neutralized. I didn’t find any trace of vaccine’s toxins in the autopsy.”

Jacob Green’s words caused a stir among the crowd and the entire country!
