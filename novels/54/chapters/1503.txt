Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Why are you so agitated?”

“I’m not agitated. I just don’t want to lower myself to a woman’s level.” George pushed his wheelchair to the side.

When would that little brat be more honest with his words?

Candice smiled. Then, she got up and went upstairs, quickly got changed, and went downstairs to give Paige some instructions before leaving the hall.

After leaving, George, who was watching TV in the living room, turned to look in the direction Candice had left. He thought to himself, ‘Hopefully, this woman wouldn’t do anything stupid.’

“Do you like her too?” Teddy suddenly appeared beside George.

George was startled, but he quickly looked away and denied it. “No way.”

Of course, Teddy did not expose him. Instead, he said, “I don’t know why, but she gives me a very familiar feeling. If I hadn’t seen your mother’s body being sent away because she passed away during labor, I would’ve thought that your mother had come back to life.”

George was startled again, and he looked up at Teddy.

Teddy met George’s gaze and said slowly, “You must’ve suspected it, no?”

He had never thought of his mother coming back to life. Therefore, even if Candice gave him a special feeling, he had never thought about it.

Furthermore, when his father confirmed his marriage to that woman, he did an investigation on her and found out she was a real person. That was why he had never thought that she would have any other identity..

‘It’s impossible.’ George denied his thoughts.

If it were really his mother, she would not marry his father again.

Candice returned to the Nicholsons’ residence and waited.

After a while, Wyatt and Claire came back anxiously and asked, “What happened to your sister?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Candice did not hide anything and told them everything that happened yesterday.

Wyatt said resentfully, “Why is Candice so ignorant? She can’t just mess with any man! Doesn’t she know that being with the Leader of a country is as dangerous as being with a tiger?”

“What should we do now? Could Chloe really be sentenced to jail for her lewd behavior? I heard Harken has very strict laws to protect its Leader. With Chloe’s situation, she could really be sentenced to death,” Claire said nervously.

At that moment, she was on the verge of tears.

As Harken’s law that protected the country’s Leader had rarely been used throughout history, very few people knew of such laws until an accident happened.

“Why didn’t you stop your sister?” At that moment, Claire was so anxious that she began to complain.

She could not accept that fact and was a little angry at Candice.

Candice pursed her lips and said, “I didn’t know Chloe had such thoughts, so I couldn’t stop her.”

“You guys live together. How could you not tell?” Claire questioned Candice.

“Mom, do you think I should be able to tell that Chloe had some improper thoughts about her brother-in-law?” Candice asked.

Claire was stunned.

Claire was a little embarrassed at that moment.

“Since you knew, why didn’t you discipline Chloe, Mom? Not to mention Edward was the one Chloe was having improper thoughts about. Even if it were any other ordinary person, it is immoral and shameless, and it should be stopped, right? Not only did you not do that, but you even helped her!” Candice’s righteous words made Claire blush.

She stared blankly at Candice for a long time before she said reluctantly, “How would I know? What nonsense are you talking about?”

“In that case, please don’t talk nonsense, Mom,” Candice said confidently.

For a moment, Claire was intimidated by Candice’s aura.

“The most important thing for us now is to think of a way to prevent Chloe from being severely punished by the law instead of blaming each other here.”

Candice enunciated each word.

Claire could not refute her.

Wyatt quickly said, “Candice is right. The most important thing now is to keep

Chloe out from serving jail time.”

“Have you thought of any solutions?” Claire quickly asked Wyatt. “I can’t accept Chloe going to jail. She’s still at such a tender age. If she really goes to jail, her life will be ruined..”
