Chapter 674: Conspiracy Theory: She Can Only Belong To Him!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After she left, Mason walked in and sat across from her.

Jeanne handed a document to Mason. “Can you do it?”

Mason glanced at her. “No.”

Jeanne smiled.

Kingsley really liked to joke around with her, huh?

Hence, she said, “So I have to do it for you.”

In order to not let others know that Mason was incapable of doing anything, she had to finish all his work for him.

Mason nodded.

He came here only to help Jeanne kill someone, and Mr. Thorn did not tell him to do anything else.

Jeanne took back the documents. “Come and get the implementation plan before you leave work.”

“Okay.” Mason nodded.

Then, he got up and was about to leave.

“So, is this what you really look like?” Jeanne asked.

Mason looked at Jeanne and replied, “Yes.”

He had always worn a mask on his face, and K01, who had been photographed killing people, did not look like that.

Therefore, other than the insiders, no one knew he was the legendary number-one assassin in the world.

“You’re quite handsome,” Jeanne suddenly said.

Mason’s eyes moved slightly.

“You don’t have the face of an assassin,” Jeanne added.

Instead, he looked much gentler.

Mason said, “Whether I kill people or not has nothing to do with my face.”

“That’s true,” Jeanne replied.

“If there’s nothing else, I’m heading out.”

“Okay,” Jeanne replied.

With that, Mason got up and left.

Before he left, he glanced at Jeanne, but there were no emotions on his face. Then, he walked out of the office.

Once Jeanne felt that Mason had left, she raised her head and looked at the door.

Actually, she and Mason used to have feelings for each other.

At that time, Kingsley had sent her to carry out a mission. However, Kingsley was worried about her first mission, so he had Mason secretly help her. As expected, the first mission failed. During the life-threatening situation, Mason saved her and even got injured because of her. When the two of them were running for their lives, she had to admit that she had a crush on Mason for a moment.

Mason should have felt the same for her.

However, they were both assassins trained by Kingsley. Since assassins could not have feelings for each other, they hid their feelings after they returned to the Delta Islands.

Once hidden, they hid for many years until now, when they had parted ways.

She took a deep breath and focused on her work.

Some things were in the past.

Moreover…

Edward’s image suddenly appeared in her mind.

Moreover, feelings could be lost. Once she did not hold onto it, it would be gone!

…

Jeanne buried herself in her work for the whole day. When she raised her head, the sky was already completely dark as it was 8 p.m.

Hence, she stretched her body and tidied up her things to get off work.

Just as she opened the office door, she saw Eden standing there.

Jeanne frowned.

Eden had been working in the company for three days, and other than the regular meeting where the two of them had to interact, he did not say a word to her.

Yet, today, he suddenly took the initiative to approach her. He definitely had evil intentions.

“I saw you were working overtime, so I ordered a takeout for you,” Eden said. “This is the best porcini mushroom risotto in South Hampton City.”

“I appreciate your kindness, but I’m leaving now.”

“Really?” Eden’s voice was a little cold.

After that, Jeanne walked away from Eden, not wanting to waste time on pretenses with Eden.

He took the initiative to express his goodwill to let everyone know that there was no discord between them as they were rumored to be. They had a very good relationship.

It was all to set up a persona for him, and of course, she had no reason to cooperate with him. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Eden’s face was gloomy as he looked at Jeanne’s indifference toward him.

He actually knew Jeanne would not accept his takeout. However, whenever she rejected him so coldly, he would still feel a little uncomfortable.

He took a deep breath to make himself look normal. However, as soon as he turned around, he saw Quinn.

Quinn was holding a document as if she was preparing to report to Jeanne about her work.

The moment she saw Eden, she called out politely, “Vice President Swan.”

“Are you looking for President Lawrence?” Eden asked with a gentle smile.

“Yes. She gave me some work today, and I was planning to report to her after work.”

“She just left.”

“Really?”

“You just missed her.” Eden looked a little regretful.

“In that case, I’ll look for her tomorrow.”

“I didn’t expect you to be so dedicated. Those companies that rejected you should be regretting it now.” Eden changed the topic.

Quinn originally intended to leave.
