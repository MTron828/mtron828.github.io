Chapter 51: Understood... The Gap Between Us

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne walked into Fourth Master Swan’s Bamboo Garden.

Compared to the bustle of the wedding, this place was extremely quiet.

“Ms. Lawrence, please take a seat. Wait for me for a while.” Teddy was very respectful.

Jeanne nodded slightly and brought George to sit on the black sofa in Fourth Master Swan’s main hall.

Her phone rang again at this moment.

Jeanne was a little speechless.

She looked at the incoming call. “Monica.”

“Where are you?” The person on the other end seemed a little agitated.

“I… went back.” Jeanne did not want to say that she was at Fourth Master Swan’s house. Otherwise, she would not be able to clear her name no matter what.

“You went back? Why did you go back?! Don’t you know that your actions with Fourth Master Swan just now caused the entire wedding scene to be in an uproar? You have no idea know how unsightly your b*tchy sister’s expression was. You easily stole all the limelight from their grand wedding!” The other party became more excited as she said, “Damn, why did you leave at this time? You should’ve angered Jasmine to death!”

Jeanne smiled.

It was because she thought of how Jasmine was angered to death.

Jeanne was not a great person. She was happy to see a joke on those who had not let her off easily.

“By the way, what’s the relationship between you and Fourth Master Swan?” Monica suddenly became serious.

“Nothing.”

“Could it be that the two of you... got together that night?!” Monica began to imagine things.

“No.” Jeanne interrupted her thoughts. “I think the same as you. I’ll like anyone else but Fourth Master Swan!”

“Is that so?” A familiar male voice was suddenly heard on the other end.

Jeanne was stunned.

She instinctively looked at her phone.

Jeanne was sure that she was talking to Monica.

“I think the exact opposite of you, Ms. Lawrence. I don’t like anyone but you, Ms. Lawrence,” the person continued.

Jeanne directly hung up the phone.

She did not hear anything.

At this moment, Monica was petrified.

It was one thing for her phone to be suddenly snatched away, but what breaking news did she just hear?

She stared blankly at Fourth Master Swan in front of her, watching him hand her phone back to her.

Monica was dazed for quite a while before she took the phone.

“Didn’t you want to set me up with Ms. Lawrence?” Fourth Master Swan asked her.

Monica was stunned and hurriedly nodded.

“Put in more effort.” Edward left after saying that.

He left just like that.

Monica looked at Fourth Master Swan’s back view.

Why did she feel... like she was being criticized?

…

Jeanne put down her phone. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Teddy happened to walk over. “Ms. Lawrence, it’s time to eat.”

‘He even prepared lunch?!’

Jeanne could choose not to eat, but George was still growing.

She smiled. “Sorry for the trouble.”

“Ms. Lawrence, you’re too polite. Please come this way.”

Jeanne followed Teddy to the dining hall.

In the large open-air dining hall, there was a western-style long table. In front of it was a table full of dishes. At that moment, Jeanne felt that she had gone to the wrong place.

Teddy had stepped forward and pulled out the dining chair for her like a gentleman.

Jeanne sat and said, “Thank you.”.

Teddy smiled and stood respectfully at the side.

At the huge dining table, there were only Jeanne and George.

No matter how one looked at it, it felt a little too... grand.

She said, “Mr. Dolittle, why don’t you sit and eat with us?”

“Ms. Lawrence, you don’t have to be so polite.” It was obvious that Teddy declined the offer.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

In someone else’s territory, guests should follow the host.

Jeanne gestured for George to use his knife and fork.

There was too much food in front of them. Jeanne and George simply could not eat them all.

Jeanne could not help but say, “George and I can’t eat so much.”

“I prepared more because I don’t know what you like, Ms. Lawrence.”

“I’m not picky with food.”

“Okay, I’ll keep it in mind.” Teddy took out a small notebook from somewhere and wrote as he said, “Ms. Lawrence wants to eat everything.”

‘Isn’t his understanding a little off?’ Jeanne thought

“Does Little Master Lawrence dislike anything?” Teddy asked again.

“I don’t eat carrots,” George took the initiative to answer.

“Little Master Lawrence doesn’t eat carrots.” Teddy quickly wrote it in the notebook and muttered, “My master doesn’t like them either.”

“I don’t eat chocolate as well,” George added, “I’m allergic to chocolate.”

“My master is allergic to chocolate too.” Teddy looked very surprised.

George frowned and seemed to be a little unhappy.

“Do you not like spring onions too?” Teddy asked.

George nodded honestly.

“You’re just like my master.” Teddy sighed.

“Who wants to be like your master…?” George retorted.

“George.” Jeanne stopped him. “Eat.”

George bit his lip and lowered his head to eat.

Teddy silently noted down: [Refer to Fourth Master’s diet for Little Master Lawrence’s diet.]

After lunch, Jeanne and George continued to wait for Fourth Master Swan at Bamboo Garden.

Teddy still stood respectfully beside them, not moving at all.

“When will your master be back?” Jeanne could not help but ask.

They had waited for two hours.

Teddy said, “I don’t know. He didn’t say. That said, since today is the eldest young master’s wedding, he’ll probably be late.”

Jeanne felt that waiting like this was not a solution.

When she was planning to leave with George, Teddy suddenly said, “Ms. Lawrence, if you’re tired, you can take Little Master Lawrence to rest first. When Fourth Master comes back later, I’ll call you.”

Jeanne had been waiting for so long. It was not her style to leave just like that.

She said, “I’ll have to trouble you then.”

Jeanne was a little sleepy.

Last night, she had almost not slept at all. Today, she had gone through a lot.

Teddy brought Jeanne to a guest room.

Even if it was a guest room, it was still a huge room with a huge bed.

Jeanne was sleepy.

She said to George, “I want to sleep for a while. If you want to sleep, then sleep. If you don’t want to sleep, then play with your phone.”

“Okay.” George nodded obediently.

Jeanne almost did not stop George’s freedom.

She leaned on the big bed and lay down in her dress.

Almost as soon as she touched the bed, she fell asleep in less than a minute.

George did not have the habit of taking an afternoon nap, so he picked up his phone, sat on the sofa, and found a game to play.

He had just started playing the game when the door was suddenly pushed open.

George looked up and was about to speak.

“Shh.” Edward told him to be quiet.

George frowned and watched Fourth Master Swan walk directly to Jeanne’s side.

Edward looked down at Jeanne from above.

He did not even blink.

Slowly, he sat down and bent over.

“Fourth Old Master.” Behind him, a tender voice was heard.

At the same time, the sleeping woman in front of him also opened her eyes.

She had just fallen asleep, but because of a little sound, she was startled awake.

The moment she woke up, she did not look sleepy at all.

Her eyes were clear and bright, and her gaze was sharp.

“Fourth Old Master,” Jeanne called out to Edward, and even her voice was clear and crisp.

“What have you experienced in the past seven years?” Fourth Master Swan’s expression did not change, and his thin lips opened slightly.

Jeanne frowned.

“You changed so much,” Fourth Master Swan said.

Jeanne sat up from the bed.

She smiled. “I just understood a lot.”

“What did you understand?”

“I understood...” Jeanne enunciated each word, “The gap between us.”
