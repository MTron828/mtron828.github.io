910 The Sudden Fire Rescue

“Edward!” Jeanne glared fiercely at him. If they didn’t leave now, they would have to prepare to be burned to death inside.

Just as Jeanne was about to flare up, Edward suddenly lowered her head and kissed her deeply.

F*ck! Edward was crazy for doing such a thing at a time like this.

Jeanne pushed Edward away, but he bit her lip, staining them with blood. Then, he stood up and rushed into the burning banquet hall. Jeanne looked at Edward’s back. Her eyes turned red. What was he going to do? Was he really going to risk his life like that?

She knew then that this fire was not an accident. It was a deliberate arrangement, and the reason why Edward asked her to accompany him was to stall for time...

It was clear he played her. Jeanne’s vision was blurry as she watched his figure disappear.

“Retreat!” A familiar voice suddenly rang in Jeanne’s ears. She turned her head and saw Lucy, who seemed to have found her under the light of the fire. She pulled her by the arm and walked out.

Jeanne returned to her senses. Edward was no longer in her line of sight, and the fire inside was clearly getting bigger and bigger. The guards were also transporting all the guests away in the light of the fire.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and decided to leave with Lucy. As they retreated, she suddenly thought of something.

“What’s wrong?” Lucy noticed her expression.

“I don’t know if George and Monica have gone out!” Jeanne was obviously nervous.

She knew very well that there would be no casualties in the chaos. The other party obviously did not want to kill anyone, and since the guards of the Sanders could not do anything to the guests, there was no immediate danger. However, with the current fire, people could die if they were not careful. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“George left.” Lucy kept saying.

She had specifically asked someone to pay special attention to George. They would try their best not to implicate George in this incident.

“He was brought out by Nox at the first moment. As for Monica…” Lucy did not notice.

“Help me ask the others if they saw the bride leave!” Jeanne said to Lucy anxiously.

Lucy nodded. She was well aware of Monica’s importance to Jeanne and would not force Jeanne on this matter. So while Lucy informed everyone to evacuate, she also ordered them to search if Monica had already left the banquet hall.

As the fire inside grew more and more intense, Lucy forced Jeanne to leave. It was easy to get burned inside. Jeanne followed Lucy out, but she did not move very fast. If someone discovered that Monica was still inside, she could rush back and save her.

The two of them walked to the entrance of the banquet hall. Most of the guests had already escaped, and Jeanne was constantly looking for Monica’s figure among them.

Then, Michael walked past Jeanne and out of the banquet hall with Reese by his side. Reese seemed to be choking and coughing on the smoke, and Michael was taking care of her.

Jeanne glanced at the two of them, a little nervous. Monica, like Michael, was at the innermost part of the banquet hall. It was quite far from the main doors and was the most difficult to exit.

She felt that she could not wait any longer. She was going to rush in.

“Jeanne!” Lucy pulled her back. “Calm down.”

“Monica’s different. She’s very stupid, doesn’t know anything, and her stamina’s horrible!” Jeanne was almost certain that Monica was still inside. “She’s different from Edward. If Edward rushed in, he still had a chance of survival. However, Monica won’t. She would easily be burned to death by the fire.”

Lucy bit her lip.

At this moment, Kingsley was constantly instructing her, “Take Jeanne and leave immediately!”

She looked at Jeanne intently, but Jeanne did not seem to want to talk to Lucy anymore. She shook off Lucy’s hand and rushed in.

“Lucy!” Kingsley’s voice rang in her ears. When she saw Jeanne rush into the banquet hall, she shouted in an unusually angry voice.

It was true. She could stop Jeanne. After all, Jeanne’s skills were no match for hers. If they really fought, Jeanne would not be able to win. However, she disobeyed Kingsley’s orders and rushed in with Jeanne.

The moment Jeanne ran in...
