Chapter 1727: Twins

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica screamed hysterically. She really wished she could kill Finn and then smash her head into Finn’s embrace. She had finally given birth to one, but why was there another one in her belly?

The people waiting outside were also extremely anxious.

Ruby, for one, could not remain calm. She kept walking in the corridor and mumbling, “Why isn’t she out yet? Why is she screaming like that? Why isn’t she…” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Just then, the door to the delivery room suddenly opened.

A nurse came out with a baby in her arms. “Monica’s family.”

Everyone in the corridor rushed toward the nurse excitedly, and it shocked the nurse. It looked as if they were all here to snatch the child away from her.

She said, “It’s a boy. Dr. Jones said to bring the first child out for you to take a look. As for the second child, the mother is still in labor.”

“Alright, alright.” Ruby quickly went forward to hold the child. “At least one is out.”

“He is exactly five pounds.” The nurse said, “The twins are relatively good-looking, and they don’t need to be placed in the incubator for the time being. You guys can hold him. When the other baby is born, I’ll take them to get their vaccinations.”

“Alright, alright,” Ruby said again.

She was really excited.

“By the way, how is Monica?” Ruby quickly asked.

Then, a loud voice came from the delivery room. “Finn, you sc*mbag. I’d like to see you try getting me pregnant next time. Ahhh..

The atmosphere in the corridor turned awkward. Before the door opened, everyone could only vaguely hear Monica’s shouts coming from inside. However, now that the door was opened, they could hear her clearly, and Ruby felt embarrassed for her daughter.

The nurse smiled. “The patient is in good spirits. Don’t worry. Besides, Dr. Jones is accompanying her in the delivery room, so she’ll be fine. I’ll head back in now.”

“Thank you, miss. Sorry to trouble you.”

The nurse nodded slightly, turned around, and walked in.

Knowing that Monica was in good spirits, everyone outside was less worried about her, and they all turned their attention to the newborn baby.

At that moment, the baby was not crying or making a fuss. His eyes were open as he looked at the people who came to visit him. They were filled with curiosity about the world.

“He’s so cute,” Jeanne could not help but say.

“How is he cute?” Nox looked at him in disdain. “He’s so wrinkled like an old man. Ow!”

Nox covered his head, not knowing why Edward hit him.

However, Ruby did not mind Nox’s comment. She said, “All babies are like this.

They’re considered good-looking.”

In any case, she found her grandson very good-looking.

“Come, let me hold him.” Gary was also beyond excited.

“That won’t do. You’re clumsy. What if you don’t hold him properly?”

“You’re the clumsy one. When you gave birth to Monica, wasn’t I the one who held her and fed her? And you’re saying I can’t hold him properly?” Gary said angrily.

Ruby blushed. “Old man, what nonsense are you spouting?”

“Let me hold him. Let me hold my grandson.”

“Wait a moment.” Ruby refused to let go. “Can’t you see that Monica is still in labor? Can’t you hold the younger one? Won’t the baby feel uncomfortable if we pass him around?”

In the end, Gary let Ruby have it her way. Hence, he could only look at his grandson with a doting expression. Jeanne, on the other hand, was watching them the entire time. Although they were bickering, it seemed nice to have parents.

Then, someone suddenly hugged her from the back. Jeanne turned around to see that it was Edward, who seemed to know what she was thinking just by looking at her expression. After all, the two of them were now orphans.

As Jeanne leaned into Edward’s embrace, Edward’s lips curled into a smile, and he whispered in her ear, “You can call me Daddy too.”

Jeanne glared at him, speechless at how he was taking advantage of her, and Edward smiled brightly.

When Nox saw the interaction between the two of them, he turned around in disgust and decided not to look as it was a sight for sore eyes.

Just as he turned around, he saw Shelly sitting on a chair in the corridor with Bella on her lap. She was sitting with Sarah, and they were talking in low voices. However, Shelly had a bright smile on her face, one that was completely different from when she was with him.

He quickly looked away and thought might as well take a look at Finn’s eldest son. Hence, he walked to Ruby and glanced over at the baby from time to time..
