962 Birthday Party, Jeanne Returns To South Hampton City

She was just trying to attract Kingsley’s attention and achieve her goal.

Lucy did not plan to stay with Kingsley for too long. She raised her glass and said, “Here’s a toast to you.”

After that, she finished the glass of red wine in one gulp.

Kingsley looked at her glass of red wine and finished the glass of red wine in his hand.

Then, Lucy bowed politely.

It was the standard etiquette of the upper class, and Lucy was not the only one who knew how to do it. Everyone knew how to do it, and they were all very familiar with it.

That was the basic skill of an assassin because when an assassin killed someone, they had to disguise their identity. Etiquette was the most basic skill, and even the servants here knew it. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Just as she turned around and was about to leave, Kingsley suddenly called out to her, “Lucy.”

Lucy stopped, not daring to take a single step. She stood in front of Kingsley again at a distance that was neither too far nor too close.

At that moment, Kingsley’s fingers suddenly touched Lucy’s collarbone.

She pursed her lips.

She was dressed like this tonight only to cover up her burns.

However, before the burn could fully heal, the pressure from Kingsley’s fingers added to her pain.

She endured it, but she did not understand how she had offended Kingsley.

Was it because the violent nature in Kingsley’s body had been unleashed again recently and that he needed to torture people to make him feel better?

“Come to my room tonight,” he said.

Then, he lifted his fingers away.

Lucy looked at Kingsley. For a second, she thought she had heard him wrong.

She had thought that it would not be as easy to get into Kingsley’s bed tonight as she had thought. After all, what Kingsley had done to her in her room that afternoon made her feel like he no longer had any feelings for her, and she was still thinking about how she could make it seem less purposeful.

At that moment, Kingsley had told her to go to his room that night in front of everyone.

She naturally knew what he meant by going to his room, so she replied respectfully, “Yes.”

Then, she glanced at Millie a little proudly.

In fact, she was deliberately provoking Millie. After all, Millie was still young and could not withstand such provocation.

From the flash of anger on Millie’s face, Lucy knew that Millie had fallen into her trap.

As Kingsley walked past Lucy with Millie, Lucy also turned around and walked back to her original corner.

Jeanne was no longer around.

Kingsley was busy dealing with so many people at the moment, so he probably did not notice.

As expected, not only did he not notice that Jeanne was missing, but it had never crossed his mind that Jeanne would suddenly return to South Hampton City, especially under Mason’s protection.

At Mason’s signal, Jeanne left the manor’s hall and returned to her room, where she changed out of her princess dress and jumped out of the window.

Mason was waiting for her below.

After jumping down from the third floor, he barely managed to roll onto the ground and land safely.

“The car is this way,” Mason said.

Jeanne nodded and followed Mason into the parking lot of the manor.

There were so many cars in the parking lot that it was comparable to a large-scale auto show. Moreover, all of them were top-grade cars.

Mason brought Jeanne to his private car, in which Jeanne sat in the back seat. After that, Mason drove away from the manor.

When they were leaving, the guards at the gate had to do a check.

Mason rolled down the car window and said coldly, “It’s a last-minute mission. I need to leave.”

The guard respectfully let them through.

Jeanne turned around and took a look at the dazzling manor under the night sky. At that moment, she sighed.

It was not that she could not bear to leave. After all, she would be back soon.

However, she suddenly understood why Lucy wanted her to ask Mason to help her leave. Usually, when she wanted to go out, she had to report back to Kingsley. Kingsley would only allow her to take a walk in the city if he was in a good mood, and she would be closely monitored 24 hours a day. On the other hand, Mason only needed to say one word, and he could leave so easily.

Mason parked the car at the private airport of the Delta Islands before leading Jeanne into a helicopter.

With Mason flying the helicopter, he and Jeanne left the Delta Islands and landed in a city on the border. Then, they went to the international airport to handle the flight procedures and boarded the plane to South Hampton City.

Jeanne found the entire process unbelievably smooth.

If she was alone, she might have been captured by the assassins Kingsley had sent.
