Chapter 360: Honeymoon: I Love You, Jeanne

How could Finn have such a bad character?

She said, “Do you know your character makes you very annoying?”

She said it out loud because she could not hold it in or suppress it anymore.

However, Finn did not answer her.

“I’ll have you know that no woman would like someone like you!” Monica said, enunciating each word.

The grip on Finn’s fork tightened.

“*sshole!” Monica left after saying that.

She felt like it was a waste of time talking to Finn.

Why could she not drill it into her mind every time that she should not interact with that man?

Why could she not drill it into her mind every time to stay away from that man? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Was she crazy? Why did she think that she and Finn could still be friends in the future?

Finn’s hate for her was deeply rooted in his bones.

What was it about her that made him look down on her so much?

......

What was it about her that was unworthy of him and made her feel inferior in front of him?!

D*mn it!

Monica slammed the door shut.

Only when she closed the door did Finn raise his head and look in the direction of the door. His face was still as cold as ever.

He had stomach issues, and it was pretty serious. Hence, when he did not eat on time, his stomach would react. Although he did not feel any pain, the discomfort in his stomach was abnormally obvious, and he should not torture his body like that. That was why he did not return to his room immediately after he returned.

The way he treated Monica…

Anyway, she would never know why he would treat her like that!

..

At the Food Surveillance Bureau, Michael was in his office with a serious expression.

At that moment, the door to his office was locked, and he was standing in front of the large floor-to-ceiling window, making a phone call.

The person on the other end of the phone ordered, “Check Finn!”

“Yes. But, Mr. President, may I ask why you want to run a check on Finn?” Michael asked.

He really did not know why Finn would attract the attention of the Sanders.

“Nox is the grandson of Wade. I’m very clear about this, so there’s no need to spend too much time on him. However, we don’t know Finn’s background, and I think it’s necessary to conduct an investigation.”

“Yes.” Michael agreed immediately.

“The empire that the Duncans conquered back then has already been eradicated. However, some time ago, the Intelligence Bureau said that the child of the Duncans’ eldest grandson’s daughter-in-law might still be alive. No matter how this person is now, he’s still a threat to our Sanders. To put it bluntly, he is also an inglorious existence to us. Back then, regardless of whether the Duncans’ administration of Harken was no longer sufficient to support the development of Harken or whether the Duncans were seeking self-protection against us Sanders, in a fundamental sense, us Sanders did try to seize power from them. If that person is still alive in this world, he will constantly remind everyone of the heinous things the Sanders has done. Therefore, we must uproot this person and exterminate him!” The President’s tone was getting a little harsh.

“I understand,” Michael said respectfully.

“Michael.” The tone of the President changed and became somewhat earnest. “I am well aware of your father’s physical condition, and because of your father’s high position in the court and the difference in his position, your father will naturally make many enemies. If anything happens to your father, many people will be eyeing the position of the national defense general. I’m indeed protecting the Rosses. After all, your grandfather helped my father to conquer the Sanders back then. So, naturally, I don’t want you both to be replaced. However, I am, after all, the president of a country. Whatever I do, I need to convince the masses. You’re so young. If I disregard everyone’s objections and let you take the position of the national defense general, it will put me in a difficult position. However, if you can help us Sanders to find this person and eliminate the hidden dangers, I’ll have a reasonable reason to promote you.”

“I won’t let you down, Mr. President!” Michael promised.

“Okay.” The person on the other end replied, “I’ll leave this matter to you. If there is anything you need, feel free to contact me. I’ll try my best to help you.”

“Thank you, Mr. President.”

With that, the person on the other end hung up the call without saying anything else.

Michael also silently put his phone down.

At that moment, his expression was extremely cold.

Finn…

Could Finn have such a powerful background?
