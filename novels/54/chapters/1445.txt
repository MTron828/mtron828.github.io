Chapter 1446: Edward Often Calls Out Jeanne’s Name When He’ s Asleep

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Candice had always thought that George would treat her differently after what happened last night. At least, he thanked her. However, in the next few days, he was back to his usual long face again. Even when she approached him, he would reject her.

The person who would spend the night with him would definitely be Teddy. He even specifically instructed Teddy not to let her in his room. That little brat was really not easy to please.

Candice went back to her room in a huff and sat on the bed. She had wanted to go to George’s room to accompany him, but the door was locked. Inside, Teddy had a wronged look on his face, as if to tell her not to make things difficult for him.

Who was making things difficult for whom? Was it so difficult for her to see George?

“Why are you angry?” Edward came out of the bathroom after taking a shower. The moment he came out, he saw Candice’s angry face and found it funny.

“It’s all because of your son!” Candice said unhappily, “I wonder whose personality he resembles, but he’s so fussy! When he grows up, will he be able to find a wife?”

“He’s like me,” Edward said. At that moment, he pulled Candice into his embrace. “Didn’t I find a wife?”

“Yeah, you found three,” Candice said sarcastically.

Edward was a little embarrassed.

“Go to sleep.” Candice did not seem to want to say more.

She believed that if she continued to think about it, she would die of anger. With that, she lifted the blanket and went to bed.

Edward followed her.

“Tomorrow is your father’s birthday,” Edward said as he smoothened out the blanket.

Candice was stunned. She had completely forgotten about it. In fact, she did not even remember her father’s birthday.

“He came to look for me today and told me to go back to the Nicholsons with you.”

Candice nodded.

At that moment, there was an indescribable feeling in her heart. It was as though she was no longer a member of the Nicholson family after leaving the Nicholsons.

She felt a little ungrateful for thinking that.

“Do you want to go to George’s room?” Edward asked.

“I don’t.”

“I have the key.”

Candice looked at him.

Edward took out the keys. “The older the wiser.”

Candice took the keys and left.

As Edward stared at Candice’s back, the smile on his face gradually faded. He wondered how long such happiness could last…

Candice used the key to open the door and saw Teddy wiping George’s body.

When the two of them heard the noise, they turned to look at Candice at the

Candice felt an inexplicable sense of satisfaction. The more unhappy George was, the better she felt.

“How did you get the key to my room?” George questioned her.

“Your dad gave it to me.”

George’s little face twisted in anger.

Therefore, what she meant was that he should take it up with his father.

“What are you doing here?” George frowned at Candice. “To look after you and see if you feel better.”

“I’m fine. There’s no need for you to take care of me anymore.”

“Is that so?” Candice walked to George’s window and looked at his fair little body under his clothes. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“What are you looking at?” George blushed.

At that moment, he was a little flustered.

“You’re not even fully grown yet. What’s there to see?” Candice smiled brightly.

“It’s indecent for a woman to look at a man. Get out!” George said angrily.

Candice suddenly froze as that sentence seemed a little familiar. It was as if at some point in time, a little brat had told her the same.

She looked straight at George.

“Teddy,” George called out to Teddy.

Teddy felt terrible. ‘Little Young Master, how could I dare to do anything to the Madam!’

“It’s useless even if you call Teddy.” Candice regained her senses. “I won’t leave.”

George’s face was red with anger.

That woman was so annoying. She clearly knew that he did not like her, yet she was still so thick-skinned!

“What are you going to do if you don’t leave?!” George held back and tried to calm himself down.

“Why do you reject me so much?!”

“I…” George was stunned by Candice’s sudden question.

He just did not want to see her.

“Are you afraid of developing feelings for me?” Candice smiled smugly.

“What nonsense are you spouting? What feelings can I have for you? You’re just an old woman, ” George muttered.

Candice was so angry that her head hurt.

“Get out of here. I want to sleep.”

“I’ll stay with you..”
