1180 Jeanne’s Betrayal, Her Past Exposed

Jeanne was trying her best to calm her heartbeat.

She stood beside Warren and noticed that his attention was all on their surroundings. There seemed to be some noise around them.

“Go out and draw them away!” Warren whispered to Jeanne.

Jeanne looked at him.

“Jeannie, I don’t want you to sacrifice yourself for me, but I have to make a choice at this critical moment. Hold on for 5 minutes; 5 minutes at most. As long as our rescue team arrives, we can survive.”

Jeanne kept her thoughts to herself and did not agree immediately.

Just then, they seemed to hear the sound of a helicopter engine from afar.

Warren was overjoyed because he knew that his people were coming.

He hurriedly said, “Jeanne, hurry up and stall them for a few minutes. We’ll be rescued in a few minutes.”

“Alright.” Jeanne nodded. “Give me a gun!”

Warren was hesitant.

“I can’t go out like this!” Jeanne said firmly.

Even if she had to sacrifice herself for him, he had to get her a weapon to defend herself.

“Take it.” Warren handed Jeanne a gun.

It was clear that Warren had no other choice.

If he did not give Jeanne the gun, Nox might find them immediately. However, if he gave Jeanne the gun, he would be able to escape while Jeanne lured the others away.

Jeanne took the black gun.

“Be careful,” Warren warned.

Jeanne held the gun tightly in her hand before nodding at Warren and turning to leave.

“Wait,” Warren suddenly called out to her. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jeanne turned around.

“Don’t forget the bullets.” Warren handed the bullet to Jeanne.

Jeanne checked the gun.

In fact, when she had asked for the gun and saw that Warren hesitated for a few seconds, she had already noticed that he had secretly removed the bullet.

After everything that had happened tonight, Warren’s cautiousness and scheming skills made her afraid to let her guard down for even a second.

If she had aimed the gun at Warren’s head earlier, Warren would have used his other gun, which was fully loaded with bullets, and shot her to death.

Jeanne did not show any emotions.

Even though she was already starting to panic, she took the bullet and loaded it. Then, without a second’s delay, she turned around and left.

The moment she left, and Warren let his guard down against her, she suddenly pointed the gun at Warren’s head.

At the same time, her other hand quickly restrained his hand, which had a gun that he was about to shoot Jeanne with.

When the gunshot sounded in the sky, it instantly attracted the attention of Nox and the others.

Suddenly, Warren and company were exposed again.

The moment Nox saw them, he raised his gun and was ready to shoot. He was annoyed that Warren could still escape under such circumstances and wished he could kill him with a single shot now.

However, when he saw Jeanne’s actions clearly, he held back.

Warren was also looking at Jeanne coldly, and his expression darkened. “Are you planning to betray me now?!”

“Not now,” Jeanne’s gun was aimed at his forehead. She only needed to pull the trigger, and he would die!

Warren continued to look at Jeanne coldly.

“I always thought that everything I did was to kill you!”

“Do you think you can survive after you kill me? You know that our rescue team is already here, yet you still want to kill me? Are you crazy?”

“Do you think I’m crazy for wanting revenge for my father?” Jeanne sneered, and she looked like she was ready to kill.

“What are you talking about?!”

“Joseph Sanders is my biological father. You’re not!” Jeanne said through gritted her teeth.

Warren’s expression sank, and he glared at her fiercely, as if he could not believe that she knew everything.

“Back then, my mother left the Hills because she couldn’t accept how cruel they were and did not want to agree to the political marriage. But in fact, when my father went to propose marriage to my mother, he had already fallen in love with her at first sight! When he found out that she had left the Hills to escape the marriage, he left the Sanders for my mother without hesitation. My mother was so touched that the two of them got together.” Jeanne revealed the truth of the past and everything that she had hidden for many years.

“Do you think my father and mother got together because my father wanted to compete with you for the position of the head of the Sanders? After all, once my mother returned to the Hills, you would have no chance to compete with them! So, when my father did not have his guard up against you, you found someone to secretly kill him. After killing my father, you pretended to take care of my mother in order to get her. You knew that if you got her, you’d get the Hills. However, what you don’t know is that when you killed my father, my mother already knew that it was you who killed him. Pretending to accept your care was just to avenge my father!”
