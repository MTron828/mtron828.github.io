Chapter 803: Exciting and Intense, Rescuing Jeanne

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the last second, their speed of falling suddenly slowed down a lot.

It seemed they had slowed down because of the support of Edward’s arm. Although they had not reached the point where they could land safely, at least they would not die.

The two of them landed on the ground and rolled a few times. With Edward protecting her with his body, she was unharmed.

Eventually, the crazy rolling stopped.

It had only been a dozen seconds since the fall, but a lot of things had happened within that time frame.

When Kingsley heard Jeanne’s voice and saw her jump down from the 50 meter-tall platform, his expression turned ferocious. He also chose to stay in the car and immediately ordered the car to reverse, madly backing away from the entrance of M Underground Organization. With that, the night sky was filled with sounds of gunfires.

The assassin, who was standing next to Kingsley a second ago, was shot dead by the sniper in the distance. If Kingsley had gotten out of the car, he would have been the one dead.

Kingsley’s expression was terrifying. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Countless bullets hit his car, but they did not penetrate it or hurt him at all.

He gave an order, “Level this place immediately and don’t leave a single person alive!”

“Yes.”

At that moment, all the assassins took action.

Just now, they were stalling with M Underground Organization to give Edward and K01 time to rescue Jeanne.

However, there was no need for that now because Jeanne might be dead…

At the thought of that, Kingsley’s expression became even more frightening.

No one by Kingsley’s side had ever seen that expression on him despite being with him for so many years.

All everyone knew was that he was numb to killing and was extremely cold-blooded. However, no one knew how terrifying he could be.

In the meantime, Jeanne and Edward had just fallen from a height of 50 meters, and everyone thought they were dead.

Under the dark sky, unbeknownst to everyone else, they stood up after rolling on the ground a few times.

“Edward,” Jeanne called out to him.

It was obvious that there was something wrong with his body.

It was not that he was about to die from the fall, but rather, his entire body was tense, and he looked violent. His body seemed to have suddenly exapnded, and even his consciousness seemed to be fading away.

She suddenly remembered that one time when they were in trouble and they found Edward in that state.

It was an existence that was not human.

“Edward!” Jeanne called out to him fiercely.

Edward’s entire body was red, and even his eyes were bloodshot. He forced himself to remain rational and in control of his body. He said, “Hurry up and leave!”

“Where are you going?”

“Hurry up and leave!” Edward pushed Jeanne out of the room.

He even managed to push Jeanne a few meters back. It was as if she had been thrown into the air.

His strength was shocking.

The moment Jeanne landed on the ground, K01 suddenly appeared beside her.

After luring those people away, he returned to the scene and saw everything.

If he had not come to take Jeanne’s ‘body’ away, he would not have known that the two of them were not dead after falling from such a great height. In fact, they were not even injured.

However, there was no time to ask why such a miracle had happened.

K01 protected Jeanne and was about to leave with her.

At that moment, no one’s attention was on them as Kingsley’s men were all attacking M Underground Organization, forcing them to retreat. Hence, their enemies were too busy to notice them.

“Wait.” Jeanne grabbed K01.

K01 was stunned.

“Take Edward with you,” Jeanne said.

By then, Edward had already walked to the side in a frenzy and seemed to be keeping a distance from her.

“No,” K01 said bluntly, “My mission is only to protect you. ”

“Mason!”

K01 did not give Jeanne any chance to resist. He used his strength and punched the back of Jeanne’s head. Jeanne’s vision turned black, and she fainted.

After that, K01 looked at Edward, who had disappeared into the night.

That man… Why was he different from ordinary people?

Without any further delay, he left with Jeanne in his arms amidst the rain of bullets.

Meanwhile, Kingsley was sitting coldly in the car, waiting for the final result.

He was waiting for K01 to retrieve Jeanne’s ‘body’.
