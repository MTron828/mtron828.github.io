“A variety show.”

“Alright.” Shelly looked through the channels to find something for Nox to watch.

“When I found Bella, she was so scared silly by the human traffickers that she was numb when she saw me. You should spend more time with her for the next few days. I’m afraid she might be traumatized from that experience.”

“Alright.” Shelly nodded.

She was neither too friendly nor cold to Nox, but she no longer rejected him.

“Is this okay?” Shelly asked Nox.

“Sure.” Nox nodded.

Shelly placed the remote control in front of Nox. Then, she turned around and went into the room to pick up Nox’s clothes and wash them in the laundry sink.

Nox watched TV for a while. However, he could not concentrate the entire time as his mind was filled with the image of Shelly washing his clothes. He thought for a moment before he stood up and walked to the laundry sink. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Shelly was so engrossed in washing the clothes that she did not notice Nox walking out from behind. At that moment, she was washing Nox’s boxer, which was a little dirty, so she was scrubbing it very hard.

Suddenly, her body froze when she felt someone hugging her from behind. She pursed her lips and did not push him away.

Nox could not hold it in anymore. When he saw Shelly washing his boxer so seriously, he could not help but want to get close to her. It felt like they were an old, married couple, and it made his heart feel warm and fuzzy.

Before, he felt that there was a huge distance between him and Shelly, and no matter how hard he tried to get closer to her, it was useless. Shelly would never be with him again. Yet now, he suddenly felt that she was so close that he could reach out to touch her and hug her tightly in his arms.

“Shelly.” Nox buried his head in her neck.

Shelly was a little repulsed, but she did not refuse his intimacy.

“Do you mean what you said?” Nox asked her. “You said that if I found Bella for you, we would be together again.”

“Yes.” Shelly nodded.

Otherwise, she would not be under the same roof as him now.

Nox hugged her tighter and confirmed with her again. “In that case, are we considered a couple now?”

“Yes.”

“1 can stay here tonight, right?” Nox asked.

Knowing that he finally got Shelly back, Nox’s heart almost melted. He felt that if he did not get her back soon, he would die of heartache. At that moment, he could not help but kiss Shelly’s neck.

Shelly bit her lip in response.

“Let me wash the clothes.” Nox volunteered.

He was obviously in a good mood. “No need. I’ll be done in a minute.” “I’ll do it. I agreed I would do the laundry, cook, and take care of the children. I’ll learn them all.” Nox was very enthusiastic.

Shelly looked at Nox and did not expect him to do all that. Somehow, she had a feeling that he was just saying it casually.

“Is this how you do it?” By then, Nox had picked up his frothy clothes and started to scrub them.

“Yes.” Shelly nodded.

“Then, you can watch from the side. I’ll wash it.”

“Alright.”

Shelly stayed with Nox as he washed the clothes. Even though the foam on his clothes was everywhere, Shelly kept quiet about it.

Once the clothes had been washed, the two of them returned to the living room together. Nox said he wanted to watch TV for a while, so Shelly accompanied him on the sofa.

Nox was very easily amused. Regardless of whether it was funny or not, he would laugh, and Shelly simply went along with him.

After watching an episode, Nox stretched his back. “Would you like to go to sleep?

“Alright.” Shelly nodded.

“Are we going in the room I was in just now?”

‘Yes.”

Nox walked in, and Shelly followed behind him.

Nox had never thought of sharing a bed with Shelly immediately, but he was not against it. Therefore, when he got into bed, Shelly followed suit.

Nox began to feel excited at how proactive Shelly was. He thought that they would at least be together for a while before… Forget it. He admitted that he was overjoyed right now as he lay on the bed and felt Shelly beside him.

Just as he was thinking about whether he should take action, he suddenly heard Shelly’s voice, which startled him.

He heard her say, “Nox, should I continue to live here in the future, or should I move to your place?”

“Why don’t you move to mine?”

“Alright.” Shelly agreed immediately. “But I’ll keep Bella with me.. Do you mind?”
