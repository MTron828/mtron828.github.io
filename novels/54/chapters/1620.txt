Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the entrance of the hospital, countless reports stopped Nox at the door, asking him an overwhelming amount of questions.

“Young Master Winter, do you have anything to say about Zoe cheating on you? Do you hate Zoe for that? Do you think your relationship has been a lie?”

“Young Master Winter, will Zoe cheating on you affect the cooperation between Winter Enterprise and The Sullivan Group? Rumor has it that you’re the one who invested in the artificial intelligence of The Sullivan Group. Will you withdraw your investment because of your marriage?”

“Apparently, your grandfather, Old Master Winter, was the one who exposed Zoe’s affair at the wedding. Did your grandfather consider your feelings when he did that?”

“Young Master Winter-” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Enough!” Nox flew off the handle and shouted at the reporters, “Are you guys done? It’s bad enough that I’ve been cuckolded, yet you’re still adding fuel to the fire. If you want to know how it feels to be cuckolded so badly, go and experience it yourself. You’ll know what it feels like after you experience it.”

“Young Master Winter, we just wanted to ask, what will be your attitude toward Zoe in the future?”

“What do you think my attitude toward her will be? Of course, I’ll never interact with her ever again. Let me tell you, don’t mention this woman in front of me again, or I’ll beat up whoever mentions her again. Don’t test my limits.” ‘Young Master Winter…”

“As for my business with the Sullivans… Damn it. Considering I’ve been cuckolded so badly, do you think I’m crazy to give them money for scientific research? Our cooperation ends here.”

“Young Master Winter, I’d like to ask..’

“No more questions. I’ve already answered everything I can. All of you, shut up!” Nox was so angry that he did not want to hear another word from the reporters.

“I just wanted to ask how Young Master Winter is doing. I didn’t expect you to be hospitalized for a week.” The reporter changed the topic.

Nox paused for a second.

In fact, he could have been discharged on the same day, but he did not want to be discharged because he did not want to see anyone. Therefore, he had been lying in the hospital, waiting for his death.

Other than having people come to visit him on the first day, he was left alone

for the next few days. Then, he was really bored to death, so he decided to be discharged.

“It’s nothing,” Nox said coldly.

“I heard that Zoe-I‘

“Why are you still talking about her?” Nox’s expression darkened immediately.

“I heard that the woman who cuckolded you…” The reporter changed the way he addressed her.

“Damn, do you think I won’t hit you?” Nox was furious.

The reporters at the scene were amused. Being cuckolded was a very sad thing, but when it happened to Nox, it became a joke.

“She seems to have been locked up at home for the past few days and has suicidal tendencies. I wonder if Young Master Winter would feel any sympathy for her.”

“I won’t!” Nox’s voice was loud and firm. “Whether she lives or dies is her business. If she really commits suicide, you don’t have to inform me. I won’t mourn for her!”

The reporters really admired Nox. Other than Nox, no one else in Harken could speak so openly in front of the reporters.

Did Nox not care about his image? Anyway, what kind of image could he have after he had been cuckolded so badly?

“Move aside, move aside!” Nox pushed the reporter away. “I’ve said what I wanted to say. If you guys continue to pester me, I won’t be polite anymore!”

Seeing that Nox was not joking, the reporters silently made way for him. Then, Nox took a taxi back.

As he did not get anyone to pick him up and did not want anyone to know that he was discharged, he planned to go back by himself. However, he did not expect to be stopped by reporters. Now, everyone in the country knew that he had been discharged.

He sat in the car, feeling a little upset. The taxi driver looked at Nox from time to time through the rearview mirror.

“Why are you looking at me?” Nox was unhappy about it.

“No, I’m just wondering, are you Young Master Nox? You were cheated on a few days ago…”

“Believe it or not, I’ll give you a bad review!” Nox exploded.

Everyone in the country knew him.

“I just want to say that a wise man accepts his pain, endures it, but does not add to it. Don’t take it too seriously.”

“I’ll be fine as long as you shut up,” Nox snapped.

After that, the driver did not dare to speak anymore..
