1338 Let’s Break Up, Finn

At the entrance, Monica had been taking care of Brandon, while Finn had been watching coldly from the side.

The receptionist at the door stepped forward respectfully. “Sir, ma’am, the car I called for you has arrived.”

She turned around and saw a taxi parked at the entrance. Monica helped Brandon up from the wall. “The car is here. I’ll send you back.”

Brandon nodded. It was obvious that he felt very uncomfortable after getting drunk, so he could not refuse. He then placed all his weight on Monica’s body. The two of them walked unsteadily toward the taxi.

The car door had already been opened respectfully by the receptionist. Monica helped Brandon into the back seat of the car and prepared to sit in it herself. Her arm was suddenly shackled by a powerful force.

Monica frowned slightly. Because he was very strong, it was a little painful. She turned around to look at Finn and said bluntly, “You can sit in the front passenger seat.”

Finn did not seem to be listening to her at all. He dragged her to the side.

“Finn, what are you doing? Let go of me!” Monica resisted.

She felt that Finn was acting out of character today.

Finn did not care about Monica’s resistance at all. She dragged Monica toward the side of the road to hail another taxi.

“Let go of me!” Monica resisted.

No matter how much she resisted, it was useless under Finn’s powerful strength.

She gritted her teeth. “What exactly do you want?!”

Finn tightened her grip on Monica’s arm. The strong force put Monica in pain.

“Let go of me!” Monica kept pushing him away. The more he pushed her away, the stronger Finn’s strength became.

As for Finn, this was nothing to him. After all, he was not the one feeling the pain he was causing and he did not know how much pain she was in.

Monica’s eyes were red and teary. She was in a daze. She really felt that she and Finn had come to an end. She was really tired.

Between them, apart from the fact that sex was something that all lovers did, nothing else was. They barely felt like a couple and merely forced the relationship to work.

She said, “Finn, let’s break up.”

Finn’s fingers stopped moving.

He stared at Monica intently. He saw that her eyes were very red, but her face was determined with a calm voice.

It did not seem like she was acting on impulse.

“Have you finally fallen in love with another man?” Finn questioned her.

Other men?!

Brandon?!

Sometimes, Monica really did not want to explain. She felt that explaining was unnecessary because when it came to Finn, there was no difference. They no longer had any feelings for each other, so there was no need to dwell on the reason for the breakup.

Finn looked at Monica who was silent. The anger on his face was obvious. He said coldly, “Monica, your feelings are still so shallow!”

Shallow?!

Monica smiled.

Right, her feelings were shallow. It meant that she could fall in love with anyone very quickly and always loved doing so, whereas he would not do so. He could freely control his emotions and be reserved and noble.

She really did not want to retort or say anything more. If the two of them could communicate, they would have come to an understanding long ago.

She even wondered if the reason why they were together again was because of their spite for each other—he was bitter that she had left him like this back then while she resented they parted ways even after she had loved him for so many years.

That car accident put a stop to their resentment and they ended up together again. It was only after they got together that she realized that they were no longer compatible.

They were not a good fit for each other anymore. Yet, they were still together even though they knew this fact.

She felt very stupid, but now was the time to face reality.

She said, “Finn, that’s it. I’ll come and move my things tomorrow.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Fortunately, she did not agree to the marriage impulsively back then. Otherwise, she would have to go through a divorce procedure. Maybe the people at the city hall would think they were crazy.

She moved her arm and shook off Finn.

This time, Finn let go of her hand.

Monica smiled again.

That was right, she was not the only one who wanted to leave.

Anyway, she would always be the bad guy.

She walked past Finn. She felt that there was no need for them to say more between them.

The two of them walked further and further away, and no feelings remained between them.
