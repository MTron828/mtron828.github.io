1122 The Identity of the Duncans’ Descendent Exposed

Alex nodded.

At that moment, he looked at Nox.

Nox’s eyes moved slightly.

He had just scolded the guy, and then he was caught red-handed. Now, he had to face it. No matter what, he felt a little embarrassed.

“I once told Finn that I was very envious of Edward. I’m envious that he can get married and have children normally. I’m envious that he can have a reasonable identity and go out whenever he wants. Unlike me, before I became William, I was always protected and monitored in a house. Other than the people who were with me, the only people I could come into contact with were you, Edward, and Finn. I watched all of you training desperately for me. I watched all of you constantly get injured to protect me. I’ve been watching you guys do a lot of things that you can’t control. However, you have no idea how envious I am of you guys. I envy the two of you that you can support each other, grow up together, and become each other’s most important brothers. But I can’t.”

“I can’t have friends, I can’t have brothers, and I can’t even have emotions. I once said that I wanted to see Edward and for him to accompany me. The teacher who had guided me, taught me the art of politics, and accompanied me the most knelt in front of me for a day and a night. He said that the fact that I still had the mood to think about other things mean that he did not educate me well. He also said that I had wasted the Duncans’ great plan. From then on, I didn’t dare to show any of my emotions. I didn’t even dare to say that you guys were my friends anymore. I even thought that if I said it one more time, you would be secretly killed.”

Nox’s throat moved slightly.

Upon hearing Alex’s words, he was slightly moved even though his tone of voice sounded calm and even emotionless.

That lack of emotion was true and not an act. It was an instinct that he had trained himself to have over a long period of time.

“Finn said that I shouldn’t envy Edward. After all, he’s the same as me, he doesn’t have his own life. He also doesn’t have his own life or the right to choose his life and death.” Alex’s tone was calm again as he said indifferently, “Even at this moment, it’s the same. He can’t choose to let me save him; he can only die for me.”

Edward pursed his lips.

Nox also felt… an indescribable emotion.

“Nox, actually, I’m still envious that his life is different from mine, that he has the company of you and Finn growing up together! You can’t understand what it feels like to grow up alone in a black room, to imitate someone else’s life, and to destroy your feelings. Even now, I don’t want to kill you, but I don’t even feel sad that you have to die. I just think that it’s a pity for you to die now.”

“You don’t have to say anything.” Nox looked at Alex. “I’ve never really blamed you. I know you’re tired, and I know what you’re shouldering. Hurry up and give the order. I won’t hate you.”

Alex chuckled.

In fact, he did not care if they hated him or not.

He said all that because if he did not say what he had been suppressing in his heart for a long time, he would not have the chance to tell them again.

His fingers moved slightly before he raised his hand. That action was to order everyone to open fire at Kingsley, Edward, Nox, and Kerby.

There was no need to keep them alive.

At that moment, Zachary still had some emotions. The deep wrinkles on his aged face seemed to be trembling.

However, he clenched his fists and suppressed his emotions.

Wade was naturally the same. No matter how unruly Nox was usually, Nox was still his grandson…

Her eyes were red, but he could only watch helplessly as everyone raised their guns and aimed at his grandson.

At that very moment, when everybody was about to fall, Edward suddenly flipped his hand and grabbed Kingsley’s gun before pinning Kingsley to the ground.

The bullets flew over their heads.

If they had not bent down, they would have really died.

Nox and Kerby rolled on the ground because of Edward’s actions. The moment they rolled on the ground, Kerby pointed the gun at Nox.

Nox reacted quickly by grabbing Kerby’s arm and firing a bullet into the sky.

The next second, Kerby’s head was being aimed at by a dense number of pistols.

Kerby was shackled, and so was Kingsley.

Edward aimed his gun at Kingsley’s head with fingers trembling uncontrollably. They could not stop shaking.

On the contrary, Kingsley was relieved.

That was because he was the one who made Edward do it. Otherwise, he would not let Edward have his way so easily.

When Alex had said those words, Kingsley had whispered in Edward’s ear, “Kill me!”

Edward suppressed his strong emotions.

On one hand, he had to cooperate with Alex’s acting, but on the other hand, he struggled to decide whether he should listen to Kingsley’s arrangements.

In the current situation, everyone was going to die.

Kingsley could no longer leave, and Alex would not let Kingsley go because of Edward.

In the end, they would die together, so the only choice he had was to live while Kingsley died.

Edward pulled the trigger, but he did not make a move.

No one stepped forward as well. Under Alex’s orders, they took two steps back and left the stage for Edward.

Alex was waiting for Edward to make his own decision.

If Edward killed Kingsley with his own hands, he would not have to kill Edward. However, if Edward went soft on Kingsley, Edward really would have to die.

Zachary looked at his son unexpectedly subdue Kingsley at that critical moment when Kingsley lost his focus. However, Edward did not shoot.

Zachary held his tongue as he also knew that he could not say anything at that moment.

Edward had to make the choice himself. Otherwise, he would not be able to gain the trust of the Duncans.

“I’ll leave Jeanne to you,” Kingsley said his last words.

His voice was very soft. In fact, he was just mouthing it. However, Kingsley knew that Edward would be able to understand, and Edward understood because he nodded.

After that, a gunshot sounded, and the bullet went through his head.

In an instant, it passed through. He did not feel any pain as he looked at the man in front of him with red eyes.

In fact, there was no need to feel sad.

He once said before that everything was natural selection. If he was dead, it would be because he was not capable enough.

The Hills, the Sanders, the Duncans, and the Swans would all come to an end. He was just the first one to withdraw from history.

There was no need to be emotional about that, but of course, he could not dent that he still involved his emotions to choose to let Edward live.

...

There was no reason other than the only man he could trust and protect Jeanne in this world was Edward.

He was willing to hand Jeanne over to the man personally.

After that, he could die without regrets.

In fact, he did feel a little regretful. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

A face suddenly appeared in his mind — a clean face.

It turned out that he was not indifferent to Lucy and that Jeanne was right about Lucy becoming the greatest regret in his life.

Unfortunately, it was too late. If there was a next life for him to make up for this regret... how good would that be?

Kingsley closed his eyes.

Just like that, he died in Edward’s hands.

Nox had already walked to Edward’s side.

He looked at Edward, whose body and eyes were covered in blood.
