1304 Drunk and Sleepy, Meeting Paige

“Monica, I want to go to your house,” Brandon said drunkenly.

Monica was speechless.

If he could not hold his liquor, then why did he drink it so desperately?

He drank so much that he could not even think clearly.

She asked again, “Brandon, where exactly is your house?!”

Brandon was already sprawled in the car, unable to wake up no matter how hard he tried.

Monica also knew that drunk people were most afraid of being woken up midway. It would be very uncomfortable.

She thought for a moment and said to the driver, “Let’s go to a nearby hotel.”

It was impossible for her to bring Brandon to her house.

Although they had a good relationship when they were young and Brandon had indeed stayed over at her house because they were neighbors, they were all grown up now. Moreover, they were not related. No matter what, she could not simply bring him to her house.

The driver drove them to a five-star hotel nearby.

Monica helped Brandon out of the car.

Brandon’s entire body was pressed against Monica’s body. Monica was almost crushed to death by him.

With much difficulty, she booked a room for him and sent him to his room.

Brandon seemed to be very uncomfortable. He muttered, “I want to vomit…”

“Huh?” Monica did not hear him clearly.

All she wanted was to send him to bed and leave on her own.

She must have been hit in the head by the door earlier to have Brandon drink for her.

This drunkard was simply too difficult to please.

“I said, I want to vomit… Ugh!” Brandon’s body trembled a few times.

And then, he threw up.

On Monica’s body.

She even had the thought of killing someone! Did this guy have to be so disgusting?

“Urgh!” Brandon vomited non-stop.

It made Monica feel like killing someone.

After an unknown period of time, Brandon seemed to have done retching.

He seemed to have sobered up a little. He looked up and saw Monica looking at him with a dark expression.

When Brandon saw the vomit on Monica’s body, he panicked and said incoherently, “I’m sorry, Monica. I’m sorry. I-I didn’t know. I thought I was at home. I thought… there was a toilet bowl in front of me…”

“So you think I’m a toilet bowl?” asked Monica.

“No, no, no, no. I’m a toilet bowl. I’m the dirtiest. I-I-I-I-I’ll help you wipe it clean…” As he spoke, he wanted to tidy up Monica’s clothes.

“Forget it.” Monica pushed him away.

She knew that Brandon had woken up.

She strode into the room.

She was so close to the room, yet Brandon still could not control himself.

The moment she walked into the room and closed the door.

She turned around, opened the door, and instructed Brandon, who had completely stiffened, “Go and get another room. Also, get the janitor to clean up the vomit you threw up in the corridor.”

She closed the door again.

Monica went straight to the bathroom and took off her clothes. Naturally, it was impossible for her to wear them again.

It was already so late, and she did not want to trouble anyone to send her clothes, so she could only make do at the hotel for the night.

Plus, it was the weekend tomorrow, so she did not have to work.

When she woke up tomorrow, she could get the mall to send a set of clothes over.

It was that simple.

Monica took a shower, put on a bathrobe, and lay on the hotel bed.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Monica frowned. Through the peephole, she saw Brandon standing outside and opened the door.

Brandon stood at the door awkwardly and cautiously. “I’m sorry, Monica, I…”

He probably felt bad that he had vomited on her today.

“Didn’t you get drunk to shield me from drinking?” Monica appeared magnanimous. “Let’s call it even.”

Brandon nodded silently. He still felt a little apologetic.

“It’s getting late. Go to bed early. I’m tired too.”

“Monica, I asked the hotel to make some carrot ginger apple juice. You’ve also drunk alcohol earlier. You’ll feel better after drinking it. It should arrive in a bit. Have it before you sleep.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

Her stomach was indeed still a little uncomfortable.

“Then I’ll head back to my room. I’m right next door. Let me know if you need anything. I’ll be one call away.”

...

Monica smiled faintly.

What needs could she have? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She said, “Okay, rest early.”

“Good night, Monica.”

“Good night.”

Brandon left and Monica closed the door.
