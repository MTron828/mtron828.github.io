1199 Monica, Let’s Start Over Again

When Edward returned to Bamboo Garden, Jeanne was still in a deep sleep.

He walked over and sat by the bed. As soon as he sat down, Jeanne woke up with a start.

She was still so easily awakened. It was as if her sleep had never been peaceful. The slightest movement would make her open her eyes and put up her guard.

When she saw that it was him, she let her guard down and leaned over naturally. She lay in his arms like a cat and asked, “Where did you go?”

It turned out she knew that he had left.

He answered, “My dad was looking for me.”

“What for?”

“Nothing good.”

“I thought so too.” Jeanne placed her face on his chest.

The sound of his heart beating was very intense.

She said, “When you were unconscious, I listened to your heartbeat every day.”

“Were you afraid I’d die?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

“I won’t die.” Edward enunciated every word.

“I know,”

“Do you want to go out for a walk?” Edward asked her.

Stunned, Jeanne got up from Edward’s arms. “Now?”

“No.” Edward laughed. “In the future.”

“Can I?”

“I don’t know,” Edward said.

“If there’s a price to pay, I don’t have to go out.”

“You’re willing to stay here forever?” Edward seemed a little surprised.

“Have I not told you that I actually love you very much?”

Edward thought about it for a moment before he smiled and said, “I don’t think so, but I know.”

“You do?” Jeanne frowned.

“Otherwise, do you really think I would give up my life for a woman who doesn’t love me?” Edward laughed.

“Alright, then” Jeanne gave up on confessing.

That guy did not care anyway.

“Jeannie” Edward called out to her gently.

“What?”

“If I say that this isn’t eternity, will you be afraid?”

“I won’t,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Edward looked at her.

“All the happiness we have now is stolen, so I don’t expect it to last forever.”

“But I do.” Edward lifted Jeanne’s chin.

Slowly, he planted a kiss on her lips.

Jeanne responded almost immediately by wrapping her arms around his neck and returning the kiss passionately.

It was true. One second passed, and they lost one second of happiness.

…

At South Hampton City Central hospital, Finn showed up in Monica’s ward every day.

Although he came every day, he did not say much or do anything. He just stayed for a while and then left, only to come back after a while.

He came very frequently.

Monica, on the other hand, really did not know what Finn was up to. Sometimes, she even wanted to tell him to say whatever he had to say and she could answer any of his questions.

However, it had been a week. Finn did not say anything, and neither did she ask anything.

Today, her mother and Sarah had gone to accompany his father for a consultation.

Monica finally believed that miracles really existed in this world — that there would be a rainbow after the storm — because on the third day after she woke up, her father, Gary, also woke up.

Under the careful treatment of an international specialist, he woke up.

Although he still had to stay in the intensive care unit for a while, he was out of the critical period and would be out of the intensive care unit in another eight to ten days.

After that, he would be able to leave the hospital after a month or two.

Monica was thinking about her family’s future when she saw Finn suddenly sitting in front of her bed, and only two of them were in the ward.

Out of the last few days, it seemed to be their first time alone together.

Monica felt that this time, Finn would probably tell her. Since there were no outsiders, he would probably say everything he wanted to say.

Yet, nothing happened. Finn just sat by her bed in silence and did not say a word.

Monica really did not know what Finn was going to do. Perhaps he did not want to do anything and just wanted to wash away his guilt.

...

Hence, she moved her body, wanting to get out of bed.

The next day after she came out of the intensive care unit, she started to try to get out of bed. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Every day, she would take one step, two steps, three steps, and now, she could walk for half an hour, one hour…

The doctor said she could be discharged in a week at most, but she thought that she would wait for her father to join her so that her whole family could leave together.

Just as she moved, Finn had already reached out to support her.

However, Monica refused and said, “No, I can do it.”
