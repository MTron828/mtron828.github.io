“Eden, don’t we have any feelings for each other–” Jasmine was on the verge of breaking down. She did not expect that Eden would treat her like that now.

Eden’s face was full of disgust, and he really did not plan on hiding it!

“Feelings?” Eden sneered, “What feelings can I have for you? Back then, if you did not plot your way into my bed and just happened to satisfy my body when I was young and impulsive, did you think I would like you? As for now...”

Eden glanced at Jasmine from head to toe with that contemptuous look of his, like he was disgusted by her.

It made Jasmine feel extremely ashamed.

He said mercilessly, “Now, I’m sick of it. Even when you’re naked in front of me, I’m not interested in you anymore!”

“Eden!” Jasmine’s pride was greatly insulted.

She could not help but lift her hand to slap Eden’s face.

However, Eden grabbed Jasmine’s arm, rendering her immobile.

“Eden, I never thought you were such a man. What’s the difference between you and those men outside? You–”

“There’s no difference. You’re no better!” Eden pushed Jasmine away.

Jasmine lost her balance and almost fell under the bed.

Eden did not pity her at all. Instead, he said, “You used your body to seduce me back then, and now that your body doesn’t attract me, you as a person don’t either! Jasmine, I advise you to behave yourself and know your place in the family. One is as a maid who takes care of me and lets me vent. If you’re a little more obedient, I can still tolerate you for another two years. Otherwise, I don’t mind finding some groundless crimes and kicking you out of the Swans!”

......

“Eden!” Jasmine could not believe that Eden would really say those words one day.

What did he mean by a maid?

She was the dignified eldest young mistress of the Swans, for crying out loud!

“Get lost!” Eden did not seem to want to talk to Jasmine anymore.

He did not even want to look at her anymore!

Jasmine’s eyes were red with tears. She did not expect Eden could be so cruel when he wanted to be.

Then, she thought about it carefully.

Back then, he was just like that to Jeanne too.

Although the outcome of everything was her and Jenifer’s scheme that led Eden to treat Jeanne like that in the end, Eden was the one who decided how far he wanted to take it.

When that man was ruthless, he really... would be very ruthless.

She should have known long ago!

She just looked at Eden coldly, watching him having no consideration for her feelings.

At that moment, she was also very clear that if they continued like that, her and Eden’s relationship would definitely end.

However, she would not let such a thing happen. Not to mention, she still loved Eden very much.

Even if she did not love him anymore, she could not be chased out of the Swan family. It was not easy for her to marry into the family. How could she let herself leave in such a sad state?

She definitely would not repeat Jeanne’s mistake!

She was trying to calm herself down — something she learned from her mother.

Jenifer’s greatest ability was that no matter how angry she was, no matter how much she broke down, no matter how aggrieved she was, she could control her emotions. She could please the man with a smile on her face so that the man did not feel guilty toward her or pitied her. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, Eden was different from Alexander.

Eden was a man with bigger ambition, more realistic, and more ruthless.

That way, she could not gain anything by using her weakness. If she wanted to get back together with Eden, she had to be able to help Eden.

From Eden’s tone just now, she could guess that Eden must have had a bad day at work, and those issues should be related to Jeanne!

She silently composed herself before saying, “Eden, did you know I went to the hospital today?”

“Jasmine, can you be a little more self-aware? What does going to the hospital have to do with me? Even if you die, it has nothing to do with me!” Eden, when furious, was merciless toward Jasmine.

Jasmine suppressed the pain in her heart.

She looked at Eden, the man whom she had loved for many years, and said, “I’m pregnant.”

Eden was stunned when he heard Jasmine’s words.

Pregnant?

He looked straight at Jasmine.

They had been married for more than two months. Although he had become less and less affectionate toward Jasmine, he still needed to satisfy his needs.
