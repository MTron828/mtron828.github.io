1141 The War Has Started: Finn in Danger

“How do we fight for more time?”

“By using George to threaten Jeanne.” Alex explained, “Jeanne is the mastermind behind all this, and the only way I can think of to keep her in check is George.”

“George is Fourth Master’s son.” Finn had no choice but to say, “While threatening Jeanne, we’re also threatening Fourth Master.”

“For the country, many people will have to be sacrificed. Edward will understand.”

“I don’t think we have to use George to achieve that,” Finn expressed his opinion. “Moreover, we might not be able to achieve what we want.”

“If you have something to say, just say it.” Alex had been trained since he was young to learn all kinds of political tactics, so no one knew how shrewd he was.

Perhaps even Edward did not know.

At that moment, Finn wanted to negotiate with Alex. “It’s true that George is very important to Jeanne, but is George important to the Sanders? Using George to threaten Jeanne could only threaten her but not the Sanders. I even think that if we use George to threaten Jeanne, the Sanders will be ruthless to George! It’s undeniable that if the Sanders do anything to George and hurt him, Jeanne might break off ties with them, and you’ll have achieved your goal.

“But have you thought about it? Jeanne has already helped the Sanders. Even if she no longer helps them, they’re already on the right track. So, if you threaten Jeanne, it won’t help much with what you’re going through now.”

There was silence on the other end.

Alex seemed to be thinking about what Finn said.

“There’s another important point.” Finn did not hide anything. “The harm caused to George will not only concern Jeanne but also Fourth Master. Jeanne will break off relations with the Sanders because of this, and Fourth Master will also break off relations with you because of this. I hope you can be more cautious when it comes to family.”

“That’s why I said I envy Edward. It’s because there are always people around Edward who sincerely care about him,” Alex said bluntly.

“You have one too.” Finn said, “You have Fourth Master, don’t you?”

The other party was stunned.

“Between you and Jeanne, Fourth Master still chose you.”

It was obvious that he had chosen Alex. Otherwise, Jeanne and Edward would not be at odds with each other as they were now.

“I have an idea that can distract the Sanders and buy you some time,” Finn immediately said.

He finally revealed his plan.

In fact, Alex had expected that.

Finn would not take the initiative to call him unless it was something very important. Otherwise, he would not waste his time.

“I have a copy with me. It’s about all the crimes the Sanders’ have done to control the economy of Harken. Once it’s exposed, the Sanders will be too busy taking care of themselves. After all, this is related to the Sanders’ reputation. As the leader of the country, Warren will have to convince the public. If it causes internal strife and causes the citizens to revolt against the Sanders, it would be difficult for the Sanders to manage Harken. So, they’ll think of ways to suppress this matter first,” Finn said straightforwardly.

They had to rejoice that at least for now, the Sanders were in the open while they were in the dark.

The people in the dark could operate on more things and did not have to worry too much.

“This was something that Fourth Master had me prepare the day before he was arrested. However, before he could give me any instructions the next day, we lost contact. I’ve always thought that Fourth Master might come out, but I didn’t expect that a week has passed and there’s still no sign of him coming out. So, I could only bypass Fourth Master to report to you.” Finn explained his reason.

“Publicize it.” Alex did not hesitate to give him an order.

“Alright.” Finn agreed immediately.

“Other than distracting the Sanders, try to think of a way to force them to release Edward.”

“I know.” In fact, Finn already had everything planned out.

Otherwise, he would not have gone to look for Alex.

“Be careful,” Alex reminded him.

Once the Sanders found out that this matter was related to Finn, Finn would become the Sanders’ next target.

“Yes.”

The other party did not say much and hung up the phone.

Since he had achieved his goal, there was no need to say more. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Finn also quietly put down his phone.

In fact, he only contacted Alex a week later because, on one hand, he wanted to wait for the progress of Edward’s imprisonment. If it was just a smokescreen, he would not be in a hurry for quick success and would wait for Edward to come out before making further arrangements. However, that was obviously not the case. The Sanders wanted to imprison Edward so that they could achieve their goal against the Duncans. Hence, he could not wait any longer. On the other hand, Alex’s reminder just now was right. Once he announced all the things the Sanders did, he will be involved, and the Sanders would probably deal with him. Once he was targeted, he would not be able to be in charge of many things. Therefore, he needed some time to arrange Gary’s follow-up treatment.
