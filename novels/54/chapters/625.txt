Chapter 626: The Cause of Jeanne’s Mother’s Death Revealed (Must Read)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What crime will my father be convicted of?”

“Intentional homicide,” the police said.

In the Harken, being convicted of intentional homicide was the death penalty, and it was carried out immediately. There was no such thing as a suspended sentence.

Jeanne fell silent.

However, the police consoled her, “The law is fair. This is what he deserves.”

“Okay.” Jeanne forced a smile. “Thank you for your hard work.”

“Of course.”

“Before I leave, can I see my father?”

“Wait a moment. I’ll help you with the paperwork.”

“Thank you.”

Jeanne waited at the police station for a while.

Half an hour later, she saw Alexander.

After being detained in the detention center for three days, his mental state seemed to have worsened.

His expression, which was originally dead, suddenly turned excited when he saw Jeanne. As if he had forgotten how bad his relationship with Jeanne was, he begged Jeanne madly. “Please help me get out of here. I’ll give you everything. Jeanne, please help me. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die like this. Hurry and help me...”

Towards Alexander’s excitement, Jeanne was numb. She did not have the slightest bit of sympathy for him.

However, she did not come here to see Alexander in such a sorry state. All she wanted to know was the truth as to what happened that year.

She said, “Dad, let me ask you something.”

Alexander quickly agreed, “Go ahead. I’ll answer whatever you say.”

“How did my mother die back then?” Jeanne made sure to enunciate each word.

Alexander suddenly became quiet.

Jeanne simply looked at him, who was obviously evading her gaze.

“Tell me honestly, and I will think of a way to plead with the judge so that, at least, you won’t be sentenced to death immediately.” Jeanne was very calm.

When faced with many truths, she could be so calm that it was frightening.

Alexander, on the other hand, was extremely flustered.

What did Jeanne mean by “Immediate death penalty”?

No. He did not want to die. He really did not want to die.

He looked at Jeanne in fear.

Jeanne was neither anxious nor impatient. She could still maintain her calm when Alexander did not answer her for a long time. “How did my mother die?”

“It was a car accident,” Alexander answered.

Jeanne looked at him. “How did my mother die?”

Her tone did not become more serious. Instead, it sounded quite grim.

Alexander did not expect that one day he would be forced into a corner by his daughter.

He said, “She really died in a car accident. At that time, she drove drunk–”

“My mother would never drive drunk.” Jeanne directly exposed his lie.

Kingsley had told her before that her mother was the same as her.

If she was drunk, she would be so drunk that she would not know what was going on. Not to mention driving, even walking would be a problem.

As such, her mother would never drive when she was drunk.

“I’ll ask you one last time. How did my mother die?” Jeanne’s cold voice could make one terrified.

Alexander looked straight at Jeanne.

Frightened by Jeanne’s cold aura, he did not speak for a long time until Jeanne stood up.

She said, “I won’t come to see you again until the day you’re executed. I’ll come to collect your corpse then.”

“Jeanne!” Alexander held onto her agitatedly.

Jeanne looked straight at him.

“Can you help me if I tell you the truth?”

“You can only trust me now. Otherwise, do you think Jenifer or Joshua has the power to help you?” Jeanne sneered.

Alexander gritted his teeth.

He said, “You can’t blame me for your mother’s death.”

Jeanne’s face was expressionless, but at that moment, the hand hidden behind her body had clenched into a fist.

“You should know that your mother and I have never had a good relationship. I liked her very much back then. I was attracted by her beauty the first time I saw her and did not despise her for being an ordinary employee of Lawrence Enterprise who had nothing. I courted her without hesitation and even married her. However, I didn’t expect your mother to have such a huge ambition. When I first started pursuing your mother, she looked down on me. At the same time, Jenifer, who was also a staff member of the company, was using all her means to seduce me. Back then, I really didn’t have the slightest interest in Jenifer. I only wanted to be with your mother. Moreover, your mother’s dislike towards me aroused my man’s desire to conquer her.”

Jeanne just listened quietly to her mother’s past.

Alexander said, “I lowered my dignity as a man and pursued your mother relentlessly for half a year. Everyone in Lawrence Enterprise knew that I, the great Young Master Lawrence, didn’t hesitate to put down my status to pursue an ordinary employee with no family background, but your mother was always indifferent to me! Just as I was about to give up, your mother suddenly agreed. At that time, I had already agreed to be with Jenifer. Even though I really didn’t have any feelings for Jenifer, in order to provoke your mother and not embarrass myself too much, I decided to be with Jenifer. However, I didn’t expect your mother to agree to be with me again. Later, when I thought about it, your mother was probably just lusting for love.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jeanne tried her best to suppress her emotions.

She knew very well that her mother was not lusting for love.

She listened as Alexander continued, “I really liked your mother, so when your mother suddenly said she wanted to be with me, I immediately dumped Jenifer and got together with your mother. Your mother even seemed afraid I would go back on my words and asked me to get married right away. At that time, your grandfather actually didn’t support me to get together with your mother. But because I liked your mother too much, your grandfather couldn’t do anything about it. In the end, he agreed.”

“I originally thought that after your mother and I got married, the two of us would be very happy, but...” As he thought about the past and those things he did not wish to bring up anymore, Alexander was filled with emotions. “I never thought your mother would marry me just for the sake of Lawrence Enterprise’s assets. She didn’t like me at all!”

Jeanne was surprised.

Was that the reason why they killed her mother?
