Chapter 56: Stay Away From Fourth Master Swan!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne brought George back to the Lawrence family’s home.

In the main hall, besides Alexander and Jenifer, there were also Phoebe and Paul.

Logically speaking, after the wedding, the relatives should have left.

Yesterday, Jeanne did not see Phoebe coming back with them. Why did she appear again?

She walked into the main hall.

Phoebe quickly called out to Jeanne, “Jeannie, George you’re back.”

Jeanne forced a smile.

Jenifer also called out, “I thought you’d come back later since you went to Monica’s place.”

“I didn’t have anything to do, so I came back first.”

“By the way,” Jenifer said, “George is six years old. Shouldn’t he be in primary school now?”

Jeanne did not think about sending George to school at all.

Phoebe quickly said, “There’s still a week before the interview at Angerburg Private Elementary School. I’m here with Paul to prepare for it. Do you want to go for the interview together?”

Jeanne was still thinking about it.

Alexander sat on the sofa with the newspaper in his hand and said disdainfully, “George doesn’t know anything. Can he pass the interview?! He’ll be a disgrace if he goes.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

“George is pretty good at playing the piano.” Jenifer played the role of a good person.

“Playing the piano? Angerburg is an international first-class elementary school, one of the top ten schools in the world. Can he get in just by playing the piano?! If it was that simple, would there be a need for so many people to rack their brains to find connections ?! All the children there have been trained since they were young!” Alexander put down the newspaper, and he said coldly to Jeanne, “If George wants to go to school, he can go to a better public school. Don’t think that I’ll help you pull some strings.”

“There’s no need for that,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Alexander would not be able to help anyway. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He glanced at Jeanne. “At least you know your place.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She lowered her head to look at George.

Fortunately, George’s temperament was the same as hers... He did not care about insignificant people at all.

She held George’s hand as they went upstairs.

Phoebe, who was downstairs, seemed to be a little regretful as she said, “If George had been raised like Paul since he was young, he would be qualified.”

“That’s why I asked you to raise Paul properly, right? Children nowadays are all shaped from a young age,” Jenifer said.

“It’s all thanks to your care for Paul all these years. Otherwise, Paul wouldn’t have been able to go to such a high-class school. Even if he did, he would still have to rely on you for his tuition fees.”

“Let’s not talk about that. As long as Paul can study well, money is a small matter to me. Can the Lawrences not afford to raise a child?”

“That’s true. Everyone says that you married well into a famous family in South Hampton City. My brother-in-law is also a good-looking man. The others are dying of envy for you...” Phoebe flattered.

An arrogant man like Alexander naturally liked to be flattered like this.

Jenifer knew this was what Alexander was like and always tried to win his favor such that he willingly gave her money to help her family.

“That’s enough. You’re too sweet! Come, let Paul recite the book for us again.”

Downstairs, it was harmonious.

Upstairs, Jeanne brought George back to his room.

Jeanne asked, “Do you want to go to school?”

“No.”

“It’d be weird if you don’t go to school,” Jeanne advised him.

George frowned.

“Go to school and kill time, okay?”

“You want me to go to Angerburg?”

Jeanne smiled. “Smart.”

“Do I have to go?” George was reluctant.

“If you don’t go, we’ll attract gossip. I don’t want to deal with it. Besides...” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. “It’ll feel good to slap some people in their faces.”

Seeing that Jeanne was in high spirits, George nodded. “Alright.”

“You’re so obedient.” Jeanne rubbed George’s little head.

Every time George was praised, he would easily blush.

Jeanne loved her son’s shy look. She thought that if a little girl liked George at school, it would be fun!

“Mom, what are you thinking about?” George was confused by Jeanne’s sudden smile.

“Nothing.” Jeanne came back to her senses. “I’m going to see what I need to prepare for the interview at Angerburg.”

As she spoke, she took out her phone and appeared very active.

Jeanne sat on the sofa and looked at the interview guide seriously.

Her phone suddenly rang.

Jeanne glanced at it and picked up the call.

“Did you miss me?”

“No.” Jeanne was speechless. ‘How many times does he want to ask?’

“You’re heartless.”

“Let’s get down to business.”

“Is Fourth Master Swan pursuing you?” The person’s tone instantly became serious.

Jeanne knew Kingsley wanted to talk about this.

She stood up from the sofa and walked to the balcony.

It was not that she did not want George to hear it, but there were some unimportant matters she did not need George to worry about.

She replied, “Yes.”

“Didn’t I ask you not to provoke him?”

“Do you think I provoked him?”

“Keep a distance from him.”

“I’m afraid that won’t do.”

“What?”

“I’ve reached an agreement with Fourth Master Swan.” Jeanne leaned against the guardrail and looked at the backyard of the Lawrences. She said nonchalantly, “Fourth Master Swan asked me to break the love and longing of the Sanders’ third princess for him.”

“You want to go against Harken’s imperial family? Did you take the wrong medicine?!”

Jeanne rolled her eyes. “Do you think I want to? I just want to get rid of my relationship with Fourth Master Swan.”

“You actually dared to agree to anything.”

“That’s why I need your help.”

“If you need my help, why did you wait for me to call you?”

“Help me find out if Melody simply likes Fourth Master Swan and wants to be together with him, or if the imperial family wants Melody to marry Fourth Master Swan!” Jeanne did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point.

“Is there a difference?”

“What do you think?” Jeanne asked.

The former provoked Melody, while the latter would affect Harken.

Jeanne had to know who her enemy was, right?!

“I’ll call you when I have news.” The person on the other end of the call was cold.

“Okay.”

“I’ll remind you again. Stay away from Fourth Master Swan!”

“Got it.” Jeanne hung up the phone impatiently.

She looked ahead.

Jeanne did not ask Kingsley why he kept telling her not to get close to Fourth Master Swan, but since he kept emphasizing it, it must not be a small matter.
