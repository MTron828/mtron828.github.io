When it entered Edward’s mouth, he did not even have the ability to swallow.

Hence, Jeanne took a sip of warm water and kissed him on the lips. Then, bit by bit, she sent the water into his mouth.

She did not send it too quickly because she was afraid that he would choke when he could not swallow properly.

In his current condition, he was likely to choke to death.

She fed the water into his mouth, bit by bit, and then stuck out her tongue to touch the pill that had begun to melt. The bitter taste was obvious on the tip of her tongue. With that, she moved the pill down his throat with the tip of her tongue before withdrawing it to take another sip of warm water and feed the water down his throat.

His body swallowed instinctively.

Jeanne used her tongue to make sure that he had swallowed the medicine before leaving his lips.

After that, she used the same method to feed Edward the next few pills.

“Do you still need some warm water?” Jeanne asked him.

“Give me a cigarette,” Edward said.

He was so weak that he could not even drink water, but every time he spoke, he could still speak clearly.

Jeanne nodded and lit another cigarette.

As soon as she placed it on his lips, he take a long, slow drag.

Jeanne helped him smoke, and the smoke slowly rose from his mouth.

When Edward finished a cigarette, he seemed to have regained some of his consciousness.

Even though his body was so weak that he might die in the next second, she could clearly see that his vision had a slight focus.

He was looking at her, and they looked at each other.

After some time, Jeanne said, “I’m the Hills’ eldest daughter, and Kingsley is my uncle.”

She was starting to lay her cards on the table and reveal her identity.

Edward looked at her and listened quietly.

“The Sanders and the Hills have always had dealings. Back then, the Hills and the Sanders overthrew the Duncans together, and all these years, they have maintained close contact with each other. It could be considered a mutual partnership, but we are also considered a killing tool of the Sanders,” Jeanne said bluntly.

She had nothing to hide. In fact, he could not hide anything from Edward. After all, he might already know.

Nevertheless, she still decided to tell him everything.

“Now, the Sanders wants us to find the descendant of the Duncans. However, after so long, we still haven’t found any clues. We don’t know where you’ve hidden this person, and we’ve never seen this person’s true face. I’ve also been by your side for so long, but I don’t have a clue who that person is.” Jeanne said, “And the only one who might have seen this person was Lucy, but you killed her…”

Jeanne paused.

She maintained her flat tone and said, “So, we can only use this method to get you to tell us who this person is and where this person is!”

Edward continued to look at Jeanne.

If he had not said those few words just now, Jeanne would have thought that he had lost his ability to speak.

She continued, “Edward, tell me who this person is, and I will let you go.”

“I can’t leave,” Edward said.

Finally, he said another sentence.

Even though it was only three words, Jeanne knew what he meant.

“The Sanders has given us an order. If you don’t tell us who this person is and where this person is, we’ll have to exchange your life for it. Of course, you may suspect that even if you tell us who this person is, we will still kill you to silence you. Perhaps the Sanders will also want us to do so, but I promise that as long as you tell us who this person is, I will protect you with my life and make sure you leave.” Jeanne was very serious in her attempt to persuade him.

However, Edward shook his head in silence.

“Kingsley will really kill you,” Jeanne told him calmly.

He knew.

“Kingsley won’t show any mercy. He has never failed in anything he wants to do. The Hills have made countless enemies over the years, and those who seek revenge on Kingsley will come one after another. M Underground Organization is just one of the many. Kingsley has destroyed too many such organizations, and there are many more that are stronger and bigger than us. That’s why he won’t show mercy to anyone. If you can’t satisfy his requirements, he will kill you.”

Edward knew that very well because he had secretly investigated Kingsley a lot.

He knew that Kingsley was powerful enough, which was why he approached the latter to work with him as soon as Jeanne was in trouble.
