“No need.” Nox refused.

“Not eating is good for your stomach,” the assistant advised.

“I’ll grab a quick bite later.” Nox, however, did not seem to care. He instructed his assistant, “You must supervise the progress of the work arranged during today’s meeting. It must be completed. Time is tight, and we have no time to lose.”

‘Yes.”

“I’ll leave it to you. I’ll head off now.”

“Goodbye, President Winter.”

Nox quickly got into the car and said to the driver, “Green Vine Kindergarten.”

“Alri?ht.” The driver quickly agreed.

“How long will it take to get there from here?”

“If there’s no traffic, half an hour should be sufficient.”

Nox looked at the time. “On the way, can you find a place where I can grab something on the go? I haven’t had lunch.”

He could feel that his stomach was already reacting. The main reason was that he did not have breakfast that morning, so he was starving.

“Alright,” the driver said respectfully.

The car stopped at a bakery, and the driver went down to buy a few pastries and a packet of juice for Nox.

Nox took it and ate two bites. Ever since he was young, he hated pastries the most. However, he endured it and ate two more mouthfuls, barely filling his stomach, before putting the remaining big bag of bread in the car and looking down at the time. Afraid of being late, Nox asked, “How much longer?”

It was already 1:30 p.m.

“Mr. Nox, there’s some traffic in front, and it should take us more than 10 minutes to get through it. We should expect to arrive around 2 p.m.”

“Can you hurry up?” Nox was a little anxious.

The event would start at 2 p.m. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I’ll go another way,” the driver quickly said when he saw that Nox was in a hurry.

“Anyway, we have to get there before 1:50 p.m.”

“Yes.” The driver quickly turned the steering wheel and drove to another road to bypass the traffic.

The bypass was much further away, so the driver was a little fast. To seize an extra two seconds, the driver sped past the traffic light when it was about to turn red, not noticing a motorcycle driving toward him from the left.

By the time he realized, it was too late to stop. Hence, he made a sharp U-turn, turned the car around, and slammed it into the guardrail beside him.

“Clang! ”

The guardrail was damaged by the car, and the front of the car was crushed.

Fortunately, the driver stopped and avoided the collision with the motorcycle. However, his head was bleeding from hitting the steering wheel bleeding, and his vision was blurry.

At that moment, the first thing he asked was, “Mr. Nox, are you okay?”

Nox had also hit the car seat in front of him, and his thigh was hurting.

However, he endured it. “I’m fine. How are you?” “I’m a little dizzy. I don’t think I can drive.”

“I’ll call an ambulance for you.”

“What will you do? Aren’t you in a hurry?” the driver asked, blaming himself. “I’ll drive myself there. You should wait here for the ambulance to pick you up.” “But…” The driver felt even more guilty.

Without pressing on the matter further, Nox gritted his teeth and opened the car door. When his right leg touched the ground, it hurt a little. However, he endured it and opened the driver’s door to help the driver out of the car.

“Wait here for the ambulance.”

“Mr. Winter, do you want to take a new taxi? The car was just hit. Shouldn’t we get it checked out?”

“No need. It shouldn’t be an issue.”

The driver wanted to say something else, but Nox had gotten into the driver’s seat. Then, he started the car, briefly confirmed the car’s performance, and stepped on the accelerator.

The driver watched as Nox left. He had no idea what was so big that Nox would rush over without a care for his life.

Nox drove to Green Vine Kindergarten as fast as he could. When he arrived, he

was still ten minutes late. It was 2:10 p.m.

He parked the car and even forgot to lock the door before he got out of the car. He ran straight to the entrance of the kindergarten, but the gate to the kindergarten was closed, and there was no one at the empty gate. He could vaguely hear the lively voices in the kindergarten.

Nox stood at the door, looking a little lonely. When he left in the morning, Shelly agreed to wait for him at the door. However, since he was late, Shelly did not wait for him, and it seemed like that had always been the case. He did not know how to cherish her in the past, and now that he was in love with Shelly, she did not want him anymore.

Nox smiled sadly and turned around, prepared to leave. Just as he had taken two steps, he heard a familiar child’s voice. “Uncle Nox.”

Nox thought he had misheard and did not dare to turn around.

“Uncle Nox, are you finally here?”

As the sound got closer, Nox turned around abruptly to see Bella running toward him with her short little legs. Behind Bella was Shelly, who did not call out to Bella, allowing Bella to charge madly toward him.

As Nox bent down and pulled Bella into his arms, Bella hugged Nox’s neck. “Uncle Nox, Mom and I have been waiting for you for a long time. I knew you would come!”

Nox also hugged Bella tightly. He felt like he was needed, and it felt good. Then, he turned to look at Shelly, who was also walking toward him.

When she stood before him, he said, “I’m sorry I’m late..”
