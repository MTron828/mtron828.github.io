Chapter 87: You Really Fell in Love With Michael?!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’m a doctor. Putting aside my identity as a man, I’m a f*cking doctor!” Finn really roared.

Monica stared at him with her mouth agape.

“Monica, are you really a blockhead? Can’t you think more about it?” Finn gnashed his teeth.

Back then, he was angry. He was really angry that Monica did not ask anything and just assumed that he was cheating on her.

Other than not trusting him and not loving him enough, what else could it mean?!

“Who are you to be with another man without asking anything? Monica, what do you want me to think of you?! What do you think I should think of you?” Finn questioned.

Monica bit her lip.

Her eyes were a little red. “But why was she at your place?”

Finn looked at her.

“Shouldn’t one be in the hospital to see a doctor? Why was she at your house? Why was she on your bed? I haven’t slept on that bed before. Why did you let another woman sleep on it?!” Monica calmed down, but she burst out again. “Now, you’re blaming me for not asking anything. Every woman would’ve thought that way when they’re faced with something like that!”

It was because Monica loved him that she felt so terrible! It was because she felt so terrible that she lost all her rationality.

“Have you listened to my explanation?”

“I waited for you!” Monica roared. “After I ran out of your house, I waited for you, but you didn’t come after me!”

Even though she felt terrible at that time, she still decided to listen to his explanation. She still wanted to listen to his explanation.

“How can you be so sure that I didn’t go look for you?!” Finn could not hide his anger.

“I waited for you in the garage for at least half an hour!”

“Garage?” Finn was stunned.

“Is there a problem?”

He went after her to the entrance of the residential area.

Monica looked at Finn. It seemed like they had a misunderstanding.

Actually, it did not matter anymore.

The last straw that made her give up was Patsy.

Monica cried like an idiot and waited in the garage. She told herself that Finn would definitely come to look for her, even if it meant breaking up. Nonetheless, what she received was a call from Patsy, and it was from Finn’s phone.

The words she said were still fresh in her mind.

“Don’t pester Finn anymore. We grew up together in the orphanage. We’ve been privately engaged for a long time.

“Finn doesn’t like you at all. It’s only because your father funded his studies. He just wants to repay his debt.

“Finn said that once you’ve had enough fun, he’ll be done repaying his debt and will be with me again.”

Finn would never know how cold and desperate Monica felt when she heard Patsy’s words.

She did not even know how she drove the car away and did not die in a car accident.

“Perhaps we did have a misunderstanding.” Finn lowered his voice.

Monica’s tears welled up in her eyes, but she forced them back.

“I thought you didn’t love me enough, but you thought I abandoned you,” Finn said faintly.

At the end of the day, in that relationship, even though Monica was the one who took the initiative, Finn was the one who felt insecure.

There were so many outstanding men around Monica. Why would she fall in love with him, who was not handsome enough, had no money, and did not know how to please girls? In that place where the upper-class society was the cream of the crop, his inferiority complex would make him lose his confidence. He would lose confidence that Monica truly loved him. Therefore, when Monica and Michael kissed in front of him, he gave up.

It was very important for them to be of equal status.

Finn might just be consumable for Monica. Once he was done being used, he would be thrown away.

“Let’s start over,” Finn said very seriously.

He was very serious.

Monica’s heart did not waver. She just asked him calmly, “What about Patsy? How do you plan to settle her down?”

“She and I don’t have the relationship you think we have.”

“What exactly is your relationship?”

Finn was a little silent.

“Patsy has heart disease?” Monica asked. “Because she can’t stand stimulations, you have to take care of her all the time?”

The plots in novels crossed her mind just like that.

“No. She’s very healthy.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Very healthy? Finn, don’t you think your words are a little contradictory? If she’s very healthy, why did she need to lie naked on your bed and let you examine her body?”

“Give me some time to explain about Patsy.”

“Why should I give you time?” Monica sneered.

“Trust me, Patsy and I are innocent.”

“If you don’t explain it clearly, how can I trust you?”

“Monica,” Finn called her gently.

Monica’s throat moved slightly.

“Can you trust me just this once?” Finn’s tone was begging.

He was begging her not to make things difficult for him.

Monica’s heart was still aching.

It was not that she did not believe him.

In the past, they might not have gotten to know each other that year, but now that they had lived together for another three years, even though they did not have much interaction, she had a rough idea of what kind of man Finn was. At least he would not lie or play around with her feelings.

Monica said, “Okay, I trust you.”

Finn seemed to be smiling.

At that moment, Monica even felt that his eyes, which had never changed for thousands of years, were filled with a smile.

Despite that, her next sentence completely froze his smile.

Monica said, “Anyway, it doesn’t matter to me anymore. That’s your business, and in the future, your business has nothing to do with me. I’m together with Michael.”

Finn’s body stiffened as if he had been petrified.

Monica said, “Finn, I’m not interested in digging into what happened in the past. For a long time, I didn’t care who was right or wrong. If you hadn’t mentioned it, I might’ve forgotten about it. As for now, Michael and I are back together. I just told you that we started again tonight.”

“So I said so much earlier, but it was actually useless.”

“Yes,” Monica answered him directly.

“Do you love that man very much?” Finn’s throat was trembling.

“I’m happier with him than I am with you.”

Monica did not have much time to be happy with Finn. It was so little that she could not even remember.

Besides, she did not want to torture herself anymore.

“You really fell in love with Michael,” Finn said in a low and deep voice. There was not any emotion in her voice.

“Yes.” Monica nodded.

Finn nodded silently as well.

It was his 30th birthday present, yet it came so unexpectedly.

Finn turned around and went back to his room.

He suddenly stopped walking and said, “Let’s pretend that what happened tonight didn’t happen.”

“Okay.” Monica even smiled at that moment. “I’ll still treat you as a friend in the future. Even though you have a bad personality. You’re my father’s attending physician, so I don’t dare to offend you.”

Finn did not say another word.

He closed the door.

The moment he closed the door, Monica... burst into tears instead.
