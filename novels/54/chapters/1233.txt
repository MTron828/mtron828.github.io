1234 Their Conflict and Jeanne’s Compromise

The two of them were silent the entire journey.

When the car arrived at its destination, it was past 6 p.m.

The weather in May in South Hampton City was neither hot nor cold. However, the difference in temperature between morning and night was drastic, especially on windy nights.

The two of them had a candlelight dinner at the most famous Romance Valley in South Hampton City. The so-called Romance Valley was a restaurant halfway up a mountain in South Hampton City.

There were very few people in the restaurant, and the outdoor dining table was beautifully decorated. The restaurant only served three tables of guests a day, so they had to make a reservation long in advance. Of course, with Edward and Susan’s status, they did not need to do so.

The staff members opened the car door for them.

Edward got out of the car, and after getting out of the car, he turned around and held Susan’s hand like a gentleman.

Susan got out of the car and could not help but shiver and say, “It’s cold.”

Edward took off his suit jacket and draped it over her.

“Thank you.” Susan smiled sweetly at him.

“You’re welcome,” Edward replied politely.

Susan wrinkled her nose. That person was so cold that such an intimate act made her feel alienated!

She took the initiative to hold Edward’s arm, and with the help of the staff, they sat at the most beautiful dining table outdoors.

At that moment, because of the wind, the red candle was covered by glass. It made the light that emitted through the glass seem even more romantic.

“Have you ever brought Jeanne here?” Susan started the conversation.

Edward did not reply.

“I don’t think so.” Susan looked very understanding. “You’ve only been together with Jeanne for a short year, and so many things have happened in a year. I’m sure there was no time for you guys to do anything romantic. The most romantic thing in your relationship was probably your wedding.”

Still, Edward did not speak.

He was really just playing along with Susan, but Susan also knew that he did not have any feelings for her.

Coincidentally, the restaurant’s waiter served them dinner respectfully at that moment.

Susan also felt a little bored, so after the waiter served her meal, she started eating without saying anything else.

Edward, too, was eating slowly and elegantly.

Susan put down her knife and fork, took out her phone, and suddenly took a picture of Edward eating his food.

Edward raised his head to see Susan’s eyes fixed on the screen of her phone.

Feeling Edward’s gaze on her, her eyes were still fixed on the photo on her phone, to which she commented, “He’s really handsome.”

Seeing that, Edward continued eating his dinner.

Susan did not have much of an appetite at the moment. After all, for a woman who needed to maintain her figure, eating was just for the sake of posing for photos. Hence, she was focused on her phone.

A message popped up on her phone. “The news is out. Take a look.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Susan opened the news app.

As soon as she clicked on it, the headlines popped up: Fourth Master Swan Took Off His Suit and Put It On Ms. Gates, Showing His Love for Her.

She quite liked that title.

Susan clicked on the news and continued reading.

Most of the content described how they had dinner together and that Edward was afraid that she would feel cold so he took off his blazer and put it on her. As the photo was taken from a distance, their expressions could not be seen, but it looked like they were very intimate.

Susan read through the comments.

In just a short while, there were thousands of comments, seemingly very interested in their relationship.

Susan flipped through the comments for a long time until she saw one that read, “Poor Jeanne. Have you guys forgotten that when Fourth Master and Jeanne got married, he picked her up with rows of cars filled with flowers?”

Many people liked that comment, and many people replied to it. However, it was quickly drowned out by other well-wishes.

Naturally, a bunch of paid Internet ghostwriters were behind it.

Susan looked at her phone and said calmly, “I was in the entertainment industry when you and Jeanne got married. I must say I was really envious of how attentive you were to be able to pull off such a grand and sentimental wedding. At that time, I thought, what kind of divine being Fourth Master Swan was to do all this for a woman? What kind of goddess was Jeanne to be able to make a man love her so much?”

“What are you trying to say?” Edward raised his head and looked at her.

He seemed to have no interest in what she was saying and was even a little tired of it.

“I want to say that I hope to have a wedding as grand as that,” Susan said bluntly.
