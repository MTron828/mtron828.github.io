Chapter 102: I Agree to the Divorce

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica stared at Finn Jones with her mouth agape.

She watched as he walked out of the elevator somewhat tiredly. He did not show any indication that he overheard what she said. In fact, he acted as if he did not see her as he walked past her to the door, and unlocked the door with his fingerprint.

He even closed the door behind him.

Monica felt as empty as air.

“Monica.” Jeanne called her from the other end.

Monica came back to her senses after a long while. “Oh, I’m here. I’m here.”

“What’s wrong?”

“Finn’s back. I was startled.” Monica calmed her breathing.

“Did he hear everything you said?” Jeanne asked.

“He probably heard it…?” Monica replied. It was impossible for her to not hear it when she said it so loudly.

“But he didn’t care. Let me tell you, Jeanne. Finn Jones is a particularly cold-blooded person. I don’t think he has any emotions or desires. Didn’t he confess to me that day that he wanted to start over with me? I cried so much. Then he acted as if nothing happened and he went straight to his room. The next day, he was able to return to work on time. “I originally thought that it would be awkward for the two of them to face each other, but he didn’t react at all.”

Jeanne could actually imagine Dr. Finn’s attitude towards Monica after being rejected.

Monica continued, “Sometimes, I wonder how Finn grew up. Are orphans born with less feelings compared to normal children?”

“Most orphans are more introverted and less confident. It’s because they didn’t receive love when they were young, so they grow up feeling they don’t need love. Since you’ve rejected him, he sealed himself which makes one think that he doesn’t care at all.” Jeanne said.

“Are you studying psychology? You speak so eloquently on the topic.” Monica frowned.

“I’m just saying.” Jeanne smiled.

“You tricked me!” Monica was angry.

“Marriage is not a child’s game, Monica. Think about it carefully.”

“There’s no need to think about it.” Monica said. “Let’s not talk about it. I feel much better now that I’ve vented my anger. Tomorrow, I need to argue with my dad. I’m hanging up now.”

“Alright, talk later.” Jeanne replied.

Jeanne did not have the ability to predict the future. She knew that Micheal Ross was a complicated man, but it does not mean that he doesn’t love Monica. Although she felt that Dr. Finn loved Monica very much, she could not guarantee that he was as simple a man as she thought.

She always felt that those who were related or close to Edward Swan were no ordinary person.

…

After Monica hung up the phone, she unlocked the door and walked in.

Surprisingly, Dr. Finn Jones did not return to his room. Instead, he was cooking noodles in the large, open kitchen.

So he worked overtime till this hour and he didn’t even bother to have dinner earlier?

Monica just looked at Finn, checking if this man had any emotions.

Did he really not care about what she just said? It would seem so.

Monica turned around and was about to leave when Dr. Finn Jones suddenly asked, “Did you manage to see your dad today?”

“Oh, yeah.” Monica nodded. “How did you know?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Your dad called me.” Finn replied.

“What did he say?” Monica asked.

“Nothing much. He just asked if something happened between us.” Finn said.

“So, what did you say?” Monica walked back to the kitchen and looked at Finn.

Dr. Finn Jones kept his eyes on the noodles and answered, “I said that you and Micheal wanted to start over.”

“Finn Jones, how can you say that? My dad will beat me to death!” Monica was angry.

Finn looked up at her. “Isn’t it true?”

“Even if it is, you can’t tell my dad!” Monica’s face was full of displeasure.

“I’m not used to lying.” Finn replied.

Monica sat down in front of the bar counter in the open kitchen as she thought about how she would explain it to her dad the next day.

She had told her dad that there’s no shared feelings between her and Finn.

But now, the b*stard Finn told her dad that she was having an affair.

‘Damn it! I’m so angry!’ Monica fumed.

The two of them remained silent.

Finn prepared a bowl of noodles. He brought the bowl to the dining room and ate his dinner quietly.

Monica looked at his figure. At last, she asked, “You’ve been busy all day and you’re only eating this? It’s not nutritious at all.”
