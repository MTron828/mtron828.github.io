1105 You Can Have Any Identity But Not The Daughter of the Sanders

“Jeanne Sanders.”

Edward’s lips moved slightly as he muttered that unfamiliar name, “Jeanne Sanders... Sanders.”

He just sat there and watched the Sanders’ welcome Jeanne. He looked at the faint smile on Jeanne’s face and her eyes that did not fall on him for a second.

“We’re very grateful to Jeanne’s foster parents for raising her. Although they’re no longer around due to some special reasons, I’d like to thank them on behalf of the Sanders, thank them for returning Jeanne to us in one piece,” Chester said emotionally.

In fact, the only reason he thanked Alexander Lawrence’s family was so that the Lawrence Enterprise would still be under the Sanders’ control. Otherwise, according to the law, Jeanne was not Alexander Lawrence’s biological daughter, so she had no right to inherit the Lawrence Enterprise group. Besides Joshua and Jenifer, who were still alive and had been brought to justice, there was still Jasmine, who could inherit Lawrence Enterprise. The Sanders did that only to show that they recognized Jeanne’s identity, so it was not wrong for Jeanne to inherit Lawrence Enterprise.

“Jeannie’s return means that... Our family has another in-law.” Chester’s voice was high and full of emotion as he looked at Edward. “Can we please invite Edward on stage?”

The audience burst into applause.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

Without any hesitation, he stood up and walked up to Jeanne’s side under everyone’s watchful eyes. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Jeanne looked down, and their eyes did not meet.

Chester said to Edward, “When you and Jeannie got married, we didn’t know Jeannie’s identity. But now, as Jeannie’s elder brother, I hope you accept this belated blessing.”

“Thank you.” Edward appeared to be very respectful.

Chester patted Edward’s shoulder in relief before taking Jeanne’s hand.

Jeanne’s fingers moved slightly.

Then, Chester placed Jeanne’s hand into Edward’s.

Edward subconsciously held Jeanne’s hand pretty tightly.

Jeanne felt a little pain, but she did not show it on her face.

“I’ll leave my sister in your hands. Treat her well,” Chester said.

“I will.” Edward nodded.

“I think my father saw you alone before the wedding just now and has told you everything, so I won’t say much. However, I’ll add that Jeannie has just returned to our family, and we’d like to spend more time with her. You should bring her back more often. From now on, the Sanders and Swans are one family,” Chester said in a friendly manner.

“Yes, I’ll definitely bring Jeannie back to the Sanders more often.”

“Take her back to the banquet. My father is there,” Chester instructed.

Edward nodded and pulled Jeanne to the guest of honor’s seat.

Of the three seats reserved, two were to Warren’s right, and one was to his left. It was obvious that the two empty seats were reserved for Jeanne and Edward.

Edward pulled out a chair for Jeanne like a gentleman and let her sit next to Warren before he sat down next to her.

Warren looked at Jeanne lovingly.

The moment Jeanne sat down, Warren reached out and held her hand tightly. He said gently, “It’s good that you’re back.”

Jeanne smiled and replied, “Yes.”

“Eat more,” Warren said.

“Thank you, father,” Jeanne replied.

Edward sat at the side and listened to their conversation quietly.

Although it was Stacey’s wedding, Warren took care of Jeanne throughout the entire banquet. He was like a loving father of an ordinary family who doted on his daughter.

The banquet did not last long, and there was no toasting session

Everyone ate in silence, and after they ate, no one left. However, once everyone in the main seats left, the guests were arranged to leave one after another. Instead of having entertainment, everyone was sent to a large tea room to have a chat and have some tea.

Edward and Jeanne were sent to a bedroom in the Sanders’ house.

It was a bedroom that only a member of the Sanders had.

Warren had personally sent them over, and before he left, he said to Jeanne gently, “You guys should get some rest. After dinner tonight, I’ll get someone to send you back to the Swan family’s manor.”
