Chapter 535: Do I Deserve to Be Abandoned by You, Time and Time Again?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica was surprised to hear Finn’s calm voice.

He said, “If you want to help Michael, being with him isn’t the best or the only choice. We should think of a better solution.”

Monica sat up from the sofa and said, “There’s no better way. Right now, all the negative news about Michael is coming from him having an affair with me, so only by admitting that I’m in an official relationship with him can we solve this problem. Anything else will just be an excuse to the public. The more excuses we make, the more trouble we’ll get into.”

“That’s why we have to think carefully about how to solve this problem.” Finn was trying his best to calm himself down so that he could solve Michael’s problem.

“It’s useless. Michael has already thought it through. He wanted to use his previous image to make people forget about this, and he also tried to use his connections to get the officials in the political circles to give him a little help. However, all his attempts failed. More importantly, his father has passed away. Although it hasn’t been announced to the public, it’s true, and his father’s death means that Michael is all alone and helpless among the officials.” Monica also tried to keep herself calm as she told him, “We’ve thought of everything we can think of, and this is the only way.”

“Give me some time. I’ll discuss it with Fourth Master and Nox.”

“There’s no other way. Michael said there’s no other way, so there must be no other way. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have made things difficult for me.”

“Monica, can you trust me just this once?” Finn suppressed his anger, which was ignited by the unconditional trust Monica had toward Michael.

“Other than Michael, none of us know anything about politics.” Monica was certain about it.

Finn looked at her coldly.

Monica gritted her teeth and said, “Finn, you’ve always told me to trust you, so can you trust me just this once? Once Michael is back on the right track, I will leave him and return to your side. Everything I’m doing is only to help him, and other than that, I have no feelings for him! I promise you. Give me a year at most. If Michael hasn’t solidified his position within a year, and I’ve done my best, I won’t feel guilty toward him anymore. Then, I’ll return to your side–”

“So you’ve made up your mind to help him in this way?” Finn asked her.

“Yes.” Monica nodded firmly.

Finn’s expression was cold.

Monica said, “I won’t be staying here for the time being. Tomorrow morning, I’ll pick you up to go to the civil affairs bureau–”

“Monica,” Finn interrupted her.

Monica bit her lip.

“There’s no way I’ll wait for you.”

There was no way he would wait for her after she abandoned him.

At that, Monica felt a stab in her heart, but she said, “One year. It’s just one year.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I won’t wait for even one day,” Finn said straightforwardly. “You’d better think it through. Do you want to think of a way with me to help Michael, or do you want to break up with me and be with him?”

Monica said without hesitation, “I choose my way. I choose to help Michael by being with him.”

Finn clenched his fists.

Then, Monica picked up her crutches from the ground and stood up from the sofa.

She said, “I’ll go and find our marriage certificate.”

Following that, she went to the bedroom.

The marriage certificate was with Monica because Finn had never asked for them. After all, three years ago, the marriage between Finn and her was just an act.

However, three years later…

Her eyes were a little red.

If Finn really loved her, she believed that even if he was angry and could not understand her now, he would wait for her.

As long as he loved her, all he had to do was wait for her for one year.

When she found the marriage certificate, she saw a photo of both of them on it, looking serious. Back then, they both thought the other party did not love them, so they pretended to act aloof.

She picked up the marriage certificate and limped out of the room without dwelling on it anymore.

In the living room, Finn was still sitting there motionlessly.

She may not be able to convince Finn now, but she believed time could prove it all — that everything she did was really just to help Michael.
