Chapter 333: The Wedding: Jeanne, My Heart!

“What does Ms. Cardellini want me to do?”

“Confess,” Monica said firmly. “Fourth Master, confess your love to her.”

Jeanne was speechless.

Monica could really think of anything.

The others looked at Edward the same way, seemingly waiting for him to say something. Even Nox was extremely quiet as he waited.

He believed Fourth Master Swan was not the type who would say any lovey-dovey words. However, the more he thought so, the more curious he became.

Edward seemed to be thinking about what to say for a while. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Just as he was about to speak, Monica suddenly interrupted, “Wait.”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

Nox could not stand it anymore. He was very excited to find out what Fourth Master Swan would say, but Monica suddenly interrupted him.

The others in the room seemed to share the same feeling.

Nox could not help but say to Finn beside him, “What do you see in Monica? She’s so rude!”

Finn pursed his lips and did not answer. In fact, he did not know what he saw in Monica either. What was it?

......

He looked at Monica only to see her smiling so innocently, deliberately making things difficult for Fourth Master Swan. “I don’t want to hear things like I like you, I love you, and I’ll be good to you for the rest of my life. I’m sick of that. Come up with something special!”

Then, Monica suddenly thought of something.

She opened her mouth and said, “I read a book before, and I can’t remember the plot clearly. However, what I do have an impression of is that the male lead was extremely flirtatious when he got married. On the wedding day, the bridesmaid asked the male lead to confess to the female lead, and the male lead said, “If being sexy was a crime, you’d be guilty as charged.”

Everyone looked at Monica, speechless.

Monica smiled brightly. “Something like that will do.”

Sometimes, Jeanne did not know how Monica grew up to be so weird in upper-class society.

Edward glanced at Monica.

Monica looked as if she knew everything. “You must have wanted to sleep with Jeannie for a long time now.”

Jeanne could not allow Monica to be the bridesmaid next time, not even if she was beaten to death!

However… would there be a next time?

She pursed her lips, her face looking a little irritated.

By then, Edward had ignored Monica. He was standing in front of Jeanne when suddenly, he knelt on one knee.

As Monica watched from the side, she could not help but feel that Fourth Master Swan was very domineering even when he was kneeling.

On his knees, he said to Jeanne in his magnetic voice, “Jeannie, my heart!”

Jeanne’s heartbeat raced.

In fact, her heart had already begun to beat faster the moment Fourth Master Swan knelt on the floor. Then, when she heard his magnetic voice and said such poetic words, her heart began to beat even faster.

Everyone was somewhat shocked by his words too.

It was such a common poem, but just by changing the order of the words and cleverly putting her name in, it seemed to convey a different emotion.

It was a different and powerful sense of love!

It even touched everyone.

No, Monica’s little heart could not take it anymore. To be honest, that sentence did touch her a little as she thought it was very beautiful and moving.

She could not help but mutter, “The Fourth Master is really handsome.”

He was so handsome that she could not bear to make things difficult for him.

However, next to her, Finn heard her muttering loud and clear. As he looked at her, he saw, from her eyes, how moved and envious she was.

It was the kind of envy toward something good. Instead of being jealous, it came from a good place.

Finn’s eyes moved slightly, and he chose to ignore it.

After Edward confessed, he stood up, bent down, and carried Jeanne in a domineering manner.

Jeanne’s gown had a lot of layers to it, so she did not dare to act rashly either and hugged Fourth Master Swan’s neck naturally.

The staff quickly tidied the hem of Jeanne’s dress. Just like that, the two of them walked out of the room and went down the stairs, toward the Lawrence family’s main hall. From afar, they looked as beautiful as a painting, which made Monica suddenly stop in her tracks.

She felt that Jeannie was really blessed, and knowing that even made her eyes a little red. After all, she was easily touched by such a beautiful scene.

“Let’s go.” Finn reminded her as he stood beside her.

Monica did not bat an eyelid at him before she followed Jeanne and the others.

At the entrance of the Lawrence family’s manor, Monica was taken aback to see the row of luxury cars lined on the street in front of her.
