1125 The War Has Started: Will You Be Happy If I Die?

After killing Kingsley, he had no right to comfort Jeanne. What right did he have to comfort her after killing the most important person to her?

He should pay with his life now. Perhaps only then would Jeanne be moved. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At that moment, Jeanne asked, “Why aren’t you dead?”

Why was he not the one who died in the end?

Edward endured it.

“Didn’t you say you were prepared to die? Didn’t you say you loved me so much that you were willing to sacrifice yourself? But why did Kingsley die in the end?” Jeanne asked him coldly.

Edward’s throat moved.

He said, “Will you be happier if I die?”

“No.” Jeanne shook her head. “But at least I won’t regret falling in love with you.”

It was the first time Jeanne admitted that she loved him.

It was because she regretted falling in love with him and did not think it was worth it.

Edward’s Adam’s apple bobbed, and he continued to hide all the emotions he was feeling.

He said, “If I said I had no choice, would you regret it less?”

“No,” Jeanne said, “because Kingsley is dead.”

At the end of the day, Kingsley was dead.

The process was not important.

“I’m sorry.” Edward apologized because it did not seem to matter what he said.

In fact, there was no use in apologizing as well, but he did not know what else to say.

On the contrary, Nox could not stand it anymore.

He knew that once Kingsley was dead, Jeanne would put all the blame on Edward. No matter what happened, it would all be Edward’s fault.

He glared at Jeanne. “Did you think Edward wasn’t going to die just now? You’re back just in time for there to be no danger anymore. Why didn’t you appear a few minutes earlier? You would’ve known what Edward had to go through!”

“I don’t want to know,” Jeanne said coldly.

She coldly rejected all explanations.

“I’ll tell you even if you don’t want to know.” The thing that Nox could not stand the most was being wronged. It was worse than killing him. He said, “Edward tried everything he could to help Kingsley escape, but he failed at the last step. As for why he failed, I don’t think you’re stupid. You should be able to figure out that without more backup from the Hills’ assassins and with the Duncans requesting constant support, no matter how strong a person is, no one can hold their own!

“Even when Kingsley was surrounded, Edward was still trying to save him. He wanted to use Kingsley’s life to threaten Alex. That’s right. The Alex that you’ve been looking for had just shown up with Old Master Swan and my grandfather and made them watch Edward and I die. If Kingsley didn’t think that it wasn’t worth it for us to die with him and let Edward kill him, you would’ve seen Edward’s and my corpses on top of Kingsley’s. You’d be happier if you saw that, wouldn’t you?”

Nox questioned Jeanne, that heartless woman, harshly. If not for Kingsley’s conscience, they would all be dead!

However, Jeanne did not react. It was as if she did not hear what Nox was saying.

She was just silently taking in the pain of Kingsley’s death and could not pull herself out of it.

Just as Nox wanted to say something, the phone rang.

Nox gritted his teeth and looked at the incoming call. He quickly picked it up. “Grandpa Swan.”

“Bring Edward back. I have something to discuss with you both.” Zachary Swan’s voice was heavy.

Nox looked reluctant, but when it came to serious matters, he knew his limits.

He replied respectfully, “Yes, I’ll bring Edward back immediately.”

After that, he turned to Edward and said, “Your father has told us to go back. He said that he has something to tell us.”

Edward did not move.

“Let’s go.” Nox could not bare to see how badly hurt Edward was by Jeanne.

If he had not known that Edward would be upset, he would have shot Jeanne to death.

Nox forcefully pulled Edward back two steps, but Edward immediately pushed Nox’s hand away.

Nox was a little irritated.

Jeanne was just a woman. Why would Edward torture himself like that?

He watched as Edward walked to Jeanne’s side. “Give me some time, and I will give you an explanation.”
