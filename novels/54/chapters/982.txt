983 Scheming Against Michael, Kingsley’s Cruelty

At night, after taking a shower, Jeanne put on a bathrobe and sat in front of the hotel’s floor-to-ceiling window, smoking.

In the presidential suite of the five-star hotel, the scenery in front of him was as beautiful as a dream.

She put out the cigarette in her hand. Then, her slender fingers picked up the phone beside her and dialed a number

The call went through quickly. “Mom?”

“George.” Jeanne’s lips curled into a smile, and her voice was gentle.

“Did you miss me?” George asked her in his childlike voice.

He did not blame her for leaving without saying goodbye. However, his face was filled with anticipation.

Jeanne felt a lump in her throat.

She said, “I miss you.”

“I miss you too.” George asked, “When are you bringing me back?”

“It’s safer for you to follow Edward for now.” Jeanne rejected him flatly.

George was very disappointed, and it showed on his little face, even if Jeanne could not see it.

She said, “Tomorrow, get Teddy to send you to the address I’m giving you and help with Monica with something.”

“Alright.” George did not refuse and nodded obediently.

“Take care of yourself.”

“Mom,” George called out to her.

Jeanne’s eyes were a little red. The emotions that she had been holding back were starting to crumble.

“Will I see you tomorrow?” George asked.

“Maybe…” Not.

She had other things to do.

“I’ll come and see you before I leave South Hampton City.”

“It’s a deal.” On the other end, George broke into a smile.

It was a small promise, but it was enough to make George smile.

Actually, she was not a good mother because there was a limit to what she could give George.

She said, “It’s a deal.”

“Mom, you should rest early.”

“You too. Good night.”

“Good night.”

When Jeanne hung up the phone, her heart was still aching.

She had never truly given George a complete family, yet George had never resented her. He would even listen to her arrangements unconditionally.

George would do whatever she said.

Eventually, she calmed down.

She did not dare to make any promises or make anyone promise her anything.

She picked up her phone again. “Mason, are you free to come over?”

“Alright.” Mason agreed.

In less than a minute, there was a knock on the door.

Jeanne opened it and led Mason to sit on the sofa in front of the floor-to-ceiling window.

She offered him a cigarette, which he took. After that, Jeanne lit another cigarette for herself.

As the two of them smoked, Jeanne said, “Based on the current situation, it’s almost impossible to find evidence of Michael’s crime before 9:30 a.m. tomorrow.”

Mason nodded in agreement. “I just verified the information of that staff member again. According to my experience, it cannot be used in testifying against Michael.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Therefore, we can only make a bold guess.”

“What are your thoughts?” Mason looked at Jeanne.

He had spent a few years with Jeanne and had a period where he had a budding romance with her. However, to be fair, he did not think that Jeanne was a qualified assassin, so he did not take her seriously. Of course, she was the Hills’ eldest daughter. No matter how much he looked down on her, he did not dare to offend her.

“When we expose the quality inspection department tomorrow, Michael’s first thought will be to find a scapegoat.”Jeanne was analyzing Michael’s actions. “Who do you think he will look for?”

Mason frowned.

He had never thought about who Michael would look for.

Moreover, he had to admit that if he had not come back with Jeanne to gain a deeper understanding of the complicated relationships in South Hampton City, he would not be very familiar with Michael, Monica, and many people in the city. Therefore, it was indeed a little difficult for Mason to think of a person now.

In fact, Jeanne knew that as well. However, she said it so that Mason could tell her if there were any logical errors.

An assassin would not just rely on brute force.

To become the world’s number one assassin, not only must he be skilled, but he must also be more intelligent than others.

She said, “Brie. Do you think that’s possible?”

Mason frowned.

He had seen that name before.

In the pile of information on Michael that Jeanne had given him, there was quite a lot on that woman.

If he remembered correctly, she was the person Michael trusted the most.

Moreover, after what happened to Monica and Michael, that person was still working in the quality inspection department even though she had been demoted.

However, regarding the matter between Monica and Michael, Michael was indeed the one who was the most criticized. Everyone’s attention was on Michael, and they had completely ignored Brie, so no one cared about where she had gone!
