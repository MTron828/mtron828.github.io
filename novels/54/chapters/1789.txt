Chapter 1790: Shelly Starts to Care About Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Okay.” Nox replied, “I didn’t say anything, so you don’t have to explain yourself.”

Shelly pursed her lips.

Nox said, “Didn’t you say Bella needs an afternoon nap? Why don’t you go take a nap with her? I have something to do.”

“What is it?” Shelly blurted out.

“Do you want to know?” Nox asked.

He may look cold, but deep down, he was very nervous.

Stunned, Shelly said, “No, you can go ahead with your work I’ll take a nap with Bella.”

It turned out to be all wishful thinking. Shelly was just asking him casually and did not really care what he was up to. As long as he got a little closer to her, she would distance herself further away.

After he walked out of the house and entered the elevator, his phone rang. Nox took a look at it and picked up the call.

“Hello.”

“Mr. Winter, it’S me, Benjamin.” Nox’s eyes narrowed. “What’s the matter?” “I’m downstairs, and I’d like to see you.”

“I’ll be right down.” Nox agreed.

In any case, he had seen through everything and could accept any outcome. Hence, he walked to the door.

Benjamin, who was surprised to see Nox come down so quickly, said bluntly, “There’s nothing between Shelly and me.”

If it were nothing, he would not be explaining himself. However, Nox kept quiet and listened to Benjamin’s explanation.

“We’re really just ordinary friends. Please don’t misunderstand.”

“There’s no misunderstanding,” Nox said bluntly.

However, Benjamin felt that there was a hidden meaning behind Nox’s words.

“There’s nothing to misunderstand.” Nox added, ” It’s obvious that Shelly likes you.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Benjamin was stunned. He did not expect Nox to be so straightforward. In fact, Shelly had feelings for him… just like how he had feelings for Shelly. They could both feel it, but there were so many objective reasons that they chose to remain silent about it.

“So, there’s no need for you to explain yourself.”

“But Shelly and I can never be together.” Benjamin said bluntly, “My parents won’t agree, and I don’t want Shelly to feel burdened.”

“What if your parents agree?” Nox asked.

“I’ve never thought about getting back with Shelly.”

Nox sneered. If Benjamin had not thought about it, why would he be so involved with Shelly? Whether it was out of courtesy or convenience, if he wanted nothing else to do with her, he would avoid all suspicion. However, Benjamin did not do that, and neither did Shelly.

‘Forget it,’ Nox told himself. He felt that he was torturing himself by overthinking.

He said, “If there’s nothing else, let’S just leave it at that. I have something to do, so I’ll leave now.”

“Mr. Winter,” Benjamin called out to him again.

Nox was getting a little impatient.

“Do you like Shelly?” Benjamin asked.

“What are you getting at?”

“I hope you can treat Shelly well. If you really like her, he must cherish her. If you don’t like her anymore, I hope you can let her go as soon as possible. Don’t hurt her.”

“Why do you think I’m hurting her?” He wanted to tell Benjamin that she was hurting him instead!

“Shelly just doesn’t seem too happy,” Benjamin said bluntly.

“You don’t have to worry about my affairs with her for the time being.” Nox refused to say too much to Benjamin.

At least for the next ten days when Shelly still belonged to him, he did not want anyone to interfere.

“I just—”

“Enough!” Nox interrupted him, “Benjamin, even if I want to be a good person, you should know your limits. There are some things you shouldn’t butt your head in, so you’d better shut up!”

Benjamin stared at Nox.

“I don’t want to see you again for the next ten days!” Nox left after saying that.

Benjamin watched as Nox left. He did not understand why Nox said ten days, but N0X’s temper was as bad as ever.

He could even imagine how Shelly had to endure Nox’s hostility every day. Moreover, it was because he was afraid Nox would release his anger on Shelly that he explained himself to Nox. Obviously, his explanation did nothing. Hence, he thought about it and called Shelly.

Shelly had just coaxed Bella to sleep when she saw the call and quickly picked it up. “Benjamin.”

“Shelly, I saw Nox just now and explained to him about us.”

Shelly’s expression changed. “What did you tell him?”

Her tone also sounded a little harsh, and it made Benjamin pause for a moment. He did not expect Shelly to lose her temper with him. After all, Shelly had never been angry with him the entire time he Imew her.

He said, “I just don’t want to cause conflict between the two of you. I’m afraid that Nox will release his anger on you.”

“Between Nox and I…” Shelly chose not to say more..
